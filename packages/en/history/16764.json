He was born late in the fifth century in the\r\ncity of Caesarea in Palestine. As to his education and early years we\r\nare not informed, but we know that he studied to fit himself for the\r\nlegal profession. He came as a young man to Constantinople, and seems to\r\nhave made his mark immediately. For as early as the year 527 he was\r\nappointed legal adviser and private secretary[1] to Belisarius, then a\r\nvery young man who had been serving on the staff of the general\r\nJustinian, and had only recently been advanced to the office of general.\r\nShortly after this Justinian was called by his uncle Justinus to share\r\nthe throne of the Roman Empire, and four months later Justinus died,\r\nleaving Justinian sole emperor of the Romans. Thus the stage was set for\r\nthe scenes which are presented in the pages of Procopius. His own\r\nactivity continued till well nigh the end of Justinian's life, and he\r\nseems to have outlived his hero, Belisarius.\r\n\r\nDuring the eventful years of Belisarius' campaigning in Africa, in\r\nItaly, and in the East, Procopius was moving about with him and was an\r\neye-witness of the events he describes in his writings. In 527 we find\r\nhim in Mesopotamia; in 533 he accompanied Belisarius to Africa; and in\r\n536 he journeyed with him to Italy. He was therefore quite correct in\r\nthe assertion which he makes rather modestly in the introduction of his\r\nhistory, that he was better qualified than anyone else to write the\r\nhistory of that period. Besides his intimacy with Belisarius it should\r\nbe added that his position gave him the further advantage of a certain\r\nstanding at the imperial court in Constantinople, and brought him the\r\nacquaintance of many of the leading men of his day. Thus we have the\r\ntestimony of one intimately associated with the administration, and\r\nthis, together with the importance of the events through which he lived,\r\nmakes his record exceedingly interesting as well as historically\r\nimportant. One must admit that his position was not one to encourage\r\nimpartiality in his presentation of facts, and that the imperial favour\r\nwas not won by plain speaking; nevertheless we have before us a man who\r\ncould not obliterate himself enough to play the abject flatterer always,\r\nand he gives us the reverse, too, of his brilliant picture, as we shall\r\nsee presently.\r\n\r\nProcopius' three works give us a fairly complete account of the reign of\r\nJustinian up till near the year 560 A.D., and he has done us the favour\r\nof setting forth three different points of view which vary so widely\r\nthat posterity has sometimes found it difficult to reconcile them. His\r\ngreatest work, as well as his earliest, is the _History of the Wars_, in\r\neight books. The material is not arranged strictly according to\r\nchronological sequence, but so that the progress of events may be traced\r\nseparately in each one of three wars. Thus the first two books are given\r\nover to the Persian wars, the next two contain the account of the war\r\nwaged against the Vandals in Africa, the three following describe the\r\nstruggle against the Goths in Italy. These seven books were published\r\ntogether first, and the eighth book was added later as a supplement to\r\nbring the history up to about the date of 554, being a general account\r\nof events in different parts of the empire. It is necessary to bear in\r\nmind that the wars described separately by Procopius overlapped one\r\nanother in time, and that while the Romans were striving to hold back\r\nthe Persian aggressor they were also maintaining armies in Africa and in\r\nItaly. In fact the Byzantine empire was making a supreme effort to\r\nre-establish the old boundaries, and to reclaim the territories lost to\r\nthe barbarian nations. The emperor Justinian was fired by the ambition\r\nto make the Roman Empire once more a world power, and he drained every\r\nresource in his eagerness to make possible the fulfilment of this dream.\r\nIt was a splendid effort, but it was doomed to failure; the fallen\r\nedifice could not be permanently restored.\r\n\r\nThe history is more general than the title would imply, and all the\r\nimportant events of the time are touched upon. So while we read much of\r\nthe campaigns against the nations who were crowding back the boundaries\r\nof the old empire, we also hear of civic affairs such as the great Nika\r\ninsurrection in Byzantium in 532; similarly a careful account is given\r\nof the pestilence of 540, and the care shewn in describing the nature of\r\nthe disease shews plainly that the author must have had some\r\nacquaintance with the medical science of the time.\r\n\r\nAfter the seventh book of the _History of the Wars_ Procopius wrote the\r\n_Anecdota_, or _Secret History_. Here he freed himself from all the\r\nrestraints of respect or fear, and set down without scruple everything\r\nwhich he had been led to suppress or gloss over in the _History_ through\r\nmotives of policy. He attacks unmercifully the emperor and empress and\r\neven Belisarius and his wife Antonina, and displays to us one of the\r\nblackest pictures ever set down in writing. It is a record of wanton\r\ncrime and shameless debauchery, of intrigue and scandal both in public\r\nand in private life. It is plain that the thing is overdone, and the\r\nvery extravagance of the calumny makes it impossible to be believed;\r\nagain and again we meet statements which, if not absolutely impossible,\r\nare at least highly improbable. Many of the events of the _History_ are\r\npresented in an entirely new light; we seem to hear one speaking out of\r\nthe bitterness of his heart. It should be said, at the same time, that\r\nthere are very few contradictions in statements of fact. The author has\r\nplainly singled out the empress Theodora as the principal victim of his\r\nvenomous darts, and he gives an account of her early years which is both\r\nshocking and disgusting, but which, happily, we are not forced to regard\r\nas true. It goes without saying that such a work as this could not have\r\nbeen published during the lifetime of the author, and it appears that it\r\nwas not given to the world until after the death of Justinian in 565.\r\n\r\nSerious doubts have been entertained in times past as to the\r\nauthenticity of the _Anecdota_, for at first sight it seems impossible\r\nthat the man who wrote in the calm tone of the _History_ and who\r\nindulged in the fulsome praise of the panegyric _On the Buildings_ could\r\nhave also written the bitter libels of the _Anecdota_. It has come to be\r\nseen, however, that this feeling is not supported by any unanswerable\r\narguments, and it is now believed to be highly probable at least, that\r\nthe _Anecdota_ is the work of Procopius. Its bitterness may be extreme\r\nand its calumnies exaggerated beyond all reason, but it must be regarded\r\nas prompted by a reaction against the hollow life of the Byzantine\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nThe third work is entitled _On the Buildings_, and is plainly an attempt\r\nto gain favour with the emperor. We can only guess as to what the\r\nimmediate occasion was for its composition. It is plain, however, that\r\nthe publication of the _History_ could not have aroused the enthusiasm\r\nof Justinian; there was no attempt in it to praise the emperor, and one\r\nmight even read an unfavourable judgment between the lines. And it is\r\nnot at all unlikely that he was moved to envy by the praises bestowed\r\nupon his general, Belisarius. At any rate the work _On the Buildings_ is\r\nwritten in the empty style of the fawning flatterer. It is divided into\r\nsix short books and contains an account of all the public buildings of\r\nJustinian's reign in every district of the empire. The subject was well\r\nchosen and the material ample, and Procopius lost no opportunity of\r\nlauding his sovereign to the skies. It is an excellent example of the\r\nflorid panegyric style which was, unfortunately, in great favour with\r\nthe literary world of his own as well as later Byzantine times. But in\r\nspite of its faults, this work is a record of the greatest importance\r\nfor the study of the period, since it is a storehouse of information\r\nconcerning the internal administration of the empire.\r\n\r\nThe style of Procopius is in general clear and straightforward, and\r\nshews the mind of one who endeavours to speak the truth in simple\r\nlanguage wherever he is not under constraint to avoid it. At the same\r\ntime he is not ignorant of the arts of rhetoric, and especially in the\r\nspeeches he is fond of introducing sounding phrases and sententious\r\nstatements. He was a great admirer of the classical writers of prose,\r\nand their influence is everywhere apparent in his writing; in particular\r\nhe is much indebted to the historians Herodotus and Thucydides, and he\r\nborrows from them many expressions and turns of phrase. But the Greek\r\nwhich he writes is not the pure Attic, and we find many evidences of the\r\ninfluence of the contemporary spoken language.\r\n\r\nProcopius writes at times as a Christian, and at times as one imbued\r\nwith the ideas of the ancient religion of Greece. Doubtless his study of\r\nthe classical writers led him into this, perhaps unconsciously. At any\r\nrate it seems not to have been with him a matter in which even\r\nconsistency was demanded. It was politic to espouse the religion of the\r\nstate, but still he often allows himself to speak as if he were a\r\ncontemporary of Thucydides.\r\n\r\nThe text followed is that of Haury, issued in the Teubner series,\r\n1905-1913.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nThe _editio princeps_ of Procopius was published by David Hoeschel,\r\nAugsburg, 1607; the _Secret History_ was not included, and only\r\nsummaries of the six books of the work _On the Buildings_ were given.\r\nThe edition is not important except as being the first.\r\n\r\nThe _Secret History_ was printed for the first time separately with a\r\nLatin translation by Alemannus, Lyon, 1623.\r\n\r\nThe first complete edition was that of Maltretus, Paris, 1661-63,\r\nreprinted in Venice, 1729; the edition included a Latin translation of\r\nall the works, which was taken over into the edition of Procopius in the\r\n_Corpus Scriptorum Historiae Byzantinae_ by Dindorf, Bonn, 1833-38.\r\n\r\nTwo editions of recent years are to be mentioned: Domenico Comparetti,\r\n_La Guerra Gotica di Procopio di Cesarea_; testo Greco emendato sui\r\nmanoscritti con traduxione Italiana, Rome, 1895-98; 3 vols.

The memory of these events he deemed would\r\nbe a great thing and most helpful to men of the present time, and to\r\nfuture generations as well, in case time should ever again place men\r\nunder a similar stress. For men who purpose to enter upon a war or are\r\npreparing themselves for any kind of struggle may derive some benefit\r\nfrom a narrative of a similar situation in history, inasmuch as this\r\ndiscloses the final result attained by men of an earlier day in a\r\nstruggle of the same sort, and foreshadows, at least for those who are\r\nmost prudent in planning, what outcome present events will probably\r\nhave. Furthermore he had assurance that he was especially competent to\r\nwrite the history of these events, if for no other reason, because it\r\nfell to his lot, when appointed adviser to the general Belisarius, to be\r\nan eye-witness of practically all the events to be described. It was his\r\nconviction that while cleverness is appropriate to rhetoric, and\r\ninventiveness to poetry, truth alone is appropriate to history. In\r\naccordance with this principle he has not concealed the failures of even\r\nhis most intimate acquaintances, but has written down with complete\r\naccuracy everything which befell those concerned, whether it happened to\r\nbe done well or ill by them.\r\n\r\nIt will be evident that no more important or mightier deeds are to be\r\nfound in history than those which have been enacted in these\r\nwars,--provided one wishes to base his judgment on the truth. For in\r\nthem more remarkable feats have been performed than in any other wars\r\nwith which we are acquainted; unless, indeed, any reader of this\r\nnarrative should give the place of honour to antiquity, and consider\r\ncontemporary achievements unworthy to be counted remarkable. There are\r\nthose, for example, who call the soldiers of the present day \"bowmen,\"\r\nwhile to those of the most ancient times they wish to attribute such\r\nlofty terms as \"hand-to-hand fighters,\" \"shield-men,\" and other names of\r\nthat sort; and they think that the valour of those times has by no means\r\nsurvived to the present,--an opinion which is at once careless and\r\nwholly remote from actual experience of these matters. For the thought\r\nhas never occurred to them that, as regards the Homeric bowmen who had\r\nthe misfortune to be ridiculed by this term[1] derived from their art,\r\nthey were neither carried by horse nor protected by spear or shield[2].\r\nIn fact there was no protection at all for their bodies; they entered\r\nbattle on foot, and were compelled to conceal themselves, either\r\nsingling out the shield of some comrade[3], or seeking safety behind a\r\ntombstone on a mound[4], from which position they could neither save\r\nthemselves in case of rout, nor fall upon a flying foe. Least of all\r\ncould they participate in a decisive struggle in the open, but they\r\nalways seemed to be stealing something which belonged to the men who\r\nwere engaged in the struggle. And apart from this they were so\r\nindifferent in their practice of archery that they drew the bowstring\r\nonly to the breast[5], so that the missile sent forth was naturally\r\nimpotent and harmless to those whom it hit[6]. Such, it is evident, was\r\nthe archery of the past. But the bowmen of the present time go into\r\nbattle wearing corselets and fitted out with greaves which extend up to\r\nthe knee. From the right side hang their arrows, from the other the\r\nsword. And there are some who have a spear also attached to them and, at\r\nthe shoulders, a sort of small shield without a grip, such as to cover\r\nthe region of the face and neck. They are expert horsemen, and are able\r\nwithout difficulty to direct their bows to either side while riding at\r\nfull speed, and to shoot an opponent whether in pursuit or in flight.\r\nThey draw the bowstring along by the forehead about opposite the right\r\near, thereby charging the arrow with such an impetus as to kill whoever\r\nstands in the way, shield and corselet alike having no power to check\r\nits force. Still there are those who take into consideration none of\r\nthese things, who reverence and worship the ancient times, and give no\r\ncredit to modern improvements. But no such consideration will prevent\r\nthe conclusion that most great and notable deeds have been performed in\r\nthese wars. And the history of them will begin at some distance back,\r\ntelling of the fortunes in war of the Romans and the Medes, their\r\nreverses and their successes.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n[408 A.D.] When the Roman Emperor Arcadius was at the point of death in\r\nByzantium, having a malechild, Theodosius, who was still unweaned, he\r\nfelt grave fears not only for him but for the government as well, not\r\nknowing how he should provide wisely for both. For he perceived that, if\r\nhe provided a partner in government for Theodosius, he would in fact be\r\ndestroying his own son by bringing forward against him a foe clothed in\r\nthe regal power; while if he set him alone over the empire, many would\r\ntry to mount the throne, taking advantage, as they might be expected to\r\ndo, of the helplessness of the child. These men would rise against the\r\ngovernment, and, after destroying Theodosius, would make themselves\r\ntyrants without difficulty, since the boy had no kinsman in Byzantium to\r\nbe his guardian. For Arcadius had no hope that the boy's uncle,\r\nHonorius, would succour him, inasmuch as the situation in Italy was\r\nalready troublesome. And he was equally disturbed by the attitude of the\r\nMedes, fearing lest these barbarians should trample down the youthful\r\nemperor and do the Romans irreparable harm. When Arcadius was confronted\r\nwith this difficult situation, though he had not shewn himself sagacious\r\nin other matters, he devised a plan which was destined to preserve\r\nwithout trouble both his child and his throne, either as a result of\r\nconversation with certain of the learned men, such as are usually found\r\nin numbers among the advisers of a sovereign, or from some divine\r\ninspiration which came to him. For in drawing up the writings of his\r\nwill, he designated the child as his successor to the throne, but\r\nappointed as guardian over him Isdigerdes, the Persian King, enjoining\r\nupon him earnestly in his will to preserve the empire for Theodosius by\r\nall his power and foresight. So Arcadius died, having thus arranged his\r\nprivate affairs as well as those of the empire. But Isdigerdes, the\r\nPersian King, when he saw this writing which was duly delivered to him,\r\nbeing even before a sovereign whose nobility of character had won for\r\nhim the greatest renown, did then display a virtue at once amazing and\r\nremarkable. For, loyally observing the behests of Arcadius, he adopted\r\nand continued without interruption a policy of profound peace with the\r\nRomans, and thus preserved the empire for Theodosius. Indeed, he\r\nstraightway dispatched a letter to the Roman senate, not declining the\r\noffice of guardian of the Emperor Theodosius, and threatening war\r\nagainst any who should attempt to enter into a conspiracy against him.\r\n\r\n[441 A.D.] When Theodosius had grown to manhood and was in the prime of\r\nlife, and Isdigerdes had been taken from the world by disease,\r\nVararanes, the Persian King, invaded the Roman domains with a mighty\r\narmy; however he did no damage, but returned to his home without\r\naccomplishing anything. This came about in the following way. Anatolius,\r\nGeneral of the East, had, as it happened, been sent by the Emperor\r\nTheodosius as ambassador to the Persians, alone and unaccompanied; as he\r\napproached the Median army, solitary as he was, he leapt down from his\r\nhorse, and advanced on foot toward Vararanes. And when Vararanes saw\r\nhim, he enquired from those who were near who this man could be who was\r\ncoming forward. And they replied that he was the general of the Romans.\r\nThereupon the king was so dumbfounded by this excessive degree of\r\nrespect that he himself wheeled his horse about and rode away, and the\r\nwhole Persian host followed him. When he had reached his own territory,\r\nhe received the envoy with great cordiality, and granted the treaty of\r\npeace on the terms which Anatolius desired of him; one condition,\r\nhowever, he added, that neither party should construct any new\r\nfortification in his own territory in the neighbourhood of the boundary\r\nline between the two countries. When this treaty had been executed, both\r\nsovereigns then continued to administer the affairs of their respective\r\ncountries as seemed best to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAt a later time the Persian King Perozes became involved in a war\r\nconcerning boundaries with the nation of the Ephthalitae Huns, who are\r\ncalled White Huns, gathered an imposing army, and marched against them.\r\nThe Ephthalitae are of the stock of the Huns in fact as well as in name;\r\nhowever they do not mingle with any of the Huns known to us, for they\r\noccupy a land neither adjoining nor even very near to them; but their\r\nterritory lies immediately to the north of Persia; indeed their city,\r\ncalled Gorgo, is located over against the Persian frontier, and is\r\nconsequently the centre of frequent contests concerning boundary lines\r\nbetween the two peoples. For they are not nomads like the other Hunnic\r\npeoples, but for a long period have been established in a goodly land.\r\nAs a result of this they have never made any incursion into the Roman\r\nterritory except in company with the Median army. They are the only ones\r\namong the Huns who have white bodies and countenances which are not\r\nugly. It is also true that their manner of living is unlike that of\r\ntheir kinsmen, nor do they live a savage life as they do; but they are\r\nruled by one king, and since they possess a lawful constitution, they\r\nobserve right and justice in their dealings both with one another and\r\nwith their neighbours, in no degree less than the Romans and the\r\nPersians. Moreover, the wealthy citizens are in the habit of attaching\r\nto themselves friends to the number of twenty or more, as the case may\r\nbe, and these become permanently their banquet-companions, and have a\r\nshare in all their property, enjoying some kind of a common right in\r\nthis matter. Then, when the man who has gathered such a company together\r\ncomes to die, it is the custom that all these men be borne alive into\r\nthe tomb with him.\r\n\r\nPerozes, marching against these Ephthalitae, was accompanied by an\r\nambassador, Eusebius by name, who, as it happened, had been sent to his\r\ncourt by the Emperor Zeno. Now the Ephthalitae made it appear to their\r\nenemy that they had turned to flight because they were wholly terrified\r\nby their attack, and they retired with all speed to a place which was\r\nshut in on every side by precipitous mountains, and abundantly screened\r\nby a close forest of wide-spreading trees. Now as one advanced between\r\nthe mountains to a great distance, a broad way appeared in the valley,\r\nextending apparently to an indefinite distance, but at the end it had no\r\noutlet at all, but terminated in the very midst of the circle of\r\nmountains. So Perozes, with no thought at all of treachery, and\r\nforgetting that he was marching in a hostile country, continued the\r\npursuit without the least caution. A small body of the Huns were in\r\nflight before him, while the greater part of their force, by concealing\r\nthemselves in the rough country, got in the rear of the hostile army;\r\nbut as yet they desired not to be seen by them, in order that they might\r\nadvance well into the trap and get as far as possible in among the\r\nmountains, and thus be no longer able to turn back. When the Medes began\r\nto realize all this (for they now began to have a glimmering of their\r\nperil), though they refrained from speaking of the situation themselves\r\nthrough fear of Perozes, yet they earnestly entreated Eusebius to urge\r\nupon the king, who was completely ignorant of his own plight, that he\r\nshould take counsel rather than make an untimely display of daring, and\r\nconsider well whether there was any way of safety open to them. So he\r\nwent before Perozes, but by no means revealed the calamity which was\r\nupon them; instead he began with a fable, telling how a lion once\r\nhappened upon a goat bound down and bleating on a mound of no very great\r\nheight, and how the lion, bent upon making a feast of the goat, rushed\r\nforward with intent to seize him, but fell into a trench exceedingly\r\ndeep, in which was a circular path, narrow and endless (for it had no\r\noutlet anywhere), which indeed the owners of the goat had constructed\r\nfor this very purpose, and they had placed the goat above it to be a\r\nbait for the lion. When Perozes heard this, a fear came over him lest\r\nperchance the Medes had brought harm upon themselves by their pursuit of\r\nthe enemy. He therefore advanced no further, but, remaining where he\r\nwas, began to consider the situation. By this time the Huns were\r\nfollowing him without any concealment, and were guarding the entrance of\r\nthe place in order that their enemy might no longer be able to withdraw\r\nto the rear. Then at last the Persians saw clearly in what straits they\r\nwere, and they felt that the situation was desperate; for they had no\r\nhope that they would ever escape from the peril. Then the king of the\r\nEphthalitae sent some of his followers to Perozes; he upbraided him at\r\nlength for his senseless foolhardiness, by which he had wantonly\r\ndestroyed both himself and the Persian people, but he announced that\r\neven so the Huns would grant them deliverance, if Perozes should consent\r\nto prostrate himself before him as having proved himself master, and,\r\ntaking the oaths traditional among the Persians, should give pledges\r\nthat they would never again take the field against the nation of the\r\nEphthalitae. When Perozes heard this, he held a consultation with the\r\nMagi who were present and enquired of them whether he must comply with\r\nthe terms dictated by the enemy. The Magi replied that, as to the oath,\r\nhe should settle the matter according to his own pleasure; as for the\r\nrest, however, he should circumvent his enemy by craft. And they\r\nreminded him that it was the custom among the Persians to prostrate\r\nthemselves before the rising sun each day; he should, therefore, watch\r\nthe time closely and meet the leader of the Ephthalitae at dawn, and\r\nthen, turning toward the rising sun, make his obeisance. In this way,\r\nthey explained, he would be able in the future to escape the ignominy of\r\nthe deed. Perozes accordingly gave the pledges concerning the peace, and\r\nprostrated himself before his foe exactly as the Magi had suggested, and\r\nso, with the whole Median army intact, gladly retired homeward.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nNot long after this, disregarding the oath he had sworn, he was eager to\r\navenge himself upon the Huns for the insult done him. He therefore\r\nstraightway gathered together from the whole land all the Persians and\r\ntheir allies, and led them against the Ephthalitae; of all his sons he\r\nleft behind him only one, Cabades by name, who, as it happened, was just\r\npast the age of boyhood; all the others, about thirty in number, he took\r\nwith him. The Ephthalitae, upon learning of his invasion, were aggrieved\r\nat the deception they had suffered at the hands of their enemy, and\r\nbitterly reproached their king as having abandoned them to the Medes.\r\nHe, with a laugh, enquired of them what in the world of theirs he had\r\nabandoned, whether their land or their arms or any other part of their\r\npossessions. They thereupon retorted that he had abandoned nothing,\r\nexcept, forsooth, the one opportunity on which, as it turned out,\r\neverything else depended. Now the Ephthalitae with all zeal demanded\r\nthat they should go out to meet the invaders, but the king sought to\r\nrestrain them at any rate for the moment. For he insisted that as yet\r\nthey had received no definite information as to the invasion, for the\r\nPersians were still within their own boundaries. So, remaining where he\r\nwas, he busied himself as follows. In the plain where the Persians were\r\nto make their irruption into the land of the Ephthalitae he marked off a\r\ntract of very great extent and made a deep trench of sufficient width;\r\nbut in the centre he left a small portion of ground intact, enough to\r\nserve as a way for ten horses. Over the trench he placed reeds, and upon\r\nthe reeds he scattered earth, thereby concealing the true surface. He\r\nthen directed the forces of the Huns that, when the time came to retire\r\ninside the trench, they should draw themselves together into a narrow\r\ncolumn and pass rather slowly across this neck of land, taking care that\r\nthey should not fall into the ditch[7]. And he hung from the top of the\r\nroyal banner the salt over which Perozes had once sworn the oath which\r\nhe had disregarded in taking the field against the Huns. Now as long as\r\nhe heard that the enemy were in their own territory, he remained at\r\nrest; but when he learned from his scouts that they had reached the city\r\nof Gorgo which lies on the extreme Persian frontier, and that departing\r\nthence they were now advancing against his army, remaining himself with\r\nthe greater part of his troops inside the trench, he sent forward a\r\nsmall detachment with instructions to allow themselves to be seen at a\r\ndistance by the enemy in the plain, and, when once they had been seen,\r\nto flee at full speed to the rear, keeping in mind his command\r\nconcerning the trench as soon as they drew near to it. They did as\r\ndirected, and, as they approached the trench, they drew themselves into\r\na narrow column, and all passed over and joined the rest of the army.\r\nBut the Persians, having no means of perceiving the stratagem, gave\r\nchase at full speed across a very level plain, possessed as they were by\r\na spirit of fury against the enemy, and fell into the trench, every man\r\nof them, not alone the first but also those who followed in the rear.\r\nFor since they entered into the pursuit with great fury, as I have said,\r\nthey failed to notice the catastrophe which had befallen their leaders,\r\nbut fell in on top of them with their horses and lances, so that, as was\r\nnatural, they both destroyed them, and were themselves no less involved\r\nin ruin. Among them were Perozes and all his sons. And just as he was\r\nabout to fall into this pit, they say that he realized the danger, and\r\nseized and threw from him the pearl which hung from his right ear,--a\r\ngem of wonderful whiteness and greatly prized on account of its\r\nextraordinary size--in order, no doubt, that no one might wear it after\r\nhim; for it was a thing exceedingly beautiful to look upon, such as no\r\nking before him had possessed. This story, however, seems to me\r\nuntrustworthy, because a man who found himself in such peril would have\r\nthought of nothing else; but I suppose that his ear was crushed in this\r\ndisaster, and the pearl disappeared somewhere or other. This pearl the\r\nRoman Emperor then made every effort to buy from the Ephthalitae, but\r\nwas utterly unsuccessful. For the barbarians were not able to find it\r\nalthough they sought it with great labour. However, they say that the\r\nEphthalitae found it later and sold it to Cabades.\r\n\r\nThe story of this pearl, as told by the Persians, is worth recounting,\r\nfor perhaps to some it may not seem altogether incredible. For they say\r\nthat it was lodged in its oyster in the sea which washes the Persian\r\ncoast, and that the oyster was swimming not far from the shore; both its\r\nvalves were standing open and the pearl lay between them, a wonderful\r\nsight and notable, for no pearl in all history could be compared with it\r\nat all, either in size or in beauty. A shark, then, of enormous size and\r\ndreadful fierceness, fell in love with this sight and followed close\r\nupon it, leaving it neither day nor night; even when he was compelled to\r\ntake thought for food, he would only look about for something eatable\r\nwhere he was, and when he found some bit, he would snatch it up and eat\r\nit hurriedly; then overtaking the oyster immediately, he would sate\r\nhimself again with the sight he loved. At length a fisherman, they say,\r\nnoticed what was passing, but in terror of the monster he recoiled from\r\nthe danger; however, he reported the whole matter to the king, Perozes.\r\nNow when Perozes heard his account, they say that a great longing for\r\nthe pearl came over him, and he urged on this fisherman with many\r\nflatteries and hopes of reward. Unable to resist the importunities of\r\nthe monarch, he is said to have addressed Perozes as follows: \"My\r\nmaster, precious to a man is money, more precious still is his life, but\r\nmost prized of all are his children; and being naturally constrained by\r\nhis love for them a man might perhaps dare anything. Now I intend to\r\nmake trial of the monster, and hope to make thee master of the pearl.\r\nAnd if I succeed in this struggle, it is plain that henceforth I shall\r\nbe ranked among those who are counted blessed. For it is not unlikely\r\nthat thou, as King of Kings, wilt reward me with all good things; and\r\nfor me it will be sufficient, even if it so fall out that I gain no\r\nreward, to have shewn myself a benefactor of my master. But if it must\r\nneeds be that I become the prey of this monster, thy task indeed it will\r\nbe, O King, to requite my children for their father's death. Thus even\r\nafter my death I shall still be a wage-earner among those closest to me,\r\nand thou wilt win greater fame for thy goodness,--for in helping my\r\nchildren thou wilt confer a boon upon me, who shall have no power to\r\nthank thee for the benefit--because generosity is seen to be without\r\nalloy only when it is displayed towards the dead.\" With these words he\r\ndeparted. And when he came to the place where the oyster was accustomed\r\nto swim and the shark to follow, he seated himself there upon a rock,\r\nwatching for an opportunity of catching the pearl alone without its\r\nadmirer. As soon as it came about that the shark had happened upon\r\nsomething which would serve him for food, and was delaying over it, the\r\nfisherman left upon the beach those who were following him for this\r\nservice, and made straight for the oyster with all his might; already he\r\nhad seized it and was hastening with all speed to get out of the water,\r\nwhen the shark noticed him and rushed to the rescue. The fisherman saw\r\nhim coming, and, when he was about to be overtaken not far from the\r\nbeach, he hurled his booty with all his force upon the land, and was\r\nhimself soon afterwards seized and destroyed. But the men who had been\r\nleft upon the beach picked up the pearl, and, conveying it to the king,\r\nreported all that had happened. Such, then, is the story which the\r\nPersians relate, just as I have set it down, concerning this pearl. But\r\nI shall return to the previous narrative.\r\n\r\n[484 A.D.] Thus Perozes was destroyed and the whole Persian army with\r\nhim. For the few who by chance did not fall into the ditch found\r\nthemselves at the mercy of the enemy. As a result of this experience a\r\nlaw was established among the Persians that, while marching in hostile\r\nterritory, they should never engage in any pursuit, even if it should\r\nhappen that the enemy had been driven back by force. Thereupon those who\r\nhad not marched with Perozes and had remained in their own land chose as\r\ntheir king Cabades, the youngest son of Perozes, who was then the only\r\none surviving. At that time, then, the Persians became subject and\r\ntributary to the Ephthalitae, until Cabades had established his power\r\nmost securely and no longer deemed it necessary to pay the annual\r\ntribute to them. And the time these barbarians ruled over the Persians\r\nwas two years.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nBut as time went on Cabades became more high-handed in the\r\nadministration of the government, and introduced innovations into the\r\nconstitution, among which was a law which he promulgated providing that\r\nPersians should have communal intercourse with their women, a measure\r\nwhich by no means pleased the common people. [486 A.D.] Accordingly they\r\nrose against him, removed him from the throne, and kept him in prison in\r\nchains. They then chose Blases, the brother of Perozes, to be their\r\nking, since, as has been said, no male offspring of Perozes was left,\r\nand it is not lawful among the Persians for any man by birth a common\r\ncitizen to be set upon the throne, except in case the royal family be\r\ntotally extinct. Blases, upon receiving the royal power, gathered\r\ntogether the nobles of the Persians and held a conference concerning\r\nCabades; for it was not the wish of the majority to put the man to\r\ndeath. After the expression of many opinions on both sides there came\r\nforward a certain man of repute among the Persians, whose name was\r\nGousanastades, and whose office that of \"chanaranges\" (which would be\r\nthe Persian term for general); his official province lay on the very\r\nfrontier of the Persian territory in a district which adjoins the land\r\nof the Ephthalitae. Holding up his knife, the kind with which the\r\nPersians were accustomed to trim their nails, of about the length of a\r\nman's finger, but not one-third as wide as a finger, he said: \"You see\r\nthis knife, how extremely small it is; nevertheless it is able at the\r\npresent time to accomplish a deed, which, be assured, my dear Persians,\r\na little later two myriads of mail-clad men could not bring to pass.\"\r\nThis he said hinting that, if they did not put Cabades to death, he\r\nwould straightway make trouble for the Persians. But they were\r\naltogether unwilling to put to death a man of the royal blood, and\r\ndecided to confine him in a castle which it is their habit to call the\r\n\"Prison of Oblivion.\" For if anyone is cast into it, the law permits no\r\nmention of him to be made thereafter, but death is the penalty for the\r\nman who speaks his name; for this reason it has received this title\r\namong the Persians. On one occasion, however, the History of the\r\nArmenians relates that the operation of the law regarding the Prison of\r\nOblivion was suspended by the Persians in the following way.\r\n\r\nThere was once a truceless war, lasting two and thirty years, between\r\nthe Persians and the Armenians, when Pacurius was king of the Persians,\r\nand of the Armenians, Arsaces, of the line of the Arsacidae. And by the\r\nlong continuance of this war it came about that both sides suffered\r\nbeyond measure, and especially the Armenians. But each nation was\r\npossessed by such great distrust of the other that neither of them could\r\nmake overtures of peace to their opponents. In the meantime it happened\r\nthat the Persians became engaged in a war with certain other barbarians\r\nwho lived not far from the Armenians. Accordingly the Armenians, in\r\ntheir eagerness to make a display to the Persians of their goodwill and\r\ndesire for peace, decided to invade the land of these barbarians, first\r\nrevealing their plan to the Persians. Then they fell upon them\r\nunexpectedly and killed almost the whole population, old and young\r\nalike. Thereupon Pacurius, who was overjoyed at the deed, sent certain\r\nof his trusted friends to Arsaces, and giving him pledges of security,\r\ninvited him to his presence. And when Arsaces came to him he shewed him\r\nevery kindness, and treated him as a brother on an equal footing with\r\nhimself. Then he bound him by the most solemn oaths, and he himself\r\nswore likewise, that in very truth the Persians and Armenians should\r\nthenceforth be friends and allies to each other; thereafter he\r\nstraightway dismissed Arsaces to return to his own country.\r\n\r\nNot long after this certain persons slandered Arsaces, saying that he\r\nwas purposing to undertake some seditious enterprise. Pacurius was\r\npersuaded by these men and again summoned him, intimating that he was\r\nanxious to confer with him on general matters. And he, without any\r\nhesitation at all, came to the king, taking with him several of the most\r\nwarlike among the Armenians, and among them Bassicius, who was at once\r\nhis general and counsellor; for he was both brave and sagacious to a\r\nremarkable degree. Straightway, then, Pacurius heaped reproach and abuse\r\nupon both Arsaces and Bassicius, because, disregarding the sworn\r\ncompact, they had so speedily turned their thoughts toward secession.\r\nThey, however, denied the charge, and swore most insistently that no\r\nsuch thing had been considered by them. At first, therefore, Pacurius\r\nkept them under guard in disgrace, but after a time he enquired of the\r\nMagi what should be done with them. Now the Magi deemed it by no means\r\njust to condemn men who denied their guilt and had not been explicitly\r\nfound guilty, but they suggested to him an artifice by which Arsaces\r\nhimself might be compelled to become openly his own accuser. They bade\r\nhim cover the floor of the royal tent with earth, one half from the land\r\nof Persia, and the other half from Armenia. This the king did as\r\ndirected. Then the Magi, after putting the whole tent under a spell by\r\nmeans of some magic rites, bade the king take his walk there in company\r\nwith Arsaces, reproaching him meanwhile with having violated the sworn\r\nagreement. They said, further, that they too must be present at the\r\nconversation, for in this way there would be witnesses of all that was\r\nsaid. Accordingly Pacurius straightway summoned Arsaces, and began to\r\nwalk to and fro with him in the tent in the presence of the Magi; he\r\nenquired of the man why he had disregarded his sworn promises, and was\r\nsetting about to harass the Persians and Armenians once more with\r\ngrievous troubles. Now as long as the conversation took place on the\r\nground which was covered with the earth from the land of Persia, Arsaces\r\ncontinued to make denial, and, pledging himself with the most fearful\r\noaths, insisted that he was a faithful subject of Pacurius. But when, in\r\nthe midst of his speaking, he came to the centre of the tent where they\r\nstepped upon Armenian earth, then, compelled by some unknown power, he\r\nsuddenly changed the tone of his words to one of defiance, and from then\r\non ceased not to threaten Pacurius and the Persians, announcing that he\r\nwould have vengeance upon them for this insolence as soon as he should\r\nbecome his own master. These words of youthful folly he continued to\r\nutter as they walked all the way, until turning back, he came again to\r\nthe earth from the Persian land. Thereupon, as if chanting a\r\nrecantation, he was once more a suppliant, offering pitiable\r\nexplanations to Pacurius. But when he came again to the Armenian earth,\r\nhe returned to his threats. In this way he changed many times to one\r\nside and the other, and concealed none of his secrets. Then at length\r\nthe Magi passed judgment against him as having violated the treaty and\r\nthe oaths. Pacurius flayed Bassicius, and, making a bag of his skin,\r\nfilled it with chaff and suspended it from a lofty tree. As for Arsaces,\r\nsince Pacurius could by no means bring himself to kill a man of the\r\nroyal blood, he confined him in the Prison of Oblivion.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, when the Persians were marching against a barbarian\r\nnation, they were accompanied by an Armenian who had been especially\r\nintimate with Arsaces and had followed him when he went into the Persian\r\nland. This man proved himself a capable warrior in this campaign, as\r\nPacurius observed, and was the chief cause of the Persian victory. For\r\nthis reason Pacurius begged him to make any request he wished, assuring\r\nhim that he would be refused nothing by him. The Armenian asked for\r\nnothing else than that he might for one day pay homage to Arsaces in the\r\nway he might desire. Now it annoyed the king exceedingly, that he should\r\nbe compelled to set aside a law so ancient; however, in order to be\r\nwholly true to his word, he permitted that the request be granted. When\r\nthe man found himself by the king's order in the Prison of Oblivion, he\r\ngreeted Arsaces, and both men, embracing each other, joined their voices\r\nin a sweet lament, and, bewailing the hard fate that was upon them, were\r\nable only with difficulty to release each other from the embrace. Then,\r\nwhen they had sated themselves with weeping and ceased from tears, the\r\nArmenian bathed Arsaces, and completely adorned his person, neglecting\r\nnothing, and, putting on him the royal robe, caused him to recline on a\r\nbed of rushes. Then Arsaces entertained those present with a royal\r\nbanquet just as was formerly his custom. During this feast many speeches\r\nwere made over the cups which greatly pleased Arsaces, and many\r\nincidents occurred which delighted his heart. The drinking was prolonged\r\nuntil nightfall, all feeling the keenest delight in their mutual\r\nintercourse; at length they parted from each other with great\r\nreluctance, and separated thoroughly imbued with happiness. Then they\r\ntell how Arsaces said that after spending the sweetest day of his life,\r\nand enjoying the company of the man he had missed most of all, he would\r\nno longer willingly endure the miseries of life; and with these words,\r\nthey say, he dispatched himself with a knife which, as it happened, he\r\nhad purposely stolen at the banquet, and thus departed from among men.\r\nSuch then is the story concerning this Arsaces, related in the Armenian\r\nHistory just as I have told it, and it was on that occasion that the law\r\nregarding the Prison of Oblivion was set aside. But I must return to the\r\npoint from which I have strayed.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nWhile Cabades was in the prison he was cared for by his wife, who went\r\nin to him constantly and carried him supplies of food. Now the keeper of\r\nthe prison began to make advances to her, for she was exceedingly\r\nbeautiful to look upon. And when Cabades learned this from his wife, he\r\nbade her give herself over to the man to treat as he wished. In this way\r\nthe keeper of the prison came to be familiar with the woman, and he\r\nconceived for her an extraordinary love, and as a result permitted her\r\nto go in to her husband just as she wished, and to depart from there\r\nagain without interference from anyone. Now there was a Persian notable,\r\nSeoses by name, a devoted friend of Cabades, who was constantly in the\r\nneighbourhood of this prison, watching his opportunity, in the hope that\r\nhe might in some way be able to effect his deliverance. And he sent word\r\nto Cabades through his wife that he was keeping horses and men in\r\nreadiness not far from the prison, and he indicated to him a certain\r\nspot. Then one day as night drew near Cabades persuaded his wife to give\r\nhim her own garment, and, dressing herself in his clothes, to sit\r\ninstead of him in the prison where he usually sat. In this way,\r\ntherefore, Cabades made his escape from the prison. For although the\r\nguards who were on duty saw him, they supposed that it was the woman,\r\nand therefore decided not to hinder or otherwise annoy him. At daybreak\r\nthey saw in the cell the woman in her husband's clothes, and were so\r\ncompletely deceived as to think that Cabades was there, and this belief\r\nprevailed during several days, until Cabades had advanced well on his\r\nway. As to the fate which befell the woman after the stratagem had come\r\nto light, and the manner in which they punished her, I am unable to\r\nspeak with accuracy. For the Persian accounts do not agree with each\r\nother, and for this reason I omit the narration of them.\r\n\r\nCabades, in company with Seoses, completely escaped detection, and\r\nreached the Ephthalitae Huns; there the king gave him his daughter in\r\nmarriage, and then, since Cabades was now his son-in-law, he put under\r\nhis command a very formidable army for a campaign against the Persians.\r\nThis army the Persians were quite unwilling to encounter, and they made\r\nhaste to flee in every direction. And when Cabades reached the territory\r\nwhere Gousanastades exercised his authority, he stated to some of his\r\nfriends that he would appoint as chanaranges the first man of the\r\nPersians who should on that day come into his presence and offer his\r\nservices. But even as he said this, he repented his speech, for there\r\ncame to his mind a law of the Persians which ordains that offices among\r\nthe Persians shall not be conferred upon others than those to whom each\r\nparticular honour belongs by right of birth. For he feared lest someone\r\nshould come to him first who was not a kinsman of the present\r\nchanaranges, and that he would be compelled to set aside the law in\r\norder to keep his word. Even as he was considering this matter, chance\r\nbrought it about that, without dishonouring the law, he could still keep\r\nhis word. For the first man who came to him happened to be\r\nAdergoudounbades, a young man who was a relative of Gousanastades and an\r\nespecially capable warrior. He addressed Cabades as \"Lord,\" and was the\r\nfirst to do obeisance to him as king, and besought him to use him as a\r\nslave for any service whatever. [488 A.D.] So Cabades made his way into\r\nthe royal palace without any trouble, and, taking Blases destitute of\r\ndefenders, he put out his eyes, using the method of blinding commonly\r\nemployed by the Persians against malefactors, that is, either by heating\r\nolive oil and pouring it, while boiling fiercely, into the wide-open\r\neyes, or by heating in the fire an iron needle, and with this pricking\r\nthe eyeballs. Thereafter Blases was kept in confinement, having ruled\r\nover the Persians two years. Gousanastades was put to death and\r\nAdergoudounbades was established in his place in the office of\r\nchanaranges, while Seoses was immediately proclaimed \"adrastadaran\r\nsalanes,\"--a title designating the one set in authority over all\r\nmagistrates and over the whole army. Seoses was the first and only man\r\nwho held this office in Persia; for it was conferred on no one before or\r\nafter that time. And the kingdom was strengthened by Cabades and guarded\r\nsecurely; for in shrewdness and activity he was surpassed by none.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nA little later Cabades was owing the king of the Ephthalitae a sum of\r\nmoney which he was not able to pay him, and he therefore requested the\r\nRoman emperor Anastasius to lend him this money. Whereupon Anastasius\r\nconferred with some of his friends and enquired of them whether this\r\nshould be done; and they would not permit him to make the loan. For, as\r\nthey pointed out, it was inexpedient to make more secure by means of\r\ntheir money the friendship between their enemies and the Ephthalitae;\r\nindeed it was better for the Romans to disturb their relations as much\r\nas possible. It was for this reason, and for no just cause, that Cabades\r\ndecided to make an expedition against the Romans. [502 A.D.] First he\r\ninvaded the land of the Armenians, moving with such rapidity as to\r\nanticipate the news of his coming, and, after plundering the greater\r\npart of it in a rapid campaign, he unexpectedly arrived at the city of\r\nAmida, which is situated in Mesopotamia, and, although the season was\r\nwinter, he invested the town. Now the citizens of Amida had no soldiers\r\nat hand, seeing that it was a time of peace and prosperity, and in other\r\nrespects were utterly unprepared; nevertheless they were quite unwilling\r\nto yield to the enemy, and shewed an unexpected fortitude in holding out\r\nagainst dangers and hardships.\r\n\r\nNow there was among the Syrians a certain just man, Jacobus by name, who\r\nhad trained himself with exactitude in matters pertaining to religion.\r\nThis man had confined himself many years before in a place called\r\nEndielon, a day's journey from Amida, in order that he might with more\r\nsecurity devote himself to pious contemplation. The men of this place,\r\nassisting his purpose, had surrounded him with a kind of fencing, in\r\nwhich the stakes were not continuous, but set at intervals, so that\r\nthose who approached could see and hold converse with him. And they had\r\nconstructed for him a small roof over his head, sufficient to keep off\r\nthe rain and snow. There this man had been sitting for a long time,\r\nnever yielding either to heat or cold, and sustaining his life with\r\ncertain seeds, which he was accustomed to eat, not indeed every day, but\r\nonly at long intervals. Now some of the Ephthalitae who were overrunning\r\nthe country thereabout saw this Jacobus and with great eagerness drew\r\ntheir bows with intent to shoot at him. But the hands of every one of\r\nthem became motionless and utterly unable to manage the bow. When this\r\nwas noised about through the army and came to the ears of Cabades, he\r\ndesired to see the thing with his own eyes; and when he saw it, both he\r\nand the Persians who were with him were seized with great astonishment,\r\nand he entreated Jacobus to forgive the barbarians their crime. And he\r\nforgave them with a word, and the men were released from their distress.\r\nCabades then bade the man ask for whatever he wished, supposing that he\r\nwould ask for a great sum of money, and he also added with youthful\r\nrecklessness that he would be refused nothing by him. But he requested\r\nCabades to grant to him all the men who during that war should come to\r\nhim as fugitives. This request Cabades granted, and gave him a written\r\npledge of his personal safety. And great numbers of men, as might be\r\nexpected, came flocking to him from all sides and found safety there;\r\nfor the deed became widely known. Thus, then, did these things take\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nCabades, in besieging Amida, brought against every part of the defences\r\nthe engines known as rams; but the townspeople constantly broke off the\r\nheads of the rams by means of timbers thrown across them[8]. However,\r\nCabades did not slacken his efforts until he realized that the wall\r\ncould not be successfully assailed in this way. For, though he battered\r\nthe wall many times, he was quite unable to break down any portion of\r\nthe defence, or even to shake it; so secure had been the work of the\r\nbuilders who had constructed it long before. Failing in this, Cabades\r\nraised an artificial hill to threaten the city, considerably overtopping\r\nthe wall; but the besieged, starting from the inside of their defences,\r\nmade a tunnel extending under the hill, and from there stealthily\r\ncarried out the earth, until they hollowed out a great part of the\r\ninside of the hill. However, the outside kept the form which it had at\r\nfirst assumed, and afforded no opportunity to anyone of discovering what\r\nwas being done. Accordingly many Persians mounted it, thinking it safe,\r\nand stationed themselves on the summit with the purpose of shooting down\r\nupon the heads of those inside the fortifications. But with the great\r\nmass of men crowding upon it with a rush, the hill suddenly fell in and\r\nkilled almost all of them. Cabades, then, finding no remedy for the\r\nsituation, decided to raise the siege, and he issued orders to the army\r\nto retreat on the morrow. Then indeed the besieged, as though they had\r\nno thought of their danger, began laughingly from the fortifications to\r\njeer at the barbarians. Besides this some courtesans shamelessly drew up\r\ntheir clothing and displayed to Cabades, who was standing close by,\r\nthose parts of a woman's body which it is not proper that men should see\r\nuncovered. This was plainly seen by the Magi, and they thereupon came\r\nbefore the king and tried to prevent the retreat, declaring as their\r\ninterpretation of what had happened that the citizens of Amida would\r\nshortly disclose to Cabades all their secret and hidden things. So the\r\nPersian army remained there.\r\n\r\nNot many days later one of the Persians saw close by one of the towers\r\nthe mouth of an old underground passage, which was insecurely concealed\r\nwith some few small stones. In the night he came there alone, and,\r\nmaking trial of the entrance, got inside the circuit-wall; then at\r\ndaybreak he reported the whole matter to Cabades. The king himself on\r\nthe following night came to the spot with a few men, bringing ladders\r\nwhich he had made ready. And he was favoured by a piece of good fortune;\r\nfor the defence of the very tower which happened to be nearest to the\r\npassage had fallen by lot to those of the Christians who are most\r\ncareful in their observances, whom they call monks. These men, as chance\r\nwould have it, were keeping some annual religious festival to God on\r\nthat day. When night came on they all felt great weariness[9] on account\r\nof the festival, and, having sated themselves with food and drink beyond\r\ntheir wont, they fell into a sweet and gentle sleep, and were\r\nconsequently quite unaware of what was going on. So the Persians made\r\ntheir way through the passage inside the fortifications, a few at a\r\ntime, and, mounting the tower, they found the monks still sleeping and\r\nslew them to a man. When Cabades learned this, he brought his ladders up\r\nto the wall close by this tower. It was already day. And those of the\r\ntownsmen who were keeping guard on the adjoining tower became aware of\r\nthe disaster, and ran thither with all speed to give assistance. Then\r\nfor a long time both sides struggled to crowd back the other, and\r\nalready the townsmen were gaining the advantage, killing many of those\r\nwho had mounted the wall, and throwing back the men on the ladders, and\r\nthey came very near to averting the danger. But Cabades drew his sword\r\nand, terrifying the Persians constantly with it, rushed in person to the\r\nladders and would not let them draw back, and death was the punishment\r\nfor those who dared turn to leave. As a result of this the Persians by\r\ntheir numbers gained the upper hand and overcame their antagonists in\r\nthe fight. So the city was captured by storm on the eightieth day after\r\nthe beginning of the siege. [Jan. 11, 503 A.D.] There followed a great\r\nmassacre of the townspeople, until one of the citizens--an old man and a\r\npriest--approached Cabades as he was riding into the city, and said that\r\nit was not a kingly act to slaughter captives. Then Cabades, still moved\r\nwith passion, replied: \"But why did you decide to fight against me?\" And\r\nthe old man answered quickly: \"Because God willed to give Amida into thy\r\nhand not so much because of our decision as of thy valour.\" Cabades was\r\npleased by this speech, and permitted no further slaughter, but he bade\r\nthe Persians plunder the property and make slaves of the survivors, and\r\nhe directed them to choose out for himself all the notables among them.\r\n\r\nA short time after this he departed, leaving there to garrison the place\r\na thousand men under command of Glones, a Persian, and some few\r\nunfortunates among the citizens of Amida who were destined to minister\r\nas servants to the daily wants of the Persians; he himself with all the\r\nremainder of the army and the captives marched away homeward. These\r\ncaptives were treated by Cabades with a generosity befitting a king; for\r\nafter a short time he released all of them to return to their homes, but\r\nhe pretended that they had escaped from him by stealth[10]; and the\r\nRoman Emperor, Anastasius, also shewed them honour worthy of their\r\nbravery, for he remitted to the city all the annual taxes for the space\r\nof seven years, and presented all of them as a body and each one of them\r\nseparately with many good things, so that they came fully to forget the\r\nmisfortunes which had befallen them. But this happened in later years.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nAt that time the Emperor Anastasius, upon learning that Amida was being\r\nbesieged, dispatched with all speed an army of sufficient strength. But\r\nin this army there were general officers in command of every\r\nsymmory[11], while the supreme command was divided between the following\r\nfour generals: Areobindus, at that time General of the East, the\r\nson-in-law of Olyvrius, who had been Emperor in the West not long\r\nbefore; Celer, commander of the palace troops (this officer the Romans\r\nare accustomed to call \"magister\"); besides these still, there were the\r\ncommanders of troops in Byzantium, Patricias, the Phrygian, and\r\nHypatius, the nephew of the emperor; these four, then, were the\r\ngenerals. With them also was associated Justinus, who at a later time\r\nbecame emperor upon the death of Anastasius, and Patriciolus with his\r\nson Vitalianus, who raised an armed insurrection against the Emperor\r\nAnastasius not long afterwards and made himself tyrant; also\r\nPharesmanes, a native of Colchis, and a man of exceptional ability as a\r\nwarrior, and the Goths Godidisklus and Bessas, who were among those\r\nGoths who had not followed Theoderic when he went from Thrace into\r\nItaly, both of them men of the noblest birth and experienced in matters\r\npertaining to warfare; many others, too, who were men of high station,\r\njoined this army. For such an army, they say, was never assembled by the\r\nRomans against the Persians either before or after that time. However,\r\nall these men did not assemble in one body, nor did they form a single\r\narmy as they marched, but each commander by himself led his own division\r\nseparately against the enemy. And as manager of the finances of the army\r\nApion, an Aegyptian, was sent, a man of eminence among the patricians\r\nand extremely energetic; and the emperor in a written statement declared\r\nhim partner in the royal power, in order that he might have authority to\r\nadminister the finances as he wished.\r\n\r\nNow this army was mustered with considerable delay, and advanced with\r\nlittle speed. As a result of this they did not find the barbarians in\r\nthe Roman territory; for the Persians had made their attack suddenly,\r\nand had immediately withdrawn with all their booty to their own land.\r\nNow no one of the generals desired for the present to undertake the\r\nsiege of the garrison left in Amida, for they learned that they had\r\ncarried in a large supply of provisions; but they made haste to invade\r\nthe land of the enemy. However they did not advance together against the\r\nbarbarians but they encamped apart from one another as they proceeded.\r\nWhen Cabades learned this (for he happened to be close by), he came with\r\nall speed to the Roman frontier and confronted them. But the Romans had\r\nnot yet learned that Cabades was moving against them with his whole\r\nforce, and they supposed that some small Persian army was there.\r\nAccordingly the forces of Areobindus established their camp in a place\r\ncalled Arzamon, at a distance of two days' journey from the city of\r\nConstantina, and those of Patricius and Hypatius in a place called\r\nSiphrios, which is distant not less than three hundred and fifty stades\r\nfrom the city of Amida. As for Celer, he had not yet arrived.\r\n\r\nAreobindus, when he ascertained that Cabades was coming upon them with\r\nhis whole army, abandoned his camp, and, in company with all his men,\r\nturned to flight and retired on the run to Constantina. And the enemy,\r\ncoming up not long afterwards, captured the camp without a man in it and\r\nall the money it contained. From there they advanced swiftly against the\r\nother Roman army. Now the troops of Patricius and Hypatius had happened\r\nupon eight hundred Ephthalitae who were marching in advance of the\r\nPersian army, and they had killed practically all of them. Then, since\r\nthey had learned nothing of Cabades and the Persian army, supposing that\r\nthey had won the victory, they began to conduct themselves with less\r\ncaution. At any rate they had stacked their arms and were preparing\r\nthemselves a lunch; for already the appropriate time of day was drawing\r\nnear. Now a small stream flowed in this place and in it the Romans began\r\nto wash the pieces of meat which they were about to eat; some, too,\r\ndistressed by the heat, were bathing themselves in the stream; and in\r\nconsequence the brook flowed on with a muddy current. But while Cabades,\r\nlearning what had befallen the Ephthalitae, was advancing against the\r\nenemy with all speed, he noticed that the water of the brook was\r\ndisturbed, and divining what was going on, he came to the conclusion\r\nthat his opponents were unprepared, and gave orders to charge upon them\r\nimmediately at full speed. [Aug., 503 A.D.] Straightway, then, they fell\r\nupon them feasting and unarmed. And the Romans did not withstand their\r\nonset, nor did they once think of resistance, but they began to flee as\r\neach one could; and some of them were captured and slain, while others\r\nclimbed the hill which rises there and threw themselves down the cliff\r\nin panic and much confusion. And they say that not a man escaped from\r\nthere; but Patricius and Hypatius had succeeded in getting away at the\r\nbeginning of the onset. After this Cabades retired homeward with his\r\nwhole army, since hostile Huns had made an invasion into his land, and\r\nwith this people he waged a long war in the northerly portion of his\r\nrealm. In the meantime the other Roman army also came, but they did\r\nnothing worth recounting, because, it seems, no one was made\r\ncommander-in-chief of the expedition; but all the generals were of equal\r\nrank, and consequently they were always opposing one another's opinions\r\nand were utterly unable to unite. However Celer, with his contingent,\r\ncrossed the Nymphius River and made some sort of an invasion into\r\nArzanene. This river is one very close to Martyropolis, about three\r\nhundred stades from Amida. So Celer's troops plundered the country\r\nthereabout and returned not long after, and the whole invasion was\r\ncompleted in a short time.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nAfter this Areobindus went to Byzantium at the summons of the emperor,\r\nwhile the other generals reached Amida, and, in spite of the winter\r\nseason, invested it. And although they made many attempts they were\r\nunable to carry the fortress by storm, but they were on the point of\r\naccomplishing their object by starvation; for all the provisions of the\r\nbesieged were exhausted. The generals, however, had ascertained nothing\r\nof the straits in which the enemy were; but since they saw that their\r\nown troops were distressed by the labour of the siege and the wintry\r\nweather, and at the same time suspected that a Persian army would be\r\ncoming upon them before long, they were eager to quit the place on any\r\nterms whatever. The Persians, on their part, not knowing what would\r\nbecome of them in such terrible straits, continued to conceal\r\nscrupulously their lack of the necessities of life, and made it appear\r\nthat they had an abundance of all provisions, wishing to return to their\r\nhomes with the reputation of honour. So a proposal was discussed between\r\nthem, according to which the Persians were to deliver over the city to\r\nthe Romans upon receipt of one thousand pounds of gold. Both parties\r\nthen gladly executed the terms of the agreement, and the son of Glones,\r\nupon receiving the money, delivered over Amida to the Romans. For Glones\r\nhimself had already died in the following manner.\r\n\r\nWhen the Romans had not yet encamped before the city of Amida but were\r\nnot far from its vicinity, a certain countryman, who was accustomed to\r\nenter the city secretly with fowls and loaves and many other delicacies,\r\nwhich he sold to this Glones at a great price, came before the general\r\nPatricius and promised to deliver into his hands Glones and two hundred\r\nPersians, if he should receive from him assurance of some requital. And\r\nthe general promised that he should have everything he desired, and thus\r\ndismissed the fellow. He then tore his garments in a dreadful manner,\r\nand, assuming the aspect of one who had been weeping, entered the city.\r\nAnd coming before Glones, and tearing his hair he said: \"O Master, I\r\nhappened to be bringing in for you all the good things from my village,\r\nwhen some Roman soldiers chanced upon me (for, as you know, they are\r\nconstantly wandering about the country here in small bands and doing\r\nviolence to the miserable country-folk), and they inflicted upon me\r\nblows not to be endured, and, taking away everything, they\r\ndeparted,--the robbers, whose ancient custom it is to fear the Persians\r\nand to beat the farmers. But do you, O Master, take thought to defend\r\nyourself and us and the Persians. For if you go hunting into the\r\noutskirts of the city, you will find rare game. For the accursed rascals\r\ngo about by fours or fives to do their robbery.\" Thus he spoke. And\r\nGlones was persuaded, and enquired of the fellow about how many Persians\r\nhe thought would be sufficient for him to carry out the enterprise. He\r\nsaid that about fifty would do, for they would never meet more than five\r\nof them going together; however, in order to forestall any unexpected\r\ncircumstance, it would do no harm to take with him even one hundred men;\r\nand if he should double this number it would be still better from every\r\npoint of view; for no harm could come to a man from the larger number.\r\nGlones accordingly picked out two hundred horsemen and bade the fellow\r\nlead the way for them. But he insisted that it was better for him to be\r\nsent first to spy out the ground, and, if he should bring back word that\r\nhe had seen Romans still going about in the same districts, that then\r\nthe Persians should make their sally at the fitting moment. Accordingly,\r\nsince he seemed to Glones to speak well, he was sent forward by his own\r\norder. Then he came before the general Patricius and explained\r\neverything; and the general sent with him two of his own body-guard and\r\na thousand soldiers. These he concealed about a village called\r\nThilasamon, forty stades distant from Amida, among valleys and woody\r\nplaces, and instructed them to remain there in this ambush; he himself\r\nthen proceeded to the city on the run, and telling Glones that the prey\r\nwas ready, he led him and the two hundred horsemen upon the ambush of\r\nthe enemy. And when they passed the spot where the Romans were lying in\r\nwait, without being observed by Glones or any of the Persians, he roused\r\nthe Romans from their ambuscade and pointed out to them the enemy. And\r\nwhen the Persians saw the men coming against them, they were astounded\r\nat the suddenness of the thing, and were in much distress what to do.\r\nFor neither could they retire to the rear, since their opponents were\r\nbehind them, nor were they able to flee anywhere else in a hostile land.\r\nBut as well as they could under the circumstances, they arrayed\r\nthemselves for battle and tried to drive back their assailants; but\r\nbeing at a great disadvantage in numbers they were vanquished, and all\r\nof them together with Glones were destroyed. Now when the son of Glones\r\nlearned of this, being deeply grieved and at the same time furious with\r\nanger because he had not been able to defend his father, he fired the\r\nsanctuary of Symeon, a holy man, where Glones had his lodging. It must\r\nbe said, however, that with the exception of this one building, neither\r\nGlones nor Cabades, nor indeed any other of the Persians, saw fit either\r\nto tear down or to destroy in any other way any building in Amida at any\r\nrate, or outside this city. But I shall return to the previous\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\n[504 A.D.] Thus the Romans by giving the money recovered Amida two years\r\nafter it had been captured by the enemy. And when they got into the\r\ncity, their own negligence and the hardships under which the Persians\r\nhad maintained themselves were discovered. For upon reckoning the amount\r\nof grain left there and the number of barbarians who had gone out, they\r\nfound that rations for about seven days were left in the city, although\r\nGlones and his son had been for a long time doling out provisions to the\r\nPersians more sparingly than they were needed. For to the Romans who had\r\nremained with them in the city, as I have stated above, they had decided\r\nto dispense nothing at all from the time when their enemy began the\r\nsiege; and so these men at first resorted to unaccustomed foods and laid\r\nhold on every forbidden thing, and at the last they even tasted each\r\nother's blood. So the generals realized that they had been deceived by\r\nthe barbarians, and they reproached the soldiers for their lack of\r\nself-control, because they had shewn themselves wanting in obedience to\r\nthem, when it was possible to capture as prisoners of war such a\r\nmultitude of Persians and the son of Glones and the city itself, while\r\nthey had in consequence attached to themselves signal disgrace by\r\ncarrying Roman money to the enemy, and had taken Amida from the Persians\r\nby purchasing it with silver. [506 A.D.] After this the Persians, since\r\ntheir war with the Huns kept dragging on, entered into a treaty with the\r\nRomans, which was arranged by them for seven years, and was made by the\r\nRoman Celer and the Persian Aspebedes; both armies then retired homeward\r\nand remained at peace. Thus, then, as has been told, began the war of\r\nthe Romans and the Persians, and to this end did it come. But I shall\r\nnow turn to the narration of the events touching the Caspian Gates.\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nThe Taurus mountain range of Cilicia passes first Cappadocia and Armenia\r\nand the land of the so-called Persarmenians, then also Albania and\r\nIberia and all the other countries in this region, both independent and\r\nsubject to Persia. For it extends to a great distance, and as one\r\nproceeds along this range, it always spreads out to an extraordinary\r\nbreadth and rises to an imposing height. And as one passes beyond the\r\nboundary of Iberia there is a sort of path in a very narrow passage,\r\nextending for a distance of fifty stades. This path terminates in a\r\nplace cut off by cliffs and, as it seems, absolutely impossible to pass\r\nthrough. For from there no way out appears, except indeed a small gate\r\nset there by nature, just as if it had been made by the hand of man,\r\nwhich has been called from of old the Caspian Gates. From there on there\r\nare plains suitable for riding and extremely well watered, and extensive\r\ntracts used as pasture land for horses, and level besides. Here almost\r\nall the nations of the Huns are settled, extending as far as the Maeotic\r\nlake. Now if these Huns go through the gate which I have just mentioned\r\ninto the land of the Persians and the Romans, they come with their\r\nhorses fresh and without making any detour or encountering any\r\nprecipitous places, except in those fifty stades over which, as has been\r\nsaid, they pass to the boundary of Iberia. If, however, they go by any\r\nother passes, they reach their destination with great difficulty, and\r\ncan no longer use the same horses. For the detours which they are forced\r\nto make are many and steep besides. When this was observed by Alexander,\r\nthe son of Philip, he constructed gates in the aforesaid place and\r\nestablished a fortress there. And this was held by many men in turn as\r\ntime went on, and finally by Ambazouces, a Hun by birth, but a friend of\r\nthe Romans and the Emperor Anastasius. Now when this Ambazouces had\r\nreached an advanced age and was near to death, he sent to Anastasius\r\nasking that money be given him, on condition that he hand over the\r\nfortress and the Caspian Gates to the Romans. But the Emperor Anastasius\r\nwas incapable of doing anything without careful investigation, nor was\r\nit his custom to act thus: reasoning, therefore, that it was impossible\r\nfor him to support soldiers in a place which was destitute of all good\r\nthings, and which had nowhere in the neighbourhood a nation subject to\r\nthe Romans, he expressed deep gratitude to the man for his good-will\r\ntoward him, but by no means accepted this proposition. So Ambazouces\r\ndied of disease not long afterwards, and Cabades overpowered his sons\r\nand took possession of the Gates.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Anastasius, after concluding the treaty with Cabades, built\r\na city in a place called Daras, exceedingly strong and of real\r\nimportance, bearing the name of the emperor himself. Now this place is\r\ndistant from the city of Nisibis one hundred stades lacking two, and\r\nfrom the boundary line which divides the Romans from the Persians about\r\ntwenty-eight. And the Persians, though eager to prevent the building,\r\nwere quite unable to do so, being constrained by the war with the Huns\r\nin which they were engaged. But as soon as Cabades brought this to an\r\nend, he sent to the Romans and accused them of having built a city hard\r\nby the Persian frontier, though this had been forbidden in the agreement\r\npreviously made between the Medes and the Romans[12]. At that time,\r\ntherefore, the Emperor Anastasius desired, partly by threats, and partly\r\nby emphasizing his friendship with him and by bribing him with no mean\r\nsum of money, to deceive him and to remove the accusation. And another\r\ncity also was built by this emperor, similar to the first, in Armenia,\r\nhard by the boundaries of Persarmenia; now in this place there had been\r\na village from of old, but it had taken on the dignity of a city by the\r\nfavour of the Emperor Theodosius even to the name, for it had come to be\r\nnamed after him[13]. But Anastasius surrounded it with a very\r\nsubstantial wall, and thus gave offence to the Persians no less than by\r\nthe other city; for both of them are strongholds menacing their country.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n[Aug. 1, 518 A.D.] And when a little later Anastasius died, Justinus\r\nreceived the empire, forcing aside all the kinsmen of Anastasius,\r\nalthough they were numerous and also very distinguished. Then indeed a\r\nsort of anxiety came over Cabades, lest the Persians should make some\r\nattempt to overthrow his house as soon as he should end his life; for it\r\nwas certain that he would not pass on the kingdom to any one of his sons\r\nwithout opposition. For while the law called to the throne the eldest of\r\nhis children Caoses by reason of his age, he was by no means pleasing to\r\nCabades; and the father's judgment did violence to the law of nature and\r\nof custom as well. And Zames, who was second in age, having had one of\r\nhis eyes struck out, was prevented by the law. For it is not lawful for\r\na one-eyed man or one having any other deformity to become king over the\r\nPersians. But Chosroes, who was born to him by the sister of Aspebedes,\r\nthe father loved exceedingly; seeing, however, that all the Persians,\r\npractically speaking, felt an extravagant admiration for the manliness\r\nof Zames (for he was a capable warrior), and worshipped his other\r\nvirtues, he feared lest they should rise against Chosroes and do\r\nirreparable harm to the family and to the kingdom. Therefore it seemed\r\nbest to him to arrange with the Romans to put an end both to the war and\r\nthe causes of war, on condition that Chosroes be made an adopted son of\r\nthe Emperor Justinus; for only in this way could he preserve stability\r\nin the government. Accordingly he sent envoys to treat of this matter\r\nand a letter to the Emperor Justinus in Byzantium. And the letter was\r\nwritten in this wise: \"Unjust indeed has been the treatment which we\r\nhave received at the hands of the Romans, as even you yourself know, but\r\nI have seen fit to abandon entirely all the charges against you, being\r\nassured of this, that the most truly victorious of all men would be\r\nthose who, with justice on their side, are still willingly overcome and\r\nvanquished by their friends. However I ask of you a certain favour in\r\nreturn for this, which would bind together in kinship and in the\r\ngood-will which would naturally spring from this relation not only\r\nourselves but also all our subjects, and which would be calculated to\r\nbring us to a satiety of the blessings of peace. My proposal, then, is\r\nthis, that you should make my son Chosroes, who will be my successor to\r\nthe throne, your adopted son.\"\r\n\r\nWhen this message was brought to the Emperor Justinus, he himself was\r\noverjoyed and Justinian also, the nephew of the emperor, who indeed was\r\nexpected to receive from him the empire. And they were making all haste\r\nto perform the act of setting down in Writing the adoption, as the law\r\nof the Romans prescribes--and would have done so, had they not been\r\nprevented by Proclus, who was at that time a counsellor to the emperor,\r\nholding the office of quaestor, as it is called, a just man and one whom\r\nit was manifestly impossible to bribe; for this reason he neither\r\nreadily proposed any law, nor was he willing to disturb in any way the\r\nsettled order of things; and he at that time also opposed the\r\nproposition, speaking as follows: \"To venture on novel projects is not\r\nmy custom, and indeed I dread them more than any others; for where there\r\nis innovation security is by no means preserved. And it seems to me\r\nthat, even if one should be especially bold in this matter, he would\r\nfeel reluctance to do the thing and would tremble at the storm which\r\nwould arise from it; for I believe that nothing else is before our\r\nconsideration at the present time than the question how we may hand over\r\nthe Roman empire to the Persians on a seemly pretext. For they make no\r\nconcealment nor do they employ any blinds, but explicitly acknowledging\r\ntheir purpose they claim without more ado to rob us of our empire,\r\nseeking to veil the manifestness of their deceit under a shew of\r\nsimplicity, and hide a shameless intent behind a pretended unconcern.\r\nAnd yet both of you ought to repel this attempt of the barbarians with\r\nall your power; thou, O Emperor, in order that thou mayst not be the\r\nlast Emperor of the Romans, and thou, O General, that thou mayst not\r\nprove a stumbling block to thyself as regards coming to the throne. For\r\nother crafty devices which are commonly concealed by a pretentious shew\r\nof words might perhaps need an interpreter for the many, but this\r\nembassy openly and straight from the very first words means to make this\r\nChosroes, whoever he is, the adopted heir of the Roman Emperor. For I\r\nwould have you reason thus in this matter: by nature the possessions of\r\nfathers are due to their sons and while the laws among all men are\r\nalways in conflict with each other by reason of their varying nature, in\r\nthis matter both among the Romans and among all barbarians they are in\r\nagreement and harmony with each other, in that they declare sons to be\r\nmasters of their fathers' inheritance. Take this first resolve if you\r\nchoose: if you do you must agree to all its consequences.\"\r\n\r\nThus spoke Proclus; and the emperor and his nephew gave ear to his words\r\nand deliberated upon what should be done. In the meantime Cabades sent\r\nanother letter also to the Emperor Justinus, asking him to send men of\r\nrepute in order to establish peace with him, and to indicate by letter\r\nthe manner in which it would be his desire to accomplish the adoption of\r\nhis son. And then, indeed, still more than before Proclus decried the\r\nattempt of the Persians, and insisted that their concern was to make\r\nover to themselves as securely as possible the Roman power. And he\r\nproposed as his opinion that the peace should be concluded with them\r\nwith all possible speed, and that the noblest men should be sent by the\r\nemperor for this purpose; and that these men must answer plainly to\r\nCabades, when he enquired in what manner the adoption of Chosroes should\r\nbe accomplished, that it must be of the sort befitting a barbarian, and\r\nhis meaning was that the barbarians adopt sons, not by a document, but\r\nby arms and armour[14]. Accordingly the Emperor Justinus dismissed the\r\nenvoys, promising that men who were the noblest of the Romans would\r\nfollow them not long afterwards, and that they would arrange a\r\nsettlement regarding the peace and regarding Chosroes in the best\r\npossible way. He also answered Cabades by letter to the same effect.\r\nAccordingly there were sent from the Romans Hypatius, the nephew of\r\nAnastasius, the late emperor, a patrician who also held the office of\r\nGeneral of the East, and Rufinus, the son of Silvanus, a man of note\r\namong the patricians and known to Cabades through their fathers; from\r\nthe Persians came one of great power and high authority, Seoses by name,\r\nwhose title was adrastadaran salanes, and Mebodes, who held the office\r\nof magister. These men came together at a certain spot which is on the\r\nboundary line between the land of the Romans and the Persians: there\r\nthey met and negotiated as to how they should do away with their\r\ndifferences and settle effectually the question of the peace. Chosroes\r\nalso came to the Tigris River, which is distant from the city of Nisibis\r\nabout two days journey, in order that, when the details of the peace\r\nshould seem to both parties to be as well arranged as possible, he might\r\nbetake himself in person to Byzantium. Now many words were spoken on\r\nboth sides touching the differences between them, and in particular\r\nSeoses made mention of the land of Colchis, which is now called Lazica,\r\nsaying that it had been subject to the Persians from of old and that the\r\nRomans had taken it from them by violence and held it on no just\r\ngrounds. When the Romans heard this, they were indignant to think that\r\neven Lazica should be disputed by the Persians. And when they in turn\r\nstated that the adoption of Chosroes must take place just as is proper\r\nfor a barbarian, it seemed to the Persians unbearable. The two parties\r\ntherefore separated and departed homeward, and Chosroes with nothing\r\naccomplished was off to his father, deeply injured at what had taken\r\nplace and vowing vengeance on the Romans for their insult to him.\r\n\r\nAfter this Mebodes began to slander Seoses to Cabades, saying that he\r\nhad proposed the discussion of Lazica purposely, although he had not\r\nbeen instructed to do so by his master, thereby frustrating the peace,\r\nand also that he had had words previously with Hypatius, who was by no\r\nmeans well-disposed toward his own sovereign and was trying to prevent\r\nthe conclusion of peace and the adoption of Chosroes; and many other\r\naccusations also were brought forward by the enemies of Seoses, and he\r\nwas summoned to trial. Now the whole Persian council gathered to sit in\r\njudgment moved more by envy than by respect for the law. For they were\r\nthoroughly hostile to his office, which was unfamiliar to them, and also\r\nwere embittered by the natural temper of the man. For while Seoses was a\r\nman quite impossible to bribe, and a most exact respecter of justice, he\r\nwas afflicted with a degree of arrogance not to be compared with that of\r\nany other. This quality, indeed, seems to be inbred in the Persian\r\nofficials, but in Seoses even they thought that the malady had developed\r\nto an altogether extraordinary degree. So his accusers said all those\r\nthings which have been indicated above, and added to this that the man\r\nwas by no means willing to live in the established fashion or to uphold\r\nthe institutions of the Persians. For he both reverenced strange\r\ndivinities, and lately, when his wife had died, he had buried her,\r\nthough it was forbidden by the laws of the Persians ever to hide in the\r\nearth the bodies of the dead. The judges therefore condemned the man to\r\ndeath, while Cabades, though seeming to be deeply moved with sympathy as\r\na friend of Seoses, was by no means willing to rescue him. He did not,\r\non the other hand, make it known that he was angry with him, but, as he\r\nsaid, he was not willing to undo the laws of the Persians, although he\r\nowed the man the price of his life, since Seoses was chiefly responsible\r\nboth for the fact that he was alive and also that he was king. Thus,\r\nthen, Seoses was condemned and was removed from among men. And the\r\noffice which began with him ended also with him. For no other man has\r\nbeen made adrastadaran salanes. Rufinus also slandered Hypatius to the\r\nemperor. As a result of this the emperor reduced him from his office,\r\nand tortured most cruelly certain of his associates only to find out\r\nthat this slander was absolutely unsound; beyond this, however, he did\r\nHypatius no harm.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nImmediately after this, Cabades, though eager to make some kind of an\r\ninvasion into the land of the Romans, was utterly unable to do so on\r\naccount of the following obstacle which happened to arise. The Iberians,\r\nwho live in Asia, are settled in the immediate neighbourhood of the\r\nCaspian Gates, which lie to the north of them. Adjoining them on the\r\nleft towards the west is Lazica, and on the right towards the east are\r\nthe Persian peoples. This nation is Christian and they guard the rites\r\nof this faith more closely than any other men known to us, but they have\r\nbeen subjects of the Persian king, as it happens, from ancient times.\r\nAnd just then Cabades was desirous of forcing them to adopt the rites of\r\nhis own religion. And he enjoined upon their king, Gourgenes, to do all\r\nthings as the Persians are accustomed to do them, and in particular not\r\nunder any circumstances to hide their dead in the earth, but to throw\r\nthem all to the birds and dogs. For this reason, then, Gourgenes wished\r\nto go over to the Emperor Justinus, and he asked that he might receive\r\npledges that the Romans would never abandon the Iberians to the\r\nPersians. And the emperor gave him these pledges with great eagerness,\r\nand he sent Probus, the nephew of the late emperor Anastasius, a man of\r\npatrician rank, with a great sum of money to Bosporus, that he might win\r\nover with money an army of Huns and send them as allies to the Iberians.\r\nThis Bosporus is a city by the sea, on the left as one sails into the\r\nso-called Euxine Sea, twenty days journey distant from the city of\r\nCherson, which is the limit of the Roman territory. Between these cities\r\neverything is held by the Huns. Now in ancient times the people of\r\nBosporus were autonomous, but lately they had decided to become subject\r\nto the Emperor Justinus. Probus, however, departed from there without\r\naccomplishing his mission, and the emperor sent Peter as general with\r\nsome Huns to Lazica to fight with all their strength for Gourgenes.\r\nMeanwhile Cabades sent a very considerable army against Gourgenes and\r\nthe Iberians, and as general a Persian bearing the title of \"varizes,\"\r\nBoes by name. Then it was seen that Gourgenes was too weak to withstand\r\nthe attack of the Persians, for the help from the Romans was\r\ninsufficient, and with all the notables of the Iberians he fled to\r\nLazica, taking with him his wife and children and also his brothers, of\r\nwhom Peranius was the eldest. And when they had reached the boundaries\r\nof Lazica, they remained there, and, sheltering themselves by the\r\nroughness of the country, they took their stand against the enemy. And\r\nthe Persians followed after them but did nothing deserving even of\r\nmention since the circumstance of the rough country was against them.\r\n\r\nThereafter the Iberians presented themselves at Byzantium and Petrus\r\ncame to the emperor at his summons; and from then on the emperor\r\ndemanded that he should assist the Lazi to guard their country, even\r\nagainst their will, and he sent an army and Eirenaeus in command of it.\r\nNow there are two fortresses in Lazica[15] which one comes upon\r\nimmediately upon entering their country from the boundaries of Iberia,\r\nand the defence of them had been from of old in charge of the natives,\r\nalthough they experienced great hardship in this matter; for neither\r\ncorn nor wine nor any other good thing is produced there. Nor indeed can\r\nanything be carried in from elsewhere on account of the narrowness of\r\nthe paths, unless it be carried by men. However, the Lazi were able to\r\nlive on a certain kind of millet which grows there, since they were\r\naccustomed to it. These garrisons the emperor removed from the place and\r\ncommanded that Roman soldiers should be stationed there to guard the\r\nfortresses. And at first the Lazi with difficulty brought in provisions\r\nfor these soldiers, but later they gave up the service and the Romans\r\nabandoned these forts, whereupon the Persians with no trouble took\r\npossession of them. This then happened in Lazica.\r\n\r\nAnd the Romans, under the leadership of Sittas and Belisarius, made an\r\ninroad into Persarmenia, a territory subject to the Persians, where they\r\nplundered a large tract of country and then withdrew with a great\r\nmultitude of Armenian captives. These two men were both youths and\r\nwearing their first beards[16], body-guards of the general Justinian,\r\nwho later shared the empire with his uncle Justinus. But when a second\r\ninroad had been made by the Romans into Armenia, Narses and Aratius\r\nunexpectedly confronted them and engaged them in battle. These men not\r\nlong after this came to the Romans as deserters, and made the expedition\r\nto Italy with Belisarius; but on the present occasion they joined battle\r\nwith the forces of Sittas and Belisarius and gained the advantage over\r\nthem. An invasion was also made near the city of Nisibis by another\r\nRoman army under command of Libelarius of Thrace. This army retired\r\nabruptly in flight although no one came out against thorn. And because\r\nof this the emperor reduced Libelarius from his office and appointed\r\nBelisarius commander of the troops in Daras. It was at that time that\r\nProcopius, who wrote this history, was chosen as his adviser. [527 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\n[Apr. 1, 527] Not long after this Justinus, who had declared his nephew\r\nJustinian emperor with him, died, and thus the empire came to Justinian\r\nalone. [Aug. 1, 527] This Justinian commanded Belisarius to build a\r\nfortress in a place called Mindouos, which is over against the very\r\nboundary of Persia, on the left as one goes to Nisibis. He accordingly\r\nwith great haste began to carry out the decision of the emperor, and the\r\nfort was already rising to a considerable height by reason of the great\r\nnumber of artisans. But the Persians forbade them to build any further,\r\nthreatening that, not with words alone but also with deeds, they would\r\nat no distant time obstruct the work. When the emperor heard this,\r\ninasmuch as Belisarius was not able to beat off the Persians from the\r\nplace with the army he had, he ordered another army to go thither, and\r\nalso Coutzes and Bouzes, who at that time commanded the soldiers in\r\nLibanus[17]. These two were brothers from Thrace, both young and\r\ninclined to be rash in engaging with the enemy. So both armies were\r\ngathered together and came in full force to the scene of the building\r\noperations, the Persians in order to hinder the work with all their\r\npower, and the Romans to defend the labourers. And a fierce battle took\r\nplace in which the Romans were defeated, and there was a great slaughter\r\nof them, while some also were made captive by the enemy. Among these was\r\nCoutzes himself. All these captives the Persians led away to their own\r\ncountry, and, putting them in chains, confined them permanently in a\r\ncave; as for the fort, since no one defended it any longer, they razed\r\nwhat had been built to the ground.\r\n\r\nAfter this the Emperor Justinian appointed Belisarius General of the\r\nEast and bade him make an expedition against the Persians. And he\r\ncollected a very formidable army and came to Daras. Hermogenes also came\r\nto him from the emperor to assist in setting the army in order, holding\r\nthe office of magister; this man was formerly counsellor to Vitalianus\r\nat the time when he was at war with the Emperor Anastasius. The emperor\r\nalso sent Rufinus as ambassador, commanding him to remain in Hierapolis\r\non the Euphrates River until he himself should give the word. For\r\nalready much was being said on both sides concerning peace. Suddenly,\r\nhowever, someone reported to Belisarius and Hermogenes that the Persians\r\nwere expected to invade the land of the Romans, being eager to capture\r\nthe city of Daras. And when they heard this, they prepared for the\r\nbattle as follows. [July, 530] Not far from the gate which lies opposite\r\nthe city of Nisibis, about a stone's throw away, they dug a deep trench\r\nwith many passages across it. Now this trench was not dug in a straight\r\nline, but in the following manner. In the middle there was a rather\r\nshort portion straight, and at either end of this there were dug two\r\ncross trenches at right angles to the first; and starting from the\r\nextremities of the two cross trenches, they continued two straight\r\ntrenches in the original direction to a very great distance. Not long\r\nafterwards the Persians came with a great army, and all of them made\r\ncamp in a place called Ammodios, at a distance of twenty stades from the\r\ncity of Daras. Among the leaders of this army were Pityaxes and the\r\none-eyed Baresmanas. But one general held command over them all, a\r\nPersian, whose title was \"mirranes\" (for thus the Persians designate\r\nthis office), Perozes by name. This Perozes immediately sent to\r\nBelisarius bidding him make ready the bath: for he wished to bathe there\r\non the following day. Accordingly the Romans made the most vigorous\r\npreparations for the encounter, with the expectation that they would\r\nfight on the succeeding day.\r\n\r\nAt sunrise, seeing the enemy advancing against them, they arrayed\r\nthemselves as follows[18]. The extremity of the left straight trench\r\nwhich joined the cross trench, as far as the hill which rises here, was\r\nheld by Bouzes with a large force of horsemen and by Pharas the Erulian\r\nwith three hundred of his nation. On the right of these, outside the\r\ntrench, at the angle formed by the cross trench and the straight section\r\nwhich extended from that point, were Sunicas and Aigan, Massagetae by\r\nbirth, with six hundred horsemen, in order that, if those under Bouzes\r\nand Pharas should be driven back, they might, by moving quickly on the\r\nflank, and getting in the rear of the enemy, be able easily to support\r\nthe Romans at that point. On the other wing also they were arrayed in\r\nthe same manner; for the extremity of the straight trench was held by a\r\nlarge force of horsemen, who were commanded by John, son of Nicetas, and\r\nby Cyril and Marcellus; with them also were Germanus and Dorotheus;\r\nwhile at the angle on the right six hundred horsemen took their stand,\r\ncommanded by Simmas and Ascan, Massagetae, in order that, as has been\r\nsaid, in case the forces of John should by any chance be driven back,\r\nthey might move out from there and attack the rear of the Persians. Thus\r\nall along the trench stood the detachments of cavalry and the infantry.\r\nAnd behind these in the middle stood the forces of Belisarius and\r\nHermogenes. Thus the Romans arrayed themselves, amounting to\r\nfive-and-twenty thousand; but the Persian army consisted of forty\r\nthousand horse and foot, and they all stood close together facing the\r\nfront, so as to make the front of the phalanx as deep as possible. Then\r\nfor a long time neither side began battle with the other, but the\r\nPersians seemed to be wondering at the good order of the Romans, and\r\nappeared at a loss what to do under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn the late afternoon a certain detachment of the horsemen who held the\r\nright wing, separating themselves from the rest of the army, came\r\nagainst the forces of Bouzes and Pharas. And the Romans retired a short\r\ndistance to the rear. The Persians, however, did not pursue them, but\r\nremained there, fearing, I suppose, some move to surround them on the\r\npart of the enemy. Then the Romans who had turned to flight suddenly\r\nrushed upon them. And the Persians did not withstand their onset and\r\nrode back to the phalanx, and again the forces of Bouzes and Pharas\r\nstationed themselves in their own position. In this skirmish seven of\r\nthe Persians fell, and the Romans gained possession of their bodies;\r\nthereafter both armies remained quietly in position. But one Persian, a\r\nyoung man, riding up very close to the Roman army, began to challenge\r\nall of them, calling for whoever wished to do battle with him. And no\r\none of the whole army dared face the danger, except a certain Andreas,\r\none of the personal attendants of Bouzes, not a soldier nor one who had\r\never practised at all the business of war, but a trainer of youths in\r\ncharge of a certain wrestling school in Byzantium. Through this it came\r\nabout that he was following the army, for he cared for the person of\r\nBouzes in the bath; his birthplace was Byzantium. This man alone had the\r\ncourage, without being ordered by Bouzes or anyone else, to go out of\r\nhis own accord to meet the man in single combat. And he caught the\r\nbarbarian while still considering how he should deliver his attack, and\r\nhit him with his spear on the right breast. And the Persian did not bear\r\nthe blow delivered by a man of such exceptional strength, and fell from\r\nhis horse to the earth. Then Andreas with a small knife slew him like a\r\nsacrificial animal as he lay on his back, and a mighty shout was raised\r\nboth from the city wall and from the Roman army. But the Persians were\r\ndeeply vexed at the outcome and sent forth another horseman for the same\r\npurpose, a manly fellow and well favoured as to bodily size, but not a\r\nyouth, for some of the hair on his head already shewed grey. This\r\nhorseman came up along the hostile army, and, brandishing vehemently the\r\nwhip with which he was accustomed to strike his horse, he summoned to\r\nbattle whoever among the Romans was willing. And when no one went out\r\nagainst him, Andreas, without attracting the notice of anyone, once more\r\ncame forth, although he had been forbidden to do so by Hermogenes. So\r\nboth rushed madly upon each other with their spears, and the weapons,\r\ndriven against their corselets, were turned aside with mighty force, and\r\nthe horses, striking together their heads, fell themselves and threw off\r\ntheir riders. And both the two men, falling very close to each other,\r\nmade great haste to rise to their feet, but the Persian was not able to\r\ndo this easily because his size was against him, while Andreas,\r\nanticipating him (for his practice in the wrestling school gave him this\r\nadvantage), smote him as he was rising on his knee, and as he fell again\r\nto the ground dispatched him. Then a roar went up from the wall and from\r\nthe Roman army as great, if not greater, than before; and the Persians\r\nbroke their phalanx and withdrew to Ammodios, while the Romans, raising\r\nthe pæan, went inside the fortifications; for already it was growing\r\ndark. Thus both armies passed that night.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nOn the following day ten thousand soldiers arrived who had been summoned\r\nby the Persians from the city of Nisibis, and Belisarius and Hermogenes\r\nwrote to the mirranes as follows: \"The first blessing is peace, as is\r\nagreed by all men who have even a small share of reason. It follows that\r\nif any one should be a destroyer of it, he would be most responsible not\r\nonly to those near him but also to his whole nation for the troubles\r\nwhich come. The best general, therefore, is that one who is able to\r\nbring about peace from war. But you, when affairs were well settled\r\nbetween the Romans and the Persians, have seen fit to bring upon us a\r\nwar without cause, although the counsels of each king are looking toward\r\npeace, and although our envoys are already present in the neighbourhood,\r\nwho will at no distant time settle all the points of dispute in talking\r\nover the situation together, unless some irreparable harm coming from\r\nyour invasion proves sufficient to frustrate for us this hope. But lead\r\naway as soon as possible your army to the land of the Persians, and do\r\nnot stand in the way of the greatest blessings, lest at some time you be\r\nheld responsible by the Persians, as is probable, for the disasters\r\nwhich will come to pass.\" When the mirranes saw this letter brought to\r\nhim, he replied as follows: \"I should have been persuaded by what you\r\nwrite, and should have done what you demand, were the letter not, as it\r\nhappens, from Romans, for whom the making of promises is easy, but the\r\nfulfilment of the promises in deed most difficult and beyond hope,\r\nespecially if you sanction the agreement by any oaths. We, therefore,\r\ndespairing in view of your deception, have been compelled to come before\r\nyou in arms, and as for you, my dear Romans, consider that from now on\r\nyou will be obliged to do nothing else than make war against the\r\nPersians. For here we shall be compelled either to die or grow old until\r\nyou accord to us justice in deed.\" Such was the reply which the mirranes\r\nwrote back. And again Belisarius and his generals wrote as follows: \"O\r\nexcellent mirranes, it is not fitting in all things to depend upon\r\nboasting, nor to lay upon one's neighbours reproaches which are\r\njustified on no grounds whatever. For we said with truth that Rufinus\r\nhad come to act as an envoy and was not far away, and you yourself will\r\nknow this at no remote time. But since you are eager for deeds of war,\r\nwe shall array ourselves against you with the help of God, who will, we\r\nknow, support us in the danger, being moved by the peaceful inclination\r\nof the Romans, but rebuking the boastfulness of the Persians and your\r\ndecision to resist us when we invite you to peace. And we shall array\r\nourselves against you, having prepared for the conflict by fastening the\r\nletters written by each of us on the top of our banners.\" Such was the\r\nmessage of this letter. And the mirranes again answered as follows:\r\n\"Neither are we entering upon the war without our gods, and with their\r\nhelp we shall come before you, and I expect that on the morrow they will\r\nbring the Persians into Daras. But let the bath and lunch be in\r\nreadiness for me within the fortifications.\" When Belisarius and his\r\ngenerals read this, they prepared themselves for the conflict.\r\n\r\nOn the succeeding day the mirranes called together all the Persians at\r\nabout sunrise and spoke as follows: \"I am not ignorant that it is not\r\nbecause of words of their leaders, but because of their individual\r\nbravery and their shame before each other that the Persians are\r\naccustomed to be courageous in the presence of dangers. But seeing you\r\nconsidering why in the world it is that, although the Romans have not\r\nbeen accustomed heretofore to go into battle without confusion and\r\ndisorder, they recently awaited the advancing Persians with a kind of\r\norder which is by no means characteristic of them, for this reason I\r\nhave decided to speak some words of exhortation to you, so that it may\r\nnot come about that you be deceived by reason of holding an opinion\r\nwhich is not true. For I would not have you think that the Romans have\r\nsuddenly become better warriors, or that they have acquired any more\r\nvalour or experience, but that they have become more cowardly than they\r\nwere previously; at any rate they fear the Persians so much that they\r\nhave not even dared to form their phalanx without a trench. And not even\r\nwith this did they begin any fighting, but when we did not join battle\r\nwith them at all, joyfully and considering that matters had gone better\r\nfor them than they had hoped, they withdrew to the wall. For this reason\r\ntoo it happened that they were not thrown into confusion, for they had\r\nnot yet come into the dangers of battle. But if the fighting comes to\r\nclose quarters, fear will seize upon them, and this, together with their\r\ninexperience, will throw them, in all probability, into their customary\r\ndisorder. Such, therefore, is the case with regard to the enemy; but do\r\nyou, O men of Persia, call to mind the judgment of the King of Kings.\r\nFor if you do not play the part of brave men in the present engagement,\r\nin a manner worthy of the valour of the Persians, an inglorious\r\npunishment will fall upon you.\" With this exhortation the mirranes began\r\nto lead his army against the enemy. Likewise Belisarius and Hermogenes\r\ngathered all the Romans before the fortifications, and encouraged them\r\nwith the following words: \"You know assuredly that the Persians are not\r\naltogether invincible, nor too strong to be killed, having taken their\r\nmeasure in the previous battle; and that, although superior to them in\r\nbravery and in strength of body, you were defeated only by reason of\r\nbeing rather heedless of your officers, no one can deny. This thing you\r\nnow have the opportunity to set right with no trouble. For while the\r\nadversities of fortune are by no means such as to be set right by an\r\neffort, reason may easily become for a man a physician for the ills\r\ncaused by himself. If therefore you are willing to give heed to the\r\norders given, you will straightway win for yourselves the superiority in\r\nbattle. For the Persians come against us basing their confidence on\r\nnothing else than our disorder. But this time also they will be\r\ndisappointed in this hope, and will depart just as in the previous\r\nencounter. And as for the great numbers of the enemy, by which more than\r\nanything else they inspire fear, it is right for you to despise them.\r\nFor their whole infantry is nothing more than a crowd of pitiable\r\npeasants who come into battle for no other purpose than to dig through\r\nwalls and to despoil the slain and in general to serve the soldiers. For\r\nthis reason they have no weapons at all with which they might trouble\r\ntheir opponents, and they only hold before themselves those enormous\r\nshields in order that they may not possibly be hit by the enemy.\r\nTherefore if you shew yourselves brave men in this struggle, you will\r\nnot only conquer the Persians for the present, but you will also punish\r\nthem for their folly, so that they will never again make an expedition\r\ninto the Roman territory.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Belisarius and Hermogenes had finished this exhortation, since they\r\nsaw the Persians advancing against them, they hastily drew up the\r\nsoldiers in the same manner as before. And the barbarians, coming up\r\nbefore them, took their stand facing the Romans. But the mirranes did\r\nnot array all the Persians against the enemy, but only one half of them,\r\nwhile he allowed the others to remain behind. These were to take the\r\nplaces of the men who were fighting and to fall upon their opponents\r\nwith their vigour intact, so that all might fight in constant rotation.\r\nBut the detachment of the so-called Immortals alone he ordered to remain\r\nat rest until he himself should give the signal. And he took his own\r\nstation at the middle of the front, putting Pityaxes in command on the\r\nright wing, and Baresmanas on the left. In this manner, then, both\r\narmies were drawn up. Then Pharas came before Belisarius and Hermogenes,\r\nand said: \"It does not seem to me that I shall do the enemy any great\r\nharm if I remain here with the Eruli; but if we conceal ourselves on\r\nthis slope, and then, when the Persians have begun the fight, if we\r\nclimb up by this hill and suddenly come upon their rear, shooting from\r\nbehind them, we shall in all probability do them the greatest harm.\"\r\nThus he spoke, and, since it pleased Belisarius and his staff, he\r\ncarried out this plan.\r\n\r\nBut up to midday neither side began battle. As soon, however, as the\r\nnoon hour was passed, the barbarians began the fight, having postponed\r\nthe engagement to this time of the day for the reason that they are\r\naccustomed to partake of food only towards late afternoon, while the\r\nRomans have their meal before noon; and for this reason they thought\r\nthat the Romans would never hold out so well, if they assailed them\r\nwhile hungry. At first, then, both sides discharged arrows against each\r\nother, and the missiles by their great number made, as it were, a vast\r\ncloud; and many men were falling on both sides, but the missiles of the\r\nbarbarians flew much more thickly. For fresh men were always fighting in\r\nturn, affording to their enemy not the slightest opportunity to observe\r\nwhat was being done; but even so the Romans did not have the worst of\r\nit. For a steady wind blew from their side against the barbarians, and\r\nchecked to a considerable degree the force of their arrows. Then, after\r\nboth sides had exhausted all their missiles, they began to use their\r\nspears against each other, and the battle had come still more to close\r\nquarters. On the Roman side the left wing was suffering especially. For\r\nthe Cadiseni, who with Pityaxes were fighting at this point, rushing up\r\nsuddenly in great numbers, routed their enemy, and crowding hard upon\r\nthe fugitives, were killing many of them. When this was observed by the\r\nmen under Sunicas and Aigan, they charged against them at full speed.\r\nBut first the three hundred Eruli under Pharas from the high ground got\r\nin the rear of the enemy and made a wonderful display of valorous deeds\r\nagainst all of them and especially the Cadiseni. And the Persians,\r\nseeing the forces of Sunicas too already coming up against them from the\r\nflank, turned to a hasty flight. And the rout became complete, for the\r\nRomans here joined forces with each other, and there was a great\r\nslaughter of the barbarians. On the Persian right wing not fewer than\r\nthree thousand perished in this action, while the rest escaped with\r\ndifficulty to the phalanx and were saved. And the Romans did not\r\ncontinue their pursuit, but both sides took their stand facing each\r\nother in line. Such was the course of these events.\r\n\r\nBut the mirranes stealthily sent to the left a large body of troops and\r\nwith them all the so-called Immortals. And when these were noticed by\r\nBelisarius and Hermogenes, they ordered the six hundred men under\r\nSunicas and Aigan to go to the angle on the right, where the troops of\r\nSimmas and Ascan were stationed, and behind them they placed many of\r\nBelisarius men. So the Persians who held the left wing under the\r\nleadership of Baresmanas, together with the Immortals, charged on the\r\nrun upon the Romans opposite them, who failed to withstand the attack\r\nand beat a hasty retreat. Thereupon the Romans in the angle, and all who\r\nwere behind them, advanced with great ardour against the pursuers. But\r\ninasmuch as they came upon the barbarians from the side, they cut their\r\narmy into two parts, and the greater portion of them they had on their\r\nright, while some also who were left behind were placed on their left.\r\nAmong these happened to be the standard bearer of Baresmanas, whom\r\nSunicas charged and struck with his spear. And already the Persians who\r\nwere leading the pursuit perceived in what straits they were, and,\r\nwheeling about, they stopped the pursuit and went against their\r\nassailants, and thus became exposed to the enemy on both sides. For\r\nthose in flight before them understood what was happening and turned\r\nback again. The Persians, on their part, with the detachment of the\r\nImmortals, seeing the standard inclined and lowered to the earth, rushed\r\nall together against the Romans at that point with Baresmanas. There the\r\nRomans held their ground. And first Sunicas killed Baresmanas and threw\r\nhim from his horse to the ground. As a result of this the barbarians\r\nwere seized with great fear and thought no longer of resistance, but\r\nfled in utter confusion. And the Romans, having made a circle as it were\r\naround them, killed about five thousand. Thus both armies were all set\r\nin motion, the Persians in retreat, and the Romans in pursuit. In this\r\npart of the conflict all the foot-soldiers who were in the Persian army\r\nthrew down their shields and were caught and wantonly killed by their\r\nenemy. However, the pursuit was not continued by the Romans over a great\r\ndistance. For Belisarius and Hermogenes refused absolutely to let them\r\ngo farther, fearing lest the Persians through some necessity should turn\r\nabout and rout them while pursuing recklessly, and it seemed to them\r\nsufficient to preserve the victory unmarred. For on that day the\r\nPersians had been defeated in battle by the Romans, a thing which had\r\nnot happened for a long time. Thus the two armies separated from each\r\nother. And the Persians were no longer willing to fight a pitched battle\r\nwith the Romans. However, some sudden attacks were made on both sides,\r\nin which the Romans were not at a disadvantage. Such, then, was the\r\nfortune of the armies in Mesopotamia.\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nAnd Cabades sent another army into the part of Armenia which is subject\r\nto the Romans. This army was composed of Persarmenians and Sunitae,\r\nwhose land adjoins that of the Alani. There were also Huns with them, of\r\nthe stock called Sabiri, to the number of three thousand, a most warlike\r\nrace. And Mermeroes, a Persian, had been made general of the whole\r\nforce. When this army was three days' march from Theodosiopolis, they\r\nestablished their camp and, remaining in the land of the Persarmenians,\r\nmade their preparations for the invasion. Now the general of Armenia\r\nwas, as it happened, Dorotheus, a man of discretion and experienced in\r\nmany wars. And Sittas held the office of general in Byzantium, and had\r\nauthority over the whole army in Armenia. These two, then, upon learning\r\nthat an army was being assembled in Persarmenia, straightway sent two\r\nbody-guards with instructions to spy out the whole force of the enemy\r\nand report to them. And both of these men got into the barbarian camp,\r\nand after noting everything accurately, they departed. And they were\r\ntravelling toward some place in that region, when they happened\r\nunexpectedly upon hostile Huns. By them one of the two, Dagaris by name,\r\nwas made captive and bound, while the other succeeded in escaping and\r\nreported everything to the generals. They then armed their whole force\r\nand made an unexpected assault upon the camp of their enemy; and the\r\nbarbarians, panic-stricken by the unexpected attack, never thought of\r\nresistance, but fled as best each one could. Thereupon the Romans, after\r\nkilling a large number and plundering the camp, immediately marched\r\nback.\r\n\r\nNot long after this Mermeroes, having collected the whole army, invaded\r\nthe Roman territory, and they came upon their enemy near the city of\r\nSatala. There they established themselves in camp and remained at rest\r\nin a place called Octava, which is fifty-six stades distant from the\r\ncity. Sittas therefore led out a thousand men and concealed them behind\r\none of the many hills which surround the plain in which the city of\r\nSatala lies. Dorotheus with the rest of the army he ordered to stay\r\ninside the fortifications, because they thought that they were by no\r\nmeans able to withstand the enemy on level ground, since their number\r\nwas not fewer than thirty thousand, while their own forces scarcely\r\namounted to half that number. On the following day the barbarians came\r\nup close to the fortifications and busily set about closing in the town.\r\nBut suddenly, seeing the forces of Sittas who by now were coming down\r\nupon them from the high ground, and having no means of estimating their\r\nnumber, since owing to the summer season a great cloud of dust hung over\r\nthem, they thought they were much more numerous than they were, and,\r\nhurriedly abandoning their plan of closing in the town, they hastened to\r\nmass their force into a small space. But the Romans anticipated the\r\nmovement and, separating their own force into two detachments, they set\r\nupon them as they were retiring from the fortifications; and when this\r\nwas seen by the whole Roman army, they took courage, and with a great\r\nrush they poured out from the fortifications and advanced against their\r\nopponents. They thus put the Persians between their own troops, and\r\nturned them to flight. However, since the barbarians were greatly\r\nsuperior to their enemy in numbers, as has been said, they still offered\r\nresistance, and the battle had become a fierce fight at close quarters.\r\nAnd both sides kept making advances upon their opponents and retiring\r\nquickly, for they were all cavalry. Thereupon Florentius, a Thracian,\r\ncommanding a detachment of horse, charged into the enemy's centre, and\r\nseizing the general's standard, forced it to the ground, and started to\r\nride back. And though he himself was overtaken and fell there, hacked to\r\npieces, he proved to be the chief cause of the victory for the Romans.\r\nFor when the barbarians no longer saw the standard, they were thrown\r\ninto great confusion and terror, and retreating, got inside their camp,\r\nand remained quiet, having lost many men in the battle; and on the\r\nfollowing day they all returned homeward with no one following them up,\r\nfor it seemed to the Romans a great and very noteworthy thing that such\r\na great multitude of barbarians in their own country had suffered those\r\nthings which have just been narrated above, and that, after making an\r\ninvasion into hostile territory, they should retire thus without\r\naccomplishing anything and defeated by a smaller force.\r\n\r\nAt that time the Romans also acquired certain Persian strongholds in\r\nPersarmenia, both the fortress of Bolum and the fortress called\r\nPharangium, which is the place where the Persians mine gold, which they\r\ntake to the king. It happened also that a short time before this they\r\nhad reduced to subjection the Tzanic nation, who had been settled from\r\nof old in Roman territory as an autonomous people; and as to these\r\nthings, the manner in which they were accomplished will be related here\r\nand now.\r\n\r\nAs one goes from the land of Armenia into Persarmenia the Taurus lies on\r\nthe right, extending into Iberia and the peoples there, as has been said\r\na little before this[19], while on the left the road which continues to\r\ndescend for a great distance is overhung by exceedingly precipitous\r\nmountains, concealed forever by clouds and snow, from which the Phasis\r\nRiver issues and flows into the land of Colchis. In this place from the\r\nbeginning lived barbarians, the Tzanic nation, subject to no one, called\r\nSani in early times; they made plundering expeditions among the Romans\r\nwho lived round about, maintaining a most difficult existence, and\r\nalways living upon what they stole; for their land produced for them\r\nnothing good to eat. Wherefore also the Roman emperor sent them each\r\nyear a fixed amount of gold, with the condition that they should never\r\nplunder the country thereabout. And the barbarians had sworn to observe\r\nthis agreement with the oaths peculiar to their nation, and then,\r\ndisregarding what they had sworn, they had been accustomed for a long\r\ntime to make unexpected attacks and to injure not only the Armenians,\r\nbut also the Romans who lived next to them as far as the sea; then,\r\nafter completing their inroad in a short space of time, they would\r\nimmediately betake themselves again to their homes. And whenever it _so_\r\nhappened that they chanced upon a Roman army, they were always defeated\r\nin the battle, but they proved to be absolutely beyond capture owing to\r\nthe strength of their fastnesses. In this way Sittas had defeated them\r\nin battle before this war; and then by many manifestations of kindness\r\nin word and in deed he had been able to win them over completely. For\r\nthey changed their manner of life to one of a more civilized sort, and\r\nenrolled themselves among the Roman troops, and from that time they have\r\ngone forth against the enemy with the rest of the Roman army. They also\r\nabandoned their own religion for a more righteous faith, and all of them\r\nbecame Christians. Such then was the history of the Tzani.\r\n\r\nBeyond the borders of this people there is a cañon whose walls are both\r\nhigh and exceedingly steep, extending as far as the Caucasus mountains.\r\nIn it are populous towns, and grapes and other fruits grow plentifully.\r\nAnd this canon for about the space of a three days' journey is tributary\r\nto the Romans, but from there begins the territory of Persarmenia; and\r\nhere is the gold-mine which, with the permission of Cabades, was worked\r\nby one of the natives, Symeon by name. When this Symeon saw that both\r\nnations were actively engaged in the war, he decided to deprive Cabades\r\nof the revenue. Therefore he gave over both himself and Pharangium to\r\nthe Romans, but refused to deliver over to either one the gold of the\r\nmine. And as for the Romans, they did nothing, thinking it sufficient\r\nfor them that the enemy had lost the income from there, and the Persians\r\nwere not able against the will of the Romans to force the inhabitants of\r\nthe place to terms, because they were baffled by the difficult country.\r\n\r\nAt about the same time Narses and Aratius who at the beginning of this\r\nwar, as I have stated above,[20] had an encounter with Sittas and\r\nBelisarius in the land of the Persarmenians, came together with their\r\nmother as deserters to the Romans; and the emperor's steward, Narses,\r\nreceived them (for he too happened to be a Persarmenian by birth), and\r\nhe presented them with a large sum of money. When this came to the\r\nknowledge of Isaac, their youngest brother, he secretly opened\r\nnegotiations with the Romans, and delivered over to them the fortress of\r\nBolum, which lies very near the limits of Theodosiopolis. For he\r\ndirected that soldiers should be concealed somewhere in the vicinity,\r\nand he received them into the fort by night, opening stealthily one\r\nsmall gate for them. Thus he too came to Byzantium.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nThus matters stood with the Romans. But the Persians, though defeated by\r\nBelisarius in the battle at Daras, refused even so to retire from there,\r\nuntil Rufinus, coming into the presence of Cabades, spoke as follows: \"O\r\nKing, I have been sent by thy brother, who reproaches thee with a just\r\nreproach, because the Persians for no righteous cause have come in arms\r\ninto his land. But it would be more seemly for a king who is not only\r\nmighty, but also wise as thou art, to secure a peaceful conclusion of\r\nwar, rather than, when affairs have been satisfactorily settled, to\r\ninflict upon himself and his people unnecessary confusion. Wherefore\r\nalso I myself have come here with good hopes, in order that from now on\r\nboth peoples may enjoy the blessings which come from peace.\" So spoke\r\nRufinus. And Cabades replied as follows: \"O son of Silvanus, by no means\r\ntry to reverse the causes, understanding as you do best of all men that\r\nyou Romans have been the chief cause of the whole confusion. For we have\r\ntaken the Caspian Gates to the advantage of both Persians and Romans,\r\nafter forcing out the barbarians there, since Anastasius, the Emperor of\r\nthe Romans, as you yourself doubtless know, when the opportunity was\r\noffered him to buy them with money, was not willing to do so, in order\r\nthat he might not be compelled to squander great sums of money in behalf\r\nof both nations by keeping an army there perpetually. And since that\r\ntime we have stationed that great army there, and have supported it up\r\nto the present time, thereby giving you the privilege of inhabiting the\r\nland unplundered as far as concerns the barbarians on that side, and of\r\nholding your own possessions with complete freedom from trouble. But as\r\nif this were not sufficient for you, you have also made a great city,\r\nDaras, as a stronghold against the Persians, although this was\r\nexplicitly forbidden in the treaty which Anatolius arranged with the\r\nPersians; and as a result of this it is necessary for the Persian state\r\nto be afflicted with the difficulties and the expense of two armies, the\r\none in order that the Massagetae may not be able fearlessly to plunder\r\nthe land of both of us, and the other in order that we may check your\r\ninroads. When lately we made a protest regarding these matters and\r\ndemanded that one of two things should be done by you, either that the\r\narmy sent to the Caspian Gates should be sent by both of us, or that the\r\ncity of Daras should be dismantled, you refused to understand what was\r\nsaid, but saw fit to strengthen your plot against the Persians by a\r\ngreater injury, if we remember correctly the building of the fort in\r\nMindouos[21]. And even now the Romans may choose peace, or they may\r\nelect war, by either doing justice to us or going against our rights.\r\nFor never will the Persians lay down their arms, until the Romans either\r\nhelp them in guarding the gates, as is just and right, or dismantle the\r\ncity of Daras.\" With these words Cabades dismissed the ambassador,\r\ndropping the hint that he was willing to take money from the Romans and\r\nhave done with the causes of the war. This was reported to the emperor\r\nby Rufinus when he came to Byzantium. [531 A.D.] Hermogenes also came\r\nthither not long afterwards, and the winter came to a close; thus ended\r\nthe fourth year of the reign of the Emperor Justinian.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nAt the opening of spring a Persian army under the leadership of\r\nAzarethes invaded the Roman territory. They were fifteen thousand\r\nstrong, all horsemen. With them was Alamoundaras, son of Saccice, with a\r\nvery large body of Saracens. But this invasion was not made by the\r\nPersians in the customary manner; for they did not invade Mesopotamia,\r\nas formerly, but the country called Commagene of old, but now\r\nEuphratesia, a point from which, as far as we know, the Persians never\r\nbefore conducted a campaign against the Romans. But why the land was\r\ncalled Mesopotamia and why the Persians refrained from making their\r\nattack at this point is what I now propose to relate.\r\n\r\nThere is a mountain in Armenia which is not especially precipitous,\r\ntwo-and-forty stades removed from Theodosiopolis and lying toward the\r\nnorth from it. From this mountain issue two springs, forming immediately\r\ntwo rivers, the one on the right called the Euphrates, and the other the\r\nTigris. One of these, the Tigris, descends, with no deviations and with\r\nno tributaries except small ones emptying into it, straight toward the\r\ncity of Amida. And continuing into the country which lies to the north\r\nof this city it enters the land of Assyria. But the Euphrates at its\r\nbeginning flows for a short distance, and is then immediately lost to\r\nsight as it goes on; it does not, however, become subterranean, but a\r\nvery strange thing happens. For the water is covered by a bog of great\r\ndepth, extending about fifty stades in length and twenty in breadth; and\r\nreeds grow in this mud in great abundance. But the earth there is of\r\nsuch a hard sort that it seems to those who chance upon it to be nothing\r\nelse than solid ground, so that both pedestrians and horsemen travel\r\nover it without any fear. Nay more, even wagons pass over the place in\r\ngreat numbers every day, but they are wholly insufficient to shake the\r\nbog or to find a weak spot in it at any point. The natives burn the\r\nreeds every year, to prevent the roads being stopped up by them, and\r\nonce, when an exceedingly violent wind struck the place, it came about\r\nthat the fire reached the extremities of the roots, and the water\r\nappeared at a small opening; but in a short time the ground closed\r\nagain, and gave the spot the same appearance which it had had before.\r\nFrom there the river proceeds into the land called Celesene, where was\r\nthe sanctuary of Artemis among the Taurians, from which they say\r\nIphigenia, daughter of Agamemnon, fled with Orestes and Pylades, bearing\r\nthe statue of Artemis. For the other temple which has existed even to my\r\nday in the city of Comana is not the one \"Among the Taurians.\" But I\r\nshall explain how this temple came into being.\r\n\r\nWhen Orestes had departed in haste from the Taurians with his sister, it\r\nso happened that he contracted some disease. And when he made inquiry\r\nabout the disease they say that the oracle responded that his trouble\r\nwould not abate until he built a temple to Artemis in a spot such as the\r\none among the Taurians, and there cut off his hair and named the city\r\nafter it. So then Orestes, going about the country there, came to\r\nPontus, and saw a mountain which rose steep and towering, while below\r\nalong the extremities of the mountain flowed the river Iris. Orestes,\r\ntherefore, supposing at that time that this was the place indicated to\r\nhim by the oracle, built there a great city and the temple of Artemis,\r\nand, shearing off his hair, named after it the city which even up to the\r\npresent time has been called Comana. The story goes on that after\r\nOrestes had done these things, the disease continued to be as violent as\r\nbefore, if not even more so. Then the man perceived that he was not\r\nsatisfying the oracle by doing these things, and he again went about\r\nlooking everywhere and found a certain spot in Cappadocia very closely\r\nresembling the one among the Taurians. I myself have often seen this\r\nplace and admired it exceedingly, and have imagined that I was in the\r\nland of the Taurians. For this mountain resembles the other remarkably,\r\nsince the Taurus is here also and the river Sarus is similar to the\r\nEuphrates there. So Orestes built in that place an imposing city and two\r\ntemples, the one to Artemis and the other to his sister Iphigenia, which\r\nthe Christians have made sanctuaries for themselves, without changing\r\ntheir structure at all. This is called even now Golden Comana, being\r\nnamed from the hair of Orestes, which they say he cut off there and thus\r\nescaped from his affliction. But some say that this disease from which\r\nhe escaped was nothing else than that of madness which seized him after\r\nhe had killed his own mother. But I shall return to the previous\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\nFrom Tauric Armenia and the land of Celesene the River Euphrates,\r\nflowing to the right of the Tigris, flows around an extensive territory,\r\nand since many rivers join it and among them the Arsinus, whose copious\r\nstream flows down from the land of the so-called Persarmenians, it\r\nbecomes naturally a great river, and flows into the land of the people\r\nanciently called White Syrians but now known as the Lesser Armenians,\r\nwhose first city, Melitene, is one of great importance. From there it\r\nflows past Samosata and Hierapolis and all the towns in that region as\r\nfar as the land of Assyria, where the two rivers unite with each other\r\ninto one stream which bears the name of the Tigris. The land which lies\r\noutside the River Euphrates, beginning with Samosata, was called in\r\nancient times Commagene, but now it is named after the river[22]. But\r\nthe land inside the river, that namely which is between it and the\r\nTigris, is appropriately named Mesopotamia; however, a portion of it is\r\ncalled not only by this name, but also by certain others. For the land\r\nas far as the city of Amida has come to be called Armenia by some, while\r\nEdessa together with the country around it is called Osroene, after\r\nOsroes, a man who was king in that place in former times, when the men\r\nof this country were in alliance with the Persians. After the time,\r\ntherefore, when the Persians had taken from the Romans the city of\r\nNisibis and certain other places in Mesopotamia, whenever they were\r\nabout to make an expedition against the Romans, they disregarded the\r\nland outside the River Euphrates, which was for the most part unwatered\r\nand deserted by men, and gathered themselves here with no trouble, since\r\nthey were in a land which was their own and which lay very close to the\r\ninhabited land of their enemy, and from here they always made their\r\ninvasions.\r\n\r\nWhen the mirranes[23], defeated in battle[24] and with the greater part\r\nof his men lost, came back to the Persian land with the remainder of his\r\narmy, he received bitter punishment at the hands of King Cabades. For he\r\ntook away from him a decoration which he was accustomed to bind upon the\r\nhair of his head, an ornament wrought of gold and pearls. Now this is a\r\ngreat dignity among the Persians, second only to the kingly honour. For\r\nthere it is unlawful to wear a gold ring or girdle or brooch or anything\r\nelse whatsoever, except a man be counted worthy to do so by the king.\r\n\r\nThereafter Cabades began to consider in what manner he himself should\r\nmake an expedition against the Romans. For after the mirranes had failed\r\nin the manner I have told, he felt confidence in no one else. While he\r\nwas completely at a loss as to what he should do, Alamoundaras, the king\r\nof the Saracens, came before him and said: \"Not everything, O Master,\r\nshould be entrusted to fortune, nor should one believe that all wars\r\nought to be successful. For this is not likely and besides it is not in\r\nkeeping with the course of human events, but this idea is most\r\nunfortunate for those who are possessed by it. For when men who expect\r\nthat all the good things will come to them fail at any time, if it so\r\nhappen, they are distressed more than is seemly by the very hope which\r\nwrongly led them on. Therefore, since men have not always confidence in\r\nfortune, they do not enter into the danger of war in a straightforward\r\nway, even if they boast that they surpass the enemy in every respect,\r\nbut by deception and divers devices they exert themselves to circumvent\r\ntheir opponents. For those who assume the risk of an even struggle have\r\nno assurance of victory. Now, therefore, O King of Kings, neither be\r\nthus distressed by the misfortune which has befallen Mirranes, nor\r\ndesire again to make trial of fortune. For in Mesopotamia and the land\r\nof Osroene, as it is called, since it is very close to thy boundaries,\r\nthe cities are very strong above all others, and now they contain a\r\nmultitude of soldiers such as never before, so that if we go there the\r\ncontest will not prove a safe one; but in the land which lies outside\r\nthe River Euphrates, and in Syria which adjoins it, there is neither a\r\nfortified city nor an army of any importance. For this I have often\r\nheard from the Saracens sent as spies to these parts. There too, they\r\nsay, is the city of Antioch, in wealth and size and population the first\r\nof all the cities of the Eastern Roman Empire; and this city is\r\nunguarded and destitute of soldiers. For the people of this city care\r\nfor nothing else than fêtes and luxurious living, and their constant\r\nrivalries with each other in the theatres. Accordingly, if we go against\r\nthem unexpectedly, it is not at all unlikely that we shall capture the\r\ncity by a sudden attack, and that we shall return to the land of the\r\nPersians without having met any hostile army, and before the troops in\r\nMesopotamia have learned what has happened. As for lack of water or of\r\nany kind of provisions, let no such thought occur to thee; for I myself\r\nshall lead the army wherever it shall seem best.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Cabades heard this he could neither oppose nor distrust the plan.\r\nFor Alamoundaras was most discreet and well experienced in matters of\r\nwarfare, thoroughly faithful to the Persians, and unusually\r\nenergetic,--a man who for a space of fifty years forced the Roman state\r\nto bend the knee. For beginning from the boundaries of Aegypt and as far\r\nas Mesopotamia he plundered the whole country, pillaging one place after\r\nanother, burning the buildings in his track and making captives of the\r\npopulation by the tens of thousands on each raid, most of whom he killed\r\nwithout consideration, while he gave up the others for great sums of\r\nmoney. And he was confronted by no one at all. For he never made his\r\ninroad without looking about, but so suddenly did he move and so very\r\nopportunely for himself, that, as a rule, he was already off with all\r\nthe plunder when the generals and the soldiers were beginning to learn\r\nwhat had happened and to gather themselves against him. If, indeed, by\r\nany chance, they were able to catch him, this barbarian would fall upon\r\nhis pursuers while still unprepared and not in battle array, and would\r\nrout and destroy them with no trouble; and on one occasion he made\r\nprisoners of all the soldiers who were pursuing him together with their\r\nofficers. These officers were Timostratus, the brother of Rufinus, and\r\nJohn, the son of Lucas, whom he gave up indeed later, thereby gaining\r\nfor himself no mean or trivial wealth. And, in a word, this man proved\r\nhimself the most difficult and dangerous enemy of all to the Romans. The\r\nreason was this, that Alamoundaras, holding the position of king, ruled\r\nalone over all the Saracens in Persia, and he was always able to make\r\nhis inroad with the whole army wherever he wished in the Roman domain;\r\nand neither any commander of Roman troops, whom they call \"duces,\" nor\r\nany leader of the Saracens allied with the Romans, who are called\r\n\"phylarchs,\" was strong enough with his men to array himself against\r\nAlamoundaras; for the troops stationed in the different districts were\r\nnot a match in battle for the enemy. [531 A.D.] For this reason the\r\nEmperor Justinian put in command of as many clans as possible Arethas,\r\nthe son of Gabalas, who ruled over the Saracens of Arabia, and bestowed\r\nupon him the dignity of king, a thing which among the Romans had never\r\nbefore been done. However Alamoundaras continued to injure the Romans\r\njust as much as before, if not more, since Arethas was either extremely\r\nunfortunate in every inroad and every conflict, or else he turned\r\ntraitor as quickly as he could. For as yet we know nothing certain about\r\nhim. In this way it came about that Alamoundaras, with no one to stand\r\nagainst him, plundered the whole East for an exceedingly long time, for\r\nhe lived to a very advanced age.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nThis man's suggestion at that time therefore pleased Cabades, and he\r\nchose out fifteen thousand men, putting in command of them Azarethes, a\r\nPersian, who was an exceptionally able warrior, and he bade Alamoundaras\r\nlead the expedition. So they crossed the River Euphrates in Assyria,\r\nand, after passing over some uninhabited country, they suddenly and\r\nunexpectedly threw their forces into the land of the so-called\r\nCommagenae. This was the first invasion made by the Persians from this\r\npoint into Roman soil, as far as we know from tradition or by any other\r\nmeans, and it paralyzed all the Romans with fear by its unexpectedness.\r\nAnd when this news came to the knowledge of Belisarius, at first he was\r\nat a loss, but afterwards he decided to go to the rescue with all speed.\r\nSo he established a sufficient garrison in each city in order that\r\nCabades with another hostile army might not come there and find the\r\ntowns of Mesopotamia utterly unguarded, and himself with the rest of the\r\narmy went to meet the invasion; and crossing the River Euphrates they\r\nmoved forward in great haste. Now the Roman army amounted to about\r\ntwenty thousand foot and horse, and among them not less than two\r\nthousand were Isaurians. The commanders of cavalry were all the same\r\nones who had previously fought the battle at Daras with Mirranes and the\r\nPersians, while the infantry were commanded by one of the body-guards of\r\nthe Emperor Justinian, Peter by name. The Isaurians, however, were under\r\nthe command of Longinus and Stephanacius. Arethas also came there to\r\njoin them with the Saracen army. When they reached the city of Chalcis,\r\nthey encamped and remained there, since they learned that the enemy were\r\nin a place called Gabboulon, one hundred and ten stades away from\r\nChalcis. When this became known to Alamoundaras and Azarethes, they were\r\nterrified at the danger, and no longer continued their advance, but\r\ndecided to retire homeward instantly. Accordingly they began to march\r\nback, with the River Euphrates on the left, while the Roman army was\r\nfollowing in the rear. And in the spot where the Persians bivouacked\r\neach night the Romans always tarried on the following night. For\r\nBelisarius purposely refused to allow the army to make any longer march\r\nbecause he did not wish to come to an engagement with the enemy, but he\r\nconsidered that it was sufficient for them that the Persians and\r\nAlamoundaras, after invading the land of the Romans, should retire from\r\nit in such a fashion, betaking themselves to their own land without\r\naccomplishing anything. And because of this all secretly mocked him,\r\nboth officers and soldiers, but not a man reproached him to his face.\r\n\r\nFinally the Persians made their bivouac on the bank of the Euphrates\r\njust opposite the city of Callinicus. From there they were about to\r\nmarch through a country absolutely uninhabited by man, and thus to quit\r\nthe land of the Romans; for they purposed no longer to proceed as\r\nbefore, keeping to the bank of the river. The Romans had passed the\r\nnight in the city of Sura, and, removing from there, they came upon the\r\nenemy just in the act of preparing for the departure. [Ap. 19, 531] Now\r\nthe feast of Easter was near and would take place on the following day;\r\nthis feast is reverenced by the Christians above all others, and on the\r\nday before it they are accustomed to refrain from food and drink not\r\nonly throughout the day, but for a large part of the night also they\r\ncontinue the fast. Then, therefore, Belisarius, seeing that all his men\r\nwere passionately eager to go against the enemy, wished to persuade them\r\nto give up this idea (for this course had been counselled by Hermogenes\r\nalso, who had come recently on an embassy from the emperor); he\r\naccordingly called together all who were present and spoke as follows:\r\n\"O Romans, whither are you rushing? and what has happened to you that\r\nyou are purposing to choose for yourselves a danger which is not\r\nnecessary? Men believe that there is only one victory which is\r\nunalloyed, namely to suffer no harm at the hands of the enemy, and this\r\nvery thing has been given us in the present instance by fortune and by\r\nthe fear of us that overpowers our foes. Therefore it is better to enjoy\r\nthe benefit of our present blessings than to seek them when they have\r\npassed. For the Persians, led on by many hopes, undertook an expedition\r\nagainst the Romans, and now, with everything lost, they have beaten a\r\nhasty retreat. So that if we compel them against their will to abandon\r\ntheir purpose of withdrawing and to come to battle with us, we shall win\r\nno advantage whatsoever if we are victorious,--for why should one rout a\r\nfugitive?--while if we are unfortunate, as may happen, we shall both be\r\ndeprived of the victory which we now have, not robbed of it by the\r\nenemy, but flinging it away ourselves, and also we shall abandon the\r\nland of the emperor to lie open hereafter to the attacks of the enemy\r\nwithout defenders. Moreover this also is worth your consideration, that\r\nGod is always accustomed to succour men in dangers which are necessary,\r\nnot in those which they choose for themselves. And apart from this it\r\nwill come about that those who have nowhere to turn will play the part\r\nof brave men even against their will, while the obstacles which are to\r\nbe met by us in entering the engagement are many; for a large number of\r\nyou have come on foot and all of us are fasting. I refrain from\r\nmentioning that some even now have not arrived.\" So spoke Belisarius.\r\n\r\nBut the army began to insult him, not in silence nor with any\r\nconcealment, but they came shouting into his presence, and called him\r\nweak and a destroyer of their zeal; and even some of the officers joined\r\nwith the soldiers in this offence, thus displaying the extent of their\r\ndaring. And Belisarius, in astonishment at their shamelessness, changed\r\nhis exhortation and now seemed to be urging them on against the enemy\r\nand drawing them up for battle, saying that he had not known before\r\ntheir eagerness to fight, but that now he was of good courage and would\r\ngo against the enemy with a better hope. He then formed the phalanx with\r\na single front, disposing his men as follows: on the left wing by the\r\nriver he stationed all the infantry, while on the right where the ground\r\nrose sharply he placed Arethas and all his Saracens; he himself with the\r\ncavalry took his position in the centre. Thus the Romans arrayed\r\nthemselves. And when Azarethes saw the enemy gathering in battle line,\r\nhe exhorted his men with the following words: \"Persians as you are, no\r\none would deny that you would not give up your valour in exchange for\r\nlife, if a choice of the two should be offered. But I say that not even\r\nif you should wish, is it within your power to make the choice between\r\nthe two. For as for men who have the opportunity to escape from danger\r\nand live in dishonour it is not at all unnatural that they should, if\r\nthey wish, choose what is most pleasant instead of what is best; but for\r\nmen who are bound to die, either gloriously at the hands of the enemy or\r\nshamefully led to punishment by your Master, it is extreme folly not to\r\nchoose what is better instead of what is most shameful. Now, therefore,\r\nwhen things stand thus, I consider that it befits you all to bear in\r\nmind not only the enemy but also your own Lord and so enter this\r\nbattle.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Azarethes also had uttered these words of exhortation, he\r\nstationed the phalanx opposite his opponents, assigning the Persians the\r\nright wing and the Saracens the left. Straightway both sides began the\r\nfight, and the battle was exceedingly fierce. For the arrows, shot from\r\neither side in very great numbers, caused great loss of life in both\r\narmies, while some placed themselves in the interval between the armies\r\nand made a display of valorous deeds against each other, and especially\r\namong the Persians they were falling by the arrows in great numbers. For\r\nwhile their missiles were incomparably more frequent, since the Persians\r\nare almost all bowmen and they learn to make their shots much more\r\nrapidly than any other men, still the bows which sent the arrows were\r\nweak and not very tightly strung, so that their missiles, hitting a\r\ncorselet, perhaps, or helmet or shield of a Roman warrior, were broken\r\noff and had no power to hurt the man who was hit. The Roman bowmen are\r\nalways slower indeed, but inasmuch as their bows are extremely stiff and\r\nvery tightly strung, and one might add that they are handled by stronger\r\nmen, they easily slay much greater numbers of those they hit than do the\r\nPersians, for no armour proves an obstacle to the force of their arrows.\r\nNow already two-thirds of the day had passed, and the battle was still\r\neven. Then by mutual agreement all the best of the Persian army advanced\r\nto attack the Roman right wing, where Arethas and the Saracens had been\r\nstationed. But they broke their formation and moved apart, so that they\r\ngot the reputation of having betrayed the Romans to the Persians. For\r\nwithout awaiting the oncoming enemy they all straightway beat a hasty\r\nretreat. So the Persians in this way broke through the enemy's line and\r\nimmediately got in the rear of the Roman cavalry. Thus the Romans, who\r\nwere already exhausted both by the march and the labour of the\r\nbattle,--and besides this they were all fasting so far on in the\r\nday,--now that they were assailed by the enemy on both sides, held out\r\nno longer, but the most of them in full flight made their way to the\r\nislands in the river which were close by, while some also remained there\r\nand performed deeds both amazing and remarkable against the enemy. Among\r\nthese was Ascan who, after killing many of the notables among the\r\nPersians, was gradually hacked to pieces and finally fell, leaving to\r\nthe enemy abundant reason to remember him. And with him eight hundred\r\nothers perished after shewing themselves brave men in this struggle, and\r\nalmost all the Isaurians fell with their leaders, without even daring to\r\nlift their weapons against the enemy. For they were thoroughly\r\ninexperienced in this business, since they had recently left off farming\r\nand entered into the perils of warfare, which before that time were\r\nunknown to them. And yet just before these very men had been most\r\nfurious of all for battle because of their ignorance of warfare, and\r\nwere then reproaching Belisarius with cowardice. They were not in fact\r\nall Isaurians but the majority of them were Lycaones.\r\n\r\nBelisarius with some few men remained there, and as long as he saw Ascan\r\nand his men holding out, he also in company with those who were with him\r\nheld back the enemy; but when some of Ascan's troops had fallen, and the\r\nothers had turned to flee wherever they could, then at length he too\r\nfled with his men and came to the phalanx of infantry, who with Peter\r\nwere still fighting, although not many in number now, since the most of\r\nthem too had fled. There he himself gave up his horse and commanded all\r\nhis men to do the same thing and on foot with the others to fight off\r\nthe oncoming enemy. And those of the Persians who were following the\r\nfugitives, after pursuing for only a short distance, straightway\r\nreturned and rushed upon the infantry and Belisarius with all the\r\nothers. Then the Romans turned their backs to the river so that no\r\nmovement to surround them might be executed by the enemy, and as best\r\nthey could under the circumstances were defending themselves against\r\ntheir assailants. And again the battle became fierce, although the two\r\nsides were not evenly matched in strength; for foot-soldiers, and a very\r\nfew of them, were fighting against the whole Persian cavalry.\r\nNevertheless the enemy were not able either to rout them or in any other\r\nway to overpower them. For standing shoulder to shoulder they kept\r\nthemselves constantly massed in a small space, and they formed with\r\ntheir shields a rigid, unyielding barricade, so that they shot at the\r\nPersians more conveniently than they were shot at by them. Many a time\r\nafter giving up, the Persians would advance against them determined to\r\nbreak up and destroy their line, but they always retired again from the\r\nassault unsuccessful. For their horses, annoyed by the clashing of the\r\nshields, reared up and made confusion for themselves and their riders.\r\nThus both sides continued the struggle until it had become late in the\r\nday. And when night had already come on, the Persians withdrew to their\r\ncamp, and Belisarius accompanied by some few men found a freight-boat\r\nand crossed over to the island in the river, while the other Romans\r\nreached the same place by swimming. On the following day many\r\nfreight-boats were brought to the Romans from the city of Callinicus and\r\nthey were conveyed thither in them, and the Persians, after despoiling\r\nthe dead, all departed homeward. However they did not find their own\r\ndead less numerous than the enemy's.\r\n\r\nWhen Azarethes reached Persia with his army, although he had prospered\r\nin the battle, he found Cabades exceedingly ungrateful, for the\r\nfollowing reason. It is a custom among the Persians that, when they are\r\nabout to march against any of their foes, the king sits on the royal\r\nthrone, and many baskets are set there before him; and the general also\r\nis present who is expected to lead the army against the enemy; then the\r\narmy passes along before the king, one man at a time, and each of them\r\nthrows one weapon into the baskets; after this they are sealed with the\r\nking's seal and preserved; and when this army returns to Persia, each\r\none of the soldiers takes one weapon out of the baskets. A count is then\r\nmade by those whose office it is to do so of all the weapons which have\r\nnot been taken by the men, and they report to the king the number of the\r\nsoldiers who have not returned, and in this way it becomes evident how\r\nmany have perished in the war. Thus the law has stood from of old among\r\nthe Persians. Now when Azarethes came into the presence of the king,\r\nCabades enquired of him whether he came back with any Roman fortress won\r\nover to their side, for he had marched forth with Alamoundaras against\r\nthe Romans, with the purpose of subduing Antioch. And Azarethes said\r\nthat he had captured no fortress, but that he had conquered the Romans\r\nand Belisarius in battle. So Cabades bade the army of Azarethes pass by,\r\nand from the baskets each man took out a weapon just as was customary.\r\nBut since many weapons were left, Cabades rebuked Azarethes for the\r\nvictory and thereafter ranked him among the most unworthy. So the\r\nvictory had this conclusion for Azarethes.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nAt that time the idea occurred to the Emperor Justinian to ally with\r\nhimself the Aethiopians and the Homeritae, in order to injure the\r\nPersians. I shall now first explain what part of the earth these nations\r\noccupy, and then I shall point out in what manner the emperor hoped that\r\nthey would be of help to the Romans. The boundaries of Palestine extend\r\ntoward the east to the sea which is called the Red Sea. Now this sea,\r\nbeginning at India, comes to an end at this point in the Roman domain.\r\nAnd there is a city called Aelas on its shore, where the sea comes to an\r\nend, as I have said, and becomes a very narrow gulf. And as one sails\r\ninto the sea from there, the Egyptian mountains lie on the right,\r\nextending toward the south; on the other side a country deserted by men\r\nextends northward to an indefinite distance; and the land on both sides\r\nis visible as one sails in as far as the island called Iotabe, not less\r\nthan one thousand stades distant from the city of Aelas. On this island\r\nHebrews had lived from of old in autonomy, but in the reign of this\r\nJustinian they have become subject to the Romans. From there on there\r\ncomes a great open sea. And those who sail into this part of it no\r\nlonger see the land on the right, but they always anchor along the left\r\ncoast when night comes on. For it is impossible to navigate in the\r\ndarkness on this sea, since it is everywhere full of shoals. But there\r\nare harbours there and great numbers of them, not made by the hand of\r\nman, but by the natural contour of the land, and for this reason it is\r\nnot difficult for mariners to find anchorage wherever they happen to be.\r\n\r\nThis coast[25] immediately beyond the boundaries of Palestine is held by\r\nSaracens, who have been settled from of old in the Palm Groves. These\r\ngroves are in the interior, extending over a great tract of land, and\r\nthere absolutely nothing else grows except palm trees. The Emperor\r\nJustinian had received these palm groves as a present from Abochorabus,\r\nthe ruler of the Saracens there, and he was appointed by the emperor\r\ncaptain over the Saracens in Palestine. And he guarded the land from\r\nplunder constantly, for both to the barbarians over whom he ruled and no\r\nless to the enemy, Abochorabus always seemed a man to be feared and an\r\nexceptionally energetic fellow. Formally, therefore, the emperor holds\r\nthe Palm Groves, but for him really to possess himself of any of the\r\ncountry there is utterly impossible. For a land completely destitute of\r\nhuman habitation and extremely dry lies between, extending to the\r\ndistance of a ten days' journey; moreover the Palm Groves themselves are\r\nby no means worth anything, and Abochorabus only gave the form of a\r\ngift, and the emperor accepted it with full knowledge of the fact. So\r\nmuch then for the Palm Groves. Adjoining this people there are other\r\nSaracens in possession of the coast, who are called Maddeni and who are\r\nsubjects of the Homeritae. These Homeritae dwell in the land on the\r\nfarther side of them on the shore of the sea. And beyond them many other\r\nnations are said to be settled as far as the man-eating Saracens. Beyond\r\nthese are the nations of India. But regarding these matters let each one\r\nspeak as he may wish.\r\n\r\nAbout opposite the Homeritae on the opposite mainland dwell the\r\nAethiopians who are called Auxomitae, because their king resides in the\r\ncity of Auxomis. And the expanse of sea which lies between is crossed in\r\na voyage of five days and nights, when a moderately favouring wind\r\nblows. For here they are accustomed to navigate by night also, since\r\nthere are no shoals at all in these parts; this portion of the sea has\r\nbeen called the Red Sea by some. For the sea which one traverses beyond\r\nthis point as far as the shore and the city of Aelas has received the\r\nname of the Arabian Gulf, inasmuch as the country which extends from\r\nhere to the limits of the city of Gaza used to be called in olden times\r\nArabia, since the king of the Arabs had his palace in early times in the\r\ncity of Petrae. Now the harbour of the Homeritae from which they are\r\naccustomed to put to sea for the voyage to Aethiopia is called Bulicas;\r\nand at the end of the sail across the sea they always put in at the\r\nharbour of the Adulitae. But the city of Adulis is removed from the\r\nharbour a distance of twenty stades (for it lacks only so much of being\r\non the sea), while from the city of Auxomis it is a journey of twelve\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nAll the boats which are found in India and on this sea are not made in\r\nthe same manner as are other ships. For neither are they smeared with\r\npitch, nor with any other substance, nor indeed are the planks fastened\r\ntogether by iron nails going through and through, but they are bound\r\ntogether with a kind of cording. The reason is not as most persons\r\nsuppose, that there are certain rocks there which draw the iron to\r\nthemselves (for witness the fact that when the Roman vessels sail from\r\nAelas into this sea, although they are fitted with much iron, no such\r\nthing has ever happened to them), but rather because the Indians and the\r\nAethiopians possess neither iron nor any other thing suitable for such\r\npurposes. Furthermore, they are not even able to buy any of these things\r\nfrom the Romans since this is explicitly forbidden to all by law; for\r\ndeath is the punishment for one who is caught. Such then is the\r\ndescription of the so-called Red Sea[26] and of the land which lies on\r\neither side of it.\r\n\r\nFrom the city of Auxomis to the Aegyptian boundaries of the Roman\r\ndomain, where the city called Elephantine is situated, is a journey of\r\nthirty days for an unencumbered traveller. Within that space many\r\nnations are settled, and among them the Blemyes and the Nobatae, who are\r\nvery large nations. But the Blemyes dwell in the central portion of the\r\ncountry, while the Nobatae possess the territory about the River Nile.\r\nFormerly this was not the limit of the Roman empire, but it lay beyond\r\nthere as far as one would advance in a seven days' journey; but the\r\nRoman Emperor Diocletian came there, and observed that the tribute from\r\nthese places was of the smallest possible account, since the land is at\r\nthat point extremely narrow (for rocks rise to an exceedingly great\r\nheight at no great distance from the Nile and spread over the rest of\r\nthe country), while a very large body of soldiers had been stationed\r\nthere from of old, the maintenance of which was an excessive burden upon\r\nthe public; and at the same time the Nobatae who formerly dwelt about\r\nthe city of Oasis used to plunder the whole region; so he persuaded\r\nthese barbarians to move from their own habitations, and to settle along\r\nthe River Nile, promising to bestow upon them great cities and land both\r\nextensive and incomparably better than that which they had previously\r\noccupied. For in this way he thought that they would no longer harass\r\nthe country about Oasis at least, and that they would possess themselves\r\nof the land given them, as being their own, and would probably beat off\r\nthe Blemyes and the other barbarians. And since this pleased the\r\nNobatae, they made the migration immediately, just as Diocletian\r\ndirected them, and took possession of all the Roman cities and the land\r\non both sides of the river beyond the city of Elephantine. Then it was\r\nthat this emperor decreed that to them and to the Blemyes a fixed sum of\r\ngold should be given every year with the stipulation that they should no\r\nlonger plunder the land of the Romans. And they receive this gold even\r\nup to my time, but none the less they overrun the country there. Thus it\r\nseems that with all barbarians there is no means of compelling them to\r\nkeep faith with the Romans except through the fear of soldiers to hold\r\nthem in check. And yet this emperor went so far as to select a certain\r\nisland in the River Nile close to the city of Elephantine and there\r\nconstruct a very strong fortress in which he established certain temples\r\nand altars for the Romans and these barbarians in common, and he settled\r\npriests of both nations in this fortress, thinking that the friendship\r\nbetween them would be secure by reason of their sharing the things\r\nsacred to them. And for this reason he named the place Philae. Now both\r\nthese nations, the Blemyes and the Nobatae, believe in all the gods in\r\nwhich the Greeks believe, and they also reverence Isis and Osiris, and\r\nnot least of all Priapus. But the Blemyes are accustomed also to\r\nsacrifice human beings to the sun. These sanctuaries in Philae were kept\r\nby these barbarians even up to my time, but the Emperor Justinian\r\ndecided to tear them down. Accordingly Narses, a Persarmenian by birth,\r\nwhom I have mentioned before as having deserted to the Romans[27], being\r\ncommander of the troops there, tore down the sanctuaries at the\r\nemperor's order, and put the priests under guard and sent the statues to\r\nByzantium. But I shall return to the previous narrative.\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nAt about the time of this war Hellestheaeus, the king of the\r\nAethiopians, who was a Christian and a most devoted adherent of this\r\nfaith, discovered that a number of the Homeritae on the opposite\r\nmainland were oppressing the Christians there outrageously; many of\r\nthese rascals were Jews, and many of them held in reverence the old\r\nfaith which men of the present day call Hellenic. He therefore collected\r\na fleet of ships and an army and came against them, and he conquered\r\nthem in battle and slew both the king and many of the Homeritae. He then\r\nset up in his stead a Christian king, a Homerite by birth, by name\r\nEsimiphaeus, and, after ordaining that he should pay a tribute to the\r\nAethiopians every year, he returned to his home. In this Aethiopian army\r\nmany slaves and all who were readily disposed to crime were quite\r\nunwilling to follow the king back, but were left behind and remained\r\nthere because of their desire for the land of the Homeritae; for it is\r\nan extremely goodly land.\r\n\r\nThese fellows at a time not long after this, in company with certain\r\nothers, rose against the king Esimiphaeus and put him in confinement in\r\none of the fortresses there, and established another king over the\r\nHomeritae, Abramus by name. Now this Abramus was a Christian, but a\r\nslave of a Roman citizen who was engaged in the business of shipping in\r\nthe city of Adulis in Aethiopia. When Hellestheaeus learned this, he was\r\neager to punish Abramus together with those who had revolted with him\r\nfor their injustice to Esimiphaeus, and he sent against them an army of\r\nthree thousand men with one of his relatives as commander. This army,\r\nonce there, was no longer willing to return home, but they wished to\r\nremain where they were in a goodly land, and so without the knowledge of\r\ntheir commander they opened negotiations with Abramus; then when they\r\ncame to an engagement with their opponents, just as the fighting began,\r\nthey killed their commander and joined the ranks of the enemy, and so\r\nremained there. But Hellestheaeus was greatly moved with anger and sent\r\nstill another army against them; this force engaged with Abramus and his\r\nmen, and, after suffering a severe defeat in the battle, straightway\r\nreturned home. Thereafter the king of the Aethiopians became afraid, and\r\nsent no further expeditions against Abramus. After the death of\r\nHellestheaeus, Abramus agreed to pay tribute to the king of the\r\nAethiopians who succeeded him, and in this way he strengthened his rule.\r\nBut this happened at a later time.\r\n\r\nAt that time, when Hellestheaeus was reigning over the Aethiopians, and\r\nEsimiphaeus over the Homeritae, the Emperor Justinian sent an\r\nambassador, Julianus, demanding that both nations on account of their\r\ncommunity of religion should make common cause with the Romans in the\r\nwar against the Persians; for he purposed that the Aethiopians, by\r\npurchasing silk from India and selling it among the Romans, might\r\nthemselves gain much money, while causing the Romans to profit in only\r\none way, namely, that they be no longer compelled to pay over their\r\nmoney to their enemy. (This is the silk of which they are accustomed to\r\nmake the garments which of old the Greeks called Medic, but which at the\r\npresent time they name \"seric\"[28]). As for the Homeritae, it was\r\ndesired that they should establish Caïsus, the fugitive, as captain over\r\nthe Maddeni, and with a great army of their own people and of the\r\nMaddene Saracens make an invasion into the land of the Persians. This\r\nCaïsus was by birth of the captain's rank and an exceptionally able\r\nwarrior, but he had killed one of the relatives of Esimiphaeus and was a\r\nfugitive in a land which is utterly destitute of human habitation. So\r\neach king, promising to put this demand into effect, dismissed the\r\nambassador, but neither one of them did the things agreed upon by them.\r\nFor it was impossible for the Aethiopians to buy silk from the Indians,\r\nfor the Persian merchants always locate themselves at the very harbours\r\nwhere the Indian ships first put in, (since they inhabit the adjoining\r\ncountry), and are accustomed to buy the whole cargoes; and it seemed to\r\nthe Homeritae a difficult thing to cross a country which was a desert\r\nand which extended so far that a long time was required for the journey\r\nacross it, and then to go against a people much more warlike than\r\nthemselves. Later on Abramus too, when at length he had established his\r\npower most securely, promised the Emperor Justinian many times to invade\r\nthe land of Persia, but only once began the journey and then straightway\r\nturned back. Such then were the relations which the Romans had with the\r\nAethiopians and the Homeritae.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nHermogenes, as soon as the battle on the Euphrates had taken place, came\r\nbefore Cabades to negotiate with him, but he accomplished nothing\r\nregarding the peace on account of which he had come, since he found him\r\nstill swelling with rage against the Romans; for this reason he returned\r\nunsuccessful. And Belisarius came to Byzantium at the summons of the\r\nemperor, having been removed from the office which he held, in order\r\nthat he might march against the Vandals; but Sittas, as had been decreed\r\nby the Emperor Justinian, went to the East in order to guard that\r\nportion of the empire. And the Persians once more invaded Mesopotamia\r\nwith a great army under command of Chanaranges and Aspebedes and\r\nMermeroes. Since no one dared to engage with them, they made camp and\r\nbegan the siege of Martyropolis, where Bouzes and Bessas had been\r\nstationed in command of the garrison. This city lies in the land called\r\nSophanene, two hundred and forty stades distant from the city of Amida\r\ntoward the north; it is just on the River Nymphius which divides the\r\nland of the Romans and the Persians. So the Persians began to assail the\r\nfortifications, and, while the besieged at first withstood them\r\nmanfully, it did not seem likely that they would hold out long. For the\r\ncircuit-wall was quite easily assailable in most parts, and could be\r\ncaptured very easily by a Persian siege, and besides they did not have a\r\nsufficient supply of provisions, nor indeed had they engines of war nor\r\nanything else that was of any value for defending themselves. Meanwhile\r\nSittas and the Roman army came to a place called Attachas, one hundred\r\nstades distant from Martyropolis, but they did not dare to advance\r\nfurther, but established their camp and remained there. Hermogenes also\r\nwas with them, coming again as ambassador from Byzantium. At this point\r\nthe following event took place.\r\n\r\nIt has been customary from ancient times both among the Romans and the\r\nPersians to maintain spies at public expense; these men are accustomed\r\nto go secretly among the enemy, in order that they may investigate\r\naccurately what is going on, and may then return and report to the\r\nrulers. Many of these men, as is natural, exert themselves to act in a\r\nspirit of loyalty to their nation, while some also betray their secrets\r\nto the enemy. At that time a certain spy who had been sent from the\r\nPersians to the Romans came into the presence of the Emperor Justinian\r\nand revealed many things which were taking place among the barbarians,\r\nand, in particular, that the nation of the Massagetae, in order to\r\ninjure the Romans, were on the very point of going out into the land of\r\nPersia, and that from there they were prepared to march into the\r\nterritory of the Romans, and unite with the Persian army. When the\r\nemperor heard this, having already a proof of the man's truthfulness to\r\nhim, he presented him with a handsome sum of money and persuaded him to\r\ngo to the Persian army which was besieging the Martyropolitans, and\r\nannounce to the barbarians there that these Massagetae had been won over\r\nwith money by the Roman emperor, and were about to come against them\r\nthat very moment. The spy carried out these instructions, and coming to\r\nthe army of the barbarians he announced to Chanaranges and the others\r\nthat an army of Huns hostile to them would at no distant time come to\r\nthe Romans. And when they heard this, they were seized with terror, and\r\nwere at a loss how to deal with the situation.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture it came about that Cabades became seriously ill, and he\r\ncalled to him one of the Persians who were in closest intimacy with him,\r\nMebodes by name, and conversed with him concerning Chosroes and the\r\nkingdom, and said he feared the Persians would make a serious attempt to\r\ndisregard some of the things which had been decided upon by him. But\r\nMebodes asked him to leave the declaration of his purpose in writing,\r\nand bade him be confident that the Persians would never dare to\r\ndisregard it. So Cabades set it down plainly that Chosroes should become\r\nking over the Persians. The document was written by Mebodes himself, and\r\nCabades immediately passed from among men. [Sept. 13, 531] And when\r\neverything had been performed as prescribed by law in the burial of the\r\nking, then Caoses, confident by reason of the law, tried to lay claim to\r\nthe office, but Mebodes stood in his way, asserting that no one ought to\r\nassume the royal power by his own initiative but by vote of the Persian\r\nnotables. So Caoses committed the decision in the matter to the\r\nmagistrates, supposing that there would be no opposition to him from\r\nthere. But when all the Persian notables had been gathered together for\r\nthis purpose and were in session, Mebodes read the document and stated\r\nthe purpose of Cabades regarding Chosroes, and all, calling to mind the\r\nvirtue of Cabades, straightway declared Chosroes King of the Persians.\r\n\r\nThus then Chosroes secured the power. But at Martyropolis, Sittas and\r\nHermogenes were in fear concerning the city, since they were utterly\r\nunable to defend it in its peril, and they sent certain men to the\r\nenemy, who came before the generals and spoke as follows: \"It has\r\nescaped your own notice that you are becoming wrongfully an obstacle to\r\nthe king of the Persians and to the blessings of peace and to each\r\nstate. For ambassadors sent from the emperor are even now present in\r\norder that they may go to the king of the Persians and there settle the\r\ndifferences and establish a treaty with him; but do you as quickly as\r\npossible remove from the land of the Romans and permit the ambassadors\r\nto act in the manner which will be of advantage to both peoples. For we\r\nare ready also to give as hostages men of repute concerning these very\r\nthings, to prove that they will be actually accomplished at no distant\r\ndate.\" Such were the words of the ambassadors of the Romans. It happened\r\nalso that a messenger came to them from the palace, who brought them\r\nword that Cabades had died and that Chosroes, son of Cabades, had become\r\nking over the Persians, and that in this way the situation had become\r\nunsettled. And as a result of this the generals heard the words of the\r\nRomans gladly, since they feared also the attack of the Huns. The Romans\r\ntherefore straightway gave as hostages Martinus and one of the\r\nbody-guards of Sittas, Senecius by name; so the Persians broke up the\r\nsiege and made their departure promptly. And the Huns not long afterward\r\ninvaded the land of the Romans, but since they did not find the Persian\r\narmy there, they made their raid a short one, and then all departed\r\nhomeward.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\nStraightway Rufinus and Alexander and Thomas came to act as ambassadors\r\nwith Hermogenes, and they all came before the Persian king at the River\r\nTigris. And when Chosroes saw them, he released the hostages. Then the\r\nambassadors coaxed Chosroes, and spoke many beguiling words most\r\nunbecoming to Roman ambassadors. By this treatment Chosroes became\r\ntractable, and agreed to establish a peace with them that should be\r\nwithout end for the price of one hundred and ten \"centenaria,\" on\r\ncondition that the commander of troops in Mesopotamia should be no\r\nlonger at Daras, but should spend all his time in Constantina, as was\r\ncustomary in former times; but the fortresses in Lazica he refused to\r\ngive back, although he himself demanded that he should receive back from\r\nthe Romans both Pharangium and the fortress of Bolum. (Now the\r\n\"centenarium\" weighs one hundred pounds, for which reason it is so\r\ncalled; for the Romans call one hundred \"centum\"). He demanded that this\r\ngold be given him, in order that the Romans might not be compelled\r\neither to tear down the city of Daras or to share the garrison at the\r\nCaspian Gates with the Persians[29]. However the ambassadors, while\r\napproving the rest, said that they were not able to concede the\r\nfortresses, unless they should first make enquiry of the emperor\r\nconcerning them. It was decided, accordingly, that Rufinus should be\r\nsent concerning them to Byzantium, and that the others should wait until\r\nhe should return. And it was arranged with Rufinus that seventy days'\r\ntime be allowed until he should arrive. When Rufinus reached Byzantium\r\nand reported to the emperor what Chosroes' decision was concerning the\r\npeace, the emperor commanded that the peace be concluded by them on\r\nthese terms.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, however, a report which was not true reached Persia\r\nsaying that the Emperor Justinian had become enraged and put Rufinus to\r\ndeath. Chosroes indeed was much perturbed by this, and, already filled\r\nwith anger, he advanced against the Romans with his whole army. But\r\nRufinus met him on the way as he was returning not far from the city of\r\nNisibis. Therefore they proceeded to this city themselves, and, since\r\nthey were about to establish the peace, the ambassadors began to convey\r\nthe money thither. But the Emperor Justinian was already repenting that\r\nhe had given up the strong holds of Lazica, and he wrote a letter to the\r\nambassadors expressly commanding them by no means to hand them over to\r\nthe Persians. For this reason Chosroes no longer saw fit to make the\r\ntreaty; and then it came to the mind of Rufinus that he had counselled\r\nmore speedily than safely in bringing the money into the land of Persia.\r\nStraightway, therefore, he threw himself on the earth, and lying prone\r\nhe entreated Chosroes to send the money back with them and not march\r\nimmediately against the Romans, but to put off the war to some other\r\ntime. And Chosroes bade him rise from the ground, promising that he\r\nwould grant all these things. So the ambassadors with the money came to\r\nDaras and the Persian army marched back.\r\n\r\nThen indeed the fellow-ambassadors of Rufinus began to regard him with\r\nextreme suspicion themselves, and they also denounced him to the\r\nemperor, basing their judgment on the fact that Chosroes had been\r\npersuaded to concede him everything which he asked of him. However, the\r\nemperor showed him no disfavour on account of this. At a time not long\r\nafter this Rufinus himself and Hermogenes were again sent to the court\r\nof Chosroes, and they immediately came to agreement with each other\r\nconcerning the treaty, subject to the condition that both sides should\r\ngive back all the places which each nation had wrested from the other in\r\nthat war, and that there should no longer be any military post in Daras;\r\nas for the Iberians, it was agreed that the decision rested with them\r\nwhether they should remain there in Byzantium or return to their own\r\nfatherland. And there were many who remained, and many also who returned\r\nto their ancestral homes. [532 A.D.] Thus, then, they concluded the\r\nso-called \"endless peace,\" when the Emperor Justinian was already in the\r\nsixth year of his reign. And the Romans gave the Persians Pharangium and\r\nthe fortress of Bolum together with the money, and the Persians gave the\r\nRomans the strongholds of Lazica. The Persians also returned Dagaris to\r\nthe Romans, and received in return for him another man of no mean\r\nstation. This Dagaris in later times often conquered the Huns in battle\r\nwhen they had invaded the land of the Romans, and drove them out; for he\r\nwas an exceptionally able warrior. Thus both sides in the manner\r\ndescribed made secure the treaty between them.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\nStraightway it came about that plots were formed against both rulers by\r\ntheir subjects; and I shall now explain how this happened. Chosroes, the\r\nson of Cabades, was a man of an unruly turn of mind and strangely fond\r\nof innovations. For this reason he himself was always full of excitement\r\nand alarms, and he was an unfailing cause of similar feelings in all\r\nothers. All, therefore, who were men of action among the Persians, in\r\nvexation at his administration, were purposing to establish over\r\nthemselves another king from the house of Cabades. And since they longed\r\nearnestly for the rule of Zames, which was made impossible by the law by\r\nreason of the disfigurement of his eye, as has been stated, they found\r\nupon consideration that the best course for them was to establish in\r\npower his child Cabades, who bore the same name as his grandfather,\r\nwhile Zames, as guardian of the child, should administer the affairs of\r\nthe Persians as he wished. So they went to Zames and disclosed their\r\nplan, and, urging him on with great enthusiasm, they endeavoured to\r\npersuade him to undertake the thing. And since the plan pleased him,\r\nthey were purposing to assail Chosroes at the fitting moment. But the\r\nplan was discovered and came to the knowledge of the king, and thus\r\ntheir proceedings were stopped. For Chosroes slew Zames himself and all\r\nhis own brothers and those of Zames together with all their male\r\noffspring, and also all the Persian notables who had either begun or\r\ntaken part in any way in the plot against him. Among these was\r\nAspebedes, the brother of Chosroes' mother.\r\n\r\nCabades, however, the son of Zames, he was quite unable to kill; for he\r\nwas still being reared under the chanaranges, Adergoudounbades. But he\r\nsent a message to the chanaranges, bidding him himself kill the boy he\r\nhad reared; for he neither thought it well to shew mistrust, nor yet had\r\nhe power to compel him. The chanaranges, therefore, upon hearing the\r\ncommands of Chosroes, was exceedingly grieved and, lamenting the\r\nmisfortune, he communicated to his wife and Cabades' nurse all that the\r\nking had commanded. Then the woman, bursting into tears and seizing the\r\nknees of her husband, entreated him by no means to kill Cabades. They\r\ntherefore consulted together, and planned to bring up the child in the\r\nmost secure concealment, and to send word in haste to Chosroes that\r\nCabades had been put out of the world for him. And they sent word to the\r\nking to this effect, and concealed Cabades in such a way that the affair\r\ndid not come to the notice of any one, except Varrames, their own child,\r\nand one of the servants who seemed to them to be in every way most\r\ntrustworthy. But when, as time went on, Cabades came of age, the\r\nchanaranges began to fear lest what had been done should be brought to\r\nlight; he therefore gave Cabades money and bade him depart and save\r\nhimself by flight wherever he could. At that time, then, Chosroes and\r\nall the others were in ignorance of the fact that the chanaranges had\r\ncarried this thing through.\r\n\r\nAt a later time Chosroes was making an invasion into the land of Colchis\r\nwith a great army, as will be told in the following narrative[30]. And\r\nhe was followed by the son of this same chanaranges, Varrames, who took\r\nwith him a number of his servants, and among them the one who shared\r\nwith him the knowledge of what had happened to Cabades; while there\r\nVarrames told the king everything regarding Cabades, and he brought\r\nforward the servant agreeing with him in every particular. When Chosroes\r\nlearned this he was forthwith exceedingly angry, and he counted it a\r\ndreadful thing that he had suffered such things at the hand of a man who\r\nwas his slave; and since he had no other means of getting the man under\r\nhis hand he devised the following plan. When he was about to return\r\nhomeward from the land of Colchis, he wrote to this chanaranges that he\r\nhad decided to invade the land of the Romans with his whole army, not,\r\nhowever, by a single inroad into the country, but making two divisions\r\nof the Persian army, in order that the attack might be made upon the\r\nenemy on both sides of the River Euphrates. Now one division of the army\r\nhe himself, as was natural, would lead into the hostile land, while to\r\nno one else of his subjects would he grant the privilege of holding\r\nequal honour with the king in this matter, except to the chanaranges\r\nhimself on account of his valour. It was necessary, therefore, that the\r\nchanaranges should come speedily to meet him as he returned, in order\r\nthat he might confer with him and give him all the directions which\r\nwould be of advantage to the army, and that he should bid his attendants\r\ntravel behind him on the road. When the chanaranges received this\r\nmessage, he was overjoyed at the honour shown him by the king, and in\r\ncomplete ignorance of his own evil plight, he immediately carried out\r\nthe instructions. But in the course of this journey, since he was quite\r\nunable to sustain the toil of it (for he was a very old man), he relaxed\r\nhis hold on the reins and fell off his horse, breaking the bone in his\r\nleg. It was therefore necessary for him to remain there quietly and be\r\ncared for, and the king came to that place and saw him. And Chosroes\r\nsaid to him that with his leg in such a plight it was not possible that\r\nhe make the expedition with them, but that he must go to one of the\r\nfortresses in that region and receive treatment there from the\r\nphysicians. Thus then Chosroes sent the man away on the road to death,\r\nand behind him followed the very men who were to destroy him in the\r\nfortress,--a man who was in fact as well as in name an invincible\r\ngeneral among the Persians, who had marched against twelve nations of\r\nbarbarians and subjected them all to King Cabades. After\r\nAdergoudounbades had been removed from the world, Varrames, his son,\r\nreceived the office of chanaranges. Not long after this either Cabades\r\nhimself, the son of Zames, or someone else who was assuming the name of\r\nCabades came to Byzantium; certainly he resembled very closely in\r\nappearance Cabades, the king. And the Emperor Justinian, though in doubt\r\nconcerning him, received him with great friendliness and honoured him as\r\nthe grandson of Cabades. So then fared the Persians who rose against\r\nChosroes.\r\n\r\nLater on Chosroes destroyed also Mebodes for the following reason. While\r\nthe king was arranging a certain important matter, he directed\r\nZaberganes who was present to call Mebodes. Now it happened that\r\nZaberganes was on hostile terms with Mebodes. When he came to him, he\r\nfound him marshalling the soldiers under his command, and he said that\r\nthe king summoned him to come as quickly as possible. And Mebodes\r\npromised that he would follow directly as soon as he should have\r\narranged the matter in hand; but Zaberganes, moved by his hostility to\r\nhim, reported to Chosroes that Mebodes did not wish to come at present,\r\nclaiming to have some business or other. Chosroes, therefore, moved with\r\nanger, sent one of his attendants commanding Mebodes to go to the\r\ntripod. Now as to what this is I shall explain forthwith. An iron tripod\r\nstands always before the palace; and whenever anyone of the Persians\r\nlearns that the king is angry with him, it is not right for such a man\r\nto flee for refuge to a sanctuary nor to go elsewhere, but he must seat\r\nhimself by this tripod and await the verdict of the king, while no one\r\nat all dares protect him. There Mebodes sat in pitiable plight for many\r\ndays, until he was seized and put to death at the command of Chosroes.\r\nSuch was the final outcome of his good deeds to Chosroes.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\n[Jan. 1, 532] At this same time an insurrection broke out unexpectedly\r\nin Byzantium among the populace, and, contrary to expectation, it proved\r\nto be a very serious affair, and ended in great harm to the people and\r\nto the senate, as the following account will shew. In every city the\r\npopulation has been divided for a long time past into the Blue and the\r\nGreen factions; but within comparatively recent times it has come about\r\nthat, for the sake of these names and the seats which the rival factions\r\noccupy in watching the games, they spend their money and abandon their\r\nbodies to the most cruel tortures, and even do not think it unworthy to\r\ndie a most shameful death. And they fight against their opponents\r\nknowing not for what end they imperil themselves, but knowing well that,\r\neven if they overcome their enemy in the fight, the conclusion of the\r\nmatter for them will be to be carried off straightway to the prison, and\r\nfinally, after suffering extreme torture, to be destroyed. So there\r\ngrows up in them against their fellow men a hostility which has no\r\ncause, and at no time does it cease or disappear, for it gives place\r\nneither to the ties of marriage nor of relationship nor of friendship,\r\nand the case is the same even though those who differ with respect to\r\nthese colours be brothers or any other kin. They care neither for things\r\ndivine nor human in comparison with conquering in these struggles; and\r\nit matters not whether a sacrilege is committed by anyone at all against\r\nGod, or whether the laws and the constitution are violated by friend or\r\nby foe; nay even when they are perhaps ill supplied with the necessities\r\nof life, and when their fatherland is in the most pressing need and\r\nsuffering unjustly, they pay no heed if only it is likely to go well\r\nwith their \"faction\"; for so they name the bands of partisans. And even\r\nwomen join with them in this unholy strife, and they not only follow the\r\nmen, but even resist them if opportunity offers, although they neither\r\ngo to the public exhibitions at all, nor are they impelled by any other\r\ncause; so that I, for my part, am unable to call this anything except a\r\ndisease of the soul. This, then, is pretty well how matters stand among\r\nthe people of each and every city.\r\n\r\nBut at this time the officers of the city administration in Byzantium\r\nwere leading away to death some of the rioters. But the members of the\r\ntwo factions, conspiring together and declaring a truce with each other,\r\nseized the prisoners and then straightway entered the prison and\r\nreleased all those who were in confinement there, whether they had been\r\ncondemned on a charge of stirring up sedition, or for any other unlawful\r\nact. And all the attendants in the service of the city government were\r\nkilled indiscriminately; meanwhile, all of the citizens who were\r\nsane-minded were fleeing to the opposite mainland, and fire was applied\r\nto the city as if it had fallen under the hand of an enemy. The\r\nsanctuary of Sophia and the baths of Zeuxippus, and the portion of the\r\nimperial residence from the propylaea as far as the so-called House of\r\nAres were destroyed by fire, and besides these both the great colonnades\r\nwhich extended as far as the market place which bears the name of\r\nConstantine, in addition to many houses of wealthy men and a vast amount\r\nof treasure. During this time the emperor and his consort with a few\r\nmembers of the senate shut themselves up in the palace and remained\r\nquietly there. Now the watch-word which the populace passed around to\r\none another was Nika[31], and the insurrection has been called by this\r\nname up to the present time.\r\n\r\nThe praetorian prefect at that time was John the Cappadocian, and\r\nTribunianus, a Pamphylian by birth, was counsellor to the emperor; this\r\nperson the Romans call \"quaestor.\" One of these two men, John, was\r\nentirely without the advantages of a liberal education; for he learned\r\nnothing while attending the elementary school except his letters, and\r\nthese, too, poorly enough; but by his natural ability he became the most\r\npowerful man of whom we know. For he was most capable in deciding upon\r\nwhat was needful and in finding a solution for difficulties. But he\r\nbecame the basest of all men and employed his natural power to further\r\nhis low designs; neither consideration for God nor any shame before man\r\nentered into his mind, but to destroy the lives of many men for the sake\r\nof gain and to wreck whole cities was his constant concern. So within a\r\nshort time indeed he had acquired vast sums of money, and he flung\r\nhimself completely into the sordid life of a drunken scoundrel; for up\r\nto the time of lunch each day he would plunder the property of his\r\nsubjects, and for the rest of the day occupy himself with drinking and\r\nwith wanton deeds of lust. And he was utterly unable to control himself,\r\nfor he ate food until he vomited, and he was always ready to steal money\r\nand more ready to bring it out and spend it. Such a man then was John.\r\nTribunianus, on the other hand, both possessed natural ability and in\r\neducational attainments was inferior to none of his contemporaries; but\r\nhe was extraordinarily fond of the pursuit of money and always ready to\r\nsell justice for gain; therefore every day, as a rule, he was repealing\r\nsome laws and proposing others, selling off to those who requested it\r\neither favour according to their need.\r\n\r\nNow as long as the people were waging this war with each other in behalf\r\nof the names of the colours, no attention was paid to the offences of\r\nthese men against the constitution; but when the factions came to a\r\nmutual understanding, as has been said, and so began the sedition, then\r\nopenly throughout the whole city they began to abuse the two and went\r\nabout seeking them to kill. Accordingly the emperor, wishing to win the\r\npeople to his side, instantly dismissed both these men from office. And\r\nPhocas, a patrician, he appointed praetorian prefect, a man of the\r\ngreatest discretion and fitted by nature to be a guardian of justice;\r\nBasilides he commanded to fill the office of quaestor, a man known among\r\nthe patricians for his agreeable qualities and a notable besides.\r\nHowever, the insurrection continued no less violently under them. Now on\r\nthe fifth day of the insurrection in the late afternoon the Emperor\r\nJustinian gave orders to Hypatius and Pompeius, nephews of the late\r\nemperor, Anastasius, to go home as quickly as possible, either because\r\nhe suspected that some plot was being matured by them against his own\r\nperson, or, it may be, because destiny brought them to this. But they\r\nfeared that the people would force them to the throne (as in fact fell\r\nout), and they said that they would be doing wrong if they should\r\nabandon their sovereign when he found himself in such danger. When the\r\nEmperor Justinian heard this, he inclined still more to his suspicion,\r\nand he bade them quit the palace instantly. Thus, then, these two men\r\nbetook themselves to their homes, and, as long as it was night, they\r\nremained there quietly.\r\n\r\nBut on the following day at sunrise it became known to the people that\r\nboth men had quit the palace where they had been staying. So the whole\r\npopulation ran to them, and they declared Hypatius emperor and prepared\r\nto lead him to the market-place to assume the power. But the wife of\r\nHypatius, Mary, a discreet woman, who had the greatest reputation for\r\nprudence, laid hold of her husband and would not let go, but cried out\r\nwith loud lamentation and with entreaties to all her kinsmen that the\r\npeople were leading him on the road to death. But since the throng\r\noverpowered her, she unwillingly released her husband, and he by no will\r\nof his own came to the Forum of Constantine, where they summoned him to\r\nthe throne; then since they had neither diadem nor anything else with\r\nwhich it is customary for a king to be clothed, they placed a golden\r\nnecklace upon his head and proclaimed him Emperor of the Romans. By this\r\ntime the members of the senate were assembling,--as many of them as had\r\nnot been left in the emperor's residence,--and many expressed the\r\nopinion that they should go to the palace to fight. But Origenes, a man\r\nof the senate, came forward and spoke as follows: \"Fellow Romans, it is\r\nimpossible that the situation which is upon us be solved in any way\r\nexcept by war. Now war and royal power are agreed to be the greatest of\r\nall things in the world. But when action involves great issues, it\r\nrefuses to be brought to a successful conclusion by the brief crisis of\r\na moment, but this is accomplished only by wisdom of thought and energy\r\nof action, which men display for a length of time. Therefore if we\r\nshould go out against the enemy, our cause will hang in the balance, and\r\nwe shall be taking a risk which will decide everything in a brief space\r\nof time; and, as regards the consequences of such action, we shall\r\neither fall down and worship Fortune or reproach her altogether. For\r\nthose things whose issue is most quickly decided, fall, as a rule, under\r\nthe sway of fortune. But if we handle the present situation more\r\ndeliberately, not even if we wish shall we be able to take Justinian in\r\nthe palace, but he will very speedily be thankful if he is allowed to\r\nflee; for authority which is ignored always loses its power, since its\r\nstrength ebbs away with each day. Moreover we have other palaces, both\r\nPlacillianae and the palace named from Helen, which this emperor should\r\nmake his headquarters and from there he should carry on the war and\r\nattend to the ordering of all other matters in the best possible way.\"\r\nSo spoke Origenes. But the rest, as a crowd is accustomed to do,\r\ninsisted more excitedly and thought that the present moment was\r\nopportune, and not least of all Hypatius (for it was fated that evil\r\nshould befall him) bade them lead the way to the hippodrome. But some\r\nsay that he came there purposely, being well-disposed toward the\r\nemperor.\r\n\r\nNow the emperor and his court were deliberating as to whether it would\r\nbe better for them if they remained or if they took to flight in the\r\nships. And many opinions were expressed favouring either course. And the\r\nEmpress Theodora also spoke to the following effect: \"As to the belief\r\nthat a woman ought not to be daring among men or to assert herself\r\nboldly among those who are holding back from fear, I consider that the\r\npresent crisis most certainly does not permit us to discuss whether the\r\nmatter should be regarded in this or in some other way. For in the case\r\nof those whose interests have come into the greatest danger nothing else\r\nseems best except to settle the issue immediately before them in the\r\nbest possible way. My opinion then is that the present time, above all\r\nothers, is inopportune for flight, even though it bring safety. For\r\nwhile it is impossible for a man who has seen the light not also to die,\r\nfor one who has been an emperor it is unendurable to be a fugitive. May\r\nI never be separated from this purple, and may I not live that day on\r\nwhich those who meet me shall not address me as mistress. If, now, it is\r\nyour wish to save yourself, O Emperor, there is no difficulty. For we\r\nhave much money, and there is the sea, here the boats. However consider\r\nwhether it will not come about after you have been saved that you would\r\ngladly exchange that safety for death. For as for myself, I approve a\r\ncertain ancient saying that royalty is a good burial-shroud.\" When the\r\nqueen had spoken thus, all were filled with boldness, and, turning their\r\nthoughts towards resistance, they began to consider how they might be\r\nable to defend themselves if any hostile force should come against them.\r\nNow the soldiers as a body, including those who were stationed about the\r\nemperor's court, were neither well disposed to the emperor nor willing\r\nopenly to take an active part in fighting, but were waiting for what the\r\nfuture would bring forth. All the hopes of the emperor were centred upon\r\nBelisarius and Mundus, of whom the former, Belisarius, had recently\r\nreturned from the Persian war bringing with him a following which was\r\nboth powerful and imposing, and in particular he had a great number of\r\nspearmen and guards who had received their training in battles and the\r\nperils of warfare. Mundus had been appointed general of the Illyrians,\r\nand by mere chance had happened to come under summons to Byzantium on\r\nsome necessary errand, bringing with him Erulian barbarians.\r\n\r\nWhen Hypatius reached the hippodrome, he went up immediately to where\r\nthe emperor is accustomed to take his place and seated himself on the\r\nroyal throne from which the emperor was always accustomed to view the\r\nequestrian and athletic contests. And from the palace Mundus went out\r\nthrough the gate which, from the circling descent, has been given the\r\nname of the Snail. Belisarius meanwhile began at first to go straight up\r\ntoward Hypatius himself and the royal throne, and when he came to the\r\nadjoining structure where there has been a guard of soldiers from of\r\nold, he cried out to the soldiers commanding them to open the door for\r\nhim as quickly as possible, in order that he might go against the\r\ntyrant. But since the soldiers had decided to support neither side,\r\nuntil one of them should be manifestly victorious, they pretended not to\r\nhear at all and thus put him off. So Belisarius returned to the emperor\r\nand declared that the day was lost for them, for the soldiers who\r\nguarded the palace were rebelling against him. The emperor therefore\r\ncommanded him to go to the so-called Bronze Gate and the propylaea\r\nthere. So Belisarius, with difficulty and not without danger and great\r\nexertion, made his way over ground covered by ruins and half-burned\r\nbuildings, and ascended to the stadium. And when he had reached the Blue\r\nColonnade which is on the right of the emperor's throne, he purposed to\r\ngo against Hypatius himself first; but since there was a small door\r\nthere which had been closed and was guarded by the soldiers of Hypatius\r\nwho were inside, he feared lest while he was struggling in the narrow\r\nspace the populace should fall upon him, and after destroying both\r\nhimself and all his followers, should proceed with less trouble and\r\ndifficulty against the emperor. Concluding, therefore, that he must go\r\nagainst the populace who had taken their stand in the hippodrome--a vast\r\nmultitude crowding each other in great disorder--he drew his sword from\r\nits sheath and, commanding the others to do likewise, with a shout he\r\nadvanced upon them at a run. But the populace, who were standing in a\r\nmass and not in order, at the sight of armoured soldiers who had a great\r\nreputation for bravery and experience in war, and seeing that they\r\nstruck out with their swords unsparingly, beat a hasty retreat. Then a\r\ngreat outcry arose, as was natural, and Mundus, who was standing not far\r\naway, was eager to join in the fight,--for he was a daring and energetic\r\nfellow--but he was at a loss as to what he should do under the\r\ncircumstances; when, however, he observed that Belisarius was in the\r\nstruggle, he straightway made a sally into the hippodrome through the\r\nentrance which they call the Gate of Death. Then indeed from both sides\r\nthe partisans of Hypatius were assailed with might and main and\r\ndestroyed. When the rout had become complete and there had already been\r\ngreat slaughter of the populace, Boraedes and Justus, nephews of the\r\nEmperor Justinian, without anyone daring to lift a hand against them,\r\ndragged Hypatius down from the throne, and, leading him in, handed him\r\nover together with Pompeius to the emperor. And there perished among the\r\npopulace on that day more than thirty thousand. But the emperor\r\ncommanded the two prisoners to be kept in severe confinement. Then,\r\nwhile Pompeius was weeping and uttering pitiable words (for the man was\r\nwholly inexperienced in such misfortunes), Hypatius reproached him at\r\nlength and said that those who were about to die unjustly should not\r\nlament. For in the beginning they had been forced by the people against\r\ntheir will, and afterwards they had come to the hippodrome with no\r\nthought of harming the emperor. And the soldiers killed both of them on\r\nthe following day and threw their bodies into the sea. The emperor\r\nconfiscated all their property for the public treasury, and also that of\r\nall the other members of the senate who had sided with them. Later,\r\nhowever, he restored to the children of Hypatius and Pompeius and to all\r\nothers the titles which they had formerly held, and as much of their\r\nproperty as he had not happened to bestow upon his friends. This was the\r\nend of the insurrection in Byzantium.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\nTribunianus and John were thus deprived of office, but at a later time\r\nthey were both restored to the same positions. And Tribunianus lived on\r\nin office many years and died of disease, suffering no further harm from\r\nanyone. For he was a smooth fellow and agreeable in every way and well\r\nable by the excellence of his education to throw into the shade his\r\naffliction of avarice. But John was oppressive and severe alike with all\r\nmen, inflicting blows upon those whom he met and plundering without\r\nrespect absolutely all their money; consequently in the tenth year of\r\nhis office he rightly and justly atoned for his lawless conduct in the\r\nfollowing manner.\r\n\r\nThe Empress Theodora hated him above all others. And while he gave\r\noffence to the woman by the wrongs he committed, he was not of a mind to\r\nwin her by flattery or by kindness in any way, but he openly set himself\r\nin opposition to her and kept slandering her to the emperor, neither\r\nblushing before her high station nor feeling shame because of the\r\nextraordinary love which the emperor felt for her. When the queen\r\nperceived what was being done, she purposed to slay the man, but in no\r\nway could she do this, since the Emperor Justinian set great store by\r\nhim. And when John learned of the purpose of the queen regarding him, he\r\nwas greatly terrified. And whenever he went into his chamber to sleep,\r\nhe expected every night that some one of the barbarians would fall upon\r\nhim to slay him; and he kept peeping out of the room and looking about\r\nthe entrances and remained sleepless, although he had attached to\r\nhimself many thousands of spearmen and guards, a thing which had been\r\ngranted to no prefect before that time. But at daybreak, forgetting all\r\nhis fears of things divine and human, he would become again a plague to\r\nall the Romans both in public and in private. And he conversed commonly\r\nwith sorcerers, and constantly listened to profane oracles which\r\nportended for him the imperial office, so that he was plainly walking on\r\nair and lifted up by his hopes of the royal power. But in his rascality\r\nand the lawlessness of his conduct there was no moderation or abatement.\r\nAnd there was in him absolutely no regard for God, and even when he went\r\nto a sanctuary to pray and to pass the night, he did not do at all as\r\nthe Christians are wont to do, but he clothed himself in a coarse\r\ngarment appropriate to a priest of the old faith which they are now\r\naccustomed to call Hellenic, and throughout that whole night mumbled out\r\nsome unholy words which he had practised, praying that the mind of the\r\nemperor might be still more under his control, and that he himself might\r\nbe free from harm at the hands of all men.\r\n\r\nAt this time Belisarius, after subjugating Italy, came to Byzantium at\r\nthe summons of the emperor with his wife Antonina, in order to march\r\nagainst the Persians[32]. And while in the eyes of all others he was an\r\nhonoured and distinguished person, as was natural, John alone was\r\nhostile to him and worked actively against him, for no other reason than\r\nthat he drew the hatred of all to himself, while Belisarius enjoyed an\r\nunequalled popularity. And it was on him that the hope of the Romans\r\ncentred as he marched once more against the Persians, leaving his wife\r\nin Byzantium. Now Antonina, the wife of Belisarius, (for she was the\r\nmost capable person in the world to contrive the impossible,) purposing\r\nto do a favour to the empress, devised the following plan. John had a\r\ndaughter, Euphemia, who had a great reputation for discretion, but a\r\nvery young woman and for this reason very susceptible; this girl was\r\nexceedingly loved by her father, for she was his only child. By treating\r\nthis young woman kindly for several days Antonina succeeded most\r\ncompletely in winning her friendship, and she did not refuse to share\r\nher secrets with her. And on one occasion when she was present alone\r\nwith her in her room she pretended to lament the fate which was upon\r\nher, saying that although Belisarius had made the Roman empire broader\r\nby a goodly measure than it had been before, and though he had brought\r\ntwo captive kings and so great an amount of wealth to Byzantium, he\r\nfound Justinian ungrateful; and in other respects she slandered the\r\ngovernment as not just. Now Euphemia was overjoyed by these words, for\r\nshe too was hostile to the present administration by reason of her fear\r\nof the empress, and she said: \"And yet, dearest friend, it is you and\r\nBelisarius who are to blame for this, seeing that, though you have\r\nopportunity, you are not willing to use your power.\" And Antonina\r\nreplied quickly: \"It is because we are not able, my daughter, to\r\nundertake revolutions in camp, unless some of those here at home join\r\nwith us in the task. Now if your father were willing, we should most\r\neasily organize this project and accomplish whatever God wills.\" When\r\nEuphemia heard this, she promised eagerly that the suggestion would be\r\ncarried out, and departing from there she immediately brought the matter\r\nbefore her father. And he was pleased by the message (for he inferred\r\nthat this undertaking offered him a way to the fulfilment of his\r\nprophecies and to the royal power), and straightway without any\r\nhesitation he assented, and bade his child arrange that on the following\r\nday he himself should come to confer with Antonina and give pledges.\r\nWhen Antonina learned the mind of John, she wished to lead him as far as\r\npossible astray from the understanding of the truth, so she said that\r\nfor the present it was inadvisable that he should meet her, for fear\r\nlest some suspicion should arise strong enough to prevent proceedings;\r\nbut she was intending straightway to depart for the East to join\r\nBelisarius. When, therefore, she had quit Byzantium and had reached the\r\nsuburb (the one called Rufinianae which was the private possession of\r\nBelisarius), there John should come as if to salute her and to escort\r\nher forth on the journey, and they should confer regarding matters of\r\nstate and give and receive their pledges. In saying this she seemed to\r\nJohn to speak well, and a certain day was appointed to carry out the\r\nplan. And the empress, hearing the whole account from Antonina,\r\nexpressed approval of what she had planned, and by her exhortations\r\nraised her enthusiasm to a much higher pitch still.\r\n\r\nWhen the appointed day was at hand, Antonina bade the empress farewell\r\nand departed from the city, and she went to Rufinianae, as if to begin\r\non the following day her journey to the East; hither too came John at\r\nnight in order to carry out the plan which had been agreed upon.\r\nMeanwhile the empress denounced to her husband the things which were\r\nbeing done by John to secure the tyranny, and she sent Narses, the\r\neunuch, and Marcellus, the commander of the palace guards to Rufinianae\r\nwith numerous soldiers, in order that they might investigate what was\r\ngoing on, and, if they found John setting about a revolution, that they\r\nmight kill the man forthwith and return. So these departed for this\r\ntask. But they say that the emperor got information of what was being\r\ndone and sent one of John's friends to him forbidding him on any\r\ncondition to meet Antonina secretly. But John (since it was fated that\r\nhe should fare ill), disregarding the emperor's warning, about midnight\r\nmet Antonina, close by a certain wall behind which she had stationed\r\nNarses and Marcellus with their men that they might hear what was said.\r\nThere, while John with unguarded tongue was assenting to the plans for\r\nthe attack and binding himself with the most dread oaths, Narses and\r\nMarcellus suddenly set upon him. But in the natural confusion which\r\nresulted the body-guards of John (for they stood close by) came\r\nimmediately to his side. And one of them smote Marcellus with his sword,\r\nnot knowing who he was, and thus John was enabled to escape with them,\r\nand reached the city with all speed. And if he had had the courage to go\r\nstraightway before the emperor, I believe that he would have suffered no\r\nharm at his hand; but as it was, he fled for refuge to the sanctuary,\r\nand gave the empress opportunity to work her will against him at her\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n[May, 541] Thus, then, from being prefect he became a private citizen,\r\nand rising from that sanctuary he was conveyed to another, which is\r\nsituated in the suburb of the city of Cyzicus called by the Cyzicenes\r\nArtace. There he donned the garb of a priest, much against his will, not\r\na bishop's gown however, but that of a presbyter, as they are called.\r\nBut he was quite unwilling to perform the office of a priest lest at\r\nsome time it should be a hindrance to his entering again into office;\r\nfor he was by no means ready to relinquish his hopes. All his property\r\nwas immediately confiscated to the public treasury, but a large\r\nproportion of this the emperor remitted to him, for he was still\r\ninclined to spare him. There it was possible for John to live,\r\ndisregarding all dangers and enjoying great wealth, both that which he\r\nhimself had concealed and that which by the decision of the emperor\r\nremained with him, and to indulge in luxury at his pleasure, and, if he\r\nhad reasoned wisely, to consider his present lot a happy one. For this\r\nreason all the Romans were exceedingly vexed with the man, because,\r\nforsooth, after proving himself the basest of all demons, contrary to\r\nhis deserts he was leading a life happier than before. But God, I think,\r\ndid not suffer John's retribution to end thus, but prepared for him a\r\ngreater punishment. And it fell out thus.\r\n\r\nThere was in Cyzicus a certain bishop named Eusebius, a man harsh to all\r\nwho came in his way, and no less so than John; this man the Cyzicenes\r\ndenounced to the emperor and summoned to justice. And since they\r\naccomplished nothing inasmuch as Eusebius circumvented them by his great\r\npower, certain youths agreed together and killed him in the market-place\r\nof Cyzicus. Now it happened that John had become especially hostile to\r\nEusebius, and hence the suspicion of the plot fell upon him. Accordingly\r\nmen were sent from the senate to investigate this act of pollution. And\r\nthese men first confined John in a prison, and then this man who had\r\nbeen such a powerful prefect, and had been inscribed among the\r\npatricians and had mounted the seat of the consuls, than which nothing\r\nseems greater, at least in the Roman state, they made to stand naked\r\nlike any robber or footpad, and thrashing him with many blows upon his\r\nback, compelled him to tell his past life. And while John had not been\r\nclearly convicted as guilty of the murder of Eusebius, it seemed that\r\nGod's justice was exacting from him the penalties of the world.\r\nThereafter they stripped him of all his goods and put him naked on board\r\na ship, being wrapped in a single cloak, and that a very rough one\r\npurchased for some few obols; and wherever the ship anchored, those who\r\nhad him in charge commanded him to ask from those he met bread or obols.\r\nThus begging everywhere along the way he was conveyed to the city of\r\nAntinous in Aegypt. And this is now the third year during which they\r\nhave been guarding him there in confinement. As for John himself,\r\nalthough he has fallen into such troubles, he has not relinquished his\r\nhope of royal power, but he made up his mind to denounce certain\r\nAlexandrians as owing money to the public treasury. Thus then John the\r\nCappadocian ten years afterward was overtaken by this punishment for his\r\npolitical career.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI\r\n\r\nAt that time the Emperor again designated Belisarius General of the\r\nEast, and, sending him to Libya, gained over the country, as will be\r\ntold later on in my narrative. When this information came to Chosroes\r\nand the Persians, they were mightily vexed, and they already repented\r\nhaving made peace with the Romans, because they perceived that their\r\npower was extending greatly. And Chosroes sent envoys to Byzantium, and\r\nsaid that he rejoiced with the Emperor Justinian, and he asked with a\r\nlaugh to receive his share of the spoils from Libya, on the ground that\r\nthe emperor would never have been able to conquer in the war with the\r\nVandals if the Persians had not been at peace with him. So then\r\nJustinian made a present of money to Chosroes, and not long afterwards\r\ndismissed the envoys.\r\n\r\nIn the city of Daras the following event took place. There was a certain\r\nJohn there serving in a detachment of infantry; this man, in conspiracy\r\nwith some few of the soldiers, but not all, took possession of the city,\r\nessaying to make himself tyrant. Then he established himself in a palace\r\nas if in a citadel, and was strengthening his tyranny every day. And if\r\nit had not happened that the Persians were continuing to keep peace with\r\nthe Romans, irreparable harm would have come from this affair to the\r\nRomans. But as it was, this was prevented by the agreement which had\r\nalready been reached, as I have said. On the fourth day of the tyranny\r\nsome soldiers conspired together, and by the advice of Mamas, the priest\r\nof the city, and Anastasius, one of the notable citizens, they went up\r\nto the palace at high noon, each man hiding a small sword under his\r\ngarment. And first at the door of the courtyard they found some few of\r\nthe body-guards, whom they slew immediately. Then they entered the men's\r\napartment and laid hold upon the tyrant; but some say that the soldiers\r\nwere not the first to do this, but that while they were still hesitating\r\nin the courtyard and trembling at the danger, a certain sausage-vendor\r\nwho was with them rushed in with his cleaver and meeting John smote him\r\nunexpectedly. But the blow which had been dealt him was not a fatal one,\r\nthis account goes on to say, and he fled with a great outcry and\r\nsuddenly fell among these very soldiers. Thus they laid hands upon the\r\nman and immediately set fire to the palace and burned it, in order that\r\nthere might be left no hope from there for those making revolutions; and\r\nJohn they led away to the prison and bound. And one of them, fearing\r\nlest the soldiers, upon learning that the tyrant survived, might again\r\nmake trouble for the city, killed John, and in this way stopped the\r\nconfusion. Such, then, was the progress of events touching this tyranny.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1]\r\n\r\nCf. _Iliad_ xi. 385 [Greek: toxota, lôbêtêr, kerai aglae, parthenopipa],\r\nthe only place where [Greek: toxotês] occurs in Homer.\r\n\r\n[2]\r\n\r\nCf. _Iliad_ v. 192.\r\n\r\n[3]\r\n\r\nCf. _Iliad_ viii. 267; xi. 371.\r\n\r\n[4]\r\n\r\nCf. _Iliad_ iv. 113.\r\n\r\n[5]\r\n\r\nCf. _Iliad_ iv. 123.\r\n\r\n[6]\r\n\r\nCf. _Iliad_ xi. 390.\r\n\r\n[7]\r\n\r\nThe trench crossed the plain in an approximately straight line.

And he\r\nconferred with Alamoundaras concerning this matter and commanded him to\r\nprovide causes for war. So Alamoundaras brought against Arethas, the\r\ncharge that he, Arethas, was doing him violence in a matter of boundary\r\nlines, and he entered into conflict with him in time of peace, and began\r\nto overrun the land of the Romans on this pretext. And he declared that,\r\nas for him, he was not breaking the treaty between the Persians and\r\nRomans, for neither one of them had included him in it. And this was\r\ntrue. For no mention of Saracens was ever made in treaties, on the\r\nground that they were included under the names of Persians and Romans.\r\nNow this country which at that time was claimed by both tribes of\r\nSaracens[1] is called Strata, and extends to the south of the city of\r\nPalmyra; nowhere does it produce a single tree or any of the useful\r\ngrowth of corn-lands, for it is burned exceedingly dry by the sun, but\r\nfrom of old it has been devoted to the pasturage of some few flocks. Now\r\nArethas maintained that the place belonged to the Romans, proving his\r\nassertion by the name which has long been applied to it by all (for\r\nStrata signifies \"a paved road\" in the Latin tongue), and he also\r\nadduced the testimonies of men of the oldest times. Alamoundaras,\r\nhowever, was by no means inclined to quarrel concerning the name, but he\r\nclaimed that tribute had been given him from of old for the pasturage\r\nthere by the owners of the flocks. The Emperor Justinian therefore\r\nentrusted the settlement of the disputed points to Strategius; a\r\npatrician and administrator of the royal treasures, and besides a man of\r\nwisdom and of good ancestry, and with him Summus, who had commanded the\r\ntroops in Palestine. This Summus was the brother of Julian, who not long\r\nbefore had served as envoy to the Aethiopians and Homeritae. And the one\r\nof them, Summus, insisted that the Romans ought not to surrender the\r\ncountry, but Strategius begged of the emperor that he should not do the\r\nPersians the favour of providing them with pretexts for the war which\r\nthey already desired, for the sake of a small bit of land and one of\r\nabsolutely no account, but altogether unproductive and unsuitable for\r\ncrops. The Emperor Justinian, therefore, took the matter under\r\nconsideration, and a long time was spent in the settlement of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nBut Chosroes, the King of the Persians, claimed that the treaty had been\r\nbroken by Justinian, who had lately displayed great opposition to his\r\nhouse, in that he had attempted in time of peace to attach Alamoundaras\r\nto himself. For, as he said, Summus, who had recently gone to the\r\nSaracen ostensibly to arrange matters, had hoodwinked him by promises of\r\nlarge sums of money on condition that he should join the Romans, and he\r\nbrought forward a letter which, he alleged, the Emperor Justinian had\r\nwritten to Alamoundaras concerning these things. He also declared that\r\nhe had sent a letter to some of the Huns, in which he urged them to\r\ninvade the land of the Persians and to do extensive damage to the\r\ncountry thereabout. This letter he asserted to have been put into his\r\nhands by the Huns themselves who had come before him. So then Chosroes,\r\nwith these charges against the Romans, was purposing to break off the\r\ntreaty. But as to whether he was speaking the truth in these matters, I\r\nam not able to say.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAt this point Vittigis, the leader of the Goths, already worsted in the\r\nwar, sent two envoys to him to persuade him to march against the Romans;\r\nbut the men whom he sent were not Goths, in order that the real\r\ncharacter of the embassy might not be at once obvious and so make\r\nnegotiations useless, but Ligurian priests who were attracted to this\r\nenterprise by rich gifts of money. One of these men, who seemed to be\r\nthe more worthy, undertook the embassy assuming the pretended name of\r\nbishop which did not belong to him at all, while the other followed as\r\nhis attendant. And when in the course of the journey they came to the\r\nland of Thrace, they attached to themselves a man from there to be an\r\ninterpreter of the Syriac and the Greek tongues, and without being\r\ndetected by any of the Romans, they reached the land of Persia. For\r\ninasmuch as they were at peace, they were not keeping a strict guard\r\nover that region. And coming before Chosroes they spoke as follows: \"It\r\nis true, O King, that all other envoys undertake their task for the sake\r\nof advantages to themselves as a rule, but we have been sent by\r\nVittigis, the king of the Goths and the Italians, in order to speak in\r\nbehalf of thy kingdom; and consider that he is now present before thee\r\nspeaking these words. If anyone should say, O King, putting all in a\r\nword, that thou hast given up thy kingdom and all men everywhere to\r\nJustinian, he would be speaking correctly. For since he is by nature a\r\nmeddler and a lover of those things which in no way belong to him, and\r\nis not able to abide by the settled order of things, he has conceived\r\nthe desire of seizing upon the whole earth, and has become eager to\r\nacquire for himself each and every state. Accordingly (since he was\r\nneither able alone to assail the Persians, nor with the Persians\r\nopposing him to proceed against the others), he decided to deceive thee\r\nwith the pretence of peace, and by forcing the others to subjection to\r\nacquire mighty forces against thy state. Therefore, after having already\r\ndestroyed the kingdom of the Vandals and subjugated the Moors, while the\r\nGoths because of their friendship stood aside for him, he has come\r\nagainst us bringing vast sums of money and many men. Now it is evident\r\nthat, if he is able also to crush the Goths utterly, he will with us and\r\nthose already enslaved march against the Persians, neither considering\r\nthe name of friendship nor blushing before any of his sworn promises.\r\nWhile, therefore, some hope of safety is still left thee, do not do us\r\nany further wrong nor suffer it thyself, but see in our misfortunes what\r\nwill a little later befall the Persians; and consider that the Romans\r\ncould never be well-disposed to thy kingdom, and that when they become\r\nmore powerful, they will not hesitate at all to display their enmity\r\ntoward the Persians. Use, therefore, this good chance while the time\r\nfits, lest thou seek for it after it has ceased. For when once the time\r\nof opportunity has passed, it is not its nature to return again. And it\r\nis better by anticipating to be in security, than by delaying beyond the\r\nopportune time to suffer the most miserable fate possible at the hands\r\nof the enemy.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Chosroes heard this, it seemed to him that Vittigis advised well,\r\nand he was still more eager to break off the treaty. For, moved as he\r\nwas by envy toward the Emperor Justinian, he neglected completely to\r\nconsider that the words were spoken to him by men who were bitter\r\nenemies of Justinian. But because he wished the thing he willingly\r\nconsented to be persuaded. And he did the very same thing a little later\r\nin the case of the addresses of the Armenians and of the Lazi, which\r\nwill be spoken of directly. And yet they were bringing as charges\r\nagainst Justinian the very things which would naturally be encomiums for\r\na worthy monarch, namely that he was exerting himself to make his realm\r\nlarger and much more splendid. For these accusations one might make also\r\nagainst Cyrus, the King of the Persians, and Alexander, the Macedonian.\r\nBut justice is never accustomed to dwell together with envy. For these\r\nreasons, then, Chosroes was purposing to break off the treaty.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAt this same time another event also occurred; it was as follows. That\r\nSymeon who had given Pharangium into the hands of the Romans persuaded\r\nthe Emperor Justinian, while the war was still at its height, to present\r\nhim with certain villages of Armenia. And becoming master of these\r\nplaces, he was plotted against and murdered by those who had formerly\r\npossessed them. After this crime had been committed, the perpetrators of\r\nthe murder fled into the land of Persia. They were two brothers, sons of\r\nPerozes. And when the Emperor heard this, he gave over the villages to\r\nAmazaspes, the nephew of Symeon, and appointed him ruler over the\r\nArmenians. This Amazaspes, as time went on, was denounced to the Emperor\r\nJustinian by one of his friends, Acacius by name, on the ground that he\r\nwas abusing the Armenians and wished to give over to the Persians\r\nTheodosiopolis and certain other fortresses. After telling this,\r\nAcacius, by the emperor's will, slew Amazaspes treacherously, and\r\nhimself secured the command over the Armenians by the gift of the\r\nemperor. And being base by nature, he gained the opportunity of\r\ndisplaying his inward character, and he proved to be the most cruel of\r\nall men toward his subjects. For he plundered their property without\r\nexcuse and ordained that they should pay an unheard-of tax of four\r\ncentenaria[2]. But the Armenians, unable to bear him any longer,\r\nconspired together and slew Acacius and fled for refuge to Pharangium.\r\n\r\nTherefore the emperor sent Sittas against them from Byzantium. For\r\nSittas had been delaying there since the time when the treaty was made\r\nwith the Persians. So he came to Armenia, but at first he entered upon\r\nthe war reluctantly and exerted himself to calm the people and to\r\nrestore the population to their former habitations, promising to\r\npersuade the emperor to remit to them the payment of the new tax. But\r\nsince the emperor kept assailing him with frequent reproaches for his\r\nhesitation, led on by the slanders of Adolius, the son of Acacius,\r\nSittas at last made his preparations for the conflict. First of all he\r\nattempted by means of promises of many good things to win over some of\r\nthe Armenians by persuasion and to attach them to his cause, in order\r\nthat the task of overpowering the others might be attended with less\r\ndifficulty and toil. And the tribe called the Aspetiani, great in power\r\nand in numbers, was willing to join him. And they went to Sittas and\r\nbegged him to give them pledges in writing that, if they abandoned their\r\nkinsmen in the battle and came to the Roman army, they should remain\r\nentirely free from harm, retaining their own possessions. Now Sittas was\r\ndelighted and wrote to them in tablets, giving them pledges just as they\r\ndesired of him; he then sealed the writing and sent it to them. Then,\r\nconfident that by their help he would be victorious in the war without\r\nfighting, he went with his whole army to a place called Oenochalakon,\r\nwhere the Armenians had their camp. But by some chance those who carried\r\nthe tablets went by another road and did not succeed at all in meeting\r\nthe Aspetiani. Moreover a portion of the Roman army happened upon some\r\nfew of them, and not knowing the agreement which had been made, treated\r\nthem as enemies. And Sittas himself caught some of their women and\r\nchildren in a cave and slew them, either because he did not understand\r\nwhat had happened or because he was angry with the Aspetiani for not\r\njoining him as had been agreed.\r\n\r\nBut they, being now possessed with anger, arrayed themselves for battle\r\nwith all the rest. But since both armies were on exceedingly difficult\r\nground where precipices abounded, they did not fight in one place, but\r\nscattered about among the ridges and ravines. So it happened that some\r\nfew of the Armenians and Sittas with not many of his followers came\r\nclose upon each other, with only a ravine lying between them. Both\r\nparties were horsemen. Then Sittas with a few men following him crossed\r\nthe ravine and advanced against the enemy; the Armenians, after\r\nwithdrawing to the rear, stopped, and Sittas pursued no further but\r\nremained where he was. Suddenly someone from the Roman army, an Erulian\r\nby birth, who had been pursuing the enemy, returning impetuously from\r\nthem came up to Sittas and his men. Now as it happened Sittas had\r\nplanted his spear in the ground; and the Erulian's horse fell upon this\r\nwith a great rush and shattered it. And the general was exceedingly\r\nannoyed by this, and one of the Armenians, seeing him, recognized him\r\nand declared to all the others that it was Sittas. For it happened that\r\nhe had no helmet on his head. Thus it did not escape the enemy that he\r\nhad come there with only a few men. Sittas, then, upon hearing the\r\nArmenian say this, since his spear, as has been said, lay broken in two\r\non the ground, drew his sword and attempted immediately to recross the\r\nravine. But the enemy advanced upon him with great eagerness, and a\r\nsoldier overtaking him in the ravine struck him a glancing blow with his\r\nsword on the top of his head; and he took off the whole scalp, but the\r\nsteel did not injure the bone at all. And Sittas continued to press\r\nforward still more than before, but Artabanes, son of John of the\r\nArsacidae, fell upon him from behind and with a thrust of his spear\r\nkilled him. Thus Sittas was removed from the world after no notable\r\nfashion, in a manner unworthy of his valour and his continual\r\nachievements against the enemy, a man who was extremely handsome in\r\nappearance and a capable warrior, and a general second to none of his\r\ncontemporaries. But some say that Sittas did not die at the hand of\r\nArtabanes, but that Solomon, a very insignificant man among the\r\nArmenians, destroyed him.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Sittas the emperor commanded Bouzes to go against the\r\nArmenians; and he, upon drawing near, sent to them promising to effect a\r\nreconciliation between the emperor and all the Armenians, and asking\r\nthat some of their notables should come to confer with him on these\r\nmatters. Now the Armenians as a whole were unable to trust Bouzes nor\r\nwere they willing to receive his proposals. But there was a certain man\r\nof the Arsacidae who was especially friendly with him, John by name, the\r\nfather of Artabanes, and this man, trusting in Bouzes as his friend came\r\nto him with his son-in-law, Bassaces, and a few others; but when these\r\nmen had reached the spot where they were to meet Bouzes on the following\r\nday, and had made their bivouac there, they perceived that they had come\r\ninto a place surrounded by the Roman army. Bassaces, the son-in-law,\r\ntherefore earnestly entreated John to fly. And since he was not able to\r\npersuade him, he left him there alone, and in company with all the\r\nothers eluded the Romans, and went back again by the same road. And\r\nBouzes found John alone and slew him; and since after this the Armenians\r\nhad no hope of ever reaching an agreement with the Romans, and since\r\nthey were unable to prevail over the emperor in war, they came before\r\nthe Persian king led by Bassaces, an energetic man. And the leading men\r\namong them came at that time into the presence of Chosroes and spoke as\r\nfollows: \"Many of us, O Master, are Arsacidae, descendants of that\r\nArsaces who was not unrelated to the Parthian kings when the Persian\r\nrealm lay under the hand of the Parthians, and who proved himself an\r\nillustrious king, inferior to none of his time. Now we have come to\r\nthee, and all of us have become slaves and fugitives, not, however, of\r\nour own will, but under most hard constraint, as it might seem by reason\r\nof the Roman power, but in truth, O King, by reason of thy\r\ndecision,--if, indeed, he who gives the strength to those who wish to do\r\ninjustice should himself justly bear also the blame of their misdeeds.\r\nNow we shall begin our account from a little distance back in order that\r\nyou may be able to follow the whole course of events. Arsaces, the last\r\nking of our ancestors, abdicated his throne willingly in favour of\r\nTheodosius, the Roman Emperor, on condition that all who should belong\r\nto his family through all time should live unhampered in every respect,\r\nand in particular should in no case be subject to taxation. And we have\r\npreserved the agreement, until you, the Persians, made this much-vaunted\r\ntreaty, which, as we think, one would not err in calling a sort of\r\ncommon destruction. For from that time, disregarding friend and foe, he\r\nwho is in name thy friend, O King, but in fact thy enemy, has turned\r\neverything in the world upside down and wrought complete confusion. And\r\nthis thou thyself shalt know at no distant time, as soon as he is able\r\nto subdue completely the people of the West. For what thing which was\r\nbefore forbidden has he not done? or what thing which was well\r\nestablished has he not disturbed? Did he not ordain for us the payment\r\nof a tax which did not exist before, and has he not enslaved our\r\nneighbours, the Tzani, who were autonomous, and has he not set over the\r\nking of the wretched Lazi a Roman magistrate?--an act neither in keeping\r\nwith the natural order of things nor very easy to explain in words. Has\r\nhe not sent generals to the men of Bosporus, the subjects of the Huns,\r\nand attached to himself the city which in no way belongs to him, and has\r\nhe not made a defensive alliance with the Aethiopian kingdoms, of which\r\nthe Romans had never even heard? More than this he has made the\r\nHomeritae his possession and the Red Sea, and he is adding the Palm\r\nGroves to the Roman dominion. We omit to speak of the fate of the\r\nLibyans and of the Italians. The whole earth is not large enough for the\r\nman; it is too small a thing for him to conquer all the world together.\r\nBut he is even looking about the heavens and is searching the retreats\r\nbeyond the ocean, wishing to gain for himself some other world. Why,\r\ntherefore, O King, dost thou still delay? Why dost thou respect that\r\nmost accursed peace, in order forsooth that he may make thee the last\r\nmorsel of all? If it is thy wish to learn what kind of a man Justinian\r\nwould shew himself toward those who yield to him, the example is to be\r\nsought near at hand from ourselves and from the wretched Lazi; and if\r\nthou wishest to see how he is accustomed to treat those who are unknown\r\nto him and who have done him not the least wrong, consider the Vandals\r\nand the Goths and the Moors. But the chief thing has not yet been\r\nspoken. Has he not made efforts in time of peace to win over by\r\ndeception thy slave, Alamoundaras, O most mighty King, and to detach him\r\nfrom thy kingdom, and has he not striven recently to attach to himself\r\nthe Huns who are utterly unknown to him, in order to make trouble for\r\nthee? And yet an act more strange than this has not been performed in\r\nall time. For since he perceived, as I think, that the overthrow of the\r\nwestern world would speedily be accomplished, he has already taken in\r\nhand to assail you of the East, since the Persian power alone has been\r\nleft for him to grapple with. The peace, therefore, as far as concerns\r\nhim, has already been broken for thee, and he himself has set an end to\r\nthe endless peace. For they break the peace, not who may be first in\r\narms, but they who may be caught plotting against their neighbours in\r\ntime of peace. For the crime has been committed by him who attempts it,\r\neven though success be lacking. Now as for the course which the war will\r\nfollow, this is surely clear to everyone. For it is not those who\r\nfurnish causes for war, but those who defend themselves against those\r\nwho furnish them, who are accustomed always to conquer their enemies.\r\nNay more, the contest will not be evenly matched for us even in point of\r\nstrength. For, as it happens, the majority of the Roman soldiers are at\r\nthe end of the world, and as for the two generals who were the best they\r\nhad, we come here having slain the one, Sittas, and Belisarius will\r\nnever again be seen by Justinian. For disregarding his master, he has\r\nremained in the West, holding the power of Italy himself. So that when\r\nthou goest against the enemy, no one at all will confront thee, and thou\r\nwilt have us leading the army with good will, as is natural, and with a\r\nthorough knowledge of the country.\" When Chosroes heard this he was\r\npleased, and calling together all who were of noble blood among the\r\nPersians, he disclosed to all of them what Vittigis had written and what\r\nthe Armenians had said, and laid before them the question as to what\r\nshould be done. Then many opinions were expressed inclining to either\r\nside, but finally it was decided that they must open hostilities against\r\nthe Romans at the beginning of spring. [539 A.D.] For it was the late\r\nautumn season, in the thirteenth year of the reign of the Emperor\r\nJustinian. The Romans, however, did not suspect this, nor did they think\r\nthat the Persians would ever break the so-called endless peace, although\r\nthey heard that Chosroes blamed their emperor for his successes in the\r\nWest, and that he preferred against him the charges which I have lately\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n[539 A.D.] At that time also the comet appeared, at first about as long\r\nas a tall man, but later much larger. And the end of it was toward the\r\nwest and its beginning toward the east, and it followed behind the sun\r\nitself. For the sun was in Capricorn and it was in Sagittarius. And some\r\ncalled it \"the swordfish\" because it was of goodly length and very sharp\r\nat the point, and others called it \"the bearded star\"; it was seen for\r\nmore than forty days. Now those who were wise in these matters disagreed\r\nutterly with each other, and one announced that one thing, another that\r\nanother thing was indicated by this star; but I only write what took\r\nplace and I leave to each one to judge by the outcome as he wishes.\r\nStraightway a mighty Hunnic army crossing the Danube River fell as a\r\nscourge upon all Europe, a thing which had happened many times before,\r\nbut which had never brought such a multitude of woes nor such dreadful\r\nones to the people of that land. For from the Ionian Gulf these\r\nbarbarians plundered everything in order as far as the suburbs of\r\nByzantium. And they captured thirty-two fortresses in Illyricum, and\r\nthey carried by storm the city of Cassandria (which the ancients called\r\nPotidaea, as far as we know), never having fought against walls before.\r\nAnd taking with them the money and leading away one hundred and twenty\r\nthousand captives, they all retired homeward without encountering any\r\nopposition. In later times too they often came there and brought upon\r\nthe Romans irreparable calamity. This same people also assailed the wall\r\nof the Chersonesus, where they overpowered those who were defending\r\nthemselves from the wall, and approaching through the surf of the sea,\r\nscaled the fortifications on the so-called Black Gulf; thus they got\r\nwithin the long wall, and falling unexpectedly upon the Romans in the\r\nChersonesus they slew many of them and made prisoners of almost all the\r\nsurvivors. Some few of them also crossed the strait between Sestus and\r\nAbydus, and after plundering the Asiatic country, they returned again to\r\nthe Chersonesus, and with the rest of the army and all the booty betook\r\nthemselves to their homes. In another invasion they plundered Illyricum\r\nand Thessaly and attempted to storm the wall at Thermopylae; and since\r\nthe guards on the walls defended them most valiantly, they sought out\r\nthe ways around and unexpectedly found the path which leads up the\r\nmountain which rises there[3]. In this way they destroyed almost all the\r\nGreeks except the Peloponnesians, and then withdrew. And the Persians\r\nnot long afterwards broke off the treaty and wrought such harm to the\r\nRomans of the East as I shall set forth immediately.\r\n\r\nBelisarius, after humbling Vittigis, the king of the Goths and Italians,\r\nbrought him alive to Byzantium. And I shall now proceed to tell how the\r\narmy of the Persians invaded the land of the Romans. When the Emperor\r\nJustinian perceived that Chosroes was eager for war, he wished to offer\r\nhim some counsel and to dissuade him from the undertaking. Now it\r\nhappened that a certain man had come to Byzantium from the city of\r\nDaras, Anastasius by name, well known for his sagacity; he it was who\r\nhad broken the tyranny which had been established recently in Daras.\r\nJustinian therefore wrote a letter and sent it by this Anastasius to\r\nChosroes; and the message of the letter was as follows: \"It is the part\r\nof men of discretion and those by whom divine things are treated with\r\ndue respect, when causes of war arise, and in particular against men who\r\nare in the truest sense friends, to exert all their power to put an end\r\nto them; but it belongs to foolish men and those who most lightly bring\r\non themselves the enmity of Heaven to devise occasions for war and\r\ninsurrection which have no real existence. Now to destroy peace and\r\nenter upon war is not a difficult matter, since the nature of things is\r\nsuch as to make the basest activities easy for the most dishonourable\r\nmen. But when they have brought about war according to their intention,\r\nto return again to peace is for men, I think, not easy. And yet thou\r\nchargest me with writing letters which were not written with any dark\r\npurpose, and thou hast now made haste to interpret these with arbitrary\r\njudgment, not in the sense in which we conceived them when we wrote\r\nthem, but in a way which will be of advantage to thee in thy eagerness\r\nto carry out thy plans not without some pretext. But for us it is\r\npossible to point out that thy Alamoundaras recently overran our land\r\nand performed outrageous deeds in time of peace, to wit, the capture of\r\ntowns, the seizure of property, the massacre and enslavement of such a\r\nmultitude of men, concerning which it will be thy duty not to blame us,\r\nbut to defend thyself. For the crimes of those who have done wrong are\r\nmade manifest to their neighbours by their acts, not by their thoughts.\r\nBut even with these things as they are, we have still decided to hold to\r\npeace, but we hear that thou in thy eagerness to make war upon the\r\nRomans art fabricating accusations which do not belong to us at all.\r\nNatural enough, this; for while those who are eager to preserve the\r\npresent order of things repel even those charges against their friends\r\nwhich are most pressing, those who are not satisfied with established\r\nfriendships exert themselves to provide even pretexts which do not\r\nexist. But this would not seem to be becoming even to ordinary men, much\r\nless to kings. But leaving aside these things do thou consider the\r\nnumber of those who will be destroyed on both sides in the course of the\r\nwar, and consider well who will justly bear the blame for those things\r\nwhich will come to pass, and ponder upon the oaths which thou didst take\r\nwhen thou didst carry away the money, and consider that if, after that,\r\nthou wrongly dishonour them by some tricks or sophistries, thou wouldst\r\nnot be able to pervert them; for Heaven is too mighty to be deceived by\r\nany man.\" When Chosroes saw this message, he neither made any immediate\r\nanswer nor did he dismiss Anastasius, but he compelled him to remain\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n[540 A.D.] When the winter was already reaching its close, and the\r\nthirteenth year of the reign of the Emperor Justinian was ending,\r\nChosroes, son of Cabades, invaded the land of the Romans at the opening\r\nof spring with a mighty army, and openly broke the so-called endless\r\npeace. But he did not enter by the country between the rivers, but\r\nadvanced with the Euphrates on his right. On the other side of the river\r\nstands the last Roman stronghold which is called Circesium, an\r\nexceedingly strong place, since the River Aborras, a large stream, has\r\nits mouth at this point and mingles with the Euphrates, and this\r\nfortress lies exactly in the angle which is made by the junction of the\r\ntwo rivers. And a long second wall outside the fortress cuts off the\r\nland between the two rivers, and completes the form of a triangle around\r\nCircesium. Chosroes, therefore, not wishing to make trial of so strong a\r\nfortress and not having in mind to cross the River Euphrates, but rather\r\nto go against the Syrians and Cilicians, without any hesitation led his\r\narmy forward, and after advancing for what, to an unencumbered\r\ntraveller, is about a three-days' journey along the bank of the\r\nEuphrates, he came upon the city of Zenobia; this place Zenobia had\r\nbuilt in former times, and, as was natural, she gave her name to the\r\ncity. Now Zenobia was the wife of Odonathus, the ruler of the Saracens\r\nof that region, who had been on terms of peace with the Romans from of\r\nold. This Odonathus rescued for the Romans the Eastern Empire when it\r\nhad come under the power of the Medes; but this took place in former\r\ntimes. Chosroes then came near to Zenobia, but upon learning that the\r\nplace was not important and observing that the land was untenanted and\r\ndestitute of all good things, he feared lest any time spent by him there\r\nwould be wasted on an affair of no consequence and would be a hindrance\r\nto great undertakings, and he attempted to force the place to surrender.\r\nBut meeting with no success, he hastened his march forward.\r\n\r\nAfter again accomplishing a journey of equal extent, he reached the city\r\nof Sura, which is on the River Euphrates, and stopped very close to it.\r\nThere it happened that the horse on which Chosroes was riding neighed\r\nand stamped the ground with his foot. And the Magi considered the\r\nmeaning of this incident and announced that the place would be captured.\r\nChosroes then made camp and led his army against the fortifications to\r\nassail the wall. Now it happened that a certain Arsaces, an Armenian by\r\nbirth, was commander of the soldiers in the town; and he made the\r\nsoldiers mount the parapets, and fighting from there most valiantly slew\r\nmany of the enemy, but was himself struck by an arrow and died. And\r\nthen, since it was late in the day, the Persians retired to their camp\r\nin order to assail the wall again on the following day; but the Romans\r\nwere in despair since their leader was dead, and were purposing to make\r\nthemselves suppliants of Chosroes. On the following day, therefore, they\r\nsent the bishop of the city to plead for them and to beg that the town\r\nbe spared; so he took with him some of his attendants, who carried fowls\r\nand wine and clean loaves, and came before Chosroes; there he threw\r\nhimself on the ground, and with tears supplicated him to spare a\r\npitiable population and a city altogether without honour in the eyes of\r\nthe Romans, and one which in past times had never been of any account to\r\nthe Persians, and which never would be such thereafter; and he promised\r\nthat the men of Sura would give him ransom worthy of themselves and the\r\ncity which they inhabited. But Chosroes was angry with the townsmen\r\nbecause, being the first he had met of all the Romans, they had not\r\nwillingly received him into their city, but even daring to raise their\r\narms against him had slain a large number of Persian notables. However\r\nhe did not disclose his anger, but carefully concealed it behind a\r\nsmooth countenance, in order that by carrying out the punishment of the\r\ninhabitants of Sura he might make himself in the eyes of the Romans a\r\nfearful person and one not to be resisted. For by acting in this way he\r\ncalculated that those who would from time to time come in his way would\r\nyield to him without trouble. Accordingly with great friendliness he\r\ncaused the bishop to rise, and receiving the gifts, gave the impression,\r\nin a way, that he would immediately confer with the notables of the\r\nPersians concerning the ransom of the townsmen, and would settle their\r\nrequest favourably. Thus he dismissed the bishop and his following\r\nwithout any suspicion of the plot, and he sent with him certain of the\r\nmen of note among the Persians, who were to be ostensibly an escort.\r\nThese men he secretly commanded to go with him as far as the wall,\r\nencouraging him and cheering him with fair hopes, so that he and all\r\nthose with him should be seen by those inside rejoicing and fearing\r\nnothing. But when the guards had set the gate open and were about to\r\nreceive them into the city, they were to throw a stone or block of wood\r\nbetween the threshold and the gate and not allow them to shut it, but\r\nshould themselves for a time stand in the way of those who wished to\r\nclose it; for not long afterwards the army would follow them.\r\n\r\nAfter giving these directions to the men Chosroes made ready the army,\r\nand commanded them to advance upon the city on the run whenever he\r\nshould give the signal. So when they came close to the fortifications,\r\nthe Persians bade farewell to the bishop and remained outside, and the\r\ntownsmen, seeing that the man was exceedingly happy and that he was\r\nbeing escorted in great honour by the enemy, forgetting all their\r\ndifficulties opened the gate wide, and received the priest and his\r\nfollowing with clapping of hands and much shouting. And when all got\r\ninside, the guards began to push the gate in order to close it, but the\r\nPersians flung down a stone, which they had provided, between it and the\r\nthreshold. And the guards pushed and struggled still more, but were\r\nquite unable to get the gate back to the threshold. On the other hand\r\nthey dared not open it again, since they perceived that it was held by\r\nthe enemy. But some say that it was not a stone but a block of wood\r\nwhich the Persians threw into the gateway. When the townsmen had as yet\r\nscarcely realized the plot, Chosroes was at hand with his whole army,\r\nand the barbarians forced back and flung open the gate, which was soon\r\ncarried by storm. Straightway, then, Chosroes, filled with wrath,\r\nplundered the houses and put to death great numbers of the population;\r\nall the remainder he reduced to slavery, and setting fire to the whole\r\ncity razed it to the ground. Then he dismissed Anastasius, bidding him\r\nannounce to the Emperor Justinian where in the world he had left\r\nChosroes, son of Cabades.\r\n\r\nAfterwards either through motives of humanity or of avarice, or as\r\ngranting a favour to a woman whom he had taken as a captive from the\r\ncity, Euphemia by name, Chosroes decided to shew some kindness to the\r\ninhabitants of Sura; for he had conceived for this woman an\r\nextraordinary love (for she was exceedingly beautiful to look upon), and\r\nhad made her his wedded wife. He sent, accordingly, to Sergiopolis, a\r\ncity subject to the Romans, named from Sergius, a famous saint, distant\r\nfrom the captured city one hundred and twenty-six stades and lying to\r\nthe south of it in the so-called Barbarian Plain, and bade Candidus, the\r\nbishop of the city, purchase the captives, twelve thousand in number,\r\nfor two centenaria. But the bishop, alleging that he had no money,\r\nrefused absolutely to undertake the matter. Chosroes therefore requested\r\nhim to set down in a document the agreement that he would give the money\r\nat a later time, and thus to purchase for a small sum such a multitude\r\nof slaves. Candidus did as directed, promising to give the money within\r\na year, and swore the most dire oaths, specifying that he should receive\r\nthe following punishment if he should not give the money at the time\r\nagreed upon, that he should pay double the amount and should himself be\r\nno longer a priest, as one who had neglected his sworn promise. And\r\nafter setting down these things in writing, Candidus received all the\r\ninhabitants of Sura. And some few among them survived, but the majority,\r\nunable to support the misery which had fallen to their lot, succumbed\r\nsoon afterwards. After the settlement of this affair Chosroes led his\r\narmy forward.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nIt had happened a little before this that the emperor had divided into\r\ntwo parts the military command of the East, leaving the portion as far\r\nas the River Euphrates under the control of Belisarius who formerly held\r\nthe command of the whole, while the portion from there as far as the\r\nPersian boundary he entrusted to Bouzes, commanding him to take charge\r\nof the whole territory of the East until Belisarius should return from\r\nItaly. Bouzes therefore at first remained at Hierapolis, keeping his\r\nwhole army with him; but when he learned what had befallen Sura, he\r\ncalled together the first men of the Hierapolitans and spoke as follows:\r\n\"Whenever men are confronted with a struggle against an assailant with\r\nwhom they are evenly matched in strength, it is not at all unreasonable\r\nthat they should engage in open conflict with the enemy; but for those\r\nwho are by comparison much inferior to their opponents it will be more\r\nadvantageous to circumvent their enemy by some kind of tricks than to\r\narray themselves openly against them and thus enter into foreseen\r\ndanger. How great, now, the army of Chosroes is you are assuredly\r\ninformed. And if, with this army, he wishes to capture us by siege, and\r\nif we carry on the fight from the wall, it is probable that, while our\r\nsupplies will fail us, the Persians will secure all they need from our\r\nland, where there will be no one to oppose them. And if the siege is\r\nprolonged in this way, I believe too that the fortification wall will\r\nnot withstand the assaults of the enemy, for in many places it is most\r\nsusceptible to attack, and thus irreparable harm will come to the\r\nRomans. But if with a portion of the army we guard the wall of the city,\r\nwhile the rest of us occupy the heights about the city, we shall make\r\nattacks from there at times upon the camp of our antagonists, and at\r\ntimes upon those who are sent out for the sake of provisions, and thus\r\ncompel Chosroes to abandon the siege immediately and to make his retreat\r\nwithin a short time; for he will not be at all able to direct his attack\r\nwithout fear against the fortifications, nor to provide any of the\r\nnecessities for so great an army.\" So spoke Bouzes; and in his words he\r\nseemed to set forth the advantageous course of action, but of what was\r\nnecessary he did nothing. For he chose out all that portion of the Roman\r\narmy which was of marked excellence and was off. And where in the world\r\nhe was neither any of the Romans in Hierapolis, nor the hostile army was\r\nable to learn. Such, then, was the course of these events.\r\n\r\nBut the Emperor Justinian, upon learning of the inroad of the Persians,\r\nimmediately sent his nephew Germanus with three hundred followers in\r\ngreat disorder, promising that after no great time a numerous army would\r\nfollow. And Germanus, upon reaching Antioch, went around the whole\r\ncircuit of the wall; and the greater part of it he found secure, for\r\nalong that portion of it which lies on the level ground the River\r\nOrontes flows, making it everywhere difficult of access, and the portion\r\nwhich is on higher ground rises upon steep hills and is quite\r\ninaccessible to the enemy; but when he attained the highest point, which\r\nthe men of that place are accustomed to call Orocasias, he noticed that\r\nthe wall at that point was very easy to assail. For there happens to be\r\nin that place a rock, which spreads out to a very considerable width,\r\nand rises to a height only a little less than the fortifications. He\r\ntherefore commanded that they should either cut off the rock by making a\r\ndeep ditch along the wall, lest anyone should essay to mount from there\r\nupon the fortifications, or that they should build upon it a great tower\r\nand connect its structure with the wall of the city. But to the\r\narchitects of public buildings it seemed that neither one of these\r\nthings should be done. For, as they said, the work would not be\r\ncompleted in a short time with the attack of the enemy so imminent,\r\nwhile if they began this work and did not carry it to completion, they\r\nwould do nothing else than shew to the enemy at what point in the wall\r\nthey should make their attack. Germanus, though disappointed in this\r\nplan, had some hope at first because he expected an army from Byzantium.\r\nBut when, after considerable time had passed, no army arrived from the\r\nemperor nor was expected to arrive, he began to fear lest Chosroes,\r\nlearning that the emperor's nephew was there, would consider it more\r\nimportant than any other thing to capture Antioch and himself, and for\r\nthis reason would neglect everything else and come against the city with\r\nhis whole army. The natives of Antioch also had these things in mind,\r\nand they held a council concerning them, at which it seemed most\r\nadvisable to offer money to Chosroes and thus escape the present danger.\r\n\r\nAccordingly they sent Megas, the bishop of Beroea, a man of discretion\r\nwho at that time happened to be tarrying among them, to beg for mercy\r\nfrom Chosroes; and departing from there he came upon the Median army not\r\nfar from Hierapolis. And coming into the presence of Chosroes, he\r\nentreated him earnestly to have pity upon men who had committed no\r\noffence against him and who were not able to hold out against the\r\nPersian army. For it was becoming to a king least of all men to trample\r\nupon and do violence to those who retreated before him and were quite\r\nunwilling to array themselves against him; for not one of the things\r\nwhich he was then doing was a kingly or honourable act, because, without\r\naffording any time for consideration to the Roman emperor, so that he\r\nmight either make the peace secure as might seem well to both\r\nsovereigns, or make his preparations for war in accordance with a mutual\r\nagreement, as was to be expected, he had thus recklessly advanced in\r\narms against the Romans, while their emperor did not as yet know what\r\nhad come upon them. When Chosroes heard this, he was utterly unable by\r\nreason of his stupidity to order his mind with reason and discretion,\r\nbut still more than before he was lifted up in spirit. He therefore\r\nthreatened to destroy all the Syrians and Cilicians, and bidding Megas\r\nfollow him, he led his army to Hierapolis. When he had come there and\r\nestablished his camp, since he saw that the fortifications were strong\r\nand learned that the city was well garrisoned with soldiers, he demanded\r\nmoney from the Hierapolitans, sending to them Paulus as interpreter.\r\nThis Paulus had been reared in Roman territory and had gone to an\r\nelementary school in Antioch, and besides he was said to be by birth of\r\nRoman extraction. But in spite of everything the inhabitants were\r\nexceedingly fearful for the fortifications, which embraced a large tract\r\nof land as far as the hill which rises there, and besides they wished to\r\npreserve their land unplundered; accordingly they agreed to give two\r\nthousand pounds of silver. Then indeed Megas entreated Chosroes in\r\nbehalf of all the inhabitants of the East, and would not cease his\r\nentreaty, until Chosroes promised him that he would accept ten\r\ncentenaria of gold and depart from the whole Roman empire.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nThus, then, on that day Megas departed thence and went on the way to\r\nAntioch, while Chosroes after receiving the ransom was moving toward\r\nBeroea. This city lies between Antioch and Hierapolis, at a distance\r\nfrom both of two-days' journey for an unencumbered traveller. Now while\r\nMegas, who travelled with a small company, advanced very quickly, the\r\nPersian army was accomplishing only one half of the distance which he\r\ntravelled each day. And so on the fourth day he reached Antioch, while\r\nthe Persians came to the suburb of Beroea. And Chosroes immediately sent\r\nPaulus and demanded money of the Beroeans, not only as much as he had\r\nreceived from the Hierapolitans, but double the amount, since he saw\r\nthat their wall in many places was very vulnerable. As for the Beroeans,\r\nsince they could by no means place confidence in their fortifications,\r\nthey gladly agreed to give all, but after giving two thousand pounds of\r\nsilver, they said that they were not able to give the remainder. And\r\nsince Chosroes pressed them on this account, on the following night all\r\nof them fled for refuge into the fortress which is on the acropolis\r\ntogether with the soldiers who had been stationed there to guard the\r\nplace. And on the following day men were sent to the city by Chosroes in\r\norder to receive the money; but on coming near the fortifications they\r\nfound all the gates closed, and being unable to discover any man, they\r\nreported the situation to the king. And he commanded them to set ladders\r\nagainst the wall and to make trial of mounting it, and they did as\r\ndirected. Then since no one opposed them, they got inside the\r\nfortifications and opened the gates at their leisure, and received into\r\nthe city the whole army and Chosroes himself. By this time the king was\r\nfurious with anger and he fired nearly the whole city. He then mounted\r\nthe acropolis and decided to storm the fortress. There indeed the Roman\r\nsoldiers while valiantly defending themselves slew some of the enemy;\r\nbut Chosroes was greatly favoured by fortune by reason of the folly of\r\nthe besieged, who had not sought refuge in this fortress by themselves,\r\nbut along with all their horses and other animals, and by this\r\ninconsiderate act they were placed at a great disadvantage and began to\r\nbe in danger. For since there was only one spring there and the horses\r\nand mules and other animals drank from it when they should not have done\r\nso, it came about that the water was exhausted. Such, then, was the\r\nsituation of the Beroeans.\r\n\r\nMegas, upon reaching Antioch and announcing the terms arranged by him\r\nwith Chosroes, failed utterly to persuade them to carry out this\r\nagreement. For it happened that the Emperor Justinian had sent John, the\r\nson of Rufinus, and Julian, his private[4] secretary, as ambassadors to\r\nChosroes. The person holding this office is styled \"a secretis\" by the\r\nRomans; for secrets they are accustomed to call \"secreta.\" These men had\r\nreached Antioch and were remaining there. Now Julian, one of the\r\nambassadors, explicitly forbade everybody to give money to the enemy, or\r\nto purchase the cities of the emperor, and besides he denounced to\r\nGermanus the chief priest Ephraemius, as being eager to deliver over the\r\ncity to Chosroes. For this reason Megas returned unsuccessful. But\r\nEphraemius, the bishop of Antioch, fearing the attack of the Persians,\r\nwent into Cilicia. There too came Germanus not long afterwards, taking\r\nwith him some few men but leaving the most of them in Antioch.\r\n\r\nMegas then came in haste to Beroea, and in vexation at what had taken\r\nplace, he charged Chosroes with having treated the Beroeans\r\noutrageously; for while, as it seemed, he had sent him to Antioch to\r\narrange the treaty, he had both plundered the property of the citizens,\r\nthough they had committed no wrong at all, and had compelled them to\r\nshut themselves up in that fortress, and had then set fire to the city\r\nand razed it to the ground in defiance of right. To this Chosroes\r\nreplied as follows: \"Verily, my friend, you yourself are responsible for\r\nthese things, in having compelled us to delay here; for as it is, you\r\nhave arrived, not at the appointed time, but far behind it. And as for\r\nthe strange conduct of your fellow-citizens, my most excellent sir, why\r\nshould one make speeches of great length? For after agreeing to give us\r\na fixed amount of silver for their own safety, they even now do not\r\nthink it necessary to fulfil the agreement, but placing such complete\r\nconfidence in the strength of their position, they are disregarding us\r\nabsolutely, while we are compelled to undertake the siege of a fortress,\r\nas you surely see. But for my part, I have hope that with the help of\r\nthe gods I shall have vengeance upon them shortly, and execute upon the\r\nguilty the punishment for the Persians whom I have lost wrongfully\r\nbefore this wall.\" So spoke Chosroes, and Megas replied as follows: \"If\r\none should consider that as king thou art making these charges against\r\nmen who are in pitiable and most dishonoured plight, he would be\r\ncompelled without a word of protest to agree with what thou hast said;\r\nfor authority which is unlimited is bound by its very nature to carry\r\nwith it also supremacy in argument; but if one be permitted to shake off\r\nall else and to espouse the truth of the matter, thou wouldst have, O\r\nKing, nothing with which justly to reproach us; but mayst thou hear all\r\nmildly. First, as for me, since the time when I was sent to declare to\r\nthe men of Antioch the message which thou didst send them, seven days\r\nhave passed (and what could be done more quickly than this?) and now\r\ncoming into thy presence I find these things accomplished by thee\r\nagainst my fatherland; but these men, having already lost all that is\r\nmost valuable, thereafter have only one struggle to engage in--that for\r\nlife--and have come, I think, so to be masters of the situation that\r\nthey can no longer be compelled to pay thee any of the money. For to pay\r\na thing which one does not possess could not be made possible for a man\r\nby any device. From of old indeed have the names of things been well and\r\nsuitably distinguished by men; and among these distinctions is this,\r\nthat want of power is separated from want of consideration. For when the\r\nlatter by reason of intemperance of mind proceeds to resistance, it is\r\naccustomed to be detested, as is natural, but when the former, because\r\nof the impossibility of performing a service, is driven to the same\r\npoint, it deserves to be pitied. Permit, therefore, O King, that, while\r\nwe receive as our portion all the direst misfortunes, we may take with\r\nus this consolation at least, that we should not seem to have been\r\nourselves responsible for the things which have befallen us. And as for\r\nmoney, consider that what thou hast taken into thy possession is\r\nsufficient for thee, not weighing this by thy position, but with regard\r\nto the power of the Beroeans. But beyond this do not force us in any\r\nway, lest perchance thou shouldst seem unable to accomplish the thing to\r\nwhich thou hast set thy hand; for excess is always punished by meeting\r\nobstacles that cannot be overcome, and the best course is not to essay\r\nthe impossible. Let this, then, be my defence for the moment in behalf\r\nof these men. But if I should be able to have converse with the\r\nsufferers, I should have something else also to say which has now\r\nescaped me.\" So spoke Megas, and Chosroes permitted him to go into the\r\nacropolis. And when he had gone there and learned all that had happened\r\nconcerning the spring, weeping he came again before Chosroes, and lying\r\nprone on the ground insisted that no money at all was left to the\r\nBeroeans, and entreated him to grant him only the lives of the men.\r\nMoved by the tearful entreaties of the man Chosroes fulfilled his\r\nrequest, and binding himself by an oath, gave pledges to all on the\r\nacropolis. Then the Beroeans, after coming into such great danger, left\r\nthe acropolis free from harm, and departing went each his own way. Among\r\nthe soldiers some few followed them, but the majority came as willing\r\ndeserters to Chosroes, putting forth as their grievance that the\r\ngovernment owed them their pay for a long time; and with him they later\r\nwent into the land of Persia.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n[June 540 A.D.] Then Chosroes (since Megas said that he had by no means\r\npersuaded the inhabitants of Antioch to bring him the money) went with\r\nhis whole army against them. Some of the population of Antioch thereupon\r\ndeparted from there with their money and fled as each one could. And all\r\nthe rest likewise were purposing to do the same thing, and would have\r\ndone so had not the commanders of the troops in Lebanon, Theoctistus and\r\nMolatzes, who arrived in the meantime with six thousand men, fortified\r\nthem with hope and thus prevented their departure. Not long after this\r\nthe Persian army also came. There they all pitched their tents and made\r\ncamp fronting on the River Orontes and not very far from the stream.\r\nChosroes then sent Paulus up beside the fortifications and demanded\r\nmoney from the men of Antioch, saying that for ten centenaria[5] of gold\r\nhe would depart from there, and it was obvious that he would accept even\r\nless than this for his withdrawal. And on that day their ambassadors\r\nwent before Chosroes, and after speaking at length concerning the\r\nbreaking of the peace and hearing much from him, they retired. But on\r\nthe morrow the populace of Antioch (for they are not seriously disposed,\r\nbut are always engaged in jesting and disorderly performance) heaped\r\ninsults upon Chosroes from the battlements and taunted him with unseemly\r\nlaughter; and when Paulus came near the fortifications and exhorted them\r\nto purchase freedom for themselves and the city for a small sum of\r\nmoney, they very nearly killed him with shots from their bows, and would\r\nhave done so if he had not seen their purpose in time and guarded\r\nagainst it. On account of this Chosroes, boiling with anger, decided to\r\nstorm the wall.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, accordingly, he led up all the Persians against\r\nthe wall and commanded a portion of the army to make assaults at\r\ndifferent points along the river, and he himself with the most of the\r\nmen and best troops directed an attack against the height. For at this\r\nplace, as has been stated by me above, the wall of fortification was\r\nmost vulnerable. Thereupon the Romans, since the structure on which they\r\nwere to stand when fighting was very narrow, devised the following\r\nremedy. Binding together long timbers they suspended them between the\r\ntowers, and in this way they made these spaces much broader, in order\r\nthat still more men might be able to ward off the assailants from there.\r\nSo the Persians, pressing on most vigorously from all sides, were\r\nsending their arrows thickly everywhere, and especially along the crest\r\nof the hill. Meanwhile the Romans were fighting them back with all their\r\nstrength, not soldiers alone, but also many of the most courageous\r\nyouths of the populace. But it appeared that those who were attacking\r\nthe wall there were engaged in a battle on even terms with their enemy.\r\nFor the rock which was broad and high and, as it were, drawn up against\r\nthe fortifications caused the conflict to be just as if on level ground.\r\nAnd if anyone of the Roman army had had the courage to get outside the\r\nfortifications with three hundred men and to anticipate the enemy in\r\nseizing this rock and to ward off the assailants from there, never, I\r\nbelieve, would the city have come into any danger from the enemy. For\r\nthe barbarians had no point from which they could have conducted their\r\nassault, for they would be exposed to missiles from above both from the\r\nrock and from the wall; but as it was (for it was fated that Antioch be\r\ndestroyed by this army of the Medes), this idea occurred to no one. So\r\nthen while the Persians were fighting beyond their power, since Chosroes\r\nwas present with them and urging them on with a mighty cry, giving their\r\nopponents not a moment in which to look about or guard against the\r\nmissiles discharged from their bows, and while the Romans, in great\r\nnumbers and with much shouting, were defending themselves still more\r\nvigorously, the ropes with which the beams had been bound together,\r\nfailing to support the weight, suddenly broke asunder and the timbers\r\ntogether with all those who had taken their stand on them fell to the\r\nground with a mighty crash. When this was heard by other Romans also,\r\nwho were fighting from the adjoining towers, being utterly unable to\r\ncomprehend what had happened, but supposing that the wall at this point\r\nhad been destroyed, they beat a hasty retreat. Now many young men of the\r\npopulace who in former times had been accustomed to engage in factional\r\nstrife with each other in the hippodromes descended into the city from\r\nthe fortification wall, but they refused to flee and remained where they\r\nwere, while the soldiers with Theoctistus and Molatzes straightway\r\nleaped upon the horses which happened to be ready there and rode away to\r\nthe gates, telling the others a tale to the effect that Bouzes had come\r\nwith an army and they wished to receive them quickly into the city, and\r\nwith them to ward off the enemy. Thereupon many of the men of Antioch\r\nand all the women with their children made a great rush toward the\r\ngates; but since they were crowded by the horses, being in very narrow\r\nquarters, they began to fall down. The soldiers, however, sparing\r\nabsolutely no one of those before them, all kept riding over the fallen\r\nstill more fiercely than before, and a great many were killed there,\r\nespecially about the gates themselves.\r\n\r\nBut the Persians, with no one opposing them, set ladders against the\r\nwall and mounted with no difficulty. And quickly reaching the\r\nbattlements, for a time they were by no means willing to descend, but\r\nthey seemed like men looking about them and at a loss what to do,\r\nbecause, as it seems to me, they supposed that the rough ground was\r\nbeset with some ambuscades of the enemy. For the land inside the\r\nfortifications which one traverses immediately upon descending from the\r\nheight is an uninhabited tract extending for a great distance and there\r\nare found there rocks which rise to a very great height, and steep\r\nplaces. But some say that it was by the will of Chosroes that the\r\nPersians hesitated. For when he observed the difficulty of the ground\r\nand saw the soldiers fleeing, he feared lest by reason of some necessity\r\nthey should turn back from their retreat and make trouble for the\r\nPersians, and thus become an obstacle, as might well happen, in the way\r\nof his capturing a city which was both ancient and of great importance\r\nand the first of all the cities which the Romans had throughout the East\r\nboth in wealth and in size and in population and in beauty and in\r\nprosperity of every kind. Hence it was that, considering everything else\r\nof less account, he wished to allow the Roman soldiers freely to avail\r\nthemselves of the chance for flight. For this reason too the Persians\r\nalso made signs to the fugitives with their hands, urging them to flee\r\nas quickly as possible. So the soldiers of the Romans together with\r\ntheir commanders took a hasty departure, all of them, through the gate\r\nwhich leads to Daphne, the suburb of Antioch; for from this gate alone\r\nthe Persians kept away while the others were seized; and of the populace\r\nsome few escaped with the soldiers. Then when the Persians saw that all\r\nthe Roman soldiers had gone on, they descended from the height and got\r\ninto the middle of the city. There, however, many of the young men of\r\nAntioch engaged in battle with them, and at first they seemed to have\r\nthe upper hand in the conflict. Some of them were in heavy armour, but\r\nthe majority were unarmed and using only stones as missiles. And pushing\r\nback the enemy they raised the paean, and with shouts proclaimed the\r\nEmperor Justinian triumphant, as if they had won the victory.\r\n\r\nAt this point Chosroes, seated on the tower which is on the height,\r\nsummoned the ambassadors, wishing to say something. And one of his\r\nofficers, Zaberganes, thinking that he wished to have words with the\r\nambassadors concerning a settlement, came quickly before the king and\r\nspoke as follows: \"Thou dost not seem to me, O Master, to think in the\r\nsame way as do the Romans concerning the safety of these men. For they\r\nboth before fighting offer insults to thy kingdom, and when they are\r\ndefeated dare the impossible and do the Persians irreparable harm, as if\r\nfearing lest some reason for shewing them humanity should be left in\r\nthee; but thou art wishing to pity those who do not ask to be saved, and\r\nhast shewn zeal to spare those who by no means wish it. Meanwhile these\r\nmen have set an ambush in a captured city and are destroying the victors\r\nby means of snares, although all the soldiers have long since fled from\r\nthem.\" When Chosroes heard this, he sent a large number of the best\r\ntroops against them, and these not long afterwards returned and\r\nannounced that nothing untoward had come to pass. For already the\r\nPersians had forced back the citizens by their numbers and turned them\r\nto flight, and a great slaughter took place there. For the Persians did\r\nnot spare persons of any age and were slaying all whom they met, old and\r\nyoung alike. At that time they say that two women of those who were\r\nillustrious in Antioch got outside the fortifications, but perceiving\r\nthat they would fall into the hands of the enemy (for they were already\r\nplainly seen going about everywhere), went running to the River Orontes,\r\nand, fearing lest the Persians should do them some insult, they covered\r\ntheir faces with their veils and threw themselves into the river's\r\ncurrent and were carried out of sight. Thus the inhabitants of Antioch\r\nwere visited with every form of misfortune.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nThen Chosroes spoke to the ambassadors as follows: \"Not far from the\r\ntruth, I think, is the ancient saying that God does not give blessings\r\nunmixed, but He mingles them with troubles and then bestows them upon\r\nmen. And for this reason we do not even have laughter without tears, but\r\nthere is always attached to our successes some misfortune, and to our\r\npleasures pain, not permitting anyone to enjoy in its purity such good\r\nfortune as is granted. For this city, which is of altogether preeminent\r\nimportance in fact as well as in name in the land of the Romans I have\r\nindeed succeeded in capturing with the least exertion, since God has\r\nprovided the victory all at once for us, as you doubtless see. But when\r\nI behold the massacre of such a multitude of men, and the victory thus\r\ndrenched with blood, there arises in me no sense of the delight that\r\nshould follow my achievement. And for this the wretched men of Antioch\r\nare to blame, for when the Persians were storming the wall they did not\r\nprove able to keep them back, and then when they had already triumphed\r\nand had captured the city at the first cry these men with unreasoned\r\ndaring sought to die fighting against them in close combat. So while all\r\nthe notables of the Persians were harassing me unceasingly with their\r\ndemand that I should drag the city as with a net and destroy all the\r\ncaptives, I was commanding the fugitives to press on still more in their\r\nflight, in order that they might save themselves as quickly as possible.\r\nFor to trample upon captives is not holy.\" Such high-sounding and airy\r\nwords did Chosroes speak to the ambassadors, but nevertheless it did not\r\nescape them why he gave time to the Romans in their flight.\r\n\r\nFor he was the cleverest of all men at saying that which was not, and in\r\nconcealing the truth, and in attributing the blame for the wrongs which\r\nhe committed to those who suffered the wrong; besides he was ready to\r\nagree to everything and to pledge the agreement with an oath, and much\r\nmore ready to forget completely the things lately agreed to and sworn to\r\nby him, and for the sake of money to debase his soul without reluctance\r\nto every act of pollution--a past master at feigning piety in his\r\ncountenance, and absolving himself in words from the responsibility of\r\nthe act. This man well displayed his own peculiar character on a certain\r\noccasion at Sura; for after he had hoodwinked the inhabitants of the\r\ncity by a trick and had destroyed them in the manner which I have\r\ndescribed, although they had previously done him no wrong at all, he\r\nsaw, while the city was being captured, a comely woman and one not of\r\nlowly station being dragged by her left hand with great violence by one\r\nof the barbarians; and the child, which she had only lately weaned, she\r\nwas unwilling to let go, but was dragging it with her other hand,\r\nfallen, as it was, to the ground since it was not able to keep pace with\r\nthat violent running. And they say that he uttered a pretended groan,\r\nand making it appear to all who were present at that time including\r\nAnastasius the ambassador that he was all in tears, he prayed God to\r\nexact vengeance from the man who was guilty of the troubles which had\r\ncome to pass. Now Justinian, the Emperor of the Romans, was the one whom\r\nhe wished to have understood, though he knew well that he himself was\r\nmost responsible for everything. Endowed with such a singular nature\r\nChosroes both became King of the Persians (for ill fortune had deprived\r\nZames of his eye, he who in point of years had first right to the\r\nkingdom, at any rate after Caoses, whom Cabades for no good reason\r\nhated), and with no difficulty he conquered those who revolted against\r\nhim, and all the harm which he purposed to do the Romans he accomplished\r\neasily. For every time when Fortune wishes to make a man great, she does\r\nat the fitting times those things which she has decided upon, with no\r\none standing against the force of her will; and she neither regards the\r\nman's station, nor purposes to prevent the occurrence of things which\r\nought not to be, nor does she give heed that many will blaspheme against\r\nher because of these things, mocking scornfully at that which has been\r\ndone by her contrary to the deserts of the man who receives her favour;\r\nnor does she take into consideration anything else at all, if only she\r\naccomplish the thing which has been decided upon by her. But as for\r\nthese matters, let them be as God wishes.\r\n\r\nChosroes commanded the army to capture and enslave the survivors of the\r\npopulation of Antioch, and to plunder all the property, while he himself\r\nwith the ambassadors descended from the height to the sanctuary which\r\nthey call a church. There Chosroes found stores of gold and silver so\r\ngreat in amount that, though he took no other part of the booty except\r\nthese stores, he departed possessed of enormous wealth. And he took down\r\nfrom there many wonderful marbles and ordered them to be deposited\r\noutside the fortifications, in order that they might convey these too to\r\nthe land of Persia. When he had finished these things, he gave orders to\r\nthe Persians to burn the whole city. And the ambassadors begged him to\r\nwithhold his hand only from the church, for which he had carried away\r\nransom in abundance. This he granted to the ambassadors, but gave orders\r\nto burn everything else; then, leaving there a few men who were to fire\r\nthe city, he himself with all the rest retired to the camp where they\r\nhad previously set up their tents.\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nA short time before this calamity God displayed a sign to the\r\ninhabitants of that city, by which He indicated the things which were to\r\nbe. For the standards of the soldiers who had been stationed there for a\r\nlong time had been standing previously toward the west, but of their own\r\naccord they turned and stood toward the east, and then returned again to\r\ntheir former position untouched by anyone. This the soldiers shewed to\r\nmany who were near at hand and among them the manager of finances in the\r\ncamp, while the standards were still trembling. This man, Tatianus by\r\nname, was an especially discreet person, a native of Mopsuestia. But\r\neven so those who saw this sign did not recognize that the mastery of\r\nthe place would pass from the western to the eastern king, in order,\r\nevidently, that escape might be utterly impossible for those who were\r\nbound to suffer those things which came to pass.\r\n\r\nBut I become dizzy as I write of such a great calamity and transmit it\r\nto future times, and I am unable to understand why indeed it should be\r\nthe will of God to exalt on high the fortunes of a man or of a place,\r\nand then to cast them down and destroy them for no cause which appears\r\nto us. For it is wrong to say that with Him all things are not always\r\ndone with reason, though he then endured to see Antioch brought down to\r\nthe ground at the hands of a most unholy man, a city whose beauty and\r\ngrandeur in every respect could not even so be utterly concealed.\r\n\r\nSo, then, after the city had been destroyed, the church was left\r\nsolitary, thanks to the activity and foresight of the Persians to whom\r\nthis work was assigned. And there were also left about the so-called\r\nCerataeum many houses, not because of the foresight of any man, but,\r\nsince they were situated at the extremity of the city, and not connected\r\nwith any other building, the fire failed entirely to reach them. The\r\nbarbarians burned also the parts outside the fortifications, except the\r\nsanctuary which is dedicated to St. Julianus and the houses which stand\r\nabout this sanctuary. For it happened that the ambassadors had taken up\r\ntheir lodgings there. As for the fortifications, the Persians left them\r\nwholly untouched.\r\n\r\nA little later the ambassadors again came to Chosroes and spoke as\r\nfollows: \"If our words were not addressed to thee in thy presence, O\r\nKing, we should never believe that Chosroes, the son of Cabades, had\r\ncome into the land of the Romans in arms, dishonouring the oaths which\r\nhave recently been sworn by thee--for such pledges are regarded as the\r\nlast and most firm security of all things among men to guarantee mutual\r\ntrust and truthfulness--and breaking the treaty, though hope in treaties\r\nis the only thing left to those who are living in insecurity because of\r\nthe evil deeds of war. For one might say of such a state of affairs that\r\nit is nothing else than the transformation of the habits of men into\r\nthose of beasts. For in a time when no treaties at all are made, there\r\nwill remain certainly war without end, and war which has no end is\r\nalways calculated to estrange from their proper nature those who engage\r\nin it. With what intent, moreover, didst thou write to thy brother not\r\nlong ago that he himself was responsible for the breaking of the treaty?\r\nWas it not obviously with the admission that the breaking of treaties is\r\nan exceedingly great evil? If therefore he has done no wrong, thou art\r\nnot acting justly now in coming against us; but if it happen that thy\r\nbrother has done any such thing, yet let thy complaint have its\r\nfulfilment thus far, and go no farther, that thou mayst shew thyself\r\nsuperior. For he who submits to be worsted in evil things would in\r\nbetter things justly be victorious. And yet we know well that the\r\nEmperor Justinian has never gone contrary to the treaty, and we entreat\r\nthee not to do the Romans such harm, from which there will be no\r\nadvantage to the Persians, and thou wilt gain only this, that thou wilt\r\nhave wrongfully wrought deeds of irreparable harm upon those who have\r\nrecently made peace with thee.\" So spoke the ambassadors.\r\n\r\nAnd Chosroes, upon hearing this, insisted that the treaty had been\r\nbroken by the Emperor Justinian; and he enumerated the causes of war\r\nwhich the Emperor afforded, some of them of real importance and others\r\nidle and fabricated without any reason; most of all he wished to shew\r\nthat the letters written by him to Alamoundaras and the Huns were the\r\nchief cause of the war, just as I have stated above[6]. But as for any\r\nRoman who had invaded the land of Persia, or who had made a display of\r\nwarlike deeds, he was unable either to mention or to point out such a\r\none. The ambassadors, however, referred the charges in part not to\r\nJustinian but to certain of those who had served him, while in the case\r\nof others they took exception to what he had said on the ground that the\r\nthings had not taken place as stated. Finally Chosroes made the demand\r\nthat the Romans give him a large sum of money, but he warned them not to\r\nhope to establish peace for all time by giving money at that moment\r\nonly. For friendship, he said, which is made by men on terms of money is\r\ngenerally spent as fast as the money is used up. It was necessary,\r\ntherefore, that the Romans should pay some definite annual sum to the\r\nPersians. \"For thus,\" he said, \"the Persians will keep the peace secure\r\nfor them, guarding the Caspian Gates themselves and no longer feeling\r\nresentment at them on account of the city of Daras, in return for which\r\nthe Persians themselves will be in their pay forever.\" \"So,\" said the\r\nambassadors, \"the Persians desire to have the Romans subject and\r\ntributary to themselves.\" \"No,\" said Chosroes, \"but the Romans will have\r\nthe Persians as their own soldiers for the future, dispensing to them a\r\nfixed payment for their service; for you give an annual payment of gold\r\nto some of the Huns and to the Saracens, not as tributary subjects to\r\nthem, but in order that they may guard your land unplundered for all\r\ntime.\" After Chosroes and the ambassadors had spoken thus at length with\r\neach other, they at last came to terms, agreeing that Chosroes should\r\nforthwith take from the Romans fifty centenaria[7], and that, receiving\r\na tribute of five more centenaria annually for all time, he should do\r\nthem no further harm, but taking with him hostages from the ambassadors\r\nto pledge the keeping of the agreement, should make his departure with\r\nthe whole army to his native land, and that there ambassadors sent from\r\nthe Emperor Justinian should arrange on a firm basis for the future the\r\ncompact regarding the peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nThen Chosroes went to Seleucia, a city on the sea, one hundred and\r\nthirty stades distant from Antioch; and there he neither met nor harmed\r\na single Roman, and he bathed himself alone in the sea-water, and after\r\nsacrificing to the sun and such other divinities as he wished, and\r\ncalling upon the gods many times, he went back. And when he came to the\r\ncamp, he said that he had a desire to see the city of Apamea which was\r\nin the vicinity for no other reason than that of his interest in the\r\nplace. And the ambassadors unwillingly granted this also, but only on\r\ncondition that after seeing the city and taking away with him from there\r\none thousand pounds of silver, he should, without inflicting any further\r\ninjury, march back. But it was evident to the ambassadors and to all the\r\nothers that Chosroes was setting out for Apamea with this sole purpose,\r\nthat he might lay hold upon some pretext of no importance and plunder\r\nboth the city and the land thereabout. Accordingly he first went up to\r\nDaphne, the suburb of Antioch, where he expressed great wonder at the\r\ngrove and at the fountains of water; for both of these are very well\r\nworth seeing. And after sacrificing to the nymphs he departed, doing no\r\nfurther damage than burning the sanctuary of the archangel Michael\r\ntogether with certain other buildings, for the following reason. A\r\nPersian gentleman of high repute in the army of the Persians and well\r\nknown to Chosroes, the king, while riding on horseback came in company\r\nwith some others to a precipitous place near the so-called Tretum, where\r\nis a temple of the archangel Michael, the work of Evaris. This man,\r\nseeing one of the young men of Antioch on foot and alone concealing\r\nhimself there, separated from the others and pursued him. Now the young\r\nman was a butcher, Aeimachus by name. When he was about to be overtaken,\r\nhe turned about unexpectedly and threw a stone at his pursuer which hit\r\nhim on the forehead and penetrated to the membrane by the ear. And the\r\nrider fell immediately to the ground, whereupon the youth drew out his\r\nsword and slew him. Then at his leisure he stripped him of his weapons\r\nand all his gold and whatever else he had on his person, and leaping\r\nupon his horse rode on. And whether by the favour of fortune or by his\r\nknowledge of the country, he succeeded completely in eluding the\r\nPersians and making good his escape. When Chosroes learned this, he was\r\ndeeply grieved at what had happened, and commanded some of his followers\r\nto burn the sanctuary of the archangel Michael which I have mentioned\r\nabove. And they, thinking that the sanctuary at Daphne was the one in\r\nquestion, burned it with the buildings about it, and they supposed that\r\nthe commands of Chosroes had been executed. Such, then, was the course\r\nof these events.\r\n\r\nBut Chosroes with his whole army proceeded on the way to Apamea. Now\r\nthere is a piece of wood one cubit in length in Apamea, a portion of the\r\ncross on which the Christ in Jerusalem once endured the punishment not\r\nunwillingly, as is generally agreed, and which in ancient times had been\r\nconveyed there secretly by a man of Syria. And the men of olden times,\r\nbelieving that it would be a great protection both for themselves and\r\nfor the city, made for it a sort of wooden chest and deposited it there;\r\nand they adorned this chest with much gold and with precious stones and\r\nthey entrusted it to three priests who were to guard it in all security;\r\nand they bring it forth every year and the whole population worship it\r\nduring one day. Now at that time the people of Apamea, upon learning\r\nthat the army of the Medes was coming against them, began to be in great\r\nfear. And when they heard that Chosroes was absolutely untruthful, they\r\ncame to Thomas, the chief priest of the city, and begged him to shew\r\nthem the wood of the cross, in order that after worshipping it for the\r\nlast time they might die. And he did as they requested. Then indeed it\r\nbefell that a sight surpassing both description and belief was there\r\nseen. For while the priest was carrying the wood and shewing it, above\r\nhim followed a flame of fire, and the portion of the roof over him was\r\nilluminated with a great and unaccustomed light. And while the priest\r\nwas moving through every part of the temple, the flame continued to\r\nadvance with him, keeping constantly the place above him in the roof. So\r\nthe people of Apamea, under the spell of joy at the miracle, were\r\nwondering and rejoicing and weeping, and already all felt confidence\r\nconcerning their safety. And Thomas, after going about the whole temple,\r\nlaid the wood of the cross in the chest and covered it, and suddenly the\r\nlight had ceased. Then upon learning that the army of the enemy had come\r\nclose to the city, he went in great haste to Chosroes. And when the king\r\nenquired of the priest whether it was the will of the citizens of Apamea\r\nto marshal themselves on the wall against the army of the Medes, the\r\npriest replied that no such thing had entered the minds of the men.\r\n\"Therefore,\" said Chosroes, \"receive me into the city accompanied by a\r\nfew men with all the gates opened wide.\" And the priest said \"Yes, for I\r\nhave come here to invite thee to do this very thing.\" So the whole army\r\npitched their tents and made camp before the fortifications.\r\n\r\nThen Chosroes chose out two hundred of the best of the Persians and\r\nentered the city. But when he had got inside the gates, he forgot\r\nwillingly enough what had been agreed upon between himself and the\r\nambassadors, and he commanded the bishop to give not only one thousand\r\npounds of silver nor even ten times that amount, but whatsoever\r\ntreasures were stored there, being all of gold and silver and of\r\nmarvellous great size. And I believe that he would not have shrunk from\r\nenslaving and plundering the whole city, unless some divine providence\r\nhad manifestly prevented him; to such a degree did avarice overpower him\r\nand the desire of fame turn his mind. For he thought the enslavement of\r\nthe cities a great glory for himself, considering it absolutely nothing\r\nthat disregarding treaties and compacts he was performing such deeds\r\nagainst the Romans. This attitude of Chosroes will be revealed by what\r\nhe undertook to do concerning the city of Daras during his withdrawal at\r\nthis same time, when he treated his agreements with absolute disregard,\r\nand also by what he did to the citizens of Callinicus a little later in\r\ntime of peace, as will be told by me in the following narrative[8]. But\r\nGod, as has been said, preserved Apamea. Now when Chosroes had seized\r\nall the treasures, and Thomas saw that he was already intoxicated with\r\nthe abundance of the wealth, then bringing out the wood of the cross\r\nwith the chest, he opened the chest and displaying the wood said: \"O\r\nmost mighty King, these alone are left me out of all the treasures. Now\r\nas for this chest (since it is adorned with gold and precious stones),\r\nwe do not begrudge thy taking it and keeping it with all the rest, but\r\nthis wood here, it is our salvation and precious to us, this, I beg and\r\nentreat thee, give to me.\" So spoke the priest. And Chosroes yielded and\r\nfulfilled the request.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, being filled with a desire for popular applause, he\r\ncommanded that the populace should go up into the hippodrome and that\r\nthe charioteers should hold their accustomed contests. And he himself\r\nwent up there also, eager to be a spectator of the performances. And\r\nsince he had heard long before that the Emperor Justinian was\r\nextraordinarily fond of the Venetus[9] colour, which is blue, wishing to\r\ngo against him there also, he was desirous of bringing about victory for\r\nthe green. So the charioteers, starting from the barriers, began the\r\ncontest, and by some chance he who was clad in the blue happened to pass\r\nhis rival and take the lead. And he was followed in the same tracks by\r\nthe wearer of the green colour. And Chosroes, thinking that this had\r\nbeen done purposely, was angry, and he cried out with a threat that the\r\nCaesar had wrongfully surpassed the others, and he commanded that the\r\nhorses which were running in front should be held up, in order that from\r\nthen on they might contend in the rear; and when this had been done just\r\nas he commanded, then Chosroes and the green faction were accounted\r\nvictorious. At that time one of the citizens of Apamea came before\r\nChosroes and accused a Persian of entering his house and violating his\r\nmaiden daughter. Upon hearing this, Chosroes, boiling with anger,\r\ncommanded that the man should be brought. And when he came before him,\r\nhe directed that he should be impaled in the camp. And when the people\r\nlearned this, they raised a mighty shout as loud as they could,\r\ndemanding that the man be saved from the king's anger. And Chosroes\r\npromised that he would release the man to them, but he secretly impaled\r\nhim not long afterwards. So after these things had been thus\r\naccomplished, he departed and marched back with the whole army.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nAnd when he came to the city of Chalcis, eighty-four stades distant from\r\nthe city of Beroea, he again seemed to forget the things which had been\r\nagreed upon, and encamping not far from the fortifications he sent\r\nPaulus to threaten the inhabitants of Chalcis, saying that he would take\r\nthe city by siege, unless they should purchase their safety by giving\r\nransom, and should give up to the Persians all the soldiers who were\r\nthere together with their leader. And the citizens of Chalcis were\r\nseized with great fear of both sovereigns, and they swore that, as for\r\nsoldiers, there were absolutely none of them in the city, although they\r\nhad hidden Adonachus, the commander of the soldiers, and others as well\r\nin some houses, in order that they might not be seen by the enemy; and\r\nwith difficulty they collected two centenaria[10] of gold, for the city\r\nthey inhabited was not very prosperous, and they gave them to Chosroes\r\nas the price of their lives and thus saved both the city and themselves.\r\n\r\nFrom there on Chosroes did not wish to continue the return journey by\r\nthe road he had come, but to cross the River Euphrates and gather by\r\nplunder as much money as possible from Mesopotamia. He therefore\r\nconstructed a bridge at the place called Obbane, which is forty stades\r\ndistant from the fortress in Barbalissum; then he himself went across\r\nand gave orders to the whole army to cross as quickly as possible,\r\nadding that he would break up the bridge on the third day, and he\r\nappointed also the time of the day. And when the appointed day was come,\r\nit happened that some of the army were left who had not yet crossed, but\r\nwithout the least consideration for them he sent the men to break up the\r\nbridge. And those who were left behind returned to their native land as\r\neach one could.\r\n\r\nThen a sort of ambition came over Chosroes to capture the city of\r\nEdessa. For he was led on to this by a saying of the Christians, and it\r\nkept irritating his mind, because they maintained that it could not be\r\ntaken, for the following reason. There was a certain Augarus in early\r\ntimes, toparch of Edessa (for thus the kings of the different nations\r\nwere called then). Now this Augarus was the most clever of all men of\r\nhis time, and as a result of this was an especial friend of the Emperor\r\nAugustus. For, desiring to make a treaty with the Romans, he came to\r\nRome; and when he conversed with Augustus, he so astonished him by the\r\nabundance of his wisdom that Augustus wished never more to give up his\r\ncompany; for he was an ardent lover of his conversation, and whenever he\r\nmet him, he was quite unwilling to depart from him. A long time,\r\ntherefore, was consumed by him in this visit. And one day when he was\r\ndesirous of returning to his native land and was utterly unable to\r\npersuade Augustus to let him go, he devised the following plan. He first\r\nwent out to hunt in the country about Rome; for it happened that he had\r\ntaken considerable interest in the practice of this sport. And going\r\nabout over a large tract of country, he captured alive many of the\r\nanimals of that region, and he gathered up and took with him from each\r\npart of the country some earth from the land; thus he returned to Rome\r\nbringing both the earth and the animals. Then Augustus went up into the\r\nhippodrome and seated himself as was his wont, and Augarus came before\r\nhim and displayed the earth and the animals, telling over from what\r\ndistrict each portion of earth was and what animals they were. Then he\r\ngave orders to put the earth in different parts of the hippodrome, and\r\nto gather all the animals into one place and then to release them. So\r\nthe attendants did as he directed. And the animals, separating from each\r\nother, went each to that portion of earth which was from the district in\r\nwhich it itself had been taken. And Augustus looked upon the performance\r\ncarefully for a very long time, and he was wondering that nature\r\nuntaught makes animals miss their native land. Then Augarus, suddenly\r\nlaying hold upon his knees, said: \"But as for me, O Master, what\r\nthoughts dost thou think I have, who possess a wife and children and a\r\nkingdom, small indeed, but in the land of my fathers?\" And the emperor,\r\novercome and compelled by the truth of his saying, granted not at all\r\nwillingly that he should go away, and bade him ask besides whatever he\r\nwished. And when Augarus had secured this, he begged of Augustus to\r\nbuild him a hippodrome in the city of Edessa. And he granted also this.\r\nThus then Augarus departed from Rome and came to Edessa. And the\r\ncitizens enquired of him whether he had come bringing any good thing for\r\nthem from the Emperor Augustus. And he answering said he had brought to\r\nthe inhabitants of Edessa pain without loss and pleasure without gain,\r\nhinting at the fortune of the hippodrome.\r\n\r\nAt a later time when Augarus was well advanced in years, he was seized\r\nwith an exceedingly violent attack of gout. And being distressed by the\r\npains and his inability to move in consequence of them, he carried the\r\nmatter to the physicians, and from the whole land he gathered all who\r\nwere skilled in these matters. But later he abandoned these men (for\r\nthey did not succeed in discovering any cure for the trouble), and\r\nfinding himself helpless, he bewailed the fate which was upon him. But\r\nabout that time Jesus, the Son of God, was in the body and moving among\r\nthe men of Palestine, shewing manifestly by the fact that he never\r\nsinned at all, and also by his performing even things impossible, that\r\nhe was the Son of God in very truth; for he called the dead and raised\r\nthem up as if from sleep, and opened the eyes of men who had been born\r\nblind, and cleansed those whose whole bodies were covered with leprosy,\r\nand released those whose feet were maimed, and he cured all the other\r\ndiseases which are called by the physicians incurable. When these things\r\nwere reported to Augarus by those who travelled from Palestine to\r\nEdessa, he took courage and wrote a letter to Jesus, begging him to\r\ndepart from Judaea and the senseless people there, and to spend his life\r\nwith him from that time forward. When the Christ saw this message, he\r\nwrote in reply to Augarus, saying distinctly that he would not come, but\r\npromising him health in the letter. And they say that he added this also\r\nthat never would the city be liable to capture by the barbarians. This\r\nfinal portion of the letter was entirely unknown to those who wrote the\r\nhistory of that time; for they did not even make mention of it anywhere;\r\nbut the men of Edessa say that they found it with the letter, so that\r\nthey have even caused the letter to be inscribed in this form on the\r\ngates of the city instead of any other defence. The city did in fact\r\ncome under the Medes a short time afterwards, not by capture however,\r\nbut in the following manner. A short time after Augarus received the\r\nletter of the Christ, he became free from suffering, and after living on\r\nin health for a long time, he came to his end. But that one of his sons\r\nwho succeeded to the kingdom shewed himself the most unholy of all men,\r\nand besides committing many other wrongs against his subjects, he\r\nvoluntarily went over to the Persians, fearing the vengeance which was\r\nto come from the Romans. But long after this the citizens of Edessa\r\ndestroyed the barbarian guards who were dwelling with them, and gave the\r\ncity into the hands of the Romans. * * *[11] he is eager to attach it to\r\nhis cause, judging by what has happened in my time, which I shall\r\npresent in the appropriate place. And the thought once occurred to me\r\nthat, if the Christ did not write this thing just as I have told it,\r\nstill, since men have come to believe in it, He wishes to guard the city\r\nuncaptured for this reason, that He may never give them any pretext for\r\nerror. As for these things, then, let them be as God wills, and so let\r\nthem be told.\r\n\r\nFor this reason it seemed to Chosroes at that time a matter of moment to\r\ncapture Edessa. And when he came to Batne, a small stronghold of no\r\nimportance, one day's journey distant from Edessa, he bivouacked there\r\nfor that night, but at early dawn he was on the march to Edessa with his\r\nwhole army. But it fell out that they lost their way and wandered about,\r\nand on the following night bivouacked in the same place; and they say\r\nthat this happened to them a second time also. When with difficulty\r\nChosroes reached the neighbourhood of Edessa, they say that suppuration\r\nset in in his face and his jaw became swollen. For this reason he was\r\nquite unwilling to make an attempt on the city, but he sent Paulus and\r\ndemanded money from the citizens. And they said that they had absolutely\r\nno fear concerning the city, but in order that he might not damage the\r\ncountry they agreed to give two centenaria of gold. And Chosroes took\r\nthe money and kept the agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nAt that time also the Emperor Justinian wrote a letter to Chosroes,\r\npromising to carry out the agreement which had been made by him and the\r\nambassadors regarding the peace[12]. When this message was received by\r\nChosroes, he released the hostages and made preparations for his\r\ndeparture, and he wished to sell off all the captives from Antioch. And\r\nwhen the citizens of Edessa learned of this, they displayed an\r\nunheard-of zeal. For there was not a person who did not bring ransom for\r\nthe captives and deposit it in the sanctuary according to the measure of\r\nhis possessions. And there were some who even exceeded their\r\nproportionate amount in so doing. For the harlots took off all the\r\nadornment which they wore on their persons, and threw it down there, and\r\nany farmer who was in want of plate or of money, but who had an ass or a\r\nsheep, brought this to the sanctuary with great zeal. So there was\r\ncollected an exceedingly great amount of gold and silver and money in\r\nother forms, but not a bit of it was given for ransom. For Bouzes\r\nhappened to be present there, and he took in hand to prevent the\r\ntransaction, expecting that this would bring him some great gain.\r\nTherefore Chosroes moved forward, taking with him all the captives. And\r\nthe citizens of Carrhae met him holding out to him great sums of money;\r\nbut he said that it did not belong to him because the most of them are\r\nnot Christians but are of the old faith.\r\n\r\nBut when, likewise, the citizens of Constantina offered money, he\r\naccepted it, although he asserted that the city belonged to him from his\r\nfathers. [503 A.D.] For at the time when Cabades took Amida, he wished\r\nalso to capture Edessa and Constantina. But when he came near to Edessa\r\nhe enquired of the Magi whether it would be possible for him to capture\r\nthe city, pointing out the place to them with his right hand. But they\r\nsaid that the city would not be captured by him by any device, judging\r\nby the fact that in stretching out his right hand to it he was not\r\ngiving thereby the sign of capture or of any other grievous thing, but\r\nof salvation. And when Cabades heard this, he was convinced and led his\r\narmy on to Constantina. And upon arriving there, he issued orders to the\r\nwhole army to encamp for a siege. Now the priest of Constantina was at\r\nthat time Baradotus, a just man and especially beloved of God, and his\r\nprayers for this reason were always effectual for whatever he wished;\r\nand even seeing his face one would have straightway surmised that this\r\nman was most completely acceptable to God. This Baradotus came then to\r\nCabades bearing wine and dried figs and honey and unblemished loaves,\r\nand entreated him not to make an attempt on a city which was not of any\r\nimportance and which was very much neglected by the Romans, having\r\nneither a garrison of soldiers nor any other defence, but only the\r\ninhabitants, who were pitiable folk. Thus spoke the priest; and Cabades\r\npromised that he would grant him the city freely, and he presented him\r\nwith all the food-supplies which had been prepared by him for the army\r\nin anticipation of the siege, an exceedingly great quantity; and thus he\r\ndeparted from the land of the Romans. For this reason it was that\r\nChosroes claimed that the city belonged to him from his fathers.\r\n\r\nAnd when he reached Daras, he began a siege; but within the city the\r\nRomans and Martinus, their general (for it happened that he was there),\r\nmade their preparations for resistance. Now the city is surrounded by\r\ntwo walls, the inner one of which is of great size and a truly wonderful\r\nthing to look upon (for each tower reaches to a height of a hundred\r\nfeet, and the rest of the wall to sixty), while the outer wall is much\r\nsmaller, but in other respects strong and one to be reckoned with\r\nseriously. And the space between has a breadth of not less than fifty\r\nfeet; in that place the citizens of Daras are accustomed to put their\r\ncattle and other animals when an enemy assails them. At first then\r\nChosroes made an assault on the fortifications toward the west, and\r\nforcing back his opponents by overwhelming numbers of missiles, he set\r\nfire to the gates of the small wall. However no one of the barbarians\r\ndared to get inside. Next he decided to make a tunnel secretly at the\r\neastern side of the city. For at this point alone can the earth be dug,\r\nsince the other parts of the fortifications were set upon rock by the\r\nbuilders. So the Persians began to dig, beginning from their trench. And\r\nsince this was very deep, they were neither observed by the enemy nor\r\ndid they afford them any means of discovering what was being done. So\r\nthey had already gone under the foundations of the outer wall, and were\r\nabout to reach the space between the two walls and soon after to pass\r\nalso the great wall and take the city by force; but since it was not\r\nfated to be captured by the Persians, someone from the camp of Chosroes\r\ncame alone about midday close to the fortifications, whether a man or\r\nsomething else greater than man, and he made it appear to those who saw\r\nhim that he was collecting the weapons which the Romans had a little\r\nbefore discharged from the wall against the barbarians who were\r\nassailing them. And while doing this and holding his shield before him,\r\nhe seemed to be bantering those who were on the parapet and taunting\r\nthem with laughter. Then he told them of everything and commanded them\r\nall to be on the watch and to take all possible care for their safety.\r\nAfter revealing these things he was off, while the Romans with much\r\nshouting and confusion were ordering men to dig the ground between the\r\ntwo walls. The Persians, on the other hand, not knowing what was being\r\ndone, were pushing on the work no less than before. So while the\r\nPersians were making a straight way underground to the wall of the city,\r\nthe Romans by the advice of Theodoras, a man learned in the science\r\ncalled mechanics, were constructing their trench in a cross-wise\r\ndirection and making it of sufficient depth, so that when the Persians\r\nhad reached the middle point between the two circuit-walls they suddenly\r\nbroke into the trench of the Romans. And the first of them the Romans\r\nkilled, while those in the rear by fleeing at top speed into the camp\r\nsaved themselves. For the Romans decided by no means to pursue them in\r\nthe dark. So Chosroes, failing in this attempt and having no hope that\r\nhe would take the city by any device thereafter, opened negotiations\r\nwith the besieged, and carrying away a thousand pounds of silver he\r\nretired into the land of Persia. When this came to the knowledge of the\r\nEmperor Justinian, he was no longer willing to carry the agreement into\r\neffect, charging Chosroes with having attempted to capture the city of\r\nDaras during a truce. Such were the fortunes of the Romans during the\r\nfirst invasion of Chosroes; and the summer drew to its close.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nNow Chosroes built a city in Assyria in a place one day's journey\r\ndistant from the city of Ctesiphon, and he named it the Antioch of\r\nChosroes and settled there all the captives from Antioch, constructing\r\nfor them a bath and a hippodrome and providing that they should have\r\nfree enjoyment of their other luxuries besides. For he brought with him\r\ncharioteers and musicians both from Antioch and from the other Roman\r\ncities. Besides this he always provisioned these citizens of Antioch at\r\npublic expense more carefully than in the fashion of captives, and he\r\nrequired that they be called king's subjects, so as to be subordinate to\r\nno one of the magistrates, but to the king alone. And if any one else\r\ntoo who was a Roman in slavery ran away and succeeded in escaping to the\r\nAntioch of Chosroes, and if he was called a kinsman by any one of those\r\nwho lived there, it was no longer possible for the owner of this captive\r\nto take him away, not even if he who had enslaved the man happened to be\r\na person of especial note among the Persians.\r\n\r\nThus, then, the portent which had come to the citizens of Antioch in the\r\nreign of Anastasius reached this final fulfilment for them. For at that\r\ntime a violent wind suddenly fell upon the suburb of Daphne, and some of\r\nthe cypresses which were there of extraordinary height were overturned\r\nfrom the extremities of their roots and fell to the earth--trees which\r\nthe law forbade absolutely to be cut down. [526 A.D.] Accordingly, a\r\nlittle later, when Justinus was ruling over the Romans, the place was\r\nvisited by an exceedingly violent earthquake, which shook down the whole\r\ncity and straightway brought to the ground the most and the finest of\r\nthe buildings, and it is said that at that time three hundred thousand\r\nof the population of Antioch perished. And finally in this capture the\r\nwhole city, as has been said, was destroyed. Such, then, was the\r\ncalamity which befell the men of Antioch.\r\n\r\nAnd Belisarius came to Byzantium from Italy, summoned by the emperor;\r\nand after he had spent the winter in Byzantium, the emperor sent him as\r\ngeneral against Chosroes and the Persians at the opening of spring,\r\ntogether with the officers who had come with him from Italy, one of\r\nwhom, Valerianus, he commanded to lead the troops in Armenia. [541 A.D.]\r\nFor Martinus had been sent immediately to the East, and for this reason\r\nChosroes found him at Daras, as has been stated above. And among the\r\nGoths, Vittigis remained in Byzantium, but all the rest marched with\r\nBelisarius against Chosroes. At that time one of the envoys of Vittigis,\r\nhe who was assuming the name of bishop, died in the land of Persia, and\r\nthe other one remained there. And the man who followed them as\r\ninterpreter withdrew to the land of the Romans, and John, who was\r\ncommanding the troops in Mesopotamia, arrested him near the boundaries\r\nof Constantina, and bringing him into the city confined him in a prison;\r\nthere the man in answer to his enquiries related everything which had\r\nbeen done. Such, then, was the course of these events. And Belisarius\r\nand his followers went in haste, since he was eager to anticipate\r\nChosroes' making any second invasion into the land of the Romans.\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nBut in the meantime Chosroes was leading his army against Colchis, where\r\nthe Lazi were calling him in for the following reason. The Lazi at first\r\ndwelt in the land of Colchis as subjects of the Romans, but not to the\r\nextent of paying them tribute or obeying their commands in any respect,\r\nexcept that, whenever their king died, the Roman emperor would send\r\nemblems of the office to him who was about to succeed to the throne. And\r\nhe, together with his subjects, guarded strictly the boundaries of the\r\nland in order that hostile Huns might not proceed from the Caucasus\r\nmountains, which adjoin their territory, through Lazica and invade the\r\nland of the Romans. And they kept guard without receiving money or\r\ntroops from the Romans and without ever joining the Roman armies, but\r\nthey were always engaged in commerce by sea with the Romans who live on\r\nthe Black Sea. For they themselves have neither salt nor grain nor any\r\nother good thing, but by furnishing skins and hides and slaves they\r\nsecured the supplies which they needed. But when the events came to pass\r\nin which Gourgenes, the king of the Iberians, was concerned, as has been\r\ntold in the preceding narrative[13], Roman soldiers began to be\r\nquartered among the Lazi; and these barbarians were annoyed by the\r\nsoldiers, and most of all by Peter, the general, a man who was prone to\r\ntreat insolently those who came into contact with him. This Peter was a\r\nnative of Arzanene, which is beyond the River Nymphius, a district\r\nsubject to the Persians from of old, but while still a child he had been\r\ncaptured and enslaved by the Emperor Justinus at the time when Justinus,\r\nafter the taking of Amida, was invading the land of the Persians with\r\nCeler's army.[14] And since his owner showed him great kindness, he\r\nattended the school of a grammatist. And at first he became secretary to\r\nJustinus, but when, after the death of Anastasius, Justinus took over\r\nthe Roman empire, Peter was made a general, and he degenerated into a\r\nslave of avarice, if anyone ever did, and shewed himself very fatuous in\r\nhis treatment of all.\r\n\r\nAnd later the Emperor Justinian sent different officers to Lazica, and\r\namong them John, whom they called Tzibus, a man of obscure and ignoble\r\ndescent, but who had climbed to the office of general by virtue of no\r\nother thing than that he was the most accomplished villain in the world\r\nand most successful in discovering unlawful sources of revenue. This man\r\nunsettled and threw into confusion all the relations of the Romans and\r\nthe Lazi. He also persuaded the Emperor Justinian to build a city on the\r\nsea in Lazica, Petra by name; and there he sat as in a citadel and\r\nplundered the property of the Lazi. For the salt, and all other cargoes\r\nwhich were considered necessary for the Lazi, it was no longer possible\r\nfor the merchants to bring into the land of Colchis, nor could they\r\npurchase them elsewhere by sending for them, but he set up in Petra the\r\nso-called \"monopoly\" and himself became a retail dealer and overseer of\r\nall the handling of these things, buying everything and selling it to\r\nthe Colchians, not at the customary rates, but as dearly as possible. At\r\nthe same time, even apart from this, the barbarians were annoyed by the\r\nRoman army quartered upon them, a thing which had not been customary\r\npreviously. Accordingly, since they were no longer able to endure these\r\nthings, they decided to attach themselves to the Persians and Chosroes,\r\nand immediately they sent to them envoys who were to arrange this\r\nwithout the knowledge of the Romans. These men had been instructed that\r\nthey should take pledges from Chosroes that he would never give up the\r\nLazi against their will to the Romans, and that with this understanding\r\nthey should bring him with the Persian army into the land.\r\n\r\nAccordingly the envoys went to the Persians, and coming secretly before\r\nChosroes they said: \"If any people in all time have revolted from their\r\nown friends in any manner whatsoever and attached themselves wrongfully\r\nto men utterly unknown to them, and after that by the kindness of\r\nfortune have been brought back once more with greatest rejoicing to\r\nthose who were formerly their own, consider, O Most mighty King, that\r\nsuch as these are the Lazi. For the Colchians in ancient times, as\r\nallies of the Persians, rendered them many good services and were\r\nthemselves treated in like manner; and of these things there are many\r\nrecords in books, some of which we have, while others are preserved in\r\nthy palace up to the present time. But at a later time it came about\r\nthat our ancestors, whether neglected by you or for some other reason\r\n(for we are unable to ascertain anything certain about this matter),\r\nbecame allies of the Romans. And now we and the king of Lazica give to\r\nthe Persians both ourselves and our land to treat in any way you may\r\ndesire. And we beg of you to think thus concerning us: if, on the one\r\nhand, we have suffered nothing outrageous at the hands of the Romans,\r\nbut have been prompted by foolish motives in coming to you, reject this\r\nprayer of ours straightway, considering that with you likewise the\r\nColchians will never be trustworthy (for when a friendship has been\r\ndissolved, a second friendship formed with others becomes, owing to its\r\ncharacter, a matter of reproach); but if we have been in name friends of\r\nthe Romans, but in fact their loyal slaves, and have suffered impious\r\ntreatment at the hands of those who have tyrannized over us, receive us,\r\nyour former allies, and acquire as slaves those whom you used to treat\r\nas friends, and shew your hatred of a cruel tyranny which has risen thus\r\non our borders, by acting worthily of that justice which it has always\r\nbeen the tradition of the Persians to defend. For the man who himself\r\ndoes no wrong is not just, unless he is also accustomed to rescue those\r\nwho are wronged by others when he has it in his power. But it is worth\r\nwhile to tell a few of the things which the accursed Romans have dared\r\nto do against us. In the first place they have left our king only the\r\nform of royal power, while they themselves have appropriated the actual\r\nauthority, and he sits a king in the position of a servant, fearing the\r\ngeneral who issues the orders; and they have put upon us a multitude of\r\nsoldiery, not in order to guard the land against those who harass us\r\n(for not one of our neighbours except, indeed, the Romans has disturbed\r\nus), but in order that they may confine us as in a prison and make\r\nthemselves masters of our possessions. And purposing to make more speedy\r\nthe robbery of what we have, behold, O King, what sort of a design they\r\nhave formed; the supplies which are in excess among them they compel the\r\nLazi to buy against their will, while those things which are most useful\r\nto them among the products of Lazica these fellows demand to buy, as\r\nthey put it, from us, the price being determined in both cases by the\r\njudgment of the stronger party. And thus they are robbing us of all our\r\ngold as well as of the necessities of life, using the fair name of\r\ntrade, but in fact oppressing us as thoroughly as they possibly can. And\r\nthere has been set over us as ruler a huckster who has made our\r\ndestitution a kind of business by virtue of the authority of his office.\r\nThe cause of our revolt, therefore, being of this sort, has justice on\r\nits side; but the advantage which you yourselves will gain if you\r\nreceive the request of the Lazi we shall forthwith tell. To the realm of\r\nPersia you will add a most ancient kingdom, and as a result of this you\r\nwill have the power of your sway extended, and it will come about that\r\nyou will have a part in the sea of the Romans through our land, and\r\nafter thou hast built ships in this sea, O King, it will be possible for\r\nthee with no trouble to set foot in the palace in Byzantium. For there\r\nis no obstacle between. And one might add that the plundering of the\r\nland of the Romans every year by the barbarians along the boundary will\r\nbe under your control. For surely you also are acquainted with the fact\r\nthat up till now the land of the Lazi has been a bulwark against the\r\nCaucasus mountains. So with justice leading the way, and advantage added\r\nthereto, we consider that not to receive our words with favour would be\r\nwholly contrary to good judgment.\" So spoke the envoys.\r\n\r\nAnd Chosroes, delighted by their words, promised to protect the Lazi,\r\nand enquired of the envoys whether it was possible for him to enter the\r\nland of Colchis with a large army. For he said that previously he had\r\nheard many persons report that the land was exceedingly hard to traverse\r\neven for an unimpeded traveller, being extremely rugged and covered very\r\nextensively by thick forests of wide-spreading trees. But the envoys\r\nstoutly maintained to him that the way through the country would be easy\r\nfor the whole Persian army, if they cut the trees and threw them into\r\nthe places which were made difficult by precipices. And they promised\r\nthat they themselves would be guides of the route, and would take the\r\nlead in this work for the Persians. Encouraged by this suggestion,\r\nChosroes gathered a great army and made his preparations for the inroad,\r\nnot disclosing the plan to the Persians except those alone to whom he\r\nwas accustomed to communicate his secrets, and commanding the envoys to\r\ntell no one what was being done; and he pretended that he was setting\r\nout into Iberia, in order to settle matters there; for a Hunnic tribe,\r\nhe kept saying in explanation, had assailed the Persian domain at that\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nAt this time Belisarius had arrived in Mesopotamia and was gathering his\r\narmy from every quarter, and he also kept sending men into the land of\r\nPersia to act as spies. And wishing himself to encounter the enemy\r\nthere, if they should again make an incursion into the land of the\r\nRomans, he was organizing on the spot and equipping the soldiers, who\r\nwere for the most part without either arms or armour, and in terror of\r\nthe name of the Persians. Now the spies returned and declared that for\r\nthe present there would be no invasion of the enemy; for Chosroes was\r\noccupied elsewhere with a war against the Huns. And Belisarius, upon\r\nlearning this, wished to invade the land of the enemy immediately with\r\nhis whole army. Arethas also came to him with a large force of Saracens,\r\nand besides the emperor wrote a letter instructing him to invade the\r\nenemy's country with all speed. He therefore called together all the\r\nofficers in Daras and spoke as follows: \"I know that all of you, my\r\nfellow officers, are experienced in many wars, and I have brought you\r\ntogether at the present time, not in order to stir up your minds against\r\nthe enemy by addressing to you any reminder or exhortation (for I think\r\nthat you need no speech that prompts to daring), but in order that we\r\nmay deliberate together among ourselves, and choose rather the course\r\nwhich may seem fairest and best for the cause of the emperor. For war is\r\nwont to succeed by reason of careful planning more than by anything\r\nelse. Now it is necessary that those who gather for deliberation should\r\nmake their minds entirely free from modesty and from fear. For fear, by\r\nparalyzing those who have fallen into it, does not allow the reason to\r\nchoose the nobler part, and modesty obscures what has been seen to be\r\nthe better course and leads investigation the opposite way. If,\r\ntherefore, it seems to you that any purpose has been formed either by\r\nour mighty emperor or by me concerning the present situation, let no\r\nthought of this enter your minds. For, as for him, he is altogether\r\nignorant of what is being done, and is therefore unable to adapt his\r\nmoves to opportune moments; there is therefore no fear but that in going\r\ncontrary to him we shall do that which will be of advantage to his\r\ncause. And as for me, since I am human, and have come here from the West\r\nafter a long interval, it is impossible that some of the necessary\r\nthings should not escape me. So it behoves you, without any too modest\r\nregard for my opinion, to say outright whatever is going to be of\r\nadvantage for ourselves and for the emperor. Now in the beginning,\r\nfellow officers, we came here in order to prevent the enemy from making\r\nany invasion into our land, but at the present time, since things have\r\ngone better for us than we had hoped, it is possible for us to make his\r\nland the subject of our deliberation. And now that you have been\r\ngathered together for this purpose, it is fair, I think, that you should\r\ntell without any concealment what seems to each one best and most\r\nadvantageous.\" Thus spoke Belisarius.\r\n\r\nAnd Peter and Bouzes urged him to lead the army without any hesitation\r\nagainst the enemy's country. And their opinion was followed immediately\r\nby the whole council. Rhecithancus, however, and Theoctistus, the\r\ncommanders of the troops in Lebanon, said that, while they too had the\r\nsame wish as the others concerning the invasion, they feared that if\r\nthey abandoned the country of Phoenicia and Syria, Alamoundaras would\r\nplunder it at his leisure, and that the emperor would be angry with them\r\nbecause they had not guarded and kept unplundered the territory under\r\ntheir command, and for this reason they were quite unwilling to join the\r\nrest of the army in the invasion. But Belisarius said that the opinion\r\nof these two men was not in the least degree true; for it was the season\r\nof the vernal equinox, and at this season the Saracens always dedicated\r\nabout two months to their god, and during this time never undertook any\r\ninroad into the land of others. Agreeing, therefore, to release both of\r\nthem with their followers within sixty days, he commanded them also to\r\nfollow with the rest of the army. So Belisarius was making his\r\npreparation for the invasion with great zeal.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nBut Chosroes and the Median army, after crossing Iberia, reached the\r\nterritory of Lazica under the leadership of the envoys; there with no\r\none to withstand them they began to cut down the trees which grow\r\nthickly over that very mountainous region, rising to a great height, and\r\nspreading out their branches remarkably, so that they made the country\r\nabsolutely impassable for the army; and these they threw into the rough\r\nplaces, and thus rendered the road altogether easy. And when they\r\narrived in the centre of Colchis (the place where the tales of the poets\r\nsay that the adventure of Medea and Jason took place), Goubazes, the\r\nking of the Lazi, came and did obeisance to Chosroes, the son of\r\nCabades, as Lord, putting himself together with his palace and all\r\nLazica into his hand.\r\n\r\nNow there is a coast city named Petra in Colchis, on the sea which is\r\ncalled the Euxine, which in former times had been a place of no\r\nimportance, but which the Emperor Justinian had rendered strong and\r\notherwise conspicuous by means of the circuit-wall and other buildings\r\nwhich he erected. When Chosroes ascertained that the Roman army was in\r\nthat place with John, he sent an army and a general, Aniabedes, against\r\nthem in order to capture the place at the first onset. But John, upon\r\nlearning of their approach, gave orders that no one should go outside\r\nthe fortifications nor allow himself to be seen from the parapet by the\r\nenemy, and he armed the whole army and stationed them in the vicinity of\r\nthe gates, commanding them to keep silence and not allow the least sound\r\nof any kind to escape from them. So the Persians came close to the\r\nfortifications, and since nothing of the enemy was either seen or heard\r\nby them they thought that the Romans had abandoned the city and left it\r\ndestitute of men. For this reason they closed in still more around the\r\nfortifications, so as to set up ladders immediately, since no one was\r\ndefending the wall. And neither seeing nor hearing anything of the\r\nenemy, they sent to Chosroes and explained the situation. And he sent\r\nthe greater part of the army, commanding them to make an attempt upon\r\nthe fortifications from all sides, and he directed one of the officers\r\nto make use of the engine known as a ram around the gate, while he\r\nhimself, seated on the hill which lies very close to the city, became a\r\nspectator of the operations. And straightway the Romans opened the gates\r\nall of a sudden, and unexpectedly fell upon and slew great numbers of\r\nthe enemy, and especially those stationed about the ram; the rest with\r\ndifficulty made their escape together with the general and were saved.\r\nAnd Chosroes, filled with rage, impaled Aniabedes, since he had been\r\noutgeneralled by John, a tradesman and an altogether unwarlike man. But\r\nsome say that not Aniabedes, but the officer commanding the men who were\r\nworking the ram was impaled. And he himself broke camp with the whole\r\narmy, and coming close to the fortifications of Petra, made camp and\r\nbegan a siege. On the following day he went completely around the\r\nfortifications, and since he suspected that they could not support a\r\nvery strong attack, he decided to storm the wall. And bringing up the\r\nwhole army there, he opened the action, commanding all to shoot with\r\ntheir bows against the parapet. The Romans, meanwhile, in defending\r\nthemselves, made use of their engines of war and all their bows. At\r\nfirst, then, the Persians did the Romans little harm, although they were\r\nshooting their arrows thick and fast, while at the same time they\r\nsuffered severely at the hands of the Romans, since they were being shot\r\nat from an elevation. But later on (since it was fated that Petra be\r\ncaptured by Chosroes), John by some chance was shot in the neck and\r\ndied, and as a result of this the other Romans ceased to care for\r\nanything. Then indeed the barbarians withdrew to their camp; for it was\r\nalready growing dark; but on the following day they planned to assail\r\nthe fortifications by an excavation, as follows.\r\n\r\nThe city of Petra is on one side inaccessible on account of the sea, and\r\non the other on account of the sheer cliffs which rise there on every\r\nhand; indeed it is from this circumstance that the city has received the\r\nname it bears. And it has only one approach on the level ground, and\r\nthat not very broad; for exceedingly high cliffs overhang it on either\r\nside. At that point those who formerly built the city provided that that\r\nportion of the wall should not be open to attack by making long walls\r\nwhich ran along beside either cliff and guarded the approach for a great\r\ndistance. And they built two towers, one in each of these walls, not\r\nfollowing the customary plan, but as follows. They refused to allow the\r\nspace in the middle of the structure to be empty, but constructed the\r\nentire towers from the ground up to a great height of very large stones\r\nwhich fitted together, in order that they might never be shaken down by\r\na ram or any other engine. Such, then, are the fortifications of Petra.\r\nBut the Persians secretly made a tunnel into the earth and got under one\r\nof the two towers, and from there carried out many of the stones and in\r\ntheir place put wood, which a little later they burned. And the flame,\r\nrising little by little, weakened the stones, and all of a sudden shook\r\nthe whole tower violently and straightway brought it down to the ground.\r\nAnd the Romans who were on the tower perceived what was being done in\r\nsufficient time so that they did not fall with it to the ground, but\r\nthey fled and got inside the city wall. And now it was possible for the\r\nenemy to storm the wall from the level, and thus with no trouble to take\r\nthe city by force. The Romans, therefore, in terror, opened negotiations\r\nwith the barbarians, and receiving from Chosroes pledges concerning\r\ntheir lives and their property, they surrendered to him both themselves\r\nand the city. [541 A.D.] Thus Chosroes captured Petra. And finding the\r\ntreasures of John, which were extremely rich, he took them himself, but\r\nbesides this neither he himself nor anyone else of the Persians touched\r\nanything, and the Romans, retaining their own possessions, mingled with\r\nthe Median army.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nMeantime Belisarius and the Roman army, having learned nothing of what\r\nwas being done there, were going in excellent order from the city of\r\nDaras toward Nisibis. And when they had reached the middle of their\r\njourney, Belisarius led the army to the right where there were abundant\r\nsprings of water and level ground sufficient for all to camp upon. And\r\nthere he gave orders to make a camp at about forty-two stades from the\r\ncity of Nisibis. But all the others marvelled greatly that he did not\r\nwish to camp close to the fortifications, and some were quite unwilling\r\nto follow him. Belisarius therefore addressed those of the officers who\r\nwere about him thus: \"It was not my wish to disclose to all what I am\r\nthinking. For talk carried about through a camp cannot keep secrets, for\r\nit advances little by little until it is carried out even to the enemy.\r\nBut seeing that the majority of you are allowing yourselves to act in a\r\nmost disorderly manner, and that each one wishes to be himself supreme\r\ncommander in the war, I shall now say among you things about which one\r\nought to keep silence, mentioning, however, this first, that when many\r\nin an army follow independent judgments it is impossible that anything\r\nneedful be done. Now I think that Chosroes, in going against other\r\nbarbarians, has by no means left his own land without sufficient\r\nprotection, and in particular this city which is of the first rank and\r\nis set as a defence to his whole land. In this city I know well that he\r\nhas stationed soldiers in such number and of such valour as to be\r\nsufficient to stand in the way of our assaults. And the proof of this\r\nyou have near at hand. For he put in command of these men the general\r\nNabedes, who, after Chosroes himself at least, seems to be first among\r\nthe Persians in glory and in every other sort of honour. This man, I\r\nbelieve, will both make trial of our strength and will permit of our\r\npassing by on no other condition than that he be defeated by us in\r\nbattle. If, therefore, the conflict should be close by the city, the\r\nstruggle will not be even for us and the Persians. For they, coming out\r\nfrom their stronghold against us, in case of success, should it so\r\nhappen, will feel unlimited confidence in assailing us, and in case of\r\ndefeat they will easily escape from our attack. For we shall only be\r\nable to pursue them a short distance, and from this no harm will come to\r\nthe city, which you surely see cannot be captured by storming the wall\r\nwhen soldiers are defending it. But if the enemy engage with us here and\r\nwe conquer them, I have great hopes, fellow officers, of capturing the\r\ncity. For while our antagonists are fleeing a long way, we shall either\r\nmingle with them and rush inside the gates with them, as is probable, or\r\nwe shall anticipate them and compel them to turn and escape to some\r\nother place, and thus render Nisibis without its defenders easy of\r\ncapture for us.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Belisarius had said this, all the others except Peter were\r\nconvinced, and they made camp and remained with him. He, however,\r\nassociating with himself John, who commanded the troops in Mesopotamia\r\nand had no small part of the army, came up to a position not far removed\r\nfrom the fortifications, about ten stades away, and remained quietly\r\nthere. But Belisarius marshalled the men who were with him as if for\r\ncombat, and sent word to Peter and his men also to hold themselves in\r\narray for battle, until he himself should give the signal; and he said\r\nthat he knew well that the barbarians would attack them about midday,\r\nremembering, as they surely would, that while they themselves are\r\naccustomed to partake of food in the late afternoon, the Romans do so\r\nabout midday. So Belisarius gave this warning; but Peter and his men\r\ndisregarded his commands, and about midday, being distressed by the sun\r\n(for the place is exceedingly dry and hot), they stacked their arms, and\r\nwith never a thought of the enemy began to go about in disorderly\r\nfashion and eat gourds which grew there. And when this was observed by\r\nNabedes, he led the Persian army running at full speed against them. And\r\nthe Romans, since they did not fail to observe that the Persians were\r\ncoming out of the fortifications (for they were seen clearly because\r\nmoving over a level plain), sent to Belisarius urging him to support\r\nthem, and they themselves snatched up their arms, and in disorder and\r\nconfusion confronted their foe. But Belisarius and his men, even before\r\nthe messenger had reached them, discovered by the dust the attack of the\r\nPersians, and went to the rescue on the run. And when the Persians came\r\nup, the Romans did not withstand their onset, but were routed without\r\nany difficulty, and the Persians, following close upon them, killed\r\nfifty men, and seized and kept the standard of Peter. And they would\r\nhave slain them all in this pursuit, for the Romans had no thought of\r\nresistance, if Belisarius and the army with him had not come upon them\r\nand prevented it. For as the Goths, first of all, came upon them with\r\nlong spears in close array, the Persians did not await their attack but\r\nbeat a hasty retreat. And the Romans together with the Goths followed\r\nthem up and slew a hundred and fifty men. For the pursuit was only of\r\nshort duration, and the others quickly got inside the fortifications.\r\nThen indeed all the Romans withdrew to the camp of Belisarius, and the\r\nPersians on the following day set up on a tower instead of a trophy the\r\nstandard of Peter, and hanging sausages from it they taunted the enemy\r\nwith laughter; however, they no longer dared to come out against them,\r\nbut they guarded the city securely.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nAnd Belisarius, seeing that Nisibis was exceedingly strong, and having\r\nno hope regarding its capture, was eager to go forward, in order that he\r\nmight do the enemy some damage by a sudden inroad. Accordingly he broke\r\ncamp and moved forward with the whole army. And after accomplishing a\r\nday's journey, they came upon a fortress which the Persians call\r\nSisauranon. There were in that place besides the numerous population\r\neight hundred horsemen, the best of the Persians, who were keeping guard\r\nunder command of a man of note, Bleschames by name. And the Romans made\r\ncamp close by the fortress and began a siege, but, upon making an\r\nassault upon the fortifications, they were beaten back, losing many men\r\nin the fight. For the wall happened to be extremely strong, and the\r\nbarbarians defended it against their assailants with the greatest\r\nvigour. Belisarius therefore called together all the officers and spoke\r\nas follows: \"Experience in many wars, fellow officers, has made it\r\npossible for us in difficult situations to foresee what will come to\r\npass, and has made us capable of avoiding disaster by choosing the\r\nbetter course. You understand, therefore, how great a mistake it is for\r\nan army to proceed into a hostile land, when many strongholds and many\r\nfighting men in them have been left in the rear. Now exactly this has\r\nhappened to us in the present case. For if we continue our advance, some\r\nof the enemy from this place as well as from the city of Nisibis will\r\nfollow us secretly and will, in all probability, handle us roughly in\r\nplaces which are for them conveniently adapted for an ambuscade or some\r\nother sort of attack. And if, by any chance, a second army confronts us\r\nand opens battle, it will be necessary for us to array ourselves against\r\nboth, and we should thus suffer irreparable harm at their hands. And in\r\nsaying this I do not mention the fact that if we fail in the engagement,\r\nshould it so happen, we shall after that have absolutely no way of\r\nreturn left to the land of the Romans. Let us not therefore by reason of\r\nmost ill-considered haste seem to have been our own despoilers, nor by\r\nour eagerness for strife do harm to the cause of the Romans. For stupid\r\ndaring leads to destruction, but discreet hesitation is well adapted\r\nalways to save those who adopt such a course. Let us therefore establish\r\nourselves here and endeavour to capture this fortress, and let Arethas\r\nwith his forces be sent into the country of Assyria. For the Saracens\r\nare by nature unable to storm a wall, but the cleverest of all men at\r\nplundering. And some of the soldiers who are good fighters will join\r\nthem in the invasion, so that, if no opposition presents itself to them,\r\nthey may overwhelm those who fall in their way, and if any hostile force\r\nencounters them, they may be saved easily by retiring to us. And after\r\nwe have captured the fortress, if God wills, then with the whole army\r\nlet us cross the River Tigris, without having to fear mischief from\r\nanyone in our rear, and knowing well how matters stand with the\r\nAssyrians.\"\r\n\r\nThese words of Belisarius seemed to all well spoken, and he straightway\r\nput the plan into execution. Accordingly he commanded Arethas with his\r\ntroops to advance into Assyria, and with them he sent twelve hundred\r\nsoldiers, the most of whom were from among his own guard, putting two\r\nguardsmen in command of them, Trajan and John who was called the\r\nGlutton, both capable warriors. These men he directed to obey Arethas in\r\neverything they did, and he commanded Arethas to pillage all that lay\r\nbefore him and then return to the camp and report how matters stood with\r\nthe Assyrians with regard to military strength. So Arethas and his men\r\ncrossed the River Tigris and entered Assyria. There they found a goodly\r\nland and one which had been free from plunder for a long time, and\r\nundefended besides; and moving rapidly they pillaged many of the places\r\nthere and secured a great amount of rich plunder. And at that time\r\nBelisarius captured some of the Persians and learned from them that\r\nthose who were inside the fortress were altogether out of provisions.\r\nFor they do not observe the custom which is followed in the cities of\r\nDaras and Nisibis, where they put away the annual food-supply in public\r\nstore-houses, and now that a hostile army had fallen upon them\r\nunexpectedly they had not anticipated the event by carrying in any of\r\nthe necessities of life. And since a great number of persons had taken\r\nrefuge suddenly in the fortress, they were naturally hard pressed by the\r\nwant of provisions. When Belisarius learned this, he sent George, a man\r\nof the greatest discretion with whom he shared his secrets, to test the\r\nmen of the place, in the hope that he might be able to arrange some\r\nterms of surrender and thus take the place. And George succeeded, after\r\naddressing to them many words of exhortation and of kindly invitation,\r\nin persuading them to take pledges for their safety and to deliver\r\nthemselves and the fortress to the Romans. Thus Belisarius captured\r\nSisauranon, and the inhabitants, all of whom were Christians and of\r\nRoman origin, he released unscathed, but the Persians he sent with\r\nBleschames to Byzantium, and razed the fortification wall of the\r\nfortress to the ground. And the emperor not long afterwards sent these\r\nPersians and Bleschames to Italy to fight against the Goths. Such, then,\r\nwas the course of events which had to do with the fortress of\r\nSisauranon.\r\n\r\nBut Arethas, fearing lest he should be despoiled of his booty by the\r\nRomans, was now unwilling to return to the camp. So he sent some of his\r\nfollowers ostensibly for the purpose of reconnoitring, but secretly\r\ncommanding them to return as quickly as possible and announce to the\r\narmy that a large hostile force was at the crossing of the river. For\r\nthis reason, then, he advised Trajan and John to return by another route\r\nto the land of the Romans. So they did not come again to Belisarius, but\r\nkeeping the River Euphrates on the right they finally arrived at the\r\nTheodosiopolis which is near the River Aborrhas. But Belisarius and the\r\nRoman army, hearing nothing concerning this force, were disturbed, and\r\nthey were filled with fear and an intolerable and exaggerated suspicion.\r\nAnd since much time had been consumed by them in this siege, it came\r\nabout that many of the soldiers were taken there with a troublesome\r\nfever; for the portion of Mesopotamia which is subject to the Persians\r\nis extremely dry and hot. And the Romans were not accustomed to this and\r\nespecially those who came from Thrace; and since they were living their\r\ndaily life in a place where the heat was excessive and in stuffy huts in\r\nthe summer season, they became so ill that the third part of the army\r\nwere lying half-dead. The whole army, therefore, was eager to depart\r\nfrom there and return as quickly as possible to their own land, and most\r\nof all the commanders of the troops in Lebanon, Rhecithancus and\r\nTheoctistus, who saw that the time which was the sacred season of the\r\nSaracens had in fact already passed. They came, indeed, frequently to\r\nBelisarius and entreated him to release them immediately, protesting\r\nthat they had given over to Alamoundaras the country of Lebanon and\r\nSyria, and were sitting there for no good reason.\r\n\r\nBelisarius therefore called together all the officers and opened a\r\ndiscussion. Then John, the son of Nicetas, rose first and spoke as\r\nfollows: \"Most excellent Belisarius, I consider that in all time there\r\nhas never been a general such as you are either in fortune or in valour.\r\nAnd this reputation has come to prevail not alone among the Romans, but\r\nalso among all barbarians. This fair name, however, you will preserve\r\nmost securely, if you should be able to take us back alive to the land\r\nof the Romans; for now indeed the hopes which we may have are not\r\nbright. For I would have you look thus at the situation of this army.\r\nThe Saracens and the most efficient soldiers of the army crossed the\r\nRiver Tigris, and one day, I know not how long since, they found\r\nthemselves in such a plight that they have not even succeeded in sending\r\na messenger to us, and Rhecithancus and Theoctistus will depart, as you\r\nsee surely, believing that the army of Alamoundaras is almost at this\r\nvery moment in the midst of Phoenicia, pillaging the whole country\r\nthere. And among those who are left the sick are so numerous that those\r\nwho will care for them and convey them to the land of the Romans are\r\nfewer in number than they are by a great deal. Under these\r\ncircumstances, if it should fall out that any hostile force should come\r\nupon us, either while remaining here or while going back, not a man\r\nwould be able to carry back word to the Romans in Daras of the calamity\r\nwhich had befallen us. For as for going forward, I consider it\r\nimpossible even to be spoken of. While, therefore, some hope is still\r\nleft, it will be of advantage both to make plans for the return and to\r\nput the plans into action. For when men have come into danger and\r\nespecially such danger as this, it is downright folly for them to devote\r\ntheir thoughts not to safety, but to opposition to the enemy.\" So spoke\r\nJohn, and all the others expressed approval, and becoming disorderly,\r\nthey demanded that the retreat be made with all speed. Accordingly\r\nBelisarius laid the sick in the carts and let them lead the way, while\r\nhe led the army behind them. And as soon as they got into the land of\r\nthe Romans, he learned everything which had been done by Arethas, but he\r\ndid not succeed in inflicting any punishment upon him, for he never came\r\ninto his sight again. So ended the invasion of the Romans.\r\n\r\nAnd after Chosroes had taken Petra, it was announced to him that\r\nBelisarius had invaded the Persian territory, and the engagement near\r\nthe city of Nisibis was reported, as also the capture of the fortress of\r\nSisauranon, and all that the army of Arethas had done after crossing the\r\nRiver Tigris. Straightway, then, he established a garrison in Petra, and\r\nwith the rest of the army and those of the Romans who had been captured\r\nhe marched away into the land of Persia. Such, then, were the events\r\nwhich took place in the second invasion of Chosroes. And Belisarius went\r\nto Byzantium at the summons of the emperor, and passed the winter there.\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\n[542 A.D.] At the opening of spring Chosroes, the son of Cabades, for\r\nthe third time began an invasion into the land of the Romans with a\r\nmighty army, keeping the River Euphrates on the right. And Candidus, the\r\npriest of Sergiopolis, upon learning that the Median army had come near\r\nthere, began to be afraid both for himself and for the city, since he\r\nhad by no means carried out at the appointed time the agreement which he\r\nhad made[15]; accordingly he went into the camp of the enemy and\r\nentreated Chosroes not to be angry with him because of this. For as for\r\nmoney, he had never had any, and for this reason he had not even wished\r\nin the first place to deliver the inhabitants of Sura, and though he had\r\nsupplicated the Emperor Justinian many times on their behalf, he had\r\nfailed to receive any help from him. But Chosroes put him under guard,\r\nand, torturing him most cruelly, claimed the right to exact from him\r\ndouble the amount of money, just as had been agreed. And Candidus\r\nentreated him to send men to Sergiopolis to take all the treasures of\r\nthe sanctuary there. And when Chosroes followed this suggestion,\r\nCandidus sent some of his followers with them. So the inhabitants of\r\nSergiopolis, receiving into the city the men sent by Chosroes, gave them\r\nmany of the treasures, declaring that nothing else was left them. But\r\nChosroes said that these were by no means sufficient for him, and\r\ndemanded that he should receive others still more than these.\r\nAccordingly he sent men, ostensibly to search out with all diligence the\r\nwealth of the city, but in reality to take possession of the city. But\r\nsince it was fated that Sergiopolis should not be taken by the Persians,\r\none of the Saracens, who, though a Christian, was serving under\r\nAlamoundaras, Ambrus by name, came by night along the wall of the city,\r\nand reporting to them the whole plan, bade them by no means receive the\r\nPersians into the city. Thus those who were sent by Chosroes returned to\r\nhim unsuccessful, and he, boiling with anger, began to make plans to\r\ncapture the city. He accordingly sent an army of six thousand,\r\ncommanding them to begin a siege and to make assaults upon the\r\nfortifications. And this army came there and commenced active\r\noperations, and the citizens of Sergiopolis at first defended themselves\r\nvigorously, but later they gave up, and in terror at the danger, they\r\nwere purposing to give over the city to the enemy. For, as it happened,\r\nthey had not more than two hundred soldiers. But Ambrus, again coming\r\nalong by the fortifications at night, said that within two days the\r\nPersians would raise the siege since their water supply had failed them\r\nabsolutely. For this reason they did not by any means open negotiations\r\nwith the enemy, and the barbarians, suffering with thirst, removed from\r\nthere and came to Chosroes. However, Chosroes never released Candidus.\r\nFor it was necessary, I suppose, that since he had disregarded his sworn\r\nagreement, he should be a priest no longer. Such, then, was the course\r\nof these events.\r\n\r\nBut when Chosroes arrived at the land of the Commagenae which they call\r\nEuphratesia, he had no desire to turn to plundering or to the capture of\r\nany stronghold, since he had previously taken everything before him as\r\nfar as Syria, partly by capture and partly by exacting money, as has\r\nbeen set forth in the preceding narrative. And his purpose was to lead\r\nthe army straight for Palestine, in order that he might plunder all\r\ntheir treasures and especially those in Jerusalem. For he had it from\r\nhearsay that this was an especially goodly land and peopled by wealthy\r\ninhabitants. And all the Romans, both officers and soldiers, were far\r\nfrom entertaining any thought of confronting the enemy or of standing in\r\nthe way of their passage, but manning their strongholds as each one\r\ncould, they thought it sufficient to preserve them and save themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Justinian, upon learning of the inroad of the Persians,\r\nagain sent Belisarius against them. And he came with great speed to\r\nEuphratesia since he had no army with him, riding on the government\r\npost-horses, which they are accustomed to call \"veredi,\" while Justus,\r\nthe nephew of the emperor, together with Bouzes and certain others, was\r\nin Hierapolis where he had fled for refuge. And when these men heard\r\nthat Belisarius was coming and was not far away, they wrote a letter to\r\nhim which ran as follows: \"Once more Chosroes, as you yourself doubtless\r\nknow, has taken the field against the Romans, bringing a much greater\r\narmy than formerly; and where he is purposing to go is not yet evident,\r\nexcept indeed that we hear he is very near, and that he has injured no\r\nplace, but is always moving ahead. But come to us as quickly as\r\npossible, if indeed you are able to escape detection by the army of the\r\nenemy, in order that you yourself may be safe for the emperor, and that\r\nyou may join us in guarding Hierapolis.\" Such was the message of the\r\nletter. But Belisarius, not approving the advice given, came to the\r\nplace called Europum, which is on the River Euphrates. From there he\r\nsent about in all directions and began to gather his army, and there he\r\nestablished his camp; and the officers in Hierapolis he answered with\r\nthe following words: \"If, now, Chosroes is proceeding against any other\r\npeoples, and not against subjects of the Romans, this plan of yours is\r\nwell considered and insures the greatest possible degree of safety; for\r\nit is great folly for those who have the opportunity of remaining quiet\r\nand being rid of trouble to enter into any unnecessary danger; but if,\r\nimmediately after departing from here, this barbarian is going to fall\r\nupon some other territory of the Emperor Justinian, and that an\r\nexceptionally good one, but without any guard of soldiers, be assured\r\nthat to perish valorously is better in every way than to be saved\r\nwithout a fight. For this would justly be called not salvation but\r\ntreason. But come as quickly as possible to Europum, where, after\r\ncollecting the whole army, I hope to deal with the enemy as God\r\npermits.\" And when the officers saw this message, they took courage, and\r\nleaving there Justus with some few men in order to guard Hierapolis, all\r\nthe others with the rest of the army came to Europum.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nBut Chosroes, upon learning that Belisarius with the whole Roman army\r\nhad encamped at Europum, decided not to continue his advance, but sent\r\none of the royal secretaries, Abandanes by name, a man who enjoyed a\r\ngreat reputation for discretion, to Belisarius, in order to find out by\r\ninspection what sort of a general he might be, but ostensibly to make a\r\nprotest because the Emperor Justinian had not sent the ambassadors to\r\nthe Persians at all in order that they might settle the arrangements for\r\nthe peace as had been agreed. When Belisarius learned this, he did as\r\nfollows. He himself picked out six thousand men of goodly stature and\r\nespecially fine physique, and set out to hunt at a considerable distance\r\nfrom the camp. Then he commanded Diogenes, the guardsman, and Adolius,\r\nthe son of Acacius, to cross the river with a thousand horsemen and to\r\nmove about the bank there, always making it appear to the enemy that if\r\nthey wished to cross the Euphrates and proceed to their own land, they\r\nwould never permit them to do so. This Adolius was an Armenian by birth,\r\nand he always served the emperor while in the palace as privy counsellor\r\n(those who enjoy this honour are called by the Romans \"silentiarii\"),\r\nbut at that time he was commander of some Armenians. And these men did\r\nas directed.\r\n\r\nNow when Belisarius had ascertained that the envoy was close at hand, he\r\nset up a tent of some heavy cloth, of the sort which is commonly called\r\na \"pavilion,\" and seated himself there as one might in a desolate place,\r\nseeking thus to indicate that he had come without any equipment. And he\r\narranged the soldiers as follows. On either side of the tent were\r\nThracians and Illyrians, with Goths beyond them, and next to these\r\nEruli, and finally Vandals and Moors. And their line extended for a\r\ngreat distance over the plain. For they did not remain standing always\r\nin the same place, but stood apart from one another and kept walking\r\nabout, looking carelessly and without the least interest upon the envoy\r\nof Chosroes. And not one of them had a cloak or any other outer garment\r\nto cover the shoulders, but they were sauntering about clad in linen\r\ntunics and trousers, and outside these their girdles. And each one had\r\nhis horse-whip, but for weapons one had a sword, another an axe, another\r\nan uncovered bow. And all gave the impression that they were eager to be\r\noff on the hunt with never a thought of anything else. So Abandanes came\r\ninto the presence of Belisarius and said that the king Chosroes was\r\nindignant because the agreement previously made had not been kept, in\r\nthat the envoys had not been sent to him by Caesar (for thus the\r\nPersians call the emperor of the Romans), and as a result of this\r\nChosroes had been compelled to come into the land of the Romans in arms.\r\nBut Belisarius was not terrified by the thought that such a multitude of\r\nbarbarians were encamped close by, nor did he experience any confusion\r\nbecause of the words of the man, but with a laughing, care-free\r\ncountenance he made answer, saying: \"This course which Chosroes has\r\nfollowed on the present occasion is not in keeping with the way men\r\nusually act. For other men, in case a dispute should arise between\r\nthemselves and any of their neighbours, first carry on negotiations with\r\nthem, and whenever they do not receive reasonable satisfaction, then\r\nfinally go against them in war. But he first comes into the midst of the\r\nRomans, and then begins to offer suggestions concerning peace.\" With\r\nsuch words as these he dismissed the ambassador.\r\n\r\nAnd when Abandanes came to Chosroes, he advised him to take his\r\ndeparture with all possible speed. For he said he had met a general who\r\nin manliness and sagacity surpassed all other men, and soldiers such as\r\nhe at least had never seen, whose orderly conduct had roused in him the\r\ngreatest admiration. And he added that the contest was not on an even\r\nfooting as regards risk for him and for Belisarius, for there was this\r\ndifference, that if he conquered, he himself would conquer the slave of\r\nCaesar, but if he by any chance were defeated, he would bring great\r\ndisgrace upon his kingdom and upon the race of the Persians; and again\r\nthe Romans, if conquered, could easily save themselves in strongholds\r\nand in their own land, while if the Persians should meet with any\r\nreverse, not even a messenger would escape to the land of the Persians.\r\nChosroes was convinced by this admonition and wished to turn back to his\r\nown country, but he found himself in a very perplexing situation. For he\r\nsupposed that the crossing of the river was being guarded by the enemy,\r\nand he was unable to march back by the same road, which was entirely\r\ndestitute of human habitation, since the supplies which they had at the\r\nfirst when they invaded the land of the Romans had already entirely\r\nfailed them. At last after long consideration it seemed to him most\r\nadvantageous to risk a battle and get to the opposite side, and to make\r\nthe journey through a land abounding in all good things. Now Belisarius\r\nknew well that not even a hundred thousand men would ever be sufficient\r\nto check the crossing of Chosroes. For the river at many places along\r\nthere can be crossed in boats very easily, and even apart from this the\r\nPersian army was too strong to be excluded from the crossing by an enemy\r\nnumerically insignificant. But he had at first commanded the troops of\r\nDiogenes and Adolius, together with the thousand horsemen, to move about\r\nthe bank at that point in order to confuse the barbarian by a feeling of\r\nhelplessness. But after frightening this same barbarian, as I have said,\r\nBelisarius feared lest there should be some obstacle in the way of his\r\ndeparting from the land of the Romans. For it seemed to him a most\r\nsignificant achievement to have driven away from there the army of\r\nChosroes, without risking any battle against so many myriads of\r\nbarbarians with soldiers who were very few in number and who were in\r\nabject terror of the Median army. For this reason he commanded Diogenes\r\nand Adolius to remain quiet.\r\n\r\nChosroes, accordingly, constructed a bridge with great celerity and\r\ncrossed the River Euphrates suddenly with his whole army. For the\r\nPersians are able to cross all rivers without the slightest difficulty\r\nbecause when they are on the march they have in readiness hook-shaped\r\nirons with which they fasten together long timbers, and with the help of\r\nthese they improvise a bridge on the spur of the moment wherever they\r\nmay desire. And as soon as he had reached the land on the opposite side,\r\nhe sent to Belisarius and said that he, for his part, had bestowed a\r\nfavour upon the Romans in the withdrawal of the Median army, and that he\r\nwas expecting the envoys from them, who ought to present themselves to\r\nhim at no distant time. Then Belisarius also with the whole Roman army\r\ncrossed the River Euphrates and immediately sent to Chosroes. And when\r\nthe messengers came into his presence, they commended him highly for his\r\nwithdrawal and promised that envoys would come to him promptly from the\r\nemperor, who would arrange with him that the terms which had previously\r\nbeen agreed upon concerning the peace should be put into effect. And\r\nthey asked of him that he treat the Romans as his friends in his journey\r\nthrough their land. This too he agreed to carry out, if they should give\r\nhim some one of their notable men as a hostage to make this compact\r\nbinding, in order that they might carry out their agreement. So the\r\nenvoys returned to Belisarius and reported the words of Chosroes, and he\r\ncame to Edessa and chose John, the son of Basilius, the most illustrious\r\nof all the inhabitants of Edessa in birth and in wealth, and straightway\r\nsent him, much against his will, as a hostage to Chosroes. And the\r\nRomans were loud in their praises of Belisarius and he seemed to have\r\nachieved greater glory in their eyes by this affair than when he brought\r\nGelimer or Vittigis captive to Byzantium. For in reality it was an\r\nachievement of great importance and one deserving great praise, that, at\r\na time when all the Romans were panic-stricken with fear and were hiding\r\nthemselves in their defences, and Chosroes with a mighty army had come\r\ninto the midst of the Roman domain, a general with only a few men,\r\ncoming in hot haste from Byzantium just at that moment, should have set\r\nhis camp over against that of the Persian king, and that Chosroes\r\nunexpectedly, either through fear of fortune or of the valour of the man\r\nor even because deceived by some tricks, should no longer continue his\r\nadvance, but should in reality take to flight, though pretending to be\r\nseeking peace.\r\n\r\nBut in the meantime Chosroes, disregarding the agreement, took the city\r\nof Callinicus which was entirely without defenders. For the Romans,\r\nseeing that the wall of this city was altogether unsound and easy of\r\ncapture, were tearing down portions of it in turn and restoring them\r\nwith new construction. Now just at that time they had torn down one\r\nsection of it and had not yet built in this interval; when, therefore,\r\nthey learned that the enemy were close at hand, they carried out the\r\nmost precious of their treasures, and the wealthy inhabitants withdrew\r\nto other strongholds, while the rest without soldiers remained where\r\nthey were. And it happened that great numbers of farmers had gathered\r\nthere. These Chosroes enslaved and razed everything to the ground. A\r\nlittle later, upon receiving the hostage, John, he retired to his own\r\ncountry. And the Armenians who had submitted to Chosroes received\r\npledges from the Romans and came with Bassaces to Byzantium. Such was\r\nthe fortune of the Romans in the third invasion of Chosroes. And\r\nBelisarius came to Byzantium at the summons of the emperor, in order to\r\nbe sent again to Italy, since the situation there was already full of\r\ndifficulties for the Romans.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\n[542 A.D.] During these times there was a pestilence, by which the whole\r\nhuman race came near to being annihilated. Now in the case of all other\r\nscourges sent from Heaven some explanation of a cause might be given by\r\ndaring men, such as the many theories propounded by those who are clever\r\nin these matters; for they love to conjure up causes which are\r\nabsolutely incomprehensible to man, and to fabricate outlandish theories\r\nof natural philosophy, knowing well that they are saying nothing sound,\r\nbut considering it sufficient for them, if they completely deceive by\r\ntheir argument some of those whom they meet and persuade them to their\r\nview. But for this calamity it is quite impossible either to express in\r\nwords or to conceive in thought any explanation, except indeed to refer\r\nit to God. For it did not come in a part of the world nor upon certain\r\nmen, nor did it confine itself to any season of the year, so that from\r\nsuch circumstances it might be possible to find subtle explanations of a\r\ncause, but it embraced the entire world, and blighted the lives of all\r\nmen, though differing from one another in the most marked degree,\r\nrespecting neither sex nor age. For much as men differ with regard to\r\nplaces in which they live, or in the law of their daily life, or in\r\nnatural bent, or in active pursuits, or in whatever else man differs\r\nfrom man, in the case of this disease alone the difference availed\r\nnaught. And it attacked some in the summer season, others in the winter,\r\nand still others at the other times of the year. Now let each one\r\nexpress his own judgment concerning the matter, both sophist and\r\nastrologer, but as for me, I shall proceed to tell where this disease\r\noriginated and the manner in which it destroyed men.\r\n\r\nIt started from the Aegyptians who dwell in Pelusium. Then it divided\r\nand moved in one direction towards Alexandria and the rest of Aegypt,\r\nand in the other direction it came to Palestine on the borders of\r\nAegypt; and from there it spread over the whole world, always moving\r\nforward and travelling at times favourable to it. For it seemed to move\r\nby fixed arrangement, and to tarry for a specified time in each country,\r\ncasting its blight slightingly upon none, but spreading in either\r\ndirection right out to the ends of the world, as if fearing lest some\r\ncorner of the earth might escape it. For it left neither island nor cave\r\nnor mountain ridge which had human inhabitants; and if it had passed by\r\nany land, either not affecting the men there or touching them in\r\nindifferent fashion, still at a later time it came back; then those who\r\ndwelt round about this land, whom formerly it had afflicted most sorely,\r\nit did not touch at all, but it did not remove from the place in\r\nquestion until it had given up its just and proper tale of dead, so as\r\nto correspond exactly to the number destroyed at the earlier time among\r\nthose who dwelt round about. And this disease always took its start from\r\nthe coast, and from there went up to the interior. And in the second\r\nyear it reached Byzantium in the middle of spring, where it happened\r\nthat I was staying at that time. And it came as follows. Apparitions of\r\nsupernatural beings in human guise of every description were seen by\r\nmany persons, and those who encountered them thought that they were\r\nstruck by the man they had met in this or that part of the body, as it\r\nhappened, and immediately upon seeing this apparition they were seized\r\nalso by the disease. Now at first those who met these creatures tried to\r\nturn them aside by uttering the holiest of names and exorcising them in\r\nother ways as well as each one could, but they accomplished absolutely\r\nnothing, for even in the sanctuaries where the most of them fled for\r\nrefuge they were dying constantly. But later on they were unwilling even\r\nto give heed to their friends when they called to them, and they shut\r\nthemselves up in their rooms and pretended that they did not hear,\r\nalthough their doors were being beaten down, fearing, obviously, that he\r\nwho was calling was one of those demons. But in the case of some the\r\npestilence did not come on in this way, but they saw a vision in a dream\r\nand seemed to suffer the very same thing at the hands of the creature\r\nwho stood over them, or else to hear a voice foretelling to them that\r\nthey were written down in the number of those who were to die. But with\r\nthe majority it came about that they were seized by the disease without\r\nbecoming aware of what was coming either through a waking vision or a\r\ndream. And they were taken in the following manner. They had a sudden\r\nfever, some when just roused from sleep, others while walking about, and\r\nothers while otherwise engaged, without any regard to what they were\r\ndoing. And the body shewed no change from its previous colour, nor was\r\nit hot as might be expected when attacked by a fever, nor indeed did any\r\ninflammation set in, but the fever was of such a languid sort from its\r\ncommencement and up till evening that neither to the sick themselves nor\r\nto a physician who touched them would it afford any suspicion of danger.\r\nIt was natural, therefore, that not one of those who had contracted the\r\ndisease expected to die from it. But on the same day in some cases, in\r\nothers on the following day, and in the rest not many days later, a\r\nbubonic swelling developed; and this took place not only in the\r\nparticular part of the body which is called \"boubon,\"[16] that is, below\r\nthe abdomen, but also inside the armpit, and in some cases also beside\r\nthe ears, and at different points on the thighs.\r\n\r\nUp to this point, then, everything went in about the same way with all\r\nwho had taken the disease. But from then on very marked differences\r\ndeveloped; and I am unable to say whether the cause of this diversity of\r\nsymptoms was to be found in the difference in bodies, or in the fact\r\nthat it followed the wish of Him who brought the disease into the world.\r\nFor there ensued with some a deep coma, with others a violent delirium,\r\nand in either case they suffered the characteristic symptoms of the\r\ndisease. For those who were under the spell of the coma forgot all those\r\nwho were familiar to them and seemed to be sleeping constantly. And if\r\nanyone cared for them, they would eat without waking, but some also were\r\nneglected, and these would die directly through lack of sustenance. But\r\nthose who were seized with delirium suffered from insomnia and were\r\nvictims of a distorted imagination; for they suspected that men were\r\ncoming upon them to destroy them, and they would become excited and rush\r\noff in flight, crying out at the top of their voices. And those who were\r\nattending them were in a state of constant exhaustion and had a most\r\ndifficult time of it throughout. For this reason everybody pitied them\r\nno less than the sufferers, not because they were threatened by the\r\npestilence in going near it (for neither physicians nor other persons\r\nwere found to contract this malady through contact with the sick or with\r\nthe dead, for many who were constantly engaged either in burying or in\r\nattending those in no way connected with them held out in the\r\nperformance of this service beyond all expectation, while with many\r\nothers the disease came on without warning and they died straightway);\r\nbut they pitied them because of the great hardships which they were\r\nundergoing. For when the patients fell from their beds and lay rolling\r\nupon the floor, they, kept patting them back in place, and when they\r\nwere struggling to rush headlong out of their houses, they would force\r\nthem back by shoving and pulling against them. And when water chanced to\r\nbe near, they wished to fall into it, not so much because of a desire\r\nfor drink (for the most of them rushed into the sea), but the cause was\r\nto be found chiefly in the diseased state of their minds. They had also\r\ngreat difficulty in the matter of eating, for they could not easily take\r\nfood. And many perished through lack of any man to care for them, for\r\nthey were either overcome by hunger, or threw themselves down from a\r\nheight. And in those cases where neither coma nor delirium came on, the\r\nbubonic swelling became mortified and the sufferer, no longer able to\r\nendure the pain, died. And one would suppose that in all cases the same\r\nthing would have been true, but since they were not at all in their\r\nsenses, some were quite unable to feel the pain; for owing to the\r\ntroubled condition of their minds they lost all sense of feeling.\r\n\r\nNow some of the physicians who were at a loss because the symptoms were\r\nnot understood, supposing that the disease centred in the bubonic\r\nswellings, decided to investigate the bodies of the dead. And upon\r\nopening some of the swellings, they found a strange sort of carbuncle\r\nthat had grown inside them.\r\n\r\nDeath came in some cases immediately, in others after many days; and\r\nwith some the body broke out with black pustules about as large as a\r\nlentil and these did not survive even one day, but all succumbed\r\nimmediately. With many also a vomiting of blood ensued without visible\r\ncause and straightway brought death. Moreover I am able to declare this,\r\nthat the most illustrious physicians predicted that many would die, who\r\nunexpectedly escaped entirely from suffering shortly afterwards, and\r\nthat they declared that many would be saved, who were destined to be\r\ncarried off almost immediately. So it was that in this disease there was\r\nno cause which came within the province of human reasoning; for in all\r\ncases the issue tended to be something unaccountable. For example, while\r\nsome were helped by bathing, others were harmed in no less degree. And\r\nof those who received no care many died, but others, contrary to reason,\r\nwere saved. And again, methods of treatment shewed different results\r\nwith different patients. Indeed the whole matter may be stated thus,\r\nthat no device was discovered by man to save himself, so that either by\r\ntaking precautions he should not suffer, or that when the malady had\r\nassailed him he should get the better of it; but suffering came without\r\nwarning and recovery was due to no external cause.\r\n\r\nAnd in the case of women who were pregnant death could be certainly\r\nforeseen if they were taken with the disease. For some died through\r\nmiscarriage, but others perished immediately at the time of birth with\r\nthe infants they bore. However, they say that three women in confinement\r\nsurvived though their children perished, and that one woman died at the\r\nvery time of child-birth but that the child was born and survived.\r\n\r\nNow in those cases where the swelling rose to an unusual size and a\r\ndischarge of pus had set in, it came about that they escaped from the\r\ndisease and survived, for clearly the acute condition of the carbuncle\r\nhad found relief in this direction, and this proved to be in general an\r\nindication of returning health; but in cases where the swelling\r\npreserved its former appearance there ensued those troubles which I have\r\njust mentioned. And with some of them it came about that the thigh was\r\nwithered, in which case, though the swelling was there, it did not\r\ndevelop the least suppuration. With others who survived the tongue did\r\nnot remain unaffected, and they lived on either lisping or speaking\r\nincoherently and with difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\nNow the disease in Byzantium ran a course of four months, and its\r\ngreatest virulence lasted about three. And at first the deaths were a\r\nlittle more than the normal, then the mortality rose still higher, and\r\nafterwards the tale of dead reached five thousand each day, and again it\r\neven came to ten thousand and still more than that. Now in the beginning\r\neach man attended to the burial of the dead of his own house, and these\r\nthey threw even into the tombs of others, either escaping detection or\r\nusing violence; but afterwards confusion and disorder everywhere became\r\ncomplete. For slaves remained destitute of masters, and men who in\r\nformer times were very prosperous were deprived of the service of their\r\ndomestics who were either sick or dead, and many houses became\r\ncompletely destitute of human inhabitants. For this reason it came about\r\nthat some of the notable men of the city because of the universal\r\ndestitution remained unburied for many days.\r\n\r\nAnd it fell to the lot of the emperor, as was natural, to make provision\r\nfor the trouble. He therefore detailed soldiers from the palace and\r\ndistributed money, commanding Theodorus to take charge of this work;\r\nthis man held the position of announcer of imperial messages, always\r\nannouncing to the emperor the petitions of his clients, and declaring to\r\nthem in turn whatever his wish was. In the Latin tongue the Romans\r\ndesignate this office by the term \"referendarius.\" So those who had not\r\nas yet fallen into complete destitution in their domestic affairs\r\nattended individually to the burial of those connected with them. But\r\nTheodorus, by giving out the emperor's money and by making further\r\nexpenditures from his own purse, kept burying the bodies which were not\r\ncared for. And when it came about that all the tombs which had existed\r\npreviously were filled with the dead, then they dug up all the places\r\nabout the city one after the other, laid the dead there, each one as he\r\ncould, and departed; but later on those who were making these trenches,\r\nno longer able to keep up with the number of the dying, mounted the\r\ntowers of the fortifications in Sycae[17], and tearing off the roofs\r\nthrew the bodies in there in complete disorder; and they piled them up\r\njust as each one happened to fall, and filled practically all the towers\r\nwith corpses, and then covered them again with their roofs. As a result\r\nof this an evil stench pervaded the city and distressed the inhabitants\r\nstill more, and especially whenever the wind blew fresh from that\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\nAt that time all the customary rites of burial were overlooked. For the\r\ndead were not carried out escorted by a procession in the customary\r\nmanner, nor were the usual chants sung over them, but it was sufficient\r\nif one carried on his shoulders the body of one of the dead to the parts\r\nof the city which bordered on the sea and flung him down; and there the\r\ncorpses would be thrown upon skiffs in a heap, to be conveyed wherever\r\nit might chance. At that time, too, those of the population who had\r\nformerly been members of the factions laid aside their mutual enmity and\r\nin common they attended to the burial rites of the dead, and they\r\ncarried with their own hands the bodies of those who were no connections\r\nof theirs and buried them. Nay, more, those who in times past used to\r\ntake delight in devoting themselves to pursuits both shameful and base,\r\nshook off the unrighteousness of their daily lives and practised the\r\nduties of religion with diligence, not so much because they had learned\r\nwisdom at last nor because they had become all of a sudden lovers of\r\nvirtue, as it were--for when qualities have become fixed in men by\r\nnature or by the training of a long period of time, it is impossible for\r\nthem to lay them aside thus lightly, except, indeed, some divine\r\ninfluence for good has breathed upon them--but then all, so to speak,\r\nbeing thoroughly terrified by the things which were happening, and\r\nsupposing that they would die immediately, did, as was natural, learn\r\nrespectability for a season by sheer necessity. Therefore as soon as\r\nthey were rid of the disease and were saved, and already supposed that\r\nthey were in security, since the curse had moved on to other peoples,\r\nthen they turned sharply about and reverted once more to their baseness\r\nof heart, and now, more than before, they make a display of the\r\ninconsistency of their conduct, altogether surpassing themselves in\r\nvillainy and in lawlessness of every sort. For one could insist\r\nemphatically without falsehood that this disease, whether by chance or\r\nby some providence, chose out with exactitude the worst men and let them\r\ngo free. But these things were displayed to the world in later times.\r\n\r\nDuring that time it seemed no easy thing to see any man in the streets\r\nof Byzantium, but all who had the good fortune to be in health were\r\nsitting in their houses, either attending the sick or mourning the dead.\r\nAnd if one did succeed in meeting a man going out, he was carrying one\r\nof the dead. And work of every description ceased, and all the trades\r\nwere abandoned by the artisans, and all other work as well, such as each\r\nhad in hand. Indeed in a city which was simply abounding in all good\r\nthings starvation almost absolute was running riot. Certainly it seemed\r\na difficult and very notable thing to have a sufficiency of bread or of\r\nanything else; so that with some of the sick it appeared that the end of\r\nlife came about sooner than it should have come by reason of the lack of\r\nthe necessities of life. And, to put all in a word, it was not possible\r\nto see a single man in Byzantium clad in the chlamys[18], and especially\r\nwhen the emperor became ill (for he too had a swelling of the groin),\r\nbut in a city which held dominion over the whole Roman empire every man\r\nwas wearing clothes befitting private station and remaining quietly at\r\nhome. Such was the course of the pestilence in the Roman empire at large\r\nas well as in Byzantium. And it fell also upon the land of the Persians\r\nand visited all the other barbarians besides.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\n[545 A.D.] Now it happened that Chosroes had come from Assyria to a\r\nplace toward the north called Adarbiganon, from which he was planning to\r\nmake an invasion into the Roman domain through Persarmenia. In that\r\nplace is the great sanctuary of fire, which the Persians reverence above\r\nall other gods. There the fire is guarded unquenched by the Magi, and\r\nthey perform carefully a great number of sacred rites, and in particular\r\nthey consult an oracle on those matters which are of the greatest\r\nimportance. This is the fire which the Romans worshipped under the name\r\nof Hestia[19] in ancient times. There someone who had been sent from\r\nByzantium to Chosroes announced that Constantianus and Sergius would\r\ncome before him directly as envoys to arrange the treaty. Now these two\r\nmen were both trained speakers and exceedingly clever; Constantianus was\r\nan Illyrian by birth, and Sergius was from the city of Edessa in\r\nMesopotamia. And Chosroes remained quiet expecting these men. But in the\r\ncourse of the journey thither Constantianus became ill and much time was\r\nconsumed; in the meantime it came about that the pestilence fell upon\r\nthe Persians. For this reason Nabedes, who at that time held the office\r\nof general in Persarmenia, sent the priest of the Christians in Dubios\r\nby direction of the king to Valerianus, the general in Armenia, in order\r\nto reproach the envoys for their tardiness and to urge the Romans with\r\nall zeal toward peace. And he came with his brother to Armenia, and,\r\nmeeting Valerianus, declared that he himself, as a Christian, was\r\nfavourably disposed toward the Romans, and that the king Chosroes always\r\nfollowed his advice in every matter; so that if the ambassadors would\r\ncome with him to the land of Persia, there would be nothing to prevent\r\nthem from arranging the peace as they wished. Thus then spoke the\r\npriest; but the brother of the priest met Valerianus secretly and said\r\nthat Chosroes was in great straits: for his son had risen against him in\r\nan attempt to set up a tyranny, and he himself together with the whole\r\nPersian army had been taken with the plague; and this was the reason why\r\nhe wished just now to settle the agreement with the Romans. When\r\nValerianus heard this, he straightway dismissed the bishop, promising\r\nthat the envoys would come to Chosroes at no distant time, but he\r\nhimself reported the words which he had heard to the Emperor Justinian.\r\nThis led the emperor immediately to send word to him and to Martinus and\r\nthe other commanders to invade the enemy's territory as quickly as\r\npossible. For he knew well that no one of the enemy would stand in their\r\nway. And he commanded them to gather all in one place and so make their\r\ninvasion into Persarmenia. When the commanders received these letters,\r\nall of them together with their followers began to gather into the land\r\nof Armenia.\r\n\r\nAnd already Chosroes had abandoned Adarbiganon a little before through\r\nfear of the plague and was off with his whole army into Assyria, where\r\nthe pestilence had not as yet become epidemic. Valerianus accordingly\r\nencamped close by Theodosiopolis with the troops under him; and with him\r\nwas arrayed Narses, who had with him Armenians and some of the Eruli.\r\nAnd Martinus, the General of the East, together with Ildiger and\r\nTheoctistus, reached the fortress of Citharizon, and fixing his camp\r\nthere, remained on the spot. This fortress is separated from\r\nTheodosiopolis by a journey of four days. There too Peter came not long\r\nafterwards together with Adolius and some other commanders. Now the\r\ntroops in this region were commanded by Isaac, the brother of Narses.\r\nAnd Philemouth and Beros with the Eruli who were under them came into\r\nthe territory of Chorzianene, not far from the camp of Martinus. And\r\nJustus, the emperor's nephew, and Peranius and John, the son of Nicetas,\r\ntogether with Domentiolus and John, who was called the Glutton, made\r\ncamp near the place called Phison, which is close by the boundaries of\r\nMartyropolis. Thus then were encamped the Roman commanders with their\r\ntroops; and the whole army amounted to thirty thousand men. Now all\r\nthese troops were neither gathered into one place, nor indeed was there\r\nany general meeting for conference. But the generals sent to each other\r\nsome of their followers and began to make enquiries concerning the\r\ninvasion. Suddenly, however, Peter, without communicating with anyone,\r\nand without any careful consideration, invaded the hostile land with his\r\ntroops. And when on the following day this was found out by Philemouth\r\nand Beros, the leaders of the Eruli, they straightway followed. And when\r\nthis in turn came to the knowledge of Martinus and Valerianus and their\r\nmen, they quickly joined in the invasion. And all of them a little later\r\nunited with each other in the enemy's territory, with the exception of\r\nJustus and his men, who, as I have said, had encamped far away from the\r\nrest of the army, and learned later of their invasion; then, indeed,\r\nthey also invaded the territory of the enemy as quickly as possible at\r\nthe point where they were, but failed altogether to unite with the other\r\ncommanders. As for the others, they proceeded in a body straight for\r\nDoubios, neither plundering nor damaging in any other way the land of\r\nthe Persians.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\nNow Doubios is a land excellent in every respect, and especially blessed\r\nwith a healthy climate and abundance of good water; and from\r\nTheodosiopolis it is removed a journey of eight days. In that region\r\nthere are plains suitable for riding, and many very populous villages\r\nare situated in very close proximity to one another, and numerous\r\nmerchants conduct their business in them. For from India and the\r\nneighbouring regions of Iberia and from practically all the nations of\r\nPersia and some of those under Roman sway they bring in merchandise and\r\ncarry on their dealings with each other there. And the priest of the\r\nChristians is called \"Catholicos\" in the Greek tongue, because he\r\npresides alone over the whole region. Now at a distance of about one\r\nhundred and twenty stades from Doubios on the right as one travels from\r\nthe land of the Romans, there is a mountain difficult of ascent and\r\nmoreover precipitous, and a village crowded into very narrow space by\r\nthe rough country about, Anglon by name. Thither Nabedes withdrew with\r\nhis whole army as soon as he learned of the inroad of the enemy, and,\r\nconfident in his strength of position, he shut himself in. Now the\r\nvillage lies at the extremity of the mountain, and there is a strong\r\nfortress bearing the same name as this village on the steep mountain\r\nside. So Nabedes with stones and carts blocked up the entrances into the\r\nvillage and thus made it still more difficult of access. And in front of\r\nit he dug a sort of trench and stationed the army there, having filled\r\nsome old cabins with ambuscades of infantrymen Altogether the Persian\r\narmy amounted to four thousand men.\r\n\r\nWhile these things were being done in this way, the Romans reached a\r\nplace one day's journey distant from Anglon, and capturing one of the\r\nenemy who was going out as a spy they enquired where in the world\r\nNabedes was then. And he asserted that the man had retired from Anglon\r\nwith the whole Median army. And when Narses heard this, he was\r\nindignant, and he heaped reproaches and abuse upon his fellow-commanders\r\nfor their hesitation. And others, too, began to do the very same thing,\r\ncasting insults upon one another; and from then on, giving up all\r\nthought of battle and danger, they were eager to plunder the country\r\nthereabout. The troops broke camp, accordingly, and without the guidance\r\nof generals and without observing any definite formation, they moved\r\nforward in complete confusion; for neither had they any countersign\r\namong themselves, as is customary in such perilous situations, nor were\r\nthey arranged in their proper divisions. For the soldiers marched\r\nforward, mixed in with the baggage train, as if going to the ready\r\nplunder of great wealth. But when they came near to Anglon, they sent\r\nout spies who returned to them announcing the array of the enemy. And\r\nthe generals were thunder-struck by the unexpectedness of it, but they\r\nconsidered it altogether disgraceful and unmanly to turn back with an\r\narmy of such great size, and so they disposed the army in its three\r\ndivisions, as well as the circumstances permitted, and advanced straight\r\ntoward the enemy. Now Peter held the right wing and Valerianus the left,\r\nwhile Martinus and his men arrayed themselves in the centre. And when\r\nthey came close to their opponents, they halted, preserving their\r\nformation, but not without disorder. The cause for this was to be found\r\nin the difficulty of the ground, which was very badly broken up, and in\r\nthe fact that they were entering battle in a formation arranged on the\r\nspur of the moment. And up to this time the barbarians, who had gathered\r\nthemselves into a small space, were remaining quiet, considering the\r\nstrength of their antagonists, since the order had been given them by\r\nNabedes not under any circumstances to begin the fighting, but if the\r\nenemy should assail them, to defend themselves with all their might.\r\n\r\nAnd first Narses with the Eruli and those of the Romans who were under\r\nhim, engaged with the enemy, and after a hard hand-to-hand struggle, he\r\nrouted the Persians who were before him. And the barbarians in flight\r\nascended on the run to the fortress, and in so doing they inflicted\r\nterrible injury upon one another in the narrow way. And then Narses\r\nurged his men forward and pressed still harder upon the enemy, and the\r\nrest of the Romans joined in the action. But all of a sudden the men who\r\nwere in ambush, as has been said[20], came out from the cabins along the\r\nnarrow alleys, and killed some of the Eruli, falling unexpectedly upon\r\nthem, and they struck Narses himself a blow on the temple. And his\r\nbrother Isaac carried him out from among the fighting men, mortally\r\nwounded. And he died shortly afterwards, having proved himself a brave\r\nman in this engagement. Then, as was to be expected, great confusion\r\nfell upon the Roman army, and Nabedes let out the whole Persian force\r\nupon his opponents. And the Persians, shooting into great masses of the\r\nenemy in the narrow alleys, killed a large number without difficulty,\r\nand particularly of the Eruli who had at the first fallen upon the enemy\r\nwith Narses and were fighting for the most part without protection. For\r\nthe Eruli have neither helmet nor corselet nor any other protective\r\narmour, except a shield and a thick jacket, which they gird about them\r\nbefore they enter a struggle. And indeed the Erulian slaves go into\r\nbattle without even a shield, and when they prove themselves brave men\r\nin war, then their masters permit them to protect themselves in battle\r\nwith shields. Such is the custom of the Eruli.\r\n\r\nAnd the Romans did not withstand the enemy and all of them fled as fast\r\nas they could, never once thinking of resistance and heedless of shame\r\nor of any other worthy motive. But the Persians, suspecting that they\r\nhad not turned thus to a shameless flight, but that they were making use\r\nof some ambuscades against them, pursued them as far as the rough ground\r\nextended and then turned back, not daring to fight a decisive battle on\r\nlevel ground, a few against many. The Romans, however, and especially\r\nall the generals, supposing that the enemy were continuing the pursuit\r\nwithout pause, kept fleeing still faster, wasting not a moment; and they\r\nwere urging on their horses as they ran with whip and voice, and\r\nthrowing their corselets and other accoutrements in haste and confusion\r\nto the ground. For they had not the courage to array themselves against\r\nthe Persians if they overtook them, but they placed all hope of safety\r\nin their horses' feet, and, in short, the flight became such that\r\nscarcely any one of their horses survived, but when they stopped\r\nrunning, they straightway fell down and expired. And this proved a\r\ndisaster for the Romans so great as to exceed anything that had ever\r\nbefallen them previously. For great numbers of them perished and still\r\nmore fell into the hands of the enemy. And their weapons and draught\r\nanimals which were taken by the enemy amounted to such an imposing\r\nnumber that Persia seemed as a result of this affair to have become\r\nricher. And Adolius, while passing through a fortified place during this\r\nretreat--it was situated in Persarmenia--was struck on the head by a\r\nstone thrown by one of the inhabitants of the town, and died there. As\r\nfor the forces of Justus and Peranius, they invaded the country about\r\nTaraunon, and after gathering some little plunder, immediately returned.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI\r\n\r\n[544 A.D.] And in the following year, Chosroes, the son of Cabades, for\r\nthe fourth time invaded the land of the Romans, leading his army towards\r\nMesopotamia. Now this invasion was made by this Chosroes not against\r\nJustinian, the Emperor of the Romans, nor indeed against any other man,\r\nbut only against the God whom the Christians reverence. For when in the\r\nfirst invasion he retired, after failing to capture Edessa[21], both he\r\nand the Magi, since they had been worsted by the God of the Christians,\r\nfell into a great dejection. Wherefore Chosroes, seeking to allay it,\r\nuttered a threat in the palace that he would make slaves of all the\r\ninhabitants of Edessa and bring them to the land of Persia, and would\r\nturn the city into a pasture for sheep. Accordingly when he had\r\napproached the city of Edessa with his whole army, he sent some of the\r\nHuns who were following him against that portion of the fortifications\r\nof the city which is above the hippodrome, with the purpose of doing no\r\nfurther injury than seizing the flocks which the shepherds had stationed\r\nthere along the wall in great numbers: for they were confident in the\r\nstrength of the place, since it was exceedingly steep, and supposed that\r\nthe enemy would never dare to come so very close to the wall. So the\r\nbarbarians were already laying hold of the sheep, and the shepherds were\r\ntrying most valiantly to prevent them. And when a great number of\r\nPersians had come to the assistance of the Huns, the barbarians\r\nsucceeded in detaching something of a flock from there, but Roman\r\nsoldiers and some of the populace made a sally upon the enemy and the\r\nbattle became a hand-to-hand struggle; meanwhile the flock of its own\r\naccord returned again to the shepherds. Now one of the Huns who was\r\nfighting before the others was making more trouble for the Romans than\r\nall the rest. And some rustic made a good shot and hit him on the right\r\nknee with a sling, and he immediately fell headlong from his horse to\r\nthe ground, which thing heartened the Romans still more. And the battle\r\nwhich had begun early in the morning ended at midday, and both sides\r\nwithdrew from the engagement thinking that they had the advantage. So\r\nthe Romans went inside the fortifications, while the barbarians pitched\r\ntheir tents and made camp in a body about seven stades from the city.\r\n\r\nThen Chosroes either saw some vision or else the thought occurred to him\r\nthat if, after making two attempts, he should not be able to capture\r\nEdessa, he would thereby cover himself with much disgrace. Accordingly\r\nhe decided to sell his withdrawal to the citizens of Edessa for a great\r\nsum of money. On the following day, therefore, Paulus the interpreter\r\ncame along by the wall and said that some of the Roman notables should\r\nbe sent to Chosroes. And they with all speed chose out four of their\r\nillustrious men and sent them. When these men reached the Median camp,\r\nthey were met according to the king's order by Zaberganes, who first\r\nterrified them with many threats and then enquired of them which course\r\nwas the more desirable for them, whether that leading to peace, or that\r\nleading to war. And when the envoys agreed that they would choose peace\r\nrather than the dangers of war, Zaberganes replied: \"Therefore it is\r\nnecessary for you to purchase this for a great sum of money.\" And the\r\nenvoys said that they would give as much as they had provided before,\r\nwhen he came against them after capturing Antioch. And Zaberganes\r\ndismissed them with laughter, telling them to deliberate most carefully\r\nconcerning their safety and then to come again to the Persians. And a\r\nlittle later Chosroes summoned them, and when they came before him, he\r\nrecounted how many Roman towns he had previously enslaved and in what\r\nmanner he had accomplished it; then he threatened that the inhabitants\r\nof Edessa would receive more direful treatment at the hands of the\r\nPersians, unless they should give them all the wealth which they had\r\ninside the fortifications; for only on this condition, he said, would\r\nthe army depart. When the envoys heard this, they agreed that they would\r\npurchase peace from Chosroes, if only he would not prescribe impossible\r\nconditions for them: but the outcome of a conflict, they said, was\r\nplainly seen by no one at all before the struggle. For there was never a\r\nwar whose outcome might be taken for granted by those who waged it.\r\nThereupon Chosroes in anger commanded the envoys to be gone with all\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nOn the eighth day of the siege he formed the design of erecting an\r\nartificial hill against the circuit wall of the city; accordingly he cut\r\ndown trees in great numbers from the adjacent districts and, without\r\nremoving the leaves, laid them together in a square before the wall, at\r\na point which no missile from the city could reach; then he heaped an\r\nimmense amount of earth right upon the trees and above that threw on a\r\ngreat quantity of stones, not such as are suitable for building, but cut\r\nat random, and only calculated to raise the hill as quickly as possible\r\nto a great height. And he kept laying on long timbers in the midst of\r\nthe earth and the stones, and made them serve to bind the structure\r\ntogether, in order that as it became high it should not be weak. But\r\nPeter, the Roman general (for he happened to be there with Martinus and\r\nPeranius), wishing to check the men who were engaged in this work, sent\r\nsome of the Huns who were under his command against them. And they, by\r\nmaking a sudden attack, killed a great number; and one of the guardsmen,\r\nArgek by name, surpassed all others, for he alone killed twenty-seven.\r\nFrom that time on, however, the barbarians kept a careful guard, and\r\nthere was no further opportunity for anyone to go out against them. But\r\nwhen the artisans engaged in this work, as they moved forward, came\r\nwithin range of missiles, then the Romans offered a most vigorous\r\nresistance from the city wall, using both their slings and their bows\r\nagainst them. Wherefore the barbarians devised the following plan. They\r\nprovided screens of goat's hair cloth, of the kind which are called\r\nCilician, making them of adequate thickness and height, and attached\r\nthem to long pieces of wood which they always set before those who were\r\nworking on the \"agesta\"[22] (for thus the Romans used to call in the\r\nLatin tongue the thing which they were making). Behind this neither\r\nignited arrows nor any other weapon could reach the workmen, but all of\r\nthem were thrown back by the screens and stopped there. And then the\r\nRomans, falling into a great fear, sent the envoys to Chosroes in great\r\ntrepidation, and with them Stephanus, a physician of marked learning\r\namong those of his time at any rate, who also had once cured Cabades,\r\nthe son of Perozes, when ill, and had been made master of great wealth\r\nby him. He, therefore, coming into the presence of Chosroes with the\r\nothers, spoke as follows: \"It has been agreed by all from of old that\r\nkindness is the mark of a good king. Therefore, most mighty King, while\r\nbusying thyself with murders and battles and the enslavement of cities\r\nit will perhaps be possible for thee to win the other names, but thou\r\nwilt never by any means have the reputation of being 'good.' And yet\r\nleast of all cities should Edessa suffer any adversity at thy hand. For\r\nthere was I born, who, without any foreknowledge of what was coming to\r\npass, fostered thee from childhood and counselled thy father to appoint\r\nthee his successor in the kingdom, so that to thee I have proved the\r\nchief cause of the kingship of Persia, but to my fatherland of her\r\npresent woes. For men, as a general thing, bring down upon their own\r\nheads the most of the misfortunes which are going to befall them. But if\r\nany remembrance of such benefaction comes to thy mind, do us no further\r\ninjury, and grant me this requital, by which, O King, thou wilt escape\r\nthe reputation of being most cruel.\" Such were the words of Stephanus.\r\nBut Chosroes declared that he would not depart from there until the\r\nRomans should deliver to him Peter and Peranius, seeing that, being his\r\nhereditary slaves, they had dared to array themselves against him. And\r\nif it was not their pleasure to do this, the Romans must choose one of\r\ntwo alternatives, either to give the Persians five hundred centenaria of\r\ngold, or to receive into the city some of his associates who would\r\nsearch out all the money, both gold and silver, as much as was there,\r\nand bring it to him, allowing everything else to remain in the\r\npossession of the present owners. Such then were the words which\r\nChosroes hurled forth, being in hopes of capturing Edessa with no\r\ntrouble. And the ambassadors (since all the conditions which he had\r\nannounced to them seemed impossible), in despair and great vexation,\r\nproceeded to the city. And when they had come inside the city-wall, they\r\nreported the message from Chosroes, and the whole city was filled with\r\ntumult and lamentation.\r\n\r\nNow the artificial hill was rising to a great height and was being\r\npushed forward with much haste. And the Romans, being at a loss what to\r\ndo, again sent off the envoys to Chosroes. And when they had arrived in\r\nthe enemy's camp, and said that they had come to make entreaty\r\nconcerning the same things, they did not even gain a hearing of any kind\r\nfrom the Persians, but they were insulted and driven out from there with\r\na great tumult, and so returned to the city. At first, then, the Romans\r\ntried to over-top the wall opposite the hill by means of another\r\nstructure. But since the Persian work was already rising far above even\r\nthis, they stopped their building and persuaded Martinus to make the\r\narrangements for a settlement in whatever way he wished. He then came up\r\nclose to the enemy's camp and began to converse with some of the Persian\r\ncommanders. But they, completely deceiving Martinus, said that their\r\nking was desirous of peace, but that he was utterly unable to persuade\r\nthe Roman Emperor to have done with his strife with Chosroes and to\r\nestablish peace with him at last. And they mentioned as evidence of this\r\nthe fact that Belisarius, who in power and dignity was far superior to\r\nMartinus, as even he himself would not deny, had recently persuaded the\r\nking of the Persians, when he was in the midst of Roman territory, to\r\nwithdraw from there into Persia, promising that envoys from Byzantium\r\nwould come to him at no distant time and establish peace securely, but\r\nthat he had done none of the things agreed upon, since he had found\r\nhimself unable to overcome the determination of the Emperor Justinian.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Romans were busying themselves as follows: They made\r\na tunnel from the city underneath the enemy's embankment, commanding the\r\ndiggers not to leave this work until they should get under the middle of\r\nthe hill. By this means they were planning to burn the embankment. But\r\nas the tunnel advanced to about the middle of the hill, a sound of\r\nblows, as it were, came to the ears of those Persians who were standing\r\nabove. And perceiving what was being done, they too began from above and\r\ndug on both sides of the middle, so that they might catch the Romans who\r\nwere doing the damage there. But the Romans found it out and abandoned\r\nthis attempt, throwing earth into the place which had been hollowed out,\r\nand then began to work on the lower part of the embankment at the end\r\nwhich was next to the wall, and by taking out timbers and stones and\r\nearth they made an open space just like a chamber; then they threw in\r\nthere dry trunks of trees of the kind which burn most easily, and\r\nsaturated them with oil of cedar and added quantities of sulphur and\r\nbitumen. So, then, they were keeping these things in readiness; and\r\nmeanwhile the Persian commanders in frequent meetings with Martinus were\r\ncarrying on conversations with him in the same strain as the one I have\r\nmentioned, making it appear that they would receive proposals in regard\r\nto peace. But when at last their hill had been completed, and had been\r\nraised to a great elevation, approaching the circuit-wall of the city\r\nand rising far above it in height, then they sent Martinus away,\r\ndefinitely refusing to arrange the treaty, and they intended from then\r\non to devote themselves to active warfare.\r\n\r\nAccordingly the Romans straightway set fire to the tree-trunks which had\r\nbeen prepared for this purpose. But when the fire had burned only a\r\ncertain portion of the embankment, and had not yet been able to\r\npenetrate through the whole mass, the wood was already entirely\r\nexhausted. But they kept throwing fresh wood into the pit, not\r\nslackening their efforts for a moment. And when the fire was already\r\nactive throughout the whole embankment, some smoke appeared at night\r\nrising from every part of the hill, and the Romans, who were not yet\r\nwilling to let the Persians know what was being done, resorted to the\r\nfollowing device: They filled small pots with coals and fire and threw\r\nthese and also ignited arrows in great numbers to all parts of the\r\nembankment. And the Persians who were keeping guard there, began to go\r\nabout in great haste and extinguish these, and they supposed that the\r\nsmoke arose from them. But since the trouble increased, the barbarians\r\nrushed up to help in great numbers, and the Romans, shooting them from\r\nthe wall, killed many. And Chosroes too came there about sunrise,\r\nfollowed by the greater part of the army, and, upon mounting the hill,\r\nhe first perceived what the trouble was. For he disclosed the fact that\r\nthe cause of the smoke was underneath, not in the missiles which the\r\nenemy were hurling, and he ordered the whole army to come to the rescue\r\nwith all speed. And the Romans, taking courage, began to insult them,\r\nwhile the barbarians were at work, some throwing on earth, and others\r\nwater, where the smoke appeared, hoping thus to get the better of the\r\ntrouble; however, they were absolutely unable to accomplish anything.\r\nFor where the earth was thrown on, the smoke, as was natural, was\r\nchecked at that place, but not long afterwards it rose from another\r\nplace, since the fire compelled it to force its way out wherever it\r\ncould. And where the water fell most plentifully it only succeeded in\r\nmaking the bitumen and the sulphur much more active, and caused them to\r\nexert their full force upon the wood near by; and it constantly drove\r\nthe fire forward, since the water could not penetrate inside the\r\nembankment in a quantity at all sufficient to extinguish the flame by\r\nits abundance. And in the late afternoon the smoke became so great in\r\nvolume that it was visible to the inhabitants of Carrhae and to some\r\nothers who dwelt far beyond them. And since a great number of Persians\r\nand of Romans had gone up on top of the embankment, a fight took place\r\nand a hand-to-hand struggle to drive each other off, and the Romans were\r\nvictorious. Then even the flames rose and appeared clearly above the\r\nembankment, and the Persians abandoned this undertaking.\r\n\r\nOn the sixth day after this, at early dawn, they made an assault\r\nsecretly upon a certain part of the circuit-wall with ladders, at the\r\npoint which is called the Fort. And since the Romans who were keeping\r\nguard there were sleeping a quiet, peaceful sleep, as the night was\r\ndrawing to its close, they silently set the ladders against the wall and\r\nwere already ascending. But one of the rustics alone among the Romans\r\nhappened to be awake, and he with a shout and a great noise began to\r\nrouse them all. And a hard struggle ensued in which the Persians were\r\nworsted, and they retired to their camp, leaving the ladders where they\r\nwere; these the Romans drew up at their leisure. But Chosroes about\r\nmidday sent a large part of the army against the so-called Great Gate in\r\norder to storm the wall. And the Romans went out and confronted them,\r\nnot only soldiers, but even rustics and some of the populace, and they\r\nconquered the barbarians in battle decisively and turned them to flight.\r\nAnd while the Persians were still being pursued, Paulus, the\r\ninterpreter, came from Chosroes, and going into the midst of the Romans,\r\nhe reported that Rhecinarius had come from Byzantium to arrange the\r\npeace; and thus the two armies separated. Now it was already some days\r\nsince Rhecinarius had arrived at the camp of the barbarians. But the\r\nPersians had by no means disclosed this fact to the Romans, plainly\r\nawaiting the outcome of the attempts upon the wall which they had\r\nplanned, in order that, if they should be able to capture it, they might\r\nseem in no way to be violating the treaty, while if defeated, as\r\nactually happened, they might draw up the treaty at the invitation of\r\nthe Romans. And when Rhecinarius had gone inside the gates, the Persians\r\ndemanded that those who were to arrange the peace should come to\r\nChosroes without any delay, but the Romans said that envoys would be\r\nsent three days later; for that just at the moment their general,\r\nMartinus, was unwell.\r\n\r\nAnd Chosroes, suspecting that the reason was not a sound one, prepared\r\nfor battle. And at that time he only threw a great mass of bricks upon\r\nthe embankment; but two days later he came against the fortifications of\r\nthe city with the whole army to storm the wall. And at every gate he\r\nstationed some of the commanders and a part of the army, encircling the\r\nwhole wall in this way, and he brought up ladders and war-engines\r\nagainst it. And in the rear he placed all the Saracens with some of the\r\nPersians, not in order to assault the wall, but in order that, when the\r\ncity was captured, they might gather in the fugitives and catch them as\r\nin a drag-net. Such, then, was the purpose of Chosroes in arranging the\r\narmy in this way. And the fighting began early in the morning, and at\r\nfirst the Persians had the advantage. For they were in great numbers and\r\nfighting against a very small force, since the most of the Romans had\r\nnot heard what was going on and were utterly unprepared. But as the\r\nconflict advanced the city became full of confusion and tumult, and the\r\nwhole population, even women and little children, were going up on to\r\nthe wall. Now those who were of military age together with the soldiers\r\nwere repelling the enemy most vigorously, and many of the rustics made a\r\nremarkable shew of valorous deeds against the barbarians. Meanwhile the\r\nwomen and children, and the aged also, were gathering stones for the\r\nfighters and assisting them in other ways. Some also filled numerous\r\nbasins with olive-oil, and after heating them over fire a sufficient\r\ntime everywhere along the wall, they sprinkled the oil, while boiling\r\nfiercely, upon the enemy who were assailing the wall, using a sort of\r\nwhisk for the purpose, and in this way harassed them still more. The\r\nPersians, therefore, soon gave up and began to throw down their arms,\r\nand coming before the king, said that they were no longer able to hold\r\nout in the struggle. But Chosroes, in a passion of anger, drove them all\r\non with threats and urged them forward against the enemy. And the\r\nsoldiers with much shouting and tumult brought up the towers and the\r\nother engines of war to the wall and set the ladders against it, in\r\norder to capture the city with one grand rush. But since the Romans were\r\nhurling great numbers of missiles and exerting all their strength to\r\ndrive them off, the barbarians were turned back by force; and as\r\nChosroes withdrew, the Romans taunted him, inviting him to come and\r\nstorm the wall. Only Azarethes at the so-called Soinian Gate was still\r\nfighting with his men, at the place which they call Tripurgia[23]. And\r\nsince the Romans at this point were not a match for them, but were\r\ngiving way before their assaults, already the outer wall, which they\r\ncall an outwork, had been torn down by the barbarians in many places,\r\nand they were pressing most vigorously upon those who were defending\r\nthemselves from the great circuit-wall; but at last Peranius with a\r\nlarge number of soldiers and some of the citizens went out against them\r\nand defeated them in battle and drove them off. And the assault which\r\nhad begun early in the morning ended in the late afternoon, and both\r\nsides remained quiet that night, the Persians fearing for their defences\r\nand for themselves, and the Romans gathering stones and taking them to\r\nthe parapets and putting everything else in complete readiness, so as to\r\nfight against the enemy on the morrow when they should attack the wall.\r\nNow on the succeeding day not one of the barbarians came against the\r\nfortifications; but on the day after that a portion of the army, urged\r\non by Chosroes, made an assault upon the so-called Gate of Barlaus; but\r\nthe Romans sallied forth and confronted them, and the Persians were\r\ndecisively beaten in the engagement, and after a short time retired to\r\nthe camp. And then Paulus, the interpreter of the Persians, came along\r\nby the wall and called for Martinus, in order that he might make the\r\narrangements for the truce. Thus Martinus came to conference with the\r\ncommanders of the Persians, and they concluded an agreement, by which\r\nChosroes received five centenaria from the inhabitants of Edessa, and\r\nleft them, in writing, the promise not to inflict any further injury\r\nupon the Romans; then, after setting fire to all his defences, he\r\nreturned homeward with his whole army.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII\r\n\r\nAt about this time two generals of the Romans died, Justus, the nephew\r\nof the emperor, and Peranius, the Iberian, of whom the former succumbed\r\nto disease, while Peranius fell from his horse in hunting and suffered a\r\nfatal rupture. The emperor therefore appointed others in their places,\r\ndispatching Marcellus, his own nephew who was just arriving at the age\r\nof manhood, and Constantianus, who a little earlier had been sent as an\r\nenvoy with Sergius to Chosroes. Then the Emperor Justinian sent\r\nConstantianus and Sergius a second time to Chosroes to arrange the\r\ntruce. And they overtook him in Assyria, at the place where there are\r\ntwo towns, Seleucia and Ctesiphon, built by the Macedonians who after\r\nAlexander, the son of Philip, ruled over the Persians and the other\r\nnations there. These two towns are separated by the Tigris River only,\r\nfor they have nothing else between them. There the envoys met Chosroes,\r\nand they demanded that he should give back to the Romans the country of\r\nLazica, and establish peace with them on a thoroughly secure basis. But\r\nChosroes said that it was not easy for them to come to terms with each\r\nother, unless they should first declare an armistice, and then should\r\ncontinue to go back and forth to each other without so much fear and\r\nsettle their differences and make a peace which should be on a secure\r\nbasis for the future. And it was necessary, he said, that in return for\r\nthis continued armistice the Roman Emperor should give him money and\r\nshould also send a certain physician, Tribunus by name, in order to\r\nspend some specified time with him. For it happened that this physician\r\nat a former time had rid him of a severe disease, and as a result of\r\nthis he was especially beloved and greatly missed by him. When the\r\nEmperor Justinian heard this, he immediately sent both Tribunus and the\r\nmoney, amounting to twenty centenaria. [545 A.D.] In this way the treaty\r\nwas made between the Romans and the Persians for five years, in the\r\nnineteenth year of the reign of the Emperor Justinian.\r\n\r\nAnd a little later Arethas and Alamoundaras, the rulers of the Saracens,\r\nwaged a war against each other by themselves, unaided either by the\r\nRomans or the Persians. And Alamoundaras captured one of the sons of\r\nArethas in a sudden raid while he was pasturing horses, and straightway\r\nsacrificed him to Aphrodite; and from this it was known that Arethas was\r\nnot betraying the Romans to the Persians. Later they both came together\r\nin battle with their whole armies, and the forces of Arethas were\r\noverwhelmingly victorious, and turning their enemy to flight, they\r\nkilled many of them. And Arethas came within a little of capturing alive\r\ntwo of the sons of Alamoundaras; however, he did not actually succeed.\r\nSuch, then, was the course of events among the Saracens.\r\n\r\nBut it became clear that Chosroes, the Persian king, had made the truce\r\nwith the Romans with treacherous intent, in order that he might find\r\nthem remiss on account of the peace and inflict upon them some grave\r\ninjury. For in the third year of the truce he devised the following\r\nschemes. There were in Persia two brothers, Phabrizus and Isdigousnas,\r\nboth holding most important offices there and at the same time reckoned\r\nto be the basest of all the Persians, and having a great reputation for\r\ntheir cleverness and evil ways. Accordingly, since Chosroes had formed\r\nthe purpose of capturing the city of Daras by a sudden stroke, and to\r\nmove all the Colchians out of Lazica and establish in their place\r\nPersian settlers, he selected these two men to assist him in both\r\nundertakings. For it seemed to him that it would be a lucky stroke and a\r\nreally important achievement to win for himself the land of Colchis and\r\nto have it in secure possession, reasoning that this would be\r\nadvantageous to the Persian empire in many ways. In the first place they\r\nwould have Iberia in security forever afterwards, since the Iberians\r\nwould not have anyone with whom, if they revolted, they might find\r\nsafety; for since the most notable men of these barbarians together with\r\ntheir king, Gourgenes, had looked towards revolt, as I have stated in\r\nthe preceding pages,[24] the Persians from that time on did not permit\r\nthem to set up a king over themselves, nor were the Iberians\r\nsingle-minded subjects of the Persians, but there was much suspicion and\r\ndistrust between them. And it was evident that the Iberians were most\r\nthoroughly dissatisfied and that they would attempt a revolution shortly\r\nif they could only seize upon some favourable opportunity. Furthermore,\r\nthe Persian empire would be forever free from plunder by the Huns who\r\nlived next to Lazica, and he would send them against the Roman domains\r\nmore easily and readily, whenever he should so desire. For he considered\r\nthat, as regards the barbarians dwelling in the Caucasus, Lazica was\r\nnothing else than a bulwark against them. But most of all he hoped that\r\nthe subjugation of Lazica would afford this advantage to the Persians,\r\nthat starting from there they might overrun with no trouble both by land\r\nand by sea the countries along the Euxine Sea, as it is called, and thus\r\nwin over the Cappadocians and the Galatians and Bithynians who adjoin\r\nthem, and capture Byzantium by a sudden assault with no one opposing\r\nthem. For these reasons, then, Chosroes was anxious to gain possession\r\nof Lazica, but in the Lazi he had not the least confidence. For since\r\nthe time when the Romans had withdrawn from Lazica, the common people of\r\nthe country naturally found the Persian rule burdensome. For the\r\nPersians are beyond all other men singular in their ways, and they are\r\nexcessively rigid as regards the routine of daily life. And their laws\r\nare difficult of access for all men, and their requirements quite\r\nunbearable. But in comparison with the Lazi the difference of their\r\nthinking and living shews itself in an altogether exceptional degree,\r\nsince the Lazi are Christians of the most thorough-going kind, while all\r\nthe Persian views regarding religion are the exact opposite of theirs.\r\nAnd apart from this, salt is produced nowhere in Lazica, nor indeed does\r\ngrain grow there nor the vine nor any other good thing. But from the\r\nRomans along the coast everything is brought in to them by ship, and\r\neven so they do not pay gold to the traders, but hides and slaves and\r\nwhatever else happens to be found there in great abundance; and when\r\nthey were excluded from this trade, they were, as was to be expected, in\r\na state of constant vexation. When, therefore, Chosroes perceived this,\r\nhe was eager to anticipate with certainty any move on their part to\r\nrevolt against him. And upon considering the matter, it seemed to him to\r\nbe the most advantageous course to put Goubazes, the king of the Lazi,\r\nout of the way as quickly as possible, and to move the Lazi in a body\r\nout of the country, and then to colonize this land with Persians and\r\ncertain other nations.\r\n\r\nWhen Chosroes had matured these plans, he sent Isdigousnas to Byzantium,\r\nostensibly to act as an envoy, and he picked out five hundred of the\r\nmost valorous of the Persians and sent them with him, directing them to\r\nget inside the city of Daras, and to take their lodgings in many\r\ndifferent houses, and at night to set these all on fire, and, while all\r\nthe Romans were occupied with this fire, as was natural, to open the\r\ngates immediately, and receive the rest of the Persian army into the\r\ncity. For word had been sent previously to the commander of the city of\r\nNisibis to conceal a large force of soldiers near by and hold them in\r\nreadiness. For in this way Chosroes thought that they would destroy all\r\nthe Romans with no trouble, and seizing the city of Daras, would hold it\r\nsecurely. But someone who knew well what was being arranged, a Roman who\r\nhad come to the Persians as a deserter a little earlier, told everything\r\nto George, who was staying there at the time; now this was the same man\r\nwhom I mentioned in the preceding pages[25] as having persuaded the\r\nPersians who were besieged in the fortress of Sisauranon to surrender\r\nthemselves to the Romans. George therefore met this ambassador at the\r\nboundary line between Roman and Persian soil and said that this thing he\r\nwas doing was not after the fashion of an embassy, and that never had so\r\nnumerous a body of Persians stopped for the night in a city of the\r\nRomans. For he ought, he said, to have left behind all the rest in the\r\ntown of Ammodios, and must himself enter the city of Daras with some few\r\nmen. Now Isdigousnas was indignant and appeared to take it ill, because\r\nhe had been insulted wrongfully, in spite of the fact that he was\r\ndispatched on an embassy to the Roman emperor. But George, paying no\r\nheed to him in his fury, saved the city for the Romans. For he received\r\nIsdigousnas into the city with only twenty men.\r\n\r\nSo having failed in this attempt, the barbarian came to Byzantium as if\r\non an embassy, bringing with him his wife and two daughters (for this\r\nwas his pretext for the crowd which had been gathered about him); but\r\nwhen he came before the emperor, he was unable to say anything great or\r\nsmall about any serious matter, although he wasted no less than ten\r\nmonths in Roman territory. However, he gave the emperor the gifts from\r\nChosroes, as is customary, and a letter, in which Chosroes requested the\r\nEmperor Justinian to send word whether he was enjoying the best possible\r\nhealth. Nevertheless the Emperor Justinian received this Isdigousnas\r\nwith more friendliness and treated him with greater honour than any of\r\nthe other ambassadors of whom we know. So true was this that, whenever\r\nhe entertained him, he caused Braducius, who followed him as\r\ninterpreter, to recline with him on the couch, a thing which had never\r\nbefore happened in all time. For no one ever saw an interpreter become a\r\ntable-companion of even one of the more humble officials, not to speak\r\nof a king. But he both received and dismissed this man in a style more\r\nsplendid than that which befits an ambassador, although he had\r\nundertaken the embassy for no serious business, as I have said. For if\r\nanyone should count up the money expended and the gifts which\r\nIsdigousnas carried with him when he went away, he will find them\r\namounting to more than ten centenaria of gold. So the plot against the\r\ncity of Daras ended in this way for Chosroes.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX\r\n\r\nHis first move against Lazica was as follows. He sent into the country a\r\ngreat amount of lumber suitable for the construction of ships,\r\nexplaining to no one what his purpose was in so doing, but ostensibly he\r\nwas sending it in order to set up engines of war on the fortifications\r\nof Petra. Next he chose out three hundred able warriors of the Persians,\r\nand sent them there under command of Phabrizus, whom I have lately\r\nmentioned, ordering him to make away with Goubazes as secretly as\r\npossible; as for the rest, he himself would take care. Now when this\r\nlumber had been conveyed to Lazica, it happened that it was struck\r\nsuddenly by lightning and reduced to ashes. And Phabrizus, upon arriving\r\nin Lazica with the three hundred, began to contrive so that he might\r\ncarry out the orders received by him from Chosroes regarding Goubazes.\r\nNow it happened that one of the men of note among the Colchians,\r\nPharsanses by name, had quarrelled with Goubazes and in consequence had\r\nbecome exceedingly hostile to him, and now he did not dare at all to go\r\ninto the presence of the king. When this was learned by Phabrizus, he\r\nsummoned Pharsanses and in a conference with him disclosed the whole\r\nproject, and enquired of the man in what way he ought to go about the\r\nexecution of the deed. And it seemed best to them after deliberating\r\ntogether that Phabrizus should go into the city of Petra, and should\r\nsummon Goubazes there, in order to announce to him what the king had\r\ndecided concerning the interests of the Lazi. But Pharsanses secretly\r\nrevealed to Goubazes what was being prepared. He, accordingly, did not\r\ncome to Phabrizus at all, but began openly to plan a revolt. Then\r\nPhabrizus commanded the other Persians to attend as carefully as they\r\ncould to the guarding of Petra, and to make everything as secure as\r\npossible against a siege, and he himself with the three hundred returned\r\nhomeward without having accomplished his purpose. And Goubazes reported\r\nto the Emperor Justinian the condition in which they were, and begged\r\nhim to grant forgiveness for what the Lazi had done in the past, and to\r\ncome to their defence with all his strength, since they desired to be\r\nrid of the Median rule. For if left by themselves the Colchians would\r\nnot be able to repel the power of the Persians.\r\n\r\n[549 A.D.] When the Emperor Justinian heard this, he was overjoyed, and\r\nsent seven thousand men under the leadership of Dagisthaeus and a\r\nthousand Tzani to the assistance of the Lazi. And when this force\r\nreached the land of Colchis, they encamped together with Goubazes and\r\nthe Lazi about the fortifications of Petra and commenced a siege. But\r\nsince the Persians who were there made a most stalwart defence from the\r\nwall, it came about that much time was spent in the siege; for the\r\nPersians had put away an ample store of victuals in the town. And\r\nChosroes, being greatly disturbed by these things, dispatched a great\r\narmy of horse and foot against the besiegers, putting Mermeroes in\r\ncommand of them. And when Goubazes learned of this, he considered the\r\nmatter together with Dagisthaeus and acted in the manner which I shall\r\npresently set forth.\r\n\r\nThe river Boas rises close to the territory of the Tzani among the\r\nArmenians who dwell around Pharangium. And at first its course inclines\r\nto the right for a great distance, and its stream is small and can be\r\nforded by anyone with no trouble as far as the place where the territory\r\nof the Iberians lies on the right, and the end of the Caucasus lies\r\ndirectly opposite. In that place many nations have their homes, and\r\namong them the Alani and Abasgi, who are Christians and friends of the\r\nRomans from of old; also the Zechi, and after them the Huns who bear the\r\nname Sabeiri. But when this river reaches the point which marks the\r\ntermination of the Caucasus and of Iberia as well, there other waters\r\nalso are added to it and it becomes much larger and from there flows on\r\nbearing the name of Phasis instead of Boas[26]; and it becomes a\r\nnavigable stream as far as the so-called Euxine Sea into which it\r\nempties; and on either side of it lies Lazica. Now on the right of the\r\nstream particularly the whole country for a great distance is populated\r\nby the people of Lazica as far as the boundary of Iberia. For all the\r\nvillages of the Lazi are here beyond the river, and towns have been\r\nbuilt there from of old, among which are Archaeopolis, a very strong\r\nplace, and Sebastopolis, and the fortress of Pitius, and Scanda and\r\nSarapanis over against the boundary of Iberia. Moreover there are two\r\ncities of the greatest importance in that region, Rhodopolis and\r\nMocheresis. But on the left of the river, while the country belongs to\r\nLazica as far as one day's journey for an unencumbered traveller, the\r\nland is without human habitation. Adjoining this land is the home of the\r\nRomans who are called Pontic. Now it was in the territory of Lazica, in\r\nthe part which was altogether uninhabited, that the Emperor Justinian\r\nfounded the city of Petra in my own time. This was the place where John,\r\nsurnamed Tzibus, established the monopoly, as I have told in the\r\nprevious narrative[27], and gave cause to the Lazi to revolt. And as one\r\nleaves the city of Petra going southward, the Roman territory commences\r\nimmediately, and there are populous towns there, and one which bears the\r\nname of Rhizaeum, also Athens and certain others as far as Trapezus. Now\r\nwhen the Lazi brought in Chosroes, they crossed the River Boas and came\r\nto Petra keeping the Phasis on the right, because, as they said, they\r\nwould thus provide against being compelled to spend much time and\r\ntrouble in ferrying the men across the River Phasis, but in reality they\r\ndid not wish to display their own homes to the Persians. And yet Lazica\r\nis everywhere difficult to traverse both to the right and to the left of\r\nthe River Phasis. For there are on both sides of the river exceedingly\r\nhigh and jagged mountains, and as a result the passes are narrow and\r\nvery long. (The Romans call the roads through such passes \"clisurae\"\r\nwhen they put their own word into a Greek form.[28]) But since at that\r\ntime Lazica happened to be unguarded, the Persians had reached Petra\r\nvery easily with the Lazi who were their guides.\r\n\r\nBut on this occasion Goubazes, upon learning of the advance of the\r\nPersians, directed Dagisthaeus to send some men to guard with all their\r\nstrength the pass which is below the River Phasis, and he bade him not\r\non any account to abandon the siege until they should be able to capture\r\nPetra and the Persians in it. He himself meanwhile with the whole\r\nColchian army came to the frontier of Lazica, in order to devote all his\r\nstrength to guarding the pass there. Now it happened that long before he\r\nhad persuaded the Alani and Sabeiri to form an alliance with him, and\r\nthey had agreed for three centenaria not merely to assist the Lazi in\r\nguarding the land from plunder, but also to render Iberia so destitute\r\nof men that not even the Persians would be able to come in from there in\r\nthe future. And Goubazes had promised that the emperor would give them\r\nthis money. So he reported the agreement to the Emperor Justinian and\r\nbesought him to send this money for the barbarians and afford the Lazi\r\nsome consolation in their great distress. He also stated that the\r\ntreasury owed him his salary for ten years, for though he was assigned a\r\npost among the privy counsellors in the palace, he had received no\r\npayment from it since the time when Chosroes came into the land of\r\nColchis. And the Emperor Justinian intended to fulfil this request, but\r\nsome business came up to occupy his attention and he did not send the\r\nmoney at the proper time. So Goubazes was thus engaged.\r\n\r\nBut Dagisthaeus, being a rather young man and by no means competent to\r\ncarry on a war against Persia, did not handle the situation properly.\r\nFor while he ought to have sent certainly the greater part of the army\r\nto the pass, and perhaps should have assisted in person in this\r\nenterprise, he sent only one hundred men, just as if he were managing a\r\nmatter of secondary importance. He himself, moreover, though besieging\r\nPetra with the whole army, accomplished nothing, although the enemy were\r\nfew. For while they had been at the beginning not less than fifteen\r\nhundred, they had been shot at by Romans and Lazi in their fighting at\r\nthe wall for a long time, and had made a display of valour such as no\r\nothers known to us have made, so that many were falling constantly and\r\nthey were reduced to an exceedingly small number. So while the Persians,\r\nplunged in despair and at a loss what to do, were remaining quiet, the\r\nRomans made a trench along the wall for a short space, and the\r\ncircuit-wall at this point fell immediately. But it happened that inside\r\nthis space there was a building which did not stand back at all from the\r\ncircuit-wall, and this reached to the whole length of the fallen\r\nportion; thus, taking the place of the wall for the besieged, it\r\nrendered them secure none the less. But this was not sufficient greatly\r\nto disturb the Romans. For knowing well that by doing the same thing\r\nelsewhere they would capture the city with the greatest ease, they\r\nbecame still more hopeful than before. For this reason Dagisthaeus sent\r\nword to the emperor of what had come to pass, and proposed that prizes\r\nof victory should be in readiness for him, indicating what rewards the\r\nemperor should bestow upon himself and his brother; for he would capture\r\nPetra after no great time. So the Romans and the Tzani made a most\r\nvigorous assault upon the wall, but the Persians unexpectedly withstood\r\nthem, although only a very few were left. And since the Romans were\r\naccomplishing nothing by assaulting the wall, they again turned to\r\ndigging. And they went so far in this work that the foundations of the\r\ncircuit-wall were no longer on solid ground, but stood for the most part\r\nover empty space, and, in the nature of things, would fall almost\r\nimmediately. And if Dagisthaeus had been willing immediately to apply\r\nfire to the foundations, I think that the city would have been captured\r\nby them straightway; but, as it was, he was awaiting encouragement from\r\nthe emperor, and so, always hesitating and wasting time, he remained\r\ninactive. Such, then, was the course of events in the Roman camp.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX\r\n\r\nBut Mermeroes, after passing the Iberian frontier with the whole Median\r\narmy, was moving forward with the River Phasis on his right. For he was\r\nquite unwilling to go through the country of Lazica, lest any obstacle\r\nshould confront him there. For he was eager to save the city of Petra\r\nand the Persians in it, even though a portion of the circuit-wall had\r\nfallen down suddenly. For it had been hanging in the air, as I have\r\nsaid; and volunteers from the Roman army to the number of fifty got\r\ninside the city, and raised the shout proclaiming the Emperor Justinian\r\ntriumphant. These men were led by a young man of Armenian birth, John by\r\nname, the son of Thomas whom they used to call by the surname Gouzes.\r\nThis Thomas had built many of the strongholds about Lazica at the\r\ndirection of the emperor, and he commanded the soldiers there, seeming\r\nto the emperor an intelligent person. Now John, when the Persians joined\r\nbattle with his men, was wounded and straightway withdrew to the camp\r\nwith his followers, since no one else of the Roman army came to support\r\nhim. Meanwhile the Persian Mirranes who commanded the garrison in Petra,\r\nfearing for the city, directed all the Persians to keep guard with the\r\ngreatest diligence, and he himself went to Dagisthaeus, and addressed\r\nhim with fawning speeches and deceptive words, agreeing readily to\r\nsurrender the city not long afterwards. In this way he succeeded in\r\ndeceiving him so that the Roman army did not immediately enter the city.\r\n\r\nNow when the army of Mermeroes came to the pass, the Roman garrison,\r\nnumbering one hundred men, confronted them there and offered a stalwart\r\nresistance, and they held in check their opponents who were attempting\r\nthe entrance. But the Persians by no means withdrew, but those who fell\r\nwere constantly replaced by others, and they kept advancing, trying with\r\nall their strength to force their way in. Among the Persians more than a\r\nthousand perished, but at last the Romans were worn out with killing,\r\nand, being forced back by the throng, they withdrew, and running up to\r\nthe heights of the mountain there were saved. Dagisthaeus, upon learning\r\nthis, straightway abandoned the siege without giving any commands to the\r\narmy, and proceeded to the River Phasis; and all the Romans followed\r\nhim, leaving their possessions behind in the camp. And when the Persians\r\nobserved what was being done, they opened their gates and came forth,\r\nand approached the tents of the enemy in order to capture the camp. But\r\nthe Tzani, who had not followed after Dagisthaeus, as it happened,\r\nrushed out to defend the camp, and they routed the enemy without\r\ndifficulty and killed many. So the Persians fled inside their\r\nfortifications, and the Tzani, after plundering the Roman camp proceeded\r\nstraight for Rhizaeum. And from there they came to Athens and betook\r\nthemselves to their homes through the territory of the Trapezuntines.\r\n\r\nAnd Mermeroes and the Median army came there on the ninth day after the\r\nwithdrawal of Dagisthaeus; and in the city they found left of the\r\nPersian garrison three hundred and fifty men wounded and unfit for\r\nfighting, and only one hundred and fifty men unhurt; for all the rest\r\nhad perished. Now the survivors had in no case thrown the bodies of the\r\nfallen outside the fortifications, but though stifled by the evil\r\nstench, they held out in a manner beyond belief, in order that they\r\nmight not afford the enemy any encouragement for the prosecution of the\r\nsiege, by letting them know that most of their number had perished. And\r\nMermeroes remarked by way of a taunt that the Roman state was worthy of\r\ntears and lamentation, because they had come to such a state of weakness\r\nthat they had been unable by any device to capture one hundred and fifty\r\nPersians without a wall. And he was eager to build up the portions of\r\nthe circuit-wall which had fallen down; but since at the moment he had\r\nneither lime nor any of the other necessary materials for the building\r\nready at hand, he devised the following plan. Filling with sand the\r\nlinen bags in which the Persians had carried their provisions into the\r\nland of Colchis, he laid them in the place of the stones, and the bags\r\nthus arranged took the place of the wall. And choosing out three\r\nthousand of his able fighting men, he left them there, depositing with\r\nthem victuals for no great length of time, and commanding them to attend\r\nto the building of the fortifications; then he himself with all the rest\r\nof the army turned back and marched away.\r\n\r\nBut since, if he went from there by the same road, no means of\r\nprovisioning his army was available, since he had left everything in\r\nPetra which had been brought in by the army from Iberia, he planned to\r\ngo by another route through the mountains, where he learned that the\r\ncountry was inhabited, in order that by foraging there he might be able\r\nto live off the land. In the course of this journey one of the notables\r\namong the Lazi, Phoubelis by name, laid an ambush for the Persians while\r\ncamping for the night, bringing with him Dagisthaeus with two thousand\r\nof the Romans; and these men, making a sudden attack, killed some of the\r\nPersians who were grazing their horses, and after securing the horses as\r\nplunder they shortly withdrew. Thus, then, Mermeroes with the Median\r\narmy departed from there.\r\n\r\nBut Goubazes, upon learning what had befallen the Romans both at Petra\r\nand at the pass, did not even so become frightened, nor did he give up\r\nthe guarding of the pass where he was, considering that their hope\r\ncentred in that place. For he understood that, even if the Persians had\r\nbeen able by forcing back the Romans on the left of the River Phasis to\r\ncross over the pass and get into Petra, they could thereby inflict no\r\ninjury upon the land of the Lazi, since they were utterly unable to\r\ncross the Phasis, in particular because no ships were at their disposal.\r\nFor in depth this river is not inferior to the deepest rivers, and it\r\nspreads out to a great width. Moreover it has such a strong current that\r\nwhen it empties into the sea, it goes on as a separate stream for a very\r\ngreat distance, without mingling at all with the sea-water. Indeed,\r\nthose who navigate in those parts are able to draw up drinking water in\r\nthe midst of the sea. Moreover, the Lazi have erected fortresses all\r\nalong the right bank of the river, in order that, even when the enemy\r\nare ferried across in boats, they may not be able to disembark on the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Justinian at this time sent to the nation of the Sabeiri the\r\nmoney which had been agreed upon, and he rewarded Goubazes and the Lazi\r\nwith additional sums of money. And it happened that long before this\r\ntime he had sent another considerable army also to Lazica, which had not\r\nyet arrived there. The commander of this army was Rhecithancus, from\r\nThrace, a man of discretion and a capable warrior. Such then was the\r\ncourse of these events.\r\n\r\nNow when Mermeroes got into the mountains, as I have said, he was\r\nanxious to fill Petra with provisions from there. For he did not by any\r\nmeans think that the victuals which they had brought in with them would\r\nsuffice for the garrison there, amounting to three thousand men. But\r\nsince the supplies they found along the way barely sufficed for the\r\nprovisioning of that army, which numbered no less than thirty thousand,\r\nand since on this account they were able to send nothing at all of\r\nconsequence to Petra, upon consideration he found it better for them\r\nthat the greater part of the army should depart from the land of\r\nColchis, and that some few should remain there, who were to convey to\r\nthe garrison in Petra the most of the provisions which they might find,\r\nwhile using the rest to maintain themselves comfortably. He therefore\r\nselected five thousand men and left them there, appointing as commanders\r\nover them Phabrizus and three others. For it seemed to him unnecessary\r\nto leave more men there, since there was no enemy at all. And he himself\r\nwith the rest of the army came into Persarmenia and remained quietly in\r\nthe country around Doubios.\r\n\r\nNow the five thousand, upon coming nearer to the frontier of Lazica,\r\nencamped in a body beside the Phasis River, and from there they went\r\nabout in small bands and plundered the neighbouring country. Now when\r\nGoubazes perceived this, he sent word to Dagisthaeus to hasten there to\r\nhis assistance: for it would be possible for them to do the enemy some\r\ngreat harm. And he did as directed, moving forward with the whole Roman\r\narmy with the River Phasis on the left, until he came to the place where\r\nthe Lazi where encamped on the opposite bank of the river. Now it\r\nhappened that the Phasis could be forded at this point, a fact which\r\nneither the Romans nor the Persians suspected in the least because of\r\ntheir lack of familiarity with these regions; but the Lazi knew it well,\r\nand they made the crossing suddenly and joined the Roman army. And the\r\nPersians chose out a thousand men of repute among them and sent them\r\nforth, that no one might advance against the camp to harm it. And two of\r\nthis force, who had gone out ahead of their fellows to reconnoitre, fell\r\nunexpectedly into the hands of the enemy and informed them of the whole\r\nsituation. The Romans, therefore, and the Lazi fell suddenly upon the\r\nthousand men, and not one of them succeeded in escaping, but the most of\r\nthem were slain, while some also were captured; and through these the\r\nmen of Goubazes and Dagisthaeus succeeded in learning the numbers of the\r\nMedian army and the length of the journey to them and the condition in\r\nwhich they then were. They therefore broke camp and marched against them\r\nwith their whole army, calculating so that they would fall upon them\r\nwell on in the night; their own force amounted to fourteen thousand men.\r\nNow the Persians, having no thought of an enemy in their minds, were\r\nenjoying a long sleep; for they supposed that the river was impassable,\r\nand that the thousand men, with no one to oppose them, were making a\r\nlong march somewhere. But the Romans and Lazi at early dawn unexpectedly\r\nfell upon them, and they found some still buried in slumber and others\r\njust roused from sleep and lying defenceless upon their beds. Not one of\r\nthem, therefore, thought of resistance, and the majority were caught and\r\nkilled, while some also were captured by the enemy, among whom happened\r\nto be one of the commanders; only a few escaped in the darkness and were\r\nsaved. And the Romans and Lazi captured the camp and all the standards,\r\nand they also secured many weapons and a great deal of money as plunder,\r\nbesides great numbers of horses and mules. And pursuing them for a very\r\ngreat distance they came well into Iberia. There they happened upon\r\ncertain others of the Persians also and slew a great number. Thus the\r\nPersians departed from Lazica; and the Romans and Lazi found there all\r\nthe supplies, including great quantities of flour, which the barbarians\r\nhad brought in from Iberia, in order to transport them to Petra, and\r\nthey burned them all. And they left a large number of Lazi in the pass,\r\nso that it might no longer be possible for the Persians to carry in\r\nsupplies to Petra, and they returned with all the plunder and the\r\ncaptives. [549 A.D.] And the fourth year of the truce between the Romans\r\nand Persians came to an end, being the twenty-third year of the reign of\r\nthe Emperor Justinian.\r\n\r\nAnd John the Cappadocian one year before this came to Byzantium at the\r\nsummons of the emperor. For at that time the Empress Theodora had\r\nreached the term of her life. However, he was quite unable to recover\r\nany of his former dignities, but he continued to hold the priestly\r\nhonour against his will; and yet the vision had often come to the man\r\nthat he would arrive at royalty. For the divine power is accustomed to\r\ntempt those whose minds are not solidly grounded by nature, by holding\r\nbefore their vision, on great and lofty hopes, that which is counted\r\nsplendid among men. At any rate the marvel-mongers were always\r\npredicting to this John many such imaginary things, and especially that\r\nhe was bound to be clothed in the garment of Augustus. Now there was a\r\ncertain priest in Byzantium, Augustus by name, who guarded the treasures\r\nof the temple of Sophia. So when John had been shorn and declared worthy\r\nof the priestly dignity by force, inasmuch as he had no garment becoming\r\na priest, he had been compelled by those who were in charge of this\r\nbusiness to put on the cloak and the tunic of this Augustus who was near\r\nby, and in this, I suppose, his prophecy reached its fulfilment.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1]\r\n\r\nThat is, the Saracens subject to the Romans and those subject to the\r\nPersians.\r\n\r\n[2]\r\n\r\nCf.
