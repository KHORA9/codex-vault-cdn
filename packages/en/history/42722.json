The appearance\r\nof the Marquis de Rochegude’s exhaustive work, on somewhat the same\r\nlines in a more extensive compass, took me by surprise, and I thought\r\nfor a moment that it would render my book superfluous. The vast\r\nconcourse of English-speaking people brought hither by the great war,\r\npeople keen to learn the history of the beautiful old buildings they\r\nfind here on every side, made me understand that an English book of\r\nrelatively small compass was needed, and I set to work to finish the\r\nvolume planned and begun so long ago.\r\n\r\nI had made the personal acquaintance and consequent notes of most of the\r\nancient “Stones of Paris” before looking up published notes concerning\r\nthem. When such notes were looked up, I can only say their sources were\r\nfar too numerous and too scattered to be recorded here. I must beg every\r\none who may have published anything worth while on Old Paris to receive\r\nmy thanks, for I have doubtless read their writings with interest and\r\nbenefit. But I must offer special thanks to M. de Rochegude,\r\nfor--writing under pressure to get the book ready for press--his work\r\nas a reference book, while pursuing my own investigations, has been\r\ninvaluable.\r\n\r\nTo my readers I would say peruse what I have written, but use your own\r\neyes, your own keen observation for learning much more than could be\r\nnoted here. Look into every courtyard in the ancient quarters, look\r\nattentively at every dwelling along the old winding streets, and fail\r\nnot to look up to their roofs. The roofs are never alike. They are\r\nstrikingly picturesque. Old world builders did not work mechanically,\r\ndid not raise streets in machine-like style, each structure exactly like\r\nits neighbour, one street barely distinguishable from the street running\r\nparallel or crossing it, according to the habit of to-day. The builders\r\nof _les jours d’antan_ loved their craft; every single house gave scope\r\nfor some artistic trait. The roofs offered a fine field for\r\narchitectural ingenuity: wonderfully planned windows, chimneys,\r\nbalconies, gables are to be seen on the roofs often in most unexpected\r\ncorners, in every part of the _Vieux Paris_. Look up!--I cannot urge\r\nthis too strongly. And within every old _hôtel_--the French term for\r\nprivate house or mansion--examine each staircase. In the erection of a\r\nstaircase the architect of past ages found grand scope for graceful\r\nlines, and exquisite workmanship. Thus walks even through the dimmest\r\ncorners of _la Ville Lumière_ will be for lovers of old-time vestiges a\r\njoy for ever.\r\n\r\nThis was an iconoclastic age even before the destructiveness of the\r\nawful war just over. Precious architectural and historical relics were\r\nswept away to make room for brand-new buildings. As it has been\r\nimpossible during the past months to verify in every instance the\r\nup-to-date accuracy of notes made previously, it is probable that some\r\nold structures referred to in these pages as still standing may no\r\nlonger be found on the spot indicated. But whether in such cases their\r\nsite be now an empty space, or occupied by newly built walls, it cannot\r\nfail to be interesting as the site where a vanished historic structure\r\nstood erewhile.\r\n\r\nJETTA SOPHIA WOLFF.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER                                                           PAGE\r\n\r\n  I.

LOUVRE\r\n\r\nThe Louvre has existed on the selfsame site from the earliest days of\r\nthe history of Paris and of France. It began as a rough hunting-lodge,\r\nerected in the time of the _rois fainéants_--the “do-nothing” kings: a\r\nprimitive hut-like construction in the dark wolf-haunted forest to the\r\nnorth of the settlement on the islets of the Seine, called Leutekia, the\r\ncity of mud, on account of its marshy situation, or Loutouchezi, the\r\nwatery city, by its Gallic settlers, by the Romans Lutetia\r\nParisiorum--the Paris of that long-gone age. The name Louvre, therefore,\r\nmay possibly be derived from the Latin Word _lupus_, a wolf. More\r\nprobably its origin is the old word _leouare_, whence lower, louvre: a\r\nhabitation.\r\n\r\nLutetia grew in importance, and the royal hunting-lodge in its vicinity\r\nwas made into a fortress. The city of mud was soon known by the tribe\r\nname only, Parisii-Paris, and the Louvre, freed from surrounding forest\r\ntrees, came within the city bounds. It was gradually enlarged and\r\nstrengthened. A white circle in the big court shows the site of the\r\nfamous gate between two Grosses Tours built in the time of the\r\nwarrior-king Philippe-Auguste. Twelve towers of smaller dimensions were\r\nadded by Charles V. Each tower had its own special battalion of\r\nsoldiers. The inner chambers of each had their special use. In the Tour\r\ndu Trésor, the King kept his money and portable objects of great value.\r\nIn the Tour de la Bibliothèque were stored the books of those days,\r\nfirst collected by King Charles V, and which formed the nucleus of the\r\nNational Library. Charles V made many other additions and adornments,\r\nand the first clocks known in France were placed in the Louvre in the\r\nyear 1370. About the same time a primitive stove--a _chauffe-poële_--was\r\nfirst put up there. The grounds surrounding the fortress were laid out\r\nwith care, the chief garden stretching towards the north. A menagerie\r\nwas built and peopled; nightingales sang in the groves. The palace\r\nbecame a sumptuous residence. Sovereigns from foreign lands were\r\nreceived by the Kings of France with great pomp in “_Notre Chastel du\r\nLouvre, où nous nous tenons le plus souvent quand nous sommes en notre\r\nville de Paris_.”\r\n\r\nThe Louvre was the scene of two of the most important political events\r\nof the fourteenth century. In the year 1303, when Philippe-le-Bel was\r\nKing, the second meeting of that imposing assembly of barons, prelates\r\nand lesser magnates of the realm which formed, as a matter of fact, the\r\nfirst _états généraux_ took place there. In 1358, at the time of the\r\nrising known as the Jacquerie, Étienne Marcel, Prévôt des Marchands,\r\nmade the Louvre his headquarters. In the fourteenth century a King of\r\nEngland held his court there: Henry V, victorious after Agincourt, kept\r\nChristmas in great state in Paris at the Louvre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LE VIEUX LOUVRE]\r\n\r\nThe royal palaces of those days, like great abbeys, were fitted with\r\neverything that was needed for their upkeep and the sustenance of their\r\nstaff. Workmen, materials, provisions were at hand, all on the premises.\r\nA farm, a Court of Justice, a prison were among the most essential\r\nelements of palace buildings and domains. Yet the Louvre with its\r\nprestige and its immense accommodation was never inhabited continuously\r\nby the Kings of France, and in the sixteenth century the Palace was so\r\ncompletely abandoned as to be on the verge of ruin. Then François I,\r\nlooking forward to the state visit of the Emperor Charles-Quint, sent\r\nworkmen in haste and in vast numbers to the Louvre, to repair and\r\nenlarge. Pierre Lescot, the most distinguished architect of the day,\r\ntook the great task in hand. The Grosse Tour had already been razed to\r\nthe ground. The ancient walls to the south and west were now knocked\r\ndown. One wall of the Salle des Cariatides, and the steps leading from\r\nthe underground parts of the palace to the ground floor, are all that\r\nremain of the Louvre of Philippe-Auguste.\r\n\r\nIt is from this sixteenth-century restoration that the Old Louvre as we\r\nknow it dates in its chief lines. Much of the work of decoration was\r\ndone by Jean Goujon and by Paul Pouce, a pupil of Michael Angelo. But\r\nthe Louvre nevermore stood still. Thenceforward each successive\r\nsovereign, at some period of his reign, took the palace in hand to\r\nbeautify, rebuild or enlarge--sometimes, however, getting little beyond\r\nthe designing of plans. Richelieu, that arch-conceiver of plans,\r\narchitectural as well as political, would fain have enlarged the old\r\npalace on a very vast scale. His King, Louis XIII, laid the first stone\r\nof the Tour de l’Horloge. As soon as the wars of the Fronde were over,\r\nLouis XIV, the greatest builder of that and succeeding ages, determined\r\nto enlarge in his own grand way. An Italian architect of repute was\r\nsummoned from Italy; but he and Louis did not agree, and the Italian\r\nwent back to his own land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LOUVRE OF TO-DAY]\r\n\r\nThe grand Colonnade, on the side facing the old church,\r\nSt-Germain-l’Auxerrois, was built between the years 1667-80 by Claude\r\nPerrault. The façade facing the quay to the south was then added. After\r\nthe death of the King’s active statesman, Colbert, work at the Louvre\r\nstopped. The fine palace fell from its high estate. It may almost be\r\nsaid to have been let out in tenements. Artists, savants, men of\r\nletters, took rooms there--_logements!_ The Louvre was, as a matter of\r\nfact, no longer a royal palace. Its “decease” as a king’s residence\r\ndates from the death of Colbert. The Colonnade was restored in 1755 by\r\nthe renowned architect, Gabriel, and King Louis XVI first put forward\r\nthe proposition of using the palace as a great National Museum. It was\r\nthe King’s wish that all the best-known, most highly valued works of art\r\nin France should be collected, added to the treasures of the _Cabinet du\r\nRoi_, and placed there. The Revolutionary Government put into effect the\r\nguillotined King’s idea. The names of its members may be read inscribed\r\non two black marble slabs up against the wall of the circular\r\nante-chamber leading to the Galerie d’Apollon, where are preserved and\r\nshown the ancient crown jewels of France, the beautiful enamels of\r\nLimoges and many other precious treasures once the possession of\r\nroyalty. This grand gallery, planned and begun by Lebrun in the\r\nseventeenth century, is modern, built in the nineteenth century by\r\nDuban.\r\n\r\nThe First Empire saw the completion of the work begun by the\r\nRevolutionists. In the time of Napoléon I the marvellous collection of\r\npictures, statuary, art treasures of every description, was duly\r\narranged and classified. The building of the interior court was finished\r\nin 1813.\r\n\r\nOn the establishment of the Second Empire, Napoléon III set himself the\r\ntask of completely restoring the Louvre and extending it. The Pavillon\r\nde Flore was then rebuilt, joining the ancient palace with the\r\nTuileries, which for two previous centuries had been the habitation of\r\nFrench monarchs.\r\n\r\nAfter the disasters of 1870-71 restoration was again undertaken, but\r\nthough the Tuileries had been burnt to the ground the Louvre had\r\nsuffered comparatively little damage.\r\n\r\nWithin its walls the Louvre has undergone drastic changes since its\r\nconversion from a royal palace to a National Museum. The Salle des Fêtes\r\nof bygone ages has become the Salle Lacaze with its fine collection of\r\nmasterpieces. What was once the King’s Cabinet, communicating with the\r\nsouth wing, where in her time Marie de’ Medici had her private rooms, is\r\nknown as the Salle des Sept Cheminées, filled with examples of early\r\nnineteenth-century French art.\r\n\r\nIn the Salle Carrée, where Henri IV was married, and where the murderers\r\nof President Brisson met their fate by hanging--swung from the beams of\r\nthe ceiling now finely vaulted--masterpieces of all the grandest epochs\r\nin art are brought together; from among them disappeared in 1911 the now\r\nregained Mona Lisa. Painting, sculpture, works of art of every kind,\r\nevery age and every nation fill the great halls and galleries of the\r\nLouvre. We cannot attempt a description of its treasures here. Let all\r\nwho love things of beauty, all who take pleasure in learning the\r\nwonderful results of patient work, go and see[A].\r\n\r\nNor can I recount here the numberless incidents, the historic happenings\r\nof which the Louvre was the scene. It is customary to point out the\r\ngilded balcony from which Charles IX is popularly supposed to have fired\r\nupon the Huguenots, or to have given the signal to fire, on that fatal\r\nnight of St-Bartholemew, 1572. But the balcony was not yet there. Nor is\r\nit probable the young King fired from any other balcony or window. Shots\r\nwere fired maybe from the palace by men less timorous.\r\n\r\nOn the Seine side of the big court is the site of the ancient Gothic\r\nPorte Bourbon, where Admiral Coligny was first struck and Concini shot\r\nthrough the heart. In our own time we have the startling theft of the\r\nJoconde from the Salle Carrée, its astonishing return, and the hiding\r\naway of the treasures in the days of war, of air-raids and long-range\r\nguns and threatened invasion, to strike our imagination. “The great\r\nblack mass,” which the enemy aviator saw on approaching Paris, and knew\r\nit must be the Louvre, grand, majestic, undisturbed, is the most notable\r\nmonument of Paris and of France.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TUILERIES\r\n\r\nThe Palace has gone, burnt to the ground in the war year 1870-71. The\r\ngardens alone remain, those beautiful Tuileries gardens, the brightest\r\nspot on the right bank of the Seine. Several moss-grown pillars, some\r\nremnants of broken arches, the pillars and frontal of the present Jeu de\r\nPaume and of the Orangery, are all that is left to-day of the royal\r\ndwelling that erewhile stood there. The palace was built at the end of\r\nthe sixteenth century by Catherine de’ Medici to replace the ancient\r\npalace Les Tournelles, in the Place Royale, now Place des Vosges, where\r\nKing Henri II had died at a festive tournament, his eye and brain\r\npierced by the sword of his great general, Comte de Montmorency. Queen\r\nCatherine hated the sight of the palace where her husband had died thus\r\ntragically. Its destruction was decreed; and the Queen commanded the\r\nerection in its stead of the _magnifique bâtiment de l’Hôtel royal, dit\r\ndes Tuileries des Parisiens, parcequ’il y avait autrefois une Tuilerie\r\nau dit lieu_.\r\n\r\nThe site of that big tile-yard was in those days outside the city\r\nboundary. The architect, Philibert Delorme, set to work with great\r\nardour. A rough road was made leading from the _bac_, i.e. the ford\r\nacross the Seine, now spanned near the spot by the Pont Royal, to the\r\nquarries in the neighbourhood of Notre-Dame-des-Champs and Vaugirard,\r\nwhence stone was brought. Thus was born the well-known Rue du Bac. The\r\npalace was from the first surrounded by a fine garden, separated until\r\nthe time of Louis XIV from the Seine on the one side, from the palace on\r\nthe other, by a _ruelle_; i.e. a narrow street, a lane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PALAIS DES TUILERIES]\r\n\r\nCatherine took up her abode at the new palace as soon as it was\r\nhabitable; but the Queen-Mother was restless and oppressed, haunted by\r\npresentiments of evil. An astrologer had told her she would meet her\r\ndeath beneath the ruins of a mansion in the vicinity of the church,\r\nSt-Germain-l’Auxerrois. She left her new palace, therefore, bought the\r\nsite of several houses, appropriated the ground and buildings of an old\r\nconvent in the neighbourhood of St-Eustache, had erected on the spot a\r\nfine dwelling: l’hôtel de la Reine, known later as l’hôtel de Soissons,\r\nwhere we see to-day the Bourse de Commerce. One column of the Queen’s\r\npalace still stands there, within it a narrow staircase up which she\r\nwas wont to climb with her Italian astrologer.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Tuileries palace showed no signs of ruin--quite the\r\nreverse. Catherine’s son, Charles IX, had a bastion erected in the\r\ngarden on the Seine side; a small dwelling-house, a pond, an aviary, a\r\ntheatre, an echo, a labyrinth, an orangery, a shrubbery were soon added.\r\nHenri IV began a gallery to join the new palace to the Louvre, a work\r\naccomplished only under Louis XIV. Under Henri’s son, Louis XIII, the\r\nTuileries was the centre of the smart life of the day; visitors of\r\ndistinction, but not of royal rank, were often entertained in royal\r\nstyle in the pavilion in the garden. Under Louis XIV the King’s renowned\r\ngarden-planner, Le Nôtre, took in hand the spacious grounds and made of\r\nthem the Jardin des Tuileries, so famous ever since. The fine statues by\r\nCoustou, Perrault, Bosi, etc., were soon set up there. The _manège_ was\r\nbuilt--a club and riding-school stretching from what is now the Rue de\r\nRivoli from the then Rue Dauphine, now Rue St-Roch, to Rue Castiglione.\r\nThere the _jeunesse dorée_ of the day learned to hold in hand their\r\nfiery thoroughbreds. The cost of subscription was 4000 francs--£160--a\r\nyear, a vast sum then. Each member was bound to have his personal\r\nservant, duly paid and fed. A swing-bridge was set across the moat on\r\nthe side of the waste land, soon to become Place Louis XV, now Place de\r\nla Concorde.\r\n\r\nThe Garden was not accessible to the public in those days. Until the\r\noutbreak of the Revolution, the _noblesse_ or their privileged\r\nassociates alone had the right to pace its alleys. Soldiers were never\r\npermitted to walk there. Once a year only, a great occasion, its gates\r\nwere thrown open to the _peuple_.\r\n\r\nA period of neglect followed upon the fine work done under Louis XIV.\r\nHis successor cared nothing for the Tuileries palace and grounds. They\r\nfell into a most lamentable state; and, when in the troublous days of\r\nthe year 1789, Louis XVI, Marie-Antoinette and their little son took up\r\ntheir abode at the Tuileries, the Dauphin looked round in disgust.\r\n“Everything is very ugly here, _maman_,” he said. It was the Paris home\r\nof the unhappy royal family thenceforth until they were led from the\r\nshelter of its walls to the Temple prison. It was from the Tuileries\r\nthey made the unfortunate attempt to fly from France. Stopped at\r\nVarennes, the would-be fugitives were led back to the palace across the\r\nswing-bridge on the south-western side. Beneath the stately trees of the\r\ngarden the Swiss Guards were massacred soon afterwards. The\r\nRevolutionary authorities had taken possession of the Riding-School, a\r\nband of tricolour ribbon was stretched along its frontage and the\r\nAssemblée Nationale, which had sat first in the old church, St-Pol, then\r\nat the _archevêché_, installed itself there. There, under successive\r\ngovernments, were decreed the division of France into departments, the\r\nsuppression of monastic orders, the suspension of the King’s royal power\r\nafter his flight. And there, in 1792, Louis XVI was tried, and after a\r\nsitting lasting thirty-seven hours condemned to death. The Terrace was\r\nnicknamed the Jardin National; sometimes it was called the Terre de\r\nCoblentz, a sarcastic reference to emigrated nobles who erewhile had\r\ndisported there. In 1793, potatoes and other vegetables--food for the\r\npopulation of Paris--grew on Le Nôtre’s flower-beds, replacing the gay\r\nblossoms of happier times, even as in our own dire war days beans, etc.,\r\nare grown in the park at Versailles, and the government of the day sat\r\nin the Salle des Machines within the Palace walls.\r\n\r\nOn June 7th, 1794, the Tuileries palace and gardens were the scene of a\r\ngreat Revolutionary fête. A few months later the body of Jean-Jacques\r\nRousseau was laid out in state in the dry _bassin_ before being carried\r\nto the Panthéon. Revolutionary fêtes were a great feature of the day,\r\nand Robespierre, in the intervals of directing the deadly work of the\r\nGuillotine, devised the semi-circular flower-beds surrounded by stone\r\nbenches for the benefit of the weak and aged who gathered at those\r\nmerry-makings.\r\n\r\nThen it was Napoléon’s turn. The Tuileries became an Imperial palace.\r\nFor Marie Louise awaiting the birth of the son it was her mission to\r\nbear, a subterranean passage was made in order that the Empress might\r\npass unnoticed from the palace to the terrace-walk on the banks of the\r\nSeine. The birth took place at the Tuileries, and a year or two later a\r\npavilion was built for the special use of the young “Roi de Rome.” At\r\nthe Tuileries, in the decisive year 1815, the chiefs of the Armies\r\nallied against the Emperor met and camped.\r\n\r\nLouis XVIII died there in 1824. In 1848, Louis-Philippe, flying before\r\nthe people in revolt, made his escape along the hidden passage cut in\r\n1811 for Marie-Louise. The palace was then used as an ambulance for the\r\nwounded and for persons who fell fainting in the Paris streets during\r\nthe tumults of that year. Its last royal master was Napoléon III. The\r\nnew Emperor set himself at once to restore, beautify and enlarge. The\r\ngreat iron railing and the gates on the side of the Orangery were put up\r\nin 1853. A _buvette_ for officers was built in the garden. The Prince\r\nImperial was born at the Tuileries in 1854. During the twenty years of\r\nNapoléon’s reign, the Tuileries was the scene of gay, smart life. The\r\ncrash of 1870 was its doom. The Empress Eugénie fled from its shelter\r\nafter Sedan. The Commune set fire to its walls. Crumbling arches,\r\nblackened pillars remained on the site of the palace until 1883. Then\r\nthey were razed, cleared away and flower-beds laid out, where grand\r\nhalls erewhile had stood. The big clock had been saved from destruction.\r\nIt was placed among the historic souvenirs of the Musée Carnavalet. The\r\nPavillon de Marsan of the Louvre, built by Louis XIV, and the Pavillon\r\nde Flore joining the Tuileries, were rebuilt in 1874.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PALAIS-ROYAL\r\n\r\nCrossing the Rue de Rivoli in the vicinity of the Louvre, we come to\r\nanother palace--the Palais-Royal--of less ancient origin than the Louvre\r\nor the Tuileries, and never, strictly speaking, a royal palace. Built in\r\nthe earlier years of the seventeenth century by Louis XIII’s powerful\r\nstatesman, Cardinal Richelieu, it was known until 1643 as the\r\nPalais-Cardinal. Richelieu had lived at 20 and 23 of the Place-Royale,\r\nnow Place des Vosges, and at the mansion known as the Petit Luxembourg,\r\nRue de Vaugirard. The great man determined to erect for himself a more\r\nsplendid residence, and made choice of the triangular site formed by the\r\nRue des Bons-Enfants, Rue St-Honoré and the city wall of Charles V,\r\nwhereon to build. Several big mansions encumbered the spot. Richelieu\r\nbought them all, had their walls razed, gave the work of construction\r\ninto the hands of Jacques de Merrier. That was in the year 1629. The\r\ncentral mansion was ready for habitation four years later; additions\r\nwere made, more _hôtels_ bought and razed during succeeding years. Not\r\ncontent with mere courts and gardens around his palace, the Cardinal\r\nacquired yet another mansion, the hôtel Sillery, in order to make upon\r\nits site a fine square in front of his sumptuous dwelling. He did not\r\nlive to see its walls knocked down. A few days after the completion of\r\nthis purchase the famous statesman lay dead. It was then--a month or two\r\nlater--that the Palais-Cardinal became the Palais-Royal. By his will,\r\nRichelieu bequeathed his palace to his King, Louis XIII, who died a few\r\nmonths later. Anne d’Autriche, mother of the young Louis XIV, was living\r\nat the Louvre which, in a continual state of reparation and enlargement,\r\nwas not a comfortable home. Richelieu’s fine new mansion tempted her. It\r\nwas truly of royal aspect and dimensions, and was fitted with all “the\r\nmodern conveniences and comforts” of that day. To quote the words of a\r\nversifier of the time:\r\n\r\n    “Non, l’Univers ne peut rien voir d’égal.\r\n     Aux superbes dehors du Palais Cardinal.\r\n     Toute une ville entière avec pompe bâtie;\r\n     Semble d’un vieux fossé par miracle sortie.\r\n     Et nous fait présumer à ses superbes toits\r\n     Que tous ses habitants sont des Dieux ou des Rois.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PALAIS-ROYAL]\r\n\r\nIn 1643 the Queen moved across to it with her family. When the King left\r\nit in 1652, Henriette of England, widow of Charles I, lived there for a\r\ntime. In 1672 Louis XIV made it over to his brother the duc d’Orléans,\r\nwho did some rebuilding, but the most drastic changes were made in the\r\nvast construction close upon Revolutionary days. Then, in 1784,\r\nPhilippe-Égalité, finding himself in an impecunious condition,\r\nconceived a fine plan for making money. Round three sides of the\r\nextensive garden of his palace he built galleries lined with premises to\r\nlet--shops, etc.--and opened out around them three public thoroughfares:\r\nRue de Valois, Rue Beaujolais, Rue Montpensier. The garden thus\r\ntruncated is the Jardin du Palais-Royal as we know it to-day. It was\r\neven in those days semi-public. Parisians from all time have loved a\r\nfine garden, and the population of the city resented this curtailment.\r\nThey resented more especially the mercantile spirit which had prompted\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt was in the year 1787 that the theatre known subsequently as the\r\nComédie Française, more familiarly the “Français,” was built. The\r\nartistes of the _Variétés_ _Amusantes_ played there then, and for\r\nseveral succeeding years. The theatre Palais-Royal had already been\r\nbuilt, bore many successive different names and became for a time the\r\nThéâtre Montansier, later Théâtre de la Montagne. The fourth side of the\r\npalace had been left unfinished. The duc d’Orléans had planned its\r\ncompletion in magnificent style. The outbreak of the Revolution put a\r\nstop to all such plans. Temporary wooden galleries had been built in\r\n1784. They were burnt down in 1828 and replaced by the Galerie\r\nd’Orléans, now let out in flats.\r\n\r\nRichelieu was titular Superintendent-General of the Marine: some of the\r\nfriezes and bas-reliefs illustrative of this office, decorating the\r\nGalerie des Proues, are still to be seen there. But of the great\r\nstatesman’s original palace comparatively little remains. The duc\r\nd’Orléans, Regent for Louis XV, razed a great part of Richelieu’s\r\nconstruction; many of the walls of the palace as we know it date from\r\nhis time--1702-23. Disastrous fires wrought havoc in 1763 and 1781. The\r\nfinancially inspired transformations of Philippe-Égalité made in 1786,\r\nand finally the incendiary work of the Commune in 1871, changed the\r\nwhole aspect of the palace. It went through many phases also during the\r\nRevolution. Seized as national property, it was known for a time as\r\nPalais-Égalité. Revolutionary meetings took place in its gardens.\r\nRevolutionary clubs were organized in its galleries. The statue of\r\nCamille Desmoulins, set up in recent years--1905--records that decisive\r\nday, July 12th, 1789, when Desmoulins, haranguing the crowd, hoisted a\r\ngreen cocarde in sign of hope. That garden was thenceforth through many\r\nyears the meeting-place of successive political agitators. In our own\r\nday the Camelots du Roi met and agitated there.\r\n\r\nUnder Napoléon as Premier Consul, the Tribunat was established there in\r\na hall since razed. The Bourse de Commerce succeeded the Tribunat. Then\r\nthe Orléans regained possession of the palace and Prince Louis-Philippe\r\nwent thence to the hôtel de Ville, to return Roi des Français.\r\n\r\nThe galleries and the façade of the portico of the second court date\r\nfrom the first half of the nineteenth century. The upheaval of 1848 and\r\nthe reign of Napoléon III resulted in further changes for the\r\nPalais-Royal. It became for a time Palais-National, and was subsequently\r\nput to military uses. Then King Jérôme took up his abode there, and was\r\nsucceeded by his son Prince Napoléon. The little Gothic Chapel where\r\nPrincess Clothilde was wont to pray serves now as a lumberroom. Prince\r\nVictor, the husband of Princess Clémentine of Belgium, was born at the\r\nPalais-Royal in 1862.\r\n\r\nThe galleries surrounding the garden are brimful of historic\r\nassociations. Besides the clubs, noted Revolutionary clubs which met in\r\nthe cafés, notorious gambling-houses existed there.\r\n\r\nGalerie Montpensier, Nos. 7-12, is the ancient Café Corazza, the famous\r\nrendezvous of the Jacobins, frequented later by Buonaparte, Talma, etc.;\r\n36, once Café des Mille Colonnes, was so named from the multiple\r\nreflection in surrounding mirrors of its twenty pillars. At 50 we see\r\nthe former Café Hollandais, which had as its sign a guillotine; at 57-60\r\nthe Café Foy, before the doors of which Desmoulins harangued the people\r\ncrowding there.\r\n\r\nGalerie Beaujolais, No. 103--now a bar and dancing-hall--is the ancient\r\nCafé des Aveugles, where in the sous-sol an orchestra played, formed\r\nentirely of blind men from the Quinze-Vingts, the hospital at first\r\nclose by then removed to Rue Charenton, while the Sans-Culottes met and\r\nplotted. The mural portraits of notable Revolutionists seen there is\r\nmodern work.\r\n\r\nGalerie de Valois, Nos. 119, 120, 121, Ombres Chinoises de Séraphin\r\n(1784-1855) and Café Mécanique formed practically the first Express-Bar.\r\nAt 177, was formerly the cutler’s shop where Charlotte Corday bought the\r\nknife to slay Marat.\r\n\r\nOf the three streets made by the mercantile-minded duc d’Orléans the\r\nwalls of two still stand undisturbed. In Rue de Valois we see, at No. 1,\r\nthe ancient pavilion and passage leading from the Place de Valois,\r\nformerly the Cour des Fontaines, where the inhabitants of Palais-Royal\r\ndrew their water; at 6-8 the restaurant, Bœuf à la mode, built by\r\nRichelieu as hôtel Mélusine; at 10, the façade of hôtel de la\r\nChancellerie d’Orléans; at 20, hôtel de la Fontaine-Martel, inhabited\r\nfor a year by Voltaire, 1732-33. In Rue de Beaujolais we find the\r\ntheatre which began as Théâtre des Beaujolais, was for several years\r\ntowards the close of the eighteenth century a theatre of Marionnettes,\r\nand is now Théâtre Palais-Royal. Then Rue de Montpensier--1784--shows us\r\ninteresting old windows, ironwork, etc.; Rue Montesquieu--1802--runs\r\nwhere the Collège des Bons-Enfants once stood. The Mother-house of the\r\nRestaurants Duval, so well known in every quarter of Paris, at No. 6, is\r\non the site of the ancient Salle Montesquieu, once a popular dancing\r\nsaloon, then a draper’s shop with the sign of “Le Pauvre Diable” where\r\nthe founder of the world-known Bon Marché was in his youth a salesman.\r\n\r\nThree notable churches stand in the immediate vicinity of these three\r\npalaces. The ancient St-Germain-l’Auxerrois, St-Roch, erewhile its\r\nchapel of ease, and the Oratoire. St-Germain opposite the Louvre was the\r\nChapel Royal of past ages. Its bells pealed for royal weddings,\r\nannounced the birth of princes, tolled for royal deaths, rang on every\r\nother occasion of great national importance. Its biggest bell sounded\r\nthe death-knell of the Protestants on the fatal eve of St-Bartholomew’s\r\nDay, 1572. No part of the fine old church as its stands to-day dates\r\nback as a whole beyond the fifteenth century, but a chapel stood on the\r\nsite as early as the year 560. A baptistery and a school were built\r\nclose to the chapel about a century later, and this early foundation was\r\nthe eldest daughter of Notre-Dame--the Paris Cathedral. After its\r\ndestruction by the invading Normans, it was rebuilt as a fine church by\r\nRobert le Pieux, in the first years of the eleventh century, and no\r\ndoubt many of its ancient stones found a place in the walls of\r\nsuccessive rebuildings and restorations. The beautiful Gothic edifice is\r\nrich in ancient glass, marvellous woodwork, pictures, statuary and\r\nhistoric memorials.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: L’ÉGLISE ST-GERMAIN-L’AUXERROIS]\r\n\r\nThe first stone of St-Roch, in the Rue St-Honoré, was laid by Louis XIV,\r\nin 1653, but the church was not finished till nearly a century later. In\r\nthe walls of its Renaissance façade we see marks of the grape-shot--the\r\nfirst ever used--that poured from the guns of the soldiers of the young\r\nCorsican officer, Napoléon Buonaparte, in the year 1795. Buonaparte had\r\ntaken up his position opposite the church, facing the insurgent\r\n_sectionnaires_ grouped on its broad steps. The fight that followed was\r\nthe turning-point in the early career of the young officer fated to\r\nbecome for a time master of the city and of France. St-Roch is\r\nespecially interesting on account of its many monuments of notable\r\npersons of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and its groups of\r\nstatuary. The Calvary of the Catechists’ Chapel, as seen through the\r\nopened shutters over the altar in the Chapel of the Adoration, is of\r\nstriking effect.\r\n\r\nThe Oratory, Rue de Rivoli and Rue St-Honoré, was built during the early\r\nyears of the seventeenth century as the mother-church of the Society of\r\nthe Oratorians, founded in 1611, and served at times as the Chapel\r\nRoyal. The Revolution broke up the Society of the Oratorians, their\r\nchurch was desecrated, secularized. In 1810, it was given to the\r\nProtestants and has been ever since the principal French Protestant\r\nChurch of Paris. The statue of Coligny on the Rue de Rivoli side is\r\nmodern--1889.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nAMONG OLD STREETS\r\n\r\n\r\nRound about these old palaces and churches some ancient streets still\r\nremain and many old houses, relics of bygone ages. Others have been\r\nswept away to make room for up-to-date thoroughfares, shops and\r\ndwellings. Place de l’École and Rue de l’École record the existence of\r\nthe famous school at St-Germain-l’Auxerrois, a catechists’ school in the\r\nfirst instance, of more varied scope in Charlemagne’s time, where the\r\npupils took their lessons in the open air when fine or climbed into the\r\nfont of the baptistery when the font was dry. Rue de l’Arbre-Sec, once\r\nRue de l’Arbre-Sel, from an old sign, a thoroughfare since the twelfth\r\ncentury, was in past days the site of the gallows. There it is said\r\nQueen Brunehaut was hacked to death. Part of this ancient street was\r\nknocked down to make way for the big shop “la Samaritaine”; but some\r\nancient houses still stand. No. 4, recently razed, is believed to have\r\nbeen the hôtel des Mousquetaires, the home of d’Artagnan,\r\nlieutenant-captain of that famous band.\r\n\r\nRue Perrault runs where in bygone times Rue d’Auxerre, dating from 1005,\r\nand Rue des Fossés St-Germain-l’Auxerrois stretched away to the\r\nMonnaie--the Mint. No. 4, hôtel de Sourdis, rebuilt in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, was the home in her childhood of Gabrielle d’Estrées. No. 2, is\r\nthe entrance to the _presbytère_ St-Germain-l’Auxerrois. Rue de la\r\nMonnaie, a thirteenth-century street known at first by other names,\r\nrecalls the existence of the ancient Mint on the site of Rue Boucher\r\nclose by. In Rue du Roule, eighteenth century, we see old ironwork\r\nbalconies. Rue du Pont-Neuf is modern, on the line of ancient streets of\r\nwhich all traces have gone. Most of the houses in Rue des Bourdonnais\r\nare ancient: In the walls of No. 31 we see two or three ancient stones\r\nof the famous La Trémouille Mansion once there occupied by the English\r\nunder Charles VI. No. 34 dates from 1615. From the door of 39 the\r\nTête-Noire with its _barbe d’Or_, which gave the house its name, still\r\nlooks down. The sixth-century cabaret of l’Enfant-Jesus, the monogram\r\nI.H.S. in wrought iron on its frontage, has been razed. No. 14 is\r\nbelieved to have been the home of Greuze. The impasse at 37, in olden\r\ntimes Fosse aux chiens, was a pig-market where in the fourteenth century\r\nheretics were burnt. Rue Bertin-Poirée dates from the early years of the\r\nthirteenth century, recording the name of a worthy citizen of those long\r\npast days. At No. 5 we see a curious old sign “La Tour d’Argent”; out of\r\nthis old street we turn into the Rue Jean-Lantier recording the name of\r\na thirteenth-century Parisian, much of it and the ancient place du\r\nChevalier-du-Guet which was here, swept away in 1854. Rue des\r\nLavandières-Ste-Opportune, thirteenth century, reminds us of the\r\nexistence of an old church, Ste-Opportune, in the neighbourhood. Rue des\r\nDeux-Boules existed under another name in the twelfth century. And here\r\nin the seventeenth century was l’École du Modèle, nucleus of l’Académie\r\ndes Beaux-Arts.\r\n\r\nRue des Orfèvres began in 1300 as Rue des Deux-portes. An old chapel,\r\nSt-Eloi, stood till 1786 by the side of No. 8. Rue St-Germain-l’Auxerrois\r\nwas a thoroughfare so far back as the year 820. No. 19 is the site of a\r\nfamous episcopal prison: For-l’Evêque. 38, at l’Arche Marion, duels were\r\nwont to be fought in olden days. Rue des Bons-Enfants, aforetime Rue\r\ndes Echoliers St-Honoré, was so-called from the College founded in 1202\r\nfor “les Bons-Enfants” on the site of the neighbouring Rue Montesquieu,\r\nsuppressed in 1602. Many of the old houses we see there were the\r\npossession and abode of the dignitaries of St-Honoré. A tiny church\r\ndedicated to Ste-Claire was in past days close up against the walls of\r\nNo. 12. A vaulted arch and roof and staircase, lately razed, formed\r\nthe entrance to the ancient cloister. Beneath a coat-of-arms over the\r\ndoorway of No. 11, where is the Passage de la Vérité, an old inscription\r\ntold of a reading-room once there, where both morning and evening papers\r\nwere to be found. 19, hôtel de la Chancellerie d’Orléans, is on the\r\nsite of a more ancient mansion. All the houses of this and neighbouring\r\nstreets show some trace of their former state. Rue Radziwill was once\r\nRue Neuve des Bons-Enfants, the name still to be seen on an old wall\r\nnear the Banque de France. Nearly all the houses there have now become\r\ndependencies and offices of the Banque de France, one side of which\r\ngives upon the even number side of the street. At No. 33 is a wonderful\r\ntwin staircase. At its starting it divides in two and winds up with\r\nold-time grace to the top story. Two persons can mount at once without\r\nmeeting. Rue la Vrillière dates from 1652, named after the Secrétaire\r\nd’État of Louis XIV, whose mansion, remodelled, is the Banque de France\r\nwith added to it the Salle Dorée des Fêtes and some other remains of the\r\nhôtel de Toulouse.\r\n\r\nRue Croix des Petits-Champs dates from 1600, its name referring to a\r\ncross which stood on the site of No. 12. No. 7, entrance of the old\r\nCloître St-Honoré. In the courtyard of No. 21 we see traces of the\r\nhabitation of the abbés. No. 23, hôtel des Gesvres, was the home of the\r\nparents of Mme de Pompadour.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo long and important streets, one ancient the other modern, stretch\r\nthrough the entire length of this first arrondissement from east to\r\nwest: Rue de Rivoli and Rue St-Honoré.\r\n\r\nRue de Rivoli, dating from the first half of the nineteenth century, was\r\nbegun at its western end in the year 1811, across the site of ancient\r\nroyal stables, along the line of the famous riding-school of the\r\nTuileries gardens, and on through grounds erewhile the property of the\r\nthree great convents: les Feuillants, les Capucins, l’Assomption. It\r\nswept away ancient streets and houses, picturesque courts and corners--a\r\nfine new thoroughfare built over the ruins of historic walls and\r\npavements. There is little to say, therefore, about the buildings one\r\nsees there now. The hôtel Continental is on the site of one of the first\r\nof the constructions then erected--the Ministère des Finances, built\r\nduring the second decade of the nineteenth century, burnt to the ground\r\nby the Commune in 1871. The famous Salle des Manèges, where the\r\nRevolutionary governments sat and King Louis XVI’s trial took place, was\r\non the site of the houses numbered 230-226: l’hôtel Meurice, restaurant\r\nRumpelmayer, etc., No. 186, a popular tearoom run by a British firm, is\r\nnear the site of the Grande Écurie of vanished royalty, and of a\r\nwell-known passage built there in the early years of the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Coligny fell assassinated on the spot occupied by the house\r\nnumber 144. Passing on into the fourth arrondissement, we come to the\r\nSquare St-Jacques, formed in 1854, where had stood the ancient church\r\nSt-Jacques-la-Boucherie, of which the tower alone remains, a beautiful\r\nsixteenth-century tower, restored in the nineteenth century by the\r\narchitect Ballu. Nos. 18-16 are on the site of the ancient convent of\r\nthe Petit St-Antoine. In its chapel the Committee of the section “des\r\ndroits de l’Homme” sat in Revolution days.\r\n\r\nRue St-Honoré is full of historic houses and historic associations. Its\r\npresent name dates only from the year 1540, recalling the existence of\r\nthe collegiate church of the district. Like most other long, old\r\nthoroughfares, Rue St-Honoré is made up of several past-time streets\r\nlying in a direct line, united under a single name. Almost every\r\nbuilding along its course bears interesting traces of past grandeur or\r\nof commercial importance. Many have quaint, odd sign-boards: No. 96 is\r\non the site of the Pavillon des Singes, where, in 1622, Molière was\r\nborn. At No. 115 we see inscriptions dating from 1715. No. 108 is\r\nl’hôtel de l’Ecouvette, formerly part of hôtel Brissac. No. 145 is on a\r\nsite where passed the boundary wall of Phillippe-Auguste and where was\r\nbuilt subsequently a mansion inhabited by the far-famed duc de Joyeuse,\r\nthen by Gabrielle d’Estrées, and wherein one Jean Châtel made an attempt\r\nupon the life of Henri IV. Nos. 180, 182, 184 were connected with the\r\nCloître St-Honoré. No. 202 bore an inscription recording the erection\r\nhere of the Royal Academy of Music by Pierre Moreau--1760-70--burnt down\r\nten years later. No. 161, the Café de la Régence, replaced the famous\r\ncafé founded at the corner of the Palais-Royal in 1681, the\r\nmeeting-place of chess-players. A chessboard was lent at so much the\r\nhour, the rate higher after sunset to pay for the two candles placed\r\nnear. Voltaire, Robespierre, Buonaparte, Diderot, etc., and in later\r\ndays Alfred de Musset and his contemporaries, met here. The city wall of\r\nCharles V passed across the site with its gateway, Porte St-Honoré. At\r\nthis spot Jeanne d’Arc was wounded in 1429 and carried thence to the\r\nmaison des Genêts on the site of No. 4, Place du Théâtre-Français. A bit\r\nof the ancient wall was found beneath the pavement there some ten years\r\nago. No. 167, Arms of England. No. 280: Jeanne Vanbernier is said to\r\nhave been saleswoman in a milliner’s shop here. No. 201 shows the\r\nold-world sign “Au chien de St-Roch.” At No. 211, hôtel St-James, are\r\ntraces of the ancient hôtel de Noailles, which included several distinct\r\nbuildings and extensive grounds. Part of it became, at the Revolution,\r\nthe Café de Vénus; part the meeting-place of the Committees of\r\nRevolutionary governments. At 320 we see another old sign-board: “A la\r\nTour d’Argent.” No. 334 was inhabited by Maréchal de Noailles, brother\r\nof the Archbishop of Paris, in 1700. Nos. 340-338 show traces of the\r\nancient convent of the Jacobins. At No. 350, hôtel Pontalba, with its\r\nfine eighteenth-century staircase, lived Savalette de Langes, keeper of\r\nthe Royal Treasure, who lent seven million francs to the brothers of\r\nLouis XVI, money never repaid, the home in Revolution days of Barrère,\r\nwhere Napoléon signed his marriage contract. Nos. 235, 231, 229, were\r\nbuilt by the Feuillants 1782 as sources of revenue, and are the last\r\nremaining vestiges of the old convent. At 249 we see the Arms and\r\nportrait of Queen Victoria dating from the time of Louis-Philippe. No.\r\n374 was the hôtel of Madame Géoffrin, whose salon was the meeting-place\r\nof the most noted politicians, _littérateurs_ and artistes of the day,\r\namong them Châteaubriand, who made the house his home for a time. At No.\r\n263 stands the chapel of the ancient convent des Dames de l’Assomption\r\n(_see_ p. 29).\r\n\r\nNo. 398 is perhaps in part the very house, more probably the house\r\nentirely rebuilt, inhabited for a time by Robespierre and some of his\r\nfamily and by Couthon. No. 400 was the Imperial bakery in the time of\r\nNapoléon III. No. 271, now a modern erection, was till quite recently\r\nthe famous cabaret du St-Esprit, dating from the seventeenth century,\r\nwhere during the Terreur sightseers gathered to watch the tragic\r\nchariots pass laden with victims for the guillotine. Marie-Antoinette\r\npassed that way and was subjected to that cruel scrutiny.\r\n\r\nThe greater number of the streets of this arrondissement running\r\nnorthwards start from Rue de Rivoli, and cross Rue St-Honoré, or start\r\nfrom the latter. Beginning at the western end of Rue Rivoli, we see Rue\r\nSt-Florentin dating from 1640, so named more than a century later when\r\nthe comte de St-Florentin deputed the celebrated architects Chalgrin and\r\nGabriel to build the mansion we see at No. 2. It was a splendid mansion\r\nthen, with surrounding galleries, fine gardens, a big fountain, and was\r\nthe home of successive families of the _noblesse_. In 1792, it was the\r\nVenetian Embassy, under the Terreur a saltpeter factory. At No. 12 was\r\nan inn where people gathered to watch the condemned pass to the\r\nscaffold.\r\n\r\nRue Cambon, so named after the Conventional author of the Grand Livre de\r\nLa Dette Publique, dates in its lower part, when it was Rue de\r\nLuxembourg, from 1719, prolonged a century later. Some of the older\r\nhouses still stand, and have interesting vestiges of past days; others,\r\nrazed in recent years, have been replaced by modern constructions. The\r\nnew building, “Cour des Comptes,” built to replace the Palais du Quai\r\nd’Orsay burnt by the Communards in 1871, is on the site of the ancient\r\nconvent of the Haudriettes, suppressed in 1793, when it became the\r\ngarrison of the Cent Suisses, later a financial depot. The convent\r\nchapel, left untouched, serves as the catechists’ chapel for the\r\nMadeleine, and has services attended especially by Poles.\r\n\r\nIn Rue Duphot, opened in 1807 across the old garden of the Convent of\r\nthe Conception, we see at No. 12 an ancient convent arch and courtyard.\r\n\r\nRue Castiglione (1811) stretches across the site of the convents Les\r\nFeuillants and Les Capucins.\r\n\r\nIn Rue du Mont-Thabor, stretching where was once a convent garden, a\r\nvaulted roof and chapel-like building at No. 24, at one time an artist’s\r\nstudio, remains of the convent once there, is about to be razed. Orsini\r\ndied at No. 10; Alfred de Musset at No. 6 (1857).\r\n\r\n\r\nPLACE VENDÔME\r\n\r\nIn the year 1685 Louis XIV set about the erection of a grand _place_\r\nintended as a monument in his own honour. The site chosen was that of\r\nthe hôtel Vendôme which had recently been razed, and of the neighbouring\r\nconvent of the Capucins. The death of Louvois--1691--interrupted this\r\nwork. It was taken in hand a year or two later by Mansart and Boffrand,\r\nwho designed in octagonal form the vast _place_ called at first Place\r\ndes Conquêtes, then Place Louis-le-Grand. A statue of Louis XIV was set\r\nup there in 1699. The land behind the grand façades and houses erected\r\nby the State was sold for building purposes to private persons, and the\r\nnotorious banker Law and his associates finished the Place in 1720.\r\nRoyal fêtes were held there and popular fairs. Soon it was the scene of\r\nfinancial agitations, then of Revolutionary tumults. On August 10, 1792,\r\nheads of the guillotined were set up there on spikes and the square was\r\nnamed Place des Piques. A bonfire was made of volumes referring to the\r\ntitle-deeds of the French _noblesse_ and the archives of the St-Esprit;\r\nand in 1796 the machines which had been used to make _assignats_ were\r\nsolemnly burnt there. In 1810 the Colonne d’Austerlitz was set up where\r\nerewhile had stood the statue of Louis XIV, made of cannons taken from\r\nthe enemy, its bas-reliefs illustrative of the chief events of the\r\nmomentous year 1805. It was surmounted by a statue of Napoléon, which,\r\nin 1814, the Royalists vainly attempted to pull down by means of ropes.\r\nIt was taken away later, the _drapeau blanc_ put up in its stead.\r\nNapoléon’s statue, melted down, was transformed into the statue of Henri\r\nIV on the Pont-Neuf, replacing the original statue set up there (_see_\r\np. 340). In 1833, Napoléon went up again, a newly designed statue,\r\nreplaced in its turn by a reproduction of the first one in 1865. In\r\n1871, the Column was overturned by the Communards, but set up anew by\r\nthe French Government under MacMahon.\r\n\r\nEvery mansion on the Place, most of them now commercial hotels or\r\nbusiness-houses, was at one time or another the habitation of noted men\r\nand women, and recalls historic events. The façades of Nos. 9 and 7 are\r\nclassed as historic monuments; their preservation cared for by the\r\nState. No. 23 was the scene of Law’s speculations after his forced move\r\nfrom his quarters in the old Rue Quincampoix. At No. 6 Chopin died.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLACE ET COLONNE VENDÔME]\r\n\r\nThe Rue and Marché St-Honoré are on the site of the ancient convent and\r\nchapel of the Jacobins, suppressed at the Revolution, and where the\r\nfamous club des Jacobins was established. The market dates from 1810.\r\nRue Gomboust dates from the thirteenth century, when it was Rue de la\r\nCorderie St-Honoré. Rue de Ste-Hyacinthe dates from 1650. Rue de la\r\nSourdière from the seventeenth century shows us many old-time walls and\r\nvestiges and much interesting old ironwork.\r\n\r\nOn the wall of the church St-Roch we still see the inscription “Rue\r\nNeuve-St-Roch,” the ancient name of the street at its western end. The\r\nstreet has existed from the close of the fifteenth century bearing\r\ndifferent names in the different parts of its course. The part nearest\r\nthe Tuileries was known in the eighteenth century as Rue du Dauphin, in\r\nRevolution days as Rue de la Convention. Many of its houses are ancient\r\nand of curious aspect.\r\n\r\nIn Rue d’Argenteuil, leading out of Rue St-Roch, once a country road,\r\nstood until recent years the house where Corneille died.\r\n\r\nRue des Pyramides dates only from 1806, but No. 2 of the street is noted\r\nas the meeting-place, in the rooms of a friend, of Béranger, Alexandre\r\nDumas, _père_, Victor Hugo and other famous writers of the day. In the\r\nfourth story of a house in the corner of the Place dwelt Émile Augier.\r\n\r\nFrom the Place du Théâtre-Français where the fountain has played since\r\nthe middle of the nineteenth century, the Avenue de l’Opéra opened out\r\nabout 1855 as Avenue Napoléon, cut through a conglomeration of ancient\r\nstreets and dwellings. Leading out of the Avenue there still remains in\r\nthis arrondissement Rue Molière, known in the seventeenth century as Rue\r\ndu Bâton-Royal, then as Rue Traversière, and always intimately\r\nassociated with actors and men of letters. Rue Ste-Anne was known in its\r\nearly days as Rue du Sang and Rue de la Basse Voirie, then an unsavoury\r\nalley-like thoroughfare. Its present name, after Anne d’Autriche, was\r\ngiven in 1633. Then for a time it was known as Rue Helvetius, in memory\r\nof a man of letters born there in 1715. Nearly all its houses are\r\nancient and were the habitation in past days of noted persons, artists\r\nand others. Nos. 43 and 47 were the property of the composer Lulli. The\r\nstreet runs on into arrondissement II, where at No. 49, hôtel Thévenin,\r\nwe see an old statue of John the Baptist holding the Paschal Lamb. At\r\nNo. 46 Bossuet lived and died. No. 63 was part of the New Catholic’s\r\nconvent. Nos. 64, 66, 68, mansions owned by Louvois.\r\n\r\nRue Thérèse (Marie-Thérèse of Austria) was in 1880 joined on to Rue du\r\nHazard, a short street so called from a famous gambling-house; No. 6 has\r\ninteresting old-time vestiges. At No. 23 we see two inscriptions\r\nhonouring the memory of Abbé de l’Epée, inventor of the deaf and dumb\r\nalphabet, who died at a house, no longer there, in Rue des Moulins. Rue\r\nVilledo records the name of a famous master-mason of olden time. Rue\r\nVentadour existed in its older part in 1640. Rue de Richelieu, starting\r\nfrom the Place du Théâtre-Français, goes on to arrondissement II in the\r\nvicinity of the Bourse. It dates from the time when the Cardinal was\r\nbuilding his palace. Most of its constructions show interesting\r\narchitectural features, vestiges of past days, many have historic\r\nassociations. Some of the original houses were rebuilt in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, some have quite recently been razed and replaced by modern\r\nerections. Much of the fine woodwork once at No. 21 was bought and\r\ncarried away by the Marquis de Breteuil; the rest by Americans. In a\r\nhouse where No. 40 now stands Molière died in 1763. No. 50, hôtel de\r\nStrasbourg, was rebuilt in 1738 by the mother of Madame de Pompadour. In\r\n1780 the musician Grétry lived in the fourth story of No. 52.\r\n\r\nRue du Louvre is a modern street where ancient streets once ran,\r\ndemolished to make way for it. At No. 13 we find traces of a tower of\r\nthe city wall of Philippe-Auguste, as also at No. 7 of the adjacent Rue\r\nCoquillère, a thirteenth-century street with, at No. 31, vestiges of an\r\nancient Carmelite convent. At No. 15 we find ourselves before an arched\r\nentrance and spacious courtyard surrounded by imposing buildings and in\r\nits centre an immense fountain. This structure is a modern re-erection\r\nof the ancient Cour des Fermes; the institution of the “Fermiers\r\nGénéraux” was suppressed in 1783 and definitely abolished by law in the\r\nfirst year of the Revolution--1789. The members, however, continued to\r\nmeet; many were arrested and shut up as prisoners in their own old\r\nmansion on this spot, used thenceforth, until the Revolution was over,\r\nas a State prison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE GREAT MARKETS\r\n\r\n\r\nLES HALLES CENTRALES\r\n\r\nThe legend telling us the great Paris Market was first called “les\r\nAlles”--no “H”--because everybody _y allait_, i.e. went there, need not\r\nbe taken seriously. Even in remote mediæval times the markets had some\r\ncovered premises or “Halles.” The earliest Paris market of which we have\r\nrecord takes us back to the year 1000, that momentous year predicted by\r\nsooth-sayers for the end of the world; few sowings, therefore, had been\r\nmade the preceding season. The market stalls of that year were but\r\nscantily furnished. That ancient market lying along the banks of the\r\nSeine in the vicinity of the present Place St-Michel, and its successor\r\non what was then Place de Grève (_see_ p. 95) went by the curious name\r\nPalu. In ancient days, under Louis-le-Gros, the site of the immense\r\nerection and market-square we see now was known of old as _le terrain\r\ndes champeaux_--the territory of little fields--land owned in part by\r\nthe King, in part by ecclesiastical authorities, and bought for the\r\ngreat market in the twelfth century. The sale of herrings, wholesale and\r\nretail, goes on to-day on the very site set apart for fishmongers in the\r\ntime of St. Louis. Rue Baltard, running through the centre of the\r\npavilions, records the name of the architect of the present structure,\r\nwhich dates from 1856. Rue Antoine-Carême records the name of Napoléon\r\nI’s cook. Ancient streets surround us here on every side, old houses,\r\ncurious old signs. Rue Berger is made up of several ancient streets\r\nunited. The part of Rue Rambuteau bordering les Halles lies along the\r\nline of four thirteenth-century streets known of yore by old-world\r\nnames. Rue des Halles, leading up to the Markets from the Rue Rivoli, a\r\nmodern thoroughfare (1854), made along the course of ancient streets,\r\nhas curious old streets leading into it: Rue des Déchargeurs, a\r\ncharacteristic name, was opened in 1310. The short Rue du Plat d’Étain\r\nopening out of it dates from 1300, when it was Rue Raoul Tavernier. Rue\r\nde la Ferronnerie, extremely narrow at that period, is noted as the\r\nscene of the assassination of Henri IV in front of a house on the site\r\nof No. 11 (14 May, 1610). From the days of Louis IX the street was, as\r\nits name implies, the resort of ironmongers. Good old ironwork is still\r\nseen on several of the houses. Rue Courtalon (thirteenth century) is\r\nentirely made up of ancient houses. Rue de la Lingerie, formerly Rue des\r\nGantiers, was a well-built street in the time of Henri II, but most of\r\nthe houses seen there now are modern. Rue Prouvaires--from _provoire_,\r\nold French for _prêtres_--thirteenth century, is referred to in the time\r\nof Louis IX as one of the finest streets of Paris. It extended formerly\r\nto the church St-Eustache. Of the old streets once along the course of\r\nthe modern Rue du Pont-Neuf all traces have been swept away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORTAIL DE ST-EUSTACHE]\r\n\r\nTo the north side of Les Halles, we find Rue Mondétour, dating from\r\n1292, but many of its ancient houses have been razed; modern ones\r\noccupy their site. A dancing-hall in this old street was the\r\nmeeting-place of French Protestants before the passing of the Edict of\r\nNantes. No. 14 has cellars in two stories.\r\n\r\nThe church St-Eustache is often familiarly referred to by the market\r\nwomen as Notre-Dame des Halles. The crypt, once the chapel Ste-Agnes,\r\nthe nucleus of the grand old church, dating from 1200, secularized but\r\nstill forming one with the sacred building, is a fruiterer’s shop--truly\r\nSt-Eustache is the church of the Markets. The edifice as it stands dates\r\nas a whole from the seventeenth century. Gothic in its grand lines, very\r\nstrikingly impressive, it has a Jesuit frontage, substituted for the\r\nGothic façade originally planned, and Renaissance ornamentation within.\r\nThe church was mercilessly truncated in the eighteenth century to allow\r\nfor the making and widening of surrounding streets.\r\n\r\nRue du Jour under other names has existed from the early years of the\r\nthirteenth century, but was then close up against the city wall of\r\nPhilippe-Auguste. Nos. 3, 4, 5, 7, 11 are ancient, and No. 25, with its\r\ntraces of bygone ages, is believed to be on the site of the house where\r\nCharles V made from time to time a _séjour_, hence the name, truncated,\r\nof the street.\r\n\r\nRue Vauvilliers, until 1864 Rue du Four St-Honoré, dates from the\r\nthirteenth century. Here, at No. 33, lodged young Buonaparte, the future\r\nEmperor, at the ancient hôtel de Cherbourg, in 1787. To-day it is a\r\nbutcher’s shop. Several of the houses have curious signs and other\r\nvestiges of past days. The circular colonnaded street we come to now,\r\nRue de Viarmes, was built in 1768 by the Prévôt des Marchands whose name\r\nit bears. It surrounds the Bourse de Commerce built in 1889 on the site\r\nof the Halles aux Blés erected in the first instance in 1767, twice\r\nburnt to the ground and twice subsequently rebuilt on the site of the\r\nfamous hôtel de Nesle where la Reine Blanche, mother of St. Louis, is\r\nsaid to have died in 1252. L’hôtel de Nesle was inhabited later by the\r\nblind King of Bohemia, killed at Crécy, and subsequently by other\r\npersons of note, then was taken to form part of the Couvent des Filles\r\nPénitentes, appropriated with several adjoining hôtels in after years by\r\nCatherine de’ Medici (_see_ p. 9). After the Queen’s death, as the\r\npossession of the comte de Bourbon, it was known as l’hôtel de Soissons;\r\nin 1749 it was razed to the ground. One ancient pillar, la Colonne de\r\nl’Horoscope, with its interior flight of steps still stands.\r\n\r\nRue Jean-Jacques Rousseau, in the days when its upper part was the\r\nancient Rue Platrière, the lower Rue Grenelle-St-Honoré, counted among\r\nits inhabitants Rousseau, Bossuet, Marat, Fragonard, Boucher, the\r\nduchesse de Valentinois, and other noted personages. Most of the ancient\r\ndwellings have been replaced by modern constructions. Where the General\r\nPost Office now stands, extending down Rue du Louvre, the comte de\r\nFlandre had a fine mansion in the thirteenth century. Destroyed in 1543,\r\nit was replaced by another fine hôtel, which became the Paris post\r\noffice in 1757, rebuilt in 1880. We see interesting architectural traces\r\nof past days at Nos. 15, 18, 19, 20, 33, 56, 64, 68. This brings us to\r\nRue Étienne-Marcel, its name recalling the stirring and tragic history\r\nof the Prévôt de Paris at the time of the Jacquerie-Marcel, in revolt\r\nagainst the Dauphin; Charles V had the two great nobles, Jean de\r\nConflans and Robert de Clermont, killed in the King’s presence, and was\r\nhimself struck down dead when on the point of giving Paris over to\r\nCharles-le-Mauvais in 1358. But the name only is ancient, the street is\r\nentirely modern, cut across the line where ancient streets once ran.\r\nSome few old-time vestiges remain here and there, notably the Tour de\r\nJean Sans Peur at No. 20, all that is left of the hôtel de Bourgoyne,\r\nbuilt in the thirteenth century, to which the tower was added in 1405;\r\nit was partially destroyed in the sixteenth century, while what still\r\nstood became a theatre, the chief Paris play-house, the cradle of the\r\nComédie Française.\r\n\r\nRue Montmartre, crossing Rue Étienne-Marcel and going on into the\r\narrondissement II, dates at this end--its commencement--from the close\r\nof the eleventh century. In Revolution days it was known as Rue\r\nMont-Marat! As long as Paris had fortified boundary walls there was\r\nalways a Porte Montmartre, moved northward three times, as the city\r\nbounds extended. The Porte of Philippe-Auguste was where the house No.\r\n30 now stands, and this part of the street was known then as Rue\r\nPorte-Montmartre. The Passage de la Reine de Hongrie memorizes a certain\r\n_dame de la Halle_ in whom Marie-Antoinette saw a remarkable likeness to\r\nher mother, the Queen of Hungary. The woman became for her generation\r\n“la Reine de Hongrie”--the alley where she dwelt was called by this\r\nname. She shared not only the title but the fate of royalty: was\r\nbeheaded by the guillotine.\r\n\r\nRue Montorgueil, beginning here and leading to the higher ground called\r\nwhen the Romans ruled in Gaul “Mons Superbus,” now the levelled\r\nboulevard Bonne-Nouvelle and its surrounding streets, was known in the\r\nthirteenth century as Mont Orgueilleux. In bygone days, the Parisians\r\nstrolled out to the Mont Orgueilleux to eat oysters. There was a famous\r\noyster-bed on the site of the house now razed where, in 1780, was born\r\nthat exquisite song and ballad writer, Béranger. The ancient house, No.\r\n32, is said to have been the home of the architect, Jean Goujon. The\r\nlittle side-street Rue Mauconseil dates from 1250, and tradition says\r\nits name is due to the _mauvais conseil_ given within the walls of the\r\nhôtel de Bourgoyne, close by, which led to the assassination of the duc\r\nd’Orléans by Jean Sans Peur. In Revolution days, therefore, it was\r\npromptly renamed for the nonce Rue du Bon Conseil! At No. 48 we find a\r\nfamous tripe-eating house. No. 47 was once the Central Sedan Chair\r\nOffice. At No. 51 we see interesting signs over the door, and painted\r\npanels signed by Paul Baudry within (1864). Nos. 64, 72 is the old\r\nsixteenth-century inn, the “Compas d’Or,” and the famous restaurant\r\nPhilippe. The coachyard of the inn is little changed from the days when\r\ncoaches plied between that starting-place and Dreux. The restaurant du\r\nRocher de Cancale, at No. 78, dating from 1820, where the most\r\ncelebrated men of letters and art of the nineteenth century met and\r\ndined, was at first “Le Petit Rocher,” then the successor of the ancient\r\nrestaurant at No. 59 dating from the eighteenth century, where the\r\n_dîners du Caveau_ and the _dîners du Vaudeville_ were eaten by gay\r\nliterary and artistic _dîneurs_ of olden time.\r\n\r\nRue Turbigo is modern and makes us think regretfully of ancient streets\r\nand of the apse of the church St-Elisabeth demolished to make way for\r\nit. Turning down Rue St-Denis, the famous “Grande Chaussée de Monsieur\r\nSt-Denis” of ancient days, the road along which legend tells us the\r\nsaint, coming from the heights above, walked carrying his head after\r\ndecapitation, we find it, from this point to the vicinity of the\r\nChâtelet, rich in historic buildings and vestiges of a past age. Kings\r\non their way to Notre-Dame entered Paris in state along this old road;\r\nit was connected more or less closely with every political event of\r\nbygone times, with Parisian pleasures too, for there of old the mystery\r\nplays went on. Curious old streets and passages open out of it: at 279\r\nthe quaint Rue Ste-Foy. In the court of No. 222 we see the hôtel St.\r\nChaumont, its façade on boulevard Sebastopol, dating from 1630.\r\n\r\nThe church we come to at No. 92 dedicated to St. Leu and St. Gilles was\r\nbuilt in the early years of the thirteenth century on the site of an\r\nearlier church, a dependent of the Abbaye St-Magloire close by,\r\nsuppressed at the Revolution. Subsequent restorations, and the building\r\nin the eighteenth century of a subterranean chapel for the knights of\r\nthe Holy Sépulcre, have resulted in an interesting old church of mingled\r\nGothic and Renaissance style; its apse was lopped off to make way for\r\nthe modern boulevard Sébastopol. The would-be assassin Cadoudal hid for\r\nthree days crouched up against the figure of Christ in the chapel\r\nbeneath the chancel (1804). Rue des Lombards dates from the thirteenth\r\ncentury, and at one or two of its houses, notably No. 62, we find an\r\nunderground hall with vaulted roof and Gothic windows. At No. 56 we see\r\nan open corner. It is “ground accurst.” The house of two Protestant\r\nmerchants who in 1579 were put to death for their “evil practices!” once\r\nstood there. Their dwelling was razed and a pyramid and crucifix were\r\nset up on the spot, soon afterwards removed to the cemetery des\r\nInnocents hard by.\r\n\r\nThe chemist’s shop at No. 44, “Au Mortier d’Or,” united now to its\r\nneighbour “A la Barbe d’Or,” dates, as regards its foundation, from the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In the window we see an open volume\r\nprinted in 1595 with the engraved portrait of the founder.\r\n\r\nRue des Innocents was opened in 1786 across the site of the graveyard of\r\nthe church des Saints-Innocents, founded in 1150 and which stood till\r\n1790. More than a million bodies are said to have been buried in that\r\nchurchyard. In 1780 the cemetery was turned into a market-place. But it\r\nwas again used as a burial ground for victims of the Revolution of 1830.\r\nTheir bones lie now beneath the Colonne de Juillet on the Place de la\r\nBastille. The market-place became a square: “Le Square des Innocents.”\r\nThe fine old fountain dating from 1550, the work of the famous sculptors\r\nPierre Lescot and Jean Goujon, was taken from its site in the Rue\r\nSt-Denis, restored by the best sculptors of the day, and set up there in\r\n1850. The beautiful portal of the ancient bureau des Marchandes-lingères\r\nwas placed there in more recent times. The ground floor of most of the\r\nold houses of this street are ancient _charniers_, many of them built by\r\none Nicolas Flamel. Therein were laid in past days the bones\r\nperiodically gathered from the graveyard. The name “Cabaret du Caveau”\r\nat No. 15 tells its own tale. In Rue Berger, formed along the line of\r\nseveral demolished streets of old, we see some ancient signs, but little\r\nelse of interest. Old signs too, in Rue de la Cossonnerie, so named from\r\nthe _cossonniers_, i.e. poultry-merchants, whose market was here and\r\nwhich was known as early as 1182 as Via Cochonerie. Rue des Prêcheurs is\r\nanother twelfth-century street and there we see many ancient houses:\r\nNos. 6-8, etc. Rue Pirouette, one of the most ancient of Paris streets,\r\nrecalls the days of the _pilori des Halles_, when its victims, forced to\r\nturn from side to side, made _la pirouette_. Here the duc d’Angoulême\r\nhad his head cut off under Louis XI, and the duc de Nemours in 1477. At\r\nNo. 5 we see the ancient doorway of the demolished hôtellerie du Haume\r\n(fourteenth century), at No. 9 was the cabaret de l’Ange Gabriel (now\r\nrazed), at No. 13 vestiges of an ancient mansion. A few old houses still\r\nstand in the Rue de la Grande Truanderie (thirteenth century). Rue de la\r\nPetite Truanderie, of the same date, was once noted for its old well,\r\n“le Puits d’Amour,” in the small square half-way down the street, of old\r\nthe _truands’_ quarter (_see_ p. 56).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE PALAIS DE JUSTICE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of Paris and of France, from the earliest days of their\r\nstory, is connected with the Palais de Justice on the western point of\r\nthe island on the Seine. The palace stands on the site of the habitation\r\nof the rulers of Lutetia in the days of the Romans, of the first\r\nMerovingian and of the first Capetian kings. The present building, often\r\nreconstructed, restored, enlarged, dates in its foundations and some\r\nother parts from the time of Robert le Pieux. King Robert built the\r\nConciergerie. Under Louis IX the palace was again considerably enlarged;\r\nthe kitchens of St. Louis are an interesting feature in the palace as we\r\nknow it. In 1434, Charles VII gave up the palace to the Parliament. It\r\nmet in the great hall above St. Louis’ kitchens, and round an immense\r\ntable there law tribunals assembled. For the French Parliament of those\r\ntimes was in some sort a great law-court. Guizot describes it as: “la\r\ncour souveraine du roi, la cour suprême du royaume.” Known in its\r\nearliest days as “Le Conseil du Roi,” its members were the grandees of\r\nthe kingdom: vassals, prelates, officers of State, and it was supposed\r\nto follow the King wherever he went, though as a matter of fact it\r\nrarely moved from Paris. When, in course of time, it was considered\r\ndesirable that its members should all be able not only to read but to\r\nwrite, the great nobles of that age declared they were not going to\r\nchange their swords for a writing-desk and many withdrew, to be replaced\r\nby men of lesser rank but greater skill in other directions than that of\r\narms, and who came to be regarded as the _noblesse de la robe_--distinct\r\nfrom _la noblesse de l’épee_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LA TOUR DE L’HORLOGE, LES “TOURS POINTUES” DE LA\r\nCONCIERGERIE ET LE MARCHÉ AUX FLEURS]\r\n\r\nThe big hall of that day and other adjacent halls and passages were\r\nburnt down more than once in olden times, and burnt down again in 1871,\r\nwhen the Communards wrought havoc on so many fine old buildings of their\r\ncity. The most thrilling incidents, the most stirring events in the\r\nhistory of the Nation had some point of connection with that ancient\r\npalace--often a culminating point. And within those grim walls where the\r\ndestinies of men and women of all conditions and ranks were determined,\r\nwhere tragedy held its own, scenes in lighter vein were not unknown in\r\nancient days. Mystery plays were often given there, and every year in\r\nthe month of May, reputed a “merry month,” even in the Palais de\r\nJustice, the company of men of law known as the “basoche,” planted a\r\nMay-tree in the courtyard before the great entrance doors--hence the\r\nname “la Cour de Mai.” It is a tragic courtyard despite its name, for\r\nthe Conciergerie prison opened into it; through the door of what is now\r\nthe Buvette du Palais--a refreshment-room--men and women condemned to\r\ndeath passed, in Revolution days, while other men and women, women\r\nchiefly, crowded on the broad steps above to see the laden _charrettes_\r\nstart off for the place of execution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LA SAINTE-CHAPELLE]\r\n\r\nThe Sainte-Chapelle, that wondrous piece of purest Gothic architecture,\r\nthe work of Pierre de Montereau (1245-48) built for the preservation of\r\nsacred relics brought by Louis IX on his return from the Holy Land,\r\nvividly recalls the days when the palace was a royal habitation. Its\r\nupper story was in direct communication with the royal dwelling-rooms;\r\nthe lower story was for the palace servants and officials. During the\r\nRevolution the chapel was devastated and used as a club and a\r\nflour-store. The Chambre des Comptes, a beautiful old building in the\r\ncourtyard of the Sainte-Chapelle, was destroyed by fire in 1737. Its big\r\narch was saved and forms part of the Musée Carnavalet (_see_ p. 81). A\r\nchief feature of the _chapelle_ is its exquisite stained glass.\r\n\r\nThe enlarging of the Palais in recent times (1908) swept away\r\nsurrounding relics of bygone ages. Some vestiges of past days still\r\nremain in Rue de Harlay opposite the Palais, to the west--Nos. 20, 54,\r\n52, 68, 74. The buildings of the boulevard du Palais and Rue de Lutèce,\r\non its eastern side, arrondissement IV, are all modern on ancient\r\nhistoric sites.\r\n\r\nPlace Dauphine dates from 1607. It was built as a triangular _place_,\r\nits name referring to the son of Henri IV. In earlier ages, the site\r\nformed two islets, on one of which, l’îlot des Juifs, Jacques de Morlay,\r\nGrand Master of the Templars, suffered death by burning in 1314. A\r\nfountain stood on the Place to the memory of General Desaix, erected by\r\npublic subscription, carted away in the time of the first Republic, and\r\nset up at Riom. Painters excluded from the Salon used to exhibit their\r\nwork here each year, in the open air, on Corpus Christi day. Some of the\r\nhouses still show seventeenth-and eighteenth-century vestiges. No. 28,\r\nnow much restored, was Madame Roland’s early home. The writer Halévy\r\ndied at 26 (1908).\r\n\r\nThe Quays of the island bordering the Palais north and south both date\r\nfrom the sixteenth century. Both have been curtailed by the enlargement\r\nof the Palais. On Quai des Orfèvres, the goldsmith’s quay, from the\r\nfirst the jewellers’ quarter, still stands the shop once owned by the\r\njewellers implicated in the affair of the “_Collier de la Reine_.” The\r\nQuai de l’Horloge is still the optician’s quarter and was known in olden\r\ndays as Quai des Morfondus, on account of the blasting winds which swept\r\nalong it--and do so still in winter-time. The palace clock in the fine\r\nold tower built in the thirteenth century, restored after the ravages of\r\nthe Revolution in the nineteenth, from which the quay takes its present\r\nname, is a successor of the first clock seen in France, set up there\r\nabout the year 1370. There, too, hung in olden days a great bell rung as\r\na signal on official occasions, and which perhaps rang out the\r\ndeath-knell of the Huguenots even before the sounding of the bell at\r\nSt-Germain l’Auxerrois, on the eve of St. Bartholomew’s Day, 1572.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE BIBLIOTHÈQUE NATIONALE\r\n\r\n\r\nARRONDISSEMENT II. (BOURSE)\r\n\r\nRue des Petits-Champs marks the boundary between the arrondissements I\r\nand II--the odd numbers in arrondissement I, the even ones in\r\narrondissement II. The street was opened in 1634. Many of its old houses\r\nstill stand and show us, without and within, some interesting\r\narchitectural features of past days. The hôtel Tubeuf, No. 8, destined\r\nwith adjoining mansions to become the Bibliothèque Nationale, was,\r\ntradition tells us, staked at the gambling table and won by the\r\nstatesman Mazarin. The Cardinal bought two adjoining _hôtels_ and\r\nsurrounding land as far as the Rue Colbert and built thereon his own\r\nfine mansion, using the two _hôtels_ as wings. The first books placed\r\nthere were those of his own library, a fine collection, taken at his\r\ndeath, according to the directions of his will, to the Collège des\r\nQuatre Nations, known to-day as the Institut Mazarin. The Cardinal’s\r\nvast mansion was divided among his heirs and in its different parts was\r\nput to various uses during following years till, in 1721, it was bought\r\nby the Crown. The King’s library was then taken there from Rue Vivienne,\r\nwhere it had been placed in 1666, and soon afterwards opened to the\r\npublic. The greater part of the building has been reconstructed in\r\nmodern times and enlarged. The blackened walls of a part of Mazarin’s\r\nmansion, that formed l’hôtel de Nivers, still stand at the corner of Rue\r\nColbert. The chief entrance to the Library is in Rue de Richelieu.\r\nEngravings, medals, works of art of many descriptions connected with\r\nletters may be seen at what has been successively Bibliothèque Royale,\r\nBibliothèque Impériale and is now Bibliothèque Nationale. The ceiling of\r\nthe Galerie Mazarin is covered with splendid frescoes by Romanelli. The\r\nheart of Voltaire is said to be encased in the statue we see there.\r\nMadame de Récamier died at the Library in 1849; she had taken refuge\r\nthere in the rooms of her niece, whose husband was one of the officials\r\nwhen the cholera broke out in l’Abbaye-aux-Bois. Opposite the Library,\r\non the Rue Richelieu side, is the Square Louvois dating from 1839, on\r\nthe site of two old _hôtels_ once there. There, in 1793, Citoyenne\r\nMontansier set up a theatre, known successively as Théâtre des Arts,\r\nThéâtre de la Loi and the Opéra.\r\n\r\nAfter the assassination of the duc de Berri in front of No. 3 Rue du\r\nRameau (February 13, 1820) as he was about to re-enter the Opera-House,\r\nLouis XVIII intended to build there a _chapelle expiatoire_. The\r\nRevolution of 1830 put an end to that project. The big poplar-tree, seen\r\nuntil recent years overlooking Rue Rameau, was planted as a tree of\r\nLiberty in 1848. It suddenly died in 1912. The fountain is the work of\r\nVisconti and Klagman (1844). In Rue Chabanais (1777) at No. 11,\r\nPichegru, betrayed by Leblanc, was arrested (1804). Proceeding down Rue\r\nde Richelieu we see grand old mansions throughout its entire length. No.\r\n71 formed part of the hôtel Louvois, given some four years before her\r\ntragic death to princesse de Lamballe who built roomy stables there. On\r\nthe site of No. 62, quite recently demolished, was the hôtel de Talaru,\r\nbuilt in 1652, which became one of the most noted prisons of the\r\nTerreur, and where its owner, the marquis de Talaru, was himself\r\nimprisoned. No. 75 was l’hôtel de Louis de Mornay, one of the most noted\r\nlovers of Ninon de Lenclos. No. 78, in the past a famous lace-shop, was\r\nowned by the East India Company. No. 93, once the immense hôtel Crozet,\r\nproperty of the ducs de Choiseul, cut through in 1780 by the making of\r\ntwo neighbouring streets, was inhabited in 1715 by Watteau. No. 102\r\nstands on the site of a house owned by Voltaire, inhabited at one time\r\nby his niece. No. 104, at first a private mansion, became successively\r\nTaverne Britannique (1845-52), Restaurant Richelieu, Union Club du\r\nBillard et du Sport. No. 101 was at one time the restaurant du Grand U,\r\nso called in 1883 from an article in “Le National” apropos of the _Union\r\nRepublicaine_.\r\n\r\nLeading out of Rue Richelieu, in the vicinity of the Bibliothèque\r\nNationale, we see old houses in Rue St-Augustin, and Rue des Filles de\r\nSt-Thomas, the latter cut short in more recent days by the Place de la\r\nBourse and the Rue du Quatre-Septembre. The busts on No. 7 of the latter\r\nstreet recall a theatrical costume store of past days. No. 21 Rue\r\nFeydeau was the site of the Théâtre des Nouveautés, which became the\r\nOpéra-Comique, demolished in 1830. Rue des Colonnes was in former days\r\nclosed at each end by gates. At No. 14 Rue St-Marc, Ernest Logouvé was\r\nborn, lived, died (1807-1903). La Malibran was born at No. 31.\r\n\r\nThe Bourse stands on the site of the convent of les Filles St-Thomas.\r\nIts cellars still exist beneath what was before 1914 the Restaurant\r\nChampeaux, Rue du 4 Septembre. The chapel stood till 1802 and was during\r\nthe Revolution the meeting-place of the reactionary section Le Peletier;\r\nthe insurgent troops defeated by Buonaparte on the steps of St-Roch had\r\nassembled there (1795) (_see_ p. 20).\r\n\r\nThe first stone of the present Bourse was laid in 1808. The building was\r\nenlarged in the early years of this century. The Paris Exchange\r\nstockbrokers had in early times met at the Pont-au-Change; during the\r\nRevolution they gathered in the chapelle des Petits-Pères; later at the\r\nPalais-Royal.\r\n\r\nThe fine old door of the hôtel Montmorency-Luxembourg still stands at\r\nthe entrance to the Passage des Panoramas, leading to the old galleries:\r\nGalerie Montmartre and Galerie des Variétés--opening out on Rue\r\nMontmartre and Rue Vivienne. Until after the Revolution there were no\r\nshops in Rue Vivienne, so full to-day of shops and business houses. It\r\nrecords the name of a certain sire Vivien, King’s secretary, owner of a\r\n_hôtel_ in the newly opened thoroughfare. Thierry lived there in 1834,\r\nAlphonse Karr in 1835. The great gates of the Bibliothèque Nationale on\r\nthis side are those which in bygone days closed the Place-Royale, now\r\nPlace des Vosges. No. 49 is the most ancient Frascati Dining Saloon with\r\nthe old ballroom candelabras. Many of the houses have interesting\r\nold-time vestiges.\r\n\r\nRue Notre-Dame-des-Victoires was until after 1633 le “Chemin-Herbu,” the\r\ngrass-grown road; Nos. 30, 28, 14, 13, 10, 4, 2 are ancient: other old\r\nhouses have been demolished. The Place-des-Victoires from which it\r\nstarts was the site of the fine hôtel de Pomponne, which later served as\r\nthe Banque de France. Most of the houses are ancient with interesting\r\narchitectural features.\r\n\r\nPlace des Petits-Pères close by is best known for the church there,\r\nNotre-Dame-des-Victoires, a name given to record the taking of La\r\nRochelle from the Protestants in 1627. Its first stone was laid by Louis\r\nXIII in 1629, but the church was not finished till more than a century\r\nlater. It was for long the convent chapel of the Augustins Déchaussés,\r\ncommonly known as the Petits-Pères, from the remarkably short stature of\r\nthe two monks, its founders. The Lady-chapel is a place of special\r\npilgrimage and is brimful of votive offerings. The church is never\r\nempty. Passers-by rarely fail to go in to say a prayer, or spend a quiet\r\nmoment there; work-girls from the shops and offices and workrooms of the\r\nneighbourhood go there in their dinner-hour for rest and shelter from\r\nthe streets. Services of thanksgiving after victory are naturally a\r\nspecial feature there. The choir has fine pictures by Van Loo. Rue des\r\nPetits-Pères dates from 1615 and shows interesting traces of past ages.\r\nRue d’Aboukir lies along the line of three seventeenth-century streets,\r\nin one of which Buonaparte lived for a time. Many old houses still stand\r\nthere; others of historical association have been demolished, modern\r\nbuildings erected on their site. Half-way down the street is Place du\r\nCaire, once the site of that most truly Parisian industry: carding and\r\nmattress-making and cleaning. French mattresses are, in normal times,\r\nturned inside out, cleaned or refilled very frequently.\r\n\r\nA hospital and a convent stretched along part of the _place_ and across\r\nPassage du Caire in past days. Several houses there are ancient, as also\r\nin Rue Alexandrie.\r\n\r\nIn Rue du Mail, at what is now hôtel de Metz, Buonaparte lodged in 1790.\r\nWe see many old houses. Spontini lived here, and No. 12 was inhabited by\r\nMadame Récamier and also by Talma. The modern Rue du Quatre-Septembre\r\nhas swept away many an interesting old thoroughfare. At No. 100 the\r\nPassage de la Cour des Miracles recalls the ancient _cour_ of the name,\r\ndone away with in 1656, of which some traces still remain--the scene in\r\nolden days of feats of apparent healing and of physical transformation\r\nwhereby the _truands_, persons of no avowed or avowable occupation,\r\ngained precarious _deniers_. Out of this long modern street we may turn\r\ninto many shorter ancient ones. Rue du Sentier, recalling by its name a\r\npathway through a wood--_sentier_, a corruption of _chantier_--has fine\r\nold houses and knew in its time many inhabitants of mark. At No. 8 lived\r\nMonsieur Lebrun, a famous picture dealer, husband of Madame Vigée\r\nLebrun. At No. 2 dwelt Madame de Staël, at Nos. 22-24, in rooms erewhile\r\ndecorated by Fragonard, Le Normand d’Étioles, husband of La Pompadour,\r\nafter his separation from her. No. 33 was the home of his wife in her\r\ngirlhood and at the time of her marriage. At No. 30 lived Sophie Gay.\r\n\r\nRue St-Joseph, so named from a seventeenth-century chapel knocked down\r\nin 1800, of which we find some traces, was previously Rue du\r\nTemps-Perdu; in the graveyard attached to St-Eustache--later a\r\nmarket--La Fontaine and Molière were buried, their ashes transferred in\r\n1818 to Père-Lachaise. At No. 10 Zola was born (1840). Rue du Croissant\r\n(seventeenth century) is a street of ancient houses and the chief\r\nnewspaper street of the city. Paper hawkers crowd there at certain\r\nhours each day, then rush away, vying with one another to call attention\r\nto their stock-in-trade. At No. 22, Café du Croissant, at the corner\r\nwhere this street meets the Rue Montmartre, journalists assemble, and\r\nthere the notable Socialist, Jaurès, was shot dead on the eve of the\r\noutbreak of war, July 31st, 1914. The sign at No. 18 is said to date\r\nfrom 1612. In Rue des Jeûneurs (1643)--the name a corruption from _des\r\nJeux-Neufs_--we see more ancient houses and leading out of it the old\r\nRue St-Fiacre, once Rue du Figuier. No. 19 was inhabited in recent years\r\nby a lady left a widow after one year’s married life, who, owner of the\r\nbuilding, dismissed the tenants of its six large flats and shut herself\r\nup in absolute solitude till her death at the age of eighty-nine. No. 23\r\nwas designed by Soufflot le Romain (1775). Rue Montmartre in its course\r\ncontinued from arrondissement I, which it leaves at Rue Étienne-Marcel,\r\nshows many interesting vestiges. At No. 178 we see a bas-relief of the\r\nPorte Montmartre of past days. Within the modern _Brasserie du Coq_, a\r\ncopy of the automatic cock of Strasbourg Cathedral, dating from 1352. On\r\nthe frontage of No. 121 a curious set of bells, and a quaint sign, “A la\r\ngrâce de Dieu,” dating from 1710. No. 118 was known in past days as the\r\nhouse of clocks. Thirty-two were seen on its frontage, the work of a\r\nSwiss clockmaker. Going up this old street in order to visit the streets\r\nleading out of it, we turn into Rue Tiquetonne, which recalls by its\r\naspect fourteenth-century times, by its name a prosperous baker of that\r\ncentury, a certain M. Rogier de Quinquentonne. Among the ancient houses\r\nthere, Nos. 4 and 2 have very deep cellars stretching beneath the\r\nstreet. In Rue Dussoubs, which under other names dates back to the\r\nfifteenth century, we see more quaint houses. At No. 26 Goldoni died.\r\nThe short street Marie-Stuart recalls the days when for one brief year\r\nthe beautiful Scotswoman was Queen Consort of France. The name of Rue\r\nJussienne is a corruption of Marie l’Égyptienne, patron saint of a\r\nfourteenth-century chapel which stood there till 1791. At No. 2 lived\r\nMadame Dubarry after the death of Louis XV. Rue d’Argout dates as Rue\r\ndes Vieux-Augustins from the thirteenth century. Here, at No. 28, lived\r\nin more modern times, Savalette de Langes, supposed for many years and\r\nproved at her death to be a man. In Passage du Vigan at No. 22, we find\r\nbas-reliefs in a courtyard. At No. 56, a small ancient _hôtel_.\r\n\r\nRue Bachaumont is on the site of the vanished Passage du Saumur, a\r\nmilliner’s quarter, the most ancient of Paris passages, demolished in\r\n1899. Rue d’Uzès crosses the site of the ancient hôtel d’Uzès. Rue de\r\nCléry was till 1634 an ancient roadway. Madame de Pompadour was born\r\nhere. Pierre Corneille and Casanava, the painter, lived here; and, where\r\nthe street meets Rue Beauregard, Baron Batz made his frantic attempt to\r\nsave Louis XVI on his way to the scaffold. No. 97, now a humble shop\r\nwith the sign “Au poète de 1793,” was the home of André Chenier. Nos.\r\n21-19 belonged to Robert Poquelin, the priest-brother of Molière, later\r\nto Pierre Lebrun, where in pre-Revolution days theatrical performances\r\nwere given, and the Mass said secretly during the Terror. Leading out of\r\nRue Cléry, we find Rue des Degrés, six mètres in length, the smallest\r\nstreet in Paris, a mere flight of steps.\r\n\r\nRue St-Sauveur (thirteenth century) memorizes the church once there.\r\nFrom end to end we see ancient houses, fine old balconies, curious\r\nsigns, architectural features of interest. In Rue des Petits-Carreaux,\r\nrunning on from this end of Rue Montorgueil (_see_ p. 40) we see at No.\r\n16 the house where, till recent days, musicians assembled for hire each\r\nSunday. Now they meet at the Café de la Chartreuse, 24, Boulevard\r\nSt-Denis. In a house in a court where the house No. 26 now stands, lived\r\nJean Dubarry. Rue Poissonnière, “Fishwives Street,” once “Champ des\r\nFemmes” (thirteenth century), shows us many ancient houses.\r\n\r\nRue Beauregard was so named in honour of the fine view Parisians had of\r\nold after mounting Rue Montorgueil. The notorious sorceress, Catherine\r\nMonvoisin--“la Voisin”--implicated in a thousand crimes, built for\r\nherself a luxurious habitation on this eminence--somewhat higher in\r\nthose days than in later years. We find several ancient houses along\r\nthis old street, notably No. 46. We see ancient houses also in Rue de la\r\nLune (1630). No. 1 is a shop still famed for its _brioches du soleil_.\r\nBetween these two streets stretched in olden days the graveyard of\r\nNotre-Dame de Bonne-Nouvelle, a church built in 1624 on the site of the\r\nancient chapel Ste-Barbe. The name is said to refer to a piece of good\r\nnews told to Anne d’Autriche one day as she passed that way. The tower\r\nonly of the seventeenth-century church remains; the rest was rebuilt in\r\n1823. Four short streets of ancient date cross Rue de la Lune: Rue\r\nNotre-Dame de Bonne-Nouvelle (eighteenth century), Rue Thorel (sixteenth\r\ncentury), the old Rue Ste-Barbe, Rue de la Ville-Neuve, Rue Notre-Dame\r\nde la Recouvrance--with old houses of interest in each. At No. 8 Rue de\r\nla Ville-Neuve we see _médaillons_ of Jean Goujon and Philibert\r\nDelorme.\r\n\r\nSurrounded by old streets, just off the boulevard des Italiens, is the\r\nOpéra-Comique, originally a Salle de Spectacles, built on the park-lands\r\nof their fine mansion by the duke and duchess de Choiseul, who reserved\r\nfor themselves and their heirs for ever the right to a _loge_ of eight\r\nseats next to the royal box. Its name, at first, Salle Favart, has\r\nchanged many times. Burnt down twice, in 1838 and 1887, the present\r\nbuilding dates only from 1898. Rue Favart, named after the\r\neighteenth-century actor, has always been inhabited by actors and\r\nactresses. Rue de Grammont dates from 1726, built across the site of the\r\nfine old hôtel de Grammont. Rue de Choiseul, alongside the recently\r\nerected Crédit Lyonnais, which has replaced several ancient mansions,\r\nrecalls the existence of another hôtel de Choiseul. At No. 21 we find\r\ncurious old attics. Passing through the short Rue de Hanovre, we find in\r\nRue de la Michodière, opened in 1778, on the grounds of hôtel Conti, the\r\nhouse (No. 8) where Gericault, the painter, lived in 1808, and at No.\r\n19, the home of Casabianca, member of the Convention where Buonaparte,\r\nat one time, lodged. At No. 3, Rue d’Antin, then a private mansion,\r\nBuonaparte married Joséphine (9 March, 1796). Though serving as a\r\nbanker’s office, the room where the marriage took place is kept exactly\r\nas it then was. In a house in Rue Louis-le-Grand, opened in 1701, known\r\nin Revolution days as Rue des Piques, Sophie Arnould was born. Rue\r\nDaunou, where at No. 1 we see an ancient escutcheon, leads us into the\r\nRue de la Paix, opened in 1806 on the site of the ancient convent of the\r\nCapucines and called at first Rue Napoléon. All its fine houses are\r\nmodern, as are also those of Rue Volney and Rue des Capucines, on the\r\neven number side. In the latter street, formed in the year 1700, the\r\nCrédit Foncier is the old hôtel de Castanier, director of the East India\r\nCompany (1726), and the hôtel Devieux of the same date. Nos. 11, 9, 7, 5\r\n(fine vestiges at No. 5) were the stables of the duchesse d’Orléans in\r\n1730.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nROUND ABOUT THE ARTS ET MÉTIERS (THE ARTS AND CRAFTS INSTITUTION)\r\n\r\n\r\nARRONDISSEMENT III. (TEMPLE)\r\n\r\nA long stretch of the busy boulevard Sébastopol forms the boundary\r\nbetween arrondissements II and III. Several short old streets run\r\nbetween the Boulevard and Rue St-Martin. Rue Apolline (eighteenth\r\ncentury), Rue Blondel, Rue Notre-Dame de Nazareth, where curiously\r\nenough is a Jewish synagogue, show us some ancient houses. The latter,\r\nin the fifteenth century a roadway, in the seventeenth century a street\r\nalong the course of a big drain, memorizes the convent once there. We\r\nfind vestiges of an ancient _hôtel_ at No. 6, and close by old passages:\r\nPassage du Vertbois, Passage des Quatre-Voleurs, Passage du\r\nPont-aux-Biches. In Rue Papin we find the théâtre de la Gaîté, first set\r\nup at the Fair St-Laurent in the seventeenth century, here since 1861,\r\nwhen it was known as théâtre du Prince Impérial. Crossing Rue Turbigo,\r\nwe reach Rue Bourg l’Abbé, reminding us of a very ancient street of the\r\nname swept away by the boulevard Sébastopol, and Rue aux Ours, dating\r\nfrom 1300, originally Rue aux Oies, referring maybe to geese roasted for\r\nthe table when this was a street of turnspits. On the odd number side\r\nsome ancient houses still stand. Rue Quincampoix, beginning far down in\r\nthe 4th arrondissement, runs to its end into Rue aux Ours. It is\r\nthrough its whole course a street of old-time associations. In this bit\r\nof it we find interesting old houses, arched doorways, sculptured doors,\r\netc., at Nos. 111, 99, 98, 96, 92, 91, 90. At No. 91 the watchman’s bell\r\nrang to bid the crowds disperse that pressed tumultuously round the\r\noffices of the great financier Law, who first set up his bank at the\r\nhôtel de Beaufort, on the site of the house No. 65. The Salle Molière\r\nwas at No. 82, through the Passage Molière, dating from Revolution days,\r\nwhen it was known as Passage des Nourrices. The Salle began as the\r\nthéâtre des Sans-Culottes, to become later the théâtre École. There\r\nRachel made her debut. Many traces of the old theatre are still seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUE QUINCAMPOIX]\r\n\r\nThe old Roman road Rue St-Martin coming northward through the 4th\r\narrondissement enters the 3rd from Rue Rambuteau. Along its entire\r\ncourse it is rich in old-world vestiges: ancient mansions, old signs,\r\nvenerable sculptures, bas-reliefs, etc. In the Passage de l’Ancre,\r\nopening at No. 223, the first office for cab-hiring was opened in 1637.\r\nAt No. 254 we come to the old church St-Nicolas-des-Champs, originally a\r\nchapel in the fields forming part of the abbey lands of\r\nSt-Martin-des-Champs, subsequently the parish church of the district,\r\nrebuilt at the beginning of the fifteenth century, enlarged towards the\r\nend of the sixteenth century--a beautiful edifice in Gothic style of two\r\ndifferent periods and known as the church of a hundred columns. The\r\nsacristy, once the presbytery, and a sundial dating from 1666, front the\r\nold Rue Cunin-Gridaine. Crossing Rue Réaumur, we reach the fine old\r\nabbey buildings which since the Revolution have served as the Paris Arts\r\nand Crafts Institution. The Abbey was built on the spot beyond the Paris\r\nboundary where St. Martin, on his way to the city, is said to have\r\nhealed a leper. The invading Normans knocked it down; it was rebuilt in\r\n1056 and the Abbey grounds surrounded a few years afterwards by high\r\nwalls, rebuilt later as strong fortifications with eighteen turrets.\r\nPart of those walls and a restored tower are seen at No. 7 Rue Bailly.\r\nWithin the walls were the Abbey chapel, long, beautiful cloisters, a\r\nprison, a market, etc. In the fourteenth century the Abbey was included\r\nwithin the city bounds and the monks held their own till 1790. In 1798,\r\nthe disaffected Abbey buildings were chosen wherein to place the models\r\ncollected by Vaucanson--pioneer of machinists; other collections were\r\nadded and in the century following various changes and additions made in\r\nthe old Abbey structure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST-NICOLAS-DES-CHAMPS]\r\n\r\nThe big door giving on Rue St-Martin dates only from 1850. The great\r\nflight of steps in the court, built first in 1786, was remodelled and\r\nmodernized in 1860. The ancient cloisters, remodelled, have been for\r\nyears past the scene of busy mechanical and industrial study. The\r\nancient and beautiful refectory, the work of Pierre de Montereau,\r\narchitect of the Sainte-Chapelle (_see_ p. 48) has become the Library.\r\nBeneath the fine vaulted roof, amid tall, slender columns of exquisite\r\nworkmanship, students read where monks of old took their meals. The old\r\nAbbey chapel (twelfth and thirteenth centuries) restored in the\r\nnineteenth century, serves as the depot for models of steam-engines,\r\netc. A small Gothic chapel is in the hands of a gas company. Other\r\nvenerable portions of the Abbey, fallen into ruin, have quite recently\r\nbeen removed.\r\n\r\nRue Vertbois, on the northern side of the institution, records the\r\nexistence of a leafy wood in the old Abbey grounds. The tower dates from\r\n1140, the fountain from 1712; both were restored at the end of the\r\nnineteenth century. Going on up this old street we find numerous traces\r\nof what were erewhile the Abbey precincts.\r\n\r\nPorte St-Martin at the angle where the _rue_ meets the _boulevard_ is\r\nthat last of three great _portes_ moving northward, and each in its time\r\nmarking the city boundary.\r\n\r\nRue Meslay, opening out of Rue St-Martin at this point, dates from the\r\nfirst years of the eighteenth century, when it was Rue du Rempart. No.\r\n49 was the home of the last Commandant du Guet. At No. 46 Aurore Dupin,\r\nknown as George Sand, the famous novelist, was born in 1804. At No. 40\r\nwe see the fine old _hôtel_, with a fountain in the court, where in\r\neighteenth-century days dwelt the Commandant de la Garde de Paris, the\r\n_garde_ having replaced the _guet_ (the Watch) in 1771.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUE BEAUBOURG]\r\n\r\nRue Beaubourg, stretching from Rue Rambuteau to Rue Turbigo, and the\r\nstreets and passages leading out of it, show us many traces of bygone\r\ntimes. At No. 28 we find subterranean halls, with hooks where iron\r\nchains were once held fast--for this was an ancient prison--and a salon\r\nLouis XVI, with traces of ancient frescoes and sculpture. The city wall\r\nof Philippe-Auguste passed where the house No. 39 now stands. At No. 62,\r\nopposite which stretched the graveyard of St-Nicolas-des-Champs, was the\r\npalace of the bishops of Châlons, taken later to form part of a\r\nCarmelite convent suppressed in 1793. In a later revolutionary\r\nperiod--when Louis-Philippe was on the throne of France--the Paris\r\ninsurrections centred here and horrible scenes took place on this\r\nspot[B].\r\n\r\nIn Rue au Maire, a secular official, mayor or bailiff of the Abbey, had\r\nhis seat of office. In the Passage des Marmites (Saucepan Street) dwelt\r\nnone but _chaudronniers_ (coppersmiths and tinkers). We see ancient\r\nhouses all along Rue Volta, and Rue des Vertus, so called by derision,\r\nhaving been the Rue des Vices, is made up of quaint old houses. Most of\r\nthe houses, rather sordid, in Rue des Gravilliers, are ancient. No. 44\r\nis said to have been the meeting-place of the secret Society\r\n“l’Internationale” in the time of Napoléon III. At Nos. 69 and 70 we see\r\ntraces of the _hôtel_ built by the grandfather of Gabrielle d’Estrées.\r\nAt No. 88 the accomplices of Cadoudal, of the infernal machine\r\nconspiracy, were arrested.\r\n\r\nRue Chapon, formerly Capon, is named from the Capo, i.e. the cape worn\r\nby the Jews who in thirteenth-century days were its chief inhabitants.\r\nIts western end, known till 1851 as Rue du Cimetière St-Nicolas-des-Champs,\r\nshows many vestiges of past time. No. 16 was the _hôtel_ of Madame de\r\nMandeville, at first a nun-novice, to become in the time of Louis XV\r\na celebrated courtesan. No. 13 was the _hôtel_ of the archbishops of\r\nReims, then of the bishops of Châlons, ceded in 1619 to the Carmelites.\r\nA big door and other interesting vestiges remain.\r\n\r\nRue de Montmorency is named from the fine old _hôtel_ at No. 5, where\r\nthe Montmorency lived from 1215 to 1627, when the last descendant of the\r\nfamous Constable Mathieu perished on the scaffold. The street is rich\r\nin historic houses, historic associations. The stretch between Rue\r\nBeaubourg and Rue du Temple was known till 1768 as Rue Courtauvillain,\r\noriginally Cour-au-Vilains--the Vilains, not necessarily “villains,”\r\nwere the serfs or “common people” of bygone days. There lived Madame de\r\nSévigné before making hôtel Carnavalet her home. No. 51 is the Maison du\r\nGrand Pignon, the big gable, owned, about the year 1407, by Nicolas\r\nFlamel and his wife Pernelle. Nicolas was a reputed schoolmaster of the\r\nage who made a good thing out of his establishment and was cited as\r\nhaving discovered the philosopher’s stone. On his death, he bequeathed\r\nhis house and all his goods to the church St-Jacques-la-Boucherie, of\r\nwhich la Tour St-Jacques alone remains (_see_ pp. 95, 97).\r\n\r\nRue Grenier-St-Lazare, in the thirteenth century Rue Garnier de\r\nSt-Ladre, shows us interesting old houses, and at No. 4 a Louis XVI\r\nstaircase.\r\n\r\nRue Michel-le-Comte, another street of ancient houses, erewhile _hôtels_\r\nof the _noblesse_, reminds one of the popular punning phrase, “_Ça fait\r\nla Rue Michel_,” i.e. _ça fait le compte_--Michel-le-Comte. No. 28 was\r\nat one time inhabited by comte Esterhazy, Hungarian Ambassador. Impasse\r\nde Clairvaux, Rue du Maure (fourteenth century, known at one time as\r\nCour des Anglais), and Rue Brantôme make a cluster of ancient streets,\r\nwith many vestiges of past ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE TEMPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nOF the renowned citadel and domain of mediæval times, from which the\r\narrondissement takes its name, nothing now remains. A modern square\r\n(1865) has been arranged on the site of the mansion and the gardens of\r\nthe Grand Prieur, but the surrounding streets, several stretching where\r\nthe Temple once stood and across the site of its extensive grounds, show\r\nus historic houses, historic vestiges and associations along their\r\nentire course.\r\n\r\nThe Knights-Templar settled in Paris in 1148. Their domain with its\r\ndungeon, built in 1212, its manor and fortified tower, and the vast\r\nsurrounding grounds, were seized in 1307 and given over to the knights\r\nof St. John of Jerusalem, known later as the knights of Malta. From that\r\ntime to the Revolution the Temple was closely connected with the life of\r\nthe city. The primitive buildings were demolished, streets built along\r\nthe site of some of them in the seventeenth century, and an immense\r\nbattlemented castle with towers and a strong prison erected where the\r\noriginal stronghold had stood. The Temple, as then built, was like the\r\nold abbeys and royal palaces: a sort of township, having within its\r\nenclosures all that was needful for the daily life of its inhabitants.\r\nBesides Louis XVI and his family many persons of note passed weary days\r\nin its prison. Sidney Smith effected his escape therefrom. Its\r\nencircling walls were razed in the first years of the nineteenth\r\ncentury; and in 1808 Napoléon had the great tower knocked down. In 1814\r\nthe Allies made the Grand Priory their headquarters. Louis XVIII gave\r\nover the mansion to an Order of Benedictine nuns. In 1848 it served as a\r\nbarracks. Its end came in 1854, when it was razed to the ground. Then a\r\nbig _place_ and market hall were set up on the site of the old Temple\r\nchapel and its adjacent buildings--a famous market, given up in great\r\npart to dealers in second-hand goods--the chief Paris market of\r\n_occasions_ (bargains). The Rotonde which had been erected in 1781 was\r\nallowed to stand and lasted till 1863. A new ironwork hall, built in\r\n1855, was not demolished till recent years--1905.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LA PORTE DU TEMPLE]\r\n\r\nThose pretty, gay knick-knacks, that glittering cheap jewellery known\r\nthroughout the world as “articles de Paris” had their origin among a\r\nspecial class of the inhabitants of the old Temple grounds. No one\r\nliving there paid taxes. Impecunious persons of varying rank sought\r\nasylum there--a society made up in great part of artists and\r\nartistically-minded artisans. To gain their daily bread they set their\r\nwits and their fingers to work and soon found a ready sale for their\r\nBrummagem--not mere Brummagem, however, and all of truly Parisian\r\ndelicacy of conception and workmanship.\r\n\r\nStarting up Rue du Temple, from Rue Rambuteau, this part of it before\r\n1851 Rue Ste-Avoie, we come upon the passage Ste-Avoie, and the entrance\r\nto the demolished _hôtel_, once that of Constable Anne de Montmorency,\r\nlater, for a time, the Law’s famous bank. At No. 71 we see l’hôtel de\r\nSt-Aignan, built in 1660, used in 1812 as a _mairie_, with fine doors\r\nand Corinthian pilastres in the court. No. 79 was l’hôtel de Montmort\r\n(1650). No. 86 is on the site of a famous cabaret of the days of Louis\r\nXII. At Nos. 101-103 we see vestiges of l’hôtel de Montmorency. No. 113\r\nwas the dependency of a Carmelite convent. At No. 122 Balzac lived in\r\n1882. At No. 153 was the eighteenth-century _bureau des\r\nVinaigrettes_--Sedan-chairs on wheels. The great door of the Temple,\r\ndemolished in 1810, stood opposite No. 183. Vestiges were found in\r\nrecent years beneath the pavement. At No. 195, within the Église\r\nSte-Elisabeth, originally the convent chapel of the Filles de\r\nSte-Elisabeth (1614-1690), we see most beautiful woodwork. Rue Turbigo\r\ncut right through the ancient presbytère.\r\n\r\nTurning back down this old street to visit the streets leading out of\r\nit, we find Rue Dupetit-Thouars, on the site of old _hôtels_ within the\r\nTemple grounds. Rue de la Corderie, where the Communards met in 1871.\r\nRue des Fontaines (fifteenth century), with at No. 7 the ancient\r\nhôtellerie du Grand Cerf: at No. 15 the _hôtel_ owned by the Superior of\r\nthe convent of the Madelonnettes--a house of Mercy--suppressed at the\r\nRevolution, used as a political prison, later as a woman’s prison. Rue\r\nPerrée, where a shadowy Temple market is still to be seen, runs through\r\nthe ancient Temple grounds.\r\n\r\nRue de Bretagne stretches from the Rue de Réaumur at the corner of the\r\nTemple Square, in old days known in its course through the Temple\r\nproperty as Rue de Bourgogne, farther on as Rue de Saintonge; leading\r\nout of it, at No. 62, the short Rue de Caffarelli runs along the line of\r\nthe eastern wall of the vanished Temple fortress; at No. 45 is the Rue\r\nde Beauce where we come upon the ancient private passage, Rue des\r\nOiseaux, with its _vacherie_ of the old hospice des Enfants-Rouges. At\r\nNo. 48 opens the ancient Rue du Beaujolais-du-Temple, renamed Rue de\r\nPicardie. At No. 41 we find the Marché des Enfants-Rouges, a picturesque\r\nold-time market hall with an ancient well in the courtyard. Rue\r\nPortefoin, thirteenth century. Rue Pastourelle, of the same epoch where\r\nat No. 23 lived the _culottier_, Biard, who wrote the Revolutionary\r\nsong: la Carmagnole. Rue des Haudriettes, known in past days as Rue de\r\nl’Échelle-du-Temple, for there at its farther end was the Temple pillory\r\nand a tall ladder reaching to its summit. The name _Haudriette_ is that\r\nof the order of nuns founded by Jean Haudri, secretary to Louis IX, who,\r\ngiven up by his wife as lost while travelling in the East, returned at\r\nlength to find her living among a community of widows to whom she had\r\nmade over her home. Haudri maintained the institution thus founded,\r\nwhich was removed later to a mansion, now razed, near the chapel of the\r\nAssumption, in Rue St-Honoré. Rue de Brague, until 1348 Rue\r\nBoucherie-du-Temple, the Templars meat market. The fine old _hôtel_ at\r\nNos. 4 and 6 has ceilings painted by Lebrun. All these streets are rich\r\nin old-time houses, old-time vestiges, and they are all, as is the whole\r\nof this arrondissement on this side Rue du Temple as far as Rue de\r\nTurenne, in the Marais, a name referring to the marshy nature of the\r\ndistrict in long-past days--but which was for long in pre-Revolution\r\ntimes the most aristocratic quarter of the city. We find ourselves now\r\nbefore the Archives and the Imprimerie Nationale, the latter to be\r\ntransferred to its new quarters Rue de la Convention. The frontage of\r\nthis fine old building and its entrance gates give on the Rue des\r\nFrancs-Bourgeois, of which more anon (_see_ p. 84). On the western side\r\nwe see a thick high wall and the Gothic doorway of what was, in the\r\nfourteenth century, the Paris dwelling of the redoubtable Constable,\r\nOlivier de Clisson, subsequently for nearly two hundred years in the\r\nhands of the Guise. In 1687 it was rebuilt for the Princess de Soubise\r\nby the architect, Delamair. Pillaged during the Revolution, it became\r\nnational property, and in 1808 the Archives were placed there by\r\nNapoléon. Frescoes, fine old woodwork, magnificent mouldings,\r\narchitectural work of great beauty are there to be seen. The Duke of\r\nClarence is said to have made the hôtel Clisson his abode during the\r\nEnglish occupation under Henry V. Going up Rue des Archives we see at\r\nNo. 53, dating from 1705, the _hôtel_ built there by the Prince de\r\nRohan, and onward up the street fine old mansions, once the homes of men\r\nand women of historic name and fame. No. 72 is said to have been the\r\n“Archives” in the time of Louis XIII. An eighteenth-century fountain is\r\nseen in the yard behind the stationer’s shop there. No. 78 was the\r\n_hôtel_ of Maréchal de Tallard. No. 79 dates from Louis XIII. At No. 90\r\nwe see traces of the old chapel of the Orphanage des Enfants-Rouges, so\r\ncalled from the colour of the children’s uniform. The eastern side of\r\nthe Imprimerie Nationale adjoining the Archives, built by Delamair, as\r\nthe hôtel de Strasbourg, and commonly known as hôtel de Rohan, because\r\nfour comtes de Rohan were successively bishops of Strasbourg, is\r\nbounded by Rue Vieille-du-Temple, that too along its whole course a\r\nsequence of old houses bearing witness to past grandeur. No. 54 is the\r\npicturesque house and turret built in 1528 by Jean de la Balue,\r\nsecretary to the duc d’Orléans. No. 56 was once the abode of Loys de\r\nVilliers of the household of Isabeau de Bavière. No. 75 was the town\r\nhouse of the family de la Tour-du-Pin-Gouvernet (1720). On the walls of\r\nNo. 80 we read the old inscription “Vieille rue du Temple.” No. 102 was\r\nthe hôtel de Caumartin, later d’Epernon. Nos. 106 and 110 were\r\ndependencies of the hôtel d’Epernon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORTE DE CLISSON\r\n\r\n(Archives)]\r\n\r\nRue des Quatre-Fils on the north side of the Archives and its adjoining\r\nbuildings, known in past times as Rue de l’Échelle-du-Temple, recalls to\r\nmind the romantic adventures of four sons of a certain Aymon, sung by a\r\nthirteenth-century troubadour. Most of its houses are ancient. Leading\r\nout of it is the old Rue Charlot with numerous seventeenth-century and\r\neighteenth-century houses or vestiges. We peep into the Ruelle Sourdis,\r\na gutter running down the middle of it, once shut in by iron gates and\r\nboundary stones. At No. 5 we see what remains of the hôtel Sourdis,\r\nwhich in 1650 belonged to Cardinal Retz. The church St-Jean-St-François,\r\nopposite, is the ancient chapel of the convent St-François-des-Capucins\r\ndu Marais. It replaced the old church St-Jean-en-Grève, destroyed at the\r\nRevolution, and here we see, surrounding the nave, painted copies of\r\nancient tapestries telling the story of the miracle of the sacred Hostie\r\nwhich a Jew in mockery sought to destroy by burning. The fête of\r\nReparation kept from the fourteenth century at the church of St-Jean and\r\nat the chapel les Billettes (_see_ p. 107) has since 1867 been kept\r\nhere. Here too, piously preserved, is the chasuble used by the Abbé\r\nEdgeworth at the last Mass heard before his execution by Louis XVI in\r\nthe Temple prison hard by. In the short Rue du Perche behind the church,\r\nlived for a time at No. 7 _bis_ Scarron’s young widow, destined to\r\nbecome Madame de Maintenon. Fine frescoes cover several of its ceilings.\r\nIn Rue de Poitou we find more interesting old houses. In Rue de\r\nNormandie Nos. 10, 6, 9 show interesting features, old courtyards, etc.\r\nTurning from Rue Charlot into Rue Béranger, known until 1864 by the name\r\nof the Grand Prior of the Temple de Vendôme, we find the hôtel de\r\nVendôme, Nos. 5 and 3, dating from 1752 where Béranger lived and died.\r\nAt No. 11, now a business house, lived Berthier de Sauvigny,\r\nIntendant-Général de Paris in 1789, hung on a lamp-post after the taking\r\nof the Bastille, one of the first victims of the Revolution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUELLE DE SOURDIS]\r\n\r\nRunning parallel to Rue Charlot, starting from the little Rue du Perche,\r\nRue Saintonge, formed by joining two seventeenth-century streets, Rue\r\nPoitou and Rue Touraine, shows us a series of ancient dwellings. From\r\nOctober, 1789, to 15th July, 1791, Robespierre lived at No. 64. A fine\r\ncolumned entrance court at No. 5 has been supplanted by a brand-new\r\nedifice. The _hôtel_ at No. 4, dating originally from about 1611, was\r\nrebuilt in 1745.\r\n\r\nRue de Turenne, running in this arrondissement from Rue Charlot to the\r\ncorner of the Place des Vosges, began as Rue Louis, then in its upper\r\npart was Rue Boucherat, as an ancient inscription at No. 133 near the\r\nfountain Boucherat records. From the old street whence it starts, Rue\r\nSt.-Antoine in the 4th arrondissement, it is a long line of ancient\r\n_hôtels_, the homes in bygone days of men of notable names and doings;\r\none side of the convent des Filles-du-Calvaire stretched between the Rue\r\ndes Filles-du-Calvaire and Rue Pont-au-Choux. No. 76 was the home of the\r\nlast governor of the Bastille, Monsieur de Launay. The church of\r\nSt-Denis-du-St-Sacrament at No. 70 was built in 1835 on the site of the\r\nchapel of a convent razed in 1826, previously a mansion of Maréchal de\r\nTurenne. At No. 56, Scarron lived and died. No. 54 was the abode of the\r\ncomte de Montrésor, noted in the wars of the Fronde. At No. 41, fresh\r\nwater flows from the fontaine de Joyeuse on the site of the ancient\r\nhôtel de Joyeuse. We find a beautiful staircase in almost every one of\r\nthese old _hôtels_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HÔTEL VENDÔME, RUE BÉRANGER]\r\n\r\nShorter interesting old streets lead out of this long one on each side.\r\n\r\nRue du Parc-Royal, memorizes the park and palace of Les Tournelles,\r\nrazed to the ground after the tragic death of Henri II by his widow,\r\nCatherine de’ Medici (_see_ p. 8). No. 4, dating from 1620, was\r\ninhabited by successive illustrious families until the early years of\r\nthe nineteenth century. There, till recently, was seen a wonderful\r\ncarved wood staircase. Many of the ancient houses erewhile here have\r\nbeen demolished in recent years, and are supplanted by modern buildings\r\nand a garden-square.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE HOME OF MADAME DE SÉVIGNÉ\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are now in the vicinity of that most entrancing of historic museums,\r\nMusée Carnavalet, and its neighbouring library. On the wall of Rue de\r\nSévigné is still to be read engraved in the stonework its more ancient\r\nname, Rue de la Culture-Ste-Catherine, so called because it ran across\r\ncultivated land in the vicinity of an ancient church dedicated to St.\r\nCatherine. It was in 1677 that Madame de Sévigné and her daughter,\r\nMadame de Grignan, settled in the first story of the house No. 23, built\r\nsome hundred and thirty years before by Jacques de Ligneri under the\r\ndirection of the renowned architect Pierre Lescot and the sculptor Jean\r\nGoujon. The widow of a Breton lord, Kernevenoy, or some such word by\r\nname, which resolved itself into Carnavalet, bought the _hôtel_ from the\r\nLigneri; inhabitants and owners changed as time went on, but this name\r\nremained. At the Revolution, the mansion was taken possession of by the\r\nState, was used for a school, to become after 1871 the historical Museum\r\nof Paris. In 1898 the museum was taken in hand by M. Georges Cain and\r\nfrom that day to this has been continually added to, made more and more\r\nvaluable and attractive by this eminently capable administrator. To\r\nstudy the history, and learn “from the life” the story of Paris and of\r\nFrance, go to the Musée Carnavalet. And to read about all you see\r\nthere, turn at No. 29 into the Bibliothèque de la Ville. In olden days\r\nle Petit Arsenal de la Ville stood on the site. The edifice we see,\r\nl’hôtel St-Fargeau, was built in 1687. The city library, which had been\r\nre-organized by Jules Cousin, was placed there in 1898.\r\n\r\nRue Payenne runs across the site of ancient houses and of part of two\r\nconvents, a door of one is seen at that regrettably modern-style\r\nerection, so out of keeping with its surroundings, the Lycée\r\nVictor-Hugo. At No. 5 we see a bust of Auguste Compte, with an\r\ninscription, for this was the “Temple of the religion of Humanity,” and\r\nCompte’s friend and inspirer Clotilde de Vaux died here. Here souvenirs\r\nof the philosopher are kept in a memorial chapel. Nos. 11 and 13 formed\r\nthe mansion of the duc de Lude, one of the most noted admirers of Madame\r\nde Sévigné, Grand Maître d’Artillerie in 1675, and was inhabited at one\r\ntime by Madame Scarron. In Rue Elzévir--in the sixteenth century Rue des\r\nTrois-Pavillons--was born Marion Delorme (1613). Ninon de Lenclos lived\r\nhere in 1642. We see a fine old house at No. 8, and at No. 2 l’hôtel de\r\nLusignan. Leading out of Rue Elzévir, the old Rue Barbette records the\r\nname of a master of the Mint under Philippe-le-Bel, and a house he built\r\nwith extensive gardens, known as the Courtille Barbette; the Courtille\r\nwas destroyed by the populace, displeased at a change in the coinage, in\r\n1306; the house remained and became a rendezvous of courtiers, passed\r\ninto the hands of the extremely light-lived Isabeau de Bavière, who\r\ninaugurated there her wonderful _bals masqués_. It was on leaving the\r\nhôtel Barbette that the duc d’Orléans, Isabeau’s lover, was\r\nassassinated, on the threshold of a neighbouring house, by the men of\r\nJean Sans Peur, 23 November, 1407 (_see_ p. 40). The mansion passed\r\nsubsequently through many hands, and was finally in part demolished in\r\n1563, and this street cut across the ground where it had stood. No. 8\r\nwas the “petit hôtel” of Maréchal d’Estrées, brother of Gabrielle,\r\nconfiscated at the Revolution and made later the mother-house of the\r\nInstitution “la Legion d’Honneur” for the education of officer’s\r\ndaughters. The grand old mansion has been despoiled of its splendid\r\ndecorations, precious woodwork, etc.--all sold peacemeal for high\r\nprices. Almost every house in this old street is an ancient _hôtel_. No.\r\n14 was the hôtel Bigot de Chorelle, No. 16 the hôtel de Choisy, No. 18\r\nthe hôtel Massu, No. 17 the hôtel de Brégis, etc. We see other ancient\r\nhouses in Rue de la Perle. At No. 1, dating from the close of the\r\nseventeenth century, we find wonderfully interesting things in the\r\ncourtyard; busts of old Romans, fine bas-reliefs, etc.\r\n\r\nRue de Thorigny, sixteenth century, was named after Président Lambert de\r\nThorigny, whose descendants built, a century or two later, the fine\r\nhôtel Lambert on l’Ile St-Louis. Marion died in a house in this street;\r\nMadame de Sévigné lived here at one time, as did Balzac in 1814. The\r\nfine _hôtel_ at No. 5 goes by the name hôtel Salé, because its owner,\r\nAubert de Fontenay, had grown rich through the Gabelle (salt-tax). Later\r\nit was the abode of Monseigneur Juigné, Archbishop of Paris, who in the\r\nterrible winter 1788-89 gave all he possessed to assuage the misery of\r\nthe people, yet met his death by stoning on the outbreak of the\r\nRevolution. Confiscated by the State, the fine old mansion was for a\r\ntime put to various uses; then bought and its beauties reverently\r\nguarded by its present owners. Rue Debelleyme, made up of four short\r\nancient streets, shows interesting vestiges. The nineteenth-century\r\nnovelist, Eugène Sue, lived here.\r\n\r\nTo the east of Rue de Turenne, at its junction with Rue des\r\nFrancs-Bourgeois, we find old streets across the site of the ancient\r\npalace des Tournelles; of the palace no trace remains save the name of\r\nthe old Rue des Tournelles. Rue du Foin runs where hay was once made in\r\nthe fields of the palace park. Rue de Béarn was in olden times Rue du\r\nParc-Royal. Here we find vestiges of the convent des Minimes, founded by\r\nMarie de’ Medici in 1611, suppressed in 1790. Some of its walls form\r\npart of the barracks we see there, and the cloister still stands intact\r\nin the courtyard, while at No. 10, Rue des Minimes, may be seen the old\r\nconvent door. The building No. 7 of this latter street, now a school,\r\ndates from the seventeenth century. A famous chestnut-tree, several\r\nhundred years old, flourished in the court at No. 14 till a few years\r\nago. In Rue St-Gilles, we see among other ancient houses the Pavilion of\r\nthe hôtel Morangis, No. 22, and at No. 12, the Cour de Venise. In Rue\r\nVillehardouin, when it was Rue des Douze Portes, to which Rue St-Pierre\r\nwas joined at its change of name, lived Scarron and his young wife. Rue\r\ndes Tournelles with its strikingly old-world aspect shows us two houses\r\ninhabited by Ninon de Lenclos, Nos. 56 and 26, and at No. 58, that of\r\nLocré, who with some other men of law drew up the famous Code Napoléon.\r\n\r\nAt No. 1, Rue St-Claude, one side of the house in Rue des Arquebusiers,\r\ndwelt the notorious sorcerer, Joseph Balsamo, known as comte de\r\nCagliostro. The iron balustrade dates from his day and the heavy\r\nhandsome doors came from the ancient Temple buildings. Rue Pont-au-Choux\r\nrecalls the days when the land was a stretch of market gardens. Rue\r\nFroissard and Rue de Commines lie on the site of the razed couvent des\r\nFilles-du-Calvaire, of which vestiges are to be seen on the boulevard at\r\nNo. 13.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nNOTRE-DAME\r\n\r\n\r\nARRONDISSEMENT IV. (HÔTEL-DE-VILLE)\r\n\r\nRue Lutèce, the French form of the Roman word Lutetia, recording the\r\nancient name of the city, is a modern street on ancient historic ground.\r\nThere, on the river island, the first settlers pitched their camp,\r\nreared their rude dwellings, laid the foundation of the city of mud to\r\nbecome in future days the city of light, the brilliant Ville Lumière.\r\nWhen the conquering Romans took possession of the primitive city and\r\nbuilt there its first palace, the island of the Seine became l’Île du\r\nPalais.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NOTRE-DAME]\r\n\r\nOf the buildings erected there through succeeding centuries, few traces\r\nnow remain. But Roman walls in perfect condition were discovered beneath\r\nthe surface of the island so recently as 1906. Close to the site of Rue\r\nLutèce ran, until the middle of last century, the ancient Rue des Fèves,\r\nwhere was the famous Taverne de la Pomme de Pin, a favourite\r\nmeeting-place from the time of Molière of great men of letters. Crossing\r\nRue de la Cité, formed in 1834 along the line of the old Rue St-Éloi\r\nwhich stretched where Degobert’s great statesman had founded the abbey\r\nSt-Martial, we come to the Parvis Notre-Dame. The Parvis, so wide and\r\nopen to-day, was until very recent times--well into the second half of\r\nthe nineteenth century--crowded with buildings; old shops, old streets,\r\nerections connected with the old Hôtel-Dieu, covered in great part the\r\nspace before the Cathedral, now an open square. The statue of\r\nCharlemagne we see there is modern, set up in 1882.\r\n\r\nThe Cathedral, beloved and venerated by Parisians from all time--“_Sacra\r\nsancta ecclesia civitatis Parisiensis_”--stands upon the site of two\r\nancient churches which in early ages together formed the Episcopal\r\nchurch of the capital of France. One bore the name of the martyr, St.\r\nStephen, the other was dedicated to Ste-Marie.\r\n\r\nThese churches stood on the site of a pre-Christian place of worship, a\r\ntemple of Mars or Jupiter: Roman remains of great extent were found\r\nbeneath the pavements when clearing away the ancient buildings on the\r\nParvis. Fire wrought havoc on both churches, entirely destroyed one, and\r\ntowards the year 1162 Sully set about the erection of a church worthy of\r\nthe capital of his country. Its first stone was laid by the Guelph\r\nrefugee, Pope Alexander III, in 1163. The chancel, the nave and the\r\nfaçade were finished without undue delay, and in 1223 the whole of the\r\nbeautiful Gothic building was finished; alterations were made during the\r\nyears that followed until about 1300. From that time onward Notre-Dame\r\nwas made a store-house of things beautiful. The finest pictures of each\r\nsucceeding age lined its walls--at length so thickly that there was room\r\nfor no more. Much beautiful old work, including a fine rood screen, was\r\ncarted away under Louis XIV, when space was wanted for the immense\r\nstatue of the Virgin set up then in fulfilment of the vow of Louis XIII,\r\ndestroyed later. The figures on the great doors, we see to-day, are\r\nmodern: the original statuettes were hacked to pieces at the outbreak of\r\nthe Revolution by the mob who mistook the Kings of Israel for the Kings\r\nof France!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUE MASSILLON]\r\n\r\nThe _flêche_, too, is of latter-day construction, built by Viollet le\r\nDuc, to replace the ancient turret bell-tower. Destruction and\r\ndesecration of every kind fell upon the Cathedral in Revolution days.\r\nPriceless glass was smashed, magnificent work of every sort ruthlessly\r\ntorn down, trampled in the dust. On the Parvis--the space before the\r\nCathedral doors where in long-gone ages the mystery plays were acted--a\r\ngreat bonfire was made of all the Mass books and Bibles, etc., found\r\nwithin the sacred edifice: priceless illuminated missals, etc., perished\r\nthen. Marvellous woodwork, glorious stained-glass windows, fine statuary\r\nhappily still remain.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of its erection, the grand Cathedral was closely connected\r\nwith the greatest historical events of France, just as the church built\r\nby Childebert and the older church of St-Étienne had been before. St.\r\nLouis was buried there in 1271. The first States-General was held there\r\nin 1302. There Henry VI of England was crowned King of France in 1431,\r\nand Marie-Stuart crowned Queen Consort in 1560. Henri IV heard his first\r\nMass there in 1694. Within the sacred walls the Revolutionists set up\r\nthe worship of reason, held sacrilegious fêtes. Napoléon I was crowned\r\nthere and was there married to Marie Louise of Austria. Napoléon III’s\r\nwedding took place there. These are some only singled out from a long\r\nlist of historical associations. National Te Deums, Requiems, Services\r\nof Reparation all take place at this Sancta Ecclesia Parisionis.\r\n\r\nThe Hôtel-Dieu on the north side of the Parvis is the modern hospital\r\nraised on the site of the ancient Paris House of God, the hospital for\r\nthe Paris poor built in the thirteenth century, always in close\r\nconnection with the Cathedral and having its _annexe_ across the little\r\nbridge St-Charles, a sort of covered gallery. Those blackened walls\r\nstood till 1909.\r\n\r\nRue du Cloître Notre-Dame belonged in past ages to the Cathedral\r\nChapter, a cloistered thoroughfare. Its fifty-one houses have almost\r\nentirely disappeared. Three still stand: Nos. 18, 16, 14. Pierre Lescot,\r\nthe notable sixteenth-century architect, to whom a canonry was given,\r\ndied there in 1578. Rue Chanoinesse is still inhabited by the Cathedral\r\ncanons. Its houses are all ancient. At No. 10 lived Fulbert, the uncle\r\nof the beautiful Héloïse, who braved his anger for the sake of Abelard,\r\nwho lived and taught hard by. Racine is said to have lived at No. 16.\r\nThe old Tour de Dagobert, which did not, however, date back quite to\r\nthat monarch’s time, stood at No. 18 till 1908. Its wonderful staircase,\r\nformed of a single oak-tree, is at the Musée Cluny. Lacordaire is said\r\nto have lodged at No. 17. A curious old courtyard at No. 20. At No. 24,\r\nvestiges of the old chapel St-Aignan (twelfth century). At 26, a passage\r\nwith old pillars and paved with old tombstones. Leading out of it runs\r\nthe little Rue des Chantres where the choristers lived and worked to\r\nperfect their voices and their knowledge of music. Rue Massillon is\r\nentirely made of old houses with most interesting features--a marvellous\r\ncarved oak staircase at No. 6, fine doors, curious courtyards. Another\r\nbeautiful staircase at No. 4. In Rue des Ursins, connected with Rue\r\nChanoinesse, we find many ancient houses. At No. 19 we see vestiges of\r\nthe old chapel where Mass was said secretly during the Revolution by\r\npriests who went there disguised as workmen.\r\n\r\nRue de la Colombe, where we find an inscription referring to the\r\ndiscovery there of Roman remains, dates from the early years of the\r\nthirteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nL’ÎLE ST-LOUIS\r\n\r\n\r\nCrossing the bridge painted of yore bright red and known therefore as le\r\nPont-Rouge, we find ourselves upon the Île St-Louis, in olden days two\r\ndistinct islands: l’Île Notre-Dame and l’Île-aux-Vaches, both\r\nuninhabited until the early years of the seventeenth century. Tradition\r\nsays the law-duels known as _jugements de Dieu_ took place there. The\r\nChapter of Notre-Dame had certain rights over the island.\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century, consent was given for the Île St-Louis to be\r\nbuilt upon, and the official constructor of Ponts and Chaussées obtained\r\nthe concession of the two islets under the stipulation that he should\r\nfill up the brook which separated them, and make a bridge across the arm\r\nof the Seine to the city quay. The brook became Rue Poulletier, where we\r\nsee interesting vestiges of that day and two ancient _hôtels_, Nos. 3\r\nand 20--the latter now a school.\r\n\r\nAll along Rue St-Louis-en-l’Île and in the streets connected with it,\r\nfine old mansions, or beautiful vestiges of the buildings then erected,\r\nstill stand. The church we see there was begun by Le Vau in 1664, on the\r\nsite of a chapel built at his own expense by one Nicolas-le-Jeune. The\r\ncurious belfry dates from 1741. The church is a very store-house of\r\nworks of art, many of them by the great masters of old, put there by its\r\nvicar, Abbé Bossuet, who devoted his whole fortune and his untiring\r\nenergy to the work of restoring the church left in ruins after its\r\ndespoliation at the Revolution, and died so poor in consequence as to be\r\nburied by the parish. At No. 1 of this quaint street we find a pavilion\r\nof l’hôtel de Bretonvilliers of which an arch is seen at No. 7, and\r\nother vestiges at Nos. 5 and 3. The Arbalétriers were wont to meet here\r\nin pre-Revolution days. No. 2, its northern front giving on Quai d’Anjou\r\n(_see_ p. 328), is the grand mansion of Nicolas Lambert de Thorigny,\r\nbuilt by Le Vau, 1680; its splendid decorations are the work of Lebrun\r\nand other noted artists and sculptors of the time. In 1843 it was bought\r\nby the family of a Polish prince and used in part as an orphanage for\r\nthe daughters of Polish exiles till 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nL’HÔTEL DE VILLE AND ITS SURROUNDINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hôtel de Ville, which gives its name to the arrondissement, is a\r\nmodern erection built as closely as possible on the plan and from the\r\ndesigns of the fine Renaissance structure of the sixteenth century burnt\r\nto the ground by the Communards in 1871. Place de l’Hôtel de Ville,\r\nwhere it stands, was until 1830 Place de Grève, the Place du Port de\r\nGrève of anterior days, days going back to Roman times. Like the Paris\r\nCathedral, the hôtel de Ville is closely linked with the most marked\r\nevents of French history. The first hôtel de Ville was known as la\r\nMaison-aux-Piliers, previously l’hôtel des Dauphins du Viennois, bought\r\nin 1357 by Étienne Marcel, Prévôt des Marchands, of historic memory\r\n(_see_ p. 39), whose statue we see in the garden. The first stone of the\r\nfine building burnt in 1871 was laid by François I in 1533, its last one\r\nin the time of Henri IV. On the Square before it executions took place,\r\nfor offences criminal, political, religious, by burning, strangling,\r\nhanging and the guillotine. In its centre stood a tall Gothic cross\r\nreared upon eight steps, at the foot of which the condemned said their\r\nlast prayers. The guillotine first set up there in 1792 was soon moved\r\nabout, as we know, to different points of the city, when used for\r\npolitical victims. Common-law criminals continued to expiate their evil\r\ndeeds on Place de Grève. It was a comparatively small _place_ in those\r\ndays. Its enlargement in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries caused\r\nthe destruction of many old streets, in one of which was the famous\r\nMaison de la Lanterne. Close up against the Hôtel de Ville stood in past\r\ndays the old church St-Jean-en-Grève and a hospice; both were\r\nincorporated in the town hall by Napoléon I. The entire building was\r\ndestroyed in 1871, but the present structure is remarkably fine in every\r\npart, both within and without, and the Salle St-Jean, memorizing the\r\nchurch once there, is splendidly decorated. The Avenue Victoria, on the\r\nsite of ancient streets, memorizes the visit of the English Queen in\r\n1855. The short Rue de la Tâcherie (from _tâche_: task, work) crossing\r\nit, was in the thirteenth century Rue de la Juiverie, for here we are in\r\nthe neighbourhood of what is still the Jews’ quarter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLACE DE GRÈVE]\r\n\r\nA modern garden-square surrounds the beautiful Tour St-Jacques, all that\r\nis left of the ancient church St-Jacques-la-Boucherie, built in the\r\nfifteenth century, on the site of a chapel of the eighth century,\r\nfinished in the sixteenth, entirely restored in the nineteenth century\r\nand again recently. It is used as an observatory. Paris weather\r\nstatistics hail from la Tour St-Jacques.\r\n\r\nOn the site of the modern Place du Châtelet rose in bygone ages the\r\nprimitive tower of the Grand Châtelet, which developed under\r\nLouis-le-Gros into a strongly fortified castle and prison guarding the\r\nbridge across the Seine to the right, while the Petit Châtelet guarded\r\nit on the left bank. A _chandelle_--a flaming tallow candle--set up by\r\ncommand of Philippe-le-Long near its doorway, is said to be the origin\r\nof the lighting, dim enough as it was for centuries, of Paris streets.\r\nThe fortress was rebuilt by Louis XIV; part of it served as the Morgue\r\nuntil it was razed to the ground in 1802. The fountain plays where the\r\nprison once stood. Numerous old streets lead out of the modern Rue de\r\nRivoli at this point. Rue Nicolas-Flamel, running where good Nicolas had\r\na fine _hôtel_ in the early years of the fifteenth century, and Rue\r\nPernelle recording the name of his wife, have existed under other names\r\nfrom the thirteenth century. Rue St-Bon recalls the chapel on the spot\r\nin still earlier times.\r\n\r\nRue St-Martin beginning at Quai des Gesvres, the high road to the north\r\nof Roman days, after cutting through Avenue Victoria, crosses Rue de\r\nRivoli at this point, and here was the first of the four Portes which in\r\nsuccession marked the city boundary on this side. The beautiful\r\nsixteenth-century church we see here, St-Merri, stands on the site of a\r\nchapel built in the seventh century. In a Gothic crypt remains of its\r\npatron saint who lived and died on the spot are reverently guarded, and\r\nthe bones of Eudes the Falconer, the redoubtable warrior who dowered the\r\nchurch, discovered in perfect preservation in a stone coffin in the\r\ntime of François I, lie in the choir. It is a wonderfully interesting\r\nstructure, with fine glass, woodwork, mouldings, statues and statuettes.\r\nThe statuettes we see on the walls of the porch are comparatively\r\nmodern, replacing the ancient ones destroyed at the Revolution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LA TOUR ST-JACQUES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW ACROSS THE SEINE FROM PLACE DU CHÂTELET]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUE BRISEMICHE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: L’ÉGLISE ST-GERVAIS]\r\n\r\nRue de la Verrerie bordering the southern walls of the church and\r\nrunning on almost to Rue Vieille-du-Temple, dates from the twelfth\r\ncentury and reminds us by its name of the glaziers and glass painters’\r\nCompany, developed from the confraternity which in 1187 made the old\r\nstreet its quarter. Louis XIV, finding this a convenient road on the way\r\nto Vincennes, had it enlarged. There dwelt Jacquemin Gringonneur, who,\r\nit is said, invented playing cards for the distraction of the insane\r\nKing Charles VI. Bossuet’s father and many other persons of position or\r\nrepute lived in the old houses which remain or in others on the site of\r\nthe more modern ones. At No. 76 was the _hôtel_ inhabited by Suger, the\r\nMinister of Louis VI and Louis VII; part of its ancient walls were\r\nincorporated in the church in the sixteenth century. Here, too, is the\r\npresbytery, where in the courtyard we find a wonderful old spiral\r\nstaircase, its summit higher than the church roof. Old streets and\r\npassages wind in and out around the church. Exploring them, we come upon\r\ninteresting vestiges innumerable. The ancient clergy house is at No. 76,\r\nRue St-Martin. Rue Cloître-St-Merri, Rue Taille-pain, Rue Brise-Miche,\r\nthese two referring to the bakery once there and bread portioned out,\r\ncut or broken for the Clergy; Rue St-Merri and its old passage, Impasse\r\ndu Bœuf, with its eighteenth-century grille; Rue Pierre-au-lard, a\r\nhumorous adaptation of the name Pierre Aulard, borne by a notable\r\nparishioner of the eighteenth century. Passage Jabach on the site of the\r\nhome of the rich banker of the seventeenth century whose fine collection\r\nof pictures were the nucleus of the treasures of the Louvre. Impasse\r\nSt-Fiacre, the word saint cut away at the Revolution, where dwelt the\r\nfirst hirer-out of cabs; hence the term _fiacre_. Rue de la Reynie\r\n(thirteenth century), renamed in memory of the Lieutenant-General of\r\nPolice who, in 1669, ordered the lighting of Paris streets, but did\r\nnot provide lamplighters. Private citizens were bound daily to light and\r\nextinguish the lanterns then placed at the end and in the middle of each\r\nthoroughfare. Everyone of these streets, dull and grimy though they be,\r\nare full of interest for the explorer. Going on up Rue St-Martin, we see\r\non both sides numerous features of interest. Look at Nos. 97, 100, 103,\r\n104; and at No. 116, called Maison des Goths, with its fine old frieze.\r\nAt No. 120 there are two storeyed cellars and in one of them a well. The\r\nfontaine Maubuée at No. 122 is referred to in old documents so early as\r\n1320. Its name shortened from _mauvaise buée_, i.e. _mauvaise fumée_, is\r\nnot suggestive of the purity of its waters at that remote period; the\r\nfountain was reconstructed in 1733--the house some sixty years later.\r\nThe upper end of Rue Simon-le-Franc, which we turn into here, was until\r\nrecent times Rue Maubuée. It may, perhaps, still deserve the name. Rue\r\nSimon-le-Franc is one of the oldest among all these old streets, for it\r\nwas a thoroughfare in the year 1200. It records the name of a worthy\r\ncitizen of his day, one Simon Franque. All the houses are ancient, some\r\nvery picturesque. Next in date is that most characteristic of old-time\r\nstreets, the Rue de Venise. The name, a misnomer, dates only from 1851,\r\ndue to an old sign. The street was known by various appellations since\r\nits formation somewhere about the year 1250. Every house and court there\r\nis ancient, the space between those on either side so narrow that the\r\ntall, dark buildings seem to meet at their apex. No. 27 is the old inn\r\n“l’Épée de Bois,” lately renovated and its name changed to “L’Arrivée de\r\nVenise,” where from the year 1658 a company of musicians and\r\ndancing-masters duly licensed by Mazarin used to meet under the\r\ndirection of “Le roi des violons,” their chief. This was, in fact, the\r\nnucleus of the Académie National of Music and Dancing, known later as\r\nthe Conservatoire. Great men of letters too were wont to meet in that\r\nold inn. Rue de Venise opens into Rue Beaubourg, a road that stretched\r\nthrough a _beau bourg_, i.e. a fine township, so far back as the\r\neleventh century, with special privileges, the rights of citizenship for\r\nits inhabitants although lying without the boundary-wall. No. 4, now\r\nrazed, was the “Restaurant du Bon Bourg,” _tenu par_ “le Roi du Bon\r\nVin.” To the left is Rue des Étuves, i.e. Bath Street, with houses old\r\nand curious. Rue de Venise runs at its lower end into the famous Rue de\r\nQuincampoix, the street of Law’s bank (_see_ p. 63), where every house\r\nis ancient or has vestiges of past ages. No. 43 was a shop let in Law’s\r\ntime at the rate of 100 francs a day. The street leads down into Rue des\r\nLombards, the ancient usurers’ and pawnbrokers’ street, inhabited in\r\nthese days by a very opposite class--herborists. Tradition says\r\nBoccaccio was born here. Rue du Temple, Rue des Archives, Rue\r\nVieille-du-Temple, Rue de Sévigné, traversed in part in the 3rd\r\narrondissement (_see_ p. 108) all have their lower numbers in this 4th\r\narrondissement, the first three branching off from Rue de Rivoli, the\r\nlast from Rue St-Antoine. At No. 61, Rue du Temple, on the site of the\r\nvanished Couvent des Filles de Ste-Avoie, we see an old gabled house. In\r\nthe courtyard of No. 57, l’hôtel de Titon, the Bastille armourer. At No.\r\n41 the old tavern “l’Aigle d’Or.” No. 20 is the ancient office of the\r\nGabelles--the salt-tax. Here we see an old sign taken from the vicinity\r\nof St-Gervais, showing the famous elm-tree, of which more anon. Every\r\nhouse shows some interesting old-time feature. This brings us again\r\nclose up to the Hôtel de Ville, where we see the venerable church\r\nSt-Gervais-et-St-Protais, dating in its present form from the sixteenth\r\ncentury, on the site of a church built there in the sixth. That\r\nprimitive erection grew into a beautiful church in the early years of\r\nthe twelfth century. Some of the exquisite work of that day may still be\r\nseen by turning up the narrow passage to the left, where we find the\r\nancient _charniers_. Rebuilding was undertaken two centuries later. A\r\ncurious half-effaced inscription on an old wall within refers to this\r\nreconstruction and its dedication fête day, instituted in honour of\r\n“Messieurs St. Gervais et St. Protais.” The last rebuilding was in 1581.\r\nThen in the seventeenth century, the Renaissance façade was added to the\r\nGothic edifice behind it by Salomon de Brosse. The church is full of\r\nprecious artistic work, glorious glass, frescoes, statuary and rich in\r\nhistoric associations. Madame de Sévigné was married here; Scarron was\r\nmarried to the young girl destined to become Mme de Maintenon, and was\r\nperhaps buried in the beautiful Chapelle-Dorée. The church has always\r\nsuffered in time of war. At the Revolution the insurgents tried to shake\r\ndown its fine tall pillars; the marks are still to be seen. In\r\n1830-48-71 cannon balls pierced its belfry walls, and now on Good Friday\r\nof this war-year 1918, the enemy’s gun, firing at a range of\r\nseventy-five miles, struck its roof, laid low a great pillar, brought\r\ndeath and wounding to the assembled congregation. On the _place_ before\r\nthe church we see a tree railed round. A shadier elm-tree stood there\r\nonce, the famous Orme de St-Gervais, beneath which justice--or maybe at\r\ntimes injustice--was administered in the open air, in long-past ages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HÔTEL DE BEAUVAIS, RUE FRANÇOIS-MIRON]\r\n\r\nRue François-Miron running east, its lower end the ancient Rue\r\nSt-Antoine, shows us the _orme_, figured in the ironwork of all its\r\nbalconies. This end of the street was known in olden days as Rue du\r\nPourtour St-Gervais, then as Rue du Monceau St-Gervais, referring to the\r\nwide stretch of waste ground in the vicinity which, unbuilt upon for\r\ncenturies, was a favourite site for festive gatherings and tournaments.\r\nIt records the name of the Prévôt des Marchands of the sixteenth century\r\nto whom was due the façade of the Hôtel de Ville, burnt in 1871. Its\r\nhouses are for the most part ancient. No. 13, quaint and gabled,\r\nfifteenth century. No. 82 the old mansion of President Henault. No. 68\r\nhôtel de Beauvais, associated with many historic personages and events,\r\nhas Gothic cellars which of yore formed part of the monastastic house\r\nwhere Tasso wrote his great poem “Jerusalem Delivered.” The walls above\r\nthose fine cellars were knocked down in the third decade of the\r\nseventeenth century and replaced in 1655 by those we see there now,\r\nbuilt as the hôtel de Beauvais, destined to see many changes. At the\r\nRevolution the grand old mansion was for a time a coach-office, then a\r\nhouse let out in flats. Mozart is said to have stayed there in 1763.\r\n\r\nBehind the church is the old Rue des Barres with an ancient inscription\r\nand traces of an ancient chapel. The sordid but picturesque Rue de\r\nl’Hôtel de Ville was known for centuries as Rue de la Mortellerie, from\r\nthe _morteliers_, or masons who had settled there. In the dread cholera\r\nyear 1832 the inhabitants saw in the name of their street a sinister\r\nreference to the word _mort_ and demanded its change. Every house has\r\nsome feature of old-time interest. Beneath No. 56 there is a Gothic\r\ncellar, once, tradition says, a chapel founded by Blanche de France,\r\ngrand-daughter of Philippe-le-Bel, who died in 1358. At No. 39 we see\r\nthe narrowest street in Paris, Rue du Paon Blanc, erewhile known as the\r\n“descente à la rivière.” Nos. 8-2 is the venerable hôtel de Sens (_see_\r\np. 117).\r\n\r\nIn Rue Geoffroy l’Asnier, between Rue de l’Hôtel de Ville and Rue\r\nFrançois-Miron, thirteenth century, we find among many other vestiges of\r\nold times the fine seventeenth-century door of hôtel Chalons at No. 26.\r\nIn Rue de Jouy of the same period and interest, at No. 12 and No. 14,\r\ndependencies of l’hôtel Beauvais; at No. 7 l’hôtel d’Aumont, built in\r\n1648 on the site of the house where Richelieu was born. At No. 9, the\r\nÉcole Sophie-Germain, the ancient hôtel de Fourcy, previously inhabited\r\nby a rich bourgeois family.\r\n\r\nRue des Archives (_see_ p. 74) is chiefly interesting in its course\r\nthrough this arrondissement for the old church des Billettes (_see_ p.\r\n76) on the site of the house of the Jew Jonathas, so called from the\r\nsign hung outside a neighbouring house--_a billot_--i.e. log of wood.\r\nRebuilt in 1745, closed at the Revolution, the church was given to the\r\nProtestants in 1808. The beautiful cloisters of the fifteenth-century\r\nstructure were left untouched and are enclosed in the school adjoining\r\nthe church. Rue Ste-Croix-de-la-Bretonnerie dates from the early years\r\nof the thirteenth century and is rich in relics of past ages. Its name\r\nrecords the existence there of the thirteenth-century church de\r\nl’Exaltation de la Ste-Croix and of a convent instituted in 1258 in the\r\nancient Monnaie du Roi--the Mint--suppressed at the Revolution, but of\r\nwhich traces are still seen on the square. At No. 47 we see a turret\r\ndating from 1610. The dispensary at No. 44 is the old hôtel Feydeau de\r\nBrou (1760). No. 35 belonged to the old church Chapter. The boys’ school\r\nat No. 22 is ancient. No. 20 dates from 1696. Rue Aubriot from the\r\nthirteenth to the middle of the nineteenth century was Rue du\r\nPuits-au-Marais. Aubriot was the thirteenth-century Prévôt de Paris, an\r\nactive builder, and who first laid drains beneath Paris streets. No. 10\r\ndates from the first years of the seventeenth century. Vestiges of that\r\nor an earlier age are seen all along the street. Rue des Blancs-Manteaux\r\nrecalls the begging Friars, servants of Mary, wearing long white\r\ncloaks, who settled here in 1258. They united a few years later with the\r\nGuillemites, whose name is recorded in a neighbouring street of ancient\r\ndate. Their church at No. 12 was entirely rebuilt in 1685, and in 1863\r\nthe portal of the demolished Barnabite church added to its façade.\r\nRemains of the old convent buildings are incorporated in the\r\nMont-de-Piété opposite. At No. 14 we see traces of the old Priory. No.\r\n22 and No. 25 have fine old staircases and other interesting vestiges.\r\nThe cabaret de “l’Homme Armé” existed in the fifteenth century. We find\r\nancient vestiges, often fine staircases, at most of the houses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUE VIEILLE-DU-TEMPLE]\r\n\r\nRue Vieille-du-Temple, which begins its long course opposite the Mairie,\r\nhas lost its first numbers. This old street shows us interesting\r\nfeatures at every step. No. 15, hôtel de Vibraye. No. 20, Impasse de\r\nl’hôtel d’Argenson. No. 24, hôtel of the Maréchal d’Effiat, father of\r\nCinq Mars. The short Rue du Trésor at its side was so named in 1882 from\r\nthe treasure-trove found beneath the _hôtel_ when cutting the street,\r\ngold pieces of the time of King Jean and Charles V in a copper vase, a\r\nsum of something like 120,000 francs in the money of to-day. At No. 42\r\nopens Rue des Rosiers; roses once grew in gardens there. At No. 43\r\nPassage des Singes, leading into Rue des Guillemites, once Rue des\r\nSinges. No. 45 shows a façade claiming to date back to the year 1416.\r\nNo. 47, hôtel des Ambassadeurs de Hollande, recalling the days when\r\nDutch diplomats dwelt there and took persecuted Protestants under their\r\nprotection, is on the site of the _hôtel_ of Jean de Rieux, before which\r\nthe duc d’Orléans met his death at the hands of Jean Sans Peur, the\r\nhabitation of historic persons and events until Revolution days, when\r\nit was taken for dancing saloons. Here we see splendid vestiges of past\r\ngrandeur: vaulted ceilings, sculptures, frescoes. The Marché des\r\nBlancs-Manteaux, in the street opening at No. 46, is part of an ancient\r\nmansion. Turning down Rue des Hospitalières-St-Gervais, recalling the\r\nhospital once there, we find in Rue des Francs-Bourgeois, at No. 35, an\r\nold _hôtel_. At No. 31, l’hôtel d’Albret, its first stone laid in 1550\r\nby Connétable Anne de Montmorency, restored in the eighteenth century.\r\nAt No. 25, one side of the fine hôtel Lamoignon. Crossing Rue des\r\nRosiers we turn down Rue des Écouffes, an ancient street of pawnbrokers,\r\nwhere in a house on the site of No. 20, Philippe de Champaigne, the\r\ngreat painter, lived and died (1674). Rue du Roi de Sicile records the\r\nexistence there, and on land around, of the palace of Charles d’Anjou,\r\nbrother of St. Louis, crowned King of Naples and Sicily in 1266. The\r\nmansion changed hands many times and in 1698 became the hôtel de la\r\nGrande Force, a noted prison. Part of it became later the Caserne des\r\nPompiers in Rue Sévigné; the rest was demolished. On the site of the\r\nhouse No. 2 lived Bault and his wife, jailers of Marie-Antoinette. And\r\nhere, at the corner of Rue Malher, Princesse de Lamballe and many of her\r\ncompeers were slain in the “Massacres of September.”\r\n\r\nRue Ferdinand-Duval, till 1900 from about the year 1000 Rue des Juifs,\r\nis full of old-time relics. At No. 20 we find a courtyard and _hôtel_\r\nknown in past days as l’hôtel des Juifs. Nos. 18 and 16, site of the\r\nhospital du Petit St-Antoine in pre-Revolution days, of a famous shop\r\nstore under the Empire.\r\n\r\nRue Pavée dates from the early years of the thirteenth century, the\r\nfirst street in Paris to be paved. Here at Nos. 11 and 13 lived the\r\nduke of Norfolk, British Ambassador in 1533. At No. 12 we find two old\r\nstaircases, once those of an ancient _hôtel_ incorporated in the prison\r\nof La Force. At No. 24 stands the fine old hôtel de Lamoignon, rebuilt\r\non the site of an older structure, by Diane de France, daughter of Henri\r\nII (sixteenth century), the natal house of Lamoignon de Malesherbes,\r\nrenowned for his defence of Louis XVI. Alphonse Daudet lived here for a\r\ntime. Close by was the prison la Petite Force, a woman’s prison, too\r\nwell known in Revolution days by numerous notable women of the time. In\r\nRue de Sévigné, which begins here, we turn at No. 11 into the garden of\r\na bathing establishment on the site of a smaller hôtel Lamoignon, where\r\nin 1790 Beaumarchais built the théâtre du Marais, otherwise l’Athénée\r\ndes Étrangers, with materials from the demolished Bastille. Here we see\r\nbefore us one single wall of the demolished prison de la Force, and an\r\nindication of the spot where thirty royalist prisoners were put to\r\ndeath. Rue de Jarente, so named from the Prior of the monastic\r\ninstitution, Ste-Catherine du Val des Escholiers, erewhile here, shows\r\nus an old fountain in the Impasse de la Poissonnerie. Rue d’Ormesson\r\nstretches across the eighteenth-century priory fish market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE OLD QUARTIER ST-POL\r\n\r\n\r\nWe come now to the interesting old-world quarter behind and surrounding\r\nthe church St-Paul and the Lycée Charlemagne, the site of the palace\r\nSt-Pol of ancient days. The church, as we see it, dates from 1641,\r\nreplacing a tiny Jesuit chapel built in the previous century and\r\ndedicated to St. Louis. Its first stone was laid by Louis XIII, and the\r\nchapel built from the designs of two Jesuit priests, aided by the\r\narchitect Vignole. Hence the term _Jesuite_ used in France for the\r\nornate Renaissance style of architecture we see in the façade of the\r\nchurch before us. Richelieu, newly ordained, celebrated his first Mass\r\nhere in 1641, and defrayed the cost of completing the church by the\r\nerection of the great portal. The heart of Louis XIII and of Louis XIV\r\nwere buried here beneath sumptuous monuments. At the Revolution the\r\n_Tiers État_, held their first assembly in the old church St-Pol, soon\r\nrazed to the ground by the insurgents. The Jesuits’ chapel was saved\r\nfrom destruction by the books from suppressed convents which had been\r\npiled up within it, forming thus a barricade. The dome was the second\r\nerected in Paris. The holy water scoops were a gift from Victor Hugo at\r\nthe baptism of his first child born in the parish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUE ÉGINHARD]\r\n\r\nTurning into Rue St-Paul we see at No. 35 the doorway of the demolished\r\nhôtel de Sève. In the Passage St-Paul, till 1877 Passage St-Louis, we\r\nfind at No. 7 the _presbytère_, once, tradition says, a _pied-à-terre_\r\nof the _grand_ Condé, and at No. 38 an old courtyard. At No. 36 vestiges\r\nof the prison originally part of the convent founded by St. Éloi in the\r\ntime of Dagobert.[C] The arched Passage St-Pierre which led in olden\r\ndays to the cemetery St-Pol, the burial-place of so many notable\r\npersons: Rabelais, Mansart, etc., and of prisoners from the Bastille,\r\nthe man in the iron mask among them, has lately been swept away, with\r\nsome walls of the old convent close up against it. The Manège till\r\nrecent days at No. 30 was in days past a favourite meeting place of the\r\npeople when in disaccord with the authorities in politics or on\r\nindustrial questions. At No. 31 we look into Rue Éginhard, the Ruelle\r\nSt-Pol of the fourteenth century; the walls of some of its houses once\r\nformed part of the old church St-Pol. At No. 8 we see the square turret\r\nof an old-hôtel St-Maur. At No. 4, l’hôtel de Vieuville, an interesting\r\nfifteenth-and sixteenth-century building, condemned to demolition, which\r\nhas been inhabited by notable personages of successive periods. Passing\r\nthrough the black-walled court we mount a fine old-time staircase to\r\nfind halls with beautiful mouldings, a wonderful frescoed ceiling, etc.\r\netc., all in the possession at present of a well-known antiquarian. No.\r\n5, doorway of l’hôtel de Lignerac. In Rue Ave-Maria, its site covered in\r\npast days by two old convents, we see at No. 15 an _hôtel_ where was\r\nonce the tennis-court of the Croix-Noire, in its day the “Illustre\r\nThéâtre” with Molière as its chief and whence the great tragedian was\r\nled for debt to durance vile at the Châtelet. No. 2 was once “la\r\nBoucherie Ave-Maria.”\r\n\r\nRue Charlemagne was known by various names till this last one given in\r\n1844--one of its old names, Rue des Prêtres, is still seen engraved in\r\nthe wall at No. 7. The _petit_ Lycée Charlemagne has among its walls\r\npart of one of the ancient towers of the boundary wall of\r\nPhilippe-Auguste which passed in a straight line to the Seine at this\r\npoint. It is known as Tour Montgomery and shelters a ... gas meter! The\r\nremains of another tower are seen behind the gymnasium. Before 1908 the\r\nlast remaining walls of the hôtel du Prévôt still stood in Passage\r\nCharlemagne, a picturesque turreted Renaissance bit of “Old Paris” let\r\nout in tenements, the last vestiges of the historic mansion where many\r\nnotable persons, royal and other, had sojourned. Interesting old-time\r\nfeatures are seen at Nos. 18, 21, 22, 25; No. 25 underwent restoration\r\nin recent years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUE DU PRÉVÔT]\r\n\r\nIn Rue du Prévôt we see more old-time vestiges. Rue du Figuier dates\r\nfrom about 1300 when a fig-tree flourished there, cut down three\r\ncenturies later. Nos. 19-15, now a Jewish hospice, was the abode of the\r\nMiron, royal physicians from 1550 to 1680. Every house shows some\r\nrelic. At No. 5 we come upon an old well and steps in the courtyard. No.\r\n8 was perhaps the home of Rabelais. At No. 1 we find ourselves before\r\nthe turreted hôtel de Sens, built between 1474 and 1519, on the site of\r\na private mansion given by Charles V to the archbishops of Sens, who at\r\nthat time had ecclesiastical jurisdiction over Paris. Ecclesiastics of\r\nhistoric fame, and at one time Marguerite de Valois, la Reine Margot,\r\ndwelt there during the succeeding 150 years. Then Paris became an\r\narchbishopric, and this fine hôtel de Sens was abandoned--let. It has\r\nserved as a coaching house, a jam manufactory, finally became a glass\r\nstore and factory, and in part a Jewish synagogue. In Rue du Fauconnier,\r\nNos. 19, 17, 15, are ancient. Rue des Jardins, where stretched the\r\ngardens of the old Palais St-Pol, has none but ancient houses. At No. 5\r\nwe see a hook which served of yore to hold the chain stretched across\r\nthe street to close it. Molière lived there in 1645. Rabelais died\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HÔTEL DE SENS]\r\n\r\nCrossing Rue St-Paul we come to Rue des Lions, recalling the royal\r\nmenagerie once there. Fine old mansions lie along its whole length. At\r\nNo. 10 we find a beautiful staircase; another at No. 12, dating from the\r\nreign of Louis XIII, and in the courtyard at No. 3 we see an ancient\r\nfountain. At No. 14 there was till recent times the fountain “du regard\r\ndes lions.” No. 17 formed part of l’hôtel Vieuville. Chief among the\r\nancient houses of Rue Charles V is No. 12, l’hôtel d’Antoine d’Aubray,\r\nfather of the notorious woman-poisoner, la Brinvilliers, with its\r\ngraceful winding staircase. Here Mme de Brinvilliers tried to bring\r\nabout the assassination of her lover Briancourt by her other lover\r\nSte-Croix. Nuns, nursing sisters, live there now. Rue Beautreillis was\r\nin bygone days the site of a vine-covered trellis in the gardens of the\r\nhistoric palace St-Pol made up of l’hôtel Beautreillis and other fine\r\n_hôtels_ confiscated from his nobles by King Charles V, and at No. 1 we\r\nsee an ancient and truly historic vine climbing a trellis, its origin\r\nlost in the mist of centuries. Is it really, as some would have it, a\r\nrelic of the vines that gave grapes for the table of Charles V? All the\r\nhouses here are ancient. No. 10 was the mansion of the duc de\r\nValentinois, prince de Monaco in 1640. We see ancient houses along Rue\r\ndu Petit Musc, a fourteenth-century street. No. 1 is the south side of\r\nl’École Massillon (_see_ p. 326). We cross boulevard Henri IV to the\r\nBibliothèque de l’Arsenal, its walls in part, the Arsenal built by Henri\r\nIV on the site of a more ancient one, restored in the first half of the\r\neighteenth century, its façade entirely rebuilt under Napoléon III. The\r\nname of Sully given to the bridge and the street reminds us that the\r\nstatesman lived at the Arsenal. There Mme de Brinvilliers was tried and\r\ncondemned to death. The Arsenal was done away with by Louis XVI, streets\r\ncut across the site of most of its demolished walls. What remained\r\nbecame the library we see; it has counted among its librarians men of\r\nspecial distinction: Nodier, Hérédia, etc., and is now under the\r\ndirection of the well-known man of letters Funck-Brentano. Various\r\nrelics of past days and of old-time inhabitants are to be seen there and\r\ntraces of the boundary wall of Charles V. Rue de la Cerisaie, hard by,\r\nis another street recalling the palace gardens--for cherry-trees then\r\ngrew here. On the site of No. 10 Gabrielle d’Estrées was seized with her\r\nlast illness while at the supper-table of its owner, the friend of her\r\nloyal lover. The houses here are all ancient and characteristic, as are\r\nalso those in Rue Lesdiguières where till the first years of this\r\npresent century the wall of a dependency of the Bastille still stood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nLA PLACE DES VOSGES\r\n\r\n\r\nHere we are on the old Place Royale--the _place_ where royalties dwelt\r\nand courtiers disported in the days of Louis XIII, whose statue we see\r\nstill in the centre of the big, dreary garden square. That statue was\r\nput there by Napoléon to replace the original one, carted away and\r\nmelted down in Revolutionary days when the _ci-devant_ Place Royale\r\nbecame Place des Fédérés, then Place de l’Indivisibilité. Napoléon first\r\nnamed it Place des Vosges, a name confirmed after 1870 as a tribute of\r\ngratitude to the department which had first paid up its share of the war\r\ncontribution. In the early centuries of the Bourbon kings the palace of\r\nthe Tournelles had stood here (see p. 8). After its demolition the site\r\nwas taken for a horse market, and there the famous duel was fought\r\nbetween the _mignons_ of Henri II and the followers of the duc de Guise.\r\nHenri IV created the Place and had it parcelled out for building\r\npurposes. His idea was to make it the centre of a number of streets or\r\navenues each bearing the name of one of the provinces of France. The\r\nKing died and that project was not carried out, but the extensive site\r\nwas soon the square of the fine mansions we see to-day, mansions fallen\r\nfrom their high estate, no longer the private abodes of the world of\r\nfashion, but standing unchanged in outward aspect.\r\n\r\nWe see the Pavillon du Roi on the south side facing Rue de Birague, once\r\nRue du Pavillon du Roi, where at No. 11 was born Mme de Sévigné (1626);\r\nopposite it the Pavillon de la Reine. At No. 7 the _petit_ hôtel Sully\r\nconnected with the _grand_ hôtel Sully of the Rue St-Antoine. Each house\r\nof the _place_ was inhabited and known by the name of a great noble or a\r\nwealthy financier. Their enumeration would take too much space here. At\r\nNo. 6 we see the house where Victor Hugo lived in more modern\r\ntimes--1833-48--now the Musée filled with souvenirs of his life and work\r\nand dedicated to his memory. Behind it, at the corner of Impasse\r\nGuénémée, is the _hôtel_ once the dwelling of Marion Delorme. Théophile\r\nGautier, and later Alphonse Daudet occupied a flat at No. 8. Passing out\r\nof the _place_ through Rue du Pas de la Mule, in its day “petite Rue\r\nRoyale,” we turn into Rue St-Antoine, where modern buildings are almost\r\nunknown, and vestiges of bygone ages are seen on every side. At No. 5 an\r\ninscription tells us this was the site of the courtyard of the Bastille\r\nthrough which the populace rushed in attack on the 14th July, 1789. At\r\nNo. 7 we remark an ancient sign “A la Renommée de la Friture.” At No. 17\r\nwe see what remains of the convent built by Mansart in 1632, on the site\r\nof the hôtel de Cossé, where for eighteen years St. Vincent de Paul was\r\nconfessor. The chapel, left intact, was given to the Protestants in\r\n1802. Here Fouquet and his son, Mme de Chantal, and the Marquis de\r\nSévigné were buried. No. 20 is l’hôtel de Mayenne et d’Ormesson,\r\nsixteenth or seventeenth century, on the site of an older _hôtel_ sold\r\nto Charles V to enlarge his palace St-Pol. It passed through many hands,\r\nroyal hands for the most part, and the building as we see it, or the\r\nprevious structure, was for a time the hôtel de Diane de Poitiers. In\r\nmodern times it became the Pension Favart, then in 1870, l’École des\r\nFrancs-Bourgeois under the direction of les Frères de la doctrine\r\nchrétienne. At No. 28 Impasse Guénémée, known in its fifteenth-century\r\ndays as Cul-de-Sac du Ha! Ha! a passage connected with the hôtel\r\nRohan-Guénémée in Place Royale. In the seventeenth century a convent\r\nwas built here, a sort of reformatory for erring girls and women of the\r\nupper classes who were shut up here in consequence of _lettres de\r\ncachet_. At No. 62 stands the hôtel de Sully. Its first owner staked the\r\nmansion at the gambling table and lost. At No. 101 we are before the\r\nLycée Charlemagne, built in 1804 on the site of two ancient mansions and\r\nof the old city wall, of which some traces still remain. At No. 133 we\r\nsee the Maison Séguier, with its fine old door, balcony and staircase;\r\nanother old house at No. 137; then this ancient thoroughfare becomes in\r\nthese modern days, Rue François-Miron (_see_ p. 104).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUE DE BIRAGUE, PLACE DES VOSGES]\r\n\r\nRue des Tournelles in this earlier part of its course is chiefly\r\ninteresting for the fine _hôtel_ at No. 28, built in 1690, decorated\r\nwith frescoes by Lebrun and Mignard, where the famous courtesan, Ninon\r\nde Lenclos, lived and died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE BASTILLE\r\n\r\n\r\nSo we come to Place de la Bastille.\r\n\r\nThe famous prison which stood there from the end of the fourteenth\r\ncentury to the memorable summer of 1789, was built by Hugues Aubriot,\r\nPrévôt du Roi, as a fortified castle to protect the palais St-Pol close\r\nby, and Paris in general, against hostile inroads from the country\r\nbeyond. Its form is well known. A perfect model of it is to be seen at\r\nCarnavalet, in that most interesting _salle_--the Bastille-room. It had\r\neight towers each 23 mètres high, each with its distinct name and use.\r\nWhite lines in the pavement of the _place_ show where some of its walls,\r\nsome of its towers rose, houses stand upon the site of others. The great\r\nmilitary citadel became a regular prison in the time of Charles VI--a\r\nmilitary prison, though civilians were from the first shut up there from\r\ntime to time. Aubriot himself was put there by the mob, to be quickly\r\nreleased by the King. Under Richelieu it became a State prison, the\r\nprison of _lettres de cachet_ notoriety. The Revolutionists attacked it\r\nin the idea that untold harshness, cruelty, injustice dominated there.\r\nAs a matter of fact, the Bastille was for years rather a luxurious place\r\nof retirement for persons who themselves wished or were desired by\r\nothers to lie low for a time, than a fort of durance vile. The last\r\ngovernor, M. de Launay, in particular, was generous and kind even to\r\nthe humblest of those placed beneath his rule. And we know the attacking\r\nmob found seven prisoners only--two madmen, the others acknowledged\r\ncriminals. M. de Launay was massacred nevertheless. The Revolutionists\r\nseized all the arms they could find, a goodly store; the walls were\r\nrazed soon afterwards and a board put up with the words “Ici on dance.”\r\nIn reality the attack upon the Bastille was a milder under-taking than\r\nis generally supposed, and its entire destruction took place later on in\r\nquite a business-like way by a contractor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LA BASTILLE]\r\n\r\nThe _place_ was finished in 1803. The Colonne de Juillet we see there\r\ndates from 1831. The bones of the victims of the two minor Revolutions\r\n(1830-48) are beneath it. Louis Philippe’s throne was burnt before it in\r\n1848.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nIN THE VICINITY OF TWO ANCIENT CHURCHES\r\n\r\n\r\nARRONDISSEMENT V. PANTHÉON. RIVE GAUCHE (LEFT BANK)\r\n\r\nCrossing the Seine by the Pont St-Michel we reach Place St-Michel, of\r\nwhich we will speak in another chapter, as it lies chiefly in\r\narrondissement VI. Turning to the east, we come upon two of the oldest\r\nand most interesting of Paris churches and a very network of ancient\r\nstreets, sordid enough some of them, but emphatically characteristic.\r\nRue de la Huchette dates from the twelfth century; there in olden days\r\ntwo very opposite classes plied their trade:--the _rotisseurs_--turnspits,\r\nand the diamond cutters. The old street is still of some renown in the\r\ndistrict for good cooking in the few restaurants of a humble order that\r\nremain. The erewhile Bouillon de la Huchette is now a _bal_. Once upon\r\na time Ambassadors dined at l’hôtellerie de l’Ange in this old street.\r\nAnd the name “Le Petit Caporal” tells its own tale. There Buonaparte,\r\nfriendless and penniless, lodged in the street’s decadent days. Rue\r\nZacharie, dark and narrow between its tall old houses, dates back to\r\nthe twelfth or early thirteenth century. Rue du Chat qui Pêche, less\r\nancient (sixteenth century), is a mere pathway between high walls. From\r\nRue Zacharie we turn into Rue St-Séverin, one of the most ancient\r\nof ancient streets. Many traces of past ages still remain despite\r\nthe demolition of old houses around the beautiful old church we see\r\nbefore us, and subterranean passages run beneath the soil. At No.\r\n26 and again at No. 4 we see the name of the street, the word Saint\r\nobliterated by the Revolutionists. The church porch gives on Rue de\r\nPrêtres-St-Séverin--thirteenth century. It was brought here from the\r\nthirteenth-century church St-Pierre-aux-Bœufs, razed in 1837. Till then\r\nthe entrance had been the old door, Rue St-Séverin, where we see still\r\nthe words, half effaced: “Bonne gens, qui par cy passées, priez Dieu\r\npour les trepassés,” and the figures of two lions, once on the church\r\nsteps, where the Clergy of the parish were wont of yore to administer\r\njustice: hence the phrase “Datum inter leones.” The church was built\r\nin the twelfth century, on the site of a chapel erected in the days\r\nof Childebert, over the tomb of Séverin, the hermit. Thrice restored,\r\npartially rebuilt, the beautiful edifice shows Gothic architecture in\r\nits three stages: primitive: porch, side door, three bays; rayonnant:\r\nthe tower and part of the nave and side aisle; flamboyant: chancel and\r\nthe splendid apse. Glorious stained glass, beautiful frescoes--modern,\r\nthe work of Flandrin, fine statues surround us here. A striking feature\r\nis the host of votive offerings, some a mere slab a few inches in size\r\nwith the simple word “Merci” and a date. Many refer to the successful\r\npassing of examinations, for we are in the vicinity of the University.\r\nThe presbytery and its garden cover what was once the graveyard. Some of\r\nthe old _charniers_ still remain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUE ST-SÉVERIN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ÉGLISE ST-SÉVERIN]\r\n\r\nRue de la Parcheminerie (thirteenth century), in part demolished\r\nrecently, in its early days Rue des Escrivains, was for long the\r\nexclusive habitation of whoever had to do with the making and selling of\r\nbooks. The “hôtel des Pères Tranquilles” once there has gone. Two old\r\nhouses, Nos. 6 and 7, were in the thirteenth-century dependencies of\r\nNorwich Cathedral for English student-monks. In Rue Boutebrie, one side\r\nentirely rebuilt of late, dwelt the illuminators of sixteenth-century\r\nscrolls and books. We see a characteristic ancient gable at No. 6.\r\nThis house and No. 8 have ancient staircases. Crossing Rue St-Jacques we\r\nturn into Rue St-Julien-le-Pauvre, “le Vieux Chemin” of past times.\r\nThrough the old arched doorway we see there, surmounted by a figure of\r\nJustice, was the abode of a notable eighteenth-century Governor of the\r\nPetit-Châtelet, whose duty was that of hearing both sides in student\r\nquarrels and pronouncing judgment. The church we see was the University\r\nchurch of the twelfth and several succeeding centuries. University\r\nmeetings were held there and many a town and gown riot, or a merely gown\r\nriot, took place within its walls. The slab above the old door tells of\r\nits cession to the administrators of the hôtel-Dieu in 1655. Some of its\r\nstones date from the ninth or, maybe, from an even earlier century; for\r\nthe church before us was a rebuilding in the twelfth of one erected in\r\nthe ninth century to replace the hostel and chapel built there in the\r\nsixth century and overthrown by the Normans--the hostel where Gregory of\r\nTours had made a stay. The ancient Gothic portal and two bays falling to\r\ndecay were lopped off in 1560. The well we see in the courtyard was once\r\nwithin the church walls. Another well of miracle-working fame, on the\r\nnorth side, had a conduit to the altar. Passing through a door near the\r\nvestry we find ourselves on the site of the ancient _annexe_ of the\r\nhôtel-Dieu, razed a few years ago, and see on one side the chevet of the\r\nchurch with its quaint belfry and flight of steps on the roof, on the\r\nother a high, strong, moss-grown wall said to be a remnant of the\r\nboundary wall of Philippe-Auguste. In 1802 the church was given to the\r\nGreek Catholics of Paris--Melchites. The _iconostase_, therefore, very\r\nbeautiful, is an important feature. We see some very ancient statues,\r\nand a more modern one of Montyon, founder of the Virtue-prizes\r\nbestowed annually by the Académie Française.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HÔTEL LOUIS XV, RUE DE LA PARCHEMINERIE]\r\n\r\nIn Rue Galande, what remains of it, we see several interesting old\r\nhouses, and on the door of No. 42 a bas-relief showing St. Julien in a\r\nship. Rue du Fouarre, one side gone save for a single house, once Rue\r\ndes Escholiers, recalls the decree of Pope Urban V that students of the\r\nSchools must hear lectures humbly sitting on the ground on bundles of\r\nstraw which they were bound themselves to provide. Benches were too\r\nluxurious for the students of those days. In this street of the “Écoles\r\ndes Quatre Nations,” France, Normandie, Alsace, Picardie, Dante listened\r\nto the instruction of Brunetto Latini. No. 8 with its old door is on the\r\nsite of the “École de Normandie.” The street close by, named in memory\r\nof the great Italian poet, is modern. In Rue Domat stood, till the\r\nnineteenth century, the walls of the suppressed convent de Cornouailles\r\nfounded by a Breton in 1317. Rue des Anglais, the resort of English\r\nstudents from the time of Philippe-Auguste, was famous till recent days\r\nfor the Cabaret du Père Lunette, about to be razed. The first Père\r\nLunette went about his business wearing enormous spectacles. The second\r\nlandlord of the inn, gaining possession of its founder’s “specs,” wore\r\nthem as a badge, slung across his chest. Rue de l’hôtel Colbert has no\r\nreference to the statesman. In early times it was Rue des Rats. Rue des\r\nTrois-Portes recalls the thirteenth-century days when three houses only\r\nformed the street. No. 10, connected with No. 13 Rue de la Bûcherie, the\r\nlog-selling street, shows us the ancient “Faculté de Médicine,”\r\nsurrounded in past days by the garden, the first of the kind, where\r\nmedical men and medical students cultivated the herbs necessary for\r\ntheir physic. The interesting old Gothic structure, more than once\r\nthreatened with demolition, has been classed as an historical monument,\r\nunder State care therefore, and reconstructed as the Maison des\r\nÉtudiants. The students were very keen about the completion of their new\r\nhouse on its time-honoured site, and when the masons in course of\r\nreconstruction went on strike, the young men threw aside their books,\r\ndonned a workman’s jacket, or failing that doffed their coats and rolled\r\nup their shirt-sleeves and set to work with all youth’s ardour as\r\nbricklayers. Their zeal was greater, however, than their technical\r\nknowledge or their physical fitness, and their work left much to be\r\ndesired, as the French say. Then fortunately the strike ended.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST-JULIEN-LE-PAUVRE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BAS-RELIEF, RUE GALANDE]\r\n\r\nPlace Maubert, named after the second vicar of Ste-Geneviève, M. Aubert,\r\nwas the great meeting-place of students, and here Maître Albert, the\r\ndistinguished Dominican professor, surnamed “le Grand,” his name\r\nrecorded by a neighbouring street, gave his lectures in the open air.\r\nExecutions also took place here. In Impasse Maubert dwelt Ste-Croix, the\r\nlover and accomplice of the poisoner Mme de Brinvilliers, and in Rue des\r\nGrand Degrés Voltaire in his youth worked in a lawyer’s office. The\r\ncellars of Rue Maître-Albert are said to have been prison cells; at No.\r\n13 the negro page Zamor, whose denunciation led Mme Dubarry to the\r\nscaffold, died in misery in 1820. No. 16 was the meeting-place of the\r\nCommunards in 1871.\r\n\r\nRue de la Bièvre reminds us that the tributary of the Seine, now a\r\nturgid drain, closely covered, once joined the mother-river here.\r\nTradition says Dante made his abode here while in Paris. Over the door\r\nof No. 12 we see a statue of St-Michel slaying the dragon. This was\r\noriginally a college founded in his own house in 1348 by Guillaume de\r\nChanac, bishop of Paris, for twelve poor scholars of the diocese of\r\nLimoges.\r\n\r\nIn Rue des Bernardins we see the church St-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet,\r\nSt-Nicolas of the Thistle-field, built in the seventeenth century upon\r\nthe site of a thirteenth-century structure erected where till then\r\nthistles had run riot. It was designed by a parishioner of mark, the\r\npainter Lebrun, enriched by his paintings and those of other artists of\r\nnote. The tomb of his mother is within its walls and a monument to his\r\nmemory by Coysevox. Rue St-Victor recalls the abbey, once on the site\r\nwhere now we see the Halle-aux-Vins. There Maurice de Sulli, builder of\r\nNotre-Dame, died and was buried in 1196. Hither, to its famous school,\r\ncame Abelard, St. Thomas à Becket, St. Bernard. It was razed to the\r\nground in 1809. At Nos. 24-26 we saw till just recently the ancient\r\nseminary of St-Nicolas, closed since 1906, with its long rows of\r\nold-world windows, seventy-two panes on one story; the college buildings\r\nwere at the corner of Rue Pontoise, a street opened in 1772 as a\r\ncalf-market and named from the town noted for its excellent veal. And\r\nhere we find at No. 19 vestiges of the ancient convent of the\r\nBernardins. Rue de Poissy has more important remains of the convent and\r\nof its college, founded in 1245 by the English Abbé de Clairvaux,\r\nStephen Lexington, aided by a brother of St. Louis. The grand old walls\r\nnow serve as the Caserne des Pompiers--the Fire Station. Within we find\r\nbeautiful old-time Gothic work, a fine staircase, arched naves, tall,\r\nslender pillars--the refectory of the monks of yore; and beneath it\r\nvaulted cellars with some seventy pillars and ancient bays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nIN THE REGION OF THE SCHOOLS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SORBONNE AND ITS SURROUNDINGS\r\n\r\nWhen St. Louis was on the throne of France the physician attendant upon\r\nhis mother, la Reine Blanche, died bequeathing a sum of money for the\r\ninstitution of a college of theology. In consequence thereof Robert de\r\nSorbon built the school for theological study, a very simple erection\r\nthen, which developed into the great college adapted to studies of the\r\nmost varied character, known as the Sorbonne: that was in the year 1253.\r\nTwo hundred years later the first printing press in France was set up\r\nthere. In another nigh upon two hundred years Richelieu, elected Grand\r\nMaster of the college, built its church and rebuilt the surrounding\r\nstructure. Napoléon set the college in action on a vaster scale, after\r\nits suppression at the Revolution, by making it the seat of the Académie\r\nde Paris, the “home” of the Faculties of Letters and Science, as well as\r\nof Theology. But the edifice was then again crumbling--in need of\r\nrebuilding. Time passed, ruin made headway. Plans were made, and in 1853\r\nthe first stone of a new structure was laid. It remained a first stone\r\nand a last one for many years. The modern walls we see were not built\r\ntill the close of the nineteenth century, finished in 1901. In the great\r\ncourtyard white lines mark the site of Richelieu’s edifice. The vast\r\nbuilding is richly decorated with statuary and frescoes. In its church\r\nRichelieu seems still to hold sway. We see his coat-of-arms on every\r\nside; over his tomb, the work of Girardon, hangs his Cardinal’s hat.\r\nAnother handsome monument covers the tomb of his descendant, the\r\nminister of Louis XVIII. Many generations of Richelieu lie in the vault\r\nbeneath the chapel floor. The church is dismantled and partially\r\nsecularized. Grand classic concerts are held there during the Sundays of\r\nterm each year, but the Richelieu have still the right to be baptized,\r\nmarried, buried there; the altar therefore has not been undraped.\r\n\r\nExactly opposite the Sorbonne, on its Rue des Écoles side, is the\r\nbeautiful Musée de Cluny, on the site of the ancient Palais des Thermes\r\nof which the ruins are seen in the grounds bordered by the boulevard\r\nSt-Germain. The palace dates from Roman days. Julian was proclaimed\r\nEmperor there. We see an altar from the time of Tiberius. The remains of\r\nRoman baths--vestiges of the _frigidarium_, the _tepidarium_, the\r\n_hypocaustum_, traces of the pipes through which the water flowed are\r\nstill there. In the fourteenth century Pierre de Chaslun, Abbot of\r\nCluny, bought the ruins of the ancient palace, and the exquisite Gothic\r\nmansion we see was built close up against them. Many illustrious persons\r\nfound shelter within the home of the Abbots during the centuries that\r\nfollowed. James V of Scotland stayed there. Men of learning were made\r\nwelcome there. In later times its tower was used as an observatory. The\r\nRevolution put an end to the state and prestige of the beautiful\r\nmansion. It was sold, parcelled out to a number of buyers, put to all\r\nsorts of common and commercial uses, till, in 1833, M. de Sommerard,\r\nwhose name is given to the street on its northern side, acquired it\r\nand set up there his own precious collection of things beautiful, the\r\nnucleus of the Museum. The whole property was taken over later by the\r\nBeaux-Arts under State protection for conservation. In the garden\r\nnumerous interesting relics of ancient churches, that of St-Benoît which\r\nonce stood near, and others, are carefully preserved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LE MUSÉE DE CLUNY]\r\n\r\nRue Jean-de-Beauvais was in bygone days inhabited entirely by printers.\r\nThe Roumanian chapel there was the chapel of the famous College\r\nDormans-Beauvais, founded in 1370. Rue de Latran--modern--runs across\r\nthe site of the ancient _commanderie_ of the Knights of St. John of\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\nIn Rue des Carmes, dating from 1250, we see at No. 15 the ancient\r\nCollege des Lombards, now the Cercle Catholique d’Ouvriers, founded\r\n1334, rebuilt under Louis XIV by two Irish priests. The little chapel\r\nthere, dedicated now to “Jesus Ouvrier,” is paved with the gravestones\r\nof the Irish clergy who came of yore to live and study there.\r\n\r\nRue Basse des Carmes stretches across the site of the demolished\r\nCarmelite Convent. We are close now to the Collège de France, le Lycée\r\nLouis-le-Grand and l’École Polytechnique.\r\n\r\nLe Collège de France, Rue des Écoles, its beautiful west façade giving\r\non Rue St-Jacques, was founded as an institution by François I (1530);\r\nits lectures were to be given in different colleges. The edifice before\r\nus replaces this “Collège Royal,” built in the early years of the\r\nseventeenth century, destroyed in the eighteenth century. It dates from\r\n1778, the work of Chalgrin. Additions were made in the nineteenth\r\ncentury. The numerous finely executed busts of noted scholars and\r\neminent professors are the work of the best sculptors of each period.\r\n\r\nThe Lycée Louis-le-Grand, Rue St-Jacques, on the site of four colleges\r\nof bygone ages, dates in its foundation from 1550, rebuilt 1814-20,\r\nrestored 1861-85. In the court we see some of the ancient walls. It has\r\nborne different names characteristic of the different periods of the\r\nhistory of France. It began as the Collège de Clermont, from its\r\nfounder, the bishop; in 1682 it took the name of the King,\r\nLouis-le-Grand. In 1792 it became Collège de l’Égalité; in 1800, Le\r\nPyrtanée; Lycée Imperial in 1802; Collège Royal-Louis-le-Grand in 1814;\r\nLycée Descartes in 1848, to revert to its present designation in 1849.\r\nMany of the most eminent men of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries\r\nwere pupils there.\r\n\r\nThe Collège Ste-Barbe built in the sixteenth century was added to\r\nLouis-le-Grand in 1764. Its tower goes by the name Tour Calvin, for this\r\nwas the Huguenot quarter. Here many of the persecuted Protestants were\r\nin hiding at the Massacre of St. Bartholomew. Yet it was at Ste-Barbe\r\nthat Ignatius Loyola was educated.\r\n\r\nClose around Lycée Louis-le-Grand and the Collège de France, we find a\r\nnumber of twelfth-and thirteenth-century streets condemned to\r\ndemolition, some of their houses already razed, those that remain\r\nshowing many interesting relics. Rue du Cimetière-St-Benoît, which\r\nbordered the cemetery erewhile there; Rue Fromantel, the name a\r\ncorruption of _froid mantel_, or _manteau_, with its interesting\r\nold-world dwellings; Impasse Chartrière, where at No. 2 we see an old\r\nsign and a niche of the time of Henri IV, who was wont to visit his\r\n“belle Gabrielle” here. No. 11 was, it is said, the entrance to the\r\nKing’s stables. At the junction of Rue Lanneau four streets form the\r\nquadrangle where was erewhile the well “Certain,” so named after the\r\nvicar of the old church St-Hilaire, once close by, discovered beneath\r\nthe roadway in 1894. Roman remains of great interest were found at that\r\ntime below the surface of all these streets. Rue Valette, eleventh\r\ncentury, was once Rue des Sept Voies, for seven thoroughfares met there.\r\nAt No. 2, in the billiard-room of the old inn, we find vestiges of the\r\nchurch St-Hilaire, once there. No. 19 dates from the fourteenth century,\r\nand in the seventeenth century was a meeting-place of the Huguenots who\r\nhid in its Gothic two-storied cellars. In Rue Laplace lived Jean de\r\nMeung, author of _Le Roman de la Rose_. At No. 12 we see the entrance of\r\na vanished college, next door to which was the Collège des Écossais.\r\n\r\nL’École Polytechnique stands on the site of the college founded in 1304\r\nby Jeanne de Navarre, wife of Philippe le Bel, for seventy poor\r\nscholars. It was rebuilt in the fifteenth century. The last vestiges of\r\nthat rebuilding, a beautiful Gothic chapel, were swept away in 1875.\r\nTraces of a Roman cemetery were found in 1906. The present structure\r\ndates from the eighteenth century, the work of Gabriel. The house of the\r\nGénéral-Commandant is the ancient Collège de Boncourt, founded in 1357.\r\n\r\nIn Rue Clovis, at the summit of the Montagne Ste-Geneviève stands the\r\nLycée Henri IV, dating as a school from 1796, known for several\r\nsubsequent years as Lycée-Napoléon. It recalls vividly the abbey which\r\nonce stood there. Its tower, known as the “Tour de Clovis,” rises from\r\nthe foundations of the eleventh-century abbey tower and was for long\r\nused as the Paris Observatory. The college kitchen is one of the\r\nancient abbey cellars--cellars in three stories. Some of the walls\r\nbefore us date from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The library\r\nfounded by Cardinal de la Rochefoucauld is the boys’ dormitory. A\r\ncloister and seventeenth-century refectory are there intact. The pupils\r\ngo up and down a fine eighteenth-century staircase, and study amid\r\ninteresting frescoes and much beautiful woodwork. New buildings were\r\nadded to the ancient ones in 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nLA MONTAGNE STE-GENEVIÈVE\r\n\r\n\r\nRue de la Montagne Ste-Geneviève, leading to the hill-top from Boulevard\r\nSt-Germain, went in twelfth-century days by the unæsthetic name Rue des\r\nBoucheries. Nearly every wall, every stone is ancient. In past ages\r\nthree colleges at different positions stood on its incline. The sign at\r\nNo. 40 dates from the time of the Directoire. A statuette of the saint\r\nthere in Revolution days was labelled, “A la ci-devant Geneviève;\r\nRendez-vous des Sans-Culottes.” And now we have before us the beautiful\r\nold church St-Etienne-du-Mont. The _place_, in very early times a\r\ngraveyard, was laid out as a square in the fourteenth century and the\r\nchurch burial ground was on the north-western side. The present church\r\ndates as a whole from the early years of the seventeenth century, built\r\non the site of a thirteenth-century chapel dedicated to St-Etienne. The\r\n_abside_ and the choir were built in early sixteenth-century years,\r\nclose up against the old basilic of the abbey Ste-Geneviève. Among the\r\npeople the church is still often referred to as l’Église Ste-Geneviève,\r\nchiefly, no doubt, because the tomb of the patron saint of Paris is\r\nthere. The original _châsse_--a richly jewel-studded shrine--was\r\ndestroyed at the Revolution, melted down, its gems confiscated, the\r\nbones of the Saint burnt. The stone coffin cast aside as valueless was\r\nrecovered, filled with such relics of Ste-Geneviève as could be\r\ncollected from far and near, and is now in the sumptuous shrine to which\r\npilgrimages are continually made. A smaller _châsse_ is solemnly carried\r\nround the aisles of the church each year during the “neuvaine” following\r\nJanuary 3rd, the revered Saint’s fête day, when services are held all\r\nday long, while on the _place_ without a religious fair goes on ...\r\nsouvenirs of Ste-Geneviève and objects of piety of every description are\r\noffered for sale on the stalls set up upon the _place_ from end to end.\r\nThe church, showing three distinct styles of architecture, Romanesque,\r\nGothic, Renaissance, is especially remarkable for its rood-screen--the\r\nonly one left in a Paris church. It is rich, too, in exquisite stained\r\nglass, beautiful woodwork, fine statuary. We see inscriptions and\r\nepitaphs referring to Pascal, Rollin and many other men of note, buried\r\nin the church crypt or in the graveyard of past days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST-ÉTIENNE-DU-MONT]\r\n\r\nThe Panthéon, the most conspicuous if not the most ancient or most\r\nseductive building of this hill-top, was begun as a new church\r\nSte-Geneviève. Louis XV, lying dangerously ill at Metz, made a vow to\r\nbuild on his recovery a church dedicated to the patron saint of Paris.\r\nIt was not begun till 1755, not solidly constructed then; slips followed\r\nthe erection of its walls, threatening collapse, and Soufflot, the\r\narchitect, died of grief thereat. The catastrophe feared did not happen;\r\nthe building was consolidated. Instead, however, of remaining a church\r\nit was declared, in the Revolutionary year 1791, the Panthéon, with the\r\ninscription, “Aux Grands Hommes de France, la Patrie reconnaissante.”\r\nNapoléon restored it to the ecclesiastical authorities at the Concordat.\r\nIn 1830 it became again the Panthéon; was once more a church in\r\n1851--then the Panthéon for good--so far--in 1885, when the body of\r\nVictor Hugo was carried there in great state. Its façade is copied from\r\nthe Panthéon of Agrippa at Rome. It is noted for its frescoes\r\nillustrative of the life of Ste-Geneviève, by Gros, Chavannes, Laurens\r\nand other nineteenth-century artists. Rodin’s “Penseur” below the\r\nperistyle was put there in 1906.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF ST-ÉTIENNE-DU-MONT (JUBÉ)]\r\n\r\nThe Faculté de Droit, No. 10, is Soufflot’s work (1772-1823). The\r\nBibliothèque Ste-Geneviève, quite modern (1884), covers the site of the\r\ndemolished Collège Montaigu, founded in 1314. Ignatius Loyola, Erasmus\r\nand Calvin were pupils there. All the surrounding streets stretch along\r\nthe site of ancient buildings, convents, monasteries, etc., swept away\r\nbut leaving here and there interesting traces. In Rue Lhomond débris of\r\nthe potteries once there have been unearthed. Michelet lived for a time\r\nat the ancient hôtel de Flavacourt. No. 10, incorporated later in the\r\nÉcole Ste-Geneviève, of which the chief entrance door is a vestige of\r\nthe hôtel de Juigné, was the private abode of the Archbishop of Paris in\r\npre-Revolution days. Another part of the school was the home of Abbé\r\nEdgeworth, confessor to Louis XVI in his last days. Yet another was the\r\nSéminaire des Anglais, founded under Louis XIV. We find a fine façade\r\nand balconies in the courtyard at No. 29, once the abode of a religious\r\ncommunity, now the lay “Institution Lhomond.”\r\n\r\nThe Séminaire des Missions des Colonies Françaises at No. 30 dates from\r\nthe time of Louis XIV. Fine staircase and chapel. The cellars of the\r\nmodern houses from No. 48 to No. 54 are those of the convent which\r\nerewhile stood above them.\r\n\r\nIn Rue des Irlandais we see the college founded in 1755 for Irish,\r\nScottish and English priest-students. In Rue Rataud, once Rue des\r\nVignes, which led to a cemetery for persons who had died of the plague,\r\nis, at No. 3, the orphanage of l’Enfant Jésus, formerly “Les Cent\r\nFilles,” where the duchesse d’Angoulême, daughter of Louis XVI, had\r\nfifty young orphan girls educated yearly at her own expense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nIN THE VALLEY OF THE BIÈVRE\r\n\r\n\r\nEmphatically a street of the past is the old Rue Mouffetard, its name a\r\ncorruption perhaps of Mont Cérarius, the name of the district under the\r\nRomans, or derived maybe from the old word _mouffettes_, referring to\r\nthe exhalations of the Bièvre, flowing now below ground here, never very\r\nodorous since the days when, coming sweet and clear from the southern\r\nslopes, it was put to city uses, industrial and other, on entering\r\nParis. Every house along the course of this street has some curious\r\nold-time feature, an ancient sign, an old well, old doors, old\r\ncourtyards. Quaint old streets lead out of it. The market on the _place_\r\nby the old church St-Médard extends up its slope.\r\n\r\nIn the sordid shops which flourish on the ground-floor of almost every\r\nhouse, or on stalls set on the threshold, one sees an assortment of\r\nfoodstuffs rarely brought together in any other corner of the city, and\r\narticles of clothing of most varied kind and style and date.\r\n\r\nThe church dating from the twelfth century, partially rebuilt and\r\nrestored in later times, was for several centuries a dependency of the\r\nabbey Ste-Geneviève. Its graveyard, for long past a market-place and a\r\nsquare, was in the eighteenth century the scene of the notorious\r\n_scandale Médard_. Among the graves of noted Jansenists buried there\r\nmiraculous cures were supposed to take place. Women and girls fell into\r\necstasies. The number of these convulsionists grew daily. At last the\r\nKing, Louis XV, ordered the cemetery to be closed. A witty inhabitant of\r\nthe district managed to get near one of the tombstones the morning after\r\nthe King’s command was made known and wrote thereon:\r\n\r\n    “De par le Roi, défense à Dieu\r\n     De faire miracle en ce lieu.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUE MOUFFETARD ET ST-MÉDARD]\r\n\r\nIt is the parish of the Gobelins and a beautiful piece of Gobelins\r\ntapestry hangs over the vestry door. Fragments of ancient glass, a\r\npicture by Watteau, others by Philippe de Champaigne, beautiful woodwork\r\nand the quaintness of its architecture make the old church intensely\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\nAt No. 81 of this old-time street we find vestiges of a\r\nseventeenth-century chapel. At No. 52 ancient gravestones. The fountain\r\nat No. 60 dates from 1671. The house No. 9 is on the site of the Porte\r\nMarcel of bygone days.\r\n\r\nRue Broca, in the vicinity of St-Médard, dating from the twelfth\r\ncentury, when it was Rue de Lourcine, has many curious old houses. The\r\nhouses of Rue du Pôt-de-fer are all ancient, as are most of those in Rue\r\nSt-Médard. At No. 1 of Place de la Contre Scarpe close by, a modern\r\n_place_, an inscription marks the site of the Cabaret de la “Pomme de\r\nPin,” celebrated by the eulogies of Ronsard and Rabelais.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nRUE ST-JACQUES\r\n\r\n\r\nPassing amid the ancient colleges and churches, streets and houses we\r\nhave been visiting, runs the old Rue St-Jacques. It begins at the banks\r\nof the Seine, stretches through the whole arrondissement, to become on\r\nleaving it a faubourg.\r\n\r\nThe line it follows was in a long-past age the Roman road from Lutetia\r\nto Orléans--the Via Superior--_la grande rue_--of early Paris history.\r\nAlong its course in Roman times the Aqueduc d’Arcueil brought water from\r\nRungis to the Palace of the Thermes (_see_ p. 138). It is from end to\r\nend a long line of old-time buildings or vestiges of those swept away.\r\nThe famous couvent des Jacobins extended across the site of the\r\nBibliothèque de l’École de Droit and adjacent structures. At No. 172\r\nstood the Porte St-Jacques in Philippe-Auguste’s great wall.\r\n\r\nWe see a fine old door at No. 5, a house with two-storied cellars. At a\r\nhouse on the site of No. 218 Jean de Meung wrote the _Roman de la Rose_.\r\nThe famous poem was published lower down in the same street.\r\n\r\nThe church St-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas stands on the high ground we reach at\r\nNo. 252, a seventeenth-century structure on the site of a chapel built\r\nin the fourteenth century by the monks from Italy known as the\r\n_Pontifici_, makers of bridges constructed to give pilgrims the means\r\nof crossing a _mau pas_ or _mauvais pas_, i.e. a dangerous or difficult\r\npassage in rivers or roads. The beautiful woodwork within the\r\nchurch--that of the organ and pulpit--was brought here from the ancient,\r\ndemolished church St-Benoît (_see_ p. 140). We notice several good\r\npictures. The fine stained glass once here was all smashed at the\r\nRevolution. The hôpital Cochin memorizes in the name of its founder an\r\neighteenth-century vicar there. The churchyard was where Rue de\r\nl’Abbé-de-l’Épée now runs, known at one time as Ruelle du\r\nCimetière-St-Jacques.\r\n\r\nNo. 254 _bis_, the national Deaf and Dumb Institution, is the ancient\r\n_commanderie_ of the Frères hospitaliers de St-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas--the\r\nPontifici--given for the purpose in 1790, partly rebuilt in 1823. The\r\nstatue of Abbé de l’Épée, inventor of the alphabet for the deaf and\r\ndumb, in the court is the work of a deaf and dumb sculptor. The trunk of\r\nthe tree we see near it is said to be that of an elm planted there by\r\nSully three hundred years ago. At No. 262 we see vestiges of a\r\n_vacherie_, once the farm St-Jacques. At No. 261 we may turn into Rue\r\ndes Feuillantines, where at No. 10 we see vestiges of the convent that\r\nwas at one time in part the abode of George Sand, then of Mme Hugo,\r\nmother of the poet, and her children; later Jules Sardou lived in the\r\n_impasse_, now merged in the _rue_. At No. 269 we find some walls of the\r\nmonastery founded by English Benedictines in 1640, to which a few years\r\nlater they added a chapel dedicated to St. Edmond. The fabric is still\r\nthe property of English bishops. It is used as a great music school:\r\n“Maison de la Schola Cantorum.” The door seen between two fine old\r\npillars at No. 284 led in olden days to the Carmelite convent where\r\nLouise de la Vallière took definite refuge and acted as “sacristan”\r\ntill her death; Rue du Val-de-Grâce runs where the convent stood.[D]\r\n\r\nThe military hospital Val-de-Grâce was founded as a convent early in the\r\nseventeenth century. Anne d’Autriche installed there the impoverished\r\nBenedictines of Val Parfond, or Profond, evacuated from their quarters\r\nhard by owing to an inundation from the Bièvre. In their gratitude they\r\nchanged their name: the nuns of Val Profond became sisters of\r\nVal-de-Grâce. In 1645 Louis XIV, the child Anne d’Autriche had so\r\nardently prayed for laid the first stone of the chapel dome, built on\r\nthe model of St. Peter’s at Rome. The church is now used only for\r\nfunerals and indispensable military services. The dependency of\r\nVal-de-Grâce was built by Catherine de’ Medici, the catacombs lie below\r\nit and the surrounding houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nLE JARDIN DES PLANTES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in the early years of the seventeenth century that the King’s\r\nphysician bought a piece of waste ground--a _butte_ formed of the refuse\r\nof centuries accumulated there--for the culture of the multitudinous\r\nherbs and plants which made up the pharmacopia of the age. Thus was born\r\nthe “Jardin Royal de herbes médicinales” laid out in 1626. Chairs of\r\nbotany, pharmacy, surgery were instituted and endowed, and in 1650 the\r\ngarden was thrown open to the public. A century later Buffon was named\r\nsuperintendent of the royal garden. He set himself to reorganize and\r\nenlarge. The amphitheatre, the natural history galleries, the chemistry\r\nlaboratories, the fine lime-tree avenue are all due to him.\r\nDistinguished naturalists succeeded one another as directors of the\r\ngarden, and after the death of Louis XVI a museum of natural history and\r\na menagerie were set up with what was left of the King’s collection at\r\nVersailles. Additions and improvements were made in succeeding years\r\ntill, after the outbreak of war in 1870, the Jardin was bombarded by the\r\nPrussians, and during the siege its live-stock largely drawn upon to\r\nfeed the population of Paris. The garden and its buildings have been\r\nadded to frequently. The labyrinth is on the site of the hillock bought\r\nby Guy de la Brosse, who first laid it out. A granite statue marks the\r\nspot where he and two notable travellers were buried. Surrounding\r\nstreets record the names of great naturalists of different epochs.\r\n\r\nIn Rue Geoffroy St-Hilaire, once Rue Jardin du Roi, No. 5, now the\r\nPolice Station, was built in 1760. At No. 30 a wheel once worked turned\r\nby the water of the Bièvre, now a malodorous drain-stream hidden beneath\r\nthe pavement. No. 36 was Buffon’s home. Here he died in 1788. At No. 37\r\nlived Daubenton. At No. 38 stood in olden days the great gate, the\r\nPorte-Royale, of the Jardin du Roi, with to its left the hall, a narrow\r\nspace at that time, where the great surgeon Dionis described to a\r\nmarvelling assembly of students his wonderful discoveries (1672-73).\r\nThat small _cabinet_ was the nucleus of the great anthropological museum\r\nof succeeding centuries.\r\n\r\nIn Rue Cuvier, in its early days Rue Derrière-les-Murs de Ste-Victoire,\r\ndescribing accurately its situation, we see at No. 20 a modern fountain\r\n(1840) on the site of one put there in 1671 and traces of the abbey\r\nSt-Victor in the courtyard. The pavilion “de l’Administration” of the\r\nGarden is the ancient hôtel Jean Debray (1650), inhabited subsequently\r\nby several men of note. At No. 47 Cuvier died in 1832. In the\r\neighteenth-century _fiacres_, a recently introduced manner of getting\r\nabout, were to be hired at No. 45. The eleventh-century Rue Linné shows\r\nmany vestiges of the past. We see Gothic arches of the vanished abbey at\r\nNo. 4.\r\n\r\nIn Rue des Fossés St-Bernard, stretching along the line of\r\nPhilippe-Auguste’s wall, between the site of two great gates: Porte\r\nSt-Victor, a spot desecrated by the massacres of September, and Porte\r\nSt-Bernard, we see Halle-aux-Vins, where abbey buildings stood of yore.\r\nThe Halle-aux-Cuirs, in Rue Censier, is on the site of the famous\r\norphanage “La Miséricorde,” called vulgarly “les Cent Filles” or “les\r\nCent Vierges.” The apprentice from the Arts and Crafts Institution, who\r\nshould choose one of these orphan maidens for his wife, obtained as her\r\ndowry the privilege of becoming at once a full member of the\r\nCorporation.\r\n\r\nIn Rue de la Clef we have at No. 56 the site of part of the notorious\r\nprison Ste-Pélagie. No. 26 is still owned by the Savouré, whose\r\nancestors kept the school where Jerôme Bonaparte and many of his\r\ncompeers were educated. Rue du Fer-à-Moulin, dating from the twelfth\r\ncentury, a stretch of blackened walls, has been known by many names. In\r\nthe little Rue Scipion leading out of it we see at No. 13 the _hôtel_\r\nbuilt in the sixteenth century for the Tuscan, Scipion Sardini, who came\r\nto France in the suite of Catherine de’ Medici, a rich and rather\r\nscandalous financier; terra-cotta medallions ornament its walls. It\r\nserves now as the bakehouse of the Paris hospitals. In the square\r\nopposite we see the curious piece of statuary: “des Boulangers,” by\r\nCharpentier.\r\n\r\nRue Monge, running from boulevard St-Germain to Avenue des Gobelins, was\r\ncut through old streets of the district in 1859. A fountain Louis XV\r\nbrought here from its original site, Rue Childebert, was set up in the\r\nsquare, and many other old-time relics: statues from the ancient hôtel\r\nde Ville, débris from the Palais de l’Industrie, burnt down in 1897; a\r\ncopy of the statue of Voltaire by Houdin, etc.\r\n\r\nRue d’Arras, so named from a college once there, began as Rue des Murs,\r\nreferring to the walls of Philippe-Auguste. The concert hall we see was\r\nnot long ago Père Loyson’s church. L’École Communale, No. 19 Rue des\r\nBoulangers, is on the site of part of the convent des “Filles\r\nAnglaises,” which had existed there from 1644--razed in 1861.\r\n\r\nRue Rollin began in the sixteenth century as Rue des Moulins-à-vent. On\r\nthe site of the house at No. 2 Pascal died in 1662. No. 4, with its fine\r\nstaircase, its _grille_ and ancient well in the courtyard, was the home\r\nof Bernardine de St. Pierre, during the years he wrote his world-known\r\n_Paul and Virginie_. Rollin lived and died (1741) at No. 8. Descartes\r\nlived at No. 14. When the street was longer and known as Rue\r\nNeuve-St-Etienne, Manon Philipon, Madame Roland of later days, was a\r\npupil in the _annexe_ of the English Augustine convent on a site crossed\r\nnow by Rue Monge and Rue de Navarre.\r\n\r\nIn Rue de Navarre we come to Les Arènes, the disinterred remains of the\r\nRoman Arena. They were discovered here just before the war of 1870, then\r\nquickly covered up to be in part restored to daylight in 1883. We see\r\nbefore us the grey stones, huge blocks and graduated step-like seats\r\nwhere the population of the city--Lutetians then--passed their hours of\r\nrecreation watching the conflicts of wild beasts. It is not, perhaps,\r\nthe original arena built here by the Romans, for that was attacked\r\ntwice, first by the northern invaders, then by the Christians, many of\r\nits stones used to build the city walls. It was, however, soon restored\r\n... evidently. In the course of subsequent invasions, conquests, new\r\nsettlements, constructions and the lapse of years, the Roman theatre\r\nsank beneath the surface to be unearthed in nineteenth-century days.\r\nModern garden paths and a grand but inharmonious entrance in Louis XIV\r\nstyle now surround this supremely interesting vestige of a long-gone\r\nage. Children play where savage beasts once fought. Women knit and sew,\r\nold men rest, young men and maidens woo, where Roman soldiers and a\r\nprimitive Gallic population once eagerly gathered to watch fierce\r\ncombats.[E]\r\n\r\nRue Lacépède: here at No. 1 stood till recently the Hôpital de la Pitié,\r\nfounded by Marie de’ Medici in 1613, now replaced by a modern building\r\nin the boulevard de l’Hôpital. Its primary destination was a shelter for\r\nbeggars--a refuge--in order to free Paris from the swarms who “gained\r\ntheir living” by soliciting alms in the streets. The beggars preferred\r\ntheir liberty. By an edict of some years later, however, beggars were\r\ntaken there and closely shut up, safely guarded. They were called in\r\nconsequence “les Enfermés.” The hospital grew in extent and importance\r\nand was called “Notre-Dame de la Pitié.” The convent Ste-Pélagie was\r\norganized in a part of its buildings, in 1660, to become at the\r\nRevolution the notorious prison. No. 7 is a handsome eighteenth-century\r\n_hôtel_. Rue Gracieuse has brought down to our time the graceful name of\r\na family who lived there in the thirteenth century and some ancient\r\nhouses. In Rue du Puits de l’Ermite lived the sculptors Coysevox,\r\nCoustou, and the painter Bourdon. The hospice for aged poor in Rue de\r\nl’Épée-de-Bois was formerly an _asile_ founded by Sœur Rosalie, known\r\nfor her self-sacrificing work among the cholera-stricken in 1832, and\r\nduring the Revolution of 1848. The very name Rue des Patriarches bids us\r\nlook for vestiges of past ages. The patriarchs, thus memorized, were\r\ntwo fourteenth-century ecclesiastics, one bishop of Paris and\r\nAlexandria, the other of Jerusalem, who dwelt in a fine old _hôtel_, the\r\nbig courtyard of which has become a market-place, while the street named\r\nafter them and a curious _impasse_ stretch across the site of the razed\r\nmansion. The district was a centre of Calvinism during the religious\r\nstruggles. The bishop’s old house, “hôtel Chanac,” sheltered numerous\r\nProtestants, and religious services were held there.\r\n\r\nRue de l’Arbalète carries us back to the days when archers had their\r\ngarden and training-ground here. Later an apothecary’s garden was laid\r\nout where now we see the extensive modern buildings of the Institut\r\nAgronomique. A pharmaceutical school was built in this old street and\r\nmedicinal herbs were cultivated from the end of the fifteenth and early\r\nyears of the sixteenth centuries. Remains of a Roman cemetery were found\r\nsome years ago beneath the paving-stones near No. 16.\r\n\r\nIn Rue Daubenton we find the presbytery and ancient side-entrance of\r\nSt-Médard, and in the old wall distinct traces of two great gates which\r\nled to the churchyard. Traces of past time are seen also in Rue de la\r\nPitié, where at No. 3 Robespierre’s sister lived and, in 1834, died.\r\n\r\nRue Cardinal-Lemoine begins across the site of the college founded by\r\nthe Cardinal in 1302, suppressed at the Revolution, used subsequently as\r\na barracks, then razed. The wall of Philippe-Auguste passed on the site\r\nof No. 26. Beneath the house a curious leaden coffin was found in 1908.\r\nAt No. 49 we see the handsome but dilapidated façade of the house of the\r\npainter Lebrun, where also Watteau lived for a time. Here the Dames\r\nAnglaises had their well-known convent from 1644 to 1859, when they\r\nmoved to Neuilly. At the Revolution the convent was confiscated, yet\r\nMass was said daily in the chapel through the Terror (_see_ pp. 11, 28).\r\n\r\nAt No. 65 we see the Collège des Écossais, founded in 1325 by David,\r\nbishop of Moray, to which a second foundation due to the bishop of\r\nGlasgow, 1639, was added, transferred here from Rue des Armendiers, by\r\nRobert Barclay in 1662. Suppressed in 1792, it was used as a prison\r\nunder the Terror but restored to the Scots when Revolution days were\r\nover. The seventeenth-century chapel still stands and the heart of James\r\nII is in a casket there. The college staircase, left untouched, is\r\nremarkably fine. Close by, at the end of Rue Thouin, in what was\r\nformerly Place Fourcy, the brothers Perrault, one the famous architect,\r\nthe other yet more universally known--the writer of fairy tales--lived\r\nand died. Rue de l’Estrapade recalls the days when, on the _place_ hard\r\nby, rebellious soldiers were punished by being hoisted to the top of a\r\npole, their hands tied behind their back, then let fall to the ground.\r\nOld-time vestiges are seen all along the street. Rue Clotilde crosses\r\nwhat were once the grounds of the abbey Ste-Geneviève.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE LUXEMBOURG\r\n\r\n\r\nARRONDISSEMENT VI. (LUXEMBOURG)\r\n\r\nThe palace that gives its name to the arrondissement was founded by\r\nMarie de’ Medici and built on the model of the Pitti palace at Florence\r\nby Salomon de Brosse between the years 1615-20. The site chosen was in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the vast monastery and extensive grounds of the\r\nChartreux. The duc de Luxembourg had an _hôtel_ there. It was sold to\r\nthe Queen and razed; but vainly was the new edifice on the spot called\r\nby its builder “Palais Médicis.” The name of the razed mansion prevailed\r\nover that of the Queen.\r\n\r\nA garden was begun in 1613 on a space in the Abbey grounds where, in a\r\nprevious age, a Roman camp had stretched.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JARDIN ET PALAIS DU LUXEMBOURG]\r\n\r\nMarie left the palace to her second son, Gaston d’Orléans. It was the\r\nabode of various royal personages till the outbreak of the Revolution.\r\nThen it became a prison. Camille Desmoulins and many of his compeers\r\nwere shut up there. The Chartreux fled and their monastery was levelled\r\nwith the ground. The Terror over, the palace became successively Palais\r\ndes Directeurs, Sénat Conservateur, Chambre des Pairs and, in 1852,\r\nSénat Impérial. After Sedan it became the Sénat de la République. The\r\ngardens were extended across the property of the Chartreux. They are\r\nbeautiful gardens. The Renaissance fountain is the work of Jacques de\r\nBrosse. The statues we see on every side among the lawns and the\r\nflower-beds, in the shady alleys, most of them the work of noted\r\nsculptors, show us famous men and women of every period of French\r\nhistory from Ste-Bathilde and Ste-Geneviève to our own day.\r\n\r\nThe Petit Luxembourg is also due to Marie de’ Medici, built a few years\r\nafter the completion of the larger palace. From the day of its\r\ninauguration by Richelieu it knew many inhabitants of note: Barras,\r\nBuonaparte and Joséphine, etc., sojourned there. It was used at one time\r\nas a senate house, then as a Préfecture. We see in an adjacent wall a\r\nmarble _mètre_--the standard measure put there under the Directoire.\r\nFinally the mansion was chosen as the official residence of the\r\npresident of the Senate.\r\n\r\nRue Vaugirard, on which the chief entrance of both these palaces open,\r\nis the longest street in Paris and one of the oldest. It is, like many\r\nanother long Paris street, made up of several thoroughfares once\r\ndistinct. The first of these, Rue du Val-Girad, led from the village\r\nnamed from its chief landowner, an abbé of St-Germain-des-Prés, Gérard\r\nde Meul. In close proximity to the Palace is the Odéon, the Second\r\nThéâtre-Français, once the “Français” itself, built in 1782, on the site\r\nof the hôtel de Condé, burnt down in 1799, rebuilt by Chalgrin, reopened\r\nin 1808 as théâtre de l’Impératrice, badly burnt a few years later,\r\nrestored as the théâtre Français, then again restored in 1875. The\r\n_place_ surrounding the theatre and the streets opening out of it are\r\nrich in historic and literary associations. No. 1, Café Voltaire, was a\r\nmeeting-place of eighteenth-century men of letters of every class and\r\ntype. At No. 2 lived Camille Desmoulins and his Lucile. There he was\r\narrested. In Rue Rotrou, No. 4, now a well-known bookseller’s shop, was\r\nonce the famous Café Tabourey. André Chenier lived in Rue Corneille. Rue\r\nTournon was opened in 1540, across the site of a horse-market bearing\r\nthe realistic name Pré-Crotté, on land belonging to the Chapter of\r\nSt-Germain-des-Prés, and named after its abbé, Cardinal de Tournon. At\r\nNo. 2, hôtel Chatillon (seventeenth century), Balzac passed three years,\r\n1827-30. No. 4 dates from the days of Louis XIV as hôtel Jean de\r\nPalaiseau, later hôtel Montmorency. Lamartine lived here in 1848. At No.\r\n5 lived and died the notorious _devineresse_ Mlle Lenormand, “sybille de\r\nl’Impératrice Joséphine.” Another prophetess, Mme Moreau, lived here in\r\nthe time of Napoléon III. No. 7, hôtel du Sénat et des Nations,\r\nsheltered Gambetta for a time, also Alphonse Daudet. At No. 6, hôtel de\r\nBrancas (1540), inhabited in its early years by the duchesse de\r\nMontpensier, rebuilt under the Regency, we see a very fine staircase and\r\nfrescoed boudoir. Pacha lived for some years at No. 13. No. 8 dates from\r\n1713, on the site of a more recent _hôtel_. At No. 10, hôtel Concini,\r\nLouis XIII lived for a time to be near his mother, Marie de’ Medici, at\r\nthe Luxembourg. St. François de Sales stayed here. It served as the\r\nhôtel des Ambassadeurs Extraordinaires (1630-1748), was sequestered at\r\nthe Revolution; then became a barracks as it is to-day. At No. 19 the\r\nScot, Admiral Jones, famous for his help in the American War of\r\nIndependence, died in 1791; his bones were taken to America in 1905. No.\r\n33, the well-known restaurant Foyot, was in old days hôtel de Tréville,\r\nwhere royalties sometimes dined incognito. At No. 19 we come to an old\r\ncuriosity shop surmounted by a barber’s pole, and on the doorpost we\r\nread the words, with their delicate flavour of irony:\r\n\r\n    “Ici Monsieur Tussieu barbier,\r\n     Rase le Sénat,\r\n     Accommode la Sorbonne,\r\n     Frise l’Académie.”\r\n\r\nWhen the recent war was on the patriotic barber posted up in French, in\r\nGreek, in Latin, other words, the following:\r\n\r\n    “Bulgares de Malheur,\r\n     Turques, Austro-Hongrois, Boches,\r\n     Ne comptez sur Tussieu\r\n     Pour tondre vos caboches.”\r\n\r\nHe died a few months ago, leaving to his widow his shop full of valuable\r\nantiquities.\r\n\r\nRue Garancière owes its euphonious name to a notable sixteenth-century\r\nfirm of dyers--la Maison Garance was on the site of the present\r\npublishing house Plon. In the seventeenth century the Garance hôtel was\r\nrebuilt as a mansion for the Breton bishop, René de Rieux. After the\r\nRevolution it was for thirty years the Mairie of the district. The words\r\n“stationnement de nuit pour huit tonneaux” on the wall at No. 9 refer to\r\na vanished market fountain. The Dental School at No. 5 was originally\r\nthe home of Népomacène Lemercier. Passing through Rue Palatine\r\nmemorizing Charlotte de Bavière, widow of Henri de Bourbon, who lived at\r\none time at the Luxembourg, we turn down Rue Servandoni, so named in\r\nrecent times in honour of the architect of the façade of the church\r\nSt-Sulpice, who died in a house opposite No. 1 (1766). Among the\r\nbas-reliefs at No. 14 is one of Servandoni unrolling a plan of\r\nSt-Sulpice. We see on every side some interesting vestiges of the past.\r\nRue Canivet and Rue Férou show many old houses. Rue du Luxembourg is\r\nmodern, built along what was once a shady alley of the garden. The Café\r\nat No. 1, Rue Fleurus, was erewhile the meeting-place of great artists:\r\nCorot, Murger and others of their time. Rue Auguste Comte is another\r\nmodern street along an old alley of the garden.\r\n\r\nRue d’Assas, across the garden at one point, runs through the whole of\r\nthis arrondissement over what were once the grounds of the two old\r\nconvents: the Carmes and Cherche-Midi; it shows a few ancient houses.\r\nNo. 8 is eighteenth century. No. 19, l’Institut Catholique, is the\r\nancient Carmelite convent. George Sand lived in a house once on the site\r\nof No. 28, and Foucault, a celebrated physician who made, besides, the\r\nnotable proof of the earth’s rotation by the movement of a pendulum,\r\ndied here in 1868. Littré the great lexicographer died at No. 44.\r\nMichelet at No. 76.\r\n\r\nTurning again into Rue Vaugirard we find at No. 36, the house built for\r\nthe household staff of the Princesse Palatine, its kitchen communicating\r\nwith the Petit Luxembourg by an underground passage; at No. 19 remains\r\nof the couvent des Dames Benedictines du Calvaire, founded 1619, and on\r\nthe site of the Orangery, the Musée du Luxembourg, inaugurated in 1818,\r\nwhich grew out of the exhibition in 1750 of a hundred pictures in\r\npossession of the King. Massenet lived and died at No. 48. No. 50, hôtel\r\nde Trémouille, called in Revolutionary times hôtel de la Fraternité,\r\nwhere Mme de Lafayette died in 1692. Nos. 52 and 54 are ancient, 56 was\r\nthe hôtel Kervessan (1700). We reach at No. 70 the old convent of the\r\nCarmes Déchaussés.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nLES CARMES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tragic story of “les Carmes” has been repeatedly told. The convent\r\nwas founded in 1613 by Princesse de Conti and la Maréchale d’Ancre for\r\nthe Carmes Déchaussés, who hailed from Rome. The first stone of their\r\nchapel here, dedicated to St. Joseph, was laid by Marie de’ Medici; its\r\ndome was the first dome built in Paris; Italian masters painted frescoes\r\non its walls. The Order became very popular among Parisians who liked\r\nthe _eau de Mélisse_, which it was the nuns’ business, in the secular\r\nline, to make and sell, and they were respected for their goodness to\r\nthe poor. When the horrors of the Revolution were filling the city with\r\nblood, the Carmes were left unmolested, some even hidden away in secret\r\ncorners of the convent with the connivance of Revolutionary chiefs. Then\r\npriests who refused to take the oath of allegiance were shut up there\r\nand to-day we see, in the old crypt, the bones of more than a hundred of\r\nthem, slain by a band led by a revolutionist known as “Tape-dur”--strike-hard.\r\nA prison during the Terror, Mme Tallien, Joséphine de Beauharnais, and\r\nmore than seven hundred others were shut up there, led forth thence,\r\nmany of them, to execution. These tragic scenes overpast, the convent\r\nwas let to a manager of public fêtes: its big hall became a ballroom,\r\n“le bal des Marronniers.” That wonderful woman Camille de Soyecourt,\r\nSœur Camille, who had previously re-organized the convent, bought it\r\nback in 1797. The garden-shed where the bodies of the murdered priests\r\nhad lain was made into a memorial-chapel, razed in 1867. Then the\r\npriests’ bones were carried to the crypt where we now see them. Every\r\nyear in the first week of September, anniversary of the Massacre,\r\nthe convent, the crypt and the ancient garden, little changed from\r\nRevolution days, are thrown open to the public, where besides the\r\nbones of the massacred priests many interesting tombs and relics are\r\nreverently cared for. It was at the Institut Catholique in the old\r\nCarmelite buildings that the principle of wireless telegraphy was\r\ndiscovered, in 1890.\r\n\r\nThe ancient burial-ground of St-Sulpice lies beneath the buildings Nos.\r\n100-102 of the long Rue Vaugirard. No. 104, the Salle Montalembert, is\r\nthe ancient convent of the Pères Maristes. At No. 85 we see an old-time\r\nboundary-stone and bas-reliefs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nON ANCIENT ABBEY GROUND\r\n\r\n\r\nNumerous ancient streets and some modern ones, on time-honoured ground,\r\nlead out of Rue Vaugirard. Rue Bonaparte, extending to the banks of the\r\nSeine, was formed in 1852 of three old streets. Most of its houses are\r\nancient or show vestiges of past ages and have historic associations. At\r\nNo. 45 Gambetta dwelt in 1866. No. 36 was the home of Auguste Comte; on\r\nthe site of No. 35 was the kitchen of the great abbey St-Germain-des-Prés,\r\nwhich stretched across the course of many streets in this district\r\n(_see_ p. 201). No. 20, l’hôtel du duc de Vendôme, son of Henri IV and\r\nGabrielle d’Estrées. No. 19, hôtel de Rohan-Rochefort, where the wife of\r\nthe unfortunate due d’Enghien, shot at Vincennes, used to receive her\r\nexiled husband in secret when he came in disguise to Paris. No. 17 is\r\nnoted as the office till recent years of the _Revue des Deux Mondes_,\r\nfirst issued there in 1829 as a magazine of travel!\r\n\r\nNo. 14, École Nationale des Beaux-Arts, on the site of the convent des\r\nPetits-Augustins, founded by Margaret de Valois in 1605, of which some\r\nwalls remain and to which in the nineteenth century were added the\r\nhôtels de Conti and de Bouillon, the latter known as hôtel de Chimay.\r\nThe nucleus of the works of art here seen was a collection of sculptures\r\nand other precious relics saved from buildings shattered or suppressed\r\nin the days of the Revolution, reverently laid in what was called at\r\nfirst a _dépôt des ruines des Monuments_. The word _ruines_ was soon\r\nomitted and the _dépôt_ became the Musée des Monuments Français, under\r\nthe able direction of Lenoir. But ruins are still to be seen there,\r\nsplendid and historic ruins--the façade of the château d’Anet, built for\r\nDiane de Poitiers, and remains of many another superb _hôtel_ of bygone\r\nages. A beautiful chapel, paintings by Delaroche, and Ingres, statuary,\r\nmouldings of Grecian and Roman sculpture, are among the treasures of the\r\nBeaux-Arts. Nos. 1 and 3, forming l’hôtel de Chevandon, was inhabited at\r\none time by vicomte de Beauharnais, the Empress Joséphine’s first\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: L’ABBAYE ST-GERMAIN-DES-PRÉS]\r\n\r\nRue des Beaux-Arts, opened a century ago, has ever been the habitation\r\nof distinguished artists and men of letters. Rue Visconti, cut across\r\nthe Petit Pré-aux-Clercs, the Students’ Fields, in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, bore till the middle of the nineteenth century the more\r\ncharacteristic name Rue des Marais-St-Germain. The Visconti it\r\nmemoralizes was the architect of Napoléon’s tomb and of restoration work\r\nat the Louvre. In its early years it was a resort of Huguenots, and\r\nknown therefore as the “Petite Genève.” It is very narrow and nearly\r\nevery house is ancient; Racine died either at No. 13 or at 21. No. 17\r\nwas the printing-house founded by de Balzac, to whom it brought ruin.\r\nNo. 21, hôtel de Ranes.\r\n\r\nRue Jacob, lengthened in the nineteenth century by the Rue Colombier,\r\nancient Chemin-aux-Clercs, owes its name to a chapel built by Margaret\r\nde Valois, la Reine Margot--dedicated to the Hebrew patriarch in\r\nfulfilment of a vow when the Queen was kept in durance in Auvergne. The\r\nstreet has always been the habitation of notable men of letters,\r\nartists, etc. Sterne lived at No. 46. No. 47, Hôpital de la Charité,\r\nanother of Marie de’ Medici’s foundations, was built for the Frères de\r\nSt-Jean-de-Dieu. The firm of chemists at No. 48--Rouelle--dates from\r\n1750, formerly on the opposite side of the street. At No. 19 we see in\r\nthe courtyard vestiges of the old abbey infirmary. The abbey gardens\r\nstretched across the site of several houses here. No. 26, hôtel Lefèvre\r\nd’Ormesson (1710). At No. 22 there is an eighteenth-century structure in\r\nthe court called “temple de l’Amitié.” At No. 20 dwelt the great\r\neighteenth-century actress, Adrienne Lecouvreur. In Rue Furstemburg we\r\nfind vestiges of the abbey stables and coach-house.\r\n\r\nRue de l’Abbaye, opened in the last year of the eighteenth century,\r\nstretches across a line once in the heart of the famous abbey grounds.\r\nThe first church on the site of the fine old edifice we see there now,\r\nwas built under the direction of Germain, bishop of Paris, in the time\r\nof Childebert, about the middle of the sixth century, dedicated to\r\nSt-Vincent and known as St-Vincent et Ste-Croix, on account of its\r\ncrucifix form. Bishop Germain added a monastery. In the ninth century\r\ncame the devastating Normans. The church and convent were destroyed to\r\nbe rebuilt on so grand and extensive a scale two centuries later,\r\nstrongly fortified, surrounded by a moat, watch-towers, etc.--a\r\nmasterpiece of thirteenth-century architecture. In the eighteenth\r\ncentury the abbey prison was taken over by the State, the Garde\r\nFrançaise lodged there. In September, 1792 Mme Roland, Charlotte Corday\r\nand many another notable prisoner of those terrible days were shut up\r\nwithin its walls. The fine library and beautiful refectory were burnt\r\nand there, that fatal September, saw some three hundred victims of\r\nRevolutionary fury put to death, the greater number slain on the spot\r\nwhere Rue Buonaparte touches the _place_ in front of the church. The\r\nprison stood till 1857. The church is full within as without of\r\nintensely interesting architectural and historic features: its tower is\r\nthe most ancient church tower of the city. In the little garden square\r\nwe see the ruins of the lady-chapel built by Pierre de Montereau,\r\narchitect of the Ste-Chapelle. The Gothic roof, the round-arched nave,\r\nthe splendid chapel of the Sacré-Cœur, once the church choir, with\r\nits pillars coloured deep red, the wonderful capitals of the chancel,\r\nthe old glass in the chapel Ste-Geneviève, the tombs and the statues,\r\nand Flandrin’s glorious frescoes, all appeal to the lover of the\r\nbeautiful and the historic. Of the houses in the vicinity of the church\r\nmany are ancient, others are on the site of abbey buildings swept away.\r\nNo. 3 Rue de l’Abbaye, the abbey palace, dates from 1586, built with a\r\nsubterranean passage by Cardinal Charles de Bourbon. The last abbot who\r\ndwelt there was Casimir, King of Poland, whose tomb is in the church. In\r\nmodern times it has served as a studio and is now a dispensary. At No.\r\n13 we see the last traces of the monastery with its thirteenth-century\r\ncloister. At No. 15 Rue St-Benoît are the remains of an old tower; at\r\nNo. 11 vestiges of an ancient wall; at No. 2, an old house once the\r\nabode of Marc Orry, a famous printer of the days of Henri IV. Through\r\npipes down this old street water once flowed from the Seine to the\r\nabbey, and it went by the name Rue de l’Égout. The painter of the last\r\nportrait of Marie-Antoinette lived for some time at No. 17.\r\n\r\nRue du Four, i.e. Oven Street, the site in olden days of the abbey\r\nbakehouse, and one of the most important streets of the abbey precincts,\r\nbearing in its early days the royal name Chaussée du Roi, has been\r\nalmost entirely rebuilt in modern times. Here and there we find traces\r\nof another age. Robespierre lived here.\r\n\r\nRue du Vieux-Colombier, recalling by its name the abbey dove-cot, has\r\nknown among its inhabitants Boileau, Lesage, the husband of Mme\r\nRécamier. Few ancient houses are left there now. We see bas-reliefs at\r\nNo. 1.\r\n\r\nRue de Mézières is so called from the hôtel Mézières given in 1610 to\r\nthe Jesuits as their _noviciat_. No. 9 is ancient. Rue Madame, which it\r\ncrosses, existed under different names from the sixteenth century, part\r\nof it as Rue du Gindre, a reference to the abbey bakehouse once near,\r\nfor a _gindre_ is the baker’s chief man. The name of Madame was given in\r\n1790 to the part newly opened across the Luxembourg gardens by the new\r\noccupant of the palace, the comte de Province, brother of Louis XVI, in\r\nhonour of his wife. That did not hinder the count from building in the\r\nsame street a fine mansion for his mistress, comtesse de Balbi, razed\r\nsome years ago. Flandrin lived at No. 54. Renan at No. 55. Rue Cassette\r\nshows us a series of past-time houses, many of them associated with the\r\nmemory of notable persons of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\r\nAlfred de Musset lived there. No. 12 was in the hands of the Carmelites\r\ntill the Revolution. No. 21 belonged to the Jesuits till their expulsion\r\nin 1672. In the garden of No. 24 the vicar of St-Sulpice lay hidden\r\nafter escaping from the Carmes at the time of the Massacre. Rue\r\nHonoré-Chevalier, in the days of Henri IV Rue du Chevalier Honoré, shows\r\nin its name another link with the abbey bakehouse, for it was that of\r\nthe master-baker who cut the street across his own property.\r\n\r\nThe church St-Sulpice, with its very characteristic façade, the work of\r\nServandoni, was begun in the middle of the seventeenth century on the\r\nsite of a thirteenth-century church dedicated to St. Pierre, but was not\r\nfinished till nearly a century later. Servandoni’s towers were\r\ndisapproved of; one was demolished and rebuilt by Chalgrin. The other\r\nremains as Servandoni designed it. Entering the church we see its walls\r\ncovered with frescoes and paintings; they are all by celebrated artists.\r\nThose in the lady-chapel by Van Loo, the rest by Delacroix and other\r\nmasters of modern times. The high altar is unusually large. The shells\r\nfor holy water were a gift from the Republic of Venice to François I.\r\nThe pulpit with its carved figures was given by Richelieu. In the\r\nChapelle-des-Étudiants is an organ that belonged to Marie-Antoinette for\r\nthe use of her young son, and has been played by Glück and Mozart. A\r\nsacrilegious fête was held in the church in Revolution days and a great\r\nbanquet given in honour of Napoléon. The grand organ is very fine, its\r\nwoodwork designed by Chalgrin. The services are noted for the beauty of\r\ntheir music. The _place_ dates from 1800, built on the site of the\r\nancient seminary “des Sulpiciens,” razed by Napoléon. The present\r\nSéminaire, no longer a seminary--forfeited to the State in 1906--was\r\nbuilt in 1820-25. The immense fountain was put up there nearly half a\r\ncentury later, an old smaller one taken away.\r\n\r\nAlmost parallel with Rue Bonaparte the old Rue de Seine stretches from\r\nthe banks of the river to Rue St-Sulpice. It dates in its most ancient\r\npart from 1250 as the Pré-aux-Clercs road. No. 1 is a dependency of the\r\nInstitute. No. 6 is on the site of a _palais_ built by la Reine Margot\r\non leaving l’hôtel de Sens, some traces of which are seen among the\r\nbuildings on the spot, and part of the Queen’s gardens. No. 10 was\r\nformerly the Art School of Rosa Bonheur. At No. 12 are vestiges of\r\nl’hôtel de la Roche-Guyon and Turenne (1620). Nos. 41, 42, 57, 56, 101\r\nshow interesting seventeenth-century features. Rue Mazarine is another\r\nparallel street--a street of ancient houses. No. 12 is notable as the\r\nsite of the Jeu de Paume, a tennis-court, where in 1643 Molière set up\r\nhis Illustre théâtre. No. 30, hôtel des Pompes, where died in 1723 the\r\nfounder of the Paris Fire Brigade; a remarkable man he ... an actor in\r\nMolière’s troup, the father of thirty-two children! On the site of No.\r\n42 stood once another tennis-court, which became the théâtre Guénégaud,\r\nwhere the first attempts at Opera were made.\r\n\r\nRue de Nesle, till the middle of last century Rue d’Anjou-Dauphine,\r\nstretches across the site of part of the famous hôtel de Nesle; a\r\nsubterranean passage formerly ran beneath it. The interesting house No.\r\n8 is one of the many said to be a palace of la Reine Blanche, the mother\r\nof St. Louis. There were, however, as a matter of fact, many “Reines\r\nBlanches” in France in olden times, for royal French widows wore white,\r\nnot black for mourning.\r\n\r\nRue de Nevers (thirteenth century) was in past days closed at both ends\r\nand called therefore Rue des Deux-Portes. In Rue Guénégaud we find at\r\nNo. 29 a tower of Philippe-Auguste’s wall. All its houses are ancient.\r\nAt No. 1 we see the remains of a famous théâtre des Marionnettes.\r\n\r\nRue de l’Ancienne-Comédie, in a line with Rue Mazarine, erewhile Rue des\r\nFossés-St-Germain, is full of historic memories. The Café Procope at No.\r\n13, now a restaurant, was the first café opened in Paris (1689). Noted\r\nmen of every succeeding century drank, talked, made merry or aired their\r\ngrievances within its walls: modern paintings there record the features\r\nof some of them. No. 14 was the theatre from which the street takes its\r\nname, succeeded by the Odéon (_see_ p. 184). Rue Grégoire-de-Tours shows\r\nus several curious old houses. At No. 32 we see finely chiselled statues\r\non the façade. Rue de Buci, originally Rue de Bussy from the\r\n_buis_--box-bush--once growing there, the ecclesiastical “Via Sancti\r\nGermani de Pratis,” later Rue du Pilori, passed in ancient days through\r\nPhilippe-Auguste’s wall by a great gate with two towers opened for the\r\npurpose. For it was an all-important thoroughfare. The _carrefour_\r\nwhence it started was the busiest spot of the whole district. Persons of\r\nill-repute or evil conduct were chained there; those condemned to death\r\nwere hung there. Sedan chairs for the peaceable were hired there.\r\nThither Revolutionist volunteers flocked to be enrolled in 1792, and\r\nthere the first of the September massacres was perpetrated. Most of the\r\nancient buildings along its course have been replaced by modern\r\nstructures. The street has been in part widened; the site of some old\r\nstructures lately razed has not yet been built on.\r\n\r\nRue Dauphine, named in honour of the son of Henri IV, later Louis XIII,\r\ndates from 1607. Most of the houses date from that century or the\r\ncentury following. Rue Mazet, opening out of it at No. 49, was famed in\r\npast days for the old inn and coaching station--“le Cheval Blanc.” It\r\nexisted from 1612 to 1906. Near it was the restaurant Magny, where\r\nliterary lions of the early years of the nineteenth century--G. Sand,\r\nFlaubert, the Goncourts, etc.--met and dined. Some old houses still\r\nstand there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COUR DE ROHAN]\r\n\r\nRue St-André-des-Arts, where in ancient days dwelt the makers and\r\nvendors of “arcs,” i.e. bows, and along which the pious passed to pray\r\nat St-André on abbey territory for those who had suffered death by\r\nburning, (_les Arsis_) was in long-gone times a vine-bordered path\r\nreaching to the city wall. It was known at one time as Rue St-Germain,\r\nand was a great shoemaking street. It is rich in vestiges of the past.\r\nAlmost every house has interesting features. The modern Lycée Fénelon at\r\nNo. 45, the first girls’ _lycée_ in Paris, stands on the site of the\r\nancient _hôtel_ of the ducs d’Orléans. No. 52, hôtel du\r\nTillet-de-la-Bussière. Nos. 47-49, on the site of the ancient mansion of\r\nthe Kings of Navarre and of the Vieuville, of which some traces are\r\nstill seen. At No. 11, a house on the site of the _place_ where stood\r\nthe old church, Gounod was born in 1818. Opening out of it is the\r\nPassage du Commerce-St-André, cut in 1776, across the site of\r\nPhilippe-Auguste’s great wall of which, at No. 4, we find the base of a\r\ntower, and in the Cour de Rohan, more correctly perhaps Rouen, a very\r\nperfect fragment of the city rampart. The archbishops of Rouen had an\r\n_hôtel_ here, and the vestiges we see before us are those of a mansion\r\nbuilt on its site by King Henri II for Diane de Poitiers. Rue des\r\nGrands-Augustins, in part on the site of an ancient Augustine convent,\r\nwas, in the thirteenth century, Rue l’Abbé de St-Denis. Many of its\r\nhouses show interesting traces of the past. The reputed restaurant\r\nLapérouse at No. 1 is a Louis XV _hôtel_. At No. 5 and No. 7 remains of\r\nthe ancient hôtel d’Hercule, noted for its mythological paintings and\r\ntapestries, once the Paris abode of the princess of Savoie Carignan. At\r\nNo. 3 Rue Pont de Lodi, opening at No. 6, we see traces of the convent\r\nrefectory. Littré was born at No. 21 (1808). In 1841 Heine lived at No.\r\n25. Sardou in his youth at No. 26. Augustin Thierry lived for ten years\r\nin a house near the quay.\r\n\r\nAlmost every house in Rue Christine, named after the second daughter of\r\nHenri IV, dates from the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nIN THE VICINITY OF PLACE ST-MICHEL\r\n\r\n\r\nAn ancient _place_ and part of the old Rue de l’Hirondelle, and an\r\nancient chapel stretched in bygone days where now we see the broad new\r\nPlace St-Michel. The colossal fountain we see there was put up in 1860,\r\nreplacing a seventeenth-century fountain on the ancient _place_, which\r\nlay a little more to the south. Of the boulevard--the famous “Boule\r\nMiche”--we will speak later (_see_ p. 306).\r\n\r\nTurning into Rue de l’Hirondelle, in the twelfth century Rue\r\nl’Arondale-en-Laac, then Rue Herondalle, we see remains of the ancient\r\nCollège d’Antin, founded in 1371, and an eighteenth-century house on the\r\nsite of the mansion of the bishop of Chartres previously there. Rue\r\nGît-le-Cœur, probably indicated in fourteenth-century days the\r\ndwelling-place of the King’s cook ... _Gille_ his name; _cœur_, a\r\nmisspelling for _queux_, cook. At No. 5 we see remains of hôtel Séguier.\r\n\r\nRue Séguier was a thoroughfare, a country road in Childebert’s time; in\r\nthe fourteenth century it became a street with the name\r\nPavée-St-André-des-Arts. Every house has some interesting feature. The\r\nfamous Hostellerie St-François till the eighteenth century on the site\r\nof No. 3, was the starting-point of the coaches for Normandy and\r\nBrittany. At No. 6 we see traces of the hôtel de Nemours. The Frères\r\nCordonniers de St-Crépin, founded in 1645 (Shoemakers’ Confraternity),\r\nhad its quarters where we see the Nos. 9, 11, 13. J. de Ste-Beuve, the\r\nJansenist, was born and in 1677 died at No. 17. At No. 18 we see all\r\nthat is left of a fourteenth-century hôtel de Nevers on the site of an\r\nolder _hôtel_. The burial-ground of the church St-André stretched along\r\npart of Rue Suger: the presbytery was on the site of No. 13. Every house\r\nin this narrow old street tells of past days. At No. 3 we find traces of\r\nthe chapel of the Collège de Boissy, founded in 1360 by a Canon of\r\nChartres for seven poor students. Another old-time college stood in Rue\r\nde l’Éperon and till 1907, an ancient house, a dependency of the church\r\nSt-André-des-Arts. Rue Serpente, a winding road in its earliest days, a\r\nstreet about the year 1200, was the site of the celebrated hôtel\r\nSerpente, and of the firm of printers where Tallien was an employé. The\r\nvery modern Rue Danton, with its emphatically up-to-date structure in\r\nre-enforced concrete, has swept away a host of ancient houses. The hôtel\r\ndes Sociétés Savantes is on the site of the hôtel de Thou, l’hôtel des\r\nÉtats-de-Blois in the time of Louis XV.\r\n\r\nRue Mignon, twelfth century, recalls yet another college founded in 1343\r\nby a dignitary of Chartres of this name; ancient houses at Nos. 1 and 5.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting of these old streets is Rue Hautefeuille with its\r\ntwo turrets, one at No. 5, the ancient _hôtel_ of the Abbots of Fécamp,\r\nfourteenth century, the other octagonal, at No. 21, on the corner of\r\nwhat was once part of the Collège Damville of the same date: there in\r\nRoman times stood the castle Altum Folium--Hautefeuille--of which\r\nremains were found in the fourteenth century. This old street was no\r\ndoubt a road leading to the citadel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUE HAUTEFEUILLE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nL’ODÉON\r\n\r\n\r\nAn interesting corner of Old Paris lies on the north-east side of the\r\nOdéon. Rue Racine, opening on the _place_ before the theatre, runs\r\nthrough the ancient territory of the Cordeliers. Vestiges of a Roman\r\ncemetery were found in recent years beneath the soil at No. 28, and at\r\nNo. 11 were unearthed traces of the city wall of Philippe-Auguste.\r\nGeorge Sand lived for a time at No. 3. Rue de l’École de Médecine was\r\nonce in part Rue des Cordeliers, in part Rue des Boucheries-St-Germain,\r\na name telling its own tale. No less than twenty-two butchers’ shops\r\nflourished here. At the outbreak of the Revolution a butcher was\r\npresident of the famous club des Cordeliers established in the ancient\r\nconvent chapel (1791-94). The refectory, the church-like structure we\r\nsee at No. 15, now an anatomy museum, built by Anne of Bretagne in the\r\nfifteenth century, is all that remains of the convent buildings dating\r\nin part from the early years of the twelfth century, which covered a\r\ngreat part of this district from the days of Louis IX. Many of these\r\nbuildings were put to secular uses before the outbreak of the\r\nRevolution. The cloister stood till 1877, made into a prison, then was\r\nrazed to make room for the École de Médecine built in part with the\r\nancient cloister stones. The chapel stood on what is now Place de\r\nl’École-de-Médecine. The amphitheatre of the School of Surgery at No.\r\n5, an association founded by St. Louis, dates from the end of the\r\nseventeenth century on the site of an older structure. Above the cellars\r\nat No. 4 stood in olden days the College of Damville. The Faculté de\r\nMédecine at No. 12 is on the site of the Collège-Royal de Bourgogne,\r\nfounded in 1331. The first stone of the present building was laid by\r\nLouis XVI. The edifice was enlarged in later days, restored in 1900. The\r\nbas-relief on its frontal, sculptured as a figure of Louis XV, was by\r\norder of the Commune transformed in 1793 into the woman draped we see\r\nthere now. Skulls of famous persons, some noted criminals, may be seen\r\nat the Museum. Marat lived and died in Rue des Cordeliers. There\r\nCharlotte Corday was seized by the enraged mob. Traces of the ancient\r\nconvent may be seen in the short Rue Antoine-Dubois. Rue Dupuytren lies\r\nacross what was the convent graveyard. Nos. 7-9 were dependencies of the\r\nold convent. No. 7 was later a free school of drawing directed by Rosa\r\nBonheur. Rue Monsieur-le-Prince, so named in 1806, because of the\r\nvicinity of the hôtel du Prince de Condé, was in olden days Chemin des\r\nFossés. We see there many characteristic houses. Auguste Comte died at\r\nNo. 10 in 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nROUND ABOUT THE CARREFOUR DE LA CROIX-ROUGE\r\n\r\n\r\nPassing to the western half of the arrondissement, we turn into the\r\nmodern Rue de Rennes, running south from Place St-Germain-des-Prés along\r\nthe lines of razed convent buildings or their vanished gardens. The\r\nshort Rue Gozlin opening out of it dates from the thirteenth century,\r\nits present name recording that of a bishop of Paris who defended the\r\ncity against invading Normans in the ninth century. Two only of the\r\nhouses we see there now are ancient, Nos. 1 and 5. At No. 50 we see the\r\nseventeenth-century entrance of the old Cour du Dragon, with its balcony\r\nand huge piece of sculpture dating from 1735; the quaint houses of the\r\nalley, with its gutter in the middle, were in past days the habitation\r\nof ironmongers. It leads down into the old Rue du Dragon, which began as\r\nRue du Sépulcre, being then the property of the monks of St-Sépulcre. A\r\nfine _hôtel_ stood once at either end. At No. 76 we see the remains of a\r\nmansion, taken later for a convent, where Bossuet sojourned. Nos.\r\n147-127 are on the site of a Roman cemetery.\r\n\r\nRue Cherche-Midi, once Chasse-Midi, takes its name from an ancient\r\nsign-board illustrating the old French proverb: “Chercher midi à\r\nquatorze heures,” i.e. to look for something wide of the mark. Many\r\nold-time houses still stand along its course. It starts from the\r\nCarrefour de la Croix-Rouge, where, before a cross in the centre of the\r\nCarrefour, criminals and political offenders were put to death. The name\r\nis probably due to a sign-board rather than to the alleged colour of\r\nthis cross. In this quiet spot, as historians have remarked, a flaring\r\nred cross would hardly have been in keeping with the temper of its\r\npatrician inhabitants. The Revolutionists called it Carrefour du\r\nBonnet-Rouge. At No. 12 we see a fine _grille_. One of the most\r\ninteresting historically inhabited _hôtels_ of the city stood till 1907\r\non the site of No. 37, in olden times the dependency of a convent,\r\nlatterly hôtel des Conseils-de-Guerre, razed to make way for the\r\nbrand-new boulevard Raspail. The military prison opposite is on the site\r\nof a convent organized in the house of an exiled Calvinist, razed in\r\n1851. Nos. 85, 87, 89, eighteenth century, belonged to a branch of the\r\nMontmorency--knew successive inhabitants of historic fame and\r\nillustrious name. A fine fountain is seen in the Cour des\r\nVieilles-Tuileries at No. 86. Several old shorter streets lead out of\r\nthis long one. In Rue St-Romain, named after an old-time Prior of\r\nSt-Germain-des-Prés, we see the fine old hôtel de M. de Choiseul, now\r\nthe headquarters of the National Savings Bank. Rue St-Placide,\r\nseventeenth century, recording the name of a celebrated Benedictine\r\nmonk, shows some ancient vestiges. Huysmans died at No. 31 in 1907. In\r\nRue Dupin, once Petite Rue du Bac, we see ancient houses at Nos. 19-12,\r\nin the latter a carved wood Louis XIII staircase. Rue du Regard, another\r\n“Chemin Herbu” of past days, records by its present name the existence\r\nof an old fountain once here, now placed near the fountain Médici of the\r\nLuxembourg gardens. The publishing house Didot at No. 3 is on the site\r\nof a handsome ancient mansion once the home of the children of Mme de\r\nMontespan, sacrificed to the boulevard Raspail in 1907. Nos. 5-7 date\r\nfrom the first years of the eighteenth century. The doors of the Mont de\r\nPitié are all that is left of hôtel de la Guiche once on the site.\r\n\r\nRue de Sèvres, forming in the greater part of its course the boundary\r\nbetween arrondissements VI and VII, running on into arrondissement XV,\r\nwas known familiarly in old days as Rue de la Maladrerie, on account of\r\nits numerous hospitals. They are numerous still. At No. 11 and No. 13 we\r\nfind remains of the couvent des Prémontrés Réformés founded by Anne\r\nd’Autriche, 1661. Rue Récamier was recently opened on the site of the\r\nfamous Abbaye-aux-Bois, where for thirty years Mme de Récamier lived the\r\n“simple life,” courted none the less by a crowd of ardent admirers--the\r\n_tout Paris_ of that day. The Abbaye, as a convent, counted notable\r\nwomen among its abbesses; at the Revolution it was suppressed and let\r\nout in flats till its regrettable demolition in 1908. The Square Potain\r\nclose by, now known as Square du Bon Marché, is on the site of a\r\nleper-house which dated from the reign of Philippe-Auguste. A convent\r\nand adjoining buildings of ancient date were destroyed to allow\r\nboulevard Raspail to pursue its course. An old house still stands at No.\r\n26; vestiges at No. 31. At No. 42 we see the Hospice des Incurables,\r\nfounded in 1634 by Cardinal de la Rochefoucauld and known since 1878 as\r\nl’Hospice Laennec. Here in 1819 died the woman Simon, the jailer of the\r\nlittle dauphin “Louis XVII,” after a sojourn of twenty-five years. The\r\nminister Turgot and other persons of note lie buried in the chapel. The\r\nEgyptian fountain dates from 1806. At No. 84 we see very recently\r\nerected houses let out in flats on the site of the couvent des Oiseaux,\r\ndating from the early years of the eighteenth century--the prison du\r\nBonnet Rouge during the Revolution, a convent school and _pension_ in\r\n1818 till its suppression in 1906. The “Oiseaux”--birds--were perhaps\r\nthose of an aviary, or maybe those painted by Pigalle on the walls of\r\none of the rooms. The Lazarist convent at No. 95 was previously a\r\nprivate mansion dating from the time of Louis XV. The chapel dates from\r\n1827 and sheltered for some years the remains of St-Vincent-de-Paul. In\r\nthe eighteenth century, on the site of No. 125, wild beast fights took\r\nplace. The last numbers of the street are in arrondissement XV. There we\r\nsee the ancient Benedictine convent, suppressed in 1779--become\r\nl’Hôpital Necker. The hospital at No. 149 began life in 1676 as a\r\ncommunity of “_gentilshommes_”; seventy years later it was the “Maison\r\nRoyale de l’Enfant-Jésus” under the patronage of Marie Leczinska,\r\nenlarged by the gift of an adjoining mansion. Closed at the Revolution,\r\nit served for a time as a coal-store, then became a National orphanage,\r\nand in 1802 the “Enfants Malades”; its ancient chapel was replaced by\r\nthe chapel we see under Napoléon III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nHÔTEL DES INVALIDES\r\n\r\n\r\nARRONDISSEMENT VII. (PALAIS-BOURBON)\r\n\r\nIt was Henri IV, _le bon Roi_, who first planned the erection of a\r\nspecial _hôtel_ to shelter aged and wounded soldiers. Meanwhile they\r\nwere lodged in barracks in different parts of the city. The fine _hôtel_\r\nwe know was built by Louis XIV, opened in 1674, restored in after years\r\nby Napoléon I, and again by Napoléon III. The greatest military names of\r\nFrance figure in the list of its governors.\r\n\r\nOn July 14th, 1789, the Paris mob rushed to the Invalides for arms\r\nwherewith to storm the Bastille. On the 30th of March, 1814, nearly\r\nfifteen hundred flags and trophies were destroyed in a great bonfire\r\nmade in the court to prevent them from falling into the hands of the\r\nenemy Allies. But the chapel is still hung with flags and trophies taken\r\nin wars long overpast and three museums--le Musée Historique, le Musée\r\nd’Artillerie, le Musée des Plans-en-relief--have been important features\r\nat les Invalides since 1905. The ancient refectory has become la\r\nSalle-des-Armures, decorated with frescoes illustrative of the great\r\nbattles of bygone days from the time of Louis XIV onward. The big\r\ncannons--_la batterie triomphale_--we see behind the moats are those\r\ncaptured in the Napoléonic wars. Now in these poignant days of\r\nunparalleled warfare, immense cannons of the most up-to-date\r\nconstruction, monstrous airships, broken zeppelins, are gathered in the\r\ngreat courtyards. In the chapel St-Louis we see the tombs of\r\ndistinguished soldiers and memorials in honour of the heroes of old-time\r\nwar-days. The dome-church, separated from it by the immense\r\nstained-glass window, was built as a special chapel for the King and\r\nCourt, its dome decorated with paintings by the greatest artists of the\r\ntime. The sumptuous tomb of Napoléon I, the work of Visconti, was placed\r\nthere in the second half of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe gravestone from St-Helena and other souvenirs were put in the chapel\r\nSt-Nicolas in 1910. Of late years no new pensioners were received,\r\nveterans of war-days past were for long the sole inhabitants of the\r\nsoldiers’ quarters--the only “_invalides_.” Now the institution is once\r\nmore to be peopled with a crowd of disabled heroes, victims of the\r\nterrible war.\r\n\r\nAvenue de Tourville, planned when the hôtel des Invalides was built, was\r\nnot opened till the century following. Of the four avenues opening out\r\nof it, Avenue de Ségur, Avenue de Villars, Avenue de Breteuil, opened in\r\n1780, record the names of distinguished generals of Napoléon’s time, but\r\nshow us no historic structures. In Avenue de Lowenthal we see the façade\r\nof l’École Militaire, a vast building reaching to Avenue de la\r\nMotte-Picquet. It dates from 1752, the work of Gabriel, and was\r\noriginally destined for the military education of five hundred “young\r\ngentlemen.” Under the Convention it was turned into a flour store.\r\nRestored as a school, the “Enfants de Mars”--military students of all\r\nranks--were admitted there. Young Buonaparte, come from Corsica to study\r\nin Paris, spent a year here and was confirmed in its chapel, now used\r\nfor storing clothes. When that young student had made himself Emperor,\r\nthe Imperial Guard took up their quarters here--to be followed after\r\n1824 by the Royal Guard. Under Napoléon III the building was\r\nconsiderably changed.\r\n\r\nAt No. 13 boulevard des Invalides we catch a glimpse of the former\r\ncouvent du Sacré-Cœur, the old hôtel Biron: its chief entrance is Rue\r\nde Varennes (_see_ p. 194). No. 41 was l’hôtel de Condé. No. 50 l’hôtel\r\nde Richepanse. No. 52 l’hôtel de Masserano. No. 56 is the Institution\r\nNationale des Jeunes Aveugles, a modern structure, its foundation dating\r\nfrom 1791, one of the last foundations of Louis XVI. The statue we see\r\nis that of Valentin Haüy, its original organizer.\r\n\r\nBoulevard de la Tour Maubourg is lined by fine _hôtels_, all modern,\r\nonly the names of their owners recalling days past. Avenue de la\r\nMotte-Picquet is equally devoid of historic interest, save as regards\r\nl’École-Militaire (_see_ p. 191). But turning aside from these fine\r\nlatter-day avenues, we find in the vicinity of the Invalides several of\r\nthe oldest historic streets of the Rive Gauche.\r\n\r\nRue de Babylone existed under other names from the early years of the\r\nfifteenth century. Its present designation is in memory of Bernard de\r\nSte-Thérèse, bishop of Babylone, who owned property there whereon, at\r\nNo. 22, was built in 1663 the Séminaire des Missions Étrangères. At No.\r\n20 we see the statue of Notre-Dame de la Paix with the inscription:\r\n“l’Original de cette image est un chef d’œuvre si parfait que le\r\nTout-Puissant qui l’a fait s’est renfermé dans son ouvrage.” At No. 21\r\nlive “sisters” of St-Vincent-de-Paul, so active always in Christian work\r\nand service. No. 32 is the ancient Petit hôtel Matignon. No. 33 is the\r\nproperty of the sisters of No. 21. At No. 49 we see the ancient barracks\r\nof les Gardes Françaises, so gallantly defended by the Suisses in July,\r\n1830.\r\n\r\nIn the short Rue Monsieur (the Monsieur of the day was the brother of\r\nLouis XVI), we find at No. 12 the _hôtel_ built for Mademoiselle de\r\nBourbon-Condé, aunt of the duc d’Enghien, abbesse de Remiremont, who\r\nlies buried beneath the pavement of the Benedictine convent at No. 20.\r\nNo. 5 shows us remains of the _hôtel_ of duc de Saint-Simon, the famous\r\ndiarist-historian. Passing up Rue Barbet de Jouy, cut in 1838 across the\r\nsite of an ancient mansion, we come to Rue de Varennes, a long line of\r\nsplendid dwellings dating from a past age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nOLD-TIME MANSIONS OF THE RIVE GAUCHE\r\n\r\n\r\nARRONDISSEMENT VII. PALAIS-BOURBON\r\n\r\nThe word Varennes is a corruption of Garennes: in English the Rue de\r\nVarennes would be Warren Street, a name leading us back in thought to\r\nthe remote age when the district was wild, uncultivated land full of\r\nrabbit-warrens. Another street joined to Rue de Varennes in 1850, and\r\nlosing thus its own name, made it the long street we enter. No. 77 is\r\nthe handsome mansion and park built early in the eighteenth century by\r\nGabriel for a parvenu wig-maker. Later it was l’hôtel de Maine, then\r\nhôtel Biron, to become in 1807 the well-known convent of the\r\nSacré-Cœur. From its convent-days dates the chapel--now the Musée\r\nRodin. Other dependencies of the same date, built to house the nuns,\r\nwere razed after their evacuation in 1904, when educational\r\ncongregations were suppressed. The State, in possession of the domain,\r\nlet it out for a time in _logements_, used it for a brief period as a\r\nNational School, then let the whole property to the great sculptor,\r\nRodin, who always had his eye on fine old buildings threatened with\r\ndegradation or destruction. “I could weep,” he once said to me, “when I\r\nsee fine historic walls ruthlessly razed to the ground.” The disaffected\r\nchapel became his studio and he set about maturing the plan, faithfully\r\ncarried out after his death, of organizing there a national museum. He\r\noffered the whole of his own works and all the precious works of art he\r\nhad collected to the State for this purpose. A clause in the treaty\r\nstipulates that in the possible but unlikely event of the restitution of\r\nthe chapel building, after a lapse of years, to religious authorities,\r\nit be replaced as a museum by a new structure in the grounds. No. 73 is\r\nhôtel de Broglie, 1775. No. 69 hôtel de Clermont, 1714. No. 80 is the\r\nMinistère du Commerce. No. 78 the Ministère de l’Agriculture, built in\r\n1712 as the habitation of an _actrice_. No. 65 began as l’hôtel de la\r\nMarquise de la Suze, 1787, to become l’hôtel Rochefoucauld-Doudeauville.\r\nNo. 72 l’hôtel de Dufour, 1700. No. 64 was an eighteenth-century inn.\r\nNo. 57, l’hôtel de Matignon, made over by the duchesse de Galliera after\r\nher husband’s death to the Emperor of Austria, became the Austrian\r\nEmbassy--till 1914. Numerous have been the persons of historic name and\r\nnote who stayed or lived at this grand old mansion. It was owned at one\r\ntime by Talleyrand, whose home was next door at No. 55; by the comte de\r\nParis, who on the marriage of his daughter Amélie and Don Carlo of\r\nPortugal, in 1886, gave there a fête so magnificent that it led to the\r\nbanishment of the Orléans and other princely families of France on the\r\nground of royalist propaganda.

At\r\nNo. 115, formerly l’hôtel du Marquis de Saumery, the _actrice_ Adrienne\r\nLecouvreur died and was secretly buried. The short Rue de Martignac,\r\nopening at No. 130, showing no noteworthy feature, was built in 1828 on\r\nthe ancient grounds of the Carmelites and the Dames de Bellechasse. No.\r\n105 belonged to Berryer, the famous lawyer, 1766, then to Lamoignon de\r\nBasville. No. 122, l’hôtel d’Artagnan, to Maréchal de Montesquieu.

No. 102\r\nwas built by Lisle Mansart in the first years of the eighteenth century.\r\nAt No. 90 we turn for an instant into Rue St-Simon to look at the Latin\r\ninscriptions on Nos. 4-2, dating, however, only from 1881. No. 77, École\r\nLibre, originally l’hôtel de la Motte-Houdancourt, was inhabited in\r\nrecent times by marquis de Gallifet. No. 75, seventeenth century, built\r\nby Cardinal d’Estrées.

At No. 11 we find vestiges of the\r\n_hôtel_ of Pierre de Beauvais, a fine mansion, where the Doge of Venise,\r\ncome to Paris to make obeisance to Louis XIV, stayed in 1686; a convent\r\nsubsequently, then the Mairie of the district till 1865, when the\r\nlengthening of Rue des Saints-Pères swept it away.\r\n\r\nRue St-Dominique, like Rue de Grenelle in ancient days a country\r\nroad--“Chemin aux Vaches,” then “Chemin de la Justice”--grew into a\r\nthoroughfare of fine _hôtels_, some still standing, others swept away by\r\nthe cutting of the modern boulevard St-Germain or incorporated in the\r\nnewer _hôtels_ there. It is the district of the Gros Caillou, the great\r\nstone, which once marked the bounds of the abbey grounds of\r\nSt-Germain-des-Prés. The fountain at No. 129, dating from the early\r\nyears of the nineteenth century, is by Beauvalet. The Hygia healing a\r\nwarrior we see sculptured there reminds us of the military hospital\r\nrecently demolished. The church St-Pierre du Gros-Caillou dates from\r\n1738, on the site of a chapel built there in 1652. In the court at No.\r\n94 we find an old pavilion. A curious old house at No. 74, an old\r\ncourtyard at No. 66.

It was known in its early days as Rue de la\r\nPetite-Seyne, then as Rue du Pré-aux-Clercs. The seventeenth century saw\r\na series of lawsuits between the landowners and the University, the\r\nlatter claiming certain rights and privileges there. The University was\r\nthe losing party, the only right conceded to Alma Mater was that of\r\ngiving her name to the old street. No. 182, an ancient _garde-meuble_\r\nand statuary _dépôt_, was in recent days Rodin’s _atelier_. No. 137 was\r\nbuilt about 1675 with the stones left over at the building of les\r\nInvalides. No. 130, Ministère des Affaires Étrangères, is modern. No.\r\n128 the official dwelling of the président de la Chambre. No. 126 Palais\r\nBourbon (_see_ p. 304). No. 108, Turgot died here in 1781. No. 102 was\r\nthe abode of the duc d’Harcourt in 1770. The side of the Ministère de la\r\nGuerre we see at No. 73, a modern erection, is on the site of several\r\nhistoric _hôtels_ demolished to make way for it and for the new\r\nboulevard. Lamartine lived at No. 88 in 1848, after living in 1843 at\r\nNo. 80. No. 78 was built by Harduin-Mansart in the seventeenth century.\r\nNo. 72 was l’hôtel de Guise (1728). Mme Atkins (_see_ p. 205) lived at\r\nl’hôtel Mailly, in what is now Rue de Villersexel, in 1816. The\r\nremarkably fine hôtel de Soyecourt at No. 51 dates from 1775. No. 43\r\nl’hôtel de Noailles. Alphonse Daudet died at No. 41 (1897). No. 35 was\r\nthe home of Valdeck-Rousseau. The Magasins du Petit-St-Thomas, built on\r\nthe site of the ancient hôtel de l’Université (seventeenth century),\r\ninhabited at one time by the duc de Valentinois, by Henri d’Aguesseau,\r\netc., have been razed to make way for a big new bank. Montyon, the\r\nphilanthropist, founder of the Virtue prizes given yearly by the French\r\nAcademy, died at No. 23 in the year 1820 (_see_ p. 225). No. 15 built in\r\n1685 for a notable Fermier-général. No. 13 was in 1772 the site of the\r\nVenetian Embassy. At No. 24, in the court, we see a fine old\r\neighteenth-century _hôtel_ built by Servandoni. The houses No. 18 and\r\nNo. 20 were built upon the old gardens of la Reine Margot, which\r\nstretched down here from her palace, Rue de Seine. From the Place du\r\nPalais-Bourbon, due to Louis de Bourbon, prince de Condé, we see one\r\nside of the Chambre des Députés, built as the Palais-Bourbon by a\r\ndaughter of Louis XIV (1722). It was enlarged later by the prince de\r\nCondé, confiscated in 1780 and renamed Maison de la Révolution, almost\r\nentirely rebuilt under Napoléon. Its Grecian peristyle dates from 1808.\r\nIn 1816 a prince de Condé was again in possession. The Government bought\r\nit back in 1827 and built the present Salle des Séances. In Rue de\r\nBourgogne, on the other side of the _place_, we find several\r\neighteenth-century _hôtels_. No. 48 was hôtel Fitz-James. No. 50 has\r\nbeen the archbishop’s palace since 1907. Mgr. Richard died there in\r\n1908.\r\n\r\nThe Champ-de-Mars, wholly modern as we see it, surrounded by brand new\r\nstreets and avenues, stretches across ancient historic ground. Not yet\r\nso named, the territory was a veritable _champ de Mars_ more than a\r\nthousand years ago when, in 888, the warrior bishop Eudes, at the head\r\nof his Parisians, faced the Norman invaders there and forced them to\r\nretreat. Towards the close of the eighteenth century the great space was\r\nenclosed as the exercising-ground of the École Militaire. The Fête\r\nNationale de la Fédération was held there on 14th July, 1790, presided\r\nby Talleyrand; a year later, 17th July, 1791, La Fayette-Bailly fired\r\nupon the mob that gathered here, clamouring for the deposition of the\r\nKing. At the corner where the Avenue de la Bourdonnais now passes the\r\nguillotine was set up for the execution of Bailly in 1793. On June 8th,\r\n1794, the people from far and near crowded here for the Fête de l’Être\r\nSuprême. In 1804 the Champ-de-Mars was called for a time Champ-de-Mai.\r\nBut it remained, nevertheless, the site of military displays. Napoléon’s\r\neagles and the new decoration, la Légion d’Honneur, were first bestowed\r\nhere, and when, in 1816, Louis XVIII mounted the throne of France, it\r\nwas on the Champ-de-Mars that soldiers and civilians received once more\r\nthe _drapeau blanc_.\r\n\r\nHorse-races took place here. Here, so long ago as 1783, the first\r\nprimitive airship was sent up. Also, later, a giant balloon. The great\r\nexhibition of 1798 and all succeeding great exhibitions, as well as many\r\nsmaller ones, were held on the Champ-de-Mars. The park we see was laid\r\nout in 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nANCIENT STREETS OF THE FAUBOURG SAINT-GERMAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe extensive district on the left bank of the Seine, through which was\r\ncut in modern times the wide boulevard St-Germain, was in its remotest\r\ndays the Villa Sancti Germani, with its “_prés-aux-clercs_” a rural\r\nexpanse surrounding the abbey and quite distinct from the city of Paris,\r\nwithout its bounds. The inhabitants of that privileged district were\r\nexempt from Paris “rates and taxes,” to use our latter-day expression,\r\nand enjoyed other legal immunities. They were subject only to the\r\nauthority of the abbey administration and were actively employed in\r\nagricultural and other rustic occupations for the abbey benefit. The\r\nterritory was a region of thatched-roofed dwellings, barns and\r\ngranaries. When at length certain _grands seigneurs_ chose the district\r\nfor the erection of country mansions, these newly built houses were soon\r\nforcibly abandoned, many of them destroyed, in the course of the Hundred\r\nYears’ War. A century or more later more mansions were built and the\r\nbourg St-Germain grew into the aristocratic quarter it finally became\r\nafter the erection of the Tuileries, Catherine de’ Medeci’s new palace,\r\nin the middle of the sixteenth century. The venerable old Rue du Bac was\r\nmade on the left bank of the Seine in a straight line with the ford\r\n(_bac_) across the river in the year 1550, for the transport of\r\nmaterials needed in the construction of the palace. The rough road\r\nalong which the carters came with their loads, stone from the southern\r\nquarries, etc., grew into a fashionable street in the early years of the\r\ncentury following, when, after due authorization of the abbé of\r\nSt-Germain-des-Prés, fine new _hôtels_ were built in every direction\r\nacross the Prè-aux-Clercs, to be within easy distance of the Tuileries\r\nand the Court. Thus was created, in the first years of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, the patrician Faubourg St-Germain. The old houses in Rue du Bac\r\nwhich were nearest the river were burnt by the Communards in 1871, when\r\nthe Tuileries itself was destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe headquarters of the Mousquetaires Gris was once on the site of the\r\nhouses Nos. 18-17. Many seventeenth- and eighteenth-century houses still\r\nstand. At No. 37 we find an old and interesting court. No. 46, hôtel\r\nBernard, was successively inhabited by men of note, much of its ancient\r\ninterior decoration has been removed. No. 94 belonged till recently to\r\nthe Frères Chrétiens. No. 85 was once the royal monastery known as les\r\nRécollettes, subsequently in turn a theatre, a dancing saloon, a concert\r\nhall. At No. 98 Pichegru is said to have passed his first night in\r\nParis. Here the Chouans held their secret meetings and Cadoudal lay in\r\nhiding. We see a fine door, balcony and staircase at No. 97. No. 101\r\ndates from the time of Louis XIV. Nos. 120-118, hôtel de\r\nClermont-Tonnerre; Chateaubriand died here in 1848. No. 128 is the\r\nSéminaire des Missions Étrangères, founded 1663 by Bernard de\r\nSte-Thérèse, bishop of Babylone. No. 136 hôtel de Crouseilhes. No. 140\r\nbegan as a _maladrerie_, was later the abode of the King’s falconer, and\r\nwas given in 1813 to the Order of St-Vincent-de-Paul. Mme Legras,\r\nSt-Vincent-de-Paul’s ardent fellow-worker, was buried in the chapel.\r\nThe great shops of the Bon Marché stretch where private mansions stood\r\nof yore.\r\n\r\nRue de Lille, formerly Rue de Bourbon, has many ancient houses. We see\r\nin the wall of No. 14 an old sundial with inscriptions in Latin. At No.\r\n26 we find vestiges of a chapel founded by Anne d’Autriche. No. 67,\r\nbuilt in 1706 for President Duret, was annexed later to the _hôtel_ of\r\nprince Monaco-Valentinois. No. 79, hôtel de Launion, 1758, was the house\r\nof Charlotte Walpole, who became Mrs. Atkins, the devoted friend of the\r\nBourbons, and spent a fortune in her efforts to save the Dauphin. She\r\ndied here in 1836. No. 64, built in 1786 for the prince de Salm-Kyrburg,\r\nwas gained in a lottery by a wig-maker’s assistant, in the first days of\r\nthe First Empire, an adventurer who bought the pretty palace of\r\nBagatelle beyond Paris, was arrested for forgery, then disappeared. Used\r\nas a club, then, in 1804, as the palace of the Légion d’Honneur, it was\r\nburnt by the Communards in 1871, rebuilt at the cost of the\r\n_légionnaires_ in 1878. No. 78, built by Boffrand, was the home of\r\nEugène de Beauharnais; we see there the bedroom of Queen Hortense.\r\nGerman Embassy before the war.\r\n\r\nRue de Verneuil is another seventeenth-century street built across the\r\nPré-aux-Clercs. Nos. 13-15 was first a famous eighteenth-century\r\nriding-school, then the Académie Royale Dugier; later, till 1865, Mairie\r\nof the arrondissement. The inn at No. 24 was the meeting-place of\r\nroyalists in the time of the Empire.\r\n\r\nRue de Beaume has several interesting _hôtels_, their old-time features\r\nwell preserved. In the seventeenth century Carnot’s ancestors lived\r\nbetween the Nos. 17-25. At No. 10 we see remains of the headquarters of\r\nthe Mousquetaires Gris, which extended across the meeting-point of the\r\nfour streets: Beaume, Verneuil, Bac, Lille. No. 2 was l’hôtel\r\nMailly-Nesle.\r\n\r\nRue des Saints-Pères marks the boundary-line between arrondissements VI\r\nand VII, an old-world street of historic associations. It began at the\r\nclose of the thirteenth century as Rue aux Vaches; cows passed there in\r\nthose days to and from the farmyards of the abbey St-Germain-des-Prés.\r\nIn the sixteenth century it was known, like Rue de Sèvres into which it\r\nruns, as Rue de la Maladrerie, to become Rue des Jacobins Réformés,\r\nfinally Rue St-Pierre from the chapel built there, a name corrupted to\r\nSaints-Pères. No. 2 l’hôtel de Tessé. No. 6 (1652) once the stables of\r\nMarie-Thérèse de Savoie. No. 28 l’hôtel de Fleury (1768). The court of\r\nNo. 30 covers the site of an old Protestant graveyard. A few old houses\r\nremain in Rue Perronet opening at No. 32, where once an abbey windmill\r\nworked. No. 39 Hôpital de la Charité, an Order founded by Marie de’\r\nMedici in 1602, its principal entrance Rue Jacob. Dislodged from their\r\noriginal quarters in Rue de la Petite-Seine, where Rue Bonaparte now\r\nruns, by Queen Margot, who wanted the site for the new palace she built\r\nfor herself on quitting l’hôtel de Sens, the nuns settled here about the\r\nyear 1608. At No. 40 we see medallions over the door, one of Charlotte\r\nCorday, the other not, as sometimes said, that of Marat but a Moor’s\r\nhead. In the court we see other medallions and mouldings made chiefly\r\nfrom the sculptures on the tomb of François I at St-Denis. The hôtel de\r\nla Force, where dwelt Saint-Simon, once stood close here. That and other\r\nancient _hôtels_ were razed to make way for the boulevard St-Germain.\r\nNo. 49, the chapel of the “frères de la Charité” on the site of the\r\nancient chapel St-Pierre of which the crypt still remains, has been the\r\nmedical Academy since 1881. The square adjoining it is an old Protestant\r\nburial-ground. Nos. 50-52 are ancient. No. 54 is the French Protestant\r\nlibrary, Cuvier and Guizot were among its presidents. No. 56 was built\r\nin 1640 for la Maréchale de la Meilleraie. At No. 63 Châteaubriand lived\r\nfrom 1811 to 1814.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nTHE MADELEINE AND ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD\r\n\r\n\r\nARRONDISSEMENT VIII. (ÉLYSÉE)\r\n\r\nThe handsome church which forms so distinct a feature of this quarter of\r\nthe city was begun to be built in the year 1764 to replace an older\r\nchurch, originally a convent chapel, in the district known as Ville\r\nl’Evêque because the bishop of Paris had a country house--a\r\nvilla--there.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution found the new church unfinished, and when Napoléon was in\r\npower he decided to complete the structure as a temple of military glory\r\nto be dedicated to the Grande Armée. Napoléon fell. The building was\r\nrestored to the ecclesiastical authorities and its construction as a\r\nchurch, dedicated to Ste. Marie-Madeleine, completed during the years\r\n1828-42. Begun on the model of the Pantheon at Rome, the building was\r\nfinished on the plan of the Maison Carrée at Nismes. It is 108 mètres in\r\nlength, 43 m. broad. The fine Corinthian columns we see are forty-eight\r\nin number. The great bronze doors are the largest church doors known.\r\nTheir splendid bas-reliefs are the work of Triquetti (1838). Specimens\r\nof every kind of marble found in France have been used in the grand\r\ninterior. In the wonderful painting “l’Histoire de la France\r\nChrétienne,” we see in the centre Pope Pius VII and Napoléon in the act\r\nof making the Concordat, surrounded by King Clovis, Charlemagne, St.\r\nLouis, Jeanne d’Arc, Henri IV, Sully, Louis XIII, etc. The statues and\r\nother decorations are all modern, the work of the most distinguished\r\nartists of the nineteenth century. The abbé Deguerry, vicar in 1871,\r\nshot by the Communards, is buried there in the chapel Notre-Dame de la\r\nCompassion.\r\n\r\nThe _place_ surrounding the church dates from 1815. At No. 7 lived\r\nAmédée Thierry (1820-29), Meilhac, and during fifty years Jules Simon\r\nwho died there in 1896. We see his statue before the house. Behind the\r\nchurch we see the statue of Lavoisier, put to death at the Revolution.\r\nThe streets opening out of Place de la Madeleine are modern, cut across\r\nancient convent lands, and the old farm lands of les Mathurins. No. 5\r\nRue Tronchet is said to have been at one time the home of Chopin. Rue de\r\nl’Arcade, of yore “Chemin d’Argenteuil”--Argenteuil Road--got its name\r\nfrom an arcade destroyed in the time of Napoléon III, which stretched\r\nacross the gardens of the convent of Ville l’Evêque, where the houses 15\r\nand 18 now stand. Several of the houses we see along the street date\r\nfrom the eighteenth century, none are of special interest.\r\n\r\nRue Pasquier brings us to the Square Louis XVI and the chapelle\r\nExpiatoire built on the graveyard of the Madeleine. In that graveyard,\r\nmade in 1659 upon the convent kitchen garden, were buried many of the\r\nmost noted men and women of the tragic latter years of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. There were laid the numerous victims of the fire on the Place\r\nde la Concorde, at that time Place Louis XVI, caused by fireworks at the\r\nfestivities after the wedding of Louis XVI. The thousand Swiss Guards\r\nwho died to defend the Tuileries, Louis XVI, Marie-Antoinette, Mme\r\nRoland, Charlotte Corday and hundreds more of the _guillotinés_ were\r\nburied there. When, in 1794, the churchyard was disaffected and put up\r\nfor sale, the whole territory was bought by an ardent royalist and under\r\nLouis XVIII the chapel we see was built; an altar in the crypt marks the\r\nspot where some of the remains of the King and Queen were found.\r\n\r\nRue d’Anjou, opened in 1649, formerly Rue des Morfondus, has known many\r\nillustrious inhabitants: Madame Récamier, the comtesse de Boigne, etc.\r\nLa Fayette died at No. 8 (1834). No. 22 dates from 1763. The Mairie was\r\noriginally the hôtel de Lorraine. Many of the ancient _hôtels_ have been\r\nreplaced by modern erections.\r\n\r\nIn Rue de Surène, in olden days Suresnes Road, we see at No. 23 the\r\nhandsome hôtel de Lamarck-Arenberg, dating from 1775, and the petit\r\nhôtel du Marquis de l’Aigle of about the same date.\r\n\r\nRue de la Ville l’Évêque dates from the seventeenth century, recalling\r\nby its name the days when, from the thirteenth century onwards, the\r\nbishops of Paris had a rural habitation, a villa and perhaps a farm in\r\nthis then outlying district. Around the _villeta episcopi_ grew up a\r\nlittle township included within the city bounds in the time of Louis XV.\r\nThe ancient thirteenth-century church, dedicated like its modern\r\nsuccessor to Ste-Marie-Madeleine, stood on the site of No. 11 of the\r\nmodern boulevard Malesherbes. The Benedictine convent close by, of later\r\nfoundation, built like the greater number of the most noted Paris\r\nconvents in the early years of the seventeenth century, was suppressed\r\nand razed at the Revolution. Many noted persons of the eighteenth and\r\nnineteenth centuries had their residences in the Ville l’Evêque. Guizot\r\ndied there in 1875. No. 16, l’hôtel du Maréchal Suchet, is now an\r\nInstitut. No. 20 the _hôtel_ of Prince Arenberg. No. 25-27 are ancient.\r\n\r\nRue Boissy d’Anglas, opened in the eighteenth century, bearing for long\r\nthree different names in the different parts of its course, records in\r\nits present name that of a famous conventional (1756-1826). In the\r\nwell-known provision shop, Corcellet, Avenue de l’Opéra, we may see the\r\nportrait of the famous Gourmet, who in pre-Revolution days lived at the\r\nfine mansion No. 1, now the Cercle artistique “l’Épatant,” and carried\r\nout there his luxurious and ultra-refined taste in the matter of food\r\nand the manner of serving it. Horses to whom a _recherché cuisine_ could\r\nnot be offered, had their oats served to them in silver mangers.\r\nSequestered at the Revolution, it still remained the abode of a gourmet\r\nof repute; sold later to the State, it became an Embassy, then a club.\r\nNo. 12 dates from Louis XV and has been the abode of several families of\r\nhistoric name. Prince de Beauvau lived there in more modern days and\r\nbaron Hausmann died there. Lulli died at No. 28 (1637). Curious old\r\nhouses are seen in the Cité Berreyer and Cité du Retiro.\r\n\r\nRue Royale, in its earliest days Chemin des Remparts--Rampart Road--for\r\nthe third Porte St-Honoré in the city wall was at the point where it\r\nmeets the Rue du Faubourg, became a street--Rue Royale-des-Tuileries--in\r\nthe middle of the eighteenth century. In 1792 it became Rue de la\r\nRévolution, then, from 1800 to 1814, Rue de la Concorde. Most of the\r\nhouses we see there date from the eighteenth century, built by the\r\narchitect Gabriel, who lived at No. 8. Mme de Staël lived for a time at\r\nNo. 6. This leads us to Place de la Concorde, built by Gabriel; it was\r\nopened in 1763 as Place Louis XV, to become a hundred and thirty years\r\nlater Place de la Révolution, with in its centre a statue of Liberty\r\nreplacing the overturned statue of the King. Its name was changed\r\nseveral times during the years that followed, till in 1830 the name\r\ngiven by the Convention was restored for good. In olden days it was\r\nsurrounded by moats and had on one side a _pont-tournant_; the _place_\r\nwas the scene of national fêtes in times past as it is in our own times.\r\nIt was also not unfrequently the scene of tragedy and death. The\r\nguillotine was set up there on January 21, 1793, for the execution of\r\nthe King. Marie-Antoinette, Charlotte Corday and many other notable\r\nvictims of the Revolution were beheaded there ... in the end,\r\nRobespierre himself. In 1814 the Allies of those days gathered there for\r\nthe celebration of a grand _Te-Deum_. The statues we see surrounding the\r\nvast place personify the great towns of France--that of Strasbourg the\r\nmost remarkable. The fine “Chevaux de Marly” at the starting-point of\r\nthe Champs-Elysées are the work of Coustou, Mercury and la Renommée, at\r\nthe entrance of the Tuileries gardens, of Coysevox. Handsome buildings\r\n(eighteenth century) flank the _place_ on its northern side. The\r\nMinistère de la Marine was in pre-Revolution days the _garde meuble_ of\r\nthe Kings of France. Splendid jewels, including the famous diamond known\r\nas le Regent, were stolen thence in 1792. What is now the Automobile\r\nClub was for many years the official residence of the papal Nuncio.\r\nL’hôtel Crillon, built as a private mansion, was for a time the Spanish\r\nEmbassy; most of the beautiful woodwork for which it was noted has been\r\nsold and taken away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nLES CHAMPS-ÉLYSÉES\r\n\r\n\r\nThis wonderful avenue stretching through the whole length of the\r\narrondissement reached in olden days only to the rural district of\r\nChaillot, and was known as the Grande Allée-du-Roule, later as Avenue\r\ndes Tuileries. Colbert, Louis XIV’s great minister, first made it a\r\ntree-planted avenue. The gardens bordering it on either side between\r\nPlace de la Concorde and Avenue d’Antin, were laid out by Le Nôtre,\r\n1670, as Crown land. Cafés, restaurants, toy-stalls, etc., were set up\r\nthere from the first. The Palais de Glace is on the site of a Panorama\r\nwhich existed till its destruction by fire in 1855. The far-famed Café\r\ndes Ambassadeurs, set up in the eighteenth century, was rebuilt in 1841.\r\nThe no less famous cirque de l’Impératrice was razed in 1900.\r\n\r\nThe Rond-Point des Champs-Élysées was first laid out in 1670, but the\r\nhouses we see there now are all modern. Avenue d’Antin stretching on\r\neither side of it, old only in the part leading from Cours-la-Reine, was\r\nplanted in 1723 by the duc d’Orléans. Marguerite Gauthier (la Dame aux\r\nCamélias) lived at No. 9. At No. 3 Avenue Matignon Heine died in his\r\nroom on the fifth story (1856). Avenue Montaigne was known in 1731 as\r\nAllée des Veuves. It remained an alley--Allée Montaigne--till 1852. The\r\nthatched dwelling of Mme Tallien stood at its starting-point, near the\r\nSeine. There her divorced and destitute husband was forced to accept a\r\nshelter at the hands of his ex-wife, become princesse de Chimay; there\r\nthe Revolutionist died in 1820. We see only modern houses along the\r\nAvenue of to-day. Rue Matignon was opened across the ancient Jardin\r\nd’hiver where fine tropical plants erewhile had flourished. No. 12 was\r\nthe Vénerie Impériale.\r\n\r\nAvenue des Champs-Élysées is bordered on both sides by modern mansions.\r\nNo. 25, hôtel de la Païve, of late years the Traveller’s Club, during\r\nthe war an ambulance, represents the style of the Second Empire. Avenue\r\nGabriel with its grand mansions was formed in 1818 on the\r\nMarais-des-Gourdes--marshy land. The Rue Marbeuf was in the eighteenth\r\ncentury Ruelle des Marais, then Rue des Gourdes. Its present name\r\nrecalls the Louis XV Folie Marbœuf once there. Few and far between\r\nare the ancient vestiges to be found among the modern structures we see\r\non every side around us here. Rue Chaillot, in bygone days the chief\r\nstreet of the village of Chaillot, was taken within the Paris bounds in\r\n1860. It was a favourite street for residence in the nineteenth century.\r\nRue Bassano, entirely modern now, existed in part as Ruelle des Jardins\r\nin the early years of the eighteenth century. Rue Galilée was Chemin des\r\nBouchers in 1790, then Rue du Banquet.\r\n\r\nSo we come to la Place de l’Étoile, the high ground known in long-gone\r\ntimes as “la Montagne du Roule.” Till far into the eighteenth century it\r\nwas without the city bounds and beyond the Avenue des Champs-Élysées\r\nwhich ended at Rue de Chaillot, a tree-studded, unlevelled, grass-grown\r\noctagonal stretch of land. Then it was made round and even, and became a\r\nfavourite and fashionable promenade, known as l’Étoile de Chaillot, or\r\nthe Rond-Point de Neuilly. The site had long been marked out for the\r\nerection of an important monument when Napoléon decreed the construction\r\nthere of the Arc de Triomphe. The first stone of the arch was laid by\r\nChalgrin in 1806, the Emperor and his new wife, on their wedding-day\r\npassed beneath a temporary Arc de Triomphe made of cloth, as the stone\r\nstructure was not yet finished. Of the statuary which decorate the arch,\r\nthe most noted group is the Départ, by Rude. The frieze shows the going\r\nforth to battle and the return of Napoléon’s armies, with the names of\r\nhis generals engraved beneath.[F]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nFAUBOURG ST-HONORÉ\r\n\r\n\r\nTurning down Avenue Wagram, one of the twelve broad avenues, all modern,\r\nbranching from the Place de l’Étoile, we come to the Faubourg St-Honoré,\r\noriginally Chaussée du Roule. The village of Le Roule was famed in the\r\nthirteenth century for its goose-market. The district became a faubourg\r\nin 1722 and in 1787 was taken within the city bounds. It has always been\r\na favourite quarter among men of intellectual activity desiring to live\r\nbeyond the turbulence of the centre of Paris. Here and there we come\r\nupon vestiges of bygone days. No. 222 is an old Dominican convent\r\ndisaffected in 1906. A foundry once stood at the corner of the Rue\r\nBalzac, where public statues of kings and other royalties of old were in\r\nturn cast or melted down. The house where Balzac died once stood close\r\nthere too, up against an ancient chapel--all long swept away. The walled\r\ngarden remains--bordering the street to which the name of the great\r\nnovelist has been given--a slab put up where we see, just above the\r\nwall, the top of a pillared summer-house, which Balzac is said to have\r\nbuilt. The hospital Beaujon dates from 1784 but has no architectural or\r\nhistorical interest. The few ancient houses we see at intervals in this\r\nupper part of the faubourg are remains of the village du Roule. Several\r\nof more interesting aspect were razed a few years ago. The military\r\nhospital was once the site of royal stables. Mme de Genlis died at No.\r\n170.\r\n\r\nThe church St-Philippe du Roule was built by Chalgrin in 1774 on the\r\nsite of the seventeenth-century hôtel du Bas-Roule. No. 107 was the\r\nhabitation of the King’s Pages under Louis XV. On the site of No. 81\r\ncomte de Fersan had his stables in the time of Louis XVI. The Home\r\nOffice (Ministère de l’Intérieur) on Place Beauvau dates from the\r\neighteenth century and has been a private mansion, a municipal _hôtel_,\r\na hotel in the English sense of the word.\r\n\r\nThe Palais de l’Élysée, built in 1718, was bought in 1753 by Mme de\r\nPompadour. La Pompadour died at Versailles, but by her express wish her\r\nbody was taken to Paris and laid in this her Paris home before the\r\nfuneral. She bequeathed the _hôtel_ to the comte de Province, but Louis\r\nXV used it for State purposes. Then, become again a private residence,\r\nit was inhabited by the duchesse de Bourbon, mother of the due\r\nd’Enghien. She let it later to the tenant who made of it an _Élysée_, a\r\npleasure-house, laid out a _parc anglais_, gave sumptuous _fêtes\r\nchampêtres_. Sequestered at the Revolution, the mansion was sold\r\nsubsequently to Murat and Caroline Buonaparte, then became an imperial\r\npossession as l’Élysée-Napoléon. Napoléon gave it to Joséphine at her\r\ndivorce but she preferred Malmaison. There the Emperor signed his second\r\nabdication and there, in 1815, the Duke of Wellington and the Emperor of\r\nRussia made their abode. The next occupants were the duc and duchesse de\r\nBerry. The duchesse left it after her husband’s death in 1820. It became\r\nl’Hôtellierie des Princes. In 1850 Napoléon as Prince-President made a\r\nbrief abode there before the _coup d’état_. The façade dates from his\r\nreign as Napoléon III when, to cut it off from surrounding buildings,\r\nhe made the Rue de l’Élysée through its gardens. The Garde Nationale\r\ntook possession of it in 1871. It was saved from destruction under the\r\nCommune by its _conservateur_, who placed counterfeited _scellés_. No.\r\n41, hôtel Pontalba, built by Visconti on the site of an older _hôtel_,\r\nnow owned by one of the Rothschilds, has fine ancient woodwork, once at\r\nhôtel St-Bernard, Rue du Bac. No. 39, the British Embassy, was built in\r\n1720 for the duc de Charost; given in 1803 to Pauline Buonaparte,\r\nprincesse Borghese, given over to the English in 1815. British Embassy\r\nsince 1825. Nos. 35, 33, 31, 29, 27 are all eighteenth-century _hôtels_.\r\nAt No. 30 the Cité de Retiro was in past days the great Cour des Coches,\r\ninhabited by the “Fermier des carrosses de la Cour.” Nos. 24, 16 are\r\nancient. No. 14 was the Mairie till 1830.\r\n\r\nThe streets opening out of the Faubourg date mostly from the eighteenth\r\ncentury and show here and there traces of a past age, but the greater\r\nnumber of the houses standing along their course to-day are of modern\r\nconstruction. Rue d’Aguesseau was cut in 1723 across the property of the\r\nChancellor whose name it records. The Embassy church there is on the\r\nsite of the ancient hôtel d’Armaille. No. 18 was at one time the Mairie\r\nof the 1st arrondissement. Rue Montalivet, where at No. 6 we see the\r\nfriendly front of the British Consulate, was for some years Rue du\r\nMarché-d’Aguesseau. Rue des Saussaies was in the seventeenth century a\r\nwillow-tree bordered road. Place des Saussaies is modern on the site of\r\ndemolished eighteenth-century _hôtels_. In Rue Cambacérés we see ancient\r\n_hôtels_ at Nos. 14, 8, 3.\r\n\r\nThe first numbers in Rue Miromesnil are old and have interesting\r\ndecorations, Châteaubriand lived at No. 31 in 1804. Rue de Panthièvre\r\nwas Rue des Marais in the seventeenth century, then Chemin Vert. Its\r\nhouses were the habitation of many noted persons through the two\r\ncenturies following. Franklin is said to have lived at No. 26, also\r\nLucien Buonaparte. The barracks dates from 1780, one of those built for\r\nthe Gardes Françaises, who had previously been billeted in private\r\nhouses. Fersen lived in Rue Matignon; Gambetta at No. 12, Rue Montaigne\r\n(1874-78). The Colisée, which gave its name to the street previously\r\nknown as Chaussée des Gourdes, was an immense hall used for festive\r\ngatherings from 1770 to 1780, when it was demolished. On part of the\r\nsite it occupied, Rue Penthieu was opened at the close of the eighteenth\r\ncentury and Rue de la Bôëtie into which we now turn. That fair street\r\nwas known in the different parts of its course by no less than eleven\r\ndifferent names before its present one, given in 1879. Several\r\neighteenth-century _hôtels_ still stand here; others on the odd number\r\nside were razed in recent years to widen the thoroughfare. No. 111 was\r\ninhabited for a time at the end of the eighteenth century by the then\r\nduc de Richelieu. When Napoléon was in power, an Italian minister lived\r\nthere and gave splendid fêtes, at which the Emperor was a frequent\r\nguest. In recent days its owner was the duc de Massa, grandson of\r\nNapoléon’s famous minister of Justice. Carnot lived for a time at No.\r\n122. Eugène Sue at No. 55. Comtesse de la Valette at No. 44, a _hôtel_\r\nknown for its extensive grounds.\r\n\r\nRue de Berri, opened 1778, across the site of the royal nursery gardens,\r\nwent by several names before receiving that of the second son of Charles\r\nX, assassinated in 1820. The Belgian Legation at No. 20 was built by the\r\naunt of Mme de Genlis and was in later times the home of princesse\r\nMathilde who died there in 1904. Rue Washington was opened in 1789; Rue\r\nGalilée as chemin des Bouchers, then Rue du Banquet, in 1790. In Rue\r\nDaru, of the same date, opened as Rue de la Croix du Roule, we see the\r\nRussian church built in 1881, with its beautiful paintings and frescoes\r\nand rich Oriental decorations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nPARC MONCEAU\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already referred to Avenue Wagram. Modern buildings stretch\r\nalong the whole course of the other eleven avenues branching from Place\r\nde l’Étoile. Avenue Hoche leads us to Parc Monceau, laid out on lands\r\nbelonging in past days to the Manor of Clichy, sold to the prince\r\nd’Orléans in 1778, arranged as a smart _jardin anglais_ for\r\nPhilippe-Égalité in 1785, the property of the nation in 1794, restored\r\nto the Orléans by Louis XVIII, bought by the State in 1852, given to the\r\ncity authorities in 1870. The Renaissance arcade is a relic of the\r\nancient hôtel de Ville, burnt down in 1871. The oval _bassin_, called\r\n“la Naumachie,” with its Corinthian columns, came from an old church at\r\nSt-Denis, Notre-Dame de la Rotonde, built as the burial-place of the\r\nValois, razed in 1814. Avenue Friedland was opened in 1719, across the\r\nsite of a famous eighteenth-century public garden and several demolished\r\n_hôtels_, and lengthened to its present extent some fifty years later.\r\nAvenue Marceau was of yore Avenue Joséphine.\r\n\r\nRue de Monceau, opened in 1801, lies along the line of the old road to\r\nthe vanished village of Monceau or Musseau. Rue du Rocher, along the\r\ncourse of a Roman road, has gone by different names in its different\r\nparts. Its upper end, waste ground until well into the nineteenth\r\ncentury, at the close of the eighteenth century was a Revolutionists’\r\nmeeting-place, and there in the tragic months of 1794 many _guillotinés_\r\nwere buried, among them the two Robespierres. In later years a dancing\r\nsaloon was set up on the spot. It was a district of windmills. The\r\nMoulin de la Marmite, Moulin Boute-à-Feu, Moulin-des-Prés, stood on the\r\nhigh ground above Gare St-Lazare until a century ago. Few vestiges of\r\nthe past remain. Rue de Laborde was known in 1788 as Rue des Grésillons,\r\ni.e. Flour Street (_grésillons_, the flour in its third stage of\r\ngrinding). Then it became Chemin des Porcherons, and the district was\r\nknown as that of la Petite-Pologne, a reference to the habitation there\r\nof the duc d’Anjou, who was King of Poland. In the courtyard of No. 4 we\r\nfind an ancient boundary-stone, once in Rue de l’Arcade, where it marked\r\nthe bounds of the city under Louis XV.\r\n\r\nRue de la Pépinière, its name and that of the barracks there so well\r\nknown of late to British soldiers, recording the site of the royal\r\nnursery grounds of a past age, was marked out as early as 1555, but\r\nopened only in 1782. The barracks, first built in 1763 for the Gardes\r\nFrançaises, was rebuilt under Napoléon III. All other streets in the\r\nneighbourhood are modern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nIN THE VICINITY OF THE OPERA\r\n\r\n\r\nARRONDISSEMENT IX. (OPÉRA)\r\n\r\nThe Paris Opera-house was built between the years 1861-75 to replace the\r\nstructure in Rue le Peletier burnt to the ground in 1873. On its ornate\r\nRenaissance façade we see, amid other statuary, the noted group “La\r\nDanse,” the work of Carpeaux. Of the “Grands Boulevards,” by which the\r\nOpera is surrounded, we shall speak later (_see_ p. 297).\r\n\r\nMost of the streets in its neighbourhood are modern, stretching across\r\nthe site of demolished buildings, important in their day, but of which\r\nfew traces now remain.\r\n\r\nRue des Mathurins lies across the grounds of the vanished convent, Ville\r\nl’Évêque. Rue Tronchet runs where was once the Ferme des Mathurins\r\n(_see_ p. 224).\r\n\r\nRue Caumartin, opened 1779, records the name of the Prévôt des Marchands\r\nof the day. It was a short street then, lengthened later by the old\r\nadjoining streets Ste-Croix and Thiroux, the site erewhile of the famed\r\n_porcelaine_ factory of la Reine. (Marie-Antoinette). No. 1 dates from\r\n1779 and was noted for its gardens arranged in Oriental style. No. 2,\r\nto-day the Paris Sporting Club, dates from the same period. No. 2 _bis_\r\nand most of the other houses have been restored or rebuilt. The butcher\r\nLegendre, who set the phrygian cap on the head of Louis XVI, is said to\r\nhave lived at No. 52. No. 65 was built as a Capucine convent (1781-83).\r\nSequestered at the Revolution, it became a hospital, then a _lycée_, its\r\nname changed and rechanged: Lycée Buonaparte, Collège Bourbon, Lycée\r\nFontanes, finally Lycée Condorcet, while the convent chapel, rebuilt,\r\nbecame the church St-Louis d’Antin. Rue Vignon was, till 1881, Rue de la\r\nFerme des Mathurins, as an inscription on the walls of No. 1 reminds us.\r\nRue de Provence, named after the brother of Louis XVI, was opened in\r\n1771, built over a drain which went from Place de la République to the\r\nSeine near Pont de l’Alma. No. 22 is an ancient house restored. Berlioz\r\nlived at No. 41. Meissonier at No. 43. Nos. 45 to 65 are on the site of\r\nthe mansion and grounds of the duc d’Orléans which extended to Rue\r\nTaitbout. We see a fine old _hôtel_ at No. 59. Cité d’Antin, opening at\r\nNo. 61, was built in 1825, on the site of the ancient hôtel Montesson.\r\nLiszt, the pianist, lived at No. 63. The Café du Trèfle claims existence\r\nsince the year 1555. The busy, bustling Rue de la Chaussée d’Antin was\r\nan important roadway in the twelfth century, as Chemin des Porcherons.\r\nThe houses we see there are mostly of eighteenth-century date, others\r\noccupy the site of ancient demolished buildings. Many notable persons\r\nlived here. No. 1, where we see the Vaudeville theatre (there since\r\n1867), was of old the site of two historic mansions. No. 2, now a\r\nfashionable restaurant, dates from 1792, built as Dépôt des Gardes\r\nFrançaises. Rossini lived there for one year--1857-58. Where Rue\r\nMeyerbeer was opened in 1860 stood, in other days, the _hôtel_ of Mme\r\nd’Épinay, whose walls had sheltered Grimm, and for a time Mozart. A\r\nneighbouring house was the home of Necker, where his daughter, Mme de\r\nStaël, grew up and which became later the possession of Mme Récamier.\r\nThe graveyard of St-Roch stretched, till the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, across the site of Nos. 20-22. No. 42 belonged to Mme Talma.\r\nThere Mirabeau died in 1791; his widow in 1800. Joséphine de\r\nBeauharnais, not yet Empress, dwelt at No. 62. Gambetta at No. 55. No.\r\n68, hôtel Montfermeil, was rebuilt by Fesch, Napoléon’s uncle. Rue\r\nSt-Lazare was, before 1770, Rue des Porcherons, from the name of an\r\nimportant estate of the district over which the abbesses of Montmartre\r\nhad certain rights of jurisdiction. Passage de Tivoli, at No. 96,\r\nrecalls the first Tivoli with its _jardins anglais_ stretching far at\r\nthis corner. Its owner’s head fell, severed by the guillotine, and his\r\n_folie_ became national property. Fêtes were given there by the\r\nRevolutionist authorities till its restoration, in 1810, to heirs of the\r\nman who had built it. Avenue du Coq records the existence in\r\nfourteenth-century days of a Château du Coq, known also as Château des\r\nPorcherons, the manor-house of the Porcherons’ estate. The Square de la\r\nTrinité is on the site of a famous restaurant of past days, the\r\nwell-known “Magny,” which as a dancing-saloon--“La Grande Pinte”--was on\r\nthe site till 1851. The church is modern (1867). No. 56 is part of the\r\nhôtel Bougainville where the great tragedienne, Mlle Mars, lived. At No.\r\n23, dating from the First Empire, we find a fine old staircase and in\r\nthe court a pump marked with the imperial eagle. Rue de Chateaudun is\r\nmodern. The _brasserie_ at the corner of Rue Maubeuge stands on the site\r\nof the ancient cemetery des Porcherons. Rue de la Victoire, in the\r\nseventeenth century Ruellette-au-Marais-des-Porcherons, was renamed in\r\n1792 Rue Chantereine, referring to the very numerous frogs (RANA = frog)\r\nwhich filled the air of that then marshy district with their croaking.\r\nBuonaparte lived there at one time, hence the name given in 1798, taken\r\naway in 1816, restored by Thiers in 1833. By a curious coincidence, an\r\nOrder of Nuns, “de la Victoire,” so called to memorize a very much\r\nearlier victory--Bouvines 1214--owned property here. On the site of No.\r\n60, now a modern house let out in flats, stood in olden days the chief\r\nentrance to l’hôtel de la Victoire, a remarkably handsome structure\r\nbuilt in 1770, sold and razed in 1857--alas! At the end of the court at\r\nNo. 58 we see the ancient hôtel d’Argenson, its _salon_ kept undisturbed\r\nfrom the days when great politicians of the past met and made decisive\r\nresolutions there. The Bains Chantereine at No. 46 has been théâtre\r\nOlymphique, théâtre des Victoires Nationales, théâtre des Troubadours,\r\nand was for a few days in 1804 l’Opéra Comique; No. 45, with its busts\r\nand bas-reliefs, dates from 1840. Rue Taitbout, begun in 1773,\r\nlengthened by the union of adjoining streets, records the name of an\r\neighteenth-century municipal functionary. Isabey, Ambroise Thomas and\r\nManuel Gracia lived in this old street, and at No. 1, now a smart\r\n_café_, two noted Englishmen, the Marquis of Hertford and Lord Seymour,\r\nlived at different periods. No. 2 was once the famous restaurant\r\nTortoni. No. 30, as a private _hôtel_, sheltered Talleyrand and Mme\r\nGrand. We see interesting vestiges at No. 44. The Square d’Orléans is\r\nthe ancient Cité des Trois Frères, in past days a nest of artists and\r\nmen of letters: Dumas, George Sand, Lablache, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nON THE WAY TO MONTMARTRE\r\n\r\n\r\nRue de Clichy was once upon a time the Roman road between Paris and\r\nRouen, taking in its way the village Cligiacum. For long in later days\r\nit was known as Rue du Coq, when the old château stood near its line. It\r\nwas in a house of Rue de Clichy, inhabited by the Englishman Crawford,\r\nthat Marie-Antoinette and her children had a meal on the way to\r\nVarennes. The three successive “Tivoli” were partly on the site of No.\r\n27, in this old street. There too was the “Club de Clichy,” whose\r\nmembers opposed the government of the Directoire. The whole district\r\nleading up to the heights of Montmartre was then, as now, a quarter of\r\npopular places of amusement, the habitation of _artistes_ of varying\r\ndegree, but we find here few old-time vestiges. Where Rue Nouvelle was\r\nopened in 1879 the prison de Clichy, a debtor’s prison, had previously\r\nstood. No. 81 is the four-footed animals’ hospital founded in 1811. Zola\r\ndied at No. 21 Rue de Bruxelles. Heine lived from 1848-57 at No. 50 Rue\r\nAmsterdam. Rue Blanche was Rue de la Croix-Blanche in the seventeenth\r\ncentury. Berlioz lived at No. 43. Roman remains were found beneath Nos.\r\n16-18. Rue Pigalle has been known by six or seven different names, at\r\none time that of Rue du Champ-de-Repos, on account of the proximity of\r\nthe cemetery St-Roch. No. 12 belonged to Scribe, who died there (1861).\r\nNo. 67 is an ancient station for post-horses. Place Pigalle was in past\r\ndays Place de la Barrière de Montmartre. The fountain is on the site of\r\nthe ancient custom-house. Puvis de Chavannes and Henner had their\r\nstudios at No. 11, now a restaurant. Rue de la Rochechouart made across\r\nabbey lands, the lower part dating from 1672, records the name of an\r\nabbess of Montmartre. Gounod lived at No. 17 in 1867. Halévy in 1841.\r\nThe Musée Gustave Moreau at No. 14 was the great artist’s own _hôtel_,\r\nbequeathed with its valuable collection to the State at his death in\r\n1898. Marshal Ney lived at No. 12. In Rue de la Tour des Dames a\r\nwindmill tower, the property of the nuns of Montmartre, stood\r\nundisturbed from the fifteenth century to the early part of the\r\nnineteenth. The modern mansion at No. 3 (1822) is on land belonging in\r\nolden days to the Grimaldi. Talma died in 1826 at No. 9. Rue la Bruyère\r\nhas always been inhabited by distinguished artists and literary men.\r\nBerlioz lived for a time at No. 45. Rue Henner, named after the artist\r\nwho died at No. 5 Rue la Bruyère, is the old Rue Léonie. We see an\r\nancient and interesting house at No. 13. No. 12 hôtel des Auteurs et\r\nCompositeurs Dramatiques, a society founded in 1791 by Beaumarchais.\r\n\r\nRue de Douai reminds us through its whole length of noted literary men\r\nand artists of the nineteenth century. Halévy and also notable artists\r\nhave lived at No. 69. Ivan Tourgueneff at No. 50. Francisque Sarcey at\r\nNo. 59. Jules Moriac died at No. 32 (1882). Gustave Doré and also Halévy\r\nlived for a time at No. 22. Claretie at No. 10. Edmond About owned No.\r\n6.\r\n\r\nThe old Rue Victor-Massé was for long Rue de Laval in memory of the last\r\nabbess of Montmartre. At No. 9, the abode of an antiquarian, we see\r\nremarkably good modern statuary on the Renaissance frontage. No. 12\r\ntill late years was l’hôtel de Chat Noir, the first of the artistic\r\n_montmartrois cabarets_ due to M. Salis (1881). At No. 26 we turn into\r\nAvenue Frochot, where Alexandre Dumas, _père_, lived, where at No. 1 the\r\nmusical composer Victor Massé died (1884), and of which almost every\r\nhouse is, or once was, the abode of artists. Passing down Rue\r\nHenri-Monnier, formerly Rue Breda, which with Place Breda was, during\r\nthe first half of the nineteenth century, a quarter forbidden to\r\nrespectable women, we come to Rue Notre-Dame de Lorette. It dates from\r\nthe same period as the church built there (1823-37), and wherein we see\r\nexcellent nineteenth-century frescoes and paintings. This street, like\r\nmost of those around it, has been inhabited by men of distinction in art\r\nor letters: Isabey, Daubigny, etc. Mignet lived there in 1849. Rue\r\nSt-Georges dates from the early years of the eighteenth century. Place\r\nSt-Georges was opened a century later on land belonging to the Dosne\r\nfamily. Mme Dosne and her son-in-law lived at No. 27. The house was\r\nburnt down in 1871, rebuilt by the State, given to l’Institut by Mlle\r\nDosne in 1905, and organized as a public library of contemporary\r\nhistory. Nos. 15-13, now the _Illustration_ office, date from 1788.\r\nAuber died at No. 22 (1871). The _hôtel_ at No. 2 was owned by Barras\r\nand inhabited at one time by Mme Tallien.\r\n\r\nThe three busy streets, Rue Laffitte, Rue le Peletier, Rue Drouot, start\r\nfrom boulevard des Italiens, cross streets we have already looked into,\r\nand are connected with others of scant historic interest.\r\n\r\nRue Laffitte, so named in 1830 in memory of the great financier who laid\r\nthe foundation of his wealthy future when an impecunious lad, by\r\nstooping, under the eye of the commercial magnate waiting to interview\r\nhim, to pick up a pin that lay in his path. Laffitte died Regent of the\r\nBanque de France. So popular was he that when after 1830 he found\r\nhimself forced to sell his handsome mansion No. 19--l’hôtel de la\r\nBorde--a national subscription was got up enabling him to buy it back.\r\nOffenbach lived at No. 11. At No. 12 we find an interesting old court.\r\nThe great art lover and collector, the Marquis of Hertford, lived at No.\r\n2, the old hôtel d’Aubeterre. No. 1, once known as la Maison Dorée, now\r\na post office, was the old hôtel Stainville inhabited by the Communist\r\nCerutti who, in his time, gave his name to the street. Mme Tallien also\r\nlived there. For some years before 1909 it was the much frequented\r\nTaverne Laffitte.\r\n\r\nIn Rue Le Peletier, the Opera-house burnt down in 1783, was from the\r\nearly years of the nineteenth century on the site of two old mansions:\r\nl’hôtel de Choiseul and l’hôtel de Grammont. On the site of No. 2,\r\nOrsini tried to assassinate Napoléon III. At No. 22 we see a Protestant\r\nchurch built in the time of Napoléon I.\r\n\r\nRue Drouot, the Salle des Ventes, the great Paris “Auction-rooms” at No.\r\n9, built in 1851, is on the site of the ancient hôtel Pinon de Quincy,\r\nsubsequently a Mairie. The present Mairie of the arrondissement at No. 6\r\ndates from 1750. In the Revolutionary year 1792 it was the War Office,\r\nthen the Salon des Étrangers where masked balls were given: les bals des\r\nVictimes. No. 2 the _Gaulois_ office, almost wholly rebuilt at the end\r\nof the eighteenth century and again in 1811, was originally a fine\r\nmansion built in 1717, the home of Le Tellier, later of the duc de\r\nTalleyrand, and later still the first Paris Jockey Club (1836-57). The\r\nfamous dancer Taglioni also lived here at one time.\r\n\r\nRue Grange-Batelière was a farm--_la grange bataillée_--with fortified\r\ntowers, owned in the twelfth century by the nuns of Ste-Opportune. At\r\nNo. 10 we see the handsome _hôtel_ with fine staircase and statues,\r\nbuilt in 1785 for a gallant captain of the Gardes Françaises. There in\r\nthe days of Napoléon III was the Cercle Romantique, where Victor Hugo,\r\nA. de Musset and other literary celebrities were wont to meet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nON THE SLOPES OF THE _BUTTE_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rue du Faubourg Montmartre is one of the most ancient of Paris\r\nroadways, for it led, from the earliest days of French history, to the\r\nhill-top where St-Denis and his two companions had been put to death.\r\nOnly once has the ancient name been changed--at the Revolution, when it\r\nwas for a time Faubourg Marat. We see here a few old-time houses. The\r\nbathing establishment at No. 4 was a private _hôtel_ in the days of\r\nLouis XV. Scribe lived at No. 7. The ancient cemetery _chapelle_,\r\nSt-Jean-Porte-Latine, stood from 1780-1836 on the site of No. 60.\r\n\r\nRue des Martyrs, named in memory of the Christian missionaries who\r\npassed there to their death, so called in its whole length only since\r\n1868, has ever been the habitation of artists. We see few interesting\r\nvestiges. From 1872 it has been a market street. Costermongers’ carts\r\nline it from end to end several days a week. The restaurant de la Biche\r\nat No. 37 claims to date from 1662. The once-famous restaurant du Faisan\r\nDoré was at No. 7. The short streets opening out of this long one date\r\nfor the most part from the early years of the nineteenth century and\r\nform, with the longer ones of the district, the Paris artists’ quarter.\r\n\r\nRue de la Tour d’Auvergne records the name of an abbess of Montmartre.\r\nVictor Hugo lived at No. 41 at the time of the _coup d’état_, fled\r\nthence to exile in England. The school at No. 31 is on the site of\r\ngardens once hired for the children of the duc d’Orléans, the pupils of\r\nMme de Genlis, to play in, then owned by Alphonse Karr. We see at No. 14\r\na charming statue “Le joueur de flute.”\r\n\r\nRue Rochechouart records the name of another abbess. At No. 7, now a\r\nprinting house, abbé Loyson gave his lectures. Rue Cadet, formerly Rue\r\nde la Voirie, records the name of a family of gardeners, owners of the\r\nClos Cadet, from the time of Charles IX. Nos. 9, 16, 24 are\r\neighteenth-century structures. Rue Richer was known in the earlier years\r\nof the eighteenth century as Rue de l’Égout. Augustin Thierry lived here\r\nfor two years (1831-33). No. 18 was the office of the modern\r\nrevolutionary paper _La Lanterne_. Marshal Ney lived at the _hôtel_\r\nnumbered 13. The Folies Bergères at No. 32 was built in 1865 on the site\r\nof the _hôtel_ of comte Talleyrand-Périgord. In Rue Saulnier, recording\r\nthe name of another famous family of gardeners, we see at No. 21 the\r\nhouse once inhabited by Rouget de Lisle, composer of the “Marseillaise.”\r\nRue Bergère was in seventeenth-century days an _impasse_. Casimir\r\nDelavigne lived at No. 5. Scribe in his youth at No. 7, in later life at\r\na _hôtel_ on the site of No. 20, which was in eighteenth-century days\r\nthe home of M. d’Étiolles, the husband of La Pompadour. The Comptoir\r\nd’Escompte at No. 14 was built in 1848, on the site of several old\r\n_hôtels_, notably hôtel St-Georges, the home of the marquis de Mirabeau,\r\nfather of the orator.\r\n\r\nRue du Faubourg Poissonière, its odd numbers in the 9th its even ones in\r\nthe 10th arrondissement, shows us many interesting old houses and we\r\nfind quaint old streets leading out of it. It dates as a thoroughfare\r\nfrom the middle of the seventeenth century, named then Chaussée de la\r\nNouvelle France. Later it was Rue Ste-Anne, from an ancient chapel in\r\nthe vicinity, yielding finally in the matter of name to the\r\nall-important fish-market to which it led--the poissonnerie des Halles.\r\nIn the court at No. 2 we find a Pavillon Louis XVI. The crimson walls of\r\nthe _Matin_ office was in past days the private _hôtel_ where colonel de\r\nla Bedoyère was arrested (1815). We see interesting old houses at Nos.\r\n9-13. No. 15, in old days hôtel des Menus Plaisirs du Roi, was with two\r\nadjoining houses taken at the end of the eighteenth century for the\r\nConservatoire de Musique, an institution founded (1784) by the marquis\r\nde Breteuil, as the École Royale de Chant et de Déclamation, with the\r\nspecial aim of training _artistes_ for the court theatre. Closed at the\r\nRevolution, it was reopened in calmer days and, under the direction of\r\nCherubini, became world-famed. Ambroise Thomas died there in 1895. In\r\n1911 the Conservatoire was moved away to modern quarters in Rue de\r\nMadrid and the old building razed.\r\n\r\nThe balcony on the garden side at No. 19, an eighteenth-century house\r\nwith many interesting vestiges, is formed of a fifteenth-century\r\ngravestone. Cherubini lived at No. 25. The church St-Eugène which we see\r\nin Rue Cecile, its interior entirely of cast iron, was so named by\r\nNapoléon III’s express wish as a souvenir of his wedding. The fine\r\n_hôtel_ at No. 30 was the home of Marshal Ney. Nos. 32, 42, 42 _bis_, 52\r\nand 56 where Corot died in 1875, the little vaulted Rue Ambroise-Thomas,\r\nopening at No. 57, the fine house at No. 58, and Nos. 65 and 80, all\r\nshow us characteristic old-time features. At No. 82 we see an infantry\r\nbarracks, once known as la Nouvelle France, a Caserne des Gardes\r\nFrançaises. Its canteen is said to be the old bedroom of “sergeant\r\nBernadotte,” destined to become King of Sweden. Here Hoche, too, was\r\nsergeant. The bathing establishment of Rue de Montholon, opening out of\r\nthe faubourg at No. 89, was the home of Méhul, author of _le Chant du\r\nDépart_; he died here in 1817. The street records the family name of the\r\nGeneral who went with Napoléon to St. Helena. Another abbess of\r\nMontmartre is memorized by Rue Bellefond, a seventeenth-century street\r\nopening at No. 107. The first Paris gasworks was set up on the site of\r\nNo. 129. At No. 138 we see a wooden house, in Gothic style, beautifully\r\nmade, owned and lived in by a carpenter who plies his trade there.\r\nAvenue Trudaine is modern (1821), named in memory of a Prévôt des\r\nMarchands of the seventeenth and early years of the eighteenth century.\r\nThe Collège Rollin, at No. 12, is on the site of the ancient Montmartre\r\nslaughterhouses. The painter Alfred Stevens died at No. 17 in 1906.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nTHREE ANCIENT FAUBOURGS\r\n\r\n\r\nARRONDISSEMENT X. (ENTREPÔT)\r\n\r\nThe chief thoroughfares of historic interest in this arrondissement are\r\nthe two ancient streets which stretch through its whole length: Rue du\r\nFaubourg St-Denis and Rue du Faubourg St-Martin, and the odd-number side\r\nof Rue du Faubourg du Temple.\r\n\r\nRue du Faubourg St-Denis, the ancient road to the abbey St-Denis, known\r\nin earlier days in part as Faubourg St-Lazare, then as Faubourg-de-Gloire,\r\nhas still many characteristic old-time buildings. The Passage du\r\nBois-de-Boulogne was the starting-place for the St-Denis coaches. At\r\nNo. 14 we find an interesting old court; over Nos. 21-44 and at 33 of\r\nthe little Rue d’Enghein old signs; No. 48 was the _Fiacre_ office in\r\nthe time of the Directoire, then the famous commercial firm Laffitte\r\nand Caillard. Where we see the Cour des Petites-Écuries, the courtesan\r\nNinon de Lenclos had a country house. Félix Faure, Président of the\r\nFrench Republic from 1895 to 1899, was born at No. 65 in 1841. The old\r\nhouse No. 71 formed part of the convent des Filles Dieu. The houses\r\nNos. 99 to 105 were dependencies of St-Lazare, now the Paris Prison for\r\nWomen, which we come to at No. 107, originally a leper-house, founded\r\nin the thirteenth century by the hospitaliers de St-Lazare. It was an\r\nextensive foundation, possessing the right of administering justice and\r\nhad its own prison and gallows. The Lazarists united with the priests\r\nof the Mission organized by St-Vincent-de-Paul, and in their day the\r\narea covered by the cow-houses, the stables, the various buildings\r\nsheltering or storing whatever was needed for the missioners, stretched\r\nfrom the Faubourg St-Denis to the Rues de Paradis, de Dunkerque and du\r\nFaubourg Poissonnière. At one time, when leprosy had ceased to be rife\r\nin Paris, the hospital was used as a prison for erring sons of good\r\nfamily. In 1793 it became one of the numerous revolutionary prisons;\r\nAndré Chenier, Marie Louise de Montmorency-Laval, the last abbess of\r\nMontmartre, were among the _suspects_ shut up there; and the Rue du\r\nFaubourg St-Denis was renamed Rue Franciade. St-Lazare was specially\r\nobnoxious to Revolutionists, for there the Kings of France had been wont\r\nto make a brief stay on each State entry into the city, and there, on\r\ntheir last journey out of it, they had halted in their coffin, on the\r\nway to St-Denis. The remains of an ancient crypt were discovered in 1898\r\nbelow the pavement.\r\n\r\nRue de l’Échiquier was opened in 1772, cut through convent lands.\r\nStretching behind No. 43, till far into the nineteenth century, was the\r\ngraveyard of the parish Notre-Dame-de-Bonne-Nouvelle. No. 48 was the\r\nwell-known dancing-hall, Pavillon de l’Échiquier, before and under the\r\nDirectoire. Rue du Paradis, in the seventeenth century Rue St-Lazare, is\r\nnoted for its pottery shops. At No. 58 Corot, the great landscape\r\npainter who lived hard by, had his studio. The capitulation of Paris in\r\n1814 was signed at No. 51, the abode of the duc de Raguse. Leading out\r\nof Rue de Chabrol at No. 7 we find the old-world Passage de la\r\nFerme-St-Lazare and a courtyard, relics of the Lazarists farm. Rue\r\nd’Hauteville, so called from the title of a Prévôt des Marchands, comte\r\nd’Hauteville, was known in earlier times as Rue la Michodière, his\r\nfamily name. In the court at No. 58 we come upon a _hôtel_ which was the\r\nabode of Bourrienne, Napoléon’s secretary; its rooms are an interesting\r\nexample of the style of the period. The pillared pavilion at No. 6\r\n_bis_, Passage Violet, dates only from 1840.\r\n\r\nRue de Strasbourg, where the courtyard of the Gare de l’Est now\r\nstretches, was the site in olden days of one of the great Paris fairs,\r\nthe Foire St-Laurent, held annually, lasting two months, a privilege of\r\nthe Lazarist monks. It was at this fair that the first café-concerts\r\nwere opened. The Comédie-Italienne, too, first played there. Rue de la\r\nFidélité, on the eastern side of the Faubourg St-Denis, records the name\r\ngiven to the church St-Laurent in Revolution days; it lies across the\r\nsite of the couvent des Filles-de-la-Charité founded by\r\nSt-Vincent-de-Paul and Louise de Marillac, of which we find some traces\r\nat No. 9.\r\n\r\nThe northern end of Rue du Faubourg St-Martin was long known as Rue du\r\nFaubourg St-Laurent; zealously stamping out all names recording saints,\r\nthe Revolutionists called this long thoroughfare Faubourg du Nord. We\r\nfind ancient houses, vestiges of past ages, at every step, and the\r\nmodern structures seen at intervals are on sites of historic interest.\r\nThe baker’s shop at No. 44, “A l’Industrie,” claims to have existed from\r\nthe year 1679. No. 59 is the site of the first Old Catholic church,\r\nfounded in 1831 by abbé Chatel. The Mairie at No. 76 covers the site of\r\nan ancient barracks, and of a bridge which once spanned the brook\r\nMénilmontant. An ancient arch was found beneath the soil in 1896. Rue\r\ndes Marais, which opens at No. 86, dates from the seventeenth century.\r\nHere till 1860 stood the dwelling of the famous public headsman Sanson\r\nand of his descendants, _painted red_! At No. 119 we see the _chevet_ of\r\nthe church St-Laurent, the only ancient part of the church as we know\r\nit. In the little Rue Sibour, opening at No. 121, recording the name of\r\nthe archbishop of Paris who died in 1857, we find an ancient house, now\r\na bathing establishment. No. 160 covers land once the graveyard of les\r\nRécollets. The short Rue Chaudron records the name of a fountain once\r\nthere. The bulky fountains higher up are modern (1849), built by public\r\nsubscription.\r\n\r\nRue du Château d’Eau was formed of two old streets: Rue Neuve\r\nSt-Nicolas-St-Martin and Rue Neuve St-Jean, joined in 1851 and named\r\nafter a fountain formerly in the centre of the what is now Place de la\r\nRépublique. At No. 39 we see the house said to be the smallest in the\r\ncity--its breadth one mètre. In the walls of the tobacconist’s shop at\r\nNo. 55, “la Carotte Percée,” we see holes made by the bullets of the\r\nCommunards in 1871. At No. 6 of the modern Rue Pierre-Bullet, now a gimp\r\nfactory, we find a house of remarkable interest, beautifully decorated\r\nby its builder and owner, the artist Gonthière, who had invented the\r\nprocess of dead-gilding. Ruin fell on the unhappy artist. His house was\r\nseized in 1781 and he died in great poverty in 1813.\r\n\r\nCrossing the whole northern length of the arrondissement is the busy\r\ncommercial Rue Lafayette, its one point of interest for us the church\r\nSt-Vincent-de-Paul, built in the form of a Roman basilica between the\r\nyears 1824-44, on the site of a Lazariste structure known as the\r\nBelvédère. Within we see fine statuary; and glorious frescoes, the work\r\nof Flandrin, cover the walls on every side. None of the streets in the\r\nvicinity of the church show points of historic interest.\r\n\r\nRue Louis-Blanc, existing in its upper part in the eighteenth century\r\nunder another name, prolonged in the nineteenth, has one tragically\r\nhistoric spot, that where it meets Rue Grange-aux-Belles. On that spot\r\nfrom the year 1230, or thereabouts, to 1761, on land owned by comte\r\nFulcon or Faulcon, stood the famous gibet de Montfaucon. It was of\r\nprodigious size, a great square frame with pillars and iron-chains,\r\nsixteen _pendus_ could hang there at one time. The most noted criminals,\r\nreal or supposed, many bearing the noblest names of France, were hung\r\nthere, left to swing for days in public view--the _noblesse_ from the\r\nCourt and the _peuple_ from the sordid streets around crowding together\r\nto see the sight. The ghastly remains fell into a pit beneath the\r\n_gibet_ and so found burial. Later a more orderly place of interment was\r\narranged on that hill-top. The church of St-Georges now stands on the\r\nsite.\r\n\r\nRue de la Grange-aux-Belles, so well known nowadays as the seat at No.\r\n33 of the C.G.T.--the Conféderation du Travail, where all Labour\r\nquestions are discussed, and where in these days of great strikes, the\r\nParis Opera on strike gave gala performances, was originally Rue de la\r\nGrange-aux-Pelles, a _pelle_ or _pellée_ being a standard measure of\r\nwood. The finance minister Clavière, Roland’s associate, lived here and\r\nthe authorities borrowed from him the green wooden cart which bore Louis\r\nXVI to the scaffold. The painter Abel de Payol lived at No. 13 (1822). A\r\nProtestant cemetery once stretched across the land in the centre of the\r\nstreet down to Rue des Écluses St-Martin. There, in 1905, were found the\r\nremains of the famous _corsaire_ Paul Jones, transported in solemn\r\nstate to America shortly afterwards. Turning into Rue Bichat we come to\r\nthe Hôpital St-Louis, founded by Henri IV. The King had been one of many\r\nsufferers from an epidemic which had raged in Paris in the year 1606. On\r\nhis recovery the _bon Roi_ commanded the building of a hospital to be\r\ncalled by the name of the saint-king, Louis IX, who had died of the\r\nplague some three hundred years before. The quaint old edifice with\r\nred-tiled roofs, old-world windows, fine archways surrounding a court\r\nbright with flowers and shaded by venerable trees, carries us back in\r\nmind to the age of the _bon Roi_ to whom the hospital was due. No. 21\r\nwas the hospital farm. In Rue Alibert, erewhile an _impasse_, we see one\r\nor two ancient houses, at the corner a pavilion of the time of Henri IV,\r\nthe property of the hospital. Rue St-Maur runs on into the 11th\r\narrondissement, a street formed in the nineteenth century by three\r\nseventeenth-century roads, one of which was Rue Maur or des Morts. We\r\nnotice old houses and ancient vestiges here and there.\r\n\r\nRue du Faubourg du Temple marks the boundary between arrondissement X\r\nand XI, an ancient thoroughfare climbing to the heights of Belleville\r\nwith many old houses and courts, mostly squalid, and some curious old\r\nsigns. On the site of No. 18 Astley’s circus was set up in 1780.\r\n\r\nThe Rue de la Fontaine au Roi (seventeenth century), in 1792 Rue\r\nFontaine-Nationale, shows us at No. 13 a house with _porcelaine_\r\ndecorations set up here in 1773. Beneath the pavement of Rue\r\nPierre-Levée a druidical stone was unearthed in 1782. Rue de Malte\r\nrefers by its name to the Knights Templar of Malta, across whose land it\r\nwas cut. We see an ancient _cabaret_ at No. 57. Rue Darboy records the\r\nname of the archbishop of Paris, shot by the Communards in 1871; Rue\r\nDeguerry that of the vicar of the Madeleine who shared his fate. The\r\nchurch of St-Joseph is quite modern, 1860, despite its blackened walls.\r\nAvenue Parmentier running up into the 10th arrondissement is entirely\r\nmodern, recording the name of the man who made the potato known to\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nRue des Trois-Bornes shows us several old-time houses and at No. 39 a\r\ncharacteristic old court. We find some characteristic vestiges also in\r\nRue d’Angoulême. In Rue St-Ambroise we see the handsome modern church\r\nbuilt on the site of the ancient church des Annociades. The monastery of\r\nthe Annociades was sold in lots, and became in part by turns a barracks,\r\na military hospital, a hospital for incurables, and was razed to the\r\nground in 1864. At Musée Carnavalet we may see bas-reliefs taken from\r\nthe fountain once on the space before the church. Rue Popincourt, which\r\ngives its name to the arrondissement, records the existence in past days\r\nof a sire Jean de Popincourt whose manor-house was here, and a\r\nsixteenth-century village, which became later part of Faubourg\r\nSt-Antoine. Rue du Chemin-Vert dates from 1650, but has few interesting\r\nfeatures. Parmentier died at No. 68 in 1813.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nIN THE PARIS “EAST END”\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are now in the vicinity of the largest and most important of the\r\nParis cemeteries--Père Lachaise. But it lies in the 20th arrondissement.\r\nThe streets of this 10th arrondissement leading east approach its\r\nboundary walls--its gates. Rue de la Roquette comes to it from the\r\nvicinity of the Bastille. La Roquette was a country house built in the\r\nsixteenth century, a favourite resort of the princes of the Valois line.\r\nThen, towards the end of the seventeenth century, the house was given\r\nover to the nuns Hospitalières of Place-Royale. The convent, suppressed\r\nat the Revolution, became State property and in 1837 was used as the\r\nprison for criminals condemned to death. The guillotine was set up on\r\nthe five stones we see at the entrance to Rue Croix-Faubin. The\r\nprisoners called the spot l’Abbaye des Cinq Pierres. It was there that\r\nMonseigneur Darboy and abbé Deguerry were put to death in 1871. On the\r\nday following fifty-two prisoners, chiefly monks and Paris Guards, were\r\nled from that prison to the heights of Belleville and shot in Rue Haxo.\r\nRead _à ce propos_ Coppée’s striking drama _Le Pater_. La Roquette is\r\nnow a prison for youthful offenders, a sort of House of Correction.\r\n\r\nLower down the street we find here and there an ancient house or an old\r\nsign. The fountain at No. 70 is modern (1846). The curious old Cour du\r\nCantal at No. 22 is inhabited mostly by Auvergnats. Rue de Charonne,\r\nanother street stretching through the whole length of the\r\narrondissement, in olden days the Charonne road, starts from the Rue du\r\nFaubourg St-Antoine, where at No. 1 we see a fountain dating from 1710.\r\nAlong its whole length we find vestiges of bygone times. It is a\r\ndistrict of ironmongers and workers in iron and workman’s tools. A\r\ndistrict, too, of popular dancing saloons. At No. 51 we see l’hôtel de\r\nMortagne, built in 1711, where Vaucanson first exhibited his collection\r\nof mechanical instruments. Bequeathed to the State, that collection was\r\nthe nucleus of the Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers: Arts and Crafts\r\nInstitution (_see_ p. 64). Here the great mechanic died in 1782. No. 97,\r\nonce a Benedictine convent, was subsequently a private mansion, then a\r\nfactory, then in part a Protestant chapel. The École Maternelle at No.\r\n99 was in past days a priory of “Bon Secours” (seventeenth century). No.\r\n98 is on the site of a convent razed in 1906. There are remains of\r\nanother convent at Nos. 100, 102. No. 161 was the famous “Maison de\r\nSanté,” owned by Robespierre’s friend Dr. Belhomme, to which he added\r\nthe adjoining _hôtel_ of the marquis de Chabanais. There, during the\r\nTerror, he received prisoners as “paying guests.” His prices were\r\nenormous and on a rising scale ... the guests who could not pay at the\r\nrequired rate were turned adrift on the road to the guillotine. These\r\nwalls sheltered the duchesse d’Orléans, the mother of Louis-Philippe,\r\nprotected by her faithful friend known as comte de Folmon, in reality\r\nthe deputé Rouzet, and many other notable persons of those troubled\r\nyears. On the left side of the door we see the figures 1726, relic of an\r\nancient system of numbering. The Flemish church de la Sainte Famille at\r\n181 is modern (1862).\r\n\r\nCrossing Rue de Charonne in its earlier course, we come upon the\r\nsixteenth-century Rue Basfroi, a corruption of _beffroi_, referring to\r\nthe belfry of the ancient church Ste-Marguerite in Rue St-Bernard.\r\nSte-Marguerite, founded in 1624 as a convent chapel, rebuilt almost\r\nentirely in 1712, enlarged later, is interesting as the burial-place of\r\nthe Dauphin, or his substitute, in 1745, and as possessing a much-prized\r\nrelic, the body of St. Ovide, in whose honour the great annual fair was\r\nheld on Place Vendôme. A tiny cross up against the church wall marks the\r\ngrave where the son of Louis XVI was supposed to have been laid, but\r\nwhere on exhumation some years ago the bones of an older boy were found.\r\nWe see some other ancient tombs up against the walls of what remains of\r\nthat old churchyard, and on the wall of the apse of the church two very\r\nremarkable bas-reliefs, the work of an old-time abbé, M. Goy, a clever\r\nsculptor, to whom are due also many of the statues in the park at\r\nVersailles. Within the church we see several striking statues and a\r\nremarkable “Chapelle des Morts,” its walls entirely frescoed in\r\n_grisaille_ but in great need of restoration. From the end of Rue\r\nChancy, where at No. 22 we see an old carved wood balcony, we get an\r\ninteresting view of this historic old church.\r\n\r\nRue de Montreuil, leading to the village of the name, shows us many old\r\nhouses, one at No. 52 with statuettes and in the courtyard an ancient\r\nwell, and at No. 31, remains of the Folie Titon, within its walls a fine\r\nstaircase and ceiling, the latter damaged of late owing to a fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nON TRAGIC GROUND\r\n\r\n\r\nRue du Faubourg St-Antoine forms the boundary between the\r\narrondissements XI and XII. From end to end it shows us historic\r\nvestiges. It has played from earliest times an all-important part in\r\nFrench history, leading, when without the city walls, to Paris and the\r\nBastille from the fortress of Vincennes and lands beyond, while from the\r\ntime of its incorporation with Paris, popular political demonstrations\r\nunfailingly had their _mise en scène_ in the Rue du Faubourg St-Antoine.\r\nIn the seventeenth century it was a country road in its upper part, the\r\nChaussée St-Antoine, and led to the fine Abbaye St-Antoine-des-Champs;\r\nthe lower part was the “Chemin de Vincennes.” Along this road, between\r\nPicpus and the Bastille, the Frondeurs played their war-games. Turenne’s\r\narmy fired from the heights of Charonne, while the Queen-Mother, her\r\nson, Louis XIII, and Mazarin watched from Père-la-Chaise. At No. 8 lived\r\nthe regicide Pépin, Fieschis’ accomplice. The sign, the “Pascal Lamb,”\r\nat No. 18 dates from the eighteenth century. We see ancient signs all\r\nalong the street. The Square Trousseau at No. 118 is on the site of the\r\nfirst “Hospice des Enfants Trouvés,” built in 1674 on abbey land. In\r\n1792 it became the “Hôpital des Enfants de la Patrie.” The head of\r\nprincesse de Lamballe was buried in the chapel graveyard there. What is\r\nsupposed to be her skull was dug up here in 1904. In 1839 the hospital\r\nwas made an _annexe_ of the hôtel-Dieu, in 1880 it was Hôpital\r\nTrousseau, then in the first years of this twentieth century razed to\r\nthe ground. At No. 184 the hospital St-Antoine retains some vestiges of\r\nthe royal abbey that stood there in long-gone days. Founded in 1198, it\r\nwas like all the big abbeys of the age a small town in itself,\r\nsurrounded by high fortified walls. At the Revolution it was\r\nsequestrated, the church demolished. Till the early years of the\r\nnineteenth century, one of the most popular of Paris fairs was held on\r\nthe site of the old abbey, la Foire aux pains d’épices, which had its\r\norigin in an Easter week market held within the abbey precincts. The\r\nhouse No. 186 is on the site of the little chapel St-Pierre, razed in\r\n1797, where of old kings of France lay in state after their death. Two\r\ndaughters of Charles V were buried there. The fountain and butcher’s\r\nshop opposite the hospital date from the time of Louis XV, built by the\r\nnuns of the abbey and called la Petite Halle. The nuns alone had the\r\nright to sell meat to the population of the district in those old days.\r\nAlmost every house and courtyard and passage along the whole course of\r\nthis ancient thoroughfare dates, as we see, from days long past. In the\r\ncourts at Nos. 245 and 253 we find old wells.\r\n\r\nSo we reach Place de la Nation, of yore Place du Trône, styled in\r\nRevolution days Place du Trône Renversé, and the guillotine set up there\r\n“_en permanence_”: there 1340 persons fell beneath its knife, 54 in one\r\ntragic day. The two pavilions on the eastern side of the _place_ were\r\nthe custom-houses of pre-Revolution days. The monument in the centre is\r\nmodern (1899). Of the streets and avenues leading from the _place_, that\r\nof supreme interest is the old Rue Picpus, a curious name explained by\r\nsome etymologists as a corruption of Pique-Pusse, and referring to a\r\nsixteenth-century monk of the neighbourhood who succeeded in curing a\r\nnumber of people of an epidemic which studded their arms with spots like\r\nflea-bites and who was called henceforth “le Père Pique-Pusse.” In\r\nprevious days the upper part of the road--it was a road then, not yet a\r\nstreet--had been known as Chemin de la Croix-Rouge. Nos. 4 and 6 are the\r\nremains of an eighteenth-century pavilion, a _maison de santé_--house of\r\ndetention--where in 1786 St. Just was shut up for petty thefts committed\r\nin his own family. No. 10, a present-day _maison de santé_, is on the\r\nsite of a hunting-lodge of Henri IV. At No. 35 we see the Oratoire de\r\nPicpus, where is the statuette of Notre-Dame, de la Paix, once on the\r\ndoor of the Capucine convent, Rue St-Honoré; and here, behind the\r\nconvent garden, we find the cimetière Picpus and the railed pit where\r\nthe bodies of the 1340 persons beheaded on the Place du Trône Renversé\r\nwere cast in 1793, André Chenier among the number. Their burial-place\r\nwas unknown until some years later, when a poor woman, the daughter of a\r\nservant of the duc de Brissac, who, stealthily watching from afar, had\r\nseen her father and her brother fall on the scaffold, pointed it out.\r\nThe site was bought, walled in, an iron cross set up over it. Soon\r\nadjoining land was bought and the relatives of many of those who lay in\r\nthe pit were brought to be in death near to the members of their family\r\ncut off from them in life by the Revolutionist axe. We see their tombs\r\nin the carefully kept cemetery to which, from time to time, descendants\r\nof the different families come to be laid in their last long sleep. In\r\nthe corner closest up against the walls surrounding the pit we see the\r\nStars and Stripes of the United States, the “star-spangled banner”\r\nkeeping guard over the grave of La Fayette. The nuns of the convent have\r\ncharge of this pathetically interesting cemetery. At No. 42 we see more\r\nconvent walls stretching to Rue de Reuilly, now enclosing a carriage\r\nfactory. At No. 61 the doors of yet another, put later to various\r\nsecular uses. No. 76 is the Jewish hospital, founded by Rothschild in\r\n1852. No. 73 is the Hospice des Vieillards, worked by the Petites\r\nSœurs des Pauvres. On the wall at No. 88 we come upon an edict of\r\nLouis XV with the date 1727.\r\n\r\nRunning parallel with Rue Picpus is Rue de Reuilly, in long-gone days a\r\ncountry road leading to the Château at Romiliacum, the summer habitation\r\nof the early Merovingian kings. We see an ancient house at No. 12 and\r\nNo. 11 was the historic _brasserie_ owned by Santerre, commander-in-chief\r\nof the Paris Garde Nationale, its walls supposed to date from 1620.\r\nSanterre bought it in 1772. After the storming of the Bastille, two\r\nprisoners found within its walls, both mad, one aged, the other a noted\r\ncriminal, were sheltered there: there the keys and chains of the broken\r\nfortress were deposited. The barracks at No. 20 are on the site of ruins\r\nof the old Merovingian castle. The church, modern, of St-Eloi at No. 36\r\nhas no historic interest save that of its name, and no architectural\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nRue de Charenton is another ancient street. It runs through the whole of\r\nthe arrondissement from Place de la Bastille to the Bois de Vincennes.\r\nFrom 1800-15 it went by the name Rue de Marengo, for through a gate on\r\nits course, at the barrier of the village of Charenton and along its\r\nline, Napoléon re-entered Paris after his Italian campaigns. In its\r\nupper part it was known in olden days as Vallée de Fécamp. Through the\r\nhouse at No. 2, with the sign “A la Tour d’Argent,” Monseigneur Affre\r\ngot on to the barricades in 1848, to be shot down by the mob a few\r\nmoments later. No. 10 dates from the sixteenth century. The inn at No.\r\n12 is ancient. At No. 26 we see the chapel of the Blind Hospital, the\r\n“Quinze-Vingts,” formerly the parish church of the district. The\r\nQuinze-Vingts was founded by St. Louis for three hundred\r\n_gentilshommes_, i.e. men of gentle birth, on their return from the\r\ncrusades; their quarters were till 1780 on land owned by the monks of\r\nthe Cloître St-Honoré. Then this fine old _hôtel_ and grounds, built in\r\n1699 for the Mousquetaires Noirs, were bought for them. In the chapel\r\ncrypt the tombstone of the first archbishop of Paris, Mgr de Gondi, was\r\nfound a few years ago, and bits of broken sixteenth-century sculpture of\r\nexcellent workmanship. The little Rue Moreau, which opens at No. 40, was\r\nknown in the seventeenth century as Rue des Filles Anglaises, for\r\nEnglish nuns had a convent where now we see the Passage du Chêne-Vert.\r\nWe find characteristic old houses in Rue d’Aligre and an interesting old\r\n_place_ of the same name, in Revolutionary days a hay and straw market.\r\nThe short streets and passages of this neighbourhood date, with scarce\r\nan exception, from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Rue de la\r\nBrèche-aux-loups recalls the age when, in wintry weather, hungry wolves\r\ncame within the sight of the city. The statuette of Ste-Marguerite and\r\nthe inscription of No. 277 date from 1745. Passage de la Grande Pinte at\r\nNo. 295 records the days when drinking booths were a distinctive feature\r\nof the district. We see vestiges of an ancient cloister at No. 306, and\r\nat No. 312 an old farmyard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\nLES GOBELINS\r\n\r\n\r\nARRONDISSEMENT XIII. (GOBELINS)\r\n\r\nThe brothers Gobelin, Jehan and Philibert, famous dyers of the day,\r\nestablished their great factory on the banks of the Bièvre about the\r\nyear 1443. Jehan had a fine private mansion in the vicinity of his\r\ndye-works known as Le Cygne. At a little distance, on higher ground, was\r\nanother _hôtel_ known as la Folie Gobelin. The rich scarlet dye the\r\nbrothers turned out was greatly prized; their business prospered, grew\r\ninto a huge concern. But in the first year of the seventeenth century a\r\nFlemish firm of upholsterers came to Paris and established themselves on\r\nthe banks of the tributary of the Seine, entirely replacing the\r\nGobelins’ works. This in its turn yielded to another firm, but the name\r\nremained unchanged. A few years later the firm and all the buildings\r\nconnected therewith were taken over by the State, and in 1667, by the\r\ninitiative of the minister Colbert, were organized as the royal factory\r\n“des meubles de la Couronne.” On the ancient walls behind the modern\r\nfaçade we see two inscriptions referring to the founders of the\r\nworld-famed factory. This hinder part of the vast building is of special\r\ninterest to the lover of old-world vestiges. The central structure, two\r\nwings and the ancient chapel of the original building, still stand, and\r\naround on every side we see quaint old houses in tortuous streets,\r\ncourtyards of past centuries, where twentieth-century work goes on\r\napace, picturesque corners densely inhabited by a busy population. For\r\nthis is also the great tanning district of the city. Curious old-world\r\nsights meet us as we wind in and out among these streets and passages\r\nwhich have stood unchanged for several hundred years. The artistic work\r\nof the great factory was from the first given into the hands of men of\r\nnoted ability, beginning in 1667 with Charles le Brun; and from the\r\nfirst it was regarded as an institution of special interest and\r\nimportance. Visitors of mark, royal and other, lay and ecclesiastical,\r\nwere taken to see it. The Pope, when in Paris in 1805, did not fail to\r\nvisit “les Gobelins.” In 1826 the great Paris soap-works were removed\r\nfrom Chaillot and set up here in connection with the dye-works. The fine\r\nold building was set fire to by the Communards in 1871--much of it burnt\r\nto the ground, many priceless pieces of tapestry destroyed. At No. 17\r\nRue des Gobelins, in its earlier days Rue de la Bièvre, crossed by the\r\nstream so carefully hidden beneath its surface now, we see the old\r\n_castel_ de la Reine Blanche. It dates from the sixteenth century, on\r\nthe site of a more ancient _castel_, where tradition says the “_bals des\r\nardents_” were given, notably that of the year 1392 when the accident\r\ntook place which turned King Charles VI into a madman. But the “Reine\r\nBlanche,” for whom it was first built, was probably not the mother of\r\nSt. Louis, but the widow of Philippe de Valois, who died in 1398. In the\r\nsixteenth century relatives of the brothers Gobelin lived there. Then it\r\nwas the head office of the great factory. Revolutionists met there in\r\n1790 to organize the attack of June 20th. In Napoléon’s time it was a\r\nbrewery, now it is a tannery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CASTEL DE LA REINE BLANCHE]\r\n\r\nRue Croulebarbe, once on the banks of the Bièvre, has an old-world,\r\nvillage-like aspect. The buildings bordering the broad Avenue des\r\nGobelins are devoid of interest, but beneath several of them important\r\nRoman remains have been found, and besides the old streets running into\r\nthe avenue in the immediate vicinity of the Gobelins Factory, we find at\r\nintervals other old streets and passages with many interesting vestiges;\r\nat No. 37, the Cour des Rames. The city gate St-Marcel stood in past\r\ndays across the avenue where the house No. 45 now stands. In Rue Le Brun\r\nwe see the remains of the _hôtel_ where, in the early years of the\r\neighteenth century, dwelt Jean Julienne, the master of the Gobelins. Rue\r\ndu Banquier shows many curious old-time houses.\r\n\r\nIn Rue de la Glacière on the western side of the arrondissement, so\r\nnamed in long-gone days from an ice-house furnished from the Bièvre, and\r\nin the short streets leading out of it, we find old houses here and\r\nthere. Rue de la Tannerie was until quite modern times Rue des Anglaises\r\nfrom the couvent des Filles Anglaises, founded at Cambrai, established\r\nhere in 1664--the chief duty of the nuns being to offer prayers for the\r\nconversion of England to Romanism! Disturbed at the Revolution, they\r\nreturned to their own land and the convent became a prison under the\r\nTerror. At No. 28 of this old street we see vestiges of the chapel\r\ncloisters.\r\n\r\nCovering a large area in the east of this arrondissement is the hospice\r\nknown as La Salpétrière. In long-past days a powder magazine stood on\r\nthe site: traces of that old arsenal may still be seen in the hospital\r\nwash-house. The foundation of the hospice dates from Louis XIII, as a\r\nhouse for the reception of beggars. The present structure, the work of\r\nthe architect Vau, was built in the seventeenth century, destined for\r\nthe destitute and the mad. The fine chapel was built a few years later.\r\nAt the close of the century a woman’s prison was added, whither went\r\nmany of the Convulsionists of St. Médard (_see_ p. 150). Mme Lamotte\r\nconcerned in the _affaire du collier_ was shut up here. And in a scene\r\nof the well-known operette Manon Lescaut is shown within its walls. In\r\nSeptember, 1792, the Revolutionary mob broke into the prison, slew the\r\ncriminals, opened the doors to the light women shut up there. We see\r\nbefore us the “Cour des Massacres.” Then in 1883 la Salpétrière was\r\norganized as the “Hospice de la Vieillesse-Femmes.” There are five\r\nthousand beds. In 1908 the new hospital de la Pitié was built in its\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LA SALPÉTRIÈRE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\nTHE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF PORT-ROYAL\r\n\r\n\r\nARRONDISSEMENT XIV. (OBSERVATOIRE)\r\n\r\nThe boundary-line between arrondissements XIII and XIV is Rue de la\r\nSanté, the name of the great Paris prison which stands there. It brings\r\nus to the vicinity of the Paris Observatory and of the Hôpital Cochin.\r\nThe prison is a modern structure on a site known as la Charbonnerie,\r\nbecause of coal-mines once there. The Observatory, built over ancient\r\nquarries, was founded by Louis XIV’s minister Colbert, in 1667. A spiral\r\nstaircase of six hundred steps leads down to the cellars that erewhile\r\nwere mines. It was enlarged in 1730 and again in 1810, and the cupolas\r\nwere added at a later date. A stretch of Rue du Faubourg St-Jacques\r\nborders its eastern side, and there on the opposite side we see\r\nl’Hôpital Cochin, founded in 1780 by the then vicar of\r\nSt-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas, whose name it bears--enlarged in recent years.\r\nAt No. 34 of Rue du Faubourg St-Jacques we turn into the\r\nseventeenth-century Rue Cassini, so named in 1790 to memorize the\r\nseventeenth-century organizer of the Observatory. Here Balzac lived in\r\n1829 in a house no longer standing. The great painter J. P. Laurens has\r\nan _hôtel_ here. We find a Louis XVI monument in a court at No. 10.\r\nSubterranean passages, made and used in a past age by smugglers, have\r\nbeen discovered beneath the pavement of this old street.\r\n\r\nRue Denfert-Rochereau has its first numbers in arrondissement V. This\r\nwas the “Via Infera,” the Lower Road of the Romans. The name _Enfer_,\r\ngiven later, is said to refer, not to the place of torment, but to the\r\nhellish noise persistently made in a _hôtel_ there built by a son of\r\nHugues Capet, the hôtel Vauvert, hence the French expression, “envoyer\r\nles gens au diable vert”--_vert_ shortened from _Vauvert_, i.e. send\r\nthem off--far away--to the devil! _Enfer_ became _d’Enfert_, to which in\r\n1878 was added the name of the general who defended Belfort in 1870: not\r\nexactly a happy combination! Many persons of note have dwelt in this old\r\nstreet. No. 25 (arrondissement V) is an ancient Carmelite convent,\r\nbuilt, tradition says, on the site of a pagan temple: an oratory-chapel\r\ndedicated to St. Michael covered part of the site in early Christian\r\ndays and a public cemetery. An ancient crypt still exists. It was in the\r\nconvent here that Louise de la Vallière came to work till her death, in\r\n1710. That first convent and church were razed in 1797. The Carmelites\r\nbuilt a smaller one on the ancient grounds in 1802, and rebuilt their\r\nchapel in 1899. It did not serve them long. They were banished from\r\nFrance in 1901. The chapel, crypt and some vestiges of the ancient\r\nconvent are before us here. Modern streets--Rue Val de Grâce opened in\r\n1881, Rue Nicole in 1864--run where the rest of the vast convent walls\r\nonce rose. No. 57 is on the site of an ancient Roman burial-ground of\r\nwhich important traces were found in 1896. No. 68, ancient convent of\r\nthe Visitation. No. 72 built in 1650 as an Oratorian convent, a\r\nmaternity hospital under the Empire, now a children’s hospice. No. 71,\r\ncouvent du Bon Pasteur--House of Mercy--founded in the time of Louis\r\nXVI, bought by the Paris Municipality in 1891, its chapel burnt by the\r\nCommunards in 1871, rebuilt by the authorities of the Charity, worked\r\nnow by Sisters of St. Thomas de Villeneuve. Within its walls we see\r\ninteresting old-time features and beneath are the walls of reservoirs\r\ndating from the days when water was brought here from the heights of\r\nRungis. No. 75, ancient Eudiste convent and chapel; Châteaubriand once\r\ndwelt at No. 88 and with his wife founded at No. 92 the Infirmerie\r\nMarie-Thérèse, named after the duchesse d’Angoulême, daughter of Louis\r\nXVI, a home for poverty-stricken gentlepeople, transformed subsequently\r\ninto an asylum for aged priests. Mme de Châteaubriand lies buried there\r\nbeneath the high altar of the chapel.\r\n\r\nAvenue d’Orléans, in olden days Route Nationale de Paris à Orléans,\r\ndating from the eighteenth century, and smaller streets connected with\r\nit, show us many old houses, while in the Villa Adrienne, opening at No.\r\n17, we find a number of modern houses--pavilions--each bearing the name\r\nof a celebrity of past time. Rue de la Voie-Verte was so named from the\r\nmarket-gardens erewhile stretching here. Rue de la Tombe-Issoire runs\r\nacross the site of an ancient burial-ground where was an immense tomb,\r\nsaid to have been made for the body of a giant: Isore or Isïre, who,\r\naccording to the legend, attacked Paris at the head of a body of\r\nSarazins in the time of Charlemagne. Here and there along this street,\r\nas in the short streets leading out of it, we come upon interesting\r\nvestiges of the past, notably in Rue Hallé, opening at No. 42. The\r\npretty Parc Souris is quite modern. We find old houses in Avenue du\r\nChatillon, an eighteenth-century thoroughfare. Rue des Plantes leads us\r\nto Place de Montrouge, in the thirteenth century the centre of a village\r\nso named either after an old-time squire, lord of the manor, Guis de\r\nRouge, or because the soil is of red sandstone. The squire, maybe,\r\ngained his surname from the soil on which he built his château, while\r\nthe village took its name from the squire. Rue Didot, once known as Rue\r\ndes Terriers-aux-Lapins, memorizes the great printing-house founded in\r\n1713. Rue de Vanves, leading to what was in olden days the village of\r\nthe name, crosses Rue du Château at the point where in the eighteenth\r\ncentury the duc de Maine had a hunting-lodge. In Avenue du Maine we see\r\nancient houses at intervals. Rue du Moulin-Vert recalls the existence of\r\none of the numerous windmills on the land around the city in former\r\ndays. Rue de la Gaité (eighteenth century) has ever been true to its\r\nname or the name true to the locality--one of dancing saloons and other\r\npopular amusements. The Cinema des Mille Colonnes was in pre-cinema days\r\nthe “Bal des Mille Colonnes,” opened in 1833. Passing on up Avenue du\r\nMaine we come to arrondissement XV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\nIN THE SOUTH-WEST\r\n\r\n\r\nARRONDISSEMENT XV. (VAUGIRARD)\r\n\r\nRue Vaugirard, originally Val Girard, which we enter here, on its course\r\nfrom arrondissement VI (_see_ p. 164), is the longest street in Paris, a\r\nunion of several streets under one name, extending on beyond the city\r\nbounds. At No. 115 we find an ancient house recently restored by a man\r\nof artistic mind; at No. 144, ancient buildings connected with the old\r\nhospital l’Enfant-Jésus, its façade giving on Rue de Sèvres. At\r\nintervals all along the street, and in the short streets opening out of\r\nit, we come upon old-time houses, none, however, of special interest. In\r\nthis section of its course Rue de la Procession, opening at No. 247,\r\ndates from the close of the fourteenth century, a reminiscence of the\r\ndays when ecclesiastical processions passed along its line to the\r\nchurch. Rue Cambronne, named after the veteran of Waterloo, dates from\r\nthe first Empire and shows us at Nos. 98, 104, 117, houses of the time\r\nwhen it was Rue de l’École--i.e. l’École Militaire.\r\n\r\nThe modern church St-Lambert in Rue Gerbert replaces the ancient church\r\nof Vaugirard in Rue Dombasle, once Rue des Vignes, the centre of a\r\nvine-growing district, where till recent years stood the old orphanage\r\nof St-Vincent-de-Paul. Rue de la Croix-Nivert, traced in the early\r\nyears of the eighteenth century, records the existence of one of the\r\ncrosses to be found in old days at different points within and without\r\nthe bounds of the city. In Rue du Hameau, important Roman remains were\r\nfound a few years ago. In Rue Lecourbe, known in the seventeenth century\r\nas le Grand Chemin de Bretagne, in the nineteenth century for some years\r\nas Rue de Sèvres, like the old street it starts from at Square Pasteur,\r\nprehistoric remains were found in 1903. Rue Blomet, the old Meudon road,\r\nwas in past days the habitation of gardeners, several old gardeners’\r\ncottages still stand there. The district known as Grenelle, a village\r\nbeyond the Paris bounds till 1860, has few vestiges of interest. The\r\nfirst stone of its church, St-Jean Baptiste, was laid by the duchesse\r\nd’Angoulême, daughter of Louis XVI. The long modern Rue de la Convention\r\nis known beyond its immediate vicinity chiefly for the Hôpital Boucicaut\r\nbuilt by the founder and late owner of the Bon Marché.\r\n\r\nAvenue Suffren, bounding this arrondissement on its even-number side,\r\ndates from 1770. Rue Desaix was once le Chemin de l’Orme de Grenelle.\r\nRue de la Fédération memorizes the Fête de la Fédération held on the\r\nChamp de Mars in 1790. The oldest street of the district is Rue Dupleix,\r\na road in the fifteenth century and known in the sixteenth century as\r\nSentier de la Justice or Chemin du Gibet, a name which explains itself.\r\nThen it became Rue Neuve. The Château de Grenelle stood in old days on\r\nthe site of the barracks on Place Dupleix, used in the Revolution as a\r\npowder factory; there in 1794 a terrific explosion took place, killing\r\ntwelve hundred persons. Where the Grande Roue turns, on the ground now\r\nbright with flower-beds and grassy lawns, duels were fought erewhile.\r\nThis is the quarter of new streets, brand-new avenues.\r\n\r\nCrossing the Seine at this point we find ourselves in arrondissement\r\nXVI, for to its area south of the Étoile and surrounding avenues, were\r\nadded in 1860 the suburban villages of Passy and Auteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\nIN NEWER PARIS\r\n\r\n\r\nARRONDISSEMENT XVI. (PASSY)\r\n\r\nWe have left far behind us now Old Paris, the Paris of the Kings of\r\nFrance, of the upheaval of Revolution days. The 16th arrondissement,\r\nsave in the remotest corners of Passy and Auteuil, suburban villages\r\nstill in some respects, is the arrondissement of the “Nineteenth Century\r\nand After.” Round about the Étoile the Napoléonic stamp is very evident.\r\nIt is the district of the French Empire, First and Second. The Arc de\r\nTriomphe was Napoléon’s conception. The broad thoroughfare stretching as\r\nAvenue des Champs-Elysées to Place de la Concorde, as Avenue de la\r\nGrande Armée to the boundary of Neuilly, was planned by Napoléon I, as\r\nwere also the other eleven surrounding avenues. The erections of his day\r\nand following years were well designed, well built, solid, systematical,\r\nmathematically correct, excellent work as constructions--spacious, airy,\r\nhygienic, but devoid of architectural poetry. The buildings of the\r\nSecond Empire were a little less well designed, less well built and yet\r\nmore symmetrical, with a very marked utilitarian stamp and a marked lack\r\nof artistic inspiration. Those of a later date, with the exception of\r\nsome few edifices on ancient models, are, alas! for the most part,\r\nutilitarian only--supremely utilitarian. Paris dwelling-houses of\r\nto-day are, save for a fine _hôtel_ here and there, “_maisons de\r\nrapport_,” where _rapport_ is plainly their all-prevailing _raison\r\nd’être_. The new houses are one like the other, so like as to render new\r\nstreets devoid of landmarks: “_Où sont les jours d’Antan_,” when each\r\nstreet, each house had its distinctive feature? Only in the Paris of\r\ngenerations past.\r\n\r\nOf Napoléon’s avenues seven, if we include the odd-number side of Avenue\r\ndes Champs-Élysées and of the Grande Armée, are in this arrondissement.\r\nThe beautiful Avenue du Bois-de-Boulogne is due to Napoléon III, opened\r\nin 1854, as Avenue de l’Impératrice. Handsome mansions line it on both\r\nsides. One spot remained as it had been before the erection of all these\r\nfine _hôtels_ until recent years--a rude cottage-dwelling stood there,\r\nowned by a coal merchant who refused to sell the territory at any price.\r\nFrancs by the million were offered for the site--in vain. But it went at\r\nlast. In 1909 a private mansion worthy of its neighbour edifices was\r\nbuilt on the site.\r\n\r\nAvenue Victor-Hugo began in 1826 as Avenue Charles X. From the short Rue\r\ndu Dôme, on high ground opening out of it, we see in the distance the\r\n_dôme_ of the Invalides. To No. 117 the first _crêche_ opened in or near\r\nParis, at Chaillot (1844), was removed some years ago. Gambetta lived\r\nfor several years and died at No. 57, in another adjoining street, Rue\r\nSt-Didier. At No. 124 of the Avenue we see a bust of Victor-Hugo, who\r\ndied in 1885 in the house this one replaces. Place Victor-Hugo began in\r\n1830 as Rond-Point de Charles X. The figure of the poet set up in 1902\r\nis by Barrias. The church St-Honoré d’Eylau dates from 1852. It was\r\npillaged by the Fédérés in 1871. Lamartine passed the last year of his\r\nlife in a simple chalet near the square named after him; his statue\r\nthere dates from 1886.\r\n\r\nGeneral Boulanger lived at No. 3 Rue Yvon de Villarceau, opening out of\r\nRue Copernic. Rue Dosne is along the site of the extensive grounds left\r\nby Thiers. At No. 46 Rond-Point Bugeaud we see the foundation Thiers, a\r\nhandsome _hôtel_ bequeathed by the widow of the statesman as an\r\ninstitution for the benefit of young students of special aptitude in\r\nscience, philosophy, history.\r\n\r\nAvenue d’Eylau, planned to be Place du Prince Impérial, possessed till\r\nrecently, in a courtyard at No. 11, three bells supposed to be those of\r\nthe ancient Bastille clock.\r\n\r\nAvenue Malakoff, began in 1826 as Avenue St-Denis. At No. 66 we see the\r\nchapel of ease of St-Honoré d’Eylau, of original style and known as the\r\nCité Paroissiale St-Honoré.\r\n\r\nAvenue Kléber began in 1804 as Avenue du Roi de Rome. Beneath the\r\npavement at No. 79 there is a circular flight of steps built in 1786, to\r\ngo down to the Passy quarries.\r\n\r\nRue Galilée, opening out of it at No. 55, began as Rue des Chemin de\r\nVersailles. Rue Belloy was formed in 1886 on the site of the ancient\r\nChaillot reservoirs.\r\n\r\nAvenue d’Iéna lies along the line of the ancient Rue des Batailles de\r\nChaillot, where, in 1593, without the city bounds, Henri IV and\r\nGabrielle d’Estrées had a house. Rue Auguste-Vaquerie is the former Rue\r\ndes Bassins. The Anglican church there dedicated to St-George dates from\r\n1888 and is, like the French churches, always open--a friendly English\r\nchurch--with beautiful decorations and furnishings. The short Rue\r\nKeppler dates from 1772 and was at one time Rue Ste-Geneviève. Rue\r\nGeorges-Bizet lies along the line of an ancient Ruelle des Tourniquets,\r\na name reminiscent of country lanes and stiles; in its lower part it was\r\nof yore Rue des Blanchisseuses, where clean linen hung out freely to\r\ndry. The Greek church there, with its beautiful _Iconostase_ and\r\npaintings by Charles Lemaire, is modern (1895). Rue de Lubeck began as a\r\ntortuous seventeenth-century road, crossing the grounds of the ancient\r\nconvent of the Visitation.\r\n\r\nThe statue of Washington in the centre of Place d’Iéna, the scene of so\r\nmany momentous gatherings, was given by the women of the United States\r\n“_en mémoire de l’amitié et de l’aide fraternelle donnée par la France à\r\nleurs frères pendant la lutte pour l’indépendance_.” The Musée Guinet on\r\nthe site of the hippodrome of earlier years, an oriental museum, was\r\nopened in 1888. Rue Boissière, in the eighteenth century in part Rue de\r\nla Croix-Boissière, reminds us of the wooden crosses to which in olden\r\ndays the branches of box which replace palm were fixed on Palm Sunday.\r\nAlong Rue de Longchamp, then a country lane, seventeenth and\r\neighteenth-century Parisians passed in pilgrimage to Longchamp Abbey,\r\nwhile at an old farm on the Rond-Point, swept away of late years,\r\nramblers of note, Boileau and La Fontaine among the number, stopped to\r\ndrink milk fresh and pure. The name of the Bouquet de Longchamp recalls\r\nthe days when green trees clustered there. Rue Lauriston, a thoroughfare\r\nin the eighteenth century, was long known as Chemin du Bel-air.\r\n\r\nRue de Chaillot, which leads us to Avenue Marceau, was the High Street\r\nof the village known in the eleventh century by the Roman name\r\nColloelum. It was Crown property, and Louis XI gave it to Philippe de\r\nCommines. In 1659 the district became a Paris faubourg and in 1787 was\r\nincluded within the city bounds. There on the high land now the site of\r\nthe Trocadéro palace and gardens, the Château de Chaillot, its name\r\nchanged later to Grammont, was built by Catherine de’ Medici. Henriette,\r\nwidow of Charles I of England, back in her own land of France, made it\r\ninto a convent (1651). Its first Superior was Mlle de Lafayette; its\r\nwalls sheltered many women of note and rank, Louise de la Vallière is\r\nsaid to have fled thither twice, to be twice regained by the King. The\r\nchapel was on the site of the pond in the Trocadéro gardens. There the\r\nhearts of the Catholic Stuarts were taken for preservation. Suppressed\r\nat the Revolution, the convent was subsequently razed to the ground by\r\nNapoléon, who planned the erection of a palace there for his son the\r\n“_Roi de Rome_.” The old street has still several old houses easily\r\nrecognized: Nos. 5, 9, 19, etc. The church, on the site of an\r\neleventh-century chapel, dates from the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies, with a nineteenth-century chapel and presbytery.\r\n\r\nAvenue du Trocadéro, since 4th July, 1918, Avenue Wilson, was\r\ninaugurated as Avenue de l’Empereur, (Napoléon III). The palace, now a\r\nmuseum and concert-hall, was built on the crest of ancient quarries, for\r\nthe Exhibition of 1878, and the Place du Roi de Rome, in previous days\r\nPlace Ste-Marie, became Place du Trocadéro. The Musée Galliera, a museum\r\nof industrial art, was built in 1895 by the duchess whose maiden name\r\nBrignole is recorded in the short street opened across her property in\r\n1879. She had planned filling it with her magnificent collection of\r\npictures, but changed the destination of her legacy when France laicised\r\nher schools.\r\n\r\nAvenue Henri-Martin began, like Avenue du Trocadéro, as Avenue de\r\nl’Empereur (1858). The old _tour_ we see at No. 86 Rue de le Tour is\r\nsaid to have formed part of the Manor of Philippe-le-Bel. It was once a\r\nprison, then served as a windmill tower, and the street, erewhile Chemin\r\ndes Moines, Monk’s Road, became Rue du Moulin de la Tour. Few other\r\nvestiges of the past remain along its course. We see old houses at Nos.\r\n1, 66, 68. Rue Vineuse, crossing it, recalls the days when convent\r\nvineyards stretched there. It is, like Rue Franklin, once Rue Neuve des\r\nMinimes, of eighteenth-century date. Franklin’s statue was set up there\r\nin 1906, for his centenary. We see an old-time house at No. 1 Rue\r\nFranklin, and at No. 8 the home of Clemenceau, the capable Prime\r\nMinister of France of the late war. The cemetery above the reservoir was\r\nopened in 1803.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV\r\n\r\nTOWARDS THE WESTERN BOUNDARY\r\n\r\n\r\nRue de Passy, the ancient Grande Rue, the village High Street before the\r\ndistrict was included within the Paris boundary-line, dates from\r\nfifteenth-century days, when it was a fief, owned by Jeanne de Paillard,\r\nknown as La Dame de Passy; it reverted to the Crown under Louis XI, and\r\nwas bestowed on successive nobles. At the _carrefour_--the cross\r\nroads--where the tramcars now stop for Rue de la Tour, stood the\r\nseignorial gallows. The seignorial habitation, a château with extensive\r\ngrounds, was built in 1678; in 1826 the whole domain was sold and cut\r\nup. The district was known far and wide in past days on account of its\r\nmineral springs. Here and there along the street we see an ancient house\r\nstill standing. The narrow _impasse_ at No. 24 is ancient. The\r\nnineteenth-century poet Gustave Nadaud died at No. 63 in 1893. No. 84,\r\nnow razed, showed, until a few years ago, an interesting Louis XV façade\r\nin the courtyard, once a dependency of the Château de la Muette. Rue de\r\nla Pompe, named from the pump which supplied the Château de la Muette\r\nwith water, a country road in the eighteenth century, shows few vestiges\r\nof the past. No. 53 is part of an old Carmelite convent.\r\n\r\nChaussée de la Muette is a nineteenth-century prolongation of Rue de\r\nPassy. The château from which it takes its name was originally a\r\nhunting-lodge, stags and birds were carefully enclosed here during the\r\ntime of moulting (_la mue_, hence the name) in the days of Charles IX.\r\nMargaret de Valois, the notorious Reine Margot, was its first regular\r\ninhabitant. She gave the mansion to King Louis XIII when he came of age\r\nin 1615. It was rebuilt by the Regent in 1716 and became the favourite\r\nabode of his daughter the duchesse de Berri. There she died three years\r\nlater. It was the home of Louis XV during his minority. Mme de Pompadour\r\nlived there and had the doors beautifully painted. It was again rebuilt\r\nin 1764, Marie-Antoinette and the Dauphin, soon to be Louis XVI, spent\r\nthe first months of their married life there. It was from the Park de la\r\nMuette that the first balloon was sent up in 1783. The property was cut\r\nup in 1791, and in 1820 bought by Sebastien Érard of pianoforte fame,\r\nand once more rebuilt. Thus it came by the spindle-side to the comte de\r\nFranqueville; a big slice has been cut off in recent years for the\r\nmaking of a new street named after its present owner.[G]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUE DES EAUX, PASSY]\r\n\r\nAvenue du Ranelagh records the existence, in the latter years of the\r\neighteenth century, of the fashionable dancing hall and grounds opened\r\nhere in imitation of the Rotonde built in London by Lord Ranelagh.\r\nMarie-Antoinette was among the great ladies who danced there. The hall\r\nwas closed at the Revolution but was reopened and again the vogue under\r\nthe Directoire and until 1830, when it became a public dancing saloon.\r\nIt was demolished in 1858, the lawns were left to form a promenade. The\r\nstatue of La Fontaine dates from 1891. Rue du Ranelagh is wholly modern.\r\nRue Raynouard crossing it dates from the seventeenth century, when it\r\nwas the Grande Rue, later the Haute Rue of the quarter, to become later\r\nstill Rue Basse. Florian, the charming fable-writer, was wont to stay\r\nat No. 75. We see a fine old _hôtel_ at No. 69, and an old-world street,\r\nRue Guillou, close by. Rue des Vignes opening at No. 72 reminds us of\r\nthe vineyards once on these sunny slopes. No. 66 was the site of the\r\nhôtel Valentinois, where Franklin lived for several years and where he\r\nput up the first lightning conductor in France. No. 51 is ancient, and\r\nNo. 47 is known as la Maison de Balzac. In a pavilion in the garden\r\nsloping to the Seine he lived from 1842-48, lived and wrote, wrote\r\nincessantly there as elsewhere and always. There, carefully preserved,\r\nmay be seen the chair he sat in, the table he wrote at, the pen he used,\r\nand a hundred other personal relics. Lectures about the great novelist\r\nand subjects connected with his life and work are given there from time\r\nto time. We see ancient houses on to the end of this quaint street.\r\nMarie-Antoinette stayed from time to time at No. 42 to be within easy\r\nreach of her confessor, the Vicar of Passy; so tradition says. The\r\nsecond story of this house sheltered Béranger, 1833-35. The man of\r\nletters who gave his name to the street died at No. 36, in 1836. At No.\r\n21, the warrior, la Tour d’Auvergne, passed the years 1776-1800. Jean\r\nJacques Rousseau stayed with friends here and wrote his “Devin du\r\nVillage.” Mineral waters, such as made the springs of Passy renowned in\r\nbygone days, still bubble up in this fine park. The modern erection, No.\r\n19, is on the site of the ancient hôtel Lauzun, where the duc de\r\nSaint-Simon used to stay, and where the first steps were taken for the\r\nmarriage of Napoléon III. At No. 11 we turn for an instant into the\r\nquaint old Rue des Eaux, strikingly reminiscent of a past age, when the\r\ntonifying waters of Passy were drunk in a pavilion on the site of No.\r\n20. Rue de l’Annonciation began in the early years of the eighteenth\r\ncentury as Rue des Moulins. Here we see the church Notre-Dame-de-Grâce,\r\nbuilt as a chapel of ease for Auteuil by the Lord of Passy in 1660, to\r\nbecome a parish church, a few years later. It was restored and enlarged\r\nat subsequent dates. The ancient Passy cemetery lay across Rue Lekain.\r\nRue de Boulainvilliers stretches through what were once the grounds of\r\nthe Passy Château. Rue des Bauches, opening out of it, still narrow and\r\nquaint, was in olden days a lane through the _Bauches_, a word\r\nsignifying a marshy tract or used to designate hut-like dwellings on\r\nwaste, perhaps marshy land. Passy had within its bounds the Hautes\r\nBauches, and the Basses Bauches. We of the 16th arrondissement know the\r\nstreet nowadays more especially as that of the tax-paying office.\r\n\r\nRue de l’Assomption marking the boundary between Passy and Auteuil began\r\nas Rue des Tombereaux. The convent of the Assomption is a modern\r\nbuilding (1858), in an ancient park. The old château there, so secluded\r\non its tree-surrounded site as to go by the name of l’Invisible, rebuilt\r\nin 1782, was for a time the home of Talleyrand, later of the actress\r\nRachel, of Thiers, the statesman, of the comtesse de Montijo, mother of\r\nthe Empress Eugénie; the nuns came here from Rue de Chaillot in 1855.\r\nNo. 88 is an old convent-chapel used as chapel of ease for Passy.\r\n\r\nIn Avenue de Mozart we see modern structures only, but old-time streets\r\nopen out of it at intervals. It was in a house in Rue Bois-le-Vent, near\r\nthe château de la Muette, that André Chenier was arrested in 1794.\r\nBehind No. 13, of Rue Davioud we find traces of an old farmyard and a\r\nwell. Rue de la Cure refers by its name to the iron springs once there.\r\nRue de Ribéra is the ancient Rue de la Croix. Rue de la Source, was in\r\nold days Sente des Vignes. Benedictine nuns from St-Maur settled there\r\nin 1899 to be banished or laicized a few years later. Rue Raffet dates\r\nfrom the eighteenth century as Rue de la Grande Fontaine. Rue du Docteur\r\nBlanche, named to memorize the organizer of the well-known private\r\nasylum in the _hôtel_ once the dwelling of princesse de Lamballe, is the\r\nancient Fontis Road. Rue Poussin, and the short streets connected with\r\nit, all date from the middle of the nineteenth century, opened by the\r\nrailway company of the Ceinture line in the vicinity of their station at\r\nAuteuil. Rue des Perchamps, once Pares Campi, crosses the site of the\r\nancient cemetery of the district. In Rue la Fontaine, in olden days\r\nknown for its fountain of pure water, we find here and there an\r\neighteenth-century building among the garden-surrounded houses. In Rue\r\nThéophile Gautier, a tennis-court and tall houses let in flats cover the\r\nground where till 1908 stood the Château de Choiseul-Praslin, in its\r\nlatter years, till 1904, a convent of Dominican nuns. Rue de Remusat\r\nruns along the course of the ancient Grande Rue; Rue Félicien-David was\r\nthe first street flooded in the great inundation of 1910.[H] The street\r\nbecame a river three mètres deep. Rue Wilhem, of so commonplace an\r\naspect to-day, dates from the eighteenth century, when it was Sentier\r\ndes Arches, then Rue Ste-Geneviève. Place d’Auteuil, until 1867 Place\r\nd’Aguesseau, is on the site of the churchyard of past days. The monument\r\nwe see there was set up to the memory of D’Aguesseau and his wife by\r\ncommand of Louis XV, in 1753. This is the highest point in the district,\r\n_altus locus_--the origin, maybe, of the name Auteuil, unless the name\r\nrefers rather to the Druidical altars erected on a clearing here in the\r\ndays when the forest of Rouvray, spreading over the whole of what is now\r\nthe Bois de Boulogne, sheltered the venerable pagan priests. A church\r\nwas first built on the spot in the early years of the fourteenth\r\ncentury. At the Revolution the church was profaned, the tombs violated.\r\nThe present edifice dates from the latter years of the nineteenth\r\ncentury; its tower, in the form of a pontifical tiara, is an exact copy\r\nof the ancient tower. Rue d’Auteuil was in fifteenth-century days the\r\nsingle village street, la Grande Rue; the house at No. 2 is said to be\r\non the site of Molière’s country dwelling, but there is no authentic\r\nrecord of the exact site of the house at Auteuil, near the church, where\r\nthe great dramatist so often went for rest and country air. Auteuil was\r\nthe retreat for quiet and recuperation of the most noted men of letters\r\nand of art of the eighteenth century: Racine, Boileau, etc. No. 59 is on\r\nthe site of the house, burnt to the ground in 1871, wherein Victor Noir\r\nwas shot dead by Prince Pierre Napoléon. Where at the upper end of the\r\nstreet we see now houses of commonplace aspect and small shops, stood\r\nuntil the middle of the nineteenth century the Château du Coq, inhabited\r\nby Louis XV in his childhood, and surrounded later by a horticulturist’s\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nAvenue de Versailles, in the south of the arrondissement, shows us along\r\nits line, and in the short streets leading out of it, many old-time\r\nvestiges. The Auteuil cemetery in Rue Chardon-Lagache dates from 1800.\r\nThe house of retreat, Ste-Perine, transferred here from Chaillot in\r\n1850, is on land once part of the estate of the abbots of the old\r\nmonastery Ste-Geneviève, away on the high ground across the Seine at the\r\nother end of the city. Rue Molitor has at No. 18 a group of modern\r\nhouses named Villa Boileau, property once owned by the poet. Boileau’s\r\nAuteuil house was on the site of No. 26, in the quaint picturesque old\r\nRue Boileau, where his gardener’s cottage still stands. Rue de Musset,\r\nopening out of the street at No. 67, reminds us that the friend of\r\nGeorge Sand dwelt here with his parents in the early years of the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV\r\n\r\nLES TERNES\r\n\r\n\r\nARRONDISSEMENT XVII. (BATIGNOLLES-MONCEAU)\r\n\r\nA number of small dwellings lying without the city bounds to the north,\r\nin the commune of Clichy, were known in the fifteenth century as “les\r\nBatignolles,” i.e. the little buildings. Separated from Clichy in the\r\nnineteenth century, the district of les Batignolles was joined to\r\nMonceau. New streets were built, old erections swept away: Avenue de\r\nClichy, in part the Grande Rue of the district, was first planted with\r\ntrees in 1705. At intervals along its course, and in the short streets\r\nconnected with it, we find eighteenth-century houses, none of special\r\ninterest. At No. 3, the Taverne de Paris is decorated with paintings by\r\nmodern artists. A famous restaurant, dating from 1793, stood till 1906\r\nat No. 7. At No. 52 of Rue Balagny, opening out of the Avenue, we see\r\nthe sign “Aux travailleurs,” and on the façade, words to the effect that\r\nthe house was built during the war years 1870-71. At No. 154 of the\r\nAvenue, we find the quiet leafy Cité des Fleurs. Rue des Dames was a\r\nroad leading to the abbey “des dames de Montmartre” in the seventeenth\r\ncentury. Rue de Lévis was in long-gone ages a road leading to what was\r\nthen the village of Monceaux, its name derived perhaps from the Latin\r\n_Muxcellum_, a mossy place, more probably from _Monticellum_, a mound,\r\nor from Mons calvas, the bald or bare mount. The Château de Monceaux was\r\non the site of Place Lévis. The official palace of the Papal Nuncio was\r\nin Rue Legendre, No. 11 bis. The modern church St-Charles we see here,\r\nbuilt in 1907, was previously a Barnabite chapel. Rue Léon-Cosnard dates\r\nfrom the seventeenth century, when it was Rue du Bac d’Asnières. In the\r\nold Rue des Moines we find one of the few French protestant churches of\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nAvenue de Villiers, leading of old to the village of Villiers, now\r\nincorporated with Levallois-Perret, was, from its formation in 1858 to\r\nthe year 1873, Avenue de Neuilly. Puvis de Chavannes died at No. 89, in\r\n1898. Avenue de Wagram in its course from the Arc de Triomphe to Place\r\ndes Ternes dates from the Revolution year 1789, known then as Avenue de\r\nl’Étoile. Avenue MacMahon began as Avenue du Prince Jerôme. Avenue des\r\nTernes is the ancient route de St-Germain, subsequently known as the old\r\nReuilly Road--Reuilly is half-way to St-Germain--later as Rue de la\r\nMontagne du Bon-Air, to become on the eve of its début as an Avenue,\r\nroute des Ternes, the chief road of the _terra externa_, the territory\r\nbeyond the city bounds on that side. The village Les Ternes was taken\r\nwithin the Paris boundary line in 1860. The barrière du Roule was\r\nsurrounded in the past by a circular road, now Place des Ternes. We find\r\nimportant vestiges of the fine Château des Ternes in the neighbourhood\r\nof Rue Bayen, Rue Guersant and Rue Demours. The church St-Ferdinand\r\nbuilt in 1844-47 was named in memory of the duc d’Orléans, killed near\r\nthe spot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI\r\n\r\nON THE _BUTTE_\r\n\r\n\r\nARRONDISSEMENT XVIII. (BUTTE MONTMARTRE)\r\n\r\nWe are on supremely interesting ground here, ground at once sacred,\r\nhistoric and characteristic of the mundane life of the city above which\r\nit stands. At or near its summit, St-Denis and his two companions were\r\nput to death in the early days of Christianity. On the hill-side most\r\nmemorable happenings have been lived through. In the old streets and\r\nhouses up and down its slopes poets and artists have ever dwelt, worked\r\nand played, and in its theatres, its music-halls, cabarets, etc.,\r\nParisians of all classes have sought amusement--good and evil. In past\r\ndays Paris depended on Montmartre for its daily bread, for the flour\r\nthat made it was ground by the innumerable windmills of the _Butte_. The\r\nsails of many of those windmills worked far into the reign of Napoléon\r\nIII, who did not admire their aspect and even had a scheme for levelling\r\nthe _Butte_! So it is said. Reaching the arrondissement by the Rue des\r\nMartyrs, which begins, as we know, in arrondissement IX, we come upon\r\ntwo buildings side by side of very opposite uses: the Comédie Mondaine,\r\nformerly the famous Brasserie des Martyrs and Divan Japonais, and the\r\nAsile Nationale de la Providence, an institution founded in 1804 as a\r\nretreat for aged and fallen gentlepeople.\r\n\r\nThe _hôtel_ at No. 79 is on the site of the Château d’hiver, where the\r\nRevolutionists of Montmartre had their club. No. 88 was the\r\ndancing-saloon known as the Bossu. No. 76 that of the Marronniers. Rue\r\nAntoinette shows us points of interest of another nature. At No. 9, in\r\nthe couvent des Dames Auxiliatrices du Purgatoire, we see the very spot\r\non which there is reason to believe St. Denis and his companions\r\nsuffered martyrdom. An ancient crypt is there, unearthed in the year\r\n1611, to which we are led down rough steps, beneath a chapel built on\r\nthe site in 1887; we see a rude altar and above it words in Latin to the\r\neffect that St-Denis had invoked the name of the Holy Trinity on that\r\nspot. The crypt is no doubt a vestige of the chapel built on the site by\r\nSte-Geneviève. It was in this chapel, not as is sometimes asserted\r\nhigher up the _Butte_, that Ignatius Loyola and his six companions, on\r\nAugust 15, 1574, made the solemn vow which resulted in the institution\r\nof the Order of the Jesuits. The chapel was under the jurisdiction of\r\nthe “Dames de Montmartre,” and after the great fire at the abbey the\r\nnuns sought refuge in the old chapel here, made it a priory. Several\r\npersons of note were buried there. At the Revolution it was knocked to\r\npieces and remained a ruin until rebuilt by the abbé Rebours in 1887.\r\n\r\nLeaving this interesting spot and passing through Rue Tardieu, we reach\r\nPlace St-Pierre, formerly known as Place Piemontési, and go on through\r\nRue Foyatier to the ancient Rue St-Eleuthère, once in part of its length\r\nRue du Pressoire, a name recalling the abbey winepress on the site of\r\nthe reservoir we see there now. Thus we come to Rue Mont-Cenis, the\r\nancient Chaussée St-Denis, and in part of its course, Rue de la\r\nProcession, referring to the religious processions of those bygone days.\r\nAnd here we see before us the most ancient of Paris churches, St-Pierre\r\nde Montmartre. It dates from the first years of the ninth century, built\r\non the site of an earlier chapel or several successive chapels, the\r\nfirst one erected over the ruins of a pagan temple. Four black marble\r\npillars from the ruins of that temple were used for the Christian\r\nchurch: we see them there to-day, two at the west door, two in the\r\nchancel. We see there, too, ancient tombstones, one that of Adelaide de\r\nSavoie, foundress of the abbey, for the Choir des Dames was the abbey\r\nchapel, and there the abbesses were buried. The old church was\r\nthreatened with destruction after the desecration of 1871, when it was\r\nused as a munition _dépôt_. Happily it has been saved and in recent\r\nyears restored. The façade is eighteenth-century work, quite\r\nuninteresting as we see, but the view of the east end from without, the\r\napse, the old tower and the simply severe Gothic interior, are\r\nstrikingly characteristic. The cross we see in front of the church was\r\nbrought here from an old cemetery near. The garden adjoining, with the\r\nCalvaire set up there in 1833, was in ancient days the nun’s graveyard.\r\nThe cemetery on the northern side dates from the time of the Merovingian\r\nkings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST-PIERRE DE MONTMARTRE]\r\n\r\nLeaving the most ancient of Paris churches we come to the most\r\nremarkable among the modern churches of Paris and of France--l’Église du\r\nVœu National, commonly known as the Sacré-Cœur. It is an\r\nimpressively historic structure for it was built after the disasters of\r\n1870-71, by “La France humiliée et repentante,” a votive church erected\r\nby national subscription. To make its foundations sure on the summit of\r\nthe _Butte_, chosen as being the site of the martyrdom of St-Denis,\r\npatron saint of the city, the hill was probed to its base, almost to the\r\nlevel of the Seine, and a gigantic foundation of hard rock-like stone\r\nbuilt upwards. The huge edifice rests upon a vast crypt, with chapels\r\nand passages throughout its entire extent. It has taken more than forty\r\nyears to build; the north tower was finished just before the outbreak of\r\nthe war, now advancing to a triumphal end, for which grand services of\r\nthanksgiving will ere long be held in this church built after defeat.\r\nThe interior is still uncompleted. Looking at it from close at hand, the\r\nimmense Byzantine structure with its numerous domes, seems to us\r\næsthetically somewhat unsatisfying, but from a distance dominating\r\nParis, seen as it often is through a feathery haze, or with the sun\r\nshining on it, the vast white edifice makes an imposing effect. Its\r\ngreat bell, la Savoyarde, given by the diocese of Chambéry, weighs more\r\nthan 26,000 kilogrammes, and its sound reaches many miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEUX MONTMARTRE, RUE ST-VINCENT\r\n\r\n(Maison de Henri IV)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUE MONT-CENIS\r\n\r\n(Chapelle de la Trinité)]\r\n\r\nRue Chevalier de la Barre, bordering the church on the north, was\r\nformerly in part of its length Rue des Rosiers, in part Rue de la\r\nFontenelle, referring to a spring in the vicinity. In a wall of the Abri\r\nSt-Joseph at No. 26, we see the bullet-holes made by the Communards who\r\nshot there two French Generals in March, 1871. Going up Rue Mont-Cenis\r\nwe see interesting old houses at every step. No. 22 was the home of the\r\nmusician Berlioz and his English wife Constance Smithson. Crossing this\r\nlong street from east to west at this point, the winding hill-side Rue\r\nSt-Vincent with its ancient walls, its trees, its grassy roadway,\r\nmakes us feel very far removed from the city lying in the plain below.\r\nAt No. 40 is the little cemetery St-Vincent. Returning to Rue Mont-Cenis\r\nwe find at No. 53 a girls’ college amid vestiges of the ancient, famous\r\n_porcelaine_ factory, the factory of “Monsieur” under the patronage of\r\nthe comte de Provence, brother of Louis XV. The tower we see there was\r\nthat of the windmill which ground the silex. At No. 61 we come upon a\r\nfarm dating from 1782, la Vacherie de la Tourelle. At No. 67 an old inn\r\nonce the Chapelle de la Trinité (sixteenth century).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEUX MONTMARTRE\r\n\r\n(Cabaret du Lapin-Agile)]\r\n\r\nReturning to the vicinity of St-Pierre and the Sacré-Cœur, we find\r\nnumerous short streets, generally narrow and tortuous, which retain\r\ntheir old-world aspect. Rue St-Eleuthère is one of the most ancient. Rue\r\nSt-Rustique formerly Rue des Dames, Rue Ravignan once Rue du\r\nVieux-Chemin, Rue Cortot, Rue Norvins, Rue des Saules, are all\r\nseventeenth-century thoroughfares. Rue Norvins was Rue des Moulins in\r\nbygone days. No. 23 was a far-famed _folie_, then, in 1820, the\r\ncelebrated Dr. Blanche founded there his first asylum for the insane,\r\nmany of whom he cured. At No. 9 we come to an old house and alley, the\r\n_impasse_ Trainée, a name recalling the days when Montmartre was, in\r\nwintry weather, a wolf-haunted district: a _trainée_ is a wolf-trap. The\r\ninn at No. 6 was in the past a resort of singers in search of an\r\nengagement: the impecunious could bring food to eat there. On the Place\r\ndu Tertre two trees of liberty were planted in 1848, felled in 1871. No.\r\n3 is the site of the first Mairie of Montmartre. Passing along Rue du\r\nCalvaire we come to the rustic Place du Calvaire, erewhile Place\r\nSte-Marie.\r\n\r\nA very chief interest at Montmartre is the view. It is best obtained\r\nfrom the Belvedere built by baron de Vaux at No. 39 Rue Gabrielle, and\r\nfrom the Moulin de la Galette reached through Rue des Trois-Frères. Rue\r\nde la Mire was in olden days Petite Rue des Moulins. The steps we see\r\nare said to have been put there for the passage of cattle.\r\n\r\nThe cellars of the house at No. 7, Rue la Vieuville are vestiges of the\r\nancient abbey. Place des Abbesses was erewhile Rue de l’Abbaye. On the\r\nancient _place_ we find the most modern and most modern-style church in\r\nParis, St-Jean l’Evangeliste, built of concrete. The Passage des\r\nAbbesses leads by an old flight of steps to Rue des Trois-Frères, a\r\nmodern street. Rue Lepic, for some years after its formation Rue de\r\nl’Empereur (Napoléon III), was renamed in memory of the General who\r\ndefended the district in 1814. Numerous old streets are connected with\r\nit. Avenue des Tilleuls recalls the days when lime-trees flourished\r\nthere, the lime-trees memorized in Alphonse Karr’s novel _Sous les\r\nTilleuls_. In the Square where it ends is an eighteenth-century house\r\nwhere François Coppée dwelt as a boy. The severely wall-enclosed _hôtel_\r\nat No. 72 was the home of the artist Ziem. Close here is the entrance to\r\nthe Moulin de la Galette. At the top of the house No. 100 there is an\r\nastronomical observatory set up under Napoléon III. The Rue Girardon, a\r\nrural pathway in the seventeenth century, was known later as Rue des\r\nBrouillards, the point no doubt from which the city lying below was to\r\nbe seen fog-enveloped, as is not unfrequently the case. The old house\r\nNo. 13 goes by the name le Château des Brouillards. In the _impasse_ at\r\nNo. 5 stood in ancient days the Fontaine St-Denis. Its waters were of\r\ngreat repute, assuring, it was said, in women who drank them, the virtue\r\nof conjugal fidelity. And here through the short street Rue des\r\nDeux-Frères we reach the historic Moulin de la Galette. It dates from\r\nthe twelfth century and has seen tragic days. Its owners defended it\r\nwith frantic courage in 1814, whereupon one of them, taken by the\r\nattacking Cosaques, was roped to the whirling wheel. It was again\r\nassailed in 1871. The property was owned by the same family from the\r\nyear 1640, a private property, a farm, a country inn, where dancing\r\noften went on as a mere private pastime till, in 1833, its landlord, an\r\nexpert in the art of dancing, decided to turn his talent to pecuniary\r\naccount and opened there the famous public dancing-hall. Rue\r\nCaulaincourt, erewhile quaint and rural, has lost of late years almost\r\nall its old-time characteristics. Rue Lamarck has become quite modern in\r\nits aspect. Rue Marcadet was known in the seventeenth century as Rue\r\ndes Bœufs--Ox Street. At No. 71 we find a fine seventeenth-century\r\n_hôtel_, now a girls’ school, hôtel Labat, and another good old house,\r\nalso a girls’ school, at No. 75; at No. 91 yet another. The modern\r\nstructures at No. 101 are on the site of the ancient manor-house of\r\nClignancourt. The turret at No. 103 is probably the relic of an old\r\nwindmill. Rue de la Fontaine du But records the name of a drinking\r\nfountain, demolished some forty years ago, said to have been set up\r\nthere by the Romans. Tradition has it the word _but_ was once _buc_, and\r\nreferred to the Roman rite of the sacrifice of a buck to Mercury.\r\nAccording to another legend, “_but_,” i.e. aim, referred to the English\r\narchers who when in France made that spot their practising-ground. Rue\r\ndu Ruisseau owes its name to the stream of water which flowed through it\r\non the demolition of the ancient fountain. The seventeenth-century Rue\r\nde Maistre, bordering the northern cemetery, is the ancient Chemin des\r\nDames. Rue Eugène-Carrière, opening out of it, was till quite recently\r\nRue des Grandes Carrières, memorizing the big quarries whence from time\r\nimmemorial has been obtained the white stone, so marked a feature of\r\nParis buildings, and the world-famed plaster of Paris.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOULIN DE LA GALETTE]\r\n\r\nRue Damrémont is modern; in the little Rue des Cloys opening out of it\r\nat No. 102 we see vestiges of a curious old _cité_ of wooden dwellings.\r\nRue Neuve de la Chardonnière recalls the days when it was a\r\nthistle-grown road. Rue du Poteau reminds us of the gallows of the\r\nSt-Ouen road. The Avenue de Clichy and the Avenue St-Ouen which form the\r\nboundary of the arrondissement, both date back as important roads to the\r\nseventeenth century. Along them we find here and there traces of ancient\r\nbuildings, none of special interest. To the east of the boulevards\r\nOrnano and Barbes, which run through the arrondissement from north to\r\nsouth, we find numerous ancient streets, mostly short. The street of\r\nchief importance is Rue des Poissonniers, its lower end merged in\r\nboulevard Barbes. We see several unimportant old houses along its\r\ncourse. The impasse du Cimetière and the schools we see there are on\r\nthe site of an old graveyard. In Rue Affre, bearing the name of the\r\narchbishop of Paris slain on the barricades in 1848 (_see_ p. 250), we\r\nfind the modern church St-Bernard, of pure fifteenth-century Gothic as\r\nto style, but far inferior in workmanship to the Gothic structures of\r\nages past. Rue de la Chapelle, known in Napoléon’s time as Faubourg de\r\nla Gloire, began as the Calais Road, then became the Grande Rue de la\r\nChapelle. La Chapelle is a spot of remarkable historic memories. It\r\nbegan as the Village des Roses--in days when roses, wild and cultivated,\r\ngrew in abundance in what is now a Paris slum. Then the population,\r\nremembering that Ste-Geneviève had stopped to rest and pray in the\r\nchurch on her way to St-Denis, called their village La Chapelle-Ste-Geneviève.\r\nLater it was named la Chapelle-St-Denis. To the church at la Chapelle\r\nwent Jeanne d’Arc in the fateful year 1425. We find ancient houses all\r\nalong the course of this old thoroughfare, and at No. 96 the church\r\ndedicated to St-Denis, built by Maurice de Sully, the chancel of that\r\nthirteenth-century structure still intact, after going through two\r\ndisastrous fires and suffering damage in times of war. It has been\r\nenlarged in recent years. The statue of Jeanne d’Arc there dates from\r\nthe reign of Louis XVI.\r\n\r\nA popular fair, la Foire de Lendit, instituted by Dagobert, was held\r\nduring centuries at the extreme end of the ancient thoroughfare. No.\r\n122, built, tradition tells us, by Henri IV and given to his minister\r\nSully, became in the seventeenth century the Cabaret de la Rose Blanche.\r\nAt No. 1 Rue Boucry we see an ancient chapel now used as a public hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII\r\n\r\nAMONG THE COALYARDS AND THE MEAT-MARKETS\r\n\r\n\r\nARRONDISSEMENT XIX. (BUTTES-CHAUMONT)\r\n\r\nIn this essentially workaday district we see many houses old and quaint,\r\nbut without architectural beauty or special historic interest. Round the\r\npark des Buttes-Chaumont, a large expanse of greenswards and shady\r\nalleys, dull, squalid streets branch out amid coal-yards and factories.\r\nBeneath the park are the ancient quarries which erewhile gave so much\r\nwhite stone and plaster of Paris to the city builders. The name Chaumont\r\nis derived, perhaps, from _mons calvus_, _mont chauve_, i.e. bald\r\nmountain. In Rue de Flandres, formerly Grande Rue de la Villette, we see\r\na Jewish cemetery. Nos. 61 to 65 are on the site where the well-known\r\ninstitution Ste-Perine, come hither from Compiègne, was first\r\nestablished in Paris as a convent community in the seventeenth century,\r\nremoved to Chaillot in 1742, then to Auteuil, its present site. We find\r\nancient houses, some old signs, along the course of this old street, and\r\nat No. 152 an interesting door, pavilion and bas-relief.\r\n\r\nRue de Belleville marks the bounds of the arrondissement. Along its\r\ncourse and in the adjacent streets we see many vestiges of the past. Rue\r\ndes Bois shows us some fine old gardens as yet undisturbed. In Rue de\r\nl’Orme, Elm Road, opening out of it, we find the remains of an ancient\r\npark. Rue Pré-St-Gervais was a country road till 1837. From the top of\r\nthe steps in the picturesque Rue des Lilas we have a fine view across\r\nthe neighbouring _banlieue_. In the grounds of No. 40 we come upon three\r\nbenches formed of gravestones. Rue Compans was in the eighteenth century\r\nand onwards Rue St-Denis. The church of St-Jean-Baptiste, quite modern,\r\nis of excellent style and workmanship. The lower end of Rue de\r\nBelleville leads us into arrondissement XX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII\r\n\r\nPÈRE-LACHAISE\r\n\r\n\r\nARRONDISSEMENT XX. (MÉNILMONTANT)\r\n\r\nThe lower end of the long Rue de Belleville, its odd-number side in\r\narrondissement XIX, went in olden days by the name Rue des\r\nCourtilles--Inn Street. Inns, cabarets, popular places of amusement\r\nstood door by door all along its course. Here, as in arrondissement XIX,\r\nwe find on every side old houses and vestiges of the past, but of no\r\nparticular interest beyond the quaintness of their aspect. Rue Pelleport\r\nbegan in the eighteenth century as an avenue encircling the park of\r\nMénilmontant. In the grounds surrounding the reservoirs we come upon a\r\ntomb, a modern gravestone, covering the remains of a municipal\r\nfunctionary whose dying wish was to be buried on his own estate.\r\n\r\nRue Haxo, crossing Rue Belleville at No. 278 and running up into\r\narrondissement XIX, is of tragic memory. Opening out of it at No. 85 we\r\nsee the Villa des Otages. There the Commune sat in 1871, there the fate\r\nof the hostages was decided; there on the 26th May, 1871, fifty-two of\r\nthose unhappy prisoners were slain. The Jesuits owned the property till\r\nits sale a few years ago. They bought and carried away the _grilles_ and\r\nwhatever else was transportable from the cells where the victims had\r\nbeen shut up.\r\n\r\nRue Ménilmontant, running parallel to Rue de Belleville, dates from the\r\nseventeenth century, when it was a country road leading to the\r\nthirteenth-century hamlet Mesnil Mantems, later Mesnil Montant. The land\r\nthere belonged in great part to the abbey St-Antoine and to the priory\r\nof Ste-Croix de la Bretonnerie; a château de Ménilmontant was built,\r\nunder Louis XIV, where in the wide-stretching grounds we see the\r\nreservoirs. At Nos. 155 and 157 we see old pavilions surrounded by\r\ngardens. The eighteenth-century house, No. 145, was in the nineteenth\r\ncentury taken by a society calling itself the St-Simoniens--some forty\r\nmen who had decided to live together and have all things in common. They\r\ndid not remain together long. No. 119 is the school directed by the\r\nSœurs St-Vincent de Paul. At No. 101 we look down Rue des Cascades\r\nwhich till the middle of last century was a country lane: leading out of\r\nit is the old Rue de Savies, recording the ancient name of the\r\ndistrict--Savies, i.e. _montagne sauvage_--wild mountain--a name changed\r\nlater to Portronville (rather a mouthful), then to its euphonious\r\npresent name Belleville. At its summit is an ancient fountain set there\r\nin long-past ages for the use of the monks of St-Martin of Cluny, and\r\nfor the Knights-Templar; another may be seen in the grounds of No. 17.\r\n\r\nOn the Place de Ménilmontant we see the well-built modern church\r\nNotre-Dame-de-la-Croix, on its northern side the old Rue and passage\r\nEupatoria. The quaint Rue de la Mare, a country road in the seventeenth\r\ncentury, and Rue des Couronnes have interesting old passages running\r\ninto them.\r\n\r\nPassing down Rue des Pyrénées, connected on either side with short\r\nold-time streets and passages, we come to the Square Gambetta, often\r\ncalled Square Père-Lachaise, and the immense Paris cemetery, the great\r\npoint of interest of the 20th arrondissement. The site was known in\r\nlong-past days as the Champ de l’Evêque--the bishop’s field. It was\r\npresently put to a very unecclesiastical use, for a rich grocer bought\r\nthe land and built thereon a _folie_, i.e. an extravagant mansion. In\r\nthe seventeenth century the Jesuits bought the property and named it\r\nMont-Louis. Louis XIV paid a visit to the Jesuits there and subsequently\r\nbought the estate and gave it to his confessor, Père Lachaise. When Père\r\nLachaise died the Jesuits regained the property, held it till the\r\nRevolution, when it was seized by the State and became the possession of\r\nthe Municipality. Passing along the avenues and alleys of this vast,\r\nsilent city on the hill-side, we see tombs of every possible description\r\nand style, wonderful monuments and mortuary chapels, some very\r\nbeautiful, others ...! and a huge crematorium. Men and women of many\r\nnations and of many varying creeds are gathered there. Seen on the eve\r\nof All Saints’ Day or the day following, when fresh flowers are on every\r\ngrave, lamps burning in almost every tombstone chapel, the relatives and\r\nthe friends of the dead crowding in reverent attitude along its paths,\r\nthe scene is singularly impressive.\r\n\r\nOn its north-east boundary we find the tragic Mur des Fédérés, the wall\r\nagainst which the insurgents were shot after the Commune in 1871.\r\nBlood-red scarves, blood-red wreaths mark the graves there, and we see\r\nthe names of many who had no graves on that spot chalked up against that\r\ntragic wall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LE MUR DES FÉDÉRÉS]\r\n\r\nOn the south side of the cemetery, running eastward, we turn into the\r\nold Rue de Bagnolet, the road leading to the village of the name. Old\r\nhouses line this street and the streets adjoining it, and half-way up\r\nits incline on the little Place St-Blaise we see the ancient church\r\nSt-Germain de Charonne, dating from the eleventh century. An inscription\r\non a wall within tells us Germain, the busy bishop of Auxerre, first met\r\nGeneviève of Nanterre here, and tradition says the future patron saint\r\nof Paris took her vows on the spot. There was an oratory on the site in\r\nthe fifth century or little later. The eleventh-century edifice was\r\nrebuilt in the fifteenth century, but we still see some of the blackened\r\nwalls of the earlier structure. The _chevet_, i.e. the chancel-end, was\r\ndestroyed in the wars of the Fronde. We see, distinctly traced, the\r\nspace it occupied bounded by the Mur des Sœurs, against which in\r\nlong-gone days were no doubt stalls for the nuns of a neighbouring\r\nconvent. Some ancient tombstones, too, are there, once within the\r\nchancel. Mounting the broad steps we enter the old church to find\r\ncurious old pillars, ancient inscriptions, coats of arms, and in one\r\nchapel a little good old glass.\r\n\r\nMaking our way to the little cemetery of Charonne behind, we find in its\r\ncentre a grass-grown space once the _fosse commune_ of the pits into\r\nwhich the _guillotinés_ were flung in Revolution days. Beyond, near the\r\nboundary wall, we see a railed-in tomb, surmounted by the figure of a\r\nman in Louis XVIII costume--Bègue, Robespierre’s private secretary. The\r\nRevolution over, his chief dead, the man whose hand had prepared for\r\nsignature so many tragic documents withdrew to the rural district of\r\nCharonne, beyond the Paris bounds, led a secluded, peaceful life,\r\ncultivated his bit of land and set about preparing for his exit from\r\nthis earth by designing his own tomb. He sat for the bronze statue we\r\nsee here, and had the iron railing made to show all the implements of\r\nRevolutionary torture with which he was familiar, the wheel that worked\r\nthe guillotine, the _tenailles_, etc....!\r\n\r\nHigher up towards Bagnolet we come to a vestige of the ancient Château,\r\na pavilion Louis XV, forming part of the modern Hospice Debrousse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX\r\n\r\nBOULEVARDS--QUAYS--BRIDGES\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOULEVARDS\r\n\r\nThe Paris boulevards are one of the most characteristic features of the\r\ncity. The word _boulevard_ recalls the days when Paris was fortified,\r\nsurrounded by ramparts, and the city boulevards stretch for the most\r\npart along the lines of ancient boundary walls, boundaries then, now\r\nlines in many instances cutting through the very heart of the Paris we\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nThe Grands Boulevards run from the Place de la Madeleine to the Place de\r\nla Bastille--gay and smart and modern, in the first kilometres of their\r\ncourse; less smart, busier, more commercial, with more abundant vestiges\r\nof bygone days as they stretch out beyond the boulevard des Italiens.\r\n\r\nThe boulevard de la Madeleine follows the line of the ancient boundary\r\nwall of Louis XIII, razed during the first years of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. Its upper part on the even-number side was one side of an old\r\nthoroughfare reaching as far as Rue de la Chaussée d’Antin, known in its\r\nearly years as Rue Basse du Rempart. The latter part stretching to Rue\r\nCaumartin is of recent date. The old Rue Basse des Remparts was bordered\r\nby handsome _hôtels_, the dwellings of notable persons of the day:\r\nvestiges of several of them were until recent years still seen in\r\nboulevard des Capucines--Nos. 16 to 22 razed when the new street Rue\r\nÉdouard VII was cut. In the reception-room of a seventeenth-century\r\nhouse that stood at the corner of the boulevard and the Rue des\r\nCapucines known as the Colonnade, Buonaparte first met Joséphine.\r\n\r\nBoulevard des Italiens gained its name from the Italian theatre there in\r\n1783. This name was changed more than once in subsequent years. After\r\nthe Revolution, when the Royalists who had taken refuge beyond the\r\nGerman Rhine returned to Paris and held meetings on this boulevard, it\r\nwas nicknamed “Le Petit Coblentz.” No. 33 (eighteenth century) is the\r\nPavillon de Hanovre, forming part in past times of the hôtel d’Antin,\r\nwhich had been owned in its later days by Richelieu, then was divided\r\ninto several dwellings, and in the time of the Merveilleuses one of\r\nthese sub-divisions of the fine old mansion became a dancing saloon,\r\n_bal_ Richelieu, and the meeting-place of the Incroyables. Rue du\r\nHelder, which we see opening at No. 36, was in those days a cul-de-sac,\r\ni.e. a blind alley. The bank there (No. 7) was erewhile the famous\r\ncabaret “le Lion d’Or,” and at No. 2 Cavaignac was arrested when\r\nNapoléon made his _coup d’état_. No. 22 of the boulevard was the\r\nfar-famed “Tortoni.” No. 20, rebuilt in 1839, now a post office, is the\r\nancient hôtel Stainville, later Maison Dorée. No. 16, till a year or two\r\nago Café Riche, dating from 1791. No. 15, hôtel de Lévis, was once the\r\nJockey Club. On the site of No. 13 stood till recent years the famous\r\nCafé Anglais. At No. 11 was the club “Salon des Italiens” in the time of\r\nLouis XVI, subsequently the restaurant Nicolle and Café du Grand Balcon,\r\nits first story commonly known as Salon des Princes. At No. 9 Grétry\r\nlived from 1795 till his death, which happened at Montmorency in 1813.\r\nNo. 1 Café Cardinal founded by Dangest (eighteenth century).\r\n\r\nBoulevard Montmartre dates from the seventeenth century, lined in olden\r\ndays on both sides by handsome private mansions; we see it now a\r\nthoroughly commercial thoroughfare, one of the busiest in the city. A\r\nmodern journalist called its _carrefour_--the point where it meets the\r\nRue du Faubourg Montmartre--“_carrefour des écrasés_.” From the house,\r\nnow a newspaper office, at No. 22 an underground passage ran in past\r\ndays to the Café Cardinal opposite, leading to an orangery. On the site\r\nof No. 23 stood the gambling-house Frascati, built on the site of the\r\nold hôtel Taillepied. The Café Véron at No. 13 dates from 1818, opened\r\nthrough the gardens of the hôtel Montmorency-Luxembourg. Passage\r\nJouffroy at No. 10 was cut, in 1846, across the site of an ancient\r\nbuilding known as the Maison des Grands Artistes. The théâtre des\r\nVariétés, at No. 7, first set up at the Palais-Royal in 1770 by “la\r\nMontansier,” was built here in 1807 on the grounds of the hôtel\r\nMontmorency-Luxembourg. No. 1 is the site of the Café de la Porte\r\nMontmartre, founded by Louis XV, a meeting-place of Parisians hailing\r\nfrom Orléans, nicknamed Guépins.\r\n\r\nBoulevard Poissonnières (seventeenth century) begins where hung till\r\nrecent years an ancient sign at No. 1--“Aux limites de la Ville de\r\nParis”--recording the inscription once on the old wall there. Most of\r\nthe houses are those originally built along the boulevard, and many old\r\nstreets run into it on either side. At No. 9 we see Rue St-Fiacre,\r\ndating from 1630, when it was Rue du Figuier, a street closed at each\r\nend by gates till about 1800. The restaurant Duval at No. 10 of the\r\nboulevard was an eighteenth-century mansion. No. 14 is known as Maison\r\ndu Pont-de-Fer. No. 19, now l’École Pratique du Commerce, was till a few\r\nyears ago the home of an old lady who, left a widow after one happy year\r\nof married life, shut herself up in the house she owned, refused to let\r\nany of its six large flats, and died there in utter solitude at the age\r\nof ninety. No. 23, designed by Soufflot le Romain in 1775 as a private\r\nmansion, became later the _dépôt_ of the famous Aubusson tapistry.\r\n\r\nBoulevard Bonne-Nouvelle, named from the church Notre-Dame de\r\nBonne-Nouvelle in Rue de la Lune, dates from the seventeenth century\r\n(_see_ p. 59). No. 21 was built after the Revolution with the stones of\r\nthe old demolished church St-Paul (_see_ p. 12). No. 11, in 1793, with\r\nsome of the stones of the Bastille. The theatre, le Gymnase, which we\r\nsee at No. 38, erected in 1820 on the grounds of a mansion, a barracks\r\nand a bit of an old graveyard, was known during some years as the\r\nthéâtre de Madame la duchesse de Berri, who had taken it under her\r\npatronage. Its façade was rebuilt in 1887.\r\n\r\nThe church just off the boulevard was first built in 1624 on the site of\r\nthe old chapel Ste-Barbe, and named by Anne d’Autriche, perhaps in\r\ngratitude for the good news of the prospect of the birth of a son (Louis\r\nXIV) after twenty-three years of childless married life, or, as has been\r\nsaid, on account of a piece of good news communicated to the Queen when\r\npassing by the spot. The edifice was rebuilt in the nineteenth century,\r\nthe tower alone remaining untouched. Within it we find an old painting\r\nof Anne d’Autriche and Henriette of England.\r\n\r\nBoulevard St-Denis (eighteenth century). The fine Porte St-Denis shows\r\nin bas-relief, the victories of Louis XIV in Germany and in Holland. It\r\nhas been restored three times since its first erection in 1673. The\r\nRevolutions of 1830 and 1848 began around this grand old Porte.\r\nPaving-stones were hurled from its summit. At No. 19 we see a statue of\r\nSt-Denis.\r\n\r\nBoulevard St-Martin (seventeenth century). Its course was marked out,\r\nits trees planted a few years earlier than that of boulevard St-Denis.\r\nOn its handsome blackened Porte, built in 1674-75, we read the words: “A\r\nLouis-le-Grand pour avoir pris deux fois Besançon et vaincu les Armées\r\nallemandes, espagnoles et hollandaises.” Like Porte St-Denis, it has\r\nbeen three times restored. The Allies passed beneath it on entering\r\nParis in 1814. The first théâtre de la Porte St-Martin was built in the\r\nshort period of seventy-five days to replace, with the least delay\r\npossible, the Opera-house near the Palais-Royal, burnt down in 1781. It\r\nwas the Opera until 1793. The structure we see was erected in 1873,\r\nafter the disastrous conflagration caused by the Communards two years\r\npreviously. We see theatres and concert-halls along the whole course of\r\nthe boulevard. The Ambigu at No. 2 dating from 1828 was founded sixty\r\nyears earlier as a marionnette show on the site of the present Folies\r\nDramatiques. This part of the boulevard was formerly on a steep incline,\r\nwith steps up to the théâtre Porte St-Martin. Its ground was levelled in\r\n1850. The novelist Paul de Kock lived at No 8. No. 17 was the abode of\r\nthe great painter Meissonnier. The théâtre de la Renaissance is modern\r\n(1872), built on the site of the famous restaurant Deffieux which had\r\nflourished there for 133 years. It was for several years Sarah\r\nBernhardt’s theatre.\r\n\r\nBoulevard du Temple, its trees first planted in the year 1668 when it\r\nwas a road stretching right across the area now known as Place de la\r\nRépublique, was at that particular point a centre of places of amusement\r\nof every description--theatres, music-halls, marionnette-shows. All\r\nwere closed, razed to the ground, to make way for the grand new _place_\r\nlaid out there in 1862. Of the old walls within which Parisians had for\r\nlong years previously found so much distraction and merriment, vestiges\r\nremain only at Nos. 48, 46, 44, 42 of the boulevard. No. 42 is on the\r\nsite of the house where Fieschi’s infernal machine was placed in 1835.\r\nThe restaurant at No. 29 is on the site of the once widely known Café du\r\nJardin Turc. The théâtre Dejazet records the name of the famous\r\n_actrice_. The two short streets, Rue de Crussol and Rue du Grand\r\nPrieuré, were cut across the grounds of the Grand Prieuré de France in\r\nthe latter years of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nBoulevard Filles-du-Calvaire, named from the ancient convent, dates only\r\nfrom 1870. The streets connected with it are older. Rue des\r\nFilles-du-Calvaire was a thoroughfare in the last years of the\r\nseventeenth century, and at No. 13 we find traces of the ancient\r\nconvent. Rue Froissard and Rue des Commines, memorizing the two old\r\nFrench chroniclers, were opened in 1804 right across the site of the\r\nconvent and its grounds. Rue St-Sébastien dates back to the early years\r\nof the seventeenth century, and we see there many interesting old\r\nhouses. No. 19, with its Gothic vaulting, is probably the hôtel\r\nd’Ormesson de Noyseau, a distinguished nobleman, guillotined at the\r\nRevolution. Rue du Pont-aux-Choux, made in the sixteenth century across\r\nmarket gardens, got its name from an old bridge which spanned a drain\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nBoulevard Beaumarchais began in 1670 as boulevard St-Antoine. No. 113, a\r\nsixteenth-century structure, was known till 1850 as the Château. The\r\nwords we see engraved on its walls--“A la Petite Chaise”--refer to a\r\ntragic incident. The head of the princesse de Lamballe, carried by the\r\nRevolutionists on a pike, was plunged into a pail of water set on a low\r\nchair placed up against this wall to clear it of the dribbling blood.\r\nNo. 99, its big doors brought here from the Temple palace, is the hôtel\r\nde Cagliostro, the famous sorcerer.\r\n\r\nRue des Arquebusiers, opening at No. 91, dates from 1720, when it was\r\nRue du Harlay-au-Marais. Santerre lived here for a time. No. 2 stands on\r\nthe site of the house where Beaumarchais died in 1790.\r\n\r\nBoulevard Henri IV is modern (1866), cut across the site of two old\r\nconvents. Rue Castex leads out of it where stood once the convent des\r\nFilles de Ste-Marie; its chapel, now a Protestant church, is entered at\r\nNo. 5. The Caserne des Célestins was built in 1892 on the site of part\r\nof the large and celebrated convent of the Célestins, an Order founded\r\nin 1244 by the priest who became Pope Celestin V. The Carmelites who at\r\nfirst were established here, greatly disturbed by inundations from the\r\nSeine who overflowed her banks in those long-past ages, even as she does\r\nto-day, quitted their quarters on this site. The Célestins who came to\r\nParis in 1352 and took over these abandoned dwellings were protected and\r\nenriched by Charles V, inhabiting the Palais St-Pol close by. The Order\r\nwas suppressed in 1778, before the Revolution suppressed all Orders--for\r\nthe time; and in 1785 the convent here was taken for the first deaf and\r\ndumb institution organized by abbé de l’Épée. The convent chapel with\r\nits numerous royal tombs, the bodies of some royal personages, the\r\nhearts of others, was razed in 1849. Some vestiges of the convent walls\r\nremained standing till 1904. Where the boulevard meets the Quai des\r\nCélestins, we see now a circular group of worn, ivy-grown stones; an\r\ninscription tells us these old stones once formed part of the Tour de la\r\nLiberté of the demolished Bastille. They were unearthed in making the\r\nParis Metropolitan Railway a few years ago. The birds make the remnant\r\nof that old tower of liberty their own to-day and passers-by stop\r\nregularly to feed them.\r\n\r\nCrossing the Seine we come to the boulevard St-Germain, beginning at\r\nboulevard Sully in arrondissement V, stretching right through\r\narrondissement VI and ending at the Quai d’Orsay near the Chambre des\r\nDéputés in arrondissement VII. Though in name so historic and running\r\nacross interesting ground, the boulevard is of modern formation. It has\r\nswept away a whole district of ancient streets. The Nos. 61 to 49 are\r\nancient, all that remains of Rue des Noyers erewhile there. At No. 67\r\nAlfred de Musset was born (1810). The théâtre de Cluny is on the site of\r\npart of the vanished couvent des Mathurins. The firm Hachette stands\r\nwhere was once a Jews’ cemetery. No. 160 was the restaurant now razed\r\nwhere Thackeray, when a young student at the Beaux-Arts, took his meals.\r\nA sign-board he painted long hung there. We see some old houses of the\r\nancient Rue des Boucheries between Nos. 162 and 148. At No. 166 we turn\r\nfor an instant into Rue de l’Échaudé, dating from the fourteenth\r\ncentury, when it was a _chemin_ along the abbey moat, a street of\r\nancient houses. The word _échaudé_, a confectioner’s term used for a\r\ncertain kind of three-cornered cake, signifies in topographical language\r\na triangle formed by the junction of three streets. The pavement-stones\r\nbefore Nos. 137 to 135 cover the site of the ancient abbey prison. Rue\r\ndes Ciseaux bordered in olden days the Collège des Écossais. The statue\r\nof Diderot at No. 170 was set up on his centenary as close as could be\r\nto the house he dwelt in, in Rue de l’Égout. The hôtel Taranne records\r\nthe name of the thirteenth-century street of which some vestiges remain\r\non the odd-number side of the boulevard between No. 175 and Place\r\nSt-Germain-des-Prés, where Saint-Simon lived and wrote. The little\r\ngrassy square round the house at No. 186 was originally a leper’s\r\nburial-ground, then, from 1576 to 1604, a Protestant cemetery. Looking\r\ninto the Rue St-Thomas-d’Aquin, once passage des Jacobins, we see the\r\nchurch which began early in the years of the eighteenth century as a\r\nJacobin convent. At the Revolution it was made into a Temple of Peace!\r\nThe frescoes of the ceiling are by Lemoine.\r\n\r\nThe modern boulevard Raspail opening at No. 103 brought about the\r\ndestruction of several ancient streets; where the boulevard St-Germain\r\nmeets Rue St-Dominique three or four fine old mansions were razed to the\r\nground and that old street, previously extending to Rue des\r\nSaints-Pères, cut short here. A fine eighteenth-century _hôtel_ stood\r\ntill 1861 on the site of the Bureaux du Ministère des Travaux Publics at\r\nNo. 244. The minister’s official residence at No. 246, dating from 1722,\r\nis on the site of one still older, at one time the abode of the dowager\r\nduchess of Orleans. That portion of the Ministère de la Guerre which we\r\nsee along this boulevard is a modern construction. We see modern\r\nstructures also at Nos. 280, 282, 284, all on the site of fine old\r\n_hôtels_ demolished at the making of the boulevard. At some points of\r\nboulevard Raspail, stretching from boulevard St-Germain to beyond the\r\ncemetery Montparnasse, we come upon vestiges of the ancient streets\r\ndemolished to make way for it; here and there an old house, a fine\r\ndoorway, and at No. 112 a lusty tree, its trunk protruding through the\r\ngarden wall, said to be the tree beneath whose shade Victor Hugo sat and\r\npondered or maybe wrote several of his best-known works, while living in\r\nan old house close by.\r\n\r\nStarting now from the Place de la République, we pass up the busy modern\r\nboulevard Magenta without finding any point of special interest. The\r\nCité du Wauxhall at No. 6 was opened in 1840 on the grounds of a more\r\nancient Wauxhall. The big hospital Lariboisière in the adjoining Rue\r\nAmbroise-Parée was built from 1839 to 1848, on the _clos_ St-Lazare and\r\nnamed at first Hôpital Louis-Philippe. Its present name is in memory of\r\nthe countesse la Riboisière, who gave three million francs for the\r\nhospital. The boulevards Barbes and Ornano run on from boulevard Magenta\r\nto the district of Montmartre. They are of nineteenth-century formation\r\nand without historic interest. No. 10, boulevard Barbes, was once the\r\ndancing saloon “du Grand Turc.”\r\n\r\nThe bustling boulevard de Strasbourg which boulevard Magenta crosses, a\r\ncontinuation of the no less bustling boulevard Sébastopol, both great\r\ncommercial thoroughfares, was formed in the middle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury across the lines of many ancient streets and courts. Ancient\r\nstreets ran also where we now have the broad boulevard du Palais on\r\nl’Ile de la Cité, crossing the spot on the erewhile Place du Palais\r\nwhere of yore criminals were set out for public view and marked with a\r\nred-hot iron.\r\n\r\nThe buildings we see there on the odd-number side opposite the Palais de\r\nJustice: the Tribunal du Commerce, the Préfecture de Police, the\r\nFiremen’s barracks, are all of nineteenth-century erection. So we come\r\nto the boulevard St-Michel, the far-famed “Boule-Miche” of the Latin\r\nQuarter, forming the boundary-line between arrondissements V and VI. As\r\na boulevard it is not of ancient date. It began at its northernly end in\r\n1855 as boulevard Sébastopol, Rive Gauche. Soon it was prolonged and\r\nrenamed to memorize the ancient chapel erewhile in one of the streets it\r\nhad swept away. Place St-Michel from which it starts has to-day a modern\r\naspect. Almost all traces of the ancient Place du Pont St-Michel, as it\r\nwas in bygone days, have vanished. The huge fountain we see and cannot\r\nadmire, though perhaps we ought to, replaces the fountain of 1684. The\r\narched entrance to the narrow street Rue de l’Hirondelle, once\r\nIrondelle, as an old inscription tells us, which began in 1179 as Rue de\r\nl’Arondale-en-Laas, and the glimpse at a little distance of the entrance\r\nto ancient streets on the boulevard St-Germain side, give the only\r\nold-world touch to the _place_. The high blackened walls we see in this\r\nRue de l’Hirondelle are the remains of the ancient collège d’Autun\r\nfounded in 1341. At No. 20, on the site of the ancient _hôtel_ of the\r\nbishops of Chartres, is an eighteenth-century _hôtel_. No. 38 of the\r\nboulevard is on the site of the house belonging to the Cordeliers, whose\r\nmonastery was near by, where the royal library was kept from the days of\r\nLouis XIII to 1666. The Lycée St-Louis, founded in 1280 as the college\r\nd’Harcourt, covers the site of several ancient structures. A\r\nfragment--the only one known--of the boundary wall of Henri II, is\r\nwithin the college grounds, and beneath them the remains of a Roman\r\ntheatre were found in 1861, and more remains in 1908. Where the\r\nboulevard meets Rue Monsieur-le-Prince, the city wall and a gate of\r\nPhilippe-Auguste passed in olden days. And that was the site of the\r\nancient _place_. No. 60, the École des Mines founded in 1783, and\r\nhoused at the Mint, at that time an _hôtel_ Rue de l’Université, then\r\ntransferred to Montiers in Savoie, finally settled here in 1815 in the\r\nhôtel Vendôme built in 1707 for the Chartreux, let in 1714 to the\r\nduchesse de Vendôme, who died there soon afterwards. This fine old\r\nstructure still forms the central part of the Mining School. At No. 62\r\nwe see the Geological Map offices. In the court of No. 64 we find a\r\nhouse built by the Chartreux, inhabited in past days by the marquis de\r\nSégur, and in later times by Leconte de Lisle. The railway station Gare\r\nde Sceaux at No. 66 covers the site of the once well-known Café Rouge.\r\nIn the old Rue Royer-Collard opening at No. 71, in the sixteenth century\r\nRue St-Dominique d’Enfer, we see several quaint old houses. Roman pots\r\nwere found some years ago beneath the pavement of the _impasse_. The\r\nhouse at No. 91 is on ground once within the cemetery St-Jacques. César\r\nFranck the composer lived and died at No. 95 (1891). No. 105 is the site\r\nof the ancient Noviciat des Feuillants who went by the name “_anges\r\nguardiens_.” The famous students’ dancing saloon known as bal Bullier\r\nwas at this end of the boulevard from 1848 till a few years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L\r\n\r\nLES BOULEVARDS EXTÉRIEURS\r\n\r\n\r\nStarting at the ancient Barrière des Ternes, for some years past Place\r\ndes Ternes, we take our way through outer boulevards forming a wide\r\ncircle. Boulevard de Courcelles, dating from 1789, runs where quaint old\r\nthoroughfares ran of yore. Boulevard des Batignolles was the site of the\r\nbarrières de Monceau. The Collège Chaptal, which we see there, was\r\nfounded in Rue Blanche in 1844. The busy Place de Clichy is on the site\r\nof the ancient Clichy barrier, valiantly defended by the Garde Nationale\r\nin 1814. The huge monument in its centre is modern (1869). On the line\r\nof the boulevard de Clichy stretched in bygone days the barriers\r\nBlanche, Montmartre and des Martyrs, of which at first three boulevards\r\nwere formed: Clichy, Pigalle, des Martyrs united under the name of the\r\nfirst in 1864. Just beyond the _place_, at No. 112, we turn into Avenue\r\nRachel leading to the cemetery Montmartre, formed in 1804 on the site of\r\nthe ancient graveyard of the district. Many men and women of mark lie\r\nburied here. We see names of historic, literary or artistic celebrity on\r\nthe tombstones all around. The monument Cavaignac is the work of the\r\ngreat sculptor Rude. The Moulin Rouge, a music-hall, at No. 88 is on the\r\nsite of a once famous Montmartrois dancing-hall, “la Dame Blanche.” No.\r\n77 is an ancient convent, its garden the site of a café concert. “Les\r\nQuatrez-Arts” at No. 64 is one of the most widely known of Montmartrois\r\ncabarets and music-halls. In the Villa des Platanes, opening at No. 58,\r\nwe find a bas-relief showing the defence made on the _place_ in 1814.\r\nRue Fontaine, opening at No. 57, shows us a succession of small\r\nMontmartrois theatres and music-halls. In Rue Fromentin we still see the\r\nsign-board of the far-famed school of painting, l’Académie Julian\r\nformerly here. In Rue Germain-Pilon we see an ancient pavilion. No. 36\r\nis the Cabaret La Lune Rousse, formerly Cabaret des Arts, of a certain\r\nrenown or notoriety. The passage and the Rue de l’Élysée-des-Beaux-Arts\r\nshow us interesting sculptures and bas-reliefs. Nos. 8 and 6, of old a\r\ndancing saloon, was the scene of a tragic incident in the year 1830: the\r\nground beneath it, undermined by quarries, gave way and an entire\r\nwedding-party were engulfed. Boulevard de Rochechouart was named in\r\nmemory of a seventeenth-century abbess of Montmartre; it was in part of\r\nits length boulevard des Poissoniers until the second half of the\r\nnineteenth century. The music-hall “la Cigale,” at No. 120, dating from\r\n1822, was for long the famous “bal de la Boule-Noire.” At No. 106 we see\r\na fresco on the bath house walls; an ancient house “Aux-deux-Marronniers”\r\nat No. 38, and theatres, music-halls, etc., of marked local colour all\r\nalong the boulevard.\r\n\r\nBoulevard de la Chapelle runs along the line of the ancient boulevard\r\ndes Vertus. Vestiges dating from the days of the struggles between\r\nArmagnacs and Bourguignons are still seen at No. 120, and at No. 39 of\r\nthe short Rue Château-Landon, opening out of the boulevard at No. 1, we\r\nsee the door of an ancient castel which was for long the country house\r\nof the monks of St-Lazare.\r\n\r\nBoulevard Richard-Lenoir shows us nothing of special interest. The house\r\nNo. 140 is ancient.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD WELL AT SALPÉTRIÈRE\r\n\r\n(Le puits de Manon Lescaut)]\r\n\r\nBoulevard de l’Hôpital dates from 1760. The hospital referred to is the\r\nimmense Salpétrière built as a refuge for beggars by Louis XIV on the\r\nsite where his predecessor had built a powder stores. A bit of the old\r\narsenal still stands and serves as a wash-house. The domed church was\r\nerected a few years later; barrels collected from surrounding farms were\r\nsawed up to make its ceiling. Presently a woman’s prison was built\r\nwithin the grounds--the prison we are shown in the Opera “Manon.” The\r\nconvulsionists of St-Médard were shut up there. At the Revolution it was\r\ninvaded by the insurgents, women of ill-fame set free, many of the\r\nprisoners slain. The new Hôpital de la Pitié was built in adjoining\r\ngrounds in recent years. The central Magasin des Hôpitaux at No. 87,\r\nwhere we see an ancient doorway, is on the site of the hospital\r\nburial-ground of former days.\r\n\r\nThe fine old entrance portal of la Salpétrière, the statue of the famous\r\nDr. Charcot just outside it, the various seventeenth-century buildings,\r\nthe old woodwork within the hospital, the courtyard known as the Cour\r\ndes Massacres, the wide extending grounds, make a visit to this old\r\nhospital very interesting. And the grass-grown open space before it,\r\nwith its shady trees, and the quaint streets around give a somewhat\r\nrural and provincial aspect to this remote corner of Paris, making us\r\nfeel as if we were miles away from the city. Rue de Campo-Formio,\r\nopening at No. 123, was known in the seventeenth century as Rue des\r\nÉtroites Ruelles. Rue Rubens was in past days Rue des Vignes.\r\n\r\nBoulevard Auguste-Blanqui, in the eighteenth century in part of its\r\nlength boulevard des Gobelins, shows us at No. 17 the last\r\nFontaine-Marchande de Paris, now shut down. At No. 50 we see the little\r\nchapel Ste-Rosalie, with inscriptions recording the names of several\r\nvictims of the fire which destroyed the bazar de la Charité in 1897. At\r\nNo. 68 we used to see an eighteenth-century house of rustic aspect and\r\npillared frontal, said to have served as a hunting-lodge for Napoléon\r\nI. Subsequently it was used as the Paris hospital laundry. In more\r\nrecent times the great sculptor Rodin made the old house his studio and,\r\nwhen forced to evacuate, took away the interesting old woodwork and the\r\nstatues of its façade.\r\n\r\nAlong boulevard St-Jacques (seventeenth century) we find several\r\ntumbledown old houses.\r\n\r\nBoulevard Raspail is entirely modern, cut across streets of bygone ages,\r\ntheir houses of historic memory razed to make way for it. The recently\r\nerected No. 117 stands on the site of an old house where Victor Hugo\r\ndwelt and wrote for thirteen years and received the notable men of his\r\nday. Beneath the tree we see in the wall at No. 112 the poet loved to\r\nsit and read. Reaching the top of the boulevard we see the ancient\r\nJesuit chapel, between Rue de Sèvres and Rue du Cherche-Midi.\r\n\r\nBoulevard Edgar-Quinet began as boulevard de Montrouge. Its chief point\r\nof interest is the Montparnasse cemetery dating from 1826, with its\r\nnumerous tombs of notable persons. There we see, too, an ivy-covered\r\ntower dating from the seventeenth century, known as la Tour-du-Moulin,\r\nonce the possession of a community of monks.\r\n\r\nBoulevard de Vaugirard (eighteenth century) included in past days the\r\ncourse of the modernized boulevard Pasteur. We see old houses at\r\nintervals here and in the Rue du Château which led formerly to the\r\nhunting-lodge of the duc de Maine. In Rue Dutot, leading out of\r\nboulevard Pasteur, we come to the great Institut Pasteur, built in 1900,\r\nwith its wonderful laboratories, its perfect organization for its own\r\nspecial, invaluable branches of chemical study. The tomb of its founder\r\nis there, too, in a crypt built by his pupils, his disciples. Behind\r\nthe central building we see a hospital for animals. The Lycée Buffon at\r\nNo. 16 covers the site of the ancient Vaugirard cemetery. Boulevard\r\nGaribaldi began in 1789 as boulevard de Meudon, towards which it ran--at\r\na long distance; then it took the name of Javel, its more immediate\r\nquarter, then of Grenelle through which it stretched. Some of the older\r\nhouses along its course and in adjoining streets, as also along the\r\ncourse and adjoining streets of the present boulevard de Grenelle, its\r\ncontinuation, still stand, none of special interest. A famous barrier\r\nwall was in bygone days along the line where we see the Metropolitian\r\nrailway. Up against its wall, just in front of the station Dupleix, many\r\npolitical prisoners of mark were shot in the years between 1797 and\r\n1815.\r\n\r\nThe boulevards des Invalides, de Montparnasse and de Port-Royal make one\r\nlong line. Boulevard des Invalides has its chief point of interest at\r\nNo. 33, the old hôtel Biron, later the convent of the Sacré-Cœur,\r\nthen Rodin’s studio, and Paris home--now in part the museum he\r\nbequeathed to Paris (_see_ pp. 192, 194).\r\n\r\nBoulevard Montparnasse, formed in 1760, shows us many fine\r\neighteenth-century _hôtels_ and some smaller structures of the same\r\nperiod. On the site of No. 25, the _hôtel_ of the duc de Vendôme,\r\ngrandson of Henri IV, was the home of the children of Louis XIV by\r\nMadame de Montespan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLOÎTRE DE L’ABBAYE DE PORT-ROYAL]\r\n\r\nThe Gare Montparnasse at No. 66 is a modern structure on the site of an\r\nolder railway station. Impasse Robiquet at No. 81 dates from the\r\nfifteenth century. No. 87 is an old hunting-lodge, inhabited in more\r\nmodern days by Pierre Leroux, who was associated with George Sand in\r\nfounding the _Revue Indépendante_. Rue du Montparnasse, opening out of\r\nthe boulevard, is a seventeenth-century street cut across land\r\nbelonging in part to the church St-Laurent de Vaugirard, in part to the\r\nHôtel-Dieu. The church Notre-Dame-des-Champs is modern (1867-75). Rue\r\nStanislas, opening by the church at No. 91, was cut across the grounds\r\nof the hôtel Terray, in the early years of the nineteenth century, where\r\nthe Collège Stanislas, named after Louis XVIII, was first instituted. At\r\nNo. 28 of the Rue Vavin, opening at No. 99, stood, till last year, the\r\nancient Pavillon de l’Horloge, a vestige of the old hôtel Traversière.\r\nThe short Rue de la Grande Chaumière, opened in 1830 as Rue Chamon,\r\nmemorizes by its present name a famous Latin quarter dancing-hall close\r\nby. Here artists’ models gather for hire at midday each Monday. Rue de\r\nChevreuse, opening at No. 125, was a thoroughfare as early as the year\r\n1210, bordering an hôtel de Chevreuse et Rohan-Guéménée. A famous\r\neighteenth-century _porcelaine_ factory stood close here.\r\n\r\nBoulevard de Port-Royal: here at No. 119 we see the abbey built during\r\nthe first half of the seventeenth century. Hither came the good nuns of\r\nPort-Royal-des-Champs in the valley of the Chevreuse, a convent founded\r\nin the early years of the thirteenth century by Mathieu de Montmorency\r\nand his wife Mathilde de Garlande and given to the Order of the\r\nBernardines. In the sixteenth century learned men desiring solitude\r\nfound it in that remote convent. Pascal made frequent sojourns there.\r\nQuarrels between Jesuits and Jansenists brought about the destruction of\r\nthe convent of Port-Royal-des-Champs in 1710. The Paris Port-Royal went\r\non until 1790. Then the abbey became a prison, like so many other\r\nimportant buildings, religious and secular; its name was changed to\r\nPort-Libre, and numerous prisoners of note, Couthon among the rest, were\r\nshut up there. In the year IV of the Convention, it became what it is on\r\na more complete scale to-day, a Maternity Hospital. Women-students sleep\r\nin the ancient nuns’ cells. Most of the old abbey buildings are still\r\nintact. The tombstone of the recluse, Arnauld of Andilly, which we see\r\nin the sacristy, was found beneath the pavement some years ago. The\r\nportal is modern. The _annexe_ of the hospital Cochin at No. 111 is an\r\nancient Capucine convent; its chapel serves as the hospital\r\nlecture-room.\r\n\r\nRue Pierre-Nicole, opening out of the boulevard at No. 90, was cut in\r\nmodern days across the grounds of the ancient Carmelite convent\r\nVal-de-Grâce. In the prolongation of the street we see some remains of\r\nthe convent. Here in ages long gone by was a Roman cemetery, where earth\r\nburial as well as cremation was the rule. At No. 17 _bis_ of this\r\nstreet we see the house once the oratory of Mademoiselle de la Vallière,\r\nwho as Sœur Louise de la Miséricorde passed the last thirty-six years\r\nof her life in _pénitence_ here. The Marine barracks, Caserne Lourcine,\r\nat No. 37 of the boulevard, are on the site of ancient barracks of the\r\nGardes Françaises, and record the former name of the Rue Broca, which we\r\nlook into here, a street of ancient dwellings. The hospital Broca, so\r\nnamed after the famous doctor, was formed of part of the old convent of\r\nthe Cordelières, founded in 1259 by Margaret de Provence, wife of Louis\r\nXI. The convent was pillaged in the sixteenth century by the Béarnais\r\ntroops, sequestrated and sold in Revolution days, to become in 1836\r\nHôpital Lourcine and in 1892 Broca.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REMAINS OF THE CONVENT DES CAPUCINES]\r\n\r\nThe two great latter-day Paris boulevards are boulevard Haussmann and\r\nboulevard Malesherbes. The first, planned and partially built by the\r\nPréfet de la Seine whose name it bears, running through the 8th\r\narrondissement and into the 9th, begun in 1857, is wholly modern save\r\nfor one single house, No. 173, at the juncture of Rue du Faubourg\r\nSt-Honoré, dating from the eighteenth century; boulevard Malesherbes\r\ndates from about the same period. Joining this boulevard at No. 11 is\r\nAvenue Velasquez, where, at No. 7, we find the hôtel Cernuschi\r\nbequeathed by its owner to Paris as an Oriental Museum. The handsome\r\nchurch St-Augustin is of recent erection. Besides these stately\r\nboulevards and some few others devoid of historic interest, there are\r\nboulevards encircling Paris on every side, along the boundary-lines of\r\nthe city, with at intervals the city gates. The boulevards in the\r\nvicinity of the Bois de Boulogne are studded with villas and mansions,\r\nmany of them very luxurious. There are modern mansions, modern dwellings\r\nof various categories along the course of all the other boulevards of\r\nthis wide circumference bordering the fortifications, but with few\r\nassociations of the least historic interest, beyond that of their\r\nnomenclature memorizing, in many instances, Napoléon’s greatest\r\ngenerals.\r\n\r\nBoulevard de la Villette is formed of several ancient boulevards, and\r\nthe name records the existence there in past days of the “_petite\r\nville_,” a series of small buildings, dependencies of the leper-house\r\nSt-Lazare, first erected on a site known in the twelfth century as the\r\ndistrict of Rouvray. The black-walled Rotonde we see was the Custom\r\nHouse first built in 1789, burnt down in 1871, and rebuilt on the old\r\nplan. The Meaux barrier was there, bounding the highway to the north, a\r\npoint of great military interest. Louis XVI returned this way to Paris\r\nafter the flight to Varennes. The Imperial Guard passed here in triumph\r\nin 1807, after their successful campaigns in Germany. Louis XVIII came\r\nthrough the barrier gate here in 1814. The inn where the armistice was\r\nsigned in 1814 was on the Rond-Point opposite the barrier. At No. 130 of\r\nthe boulevard we come to Place du Combat, a name referring to no\r\nmilitary struggle, but to bull-fights, perhaps to cock-fights, which\r\ntook place here till into the nineteenth century. Close by is the site\r\nof the great city gallows, the gibet de Maufaucon of bygone days (_see_\r\np. 240). And here in its vicinity, in the little Rue Vicq d’Azir, dating\r\nfrom the early years of last century, died the former Paris public\r\nexecutioner Deibler in 1904.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of Paris, in the boulevard Kellermann, the Porte de\r\nBicêtre recalls the English occupation of long-past ages or may be an\r\nEnglish colonization of later date, for Bicêtre is a corruption of the\r\nname Winchester. These boulevards of the 13th arrondissement are\r\nragman’s quarters, the district of the Paris _chiffonniers_. Here at the\r\npoterne des Peupliers the Bièvre enters Paris to be entirely lost to\r\nview nowadays in its course through the city beneath the pavements.\r\n\r\nThe boulevards in the vicinity of Père Lachaise, Belleville,\r\nMénilmontant, Charonne, date from 1789. The short Rue des Panoyaux,\r\nopening out of the boulevard Ménilmontant is said to owe its name to the\r\ndays when vines grew here, one bearing a seedless grape: “_pas\r\nnoyau_”--no kernel. Mention of the village of Charonne is found in\r\ndocuments dating from the first years of the eleventh century. The\r\nterritory was church land, for the most part, owned by the old abbey\r\nSt-Magliore and the Paris Cathedral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI\r\n\r\nTHE QUAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe quays of the Seine in its course through Paris are picturesque in\r\nthe extreme and show at almost every step points of historic interest.\r\nThat interest is strongest, the aspect of the quays most quaint and\r\nentrancing, where they pass through the heart of the city.\r\n\r\nLet us start from the Point-du-Jour, the “Dawn of Day,” at the point\r\nwhere the boundary-line of Paris touches the _banlieue_ to the\r\nsouth-east. The name refers to a famous duel fought here at the break of\r\nday on a memorable morning in 1743. Taking the Rive Droite, the right\r\nbank, we follow the Quai d’Auteuil which, till the closing years of the\r\nnineteenth century, was a mere roadway along which the river boats were\r\nloaded and unloaded. The fine viaduct across the river was built in\r\n1864-65. It was fiercely bombarded in the war of 1870. On Sundays and\r\nfête-days this quaint quay is gay with holiday-makers who crowd its\r\npopular cafés, drinking-booths and shows.\r\n\r\nQuai de Passy was made in 1842 along that part of the old high road to\r\nVersailles. Some quaint old houses still stand there. At No. 26 we see a\r\npavilion Louis XVI. No 32 is surrounded by a fine park wherein we find\r\nvestiges of the home of the abbé Ragois, Madame de Maintenon’s\r\nconfessor, and ferruginous springs. Rue Berton, leading up from the\r\nQuai, is one of the most picturesque old streets of Paris. At No. 17 we\r\nfind an extensive property and a Louis XV _hôtel_, once the home of\r\nsuccessive families of the _noblesse_ and of the unhappy princesse de\r\nLamballe, now a Maison de Santé--a private asylum. The _borne_ at No. 24\r\nhas been there since 1731, a boundary mark between the manors of Passy\r\nand Auteuil.\r\n\r\nQuai de la Conférence, arrondissement VIII, dates from the latter years\r\nof the eighteenth century, its name referring to the middle of the\r\nprevious century, when Spanish statesmen entered Paris by a great gate\r\nin its vicinity to confer concerning the marriage of Louis XIV and\r\nMarie-Thérèse.\r\n\r\nCours-la-Reine, bordering the Seine along this quay, was first planted\r\nby Marie de’ Medici in 1618, on market-garden ground. It was a favourite\r\nand fashionable promenade in the time of the Fronde; a moat surrounded\r\nit and iron gates closed it in. At No. 16 of Rue Bayard leading out of\r\nit, we see the Maison de François I, its sculptures the work of Jean\r\nGoujon, brought here, bit by bit, in 1826 from the quaint old village of\r\nMoret near Fontainebleau where it was first built. On its frontage we\r\nread an inscription in Latin.\r\n\r\nQuai des Tuileries was formed under Louis XIV along the line of Charles\r\nV’s boundary wall razed in 1670. The walls of the Louvre bordering this\r\nquay, dating originally from the time of Henri IV, who wished to join\r\nthe Louvre to the Tuileries, then without the city bounds, by a gallery,\r\nwere rebuilt by Napoléon III (1863-68). Place du Carrousel behind this\r\nfrontage, so named from a _carrousel_ given there by Louis XIV, in the\r\ngarden known then as the parterre de Mademoiselle, dates from 1662. At\r\nthe Revolution it became for the time the _soi-disant_ Place de la\r\nFraternité. On this fraternal (?) _place_ political prisoners were\r\nbeheaded, while the _conventionels_ looked on from the Tuileries\r\nwindows. And it was the scene of the historic days June 20th and August\r\n10th, 1792, later of the 24th July, 1830.\r\n\r\nL’Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel dates from 1806, set up to commemorate\r\nthe campaign of 1805. The large square, in the centre of which stands\r\nthe colossal statue of Gambetta, known in the time of the Second Empire\r\nas the Cour Napoléon III, was covered in previous days by a number of\r\nshort, narrow streets, interlacing. Several mansions, one or two\r\nchapels, a small burial-ground, and a theatre, were there among these\r\nstreets and on beyond, and the grounds of the great hospital for the\r\nblind, the “Quinze-Vingts,” stretched along the banks of the Seine at\r\nthis point, extending from the hospital, in Rue St-Honoré, its site from\r\nits foundation till its removal to Rue de Charenton in 1779 (_see_ p.\r\n250). Alongside the Quai we see the terrace “Bord de l’Eau,” of the\r\nTuileries gardens. The Orangerie reconstructed in 1853 was in the\r\nseventeenth century a garden wherein was the famous Cabaret Regnard,\r\nforerunner of the modern Casino. From this terrace to the Tuileries\r\nPalace ran the subterranean passage made by Napoléon I for Marie Louise,\r\nand here was the Pont-tournant, built by a monk in 1716, across which\r\nLouis XVI was led back on his return from the flight to Varennes.\r\n\r\nThe Quai de Louvre is a union of several stretches of quay known of old\r\nby different names, the most ancient stretch, that between the Pont-Neuf\r\nand Rue du Louvre, dating from the thirteenth century. In the jardin de\r\nl’Infante, bordering the palace, here the old palace of the time of\r\nCatherine de’ Medici, we see statues of Velasquez, Raffet, Meissonnier,\r\nBoucher. Reaching the houses along the quay we see at No. 10 the\r\nancient Café de Parnasse, now the Bouillon du Pont-Neuf, where Danton\r\nwas wont to pass many hours of the day and ended by wedding Gabrielle\r\nCharpentier, its landlord’s daughter. At No. 8, built by Louis XVI’s\r\ndentist, we see a fine wrought-iron balcony. And now we come to the\r\nancient Quai de la Mégisserie, dating from the time of Charles V, first\r\nas Quai de la Sannierie, “tools for saltmaking” quay, then as Quai de la\r\nFerraille, “iron-instrument” quay. Its present name, too, denotes a\r\nParis industry, the preparation of sheepskins. The cross-roads where it\r\nmeets Quai du Louvre and the Pont-Neuf went in olden days by the name\r\nCarrefour des Trois-Maries, also by that of Place du Four.\r\n\r\nThe “Belle Jardinière” covers the site of the Forum Episcopi, the\r\nepiscopal prison of the Middle Ages, later a royal prison rebuilt in\r\n1656 by de Gondi, the first archbishop of Paris. Its prisoners were for\r\nthe most part actors and actresses. Interesting old streets open on this\r\nancient quay. At No. 12, we turn into Rue Bertin-Poirée, a thoroughfare\r\nin the earlier years of the thirteenth century, where at No. 5 we see a\r\nquaint, time-worn sign of the Tour d’Argent, and several black-walled\r\nhouses. The thirteenth-century Rue Jean-Lantier, memorizing a Parisian\r\nof that long-gone age, lies, in its upper part, across what was the\r\nPlace du Chevalier du Guet, from the _hôtel_ built there for a Knight of\r\nthe Guet (the Watch) of Louis IX’s time. Rue des Lavandières, of the\r\nsame period, recalls the days when lavender growers and lavender dealers\r\nlived and plied their thriving trade here. At No. 13 we see a fine\r\nheraldic shield devoid of signs; at No. 6, old bas-reliefs. Rue des\r\nDeux-Boules dates under other names from the twelfth century. At No. 2\r\nof this quay the great painter David was born in 1748.\r\n\r\nQuai des Gesvres was built by the Marquis de Gesvres in 1641. The\r\nancient arcades upon which it rests, hidden away with their vaulted\r\nroofing, still support this old quay. The shops they once sheltered were\r\nknocked to pieces in 1789. The Café at No. 10, built in 1855, was named\r\n“A la Pompe Notre-Dame,” to record the existence till then on the\r\nbridge, Pont Notre-Dame, of the twin pumps from which the inhabitants of\r\nthe neighbourhood drew their water. Rue de la Tâcherie (_tâche_, task,\r\nwork) was known in thirteenth-century days as Rue de la Juiverie. This\r\nis still the Jews’ quarter of the city.\r\n\r\nQuai de l’Hôtel de Ville was formed in its present aspect in the\r\nnineteenth century, of three ancient thoroughfares along the banks of\r\nthe Seine. Corn and hay were in old days landed here. On the walls of\r\nthe house No. 34 we see the date 1548, and find within an interesting\r\nold staircase. At No. 90 opens the old Rue de Brosse, named in memory of\r\nthe architect of the fine portal of St-Gervais, before us here (_see_ p.\r\n103), and of the Luxembourg palace, close by the ancient _impasse_ at\r\nthe south end of the church; and at the junction of Quai des Célestins,\r\nopens the twelfth-century Rue des Nonnains d’Hyères, where the nuns\r\nd’Yerres had of old a convent. Almost every house is ancient. In the\r\ncourt at No. 21 we see the interesting façade of the hôtel d’Aumont, now\r\nthe Pharmacie Centrale des Hôpitaux.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HÔTEL DE FIEUBET, QUAI DES CÉLESTINS]\r\n\r\nQuai des Célestins, in the district of the vanished convent (_see_ p.\r\n303) has many interesting vestiges of the past. No. 32 is on the site of\r\nthe Tour Barbeau, where the wall of Philippe-Auguste ended, and of the\r\ntennis-court which served at one time as a theatre for Molière and his\r\ncompany (1645). The walls of No. 22 are one side of the fine old hôtel\r\nde Vieuville (_see_ p. 114). At No. 16 we find a curious old court. No.\r\n14, once hôtel Beaumarchais, then petit hôtel Vieuville, at one time\r\nused as a Jewish temple, has a splendid frescoed ceiling. We see remains\r\nof old _hôtels_ at No. 6 and 4. No. 2, l’École Massillon, built as a\r\nprivate mansion, l’hôtel Fieubet, the work of Mansart (seventeenth\r\ncentury), was restored in 1850, enlarged by the Oratoriens in 1877.\r\n\r\nQuai Henri IV stretches along the ancient line of the Île Louviers\r\njoined to the Rive Droite in 1843, the property of different families of\r\nthe _noblesse_ till 1790. At No. 30 the Archives de la Seine.\r\n\r\nQuai de la Rapée, named from the country house of a statesman of the\r\ndays of Louis XV., is bordered along its whole course by old, but\r\ngenerally sordid, structures, in olden days drinking booths. Passage des\r\nMousquetaires at No. 18 records the vicinity of the Caserne des\r\nMousquetaires, now l’Hôpital des Quinze-Vingts.\r\n\r\nQuai de Bercy, records by its name the _bergerie_, in old French\r\n_bercil_, here in long-gone days. Here, too, there was a castle built by\r\nLe Vau and extensive gardens laid out by the great seventeenth-century\r\ngardener Le Nôtre. Their site was given up in the latter half of the\r\nnineteenth century for the Entrepôts de Bercy.\r\n\r\nPicturesque old quays surround the islands on the Seine. Quai de\r\nl’Horloge, overlooked by the venerable clock-tower of the Palais de\r\nJustice (_see_ p. 50), went in past days by the name Quai des Morfondus,\r\nthe quay of people chilled by cold river mists and blasting winds. When\r\nopticians made that river-bank their special quarter, it became Quai des\r\nLunettes. Lesage, author of _Gil Blas_, lived here in 1715, at the\r\nSoleil d’Or. No. 41, where dwelt the engraver Philipon, Mme Roland’s\r\nfather, is known as the house of Madame Roland, for it was the home of\r\nher girlhood. No. 17 dates from Louis XIII.\r\n\r\nQuai des Orfèvres, the goldsmith’s quay, dating from the end of the\r\nsixteenth and first years of the seventeenth centuries, lost its most\r\nancient, most picturesque structures by the enlarging of the Palais de\r\nJustice in recent years. In ancient days a Roman wall passed here. At\r\nNo. 20 of the Rue de Harlay, opening out of it, we see part of an\r\nancient archway. At No. 2 a Louis XIII house. Nos. 52-54 on the _quai_\r\ndate from 1603, the latter once the firm of jewellers implicated in the\r\n_affaire du collier_. At No. 58 lived Strass, the inventor of the\r\nsimili-diamonds.\r\n\r\nQuai de la Cité was built in 1785, on the site of the ancient\r\n_port-aux-œufs_, remains of which were unearthed in making the\r\nmetropolitan railway, a few years ago. Along these banks we see the\r\nParis bird shops; the Marché-aux-Oiseaux is held here. And close by is\r\nthe Marché-aux-Fleurs. Merovingian remains were found beneath the\r\nsurface on this part of the quay in 1906. Thick, strong walls believed\r\nto have been built by Dagobert, inscriptions, capitals, tombstones--the\r\nremains of oldest Paris.\r\n\r\nQuai de l’Archevêché records the existence there of the archbishop’s\r\npalace built in 1697 by Cardinal de Noailles, pillaged and razed to the\r\nground in 1831. The sacristy and presbytery we see there now are modern.\r\nThis is the quay of the Paris Morgue, the Dead-house, brought here in\r\n1864 from the Marché-Neuf, which had been its site since 1804, when it\r\nwas removed from le Grand Châtelet. For years past we have been told it\r\nis “soon” to be again removed, taken to a remoter corner of the city.\r\n\r\nThe Square de l’Archevêché, laid out in 1837, was in olden days a\r\nstretch of waste land known as the “Motte aux Papelards,” the playground\r\nof the Cathedral Staff. Boileau’s Paris home was here in a street long\r\nswept away. His country-house, as we know, was at Auteuil (_see_ p.\r\n275). In 1870 the square was turned for the time into an artillery\r\nground.\r\n\r\nQuai de Bourbon on the Île St. Louis dates from 1614. Every house along\r\nits line is interesting, of seventeenth-century date for the most part.\r\nAt No. 3, we see a shop of the days and style Louis XV. Nos. 13-15,\r\nhôtel de Charron, where in modern times Meissonnier had his studio. We\r\nsee fine doors and doorways, courts, staircases, balustrades, at every\r\nhouse. No. 29 was the home of Roualle de Boisgelon. Philippe de\r\nChampaigne lived for a time at No. 45.\r\n\r\nQuai d’Orléans was named after Gaston, the brother of Louis XIII. No. 18\r\nis the hôtel Roland. No. 6 is a Polish museum and library.\r\n\r\nQuai de Béthune, once Quai du Dauphin, named by the Revolutionists Quai\r\nde la Liberté, shows us seventeenth-century houses along its entire\r\ncourse. No. 32 was the home of the statesman Turgot in his youth--his\r\nfather’s house. Subterranean passages ran to the Seine from No. 30, and\r\nsome other riverine houses. At No. 24, built by Le Vau, we find an\r\ninteresting court, with fountain, etc.\r\n\r\nQuai d’Anjou is another Orleans quay, for Gaston was duc d’Anjou. No. 1\r\nis the splendid hôtel Lambert de Thorigny (_see_ p. 93). No. 5, the\r\n“petit hôtel Poisson de Marigny,” brother of Mme de Pompadour. No. 7,\r\nbegan as part of the hôtel Lambert, and is now headquarters of the\r\nmunicipal bakery directors. Nos. 11, 13, hôtel of Louis Lambert de\r\nThorigny. No. 17, hôtel Lauzun, husband of “La Grande Mademoiselle,” in\r\nlater times the habitation of several distinguished men of letters:\r\nBaudelaire, Théophile Gautier, etc. The society of the “Parisiens de\r\nParis” bought it in 1904, a magnificent mansion, classed as “Monument\r\nhistorique,” under State protection, therefore, in regard to its upkeep.\r\nNos. 23 and 25 are built on staves over four old walls. No. 35 was built\r\nby Louis XIV’s coachman.\r\n\r\n\r\nRIVE GAUCHE (LEFT BANK).\r\n\r\nWe will start again from the south-western corner. Here in 1777, in the\r\nlittle riverside hamlet beyond Paris, a big factory was built, where was\r\nfirst made the disinfectant, of so universal use in France, known as\r\n_eau de Javel_. The Quai de Javel was constructed some fifty years\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nQuai de Grenelle, a rough road from the eighteenth century, was built at\r\nthe same period. The Allée des Cygnes owes its name to the ancient Île\r\ndes Cygnes, known in the sixteenth century and onwards as Île\r\nMaquerelle, or _mal querelle_, for the secluded islet on the Seine,\r\njoined later to the river-bank, offered a fine spot in those days for\r\nfights and quarrels. In the time of Louis XIV the islet was a public\r\npromenade, and the King had swans put there, hence its name.\r\n\r\nQuai d’Orsay memorizing a famous parliamentary man of his day, Prévôt\r\ndes Marchands, first constructed in the early years of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, was known from 1802 to 1815 as Quai Buonaparte. It extends far\r\nalong the 7th arrondissement. There we see along its borders the bright\r\ngardens of the recently laid out park of the Champ de Mars, and numerous\r\nsmart modern streets and avenues opening out of it. No. 105 is the State\r\nGarde-Meuble, its walls sheltering magnificent tapestries, and historic\r\nrelics of the days of kings and emperors. At No. 99 were the imperial\r\nstables. No 97, Ministère du Travail. The Ministère des Affaires\r\nÉtrangères (Foreign Office), at No. 37, is a modern structure. The\r\nPalais de la Présidence, at No. 35, dates from 1722. The Palais-Bourbon\r\nfrom the same date (_see_ p. 200).\r\n\r\nThe busy Gare d’Orléans, so prominent a modern structure along the quay,\r\ncovers the site of the old Palais d’Orsay, and an ancient barracks burnt\r\nto the ground in 1871. In an inner courtyard at No. 1 we find the\r\nremains of the ancient hôtel de Robert de Cotte, royal architect-in-chief,\r\nin the early years of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nQuai Voltaire was known in part of its course in eighteenth-century days\r\nas Quai des Théatins. It was constructed under Mazarin, restored in\r\n1751. Many names of historic note are associated with the handsome house\r\nat No. 27, built in or about 1712, for Nicolas de Bragelonne, Treasurer\r\nof France. Its chief point of interest is connected with Voltaire. Here\r\nhe died in 1778; here his heart was kept till 1791. No. 25 was the home\r\nof Alfred de Musset. The ground between 25 and 15 was occupied from the\r\ndays of Mazarin till 1791 by the convent of the Théatins. The short Rue\r\nde Beaume close here shows us many interesting old-time houses. No. 1\r\nwas the hôtel of the Marquis de Villette, who became a member of the\r\nConvention, and called his son Voltaire. At No. 3 were his stables.\r\nBoissy d’Anglas lived at No. 5, in 1793, and Chateaubriand stayed here\r\nin 1804. No. 17, dating from about 1670, was the house of the Carnot\r\nfamily. At No. 10 we see vestiges of a house belonging to the\r\nMousquetaires Gris, for this was their headquarters. No. 2 was built for\r\nthe Marquis de Mailly-Nesle. Nos. 11 to 9, along the _quai_, formed the\r\nhabitation of Président de Perrault, secretary to the Grand Condé. The\r\nduchess of Portsmouth lived here in 1690, and here the great painter,\r\nIngres, died in 1867.\r\n\r\nQuai Malaquais began as Quai de la Reine Marguerite, but was nicknamed\r\nforthwith Quai Mal-acquet (_Mal-acquis_) because the Queen, Henri IV’s\r\nlight-lived, divorced wife, had taken the abbey grounds of the Petit\r\nPré-aux-Clercs whereon to build her garden-surrounded mansion. At No. 1\r\nthe architect Visconti died in 1818. In 1820 Humboldt lived at No. 3.\r\nThe statue of Voltaire by Caillé was set up opposite No. 5 in 1885. The\r\nhouse at No. 9 was built about 1624 on the ground _mal-acquis_ by\r\nMargaret de Valois. No. 11, École des Beaux-Arts, is on the site of the\r\nancient hôtel de Brienne, Louis XIV’s Secretary of State. Joined later\r\nto the house next door it became the home of Mazarin, by and by of\r\nFouché, and was made to communicate with the police offices at a little\r\ndistance. Nos. 15 and 17, built by Mansart in 1640, restored a century\r\nlater, after long habitation by persons of noted name, was taken over by\r\nthe State, and in 1885 annexed to the Beaux-Arts.\r\n\r\nQuai de Conti records the name of the brother of the Grand Condé. Its\r\nmost prominent building is the Institut de France, the Collège Mazarin,\r\nbuilt in 1663-70, as the Collège des Quatre Nations Réunies. Its left\r\npavilion covers the site of the ancient Tour de Nesle, washed by the\r\nSeine, which formed the boundary point of Philippe-Auguste’s wall and\r\nrampart. Mazarin’s will endowed the college for the benefit of sixty\r\nimpecunious gentlemen’s sons of Alsace, France, Pignerol, Roussillon.\r\nThe Revolutionists styled it “Collège de l’Unité,” then in 1793\r\nsuppressed it, and used the building for meetings of the Salut Public,\r\nlater as an École Normale, then as a Palais des Arts; finally, after\r\nundergoing restoration, it became in 1805 the Institut de France, as we\r\nknow it. The ancient chapel has been taken for the great meeting-hall,\r\nthe hall of the grandes “Séances.” For long Mazarin’s tomb, now in the\r\nLouvre, was there. His body is said to be there still, deep down beneath\r\nthe chapel pavement. The Bibliothèque Mazarine is in the part of the\r\nbuilding covering the spot where the petit hôtel de Nesle stood of old.\r\nThe greater part of the statesman’s valuable collection of books was\r\nbrought here from his palace, now incorporated in the Bibliothèque\r\nNationale, Rue de Richelieu, according to his will. It contains many\r\nprecious ancient volumes and manuscripts. The house No. 15 was built by\r\nLouis XIV on the foundations of the ancient Tour de Nesle. No. 13, where\r\nwe see the shop of the booksellers Pigoreau, was built by Mansard, in\r\n1659, one of its walls resting upon a bit of the ancient wall of\r\nPhilippe-Auguste. Here, on the third story, we may see the room, an\r\nattic then, as now, where young Buonaparte, a student at the École\r\nMilitaire, used to spend his holidays, welcomed there by old friends of\r\nhis family. The short Rue Guénégaud, memorizing the mansion once there,\r\nbordering at one part the walls of the Mint, shows us along the rest of\r\nits course, at No. 1, remains of a once famous marionnettes theatre;\r\nat No. 19 an old gabled house; in the court, No. 29, a tower of\r\nPhilippe-Auguste’s wall; an ancient inscription at No. 35; a fine old\r\ndoor at No. 16, etc. The narrow old-world Rue de Nevers shows us none\r\nbut ancient houses. This thirteenth-century street was formerly closed\r\nat both ends and known therefore as Rue des Deux-Portes. Beneath No. 13\r\nof the little Rue de Nesle runs an ancient subterranean passage blocked\r\nin recent years. The old house at No. 5 of the quay was for long looked\r\nupon as the dwelling of Buonaparte after he left Brienne. At the\r\nrecently razed No. 3 lived Marie-Antoinette’s jeweller, his shop\r\nsurmounted by the sign “Le petit Dunkerque,” referring to articles of\r\ncuriosity in the jewellery line, much in vogue in the year 1780. A\r\nlittle café at No. 1, also razed, was till lately the humble successor\r\nof the first Paris “Café des Anglais,” set up there in 1769, a\r\ngathering-place for British men of letters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUAI DES GRANDS-AUGUSTINS]\r\n\r\nQuai des Grands-Augustins, the oldest of Paris quays, dates in part from\r\nthe thirteenth century, and records the existence there of the monastery\r\nwhere in its heyday the great assemblies of the clergy were held, and\r\nthe ecclesiastical archives kept from 1645 to 1792. The Salle des\r\nArchives was then given up to the making of _assignats_. In 1797 the\r\nconvent was sold and razed to the ground. We see some traces of it at\r\nNo. 55. The bookseller’s shop there was till recent years paved with\r\ngravestones from the convent chapel which stood on the site of No. 53.\r\nThe restaurant Lapérouse at No. 51 was, in the seventeenth century, the\r\nhôtel of the comte de Bruillevert. The Académie bookseller,\r\nDidier-Perrin, is established in the ancient hôtel Feydeau et Montholon.\r\nNo. 25 was built by François I. No. 23 opened on the vanished Rue de\r\nHurepoix. No. 17 was part of the hôtel d’O, subsequently hôtel de\r\nLuynes.\r\n\r\nQuai St-Michel was known for a time in Napoléon’s day as Quai de la\r\nGloriette. Its first stone was laid so far back as 1561, then no more\r\nstones added till 1767, an interim of two centuries. Another\r\ninterruption deferred its completion to the year 1811. The two narrow\r\nsordid streets we see opening on to it, Rue Zacharie and Rue du Chat qui\r\nPêche, date, the first from 1219, as in part Rue Sac-à-lie in part Rue\r\ndes Trois-Chandeliers, from its earliest days a slum; the second, a mere\r\nalley, from 1540.\r\n\r\nQuai de Montebello began in 1554 as Quai des Bernardins from the\r\nvicinity of the convent--its walls still standing (_see_ p. 136). The\r\nquay bore several successive names till its entire reconstruction in\r\nearly nineteenth-century years, when it was renamed in memory of\r\nNapoléon’s great General, Maréchal Lannes.\r\n\r\nQuai de la Tournelle was Quai St-Bernard in the fourteenth century. The\r\nPorte St-Bernard was close by. La Tournelle was a stronghold where\r\nprisoners were kept close until deported. On the wall of Nos. 57-55, now\r\na distillery, we read the words: “Hôtel cy-devant de Nesmond.” It began\r\nas hôtel du Pain. Président de Nesmond, who owned it later, inscribed\r\nhis name on its frontage, the first inscription of the kind known. The\r\nPharmacie Centrale we see at No. 47 is the ancient convent of the\r\nMiramiones. The nuns were so named from Mme de Miramion who, left a\r\nwidow at sixteen, founded this convent for the care of poor girls. The\r\nnuns had their own boat to convey the girls to services at Notre-Dame.\r\nIn the chapel we find seventeenth-century decorations, and in the body\r\nof the building many interesting vestiges. On the walls at No. 37 we\r\nread the inscription, “Hôtel cy-devant du Président Rolland” (the\r\nanti-Jesuit). The old-time coaches for Fontainebleau had their bureau\r\nand starting-point at No. 21. No. 15 is the quaint and historic\r\nrestaurant de la Tour d’Argent, which has existed since 1575 (closed\r\nduring the war), famed for its excellent and characteristic _cuisine_\r\nand its picturesque, old-time menu cards, with their strong spice of\r\n_couleur locale_.\r\n\r\nQuai d’Austerlitz is the old Quai de l’Hôpital. The boundary-line\r\nbetween Paris and what was before its incorporation the village of\r\nAusterlitz passed at No. 21. The famous hôtel des Haricots, the prison\r\nof the Garde Nationale, where many artists and men of letters of olden\r\ndays served a period of punishment, often left their names written in\r\ncouplets on its walls, was till the early years of last century on the\r\nsite where now we see the busy departure platform of the Gare d’Orléans.\r\n\r\nQuai de la Gare, bordered by ancient houses, was till 1863 route\r\nNationale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII\r\n\r\nLES PONTS (THE BRIDGES)\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce more to the south-western corner of this “bonne ville de Paris.”\r\nThe first bridge over the Seine within the city boundary, beginning at\r\nthis end, is the Viaduct d’Auteuil (_see_ p. 320). The second is\r\nPont-Mirabeau, dating from the last decade of the nineteenth century.\r\nPont de Grenelle is of earlier date (1825). The Statue of Liberty we see\r\nthere (Bartholdi) is a replica in reduced size of that sent to New York.\r\nPont de Passy first spanned the Seine as a mere footway at the time of\r\nthe Exhibition of 1878, rebuilt in its present form in 1906. Pont d’Iéna\r\nhas a greater historic interest. Its construction was set about in 1806.\r\nIt had just been finished when in 1814 Blücher and the Allies proposed\r\nto blow it up. Royal influence prevailed to save it. It was called\r\nthenceforth till 1830 Pont des Invalides.\r\n\r\nPont de l’Alma, that emphatically Second-Empire bridge with its four\r\nNapoléonic soldiers, a Zouave, an infantry man, an artillery man, and a\r\nchasseur, was built between the years 1854-57. It was still unfinished\r\nwhen on April 2nd, 1856, Napoléon III and a sumptuously accoutred\r\ncortège passed across it to present flags to the regiments returned from\r\nthe Crimea. Pont-des-Invalides was built in 1855.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LE PONT DES ARTS ET L’INSTITUT]\r\n\r\nThe first stone of the very ornate Pont Alexandre III, formed of a\r\nsingle arch 107 mètres long, was laid with great ceremony by the Czar\r\nNicholas II in 1896. It was opened in 1900.\r\n\r\nA truly historic bridge is the Pont de la Concorde, built between 1787\r\nand 1790, finished with stones off the razed Bastille, and called at\r\nfirst Pont Louis XVI. Louis’ head fell, and the bridge became Pont de la\r\nRévolution. Twelve immense statues of famous statesmen and warriors were\r\nset up on it in 1828. They were considered too big, and in 1851 were\r\ntaken away to the Cour d’Honneur de Versailles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PONT-NEUF]\r\n\r\nPont de Solferino, built in 1858, records the victorious Italian\r\ncampaigns of 1859.\r\n\r\nPont-Royal was designed by Mansart and built in 1689 by Dominican monks\r\nto replace a smaller, more primitive bridge which had been known\r\nsuccessively as Pont-Barlier, Pont-des-Tuileries, Pont-Rouge, and Pont\r\nSte-Anne; it underwent restoration in 1841. Pont des Saints-Pères, or\r\nPont du Carrousel was one of the last of Paris bridges to pay toll;\r\nbuilt in 1834, restored in recent years.\r\n\r\nPont-des-Arts, so called from its vicinity to the Louvre, leading in a\r\nstraight line from the colonnaded archway of the Court Carrée to the\r\nInstitut, was opened in 1804, restored 1854.\r\n\r\nPont-Neuf, the most characteristic of Paris bridges, dates back to the\r\nreign of Henri III. The King himself laid its first stone in 1578, but\r\nit was not finished till 1603, when Henri IV was King. “Le bon Roi”\r\ndetermined to be the first to cross it on horseback, and while it was\r\nstill unsafe spurred his thoroughbred along the unfinished bridge way.\r\nHis lords, hastening to follow where their master led, were jolted out\r\nof their saddles, and falling upon the unparapeted structure, rolled\r\ninto the river and were drowned. Louis XIII set up a statue of his\r\nfather on horseback on the bridge; the statue of the horse was a gift\r\nfrom Cosimo de’ Medici to Louis’ mother. At the Revolution it was\r\noverturned, taken away, and melted down to make cannons for the\r\ninsurgents. Louis XVIII replaced it by a statue made of the bronze of\r\nthe first statue of Napoléon that had been set up on Place Vendôme and\r\nthat of his general, Desaix, on Place des Victoires. Though set up by\r\nthe Bourbon King, the figure we see is believed to contain within it a\r\nstatuette of Napoléon I and Voltaire’s _Henriade_. Until 1848 there were\r\nshops within the semicircles we see on either side of the old bridge,\r\nand beneath the second archway near the right bank there was one of the\r\nfirst hydraulic pumps, known as “la Samaritaine.” Its water was conveyed\r\nto the Louvre, the Tuileries, and to houses all around, and fed the\r\nfamous old fountain built in 1608, destroyed a century later, rebuilt in\r\n1715, again destroyed after another hundred years, with the figure of\r\nthe Samaritan woman giving water to our Saviour. The bathing-house near\r\nthe spot with its sign, and the big modern shop of hideous aspect, alone\r\nremain to record the name of the ancient pump and fountain. Two or three\r\nancient houses still stand on the Place du Pont-Neuf in the middle of\r\nthe bridge. At its picturesque western point we see the tree-shaded\r\nsquare Henri IV, known also as the Square du Vert-Galant. Place\r\nDauphine, at its south-western side, dates from the days when Henri’s\r\nson, later Louis XIII, was dauphin.\r\n\r\nThe Pont St-Michel we see to-day was built in 1857. The first bridge\r\nthere, joining the mainland to the island on the Seine, was constructed\r\ntowards the close of the fourteenth century. That bridge and two\r\nsuccessive ones were destroyed by fire.\r\n\r\nPont-au-Change, the Money-changers’ Bridge, was in olden days a wooden\r\nconstruction which went by the names Pont de la Marchandise and\r\nPont-aux-Oiseaux. Jewellers as well as money-changers plied their trade\r\nalong its planks, perhaps also bird merchants. It was a little higher up\r\nthe river in its early twelfth century days and was often flooded. It\r\nwas badly burnt, too, more than once; then in the seventeenth century\r\nwas entirely rebuilt of stone, and bronze statues of the royal family,\r\nLouis XIII, Louis XIV as a child, and Anne d’Autriche, set up there. In\r\nthe century following the houses upon it were all cleared away and in\r\n1858 it was again rebuilt.\r\n\r\nThe Petit-Pont joins the Île to the left bank at the very same spot\r\nwhere the Romans made a bridge across the river, one of two which\r\nspanned the Seine in their day, and on beyond. Like all town bridges of\r\nthe Middle Ages it was made of wood and each side thickly built upon by\r\nhouses and shops; windmills, too, stood on this ancient bridge, grinding\r\ncorn for the citizens around. And where we now see the Place du\r\nPetit-Pont there stood a wooden tower, la Tour de Bois, erected to\r\nprotect the bridge against the invading Normans. At the Musée Carnavalet\r\nan ancient inscription may be seen, recording the names of twelve\r\nwarriors who fought here to defend their city, led by Gozlin, bishop of\r\nParis, in 886. In the twelfth century Maurice de Sully, the builder of\r\nNotre-Dame, rebuilt the bridge in stone, but flood and fire laid it in\r\nruins time after time. The last destructive fire was in the spring of\r\n1718. It was then rebuilt minus its wooden houses. The present structure\r\ndates from 1853. The _place_ was built in 1782, when the Petit Châtelet,\r\nwhich had succeeded the Tour de Bois, was razed. In Rue du Petit-Pont we\r\nsee some old houses on the odd number side. Many were demolished when\r\nthe street was widened a few years ago.\r\n\r\nThe other bridge of Roman times, succeeding no doubt a rude primitive\r\nbridge, stretched where the Pont Notre-Dame now spans the river. The\r\nRoman bridge, built on staves, was overthrown by the Normans in 861.\r\nRebuilt as Pont Notre-Dame in 1413, it crashed to pieces some eighty\r\nyears later, carrying down with it the house of a famous printer of the\r\nday. It was alternatively destroyed and rebuilt several times till its\r\nlast reconstruction in 1853. Its houses were the first in France to be\r\nnumbered (1507). There were sixty-eight of them and the numbering was\r\ndone in gold or gilded ciphers. All these old houses were pulled down in\r\n1786. Pont Notre-Dame was the “bridge of honour.” Sovereigns coming to\r\nParis in state crossed it to enter the city. Close up to it stood for\r\nnearly two hundred years--1670 to 1856--the Pompe Notre-Dame, from\r\nwhich all the fountains of the district were supplied with water.\r\n\r\nPont d’Arcole, built as we now see it in 1854, succeeded a wooden bridge\r\nerected in 1828 with the name Pont de la Grève, commonly called Pont de\r\nla Balance. It gained its present name, recalling Napoléon’s victory of\r\n1796, in the Revolution of 1830, when a youth at the head of a band of\r\ninsurgents rushed upon the bridge waving the tricolor and shouting: “If\r\nI die, remember my name is Arcole.”\r\n\r\nPont-au-Double, so called because to cross it passengers paid a double\r\ntoll for the benefit of the Hôtel-Dieu, is a nineteenth-century\r\nconstruction, replacing the original bridge of the name built in the\r\nsixteenth century, a little higher up the river.\r\n\r\nPont de l’Archevêché dates from 1828. Pont St-Louis, joining l’Île de la\r\nCité to l’Île St-Louis, was built in 1614 as a wooden bridge painted red\r\nand called, therefore, Pont-Rouge. Like all wooden erections of the age,\r\nit was damaged by fire, and in the eighteenth century at the time of the\r\nRevolution, “icebergs” on the Seine knocked it over. An iron footbridge\r\nwas put up in its place and remained till 1862, when the bridge we see\r\nwas built.\r\n\r\nPont Louis-Philippe was built in the same year to replace a suspension\r\nbridge paying toll.\r\n\r\nPont de la Tournelle, built as we see it in 1851, began as a wooden\r\nbridge of fourteenth-century erection.[I]\r\n\r\nPont Marie was not, as one might suppose, named in honour of the Virgin,\r\nnor after Marie de’ Medici, who laid its first stone. It simply records\r\nthe name of its constructor, who was “Entrepreneur-Général des Ponts de\r\nFrance” at the time. Fifty houses were built upon it. Some were\r\ndestroyed by floods a few years later, others razed in 1788. The two\r\nPonts de Sully are, except Pont de Tolbiac, the most modern of Paris\r\nbridges, built some years after the Franco-Prussian war, replacing two\r\nolder bridges of slight importance. Pont d’Austerlitz dates from 1806,\r\nthe year of the great battle. When the Emperor fell the Allies demanded\r\nthe suppression of the name, and the French Government of the day called\r\nthe bridge Pont du Jardin du Roi, referring to the Jardin des Plantes in\r\nits vicinity (_see_ p. 155). The name did not catch on. The people would\r\nhave none of it. It has remained a reminder of Napoléon’s victory. It\r\nhas been enlarged more than once, the last time in 1885. Pont de Bercy\r\nwas built in 1835, rebuilt 1864. Pont de Tolbiac, in 1895. Pont\r\nNational, a footbridge, in 1853.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PARIS\r\n\r\n_Limite des Arrondts_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX TO HISTORIC PERSONS\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\nAbelard, 91, 135\r\n\r\nAbout,

of Rue de Beaubourg, Rue du Renard, and other old streets here\r\nare soon to disappear, their area transformed into a wide new avenue.\r\n\r\n[C] Bombs worked havoc here in the last year of the Great War\r\n(1914-1918).\r\n\r\n[D] The carting away of these vestiges has, we hear, just been decreed.\r\n\r\n[E] On the Peace Fête, July 14th, 1919, the Arènes were arranged\r\nas a theatre, and the performance of a classical play, “Le Cid,”\r\ntook place on the spot where wild beasts had fought of yore; while\r\ntwentieth-century Frenchmen sat on the very stone seats whereon had sat\r\nRomans and men of primitive Gallic tribes in the earliest days of the\r\nhistory of Paris and of France.\r\n\r\n[F] On July 14th, 1919, the French Army and contingents from the armies\r\nof the Allies, victorious after the dread war which had raged since\r\nAugust, 1914, passed in triumphal procession beneath the Arch, and\r\nthe chains which, since 1871, had barred its passage, were taken away\r\nfor good. On November 11th, when the “unknown soldier” was buried in\r\nWestminster Abbey, the “_poilu inconnu_” was laid beneath the Arc de\r\nTriomphe, and is now buried there.\r\n\r\n[G] Le comte de Franqueville died in January, 1920.\r\n\r\n[H] It was flooded again in 1920.\r\n\r\n[I] It was recently demolished to be replaced by a suspension-bridge in\r\norder to leave the river free for navigation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTypographical errors corrected by the etext transcriber:\r\n\r\nhere in invitation of the Rotonde=> here in imitation of the Rotonde {pg\r\n270}\r\n\r\nDemoulins=> Desmoulins {pg 17}\r\n\r\nKing Jerôme=> King Jérôme {pg 17}\r\n\r\nSebastopol=> Sébastopol {pg 42}\r\n\r\nSophie Arnoult=> Sophie Arnould {pg 60}\r\n\r\nRue Jean-de-Beauvias=> Rue Jean-de-Beauvais {pg 140}\r\n\r\nAqueduc d’Arcueil brought water from Rangis=> Aqueduc d’Arcueil brought\r\nwater from Rungis {pg 152}\r\n\r\nRue de l’Abbé-de-l’Epée=> Rue de l’Abbé-de-l’Épée {pg 153}\r\n\r\nrestauraunt Lapérouse => restaurant Lapérouse {pg 180}\r\n\r\ndays of unparalled warfare=> days of unparalleled warfare {pg 190}\r\n\r\ncut if off from surrounding buildings=> cut it off from surrounding\r\nbuildings {pg 218}\r\n\r\nSt-Marguerite=> Ste-Marguerite {pg 245}\r\n\r\npatronage of the comte de Province=> patronage of the comte de Provence\r\n{pg 284}\r\n\r\nits euphonius present name=> its euphonious present name {pg 293}\r\n\r\nAubriot, Prêvot de Paris (13th century), 107=> Aubriot, Prévôt de Paris\r\n(13th century), 107 {index}\r\n\r\nBourbon-Condè, Mlle. de, Abbesse de Remiremont, 193 Bourbon-Condé, Mlle.\r\nde, Abbesse de Remiremont, 193 {index}\r\n\r\nEnghien, Duc de, 170, 193, 217=> Enghien, Duc d’, 170, 193, 217 {index}\r\n\r\nEnghien, Duchesse de, 170=> Enghien, Duchesse d’, 170 {index}\r\n\r\nEstrées, Duchesse de, 197=> Estrées, Duchesse d’, 197 {index}\r\n\r\nIsore or Isire, 258=> Isore or Isïre, 258 {index}\r\n\r\nMarie de’ Medici, Queen=> Marie de’ Medicis, Queen {index}\r\n\r\nMonvoisin, Cathérine, 59=> Monvoisin, Catherine, 59 {index}\r\n\r\nMusset, Alfred de, 27, 29, 175, 197, 217, 231, 275, 204, 330=> Musset,\r\nAlfred de, 27, 29, 175, 197, 217, 231, 275, 304, 330 {index}\r\n\r\nOrléans, Duc de (_circ._ 1844), 277=> Orléans, Duc d’ (_circ._ 1844),\r\n277 {index}\r\n\r\nPaillard, Jeanne d’, 269=> Paillard, Jeanne de, 269 {index}\r\n\r\nSte-Généviève, 144, 146, 147, 164, 279, 289, 295=> Ste-Geneviève, 144,\r\n146, 147, 164, 279, 289, 295 {index}\r\n\r\nSevigné=> Sévigné {index}\r\n\r\nThierry, Amedée, 209=> Thierry, Amédée, 209 {index}\r\n\r\nAntoine, Dubois, Rue, 185=> Antoine-Dubois, Rue, 185 {index}\r\n\r\nBöêtie, Rue de la, 219=> Bôëtie, Rue de la, 219 {index}\r\n\r\nBanquier, Rue de, 254=> Banquier, Rue du, 254 {index}\r\n\r\nBuonaparte, Rue, 170, 206=> Bonaparte, Rue, 170, 206 {index}\r\n\r\nCarmes, Rue Basse de, 140=> Carmes, Rue Basse des, 140 {index}\r\n\r\n\r\nNapoleon=> Napoléon {numerous instances}",
