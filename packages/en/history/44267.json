PUNCH'S HISTORY OF MODERN ENGLAND\r\n\r\nBy\r\n\r\nCHARLES L. GRAVES\r\n\r\nIN FOUR VOLUMES\r\n\r\nVOL. I.--1841-1857\r\n\r\n  CASSELL AND COMPANY, LTD\r\n  London, New York, Toronto and Melbourne\r\n  1921\r\n\r\n_Published by arrangement with the Proprietors of \"Punch\"_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe title of this work indicates at once its main source and its\r\nlimitations. The files of _Punch_ have been generally admitted to be a\r\nvaluable mine of information on the manners, customs, and fashions of\r\nthe Victorian age, and of the wealth of material thus provided liberal\r\nuse has been made. But it must not be forgotten that _Punch_ has always\r\nbeen a London paper, and that in so far as English life is reflected in\r\nhis pages, London always comes first, though in this volume, and\r\nespecially during the \"Hungry 'Forties,\" Lancashire comes a very good\r\nsecond. For pictures of provincial society--such, for example, as that\r\ngiven in _Cranford_ or in the novels of Trollope--or of life in\r\nEdinburgh or Dublin, the chronicler of Victorian England must look\r\noutside _Punch_. The \"country cousin\" is not forgotten, but for the most\r\npart comes into view when he is on a visit to London, not when he is on\r\nhis native heath. Yet even with these deductions the amount of material\r\nis embarrassingly rich. And this is due not only to the multiplicity of\r\nsubjects treated, but to the manner in which they were discussed. Of\r\n_Punch_, in his early days at any rate, the criticism recently applied\r\nto Victorian writers in general by a writer in _Blackwood_ holds good:\r\n\"They had a great deal to say, and they said it sometimes in too loud a\r\nvoice. Such was their virtue, to which their vice was akin. Their vice\r\nwas the vice of rhetoric. They fell to the temptation of many words.\r\nThey wrote too often as the tub-thumper speaks, without much\r\nself-criticism and with a too fervent desire to be heard immediately and\r\nat all costs.\" In the 'forties _Punch_ doubled the rôles of jester and\r\npolitical pamphleteer, and in the latter capacity indulged in a great\r\ndeal of vehement partisan rhetoric. The loudest, the most passionate and\r\nmoving as well as the least judicial of his spokesmen was Douglas\r\nJerrold. The choice of dividing lines between periods must always be\r\nsomewhat artificial, but I was confirmed in my decision to end the first\r\nvolume with the year of the Indian Mutiny by the fact that it coincided\r\nwith the death of Douglas Jerrold, who from 1841 to 1857 had, more than\r\nany other writer, been responsible for the Radical and humanitarian\r\nviews expressed in _Punch_.\r\n\r\nMy task would have been greatly simplified by the exclusion of politics\r\naltogether. But to do that would have involved the neglect of what is,\r\nafter all, perhaps the most interesting and in many ways the most\r\nhonourable phase of _Punch's_ history, his championship of the poor and\r\noppressed, and his efforts to bridge the gap between the \"Two\r\nNations\"--the phrase which was used and justified in the finest passage\r\nof Disraeli's _Sybil_, and which I have chosen as the title for the\r\nfirst part of the present volume. To write a Social History of England\r\nat any time without reference to the political background would be\r\ndifficult; it is practically impossible in a chronicle based on _Punch_\r\nin the 'forties and 'fifties. In the second part I have endeavoured to\r\nredress the balance. Here one recognizes the advantages of _Punch's_\r\nLondon outlook in dealing with the Court and fashion and the acute\r\ncontrasts furnished between Mayfair on the one hand and the suburbs and\r\nslums on the other.\r\n\r\nNo attempt has been made to represent _Punch_ as infallible whether as a\r\nrecorder, a critic, or a prophet. He was often wrong, unjust, and even\r\ncruel--notably in his view of Peel and Lincoln, and in his conduct of\r\nthe \"No Popery\" crusade--though he seldom failed to make amends, even to\r\nthe extent of standing in a white sheet over Lincoln's grave. But the\r\nmajority of these confessions took the form of posthumous tributes. As\r\nfor the gradual cooling of _Punch's_ democratic ardour, that may be\r\nattributed partly to the removal or remedying of abuses by legislation\r\nand the education of public opinion; partly to the fact that newspapers\r\nfollow the rule of individuals, and tend to become more moderate as they\r\ngrow older. The great value of _Punch_ resides in the fact that it\r\nprovides us with a history of the Victorians _written by themselves_.\r\nThis is no guarantee of the accuracy of the facts recorded. We have had\r\npainful proof in recent years that contemporary evidence, when based on\r\nhearsay, even though written down red-hot in a diary, is, to put it\r\nmildly, incapable of corroboration. But, as reflecting the nature and\r\nmood of the writer, contemporary evidence is always interesting. My aim\r\nhas been to supply a critical commentary, and, where possible, to verify\r\nor correct the statements or judgments recorded in _Punch_.\r\nAcknowledgments of the various authorities consulted will be found in\r\nthe footnotes, but I should like to express my special indebtedness to\r\nthe _Dictionary of National Biography_; to the _New English Dictionary_;\r\nto _The Political History of England_, by Sir Sidney Low and Mr. Lloyd\r\nSanders; to Mr. C.R. Fay's _Life and Labour in the Nineteenth Century_;\r\nand, where the inner or domestic history of the paper is concerned, to\r\nMr. M. H. Spielmann's _History of Punch_.\r\n\r\nThe work of preparing this volume has been greatly lightened by the\r\nencouragement and practical help of Mr. Philip Agnew, the managing\r\ndirector, and Mr. Heather, the secretary, of Messrs. Bradbury, Agnew and\r\nCo.; by Miss Berry's transcription of extracts; and, above all, by the\r\nresearch, the advice and suggestions of Miss M. R. Walpole, the\r\nassistant librarian of the Athenæum Club.\r\n\r\nCHARLES L.

PUNCH'S HISTORY OF MODERN ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_PUNCH_ AND THE PEOPLE\r\n\r\n    O! fair and fresh the early spring\r\n      Her budding wreath displays,\r\n    To all the wide earth promising\r\n      The joy of harvest days;\r\n    Yet many a waste of wavy gold\r\n      Hath bent above the dead;\r\n    Then let the living share it too--\r\n      Give us our daily bread.\r\n\r\n    Of old a nation's cry shook down\r\n      The sword-defying wall,\r\n    And ours may reach the mercy-seat,\r\n      Though not the lordly hall.\r\n    God of the Corn! shall man restrain\r\n      Thy blessings freely shed?\r\n    O! look upon the isles at last--\r\n      Give us our daily bread.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Founders of \"Punch\"_]\r\n\r\nIt is fitting that a chronicle of social life in England in the\r\nVictorian age, drawn in its essentials from the pages of _Punch_, should\r\nbegin with the People. For _Punch_ began as a radical and democratic\r\npaper, a resolute champion of the poor, the desolate and the oppressed,\r\nand the early volumes abound in evidences of the miseries of the \"Hungry\r\n'Forties\" and in burning pleas for their removal. The strange mixture of\r\njocularity with intense earnestness which confronts us on every page\r\nwas due to the characters and antecedents of the men who founded and\r\nwrote for the paper at its outset. Of at least three of them it might be\r\nsaid that they were humanitarians first and humorists afterwards. Henry\r\nMayhew, one of the originators and for a short time joint-editor, was\r\n\"the first to strike out the line of philanthropic journalism which\r\ntakes the poor of London as its theme,\" and in his articles in the\r\n_Morning Chronicle_ and his elaborate work on _London Labour and the\r\nLondon Poor_, which occupied him intermittently for the best part of\r\ntwenty years, showed himself a true forerunner of Charles Booth. His\r\nversatility was amazing. The writer of the obituary notice of him in the\r\n_Athenæum_ observes that \"it would not be difficult to show him as a\r\nscientific writer, a writer of semi-religious biography, and an\r\noutrageous joker at one and the same time.\" Another member of the\r\noriginal staff was Gilbert à Beckett, who crowded an extraordinary\r\namount of work into his short life as leader-writer on _The Times_,\r\ncomic journalist, dramatist, Poor Law Commissioner and Metropolitan\r\nMagistrate. It was à Beckett's report on the scandal connected with the\r\nAndover Union--pronounced by the Home Secretary, Buller, to be one of\r\nthe best ever presented to Parliament--that led to important alterations\r\nin the Statute book, and secured for him, at the age of thirty-eight,\r\nhis appointment as Metropolitan Police Magistrate. Thackeray's\r\nreferences to \"à Beckett the beak\" are frequent and affectionate, and on\r\nhis death in 1856 a noble tribute was paid him in the pages of the\r\njournal he had served from its opening number. \"As a magistrate, Gilbert\r\nà Beckett, by his wise, calm, humane administration of the law, gave a\r\ndaily rebuke to a too ready belief that the faithful exercise of the\r\nhighest and gravest social duties is incompatible with the sportiveness\r\nof literary genius.\" These words were penned by Douglas Jerrold, who\r\ndied within a year of his friend, and was the most ardent and\r\nimpassioned humanitarian of the three. By the irony of fate Jerrold is\r\nchiefly remembered for his sledge-hammer retorts: the industrious and\r\ningenious playwright is little more than a name; the brilliant publicist\r\nand reformer, the friend and associate of Chartists, the life-long\r\nchampion of the underdog is forgotten. Gilbert à Beckett and Henry\r\nMayhew had both been at Westminster. Their people were well-to-do.\r\nDouglas Jerrold had known both poverty and privation, and his education\r\nwas largely acquired in a printer's office. His brief service in the\r\nNavy was long enough to make him a strenuous advocate of the claims of\r\nthe lower deck to more humane treatment. He did not believe that harsh\r\ndiscipline and flogging were necessary to the efficiency of either\r\nService. As a boy he had seen something of the human wreckage of war,\r\nand the spectacle had cured him for ever of any illusions as to\r\nmilitarism. But his distrust of Emperors, Dictators and the \"King\r\nbusiness\" generally--always excepting Constitutional Monarchy--was so\r\npronounced that any interference on their part was enough to convert him\r\ninto a Jingo. How far he was from being a pacificist may be judged from\r\nthe temper of _Punch_ in the Crimean War, its advocacy of ruthlessness\r\nas the best means of shortening the hostilities, and its bitter\r\ncriticism of Lord Aberdeen and Mr. Gladstone, and above all of Cobden\r\nand Bright, for their alleged pro-Russian sympathies. In the 'forties\r\nCobden and Bright were the leaders of that group of \"middle-class men of\r\nenthusiasm and practical sagacity\" which directed the Free Trade\r\nmovement, and they had been supported by _Punch_ in the campaign against\r\nthe Corn Laws. Douglas Jerrold was the spear-head of _Punch's_ attacks\r\non Protection, Bumbledom, unreformed Corporations, Cant and Snobbery,\r\nthe cruelty, the inequality, the expense and the delays of the Law. He\r\nmight be described as being violently and vituperatively on the side of\r\nthe angels. The freedom of his invective, notably in the articles signed\r\n\"Q,\" is beyond belief. Compared with his handling of ducal landlords,\r\nthe most drastic criticisms of Mr. Lloyd George in his earlier days are\r\nas water to wine. At all costs Jerrold was determined that the Tory dogs\r\nshould not have the best of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE POOR MAN'S FRIEND\r\n\r\n(The Hungry 'Forties)]\r\n\r\nBiographies of the _Punch_ staff do not fall within the scope of this\r\nchronicle, but some knowledge of the record and the temperament of the\r\nmen who gave the paper its peculiar quality for many years is essential\r\nto a proper understanding of its influence on public opinion. They were\r\nhumorous men, but they could be terribly in earnest, and they had\r\nabundant excuse for their seriousness. They could not forgive the Duke\r\nof Wellington when on August 24, 1841, he declared that England was \"the\r\nonly country in which the poor man, if only sober and industrious, was\r\nquite certain of acquiring a competency.\" They regarded it as \"a\r\nheartless insult thrown in the idle teeth of famishing thousands, the\r\nghosts of the victims of the Corn Laws.... If rags and starvation put up\r\ntheir prayer to the present Ministry, what must be the answer delivered\r\nby the Duke of Wellington? 'Ye are drunken and lazy!'\" A few days later\r\nMr. Fielden, M.P., moved \"that the distress of the working people at the\r\npresent time is so great throughout the country, but particularly in the\r\nmanufacturing districts, that it is the duty of this House to make\r\ninstant inquiry into the cause and extent of such distress, and devise\r\nmeans to remedy it; and at all events to vote no supply of money until\r\nsuch inquiry be made.\" The motion was negatived by 149 to 41, and a Tory\r\nmorning paper complacently observed that \"there has been for the last\r\nfew days a smile on the face of every well-dressed gentleman, and of\r\nevery well-to-do artisan, who wend their way along the streets of this\r\nvast metropolis. It is caused by the Opposition exhibition of Friday\r\nnight in the House of Commons.\" The comment on this \"spiteful\r\nimbecility\" is not to be wondered at: \"Toryism believes only in the\r\nwell-dressed and the well-to-do. Purple and fine linen are the\r\ninstrumental parts of her religion. Her faith is in glossy raiment and a\r\nfull belly.\" The Home Secretary stated in reply to a question, about a\r\nyear later, that the keepers of St. James's Park were particularly\r\nordered \"not to admit persons who wore fustian jackets,\" an order which\r\nprompted _Punch_ to remark that in Merry England \"labour was ignominy,\r\nand your only man the man with white hands and filbert nails.\" A writer\r\nin the _Examiner_ so recently as 1861 could remember the time when the\r\nsentries in St. James's Park used, at the point of the bayonet,\r\naccording to their orders, to dismount women from their pattens, and\r\nmake them trudge on with them in their hands. It is an old story; as\r\nold as the days of Ahasuerus, when \"no one might enter the King's gate\r\nclothed with sackcloth.\" _Punch_ never wearied of bringing home to his\r\nreaders these abrupt contrasts of wealth and poverty. The people were\r\ncrying for bread and Parliament had been occupied in carrying the\r\nVentilation of the House Bill and the Royal Kitchen Garden Bill. The\r\namount voted for the Royal Stables at Windsor was considerably more than\r\nthree times what was obtained from Parliament for the education of the\r\npoor. _The Times_ of December 2, 1841, quoted from the _Sporting\r\nMagazine_ an account of the accommodation provided for the Prince\r\nConsort's beagles and Her Majesty's dogs--sleeping beds, compartments\r\npaved with asphalt, dry and clean, with roomy and healthy green yards;\r\nand boiling and distemper houses detached from the other portions of the\r\nbuilding--and bracketed with it the sworn evidence of the late matron\r\nand medical attendant at the Sevenoaks Union. The lying-in ward was\r\nsmall and always looked dirty. \"There had been six women there at one\r\ntime: two were confined in one bed. It was impossible entirely to shut\r\nout the infection. I have known fifteen children sleep in two beds.\" Six\r\nyoung girls, inmates of the Lambeth workhouse, were charged about the\r\nsame time with breaking several panes of glass. In their defence they\r\ncomplained that they had been treated worse in the workhouse than they\r\nwould be in prison, and said that it was to cause their committal to the\r\nlatter place they broke the windows. Strange reading this in a comic\r\njournal, yet paralleled by similar extracts week after week and month\r\nafter month. The birth of the Prince of Wales was chronicled in the same\r\nissue of the daily papers which contained the \"luscious history\" of the\r\nLord Mayor's dinner:--\r\n\r\n    Oh, men of Paisley--good folks of Bolton--what promise for ye is\r\n    here! Turkeys, capons, sirloins, asparagus, pheasants, pineapples,\r\n    Savoy cakes, Chantilly baskets, mince-pies, preserved ginger,\r\n    brandy cherries, a thousand luscious cakes that \"the sense aches\r\n    at!\" What are all these gifts of plenty but a glad promise that in\r\n    the time of the \"sweetest young prince,\" on the birthday of that\r\n    Prince just vouchsafed to us, all England will be a large Lord\r\n    Mayor's table!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Fleshpots and Famine_]\r\n\r\nWhen the question of the title of the next King was discussed, _Punch_\r\nboldly suggested Lazarus:--\r\n\r\n    Let Henry the Fifth have his Agincourt; let him, in history, sit\r\n    upon a throne of Frenchmen's skulls; our LAZARUS THE FIRST shall\r\n    heal the wounds of wretchedness--shall gather bloodless laurels in\r\n    the hospital and workhouse--his ermine and purple shall make\r\n    fellowship with rags of linsey-wolsey--he shall be a king enthroned\r\n    and worshipped in the hearts of the indigent!\r\n\r\n    LAZARUS THE FIRST! There is hope in the very sound for the\r\n    wretched! There is Christian comfort to all men in the very\r\n    syllables! By giving such a name to the greatest king of the earth,\r\n    there is a shadowing forth and a promise of glorification to the\r\n    beggars in eternity. Poverty and sores are anointed--tatters are\r\n    invested with regality--man in his most abject and hopeless\r\n    condition is shown his rightful equality with the bravest of the\r\n    earth--royalty and beggary meet and embrace each other in the\r\n    embrace of fraternity.\r\n\r\n    O ye thousands famished in cellars! O ye multitudes with hunger and\r\n    cold biting with \"dragon's tooth\" your very vitals! shout, if you\r\n    can find breath enough, \"Long live Lazarus!\"\r\n\r\nIn those days there was a \"Pauper's Corner\" in _Punch_, in which the cry\r\nof the people found frequent and touching utterance. We have quoted from\r\n\"The Prayer of the People\" as a heading to this chapter. Another short\r\npoem deserves to be rescued from these old files, and added to the\r\nlyrics inspired by the Anti-Corn Law movement:--\r\n\r\n    Disease and want are sitting by my hearth--\r\n      The world hath left me nothing of its good!\r\n    The land hath not been stricken by a dearth,\r\n      And yet I am alone and wanting food.\r\n    The sparrow on the housetops o'er the earth\r\n      Doth find its sustenance, and surely HE\r\n    Who gave the mighty universe its birth\r\n      Would never love the wild bird more than me.\r\n\r\n_Punch_ had no illusions as to the genuineness of the Chartist movement,\r\nas may be gathered from his comments on the presentation of the Great\r\nPetition in 1842. There might, he owned, be dangerous demagogues who\r\noffered evil counsel, but the Chartists themselves had a degree of\r\nintelligence, a power of concentration, a knowledge of the details of\r\npublic business, heretofore unknown to great popular combinations of\r\ndissentients:--\r\n\r\n    There are among the Chartists hard-headed logicians--men keenly\r\n    alive to their sufferings, and what is more, soundly schooled as to\r\n    the causes of them. We grant that their petition presented to\r\n    Parliament contained many follies, very many extravagances--that it\r\n    prayed for what the timidity of poverty will call revolutionary\r\n    measures; but is it not an axiom in politics, that to get even a\r\n    little it is necessary to ask a great deal?\r\n\r\n    We only call upon Toryism, or Whiggism either, each to show us its\r\n    army of 3,000,000 of spotless politicians. But we contend that the\r\n    Chartists are foully maligned when they are branded as thieves and\r\n    spoilers. It is an old cry that property has its rights; it has\r\n    been added--and well added--that property has also its duties. To\r\n    these let us subjoin--property has also its cowardice.\r\n\r\nInquiries and investigations into the condition of agricultural\r\nlabourers and of artisans were already bringing to light many\r\ndisquieting facts. The physical destitution and spiritual forlornness of\r\nthe workers in the Midlands were painfully illustrated in the evidence\r\nof Mr. Horne on the condition of the operatives of Wolverhampton:--\r\n\r\n    I have entered the houses and hovels of journeymen locksmiths and\r\n    keymakers indiscriminately and unexpectedly, and seen the utmost\r\n    destitution; no furniture in the room below but a broken board for\r\n    a table, and a piece of plank laid across bricks for a seat; with\r\n    the wife hungry--almost crying with hunger--and in rags, _yet the\r\n    floor was perfectly clean_. I have gone upstairs, and seen a bed on\r\n    the floor of a room seven feet long by six feet high at one side,\r\n    but slanting down to nothing, like a wedge, where a husband, his\r\n    wife and three children slept, and with no other article in the\r\n    room of any kind whatever except the bed.... William\r\n    Benton--\"Thinks that's his name; can't spell it rightly. Age, don't\r\n    know justly--mother says he's turned eighteen. Can't read or write;\r\n    can tell some of his letters. Goes to a Sunday school sometimes. Is\r\n    of the Baptist school religion, _whatever that is_. Never heard of\r\n    Moses; never heard of St. Paul. Has heard of Christ; knows who\r\n    Jesus Christ was--he was Adam. Doesn't care much about going to\r\n    school if he could....\"\r\n\r\n    You will find poor girls who have never sung or danced; never seen\r\n    a dance; never read a book that made them laugh; never seen a\r\n    violet or a primrose or other flowers; and others whose only idea\r\n    of a green field was derived from _having been stung by a nettle_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Song of the Shirt_]\r\n\r\nThe Commission which had been engaged in learning the exact conditions\r\nof all the women and children employed in agriculture in England\r\nsuggested to _Punch_ an imaginary report of an inquiry into the state of\r\nthe aristocracy, and the moral condition, employment, health, diet,\r\netc., of the residents in Belgrave Square, most of the ladies examined\r\nbeing overworked by violent dancing in overheated rooms. Sweating in the\r\ncheap clothes trade was already attracting the notice of reformers, and\r\n_Punch_ was on the warpath when a Jew slop-seller prosecuted a poor\r\nwidow with two children for pawning articles which she had to make up\r\nfor him. She got 7d. a pair for making up trousers, and earned 7s. a\r\nweek. It was this episode, exposed in the verses \"Moses and Co.,\" which\r\npaved the way for Hood's immortal \"Song of the Shirt,\" the greatest\r\npoem, the most noble contribution that ever appeared in the pages of\r\nPunch. It was printed in the Christmas number of 1843, and dwarfed all\r\nthe other contributions to insignificance:--\r\n\r\nTHE SONG OF THE SHIRT\r\n\r\n    With fingers weary and worn,\r\n      With eyelids heavy and red,\r\n    A woman sat in unwomanly rags,\r\n      Plying her needle and thread--\r\n    Stitch! stitch! stitch!\r\n      In poverty, hunger and dirt,\r\n    And still with a voice of dolorous pitch\r\n      She sang the \"Song of the Shirt.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Work! work! work!\r\n      While the cock is crowing aloof!\r\n    And work--work--work,\r\n      Till the stars shine through the roof!\r\n    It's O! to be a slave\r\n      Along with the barbarous Turk,\r\n    Where woman has never a soul to save,\r\n      If this is Christian work!\r\n\r\n    \"Work--work--work\r\n      Till the brain begins to swim;\r\n    Work--work--work\r\n      Till the eyes are heavy and dim!\r\n    Seam and gusset and band,\r\n      Band and gusset and seam,\r\n    Till over the buttons I fall asleep,\r\n      And sew them on in a dream!\r\n\r\n    \"O men, with sisters dear!\r\n      O men, with mothers and wives!\r\n    It is not linen you're wearing out,\r\n      But human creatures' lives!\r\n    Stitch--stitch--stitch,\r\n      In poverty, hunger and dirt,\r\n    Sewing at once, with a double thread,\r\n      A shroud as well as a shirt.\r\n\r\n    \"But why do I talk of Death,\r\n      That phantom of grisly bone?\r\n    I hardly fear his terrible shape,\r\n      It seems so like my own--\r\n      It seems so like my own,\r\n      Because of the fasts I keep;\r\n    Oh God, that bread should be so dear,\r\n      And flesh and blood so cheap!\r\n\r\n    \"Work--work--work!\r\n      My labour never flags;\r\n    And what are its wages?

H. Spielmann\r\nin his _History of \"Punch\"._ Mark Lemon proved himself a great editor\r\nby deciding to publish the poem against the expressed opinions of his\r\ncolleagues, who thought it unsuitable for a comic journal, and also by\r\nhis omitting the one weak verse in the original MS. Strange to say, the\r\npoem does not appear in the index. The sequel may be found in Peel's\r\ncorrespondence, and does honour to a statesman who, while he lived,\r\nreceived scant justice from _Punch_. Though the impact of Hood's burning\r\nverses on public opinion was immense and abiding, Hood himself a year\r\nlater was dying in penury, of consumption. On November 16, 1844, Peel\r\nwrote him a letter expressing admiration for his work, and offering him\r\na pension. \"I am not conferring a private obligation upon you, but am\r\nfulfilling the intentions of the Legislature, which has placed at the\r\ndisposal of the Crown a certain sum (miserable indeed in amount) in\r\nrecognition of public claims on the bounty of the Crown.\" All he asked\r\nin return was that Hood would give him the opportunity of making his\r\npersonal acquaintance. That was impossible owing to the state of Hood's\r\nhealth. Mrs. Hood wrote on January 14, 1845, to beg for prompt\r\nassistance: Hood was dangerously ill and creditors were pressing. Peel\r\nsent the £100 at once, and on February 17 Hood wrote to thank him \"with\r\nall the sincerity of a dying man\" and to bid him a respectful farewell.\r\nHe could write no more, though he had wished to write one more paper.\r\nThen follow these memorable words, even more needed now than they were\r\nseventy-five years ago:--\r\n\r\n    Certain classes, at the poles of society, are already too far\r\n    asunder. It should be the duty of our writers to draw them nearer\r\n    by kindly attraction, not to aggravate existing repulsions and\r\n    place a wider moral gulf between rich and poor, with hate on one\r\n    side and fear on the other. But I am too weak for this task, the\r\n    last I had set myself. It is death that stops my pen, you see, not\r\n    a pension. God bless you, sir, and prosper all your measures for\r\n    the benefit of my beloved country.\r\n\r\nHood died on May 3, 1845, and was buried in Kensal Green, but more than\r\nseven years later no tombstone marked his resting-place, and _Punch_ was\r\nmoved to ask:--\r\n\r\n    If marble mark the soldier-statesman's grave,\r\n      If monuments adorn his place of sleep\r\n    Whose hand struck off the fetters from the slave,\r\n      And his who sought out woe in dungeons deep,\r\n\r\n    Did _he_ not fight for Toil's sad sons and daughters?\r\n      Was not _his_ voice loud for the worker's right?\r\n    Was _he_ not potent to arrest the slaughters\r\n      Of Capital and Labour's desperate fight?\r\n\r\nEventually a tombstone was erected, bearing the words: \"He sang the Song\r\nof the Shirt,\" but the pension continued to his widow lapsed on her\r\ndeath a year later. A sum of £800, collected by public subscription, was\r\nall that was available for the children, Lord John Russell, then\r\nPremier, having found himself unable to extend the pension for their\r\nbenefit, at a time when, as _Punch_ reminded him, the Duchess of\r\nInverness, widow of the Duke of Sussex, was drawing a pension of £1,000\r\na year. \"The Song of the Shirt\" rang through the land, but it did not\r\nend the hardships of the sweated sempstress. Within a year _Punch_ was\r\nmoved to indignation by the story of Esther Pierce, paid 6d. for\r\nembroidering eighty blossoms on a silk shawl, and charged with pawning\r\nthe goods of her employer. In 1848, under the heading \"The Cheap Shirt\r\nMarket,\" we read of a woman prosecuted on a similar charge, who was paid\r\n2s. 6d. a dozen for making up shirts, or 2½d. apiece, and on these\r\nearnings supported herself, two children and a husband out of work. As\r\nlate as 1859 the sweated shirt makers were still receiving only 4s. 6d.\r\na dozen. No wonder is it that when the movement in favour of cottage\r\ngardens was frowned upon in some quarters on the ground that flowers\r\nhere were \"out of place,\" _Punch_ retorted with the bitter jibe: \"What\r\nhas the labourer to do with stocks but sit in them?\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Duke of Norfolk's Panacea_]\r\n\r\nNo wonder again that a legal pillory of harsh sentences was a constant\r\nfeature of his pages in the 'forties and 'fifties. A humane magistrate\r\nwho refused in 1845 to hear a charge of wood-stealing from a hedge\r\nbrought against a man earning 7s. a week--the common rate at the time\r\nfor agricultural labourers--stated from the Bench that he knew of good\r\nhands in Warwickshire who were earning only 3s. and 3s. 10d. a week.\r\nMeat was a luxury: only the elders got bacon: the children potatoes and\r\nsalt: bread was 10d. a loaf. Yet this was the time when the Duke of\r\nNorfolk seriously proposed that the poor should eke out their meagre\r\nfare by the use of curry powder,[1] a suggestion that recalls the\r\nhistoric comment of the French lady, shortly before the Revolution, on\r\nhearing that the peasantry had no bread, \"Then why don't they eat cake?\"\r\n_Punch_ dealt faithfully with this ducal _gaffe_ under the heading, \"A\r\nReal Blessing to Landlords\":--\r\n\r\n    The genuine Anti-Appetitive Curry Powder, strongly recommended by\r\n    the Duke of Norfolk, is the labourer's only true substitute for\r\n    bread and meat. It possesses the singular property of deluding the\r\n    empty stomach into a sense of fullness, and is calculated to\r\n    relieve those distressing symptoms of vacuity which result from\r\n    living on seven shillings a week. It may be warranted to supersede\r\n    potatoes and bacon; containing in fact, in itself, the essence of\r\n    gammon; and one pinch dissolved in a tumbler of hot water is equal\r\n    to a pot of beer. Landed proprietors, not wishing to reduce their\r\n    rents, will find this preparation admirably calculated to reconcile\r\n    labourers with their present rate of wages by enabling them almost\r\n    entirely to dispense with food. Sold in pots, at from one shilling.\r\n    Agricultural societies supplied.\r\n\r\n    N.B.--A liberal allowance on taking a quantity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For the actual speech of the Duke see the _Examiner_ for\r\n1845, p. 786.]\r\n\r\nIn these years the Dukes were constantly in _Mr. Punch's_ pillory; the\r\nDuke of Marlborough for his harsh treatment of his tenantry in\r\nconnection with the Woodstock Election in 1844; the Duke of Buckingham\r\nfor prosecuting a rat-catcher, who was fined 18s. or fourteen days for\r\nkilling a leveret as big as a kitten, and about the same time for\r\nprosecuting a poacher for damaging a fence to the amount of one penny;\r\nthe Duke of Sutherland, in the same year again, for the arbitrary rules\r\nenforced on his estate, the whole county being parcelled out into\r\nsheep-walks, which suggested to _Punch_ that he should be dignified with\r\nthe Order of Mutton; the Duke of Richmond for apparently imagining that\r\nagricultural troubles could be settled by the simple process of drinking\r\nthe health of the British labourer; the Duke of Atholl for closing Glen\r\nTilt. Even the Great Duke himself was not immune from criticism and\r\ncensure. He had done a great work in the past, but he was out of touch\r\nwith the times and lacking in sympathy with the people. His words\r\nreflected his iron temperament: they were like tenpenny nails. In 1845\r\n_Punch_ made bold to suggest that the time for his going to grass had\r\narrived:--\r\n\r\n    _The Times_ says \"he is the leader of the aristocracy.\" Let him go\r\n    and lead the Dukes. He is fit for that, but not any longer for\r\n    governing us.... The old Duke should no longer block up the great\r\n    thoroughfare of civilisation--he should be quietly and respectfully\r\n    eliminated. For the future, let us have him and admire him--in\r\n    history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Harsh Sentences on Children_]\r\n\r\nHarsh sentences on juvenile delinquents and plebeian offenders under the\r\nGame Laws and Sunday Trading Act, the harrying of vagrants, the\r\ntreatment of destitution as a crime, are a constant spur to _Punch's_\r\nreforming zeal. The hard cases quoted from _The Times_ and many\r\nprovincial papers include the flogging of a boy for accidentally killing\r\na leveret; the trial of a starving woman for the crime of stealing a\r\nfaggot worth a penny; the prosecution of two children, aged six and\r\ntwelve, for picking two handfuls of peas while walking in a field\r\nthrough which there was a path, and the sending of the elder boy to gaol\r\nfor fourteen days in default of payment of a fine of 6d. and 13s. costs;\r\na sentence of six months' imprisonment for stealing a crab worth 1s.\r\n6d.; the fining of a man 5s. by his vicar because his child, aged nine,\r\nhad sold a halfpenny worth of sweets to another child on Sunday--which\r\nreminds _Punch_ of Herod and the Innocents. In 1841 Lord Brougham, in\r\nParliament, during a discussion on prison discipline, stated that a man\r\n\"had been confined ten weeks, having been fined 1s., with 14s. costs,\r\nbecause he was absent one Sunday from church.\" Then in 1846 we have the\r\ncase of a woman charged with \"exciting charity,\" though she had not\r\nsolicited alms. As late as 1859 we read of a child of nine in Essex,\r\nsent to prison for fourteen days and whipped for stealing ½lb. of\r\nbutter. Small wonder is it that _Punch_ was a fervent and convinced\r\nanti-Sabbatarian, or that he wrote in 1846: \"The State does not trouble\r\nitself much with education in this country, but the most usual schools\r\nfor the young and destitute are the prisons.\" The alternatives of fine\r\nor imprisonment heightened the evil, for while the poor delinquent went\r\nto gaol the well-to-do offender escaped. Brutal assaults on women were\r\npunished by a lenient fine, which the bully could generally pay;\r\nfraudulent tradesmen were not deterred from repeating their offences by\r\na money penalty which they could easily afford; it was only the\r\npenniless pilferer who was sure of prison. In 1844 we find _Punch_\r\ntracing incendiarism in Suffolk to the greed of the farmers in keeping\r\nwages down, and publishing Leech's famous cartoon \"The Home of the Rick\r\nBurner.\" _Facit indignatio versum_: here is the picture of \"The Fine Old\r\nEnglish Gentleman of the Present Time\"--in the middle of the Hungry\r\n'Forties:--\r\n\r\n    I'll sing you a fine old song, improved by a modern pate,\r\n    Of a fine Old English Gentleman, who owns a large estate,\r\n    But pays the labourers on it a very shabby rate.\r\n    Some seven shillings each a week for early work and late,\r\n      Gives this fine Old English Gentleman, one of the present time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    In winter's cold, when poor and old for some assistance call,\r\n    And come to beg a trifle at the portals of his hall,\r\n    He refers them to the workhouse, that stands open wide for all;\r\n    For this is how the parish great relieve the parish small,\r\n      Like this fine Old English Gentleman, one of the present time.\r\n\r\nHere is the portrait of the pauper:--\r\n\r\n    Houseless, famish'd, desp'rate man,\r\n      A ragged wretch am I!\r\n    And how, and when, and where I can,\r\n      I feed, and lodge, and lie.\r\n    And I must to the workhouse go,\r\n      _If_ better may not be;\r\n    Ay, _if_, indeed! The workhouse! No!\r\n      The gaol--the gaol for me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    There shall I get the larger crust,\r\n      The warmer house-room there;\r\n    And choose a prison since I must,\r\n      I'll choose it for its fare.\r\n    The dog will snatch the biggest bone,\r\n      So much the wiser he:\r\n    Call me a dog--the name I'll own--\r\n      The gaol--the gaol for me.\r\n\r\nThe horror of the \"Union\" inspired some of the most moving pages in\r\nDickens' \"Our Mutual Friend\" some twenty years later. How deep and well\r\njustified it was in the 'forties may be gathered from the scandal of the\r\nAndover Union workhouse in '45, the habitual underfeeding of paupers,\r\nand the frequent inquests at which verdicts of \"natural death\" were\r\nreturned on victims of neglect and even cruelty. The opposition to the\r\nhumane proposal to establish a lending library at the Greenwich\r\nworkhouse, following the example of Wandsworth, moved _Punch_ to\r\nindignant irony: \"Food for a pauper's mind, indeed! It is quite enough\r\nto have to find food for his body.\" In 1851 an inquiry into the\r\nmanagement of a workhouse near Leeds revealed that the inmates were fed\r\nat a trough, six at a time. In 1857 the workhouse children at Bath were\r\nnot allowed to see the pantomime _Jack and the Beanstalk_. Owing to the\r\nintervention of the Guardians, headed by a clergyman, the children were\r\nactually stopped at the door of the theatre. But in \"Dust from a\r\nBath-brick\" _Punch_ dusted the jackets of the Guardians in his best\r\nstyle. Again and again we find him protesting against the regulation of\r\nthe new Poor Law which separated man and wife directly they entered the\r\nworkhouse. For professional mendicants he had no sympathy. Witness the\r\nironical lines on \"The Jolly London Beggars\":--\r\n\r\n    A fig for honest occupation,\r\n      Beggary's an easier trade;\r\n    Industry is mere starvation,\r\n      Mendicancy's better paid.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Bigamy or Divorce?_]\r\n\r\nIn the long campaign for the reform of the Marriage Laws _Punch_ never\r\nceased to reiterate his conviction that cheap divorce was a better\r\nremedy than the punishment of the brutal husband. Yet when Mr. Justice\r\nMaule delivered his historic judgment in 1845, _Punch_ hardly rendered\r\njustice to that masterpiece of fruitful irony:--\r\n\r\nWAGGERY OF THE BENCH\r\n\r\n    One Thomas Rollins, as poor as beggary, was arraigned as a\r\n    bigamist. His first wife had left him and become no better than one\r\n    of the wicked. Whereupon Rollins took another helpmate; and, for\r\n    such violation of the law, found himself face to face with Justice\r\n    Maule, who, as it will appear, happened to be in one of his\r\n    pleasantest humours. He told the culprit, and we doubt not with a\r\n    gravity of face worthy of the original _Billy Lackaday_, \"that the\r\n    law was the same for him as it was for a rich man, and was _equally\r\n    open for him_, through its aid, to afford relief.\" In the like way\r\n    that turbot and champagne are the same to Lazarus as to Dives; if\r\n    Lazarus could only buy the taste of them. Beggar and rich man have\r\n    both the same papillary organs--a dignifying truth for the outcast\r\n    wanting a dinner! However, the droll Judge continued his\r\n    pleasantry:\r\n\r\n    \"He (Rollins) _should have brought an action_ against the man who\r\n    was living in the way stated with his wife, and _he should have\r\n    obtained damages_, and then _should have gone to the Ecclesiastical\r\n    Court_ and obtained a divorce, which would have done what seemed to\r\n    have been done already, _and then he should have gone to the House\r\n    of Lords_, and, proving all his case and the preliminary\r\n    proceedings, _have obtained a full and complete divorce_; after\r\n    which he might, if he liked it, have married again.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a delicious vein of humour in this. It smacks of the grave,\r\nearnest fun of Swift. How the jest increases in volume as we follow the\r\npauper from court to court--tarry with him awhile in the House of\r\nLords--and finally see him \"married again.\" And then the Judge, in a\r\nsustained spirit of drollery, observes:\r\n\r\n    \"The prisoner _might perhaps object to this_, that he had not the\r\n    money to pay the expenses, which would amount to about £500 or\r\n    £600--_perhaps he had not so many pence_--but this did not exempt\r\n    him from paying the penalty for committing a felony, of which he\r\n    had been convicted.\"\r\n\r\nOf course not. Therefore Thomas Rollins is in effect not punished for\r\nmarrying a second wife, but for the turpitude of wanting \"about £500 or\r\n£600,\" by means of which he might have rid himself of his first spouse.\r\nIn England the bonds of Hymen are only to be cut with a golden axe.\r\nAssuredly there needs a slight alteration in the marriage service. \"Whom\r\nGod hath joined, let no man put asunder,\" should be followed by these\r\nwords, \"_Unless paid about £500 or £600 to separate them_.\"\r\n\r\n_Punch_, we are afraid, was inclined, in those days at any rate, to\r\nresent any attempt to usurp his functions as a public ironist, even by\r\nthose who were fighting on the same side as himself. Anyhow, he omitted\r\nto mention that the judge sentenced Rollins to one day's imprisonment.\r\nBut later references to this famous judgment made it clear that _Punch_\r\nrecognized that the judge's irony was deliberate and animated by a\r\nsincere desire for reform, not by mere irresponsible \"waggery.\"\r\n\r\nAgainst the Game Laws and their administration _Punch_ waged a\r\ncontinuous war. Squires were condemned for the damage done to land by\r\ngame kept up for the profit of the landlord, hares being fed at the\r\nexpense of the tenant farmer. John Bull worshipped rank and money, and\r\namongst his idols were hares, pheasants and partridges, with his \"bold\r\npeasantry\" as their constant victims.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Model Labourer_]\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Grantley Fitzhardinge Berkeley, M.P., who published a pamphlet\r\nin 1845 defending the drastic treatment of poachers, was very roughly\r\nhandled for his calm assertion of the sacred rights of game; but perhaps\r\nthe most effective comment on the inequalities of life on the land is to\r\nbe found in the ironical portrait of \"The Model Labourer\" in the summer\r\nof 1848:--\r\n\r\n    He supports a large family upon the smallest wages. He works from\r\n    twelve to fourteen hours a day. He rises early to dig in what he\r\n    calls his garden. He prefers his fireside to the alehouse, and has\r\n    only one pipe when he gets home, and then to bed. He attends church\r\n    regularly, with a clean smock frock and face, on Sundays, and waits\r\n    outside, when service is over, to pull his hair to his landlord,\r\n    or, in his absence, pays the same reverence to the steward. Beer\r\n    and he are perfect strangers, rarely meeting, except at Christmas\r\n    or harvest time; and as for spirits, he only knows them, like meat,\r\n    by name. He does not care for skittles. He never loses a day's work\r\n    by attending political meetings. Newspapers do not make him\r\n    discontented, for the simple reason that he cannot read. He\r\n    believes strongly in the fact of his belonging to the \"Finest\r\n    Peasantry.\" He sends his children to school somehow, and gives them\r\n    the best boots and education he can. He attributes all blights, bad\r\n    seasons, failures, losses, accidents to the repeal of the Corn\r\n    Laws. He won't look at a hare, and imagines, in his respect for\r\n    rabbits, that Jack Sheppard was a poacher. He whitewashes his\r\n    cottage once a year. He is punctual with his rent, and somehow, by\r\n    some rare secret best known by his wages, he is never ill. He knows\r\n    absolutely nothing beyond the affairs of his parish, and does not\r\n    trouble himself greatly about them. If he has a vote, it is his\r\n    landlord's, of course. He joins in the cry of \"Protection,\"\r\n    wondering what it means, and puts his X most innocently to any\r\n    farmer's petition. He subscribes a penny a week to a Burial\r\n    Society. He erects triumphal arches, fills up a group of happy\r\n    tenants, shouts, sings, dances--any mockery or absurdity, to please\r\n    his master. He has an incurable horror of the Union, and his\r\n    greatest pride is to starve sooner than to solicit parish relief.\r\n    His children are taught the same creed. He prefers living with his\r\n    wife to being separated from her. His only amusement is the Annual\r\n    Agricultural Fat-and-Tallow Show; his greatest happiness if his\r\n    master's pig, which he has fattened, gets the prize. He struggles\r\n    on, existing rather than living, infinitely worse fed than the\r\n    beasts he gets up for the exhibitions--much less cared about than\r\n    the soil he cultivates; toiling without hope, spring, summer,\r\n    autumn and winter, his wages never higher--frequently less--and\r\n    perhaps after thirty years' unceasing labour, if he has been all\r\n    that time with the same landlord, he gets the munificent reward of\r\n    six-and-twopence, accompanied, it is true, with a warm eulogium on\r\n    his virtues by the President (a real Lord) for having brought up\r\n    ten children and several pigs upon five shillings a week. This is\r\n    the MODEL LABOURER, whose end of life is honourably fulfilled if he\r\n    is able, after a whole life's sowing for another, to reap a coffin\r\n    for himself to be buried in!\r\n\r\nThis is not an imaginary portrait, though some of the touches are\r\nheightened by the artist. As for the vote, a good illustration is to be\r\nfound in the advertisement of the sale of the Earl of Ducie's domain in\r\n1843, quoted by _Punch_ on page 14 of Vol. v., including \"the entire\r\nvillage of Nymphfield, wherein are 66 houses and the Ducie Arms, with\r\npolitical influence extending over 1,200 honest yeomen.\" As for the\r\nexhibitions, with their rewards and prizes for the virtuous and\r\nindustrious poor, _Punch_ was lavish of sarcasm at the expense of this\r\nparsimonious and condescending benevolence, when the prizes represented\r\na miserable percentage on the profits which the recipients had earned\r\nfor their masters by special zeal. So we find him suggesting a prize of\r\n£1 to the labourer who had lived the longest number of years on the\r\nshortest commons, and during the same period Leech's cartoon of a show\r\nwhere the prize pig is awarded £3 3s. and the prize peasant £2 2s. When\r\nbaby shows were introduced in the next decade, Lord Palmerston was drawn\r\nwith his prize agricultural baby, holding up a wizened old labourer with\r\nthe label \"Prize, 30s. Labourer all his life and never wanted to improve\r\nhis condition.\" _Punch's_ democratic distrust of Lords and Ladies\r\nBountiful was no doubt in part the cause of his hostility to the Young\r\nEngland movement. From his account of the matter one might gather that\r\nDisraeli identified himself with, if he did not actually originate, the\r\nfashion of giving prizes to the working classes. Lord John Manners fell\r\nan easy prey to \"the Democritus of Fleet Street\" (as the _Daily\r\nTelegraph_ called _Punch_ in later years), when in \"England's Trust and\r\nother Poems\" was penned the memorable _cri de coeur_:--\r\n\r\n    Though I could bear to view our crowded towns\r\n    Sink into hamlets or unpeopled downs;\r\n    Let wealth and commerce, laws and learning die,\r\n    But leave us still our old nobility.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Lord Shaftesbury_]\r\n\r\nBut \"Young England\" practised better than its poet preached. For proof\r\none need only turn to the history of the reform of the Factory Acts\r\nwhich _Punch_ unflinchingly supported, while rendering scant justice to\r\nthe man who started this \"great campaign against the oppression of the\r\nindustrial poor\" and carried it to a successful conclusion, or to some\r\nof those who lent him most valuable assistance. Of Lord Ashley,\r\nafterwards the seventh Earl of Shaftesbury, it has been said that if\r\nthere is a Seventh Heaven he is there. But he was a Tory, who had\r\nopposed the Reform Bill of 1832, though he supported Catholic\r\nEmancipation and resigned his seat for Dorset in 1846 in the belief that\r\nthe continuance of the Corn Laws was impracticable; he was an\r\naristocrat; he held pronounced Evangelical views and was a convinced\r\nSabbatarian. On all these grounds he was held suspect by _Punch_. Yet as\r\nearly as 1833 Lord Ashley was mainly instrumental in securing the\r\npassage of a Factory Act, the scope of which was narrowed by the\r\nhostility of Whigs, manufacturing capitalists and doctrinaire Radicals.\r\nIn 1840 he got a Commission appointed, whose report, published in 1842,\r\nshocked the conscience of the nation and led to the introduction of a\r\nBill excluding women and children from mines. In the next phase of this\r\nhumane campaign, when Sir James Graham introduced a Government Bill to\r\nregulate labour in factories, Disraeli and the \"Young England\" group\r\nsupported Ashley throughout against the refusal of the Government to\r\nconcede the ten-hour limit. But the Government, supported by Bright and\r\nmost of the Radical Free Traders, threw all its weight into the scale of\r\nthe millowners, carried the day against Ashley, \"Young England\" and most\r\nof the official Whigs, and until 1847 the labour of boys from 13 to 18\r\nyears of age, and of girls and women to 21, stood at twelve hours a\r\nday. The Act of 1847, which limited the hours of work for women and\r\nchildren to ten hours, was imperfectly drafted, and the interpretation\r\nplaced upon it by the Courts enabled manufacturers to evade its\r\nprovisions. In 1850 the Government offered a compromise implying a\r\n10½ hour day, which was reluctantly accepted by Lord Ashley. But\r\nDisraeli supported Lord John Manners in protesting against this\r\ncompromise. As his biographers do well to remind us, he condemned it as\r\na breach of faith with the overworked population: the honour of\r\nParliament was concerned in not taking advantage of a legal flaw. The\r\nGovernment again carried the day, but only for the moment; the objects\r\nof its critics have long since been more than obtained. Disraeli's\r\nspeech on this occasion was \"instinct with the spirit of _Sybil_\"--his\r\nfinest and best constructed novel. _Sybil_ was published in 1845, and\r\nthough in its essentials exhibiting a remarkable convergence with the\r\naims of _Punch_, was never mentioned by him at the time. Disraeli was a\r\nJew. Now _Punch_ consistently supported the removal of Jewish\r\ndisabilities as an act of justice, and when rebuking the Exeter Hall\r\nphilanthropists for thinking that charity must begin abroad, and for\r\nneglecting the starving sempstress for the apostate Jew, Chinese,\r\nHottentots, etc., gave them this excellent advice: \"Ye who would convert\r\nthe Jews, first copy the Jews' great virtue; first take care of your own\r\npoor; feed and clothe them, and then, if you will, with the superfluity\r\nmake converts of the Hebrews.\" But _Punch_ was no lover of Jews, and\r\nleast of all of Disraeli. He soon recognized his abilities as a great\r\nParliamentary gladiator; he admitted his courage and tenacity. In the\r\nmain, however, _Punch_ regarded him at this stage of his career as a\r\nbrilliant but undesirable alien, a flamboyant charlatan, an\r\nuntrustworthy and insincere patron of the agricultural interest. Yet\r\n_Sybil_ in its pictures of the inequalities and miseries of the social\r\nand industrial system then prevailing, was conceived and executed\r\nlargely in the spirit of Hood's deathbed letter to Peel. Disraeli was\r\nnever more \"on the side of the angels\" than when he wrote the dialogue\r\nbetween Egremont and the stranger. The stranger, after observing that\r\nwhile Christianity teaches us to love our neighbours as ourselves,\r\nmodern society acknowledges no neighbour, adds that society, still in\r\nits infancy, is beginning to feel its way. Egremont replies:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Two Nations_]\r\n\r\n    \"Well, Society may be in its infancy; but, say what you like, our\r\n    Queen reigns over the greatest nation that ever existed.\" \"Which\r\n    nation?\" asked the younger stranger; \"for she reigns over two.\" The\r\n    stranger paused. Egremont was silent, but looked inquiringly.\r\n    \"Yes,\" resumed the younger stranger after a moment's interval, \"two\r\n    nations; between whom there is no intercourse and no sympathy; who\r\n    are as ignorant of each other's habits, thoughts and feelings as if\r\n    they were dwellers in different zones, or inhabitants of different\r\n    planets; who are formed by a different breeding, and fed by a\r\n    different food, are ordered by different manners, and are not\r\n    governed by the same laws.\" \"You speak of,\" said Egremont\r\n    hesitatingly,--\"THE RICH AND THE POOR.\"\r\n\r\nDisraeli's sumptuous upholstery, which Thackeray was so fond of\r\nburlesquing, is occasionally apparent in _Sybil_, though one must not\r\nforget his own explanation: \"I write in irony, and they call it\r\nbombast.\" For the rest the pictures of life in the agricultural and\r\nindustrial districts, the squalid wretchedness of cellar and hovel, the\r\nevils of the truck system and the \"tommy-shop\" were never more luridly\r\npainted by any Chartist writer than by Disraeli in _Sybil_. The details\r\nare not exaggerated; they are borne out by sober historians such as S.\r\nR. Gardiner in describing the conditions in Manchester, Bethnal Green\r\nand Dorsetshire. Disraeli's inability to reproduce the speech of\r\nartisans or peasants correctly is a negligible matter. He never made a\r\nsystematic tour in the slums as Lord Ashley did in preparation for his\r\ncampaign on behalf of Ragged Schools; he was not a literary realist; but\r\nhere he was in touch with realities, and we have his own word for it\r\nthat he wrote from personal observation. The heroes of the book are all\r\non the side of reform; Gerard, the people's leader; St. Lys, the\r\nhumanitarian parson; Egremont, an aristocrat converted from indifference\r\nby contact with the poor; and the martyrs are the victims of the\r\nexisting system, agricultural labourers on 8s. a week and starving\r\nhand-loom weavers. Disraeli has no use for the Lord Marneys and de\r\nMowbrays who complacently acquiesced in the serfdom of the slaves in\r\nsmock-frocks or even denied that they were badly off. They were not a\r\nreal aristocracy, a \"corporation of the best and bravest,\" in Carlyle's\r\nphrase. But for reasons already given _Punch_ was not prepared to accept\r\nDisraeli as an ally. He was too useful as a butt for satire and\r\nridicule, and his oriental personality was antipathetic to _Punch's_\r\neminently British mind. Moreover, in justice to _Punch_ it must be\r\nadmitted that there were real divergences. Disraeli opposed the repeal\r\nof the Corn Laws, though he lived to describe Protection as dead and\r\ndamned. The readjustment of the \"Two Nations\" which, as a leader of the\r\n\"Young England\" movement, he proposed for the remedy and removal of the\r\ndistress and tumult and anger of the Hungry 'Forties, involved in his\r\nview the strengthening of the Sovereign and the maintenance of the\r\nleadership of the aristocracy. They were to be awakened to their\r\nresponsibilities and duties, but not shorn of their rights and\r\nprivileges. _Punch_ was a thoroughgoing Free Trader and Corn Law\r\nRepealer, a believer in measures rather than men, an unsparing critic of\r\nKings and Courts, and whenever he saw an aristocratic head, inclined to\r\nhit it. \"Young England\" only served as a target for satire; _Punch_\r\nrefused to recognize the genuine idealism by which the best of the group\r\nwere animated. But, as one of their defenders has admitted, they were\r\nnot a real Party, and were concerned with principles rather than\r\nspecific measures of reform. Idealism which stopped short of immediate\r\naction did not appeal to _Punch_. Though often a petulant and intolerant\r\ncritic, he was always on the look out for practical evidences of reform,\r\nlegislative, administrative or philanthropic. In 1842 he hailed the\r\ndecision to close the Fleet Prison, and when it was about to be\r\ndemolished, wrote in 1845: \"Truly there _are_ sermons in stones, and if\r\nBeelzebub wanted to preach on the folly, cruelty, ignorance and\r\nwickedness of men towards men, even he could not hit upon a more\r\nsuggestive text than is written--written in tears--on every stone of the\r\nFleet Prison.\" Of the efforts to bring justice within the reach of the\r\npoor he was an impassioned advocate from the very first. When a police\r\nmagistrate expressed views of which he disapproved he did not hesitate\r\nto describe him as \"an insufferably ignorant, and therefore insolent,\r\nmagisterial cur\"! That was in 1841. Four years later _Punch_\r\nvociferously applauds a courageous magistrate who committed a\r\n\"gentleman\" to the House of Correction for a brutal assault, and\r\nwelcomes a revolt against harsh sentences in the action of the Recorder\r\nat the Central Criminal Court, who in 1847 refused to send a boy of\r\ntwelve to prison for stealing £4 12s. from his master \"because if he\r\nwent to prison he might become an expert thief.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A Plot Against Prisons_]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1853 _Punch_ discussed at length, under the title of \"A Plot\r\nagainst Prisons,\" and in the ironical vein which frequently exposed him\r\nto misconception by his prosaic readers, \"a dangerous conspiracy\r\norganized for the purpose of defrauding the gallows and the hulks,\" and\r\ninitiated by one of the noblest of many noble Quaker philanthropists:--\r\n\r\n    The originator of the plot is one Joseph Sturge, who has founded an\r\n    establishment, called the Reformatory Institution, in Birmingham,\r\n    and placed it under the superintendence of another man named Ellis,\r\n    who formerly presided over a similar concern in London, being a\r\n    place of resort for young thieves, where they were inveigled, and\r\n    seduced into the abandonment of their dishonest calling. To this\r\n    end no pains were spared to render the paths of virtue seductive,\r\n    by blending as much amusement as possible with the particular\r\n    branch of industry the lads were instructed in. The man Ellis,\r\n    their enticer from the line of turpitude, is a shoemaker. He says\r\n    in his evidence, reported by the House of Commons:\r\n\r\n    \"I used to go and sit with them for two or three hours a day, and I\r\n    used to tell them that they might, by governing their tongues,\r\n    their tempers and their appetites, and governing themselves\r\n    generally, be much more happy if they would put themselves in\r\n    harmony with the laws of their own physical nature; and I showed\r\n    them how wrong it was to break the social laws that bind society\r\n    together, and also the laws of God, and so forth. I considered that\r\n    my conversation with them for two or three hours had had a great\r\n    effect; and I provided them with wholesome food, and I gave them\r\n    clothes to wear, and I surrounded them with as many comforts as I\r\n    possibly could.\"\r\n\r\n    The Birmingham Institution, under the same management, has also\r\n    succeeded to such an extent that it is in contemplation to\r\n    establish another there on a larger scale; which, no doubt, will\r\n    most seriously tend to impair the utility of those magnificent\r\n    edifices, our gaols and bridewells, which everywhere afford such\r\n    vast but by no means empty accommodation. A meeting has been held,\r\n    Lord Calthorpe in the chair, to carry out the desired object, which\r\n    will tend to throw so many turnkeys out of employment, and to which\r\n    all persons are asked to subscribe who desire to rob Jack Ketch of\r\n    his livelihood, and the Government of convict labour, by\r\n    substituting prevention for cure--superseding prison discipline by\r\n    reformation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _High Life Below Stairs_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SERVANTGALISM\r\n\r\nCOOK: \"Well, to be sure, Mum! Last place I were in Missis always knocked\r\nat the door afore she come into the kitchen!!\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COACHMAN: \"Why--what's the matter, John Thomas?\"\r\n\r\nFOOTMAN: \"Matter enuff! Here's the marchioness bin and giv me notice\r\nbecause I don't match Joseph, an' I must go, unless I can get my fat\r\ndown in a week!\"]\r\n\r\nThe relations of masters, mistresses and servants is a never ending\r\ntheme in the pages of _Punch_. His attitude was governed by the broad\r\nprinciples that the labourer was worthy of his hire, and that those who\r\noffered inadequate wages must expect neither character nor efficiency.\r\nBut he draws a clear distinction between the domestic slave and the\r\nflunkey, holding that snobbery in employers was the chief cause of its\r\nprevalence amongst highly paid servants. _Punch_ was the champion of the\r\n\"slavey\"--immortalized in Dickens's \"Marchioness\"--even of the\r\nmuch-maligned charwoman; the relentless critic of Jeames, his plush and\r\npowder and calves. As early as 1847 we find him supporting a reversal of\r\nthe old régime: the mistress must be approved by the servant, and\r\nfurnish a satisfactory character. The plea is not surprising, when\r\nadvertisements for a kitchen-maid, \"wages £3 a year,\" appeared in a\r\nfashionable paper and earned _Punch's_ satire. Contrariwise, he never\r\nspares the arrogance of \"servantgalism\" the assumption of \"my lady the\r\nhousemaid.\" In this spirit _Punch_ makes game of a school for servants\r\nat Bristol, where lessons on the pianoforte were given, but if servant\r\ngirls and nurses were neglectful of their duties and their infant\r\ncharges, mistresses were equally to blame for their indolence and\r\ndisregard of parental responsibilities. But the keenest arrows in\r\n_Punch's_ quiver were reserved for \"Jeames.\" He quotes from the columns\r\nof _The Times_ the advertisements of a footman, \"tall, handsome, with\r\nbroad shoulders and extensive calves,\" who \"prefers Belgravia or the\r\nNorth Side of the Park,\" while a little later on another of this type\r\ninsists on \"six months a year in town, and if in an unfashionable\r\nneighbourhood, five guineas extra salary.\" If I refrain from quoting\r\nfrom Thackeray's constant variations on this theme in the pages of\r\n_Punch_, it is only because they are so familiar to readers of his\r\ncollected works. The etiquette of flunkeydom was peculiar. These\r\ngorgeous and pampered menials had their grievances; they were \"expected\r\nto sit in church in a position from which the clergyman could neither be\r\nseen nor heard,\" as _Punch_ put it in 1851. Liveried servants were not\r\nallowed in Rawstorne Street Chapel, Brompton, in 1846, and a protest was\r\nmade in the Press that at St. George's, Hanover Square, \"the real\r\naristocracy of the land are separated from their liveried domestics by a\r\nmere oak panelling.\" But in this war on flunkeyism \"Jeames\" was not the\r\nreal enemy; it was rather the genius of snobbery which _Punch_\r\nimpersonated in \"Jenkins\" of the _Morning Post_ (or _Morning Plush_, as\r\nhe called it), whose fulsome and lyrical rhapsodies are held up to\r\nridicule in number after number. In this context two extracts may\r\nsuffice, from an account of the galaxy of rank and fashion at the Opera\r\nwhich appeared in the _Morning Post_:\r\n\r\n    It is, above all, necessary that the middle classes and the poor\r\n    should see and feel that if the aristocracy has the monopoly of\r\n    titles and the lion's share of the dignities and offices of the\r\n    State, instead of hoarding, it nobly expends its revenues in those\r\n    luxuries which emanate from the ingenuity and labour of the\r\n    industrious.\r\n\r\nAnd again--the italics and capitals are _Punch's_:--\r\n\r\n    Ever since the Italian lyrical drama crossed the Alps in the suites\r\n    of the tasteful Medicis, its vogue has daily increased, it has\r\n    become a ruling passion--it is the quintessence of all civilized\r\n    pleasures; and wherever its principal virtuosi hoist their\r\n    standard, there for the time is the CAPITAL OF EUROPE, where the\r\n    most illustrious, noble, elegant and tasteful members of society\r\n    assemble.\r\n\r\n    These _ornaments of society_ are in general absent at the too early\r\n    opening of Her Majesty's Theatre; but on Saturday, as we surveyed\r\n    the house previous to the overture, most of those who _constitute\r\n    society_ in England--those whom we _respect, esteem or\r\n    love_--rapidly filled the house.\r\n\r\n    Every seat in every part of it was occupied, and if _those\r\n    objectionable spectators were there_--those gentlemen of ambiguous\r\n    gentility, the fashionable couriers, valets, _tailors_ and\r\n    _shoemakers_, who obtain admission to the pit on the strength of\r\n    knowing the measure of some actor or actress's foot--_they and\r\n    their frowsy dames_ were so nailed _to their benches as not to\r\n    offend the eye_.\r\n\r\nThese effusions, and others equally unbridled in their assertion of the\r\ndivinity of kings and coronets, prompted _Punch_ to adorn \"Jenkins\" with\r\nthe _alias_ of Lickspittleoff. It was not a nice name, but _Punch_ might\r\nhave retorted _tâchez de ne pas le mériter_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Underpaid Governess_]\r\n\r\nFrom servants to governesses the transition in those days was only too\r\neasy. _Punch's_ study of the advertisements in this branch of the \"slave\r\nmarket\" began early, and let us hope to good purpose, though as I write\r\nthe comparative rates of remuneration for cooks and teachers are still\r\nopen to criticism. In the autumn of 1843, commenting on an advertisement\r\nin _The Times_, in which \"S. S.\" offered a salary of £2 a month to \"a\r\nmorning daily governess of ladylike manners for three or four young\r\nfemale pupils, capable of imparting a sound English education, with\r\nFrench, music and singing, dancing and drawing, unassisted by masters,\"\r\n_Punch_ observes:--\r\n\r\n    How very much would it surprise the race of S.S.'s; what a look of\r\n    offended virtue would they put on were somebody to exclaim to them,\r\n    \"It is such as you who help to fill our streets, and throng the\r\n    saloons of our theatres; it is such as you who make the Magdalen\r\n    indispensable.\" We have recently read the statistics of insanity,\r\n    and have found governesses to be in a frightful disproportion to\r\n    other educated classes. Can this be wondered at when we read such\r\n    offers as those of S.S.?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Thomas gives warning because his master has given up\r\nreading prayers, and he can't bemean himself by \"sayin' 'Amen' to a\r\ngoverness.\"]\r\n\r\nThe terms of £2 a month were, however, liberal compared with those\r\noffered by other employers. An assistant in a ladies' school was\r\nexpected to teach English, French and music for £1 a quarter, while not\r\nat all infrequently the offer of board and lodging was regarded as an\r\nexcuse for dispensing with a salary altogether. In dealing with the\r\nproblem of these \"Sisters of Misery,\" _Punch_ waxes ironical on the\r\nresults of their improvidence:--\r\n\r\n    If in the course of ten years, with a salary of, let us say, twenty\r\n    pounds a year, out of which she has only to buy clothes fit to keep\r\n    company with the children, the governess has not saved a\r\n    sufficiency for her declining age, it is but too painful to know\r\n    that she must have been a very profuse, improvident person. And\r\n    yet, I fear me, there are lamentable instances of such\r\n    indiscretion. I myself, at this moment, know a spendthrift creature\r\n    who, as I have heard, in her prime--that is, for the ten\r\n    years--lived in one family. Two of her pupils are now countesses.\r\n    Well, she had saved next to nothing, and when discharged she sank\r\n    lower and lower as a daily governess, and at length absolutely\r\n    taught French, Italian, and the harp to the daughters of small\r\n    tradesmen at eighteenpence a lesson. In time she, of course, got\r\n    too old for this. She now lives somewhere at Camberwell, and though\r\n    sand-blind, keeps a sixpenny school for little boys and girls of\r\n    the lower orders. With this, and the profits on her cakes, she\r\n    continues to eke out a miserable existence--a sad example, if they\r\n    would only be warned, to improvident governesses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A Real Dotheboys Hall_]\r\n\r\n_Punch's_ attentive study of the curiosities of literature in\r\nadvertisements relating to education continued for many years. A batch\r\nof them extracted from _The Times_ appears in the issue of August 14,\r\n1853, and pillories the meanness of ladies who wished to secure\r\ngovernesses without salaries, or, as an alternative, to turn their\r\nhouses into boarding schools and get assistants without paying for them.\r\nAlready, some three weeks earlier, _Punch_ had quoted from _The Times_\r\nthe advertisement of an academy for young gentlemen near Richmond, in\r\nYorkshire, where youths were \"boarded, furnished with books, and\r\ninstructed in whatever their future prospects might require for twenty\r\nand twenty-two guineas a year. No vacations unless desired.\" On this\r\n\"Dotheboys Hall\" in real life _Punch_ observes that while such a price\r\nfor a year's food for mind and body is a miracle of cheapness, \"the age\r\nof miracles has passed, and especially--after the publication of\r\n_Nicholas Nickleby_--of such miracles as this.\" Yet an advertisement of\r\na school in Essex on almost precisely similar lines survived for at\r\nleast forty years after _Punch's_ protest, as the present writer can\r\ntestify. Nor were the claims of the underpaid official forgotten. In his\r\n\"Penny Post Medal\" _Punch_ endeavoured to illustrate the triumph of\r\nRowland Hill, and waxed lyrical over his achievement, indignant over his\r\ntreatment:--\r\n\r\n    Beautiful, much more beautiful, to the eye of the philosopher\r\n    _Punch_, is the red coat of the Postman with his bundle of penny\r\n    missives than the scarlet coat of the Life Guardsman! For the\r\n    Postman is the soldier of peace--the humanizing, benevolent\r\n    distributor of records of hopes, affections, tenderest\r\n    associations. He is the philanthropic go-between--the cheap and\r\n    constant communicant betwixt man and man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROWLAND HILL'S TRIUMPHAL ENTRY INTO ST.\r\nMARTIN'S-LE-GRAND]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Rowland Hill's Reward_]\r\n\r\n    In the Penny Post Medal _Punch_ has endeavoured to show the triumph\r\n    of Rowland Hill--no Greek or Roman triumph e'er so great--carried\r\n    in well-earned glory into the Post-office, Saint Martin's-le-Grand.\r\n    If the beholder have any imagination, he will hear huzzaing\r\n    shouts--he will hear all the street-door knockers of the kingdom\r\n    for that moment instinct with joyous life, loudly knock, knock,\r\n    knocking in thundering accord. Such is the triumph of Rowland Hill.\r\n\r\n    Turn we to the Obverse. It shows an old story; old as the\r\n    ingratitude of man--old as the Old Serpent. Sir Robert Peel, the\r\n    Tory Minister, no sooner gets into place than, in reward for the\r\n    services of Mr. Rowland Hill, he turns him from the Post Office!\r\n    or as it is allegorically shown, he, as Britannia, presents him\r\n    with--the sack.\r\n\r\n    After this, a subscription is set afoot to which Sir Robert, with\r\n    Magdalen penitence, subscribes ten pounds! Ten Pounds! It must be\r\n    owned a very small plaister to heal so cruel a cut!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRITANNIA PRESENTING ROWLAND HILL WITH THE SACK]\r\n\r\nBut these beneficent \"red-coated genii\" were \"cruelly ill-paid\" for long\r\nand arduous labour. \"His walk in life is frequently such a walk that it\r\nis a wonder he has a leg to stand upon; for he travels some twenty or\r\nthirty miles a day, to the equal wear and tear of body and sole. For\r\nthis his salary is a guinea a week.\" Accordingly, when in 1848 Post\r\nOffice robberies were frequent, _Punch_, without excusing theft,\r\nregarded it as the natural result of this miserable pittance.\r\nUnder-payment has always been a great incentive to dishonesty, and in\r\n1848 we have _Punch's_ assurance that the postmen were the worst paid of\r\nall Government employees.\r\n\r\nThe long fight for early closing, for the Saturday half-holiday, and for\r\nreasonable Sunday recreation, found unflinching support in _Punch_ from\r\nhis earliest years. He did not, it is true, profess a burning sympathy\r\nwith the bank clerks in 1842 when they were agitating for a closure at 4\r\ninstead of 5 p.m., but he was wholeheartedly on the side of the shop\r\nassistants, especially in the linendrapers' and milliners'\r\nestablishments. One of his earliest incursions into this controversy\r\ntook the form of a report of an imaginary meeting of duchesses at\r\nAlmack's, at which resolutions were passed deprecating, in a contrite\r\nspirit, the overworking of milliners' assistants, and establishing an\r\nassociation to persuade dressmakers to reduce the hours of work to eight\r\na day, abolish Sunday work, afford reasonable time to execute orders,\r\nprovide medical advice and change of air for the sick, and start a fund\r\nto carry out these aims (May 27, 1843). These aims have long been\r\nrealized in all well-conducted shops, but they were something like\r\ncounsels of perfection in the year of \"The Song of the Shirt.\" But\r\n_Punch's_ irony at the expense of inconsiderate shoppers in \"Beauty and\r\nBusiness _versus_ Early Shops,\" and \"Directions to Ladies for Shopping,\"\r\nnot only tilts at femininity's little ways, but shows that human nature\r\nhas not materially changed in the last seventy-five years. _Punch_ was\r\nmoved by the hardships of dressmakers and shop-girls, whom he compared\r\nto convicts: \"hard labour\" was no worse than theirs. He frankly\r\nadvocated the boycotting of a money-grubbing hosier in Cheapside, who\r\nkept his shop open until nine or ten o'clock, though all the other\r\nhosiers in that thoroughfare had for two years closed theirs at\r\neight--for that was as far as early closing had reached in the 'fifties.\r\nBut _Punch_ was always a moderate reformer, very far from being a\r\nrevolutionary, and he condemned with great asperity an attempt to launch\r\nan experiment mildly foreshadowing modern syndicalism:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Syndicalism in the 'Forties_]\r\n\r\n    Notwithstanding our desire to aid the assistant drapers in any\r\n    reasonable movement, we cannot encourage them in the foolery which,\r\n    according to a prospectus of the Metropolitan Assistant Drapers'\r\n    Company, they seem to contemplate. They are coolly asking the\r\n    public for £150,000 in 15,000 shares of ten pounds each, to start a\r\n    model establishment, in which the assistants shall be their own\r\n    masters, choose their own work, take their own time, and seize\r\n    \"every opportunity for indulging in all healthy pursuits and\r\n    reasonable enjoyments.\" The prospectus then goes on to state, that\r\n    the assistants will become \"free and happy, as they should be.\" If\r\n    a linendraper's shop is to be turned into a state of \"freedom and\r\n    happiness\" all day long, it may suit the shop-boys well enough, but\r\n    it will not be quite so agreeable to the customers.\r\n\r\nHolding it to be his duty \"to smash humbug of every description,\"\r\n_Punch_, after an examination of the financial proposals of the \"free\r\nand happy\" linendrapers, pronounces them guilty of very gross humbug in\r\nputting forward their prospectus. The control of industry by the workers\r\nformed no part of his schemes for bettering their condition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A View in Hyde Park, showing the proposed site for the\r\nExhibition of Industry.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPECIMEN OF MR PUNCH'S INDUSTRIAL EXHIBITION OF 1850 (TO\r\nBE IMPROVED IN 1851)]\r\n\r\nIn the period under review Sunday was, speaking broadly, the only\r\nholiday of the working classes. _Punch's_ views on their recreations,\r\ntherefore, were necessarily governed by his views on Sunday observance,\r\nSunday trading and Sabbatarianism generally. Let it be noted at the\r\noutset that he was no advocate of the Continental Sunday: he was all for\r\nkeeping Sunday quiet, even dull. But against any legal or other\r\nrestrictions, which thwarted poor people's innocent enjoyment and\r\nrecreation, he ranged himself as an uncompromising adversary. As we have\r\nseen, he indignantly resented the fining of boys for playing cricket, or\r\nchildren for selling sweets, on Sunday. He supported the opening of\r\nmuseums and picture galleries on Sundays as early as August, 1842, and,\r\nin recording the defeat of the motion in the Commons, ends his comments\r\non \"The Pharisees' Sunday\" with the remark: \"The Museum and the National\r\nGallery are, for the present, closed on Sundays; so for a time there are\r\nleft for the people--the Eagle Tavern and the Red House at Battersea.\"\r\n_Punch_ vehemently assailed the snobbery which sought to exclude working\r\nmen and poor children from the parks. He welcomed the opening of the\r\nZoological Gardens to the public in 1848 at a low charge, without a\r\n\"Fellow's order,\" _plus_ a shilling. But of all the movements which\r\ninspired him with hope for the future, none offered brighter prospects\r\nthan the great Exhibition of 1851. It was Douglas Jerrold who coined the\r\nname of the \"Crystal Palace.\" _Punch_ had some misgivings as to the\r\nencroachment of the buildings on public amenities and rights, and warmly\r\nespoused the cause of Ann Hicks, whose family for 118 years had held\r\npossession of an apple stall in Hyde Park. Her grandfather, it was\r\nalleged, had saved George II from drowning in the Serpentine! The stall\r\nwas removed and Ann Hicks allowed five shillings a week for one year,\r\nbut, largely owing to _Punch's_ intervention, was assisted to emigrate\r\nto Australia. And _Punch_ was indignant at the suggested exclusion of\r\nthe public on the opening day, May 1, 1851, for fear of annoying the\r\nRoyal family. But these misgivings were happily removed, and the opening\r\nof the Exhibition marked a turning point in the long campaign of\r\ncriticism, frank to the verge of discourtesy and indecorum, sometimes\r\njustified, but often malicious, which _Punch_ had conducted against\r\nthe Court in general and the Prince Consort in particular. He made the\r\n_amende_ handsomely in his \"own report of the opening of the great\r\nExhibition\":--\r\n\r\n    At length a cheer without, and a flourish of trumpets within,\r\n    announce the arrival of the Queen--and the Prince, who, by the idea\r\n    of this Exhibition, has given to Royal Consortship a new glory, or,\r\n    rather, has rendered for ever illustrious, in his own case, a\r\n    position too often vibrating between the mischievous and the\r\n    insignificant. Prince Albert has done a great service to humanity,\r\n    and earned imperishable fame for himself by an idea, the greatness\r\n    of which, instead of becoming less, will appear still greater as it\r\n    recedes from us.... Beyond comparison, the most gratifying incident\r\n    of the day was the promenade of the Queen and Prince, holding by\r\n    the hand their two eldest children, through the whole of the lower\r\n    range of the building. It was a magnificent lesson for\r\n    foreigners--and especially for the Prussian princes, who cannot\r\n    stir abroad without an armed escort--to see how securely and\r\n    confidently a young female Sovereign and her family could walk in\r\n    the closest possible contact, near enough to be touched by almost\r\n    everyone, with five-and-twenty thousand people, selected from no\r\n    class, and requiring only the sum of forty-two shillings as a\r\n    qualification for the nearest proximity with royalty. Here was a\r\n    splendid example of that real freedom on the one hand, and perfect\r\n    security on the other, which are the result of our constitutional\r\n    monarchy, and which all the despotism and republicanism of the\r\n    world cannot obtain elsewhere, let them go on as long as they may,\r\n    executing each other in the name of order, or cutting each other's\r\n    throats in the name of liberty.\r\n\r\n    The only blot, as we thought, upon the whole proceedings were the\r\n    unnatural and crab-like movements of one of our wealthiest peers,\r\n    the Marquess of Westminster, and his fellow-official, the Lord\r\n    Chamberlain, whose part in the pageant consisted of the difficult,\r\n    but not very dignified, feat of walking backwards during the\r\n    progress of the procession. We hope the time is not far distant\r\n    when, among the other sensible arrangements of the present reign, a\r\n    wealthy nobleman may be released from the humiliation of having to\r\n    perform before the Sovereign and the public a series of awkward\r\n    evolutions, which not all the skill of the posture-master can\r\n    redeem from the absurdity attaching to the contortions of the\r\n    mountebank.\r\n\r\n_Punch_ could not resist having a dig at the aristocrat courtiers, but\r\nhe had nothing but praise for the Queen and the Prince Consort, and\r\nespecially for their practice of visiting the Exhibition on the\r\n\"shilling days.\" As he put it in the lines \"Victoria Felix\",:--\r\n\r\n    Heaven's duteous sunshine waits upon her going,\r\n      And with it blends a sunshine brighter still--\r\n    The loyal love of a great people, knowing\r\n    That building up is better than o'erthrowing;\r\n      That freedom lies in taming of self-will.\r\n\r\n_Punch's_ loyalty to the Sovereign, however, did not cause him to forget\r\nthe workers. He suggests to Prince Albert that a dinner should be given\r\nto the workmen who erected the building. As for Paxton, the architect,\r\n_Punch_ agreed with the _Examiner_ that a knighthood was not a\r\nsufficient reward for his services, and suggested that he should be\r\ngiven a share of the profits. But _Punch_ was from the first concerned\r\nwith the future of the building; with the possibilities of transforming\r\nit into a permanent People's Palace. So when Paxton asked \"What is to\r\nbecome of the Crystal Palace?\" and answered his own question by saying\r\n\"Let the Crystal Palace become a winter park under glass,\" with rare\r\nflowers and plants and a colossal aviary, _Punch_ voted the suggestion\r\nof the Crystal Magician \"delightful and practicable,\" for, as he notes,\r\non the testimony of \"the princely Devonshire, Mr. Paxton never failed in\r\nanything he undertook.\" Nay, _Punch_ went so far as to depict, in a\r\ncartoon, John Bull contemplating the marvels of the winter garden. The\r\nscheme lapsed, and in the spring of 1852 _Punch_ was indignant at the\r\nimminent sale of the Crystal Palace, and lavish of gibes at the \"nobs\r\nand snobs\" who despised the masses:--\r\n\r\nTHE PEOPLE AND THEIR PALACE\r\n\r\n    The People! I weally am sick of the wawd:\r\n    The People is ugly, unpleasant, absawd;\r\n    Wha-evaw they go, it is always the case,\r\n    They are shaw to destwoy all the chawm of the place.\r\n\r\n    They are all vewy well in their own pwopa spheeaw,\r\n    A long distance off; but I don't like them neeaw;\r\n    The slams is the place faw a popula show;\r\n    Don't encouwage the People to spoil Wotten Wow.\r\n\r\n    It is odd that the Duke of Awgyll could pasue\r\n    So eccentric a cawse, and Lad Shaftesbuwy too,\r\n    As to twy and pwesawve the Glass House on its site,\r\n    Faw no weason on awth but the People's delight.\r\n\r\nThe Queen, in an excellent parody of \"The May Queen,\" is credited with\r\nthe desire to keep up the Palace; _Punch_ threw all his weight on the\r\nside of Paxton in his efforts to defeat the obstructives, and when, in\r\nJune, 1852, the move to Sydenham was finally decided on, he prophesied a\r\ngreat future for that favoured suburb. The \"christening\" took place in\r\nAugust, and furnished _Punch_ with an opportunity for answering the\r\nreproach that \"the English don't know how to amuse themselves\":--\r\n\r\n    The great cause of Peace had every fitting honour paid to it on\r\n    Thursday last at Sydenham. In its train followed some of the\r\n    greatest celebrities of the day, all children of the people, who\r\n    had come to assist at the christening of their new Palace. The Arts\r\n    and Sciences, of course, were there, and gave the cause their\r\n    blessing, until such time when they could give it something, if not\r\n    more pure, at least more tangible. Literature, too, was there, and\r\n    promised to devote its best pen to the service of the new\r\n    principle, and Trade and Commerce had already sent off their ships\r\n    to collect treasure to pour into the lap of their beautiful, but\r\n    too long neglected child, as soon as the Palace was in a fit state\r\n    to receive them. And the Poor advanced, and, opening their hearts,\r\n    gave the cause their best wishes--and these were deposited with the\r\n    coins of the realm, and are to form the foundation of the new\r\n    building. Never was Palace begun upon so strong a foundation\r\n    before!\r\n\r\n    If only half the promises are fulfilled that were made at its\r\n    christening, this Palace of the People will be the grandest palace\r\n    ever constructed. And, in truth, it should be so! The people have\r\n    built palaces sufficiently for others; it is but proper now they\r\n    built one for themselves.\r\n\r\n    And when it is built it will be time enough to inquire if\r\n    Englishmen know how to amuse themselves. They have had hitherto so\r\n    few opportunities of learning, that it is ungracious to ask at\r\n    present. In the meantime we wish them every enjoyment in their new\r\n    playground at Sydenham. It will be the most beautiful playground in\r\n    the world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Sabbatarian Solicitude_]\r\n\r\n    _Punch's_ generous anticipations, in part illusory, were mingled\r\n    with wrath against militant Sabbatarians, over-zealous for the\r\n    souls of their fellow-creatures. A deputation, headed by the\r\n    Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishops of London and Winchester, and\r\n    the Earl of Shaftesbury, lost no time in waiting on Lord Derby, in\r\n    order to urge upon the Prime Minister \"the expediency of adopting\r\n    measures to prevent the Crystal Palace, or its grounds, being\r\n    opened to the public on Sundays.\" _Punch_ is bitterly sarcastic\r\n    against this condescending solicitude on the part of peers and\r\n    prelates for the spiritual welfare of the vulgar cockneys, snips,\r\n    snobs, mechanics, shopmen, and their womenkind; creatures that not\r\n    only consume tea and shrimps, periwinkles, and ginger-beer, but\r\n    also smoke pipes and penny Pickwicks! The people must feel\r\n    flattered that they are thus, sympathized with by the superior\r\n    classes; only perhaps they would rather the sympathy were shown\r\n    otherwise than by excluding them from pure air and enjoyment--in\r\n    great tenderness for their immortal part, but with small\r\n    consideration for their perishable lungs.\r\n\r\nBut the attack was not solely based on religious grounds. The _Morning\r\nHerald_ scented revolution in the proposal, and _Punch_ was moved to\r\naddress an ironical warning to the Home Secretary:--\r\n\r\n    A word in your ear, Mr. Walpole. There is treason, hydra-headed\r\n    treason hatching. Now, we are not joking. Were we inclined to be\r\n    droll, we would not cast our jokes before certain Home Secretaries.\r\n    Hush! This way. In a corner, if you please.\r\n\r\n    Do you ever see the _Morning Herald_? We thought so. Somehow, you\r\n    look as if you did. Still, we have brought a copy. Here it is. A\r\n    leader on the treasonous atrocities contemplated by the traitorous\r\n    projectors of the Crystal Palace in Penge Park! We will read\r\n    you--when we can get a good mouthful of breath--a few of the lines:\r\n    the dreadful lines. You see, the Palace is to be open on Sundays\r\n    after one o'clock. In that fact the _Herald_ sees revolution,\r\n    anarchy, and perhaps--a future republic with John Cromwell Bright\r\n    in Buckingham Palace! Listen:\r\n\r\n    \"'Go to mass on the Sabbath morning' is the Church of Rome's\r\n    command; 'then go to the park, the ball, or the theatre.' That is\r\n    the Sabbath of Paris, of Munich, of Vienna, and, we are sorry to\r\n    say, of Berlin also. And, as _one natural result_, a single month,\r\n    in 1848, saw the Sovereigns of Paris, of Vienna, of Munich, and of\r\n    Berlin _fugitives before their rebellious subjects_. The people of\r\n    England remained untouched by this sudden madness; they were loyal\r\n    to their Queen, _because_ they feared their God!\"\r\n\r\n    You will perceive, Right Honourable Sir, that had the Palace\r\n    existed in Penge Park in 1848, the British Throne would have gone\r\n    to bits like a smashed decanter. The Queen has only continued to\r\n    reign _because_ there has been no People's Palace!\r\n\r\n    We see, Sir, you are moved, but let us go on.\r\n\r\n    \"The Crystal Palace will be the main engine for introducing the\r\n    Continental Sabbath among us. The people may go to church, it will\r\n    be said, and _then_ they may go down to Sydenham and enjoy a walk\r\n    in the Crystal Palace, and what harm can _that_ do? Just all the\r\n    harm in the world. Open and naked profaneness would shock most\r\n    persons, but this mixture of religion and dissipation will ruin\r\n    myriads!\"\r\n\r\n_Punch_, on the contrary, believed that, in spite of the fulminations of\r\nExeter Hall, the Crystal Palace, with its art treasures, and the setting\r\nprovided by the wonder-working Paxton, would become the People's Sunday\r\nSchool, and a monster extinguisher of gin palaces. So we find him\r\nprinting a mock protest from publicans against the desecration of the\r\nSabbath by the proposed opening of the Crystal Palace after morning\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n_Punch's_ views on temperance were eminently moderate. It is true that\r\nin one of his early numbers he had depicted, in the cartoons of \"The Gin\r\nDrop\" and \"The Water Drop,\" the horrors of drunkenness in the vein of\r\nCruickshank; true also that he expressed admiration for the crusade of\r\nFather Mathew. He condemned excess, but he was no enemy of conviviality.\r\nIndeed he was up in arms against those who sought to \"rob a poor man of\r\nhis beer.\" In his view the best antidotes to intemperance were to be\r\nfound in recreation and education, and in using Sunday to promote those\r\nends. He severely criticised in the autumn of 1845 the provisions of the\r\nnew Beer Bill, which prevented excursionists from obtaining needful\r\nrefreshment at an inn, not only at unreasonable, but at reasonable\r\nhours, and protested against the closing of these hospitable portals\r\nagainst them on Sunday, \"and perhaps very soon on every other day, if\r\ngentlemen, who can go to clubs, as well as to church, being blest with\r\naffluence, and, therefore, belonging to the better classes, continue to\r\nlegislate in their present spirit for himself (the excursionist) and the\r\nrest of the worse--that is the worse off.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Punch at the Palace_]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Crystal Palace had been opened by the Queen on Saturday,\r\nJune 10, 1854. _Punch_ describes the imaginary visit which he paid a few\r\ndays earlier to inspect the building and, by special command of the\r\nQueen, to report as to its probable readiness for her reception on the\r\nopening day. After being conducted through the building by Sir Joseph\r\nPaxton, he explained that it was not his intention to be present at the\r\ninaugural ceremony:--\r\n\r\n    He was the godfather of the edifice, having originally invented and\r\n    conferred upon it the title of the Crystal Palace; but he should\r\n    leave to his friend the Archbishop the entire solemnities of the\r\n    day, including an announcement which Dr. Sumner had most kindly\r\n    undertaken to make, namely, that at the special instance of the\r\n    Queen, arrangements would be at once effected for opening the\r\n    Palace on Sundays.\r\n\r\nFact is tempered with fancy in this account, as well as in his\r\noptimistic report of the meeting of Crystal Palace shareholders; it\r\ncharacterizes, too, the series of humorous handbooks to the Crystal\r\nPalace, which appeared in the pages of _Punch_ in the following months.\r\nBut we find in the remarks put into the mouth of Mr. Laing, the\r\nchairman, a very good summary of his own views:--\r\n\r\n    On reflection it had been thought better that men, under the\r\n    crystal roof, should temperately refresh themselves--all mutually\r\n    sustaining one another even by their own self-respect of the\r\n    decencies of life, there and then in their own Crystal Palace--than\r\n    that, turned away hungering and athirst, they should be absorbed in\r\n    the holes and corners of surrounding public-houses.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent history of the Crystal Palace hardly fulfilled _Punch's_\r\nsanguine expectations of its future as a great people's playground and\r\nschool. Intermittently it fulfilled this function, but as an educational\r\ninstitution it served the needs of the suburban residents rather than\r\nthose of the great public; its entertainments were in the main supported\r\nby the patronage of the middle and well-to-do classes. As years went on\r\nthe Crystal Palace, owing to its distance from London, suffered\r\nseriously from the competition of the series of exhibitions at Earl's\r\nCourt. Yet one who is old enough, as the present writer is, to remember\r\nvisits in his school days in the early 'seventies--recurrent Handel\r\nfestivals from the days when Costa was conductor and Patti was in her\r\ngolden prime; flower and dog and cat shows; the glory of the\r\nrhododendron shrubberies; pantomimes and firework displays; and, above\r\nall, the admirable Saturday concerts, which drew musical London for some\r\nforty years--such a one, and there must be many like him, will always\r\nlook back on the Crystal Palace with grateful affection, and hold in\r\nreverence the names of Paxton and Ferguson, George Grove and August\r\nManns, and many other good men and true who laboured to realize\r\n_Punch's_ ideal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARTISM\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Fight for Cheap Bread_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NOT SO VERY UNREASONABLE! EH?\r\n\r\nJOHN: \"My Mistress says she hopes you won't call a meeting of her\r\ncreditors; but if you will leave your Bill in the usual way, it shall be\r\nproperly attended to.\"]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that _Punch_ did not belittle the Chartist movement, but\r\nadmitted the evils, political, social, and economic, out of which it\r\nsprang. So did some of the leaders of the Young England group (see\r\n_Sybil_), but _Punch_ ridiculed their remedies. He was out of touch\r\nalike with Whigs, Tories, and Churchmen, especially the Tractarians, who\r\ndenounced the men who tempted the people to rail against their rulers\r\nand superiors.\r\n\r\n_Punch_, too, did a good deal in this line. But\r\nwhile he recognized the sincerity and earnestness of Chartism, he\r\ndistrusted the methods of the extremists, and his distrust was largely\r\njustified by the history of the movement. The cleavage between the\r\nadvocates of moral and physical force showed itself from the very\r\nbeginning, and the fiasco of 1848 was largely due to the fact that the\r\nleading spirits of Chartism had already declared themselves against it,\r\nor actually withdrawn from the movement. Of the famous Six Points of the\r\nPeople's Charter of 1838, three have been conceded--No Property\r\nQualifications, Vote by Ballot, and Payment of Members--and we have come\r\nvery near the realization of Universal Suffrage and Equal\r\nRepresentation. The demand for Annual Parliaments alone remains\r\nunsatisfied. Yet Lovett, who drafted the Charter, and was imprisoned in\r\n1839 with other Chartist leaders after the riots in Birmingham, emerged\r\nfrom gaol more than ever an advocate of moral force, joined Sturge in\r\nhis efforts to reconcile the Chartists and the middle class reformers,\r\nand after 1842 took no further part in the Chartist movement. In the\r\nyears of riots and fires and strikes and starvation that followed the\r\nrejection of the second National Petition in 1842, the leaders were,\r\nwith few exceptions, engulfed in a tide which they were unable to\r\ncontrol. Feargus O'Connor was one of the exceptions, but his success in\r\ninducing the Chartists to repudiate the Corn Law Repeal agitation, and\r\nthe disastrous failure of his agrarian scheme at Watford, alienated many\r\nof the old Chartists. Ebenezer Elliott, the Corn Law rhymer, withdrew\r\nfrom the movement, which he had actively supported, in order to devote\r\nall his energies to the repeal of the hated \"bread tax,\" and happily\r\nlived long enough to see it abolished. _Punch_, who had pronounced its\r\ndirge in February, 1849, with the legend \"obiit. February 1, 1849, aged\r\n34,\" was heart and soul with the Corn Law rhymer. Repeal of the Corn\r\nLaws was the deepest principle in his early life, and he was too angry\r\nto do justice to Peel, denouncing him as a \"political eel\"; an infringer\r\nof Dickens's copyright in Pecksniff; attacking his policy of \"wait\r\nawhile,\" much as later critics attacked the policy of \"wait and see\";\r\nand even when Peel's conversion was complete, refusing to acknowledge\r\nany virtue in it. When _Punch_ was bracketed with Peel as an opponent of\r\nthe Corn Laws he indignantly repudiated the association: _he_ at least\r\nhad never turned his coat. One cannot help feeling that remorse must\r\nhave mingled with admiration in his posthumous tributes to the statesman\r\n\"who gave the people bread.\" But there were no prickings of conscience\r\nin the welcome extended by him in 1850 to the proposal (realized in\r\n1854) to erect a statue to Ebenezer Elliott at Sheffield:--\r\n\r\n    The true-tempered men of Sheffield are about to do a new honour to\r\n    themselves by honouring the memory of Ebenezer Elliott, the man\r\n    whose wise pen drew up the indictment against that public robber,\r\n    Corn Law: and never was indictment better drawn for conviction,\r\n    though a rare success attended the novel deed, for it was only\r\n    worded with common words, the words themselves hot and glowing with\r\n    hate of wrong. Elliott struck from his subject--as the blacksmith\r\n    strikes from the red iron--sparkles[2] of burning light; and where\r\n    they fell they consumed. His homely indignation was sublimed by the\r\n    intensity of his honesty: if his words were homely, they were made\r\n    resistless by the inexorable purpose that uttered them. But the man\r\n    had the true heart and soul of the poet, and could love the simple\r\n    and beautiful as passionately as he denounced the selfish and the\r\n    mean.\r\n\r\n    The Corn-Law Rhymes did greatest service. They were the earliest\r\n    utterances of a people contending with a sense of inarticulate\r\n    suffering. They supplied the words; they gave a voice and meaning\r\n    to the labouring heart, and the true poet vindicated his fine\r\n    mission by making his spirit pass into the spirit of the many.\r\n\r\n    Time rolled on and Corn Law was condemned. The indictment drawn by\r\n    the poet was the draft afterwards improved; but Ebenezer Elliott\r\n    was the first drawer; and honoured be the men of Sheffield who seek\r\n    to do monumental homage to their patriotic poet! We have plenty of\r\n    modern statues to the sword, it is full time we had one to the pen.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Elliott himself said: \"My feelings have been hammered until\r\nthey have become _cold_--short, and are apt to snap and fly off in\r\nsarcasms\" (D.N.B. xvii., 267).]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Chartist movement, weakened by defections and dissensions,\r\nand by the dissipation of its energies on a mixed programme, which\r\nantagonized all classes, damped by the constant rains which fell at\r\nevery meeting and drenched the fires of revolution, was marching\r\nsteadily to disintegration. _Punch's_ distrust of the professional\r\nagitator is expressed in a bitter portrait published in the spring of\r\n1848:--\r\n\r\nTHE MODEL AGITATOR\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Professional Agitator_]\r\n\r\n    The only thing he flatters is the mob. Nothing is too sweet for\r\n    them; every word is a lump of sugar. He flatters their faults,\r\n    feeds their prejudices with the coarsest stimulants, and paints,\r\n    for their amusement, the blackest things white. He is madly cheered\r\n    in consequence. In time he grows into an idol. But cheers do not\r\n    pay, however loud. The most prolonged applause will not buy a\r\n    mutton chop. The hat is carried round, the pennies rain into it,\r\n    and the Agitator pours them into his patriotic pocket. It is\r\n    suddenly discovered that he has made some tremendous sacrifice for\r\n    the people. The public sympathy is first raised, then a\r\n    testimonial, then a subscription. He is grateful, and promises the\r\n    Millennium. The trade begins to answer, and he fairly opens shop as\r\n    a Licensed Agitator. He hires several journeymen with good lungs,\r\n    and sends agents--patriotic bagmen--round the country to sell his\r\n    praises and insults, the former for himself, and the latter for\r\n    everybody else. Every paper that speaks the truth of him is\r\n    publicly hooted at; everybody who opposes him is pelted with the\r\n    hardest words selected from the Slang Dictionary. A good grievance\r\n    is started, and hunted everywhere. People join in the cry, the\r\n    Agitator leading off and shouting the loudest. The grievance is\r\n    run off its legs; but another and another soon follows, till there\r\n    is a regular pack of them. The country is in a continual ferment,\r\n    and at last rises. Riots ensue; but the Model Agitator is the last\r\n    person to suffer from them. He excites the people to arm themselves\r\n    for the worst; but begs they will use no weapons. His talk is\r\n    incendiary, his advice nothing but gunpowder, and yet he hopes no\r\n    explosion will take place. He is an arsenal wishing to pass for a\r\n    chapel or a baby-linen warehouse. He is all peace, all love, and\r\n    yet his hearers grow furious as they listen to him, and rush out to\r\n    burn ricks and shoot landlords. He is always putting his head on\r\n    the block. Properly speaking he is beheaded once a quarter.\r\n\r\n    A monster meeting is his great joy, to be damped only by the rain\r\n    [the great open-air meetings of the Chartists were uniformly\r\n    unfortunate in their weather] or the police. He glories in a\r\n    prosecution. He likes to be prosecuted. He asks for it; shrieks out\r\n    to the Government, \"Why don't you prosecute me?\" and cries and gets\r\n    quite mad if they will not do it. The favour at length is granted.\r\n    He is thrown into prison and gets fat upon it; for from that moment\r\n    he is a martyr, and paid as one, accordingly.\r\n\r\n    The Model Agitator accumulates a handsome fortune, which he\r\n    bequeathes to his sons, with the following advice, which is a rich\r\n    legacy of itself: \"If you wish to succeed as an Agitator, you must\r\n    buy your patriotism in the cheapest market and sell it in the\r\n    dearest.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PUNCH'S MONUMENT TO PEEL]\r\n\r\nThe monster demonstration of 1848, as a recent writer[3] puts it, \"was\r\nthe funeral of Chartism with the Duke of Wellington as the Master of\r\nCeremonies.\" Hopes of a general rising had been kindled by the\r\nrevolution in Paris, but they were not fulfilled. The _annus mirabilis_\r\nwhich set thrones rocking on the Continent and toppled down that of\r\nLouis Philippe passed in the main peacefully in England. Feargus\r\nO'Connor's monster procession and petition on April 10 ended in fiasco,\r\nlargely owing to the precautions taken by the Duke of Wellington as\r\nCommander-in-Chief--the swearing in of 170,000 special constables\r\n(including Louis Napoleon!) and his wise decision to keep the troops as\r\nfar as possible out of sight. It is right to record the fact that\r\n_Punch_ was not moved by these events to desert his \"left-centre\"\r\nposition; that he advocated amnesty rather than reprisals. In September,\r\n1849, he published his special \"Chartist Petition to the Queen's Most\r\nExcellent Majesty\":--\r\n\r\nMAY IT PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY--\r\n\r\n    WHEREAS Death, the great Gaol-Deliverer, has by Cholera set free\r\n    from Westminster Prison, Joseph Williams and Alexander Sharpe,\r\n    foolish men, foolishly preaching the Charter, by means of pike and\r\n    blunderbuss--\r\n\r\n    _Punch_ humbly prays that your Majesty will, in this season of\r\n    political tranquillity, and of grave moral chastisement, give\r\n    orders for the release of certain misguided men, it is hoped better\r\n    instructed for the future--and thereupon pardon and set free\r\n    William Vernon, Ernest Jones, Little Cuffey, and other such\r\n    offenders, now made harmless by the common sense and common loyalty\r\n    of the English people.\r\n\r\n    And your Petitioner will ever Print and Pray--\r\n\r\n  PUNCH.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: C. R. Fay in \"Life and Labour in the Nineteenth Century,\"\r\np. 166.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPECIAL'S WIFE: \"Contrary to regulations, indeed!\r\nFiddlesticks! I must insist, Frederick, upon your taking this hot\r\nbrandy-and-water. I shall be having you laid up next, and not fit for\r\nanything.\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"_Little Cuffey_\"]\r\n\r\nErnest Jones was the young poet, a recent recruit of Feargus O'Connor,\r\nand Cuffey was the fiery little tailor for whom _Punch_ always had a\r\nsoft corner in his heart. When Sir George Grey announced that Cuffey had\r\nbeen included in the list of deported prisoners, amnestied on the\r\ndeclaration of peace after the Crimean War, _Punch_ expressed his\r\nsatisfaction at the release of the \"resolute, fire-eating but withal\r\nfrank-hearted and honest goose-hero of Chartism.\" But of much greater\r\nimportance and significance is the striking poem printed in the issue of\r\nJune 16, 1849, which may be taken as the best condensed summary of\r\n_Punch's_ political and social creed in a time of transition. The\r\noccasion was a speech of Lord John Russell in the House, declining to\r\nentertain proposals for an extension of the franchise. Lord John, it may\r\nbe recalled, was nicknamed \"Finality Jack\" for saying in a debate on the\r\nAddress in 1837 that it was impossible for him to take part in further\r\nmeasures of electoral reform. _Punch_ held that the collapse of the\r\nphysical force movement, so far from prompting a lethargic acquiescence\r\nin the existing régime, ought to stir men of good will to further\r\nefforts in order to remove legitimate grounds of discontent:--\r\n\r\nTHE TENTH OF APRIL TO LORD JOHN RUSSELL\r\n\r\n    My name, Lord John, is pleasant on many a noble tongue;\r\n    I've been bepuffed, bespeechified, bedined, bedrunk, besung;\r\n    Conservatism, Finality, Laissez-Faire and Statu Quo,\r\n    Are glad to shake hands with \"the Tenth,\" till very proud I grow.\r\n\r\n    At home, abroad, inside and out, you think you read me true,\r\n    But when did ever Whig know man's or people's heart all through?\r\n    I _am_ all that you style me, when your praise on me you pour;\r\n    All that, my Lord, but take my word, with that I'm something more.\r\n\r\n    I read your speech, the other night, when Hume, my stout old friend,\r\n    Asked of the House, as you did once, the suffrage to extend.\r\n    'Twas the use you then made of my name that hath these lines begot--\r\n    Hear what the Tenth of April is, and hear what it is not.\r\n\r\n    I am the friend of Order, but Statu Quo I loathe,\r\n    The Law I heed, but still would weed, and trim and guide its growth;\r\n    Finality, your present love, unlovely is to me;\r\n    That \"what is, is,\" proves not, I wis, that what is, ought to be.\r\n\r\n    \"Content\" you think I was, and so, noways for change athirst,\r\n    Content men are with second best, in preference to worst:\r\n    Content to hold up half a truth, when all truth shakes to fall;\r\n    Content with what gives half a loaf, against no bread at all!\r\n\r\n    But yet no ways content, Lord John, to see some things I see,\r\n    As a laughing House of Commons, and a helpless Ministry,\r\n    A nation little taught, a Church under-and overpaid,\r\n    And prone Respectability in Mammon-service laid.\r\n\r\n    Great towns o'erbrimming with their scum, great stews of plague\r\n      and sin;\r\n    Toil that should proudly bear itself, in grossness sunk and gin;\r\n    Crime stored away to ripen in settlement and gaol;\r\n    The rich for wealth, the poor for want, alike forpined and pale.\r\n\r\n    Then think, my Lord, and you, his friends, who deem those overbold,\r\n    That bid you move along the paths you entered on of old,\r\n    Think how delay may order with anarchy combine,\r\n    And to disaffection's vinegar turn loyalty's strong wine.\r\n\r\n    Mistake me not for what I'm not, know me for what I am,\r\n    The nursing mother of Reform, not Revolution's dam;\r\n    Mine is the spirit that erst reared our England's throne on law,\r\n    That never bore a lie it knew, or blinked a truth it saw.\r\n\r\n    Nations or men, we may not rest--look round on Europe's thrones\r\n    Shattered or shaken--hearken to her convulsive groans--\r\n    Ere you fool us with Finality, of all bad pleas the worst,\r\n    Think 'tis _the Tenth_ of April you invoke, and not _the First_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Reform or Revolution?_]\r\n\r\nThis may not be great poetry, but it is and remains sound political\r\nphilosophy, and an apologia for Chartism as interpreted by the saner and\r\nnobler spirits who took part in the movement, endeavoured to control it,\r\nand were in some instances engulfed in it. The Rebecca Riots in South\r\nWales in 1842-3 are little more than a name to most of the present\r\ngeneration. Few of those who connect them vaguely with resentment\r\nagainst the Turnpike Laws know that the name arose from the\r\nproclamations issued in the name of Rebecca, in allusion to the verse in\r\n_Genesis_ (xxiv. 60) in which it is promised to the wife of Isaac that\r\nher seed shall possess \"the gate of her enemies.\" Six years later there\r\nwere still 160 turnpikes in and about London, and _Punch_ declared that\r\nRebecca was needed to sweep them away. \"We laugh at the French for their\r\npassports; they may with equal justice laugh at us for our turnpikes. At\r\nall events the passports cost very little, whereas you cannot go three\r\nmiles out of London without dipping your hand into your pocket two or\r\nthree times.\"\r\n\r\nEmigration at this time was hailed by many, including _Punch_, as a\r\nremedy for existing discontent with conditions, and in the cartoon \"Here\r\nand There,\" and the verses \"Know'st Thou the Land where the Kangaroos\r\nBound?\" _Punch_ gives a roseate picture of Australia, \"deficient in\r\nmouths, overburdened with meat,\" and urges John Bull to help his paupers\r\nto go thither and live in plenty at high wages. A little time later the\r\nFemale Emigration Scheme, started by Sidney Herbert and other practical\r\nphilanthropists, furnished _Punch_ with a text for his oft-repeated\r\nsermon on the Two Nations. The writer was one of those who witnessed the\r\ndeparture of a party of thirty-eight women from Fenchurch Street station\r\nfor Gravesend, and thence to Australia, and after describing the group,\r\ntheir homely appearance and dress and manners, continues in a vein of\r\nself-reproach:--\r\n\r\n    What a confession it is that we have almost all been obliged to\r\n    make! A clear and earnest-minded writer gets a commission from the\r\n    _Morning Chronicle_ newspaper, and reports upon the state of our\r\n    poor in London; he goes amongst labouring people and poor of all\r\n    kinds--and brings back what? A picture of London life so wonderful,\r\n    so awful, so piteous and pathetic, so exciting and terrible, that\r\n    readers of romances own they never read anything like to it; and\r\n    that the griefs, struggles, strange adventures here depicted exceed\r\n    anything that any of us could imagine. Yes; and these wonders and\r\n    terrors have been lying by your door and mine ever since we had a\r\n    door of our own. We had but to go a hundred yards off and see, for\r\n    ourselves, but we never did. Don't we pay poor-rates, and are they\r\n    not heavy enough in the name of patience? Very true; and we have\r\n    our own private pensioners, and give away some of our superfluity\r\n    very likely. You are not unkind; not ungenerous. But of such\r\n    wondrous and complicated misery as this you confess you had no\r\n    idea. No. How should you? You and I--we are of the upper classes;\r\n    we have had hitherto no community with the poor. We never speak a\r\n    word to the servant who waits on us for twenty years; we condescend\r\n    to employ a tradesman, keeping him at a proper distance--mind, of\r\n    course, at a proper distance; we laugh at his young men if they\r\n    dance, jig and amuse themselves like their betters, and call them\r\n    counter-jumpers, snobs, and what not; of his workmen we know\r\n    nothing--how pitilessly they are ground down, how they live and\r\n    die, here close by us at the backs of our houses; until some poet\r\n    like Hood wakes and sings that dreadful _Song of the Shirt_; some\r\n    prophet like Carlyle rises up and denounces woe; some clear-sighted\r\n    energetic man like the writer of the _Chronicle_ travels into the\r\n    poor man's country for us, and comes back with his tale of terror\r\n    and wonder.\r\n\r\n    Awful, awful poor man's country! The bell rings and then\r\n    eight-and-thirty women bid adieu to it, rescued from it (as a few\r\n    more thousands will be) by some kind people who are interested in\r\n    their behalf. It is a solemn moment indeed--for those who (with\r\n    the few thousands who will follow them) are leaving this country\r\n    and escaping from the question between rich and poor; and what for\r\n    those who remain? But, at least, those who go will remember that in\r\n    their misery here they found gentle hearts to love and pity them,\r\n    and generous hands to give them succour, and will plant in the new\r\n    country their grateful tradition of the old. May Heaven's good\r\n    mercy speed them.\r\n\r\nEmigration was one of the contributory influences which helped to end\r\nthe hunger of the Hungry 'Forties. The repeal of the Corn Laws was a far\r\nmore powerful factor in the revival of prosperity, and the efforts of\r\nProtection to raise its diminished head met with consistent derision\r\nfrom _Punch_, who gloried in the statistics of increasing trade. But he\r\nwas no Benthamite, and one may search his files in vain for any\r\nrecognition of the salutary results of the new Poor Law. The famous\r\nreport of 1834 was drawn up by men who were largely inspired by the\r\ndoctrines of Bentham and Malthus, and their scientific principles were\r\nrepugnant to _Punch_. There is really not much to choose between his\r\ncriticisms and the hostility of the Chartists to the workhouses or\r\n\"Bastilles\" of the new system. In his zeal for pillorying instances of\r\nharsh administration he overlooked the real improvement effected in the\r\nAct of 1834 in the rural districts. But the new Poor Law, though it was\r\nfollowed by an immediate local re-absorption on a sounder economic basis\r\nof agricultural labour and a migration of the surplus elsewhither, was\r\nnot the sole cause of this improvement.[4] The demand for labour in the\r\nrapidly expanding industries of railway construction and coal mining was\r\nan even more potent instrument of relief. Coal, on which both industries\r\nequally depended and depend, may be now a tyrant, but it was in a sense\r\nthe good genius of the 'forties, though the high prices paid in London\r\nowing to extortionate tolls caused _Punch_ to denounce him as \"Cruel\r\nKing Coal\" from the point of view of the poor consumer.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: See C. R. Fay, \"Life and Labour in the Nineteenth Century,\"\r\np. 204.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Beginning of Better Times_]\r\n\r\nThe threat of revolution passed, but the diffusion of prosperity brought\r\nwith it, as it always does, further demands for increased wages. The\r\nyear 1853 was so notable for strikes that _Punch_, who had already\r\napplauded poor needlewomen for adopting this course, and suggested it to\r\npoor curates, felt obliged to register his protest:--\r\n\r\n    Really John Bull may almost be described as a maniac with lucid\r\n    intervals. A few years ago it was the railway mania--a very\r\n    dangerous frenzy....The mania now prevailing is one which, if not\r\n    attended to, may perhaps prove troublesome. This is the striking\r\n    mania. Everybody is striking. The other day it was the cabmen; now\r\n    it is the dockyard labourers; the policemen, even, have struck and\r\n    thrown down their staves. Our mechanics have so far become\r\n    machines, that, like clocks, as clocks ought to be, they are all\r\n    striking together. Should this mania spread, we shall have striking\r\n    become what might be called the order, but that it will be the\r\n    disorder, of the day. In short, almost everybody will strike except\r\n    the threshers, the smiths and the pugilists. With all this striking\r\n    though, we had better take care that we are not floored.\r\n\r\nAs for the efficacy of the strike-weapon in general, _Punch's_ view is\r\nsummed up in the remark which he puts into the mouth of a working man's\r\nwife as early as 1853, \"Wot good did strikes ever do the pore?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMACHINERY AND MONEY-MAKING\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the 'thirties and 'forties the triumphs of applied science and\r\ninvention had already begun to exert an immediate and far-reaching\r\ninfluence on national prosperity and the economics of industrialism. The\r\nviews on the new order expressed in _Punch_ reflect, with certain\r\nvariations, the enlightened moderation of the class of which he was the\r\nspokesman. The coming of the age of steam and machinery is welcomed, or\r\naccepted, with a tempered optimism. He approaches the subject mainly as\r\na critic or a satirist zealous for reform. But on two notable occasions\r\nhe assumes the rôle of philosopher and prophet. The first was in\r\nJanuary, 1842, _à propos_ of a remark made by Sir Robert Peel that\r\nincreased demand for manufactures would only increase machine-power:--\r\n\r\n    Machinery, in its progress, has doubtless been the origin of\r\n    terrible calamity; it has made the strong man so much live lumber.\r\n    But as we cannot go back, and must go on, it is for statesmen and\r\n    philosophers to prepare for the crisis as surely coming as the\r\n    morning light. How, when machinery is multiplied--as it will be--a\r\n    thousandfold? How, when tens of thousand-thousand hands are made\r\n    idle by the ingenuity of the human mind? How, when, comparatively\r\n    speaking, there shall be _no_ labour for man? Will the multitude\r\n    lie down and, unrepining, die? We think not--we are sure not. Then\r\n    will rise--and already we hear the murmur--a cry, a shout for an\r\n    adjustment of interests; a shout that, hard as it is, will strike\r\n    upon the heart of Mammon, and make the spoiler tremble.\r\n\r\n    We put this question to Sir Robert Peel: if all labour done by man\r\n    were suddenly performed by machine power, and that power in the\r\n    possession of some thousand individuals--what would be the cry of\r\n    the rest of the race? Would not the shout be, \"Share, share\"?\r\n\r\n    The steam-engine, despite of themselves, must and will carry\r\n    statesmen back to first principles. As it is, machinery is a fiend\r\n    to the poor; the time will come when it will be a beneficent angel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Proposed lines....\r\n\r\nRAILWAY MAP OF ENGLAND (A PROPHECY)]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Impudence of Steam_]\r\n\r\nOn the second occasion, in May, 1844, the note struck in the last\r\nsentence is sounded more hopefully. In a fantasy entitled \"The May Day\r\nof Steam,\" the writer notes the passing of the old May Day and\r\nforeshadows Labour's appropriation of that festival; and a speech is put\r\ninto the mouth of a working man prophesying the ultimate unmitigated\r\ngood of invention, though its first operation created great inequality\r\nand caused misery to the hand-worker. But for the most part _Punch_ is\r\nconcerned with the dangers and discomforts of the new method of\r\nlocomotion and the wild speculation to which it gave rise. Railway\r\ndirectors were to him anathema. In his first volume _Punch_ sturdily\r\ndeclares that \"the best thing to do for poor Earth to protect her Would\r\nbe to hang daily a railway director,\" and of his many railway cartoons\r\nperhaps the most effective is that which represents a director sitting\r\non the front buffers of an engine as the best remedy for collisions. The\r\n\"Impudence of Steam\" is satirized in some prophetic verses, one couplet\r\nof which is still often quoted:--\r\n\r\n    \"Ease her, stop her!\"\r\n    \"Any gentleman for Joppa?\"\r\n    \"'Mascus, 'Mascus?\" \"Tickets, please, sir.\"\r\n    \"Tyre or Sidon?\" \"Stop her, ease her!\"\r\n    \"Jerusalem, 'lem, 'lem!\" \"Shur! Shur!\"\r\n    \"Do you go on to Egypt, sir?\"\r\n    \"Captain, is this the land of Pharaoh?\"\r\n    \"Now look alive there! Who's for Cairo?\"\r\n    \"Back her!\" \"Stand clear, I say, old file!\"\r\n    \"What gent or lady's for the Nile,\"\r\n    \"Or Pyramids?\" \"Thebes! Thebes! Sir!\" \"Steady!\"\r\n    \"Now, where's that party for Engedi?\"\r\n\r\n    Pilgrims holy, Red Cross Knights,\r\n      Had ye e'er the least idea,\r\n    Even in your wildest flights,\r\n      Of a steam trip to Judea?\r\n    What next marvel Time will show\r\n      It is difficult to say,\r\n    \"'Bus,\" perchance, to Jericho,\r\n      \"Only sixpence all the way.\"\r\n    Cabs in Solyma may fly;\r\n      'Tis a not unlikely tale:\r\n    And from Dan the tourist hie\r\n      Unto Beersheba by \"rail.\"\r\n\r\nBut the miseries and discomforts of railway travelling are dwelt on far\r\nmore frequently than its prospective delights. The first-class alone was\r\nendurable, and that was grossly overcharged: the rest had to put up with\r\novercrowding, discomfort, draughts, hard seats, smoke, dust and dirt.\r\nThird-class passengers were negligible and contemptible folk; neither\r\npunctuality nor civility was to be expected.\r\n\r\nIn 1845 the railway mania becomes acute--a \"universal epidemic.\" George\r\nHudson, the Railway King, looms large in the public eye; and _Punch_\r\nexpresses his dissatisfaction with M.P.s for dabbling in speculation\r\nwhich they have themselves the opportunity of unduly favouring.\r\nBurlesques of various railway projects--centrifugal and\r\natmospheric--abound. _Punch_ ridicules the idea of a railway in the Isle\r\nof Wight as unnecessary and calculated to spoil the \"Garden of England.\"\r\nThe menace to the rural and pastoral amenities of the countryside moves\r\nhim to eloquent protest. The sufferings of M.P.s before Railway\r\nCommittees are set forth in the parody of Tennyson's \"Mariana in the\r\nMoated Grange\"; the golden harvest reaped by expert engineering\r\nwitnesses is resentfully acknowledged; \"Jeames\" has not escaped the\r\ninfection and appears frequently as speculator, \"stag,\" and dupe. The\r\nBattle of the Gauges had been joined, and _Punch_ asserts that the\r\nlargest entry in the \"railway returns\" was that recording the\r\ncasualties. The Unicorn in the Royal Arms is explained as the \"Stag\" of\r\nrailway speculation, and a design of a railway lunatic asylum is\r\nsubmitted as the most appropriate terminus for many of the new schemes.\r\nThe protests of fox-hunters, noted by _Punch_, recall the verses of the\r\nCheshire poet:--\r\n\r\n    Let the steam pot\r\n    Hiss till it's hot,\r\n    But give me the speed of the Tantivy Trot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RAILWAY JUGGERNAUT OF 1845]\r\n\r\nThe mania was not confined to men: _Punch_ satirizes the ladies who were\r\n\"stagging it\" under the heading \"A Doe in the City,\" and suggests a\r\nJoint Stock Railway Workhouse as the natural and fitting end of all\r\nthese operations. This idea is further developed in \"Jaques in Capel\r\nCourt,\" a parody which begins:--\r\n\r\n    All the world are stags!\r\n    Yea, all the men and women merely jobbers--\r\n\r\nand after enumerating the various phases of the mania, concludes:--\r\n\r\n    Last scene of all,\r\n    That ends this sad but common history,\r\n    Is Union pauperism and oakum-picking:\r\n    Sans beer, sans beef, sans tea, sans everything.\r\n\r\nRailway titles, a railway peerage and Parliament are foreshadowed, with\r\nKing Hudson, \"the monarch of all they 'survey,'\" installed in his palace\r\nat Hampton Court. The relations of John Bull--on whom \"the sweet\r\nsimplicity of the three per cents.\" had begun to pall--with humbugging\r\npromoters is hit off in the stanza:--\r\n\r\n    Said John, \"Your plan my mind contents,\r\n    I'm sick and tired of Three per Cents.;\r\n    And don't get enough by my paltry rents\"--\r\n    So he got hooked in by the railway \"gents.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KING HUDSON'S LEVÉE]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Rules for Railways_]\r\n\r\nIn his anti-Puseyite zeal _Punch_ mendaciously declares that a railway\r\nfrom Oxford to Rome has been projected with the Pope's approval. In\r\nfact, any stick was good enough to beat the speculators with. \"Locksley\r\nHall\" is parodied as \"Capel Court,\" and the rush to deposit plans at the\r\nBoard of Trade, when special trains were chartered by rival promoters,\r\nis described in humorous detail in a _Punch_ ballad. Padded suits are\r\nsuggested in 1846 as a protection against railway accidents, but the\r\nbest summary--with all its exaggerations--of the discomforts of railway\r\ntravelling in the mid 'forties is to be found in the \"Rules and\r\nRegulations for Railways\":--\r\n\r\n    The French Government has published a royal _ordonnance_, fixing\r\n    the regulations that are henceforward to be observed by all railway\r\n    companies in working their lines. As it is a pity these things\r\n    should be better managed in France, we publish a set of regulations\r\n    for English railways. Lord John Russell is welcome to them, if he\r\n    likes.\r\n\r\n    Every passenger in the second or third class is to be allowed to\r\n    carry a dark lantern, or a penny candle, or a safety lamp, into the\r\n    train with him, as the directors have kept the public in the dark\r\n    quite long enough.\r\n\r\n    No train is to travel slower than an omnibus, let the excursion be\r\n    ever so cheap, or the occasion ever so joyful.\r\n\r\n    Cattle are to be separated from the passengers as much as possible,\r\n    as it has been found, from experiments, that men and oxen do not\r\n    mix sociably together.\r\n\r\n    No stoppage at a railway station is to exceed half an hour.\r\n\r\n    No railway dividend is to exceed 100 per cent., and no bonus to be\r\n    divided oftener than once a month.\r\n\r\n    No fare is to be raised more than at the rate of a pound a week.\r\n\r\n    No third-class carriage is to contain more than a foot deep of\r\n    water in wet weather, but, to prevent accidents, corks and swimming\r\n    belts should always be kept in open carriages.\r\n\r\n    The ladies' carriages are to be waited upon by female policemen.\r\n\r\n    Every tunnel must be illuminated with one candle at least.\r\n\r\n    Never less than five minutes are to be allowed for dinner or\r\n    refreshment.[5]\r\n\r\n    One director must always travel with every train, only he is to be\r\n    allowed the option of choosing his seat, either in the second or\r\n    third class--whichever of the two he prefers.\r\n\r\n    Hospitals are to be built at every terminus, and a surgeon to be in\r\n    attendance at every station.\r\n\r\n    There must be some communication between every carriage and the\r\n    stoker, or the guard, either by a bell, or a speaking tube, or a\r\n    portable electric telegraph, so that the passengers may have some\r\n    means of giving information when their carriage is off the line, or\r\n    falling over an embankment, or a maniac or a horse has broken\r\n    loose.\r\n\r\nThere is sense as well as absurdity in this list. \"Smoking saloons\" are\r\nnoted as a novelty on the Eastern Counties Railway during the year 1846,\r\nbut in the same year to _Punch_ belongs the credit of suggesting\r\nrefreshment cars, and indulging in a pictorial forecast of underground\r\nrailways.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Punch_ was especially wroth with the \"3 minutes for\r\nscalding soup\" at Wolverton and Swindon.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PROPHETIC VIEW OF THE SUBTERRANEAN RAILWAYS]\r\n\r\nThe proposal that drums and trombones should be mounted on the engine as\r\na means of signalling cannot be taken seriously. Railway libraries on\r\nthe L. & N.W.R. are noted as a novelty in 1849. But by that year the\r\ntemper of the speculating public had changed, and _Punch_ is a faithful\r\nindex of the cold fit which had followed the disillusionment of the\r\nover-sanguine investor. The lure of El Dorado now beckoned from the New\r\nWorld, and the railway madness gave way to the mining insanity. The\r\npapers were full of complaints from discontented shareholders. The\r\nBattle of the Gauges continued, but Hudson is already spoken of in\r\n_Punch_ as a discrowned sovereign, threatened with disestablishment at\r\nMadame Tussaud's. For a while _Punch_ was inclined to extend to him a\r\ncertain amount of sympathy in his downfall, and in \"Two Pictures\" he\r\ndraws a contrast between mammon worship and the onslaught on mammon's\r\nhigh priest by his greedy and discontented worshippers. But the mood of\r\ncompassion soon changes to resentment in the bitter adaptation of\r\nCowper's poem, _The Loss of the Royal George_:--\r\n\r\n    Toll for a knave!\r\n      A knave whose day is o'er!\r\n    All sunk--with those who gave\r\n      Their cash, till they'd no more!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The _Royal George_ is gone,\r\n      His iron rule is o'er--\r\n    And he and his directors\r\n      Shall break the lines no more!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _King Hudson's Downfall_]\r\n\r\nIn the same vein are the proposals that Hudson should be the chief \"Guy\"\r\non November 5, and be appointed governor of a convict settlement on the\r\nIsle of Dogs. Simultaneously improvements are noted in the quickening of\r\nthe transit to Paris, the increase of excursions, and the beginning of\r\n_voyages de luxe_.\r\n\r\nBut the note of complaint and dissatisfaction prevails. The discomfort,\r\ndanger, unpunctuality and discourtesy endured by railway passengers are\r\nrubbed in with wearisome reiteration. In 1852 _Punch_ ironically\r\ncomments on the patience of the British public, \"content to travel in\r\nrailway pens, like sheep to the slaughter, injured, deluded, derided,\r\nonly bleating in return,\" and concludes his summary of recent protests\r\nfrom correspondents of _The Times_ with the remark:--\r\n\r\n    Railway accidents, railway frauds, railway impertinence are the\r\n    staple of our daily newspaper-reading. Railway chairmen and\r\n    directors are descending to the knavery, extortion, impudence, and\r\n    brutality from which cabmen are rising in the scale of manners and\r\n    morals. And, as aforesaid, the British public stands all this with\r\n    passive mournfulness, quiet endurance, meek, inactive\r\n    expostulation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAILWAY UNDERTAKING\r\n\r\nTOUTER: \"Going by this train, Sir?\"\r\n\r\nPASSENGER: \"'M? Eh? Yes.\"\r\n\r\nTOUTER: \"Allow me, then, to give you one of my cards, Sir.\"]\r\n\r\nThe directors of the L. & N.W.R. are severely criticised for overworking\r\ntheir engine drivers, _à propos_ of a well-authenticated case of a man\r\nwho had been on duty for thirty hours without relief or opportunity to\r\nrest. \"If dividends demand economy, and economy necessitates the\r\nemployment of one man to do the work of six, the only thing to be done\r\nfor public safety is to get a man with an iron constitution,\" and\r\n_Punch_ accordingly suggests that the directors should provide\r\nthemselves with engine drivers entirely composed of that metal.\r\nComplaints of dangerous railways continue to the end of the period under\r\nreview, and in 1856 _Punch_ is still of opinion that we might take a\r\nleaf out of the book of the Russians, who carry surgeons on their\r\ntrains. Undertakers he had already suggested as a part of the normal\r\nequipment of expresses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _\"Bradshaw: A Mystery\"_]\r\n\r\nA witty bishop once scandalized his hearers by bracketing _Bradshaw_\r\nwith the Bible as an indispensable book. Bradshaw's _Railway Time\r\nTables_ were first issued in 1839; the monthly guide dates from\r\nDecember, 1841; it was not, however, until 1856 that _Punch_ began to\r\nrealize the elements of comedy underlying that austere document, and\r\nutilized them in a little play called _Bradshaw: A Mystery_, describing\r\nthe separation, adventures and ultimate reunion of two harassed lovers.\r\nLove may laugh at locksmiths, but _Bradshaw_ is another matter. Here is\r\nthe happy ending of this romantic libel:--\r\n\r\n      _Leonora._ Oh, don't talk of _Bradshaw_!\r\n    _Bradshaw_ has nearly maddened me.\r\n    _Orlando_. And me.\r\n    He talks of trains arriving that ne'er start;\r\n    Of trains that seem to start, and ne'er arrive;\r\n    Of junctions where no union is effected;\r\n    Of coaches meeting trains that never come;\r\n    Of trains to catch a coach that never goes;\r\n    Of trains that start after they have arrived;\r\n    Of trains arriving long before they leave.\r\n    He bids us \"see\" some page that can't be found;\r\n    Or if 'tis found, it speaks of spots remote\r\n    From those we seek to reach! By _Bradshaw's_ aid\r\n    You've tried to get to London--I attempted\r\n    To get to Liverpool--and here we are,\r\n    At Chester--'Tis a junction--I'm content\r\n    Our union--at this junction--to cement.\r\n    And let us hope, nor you nor I again\r\n    May be attacked with _Bradshaw_ on the brain.\r\n      _Leonora._ I'm happy now! My husband!\r\n      _Orlando._ Ah, my bride!\r\n    Henceforth take me--not _Bradshaw_--for your guide.\r\n                    _The curtain falls._\r\n\r\n\"Orlando's\" speech is a good summary of the humours of _Bradshaw_ as\r\nanalysed in _Punch's_ \"Comic Guide\" some years later.\r\n\r\nFrom steam to electricity the transition is obvious. _Punch_ notes the\r\nadoption of the \"Electro-Magnetic Telegraph\" by the Great Western\r\nRailway in the summer of 1844. In 1845 we read of an electric gun to\r\nfire 1,000 balls a minute. The laying of a submarine cable from Dover to\r\nCalais is discussed in 1846, but was not realized till five years\r\nafterwards, when _Punch_ hailed the completion of the scheme as a new\r\nlink between the two countries and celebrated it in a cartoon and a\r\nsonnet.\r\n\r\nAlready the influence of electricity on international relations had been\r\nforeshadowed, and in the same year in which Palmerston repudiated\r\nresponsibility for the welcome of Kossuth in England _Punch_ rudely\r\ndescribed his message as \"electric lying.\" The days of \"wireless\r\ndiplomacy\" in the old sense of the epithet were passing, to the\r\nembarrassment of representatives who were within immediate hail of the\r\ncentral Government. Soon we begin to hear complaints of the new service\r\non the score of delays and excessive charges, and when an earthquake\r\nshock was felt \"for the first time\" in Ireland in the winter of 1852,\r\n_Punch_ notes that a writer in the _Limerick Chronicle_ attributed it to\r\nthe atmospheric influence of the electric telegraph! Electricity as an\r\nilluminant elicited an optimistic if somewhat previous eulogy in 1849;\r\nand cooking by electricity is foreshadowed in 1857. The laying of the\r\ntransatlantic cable is welcomed long before it was an accomplished fact,\r\nbut _Punch's_ compliments had a sting in their tail when he wrote the\r\nfollowing lines:--\r\n\r\nAMERICAN JOURNALISM IN A NEW LINE\r\n\r\n    It is much to be hoped that the telegraph wire,\r\n    About to be laid down, will not form a lyre,\r\n    On which to strike discord 'twixt the old world and new;\r\n    Though scarce can we hope all its messages true,\r\n    For then t'other side would have nothing to do.\r\n\r\n_Punch's_ interest in aeronautics dates from his earliest infancy,\r\nthough his mixture of prophecy and satire is rather confusing. Designs\r\nof aerial steamships abound in his columns; and one of them is not too\r\nbad an anticipation of the aeroplane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AERIAL STEAM CARRIAGE]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Aviation Forecasts_]\r\n\r\nIn 1845 there was actually a periodical called _The Balloon_, though\r\n_Punch_ is jocular at the expense of its very limited _clientèle_.\r\nStill, though the number of aeronauts was few, their enterprise\r\nattracted a great deal of attention, and Green, who made 526 ascents\r\nbetween 1821 and 1852, including his famous trip from Vauxhall to\r\nWeilburg in Nassau, is frequently mentioned. _Punch_, to his credit,\r\ninveighed vehemently against the senseless inhumanity of aeronautic\r\nacrobats who made a practice of taking up animals with them. He was less\r\nfortunate in his dogmatic pronouncement in 1851 that the balloon was a\r\n\"perfectly useless invention,\" and in his scornful dismissal, four years\r\nlater, of the suggestion that it might be useful in warfare:--\r\n\r\n    Everybody, including, of course, all the nobodies, would seem to\r\n    have some peculiar plan for finishing off the war in a successful\r\n    and expeditious manner. The last place we should look for the means\r\n    of carrying on hostilities with vigour is up in the air; but,\r\n    nevertheless, an aeronaut has \"stepped in\" upon the public with a\r\n    suggestion that balloons are the means required for the siege of\r\n    Sebastopol and the smashing of Cronstadt. If this theory is\r\n    correct, Lord Raglan ought at once to be superseded by the \"veteran\r\n    Green\" or the \"intrepid\" Mrs. Graham.\r\n\r\n    One of the \"intrepids,\" who has gained a high position by his\r\n    balloon, has published a dialogue between himself and a general,\r\n    who is, of course, represented as soon beating a retreat in an\r\n    argument against the employment of balloons in battle. The aeronaut\r\n    proposes to hover in his balloon over the enemy's position, and\r\n    take observations of what is passing, but he forgets that a passing\r\n    shot might happen to catch his eye in a rather disagreeable manner.\r\n    The aeronaut undertakes not only to observe, but to make himself\r\n    the subject of observation by a series of signals, through the\r\n    medium of which he proposes to point out the movements of the\r\n    enemy. This is to be effected by an apparatus which, as it would of\r\n    course be at the mercy of the wind, would be blown about in all\r\n    directions possibly, except that which it ought to take, and thus\r\n    the signals would be converted into signal failures. The aeronaut\r\n    also proposes using his balloon for \"destructive purposes,\" by\r\n    taking up some shells, which should be \"light to lift but terrible\r\n    to fall,\" and so arranged as to avoid the fate of Captain Warner's\r\n    invention, \"whose balloon,\" we are told by the aeronaut himself,\r\n    \"went off in an opposite direction to what he had intended.\"\r\n\r\n    \"And by what means,\" answers the general, \"would you let off your\r\n    missiles?\"\r\n\r\n    \"Either by fuses,\" answers the aeronaut, \"a liberating trigger, or\r\n    an electric communication, or by _another contrivance_ which you\r\n    must excuse me, general, for not mentioning, as I hold it _a\r\n    secret_.\"\r\n\r\n    This \"_secret_\" will probably be kept to all eternity, and, at all\r\n    events, until it is revealed we must be excused for refusing to\r\n    call on Lord Aberdeen to adopt balloons for warfare, or to blow up\r\n    the Commander-in-Chief literally sky high, till he makes the air\r\n    the basis of military operations.\r\n\r\nSome enthusiasts certainly laid themselves open to ridicule. In 1849 a\r\ncertain J. Browne advertised a \"balloon railway to California\" as both\r\n\"safe and cheap.\" Captain Warner, again, ruled himself out of court by\r\nhis refusal to explain the secret of his alleged inventions--the\r\nlong-range torpedo and the bomb-dropping balloon--to the committee\r\nappointed to report thereon until he had been assured of the payment of\r\n£200,000 for each. Still, he cannot be denied the credit, such as it is,\r\nof having foreshadowed two of the deadliest and most destructive engines\r\nof modern warfare. _Punch_ at first lent Warner a certain measure of\r\nsupport, until careful inquiry had shown him to be both untrustworthy\r\nand intractable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EFFECT OF THE SUBMARINE TELEGRAPH; OR, PEACE AND GOOD\r\nWILL BETWEEN ENGLAND AND FRANCE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ye Wild Goose Chase after Ye Golden Calfe.\r\n\r\nTHE GOLD CRAZE IN 1849]\r\n\r\nThe railway \"boom\" had stimulated that first infirmity of ignoble\r\nminds--the desire to \"get rich quick\"--and cupidity, balked of its\r\nexpectations, turned eagerly towards the goldfields to satisfy its\r\nlongings. In 1849 California was the Mecca of the gold craze, and there\r\nis hardly a number of _Punch_ in this year which does not refer to the\r\nstampede from Europe to the diggings--\"the wild-goose chase after the\r\ngolden calf,\" as he called it. It was a gold fever in more senses than\r\none, since the diggers suffered terribly from disease, which led to the\r\ncynical suggestion that convicts should be sent there, as they were not\r\nlikely to return. Cobden, still in high favour with _Punch_ as the\r\napostle of national economy, was busy preaching Peace, Retrenchment and\r\nReform, but his efforts were powerless to stem the tide of speculation.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 we find a reference to the glut of bullion at the Bank, a state\r\nof affairs long strangely unfamiliar. In 1851 the opening of the\r\ngoldfields in Australia diverted the stream of speculative emigration\r\nfrom California to the antipodes, and this new phase of the _auri sacra\r\nfames_ does not escape _Punch's_ notice, though no mention is made of\r\nthe curious fact that amongst those who were lured to the diggings was\r\nLord Robert Cecil, afterwards Marquess of Salisbury. Alongside of the\r\nevidences of the great expansion of commerce and national prosperity we\r\nfind frequent references to the growth of gambling. In 1852 _Punch's_\r\npages abound in allusions, in text and illustrations, to the betting\r\nmania--to gulls and pigeons and sharks. \"Profiteering\" was rampant in\r\nthe Crimean War, and _Punch_ is eloquent in his denunciation of the\r\ncontractors who supplied shoddy equipment and bad guns. And the\r\naftermath of the war included, besides other familiar sources of\r\ndiscontent, \"defalcations, embezzlements and other cases of gross and\r\nenormous dishonesty.\" It was a time of speculation and peculation, of\r\nbank smashes and absconding directors--those of the Royal British Bank\r\ncoming in for special execration. The fraudulent banker is singled out\r\nby _Punch_ as the arch-rogue and thief who excited the envy of the\r\nburglar, since the banker stole more and escaped unpunished. The\r\nbrothers Sadleir are specially selected for dishonourable mention in\r\n1856, but John Sadleir, M.P. for Carlow and an ex-Lord of the Treasury,\r\nwho was the original of Mr. Merdle in _Little Dorrit_, and was described\r\nin _The Times_ after his death as a \"national calamity,\" only escaped\r\npunishment by suicide.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Novelties and Anticipations_]\r\n\r\nAs we survey the various new inventions, novel devices and anticipations\r\nmentioned in the pages of _Punch_, we are tempted to exclaim, in the\r\nhackneyed phrase, that there is nothing new under the sun. A\r\n\"Glaciarium\" with artificial ice is noted in the autumn of 1843.\r\n\"Euphonia,\" or the speaking machine, invented and exhibited by Professor\r\nFaber at the Egyptian Hall in 1846, was an automaton, and can hardly be\r\nregarded as a lineal ancestor of the gramophone. The \"patent mile-index\r\ncab\" in 1847, on the other hand, was a genuine harbinger of the taxi,\r\nbut the time was not ripe for its general adoption. _Punch's_ account of\r\n\"Talking by Telegraph,\" in the autumn of 1848, is no more than a piece\r\nof intelligent anticipation. The telephone voice, however, is happily\r\nhit off in the remark that \"we have heard of a singer's voice being\r\nrather wiry at times; but there will be something very trying in the\r\nperpetual twang of the new mode of small talk that is recommended to\r\nus,\" a comment of 1848. The beneficent side of the discovery of\r\nanæsthetics is lightly passed over in _Punch's_ earlier references to\r\nthis revolution in surgery in 1847, which suggest its application to\r\npoliticians or its use by hen-pecked husbands. Here only ether is\r\nmentioned, but the \"blessings of chloroform\" are discussed a few months\r\nlater in the same jocular spirit. Incubators, the sewing machine and\r\nphonetic spelling are among the wonders of the wonderful year of 1848.\r\nPitman and the \"Fonetik Nuz\" furnish _Punch_ with food for mirth in\r\n1849; the claims of the discoverer of \"Xyloidine,\" a new motive power to\r\ntake the place of steam, are treated with frivolous scepticism more\r\njustifiable than that shown by _Punch_ towards ironclads in 1850. In\r\n1851 the novelties included \"Electro-biology,\" _i.e._ hypnotism;\r\nshoeblacks; electric clocks; false legs,[6] invented by Palmer, an\r\nAmerican; and the supply of tea to the Navy. \"Noiseless wheels\" in 1853\r\nsuggest the advent of the age of rubber; but Robert W. Thomson had taken\r\nout his patent for india-rubber tyres in 1845. Steam ploughs, gas-stoves\r\nfor cooking and central heating for houses followed in rapid succession\r\nin 1853 and 1854. _Punch's_ ironical suggestions in the latter year for\r\nthe comfort and convenience of Cockney travellers in the ascent of\r\nSnowdon are only one of many instances where the mocking fancy of one\r\ngeneration becomes the fact of its successor.\r\n\r\nThe \"new pillar boxes\" must be added to the features of 1854; their\r\ncolour harmonized with the red coats then worn by the postmen; while the\r\nscheme to propel mail bags through tubes by atmospheric pressure was put\r\nforward as early as 1855. Massage appears as the new \"movement cure\" by\r\nkneading and pressing, vide _Punch_, 1856, but he, however, was not\r\nsolely interested in beneficent inventions. Lord Dundonald's famous\r\n\"secret war plan,\" originally proposed in 1811, and rejected by a secret\r\nCommittee presided over by the Duke of York, who pronounced it\r\n\"infallible, irresistible, but inhuman,\" was revived after the\r\ninventor's readmission to the British Navy, and urged on the Admiralty\r\nand Government during the Crimean War. It was again rejected on the\r\nscore of its inhumanity, though _Punch_ welcomed the plan, without\r\nknowing exactly what it was, and besought the Government to cast away\r\nscruples and use _anything_ against such an enemy as Russia. Whatever\r\nmay have been \"Dundonald's plan\" was never divulged, it remained a\r\nnameless mystery. The new nomenclature evolved by the triumphs of\r\napplied science in humaner directions led to a good deal of controversy,\r\nnotably over the introduction of the word \"telegram\" as a substitute for\r\n\"telegraphic despatch.\" The shorter form was first officially used in\r\n1855 (see the _Panmure Papers_) by Lord Clarendon, but scholars and men\r\nof letters protested vigorously against this Yankee barbarism. Shilleto,\r\nthe famous Cambridge scholar, suggested \"telegrapheme.\" He did not want\r\nit, but it was at least properly constructed on Greek analogies. Oxford,\r\nas _Punch_ notices in 1857, supported the modern form, and here for\r\nonce, at any rate, abandoned her traditional espousal of lost causes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Henry Heather Bigg (1826-81), the surgical instrument\r\nmaker, who made the substitutes for the lost limbs of soldiers in the\r\nCrimean War, is mentioned in 1856 (Vol. xxx., p. 28).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Telegram or Telegrapheme?_]\r\n\r\nIn general, _Punch_, as a moderate reformer, deals impartially with the\r\ncontending claims of science and the classical curriculum. He believed\r\nin the liberalizing influence of the humanities, while he denounced\r\nacademic arrogance, pedantry and exclusiveness. He might be described as\r\na mitigated modernist in these years, in which he advocated the\r\npopularization of science by means of Institutes and similar centres of\r\nenlightenment, and welcomed new inventions--while reserving to himself\r\nthe right to burlesque their possibilities, and to ridicule the\r\npretensions of pompous professors and futile philosophers. He was at one\r\nwith those rationalists who waged war on superstition and credulity, but\r\nhe realized better than they did how deeply entrenched the enemy was in\r\nhigh places, and how mistaken was the view that the victory was already\r\nwon. The friendly lines which he addressed to Faraday in 1853 are mere\r\nhalting doggerel, but they are worth recalling, if only for their sound\r\ndoctrine, which is as much needed to-day as it was sixty-seven years\r\nago:--\r\n\r\n    Oh, Mr. Faraday, simple Mr. Faraday!\r\n      Did you of enlightenment consider this an age?\r\n    Bless your simplicity, deep in electricity,\r\n      But in social matters, unsophisticated sage!\r\n    Weak superstition dead; knocked safely on the head,\r\n      Long since buried deeper than the bed of the Red Sea,\r\n    Did you not fondly fancy? Did you think that necromancy\r\n      Practised now at the expense of any fool could be?\r\n\r\n    Oh, Mr. Faraday, simple Mr. Faraday!\r\n      Persons not uneducated--very highly dressed--\r\n    Fine folks as peer and peeress, go and fee a Yankee seeress,\r\n      To evoke their dead relations' Spirits from their rest.\r\n    Also seek cunning men, feigning by mesmeric ken,\r\n      Missing property to trace and indicate the thief,\r\n    Cure ailments, give predictions: all of these enormous fictions\r\n      Are, among our higher classes, matters of belief.\r\n\r\n    Oh, Mr. Faraday, simple Mr. Faraday!\r\n      Guided by the steady light which mighty Bacon lit,\r\n    You naturally stare, seeing that so many are\r\n      Following whither fraudulent Jack-with-the-lanterns flit.\r\n    Of scientific lore though you have an ample store,\r\n      Gotten by experiments, in one respect you lack;\r\n    Society's weak side, whereupon you none have tried,\r\n      Being all philosopher and nothing of a quack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDUCATION\r\n\r\n\r\nEducation in the 'forties was the Cinderella of the Legislature.\r\nParliament, it is true, spent laborious hours in discussing the theory\r\nof education, but in debating the principle overlooked the practice.\r\nMoney was doled out in homoeopathic doses. In 1841 the sum of £10,000\r\nwas voted for the education of the people in the same session in which\r\n£70,000 was voted for the Royal Stables at Windsor, a contrast which\r\n_Punch_ had not forgotten five years later. The direct connexion between\r\nignorance and crime was constantly forced on the attention of humane\r\nmagistrates. When the Lord Mayor of London, in January, 1846, declared\r\nthat \"society was responsible for the contamination to which poor\r\nchildren were subjected,\" and that there was no calamity, to his way of\r\nthinking, \"comparable to that which sprang from the bringing up of youth\r\nin habits and practices of idleness and vice,\" _Punch_ found himself in\r\nthe unfamiliar position of being called upon to eulogize a functionary\r\nwho as a rule never gave him a chance. \"Juvenile delinquents,\" he points\r\nout, were \"as much reared for Newgate as many of the beautiful babies,\r\ntaking their morning airings in the parks, are reared for hereditary\r\nlegislators.\" In another graphically brusque passage describing the\r\ntransportation for life of four lads aged from 18 to 21, we read \"they\r\nwere brought up as brutes, and society reaps the terrible fruits of\r\ntheir rearing.\" Hullah's music classes for the people at Exeter Hall in\r\n1842 were excellent in their way, but the solace of song was a doubtful\r\nboon in the Hungry 'Forties, and though _Punch_ supported the\r\nestablishment of schools of cookery throughout the kingdom, the supply\r\nof things to cook was more urgently needed. The years rolled on, the\r\nCorn Laws were repealed, and prosperity revived, but illiteracy\r\nremained, and it was due in the country districts, in _Punch's_ view, to\r\nthe fact that \"contending zealots cannot agree with what theological\r\nmysteries they shall leaven the common information which the\r\nschoolmaster is to impart to the country bumpkin.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EDUCATIONAL QUESTION]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Abysmal Ignorance_]\r\n\r\nIn 1850 the following dialogue was given in _The Times_ police report of\r\nWednesday, January 9, and quoted in _Punch_:--\r\n\r\n    George Ruby, a boy aged 14, was put into the box to be sworn, and\r\n    the Testament was put into his hand. He looked quite astonished\r\n    upon taking hold of the book.\r\n\r\n    _Ald. Humphrey._ Well, do you know what you are about? Do you know\r\n    what an oath is?\r\n\r\n    _Boy._ No.\r\n\r\n    _Ald. H._ Do you know what a Testament is?\r\n\r\n    _Boy._ No.\r\n\r\n    _Ald. H._ Can you read?\r\n\r\n    _Boy._ No.\r\n\r\n    _Ald._ H. Do you ever say your prayers?\r\n\r\n    _Boy._ No, never.\r\n\r\n    _Ald. H._ Do you know what prayers are?\r\n\r\n    _Boy._ No.\r\n\r\n    _Ald. H._ Do you know what God is?\r\n\r\n    _Boy._ No.\r\n\r\n    _Ald H._ Do you know what the devil is?\r\n\r\n    _Boy._ I've heard of the devil, but I don't know him.\r\n\r\n    _Ald. H._ What do you know, my poor boy?\r\n\r\n    _Boy._ I knows how to sweep the crossing.\r\n\r\n    _Ald. H._ And that's all?\r\n\r\n    _Boy._ That's all. I sweeps the crossing.\r\n\r\n    The Alderman said he, of course, could not take the evidence of a\r\n    creature who knew nothing whatever of the obligation to tell the\r\n    truth.\r\n\r\nIt was to cope with this sort of destitution that the Ragged Schools\r\nmovement had been started several years before. From the first _Punch_\r\nlent it his hearty support, though in his first notice, in 1846, he was\r\nunable to resist the opportunity of combining his approval with a dig at\r\nthe aristocracy:--\r\n\r\n    WHAT RAGGED SCHOOLS MAY COME TO\r\n\r\n    It is with peculiar satisfaction that we view the establishment of\r\n    Ragged Schools in various parts of the Metropolis. We speak\r\n    advisedly when we describe our satisfaction as peculiar. For it is\r\n    not merely that we are rejoiced at the idea of a number of youthful\r\n    mendicants being prevented from becoming thieves and pickpockets,\r\n    taught to earn an honest livelihood, and rescued from vice and\r\n    misery through the instrumentality of these seminaries. No; our\r\n    views are much higher than such plebeian considerations as these,\r\n    and they also extend far beyond the present time. We have an eye to\r\n    the benefit of our posterity and to that of the superior classes\r\n    generally.\r\n\r\n    When we consider that Eton was established for the reception of\r\n    poor and indigent scholars, and that Winchester and most of our\r\n    other public schools were, at their first foundation, charities, we\r\n    may not unreasonably indulge the hope that the Ragged Schools,\r\n    originally, like them, destined for the instruction of the\r\n    tag-rag-and-bobtail, may ultimately become gratuitous institutions\r\n    for the education of the children of the aristocracy.\r\n\r\nYet it was an aristocrat of the \"old nobility\" who started and devoted\r\nhis best energies to the furtherance of the Ragged Schools movement, as\r\nall the world knows. His name is not even mentioned here, and when it is\r\nmentioned in these years is too often coupled with tasteless gibes at\r\nLord Shaftesbury's proclivities and Sabbatarianism. _Punch_ could not\r\nforgive Lord Shaftesbury for his association with Exeter Hall (which to\r\n_Punch_ meant fireside philanthropy and Jellybyism) and his support of\r\nlaws which enabled magistrates to fine boys fifteen shillings or a\r\nfortnight's wages each for playing cricket on Sunday. Sir Robert Peel\r\nhad to die before _Punch_ did him justice. Lord Shaftesbury was more\r\nfortunate, for thirty years before he died _Punch_ made the _amende_ in\r\n\"The Earl King, or the Earl of Shaftesbury and the Juvenile Mendicant.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Distressed Author_]\r\n\r\n\"The greater the employment of the primer, the less the need of the\r\n'cat'\" is an aphorism which sums up the creed of the humanitarian\r\nreformers of the 'forties and 'fifties. The \"ladder of learning\" was not\r\nyet planted in the modern sense, and efforts to ascend from the lower to\r\nthe upper rungs were frowned upon by those in authority. At a meeting of\r\nthe National Society for Promoting the Education of the Poor in June,\r\n1849, a clerical speaker ridiculed the questions, set in an examination\r\npaper for National School teachers, which presupposed a knowledge of the\r\nworks of Shakespeare, Milton, Adam Smith, Johnson and Scott, and of the\r\nLife of Mrs. Fry. Learning was at a discount; authors of note, with few\r\nexceptions--such as Thackeray and Macaulay--were generally impecunious,\r\nand sometimes on the border-land of destitution. Douglas Jerrold had a\r\nlife-long struggle to keep his head above water, for all his industry.\r\nThere were no royalties in those days, and for _Black-Eyed Susan_, which\r\nbrought tens of thousands of pounds to theatrical lessees and popular\r\nactors, he received from first to last the sum of £60. _Punch_ was the\r\nconstant champion of the distressed author fallen on evil days, such as\r\nJoseph Haydn of the _Dictionary of Dates_, who was granted a Civil List\r\npension of £25 a year just three weeks before his death in January,\r\n1856, or old Joseph Guy, \"the man of many books, the ever-green\r\n'Spelling Book' among the number.\" One of the finest (but posthumous)\r\ntributes to Sir Robert Peel was on the occasion of the Literary Fund\r\ndinner in 1856, when a sum of £100 was sent from the proceeds of the\r\nfirst portion of the _Peel Papers_:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEWSVENDOR: \"Now, my man, what is it?\"\r\n\r\nBOY: \"I vonts a nillustrated newspaper with a norrid murder and a\r\nlikeness in it.\"]\r\n\r\n    From the tomb of Sir Robert speaks the spirit that, when in the\r\n    flesh and baited by the dogs of party [not to mention the bitter\r\n    satire of _Punch_ himself], still beneficently thought of the wants\r\n    of spasmodic Haydn; still, by sympathy in word and act, smoothed\r\n    the dying pillow of poor Tom Hood.\r\n\r\nThe respect and admiration with which George Stephenson and Joseph\r\nPaxton were invariably treated was largely due to the fact that they\r\nwere self-taught men. And when Joseph Hume died in 1855, _Punch_, who\r\nhad so often chaffed him for his love of figures and returns, while\r\napplauding his attack on \"gold lace\" and extravagance, paid fitting\r\nhomage to the perseverance which enabled him to fight his way up from\r\npoverty and obscurity, to his rugged honesty, his hard-won triumphs, and\r\nhis honourable participation in all victories over wrong in Church and\r\nState. An alarming ignorance, however, was not monopolized by the lower\r\norders. In his scheme for the reform of the House of Lords _Punch_\r\nsuggests that peers should only be admitted to the Upper House after an\r\nexamination in the three R's, history, geography and political economy.\r\nGeography even in our own enlightened days remains a stumbling-block to\r\nMinisters, even Prime Ministers. Disraeli's ignorance of arithmetic on\r\nthe occasion of his appointment as Chancellor of the Exchequer in the\r\nDerby Cabinet is a frequent source of ribaldry in _Punch_, who suggested\r\nthe establishment of an infants' school for the new Cabinet. So recently\r\nas the eve of the twentieth century a Chancellor of the Exchequer was\r\nreported to have been so ignorant of decimals that he asked what was\r\nmeant by those \"damned dots.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Education Bill of 1856_]\r\n\r\nReverting to elementary education, we can find no better commentary on\r\nits progress in the mid 'fifties than two extracts from _Punch's_\r\n\"Essence of Parliament\" in the spring of 1856:--\r\n\r\n    _Thursday_, March 6th. In the Commons, Lord John Russell moved a\r\n    series of resolutions on the subject of Education, and afterwards\r\n    withdrew them. What they were, therefore, does not seem to be a\r\n    matter of any very overwhelming interest, especially as he\r\n    threatens them again on the 10th of April. His plan, however,\r\n    comprised a sort of timid notion of a rate not to be altogether\r\n    voluntary; but the fact, disclosed by the census of 1851, that of\r\n    four millions of our children, between five and fifteen years of\r\n    age, two millions are proved to be on no school list at all, while\r\n    a great mass of the other two millions are receiving the most\r\n    miserable tuition, did not excite either Lord John, or our Blessed\r\n    House of Representatives, into an indignant declaration that the\r\n    children _should_ be taught, that the nation should pay for their\r\n    teaching, and that the parents who hindered or neglected the work\r\n    should be punished. On the contrary, they chattered and talked\r\n    commonplace, and complimented one another, and an old Dissenting\r\n    Attorney called Hadfield[7] said that the people were taught as\r\n    well as any other people, which he proved from the fact that they\r\n    wrote and posted a great many letters; and he opposed all further\r\n    interference. Having thus got rid of the Education of the Poor, the\r\n    House went on to the Education of the Rich, and had a discussion on\r\n    the Oxford Reforms, but it also ended in nothing.\r\n\r\n    _Thursday_, April 10th. The House of Commons was occupied during\r\n    this night and the next with discussing Lord John Russell's\r\n    Education resolutions. They were opposed, of course, by\r\n    representatives of the Church, of Dissent, and of the Manchester\r\n    school: the first think that their religion only should be taught\r\n    by the State; the second that their religion only should be taught,\r\n    but not by the State; and the third that no religion should be\r\n    taught at all. It is needless to say that Government has no\r\n    practical views on the subject, but like all half-hearted people\r\n    contrived to get the worst in the fray.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: _Punch_ is unjust to George Hadfield, member for Sheffield\r\nfrom 1852 to 1874, a prominent Congregationalist and advanced Liberal\r\nwho took an active part in forming the Anti-Corn Law League and rendered\r\nvaluable assistance in the House in promoting legal reform.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AWFUL EXAMPLE OF INFANT PRECOCITY.\r\n\r\nPRODIGY: \"Mamma! Look dere, dere Papa!\"]\r\n\r\nIn July, 1856, at the end of the session, the Education Bill for England\r\nand Scotland figured in the \"Massacre of the Innocents,\" sixteen in all.\r\nAs a set-off the Cambridge University Bill introduced some useful\r\nreforms, though it failed to secure the admission of Dissenters; and a\r\nMinister for Education was created under the title of Vice-President of\r\nthe Committee of the Council of Education. But _Punch_, in these years\r\nat any rate, had no love for the older universities. He regarded them,\r\nand especially Oxford, as the strongholds of mediævalism, obscurantism,\r\nand all the \"isms\" against which he was always tilting in Church and\r\nState; and he seldom failed to satirize the opposition of academic\r\nauthorities to inquiry and reform. The romance of \"the home of lost\r\ncauses\" made no appeal to his practical mind. Yet of classical\r\nscholarship and the classical curriculum he was a loyal supporter.\r\nClassical allusions, quotations and parallels abound in his pages: he\r\neven printed translations in doggerel Greek by Dr. Kenealy. But the\r\neducation of the masses was his prime concern, and after the fiasco of\r\n1856 Parliament remained inactive for nearly six years--until the\r\nnotable measure, establishing the principle of \"payment by results,\" was\r\nintroduced by Lowe in 1862. In this context it may be noted that as\r\nearly as 1848 _Punch_ avowed his belief in the value of making lessons\r\ninteresting to children:--\r\n\r\n    The reason why school books are so dreary to the child is because\r\n    they are full of subjects he has no sympathy with. Children's books\r\n    should be written for children. The child may be father to the man,\r\n    but that is no reason why he should be treated with literature\r\n    which is only fit for a father.... If battles are to be fought\r\n    before children they should be fought with tin soldiers.... Study\r\n    should be made into a good romp, learning turned into a game, and\r\n    children then could run into the schoolroom with the same eagerness\r\n    they rush now into the playground.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A Child's Letter to Hans Anderson_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOMAGE TO HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN]\r\n\r\nHere we have a crude anticipation of the Montessori system, around which\r\nso much controversy rages to-day. _Punch_ has always been a lover of\r\nchildren, gentle and simple, but at the same time a faithful critic of\r\nthe _enfant terrible_ and of juvenile precocity. One of the most\r\ndelightful letters that ever appeared in his pages was the genuine\r\nepistle from a little girl printed in the issue of January 10, 1857:--\r\n\r\n    \"MY DEAR MR. PUNCH,\r\n\r\n    \"we Hope you are Quite well and i wish you many Happy returns of\r\n    Christmas and i hope you will Excuse me riting to You but mamma Says\r\n    you allways are Fond of little people so i Hope you will Excuse as\r\n    me and charley read in the illusterated London [_News_] that Mr.\r\n    Hans Christian anderson is Coming to spend His Hollidays in England\r\n    And We shold like to see Him becase he as Made us All so Happy with\r\n    is Betiful storys the ugly duck the Top and the ball the snow Quen\r\n    the Red shoes the Storks little ida the Constant tinsoldier great\r\n    claws and Little Claws the darning Neddle and All the rest of Them\r\n    and it says in the illustat [_several attempts, a smear, and the\r\n    spelling evaded_] Paper the children shold Meet him in the\r\n    Crys-pallace and we shold Like to Go and tell him how much We Love\r\n    him for his betiful stores do you know the tinder box and tommelise\r\n    and charley liks the wild Swans best but i Hope you will Excuse bad\r\n    riting and i Am\r\n\r\n    \"Yours affectionate\r\n\r\n    \"NELLY.\r\n\r\n    charley says i Have not put in wat We ment if you please Will you\r\n    put In  punch wat everybody is to Do to let Mr. hans Ansen know how\r\n    Glad we are He is Coming.\"\r\n\r\nWe hope that Hans Andersen--who, by the way, as a writer of fairy\r\nstories is regarded with disfavour by Madame Montessori--saw this\r\nletter. On the relations of parents and children generally, two of\r\n_Punch's_ aphorisms are not without their bearing on present-day\r\nconditions. In the year 1844 the _Comic Blackstone_ reads: \"Children owe\r\ntheir parents support; but this is a mutual obligation, for they must\r\nsupport each other, though we sometimes hear them declaring each other\r\nwholly insupportable.\" And the other, under the heading \"The World's\r\nNursery,\" runs: \"The spoilt children of the present age rarely turn out\r\nthe great men of the next.\" It should be added, as some readers will\r\nremember, that in neither of the decades under review were the children\r\nof the poor in any danger of being spoiled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRELIGIOUS CONTROVERSY\r\n\r\n\r\n_Punch's_ efforts on behalf of Sunday recreation, already alluded to,\r\nexposed him to a great deal of hostile criticism. In 1854 the _English\r\nJournal of Education_ declared that _Punch_ was not suitable reading for\r\nSunday: it was \"worse than useless literature.\" But _Punch_ gave as good\r\nas he got. When the _Record_ attacked the Queen for having a band at\r\nWindsor on Sunday, and alluded to Nero fiddling while Rome burned,\r\n_Punch_ unblushingly called the editor \"a brimstone-faced _Mawworm_.\"[8]\r\nThe question of the opening of the British Museum and National Gallery\r\non Sunday came up again in 1855 on the motion of Sir Joshua Walmsley,\r\nbut was defeated by 235 to 48 votes, to _Punch's_ great disgust. He\r\nadvises constituencies to watch closely the conduct of the triumphant\r\nSabbatarians. \"If one of the 235 saints who opposed the resolution of\r\nSir Joshua Walmsley has his boots cleaned on Sunday, or takes a drive,\r\nor eats a warm dinner, unless by medical order, he is a humbug and a\r\nhypocrite, and unworthy of the suffrages of free and independent\r\nelectors.\" A year later the anti-Sabbatarians resumed their attack, and\r\nin his \"Essence of Parliament,\" distilled by Shirley Brooks, _Punch_\r\nsummarizes the debate:--\r\n\r\n    The debate to-night was brief, and chiefly left to men of small\r\n    calibre. The principal exceptions were Lord Stanley, who manfully\r\n    stood out as an Anti-Sabbatarian; Mr. Napier, who saw \"poison\" in\r\n    seeing pictures on Sunday; Mr. Heywood, who denied the truth of the\r\n    Jewish history of the Creation, but described the Sabbath as a\r\n    divine ordinance to be kept as a day of rejoicing; and Lord\r\n    Palmerston, who thought there would be no harm in opening these\r\n    exhibitions, but that there would be much if the House acted in\r\n    defiance of the opinions which had been expressed against doing so.\r\n    This eminently House-of-Commons logic and morality was too suited\r\n    to the audience not to be successful. On division, 376--add four\r\n    who were \"shut out\" and say 380--gentlemen in comfortable\r\n    circumstances, most of them with carriages and country houses,\r\n    decided, against 48 opponents, that the only holiday Mammon has\r\n    left to the poor man shall not be better spent than in a squalid\r\n    house, a dirty drinking-yard, or a debauching public-house.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Mawworm was an eighteenth-century forerunner of Chadband in\r\nBickerstaffe's play _The Hypocrite_.]\r\n\r\nThis Parliamentary opportunism, to which Palmerston adhered in the\r\nmatter of Sunday bands in the parks, was one of the qualities which\r\n_Punch_ liked least in \"the judicious bottle-holder,\" as he loved to\r\ncall Palmerston. In the controversy which raged round this question\r\nthroughout the year _Punch_ gladly recognized the enlightened zeal of\r\nSir Benjamin Hall, the Member for Marylebone and Commissioner of Works.\r\nFor a while the bands played in the parks on Sundays, and _Punch_\r\ncelebrated the concession, which had been sanctioned by Palmerston, in\r\nan \"Ode to Sir Benjamin Hall.\"\r\n\r\nBut the boon was short-lived. \"The Sunday Band, Hall's grant,\" was\r\n\"abolished by the influence of Cant,\" and on May 19 Palmerston, while\r\nretaining his personal opinion as to the propriety of having Sunday\r\nmusic in the parks, stated that such \"representations\" had been made to\r\nhim that he had felt it his duty to give way. The Sabbatarians were\r\njubilant, as may be gathered from _Punch's_ reference to the _Record_ in\r\nhis issue of August 16:--\r\n\r\n    We doubt very much whether we can any longer conscientiously call\r\n    the _Record_ our serious contemporary. That doubt is suggested by\r\n    the following passage occurring in one of its leading articles:--\r\n\r\n    \"We are taught to expect the blessing of God on the conduct of our\r\n    affairs when we act in accordance with the divine will; and it\r\n    almost seems as if Lord Palmerston acquired new strength from the\r\n    moment when he agreed to put down the Sunday bands. The attempt to\r\n    make Government responsible for the loss of Kars was defeated by a\r\n    great majority, and the subsequent attempt to censure Lord\r\n    Clarendon on account of the American dispute was defeated by a\r\n    majority still more overwhelming.\"\r\n\r\n    We can conceive a person devoid of all veracity and conscience,\r\n    writing in a great hurry to a set of imbecile fanatics,\r\n    perpetrating such stuff and nonsense as the above, but we cannot\r\n    well conceive any other person guilty thereof.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Goldsmith Bowdlerized]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUNDAY MUSIC AS CANT WOULD HAVE IT]\r\n\r\n_Punch_ could not see harm in music on any day, and he printed a\r\ncharming \"petition\" from the song-birds of Kensington to Sir Benjamin\r\nHall, expressing their apprehension of an order forbidding them to sing\r\non Sundays. But then, as now, there were moralists who saw not good but\r\nevil in everything. In the same year of 1856 the Government issued an\r\nedition of Goldsmith's \"Deserted Village\" for the use of schools, and\r\nthe lines:--\r\n\r\n    The hawthorn bush, with seats beneath the shade,\r\n    For talking age and whisp'ring lovers made--\r\n\r\nwere amended by the substitution of \"youthful converse\" for \"whisp'ring\r\nlovers.\" Assuming the character and style of Dr. Johnson, _Punch_\r\ncastigates this \"pseudo-purifier of Goldsmith\" in round terms. \"Sir, he\r\nis a noisome fellow, Sir, he is a male prude and a hypocrite. Sir, he\r\nis a dunce.\"\r\n\r\n_Punch's_ hostility to Exeter Hall, which has undergone structural and\r\nother vicissitudes even more remarkable than those of the Crystal\r\nPalace, was originally based on what may be called its foreign policy,\r\nwhich he regarded as indistinguishable from the worst form of\r\nJellybyism. This is how he described Exeter Hall in 1842:--\r\n\r\n    It is at the Hall that the fireside philanthropist, the good and\r\n    easy man, for whom life has been one long lounge on a velvet\r\n    sofa--it is there that he displays his practical benevolence,\r\n    talking for hours on the glory of shipping white pastors to Africa\r\n    to baptise the negro; or, if the climate will not have it so, to\r\n    die there. And it is from the Hall that the good and pious, having\r\n    voted a supply of religion to the black, depart for their own\r\n    comfortable homes, having, to their exceeding content, indicated\r\n    their Christianity by paying a pound, singing a hymn, and--taking\r\n    care of themselves.\r\n\r\nIn 1846, in \"A word on the May meetings\" (June 6), he appeals to the\r\nExeter Hall people to drop their foreign philanthropy and educate the\r\npoor at home--multiply ragged schools by ten thousand, and aid in the\r\nhousing movement, social reform, the establishment of baths and\r\nwash-houses. As a matter of fact, many of the Exeter Hall people, with\r\nLord Shaftesbury at their head, took an active part in these movements,\r\nbut _Punch_ could not forgive them for their rigid insistence on Sunday\r\nobservance, and labelled them indiscriminately as Pharisees, Pecksniffs\r\nand Chadbands.\r\n\r\nHis hostile criticisms of the Church, especially the bishops and\r\narchbishops, were equally uncomplimentary but better founded. As _The\r\nTimes_ wrote in 1847: \"The chief practical difficulty of the Church of\r\nEngland is how to engage and secure the affections of the poor.\" _Punch_\r\nre-echoed the sentiment (October 16, 1847), adding the sarcastic\r\ncomment: \"Bishops, with tens of thousands a year, cry 'Hear, hear!'\" But\r\nhe overlooked the fact that one of the remedies advocated by \"Young\r\nEngland\" for existing evils was the reorganization of the Church--to\r\nmake it the friend, comforter and protector of the people. \"Young\r\nEngland,\" however, was an aristocratic movement, and its leaders were\r\nalmost as great _bêtes noires_ to _Punch_ as Dr. Sumner, the Archbishop\r\nof Canterbury (commonly regarded as the incarnation of Cant), \"Soapy\r\nSam\" (Wilberforce), \"Henry of Exeter\" (Dr. Phillpotts), and Blomfield,\r\nthe Bishop of London.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SERIOUS FLUNKEY: \"I should require, Madam, forty pounds a\r\nyear, two suits of clothes, two 'ats, meat and hale three times a day,\r\nand piety hindispensable.\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Clerical Bugbears_]\r\n\r\nThe wealth, the obscurantism, and the Olympian detachment of the great\r\nprince bishops were a constant source of exasperation and comment.\r\n_Punch_ was a supporter of cheap divorce. He preferred this reform to\r\nthe Bill for flogging wife-beaters, and securing the right of the wife\r\nto keep part of her earnings when separated from a bad husband. The\r\nParliamentary records of the middle 'fifties are full of debates on the\r\nsubject, but one extract from _Punch's_ \"Essence of Parliament\" may\r\nsuffice to illustrate his _nolo episcopari_ attitude:--\r\n\r\n    _Thursday_, June 26th. The Divorce Bill came to the Lords from\r\n    their Select Committee, and Lord Lyndhurst most ably explained its\r\n    present character. What is proposed is this. A new Tribunal for\r\n    deciding upon matrimonial causes. That a divorced woman who\r\n    acquires property shall have it for herself. That she may sue, in\r\n    actions, as a single woman. That a wife shall be placed somewhat\r\n    more upon a footing with a husband as regards the obtaining\r\n    divorce. That in all cases of a husband's infidelity (accompanied\r\n    with cruelty), in certain still worse cases, and in those of\r\n    bigamy, a woman shall be entitled to ask divorce. Lord Lansdowne\r\n    gave eloquent support to the Bill. The Bishop of Oxford (_Mr.\r\n    Punch_ does not misrepresent him, for the Church's stalwart friend,\r\n    the _Standard_, manifests indignant surprise at his Lordship's\r\n    speech) objected to the proposed increased facility of divorce.\r\n    \"The lower classes did not demand the _privilegia_ afforded to the\r\n    higher and wealthier classes.\" The Bishop of St. David's thought\r\n    with Dr. Wilberforce. Lord Campbell, in reply, cited Mr. Justice\r\n    Maule's scorching irony, when a poor man, whose wife had robbed him\r\n    and absconded, had sought to provide his children with a mother,\r\n    and had committed bigamy. The Bishop of Oxford contrived to carry a\r\n    postponement of the next stage of the Bill, which he means to\r\n    \"amend.\" Let the Lords protect the Women of England against the\r\n    Priests.\r\n\r\nIt may be added that _Punch_ was also a supporter of marriage with a\r\ndeceased wife's sister, and that here again he found considerable scope\r\nfor the display of his anti-episcopal animus. When Lord St. Germans'\r\nBill was defeated in the Lords on April 25, 1856, _Punch_ notes that the\r\nresult was chiefly due to \"four priests\"--the Bishops of Oxford, Cashel,\r\nSt. David's and Exeter--and applauds Lord Albemarle, one of the heroes\r\nof Waterloo, for his \"courageous condemnation of clerical intolerance.\"\r\nLord Albemarle, in the course of his speech, made bold to say that \"the\r\nopinions generally expressed by ladies on this subject were attributable\r\nto the ignorance of their spiritual advisers, and to the undue reverence\r\nfor the Common Prayer-book.\" _Punch's_ own reasons for supporting the\r\nchange included the ironical argument that a widower debarred from\r\nrelief, when he remarries takes on a _second_ mother-in-law.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AFFECTIONATE HUSBAND: \"Come, Polly--if I _am_ a little\r\nirritable, it's over in a minute.\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Destitute Clergy_]\r\n\r\nBut _Punch's_ chief objection to the bishops was that they emphasized in\r\nthe most glaring way the contrasts which existed in what was at once the\r\nwealthiest and the poorest of Churches. If the Church was out of touch\r\nwith the lay poor, she was even more open to criticism for her neglect\r\nof her own poor clergy. The scandal of the ragged curates had attracted\r\n_Punch's_ attention in the 'forties. On September 19, 1846, he referred\r\nto the recent death, \"raving mad, in penury and destitution,\" of the\r\nRev. Mr. Kaye, of St. Pancras. A return, procured by the energetic\r\ninquisitiveness of Joseph Hume at the close of 1847, revealed the fact\r\nthat the total number of assistant curates to incumbents resident on\r\ntheir benefices amounted in 1846 to 2,642, and the number licensed to\r\n2,094. Of these 1,192 received stipends _under_ £100 a year, and as many\r\nas 173 _less_ than £50 a year. But the most bitter comment on this\r\nmodern clerical instance of Dives and Lazarus is to be found in an\r\narticle in 1856 on \"Bishops and Curates\":--\r\n\r\n    A curate--\"an Agueish curate\"--wishes to know of _The Times_ if\r\n    curates in general \"may look forward for some provision when age\r\n    and disease have incapacitated them from further labours?\" There is\r\n    disaffection, insolence, in the very question. This curate for\r\n    twenty years folded the sheep of two curacies. \"They were separated\r\n    by a hedgerow,\" and the pastor was \"exposed to the pestilential\r\n    atmosphere of Essex Marshes.\" And the curate sums up the case of\r\n    bishop and curate as below:--\r\n\r\n    \"To a bishop who has had his labours sweetened by all that life can\r\n    give of comfort, luxury, and highest dignity--a palace and £6,000\r\n    per annum.\r\n\r\n    \"To a curate who, for thirty years, shall have done his devoir\r\n    before God and man, till broken with miasmatic fever, or voiceless\r\n    from excess of oral exertion, he is obliged to confess his\r\n    inability to be any longer faithful in his calling--the workhouse.\"\r\n\r\n    And is it not well that it should be so? A curate on £100 a year,\r\n    and shaking with a marsh ague, shaking, and praying, and teaching\r\n    the while, is still a lively representative of the ancient\r\n    Christian, is still a living extract from the New Testament. Now a\r\n    bishop, with £22,000 per annum, and, if shaking, shaking with the\r\n    fat of the land, is, as far as our reading goes, not to be found in\r\n    the volume to which we have reverently alluded.\r\n\r\nIt should be explained that on July 10 in the same year a Bill had been\r\nintroduced in the Lords enabling the Bishops of London and Durham to\r\nresign, and making provision for them:--\r\n\r\n    The annual income of Dr. Blomfield is £10,000 a year, and he has\r\n    enjoyed it for twenty-eight years, having previously had four years\r\n    at Chester with £1,000 a year; total receipt, £284,000. And the\r\n    annual income of Dr. Maltby is £24,000, and he has enjoyed it for\r\n    twenty years, having previously had five years at Chichester with\r\n    £4,000 a year; total receipt, £500,000.\r\n\r\nThe \"Prince Bishops,\" with their princely revenues, have long since\r\ndeparted: nowadays no one charges bishops with indolent opulence. The\r\nscandal of the poor curates and underpaid country clergymen still\r\nremains, but the disparity is not so great. The best paid prelates find\r\nit hard to make both ends meet or to make provision for their families.\r\nSome of them even publish balance-sheets of their receipts and\r\nexpenditure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Punch and \"No Popery\"_]\r\n\r\nIn the domain of doctrine and religious controversy _Punch's_ record is\r\nsomewhat chequered. He was equally antipathetic to High Church and Low\r\nChurch. We have seen what he thought of Exeter Hall. But Pusey and his\r\nfollowers stirred him to even greater wrath. He called the Puseyites\r\n\"Brummagem Papists.\" He saw no beauty or dignity in an advanced ritual,\r\nbut only an absurd and wicked \"playing at religion.\" So when the famous\r\nPapal Brief was published in the autumn of 1850, constituting a Roman\r\nCatholic hierarchy in England and Wales in place of the Vicars\r\nApostolic, followed up by the pastoral from the newly appointed Cardinal\r\nWiseman welcoming the restoration of England to the communion of the\r\nRoman Church, _Punch's_ indignation knew no bounds; he became the most\r\nviolent champion of English Protestantism. In earlier days he had\r\nwelcomed the Liberal political views which Pius IX had expressed in the\r\nopening stages of the _Risorgimento_ movement in Italy, and had printed\r\na laudatory set of verses, headed \"A Health to the Pope,\" in the issue\r\nof February 20, 1847, in which he had congratulated Pio Nono on his\r\nmasculine wisdom, courage, and reforming zeal. His severest censures\r\nwere reserved for the sectarian zealots at home. \"Everybody knows that\r\nthe great obstacle to popular education is the agreement of sects, on\r\nthe one hand, that it is necessary to teach orthodoxy, together with\r\nsecular knowledge, and their inability, on the other, to agree what doxy\r\nis ortho-.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in 1850, when the friends of Church Education met at Willis's\r\nRooms to discuss and protest against the Government's Education Bill, he\r\ndeclared himself a decided opponent of \"National Education upon strictly\r\nChurch principles,\" which, as interpreted by some of the speakers, were\r\n\"indistinguishable from those of the heretic-burners of the\r\nInquisition.\" The cleavage between the various schools, and the narrow\r\nbigotry of all, moved him to an impassioned appeal in which the Gorham\r\ncase, and the secession of Newman, are brought in to reinforce his plea\r\nfor toleration:--\r\n\r\n    O Gentlemen! O Servants of the poor dear Church of England, while\r\n    you are boxing and brawling within the sanctuary, why send forth\r\n    these absurd emissaries to curse the people outside? They don't\r\n    mind your comminations, they are only jeering at your battles....\r\n    The people in this country _will_ learn to read and write; they\r\n    will not let the parsons set their sums and point out their\r\n    lessons, or meddle in all their business of life. And as for your\r\n    outcries about infidelity and atheism, they will laugh at you (as\r\n    long as they keep their temper) and mind you no more than Mumbo\r\n    Jumbo.\r\n\r\nSound doctrine this, but it was all forgotten in the frenzy of the \"No\r\nPopery\" movement a few months later. _Punch_, in a poem on \"Consolation\r\namid Controversy,\" gives thanks that the days of persecution are past:--\r\n\r\n    We've now some sharpish mutual slanging,\r\n    But, Heaven be thanked, there is no hanging!\r\n    No axe, no chopping-block, no drawing,\r\n    But only just a little jawing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    There's no Jack Ketch his business plying,\r\n    People beheading, throttling, frying.\r\n    _Punch_, and he says it without boasting,\r\n    Does all the cutting up and roasting.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the whole of Volume xix. is dominated by the one\r\nsubject. The \"cutting up and roasting\" of the Pope and Cardinal Wiseman,\r\nof Passionists and Puseyites, is conducted on every other page. The\r\nPope's message was \"the greatest bull ever known.\" In \"Pontifical News\"\r\nwe have a series of imaginary appointments, including a Papal Lord\r\nChancellor, miracles and conversions, winding up with the announcement\r\nthat the Palace of Bedlam will be proposed as the residence of the new\r\nPrimate of England. Simultaneously, burlesque rival claims are put\r\nforward on behalf of other creeds--Mohammedan, Buddhist and Brahmin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE THIN END OF THE WEDGE\r\n\r\nDaring Attempt to Break Into a Church]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Cardinal Wiseman_]\r\n\r\nOn November 4 Lord John Russell, then Prime Minister, addressed a letter\r\nto the Bishop of Durham, in which, without pronouncing definitely\r\nwhether the law had been transgressed, he vigorously condemned the Papal\r\nclaims as \"inconsistent with the Queen's supremacy, the rights of our\r\nbishops and clergy, and with the spiritual independence of the nation as\r\nasserted even in Roman Catholic times.\" Lord John confessed, however,\r\nthat he was less alarmed by any aggression of a foreign sovereign than\r\nby the practices of \"clergymen of our own Church, who have been most\r\nforward in leading their flocks, step by step, to the verge of the\r\nprecipice.\" In conclusion he relied with confidence on the people of\r\nEngland, feeling sure that the great mass of a nation \"which looked with\r\ncontempt on the mummeries of superstition\" would be faithful to \"the\r\nglorious principles and the immortal martyrs of the Reformation.\"\r\n_Punch_ lost no time in improving on this text, and in the number of\r\nNovember 16 his \"No Popery\" campaign reached a climax in \"A Short Way\r\nwith the Pope's Puppets.\" _Punch_ had no desire, he declares, to bring\r\nback the days of the hurdle, the halter, the axe and the\r\nquartering-knife. But if a Roman Catholic Pope-appointed Cardinal called\r\nupon the City of Westminster to do him, in the name of Rome, all\r\nspiritual obedience, he would \"immediately seize such Cardinal, try him\r\nfor high treason, and on conviction send him, in convict gray, to the\r\nAntipodes.\" Yet the lines just quoted on \"Consolation amid Controversy\"\r\nappeared a month later, while the anti-Papal crusade was still raging\r\nits way through _Punch's_ columns! The acrimony displayed with pen and\r\npencil was deplorable. In extenuation it can only be pleaded that\r\n_Punch_ was following the lead of the Premier, and not misinterpreting\r\nthe sentiments of a very large section of the community as exhibited in\r\naddresses to the Crown, county meetings and other demonstrations.\r\nCardinal Wiseman's conciliatory statement, in which he maintained that\r\nthe proposed change had been adopted \"for the more regular\r\nadministration of the Roman Catholic Church of England, and only at the\r\nrequest of English communicants,\" left _Punch_ cold and derisive. He\r\nsuggests that as a counterblast to the Pope the Queen should be prayed\r\nto create Mazzini President of Rome. In the \"Bull\" fight of London, in\r\n\"Fashions Papal and Puseyite,\" in the comparison between aggressive\r\nPapists and Cuffey, the transported Chartist--very much to the advantage\r\nof the latter--in satiric comments on Romanist interpretation of\r\nhistory, in repulsive caricatures of slinking, intrusive priests,\r\n_Punch_ continued to heap odium and ridicule on the Papal claims. He was\r\nmore than a little wrathful with the _Morning Chronicle_ for asserting\r\nthat in the \"No Popery\" crusade \"the tide of opinion is already turned.\"\r\nBut the _Morning Chronicle_ was not far out, and it is noteworthy that\r\nfrom this point onwards _Punch's_ attacks were chiefly directed against\r\nPuseyites and Ritualists--such as Mr. Bennett, the vicar of St.\r\nBarnabas, Pimlico--and Tractarians, of whom he wrote:--\r\n\r\n    Rome, Rome, sweet sweet Rome,\r\n    For all us Tractarians, there's no place like Rome.\r\n\r\nCardinal Wiseman did not \"take it lying down,\" but retaliated vigorously\r\non _Punch_ in the _Dublin Review_, denouncing his opponent as once\r\nfacetious, but now old, drivelling, and malignant, \"down to his old\r\nstreet occupation of playing the hangman,\" and ironically complimented\r\nhim on the concession, in his letter to Lord John Russell, of commuting\r\nthe capital punishment of offending Roman Catholic bishops to mere\r\ntransportation for life. _Punch_ promptly hit back, but he did not get\r\nthe better of the exchange. Wiseman was a skilful controversialist; he\r\nwas also an extremely accomplished and learned man, a considerable\r\nOrientalist, and much in request as a lecturer on social, artistic and\r\nliterary topics. Of this side of the Cardinal there is no trace in\r\n_Punch's_ pages, least of all in the cartoons and portraits, in which he\r\nis represented as a man of gross, plebeian and repulsive appearance. If,\r\nas is generally believed, Wiseman was the original of Browning's Bishop\r\nBlougram, the poet took him more seriously. Browning's portrait is\r\ncertainly not flattering, but he put into the bishop's mouth a saying\r\nwhich probably represented the Cardinal's view of _Punch_ accurately in\r\nthe verse:--\r\n\r\n    You, for example, clever to a fault,\r\n    The rough and ready man, who write apace,\r\n    Read somewhat seldomer, think perhaps even less.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion was divided and unexpected convergences were\r\nrevealed--illustrated, to take only one instance, by _Punch's_ satirical\r\npicture of John Bright embracing Wiseman. But in the heat of the\r\ncontroversy _Punch_ showed refreshing signs of good sense and good\r\nfeeling, and sternly rebukes the precursors of the \"Kensitites,\" who\r\nmade a vulgar demonstration, in which the ringleader masqueraded as a\r\nmock Pope outside Wiseman's house. \"To play the fool about the street on\r\nbehalf of Protestantism can only discredit it.\" Still, the Pope and\r\nWiseman remained the targets of _Punch's_ obloquy for several years.\r\nOxford he regarded as \"the halfway house to Rome.\" Indeed, one is\r\ntempted to sum up his views in an adaptation of an old rhyme:--\r\n\r\n    Roman dictation is my vexation;\r\n      Oxford is just as bad;\r\n    Papal aggression is my obsession,\r\n      And Pusey drives me mad.\r\n\r\nIn \"Roman Candles in Hampshire\" we find him attacking Keble's ritual at\r\nHursley. This was in February, 1852, and when the _Tablet_ attributed\r\nthe riots and loss of life at Stockport to the Government's proclamation\r\n\"against processions, vestments, and the free exercise of the Catholic\r\nreligion,\" charged the Ministers responsible with planning murder, and\r\ndescribed the Queen's speech as \"a vile and hypocritical document,\"\r\n_Punch_ replied to the editor that \"we, the mass of Englishmen, look\r\nupon your viperine expectorations with simple antipathy and disgust.\" A\r\nbitter cartoon on the interference of Irish priests at elections\r\nfollowed up this exchange of opinions; not more bitter, however, than\r\nthe repeated onslaughts on Canon Moore, the Anglican pluralist registrar\r\nof the Prerogative Court of Canterbury, who drew £13,000 a year,\r\naccording to _Punch_, yet doing nothing to earn it. The controversy died\r\ndown during the Crimean War, and then, four years elapsing, the Clapham\r\nEvangelicals are rebuked for the \"profane vulgarity and sanctified\r\nslang\" of their campaign against the Redemptionist Fathers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A More Tolerant Spirit_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PET PARSON]\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the period under review in this volume _Punch_ shows a\r\nslightly more tolerant spirit to Papists. Exeter Hall and the bigots who\r\nstrove for a renewal of the Protestant ascendancy in Ireland, which they\r\nconsidered had been imperilled by the Maynooth Grant, are frequently\r\nrebuked for this intolerance; and he went so far as to say, _à propos_\r\nof the persistent activities of the United Kingdom Alliance, that, \"Of\r\nall Popery, that which threatens to 'rob a poor man of his beer' is the\r\nmost objectionable and most atrociously subversive of the liberty of the\r\nBritish subject.\" The sting of the remark was not lessened by the fact\r\nthat the honorary secretary of the Alliance in question was a Mr.\r\nSamuel Pope, and _Punch_, unable to resist a pun, observes that there is\r\n\"one important difference between this present Papal aggression and that\r\nof this time six years. There was at least one Wiseman engaged in the\r\nformer, whereas the parties to the latter are all of them fools.\" At the\r\nclose of the year we come across the first mention of Spurgeon--by no\r\nmeans complimentary. _Punch_, who suggests him as a fit model for Madame\r\nTussaud, who \"makes dolls of our idols,\" regarded the Nonconformist\r\npreacher, already famous at the age of twenty-three, as a mere\r\nself-advertising jocular charlatan, a \"sacred creature at thousands of\r\ntea-tables,\" a \"dealer in brimstone with plenty of treacle.\" _Punch_, as\r\nwill be seen, had no liking for the \"pets of the pulpit,\" whose\r\nportraits were even more in evidence at the print-sellers' shops than\r\nthose of favourite actors. The \"histrionic pulpit\" was \"worse than the\r\nstage at its worst,\" and he admonishes Spurgeon to dispense with these\r\naids to popularity.\r\n\r\nTo resume and sum up, the outlook on Church and State of a very large\r\nbody of public opinion, from that of the Liberal Prime Minister to the\r\nman in the street, is reflected in the pages of _Punch_. Where doctrinal\r\ncontroversies are concerned we find a complete accordance with the\r\nsentiments of \"Hang Theology\" Rogers, the late rector of Bishopsgate. We\r\nfind a complete inability to appreciate a bishop such as \"Henry of\r\nExeter,\" who was prepared to spend--and lose--scores of thousands of\r\npounds in litigation to establish his views on baptismal regeneration.\r\nWe find continuous onslaughts on Pluralism, Sinecurism, Mediævalism,\r\nSectarianism, and, above all, Sabbatarianism. _Punch_ made no effort to\r\ndisguise his satisfaction when the \"Exeter Hallites,\" as a result of\r\ntheir campaign against the Maynooth Grant, were landed in serious\r\nfinancial troubles, and appealed for relief to discharge their debts.\r\n\"How,\" he asks, \"can people have the conscience to ask for charity of\r\nothers who have so little of it themselves?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE POLITICAL TOPSY\r\n\r\n\"I 'spects nobody can't do nothin' with me.\"--_Vide Uncle Tom's Cabin._]\r\n\r\nOn April 26 of this same year of 1845 _Punch_ castigated the violence of\r\nthe Duke of Newcastle, Colonel Sibthorp, Plumptre and other opponents of\r\nthe Maynooth Grant Bill, notably a certain Sir Culling Eardley Smith,\r\nwho declared that \"the British Lion was now aroused and would not rest\r\nagain until he had devoured every atom of Popery,\" and that he knew of\r\n\"at least twelve men in Parliament who would die on the floor of the\r\nHouse sooner than that the Bill should pass into law.\" If _Punch_ showed\r\nhimself almost as violent, if not as ridiculous as this Protestant\r\ngladiator, let it be remembered that, as a convinced believer in the\r\nBritish Constitution and the principles of the Reformation, he regarded\r\nthe Papal claims as an attempt to set up an _imperium in imperio_.\r\nCatholic emancipation he firmly supported, but this was another matter.\r\nHis misgivings were unfounded, but there is no reason to doubt his\r\nhonesty or that of those who felt as he did. It was part of the same\r\ninsularity, often prompted by a sound instinct, which led him to look\r\nwith disfavour on foreigners and foreign ways as likely, if encouraged,\r\nto denationalize the British fibre. To this we may also attribute his\r\nearly distrust and suspicion of Disraeli. Nor was it to be wondered at,\r\nin view of the admissions of his biographers:--\r\n\r\n    The fundamental fact about Disraeli was that he was a Jew. He\r\n    accepted Christianity, but he accepted it as the highest\r\n    development of Judaism. He had inherited from his father a profound\r\n    interest in English history, literature, society and tradition,\r\n    which his own reading and experience had deepened. But he seemed\r\n    throughout his life never to be quite of the nation which he loved,\r\n    served and governed; always to be a little detached when in the act\r\n    of leading; always to be the spectator, almost the critic, as well\r\n    as the principal performer. \"No Englishman,\" writes Greenwood,\r\n    \"could approach Disraeli without some immediate consciousness that\r\n    he was in the presence of a foreigner.\"[9]\r\n\r\nNow _Punch_ was intensely English; he saw no need for \"Oriental mystery\"\r\nin politics, and considered Disraeli's adoption by the country gentlemen\r\nas little short of an unholy alliance. Dizzy's flamboyant and exotic\r\ntastes were a constant source of offence. Nothing better illustrates\r\nthis habit of mind, which was by no means peculiar to _Punch_, than the\r\npart played by the paper during the 'forties and 'fifties in the long\r\nand chequered movement in favour of removing Jewish disabilities. A\r\nmanly desire to give the Jews fair play was tempered by strong\r\nprejudice. As we have seen, _Punch_ frankly admitted the Jews' great\r\nvirtue, their care for their poor, and held it up as an example to the\r\n\"Exeter Hallites,\" who thought that charity must begin abroad. At the\r\nsame time he held the Jews largely responsible for the worst side of the\r\ncheap clothing trade, witness his bitter verses on \"Moses & Co.\" in\r\n1844.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: _Life of Disraeli_ (Monypenny and Buckle), Vol. vi., p.\r\n635.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Punch and the Jews_]\r\n\r\n_Punch's_ jests at the expense of the Jews were not always so excusable\r\nas in the case of Messrs. Moses and \"Sholomansh\"; they were sometimes\r\npurely malicious, as when a design for a monument to Disraeli at\r\nShrewsbury took the form of a column of discarded hats; or, again, when\r\nthe announcement that the University of Oxford intended to confer on him\r\nthe honorary degree of D.C.L., _Punch_ was prompted to remark that the\r\ninitials stood for \"Deuced Clever Levite.\" The strange passage in\r\nDisraeli's \"Life of Lord George Bentinck,\" foreshadowing the rôle of\r\nworld revolutionaries assigned to the Jews in the recent much discussed\r\nJewish Protocol, did not escape _Punch's_ notice, and his comment is\r\ncharacteristic:--\r\n\r\n    Well! The Jews, it seems, are conscious of their ill-treatment.\r\n    _They_ join Secret Societies. _They_ (for the evils complained of\r\n    by the Barbarians have nothing to do with it; their leaders are\r\n    nobodies) topple over thrones with delight. Bless us, what a\r\n    picture! And what does it suggest? Now we know why Shadrach is a\r\n    Sheriff's Officer! \"_All is race._\" What a picture of cool\r\n    malignity is this! Shadrach taps us on the shoulder with a fiendish\r\n    luxury, and exults in dragging off the Northern Barbarian. He\r\n    luxuriates in locking up the Frank in a sponging-house; he charges\r\n    him for the \"Semitic Element,\" and sticks it on to the chop and\r\n    sherry.\r\n\r\nWas _Punch_ an anti-Semite? The answer is to be found in his unwavering,\r\nif not always very courteous or respectful, support of Baron Rothschild\r\nin his eleven years' struggle to enter the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nBaron Rothschild's anomalous position and his persistence in demanding\r\nrelief recalled to _Punch_ Martin Luther's saying of the Jews: \"They\r\nsit as on a wheelbarrow, without a country, a people, or a Government.\"\r\nThis, adds _Punch_, was said 350 years ago, and the Jew is on the\r\nwheelbarrow still.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GENTLEMAN IN DIFFICULTIES\r\n\r\nLORD JOHN: \"It's impossible for our House to let you have that little\r\nmatter now. But you can have a Bill payable next Session, if you like.\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Jewish Disabilities_]\r\n\r\nRothschild, elected as Whig Member for the City of London, and\r\nre-elected in 1852, 1854, and twice in 1857, was still refused\r\npermission to take part in the privileges of the House, though allowed\r\nto sit below the Bar, and remain there when notice was taken of\r\nstrangers. In all, _nine_ Bills giving the Jews relief had been passed\r\nby the Commons since 1830 and rejected by the Lords, before the tenth,\r\nand last, introduced by Lord John Russell in 1858, led to a compromise\r\nunder which each House was enabled to determine the form in which the\r\noath should be taken by its members. On July 26, 1858, Baron\r\nRothschild's \"barrow\" was removed, and he was permitted to swear the\r\noath of allegiance in the Jewish form and take his seat. To Lord John\r\nRussell belonged the chief credit for carrying through this reform and\r\nabating a crying scandal, but undoubtedly _Punch_ lent him valuable\r\nfree-lance help throughout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM PEACE TO WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the 'forties _Punch_, as we have already noted, stood in with \"the\r\ngroup of middle-class men of enthusiasm and sagacity\" whose leaders in\r\nParliament were Cobden and Bright. Their views were from the first\r\nstrongly anti-militaristic, and were shared up to a certain point by\r\n_Punch_. In his early years he was, with some reserves, distinctly\r\npacificist. If by 1854 he was a whole-hearted supporter of the Crimean\r\nWar, it was not due to any change of _personnel_. The gentle Doyle\r\nresigned because of _Punch's_ \"No Popery\" campaign. Thackeray severed\r\nhis connexion with the paper because of its attacks on Palmerston, the\r\nPrince Consort and Louis Napoleon. But the men who dominated the policy\r\nof _Punch_ in his ultra-humanitarian days remained when he was most\r\nbellicose. Leech, who drew the \"Home of the Rick-burner,\" was\r\nresponsible for \"General Février\" and the Crimean and Mutiny cartoons.\r\nMark Lemon was still editor, Douglas Jerrold and Gilbert à Beckett were\r\nhis right hand men and most voluminous contributors. It was a\r\nconversion, if you like, but it was not dictated by expediency, nor did\r\nit involve a sacrifice of conviction or a desertion of the cause of the\r\nunderdog. It was partly due to a John Bullish resentment of anything\r\nsavouring of foreign aggression or intervention. Along with all his\r\ncriticisms of Palmerston's Parliamentary opportunism, _Punch_ gave \"the\r\njudicious bottle-holder\" credit for keeping us out of wars by his\r\nstiffness. _Punch_ supported Cobden and Bright in the battle over the\r\nCorn Laws, but distrusted and thoroughly disapproved of the attitude of\r\nthe Manchester School towards the reform of the conditions of\r\nLabour--witness his \"Few words with John Bright\" over the Factory Act of\r\n1847. Above all, he could not stomach the over-candid friend who\r\ninvariably sided against his country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"GENERAL FÉVRIER\" TURNED TRAITOR\r\n\r\n\"Russia has two Generals in whom she can confide--Generals Janvier and\r\nFévrier.\"--_Speech of the late Emperor of Russia._]\r\n\r\nWith this much by way of preface we may note that the anti-militaristic\r\ntirades of these early years are mainly directed against the needless\r\npomp and pageantry, expense and extravagance of the services. _Punch's_\r\ncampaign against duelling is another matter, and here at least he never\r\nrecanted his detestation of \"the law of the pistol.\" He did not spare\r\neven the Duke of Wellington, but made sarcastic reference to his meeting\r\nwith Lord Winchilsea in 1843, and in his cartoon represented the\r\nprincipals wearing frock-coats and fool's caps. There is an indignant\r\nletter to Peel the following March, when that statesman refused to bring\r\nin a Bill against duelling, or to reprimand the Irish Attorney-General\r\nfor challenging in open court the opposing counsel in the O'Connell\r\ntrial; and when Peel further declined to grant a pension to the widow of\r\nColonel Fawcett, a distinguished officer who lost his life in a duel,\r\nthis refusal prompted a famous cartoon a fortnight later, accompanied by\r\nthis vitriolic comment:--\r\n\r\n    If a statue be ever erected to the living honour or the memory of\r\n    Sir Robert Peel, the artist will wholly fail in his illustration of\r\n    the true greatness of the statesman unless he deck the bronze with\r\n    widow's cap and weepers. In the long and sinuous career of the\r\n    noble baronet, we know of nothing equal to his denial of a pension\r\n    to Mrs. Fawcett, and, almost in the same week, his speech in favour\r\n    of the \"laws of honour\" as they exist. In one hand does the Prime\r\n    Minister hold the scales of justice, and in the other a\r\n    duelling-pistol!\r\n\r\n_Punch's_ remedy for the evasion of the law was to let the principals go\r\nfree, but to hang the seconds without hesitation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LAW OF THE PISTOL.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Punch as Pacifist_]\r\n\r\nThe choice of the Army as a profession is discussed in one of the series\r\nnamed \"The Complete Letter-writer,\" which appeared in 1844. Mr. Benjamin\r\nAllpeace, guardian to young Arthur Baytwig, pronounces against it as a\r\ngilded fraud. At best soldiers are evils of the earth, and the pomp and\r\npageantry of war mere gimcrackery. The reality is \"misery and anguish,\r\nblood and tears.\" This was the year in which the Prince de Joinville,\r\nLouis Philippe's third son, after bombarding Tangier and occupying\r\nMogador, made himself notorious by his bellicose pamphleteering; but\r\n_Punch_ was equally severe on Lord Maidstone for his patriotic rhymes in\r\nthe _Morning Post_, and on the warlike philanthropists of Exeter Hall,\r\nwho were much exercised by the Prince's ill-will towards Great Britain.\r\n_Punch_, prohibited in France not for the first or last time for his\r\ncomments on French politics, ridiculed the Chauvinists on both sides\r\nwith impartial satire, and published a \"Woman's Plea for Peace with\r\nFrance\" on the ground of our debt to that country in wine, fashion, the\r\nballet, Jullien (the popular musician and conductor resident in London,\r\nwho would have to flee in case of war), and cosmetics. Later on, in the\r\nsame year, we come across \"Entente Cordiale\" cartoons, in which _Punch_\r\nassumes the rôle of the pacificator of Europe, and a letter to French\r\neditors protesting against the notion that John Bull is a plotter.\r\n_Punch_ had already given a half serious support to Captain Warner, the\r\neccentric inventor, who professed to have invented a long-range\r\ninvisible shell to blow up ships at a distance, hailing it as a means of\r\nending war, and developed the argument further in a curious article on\r\nthe \"Science of Warfare,\" _à propos_ of the benevolent object of some\r\ninventors at Fulham. Their aim, it seems, was to put an end to war by\r\nmaking it so truly terrific that, as in the classic example of the\r\nKilkenny cats, it would terminate its own existence by its very\r\nferocity. Thus do we find in the mid 'forties a foreshadowing of the\r\nsinister uses of applied science and a justification of the doctrine of\r\n\"frightfulness.\" In 1845, in connexion with the intended reorganization\r\nor calling out of the Militia, we find the first of many satirical\r\nreferences to the famous Brook Green Volunteer--Brook Green being \"one\r\nof the bolts of the great Gate of London,\" as Hammersmith was the key to\r\nthe metropolis on the western side. _Punch_ at this time was a bitter\r\ncritic of the methods of recruiting, and his anti-militaristic zeal\r\nreached a climax in a protest against the advertisements used at\r\nBirmingham and elsewhere, in which he calls the recruiting sergeant \"the\r\nclown in the bloody pantomime of glory.\" He had already fallen foul of\r\nSir Charles Napier for his defence of the \"cat\" in 1844. The issue of\r\nAugust 15, 1846, contains a personal appeal to the Queen to abolish\r\nflogging in the Army. Here is the last stanza of \"Lines on the Lash: to\r\nthe Queen\":--\r\n\r\n    Let thy queenly voice be heard--\r\n      Who shall dare to disobey?--\r\n    It but costs thy Royal word,\r\n      And the lash is cast away.\r\n    With thyself it rests to scour\r\n      From our arms the loathsome stain;\r\n    Then of mercy show thy power,\r\n      And immortal be thy reign!\r\n\r\nThis may not be great poetry, but doggerel verse can be simple and\r\npassionate. The appeal was not granted until 1881.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SILLY TRICK\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL: \"Come, come, you foolish fellow; you don't suppose I'm to be\r\nfrightened by such a turnip as that!\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Invasion Scare_]\r\n\r\nIn 1848 the French invasion scare was in full swing, but _Punch_\r\nmaintained an attitude of satirical scepticism. Impetus was lent to the\r\nalarm by the letter of Lord Ellesmere to _The Times_, and by the letter\r\nof the Duke of Wellington. These were welcomed by _Punch_ as a\r\nletting-off of alarmist steam. \"Folks who feared an invasion, authorized\r\nby Lord Ellesmere and the Duke of Wellington, have said their say, have\r\ncontributed their quota to absurdity, and, satisfied with the effect,\r\nmay now rest content for life.\" In the same vein the suggestion of the\r\nformation of a National Guard who should train and practise shooting on\r\nSundays provokes sarcastic comment on this new form of \"Sunday balls.\"\r\nThe enrolment of Special Constables, as a precaution against the\r\nviolence of the \"physical force\" extremists among the Chartists, is a\r\nfrequent theme of comment generally jocular and unsympathetic.\r\n\r\nEngland's immunity from the general upheaval made for optimism. Cobden\r\nin 1848 and 1849 was still in favour with _Punch_ as the \"cleverest Cob\"\r\nin England and the apostle of \"Peace, Retrenchment, and Reform.\" His\r\nArbitration Motion in the latter year met with _Punch's_ cordial\r\napproval:--\r\n\r\n    PEACE AND WAR IN PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\n    Mr. Cobden took a businesslike view of the question, and by the\r\n    practicability of his notions obtained the expressed\r\n    goodwill--could more be expected?--of the Prime Minister and the\r\n    Foreign Secretary. For ourselves, we entirely accord with the\r\n    position of Mr. Cobden, and have a most cheerful faith in the\r\n    ultimate prosperity of his doctrines, for they are mingling\r\n    themselves with the best thoughts of the people, who are every day\r\n    more and more assured that whatever may be the cause of war, they\r\n    are the first sacrificed for it; it is they who pay the cost. Just\r\n    as the sheep is stripped of his skin for the noisy barbarous drum,\r\n    to beat the lie of glory, so are the people stripped to pay for the\r\n    music.\r\n\r\n    The romance of one era is the reality of the next. The Arbitration\r\n    Question has taken root, and will grow and spread. They show a\r\n    cedar in the gardens at Paris--a cedar of hugest girth and widest\r\n    shape--that, some century ago, was brought from Lebanon in the cap\r\n    of a traveller. The olive twig, planted by Mr. Cobden in\r\n    Westminster, will flourish despite the blighting wit of mess-rooms,\r\n    and rise and spread into a tree that shall offer shade and security\r\n    to all nations.\r\n\r\nIn a similar vein is the welcome extended to the Peace Congress in\r\nParis:--\r\n\r\n    THE PARLIAMENT OF PEACE IN PARIS\r\n\r\n    Anyway, the cause of peace has been reverently preached, and\r\n    reverently listened to, in the warlike city of Paris. Within a walk\r\n    of the tomb of the great peace-breaker--who turned kingdoms into\r\n    graves, and whose miserable purple was dyed in the heart's blood of\r\n    human freedom--even there peace has been worshipped. Napoleon in\r\n    his violet robe--beset with golden bees--the bees that, as in the\r\n    lion of the olden day, swarmed in carcases--Napoleon, with his\r\n    Pope-blessed crown clipping his homicidal brain, is, after all, a\r\n    portentous, glistering evil--contrasted with our Quaker friend\r\n    [Joseph Sturge], who, risen in the Hall of St. Cecilia, condemns\r\n    aggressive war as an abomination, a nuisance that it behoves man,\r\n    in this season of his soul's progress, with all his heart and all\r\n    his mind, to denounce and renounce as un-Christian, vile, and\r\n    brutifying. The drab against the purple; and, in our small\r\n    thoughts, the drab, so preaching, carries it.\r\n\r\nSo, again, _Punch_ breaks a lance in defence of the Peace Congress in\r\nthe year 1850 at Frankfort. What if it were inspired by visionary aims?\r\nAll great reformers, idealists and benefactors--Harvey, Jenner,\r\nStephenson--had been ridiculed by unthinking and unimaginative\r\ncritics:--\r\n\r\n    TO THE LAUGHERS\r\n\r\n    The Peace Congress is a capital joke. It's so obvious a subject for\r\n    fun that we haven't thought it worth while to waste a laugh on it.\r\n    All manner of pens have been poking the public in the ribs about\r\n    it--paper pellets of all colours and weights have been slung at\r\n    it--arrows from all quivers have been emptied on its vulnerable\r\n    sides.\r\n\r\n    \"Preach Peace to the World!\" The poor noodles! \"Inculcate the\r\n    supremacy of right over might!\" Ineffable milk-and-water spoonies!\r\n    \"Hold out to nations brotherhood for warfare, the award of justice\r\n    instead of the bayonet!\" The white-faced, lily-livered prigs!\r\n\r\n    \"Why, it's the merest Utopianism,\" says the _Economist_.\r\n\r\n    \"It's neither more nor less than Christianity,\" sneers the\r\n    _Statist_; \"Trade is the peace-maker,\" says the Doctor of the\r\n    Manchester School; \"Diplomacy keeps the world quiet,\" jocularly\r\n    declares the Red-tapist; \"Peace indeed, the designing democrat!\"\r\n    growls the Absolutist; \"Peace, with a bloated Aristocracy still\r\n    rampant!\" snarls the Red Republican. And they all drown in a chorus\r\n    of contemptuous laughter the pleading voices of the poor Peace\r\n    Congressists in the Church of St. Paul.\r\n\r\n    But there are some voices which refuse to join in this chorus. And\r\n    there are some, too, of the wise and the great who can discern in\r\n    this gathering of friends of peace, this little Babel of various\r\n    tongues, this tiny congress of many races, a thing in no way to be\r\n    ridiculed any more than the acorn is to be ridiculed when Science\r\n    declares that its heart contains the Oak.\r\n\r\nThe pacificist note had already been sounded when the Duke of Wellington\r\npublicly declared in 1849 that it was time ignorance should cease in the\r\nArmy, on which _Punch_ remarked \"When the aforesaid ignorance ceases,\r\nhow long will the British Army last?\" And in the same year, while\r\ncondemning the Government for refusing to pay for enlarging the National\r\nGallery, he protested against the Naval Estimates as past a joke \"when\r\n£158,000 might be spent on a frigate including her total loss at sea.\"\r\nOn naval matters _Punch_ foretold many things, but he did not foresee\r\nthe advent or predict the cost of the super-Dreadnought. Indeed, if the\r\ntruth be told, he was extremely sceptical as to the efficiency of\r\nironclads at all. They were \"ferreous freaks\": vessels \"made in\r\nfoundries were sure to founder.\" He is on safer ground altogether when\r\nhe assails with great spirit and caustic irony the refusal of the\r\nAdmiralty in 1850 to admit naval surgeons to the wardroom, and\r\nproclaimed in vehement accents that he was \"made positively ill\" by the\r\narguments of those who opposed Captain Boldero's proposals. The status\r\nand dignity of Army and Navy doctors and surgeons were near to his\r\nheart, and he scornfully resented the view that while \"glory may be\r\nwritten on a drum head, it is not to be put down on lint.\"\r\n\r\nThe turning point at which _Punch's_ pacificist zeal began to cool was\r\nreached in 1849, and the change grew out of a generous sympathy with\r\nItaly and Hungary. The repeated warnings addressed by Palmerston to\r\nAustria, the independent action which so often embarrassed his\r\ncolleagues and annoyed his Sovereign, and his support of Turkey in\r\nrefusing to surrender Kossuth (though he subsequently repudiated any\r\nresponsibility for his welcome in England), were warmly praised by\r\n_Punch_, who welcomed his declaration as a \"bugle note.\" In 1850 _Punch_\r\nwaxed humorous at the expense of Sir Francis Head, who wrote a book in\r\nwhich he demonstrated that 150,000 Frenchmen could invade London with\r\nthe greatest ease. The _coup d'ètat_ of 1851, and suspicion of the aims\r\nof Louis Napoleon, whom _Punch_ described as a \"perjured homicide,\"\r\nconverted him into a supporter of rifle clubs as \"patriotic and\r\nneedful.\" The Russell Cabinet fell over the Local Militia Bill,\r\nPalmerston carrying an amendment which omitted the word \"local\" from the\r\ntitle of the Bill, so as to make the Militia generally available as an\r\nArmy Reserve. Palmerston had already resigned, or been dismissed, for\r\nexceeding his functions as Foreign Minister by expressing his private\r\napproval of the policy of Louis Napoleon, but in spite of this _Punch_\r\nregretted the loss of the strong man of the Cabinet. The year 1852\r\nopened in gloom and misgiving, faithfully reflected in the lines on\r\n\"Retrospect and Prospect: or 1851 and 1852,\" with their picture of the\r\nanxious vigil of England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING\r\n\r\n\"I'm very sorry, Palmerston, that you cannot agree with your\r\nfellow-servants; but as I don't feel inclined to part with John, you\r\nmust go, of course.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Defence not defiance\" is the keynote of the appeal, \"Speak, Mr.\r\nCobden!\" but it foreshadowed a cleavage which was soon to develop into\r\nbitter antagonism:--\r\n\r\n    Armaments useless our money to spend on,\r\n      Certainly we should be acting like geese;\r\n    _But_ have we any sure ground to depend on,\r\n      In trusting our neighbours will leave us at peace?\r\n                                  Speak, Mr. Cobden!\r\n\r\nThe services of Volunteer Rifle Corps were accepted by the Government,\r\nand _Punch_ (who was extremely satirical at the expense of the Oxford\r\nUniversity authorities for discouraging the O.U.R.C.) can fairly claim\r\nto have been the inventor of _camouflage_ on the strength of the\r\nfollowing suggestions as to equipment. Under the heading of \"Safety\r\nUniforms\" the reader finds:--\r\n\r\n    In accordance with the practical suggestions of several\r\n    distinguished military officers, and others, care has been taken to\r\n    provide a great variety of patterns and uniforms, the colours of\r\n    which, assimilating to every conceivable shade of surrounding\r\n    objects, cause the wearer to present as indistinct a mark as\r\n    possible to the enemy's aim. Besides the neutral greys\r\n    corresponding to the mixed colours of the heath, and the brown\r\n    mixture identical with the colour of the mud, samples have been\r\n    manufactured of slate-colour and brick-dust red, calculated for\r\n    house-top service amongst the chimney pots, of bright green with\r\n    mother-of-pearl and gilt buttons intermingled, adapted for field\r\n    fighting in case of an invasion occurring at the time of the\r\n    daisies and buttercups, of straw colour for a harvest or stubble\r\n    brigade, and of snowy white, which would be a suitable tint if we\r\n    were to be attacked simultaneously by the foe and the frost. A\r\n    splendid pattern has also been made of cloth of gold and silver,\r\n    the dazzling effect of which under a glare of sunshine, in the\r\n    midst of a Turneresque landscape, would be such as utterly to\r\n    bewilder the aim of the most expert marksman. All these wonderful\r\n    uniforms, warranted incapable of being hit, besides a regulation\r\n    rifle guaranteed never to miss, to be had at Messrs. Punch and\r\n    Co.'s, Army Clothiers, 85, Fleet Street, where every species of\r\n    Gentlemanlike Dressing is supplied to those requiring a superior\r\n    article and good cut.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Death of \"The Duke\"_]\r\n\r\nThe challenge to Cobden to declare himself soon gave place to direct\r\nattacks on the pacificists, and the death of the Duke of Wellington gave\r\n_Punch_ a fresh text on which to expound the doctrine of preparation.\r\n\r\nRENDERING UP THE SWORD\r\n\r\n    Our Arthur sleeps--our Arthur is not dead.\r\n      Excalibar shall yet leap from the sheath,\r\n    Should e'er invading foot this England tread--\r\n      Upstirring, then, his marble tomb beneath.\r\n\r\n    Our Wellington's undying fire shall burn\r\n      Through all our veins--until the foeman say,\r\n    \"Behold, their Arthur doth to life return!\"\r\n      And awestruck from the onset shrink away.\r\n\r\nMoreover, _Punch_ defends the martial pageantry at the Duke's funeral at\r\nthis juncture on the ground that it served to show to \"Continental\r\ndespots and bigots with what enthusiasm we yet honour military heroism;\r\nthat if we have abjured the life of strife, we have not renounced the\r\nspirit of valour.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ABERDEEN SMOKING THE PIPE OF PEACE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ITINERANT NEWSMAN, No. 1: \"I say, Bill, what are you\r\ngivin' 'em?\"\r\n\r\nDITTO, No. 2: \"Grand Massacre of the French, and Terrible Slaughter of\r\nthe British Troops.\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Outbreak of War_]\r\n\r\nThroughout 1852 and 1853 there is a steady _crescendo_ of hostility in\r\nthe references to Cobden, Bright and the Quaker pacificists. In this,\r\nboth pen and pencil are wielded with aim and purpose, as evidenced in\r\nthe cartoon \"No danger,\" and the verses in \"Ephraim Smug.\" In the\r\nRusso-Turkish quarrel _Punch's_ long and consistent distrust--to put it\r\nmildly--of the Tsar Nicholas was the governing factor which determined\r\nhim to espouse the side of the Porte, inspired his cartoons \"Turkey in\r\nDanger\" and \"Paws off, Bruin,\" and, most astonishing of all, reconciled\r\nhim, though most reluctantly, to the alliance with his _bête noire_, the\r\nEmperor Napoleon III. For when war came in the spring of 1854 the\r\npredictions and misgivings of alarmists and prophets were falsified, and\r\nGreat Britain was arrayed not against but on the side of France. In the\r\ninterval dividing the outbreak of hostilities between Russia and Turkey\r\nfrom Great Britain's declaration of war on March 28, 1854, _Punch_ threw\r\nall his weight into the balance with the War party in the Cabinet, and\r\nbitterly resented the alleged pro-Russian sympathies of Lord Aberdeen.\r\nThese are hinted at in the cartoon in which the Prime Minister is shown\r\nwith the British Lion saying \"I must let him go,\" and are unmistakably\r\nindicated in the charges against Lord Aberdeen of blacking the Tsar's\r\nboots, and prosecuting the war in a dilatory and half-hearted way. The\r\nManchester School and the \"Pilgrimage to Russia\" of the deputation from\r\nthe Society of Friends to carry to the Tsar their protest against the\r\nwar are severely handled. On the other hand belief in the righteousness\r\nof our cause did not blind _Punch_ to the negligence and worse of those\r\ncharged with the conduct of military operations and the equipment of our\r\nforces. He regrets the typical English attitude, in regard to\r\npreparations, that the whole thing was \"rather a bore.\" The need of\r\norganized efficiency is preached in every number, and, above all, the\r\ndebt of honour owed by the nation to the rank and file of our fighting\r\nmen and to their dependents. Quite early in the war we find this\r\nexcellent plea on behalf of \"The girls they leave behind them\":--\r\n\r\n    It is to be hoped that \"A Naval Officer,\" writing in _The Times_,\r\n    will not vainly have called attention to the position in which the\r\n    wives of soldiers will be placed by the departure of their husbands\r\n    on foreign service for the defence of Europe and mankind against\r\n    the enemy Nicholas. As to the soldier's pay, he half starves upon\r\n    it himself, and after his semi-starvation there remains not the\r\n    value of a crumb to be handed over to his wife and perhaps\r\n    children. The girl--and, maybe, the little girls and boys--left by\r\n    him have surely a claim superior to that of the mate and progeny of\r\n    the lazy clown and the sottish and improvident mechanic. It is just\r\n    that relief should be dealt out to them with no parochial hand, but\r\n    with a palm a little wider open than that of the relieving officer,\r\n    and in a spirit of consideration somewhat more kindly than the\r\n    beadle's.\r\n\r\nThe \"Soldier's Dream\" of the kind lady who came to visit his wife and\r\nchildren is an appeal to translate the vision into reality. And there\r\nwere other grievances. The breakdown of the postal service to the seat\r\nof war and the injustice of making the recipients pay 2s. for each\r\nletter are shown up in \"Dead Letters from the Baltic.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Song of the Nightingale_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOUNDED SOLDIERS AND NIGHTINGALES]\r\n\r\nBut this was a minor matter compared with the grievous scandal of the\r\nhospitals, disclosed by William Russell, the fearless correspondent of\r\n_The Times_, and ultimately remedied by the exertions of Sidney Herbert\r\nand, above all, of Florence Nightingale. This had moved the country\r\ndeeply, and the indignation was not easily allayed. Florence\r\nNightingale's services are repeatedly referred to. She was _Punch's_\r\nchief heroine in these years, from the day of her first mention and the\r\npublication of \"The Nightingale's Song\":--\r\n\r\nTHE NIGHTINGALE'S SONG TO THE SICK SOLDIER\r\n\r\n    Listen, soldier, to the tale of the tender Nightingale,\r\n      'Tis a charm that soon will ease your wounds so cruel,\r\n    Singing medicine for your pain, in a sympathizing strain,\r\n      With a jug, jug, jug of lemonade or gruel.\r\n\r\n    Singing bandages and lint, salve and cerate without stint,\r\n      Singing plenty both of liniment and lotion,\r\n    And your mixtures pushed about, and the pills for you served out,\r\n      With alacrity and promptitude of motion.\r\n\r\n    Singing light and gentle hands, and a nurse who understands\r\n      How to manage every sort of application,\r\n    From a poultice to a leech; whom you haven't got to teach\r\n      The way to make a poppy fomentation.\r\n\r\n    Singing pillows for you smoothed, smart and ache and anguish soothed,\r\n      By the readiness of feminine invention;\r\n    Singing fever's thirst allayed, and the bed you've tumbled made,\r\n      With a careful and considerate attention.\r\n\r\n    Singing succour to the brave, and a rescue from the grave,\r\n      Hear the Nightingale that's come to the Crimea,\r\n    'Tis a Nightingale as strong in her heart as in her song,\r\n      To carry out so gallant an idea.\r\n\r\nThis is only one of a whole series of poems--notably one written at the\r\ntime of her dangerous illness in May, 1855--inspired by the \"Lady of the\r\nLamp,\" who did not forget, on her side, to acknowledge that the wounded\r\ncommon soldiers had behaved \"like gentlemen and Christians to their\r\nnurses.\" Her saintship is secure, in spite of the adroit disparagement\r\nof modern iconoclasts; and the verdict of the common soldier was happily\r\nexpressed by a private at a dinner given to Crimean troops by the people\r\nof Folkestone and Hythe in 1856: \"We cannot forget Miss Nightingale--nor\r\ncan we forget mismanagement.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Well, Jack, here's good news from home. We're to have a\r\nmedal.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's very kind. Maybe one of these days we'll have a coat to stick it\r\non.\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Familiar Grievances_]\r\n\r\nFlorence Nightingale was not forgotten by the nation; the Queen sent her\r\nan autograph letter of thanks and a brooch, but no official recognition\r\nwas bestowed upon her by the British Government until 1907, when she was\r\ngiven the Order of Merit. As for William Russell, _Punch_ laboured in\r\nseason and out of season to secure some public acknowledgment of his\r\nhumanity and courage, but the debt remained unpaid for forty years, and\r\nwas then liquidated by a mere knighthood. The Crimean War was not a\r\ngreat war, judged by modern standards, but it assuredly was not a\r\npicnic, and it abounded in prospective plagiarism. Note, for example,\r\nthe complaint of the treatment of the \"Jolly Russian prisoners,\" in the\r\nwinter of 1854:--\r\n\r\n    How jolly the prisoner, who gets for his pay,\r\n    From his captor's own purse seven shillings a day!\r\n    And that's how we pension our officer-foes,\r\n    For which we shall certainly pay through the nose.\r\n\r\n    The nation that prisoners so handsomely pays\r\n    The wages of postmen will probably raise,\r\n    And doubtless provide on a grand scale for all\r\n    The children and wives of our soldiers who fall.\r\n\r\nNote again the criticisms of official reticence about individual acts of\r\nbravery in the lines \"The Unmentioned Brave: Song by a Commanding\r\nOfficer,\" early in 1855:--\r\n\r\n    Oh! no, we never mention them,\r\n      Their names must not be heard,\r\n    My hand Routine forbids to trace\r\n      Of their exploits one word.\r\n    Most glorious though their deeds may be,\r\n      To say it I regret,\r\n    When they expect a word from me,\r\n      They find that I forget.\r\n\r\n    You say that they are happy now,\r\n      The bravest of the brave,\r\n    A \"special\" pen recording how\r\n      Mere Grenadiers behave.\r\n    Of \"special\" pens I disapprove,\r\n      An inconvenient set,\r\n    Who oftentimes the veil remove,\r\n      And print what we forget.\r\n\r\nThe charges of incompetence in the conduct of the war and of greed among\r\nthose who made profit out of it have a painfully familiar ring.\r\nGenerals, beginning with Lord Hardinge, were too old; or they were\r\n\"blundering cavalrymen.\" Heroism was kept severely in its place or\r\ninadequately rewarded, as when a drummer-boy, who had shown conspicuous\r\ngallantry at the battle of the Alma, was given £5 by the Prince Consort;\r\nor, again, when a gallant sergeant was given a silk handkerchief hemmed\r\nby the Queen. Why, asks _Punch_, was he not made an ensign? Of a review\r\nof wounded soldiers by the Queen he observes that it would have been\r\nmore gracious if she had gone to the hospital instead of having the\r\ninvalids brought up to the palace to be inspected. In the same vein is\r\nthe dialogue, \"Honour to the Brave\":--\r\n\r\n    _Flunkey_ (reads): \"Yesterday thirty of the Invalids from the\r\n    Crimea were inspected ... many of the gallant fellows were\r\n    dreadfully mutilated at the Alma and Inkerman....After the\r\n    inspection ten of the Guards were regaled in the Servants' Hall.\"\r\n\r\n    _Flunkey_ (loq.): \"Regaled in the Servants' 'All! Eh? Well, I don't\r\n    think they've any call to grumble about not bein' 'Honoured\r\n    Sufficient!'\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DISTRESSED AGRICULTURIST\r\n\r\nLANDLORD: \"Well, Mr. Springwheat, according to the papers, there seems\r\nto be a probability of a cessation of hostilities.\"\r\n\r\nTENANT (who strongly approves of war prices): \"Goodness gracious!

When cheers are raised for the fighting men and their\r\ncommanders,\r\n\r\n    As loud a cheer give, England, to the Navvies' gallant band,\r\n    Who have gone to lend our warriors a stalwart helping hand.\r\n    These to their work with shovel and crowbar as true will stand\r\n    As those to theirs with bayonet, with rifle and with brand.\r\n\r\nThe Charge of the Light Brigade[10] prompts Leech's picture of \"A Trump\r\nCard(igan)\"; but, rather than with the officers, _Punch_, throughout the\r\nwar, was more concerned with the rank and file, and with instances of\r\nunfair differentiation between officers and men, notably in regard to\r\nthe sale of promotions and the grants of leave, satirized in the\r\ncartoon, \"The New Game of Follow my Leader,\" in which a very diminutive\r\nbugler, advancing in front of a long file of soldiers, addresses the\r\ncommander-in-chief: \"Please, General, may me and these other chaps have\r\nleave to go home on urgent _Private_ affairs?\"\r\n\r\nThe efforts of the Peace Party are a constant source of derisive\r\ncriticism, as in the bitter stanzas, \"Mr. Gladstone's Peace Song.\" Even\r\nmore bitter is the onslaught in the year 1856 on John Bright:--\r\n\r\n    Merrily danced the Quaker Bright,\r\n      And merrily danced that Quaker,\r\n    When he heard that Kars was in hopeless plight,\r\n      And Mouravieff meant to take her.\r\n    He said he knew it was wrong to fight,\r\n      He'd help nor Devil nor Baker,\r\n    But to see that the battle was going right,\r\n      O! merrily danced the Quaker.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: _Punch_ welcomed Tennyson's famous poem, which originally\r\nappeared in the _Examiner_, but could not agree with the view expressed\r\nin \"Maud\" that war is better than peace, though he held that it might be\r\nthe only way--as at the moment--to secure it.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BRITISH LION SMELLS A RAT]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Paying the Bill_]\r\n\r\nThe article in which we read that \"Wholesale slaughter and devastation,\r\nwhen you are driven to it, is the only economy of slaughter and\r\ndevastation,\" is a definitely frank espousal of the doctrine of\r\n\"frightfulness.\" Cobden and Bright, \"our calico friends,\" are\r\nmercilessly assailed in every number; Cobden in particular for his\r\npamphlet, \"What next, and next?\" and for his servility to America. Peace\r\ncame at the end of March, 1856, with its aftermath of criticism,\r\ndissatisfaction, discontent with the Peace terms, and fierce comments on\r\ngenerals and contractors, mismanagement and neglect of men and horses,\r\nand on the failure of the navy. Already the Sebastopol Blue Book had\r\nappeared--a painful document with \"delay,\" \"want of----\" and\r\n\"unaccountable neglect\" appearing on every page. The discussion of the\r\nPeace Treaty in Parliament prompts _Punch_ to mitigated \"joy and\r\nsatisfaction\" over what he calls \"Walewski's Treaty of Peace\"; to praise\r\nLord Malmesbury--no favourite of his; to describe Lord Aberdeen as\r\ncrawling out \"like an old slug, now that the war-storm is over,\" to\r\nexpress his general approbation, tempered by his \"preposterous love of\r\nRussia\"; and to condemn Disraeli, the leader of the Opposition, for his\r\nignominious silence in the Commons. The speeches by Lord Panmure in the\r\nLords, and Lord Palmerston in the Commons, in moving the votes of thanks\r\nto our soldiers, sailors, marines, militia, and Foreign Legion, and\r\nthose of the Leaders of the Opposition, who seconded them, were\r\nappropriate, but fell short of the merits of the theme. \"Certain\r\nfigures, given on official authority, tell the whole story of the two\r\nyears' war with grim succinctness. We have lost 22,467 men, of whom but\r\n3,532 died in battle or from wounds.\" Nothing is new: in emphasizing the\r\ndemand that Russia must be made to pay the bill, and declaring that her\r\nattempts to evade the Treaty must be rigorously dealt with, _Punch_\r\nstrikes a note all too familiar in the last two years and a half. His\r\ngeneral attitude is summed up in the lines on \"Rejoicings for Peace\":--\r\n\r\n    Thank Heaven the War is ended!\r\n      That is the general voice,\r\n    But let us feign no splendid\r\n      Endeavours to rejoice.\r\n    To cease from lamentation\r\n      We may contrive--but--pooh!\r\n    Can't rise to exultation,\r\n      And cock-a-doodle-doo!\r\n\r\n    We can't pass now direct from grief to laughter,\r\n      Like supernumeraries on the stage,\r\n      To smiling happiness from settled rage;\r\n    We look before and after.\r\n    Before, to all those skeletons and corses\r\n    Of gallant men and noble horses;\r\n      After--though sordid the consideration--\r\n    Unto a certain bill to pay,\r\n    Which we shall have for many a day,\r\n      By unrepealable taxation.\r\n\r\n    Yet never fought we in a better cause,\r\n      Nor conquered yet a nobler peace.\r\n    We stood in battle for the eternal laws;\r\n      'Twas an affair of high Police,\r\n    Our arms enforced a great arrest of State;\r\n    And now remains--the Rate.\r\n\r\nFriction with America over the dismissal of our Minister at Washington\r\nled to a remarkably frank open letter to President Pierce, of which the\r\ngist is: \"Let us fight by all means if you will have it, but think what\r\nit means\"; wholesome advice. On the other hand the temper of the\r\nManchester Pacificists, who had taken to disparaging Sardinia and the\r\ncause of Italian liberty, _à propos_ of the advance of a million pounds\r\nto Sardinia, prompted the invidious suggestion: \"They possibly fear lest\r\na blow struck anywhere for freedom should cause the countermand of a\r\ntrade offer.\" _Punch_, in these days no longer Pacificist, hailed Sidney\r\nHerbert's Bill for improving the education of officers in the Army, and\r\nestablishing a board to examine for commissions and promotions; but he\r\nwas more enthusiastic over Sir Joseph Paxton's proposed inquiry into the\r\nbarracks system, quoting with approval his remark that, while every\r\nprisoner in our gaols costs us £150 a year, \"the soldier was the\r\nworst-lodged person in the Queen's Dominions.\"\r\n\r\nPost-war parallels multiply at this period, the year 1856--in the\r\nrecrudescence of crime and burglaries, and the garrotting scare; in\r\nwholesale criticism of Lord Palmerston. There is an excellent burlesque\r\nin the shape of an imaginary article from the _Morning Herald_ on the\r\nexecution of Palmerston on Tower Hill. Immediately after exulting over\r\n\"Pam's\" downfall, the writer passes to a fulsome adulation of the dead.\r\nHere, as so often time has proved, _Punch_ was a prophet as well as a\r\ncritic. Other familiar grounds for discontent are to be found in the\r\nPeace terms and undue leniency to Russia; in friction with France;\r\nwholesale speculation and peculation; unnecessary Parliamentary\r\nexpenditure; and complaints of high prices, which, by the way, induced\r\n_Punch_ to suggest abstinence as the best means of bringing down the\r\nprice of sugar and butter. The return of the Guards is fitly honoured in\r\nJuly, and \"The Nightingale's Return\" in August:--\r\n\r\n    Most blessed things come silently, and silently depart;\r\n    Noiseless steals spring-time on the year, and comfort on the heart;\r\n    And still, and light, and gentle, like a dew, the rain must be,\r\n    To quicken seed in furrow and blossom upon tree.\r\n\r\n    So she, our sweet Saint Florence, modest, and still, and calm,\r\n    With no parade of martyr's cross, no pomp of martyr's palm,\r\n    To the place of plague and famine, foulness, and wounds and pain,\r\n    Went out upon her gracious toil, and so returns again.\r\n\r\n    When titles, pensions, orders, with random hand are showered,\r\n    'Tis well that, save with blessings, she still should walk undowered.\r\n    What title like her own sweet name, with the music all its own?\r\n    What order like the halo by her good deeds round her thrown?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Incapable Commanders_]\r\n\r\nLord Hardinge, the commander-in-chief, had been denounced as \"the apex\r\nof incapacity,\" but _Punch_ spoke kindly of that gallant old hero of the\r\nPeninsula on his resignation. He was \"all bravery and kindness except\r\nwhen opposed to Court influence, and then he could neither snub great\r\npeople nor stand up for the interests of the Army.\" With this statement\r\nwe may bracket a useful _obiter dictum_ on appointments generally: \"Too\r\nmuch ability is demanded for the small places, and for the large places\r\ngenerally too little.\" No confidence is shown in the \"whitewashing\r\nreport\" of the Chelsea Board of Inquiry into the charges brought against\r\nLord Lucan, Lord Cardigan, and others. The Board was packed with\r\n\"aristocratic officers,\" and its report is described as \"a Chelsea\r\nHospital salve for curing the reputations of Lucan, Cardigan, and Co.\"\r\n\r\nEvidently _Punch_ is in good satirical form, for he follows this sally a\r\nmonth later with an indignant article on the appointment of an earl's\r\nson, aged twelve, to be a Royal Page at £200 a year for four years, with\r\na grant of £500 as outfit, and a lieutenancy in the Guards without\r\npurchase; and the simultaneous offer of a commission as ensign in a\r\nmarching regiment to a heroic sergeant-major, aged forty, without money\r\nto purchase it. A bad case of \"ragging\" in the Guards comes in for\r\nsevere castigation, and the dismissal of the offenders from the service\r\nis welcomed as a step in the right direction. Nevertheless, while he was\r\na stern critic of extravagant and ill-conditioned officers, _Punch_\r\nrecognized the need of decent pay, and appealed for aid from the State\r\nto remedy the long-borne grievance. Amid the discordant chorus of\r\ncriticism and discontent which arose on the conclusion of Peace, happier\r\nnotes are sounded in the references to the initiation, on a\r\ncomprehensive basis, of the Order of Valour. The principle adopted in\r\nits bestowal is set forth in the lines which appeared in the issue of\r\nFebruary 23, 1856:--\r\n\r\n    Till now the stars and garters\r\n      Were for birth or fortune's son,\r\n    And as oft in snug home-quarters\r\n      As in fields of fight were won.\r\n    But at length a star arises,\r\n      Which as glorious will shine\r\n    On Smith's red serge vest as upon the breast\r\n      Of Smyth's scarlet superfine.\r\n\r\n    Too long mere food for powder\r\n      We've deemed our rank and file,\r\n    Now higher hopes and prouder\r\n      Upon the soldier smile.\r\n    And if no Marshal's bâton\r\n      Private Smith in his knapsack bears,\r\n    At least in the War, the chance of the star\r\n      With his General he shares.\r\n\r\nThe first distribution of the \"V.C.\" by the Queen was not made until\r\nJune 26, 1857, and in the same vein, but with greater dignity _Punch_\r\nstrove to render justice to the occasion:--\r\n\r\nTHE STAR OF VALOUR\r\n\r\nDistributed by the Queen's Own Hand. June 26, 1857.\r\n\r\n    The fount of Honour, sealed till now\r\n      To all save claims of rank and birth,\r\n    Makes green the laurel on the brow\r\n      Ennobled but by soldier's worth.\r\n\r\n    Of these the bravest and the best\r\n      Who 'scaped the chance of shot and sword,\r\n    England doth, by her Queen, invest\r\n      With Valour's Cross--their great reward!\r\n\r\n    Marking her sense of something still,\r\n      A central nobleness, that lies\r\n    Deeper than rank which royal will,\r\n      Or birth, or chance, or wealth supplies.\r\n\r\n    Knighthood that girds all valiant hearts,\r\n      Knighthood that crowns each fearless brow;\r\n    That knighthood this bronze cross imparts--\r\n      Let Fleece, and Bath, and Garter bow!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Victoria Cross_]\r\n\r\nThe plainness of the cross aroused critical comment, to which expression\r\nwas lent in the epigram, which has not lost its point yet:--\r\n\r\n    Here's Valour's Cross, my men; 'twill serve,\r\n      Though rather ugly--take it,\r\n    John Bull a medal can deserve,\r\n      But can't contrive to make it.\r\n\r\nBut the very simplicity of the bronze cross has lent it distinction.\r\n_Punch_ was on safer ground when he urged that doctors and firemen were\r\nwell qualified to receive it; the Albert Medal, in recognition of acts\r\nof gallantry in saving life performed by anyone whatever, was not\r\ninstituted till 1866. _Punch's_ democratic bias is also agreeably shown\r\nin his plea on behalf of the artisans and artificers employed at the\r\ndockyards and arsenals, whose labours shortened the war, but who were\r\nthrown out of work on its conclusion. In answer to their petition for\r\nhelp to emigrate, it was intimated to them that the Government would\r\nhelp them if they would help themselves. The delay of the Government in\r\nfulfilling their side of the bargain, when the men had complied with\r\nthis condition, gives occasion for a piece of sarcastic criticism on\r\nState parsimony. And in this context we may note the charming poem on\r\nMother Seacole, the brave old sutler in the Crimea, beloved of all\r\nsoldiers, who had fallen on evil days, but was relieved by public\r\nsubscription, largely due to the appeal in _Punch's_ columns. Lastly,\r\nand to sum up this review, we may note the shrewd common sense of the\r\ntimely article setting forth the pros and cons of Army Purchase, in\r\nwhich the writer emphasizes the need of a higher standard of brains and\r\nability. Under the existing tradition, the abolition of purchase would\r\nprobably mean promotion by influence--an equally vicious system. To\r\nalter the way of getting a commission was of no avail unless you altered\r\nthe thing itself. Efficiency was not incompatible with purchase, but it\r\nwas incompatible with \"taking care of Dowb\"--not the only reference in\r\n_Punch_ to the historic telegram of Lord Panmure to Lord Raglan on\r\nbehalf of his protégé and relative, Captain Dowbiggin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENTR'ACTE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON IN THE MID-NINETEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe survey of London, as set forth in the pages of _Punch_ seventy and\r\neighty years ago, undoubtedly ministers to our complacency. Much that\r\nwas picturesque has vanished, but the improvements in the state of the\r\nstreets, in lighting, communications, and, above all, sanitation, cannot\r\nbe easily overstated. In the early 'forties three methods of paving the\r\nstreets were employed: stones, Macadam, and wood; and according to\r\n_Punch_ they were all bad. The stones caused jolting, Macadam was muddy,\r\nwhile wood pavement, which was only partially used in a few favoured\r\nlocalities--the Poultry and Lombard Street--was a constant source of\r\ndanger by reason of its slipperiness. The spectacle, so familiar in\r\nrecent years, of horses skating on all four feet down inclines is\r\nnoticed in the year 1849. Hansom, the architect, had taken out the\r\npatent for his safety carriage in 1834, and that strange vehicle, which\r\nDisraeli celebrated as \"the Gondola of London,\" and which is now\r\nrelegated to the position of a curiosity or a relic, was fully\r\nestablished in a popularity which lasted for half a century or more. To\r\nthose like the present writer who have been in a hansom when one wheel\r\ncame off, or the horse's belly-band broke, or who have been propelled\r\nagainst the glass when the horse came down, the wonder is that it lasted\r\nso long. Yet, on a fine day, it was a pleasing, if precarious, vehicle,\r\nand inspired an exiled poet in the 'eighties to say that he would \"give\r\na monarch's ransom for a Piccadilly hansom.\" The old four-wheeler or\r\n\"growler\" still lingers and emerges during strikes of taxi-drivers, but\r\n_Punch_, though he found the cabman swathed in capes a fertile theme for\r\nhis pencil, in general regarded him as a rapacious and extortionate old\r\nbandit, and his cab a squalid and insanitary means of transit. The\r\none-day cab strike in 1853 grew out of the new Act fixing the fare at\r\n6d. a mile. Under the new police regulations, whenever a dispute as to\r\nmileage occurred, both parties could deposit five shillings and have the\r\nmatter decided by a magistrate. In one instance the cabman, not having\r\nfive shillings, lost his case and was fined. A good deal of public\r\nsympathy, fostered by the _Examiner_, was enlisted on behalf of the\r\ncabman, but _Punch_ was rigidly on the side of the public as against the\r\nproprietors of dirty cabs, miserable horses, and their abusive and\r\nrapacious drivers. The stringency of the regulations may be gathered\r\nfrom the lines on \"A Civil Cabman's Sauce,\" based on a paragraph which\r\nappeared in _The Times_. A cabman had been sentenced by the Lord Mayor\r\nto twenty shillings or fourteen days for refusing to take a fare because\r\nhe wanted his tea. The cabman had suggested that the fare might also\r\nrequire that refreshment. At this period, it may be also noted, cabmen\r\nwere not allowed to smoke when on their stands. Towards its close an\r\nimprovement in the cab service is acknowledged, but many years were to\r\nelapse before the institution of cab-shelters. As for the rapacity of\r\ncabmen, it was as water compared with wine when judged by the standard\r\nof taxi-drivers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CABMAN IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE TAKEN THE WRONG\r\nTURNING--THAT'S ALL]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Ancient Omnibus_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMY (to Rose): \"Good gracious, Rose, I'm afraid from the\r\nway the man talks that he is intoxicated!\"\r\n\r\nCABBY (impressively): \"Beg pardon, Miss! N-n-not (hic)\r\nintossi--intossi-cated (hic)--itsh only shlight 'ped-ped-pediment in\r\nspeesh, Miss!\"]\r\n\r\nTurning next to the 'buses, some of us are old enough to remember their\r\ndim interiors, the smell of damp, sodden straw on the floors, and the\r\nperilous ascent to the roof by what was little better than a rope\r\nladder. Still, we own to a sneaking regret for the old 'bus driver; to\r\nsit next him on the box-seat was a liberal education in the repartee of\r\nthe road. The \"knife-board,\" as the low partition against which outside\r\npassengers sat back to back was called, does not appear until after\r\n1852. The slow speed of travel by 'bus is a constant source of satire; a\r\njourney to the remoter suburbs, if _Punch_ is to be believed, took\r\nalmost as long as it now takes to go to Exeter. Yet, with familiar\r\ninconsistency, he constantly rebukes the 'busmen for racing, especially\r\non the route from Putney to St. Paul's. The miseries of the crowded\r\ninterior, what with dogs, bundles, bird-cages, and wet umbrellas, are\r\nvividly described, and it was not until 1849 that fixed fares were\r\nintroduced. Up till then the sum was left to the caprice of the\r\nconductor, or \"cad.\" Competition brought improvement in the shape of a\r\nsuperior type of \"saloon\" 'bus, and towards the end of this period\r\ncomplaints against cabs and 'buses died down somewhat; but in comfort,\r\ncleanliness, and speed, the difference between the public vehicles of\r\n1857 and 1920 is immense. About the former year the reader will find a\r\ngood description in \"The Fine Old English Omnibus,\" of its discomforts,\r\nstuffiness and perils and the disagreeable qualities of the \"cad\" and\r\ndriver. In one respect only, London was better served--on its waterway.\r\nThe Thames passenger steamers were a great feature of the time. Not that\r\nthey were above criticism; collisions were frequent, overloading was\r\nhabitual, the conduct of the passengers was not above reproach, and in\r\ngeneral the service was condemned as both risky and inefficient, and\r\nranked along with smallpox and railroads as a remedy for\r\nover-population.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FEMALE 'BUSES (A Prophecy)]\r\n\r\nFrom vehicles one passes by a natural transition to those who were\r\ncharged with the regulation of traffic, though its masterly control by\r\nthe police had not yet been developed to the point at which it has\r\nfrequently elicited the admiration of foreign visitors. The new\r\npolicemen, who had been embodied under the Metropolitan Police Act of\r\n1829, when Peel was Home Secretary, were no special favourites of\r\n_Punch_ in his early years, and his opinion of their efficiency may be\r\ngauged by his greeting the threat of their strike with the remark that\r\nhe did not think it would make much difference. Their relations with\r\ncooks--a fruitful source of satire--began to be a theme of ridicule in\r\nthe late 'forties, and inspired in _Punch_ \"The Loves of the New\r\nPolice,\" recounting the tragedy of a constable who forfeited his post\r\nowing to a fatal weakness for chops and stout.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The New Police Force_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE POLICE]\r\n\r\nWe have spoken already of the postmen; for their dress in 1844 students\r\nof official costume may be referred to the picture overleaf.\r\n\r\nAs for lighting, gas was already in general, though by no means\r\nuniversal, use. The gasless condition of Kensington is bewailed in 1844;\r\nthe bad lighting of Eaton Square in 1849. The use of electricity was\r\nforeshadowed, but that was all. For domestic purposes the commonest\r\nilluminant was \"camphine,\" an oil distilled from turpentine. Miss Mulock\r\nin _The Ogilvies_ speaks of it as being always either \"too dull or too\r\nbright,\" and _Punch_ is not enthusiastic as to its virtues. The agility\r\nof the street lamp-lighter lent point to a proverb which has become\r\nobsolete under modern conditions, for the lamp-lighter has no longer\r\nneed to climb and never runs. In 1844 _Punch_ speaks of the Lucifer\r\nhaving replaced the Congreve--or \"Congry\" as it was vulgarly\r\ncalled--friction match; but the change of name was later, according to\r\nMayhew and Charles Knight, who speaks of the penny box of Lucifer\r\nmatches as \"a triumph of science.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR JAMES GRAHAM HOLDS A REVIEW OF THE LONDON POSTMEN]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Municipal Apathy_]\r\n\r\nThe linking-up of central with outlying London had hardly begun in the\r\n'forties. Many of the nearer suburbs were then practically detached\r\nvillages. Kensington was reached by a dark, badly-laid country road from\r\nKnightsbridge, where, till 1846, carters used to stop at the Half-way\r\nHouse, a little roadside inn, for their half-pint of porter and bit of\r\nbread and cheese. The isolation of Brook Green, Islington, Battersea\r\nFields, even Chelsea, when a little allowance has been made for satiric\r\nlicense, was a real thing. Lord Ebury shot snipe in Pimlico in the\r\n'twenties; and they probably frequented its swamps as late as the year\r\n1840. What are now parks or residential quarters were then waste spaces\r\nor open fields. The \"Pontine Marshes\" of Shepherd's Bush, as _Punch_\r\ncalled them, have long been drained and covered with houses. But there\r\nwere wildernesses even in central London, notably Leicester Square and\r\nLincoln's Inn Fields. The \"dead seclusion\" and unkempt appearance of\r\nLeicester Square was a standing reproach to Londoners. As for the _terra\r\nincognita_ of Lincoln's Inn Fields, \"the Metropolitan Bush,\" it only\r\ndiffered from Leicester Square because it was \"invisible to the naked\r\neye.\" The dirt and confusion and cruelty to animals which reigned in the\r\nregion of Smithfield market, and are the subject of reiterated protests\r\nin _Punch_, belong to an unregretted past. _Punch_ was a great Londoner.\r\nWe talk of people being house-proud; he was city-proud, and it irked him\r\nto see historic squares and public places neglected or disfigured. For\r\nyears and years his complaints go up against the interminable delays in\r\nthe erection and completion of the Nelson memorial in Trafalgar Square,\r\nthe lions that lingered, the fountains that would not play. They begin\r\nin 1844; in 1845 he calls Trafalgar Square \"England's Folly,\" and eleven\r\nyears later we read:--\r\n\r\n    In England, the growth of buildings, like that of its institutions,\r\n    is exceedingly slow, if sure. Years are taken over a building that\r\n    on the Continent would be run up in almost as many months. A\r\n    celebrated German statistician has sent us the following incredible\r\n    particulars:\r\n\r\n    To erect a Simple Column            It takes in England 12 years.\r\n    Ditto, with Lions, everything\r\n      complete                             \"          \"     24   \"\r\n    To build a Common Bridge               \"          \"     15   \"\r\n    Ditto a Suspension Bridge              \"          \"     25   \"\r\n    Ditto Houses of Parliament              A trifle under 100   \"\r\n\r\n    With statues, the same authority proceeds to say, they have a\r\n    curious plan. They erect the pedestal first, and then leave it in\r\n    one of their most public places to be ready for the statue of some\r\n    celebrated man, when they have caught one. Thus, in Trafalgar\r\n    Square, they have a pedestal that has been waiting for years. It is\r\n    supposed to be for the COMING MAN, but apparently he is in no hurry\r\n    to make his appearance.\r\n\r\n\"Britannia,\" _Punch_ makes the remark, is assuredly \"a great deal\r\nhappier in her heroes than in her efforts to perpetuate their memory.\"\r\nAnd six years later he adds: \"We cannot make a statue that is not\r\nridiculous ourselves, nor, although we invite foreign competition, is it\r\nlikely that we shall get any other kind of statue made.\" In the same\r\nspirit of national self-criticism the following lines appear in 1851 on\r\n\"The Nation and Its Monuments\":--\r\n\r\n    The National Gallery holds its place\r\n      In Trafalgar's noble Square,\r\n    And being a national disgrace,\r\n      Will remain for ever there.\r\n\r\n    The Duke on the Arch was raised, in spite\r\n      Of all that the world could say;\r\n    And because he stands on an awkward site,\r\n      We, of course, shall let him stay.\r\n\r\n    The Palace of Glass is so much admired,\r\n      Both in Country and in Town,\r\n    That its maintenance is by all desired:\r\n      So we mean to pull it down.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _London Changes and Improvements_]\r\n\r\nIn 1852 _Punch_ gives a list of things indefinitely postponed, in which\r\nwe find the completion of Nelson's pillar; the catalogue of the British\r\nMuseum Library--_Punch_ was no admirer of Panizzi, the librarian; the\r\nReform of the City Corporations; the completion of the new Houses of\r\nParliament; an omnibus that will carry a person quicker than he can\r\nwalk; good water; cheap gas; perfect sewerage; and unadulterated milk.\r\nThe campaign against Barry, the architect of the new Houses of\r\nParliament, was conducted with a good deal of acrimony. _Punch_ began by\r\nobjecting to the cost, then to Barry's \"long sleep,\" and later on to the\r\nexpensive experiments in ventilation, and the darkness of the reporters'\r\ngallery. Nor was he less impatient over the delays in the completion of\r\nthe Hungerford Suspension Bridge and the new Westminster Bridge--begun\r\nin 1854, eight years after the old bridge had been closed as dangerous,\r\nand opened in 1860. The future of the derelict Marble Arch moved him to\r\nfrequent and caustic comment before its removal from outside Buckingham\r\nPalace to its present site in 1850. As early as 1853 there was talk of\r\nremoving Temple Bar, but this was not done till 1878. And the mention of\r\nBuckingham Palace recalls the fact that in 1857, when it was proposed to\r\ncut a carriage road through St. James's Park, there was no public road\r\npast the palace. The pelicans, which delight us to-day on their\r\nsadly-diminished lake, date back to the time of Charles II, who received\r\na gift of these birds from the Tsar of Muscovy.\r\n\r\nThe record of new buildings, constructions, monuments, and\r\n\"improvements\" kept by _Punch_ is not complete, but it serves to\r\nillustrate the changes between mid-Victorian and Georgian London. The\r\nThames Tunnel, Brunel's pioneer work in the long series of subterranean\r\nengineering achievements which have transformed the under-crust of\r\nLondon, was opened in August, 1843, and on October 28, 1844, the Queen\r\nopened the new Royal Exchange amid civic junketings which caused \"Q\"\r\n(Douglas Jerrold) to deplore the absence of the sons of labour from a\r\nhollow pageant in which only merchant princes were represented. The\r\nreference to the two tall buildings at Albert Gate seems to indicate an\r\napprehension even in those early days of the coming of skyscrapers, of\r\nwhich Queen Anne's Mansions are still the sole realization. Thackeray\r\nhas a humorous poem on \"The Pimlico Pavilion\", which refers to the\r\npavilion in the gardens of Buckingham Palace, a summer house with a\r\ncentral octagon room. In view of _Punch's_ persistent attacks on the\r\nCourt for neglecting native talent, it should be recorded that the task\r\nof filling the eight lunettes below the cornice with frescoes was\r\nentrusted to eight British artists, including Stanfield, Landseer, and\r\nMaclise, and that the subjects were all suggested by passages from\r\nMilton's _Comus_. On Wyatt's unfortunate colossal statue of the Duke of\r\nWellington, erected opposite Apsley House in 1846, and replaced by\r\nBoehm's smaller equestrian statue in 1883, _Punch_ heaped unstinted\r\nridicule with pen and pencil. Nor was he less hostile in his criticisms\r\non the \"hideous models\" submitted for the proposed memorial to the Iron\r\nDuke, when these designs were exhibited in 1857, describing them as\r\n\"Nemesis in Plaster of Paris,\" and representing the French Ambassador\r\nas telegraphing to his Government: \"Waterloo is avenged.\"\r\n\r\nThe New Billingsgate buildings merely serve as an excuse for some\r\njocular remarks on their supposed humanizing influence on the\r\nBillingsgate dialect.\r\n\r\nBut a good deal of space is devoted to Big Ben, his name and note (E\r\nnatural), and the vicissitudes which attended his hanging in the Clock\r\nTower. Of the references which abound in 1856, perhaps the most notable\r\nis the suggestion that the clapper should be named Gladstone, \"as,\r\nwithout doubt, his is the loudest tongue in Parliament\". The\r\nannouncement in 1857 that a crack had been discovered in Big Ben led to\r\nan epigram in disparagement of Mr. Gladstone's rival, so _Punch_ was\r\nable to have it both ways:--\r\n\r\n    Big Ben is cracked, we needs must own;\r\n      Small Ben is sane, past disputation;\r\n    Yet we should like to know whose tone\r\n      Is most offensive to the nation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Filthy Thames_]\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. Henry Jephson, L.C.C., published in 1907 an exhaustive work\r\non \"The Sanitary Evolution of London.\" He quotes Dickens's terrible\r\ndescription of one of the old intramural churchyards, but makes no\r\nmention of _Punch's_ services in the cause of London sanitation. They\r\ncertainly deserved and deserve recognition, for he spared no effort to\r\nbring home to a wider public than that reached by Blue Books and Reports\r\nthe intimate and deadly connexion between dirt and disease. As early as\r\nthe year 1842 we find in his pages this gruesome but unexaggerated\r\npen-picture of the Thames and its tributaries:--\r\n\r\n    Vauxhall contributes lime, Lambeth pours forth a rich amalgam from\r\n    the yards of knackers and bone-grinders, Horseferry liberally gives\r\n    up all its dead dogs, Westminster empties its treasures into the\r\n    mighty stream by means of a common sewer of uncommon dimensions,\r\n    the Fleet-ditch bears in its inky current the concentrated essences\r\n    of Clerkenwell, Field-lane, Smithfield, Cowcross--and is, by means\r\n    of its innumerable branches, augmented by the potent ingredients\r\n    of St. Giles's, Somers-town, Barbican, St. Luke's, and the\r\n    surrounding districts. The fluids of the Whitechapel\r\n    slaughter-houses call in their transit through the Minories for the\r\n    contributions of Houndsditch, Ratcliff Highway, Bevis Marks, and\r\n    Goodman's Fields, and thus richly laden pour their delicious slime\r\n    into the Thames by means of the Tower-ditch. Finally, the Surrey\r\n    side yields the refuse of tar-works and tan-yards, and it is\r\n    allowed by all, that the people of Deptford, Woolwich, and those\r\n    situated in the lower course of the stream, get the Thames water\r\n    (which here sustains six different characters) in the highest\r\n    perfection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE \"SILENT HIGHWAY\"-MAN]\r\n\r\nThe cartoon, The \"Silent Highway\"-Man, was published in 1858, but it is,\r\nperhaps, the best of the many pictorial comments on the above text. The\r\nnoisome state of the Serpentine--\"a lake of mere manure\"--constantly\r\naffronted _Punch's_ sensitive nose. Insanitary Smithfield and squalid\r\nCovent Garden elicit dishonourable mention from the early 'forties\r\nonward. But it was in 1849, the year of the cholera and typhus\r\nvisitation, that his crusade against London filth--\"Plague, Pestilence\r\nand Co.\"--began in earnest. The evil is traced to the triple source of\r\nbad drainage, overcrowded intramural burial grounds, and the unchecked\r\npollution of the river. _Punch_ salutes Mr. G. A. Walker, the author of\r\n\"Gatherings from Graveyards,\" as a public benefactor for his zeal in\r\nendeavouring to secure the abolition of intramural interments, and tilts\r\nsavagely at obstructive Boards of Guardians, vestry clerks, and\r\nextortionate undertakers, who profited by the maintenance of the abuse.\r\nHe gives us an \"Elegy written in a London Churchyard,\" on a victim of an\r\nepidemic brought on by preventable dirt; he exhibits \"the water that\r\nJohn drinks\"; he represents Hamlet soliloquizing in a London graveyard;\r\nand in 1849 he suggests the revision of street nomenclature in\r\naccordance with official acquiescence in the then existing dominion of\r\ndirt.\r\n\r\nThough by no means an enthusiastic admirer of the Duke of Wellington,\r\n_Punch_ confesses that he would like to see him appointed Sanitary\r\nDictator. The Thames, with its \"acres of cesspool,\" is likened to \"a\r\nfetid Dead Sea.\" Yet _Punch_ refused to lay the blame at the door of\r\nLord John Russell or the Government, who were held guilty by the\r\n_Morning Herald_ for the twelve thousand deaths from cholera in London.\r\nThe real criminals were to be found elsewhere. The ravages of typhus and\r\ncholera in 1849 have been surpassed in recent years by those of\r\ninfluenza, but the toll was heavy, and heaviest among the poor:--\r\n\r\n    For three sad months Britannia mourned her children night and day,\r\n    For three sad months she strove in vain the pestilence to stay;\r\n    Medicine, helpless, groped and guessed, and tried all arts to save,\r\n    But the dead carried with them their secret to the grave.\r\n\r\n    Death sat at the gaunt weaver's side, the while he plied the loom;\r\n    Death turned the wasting grinder's wheel, as he earn'd his bread and\r\n      doom;\r\n    Death, by the wan shirtmaker, plied the fingers to the bone;\r\n    Death rocked the infant's cradle, and with opium hushed its moan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE POOR CHILD'S NURSE]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _King Cholera's Friends_]\r\n\r\nThe Metropolitan Internments Bill, introduced in 1850, was a much-needed\r\nreform, and furnished _Punch_ with an occasion for free-spoken\r\ndenunciation of \"King Cholera's friends,\" Boards of Guardians, and other\r\nobstructives who \"laugh to scorn doctors and drains, and uphold the\r\ngreat cause of dirt.\" His method of dealing with the offenders is\r\ngenerally direct: sometimes it takes the form of extravagant irony, as\r\nin the \"account of my travels in search of self-government\":--\r\n\r\n    What is it to _me_ that fever is never absent from these\r\n    places--that infants do not rear, and men die before their\r\n    time--that sickness engenders pauperism--that filth breeds\r\n    depression, and depression drives to drink? What do you mean by\r\n    telling me that cholera slew in Rotherhithe its 205 victims in\r\n    every 10,000, in St. Olave's its 181, in St. Saviour's its 153, in\r\n    Lambeth its 120, while in the Strand it carried off only 35, in\r\n    Kensington 33, in Marylebone 17, and in Hampstead 8, out of the\r\n    same number? Still, British landlords did what they liked with\r\n    their own, and self-government is unimpaired. The satellites and\r\n    slaves of an encroaching centralization are kept at arm's length,\r\n    and if they have succeeded in putting down sewers, at least we have\r\n    triumphed in not laying our house-drains into 'em.\r\n\r\n    It is with pride, therefore, I repeat, that whatever may be the\r\n    case in the country (where I regret to see the hateful Public\r\n    Health Act seems to be extending its ravages), in London we are\r\n    still enjoying the enormous, the invaluable privileges of\r\n    self-government, and that if Epidemic Cholera should visit us\r\n    again, we may confidently show him to his old haunts in 1832 and\r\n    1849, and so convince him that, in this free country, _he_, too, is\r\n    at liberty \"TO DO WHAT HE LIKES WITH HIS OWN.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE END OF GOG AND MAGOG; OR, THINGS VERY BAD IN THE\r\nCITY]\r\n\r\n_Punch_ naturally applauded the Bill brought in by Sir George Grey, in\r\n1856, to reform the Corporations of London, but would have preferred a\r\nmore drastic measure, and warned the unrepentant City Fathers of the\r\ndangers of refusing to accept the liberal terms offered them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _London's Vanished Glories_]\r\n\r\nAmong the features of vanishing and now vanished London, the Fleet\r\nPrison has already been noticed. It passed \"unwept, unhonoured, and\r\nunsung,\" save in the ironical valediction pronounced by _Punch_ on the\r\noccasion of the sale of the materials of the prison in 1846. Holywell\r\nStreet, swept away by recent improvements, was still reckoned as one of\r\nLondon's lions, though a dingy one at best. The glories of Vauxhall\r\nGardens were expiring, and the Colosseum in Regent's Park, which, with\r\nits Panorama of London, statues, works of dubious art and Swiss scenery,\r\nwas a precursor of the Earl's Court Exhibitions, had fallen on evil\r\ndays, and was sold in 1843 by the famous George Robins, the \"Cicero of\r\nauctioneers.\" For the splendour of Astley's Circus in the 'forties,\r\n_Punch_ forms a useful commentary on the delightful mock ballads of _Bon\r\nGaultier_. Gomersal, the famous equestrian impersonator of Napoleon, was\r\ngoing strong in 1844. His retirement to a hostelry at Hull in 1849 is\r\nattributed by _Punch_ to disgust at the failure of Imperialism.\r\nWiddecomb, the illustrious ring-master, and the subject of many of\r\n_Punch's_ pleasantries, earned the distinction of a mention by Browning,\r\nwho refers to him as resembling Tom Moore, with his \"painted cheeks and\r\nsham moustache,\" and he finds a niche in the Pantheon of the D.N.B.\r\nAstley's is the mere shadow of a name to the present generation, and\r\nonly elderly Londoners can recall the delights of the Polytechnic as a\r\nplace more of entertainment than instruction, with the tank and diving\r\nbell and electrifying apparatus, dear to mid-Victorian schoolboys in\r\ntheir Christmas holidays. These are duly chronicled by _Punch_ along\r\nwith the attractions of Rosherville Gardens, then presided over by Baron\r\nNathan, one of the irregular _impresario_ peers who do not appear in\r\n\"Debrett,\" of whom the last representative was Lord George Sanger. Baron\r\nNathan catered for a mixed audience, but as a director of dances he\r\nappealed to a fashionable _clientèle_. When Burnand wrote the libretto\r\nof _Cox and Box_ in 1866, Rosherville was the paradise of the City\r\nclerk, witness Cox's song,\r\n\r\n    My aged employer, his whole physiognomy\r\n    Shining with soap like a star in astronomy,\r\n    Said \"Mr. Cox, you'll oblige me and honour me\r\n    If you will take this as your holiday!\"\r\n    Then visions of Brighton and back and of Rosherville--\r\n    Feeling the rain put on my mackintosh I vill, etc.\r\n\r\nBrighton already justified its title of \"London-on-Sea,\" and the volume\r\nof excursion traffic had begun to provoke complaints from the residents\r\nas likely to impair the amenities of the place. These complaints the\r\ndemocratic _Punch_ denounced as snobbish; and he speaks of Brighton in\r\n1841 as the home of half-pay officers with dyed whiskers. Later on,\r\nhowever, he takes a somewhat different view in his realistic pictures of\r\nthe Semitic invaders.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Burlington Arcadia_]\r\n\r\nThe Pantheon in Oxford Street, where in its first phase as a theatre\r\nMiss Stephens, afterwards Countess of Essex, made her _début_ on the\r\nstage, had since 1834 been reconstructed as a bazaar and picture\r\ngallery. _Punch_ describes it in 1842 as a Zoo and National Gallery\r\ncombined, with its conservatory, aviary, statues, and pictures. It was a\r\npleasant cut for idlers in wet weather from Oxford Street to Marlborough\r\nStreet. But its glories were but a pale reflex of the days when the\r\nbuilding excited Walpole's enthusiasm, and Gibbon was a regular\r\nattendant of its \"splendid and elegant\" masquerades. After various\r\nvicissitudes the Pantheon was closed in 1867, and is now a wine\r\nwarehouse. The Lowther Arcade, from the Strand to King William Street,\r\nwas consecrated to the sale of toys. The present writer can remember it\r\nin the 'seventies, with stout and bearded shopmen blowing on tin\r\ntrumpets and spinning tops for the allurement of passers by. It has\r\ndisappeared, but the Burlington Arcade remains. Under the heading of\r\n\"The Haunts of the Regent Street Idler,\" _Punch_ gives a detailed\r\naccount of its attractions in 1842:--\r\n\r\n    The covered passage through which the overland journey from\r\n    Burlington Gardens to Piccadilly is generally performed so abounds\r\n    in objects of amusement to the lounger that, in point of cheap\r\n    happiness, it becomes a perfect Burlington Arcadia. He can pass a\r\n    whole afternoon therein, with the additional comfortable feeling\r\n    of security from any unexpected shower. First of all he makes a\r\n    regular inspection of every article in Delaporte's windows--from\r\n    Gavarni's _Charivari_ sketches, which have been there as far as the\r\n    memory of the oldest lounger can reach, to the droll _Diableries_,\r\n    and the _Dames et Seigneurs de la Cour du Moyen Age_, who rushed\r\n    into publicity at the first whisper of the Queen's Fancy Ball. Then\r\n    he listens to the dulcet notes of an accordion, which is\r\n    perpetually playing in this favoured thoroughfare, whilst he\r\n    saunters on to the fancy stationer's, and criticizes the\r\n    water-colour albumified views of Venice and Constantinople, all\r\n    neutral tint and burnt sienna; or falls in love with the\r\n    impassioned head of La Esmeralda, and regrets such symmetrical\r\n    young ladies do not dance about the streets at the present day; his\r\n    attention only being withdrawn from the beautiful gipsy by two\r\n    portraits of mortal angels in _very_ low dresses, one of whom is\r\n    asleep at one corner of the window, and the second combing her hair\r\n    at the other. He peers into all the artificial flower shops, to see\r\n    what hidden divinities are therein concealed by the bowers of\r\n    tinted gauze and tinsel; and having admired the languishing ladies\r\n    and very nice gentlemen in the hairdressers' windows, finally loses\r\n    himself in an earthly paradise of painted snuff-boxes, parasols,\r\n    popular music and perfumery, together with certain articles of\r\n    ladies' dress, like dolls' pillows in convulsions, the display of\r\n    which has always struck us as being a profane revelation of the\r\n    arcana pertaining to the toilet of a beauty.\r\n\r\nCovent Garden Theatre, as we know it, was not opened till May, 1858. Of\r\nits predecessors on the same site two were destroyed by fire, one in\r\n1808, and the next in May, 1856, after a somewhat orgiastic _bal masqué_\r\norganized by Anderson, \"the Wizard of the North,\" Gye's tenant at the\r\ntime. This, by the way, was the third theatre burned down during\r\nAnderson's engagements, and the disaster led to a picture in _Punch_\r\nrepresenting Mario, the famous tenor, mourning amid the ruins of the\r\nscenes of his many triumphs--an ingenious adaptation of the episode of\r\nMarius sitting as a refugee amid the ruins of Carthage. _Punch_ was no\r\nlover of _bals masqués_, reckoning them among the things which they\r\nmanage better abroad. Nor was he a friendly critic of Madame Tussaud,\r\nmodestly housed at the Bazaar in Baker Street until the erection of the\r\npresent building in 1884. _Punch_ owned that admission to her show was a\r\ntest of popularity, but he condemned the Chamber of Horrors as\r\nministering to the cult of monstrosity, and compared Madame Tussaud in\r\n1849--the year before her death--to the witches who made wax models of\r\nthose whom they wished to injure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HAPPY FAMILY]\r\n\r\nChelsea buns are still with us, though it is declared in _London Past\r\nand Present_ that the tradition of making them is lost; the \"Original\r\nBun House,\" at the bottom of Jews' Row, was taken down in 1839, but its\r\nmemories linger in the early volumes of _Punch_. There is a good series\r\nentitled \"The Gratuitous Exhibitions of London,\" one of which, \"The\r\nHappy Family,\" lasted for forty years later. The present writer well\r\nremembers in his schoolboy days the wire safe on wheels, stationed at\r\nthe corner of Trafalgar Square, near Hampton's shop, containing cats,\r\nmice, pigeons, rabbits, and small birds, very much as in _Punch's_\r\npicture. The nearest survival is the cage of fortune-telling birds one\r\nsees now and again. A charge of twopence was made for admission to St.\r\nPaul's Churchyard, and this was a non-gratuitous exhibition which\r\n_Punch_ bitterly resented, even to the extent of comparing it with\r\nWombwell's Menagerie. The occasional raids of the aristocracy on\r\nCremorne Gardens--which stood a little west of Battersea Bridge--have\r\nbeen described elsewhere. The gardens, which competed with Vauxhall as a\r\nscene for dancing, fireworks and various exhibitions--\"The Siege of\r\nGibraltar\" was pyrotechnically reproduced in 1851--were not closed till\r\n1877, soon after which date the house, built by the Earl of Huntingdon,\r\nand occupied as a private house by Lord Cremorne in the Regency, was\r\npulled down and the grounds built over.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Dominion of Din_]\r\n\r\n_Punch_ had a friendly feeling for the London street arab, whose sayings\r\nso often enliven his pages, and calls him the \"small olive-branch of the\r\ngreat unwashed.\" But he was somewhat impatient of the tyranny of the\r\ntip-cat, battledore and shuttlecock, hopscotch and all street games\r\nwhich imperilled the safety of the elderly foot passenger. Professional\r\nmendicants he regarded with abhorrence, and waged unceasing war on\r\nItalian organ-grinders as an insolent and irremovable nuisance, as well\r\nas on German bands and all who maintained the dominion of unnecessary\r\ndin. He would gladly have seen all street-cries abolished: the \"elfin\r\nnote of the milkman\" had no charm for him. Here perhaps the\r\nsensitiveness and sufferings of John Leech were responsible for his\r\nantipathy. Mark Lemon wrote a letter to Mr. M. T. Bass, M.P., who\r\nbrought in a Bill to regulate street music, in which he traced Leech's\r\nfatal illness to the disturbance of his nervous system by \"the continual\r\nvisitation of street bands and organ-grinders.\" Those readers who take\r\nan interest in the evolution of musical taste may be interested to know\r\nthat in 1856 the popular tunes on the street organs were \"The\r\nRatcatcher's Daughter,\" \"Annie Laurie,\" the serenade from Verdi's\r\n\"Trovatore\" and \"The Red, White and Blue,\" a selection admirably\r\nrepresentative of sport, sentiment, the prevalent Italianation of opera,\r\nand patriotism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TASTE\r\n\r\nSHOP GIRL (who had been expected to procure Tennyson's \"Miller's\r\nDaughter\"): \"No, Miss! We've not got the Miller's, but here's the\r\n'Ratcatcher's Daughter,' just published!\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Beadles, Broadsheets and Advertisements_]\r\n\r\nThe Zoological Gardens had been opened in 1828 and were already a most\r\npopular resort; the hippopotamus at one time almost rivalling \"General\"\r\nTom Thumb as the most run-after celebrity. \"Good David Mitchell,\" who\r\nwas secretary to the Zoological Society from 1847 to 1859, was a prime\r\nfavourite with _Punch_, and is never mentioned without a friendly word.\r\nBut of all officials concerned with the administration of London none\r\nstood higher in his esteem than Sir Benjamin Hall, M.P. for Marylebone\r\nfrom 1837 to 1859, when he was created Lord Llandovery, President of the\r\nBoard of Health in 1854, and Chief Commissioner of Works from 1855 to\r\n1858. \"Ben Hall's\" services in adding to the amenities of the parks and\r\nintroducing bands on Sundays were celebrated by _Punch_ in prose and\r\nverse. It was he who brought in a Bill for the sorely needed better\r\nmanagement of the Metropolis in March, 1855, and _Punch_ more than once\r\napplauded him for castigating the follies of the Central Metropolitan\r\nBoard, whose vagaries in suggesting names for streets roused _Punch's_\r\nspecial ire in 1856. A nomenclator like the late Sir Laurence Gomme, who\r\ncombined official authority with a fine historical sense, only emerges\r\nonce in a century. Among the minor officials of the time beadles were\r\nconspicuous. _Punch_ devotes a special article to those of the\r\nBurlington and Lowther Arcades, the Quadrant and the British Museum, but\r\nthese gorgeous uniformed functionaries, splendid in scarlet and gold,\r\nare now only memories of the elderly or the aged. Gone, too, are the\r\nbroadsheets, \"dying speeches\" and ballads of Catnach, the Seven Dials\r\nbookseller; gone also are the \"mock auctions\" which were held in the\r\nStrand up to the war. London had no picture-palaces in the 'forties and\r\n'fifties, but there was an abundance of panoramas, which _Punch_ noted\r\nas a reaction against the cult of dwarfs. The fogs cannot have been\r\nworse than those which prevailed for nearly a week one winter at the\r\nclose of the 'nineties, but the smoke nuisance was perhaps more acute\r\nbecause entirely unregulated. _Punch_ defended the intermission of\r\npostal deliveries on Sunday, on the ground that it promoted the blessed\r\ndullness of that day, and here at least the chronicler has no change to\r\nrecord. On the growth of the great modern art of advertising _Punch_ is\r\na most instructive commentator. As early as December, 1842, he printed\r\nan essay on its theory and practice in which the following passage\r\noccurs:--\r\n\r\n    The _Kentish Herald_ lately contained the following notice:\r\n    \"Ranelagh Gardens, Margate--last night of Mount Vesuvius, in\r\n    consequence of an engagement with the Patagonians.\" This is\r\n    tragical enough; but _The Times_ outdoes it in horror by informing\r\n    us that \"The Nunhead Cemetery is now open for _general_ interment\";\r\n    and immediately afterwards comes an advertisement of \"The London\r\n    General Mourning Warehouse, Oxford Street\"; and then, to crown all,\r\n    Mr. Simpson, of Long Acre, declares himself ready to make\r\n    \"Distresses in Town and Country, so as to give general\r\n    satisfaction.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1847 _Punch_ recurs to the subject in a spirit foreshadowing the\r\nactivities of that excellent society which of late years has striven to\r\nrestrain the excesses of the advertiser:--\r\n\r\n    Advertisements are spreading all over England--they have crept\r\n    under the bridges--have planted themselves right in the middle of\r\n    the Thames--have usurped the greatest thoroughfares--and are now\r\n    just on the point of invading the omnibuses. Advertising is\r\n    certainly the great vehicle for the age. Go where you will, you are\r\n    stopped by a monster cart running over with advertisements, or are\r\n    nearly knocked down by an advertising house put upon wheels, which\r\n    calls upon you, when too late, not to forget \"Number One.\" These\r\n    vehicles, one would think, were more than enough to satisfy the\r\n    most greedy lover of advertisements, but it seems that there is\r\n    such an extraordinary run for them that omnibuses are to be lined\r\n    and stuffed with nothing else.\r\n\r\nWe have long acquiesced in this invasion of the sanctity of the omnibus.\r\nIt is the desecration of the countryside that chiefly disgusts the\r\nfastidious of to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nTHE SOCIAL FABRIC\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COURT\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897, Caran d'Ache,\r\nthe famous French artist--perhaps the greatest genius in his peculiar\r\n_genre_ that our age has produced--published a wonderful design in which\r\nthe parallel histories of France and Great Britain, during our Queen's\r\nreign, were summed up at a glance with masterly insight. Great Britain\r\nwas represented by one person under two aspects: Queen Victoria as a\r\ngirl and as an old woman; France by a long procession of figures: King,\r\nPrince President, Emperor, and the series of Presidents of the Republic.\r\nThe stability of England and the fluctuations of France could not have\r\nbeen pictorially symbolized with greater point. The Victorian age is\r\nrightly named, for Queen Victoria in her virtues, her prejudices and\r\nlimitations was, in many ways, its most commanding figure, and the\r\npersonal devotion and respect she inspired in men differing so widely in\r\ntemperament and outlook as Melbourne and O'Connell, Peel and Russell,\r\nDisraeli, Lord Salisbury and Lord Roberts, to mention no others, counted\r\nfor much in securing the country against the violent upheavals from\r\nwhich our nearest neighbour suffered. Yet, when the wave of sentiment\r\ncreated by the romantic conditions under which a girl of eighteen was\r\nsummoned to wear a crown had died down, the light that beat upon the\r\nthrone was far from genial; it was often fierce. The controversy over\r\nthe Ladies of the Bedchamber threatened to drag the Crown into the arena\r\nof party politics. The contention of the Tories was, in the main, sound\r\nand constitutional--that these appointments should not be made or\r\nmaintained in such a way as to expose the Sovereign to influences\r\nhostile to the Government in power; and the Queen cannot be acquitted of\r\na certain obstinacy in the assertion of her rights. But the cry that\r\nthe Tories were forcing her hand was vigorously taken up, and strange\r\ncross currents of feeling were developed, O'Connell's passionate\r\noutburst of loyalty being the strangest of all. It was one of the\r\nironies of circumstance that, in the early years of her reign, the\r\nQueen's relations with Whig Ministers--always excepting Lord\r\nPalmerston--were far more cordial than with the Tories. Yet this was no\r\nguarantee for the popularity of the Court, and only those who are\r\nfamiliar with the history of the time can appreciate how unpopular it\r\nwas. The middle-class element were not enamoured of the Whigs, but\r\nwhatever they thought of the influence exerted by Lord Melbourne as the\r\nQueen's Mentor, they were not prepared to recognize any improvement\r\nwhen, on his retirement, the post was informally, but none the less\r\neffectually, filled by a German prince. The Queen's marriage was one of\r\naffection rather than policy, and Prince Albert had many excellent\r\nqualities. He was a highly educated, in some ways even a learned man; he\r\nwas industrious, and his private character was without stain. It was not\r\nin human nature to expect that he should entirely efface himself in\r\naffairs of State; but he played the game better than he was given credit\r\nfor, and on at least one occasion his intervention was quite contrary to\r\nthat ascribed to him. At the same time he was lacking in charm and\r\ngeniality; his manner was stiff, his conversation academic and\r\noccasionally _gauche_. His notions of sport were not those of an English\r\nsportsman, and he had a passion for devising new military uniforms. To\r\nput it bluntly, he was a foreigner, and the chief ground of the\r\nunpopularity of the Court was that it gave an unfair preference to\r\neverything foreign--language, art, music, letters--and consistently\r\ndeclined to encourage native talent. Satiric references to the royal\r\npatronage of foreigners begin in _Punch's_ first volume. \"Ride-a-cock\r\nhorse\" is turned into a florid Italian _cavatina_, and the words\r\ntranslated into Italian--\"Su Gallo-Cavallo a Banburi Croce\"--for the\r\nbenefit of the nurse of the Princess Royal, Mrs. Ratsey, referred to as\r\n\"a lady equally anxious with ourselves to instil into the infant mind an\r\nutter contempt for anything English.\" This sets the keynote to a series\r\nof complaints which re-echo over many years. For the moment we may turn\r\nto _Punch's_ extraordinarily frank comments, cast in the form of a\r\nburlesque of the ultra-loyal press, on the rapid growth of the royal\r\nnursery, _à propos_ of the birth of the Prince of Wales:--\r\n\r\nTHE LORD MAYOR AND THE QUEEN\r\n\r\nBy the Correspondent of the _Observer_\r\n\r\n    The interesting condition of Her Majesty is a source of the most\r\n    agonizing suspense to the Lord Mayors of London and Dublin, who, if\r\n    a Prince of Wales is not born before their period of office\r\n    expires, will lose the chance of being created baronets.\r\n\r\n    According to rumour, the baby--we beg pardon, the scion of the\r\n    House of Brunswick--was to have been born--we must apologize again,\r\n    we should say was to have been added, to the illustrious stock of\r\n    the reigning family of Great Britain--some day last month, and of\r\n    course the present Lord Mayors had comfortably made up their minds\r\n    that they should be entitled to the dignity it is customary to\r\n    confer on such occasions as that which the nation now ardently\r\n    anticipates. But here we are at the beginning of November, and no\r\n    Prince of Wales. We have reason to know that the Lord Mayor of\r\n    London has not slept a wink since Saturday, and his lady has not\r\n    smiled, according to an authority on which we are accustomed to\r\n    rely, since Thursday fortnight. Some say it is done on purpose,\r\n    because the present official is a Tory; and others insinuate that\r\n    the Prince of Wales is postponed in order that there may be an\r\n    opportunity of making Daniel O'Connell a baronet. Others suggest\r\n    that there will be twins presented to the nation, one on the night\r\n    of November 8, the other on the morning of the 9th, so as to\r\n    conciliate both parties; but we are not disposed at present to\r\n    pronounce a decided opinion on this part of the question. We know\r\n    that politics have been carried most indelicately into the very\r\n    heart of the Royal Household.[11] But we hope, for the honour of\r\n    all parties, that the confinement of the Queen is not to be made a\r\n    matter of political arrangement.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Ultra-Loyalty Burlesqued_]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: The imbroglio of the Ladies of the Bedchamber had been\r\nsettled in 1840. But Scribe's _Verre d'Eau_, under the title of _The\r\nMaid of Honour_, with the real incident turned into farce, had been\r\nadapted to the English stage and produced at the Adelphi.]\r\n\r\nThis is followed up in the next issue by an equally audacious comment\r\nfrom the same fictitious correspondent:--\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BIRTH OF THE PRINCE OF WALES\r\n\r\n(By the _Observer's_ own Correspondent)\r\n\r\n    It will be seen that we were not premature in announcing the\r\n    probability of the birth of a Prince of Wales; and though it was\r\n    impossible that anyone should be able to speak with certainty, our\r\n    positive tone upon the occasion serves to show the exclusive nature\r\n    of all our intelligence. We are enabled now to state that the\r\n    Prince will immediately take, indeed he has already taken, the\r\n    title of the _Prince of Wales_, which it is generally understood he\r\n    will enjoy--at least if a child so young can be said to enjoy\r\n    anything of the kind--until an event shall happen which we hope\r\n    will be postponed for a very protracted period. The Prince of\r\n    Wales, should he survive his mother, will ascend the throne; but\r\n    whether he will be George the Fifth, Albert the First, Henry the\r\n    Ninth, Charles the Third, or Anything the Nothingth, depends upon\r\n    circumstances we are not at liberty to allude to _at present_, nor\r\n    do we think we shall be enabled to do so in a second edition.\r\n\r\n    Our suggestion last week, that the royal birth should take place on\r\n    Lord Mayor's Day, has, we are happy to see, been partially attended\r\n    to; but we regret that the whole hog has not been gone, by twins\r\n    having been presented to the anxious nation, so that there might\r\n    have been a baronetcy each for the outgoing and incoming Lord\r\n    Mayors of London and Dublin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A ROYAL NURSERY RHYME FOR 1860\r\n\r\n    \"There was a Royal Lady who lived in a shoe,\r\n    She had so many children she didn't know what to do.\"]\r\n\r\nThis vein is further developed in burlesque bulletins of the progress of\r\nthe infant Prince. _Punch's_ serious views as to the Prince's future are\r\nto be found in his \"Pæan to the Princelet\" and its sequel, inspired by\r\nthe Royal Christening in February, 1842:--\r\n\r\n_PUNCH_ AND THE PRINCELET\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The little Prince _must_ love the poor,\r\n      And he will heed the cry\r\n    Of the pauper mother, when she finds\r\n      Her infant's fountains dry.\r\n    He'll fill the cruse, and bruise the ear,\r\n      To make those founts o'erflow,\r\n    For they have vow'd our little Prince\r\n      No \"vanities\" shall know.\r\n    And we will rattle our little bell,\r\n    And laugh, and dance, and sing as well--\r\n        Roo-too-tooit! Shallaballa!\r\n        Life to the Prince! Fallallalla!\r\n\r\n    And death's dark bones will then become\r\n      Like iv'ry pure and white!\r\n    His blood-dyed robe will moulder off,\r\n      And his garments be as light;\r\n    For man will slaughter man no more\r\n      For wrong begot by wrongs,\r\n    For our little Prince will say--\"To me\r\n      Nor life nor death belongs.\"\r\n    So we will rattle our little bell,\r\n    And laugh, and dance, and sing as well--\r\n        Roo-too-tooit! Shallaballa!\r\n        Life to the Prince! Fallallalla!\r\n\r\nBut while taking the Prince's future very seriously, _Punch_ could not\r\nemulate those writers in the Press who, with goose-quill in hand, could\r\nnot approach the ordinary trials from which even Royal infants are not\r\nexempt, save on their knees:--\r\n\r\n    It has been announced to the public, through the medium of the\r\n    Press, that a most important epoch has arrived in the life of the\r\n    Prince of Wales. It is a strange fact, that this \"important epoch\"\r\n    has not been noted in the biography of any previous Prince of\r\n    Wales; for we look in vain through the pages of Hume and Smollett,\r\n    Rapin, Lingard, Miss Julia Corner, and indeed every other corner\r\n    within our reach, without being able to ascertain when Edward the\r\n    Black Prince was driven from the breast to the bottle. The Heir\r\n    Apparent to the English throne has, we are told, been lately\r\n    subjected to this frightful vicissitude; and though his Royal\r\n    Highness is said to have borne it tolerably well, it will appear\r\n    that while he took to the pap-spoon with princely fortitude, there\r\n    was something of the infant perceptible in his mode of first\r\n    receiving it.\r\n\r\nWhen another Princess was born in 1843, we read that \"there were some\r\napprehensions that the nasal organ of the Heir Apparent might be\r\naffected by the birth of a younger sister, but we are happy to say that\r\nthere are no symptoms of a derangement of the Prince's proboscis at\r\npresent,\" also that Donizetti had been requested to arrange a series of\r\nconcertos for the penny trumpet, and had sent to the Prince one on the\r\nnoble theme of \"This little pig went to market\" to the Italian words:--\r\n\r\n    Questo piccolo porco\r\n      E andato al mercato.\r\n    Questo piccolo porco\r\n      E a casa restato.\r\n    Questo piccolo porco\r\n      Ha avuto del rosbief per pranza.\r\n    Questo piccolo porco\r\n      Niente ebbe nel sua stanza.\r\n\r\nThese familiar jocularities, redeemed by their general good humour from\r\nthe charge of disrespect, are harmless compared with the sustained\r\ncampaign of ridicule directed against Prince Albert as tailor and\r\nsportsman. German sovereigns and princes have always been great on\r\nuniforms, and Prince Albert undoubtedly suffered severely from this\r\nhereditary failing. A concise biography in the _Almanack_ for 1842\r\nstates that he was born on August 26, 1819, and afterwards invented \"a\r\nshocking bad hat for the British Infantry, but England refused to put\r\nher Foot in it.\" From this time onward the attacks are constant and\r\nmalicious. The Prince's bell-shaped hat repeatedly figures in cartoons.\r\nHe \"bresents his gompliments\" to Herzog Jenkins (of the _Morning Post_),\r\nfor whom he has \"gomposed a dugal goronet.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Prince Albert as Tailor_]\r\n\r\nIn the following year there is a cartoon representing the Prince in his\r\nsartorial studio surrounded by designs and models; the following comment\r\nis associated with the cartoon:--\r\n\r\n    Ever since the accession of Prince Albert to the Royal Husbandship\r\n    of these realms, he has devoted the energies of his mind and the\r\n    ingenuity of his hands to the manufacture of infantry caps, cavalry\r\n    trousers, and regulation sabretaches. One of his first measures was\r\n    to transmogrify the pantaloons of the Eleventh Hussars; and as the\r\n    regiment alluded to is Prince Albert's Own, His Royal Highness may\r\n    do as he likes with his own, and no one could complain of his\r\n    bedizening the legs of the unfortunate Eleventh with scarlet cloth\r\n    and gold door-leather. When, however, the Prince, throwing the\r\n    whole of his energies into a hat, proposed to encase the heads of\r\n    the British soldiery in a machine which seemed a decided cross\r\n    between a muff, a coal scuttle, and a slop pail, then _Punch_ was\r\n    compelled to interfere, for the honour of the English army. The\r\n    result has been that the headgear has been summarily withdrawn by\r\n    an order from the War Office, and the manufacture of more of the\r\n    Albert hat has been absolutely prohibited.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TAILOR'S GOOSE--THE TERROR OF THE ARMY]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Prince Albert as Sportsman_]\r\n\r\nThe campaign reached its height in 1845 when _Punch_ was given an\r\nirresistible opportunity on the occasion of the Prince being entertained\r\nby the Merchant Tailors. The Prince, _Punch_ averred, was a born tailor,\r\nthe Prince of Tailors, the true British tailor. He sought to make the\r\nBritish Army invincible by rendering them so comical that, by coming\r\nrapidly on the enemy, they might convulse him with laughter and paralyse\r\nhis defence. He had fraternized with the Goose of Great Britain, and\r\nmight sit cross-legged in the eyes of posterity. After this outburst of\r\nderision _Punch_ gave the Prince a rest as tailor, but took up the\r\nrunning--or baiting--with renewed energy against his sportmanship.\r\n_Punch_, it may be noted, was not an unmitigated admirer of field\r\nsports; he denounced otter hunting as cruel, and more than once\r\nprotested against officers and others who rode their horses to death for\r\na wager. It was part of the humanitarianism which impelled him to\r\nsupport the abolition of capital punishment, though here his argument\r\nwas based on the view that death was a release for the murderer, who was\r\nmore effectually punished by being kept in life-long penance for his\r\ncrime. _Punch_ was never an enemy of fox hunting. Doubtless the\r\ninfluence of Leech counted for something. But the organized slaughter of\r\ngame filled him with disgust, and the exploits of the Prince in the\r\nHighlands in the autumn of 1842 prompted the first of many tirades.\r\n\r\nThe pheasant battues at Drayton, when the Queen and Prince Albert were\r\nthe guests of Sir Robert Peel, are treated in the same spirit, and the\r\nBallad of Windsor Chase, with its grotesque illustration of fat beagles\r\nand obese hares, the Prince on horseback, and the Queen in her pony\r\nphaeton, carries on the satire in this fashion:--\r\n\r\n    Six hares alive were taken out\r\n      Each in its canvas sack;\r\n    And five as dead as mutton, in\r\n      The same were carried back.\r\n\r\nThe battue of hares at Stowe during the Prince's visit to the Duke of\r\nBuckingham in January, 1845, is the subject of another derisive ballad\r\nmodelled on _John Gilpin_, and of a cartoon showing the Prince shooting\r\ndown the tame quarry point-blank from an easy chair. The grand climax to\r\nthis raillery, however, was reached during the Royal visit to Germany in\r\nSeptember, when the stag hunt at Gotha was scarified with pen and\r\npencil. In two parallel cartoons of \"Court Pastimes\" are contrasted the\r\nbear-baiting under Elizabeth with the butchery of stags under Victoria;\r\nand the hand of Thackeray is unmistakable in the \"Sonnick, sejested by\r\nPrince Halbert gratiously killing the Staggs at Sacks-Cobug-Gothy\":--\r\n\r\n    Some forty Ed of sleak and hantlered dear\r\n      In Cobug (where such hanimmles abound)\r\n    Were shot, as by the nusepapers I hear,\r\n      By Halbert Usband of the British Crownd.\r\n    Britannia's Queen let fall the purly tear;\r\n      Seeing them butchered in their silvn prisns;\r\n    Igspecially, when the keepers, standing round,\r\n      Came up and cut their pretty hinnocent whizns.\r\n    Suppose, instead of this pore Germing sport,\r\n      This Saxn wenison which he shoots and baggs,\r\n    Our Prins should take a turn in Capel Court\r\n      And make a massyker of English Staggs.[12]\r\n    Pore Staggs of Hengland!

The Queen wept _I saw\r\n    large tears in her eyes_: and Her Majesty tells me that she with\r\n    difficulty kept the chair during what followed. When the Queen saw\r\n    the otter hunt in Scotland, the pity that she _naturally felt_ at\r\n    the death of the animal was _counterbalanced by a knowledge of his\r\n    propensities_, so that it is almost as meritorious _to destroy an\r\n    otter as it is a snake_; but this was a totally different case; nor\r\n    is Her Majesty yet recovered. _For the Prince_, the deer were too\r\n    numerous, and _must_ be killed. _This_ was the German method; and\r\n    no doubt the reigning Duke will distribute them to his people, who\r\n    will thank Prince Albert for providing them venison.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MOMENTOUS QUESTION\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, oh tell me, dearest Albert, have _you_ any Railway Shares?\"]\r\n\r\nThis incident marked the high-water level of _Punch's_\r\nanti-Albertianism--at any rate, in the domain of sport; we find an\r\naddress of condolence to the Prince on the conclusion of the shooting\r\nseason a year and a half later, but, in the main, the criticisms of the\r\nRoyal Consort henceforth are founded on other grounds of\r\ndissatisfaction. What infuriated _Punch_ even more than the ineptitudes\r\nof the Court was the fulsome adulation of the _Lickspittle-offs_ of the\r\nPress, who were prepared, not only to defend, but to eulogize them. \"The\r\namount of good that Royalty can effect in this country is astonishing,\"\r\n_Punch_ frankly admits, while caustically adding: \"only less astonishing\r\nthan that which it has yet to do.\" But between a generous acknowledgment\r\nof what could be done by royal example (as, for instance, its\r\ndiscouragement of gambling) and the \"insanity of loyalty,\" there was an\r\nimmense gulf, and _Punch_ was never weary of gibbeting those writers in\r\nand out of the Press who thought they \"could best oppose the questioning\r\nspirit of the time--questioning, as it does, the 'divinity' that hedges\r\nthe throne--by adopting the worse than foolish adulation of a bygone\r\nage.\" Assuredly, the absolute _reductio ad absurdum_ of this\r\ncourtiership was reached when the Queen was extolled for behaving as any\r\nreasonable woman would:--\r\n\r\n    The excessively loyal man has the ugliest manner of paying a\r\n    compliment. He evidently takes his king or queen as a carved log\r\n    dropped from the skies, or he would not marvel as he does when the\r\n    aforesaid image shows any touch of life or human sympathy. If his\r\n    idol perform the commonest act of social courtesy, he roars--\"what\r\n    condescension!\" If it display the influence of affections, he\r\n    screams--\"a miracle!\" Her Majesty, on her arrival at Windsor from\r\n    Scotland, has her babies immediately brought to her: whereupon,\r\n    says _The Atlas_--\"The woman and the mother _for a moment_\r\n    proclaimed the supremacy of nature over the etiquette of a court,\r\n    and the _splendour of a diadem_!\"\r\n\r\n    What very ill-breeding on the part of \"nature\"--but then, we\r\n    presume, she is such a stranger at courts! Was there no Gold Stick\r\n    in Waiting to show the baggage to the door?\r\n\r\nThe same offender is brought to book in the following issue for\r\ndeprecating royal excursions by railway:--\r\n\r\n    _The Atlas_ thus sermonizes upon Royalty \"by the rail\":--\r\n\r\n    \"We are aware that every precaution is taken by the directors and\r\n    managers of the Great Western Railway, when Her Majesty makes use\r\n    of a special train, and we are not less acquainted with the courage\r\n    and absence of all fear from the mind of the Queen. But a long\r\n    regency in this country would be so fearful and tremendous an evil,\r\n    that we cannot but desire, in common with many others, that these\r\n    royal railway excursions should be, if possible, either wholly\r\n    abandoned or only occasionally resorted to.\"\r\n\r\n    There is danger by the railway; and therefore, says _The Atlas_,\r\n    the Queen should be only \"occasionally\" exposed to it. Say the\r\n    chances against accident are as nineteen to twenty, shall the Queen\r\n    \"take a chance\"? \"Yes,\" says loyalty, \"the Queen may _occasionally_\r\n    take a chance!\"\r\n\r\n_Punch_, as the accompanying cartoon shows, refused to take a serious\r\nview of railways where Royalty was concerned, and went to the length of\r\nmaliciously insinuating that Prince Albert, wearying of his rose-leaf\r\nfetters, had been indulging in a \"flutter\" on the Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Syncophancy Rebuked_]\r\n\r\nCriticism of the Court on the one hand and obsequious toadyism on the\r\nother were much more pronounced eighty years ago. The later vice is well\r\nrebuked in the fictitious Royal Proclamation issued in connexion with\r\nthe Queen's visit to Scotland in the autumn of 1844. It will be noticed\r\nthat here, as on so many occasions, _Punch_ adopted the device of\r\nassuming that the exalted personages adulated resented the adulation:--\r\n\r\n    Her Majesty has just issued a Proclamation, of which _Punch_ has\r\n    been favoured with an early copy.\r\n\r\n    WHEREAS, on each and every of Our Royal Movements, it has been, and\r\n    is the custom of sundry weakly-disposed persons known as \"our own\r\n    correspondents,\" \"our private correspondents,\" and others, to\r\n    write, and cause to be printed, absurd and foolish language,\r\n    touching Ourself, Our Royal Consort, and Beloved Babies--it is Our\r\n    Will and Pleasure that such foolish practices (tending as they\r\n    really do to bring Royalty into contempt) shall be discontinued;\r\n    and that from henceforth, all vain, silly, and sycophantic verbiage\r\n    shall cease, and good, straightforward, simple English be used in\r\n    all descriptions of all progresses made by Ourself, our Royal\r\n    Consort, and Our Dearly Beloved Children. And FURTHERMORE, it shall\r\n    be permitted to Our Royal Self to wear a white shawl, or a black\r\n    shawl, without any idle talk being passed upon the same. AND\r\n    FURTHER, Our Beloved Consort shall, whenever it shall so please\r\n    him, \"change his round hat for a naval cap with a gold band,\"\r\n    without calling for the special notice of the Newspapers, AND\r\n    FURTHER, That Our Beloved Child, the Princess Royal, shall be\r\n    permitted to walk \"hand in hand\" with her Royal Father, without\r\n    exciting such marked demonstrations of wonderment at the\r\n    familiarity, as have been made known to Me by the public Press.\r\n\r\n    BE IT KNOWN, That the Queen of England is not the Grand Lama; and\r\n    FURTHER BE IT REMEMBERED that Englishmen should not emulate the\r\n    vain idolatry of speech familiar in the mouths of Eastern bondmen.\r\n\r\n  VICTORIA REGINA.\r\n\r\n  Given at Blair Athol,\r\n  September 16, 1844.\r\n\r\nIn this context should be noted the constant criticisms of the _Court\r\nCircular_--the ironical suggestions that it should be published in\r\nFrench or Italian,[13] and the castigation, under the heading \"Genteel\r\nChristianity,\" of the announcement of the confirmation of the \"juvenile\r\nnobility and gentry\" by the Bishop of London in the Chapel Royal, St.\r\nJames's.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: ... \"Buckingham Palace, where, it is said, if a person\r\nputs a question in English he is asked in German or French what he\r\nmeans.\"]\r\n\r\nFive years later we come across a truly delightful suggestion, prompted\r\nby the vacancy in the Laureateship, for the employment of the new\r\noccupant of the post:--\r\n\r\n     ... The chief difficulty we see about the office, is the fact of\r\n    there being nothing to do in it. The virtues of our Queen are of\r\n    too matter-of-fact a sort, and of too everyday occurrence, to be\r\n    the subject of mere holiday odes, or, indeed, of fiction in any\r\n    shape. If any duties are to be attached to the Laureateship, we\r\n    would propose that they should consist of the task of giving a\r\n    poetical turn to that otherwise very dull and uninteresting affair,\r\n    the _Court Circular_, which fills the somewhat contemptible duty of\r\n    Paul Pry in constant attendance on what ought to be the domestic\r\n    privacy of royalty. As an illustration of what we mean, we give the\r\n    following specimen:--\r\n\r\n    This morning at an early hour,\r\n      In Osborne's peaceful grounds,\r\n    The Queen and Prince--'spite of a shower--\r\n      Took their accustomed rounds.\r\n    With them, to bear them company,\r\n      Prince Leiningen he went,\r\n    And with the other royal three,\r\n      The Duchess, eke, of Kent.\r\n\r\n    His Royal Highness Prince of Wales\r\n      Went forth to take the air;\r\n    The Princess Royal, too, ne'er fails\r\n      His exercise to share.\r\n    On the young members of the flock\r\n      Was tenderest care bestowed,\r\n    For two long hours by the clock\r\n      They walked--they ran--they rode.\r\n\r\n    Calmly away the hours wear\r\n      In Osborne's tranquil shade,\r\n    And to the dinner-party there\r\n      Was no addition made.\r\n    Judge-Advocate Sir D. Dundas\r\n      Having returned to town,\r\n    The Royal family circle has\r\n      Settled serenely down.\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to assume that _Punch's_ ridicule assisted in\r\neliminating some, at least, of these excrescences on the official record\r\nof life at Court.\r\n\r\nWe may pass over the chaff of Prince Albert as a farmer, and of his\r\nprize pigs and oxen. The bestowal of the D.C.L. degree at Cambridge in\r\nOctober, 1843, is treated with acidulated satire, and in his imaginary\r\nspeech in dog-latin the Prince presents the University with a new\r\nacademic cap (_novus pileus academicus_) of his own designing. A month\r\nlater the Prince's gratuitous distribution, through the clergy, of\r\nProfessor Buckland's pamphlet on the treatment of the potato--on the eve\r\nof the Irish famine--is described as a mockery to hungry people, \"but\r\nthen Princes are such wags,\" adds _Punch_. The much-canvassed\r\nappointment of the Prince as Chancellor of Cambridge University in 1847\r\nled to sardonic comment:--\r\n\r\n    Nothing in England has been thought too good for the members of\r\n    this happy family; but really it is rather too humiliating when we\r\n    begin to express our doubts whether we can find anything, among the\r\n    most venerable of our institutions, good enough to place at the\r\n    feet of a Prince of Saxe-Gotha.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Prince of Bricklayers]\r\n\r\nBut though the compliment is left-handed, there are symptoms of a\r\nfriendlier tone in the parallel between Prince Hal (Henry V) and Prince\r\n\"Al.\" _Punch_, furthermore, congratulates the Prince on giving up the\r\nhat-business, interesting himself in the welfare of the working classes,\r\nand contributing by his speeches and subscriptions to the advancement of\r\nsocial reform. A year later he is saluted as the Prince of\r\nBricklayers:--\r\n\r\n    His Royal Highness is now always laying the foundation stone of\r\n    some charitable institution or other.... The services of Her\r\n    Majesty's Consort ought to be duly requited, and _Punch_, in order\r\n    to reward him in kind, hereby spreads the mortar of approbation\r\n    with the trowel of sincerity, upon a Prince who really appears to\r\n    be coming out like a regular brick.\r\n\r\nBut, as we have noted elsewhere, it was the Exhibition of 1851 which,\r\nmore than anything else, tended to enhance the Prince's repute and\r\npopularity. It was a great and fruitful idea--and the Prince was its\r\nonly begetter. The speech of the Prince Consort in explaining the\r\nsignificance of the Exhibition as the realizing of the solidarity of the\r\nworld, Thackeray's May Day Ode, which appeared in _The Times_, and other\r\nutterances in the Press show, as Professor Bury points out in _The Idea\r\nof Progress_, that \"the Exhibition was, at the time, optimistically\r\nregarded not merely as a record of material achievement and technical\r\nprogress, but as a demonstration that humanity was at last on its way to\r\na better and happier state.... A vista was suggested, at the end of\r\nwhich far-sighted people might think they discerned Tennyson's\r\n'Federation of the World.'\" _Punch_ never failed to give the Prince the\r\ncredit of initiating the scheme, and, after a little wavering, gave it\r\nhis enthusiastic support. The change in public opinion towards the\r\nPrince is well reflected in the frank but friendly palinode which\r\nappeared in the issue of November 26, 1853, as a result of the\r\nsuggestion made by City magnates to erect a statue to the Prince in Hyde\r\nPark:--\r\n\r\nPRINCE _PUNCH_ TO PRINCE ALBERT\r\n\r\n    Illustrious and excellent brother,\r\n      Don't consider me rude or unkind,\r\n    If, as from one Prince to another,\r\n      I give you a bit of my mind--\r\n    And I do so with all the more roundness,\r\n      As your conduct amongst us has shown\r\n    A propriety, judgment and soundness\r\n      Of taste, not surpassed by my own.\r\n\r\n    You've respected John Bull's little oddities,\r\n      Never trod on the old fellow's corns;\r\n    Chose his pictures and statues--commodities\r\n      Wherein his own blunders he mourns.\r\n    And if you're a leetle more German\r\n      In these than I'd have you--what is't\r\n    Beyond what a critic may term an\r\n      Educational bias or twist?\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    You have never pressed forward unbidden;\r\n      When called on you've never shown shame,\r\n    Not paraded, nor prudishly hidden\r\n      Your person, your purse, or your name;\r\n    You've lent no man occasion to call you\r\n      Intruder, intriguer, or fool;\r\n    Even I've not had often to haul you\r\n      O'er the coals, or to take you to school.\r\n\r\n    All this, my dear Prince, gives me boldness--\r\n      Which, _au reste_, our positions allow--\r\n    For a hint (which you'll not charge to coldness,\r\n      After all I have written just now):\r\n    Which is to put down certain flunkies,\r\n      Who by flatt'ry your favour would earn,\r\n    Pelting praise at your head, as at monkeys\r\n      Tars throw stones--to get nuts in return.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Then silence your civic applauders,\r\n      Lest better men cease from applause.\r\n    He who tribute accepts of marauders,\r\n      Is held to be pledged to their cause.\r\n    Let no Corporate magnates of London\r\n      An honour presume to award:\r\n    Their own needs, till ill-doings be undone,\r\n      Little honour to spare can afford!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prince Punch to Prince Albert]\r\n\r\nA little later on, on the eve of the Crimean War, _Punch_ was evidently\r\nimpressed by the alleged interference of the Prince in high affairs of\r\nState. The cartoon of January 7, 1854, represents the Prince skating on\r\nthin ice marked \"Foreign Affairs--Very Dangerous,\" and _Mr. Punch_\r\nshouting to him; and in the same issue the lines \"Hint and Hypothesis\"\r\nwarn the Prince against shifting his tactics and adopting the _rôle_ of\r\nan intriguer. These rumours were so persistent that Lord Aberdeen felt\r\nit necessary to allude to them in the House of Lords at the opening of\r\nthe Session, declaring that not only was there no foundation for the\r\ncharge that the Prince had interfered with the Army or the Horse Guards,\r\nbut that he had declined the suggestion of the Duke of Wellington that\r\nhe should succeed him as Commander-in-Chief. His interest in the Army\r\nwas naturally keen, but it was general. That he was the adviser of the\r\nQueen, in his capacity of husband and most intimate companion was beyond\r\nall doubt, but Lord Aberdeen vigorously maintained that he had never\r\nuttered a single Syllable in the Council which had not tended to the\r\nhonour, the interest, and the welfare of the country. Still suspicion\r\nwas not wholly appeased, and _Punch's_ references to the Prince during\r\nthe Crimean War were none too friendly. In 1855 he is credited with the\r\nintention of heroically resigning his Field Marshal's bâton and pay, as\r\na \"noble beginning of Military Reform,\" in response to the public cry\r\nfor the dismissal of \"incompetent nobility.\" And at the end of the year\r\nhis desire to go to the Crimea is made the subject of ironic\r\nremonstrance. As a matter of fact, the reader of to-day must be told,\r\nthe intention and the desire were both inventions of _Punch_, who was\r\nplaying his favourite game of attributing to exalted personages resolves\r\nand actions which they never contemplated, but which he wanted them to\r\nmake or take, and which if they had taken, he would probably have\r\ncriticized as unnecessary and injudicious. Even more malicious was the\r\npicture of _Punch_ regarding a portrait of the Prince, exhibited in the\r\nAcademy of 1857, in Field Marshal's uniform, and saying to himself,\r\n\"What sanguinary engagement can it be?\" _Punch_ cannot be acquitted of\r\ntreating the Prince Consort--as he only now began to be generally\r\ncalled--with less than justice in view of the difficult and delicate\r\nposition he occupied. The impression was given that the Prince wanted to\r\nmeddle in the conduct of the War, and that it was necessary to prevent\r\nhim from making himself a nuisance by going to the front. And mixed with\r\nthis was the impression, which these cartoons and comments prompted,\r\nthat the Prince was making a request which he knew would be refused;\r\nthat, in short, he was at once vain-glorious, insincere, and\r\nself-protective. It was not the first time _Punch_ had been unjust to\r\nthe Prince: he had failed to recognize him as a powerful ally in the\r\ncampaign against duelling in 1843. In the main, however, it may be urged\r\nthat ridicule gave place to criticism in the latter years of the\r\nPrince's life; but the revulsion of feeling in _Punch_--and the\r\npublic--did not set in until after his death. Like Peel, the Prince\r\nConsort had to die before his services to the country were recognized.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GRASSHOPPERS' FEAST: A PROPHETIC VISION.\r\n\r\nQueen Butterfly received by Lord Grasshopper--Monday, October 28, 1844.]\r\n\r\nAs the Prince Consort was, often without just grounds, the chief cause\r\nof the unpopularity of the Court and the favourite target of satire, we\r\nhave given him priority in this survey. But, quite apart from the\r\ninfluence which he exerted, or was supposed to exert, upon her, the\r\nQueen was by no means exempt from direct censure, remonstrance, and\r\nexceedingly frank criticism. In one respect, however, the Queen was\r\ntreated with invariable consideration. Even in his most democratic days\r\n_Punch_ never caricatured the Sovereign. The portraits of the Queen are\r\nalways pleasant, even flattering. Witness the delightful picture of her\r\nvisit to the City in 1844. Though _Punch's_ pen was sharp his pencil was\r\nkind, though at times extremely familiar, as in the prophetic cartoon\r\npublished under the heading, \"A Royal Nursery Rhyme for 1860[14]\":--\r\n\r\n    There was a Royal Lady who lived in a shoe,\r\n    She had so many children she didn't know what to do.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: See Illustration.]\r\n\r\nAs early as the Christmas number of 1842 _Punch_ had given \"the\r\narrangements for the next ten years of the Royal family,\" with the names\r\nand titles of eleven princes and princesses! In the spring of 1843 he\r\ncomments, with mock sympathy, on the Queen's liability to income tax.\r\nMore serious is the charge, brought in his favourite oblique fashion,\r\nagainst the Queen for the neglect of her duties.--\r\n\r\n    TREASONOUS ATTACK ON HER MAJESTY\r\n\r\n    _Punch_ has been greatly shocked by a very treasonable letter in\r\n    the columns of _The Times_. Whether _Punch's_ friend, the Attorney\r\n    General, has had the epistle handed over to him, and contemplates\r\n    immediate proceedings against \"C. H.,\" the traitorous writer,\r\n    _Punch_ knows not; but after this information, the distinguished\r\n    law-officer cannot plead ignorance of the evil, as an apology for\r\n    future supineness. The letter purports to be a remonstrance to our\r\n    sovereign lady, the Queen; in a measure, accusing Her Gracious\r\n    Majesty of a certain degree of indifference towards the interests\r\n    of London trade, of literature, the arts and sciences. The rebel\r\n    writes as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"Buckingham Palace is neither so agreeable nor salubrious a\r\n    residence as Windsor, but neither is the crown so pleasant to wear\r\n    as a bonnet. I trust it is not necessary to remind Queen Victoria\r\n    that royalty, like property, has its _duties_ as well as its\r\n    _rights_. One of these duties is to reside in the metropolis of the\r\n    kingdom, the presence of the sovereign in the capital being\r\n    essential on many occasions. I could enumerate other duties of the\r\n    sovereign, such, for instance, as conferring fashion on public\r\n    entertainments that deserve to be encouraged by attending such\r\n    places of amusement, and countenancing science, literature and the\r\n    arts, by honouring distinguished professors with marks of\r\n    approbation; in which respect it is much to be regretted there is\r\n    too much room for those remarks on the remissness of Her Majesty in\r\n    these respects that are so frequently made in society. When we know\r\n    how much discontent, engendered by widely spread and deeply-felt\r\n    distress is expressed by persons not to be numbered among 'the\r\n    lower classes,' it is not without alarm that the influence of these\r\n    acts of omission on the part of Queen Victoria can be regarded; and\r\n    it becomes the duty of every friend of the monarchy and the\r\n    constitution to warn the Sovereign of the danger, not merely to her\r\n    personal popularity, but to the feeling of loyalty to the throne,\r\n    that is likely to accrue from such neglect.\"\r\n\r\nIn these years, and for a good many years to come, _Punch_ hunted in\r\ncouples with _The Times_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Neglect of Native Talent_]\r\n\r\nThe neglect of native talent and the encouragement of foreign artists,\r\nmusicians, men of letters, is harped upon in number after number for\r\nyear after year. Here again the method is sometimes direct, sometimes\r\noblique, as in the fictitious list of people invited to the Court:\r\nDickens, Hood, Mrs. Somerville, and Maria Edgeworth. Another opportunity\r\nwas when it was announced that the Danish Royal family had attended the\r\nfuneral of Thorwaldsen in deep mourning, _Punch_ exclaims, \"imagine for\r\na moment English Royalty in deep mourning for departed genius!\" The\r\noften-repeated visits of \"General Tom Thumb\" to Court in 1844 made him\r\nvery angry. At the second \"command\" performance the General \"personated\r\nNapoleon amid great mirth, and this was followed by a representation of\r\nGrecian statues, after which he danced a nautical hornpipe, and sang\r\nseveral of his favourite songs\" in the presence, as _Punch_ notes, of\r\nthe Queen of the Belgians, daughter of Louis Philippe. But _Punch_ had\r\nhis revenge on this curious and deep-rooted interest of Royalty in\r\ndwarfs--Queen Isabella of Spain had one permanently attached to her\r\nstaff--by indulging in a delightful speculation on the happy results\r\nthat would have ensued if George IV, like General Tom Thumb, had stopped\r\ngrowing at the age of five months:--\r\n\r\n    How much we should have been spared had George IV only weighed 15\r\n    lbs. and stopped at 25 inches! How much would have been saved\r\n    merely in tailors' bills, and how many pavilions for his dwarf\r\n    majesty might have been built at a hundredth part of the cost that\r\n    was swallowed by the royal folly at Brighton!\r\n\r\nThe Georges, it may be remarked, were no favourites of _Punch_, nor was\r\nthis to be wondered at when one recalls their treatment at the hands of\r\nThackeray, the least democratic member of the staff. _Punch_ considered\r\nthat Brummell was a better man than his \"fat friend,\" and consigned the\r\nlatter to infamy in the following caustic epitaph, one of a series on\r\nthe Four Georges:--\r\n\r\nGEORGIUS ULTIMUS\r\n\r\n        He left an example for age and for youth\r\n                      To avoid.\r\n        He never acted well by Man or Woman,\r\n      And was as false to his Mistress as to his Wife.\r\n        He deserted his Friends and his Principles.\r\n      He was so ignorant that he could scarcely spell;\r\n        But he had some skill in cutting out Coats,\r\n          And an undeniable Taste for Cookery.\r\n    He built the Palaces of Brighton and of Buckingham,\r\n        And for these Qualities and Proofs of Genius,\r\n                  An admiring Aristocracy\r\n    Christened him the \"First Gentleman in Europe.\"\r\n        Friends, respect the KING whose Statue is here,\r\n        And the generous Aristocracy who admired him.\r\n\r\nIn the same year _Punch_, with malicious inventiveness, represented\r\nQueen Victoria in the act of unveiling a great statue to Shakespeare on\r\nShakespeare Cliff, adding as her epitaph: \"She rarely went to the\r\nItalian Opera and she raised a statue to Shakespeare.\" In these\r\nagilities _The Times_ again proved a useful ally, for in the same number\r\nwe find the following:--\r\n\r\nHIGH TREASON\r\n\r\nA traitor, who signs himself \"Alpha,\" and writes in _The Times_, writes\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n    \"It is no use to conceal the fact--British high art _is hated at\r\n    Court, and dreaded by the aristocracy_. They don't want it; they\r\n    can't afford it; they think any art, which does not cultivate their\r\n    vanity or domestic affections, can have no earthly use!\"\r\n\r\n    We trust that the writer of the above will be immediately committed\r\n    to the Tower, there, in due season, to be brought to the block.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRAINING SCHOOL FOR LADIES ABOUT TO APPEAR AT COURT]\r\n\r\nIt was a letter in _The Times_ that again prompted _Punch's_\r\nremonstrance, in July, 1845, against the Queen's preference for French\r\nmilliners, and an historical contrast is rubbed in by the article on the\r\nimaginary \"Royal Poetry Books,\" or didactic poems, for the benefit of\r\nthe Royal infants, of which two specimens may be quoted:--\r\n\r\nTHE NEW SINGER OF ITALY\r\n\r\n    There was a new Singer of Italy\r\n    Who went through his part very prettily;\r\n      \"Mamma tinks him so fine,\r\n      We must have him to dine!\"\r\n    Papa remarked slily and wittily.\r\n\r\nTHE OLD SINGER OF AVON\r\n\r\n    There was an old Singer of Avon,\r\n    Who, Aunty Bess thought, was a brave one;\r\n      But Mamma doesn't care\r\n      For this stupid swan's air,\r\n    Any more than the croak of a raven.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Royal Visits and Visitors_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CALYPSO MOURNING THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES\r\n\r\nCalypso, Q----n V----a; Ulysses, K--g of the F----h.]\r\n\r\nThe Court was certainly not addicted to extravagance, but the Queen's\r\n\"bal poudré\" in June is heavily ridiculed, largely, no doubt, because of\r\n_Punch's_ frequently expressed conviction that the British never shone\r\nas masqueraders. Cobden's speech in 1848, attacking highly-paid\r\nsinecures in the Royal Household, is approved, but _Punch_ was no\r\nadvocate of parsimony. The new front of Buckingham Palace is severely\r\ncriticized in March, 1849: its only beauty is that of hiding the\r\nremainder of the building like \"a clean front put on to make the best of\r\nan indifferent shirt.\" The \"mountainous flunkeydom\" at Royal levées is\r\na frequent incentive to ridicule with pen and pencil; _Punch_ is happy\r\nin pillorying the _Morning Post_ for the use of the phrase, \"the dense\r\nmass of the nobility and gentry\" at one of Lady Derby's receptions;\r\nwhile he applauds the Queen for setting a good example by giving early\r\njuvenile parties in the season of 1850. Her visits and visitors were\r\ncarefully scrutinized and freely criticized, beginning with the Royal\r\ntour in Belgium and France in the autumn of 1843, when Queen Victoria is\r\nrepresented as mesmerizing Louis Philippe with a Commercial Treaty.\r\n_Punch_ was in frequent hot water with Louis Philippe--whom, by the way,\r\nhe once represented as Fagin--and the impending visit of the French\r\nSovereign, at the close of 1844, led to some plain talk on his folly in\r\nproscribing and impounding _Punch_, followed up by a burlesque account\r\nof his arrival at Portsmouth, with an ironical reference to the omission\r\nof all literary men, painters, musicians, sculptors, etc., from the\r\ninvitations to meet him at Court. When the French King left, _Punch_\r\nburlesqued the situation by representing the Queen as Calypso. _Punch_,\r\nlike the _Skibbereen Eagle_, always kept his eye on the Tsar of\r\nRussia--and, indeed, upon all foreign potentates. The Tsar Nicholas\r\nstood, to him, for all that was evil in \"the King business.\" His attacks\r\nbegan in 1842 and never ceased in the Tsar's lifetime. The visit to\r\nEngland in the summer of 1844 was the signal for an explosion of bitter\r\nhostility. Readers of _Punch_ are advised to carry every penny of the\r\nlargess he drops to the Polish Fund. They should be polite, but avoid\r\nany approval of his looks or manners. The Tsar's misdeeds and acts of\r\nharshness to Poles and Jews are minutely recalled. Queen Victoria is\r\nshown in a cartoon offering Poland as a bun to Nicholas the Bear at the\r\nZoo. The Tsar's lavish presents are flouted and condemned. A design for\r\nthe 500-guinea cup he offered for Ascot is made a hideous memento of\r\nsavage repression. His subscription to the Polish Ball is compared to\r\nthe action of Claude Duval fiddling to his victims. The Tsar, in short,\r\nwas \"good for Knout\"; and John Bull was being led by the nose with a\r\ndiamond ring in it. Nor has _Punch_ a single good word to say for the\r\nKing of Prussia right from 1842 to 1857. His visit in the former year,\r\n\"to strengthen the cast of the Prince of Wales's christening,\" met with\r\nanything but a friendly welcome. When he returned in the year 1844,\r\n_Punch_ profoundly distrusted the King's humility when he visited\r\nNewgate with Mrs. Fry and knelt and prayed in the female prisoners'\r\nward; and his suspicions were confirmed by his treatment of the refugee\r\nPoles, who were handed back to the mercies of Tsar Nicholas. Throughout\r\nthe entire period the King of Prussia figures as \"King Clicquot,\" from\r\nhis alleged fondness for the bottle. The King of Hanover comes off even\r\nworse. Witness the truly amazing frankness of the comments on his visit\r\nin June, 1843:--\r\n\r\nTRIUMPHAL RETURN OF THE KING OF HANOVER\r\n\r\n    The King of Hanover is once more among us. After a painful absence\r\n    of six years--intensely painful to all parties--the monarch returns\r\n    to the country of his birth, a country to which he will leave his\r\n    name, as Wordsworth says of Wallace, \"as a flower,\" odorous and\r\n    perennial. He arrives here, it is said, to be present at the\r\n    marriage of his niece, the Princess Augusta, with a German Prince,\r\n    who is not only to take an English wife, but with her three\r\n    thousand pounds per annum of English money; of money coined from\r\n    the sweat of starving thousands; money to gild the shabby Court of\r\n    Mecklenburg with new splendour. Sir Robert Peel has been, it is\r\n    said, under a course of steel draughts, and other invigorating\r\n    medicine, the better to fortify himself in his address to the\r\n    Commons for the cash. Sir Robert, however, acutely alive to our\r\n    fallen revenue, is still very nervous. It is reported that, on the\r\n    evening when the demand upon the patience and the rags of John Bull\r\n    was made, the Prime Minister blushed \"for that night only.\"\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Herein is the extreme value of the numberless scions of Royalty\r\n    with which England is over-blessed. The Duke of Cumberland (we mean\r\n    the King of Hanover) has £23,000 a year from the sweat of\r\n    Englishmen. And does not his Highness, or his Kingship, whilst\r\n    taking a salary, exercise a most salutary effect upon Britons? Does\r\n    he not practically teach them the beauty of humility--of long\r\n    suffering--of self-denying charity and benevolence? Why, he is a\r\n    continual record of the liberality and magnanimity of Englishmen,\r\n    who, if ever they fall into an excess of admiration for royalty,\r\n    will owe the enthusiasm to such bright examples as the monarch of\r\n    Hanover. In the East there are benevolent votaries who build\r\n    expensive fabrics for the entertainment of the most noisome\r\n    creatures. Englishmen are above such superstition; and in the very\r\n    pride and height of their intelligence, allow £23,000 to the King\r\n    of Hanover.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Royal Parasites]\r\n\r\nThe wedding of the Princess Augusta, daughter of the Duke of Cambridge,\r\nto the Prince of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, was the occasion of a wonderful\r\nexplosion in the _Morning Post_:--\r\n\r\n    Jenkins was present at the ceremony. He was somehow smuggled into\r\n    the Royal Chapel, and stood hidden in a corner, hidden by a huge\r\n    _bouquet_, quite another Cupid among the roses. Let us, however,\r\n    proceed to give the \"feelings\" of Jenkins, merely premising that\r\n    we should very much like to see Jenkins, when he feels \"proud,\r\n    elated and deeply moved.\" He says:\r\n\r\n    \"We felt alternately proud, elated, and deeply moved during the\r\n    ceremony as _in turn_ we cast a glance at the illustrious witnesses\r\n    to the solemnity. There was our gracious Queen, beaming with youth\r\n    and beauty, _through which is ever discernible the eagle glance_\r\n    and the imposing air of command so well suited to her high station.\r\n    Next to the Queen, the Royal Consort, _one of the handsomest\r\n    Princes of the age_, in whom the spirit of youth is so remarkably\r\n    tempered by the _judgment and wisdom of age_. The Queen Adelaide,\r\n    living model of every Virtue which can adorn a Woman either in\r\n    private life or on a throne.\"\r\n\r\n    So far the _Morning Post_. What says (perhaps?) an equal authority,\r\n    _The Times_?\r\n\r\n    \"The Queen Dowager was prevented from being present at the Ceremony\r\n    in consequence of indisposition.\"\r\n\r\nThe old Duke Adolphus Frederick of Cambridge was another target of\r\nnever-ending ridicule. He was a great diner-out, and his fatuous\r\nafter-dinner speeches are cruelly parodied. He was also \"the Duke who\r\nthinks aloud,\" whether at the play or at the Chapel Royal:--\r\n\r\n    A few Sundays ago, the Minister and the Duke proceeded as follows:\r\n\r\n    _Minister._ From all evil and mischief; from sin, from the crafts\r\n    of the devil----\r\n\r\n    (_Duke._ To be sure; very proper--very proper.)\r\n\r\n    _Minister._ From all sedition, conspiracy, and rebellion----\r\n\r\n    (_Duke._ Certainly; very right--very right.)\r\n\r\n    And thus Parson and Duke proceeded together almost to the end.\r\n    However, the worthy clergyman had to offer a prayer for the sick.\r\n    Proceeding in this pious task, he thus commenced:\r\n\r\n    _Minister._ The prayers of this congregation are earnestly desired\r\n    for----\r\n\r\n    (_Duke._ No objection--no objection!)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A Royal Duke's Household_]\r\n\r\nOne certainly does not gather from _Punch's_ pages what was none the\r\nless a fact, that the Duke was extremely popular, that he was charitable\r\nand benevolent, and an enlightened patron of science and art, or that he\r\nwas emphatically recognized as \"a connecting link between the throne and\r\nthe people.\"\r\n\r\nOn the Duke's death in 1850, _Punch_, with his usual vigour, attacked\r\nthe grant of £12,000 a year to his son, the late and last Duke of\r\nCambridge, at a time when the claims of Horatia (Nelson's daughter) and\r\nMrs. Waghorn, widow of the pioneer of the Overland Route, were\r\nneglected. The immediate sequel led to further caustic remarks:--\r\n\r\nFOUR EQUERRIES AND THREE CHAPLAINS\r\n\r\n    What can a quiet, kind, manly, and simple gentleman, Prince though\r\n    he be of the British Blood Royal, want at this present period of\r\n    time with four Equerries and three parsons in the Gazette? Are\r\n    these ceremonies nowadays useful and decorous, or absurd and\r\n    pitiable; and likely to cause the scorn and laughter of men of\r\n    sense? When the greatest and wisest Statesman in England [Sir\r\n    Robert Peel] dying declares he will have no title for his sons,\r\n    and, as it were, repudiates the Peerage as a part of the Protective\r\n    system which must fall one day, as other Protective institutions\r\n    have fallen--can't sensible people read the signs of the times and\r\n    be quiet? When Lord John comes down to the House (with that pluck\r\n    which his Lordship always shows when he has to meet an unpopular\r\n    measure) and asks for an allowance, which the nation grudgingly\r\n    grants to its pensioners--when the allowance is flung at his Royal\r\n    Highness with a grumble, is it wise to come out the next day with a\r\n    tail of four Equerries and three clergymen?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MODERN DAMOCLES]\r\n\r\nLouis Napoleon stands apart from the other European sovereigns of the\r\nmid-nineteenth century in virtue of his origin and his career. But he\r\nran the Tsar Nicholas close, if he did not equal him, as _Punch's_ pet\r\naversion. As early as 1849 his imperialistic ambitions led to the\r\nhostile comment that \"empire\" meant _empirer_. The _Coup d'État_ was the\r\nsignal for the fiercest attacks on his policy of \"homicide.\" His\r\nmatrimonial ventures prompted the ribald suggestion that the Emperor\r\nLouis should marry Lola Montez! His persistent gagging of the Press in\r\nFrance, and his attempts to subsidize or manipulate that in England, are\r\nvehemently denounced. _Punch's_ attacks ceased during the Crimean War,\r\nbut it was a reluctant truce, and they broke out again after the Peace\r\nwas signed. Douglas Jerrold cordially detested the Emperor, and was\r\nresponsible for the hardest of the many hard things said against him in\r\n_Punch_.\r\n\r\nBy a strange irony of fate it was Douglas Jerrold's own son, William\r\nBlanchard Jerrold, who, working upon materials supplied him by the\r\nEmpress Eugénie, produced in the four volumes of his _Life of Napoleon\r\nIII_ the chief _apologia_ in English of the Second Empire.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the Queen and the English Royal Family. Amongst\r\n_Punch's_ unconscious prophecies room must certainly be found for his\r\nreference, in a satire of the Queen's speech when Peel was Premier, to\r\nHer Majesty as \"Victoria Windsor\" nearly seventy-five years before the\r\nsurname was formally adopted by her grandson. The suggested statue to\r\nCromwell at the new Houses of Parliament gave rise to a long and heated\r\ncontroversy in 1845 in which _Punch_ ranged himself militantly among the\r\npartisans of the Protector. He published mock protests from various\r\nsovereigns; he considered Cromwell's claim side by side with those of\r\nthe \"Sexigamist\" murderer Henry VIII and other kings, and printed a\r\nburlesque design of his own, with a sneer at Pugin for his \"determined\r\nzeal in keeping up the bad drawing of the Middle Ages.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHOULD CROMWELL HAVE A STATUE?]\r\n\r\nThe Queen's visit to Ireland in 1849 is treated in considerable detail,\r\nand in an optimistic vein. _Punch_ never believed in the Repeal\r\nAgitation or in Daniel O'Connell, whom he regarded as a trading patriot\r\nand a self-seeking demagogue, contrasting him unfavourably with Father\r\nMathew. Nor had he any sympathy with \"Young Ireland,\" or Thomas Davis,\r\nor the romantic leaders of the movement of 1848; as for Smith O'Brien,\r\nan immortality of ridicule was conferred on him in Thackeray's famous\r\nballad on \"The Battle of Limerick.\" The terrible ravages of the potato\r\nfamine had evoked _Punch's_ sympathy; but his hopes of an enduring\r\nreconciliation were small, and he quotes the tremendous saying of\r\nGiraldus Cambrensis that Ireland would be pacified _vix paulò ante Diem\r\nJudicii_--or only just before the Day of Judgment. Still, the Queen's\r\nvisit was hailed as of good omen, though _Punch_ reminds her that she\r\nhad only seen the bright side of the dark Rosaleen--palaces and not\r\ncabins. \"Let Erin _forget_ the days of old\" is the burden of his song;\r\nat least he refrained from quoting--if he ever knew of it--that other\r\nterrible saying that \"Ireland never forgets anything except the benefits\r\nthat she has received.\" The Queen's magnanimity and clemency to her\r\ntraducer Jasper Judge in the same year called forth a warm eulogium.\r\nJudge was a thief and a spy, yet the Queen, on the petition of his wife,\r\npaid the costs of her vilifier.\r\n\r\nIn 1849, also, _Punch_, evidently still in mellower mood, published an\r\nenthusiastic tribute to the memory of the Dowager Queen Adelaide, who\r\ndied on December 2. _Punch_ specially refers to her generosity to Mrs.\r\nJordan, the mistress of William IV, when he was Duke of Clarence, and\r\nthe mother of ten of his children. \"Let those who withhold their aid\r\nfrom the daughter of Nelson, because the daughter of Lady Hamilton,\r\nconsider this and know that the best chastity is adorned by the largest\r\ncharity.\" Queen Adelaide had long outlived the unpopularity caused by\r\nher supposed interference in politics at the time of the Reform\r\nAgitation, and _Punch's_ homage was well deserved. It is a sign of the\r\ntimes that _Punch_ begins to allude to the Queen as \"our good Queen,\" or\r\nmore affectionately as \"our little Queen,\" and this growth of her\r\npopularity continues (with occasional setbacks) throughout the 'fifties.\r\nAt the close of 1852 _Punch_ ridicules as absurd the rumour of the\r\nbetrothal of the Princess Royal to Prince Frederick William of Prussia,\r\nthe Princess being only twelve years old. The report appeared in a\r\nGerman paper, and proved true. _Punch's_ chief objection was\r\nsentimental: \"The age is past when Royalty respected its family at the\r\nrate of live stock,\" and he could not believe that such a principle\r\nwould govern the Court, seeing that it was \"adorned now at last with the\r\ndomestic graces.\" Besides, _Punch_ in the summer of 1844 had published\r\nhis own New Royal Marriage Act (suggested by _The Times's_ comment on\r\nthe late Duke of Sussex's love letters), which winds up: \"Be it\r\ntherefore enacted that a member of the Royal Family shall be at liberty\r\nto marry whom or how or when, where or anywhere, he or she likes or\r\npleases.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Princess Royal's Betrothal_]\r\n\r\nScepticism of the report animates the set of verses published three\r\nyears later:--\r\n\r\nABSURD RUMOUR OF AN APPROACHING MARRIAGE IN THE HIGHEST LIFE\r\n\r\n    They say that young Prussia our Princess will wed,\r\n    Which shows that we can't believe half that is said.\r\n    What? she marry the nephew of Clicquot the mean!\r\n    The friend and ally of the foe of the Queen?\r\n\r\n    Why, nothing keeps Clicquot from standing array'd\r\n    Against her in arms, but his being afraid.\r\n    His near kinsman the spouse of Her Majesty's child!\r\n    Pooh!--the notion is monstrous, preposterous, wild.\r\n\r\n    The Princess is--bless her!--scarce fifteen years old;\r\n    One summer more even o'er _Dinah_ had roll'd.\r\n    To marry so early she can't be inclined;\r\n    A suitable _Villikins_ some day she'll find.\r\n\r\n    Moreover, in her case, we know very well,\r\n    There exist no \"stern parients\" her hand to compel,\r\n    Affording the Laureate a theme for a lay,\r\n    With a burden of \"Teural lal leural li day.\"\r\n\r\nWhether the German newspaper had been merely exercising \"intelligent\r\nanticipation\" or not, the projected alliance was confirmed in 1856.\r\n_Punch's_ comment on the Princess's dowry was unsympathetic, but the\r\nbetrothal was celebrated in verse at once ceremonial and friendly.\r\nReferences to the Queen during the Crimean War are noticed elsewhere; we\r\nmay note, however, that when one \"Raphael\" published a Prophetic\r\nAlmanack in which he took liberties with the Queen's name, _Punch_\r\nadministered a severe castigation to the offender. _Punch_ did not like\r\nhis monopoly to be infringed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OLD NOBILITY\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween the aristocracy as depicted in the pages of _Punch_ and in those\r\nof the _Morning Post_ in the 'forties and 'fifties there is a wide gulf.\r\nAs we have seen, _Punch's_ admiration of the Duke of Wellington stopped\r\na long way this side of idolatry. Yet even when the Duke was criticized\r\nmost severely as a politician, the recognition of his greatness was not\r\ndenied. A good example is to be found in the cartoon of the \"Giant and\r\nthe Dwarf,\" which was inspired by Napoleon's legacy to the subaltern\r\nCantillon, who was charged with an attempt to murder Wellington.\r\nWellington himself had been approached with a view to similar action\r\nagainst Napoleon, and here was his reply:--\r\n\r\n    \"---- wishes to kill him; but I have told him that I shall\r\n    remonstrate; I have likewise said that, as a private friend, I\r\n    advised him to have nothing to do with so foul a transaction; and\r\n    that he and I had acted too distinguished parts in these\r\n    transactions to become executioners; and that I was determined\r\n    that, if the sovereigns wished to put him to death, they should\r\n    appoint an executioner, which would not be me.\"[15]\r\n\r\nThe cartoon is accompanied by this comment:--\r\n\r\n    The Duke has made his political blunders and in his time talked\r\n    political nonsense as well as his inferiors. Moreover he exhibits a\r\n    defective sympathy with the people.... Nevertheless, contrasting\r\n    Wellington's answer to the proposed death of the ex-Emperor with\r\n    Napoleon's reward of the would-be assassin of the General (i.e.\r\n    Wellington himself), need we ask which is the Giant and which is\r\n    the Dwarf?\r\n\r\nOther dukes cut a less dignified figure in the lean years which preceded\r\nthe repeal of the Corn Laws--whether as coal-owners, Protectionists, or\r\nstrict enforcers of the Game-Laws.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Colonel Garwood's selections from the Duke of Wellington's\r\nDispatches.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRY MARQUESS OF WATERFORD: A NEW STATUE OF ACHILLES\r\n\r\nCast from Knockers taken in the vicinities of Sackville Street, Vigo\r\nLane, and Waterloo Place.]\r\n\r\nThe first hint of the long campaign against the Dukes of Bedford in\r\nconnexion with \"Mud Salad Market\" occurs in February, 1844. The Dukes of\r\nSutherland, Atholl, Norfolk and Buckingham all came under the lash. When\r\nLord William Lennox's plagiarisms from Hood and Scott in his novel _The\r\nTuft-hunter_ were exposed, _Punch_ printed this jingling epigram:--\r\n\r\n    A Duke once declared--and most solemnly too--\r\n    That whatever he liked with his own he would do;\r\n    But the son of a Duke has gone farther, and shown\r\n    He will do what he likes with what isn't his own!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Marquesses under the Microscope_]\r\n\r\nAnd the marquesses came off even worse. The eccentric Marquess of\r\nWaterford is celebrated for his knocker-hunting exploits in the very\r\nfirst number. The Marquess of Hertford--the original of Thackeray's\r\nMarquess of Steyne in _Vanity Fair_--is subjected to posthumous obloquy,\r\n_à propos_ of the claim of his valet on his executors, who \"were\r\ncompelled to bring the dead Marquess into Court, that the loathsome dead\r\nmay declare the greater loathsomeness of the living.\" The Marquess of\r\nLondonderry came under the lash not merely as a rapacious coal-owner,\r\nbut as a bad writer: \"the most noble but not the most grammatical\r\nMarquess.\" So again we are informed respecting the Marquess of\r\nNormanby's novels that \"they have just declared a dividend of 2½d. in\r\nthe pound, which is being paid at all the butter shops.\" One has to wait\r\nfor nearly ten years for acknowledgment of virtue in the marquisate, but\r\nthen it is certainly handsome. The occasion was the entrance into power\r\nof the Derby-Disraeli (or \"Dilly-Dizzy\") Cabinet:--\r\n\r\nTHE MARQUIS OF LANSDOWNE AND THE NEW MINISTRY\r\n\r\nThe first act of the Ministry in the House of Lords was done with\r\nthe worst of grace. The Marquis of Lansdowne took farewell of\r\noffice and of official life. And who was there, among the new men,\r\nto do reverence to the unstudied yet touching ceremony? Nobody,\r\nsave the Earl of Malmesbury. _The Times_ says, and most truly:\r\n\r\n    \"A public life, which has literally embraced the first half of this\r\n    century, and which last night was most gracefully concluded,\r\n    deserved an ampler and richer tribute than our new Foreign\r\n    Secretary seemed able to bestow.\"\r\n\r\nNothing could be colder, meaner, and certainly more foreign to the\r\nheartiness of English generosity than the chip-chip phrases of Lord\r\nMalmesbury. It is such men as the Marquis of Lansdowne who are the true\r\nstrength of the House of Lords. He is a true Englishman. In fifty years\r\nof political life his name has never been mixed with aught mean or\r\njobbing. In the most tempestuous times, his voice has been heard amongst\r\nthe loudest for right. In days when to be a reformer was to take rank a\r\nlittle above a fanatic and a public despoiler, the Marquis of Lansdowne\r\nstruck at rotten boroughs. He has ever been a patriot in the noblest\r\nsense. And there was nobody but cold-mouthed Malmesbury to touch upon\r\nhis doings? So it is!\r\n\r\n    Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back\r\n    Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,\r\n    A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:\r\n    Those scraps are good deeds past.\r\n\r\nBut the political deeds of the Marquis of Lansdowne are written in the\r\nhistory of his country. After the wear of fifty years, not one spot\r\nrests upon his robes. His coronet borrows worth and lustre from the\r\ntrue, manly, English brain that beats--(and in the serene happiness of\r\nhonoured age may it long continue to beat!)--beneath it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Educating the House of Lords_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: APPROPRIATE\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN: \"I say, Bill--I wonder what he calls hisself?\"\r\n\r\nSECOND DITTO: \"Blowed if I know!--but I calls him a Bloated\r\nHaristocrat.\"]\r\n\r\nAs for peers in general, _Punch's_ views may be gathered from his scheme\r\nfor the Reform of the House of Lords issued in the same year:--\r\n\r\n    It is an indisputable truth that there can be no such being as a\r\n    born legislator. As unquestionable is the fact that there may be a\r\n    born ass.\r\n\r\n    We are not proving that fact--only stating it--_pace_ your\r\n    word-snapper on the look-out for a snap.\r\n\r\n    But your born ass may be born to your legislator's office, and\r\n    command a seat in the house of legislators by inheritance, as in\r\n    not a few examples, wherein the coronet hides not the donkey's\r\n    ears.\r\n\r\n    The object of a Reform in the House of Lords should be to keep the\r\n    asinines of the aristocracy out of it: so that the business of the\r\n    country may be no more impeded by their braying, or harmed by their\r\n    kicking.\r\n\r\n    Nobody is a physician by birth. Even the seventh son of a seventh\r\n    son must undergo an examination before he is allowed to prescribe a\r\n    dose of physic for an old woman.\r\n\r\n    But any eldest son, or other male relation, of a person of a\r\n    certain order is chartered, as such, to physic the body corporate:\r\n    which is absurd.\r\n\r\n    Now, the Reform we propose for the House of Lords, is, not to admit\r\n    any person, whose only claim to membership is that of having been\r\n    born a Peer, to practise his profession without examination.\r\n\r\n    Examine him in the Alphabet--there have been Peers who didn't know\r\n    that. In reading, writing, and arithmetic: you already make a\r\n    Lord--the Mayor of London--count hobnails. In history--for he is to\r\n    help furnish materials for its next page. In geography, astronomy,\r\n    and the use of the globes; which, being indispensable to ladies,\r\n    are _a fortiori_ to be required of Lords. In political economy, the\r\n    physiology of the Constitution which he will have to treat. In\r\n    medicine, that he may understand the analogies of national and\r\n    individual therapeutics; and also learn not to patronize\r\n    homoeopaths and other quacks. In geology, that he may acquire a\r\n    philosophical idea of pedigree, by comparing the bones of his\r\n    ancestors with those of the ichthyosaurus, or the foundation of his\r\n    house with the granite rocks. In the arts and sciences, generally,\r\n    which it will be his business to promote, if he does his business.\r\n    In literature, that he may cultivate it; at least, respect it, and\r\n    stand up for the liberty of unlicensed printing, instead of\r\n    insulting and calumniating the Press.\r\n\r\n    This is our scheme of Peerage Reform, to which the principal\r\n    objection we anticipate is, that it is impracticable, because it\r\n    can't be done; and that, warned by the confusion and disorder that\r\n    has resulted from change in foreign nations, we should shrink from\r\n    touching a time-honoured institution; which is as much as to say,\r\n    that because our neighbours have divided their carotid arteries, we\r\n    had better not shave ourselves.\r\n\r\nTo \"most noble fatuities,\" \"Lord White Sticks,\" privileged gamblers,\r\nextravagant guardsmen, pluralists (among whom the Greys and Elliots are\r\nspecially attacked), and their fulsome upholders in the Press, scant\r\nmercy is shown. Some exceptions are made: Lord Mahon for his interest in\r\nthe drama and art; Lord Albemarle for his views on the Reform of the\r\nMarriage Laws; Lord St. Leonards for cutting down Chancery pleadings and\r\nall the \"awful and costly machinery of word spinning\" connected\r\ntherewith. With Lord Brougham, who was so long one of _Punch's_\r\nfavourite butts, we deal elsewhere. But neither he nor Sugden (Lord St.\r\nLeonards) belonged to the \"Old Nobility\"; they were not ranked with the\r\n\"snobbish peers\" who opposed the education of the masses or the\r\nappointment of a Minister of Education, or wanted to keep poor children\r\nout of the London parks, a topic referred to more than once.\r\n\r\nAristocratic nepotism is another favourite theme of satire: the classic\r\nexample being furnished by the famous telegram sent during the Crimean\r\nWar by Lord Panmure, when Secretary for War, to Lord Raglan: \"Take care\r\nof Dowb.\" \"Dowb.\" was Captain Dowbiggin, a relative of Lord Panmure's.\r\nHence the epigram:--\r\n\r\nCE N'EST QUE LE PREMIER PAS QUI COÛTE\r\n\r\n    \"The reform of our army,\" should Panmure ask, \"how begin?\"\r\n    \"By not taking,\" says _Punch_, \"quite so much care of Dowbiggin.\"\r\n\r\nWith Bulwer Lytton a long feud was maintained, but it was not as a peer\r\nbut as a writer and a sophisticated snob that he earned the dislike of\r\n_Punch_, who published (February 28, 1846) Tennyson's retort on his\r\ntraducer. In later years, however, a complete reconciliation took place.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Thackeray on Great Folks_]\r\n\r\n_Punch_ saw no inherent virtue in peers or peerages. He welcomed the\r\nbestowal of one on Macaulay; he applauded the decision of Peel's family\r\nin declining the honour after his death. Mentions by name of noble\r\npersonages in his pages in this period are more often hostile than\r\nfriendly. He agreed with Tennyson that \"kind hearts are more than\r\ncoronets,\" but he was far from maintaining that they were incompatible.\r\nThackeray, who, as we know, did not see eye to eye with Douglas Jerrold,\r\nand found his constant anti-aristocratic invective tiresome, redressed\r\nthe balance, notably in \"Mr. Brown's Letters to a Young Man about Town.\"\r\nDiscoursing on good women, in whose company you can't think evil, he\r\nsays you may find them in the suburbs and Mayfair, and, again:--\r\n\r\n    The great comfort of the society of great folks is that they do not\r\n    trouble themselves about your twopenny little person, as smaller\r\n    persons do, but take you for what you are--a man kindly and\r\n    good-natured, or witty and sarcastic, or learned and eloquent, or a\r\n    good _raconteur_, or a very handsome man, or an excellent gourmand\r\n    and judge of wine--or what not. Nobody sets you so quickly at your\r\n    ease as a fine gentleman. I have seen more noise made about a\r\n    Knight's lady than about the Duchess of Fitz-Battleaxe herself; and\r\n    Lady Mountararat, whose family dates from the Deluge, enter and\r\n    leave a room, with her daughters the lovely Ladies Eve and Lilith\r\n    D'Arc, with much less pretension, and in much simpler capotes and\r\n    what-do-you-call-'ems, than Lady de Mogins, or Mrs. Shindy, who\r\n    quit an assembly in a whirlwind, with trumpets and alarums like a\r\n    stage King and Queen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIETY--EXCLUSIVE, GENTEEL, AND SHABBY GENTEEL\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the manners and customs of High Life in the 'forties and 'fifties\r\n_Punch_ cannot be regarded as a first-rate authority for the excellent\r\nreason that, with the exception of Thackeray, none of the staff had the\r\n_entrée_ to these exalted circles. They were busy, hard-worked, often\r\noverworked, journalists and officials, and their recreations and\r\ndiversions did not bring them into intimate contact with the dwellers in\r\nMayfair or Belgravia. They kept a watchful eye upon the extravagances\r\nand vagaries of High Life, but mainly as it revealed itself in its\r\npublic form or in politics. In the study of the Geology of Society,\r\nwhich appeared in one of his earliest numbers, _Punch_ subdivides the\r\nthree main strata of Society--High Life, Middle Life, Low Life--into\r\nvarious classes. The superior, or St. James's series, contains people\r\nwearing coronets, related to coronets, expecting coronets. Thence we\r\npass to the Russell Square group, and the Clapham group, and thence to\r\nthe \"inferior series\" resident in Whitechapel and St. Giles, and it was\r\nof these groups, especially the transitional, genteel and shabby\r\ngenteel, that _Punch_, in his earliest days, had most first-hand\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Almack's_]\r\n\r\nThe exclusiveness of fashionable society cannot be better illustrated\r\nthan by the existence of such an institution as Almack's. It was nothing\r\nless than a stroke of genius on the part of that shrewd Scot from\r\nGalloway--Almack is said to have been an inversion of his real name,\r\nMacCaul, though another account of his origin represents him as a\r\nYorkshire Quaker--who came to London as a valet to the Duke of Hamilton,\r\nand, soon after starting Almack's Club, a fashionable resort for\r\naristocratic gamblers, afterwards merged in Brooks's, opened the famous\r\nAssembly Rooms in King Street, St. James's, where, for more than\r\nseventy-five years, weekly subscription balls were held during the\r\ntwelve weeks of the London season. Almack gave his name to the Assembly\r\nRooms, but the management was entirely vested in the hands of a\r\ncommittee of lady patronesses of the highest rank and fashion, who\r\ndistributed the ten-guinea tickets. By the beginning of the nineteenth\r\ncentury it was \"the seventh heaven of the fashionable world to be\r\nintroduced to Almack's.\" Grantley Berkeley, who frequented the Assembly\r\nRooms in their golden prime, speaks of the committee as \"a feminine\r\noligarchy, less in number, but equal in power to the Venetian Council of\r\nTen.\" They issued the tickets \"for the gratification of the _crême de la\r\ncrême_ of Society, with a jealous watchfulness to prevent the intrusion\r\nof the plebeian rich or the untitled vulgar; and they drew up a code of\r\nlaws, for the select who received invitations, which they, at least,\r\nmeant to be as unalterable as those of the Medes and Persians.\"[16]\r\nGreat care was taken that the supply of _débutantes_ should not exceed\r\nthe demand, and so many engagements were entered into to the\r\naccompaniment of Collinet's band that Almack's was regarded as, perhaps,\r\nthe greatest matrimonial market of the aristocracy. The maximum\r\nattendance recorded was seventeen hundred. Almack himself died in 1781,\r\nbequeathing the Assembly Rooms to his niece, who married Willis, after\r\nwhom they were subsequently named. By 1840 their glory had largely\r\ndeparted, but so serious a review as the _Quarterly_ wrote respectfully\r\nof their decline: \"The palmy days of exclusiveness are gone by in\r\nEngland. Though it is obviously impossible to prevent any given number\r\nof persons from congregating and re-establishing an oligarchy, we are\r\nquite sure that the attempt would be ineffectual, and that the sense of\r\ntheir importance would extend little beyond the set.\" Yet Almack's\r\nlingered for several years. In its august precincts, which had welcomed\r\nand sanctioned the waltz (originally condemned as an unseemly\r\nexhibition), the ravages of the successor of the waltz and\r\nquadrille--the polka--are described by _Punch_ (after Byron) in the\r\nlament of the sentimental young lady at the close of the season of 1844.\r\nThe craze for dancing was not so widely diffused as in 1920, but to\r\njudge from the \"History, Symptoms, and Progress of the Polkamania,\" all\r\nstrata of Society were affected:--\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: _Vide_ Grantley Berkeley's _Recollections_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE POLKA\r\n\r\n1. My Polka before Six Lessons.\r\n\r\n2. My Polka after Six Lessons.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Polkamania_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MANNERS AND CVSTOMS OF YE ENGLYSHE IN 1849\r\n\r\nAN \"AT HOME\". YE POLKA.]\r\n\r\n    That obstinate and tormenting disease, the Polkamania, is said to\r\n    have originated in Bohemia; in consequence, we may presume from\r\n    analogy, of the bite of some rabid insect like the Tarantula\r\n    Spider, although the Polka Spider has not yet been described by\r\n    entomologists; but, when discovered, it probably will be under the\r\n    name of _Aranea Polkapoietica_. The Polkamania, after raging\r\n    fiercely for some time in the principal cities of the Continent, at\r\n    length made its appearance in London, having been imported by M.\r\n    Jullien, who inoculated certain Countesses and others with its\r\n    specific virus, which he is said to have obtained from a Bohemian\r\n    nobleman. The form of its eruption was at first circular,\r\n    corresponding to the circles of fashion; but it has now extended to\r\n    the whole body of society, including its lowest members. Its chief\r\n    symptoms are extraordinary convulsions and wild gesticulations of\r\n    the limbs, with frequent stampings on the floor, and rotatory\r\n    movements of the body, such as accompany lesions of the\r\n    _cerebellum_. That part is said by Gall to be the organ of\r\n    amativeness; and the Polka delirium, in several instances, has\r\n    terminated in love-madness. This form of mania, in the female\r\n    subject, displays itself, partly, in a passion for fantastic\r\n    finery; as fur trimmings, red, green and yellow boots, and other\r\n    strange bedizenments. Articles of dress, indeed, seem capable of\r\n    propagating the contagion; for there are Polka Pelisses and Polka\r\n    Tunics; now, it was but the other day that we met with some Polka\r\n    Wafers, so that the Polkamania seems communicable by all sorts of\r\n    things that put it into people's heads. In this respect it\r\n    obviously resembles the Plague; but not in this respect only; for,\r\n    go where you will, you are sure to be plagued with it. After\r\n    committing the greatest ravages in London itself, it attacked the\r\n    suburbs, whence it quickly spread to remote districts, and there is\r\n    now not a hamlet in Great Britain which it does not infest more or\r\n    less. Its chief victims are the young and giddy; but as yet it has\r\n    not been known to prove fatal, although many, ourselves included,\r\n    have complained of having been bored to death by it. No cure has as\r\n    yet been proposed for Polkamania; but perhaps an antidote,\r\n    corresponding to vaccination, in the shape of some new jig or other\r\n    variety of the caper, may prove effectual: yet, after all, it may\r\n    be doubted if the remedy would not be worse than the disease.\r\n\r\nVery little change would be needed to fit the above to the Jazzmania of\r\nto-day. The polka had a long innings. When the 'forties opened, the\r\nwaltz and the quadrille were firmly entrenched in fashionable favour.\r\nThe waltz, as we write, shows signs of rearing its diminished head, but\r\nthe quadrille, in those days a most elaborate business with a variety of\r\nfigures--La Pastorale, L'Été, La Trénitz, La Poule, etc.--is dead beyond\r\nredemption. But the polka mania raged with little abatement for a good\r\nten years.[17] In 1844, amongst other advertisements of teachers of the\r\nart of dancing, was that of a young lady who had been instructed by a\r\nBohemian nobleman. In spite of much ridicule and many appeals (in which\r\nThackeray joined) for the suppression of the pest, the malady was\r\ndescribed as still acute in the dog-days of 1856, and, in more subdued\r\nphases, lasted for another fifty years. The mazurka also came into vogue\r\nin the mid-'forties, but was never a serious rival to the polka in its\r\nprime. It was an age of famous professional dancers--Taglioni (who gave\r\nher name to an overcoat), Fanny Ellsler, Cerito, and Grisi, the cousin\r\nof the _prima-donna_; but though there were schools of dancing, and\r\n_Thés dansants_, which _Punch_ heavily ridiculed, and though the\r\nfashionables occasionally secured the exclusive use of the lawns at\r\nCremorne, there was no competition between amateurs and professionals,\r\nas in modern times. The latter were left the monopoly of the higher\r\nflights of the art. Besides the polka, the accomplishments of the young\r\nlady of fashion were mainly decorative. If they did not toil or spin, at\r\nleast they occupied themselves with fancy knitting, crochet, and the\r\npractice of Poonah painting--an early and crude imitation of Oriental\r\nart, so popular that the advertisements of instructors in \"Indian Poonah\r\npainting\" figure in the newspapers and directories of the time. The\r\nfashionable pets were spaniels, macaws, and Persian cats. The prevailing\r\ntastes in art and letters in fashionable or genteel society are\r\n(allowing for a little exaggeration) not badly hit off in a paper on the\r\nNatural History of Courtship, giving hints for the nice conduct of\r\nconversation at a social gathering:--\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: A correspondent wrote to _The Times_ in 1846 complaining\r\nthat at Ramsgate \"the ladies dance polkas in their bathing dresses,\" and\r\nsuggesting a stricter supervision of the proprieties by policemen.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Modish Futilities_]\r\n\r\n    It hath been wisely ordained, wherever two individuals of opposite\r\n    sexes are standing side by side, that during the pauses of \"the\r\n    figure,\" or otherwise, the gentleman shall ask the lady if she be\r\n    fond of dancing; the reply will be, \"Yes, very,\" for it is known to\r\n    be an unvarying rule that all young ladies are fond of dancing.\r\n    That, therefore, affords no clue, nor indeed much subject for\r\n    converse; hence another question succeeds, \"Are you fond of music?\"\r\n    Answer, without exception, \"Yes\"--general rule as before; but when\r\n    the rejoinder comes, \"What instrument do you play?\" although the\r\n    reply in that case always made and provided is \"the piano,\" yet the\r\n    mention of a few composers' names will soon inform you of the kind\r\n    of musical taste the fair one possesses. If she admire Herz, you\r\n    will know she belongs to the thunder-and-lightning school of \"fine\r\n    players\"; therefore, breathe not the names of Mozart, Beethoven, or\r\n    Cramer. Should she own to singing, and call Mercadante \"grand\" or\r\n    Donizetti \"exquisite,\" do not mention Weber or Schubert, but say a\r\n    word or two for Alexander Lee.[18]\r\n\r\n    It will frequently occur that (always excepting the first two\r\n    queries) a young lady will answer your questions with\r\n    indifference--almost contempt--in the belief that you are a very\r\n    commonplace soulless person. She has, you will find, a tinge of\r\n    romance in her character; therefore, lose not a moment in plunging\r\n    over head-and-ears into a talk about poetry. Should Byron or\r\n    Wordsworth fail, try T. K. Hervey, or Barry Cornwall, but Moore is\r\n    most strongly recommended. If you think you can trust yourself to\r\n    do a little poetry on your own account, dash it slightly with\r\n    meta-physics. Wherever you discover a tinge of blueism or romance,\r\n    the mixture of \"the moon,\" \"the stars,\" and \"the human mind,\" with\r\n    common conversation is highly efficacious. When the latter\r\n    predominates in the damsel, an effective parting speech may be\r\n    quoted from _Romeo and Juliet_, which will bring in a reflection\r\n    upon the short duration of the happiness you have enjoyed, and the\r\n    quotation:\r\n\r\n    \"I never knew a young gazelle,\" etc.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _\"Finishing\" a Daughter_]\r\n\r\nThis was written in _Punch_ in July, 1842, but there is not much\r\ndifference in the estimate of the feminine intellect given ten years\r\nlater:--\r\n\r\n    HOW TO \"FINISH\" A DAUGHTER\r\n\r\n    1.

Initiate her into the principle that it is vulgar to do anything\r\n    for herself.\r\n\r\n    8. To strengthen the latter belief, let her have a lady's maid.\r\n\r\n    9. And lastly, having given her such an education, marry her to a\r\n    clerk in the Treasury upon £75 a year, or to an ensign who is going\r\n    out to India.\r\n\r\n    If, with the above careful training, your daughter is not finished,\r\n    you may be sure it is no fault of yours, and you must look upon her\r\n    escape as nothing short of a miracle.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: George Alexander Lee (1802-51), son of a London publican\r\nand pugilist, \"tiger\" to Lord Barrymore, and subsequently tenor singer,\r\nmusic seller, lessee of Drury Lane, composer and music director at the\r\nStrand and Olympic Theatres. Among his many songs and ballads, popular\r\nin their day, were \"Away, Away to the Mountain's Brow,\" \"The Macgregor's\r\nGathering,\" and \"Come where the Aspens Quiver.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPORTING MAN (loquitur): \"I say, Charles, that's a\r\npromising little filly along o' that bay-haired woman who's talking to\r\nthe black-cob-looking man.\"]\r\n\r\nThe \"higher education\" of women was not discussed in these days of\r\nKeepsakes and Books of Beauty, though, as we have seen, the official\r\nrecognition of learned women and authoresses--Mrs. Somerville and Maria\r\nEdgeworth--was supported by _Punch_. In his \"Letters to a Young Man\r\nabout Town,\" Thackeray frequently insists on the refining influence of\r\ngood women in Society, but intellectual ladies met with little\r\nencouragement from his pen or pencil; he liked to see women at dinners,\r\nregretted their early departure, and suggested that the custom of the\r\ngentlemen remaining behind might be modified if not abolished; \"the only\r\nsubstitute for them or consolation for the want of them is smoking.\"\r\n\r\n_Punch_ castigates the caprice of flirts, while admitting their\r\nfascination. He ridicules the imaginary ailments of fashionable women\r\nexhausted by gaiety; but he waxes bitterly indignant over \"the Old\r\nBailey ladies\" who obtained access to the chapel at Newgate to listen to\r\nthe \"condemned sermon\" in the presence of a convicted murderer, or\r\nscrambled for seats at the trials of notorious malefactors. The only\r\nexcuse for this odious curiosity was that their menfolk set the women\r\nthe worst possible example. Executions were public, and were freely\r\npatronized by the nobility and gentry. The most powerful of the\r\n_Ingoldsby Legends_ deals with this ugly phase of early Victorian\r\nmanners, and can be verified from the pages of _Punch_, who tells us\r\nhow, on the occasion of an execution in June, 1842:--\r\n\r\n    All the houses opposite to the prison (Old Bailey) had been let to\r\n    sight-seeking lovers at an enormous price, and, in several\r\n    instances, the whole of the casements were taken out and raised\r\n    seats erected for their accommodation. In one case a noble lord was\r\n    pointed out to the reporter as having been a spectator at the last\r\n    four or five executions: his price for his seat was said to be\r\n    fifteen pounds.\r\n\r\nThe \"Model Fast Lady\" liked champagne, but the charge of indulgence in\r\nthe pleasures of the table is never brought against women of fashion.\r\nTheir extravagance in dress is often rebuked; but lovely woman, if left\r\nto herself, in the 'forties and 'fifties, was probably content to\r\nsubsist (as according to R. L. Stevenson she subsisted forty or fifty\r\nyears later) mainly on tea and cake. Women were not exempt from the\r\naccusation of snobbery: sarcastic comment is prompted by the letter of a\r\ncorrespondent to the _Morning Post_, who wrote to describe how, as the\r\nresult of a railway accident, she, \"a young lady of some birth, was\r\nplaced in a cornfield and had to wait six hours.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Verrey and Gunter_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Manners and Cvstoms of ye Englyshe\r\n\r\nA FASHIONABLE CLUB--FOUR O'CLOCK P.M.]\r\n\r\nThe brunt, however, of the social satire was borne by the men. Gluttony\r\nwas ever a male vice, and _Punch_ is constantly running a tilt against\r\ncivic gourmands and turtle-guzzling aldermen. But his censure was not\r\nconfined to the gross orgies of the City Fathers at a time when cholera\r\nand typhus were rampant. \"Everybody lives as if he had three or four\r\nthousand a year,\" is his dictum, which he follows up by pleading for\r\nmore simple and frequent dinners, the entertainment of poor friends and\r\nrelations--more hospitality and less show. The \"nobility and gentry\" did\r\nnot, however, court publicity in their entertainments as in a later\r\nage.[19] They dined sumptuously in their own houses; there were few\r\nexpensive restaurants in those days or for many years to come. The\r\nnearest approach was Verrey's Café, which was then a fashionable resort,\r\nand the immortal Gunter, who \"to parties gave up what was meant for\r\nmankind.\" \"Society\" was small, unmixed, and exclusive. Neither love nor\r\nmoney could secure the \"Spangle-Lacquers\" (under which title _Punch_\r\nsatirizes the pretensions of the New Rich), the _entrée_ to Almack's.\r\nFor club life a mine of useful information is to be found in Thackeray's\r\n\"Letters to a Young Man about Town\" and in the social cartoons of\r\nRichard Doyle. The account of a club cardroom and the absorption and\r\nobsession of the players needs little revision to fit the manners of\r\nto-day, and there is much excellent advice to young men to avoid\r\nroystering and drinking with \"Old Silenus,\" the midnight monarch of the\r\nsmoking-room at the Polyanthus. From Thackeray's contributions we have\r\nborrowed sparingly, but cannot refrain from quoting the passage in which\r\nhe pays noble homage to the genius of Dickens:--\r\n\r\n    What a calm and pleasant seclusion the library presents after the\r\n    brawl and bustle of the newspaper-room! There is never anybody\r\n    here. English gentlemen get up such a prodigious quantity of\r\n    knowledge in their early life that they leave off reading soon\r\n    after they begin to shave, or never look at anything but a\r\n    newspaper. How pleasant this room is--isn't it? with its sober\r\n    draperies, and long calm lines of peaceful volumes--nothing to\r\n    interrupt the quiet--only the melody of Horner's nose as he lies\r\n    asleep upon one of the sofas. What is he reading? Hah, _Pendennis_,\r\n    No. VII.--hum, let us pass on. Have you read _David Copperfield_,\r\n    by the way? How beautiful it is--how charmingly fresh and simple!\r\n    In those admirable touches of tender humour--and I should call\r\n    humour, Bob, a mixture of love and wit--who can equal this great\r\n    genius? There are little words and phrases in his books which are\r\n    like personal benefits to the reader. What a place it is to hold in\r\n    the affections of men! What an awful responsibility hanging over a\r\n    writer! What man, holding such a place, and knowing that his words\r\n    go forth to vast congregations of mankind--to grown folks, to their\r\n    children, and perhaps to their children's children--but must think\r\n    of his calling with a solemn and humble heart? May love and truth\r\n    guide such a man always! It is an awful prayer; may Heaven further\r\n    its fulfilment! And then, Bob, let the _Record_ revile him--See,\r\n    here's Horner waking up--How do you do, Horner?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: _Who's Who_ first appeared in 1849. In those days it was\r\nlittle more than a bare list of dignitaries and officials. It was not\r\nuntil 1897 that the personal note was sounded and details added which\r\nhave swelled the slim volume to its present portentous bulk.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Tobacco Tabooed_]\r\n\r\nSmoking was not yet a national habit. It was the height of bad form to\r\nbe seen smoking in the street. Even in clubs it was frowned upon, and\r\nThackeray, in his \"Snob Papers,\" writes in ironic vein respecting \"that\r\nden of abomination which, I am told, has been established in _some_\r\nclubs, called the Smoking Room.\" The embargo on pipes was not removed\r\nfor many years. A well-known judge removed his name from a well-known\r\nclub about the year 1890 because the committee refused to tolerate\r\npipe-smoking on their precincts. _Punch_ early ranged himself on the\r\nside of liberty, and in 1856 was greatly incensed against the British\r\nAnti-Tobacco Society, as against all \"Anti's,\" \"who, not content with\r\nhating balls, plays, and other amusements themselves, want to enforce\r\ntheir small antipathies on the rest of us.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GROUP IN THEATRE BOX]\r\n\r\nThe relaxations of men of fashion, if less multitudinous than to-day,\r\nwere at least tolerably varied. The golden age of the dandies had\r\npassed, but the breed was still not quite extinct in 1849; witness\r\nThackeray's picture of Lord Hugo Fitzurse. \"Fops' Alley,\" at the Opera,\r\nwas one of their favourite resorts; and its attractions are summed up,\r\nduring the season of 1844, in the last stanza of a \"Song of the\r\nSuperior Classes\":--\r\n\r\n    Blest ballet, soul-entrancing,\r\n      Who would not rather gaze\r\n    On youth and beauty dancing\r\n      Than one of Shakespeare's plays?\r\n    Give me the haunt of Fashion,\r\n      And let the Drama's shrine\r\n    Engross the vulgar's passion;\r\n      Fops' Alley, thou art mine.\r\n\r\nRobuster natures found distraction in knocker-wrenching and organizing\r\nparties to witness executions, but it would be as unfair to judge the\r\nmanners of the high life of the time from the exploits of the mad\r\nMarquess of Waterford as it would be to base one's estimate on the\r\nachievements of Lord Shaftesbury. Thackeray, in _The Newcomes_, written\r\nin 1853, gives a somewhat lurid account of the entertainment at the\r\n\"Coal Hole,\" from which the indignant colonel abruptly withdrew with his\r\nson Clive. The moral atmosphere of \"Cyder Cellars\" and similar places of\r\nentertainment was not exactly rarefied, but _Punch_ makes a notable\r\nexception in favour of Evans's Supper Rooms, which were reopened after\r\nredecoration in the year 1856 as the abode of supper and song. There was\r\nno price for admission. You entered by a descent from the western end of\r\nthe Piazza, Covent Garden, and took your choice from the little marble\r\ntables near the door or nearer the raised platform. _Punch's_ only\r\nadverse criticism is directed against the epileptic gesticulations of\r\nthe Ethiopian serenaders. For the rest he has nothing but praise for the\r\nentertainment, whether for mind or body:--\r\n\r\n    Anybody wanting to hear a little good music, sup, and get to bed\r\n    betimes will be precisely suited at this place. Singing commences\r\n    at eight. Any country curate, now, or indeed, rector, being in town\r\n    under those circumstances, would find it just answer his purpose.\r\n    To a serious young man, disapproving of the Opera, and tired of\r\n    Exeter Hall, it would be a pleasant change from the last-named\r\n    institution. Moreover it has the advantage of cheapness--so\r\n    important to all who are truly serious. Even a bishop might give\r\n    it an occasional inspection, without derogation from the decorum of\r\n    his shovel hat and gaiters. A resort whereat unobjectionable\r\n    amusement is provided for the youthful bachelor--the student of\r\n    law--of medicine--nay, of divinity--offers an attraction in the\r\n    right direction which is powerful to counteract a tendency towards\r\n    the wrong: and a glass of grog, with the accompaniment of good\r\n    singing, may have a moral value superior to that of a teetotal\r\n    harangue and a cup of Twankay.[20]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: \"Twankay,\" constantly used at this time as an equivalent\r\nfor tea, after the name of the district of Taung Kei in China.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Travellers and Outlaws_]\r\n\r\nThe cult of pastime was as yet in its infancy; years were to elapse\r\nbefore even croquet was to assert its gentle sway. But there was always\r\nthe great game of politics and patronage, and though Crockford, the\r\nfounder of the famous gambling club at 50, St. James's Street, retired\r\nin 1840, after he had won \"the whole of the ready money of the existing\r\ngeneration,\" in Captain Gronow's phrase, there was plenty of gambling\r\nfor very high stakes. There was also travel, limited in its larger and\r\nmore leisurely range to people of fortune, but already beginning to\r\nappeal through excursions to the middle classes. \"Paris in twelve hours\"\r\nwas advertised by the South Eastern Railway in 1849, though according to\r\n_Punch_ it really took twenty-nine hours; but before long the time\r\noccupied in the transit was reduced to nine hours. Boulogne had long\r\nbeen the resort of a curious colony of Englishmen \"composed of those who\r\nare living on their means, and those who are living in despite of them,\r\nincluding, to give a romantic air of society, a slight sprinkling of\r\noutlaws.\" It was at Boulogne-sur-Mer that Brummell ended his days in\r\npoverty; but the most famous outlaws of the period under review were\r\n\"the most gorgeous\" Countess of Blessington and Count D'Orsay, who fled\r\nprecipitately from Gore House in April, 1849, to Paris. Nine years\r\nearlier Lady Blessington had been one of the most courted leaders of\r\nfashionable society. She had beauty, fascination, a fair measure of\r\nliterary talent, and an industry only surpassed by her extravagance. Of\r\nD'Orsay, whom Byron called the _Cupidon déchaîné_, handsome, gifted and\r\npopular, athlete, wit and dandy, it is enough to say that he was the\r\nonly artist congenial to the Duke of Wellington, who used to call\r\nsculptors \"damned busters\" and so exasperated Goya by his cavalier\r\ntreatment that the old Spanish painter is alleged to have challenged him\r\nto a duel! Lady Blessington and D'Orsay escaped censure from _Punch_\r\neven in his democratic days. It was hard to be angry with these birds of\r\nParadise, gorgeous in their lives, almost tragic in their eclipse. They\r\nat any rate did not come under the condemnation meted out to Cockney\r\ntravellers on the Continent in 1845:--\r\n\r\n    SMALL CHANGE FOR PERSONS GOING ON THE CONTINENT\r\n\r\n    Laugh at everything you do not understand, and never fail to\r\n    ridicule anything that appears strange to you. The habits of the\r\n    lower class will afford you abundant entertainment, if you have the\r\n    proper talent to mimic them. Their religious ceremonies you will\r\n    also find to be an endless source of amusement.\r\n\r\n    Recollect very few people talk in English on the Continent, so you\r\n    may be perfectly at your ease in abusing foreigners before their\r\n    faces, and talking any modest nonsense you like, in the presence of\r\n    ladies, at a _table d'hôte_. Do not care what you say about the\r\n    government of any particular state you may be visiting, and show\r\n    your national spirit by boasting, on every possible occasion, of\r\n    the superiority of England and everything English.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OPERA\r\n\r\nDOORKEEPER: \"Beg your pardon, Sir--but must, indeed, Sir, be in full\r\ndress.\"\r\n\r\nSNOB (excited): \"Full dress!! Why, what do you call this?\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The \"Gent\" Abroad and at Home_]\r\n\r\nThe criticism, if caustic, was not without provocation, and unhappily\r\nthe provocation did not cease, indeed, it may not be a rash assertion to\r\nobserve that it has not yet altogether ceased. The type reappeared as\r\n\"'Arry.\" In the early 'forties he was one of _Punch's_ pet aversions\r\nunder the title of \"the Gent\":--\r\n\r\n    Of all the loungers who cross our way in the public thoroughfares,\r\n    the _Gent_ is the most unbearable, principally from an assumption\r\n    of style about him--a futile aping of superiority that inspires us\r\n    with feelings of mingled contempt and amusement, when we\r\n    contemplate his ridiculous pretensions to be considered \"the\r\n    thing.\"\r\n\r\n    No city in the world produces so many holiday specimens of tawdry\r\n    vulgarity as London; and the river appears to be the point towards\r\n    which all the countless myriads converge. Their strenuous attempts\r\n    to ape _gentility_--a bad style of word, we admit, but one\r\n    peculiarly adapted to our purpose--are to us more painful than\r\n    ludicrous; and the labouring man, dressed in the usual costume of\r\n    his class, is in our eyes far more respectable than the Gent, in\r\n    his dreary efforts to assume a style and _tournure_ which he is so\r\n    utterly incapable of carrying out.\r\n\r\n_Punch_ was a sincere lover of his country and her Constitution. When\r\nforeigners criticized England or the English he was up in arms in a\r\nmoment. John Bull, he declared, _à propos_ of the suspicion of the\r\nFrench Government, was the best natured, most kindly, and tolerant\r\nfellow in the world. But this conviction never stood in the way of his\r\nplaying the candid friend to and dealing faithfully with his countrymen\r\non all possible occasions. As a comprehensive indictment of their\r\nfailings it would be hard to beat or to improve upon the following list\r\nof the things an Englishman likes:--\r\n\r\n    An Englishman likes a variety of things. For instance, nothing is\r\n    more to his liking than: To talk largely about Art, and to have\r\n    the worst statues and monuments that ever disgraced a metropolis!\r\n\r\n    To inveigh against the grinding tyrannies practised upon poor\r\n    needlewomen and slop-tailors, and yet to patronize the shops where\r\n    cheap shirts and clothes are sold!\r\n\r\n    To purchase a bargain, no matter whether he is in want of it or\r\n    not!\r\n\r\n    To reward native talent, with which view he supports Italian\r\n    operas, French plays, German singers, and in fact gives gold to the\r\n    foreigners in exchange for the brass they bring him!\r\n\r\n    To talk sneeringly against tuft-hunting and all tuft-hunters, and\r\n    yet next to running after a lord, nothing delights him more than to\r\n    be seen in company with one!\r\n\r\n    To rave about his public spirit and independence, and with the\r\n    greatest submission to endure perpetually a tax[21] that was only\r\n    put on for three years!\r\n\r\n    To brag about his politeness and courteous demeanour in public, and\r\n    to scamper after the Queen whenever there is an opportunity of\r\n    staring at her!\r\n\r\n    To boast of his cleanliness, and to leave uncovered (as in the\r\n    Thames) the biggest sewer in the world!\r\n\r\n    To pretend to like music, and to tolerate the Italian organs and\r\n    the discordant musicians that infest his streets!\r\n\r\n    To inveigh against bad legislation, and to refrain in many\r\n    instances from exercising the franchise he pays so dearly for!\r\n\r\n    To admit the utility of education, and yet to exclude from its\r\n    benefits every one who is not of the same creed as himself!\r\n\r\n    And lastly, an Englishman dearly likes:\r\n\r\n    To grumble, no matter whether he is right or wrong, crying or\r\n    laughing, working or playing, gaining a victory or smarting under a\r\n    national humiliation, paying or being paid--still he must grumble,\r\n    and in fact he is never so happy as when he is grumbling; and,\r\n    supposing everything was to his satisfaction (though it says a\r\n    great deal for our power of assumption to assume any such absurd\r\n    impossibilities), still he would grumble at the fact of there being\r\n    nothing for him to grumble about!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: The income tax. _Punch_ knew better, and prophesied from\r\nthe very outset that it would never come off.]\r\n\r\n_Punch_ certainly exercised the national privilege of grumbling to the\r\nfull, though the shafts of his satire were sometimes of the nature of\r\nboomerangs. We can sympathize with him when, in his list of \"things and\r\npersons that should emigrate,\" he includes \"all persons who give\r\nimitations of actors; all quack doctors and advertising professors; all\r\nyoung men who smoke before the age of fifteen, and young ladies who wear\r\nringlets after the age of thirty,\" as fit for \"dumping.\" But he runs the\r\nrisk of the _Quis tulerit Gracchos_ retort when he bans \"all punsters\r\nand conundrum makers.\" In the main he was a strenuous supporter of\r\neducation, especially elementary education, and the recognition and\r\nreward of men of science and letters, but, along with his general\r\nsupport of literary and scientific institutions, he seldom missed a\r\nchance of making game of learned societies, beginning with the British\r\nAssociation. The ignorance of candidates for appointments in the Civil\r\nService does not escape his reforming zeal, when in 1857 no fewer than\r\n44 per cent. were rejected for bad spelling; yet in 1852 we find him\r\npublishing a picture of a Japanese as a black man.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Desirable Emigrants_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OFFENDED DIGNITY\r\n\r\nSMALL SWELL (who has just finished a quadrille): \"H'm, thank goodness\r\nthat's over.

From the very first _Punch's_ attitude was\r\nhostile, sceptical, even derisive; and he was one of the first to\r\ncondemn the harrying of humble fortune-tellers while fashionable and\r\nexpensive exponents of clairvoyance were immune from prosecution.\r\nCrystal-gazing is mentioned in 1851. Playing upon words, in the\r\n_Almanack_ for 1852 we read: \"It is related as astonishing that there\r\nare some clairvoyants who can see right through anybody; but that is not\r\nso very strange. The wonder is that there should be anybody who cannot\r\nsee through the clairvoyant.\" In 1853 it was seriously suggested by a\r\nmesmerist in the _Morning Post_ that he could get into communication\r\nwith Sir John Franklin; this _Punch_ promptly pilloried, as, too, a\r\nlittle later, he did a reference to a play alleged to have been dictated\r\nby Shakespeare's spirit. In 1857 _Punch_ solemnly vouches for the\r\nauthenticity of the following advertisement under the heading \"Spirits\r\nby retail\":--\r\n\r\n    COMMUNICATIONS with the SPIRIT OF WASHINGTON for Oracular\r\n    Revelation of public fact and duty; responses tendered relative to\r\n    Executive or Governmental, State or Diplomatic, National or\r\n    Personal questions on affairs of moment for their more ready and\r\n    appropriate solution, and the special use of official,\r\n    Congressional and editorial intelligence. Address \"Washington\r\n    Medium,\" Post Office, Box 628, Washington, D.C. No letter (except\r\n    for an interview) will be answered unless it encloses one dollar,\r\n    and only the first five questions of any letter with but one dollar\r\n    will have a reply. Number your questions and preserve copies of\r\n    them.\r\n\r\nSober and instructed opinion has always shown this distrust, but _Punch_\r\nwas not always justified in his treatment of new arts and discoveries.\r\nHe quite failed to recognize the importance and the possibilities of\r\nphotography, the early references to which are uniformly disparaging.\r\nThere was at least this excuse for his want of foresight, that for many\r\nyears the professional photographer was destitute of any artistic\r\nfeeling or training save in the purely mechanical side of his calling.\r\nIn representing him as combining photography with hairdressing or other\r\neven more menial trades, _Punch_ was not indulging in exaggeration. The\r\nmere name \"photographer\" called up the image of a seedy, weedy little\r\nman who suggested an unsuccessful artist by his dress and whose \"studio\"\r\nwas a shabby chamber of theatrical horrors, in which the subject was\r\nclamped and screwed into rigidity by instruments of torture. In the\r\n'fifties photography was already exploited as a means of advertising\r\nactors, actresses and even popular preachers, but it had not begun to\r\nbe thought of as a means of social _réclame_. Apart from politicians and\r\npublic characters little limelight was shed on personality. The\r\nrelations between the Stage and Society were curiously different from\r\nthose which prevail to-day. _Punch_ was a great champion of the\r\nlegitimate drama. Douglas Jerrold had been a prolific and successful,\r\nthough not prosperous, playwright, and other members of the staff had\r\nwritten for the stage. The disregard of serious native talent by the\r\nCourt[22] and the fashionable world was a constant theme of bitter\r\ncomment. But _Punch_ shows no eagerness for the bestowal of official\r\nrecognition on actors; when the question of knighthoods was mooted, he\r\nexpressed apprehension lest they should be conferred upon the\r\nupholsterers rather than the upholders of the Drama. With that form of\r\nmummer-worship which took the form of the publication of personal gossip\r\nabout actors he had no sympathy, and even satirized it in a burlesque\r\naccount of the daily life of an imaginary low comedian. On occasions\r\nwhen actors resented the tone of dramatic criticism, as in the quarrel\r\nbetween Charles Mathews and the _Morning Chronicle_, _Punch_ stood for\r\nthe liberty of the Press. Against sensationalism, horrors, plays based\r\non crime, and the cult of monstrosity _Punch_ waged unceasing war, but\r\nhe was no prude. Those who were always on the look out for offence were\r\nsure to find it: \"certain it is that whenever a father of a family\r\nvisits a theatre, something verging on impropriety takes place.\" So\r\nagain he falls foul of the inconsistent prudery which allowed a\r\nperformance of _La Dame aux Camélias_ at Exeter Hall in 1857, but\r\nprohibited an English translation of the words.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: \"As well hope to touch, Memnon-like, the statue of Queen\r\nAnne into mourning music, as to awaken generous impulses in the House of\r\nHanover towards art, or science or letters.\" The payment of 13s. 4d.\r\neach to actors at a Royal Command performance provokes a sarcastic\r\nreference to the Court Almoner Extraordinary.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _\"Punch's\" Respect for Decorum_]\r\n\r\nMany of the broader aspects of early Victorian social life remain with\r\nus to-day, though modified or amended. \"The broad vein of plush that\r\ntraverses the whole framework of English society,\" as _Punch_\r\nflamboyantly gibed, if not wholly obliterated is at least less\r\nconspicuous. Jeames and Jenkins are dead. If we cannot say the same of\r\nbullying at schools, \"ragging\" in the Army, the unnecessary expense of\r\nuniforms and the costly pageantry of funerals--all of which were\r\nstrenuously condemned by _Punch_--it may at least be contended that\r\npublic opinion is more vigilant in arraigning and bringing to light\r\noffences against humanity, good taste and common sense. Modern critics\r\nhave not been wanting who charge _Punch_ with prudery and squeamishness,\r\nbut this is not the place to discuss whether the popularity of the paper\r\nwould have been enhanced, or its influence and power fortified by\r\nfollowing the example of _La Vie Parisienne_ or of _Jugend_. Certainly\r\nduring the period under review reticence and respectability were\r\ncombined on occasion with a remarkable freedom of comment, and the\r\ntragedy of \"The Great Social Evil\" was frankly admitted in Leech's\r\nfamous picture. Though an isolated reference it was worth a hundred\r\nsermons. If _Punch_ preferred to be the champion of domesticity and\r\ndecorum in public and private life, he was reflecting an essential\r\nfeature of the age--a feature which no longer exists. It was an age of\r\npatriarchal rule and large families. Nothing strikes one more in\r\nturning over the pages of old numbers of _Punch_ than the swarms of\r\nyoung people who figure in the domestic groups so dear to John Leech.\r\nThe numbers, more than the precocity of the rising generation, impress\r\nthe reader. The type represented is mainly drawn from well-to-do\r\nmiddle-class households, but all classes were prolific. If one needs\r\nproof, there is the evidence of Debrett and of the tombstones in our\r\ncountry churchyards.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Mr. Quiverfull_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Scene: A Public-house, Bury St. Edmunds, after the Dinner\r\ngiven by the Mayor of Bury to the Lord Mayor of London.\r\n\r\nCOUNTRY FOOTMAN: \"Pray, Sir, what do you think of our town?

A sketch not a hundred miles from the Haymarket.\r\n\r\nBELLA: \"Ah! Fanny! How long have you been _Gay_?\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FRESHENER ON THE DOWNS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIBERAL PROFESSIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a mirror of public opinion on the status and importance of the\r\nlearned and liberal professions _Punch_, when due allowance has been\r\nmade for his limitations, his prejudices and even his passions, cannot\r\nbe overlooked by the student of social history. A whole book has been\r\nwritten on his attitude towards the Church; in another section of this\r\nchronicle I have dealt at some length with his hostility to Pluralism,\r\nSabbatarianism, Ritualism, and endeavoured to show how a generally\r\ntolerant and \"hang theology\" attitude was in the early 'fifties\r\nexchanged for one of fierce anti-Vaticanism. The \"No Popery\" drum was\r\nbanged with great fury, and when the Roman Catholic hierarchy was\r\nre-established in England in 1850, _Punch_ supported the Ecclesiastical\r\nTitles Act which declared the assumption of titles connected with places\r\nin the realm illegal and imposed heavy penalties on the persons assuming\r\nthem. This Act, passed in 1851, remained a dead letter until 1871, when\r\nit was repealed. As for the law and lawyers the record of _Punch_ is\r\nmore consistent and creditable, and, as we have seen, he was from the\r\nfirst an unflinching advocate of cheap justice and the removal of\r\nirregularities which pressed hardest on the poor, an unrelenting critic\r\nof barbarous and oppressive penalties. No one was too great or small to\r\nescape his legal pillory, or to secure recognition for reforming zeal or\r\nhumane administration--from Lord Brougham and Lord St. Leonards down to\r\nunpaid magistrates. To what has been said elsewhere it may be added that\r\nthe series of papers written by Gilbert à Beckett, under the heading of\r\n\"The Comic Blackstone,\" are much better than their title, for they\r\ncontain a good deal of shrewd satire and sound sense. _Punch_ had good\r\nreason to be proud of his own legal representative, the humane and\r\ngenial Gilbert à Beckett. He welcomed Talfourd's promotion to the Bench\r\nas an honour to letters, for Talfourd was not only the executor and\r\nfirst biographer of Lamb and the author of the highly successful, but\r\nnow forgotten, tragedy of _Ion_, but his services to authors in\r\nconnexion with copyright earned for him the dedication of _Pickwick_. On\r\nhis death in 1854, _Punch's_ elegy fittingly commemorated the character\r\nand career of one of whom, as an advocate, it was said that the wrong\r\nside seldom cared to hear him, and who, like Hood, in his last words,\r\ndeplored the mutual estrangement of classes in English society.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Bench and the Universities_]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, judges who jested on the Bench, indulged in judicial\r\nclap-trap, or encouraged the public to regard the Courts of Justice as\r\nsubstitutes for theatrical entertainments, are severely handled. _Judex\r\njocosus odiosus_; but the type is, apparently, impervious to satire.\r\nAnother anticipation of latter-day criticism is to be found in the\r\nremark made in 1856: \"There was once a Parliament--(we do not live in\r\nsuch times now!)--in which there were few or no lawyers.\" Even more\r\nred-hot in its up-to-dateness is _Punch's_ sarcastic dismissal of the\r\ncult of \"efficiency\" sixty-five years ago:--\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Punch's_ reverence for the business powers of so-called men of\r\n    business is not abject. The \"practical men,\" who smile\r\n    compassionately at schemers and visionaries, are the men who\r\n    perpetually make the most frightful smashes and blunders. No\r\n    attorney, for instance, can keep, or comprehend accounts, and a\r\n    stock-jobber, the supposed incarnation of shrewdness, is the most\r\n    credulous _gobemouche_ in London.\r\n\r\nWith University authorities, professors, dons, and academics generally,\r\nwe look in vain for any sign of sympathy, save that _Punch_ condemned\r\nthe rule which then prevented Fellows from marrying. For the rest, he\r\nlooked on the older Universities as the homes of mediæval obscurantism,\r\nstubbornly opposed to reforms long overdue. Of the two, Oxford fared the\r\nworse at his hands on account of the Tractarian movement, Pusey, and\r\nNewman. This antagonism was based on political and religious\r\ndivergences, not on any hostility to learning or the classical\r\ncurriculum, of which _Punch_ was a supporter, to the extent of printing\r\n_jeux d'esprit_ in Latin and Greek in his pages. All along he was a\r\njealous guardian of the \"illustrious order of the goose-quill,\" a sturdy\r\nchampion of its claims to adequate pay and official recognition, a\r\nvigilant critic of the \"homoeopathic system of rewards\" adopted by the\r\nCrown in the Civil List. References to this undying scandal are\r\nhonourably frequent in the early volumes of _Punch_. It may suffice to\r\nquote the letter to Lord Palmerston in the summer of 1856:--\r\n\r\n    I will not, this hot weather, weary your lordship by specifying\r\n    every case, but will sum up the account as I find it divided:\r\n\r\n    To Science, Literature, and Art             £275\r\n    To sundries                                  925\r\n                                              ------\r\n                                              £1,200\r\n    Deduct sundries                              925\r\n                                              ------\r\n                                                £275\r\n    Due to Science, Literature, and Art          925\r\n                                              ------\r\n                  Total Civil List            £1,200\r\n\r\nEqually creditable is the reiterated plea--from 1847 onward--for the\r\nestablishment of International Copyright, to guard English authors from\r\nthe piracy of American publishers, amongst whom Putnam is singled out as\r\nan honourable exception. It may be fairly claimed for _Punch_ that he\r\nmade very few mistakes in appraising the merits of the authors of his\r\ntime or of the rising stars. He failed to render justice to Disraeli as\r\na writer, and he curtly dismissed Walt Whitman's _Leaves of Grass_ as \"a\r\nmad book by an American rough.\" But literary values prove him\r\nsubstantially right in his distaste for the flamboyant exuberance of\r\nBulwer Lytton, and absolutely sound in his castigation of the\r\ntripe-and-oniony flavour of Samuel Warren's books, one of which he held\r\nup to not undeserved obloquy under the ferocious misnomer of \"The\r\nDiarrhoea of a Late Physician.\" He was a veritable _malleus stultorum_\r\nin dealing alike with the futilities of incompetent aristocrats and the\r\nhomely puerilities of Martin Tupper and Poet Close. The famous campaign\r\nagainst the poet Bunn and his bad librettos goaded the victim into\r\nreprisals in which he gave as good as he got, but the fact remains that\r\nBunn _was_ a bad poet, though _Punch_ quite overdid his persecution. The\r\nnobility of Wordsworth, though the least humorous of poets, was\r\nhandsomely acknowledged; when the erection of a statue to Peel was\r\nmooted, _Punch_ put in a claim for a similar honour to the sage of\r\nRydal. And though indignant with Carlyle for his defence of slavery,\r\n_Punch_ was still ready to acknowledge \"the monarch in his masquerade.\"\r\nLastly, he not only welcomed Tennyson as a master, but threw open his\r\ncolumns to him to retort on his detractors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _\"Punch\" and \"The Times\"_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JENKINS AT HOME]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Victorian and Georgian Journalism_]\r\n\r\nDog does not eat dog, but the unwritten etiquette in accordance with\r\nwhich one newspaper does not directly attack another was much less\r\nstrictly observed sixty or seventy years ago. Delane, the editor of _The\r\nTimes_, exercised a greater political influence than any other\r\njournalist before or since, and for a good many years _Punch_ acted as a\r\nsort of free-lance ally of the great daily,[23] drawing liberally from\r\nits columns in the way of extracts and illustrations, and, according to\r\nhis habitual practice, underlining its policy while pretending to be\r\nshocked at it. Several of the men on _Punch_ were contributors to _The\r\nTimes_. Gilbert à Beckett's name stands first in the list of the\r\nprincipal contributors and members of the staff of _The Times_ under\r\nDelane given in Mr. Dasent's biography. Yet I have searched the pages of\r\nthe biography and the index in vain for a single reference to _Punch_.\r\nNone the less the relations of the two papers were close and cordial,\r\nand \"Billy\" Russell, the _Times_ war correspondent and unsparing critic\r\nof mismanagement in the Crimea, had no more enthusiastic trumpeter than\r\n_Punch_. But the great gulf in prestige and power between _The Times_\r\nunder Delane and the rest of the London Press is indirectly but\r\nunmistakably shown in _Punch's_ habitual disrespect for most of his\r\nother contemporaries. In another context, I have quoted examples of his\r\nflagellation of the _Morning Post_--the only paper, by the way, which\r\nsupported the _Coup d'État_; but two masterpieces of malice may be\r\nadded. In 1843, _à propos_ of \"Jenkins's\" incurably unctuous worship of\r\nrank, _Punch_ observes: \"If the reader be not weeping at this, it is not\r\nin the power of onions to move him.\" And again, a little later on in the\r\nsame year, _Punch_ compares the \"beastliness\" of Jenkins, \"the life-long\r\ntoad-eater,\" with the \"beastly fellow\" denounced in the _Morning Post_\r\nfor swallowing twelve frogs for a wager! _Punch_ was not content with\r\nidentifying the _Morning Post_ with the imaginary personality of\r\nJenkins, the super-flunkey, but was also responsible for re-christening\r\nthe _Morning Herald_ and the _Standard_--Conservative morning and\r\nevening papers which, until 1857, belonged to the same proprietor--Mrs.\r\nGamp and Mrs. Harris. The _Standard_ retaliated by calling _Punch_ the\r\n\"most abject of all the toadies of _The Times_,\" and accusing it of\r\nlibelling \"the young gentlemen of Eton\" and the Queen. By an unconscious\r\ncompliment _Punch_ was bracketed with the _Examiner_, the ablest and\r\nmost independent of the weeklies, as _The Times_ was of the dailies, for\r\nits disloyalty to the Crown. In the war of wits which ensued and was\r\ncarried on for several years, all the honours rested with _Punch_. But\r\nthese controversies belong rather to the domestic history of _Punch_;\r\nand _Punch's_ friendly relations with the _Daily News_, of which Dickens\r\nwas the first editor, must be somewhat discounted by the facts that\r\nDouglas Jerrold was an intimate friend of the novelist, who occasionally\r\ndined with the _Punch_ staff; that Paxton, one of _Punch's_ heroes,\r\nexerted all his great influence on behalf of the new daily; and finally,\r\nthat Bradbury and Evans were, at the time, the publishers of Dickens, of\r\n_Punch_, and of the _Daily News_. The journalism of the 'forties and\r\n'fifties presents curious analogies with and divergences from the\r\njournalism of to-day. _Punch_ is never weary of girding at the cult of\r\nmonstrosity and sensationalism, the disproportionate amount of space\r\ndevoted to crime and criminals and _causes célèbres_, the habit of\r\nburning the idols of yesterday, the nauseating compliments paid to\r\nstatesmen after death by those who had maligned them in their lifetime.\r\nMany of the least reputable exploits of Georgian journalism were\r\nanticipated in early Victorian days. Criticism was franker, more\r\noutspoken, and less restrained by the law of libel, and _Punch_ always\r\nstood out within reasonable limits for the liberty of the Press. When an\r\nEdinburgh jury gave a verdict against the _Scotsman_ in the famous case\r\nbrought by Duncan MacLaren in 1852, _Punch_ compared them to Bomba, and\r\ncongratulated the Scottish gentlemen who defrayed the _Scotsman's_ costs\r\nand damages. He regarded it as a righteous protest against a verdict\r\nwhich threatened \"to make it impossible to express contempt at\r\npolitical apostasy, disgust at the abandonment of principles, or\r\nindignation at any coalition, however disreputable, without the danger\r\nof being brought before a jury.\" The _Scotsman_ was then edited by\r\nAlexander Russel, the most powerful, original, and enlightened of Scots\r\njournalists. Russel, for the last twenty years of his life, dominated\r\nthe _Scotsman_ as Delane dominated _The Times_. But it was, in the main,\r\na righteous and benevolent dictatorship. \"What made every one turn with\r\nalert curiosity to _The Times_ in Delane's day was that nobody knew\r\nbeforehand which side he would take on any new question.\" [24] And much\r\nthe same might be said of Russel. No such curiosity is possible to-day.\r\nThere has been a great levelling up of journalism from the bottom, and a\r\ngreat levelling down from the top. In the old days the gap between men\r\nlike Delane and Russel and the penny-a-liners was greater than any gap\r\nthat now exists in the profession. Not the least of their distinctions\r\nwas the fact that they both died without even a knighthood to their\r\nnames. Fifty years later neither of them could have held his post for a\r\nfortnight. It is to the credit of _Punch_ that he recognized the value\r\nof their independence and emulated it in his own sphere. He played his\r\npart manfully in helping to kill the old flunkey-worship of rank, but\r\ncould not prevent the reincarnation of \"Jenkins\" in the modern\r\nsycophantic worshipper of success--no matter how achieved. The\r\nexcellence of provincial journalism--not yet exposed to the competition\r\nof the cheap London press--is attested by _Punch's_ frequent citations,\r\nbut he did not overlook its ineptitudes, some of which happily remain to\r\nrefresh our leisure.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: On the occasion of _Punch's_ Jubilee, in 1891, _The Times_\r\nremarked: \"May we be excused for noting the fact that he (_Punch_) has\r\ngenerally, in regard to public affairs, taken his cue from _The Times_?\"\r\nThat was substantially true of _The Times_ under the old _régime_ when\r\nDelane was editor. Mr. Herbert Paul, himself a strong Liberal, writes in\r\nhis _History of Modern England_ that \"Delane's chief quality was his\r\nindependence.\" Mr. Dasent, in his biography, gives good grounds for his\r\nassertion that Delane was at no time what could be called a party man,\r\nthough his instincts were essentially Liberal, and notes that \"if\r\ncharged with inconsistency, Delane would merely remind his critics that\r\n_The Times_ was the organ of no party, and that every issue was complete\r\nin itself.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: _Delane of \"The Times,\"_ by Sir Edward Cook, p. 281.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Quacks and Doctors_]\r\n\r\nBut of all the professions, none looms larger in the early pages of\r\n_Punch_ than that of medicine. Here, again, a broad distinction is drawn\r\nbetween the heads of the profession and those who are preparing for it;\r\nbetween legitimate and illegitimate practitioners. Men like Harvey and\r\nJenner are extolled as heroes and benefactors of humanity at large, and\r\ntheir recognition by the State is urged as a national duty. The\r\nmaintenance of the status and dignity of physicians and surgeons,\r\ncivil, naval, and military, is frequently insisted upon before and\r\nduring the Crimean War. _Punch's_ tribute to the services of Florence\r\nNightingale in reorganizing the nursing profession has already been\r\nnoted. He was a strenuous advocate of the disestablishment of Mrs. Gamp,\r\nand a consistent supporter of the campaign against quackery, though\r\nunder no illusions as to the possibility of its entire extermination:--\r\n\r\n    Great outcry has been raised of late, in the _Lancet_ and other\r\n    journals, against Quacks and Quackery. Let them not flatter\r\n    themselves that it is possible to put either down. The Quack is a\r\n    personage too essential to the comfort of a large class of society\r\n    to be deprived of his vocation. He is, in fact, the Physician of\r\n    the Fools--a body whose numbers and respectability are by far too\r\n    great to admit of anything of the kind. However, as there are some\r\n    people in the world who are not fools, and who will not, when they\r\n    want a doctor, have recourse to a Quack, if they can help it, the\r\n    practice of the latter ought certainly to be limited to its proper\r\n    sphere. For this end we could certainly go rather farther than Sir\r\n    James Graham's sympathies permitted him to proceed last session. We\r\n    propose that every Quack should not only not be suffered to call\r\n    himself what he is not, but should be compelled to call himself\r\n    what he is. We would not only prevent him from assuming the title\r\n    of a medical man, but we would oblige him to take that of Quack.\r\n\r\nThis was written in 1845. The Sir James Graham referred to was one of\r\nthe blackest of all _Punch's bêtes noires_--in consequence of the\r\npostal censorship which earned for him the title of \"The Breaker (not\r\nthe Keeper) of the Seals,\" and prompted the savage cartoon of \"Peel's\r\nDirty Little Boy.\" He never had friendly treatment at the hands of\r\n_Punch_. Elsewhere it is insinuated that the measure played the game of\r\nthe quacks, and the history of attempts to regulate their activities in\r\nthe last seventy years goes far to justify _Punch's_ scepticism. But his\r\ncensure was not confined to quacks; he says hard things of doctors who\r\nexploited and traded on _malades imaginaires_, and more than once\r\nexhibits impatience at the failure of medical science to arrive at any\r\ndefinite conclusions as to the causes or cure of the cholera epidemic in\r\n1849. And when Mr. Muntz brought forward a motion in 1845 to oblige\r\ndoctors to write their prescriptions in English and put English labels\r\non their gallipots, the proposal was satirized as an effort to strip\r\nmedicine of its indispensable mystery. It may be not unfairly contended\r\nthat _Punch_, in his horror of humbug and condemnation of guzzling and\r\ngormandizing, was a disciple of Abernethy. His views on diet inclined to\r\nmoderation rather than asceticism, and the new cult of vegetarianism,\r\nwhich seems to have had its origin in Manchester, was satirized under\r\nthe heading, \"Greens for the Green.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOMETHING LIKE A HOLIDAY\r\n\r\nPASTRYCOOK: \"What have you had, Sir?\"\r\n\r\nBOY: \"I've had two jellies, seven of these, eleven of these, and six of\r\nthose, and four Bath buns, a sausage roll, ten almond cakes--and a\r\nbottle of ginger beer.\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Medical Students_]\r\n\r\nBy far the largest number of the references to medicine, however, are\r\nconcerned with the manners and customs of medical students, and if\r\ncorroboration be needed for the unflattering picture of this class which\r\nhas been drawn in _Pickwick_, the pages of _Punch_ supply it in\r\ndistressing abundance. The counterparts of Bob Sawyer and Benjamin\r\nAllen, in all their dingy rowdiness are portrayed in a series of\r\narticles and paragraphs running through the early volumes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MEDICAL STUDENT]\r\n\r\nThus, under the heading Hospitals we read:--\r\n\r\n    The attributes of the gentlemen walking the various hospitals may\r\n    be thus enumerated:\r\n\r\n    Guy's             {Half-and-half, anatomical _fracas_,\r\n    St. Thomas's      {and billiards.\r\n    St. George's      Doings at Tattersall's.\r\n    London            Too remote to be ascertained.\r\n    University        Conjuring, juggling, and mesmerism.\r\n    Bartholomew's     State of Smithfield Markets.\r\n    Middlesex         Convivial harmony.\r\n    Charing Cross     Dancing at the Lowther-rooms.\r\n    King's College    Has not yet acquired any peculiarity.\r\n    Westminster       Dashes of all the others combined.\r\n\r\nEven when all allowance has been made for the exaggeration of the\r\nsatirist, there was undoubtedly a serious warrant for this indictment,\r\nand we may congratulate ourselves that it is a gross libel on the\r\nmedical students of to-day. They may be exuberant, noisy, and rowdy on\r\noccasion, but they are neither grubby nor callous, and the unfortunate\r\nepisode of their treatment of Mr. \"Pussyfoot\" Johnson may be regarded,\r\nwe believe, as a blot on the scutcheon of their sportsmanship which the\r\ngreat majority regretted and reprobated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOMEN IN THE 'FORTIES AND 'FIFTIES\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the position and influence of women in society _Punch_, as we have\r\nalready seen, furnishes a critical if not a complete commentary.\r\nExtravagance, exclusiveness and arrogance are faithfully dealt with.\r\nThere is genuine satire in the picture of the fine lady who, on hearing\r\nthat her pet dog had bitten the footman in the leg, expressed the\r\nfervent hope that it would not make the dog ill. Fashionable delicacy is\r\nridiculed, and _Punch_ ranged himself on the side of \"S.G.O.\" (Lord\r\nSidney Godolphin Osborne) in his crusade in _The Times_ against Mayfair\r\nmatrons for not nursing their own offspring, and for employing\r\nwet-nurses who, in turn, had to starve their own children. A few years\r\nearlier, when the question \"Can Women regenerate Society?\" was seriously\r\ndiscussed in the same journal, the issue is drowned by _Punch_ in a\r\nstream of comic suggestions. There is not much to choose between the\r\n\"Dolls' House\" ideal and that expressed in the sonnet printed in the\r\nwinter of 1846:--\r\n\r\n    I idolize the ladies. They are fairies\r\n    That spiritualize this earth of ours;\r\n    From heavenly hotbeds, most delightful flowers,\r\n    Or choice cream-cheeses from celestial dairies.\r\n    But learning in its barbarous seminaries,\r\n    Gives the dear creatures many wretched hours,\r\n    And on their gossamer intellects sternly showers\r\n    Science with all its horrid accessaries.\r\n    Now, seriously, the only things, I think,\r\n    In which young ladies should instructed be,\r\n    Are stocking-mending, love, and cookery--\r\n    Accomplishments that very soon will sink,\r\n    Since Fluxions, now, and Sanscrit conversation,\r\n    Always form part of female education.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOMETHING LIKE A BROTHER\r\n\r\nFLORA: \"What a very pretty waistcoat, Emily!\"\r\n\r\nEMILY: \"Yes, dear. It belongs to my brother Charles. When he goes out of\r\ntown, he puts me on the Free List, as he calls it, of his wardrobe.\r\nIsn't it kind?\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Victorian Damsels_]\r\n\r\nBut even within the ranks of the social _élite_ signs of a desire for\r\nequal rights were not wanting. These, however, were mainly in the\r\ndirection of aping masculinity in sport and dress. In the same year we\r\nread of the Duchess of Marlborough shooting, and a Ladies' Club is\r\nmentioned for the first time a few months earlier. References to the\r\nmistakenly modern idea of ladies smoking are to be found pretty\r\nfrequently even before the Crimean War, which is generally held\r\nresponsible for the introduction of the cigarette, and soon afterwards\r\nwe have a picture of a lady calmly enjoying a smoke in the train. Fine\r\nladies are satirized for emulating their brothers and husbands by\r\nleaving their bills unpaid. It must be owned that woman, if she ventured\r\nto step outside the domain of an amiable, decorative, or domestic mode\r\nof existence met with little commendation from _Punch_. He was a strong\r\nadvocate of schools for cooking long years before the historic advice of\r\n\"Feed the Brute\" appeared in his pages. But the strong-minded female\r\nonly excited his ridicule and satire, though with unkind inconsistency\r\nhe was never weary of making fun of the troubles of the helpless\r\n\"unprotected female.\" There are hundreds of portraits of charming\r\nVictorian damsels in Leech's \"Social Cuts,\" but their predominant trait\r\nis health and amiability. Very rarely do they say anything wise or witty\r\nor plain spoken--even under great provocation from their pert schoolboy\r\nbrothers. But we know--even from the pages of _Punch_--that Victorian\r\nwomen and girls were not all of this yielding and gentle type, and it is\r\nto his credit that in his sketch of \"The Model Fast Lady,\" he was able\r\nto render justice to a phase of advanced womanhood remote alike from\r\nsentimentality and intellectualism:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Model Fast Lady_]\r\n\r\n    She delights in dogs; not King Charles's, but big dogs that live in\r\n    kennels. She takes them into the drawing-room, and makes them leap\r\n    over the chairs. Her mare, too, is never out of her mouth.... If\r\n    she is intimate with you, she will call you \"my dear fellow\"; and\r\n    if she takes a fancy to you, you will be addressed the first time\r\n    by your Christian name, familiarized very shortly from Henry into\r\n    Harry. Her father is hailed as \"Governor.\" Her speech, in fact, is\r\n    a little masculine. If your eyes were shut, you would fancy it was\r\n    a \"Fast Man\" speaking, so quick do the \"snobs,\" and \"nobs,\" and\r\n    \"chaps,\" and \"dowdies,\" \"gawkies,\" \"spoonies,\" \"brats,\" and other\r\n    cherished members of the Fast Human Family run through her loud\r\n    conversation. Occasionally, too, a \"Deuce take it,\" vigorously\r\n    thrown in, or a \"Drat it,\" peculiarly emphasized, will startle you;\r\n    but they are only used as interjections, and mean nothing but\r\n    \"Alas!\" or \"Dear me!\" or, at the most, \"How provoking!\"\r\n\r\n    The MODEL FAST LADY is not particularly attached to dancing. She\r\n    waltzes as if she had made a wager to go round the room one hundred\r\n    and fifty times in five minutes and a quarter. If any one is pushed\r\n    over by the rapidity of her Olga revolutions, she does not stop,\r\n    but merely laughs, and \"hopes no limbs are broken.\"\r\n\r\n    By the bye, if she has a weakness, it is on the score--rather a\r\n    long one--of wagers. She is always betting. It must be mentioned,\r\n    however, that she is most honourable in the payment of her debts.\r\n    She would sell her _Black Bess_ sooner than levant.\r\n\r\n    THE MODEL FAST LADY has, at best, but a superficial knowledge of\r\n    the art of flirting. Compliments, she calls \"stuff\"; and sentiment\r\n    \"namby-pamby nonsense.\" She likes a person to be sensible; and has\r\n    no idea of being made a fool of.\r\n\r\n    At a picnic she is invaluable. When your tumbler is empty, she'll\r\n    take Champagne with you--that is to say, if you're not too proud.\r\n    You may as well fill her glass; she has no notion of being cheated.\r\n    Here's better luck to you! and to enforce it, she runs the point of\r\n    her parasol into your side.\r\n\r\n    She dislikes smoking? Not _she_ indeed; she's rather fond of it. In\r\n    fact, she likes a \"weed\" herself occasionally, and to convince you,\r\n    will take a whiff or two. Her forefinger is not much needle-marked,\r\n    and she laughs at Berlin wool, and all such fiddle faddle. She has\r\n    a pianoforte, but really she has no patience to practise. She can\r\n    play a short tune on the cornet-à-piston.\r\n\r\n    Literature is a sealed pleasure to her, though it is but fair to\r\n    state she reads _Bell's Life_, and has a few volumes in her bedroom\r\n    of the _Sporting Magazine_. She knows there was a horse of the name\r\n    of _Byron_.\r\n\r\n    The FAST LADY rather avoids children. If a baby is put into her\r\n    hands, she says, \"Pray, somebody, come and take this thing, I'm\r\n    afraid of dropping it.\" She prefers the society of men, too, to\r\n    that of her own sex.\r\n\r\n    Her costume is not regulated much by the fashions, and she is\r\n    always the first to come down when the ladies have gone upstairs to\r\n    change their dress.\r\n\r\n    Her greatest accomplishment is to drive. With the whip in one hand\r\n    and the reins in the other, and a key-bugle behind, she would not\r\n    exchange places with the Queen herself.\r\n\r\n    With all these peculiarities and manly addictions, however, the\r\n    FAST LADY is good hearted, very good natured, and never guilty of\r\n    what she would call \"a dirty action.\" Her generosity, too, must be\r\n    included amongst her other faults, for she gives to all, and\r\n    increases the gift by sympathy. She is always in good humour, and,\r\n    like gentle dulness, dearly loves a joke. She is an excellent\r\n    daughter, and her father dotes on her and lets her do what she\r\n    likes, for \"he knows she will never do anything wrong, though she\r\n    is a strange girl.\" In the country she is greatly beloved. The poor\r\n    people call her \"a dear good Miss,\" and present their petitions and\r\n    unfold all their little griefs to her. She is continually having\r\n    more presents of pups sent to her than she knows what to do with.\r\n    The farmers, too, consult her about their cows and pigs, and she is\r\n    the godmother to half the children in the parish.\r\n\r\n    Her deficiencies, after all, are more those of manner than of\r\n    feeling. She may be too largely gifted with the male virtues, but\r\n    then she has a very sparing collection of the female vices. Nature\r\n    may be to blame for having made her one of the weaker vessels, but\r\n    imperfect and manly as she is, she still retains the inward\r\n    gentleness of the woman, and many fine ladies, who stand the\r\n    highest in the pulpits of society, would preach none the less\r\n    effectively if they had only as good a heart--even with the\r\n    trumpery straw in which, like a rich fruit, it is enveloped--as the\r\n    MODEL FAST LADY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FAST YOUNG LADY (to Old Gent): \"Have you such a\r\nthing as a lucifer about you, for I've left my cigar lights at\r\nhome.\"]\r\n\r\nThis was written seventy years ago, but within the last decade we have\r\nseen Miss Compton frequently impersonating _rôles_ of which the leading\r\ntraits were, in essentials, identical with those of the Model Fast\r\nLady. The model woman, married or unmarried, as represented by the\r\nwriters and artists of _Punch_, was feminine, kindly, but colourless,\r\nthough the \"deviations from the norm\" are not overlooked--the\r\nlion-huntresses of Belgravia; thrusting matrons; willing victims of the\r\nsocial tread-mill and the \"petty decalogue of Mode\"; cynical\r\nhigh-priestesses of the marriage market.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to the higher education of women generally the attitude\r\nassumed is nearly always one of mild chaff. _Punch_ refused to take it\r\nseriously, and propounded his own scheme for a female university, in\r\nwhich the fashionable accomplishments are enumerated in detail:--\r\n\r\n    French and Italian as spoken in the fashionable circles, music,\r\n    drawing, fancy-work, and the higher branches of dancing, will form\r\n    the regular _curriculum_. A minor examination on these subjects, or\r\n    a \"Little Go,\" will be instituted before the Spinstership of Arts\r\n    can be tried for. The examined shall be able to \"go on\" anywhere in\r\n    \"Télémaque,\" or in the conversations in Veneroni's Grammar; to play\r\n    a fantasia of Thalberg's; to work a pair of slippers in Berlin\r\n    wool; and to dance the Cachuca and Cracovienne.\r\n\r\n    For the degree of Spinster, the candidate shall be examined in\r\n    various novels by Paul de Kock, Victor Hugo, Balzac, and others;\r\n    also in the _libretto_ of the last new opera. She shall be able to\r\n    play or sing any of the fashionable pieces or airs of the day, and\r\n    shall give evidence of an extensive acquaintance with Bellini,\r\n    Donizetti, Labitzky, and Strauss. She shall draw and embroider, in\r\n    a satisfactory manner, various fruits, flowers, cottages and a\r\n    wood, Greeks and Mussulmen. Lastly, she shall dance, with\r\n    correctness and elegance, a \"pas de deux\" with any young gentleman\r\n    who may be selected for the purpose.\r\n\r\n    There shall be likewise, with respect to music and dancing, an\r\n    annual examination for honours. The candidates shall evince a\r\n    familiarity with the most admirable feats of Taglioni, and the\r\n    Ellslers, and with the most difficult compositions of Herz, Czerny,\r\n    and Bochsa; though if they like they may be allowed to take up, in\r\n    preference, Handel, Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven and Weber.\r\n\r\n    These examinations shall be called respectively the Musical and the\r\n    Dancing Tripos. No one shall be admissible to the latter who has\r\n    not taken honours in the former. The gradations or distinction\r\n    shall be as follows: In the Musical Tripos the foremost damsel\r\n    shall be entitled the Senior Warbler; next shall follow the Simple\r\n    Warblers; the Bravissimas shall come next; then the Bravas; and\r\n    finally those who barely get their degree.\r\n\r\n    The first dancer shall be denominated La Sylphide; after her shall\r\n    be ranked the Sylphs; next to these the first and second Coryphées;\r\n    and lastly, as before, the merely passable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MISS WALKER: A FEMALE POLITICIAN, 1842]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Women and Politics_]\r\n\r\nThis article is fairly typical of the attitude of _Punch_ towards what\r\nwe now call \"Feminism\"--a term so new that in the _New English\r\nDictionary_ it is dismissed in half a dozen words as a rare word meaning\r\n\"the qualities of females\"! That definition, however, was given in 1901.\r\nNow it would have to be revised to include the movement for political\r\nemancipation, economic independence, and admission to the professions.\r\nReferences to female politicians begin in the third volume, where we\r\nfind the very unsympathetic and even acid sketch here given of Miss\r\nWalker, \"the female Chartist.\" Eight years elapsed before ladies were\r\nadmitted to the gallery of the House of Commons, though, even then,\r\ncarefully screened from view by the metal work of the \"Grille,\" an\r\nOrientally obscuring device which lasted till Georgian days. The\r\npossibility of their appearing on the floor of the House is never\r\nseriously contemplated; the \"Parliamentary female\" included amongst the\r\n\"ladies of creation\" in the _Almanack_ for 1852 is modelled on Mrs.\r\nJellyby--_Bleak House_ had been coming out serially from March, 1852,\r\nonwards. The pioneers of the invasion of the professions hailed from\r\nAmerica. Miss Elizabeth Blackwell, M.D., of Boston,[25] is mentioned in\r\n1848, and in the following year _Punch_ welcomed the innovation in\r\nverse:--\r\n\r\nAN M.D. IN A GOWN\r\n\r\n    Young ladies all, of every clime,\r\n      Especially of Britain,\r\n    Who wholly occupy your time\r\n      In novels or in knitting,\r\n    Whose highest skill is but to play,\r\n      Sing, dance, or French to clack well,\r\n    Reflect on the example, pray,\r\n      Of excellent Miss Blackwell!\r\n\r\n    For Doctrix Blackwell--that's the way\r\n      To dub in rightful gender--\r\n    In her profession, ever may\r\n      Prosperity attend her!\r\n    _Punch_, a gold-handled parasol\r\n      Suggests for presentation,\r\n    To one so well deserving all\r\n      Esteem and admiration.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: Miss Blackwell, as we learn from an _In Memoriam_ notice\r\nin _The Times_, was born in Bristol on February 3, 1821, died at\r\nHastings in 1910, and was buried at Kilmun, Argyllshire. She is there\r\ndescribed as \"the first woman doctor.\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Bloomer Craze_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLOOMERISM--AN AMERICAN CUSTOM]\r\n\r\n_Punch's_ commendation rather declines in dignity in the last stanza.\r\nBut we are hardly prepared for his condemnation of women doctors in 1852\r\nmerely on the illogical ground that they were unfitted to walk the\r\nhospitals or use the scalpel. The better training of nurses had been\r\nurged before the days of Florence Nightingale; _Punch_ appreciated the\r\ngossiping humours of Mrs. Gamp, but he was very far from regarding her\r\nas a ministering angel. To the \"strong-minded female,\" however, he had a\r\nstrong antipathy, and in his pictures rather ungenerously emphasized the\r\nunloveliness, even the scragginess, of the advocates of women's rights.\r\nThe famous Amelia Jenks Bloomer was a vigorous suffragist and temperance\r\nreformer, but _Punch_ was only concerned with her campaign on behalf of\r\n\"trouserloons.\" \"Bloomers\" were a constant theme of comment in pantomime\r\nlibrettos; they were adopted by some barmaids; and a \"Bloomer Ball\" was\r\nactually held in the year 1851. This earliest form of \"rational\" dress\r\nfor women was, however, banned by Mayfair. The divided skirt, many years\r\nlater, was more fortunate in having a Viscountess for its chief\r\nadvocate. _Punch_ is not only concerned with feminine dress-vagaries. He\r\nmakes a semi-frivolous suggestion of the appointment of a Poetess\r\nLaureate, and the \"Letters from Mary Ann,\" though they form a new\r\ndeparture and indicate an increased readiness to treat the claims of\r\nwomen from the women's point of view, cannot be regarded as a\r\nwhole-hearted contribution to the cause. Women were already knocking at\r\nthe door of other professions. In 1855 we find references to ladies at\r\nthe Bar in America and women preachers in Methodist chapels in England.\r\nThe first Exhibition of Women Artists is noticed in July, 1857.\r\n_Punch's_ anticipation of women policemen in 1851 was probably prompted\r\nnot by a desire to see the innovation realized, but merely served as a\r\nmeans of guying bloomerism. The female omnibus conductor is another\r\npiece of unconscious prophecy, as she was imaginatively represented as\r\nbeing in charge of 'buses for ladies only, to relieve male passengers\r\nfrom the pressure of voluminous dresses and redundant parcels. But while\r\n_Punch_ was an opponent of woman suffrage and, at best, a lukewarm\r\nsupporter of woman's demand for professional employment, he was--as we\r\nhave shown in other sections of this survey--at least a persistent\r\nadvocate of the reform of the Divorce Laws--and unwearied in his\r\nexposure of the hardships and sufferings of underpaid governesses,\r\nsweated sempstresses, and women-workers generally. Brutal assaults on\r\nwomen were, in his view, altogether inadequately punished by fine. He\r\nwas alive to their wrongs if not to their \"rights,\" and the sneers of\r\nsome of his contemporaries at the Women's Petition in 1856 moved him to\r\nindignation:--\r\n\r\nTHE CRY OF THE WOMEN\r\n\r\n    Now, this petition or lamentation--in which _Mr. Punch_ gives\r\n    willing ear to the cry of weakness and unjust suffering--has been\r\n    rebuked, pooh-poohed, pished and fiddle-de-dee'd; but in these\r\n    scoffings _Mr. Punch_ joineth not. He cannot, for the life of him,\r\n    say, with certain editorial porcupines of the male gender, \"Of what\r\n    avail these lamentations of lamenting women, whose cries are\r\n    foolishness? Wherefore should women at any time lift up their\r\n    voices; when is it not manifest from the beginning that women were\r\n    created to sing small? And finally, if women be beaten by savages,\r\n    and robbed by sots, what of it? It is better that women should be\r\n    beaten and crouch in the dust--it is better they should be robbed\r\n    and sit at home, than go and petition Parliament.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _\"Punch\" Champions Horatia_]\r\n\r\nHe espoused the cause of humble heroines, of the neglected widows or\r\norphans of heroes and benefactors like a true knight errant. Elsewhere\r\nwe have told of his exertions on behalf of Mother Seacole, the brave old\r\nsutler in the Crimea, for whose benefit he started a special fund. The\r\nscurvy treatment of the widow of Lieutenant Waghorn, the pioneer of the\r\nOverland Route, who wore himself out in a work of national importance,\r\nmoved him to righteous indignation. She was given a pension of £25,\r\nafterwards increased to £40.\r\n\r\nBut none of these palpable wrongs to women stirred _Punch_ so deeply in\r\nthese years as the tardy and meagre discharge of the nation's debt to\r\nNelson in respect of his daughter Horatia. To this particular bit of\r\nnarrow-mindedness he recurs again and again in the years 1849 to 1855,\r\nwhen he sums up what had been done to liquidate the debt:--\r\n\r\nNELSON'S DAUGHTER AND GRANDCHILDREN\r\n\r\n An advertisement in _The Times_ tells the world that the eight\r\n children of Nelson's daughter Horatia--Nelson's grandchildren--are\r\n \"more or less provided for.\" Perhaps a little less than more; but\r\n let that pass. At length a long, long standing debt has been paid,\r\n or rather compounded, at something less than nineteen shillings in\r\n the pound. The Government, as the Government, has done nothing. The\r\n stiff, whalebone virtue that set up the back of Queen Charlotte\r\n against Nelson's daughter--George the Third thought Nelson's\r\n funeral had too much state in it for a mere subject; such pomp \"was\r\n for kings\"--still kept the Government aloof from all help of\r\n Horatia and her children. At length, however, the press spoke out.\r\n The \"ribald press\" for a time laid aside its ribaldry, and\r\n condescended to champion the claims of Nelson's daughter upon\r\n Nelson's fellow-countrymen. Well, something has been done; and thus\r\n much in explanation we take from the advertisement in question:--\r\n\r\n    \"The eight children of Horatia, Mrs. Ward, are all now, more or\r\n    less, provided for. Her eldest son has been presented to the living\r\n    of Radstock by the Dowager Countess of Waldegrave; the second son\r\n    had been previously appointed by Sir W. Burnett Assistant-Surgeon\r\n    in the Navy; to the third, Lord Chancellor Cranworth has given a\r\n    clerkship in the Registry-Office; the fourth son received a Cadetcy\r\n    from Captain Shepherd; His Royal Highness Prince Albert conferred a\r\n    similar appointment on the youngest son; and Her Majesty has been\r\n    graciously pleased to settle upon the three daughters a pension of\r\n    £300 per annum. To this last result the exertions of the late Mr.\r\n    Hume, M.P., mainly contributed. Messrs. Green, of Blackwall, and\r\n    Messrs. Smith, of Newcastle, conveyed the two Cadets to India free\r\n    of expense.\"\r\n\r\nTo this may be added a \"small cash balance\" paid to Mrs. Ward, \"after\r\ninvesting £400 in the funds.\" Altogether some £1,427 have been\r\nsubscribed in the cause of Nelson's daughter. We state the sum, and will\r\nnot pause to calculate whether the amount be the tenth of a farthing or\r\neven a whole farthing in the pound, for which England is Nelson's\r\ndebtor. Let us anyway thank those who have helped Horatia's children.\r\nThey have all done well, from the Dowager Countess to the Queen, ending\r\nwith the prince ship-owners of Blackwall and Newcastle. Their ships will\r\nnot have the worst fortune of wreck or storm for having borne,\r\npassage-free, the grandsons of Nelson to their Indian work. Let us, too,\r\npause to thank the shade of Joseph Hume--the strong, sound, kind old\r\nheart! Joseph, who \"mainly contributed,\" with those earnest, honest\r\nfingers of his to undraw the royal purse-strings, so that the three\r\ngrand-daughters may now keep the wolf from the door, as their immortal\r\ngrandfather kept the foe from the \"silver-girt isle.\"\r\n\r\nWe omit the bitter words in which _Punch_ heaps scorn on Nelson's\r\nbrother, \"the first parson Lord Nelson,\" because the odious charges\r\nthere made cannot be substantiated. This was not the only occasion on\r\nwhich _Punch's_ zeal was disfigured by the vehemence of his\r\npartisanship. But we cannot blame him for his jubilation over the\r\nthrashing of General Haynau, the woman-flogger, by the draymen and\r\nlabourers at Barclay's Brewery on the occasion of his visit to London in\r\n1850, or for the vigour with which he scarified the papers who found\r\nexcuses and parallels for Haynau's ferocity in the military exigencies\r\nof the Peninsular War.\r\n\r\n[_Sidenote: Slavery in America--and England_]\r\n\r\nForemost amongst _Punch's_ heroines in the 'forties and 'fifties were\r\nJenny Lind, the Swedish, and Florence, the English Nightingale, but of\r\nthese mention is made elsewhere. In general, the personalities of\r\nnotable or notorious women were not unfairly exploited in the pages of\r\n_Punch_. The conspicuous isolation of Miss, afterwards Baroness, Burdett\r\nCoutts, in virtue of her great wealth, suggests in 1846 the problem,\r\nWhom will she marry? which was not settled until 1881. Less restraint is\r\nshown in dealing with the arrival in England, after practically ruling\r\nBavaria for more than a year, of the meteoric adventuress, Lola\r\nMontez,[26] and with her marriage with a young Cornet in the Life Guards\r\nin July, 1849. Another visitor, of a very different sort, was the famous\r\nMrs. Beecher-Stowe,[27] author of _Uncle Tom's Cabin_, whose sojourn in\r\nEngland in 1853 brought the question of slavery in America into social\r\nprominence and led to the presentation of the \"Stafford House Address,\"\r\ninitiated by the Duchess of Sutherland, to the women of America. The\r\nappeal was not well received, being answered by the \"Address of many\r\nthousands of the women of the United States,\" who pointed out the\r\ndegraded conditions in which the poor in England lived. Two wrongs do\r\nnot make a right, but there was excuse for the retort. The Southern\r\nplanters were not all Legrees. Let it be added that, in his indignation\r\nat the inadequate sentences passed on wife-beaters, _Punch_ did not fail\r\nto pillory cruel mothers who tortured or neglected their children. In\r\nthe autumn of 1856 he contrasts the sentence of four years on a woman\r\nwho had tortured her daughter to death with that of fifteen years on a\r\nman for mutilating a sheep. Already the problem of the numerical\r\ndisparity of the sexes and the hard case of the \"superfluous woman\" had\r\nbegun to attract attention, and emigration was preached as a panacea. To\r\nwhat has been written elsewhere on the remedy and _Punch's_ belief in\r\nit, we may add his remarks on \"Our female supernumeraries\":--\r\n\r\n    _The Cynical View_:--Wherever there is mischief, women are sure to\r\n    be at the bottom of it. The state of the country bears out this old\r\n    saying. All our difficulties arise from a superabundance of\r\n    females. The only remedy for this evil is to pack up bag and\r\n    baggage, and start them away.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: The stage name of Marie Dolores Eliza Rosanna Gilbert,\r\ndaughter of an English officer, born at Limerick in 1818, the favourite\r\nof the old King Ludwig of Bavaria; dancer, actress, author, lecturer,\r\nwho died in New York \"sincerely penitent\" in 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: See the _Examiner_ and _Punch_. The following\r\nadvertisement in the _Examiner_ will be read with interest:--\"The\r\narrival of Mrs. Beecher-Stowe has given an impetus to the demand for all\r\nStephen Glover's compositions connected with _Uncle Tom_: 'The Sea of\r\nGlass,' Eliza's song 'Sleep, our child,' 'Eva's Parting Words,' and\r\nTopsy's song 'I'm but a little nigger girl.'\"]\r\n\r\n    _The Alarmist View_:--If the surplus female population with which\r\n    we are overrun increases much more, we shall be eaten up with\r\n    women. What used to be our better half will soon become our worse\r\n    nine-tenths; a numerical majority which it will be vain to contend\r\n    with, and which will reduce our free and glorious constitution to\r\n    that most degrading of all despotisms, a petticoat government.\r\n\r\n    _Our Own View_:--It is lamentable that thousands of poor girls\r\n    should starve here upon slops, working for slopsellers, and only\r\n    not dying old maids because dying young, when stalwart mates and\r\n    solid meals might be found for all in Australia. Doubtless they\r\n    would fly as fast as the Swedish hen-chaffinches--if only they had\r\n    the means of flying. It remains with the Government and the country\r\n    to find them wings.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Worm Turns_]\r\n\r\n_Punch's_ chivalry to women is beyond question, but it was not\r\nuntempered by a certain condescension. Throughout these years--with rare\r\nexceptions--he remains faithful to the old assumption that no woman\r\ncould have a sense of humour. Grown-up sisters are frequently\r\nrepresented as being unmercifully chaffed by small brothers without\r\napparently having the slightest power of effectual rejoinder. And this\r\ndefect is shown in the pictures, where the women are exceedingly\r\npleasant to look at, but nearly always quite expressionless. Yet in\r\nmoments of generous expansion _Punch_ was capable of crediting them with\r\nextremely damaging criticism of their lords and masters. The high-water\r\nmark of his sympathy with female emancipation in these years is to be\r\nfound in the homely remonstrances of \"Mrs. Mouser\" in \"A Bit of my\r\nMind\":--\r\n\r\n     ... Well, the hypocrisy of men all over the world, especially the\r\n    civilized!--for, after all, the savages are really and truly more\r\n    of the gentlemen. They mean what they say to the sex, and act up to\r\n    it; they don't call the suffering creatures lilies, and roses, and\r\n    angels, and jewels of life, and then treat 'em as if they were\r\n    weeds of the world, and pebbles of the highway. But with civilized\r\n    nations--as I fling it at Mouser--they all of 'em make women the\r\n    sign-post pictures of everything that's beautiful and behave to the\r\n    dear originals as if they were born simpletons. \"Look at Liberty,\r\n    Mr. Mouser,\" said I, \"look, you want to make Liberty look as lovely\r\n    as it can be done, and what do you do? Why, you're obliged to come\r\n    to women for the only beautiful Liberty that will serve you. You\r\n    paint and stamp Liberty as a woman, and then--but it's so like\r\n    you--then you won't suffer so much as a single petticoat to take\r\n    her seat in the House of Commons. And next, Mouser\"--for I would be\r\n    heard--\"and next, you want the figure of Justice. Woman again.\r\n    There she is, with her balance and sword, as the sort of\r\n    public-house sign for law, but--is a poor woman allowed to wear\r\n    false hair, and put a black gown upon her back, and so much as once\r\n    open her mouth on the Queen's Bench? May she put a tippet of ermine\r\n    on herself--may she even find herself in a jury? Oh, no: you can\r\n    paint Justice, and cut her in stone, but you never let the poor\r\n    thing say a syllable.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Are you going?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, ye-es. The fact is that your party is so slow and I am weally so\r\ninfernally bored, that I shall go somewhere and smoke a quiet cigar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, good-night. As you are by no means handsome, a great puppy, and\r\nnot in the least amusing, I think it is the best thing you can do.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFASHION IN DRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a noteworthy sign of the times that between 1841 and 1857 the\r\nspecific references to the dress of men in the text of _Punch_ are much\r\nmore numerous than those dealing with the vagaries of female attire. The\r\nbalance inclines in the contrary direction in the pictures which, when\r\ntested by old daguerreotypes and the contents of family albums, form a\r\nsubstantially correct and illuminating commentary on the evolution of\r\nfashion in women's dress. So we begin with the ladies, with the double\r\nproviso that Leech and Doyle and their brother artists on _Punch_ were\r\nnot fashion-plate designers, and that the charms and extravagances of\r\nthe modish world which they depicted were drawn mainly from the\r\nMetropolis. _Punch_ was a Londoner, even a Cockney, and throws little\r\nlight on the social life of the provinces.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Breadth of the Fashion_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EASIER SAID THAN DONE\r\n\r\nMASTER OF THE HOUSE: \"Oh, Fred, my boy--when dinner is ready, you take\r\nMrs. Furbelow downstairs!\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRAND CHARGE OF PERAMBULATORS--AND DEFEAT OF SWELLS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ILLUSTRATION FROM AN UNPUBLISHED NOVEL]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Aids to Beauty_]\r\n\r\nTo speak roughly, fashion in women's dress is subject to two great\r\nalternating influences--in the direction of elongation or of lateral\r\nextension. In the 'forties and 'fifties the tendency was steadily in the\r\nsecond direction and away from the slim elegance which has been the aim\r\nof the modistes of recent years. Long, \"mud-bedraggled\" dresses are, it\r\nis true, condemned in 1844, but width rather than length was the\r\nprevailing feature. It was the age of flounces, and this expansive\r\ntendency culminated, in the mid-'fifties, in the reign of the crinoline,\r\nagainst which _Punch_ waged for many years a truceless but, as he\r\nhimself admitted, a wholly ineffectual warfare. The first indication of\r\nthe coming portent is to be found in the _annus mirabilis_ of 1848, when\r\nan \"air-tube dress extender\" is shown in a picture. This, however, was a\r\nsingle hoop and comparatively modest in its circumference. The\r\ncrinoline, in its full amplitude, did not invade London until 1856.\r\nThenceforward, hardly a number is free from satire and caricature of\r\nthis exuberant monstrosity, and the inconvenience caused in theatres,\r\ndrawing-rooms, in the parks and public vehicles, and in the streets.\r\nWhat with the bath-chairs of invalids, the ladies' dresses, and the\r\nchildren's perambulators, we read in 1856, that \"it amounts almost to an\r\nimpossibility nowadays to walk on the pavements.\" People were now\r\ndressed \"not in the height, but the full breadth of the fashion.\" The\r\nstructure of the machine, with its whalebone ribs and inflated tubes,\r\nwas revealed in all its mammoth dimensions. It was denounced alike as an\r\nabsurdity and as a danger, but satire and warnings were equally\r\npowerless to abate the nuisance. But the crinoline was only the most\r\nconspicuous and culminating example of a tendency to superfluous\r\nclothing and a semi-Oriental muffling-up of the female form, against\r\nwhich _Punch_ has lived to see a most acute and wholesome reaction. A\r\nsentimental \"Buoy at the Nore\" writes to put on record a protest against\r\nthe enormous sunbonnets which covered up the \"dear heads\" of beauties on\r\nthe Ramsgate sands. In those days the use of cosmetics and pigments was\r\nfar less general; veils and bonnets and sunshades, notably the\r\nprojection aptly nicknamed the \"Ugly,\" were in great demand. The\r\nresources of civilization were employed to preserve complexions rather\r\nthan to supply artificial substitutes. So we find _Punch_ in 1855\r\ndescribing with much gusto a young lady at the seaside wearing: (1) A\r\nhuge, round hat doubled down to eclipse all but her chin, (2) an \"Ugly\"\r\nof similar magnitude, (3) a veil, and (4) a parasol. These huge, round\r\nhats, like shallow bowls, were worn by little girls, who were often\r\ndressed like their parents with flounces and voluminous skirts. But\r\nextremes meet, and along with the monstrous seaside hats--big enough to\r\nbe used as a substitute for an archery target by undisciplined younger\r\nbrothers--small bonnets, worn on the back of the head, and tiny parasols\r\nwere in vogue in 1853. A certain masculinity of attire was affected by\r\nyoung ladies of sporting tastes--in the way of waistcoats and ties for\r\nexample--but the fashionable world set its face as a flint against\r\nanything in the way of rational dress reform. In 1851 we find one of the\r\nearliest instances in _Punch_ of the use of the word \"æsthetic\" in\r\nconnexion with costume, where in an imaginary dialogue Miss Runt, a\r\nstrong-minded female, speaks of \"our dress viewed as sanitary,\r\neconomical, æsthetic.\"[28] Mayfair had no appreciation of any of these\r\naspects of millinery, and \"Bloomerism\" never caught on with the\r\nfashionable world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHAT MUST BE THE NEXT FASHION IN BONNETS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAIN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RINGLETS]\r\n\r\nThis was the age of flounces and crinolines; it was also the age of\r\nringlets. Bands and braids and hair nets are features of early Victorian\r\n_coiffure_, but ringlets were undoubtedly the favourite mode for full\r\ndress occasions. The fashion lasted for a good many years. You will find\r\nit in the ballroom scene depicted by Leech in 1847, and Leech\r\nillustrated Surtees's novel _Plain or Ringlets?_ in 1860. Of the \"plain\"\r\nvariety of hairdressing there are several good examples in _Punch_,\r\nnotably the head given above, with which we couple the ringleted belle\r\nillustrated at the foot of the same page.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: \"Æsthetical\" was noticed as early as 1847 in a dig at _New\r\nCuriosities of Literature_, and in 1853 we read of an \"æsthetic tea,\" at\r\nwhich \"the atmosphere was one of architecture, painting, stained glass,\r\nbrasses, heraldry, wood carving, madrigals, chants, motets, mysticism\r\nand theology.\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Coiffures in the Fifties]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ÆSTHETIC PIONEERS\r\n\r\nMRS. TURTLEDOVE: \"Dearest Alfred! Will you decide now what we shall have\r\nfor dinner?\"\r\n\r\nMR. TURTLEDOVE: \"Let me see, poppet. We had a wafer yesterday--suppose\r\nwe have a roast butterfly to-day.\"]\r\n\r\nIn the mid-'fifties, it may be noted, it was the fashion for women to\r\nwear gold and silver dust in their hair. In 1854 it was often dressed _à\r\nl'impératrice_ in imitation of the Empress Eugénie, and _Punch_\r\nsatirizes as an absurdity the general adoption of a _coiffure_ unsuited\r\nto people of certain ages, features, and positions--a wide scope for his\r\nwit. Tight lacing is seldom noted, and in one respect the ladies of the\r\ntime were exempt from censure: high heels had not yet come in, or, if\r\nthey had, they escaped _Punch's_ vigilant eye. In the main Leech, on\r\nwhose pencil the burden of social commentary fell, was a genial satirist\r\nof feminine foibles. Whether they were dancing or riding or bathing,\r\nwalking or doing nothing, the young women he drew were almost\r\ninvariably comely to behold. And that reminds me that the decorum of\r\nsea-bathing in the 'fifties was promoted by the apparatus known as the\r\nawning, attached to bathing machines. Children were handed over to the\r\nrigours of old bathing-women as depicted in the terrifying picture\r\nopposite.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MERMAIDS AT PLAY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATHING WOMAN: \"Master Franky wouldn't cry! No! Not\r\nhe!--He'll come to his Martha, and bathe like a man!\"]\r\n\r\nTurning to male attire we have to note that the main features of men's\r\ndress as we know it was already established, though in regard to colour,\r\ndetails, and decoration the influence of the Regency period still made\r\nitself felt. Trousers were first generally introduced in the Army (see\r\nParkes's _Hygiene_) at the time of the Peninsular War, but\r\npantaloons--the tight-fitting nether garments which superseded\r\nknee-breeches late in the eighteenth century, and were secured at the\r\nankles with ribbons and straps, were fashionable in the 'forties. You\r\nwill see no trousers, as we know them to-day, in the illustrations to\r\n_Pickwick_, and in the early 'forties pantaloons appear in _Punch's_\r\nillustrations of fashionable wear at dances. The cut of the\r\n\"claw-hammer\" dress-coat does not differ from that of to-day, but it was\r\noften of blue cloth with brass buttons; shirts were frilled, and\r\nwaistcoats of gold-sprigged satin. The bow tie was larger, resembling\r\nthat worn by nigger minstrels. \"Gibus,\" or crush hats, did not arrive\r\ntill the late 'forties--they are mentioned in Thackeray's _Book of\r\nSnobs_, and gentlemen always carried their tall hats in their hands at\r\nevening parties, and habitually wore them at clubs. For morning wear\r\nblue frock-coats, with white drill trousers and straps, were fashionable\r\nin 1844. Stocks and cravats and neck-cloths had not been ousted by ties.\r\nThe _dégagé_ loose neck-cloth of the \"fast man\" in 1848 is ridiculed by\r\n_Punch_, who traces its origin to the neck-wear--as modern hosiers\r\nsay--of the British dustman. Amongst overcoats the Taglioni, a sack-like\r\ngarment, called after the famous dancer, is most frequently mentioned;\r\nthe Petersham, a heavy overcoat named after Lord Petersham, a dandy of\r\nthe Waterloo period, still held its own. The Crimea brought Alma\r\novercoats, Balaklava wrappers, and Crimea cloaks, and about the same\r\ntime _Punch_ caricatures a long garment reaching nearly to the heels,\r\nwhich gave the wearer the appearance of a toy figure from a Noah's Ark.\r\nThere is a mention of the \"Aquascutum\" waterproof ten years earlier. One\r\nStultz was the fashionable tailor of the time. The chief hatter, however\r\n(according to _Punch_), was Prince Albert, whose continual and\r\nunfortunate experiments with headgear have been mentioned elsewhere.\r\n_Punch_ speaks of his obsession as a monomania; he only abstained from\r\ncalling him \"the mad hatter\" because that engaging personage had not yet\r\nemerged from the brain of Lewis Carroll. But _Punch_ himself was much\r\npreoccupied with hats. There was a certain elegance about the tall\r\nbeaver hat which tapered towards the crown. There was none in the rigid\r\n\"chimney-pot\" or cylinder silk hat, the ugliest of all European\r\nhead-dresses, with its flat, narrow brim, which was \"established\" by\r\n1850. _Punch_ warred against it almost as vigorously and as\r\nineffectually as against the crinoline. Indeed, in 1851 he even went to\r\nthe length of suggesting the form and materials suitable for an ideal\r\nhat:--\r\n\r\n    Take an easy and well-cut morning jacket of the form no longer\r\n    confined to the stableyard or barrack room, but admitted alike into\r\n    breakfast parlour and country house, or the hanging paletot with a\r\n    waistcoat, not scrimp and tight, but long and ample, and wide and\r\n    well-made trousers of any of the neutral-tinted woollen fabrics\r\n    that our northern looms are so prolific in; and we assert\r\n    fearlessly that a broad-leafed and flexible _sombrero_ of grey, or\r\n    brown or black felt may be worn with such a costume, to complete a\r\n    dress at once becoming and congruous.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Fashions for Men_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHY, INDEED!\r\n\r\nPERCEPTIVE CHILD: \"Mamma, dear! Why do those gentlemen dress themselves\r\nlike the funny little men in the Noah's Ark?\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MOST ALARMING SWELLING!]\r\n\r\nThe resources of modern newspaper enterprise were not then available to\r\nenable _Punch_ to realize his ideal, but he continued to tilt at the\r\n\"chimney-pot,\" though he never succeeded in dethroning it. High collars\r\nare caricatured in 1854. At first they were wide as well as high, but\r\nthe \"all round collar\" of which _Punch_ has a picture in 1854\r\napproximates to the lofty cincture worn by the present Lord Spencer when\r\na member of the House of Commons. The monocle was not uncommon; but the\r\ncaricature of Colonel Sibthorp, one of _Punch's_ favourite butts, shows\r\nthat the square shape was still used. White waistcoats were noted as the\r\nemblem of the blameless life of the \"Young England\" party. For the\r\ngrotesque extravagances of fashion Oxford undergraduates, forerunners of\r\nlittle Mr. Bouncer, are singled out for satire, but if we are to believe\r\n_Mr. Punch_, caricature was unnecessary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Ideal Hat_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"SIBBY\"--1843]\r\n\r\nIf this was the age of ringlets for women, it was the age of whiskers,\r\nshort but ambrosial, for men. The long \"Piccadilly weepers\" of Lord\r\nDundreary were a slightly later development, but Leech's \"swells\" all\r\nwear whiskers in the 'forties and 'fifties. (Is not the habit\r\nimmortalized in the mid-Victorian comic song: \"The Captain with his\r\nwhiskers cast a sly glance at me\"?) They wore small moustaches, too, and\r\noccasionally chin-tufts. Under the head of \"Moustaches for the Million,\"\r\n_Punch_, in 1847, ironically suggests the placing of sham moustaches on\r\nthe market for the benefit of seedy bucks, swell-mobsmen, inmates of the\r\nQueen's Bench prison, and all impostors who affected a social status to\r\nwhich they had no claim or which they had forfeited. But what he calls\r\nthe \"Moustache Movement\" in the early 'fifties was undoubtedly inspired\r\nby military example, and was followed by the fashion of growing beards.\r\nThe necessity of campaigning became the adornment of peace, and in 1854\r\nand 1855 we find pictures of tremendously bearded railway guards and\r\nticket-collectors, whose appearance terrifies old ladies and gentlemen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Uncomfortable Uniforms_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROCTOR (to Undergraduate): \"Pray, Sir, will you be so\r\ngood as to tell me whether you are a member of the University, or a\r\nScotch terrier?\"]\r\n\r\nThe vagaries of military uniforms--apart from the intrusions of Prince\r\nAlbert--call for separate treatment. The new and very skimpy\r\nshell-jacket introduced in 1848 evokes imaginary protests alike from\r\nstout and lean officers. The short, high-shouldered military cape is\r\nguyed in 1851. In 1854 _Punch_ throws himself with great energy into the\r\nmovement for the abolition of the high stock and the adoption of more\r\nrational and comfortable clothing--witness the verses, \"Valour under\r\ndifficulties,\" depicting the sufferings of a half-strangled militia-man;\r\nthe caricature of the \"New Albert Bonnet\"; the cartoon in which Private\r\nJones in a bearskin, black in the face from the strangulation of his\r\nstock, is afraid that his head is coming off; the ridiculous frogged\r\ntunic with a very low belt; and the comments on the Army Order, issued\r\nby Sidney Herbert in 1854, providing white linen covers for helmets and\r\nshakos as a protection against the heat. The sufferings endured by\r\nsoldiers owing to their heavy packs and marching kit are not forgotten.\r\nBut these abuses, like the story of the bad and rotten boots provided by\r\ncontractors for the Crimea, do not belong to a chronicle of fashion, but\r\nto the scandalous history of commerce. Did history repeat itself in some\r\nmeasure in the Great War?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUDE BOY: \"O, look 'ere, Jim!--If 'ere ain't a Lobster\r\nbin and out-growed his cloak!\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DRAMA, OPERA, MUSIC, AND THE FINE ARTS\r\n\r\n\r\nOne must not expect to find a detached, impartial, or coldly critical\r\nsurvey of the drama in the pages of _Punch_. Most of his staff had\r\ndabbled in play-writing; Douglas Jerrold was a prolific, accomplished,\r\nand, so far as prestige went, a successful dramatist, but he had reaped\r\na singularly meagre reward for his industry and talent. He had fallen\r\nout with managers, and his quarrel with Charles Kean was not without its\r\ninfluence on _Punch's_ persistent disparagement of that actor. Yet, when\r\nall allowance has been made for these personal motives and the querulous\r\ntone which they occasionally inspired, _Punch_ may fairly claim to have\r\nrendered valuable service to the British drama in this period. He was\r\nsound in essentials: in his whole-hearted devotion to Shakespeare and\r\nloyal support of those, like Phelps and Mrs. Warner, who under great\r\ndifficulties, and with no fashionable patronage, gave good performances\r\nof Shakespearean plays at moderate prices; in his unceasing attacks on\r\n\"Newgate plays,\" \"poison plays,\" the cult of the criminal whether native\r\nor foreign, stage buffoonery, over-reliance on mere upholstery, dramatic\r\n_clichés_, and solecisms in pronunciation.[29] He was also a reformer in\r\nhis advocacy of improvements for the comfort and convenience of the\r\nplay-goer, such as the abolition of the rule of evening dress. And, as\r\nwe have seen, he rebuked mummer-worship, holding that \"the players'\r\nvanity has been the curse of the modern drama.\" His continued and\r\npointed remonstrance with the Court for discouraging British plays and\r\nBritish-born players has been already noted. It runs through the first\r\nten years of _Punch_ with little intermission and was largely\r\njustified. _Punch_ was able to congratulate Prince Albert on subscribing\r\nto the fund raised to purchase Shakespeare's house for the nation in\r\n1847, but in the main his grievance was genuine. Foreign artists and\r\nfreaks were far too freely patronized and encouraged at Court. The\r\nbalance has long since been redressed, and another grievance--the\r\ndependence of managers on translations and adaptations from French plays\r\nas set forth in the following extract--has been largely remedied, though\r\nthe remedy, so far as the importation of American plays is concerned, is\r\nby some critics considered worse than the disease:--\r\n\r\n    _Galignani's Messenger_ says of the French theatre:--\r\n\r\n    \"There were produced in 1842 at the different theatres of Paris,\r\n    191 new pieces.\"\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Punch_ says of the English theatre:--\r\n\r\n    \"There were produced in 1842 at the different theatres of London\r\n    about _ten_ new pieces; the rest being hashed, fricasseed,\r\n    devilled, warmed up, from old stock brought from France or stolen\r\n    from the manufactory of Bentley and others!\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: See the protest against \"skee-yi,\" \"blee-yew,\" \"kee-yind,\"\r\n\"dis-gyee-ise,\" for \"sky,\" \"blue,\" \"kind,\" \"disguise.\"]\r\n\r\nCensure is impartially bestowed on home-made and imported specimens of\r\nthe Newgate drama--_Jack Sheppard_ and _Madame Lafarge_.[30] Of the\r\nlatter we read that besides being revolting it was \"disgusting and\r\nfilthy.\" The play is compared, to its great disadvantage, with _The\r\nBeggar's Opera_, which is defended as being \"real satire and not\r\nwallowing in vice.\" George Stephens's tragedy _Martinuzzi_ comes in for\r\nfrequent ridicule, though the chief _rôles_ were taken by Phelps and\r\nMrs. Warner, and the ridicule seems to have been well deserved. On what\r\ngrounds Stephens gained a place in the D.N.B. is not evident, as his\r\ndramas soon died beyond all possibilities of resurrection. Lord Mahon's\r\n\"petition\" to Parliament on behalf of the drama in the year 1842 met\r\nwith _Punch's_ support. It amounted to this, that Parliament in the\r\nbounty of its wisdom would permit what were then called the minor\r\ntheatres to play the very best dramas they could obtain; as it was they\r\nwere only open to the very worst. Douglas Jerrold writing under his\r\nsignature of \"Q\" then develops the argument:--\r\n\r\n    Virtue, decency, loyalty, and a bundle of other excellences, are\r\n    only valuable in Westminster. In that city of light and goodness,\r\n    the Lord Chamberlain deputes some holy man to read all plays ere\r\n    they are permitted to be produced before a Westminster audience.\r\n    There is no such care taken of the souls of Southwark or Islington.\r\n    The Victoria audiences may be the Alsatians of play-goers, and\r\n    laugh, and weep, and hoot, in defiance of Law. They get their _Jack\r\n    Sheppards_, unlicensed and unpaid for; but the strait-laced\r\n    frequenters of the Adelphi and Olympic have the satisfaction of\r\n    knowing that their _Jack Sheppard_ has been licensed by a Deputy,\r\n    for a certain amount of Her Majesty's money. There, the beauties of\r\n    Tyburn are exhibited with a _cum privilegio_.\r\n\r\n    Will Lord Mahon's petition have the effect of altering this\r\n    wickedness, this stupidity, this injustice and absurdity? We _hope_\r\n    it may; but, we repeat it, we have little faith in the enthusiasm\r\n    of Parliament. With the worthy gentlemen who compose it, the\r\n    playhouse is become low and vulgar. Were they called upon to debate\r\n    what should be the statute length of Cerito's petticoats, we should\r\n    have greater hope of their activity, than when the subject involves\r\n    the true interests of the English dramatist, and the real value of\r\n    the English stage.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: Madame Lafarge (1816-52) achieved a sinister\r\nimmortality by the famous poisoning case which bears her name, \"one\r\nof the most obscure in the annals of French justice\" (Larousse).\r\nAfter being imprisoned for twelve years she was released and died\r\nin 1852.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Lord Mahon's Petition_]\r\n\r\n_Punch's_ pessimism was fortunately not justified by the sequel, for in\r\nthe following year, 1843, the Theatres Act abolished the monopoly of the\r\npatent theatres--which for more than a hundred years had confined the\r\nlegitimate drama to Covent Garden, Drury Lane and the Haymarket--and\r\nthus inaugurated a policy of free trade.\r\n\r\nDéjazet's London _début_ in 1843 provoked the comment, applied by a\r\nlater humorist to one of the plays of Aristophanes, that she was \"as\r\nbroad as she was long\"; and the production of a ballet on Lady Macbeth\r\nin the same year prompted the really prophetic suggestion that the only\r\nway to get a five-act tragedy performed was to omit the whole of the\r\ndialogue and give the _rôle_ of heroine to a _première danseuse_. As a\r\nmatter of fact Taglioni appeared in _Electra_ in 1845.\r\n\r\nIn 1844 _Punch_ took a very gloomy view of the dramatic outlook; French\r\ndishes predominated, Shakespeare was \"Cibberized,\" and comedy vulgarized\r\nat the Adelphi and the Olympic. Nor was he cheered by the activities of\r\na society called the Syncretics, \"whose boast it is that they can write\r\ntragedies which no company can act, and no audience can sit out\"--a\r\nboast which might be triumphantly re-echoed by similar societies to-day.\r\nA Greek play, the _Antigone_, produced at Covent Garden in 1845 was an\r\nearly harbinger of the fruitful movement which began at the end of the\r\n'seventies. _Punch's_ spirits, however, had already revived somewhat\r\nwhen \"Shakespeare though banished from Drury Lane and Covent Garden\r\nfound the snuggest asylum near the New River\"--at Sadler's Wells under\r\nthe enterprising management of Samuel Phelps and Mrs. Warner in 1844,\r\nand in the following year he notes that Shakespeare, expelled from\r\nEngland to make way for the ballet, had been welcomed in Paris in the\r\nperson of Macready. The public knowledge of Shakespeare at the time was,\r\naccording to _Punch_, confined to \"elegant extracts.\"\r\n\r\nA curious sidelight is thrown on the composition of theatrical\r\nprogrammes in the 'forties by the ironical regret expressed at the\r\npassing of the old school of comic song: \"The old comic song was a\r\ndescription in lively verse of a murder or a suicide or some domestic\r\naffliction, and if sung at a minor theatre just after the half-price\r\ncame in, never missed an encore.\" At the major theatres, and especially\r\nDrury Lane, the cast in spectacular plays was already reinforced by\r\nfour-footed performers, and processions of animals through the streets\r\nwere a familiar mode of theatrical advertisement. Managerial enterprise\r\nhas always had its menagerial side. Foreign bipeds, however, were not\r\nalways popular, and when _Monte Cristo_ was produced at Drury Lane in\r\n1848, with French performers, there was a patriotic hostile\r\ndemonstration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Passing of Pantomimes_]\r\n\r\nJudged by modern standards salaries were modest. Well-known actors are\r\ncharged with extortion in demanding £60 a week, but it must be\r\nremembered that £60 was exactly all that Douglas Jerrold ever made out\r\nof his most popular and successful play--_Black Eyed Susan_. Those\r\nsimple souls who lament the decadence of the harlequinade will be\r\ncomforted to learn that as early as 1843 _Punch_ deplores the triumph of\r\nscenery over fun, the supersession of Grimaldi by Stanfield; and he\r\nreturns to his complaint in 1849 in \"Christmas is not what it ought to\r\nbe\":--\r\n\r\n    Pantomime's quite on the wane,\r\n      Though vainly they try to enrich it,\r\n    By calling, again and again,\r\n      For \"_Hot Codlins_\" and \"_Tippetywitchet_.\"\r\n    The stealing of poultry by clown\r\n      Has ceased irresistible sport to be,\r\n    If he swallowed a turkey it wouldn't go down;\r\n      Christmas is not what it ought to be.\r\n\r\nThe red-hot poker business has at any rate taken an unconscionably long\r\ntime in dying, and it is not dead yet. But clowns, outside pantomime,\r\nhave taken on a new lease of life thanks to Marceline and Grock. The\r\npresent writer ventures to predict wonderful possibilities for\r\nharlequinade if revived and developed on the romantic and grotesque\r\nlines of the Russian ballet, to say nothing of the opportunities which\r\nit affords for satire. The craze for child actors and marionettes in\r\n1852 led _Punch_ to bestow an ironical commendation on the latter on the\r\nground that they never squabbled in the greenroom.\r\n\r\n_Punch_ was all for clean plays, but he was no stickler for puritanism\r\nor prudery. In this same year of 1852 he indulges in well-deserved\r\nsatire on the performances in Passion week. All theatres were supposed\r\nto be shut, with the result that while the legitimate drama was\r\nsuppressed, acrobats or mountebanks of any sort could give\r\nentertainments. We may note that in 1853 _Punch_ suggested that\r\ntheatrical performances should begin at 8 instead of 7 p.m.; 6.30 p.m.\r\nis mentioned as the usual dinner hour. Besides the actors already noted\r\nCharles Mathews and Vestris, J. B. Buckstone and Paul Bedford are\r\nconstantly mentioned and in the main with good will. The feud with\r\nCharles Kean was kept up to the end; _Punch_ speaks of his \"touchiness,\"\r\nand certainly spared no means of getting him on the raw. When Kean was\r\nmade an F.S.A. in 1857 it was maliciously suggested that the initials\r\nstood for Fair Second-rate Actor. It was otherwise with Charles Kemble,\r\nthat \"first-rate actor of second-rate parts,\" as Macready styled the\r\nfather of the gifted and delightful Fanny, and Adelaide the successful\r\nopera singer. After his retirement from the stage Kemble gave readings\r\nfrom Shakespeare at Willis's Rooms and elsewhere in 1844-45, and on his\r\ndeath in 1854, _Punch_ paid him this graceful tribute:--\r\n\r\n    He linked us with a past of scenic art,\r\n      Larger and loftier than now is known;\r\n      Less mannered, it may be, our stage has grown,\r\n    Than when he played his part.\r\n\r\n    But where shall we now find, upon our scene,\r\n      The Gentleman in action, look and word,\r\n      Who wears his wit, as he would wear his sword,\r\n    As polished and as keen?\r\n\r\n    Come all who loved him: 'tis his passing bell:\r\n      Look your last look: cover the brave old face:\r\n      Kindly and gently bear him to his place--\r\n    Charles Kemble, fare thee well!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Reign of Italian Opera_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LABLACHE]\r\n\r\nA whole volume might be written on the glories, the splendours, and the\r\nabsurdities of Italian opera in the 'forties and 'fifties as revealed,\r\napplauded, and criticized in the columns of _Punch_. We say Italian\r\nopera advisedly, because the domination of Italian composers and singers\r\nand of the Italian language was as yet practically unassailed. Germany,\r\nit is true, had already begun to knock at the door. Lord Mount Edgcumbe\r\nin his _Reminiscences_ mentions the visit of a German operatic company\r\nin 1832. Staudigl, who \"created\" the title-_rôle_ in Mendelssohn's\r\n_Elijah_ when it was produced at Birmingham in 1846, is mentioned by\r\n_Punch_ as singing in opera in London in 1841. Weber's _Der Freischütz_\r\nwas given at the Haymarket in the summer of 1844. But the greater\r\nlights in the operatic firmament, judged by the test of fashionable\r\npatronage and indeed general popularity, were all Italian. The meteoric\r\nMalibran--Spanish by race but Italian in training--died suddenly and\r\ntragically in 1836, and Pasta, her great rival, withdrew from the stage\r\nshortly afterwards. The retirement of the famous tenor Rubini is\r\nmentioned in _Punch's_ first volume, but his popularity was eclipsed by\r\nthat of Mario, who reigned without a rival in virtue of his triple\r\nendowment of voice, good looks, and elegance. His triumphs were shared\r\nby Grisi, and the kings and queens of song on the lyric stage in these\r\ntwo decades were either Italians by birth--e.g., Grisi, Alboni, whom\r\n_Punch_ likens to a \"jolly blooming she-Bacchus,\" Persiani, and\r\nPiccolomini--or trained in the Italian school and distinguished by their\r\nassociation with Italian opera, such as Sontag and Jenny Lind, Duprez\r\nthe French tenor, and Lablache, who was born and bred in Italy though of\r\nFranco-Hibernian parentage, the greatest in bulk, in volume and beauty\r\nof voice, in dramatic versatility and in genial humour of all operatic\r\nbasses. So too with the composers. It was the heyday of Rossini,\r\nDonizetti, Bellini and the earlier Verdi, whom _Punch_ in 1852\r\nirreverently styles the \"crack composer\" as he cracked so many voices.\r\n_Punch_ cannot be blamed if he failed to foresee in the crude vigour of\r\n_Nabucco_ and the hectic sentimentality of _Traviata_ and _Trovatore_\r\npossibilities of that wonderful Indian summer of genius which began with\r\n_Aïda_ and culminated in _Otello_ and _Falstaff_. Michael Costa was the\r\nconductor _par excellence_, who took outrageous liberties with scores,\r\nbut was none the less a most efficient operatic drill-sergeant. Here our\r\ndebt to Italy was ingeniously expressed--though not by _Punch_--in the\r\nLatin tag: _Costam subduximus Apennino_. Balfe, it is true, had scored a\r\nresounding success in 1843 with _The Bohemian Girl_, which still holds\r\nthe boards. The fact that it is commonly known in the profession as \"The\r\nBo Girl\" is perhaps the best index to its artistic value. But Balfe was\r\nat least equally well known as a conductor of Italian opera. _Punch_\r\nsupported the claims of native and national opera, and regretted that\r\nAdelaide Kemble, \"our first English operatic singer,\" should not have\r\nmade an effort in its behalf in connexion with the venture at Drury Lane\r\nin 1841, when a Mr. Rodwell was the only native composer represented.\r\nThe reason alleged for the rejection of other English operas submitted\r\nwas the badness of the _libretti_. Italian opera _libretti_ were often\r\nsatirized by _Punch_, but those of Fitzball and Bunn were, if possible,\r\nworse.\r\n\r\nItalian opera, however, the only opera which really counted in the\r\nsocial world, was the luxury and appanage of the nobility and gentry.\r\nThe importance and significance of the institution at this time, and for\r\nmany years afterwards, are really very well summed up in an article\r\nwhich _Punch_ reproduced from the _Morning Post_ in 1843 with italics\r\nand comments of his own at the expense of \"Jenkins\":--\r\n\r\n    \"The Opera is the place of rendezvous of those persons who, _de\r\n    facto_, as well as _de jure_, are, in their several different\r\n    spheres, the leaders and models of society. It is not only to hear\r\n    an Opera which they may have seen a hundred times that the\r\n    distinguished subscribers assemble. There, most men of consequence\r\n    _literary and artistical_ (pretty egotist) as well as the noble and\r\n    fashionable, have agreed to meet during the season. There, the fair\r\n    tenants of the boxes receive those friendly and agreeable visits\r\n    which do not consist in the delivery of a _piece of engraved\r\n    postcard to a servant_. Charming _causeries_ are constantly\r\n    proceeding _sotto voce_ (of course Jenkins listens), the music\r\n    filling up the pauses of a conversation which the more often it is\r\n    interrupted by the bright efforts of the singers--with the more\r\n    zest and piquancy _it is resumed_. We, whose office it is to record\r\n    daily events--things as they are--and hold the _glass up to\r\n    fashion_ (whilst fashion arranges its evening tie) can but seek to\r\n    imitate this course of things--and we do so with only one\r\n    regret--that motives of delicacy compel us to reflect rather the\r\n    general sentiments that prevail, than those private opinions which\r\n    have most piquancy.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _\"Jenkins\" as Musical Critic_]\r\n\r\nFor sheer ecstasy of flunkeydom \"Jenkins\" was unsurpassed and\r\nunsurpassable, but at least he was capable of recognizing native talent,\r\nas may be gleaned from his notice of _Semiramide_ in English in the\r\nwinter of 1842:--\r\n\r\n    We cannot omit another little extract from a notice of\r\n    _Semiramide_:--\r\n\r\n    \"Of the gems of this sublime opera we must particularly direct\r\n    attention to Mrs. Alfred Shaw's manner and divinely expressive way\r\n    of singing her Cavatina, 'Ah! that day I well remember,' where her\r\n    sublime contralto, controlled by the most scientific skill, and\r\n    whose soft diapason tones fall like seraphs' harmony, penetrates\r\n    the heart with chastening ardour and inspiring effect. Again the\r\n    contralto and soprano duet, 'Dark days of Sorrow,' between Miss\r\n    Kemble and Mrs. Shaw; what deep pathos! what eloquence discoursing!\r\n    Mark the clear, brilliant, towering sublimity of expression as\r\n    Semiramide holds on the C in alt., while the thirds and fifths of\r\n    Assaca's deep mellow notes from D to G in a full octave and a half\r\n    are filling in a sublime harmony of melody of the most touching and\r\n    refined order.\"\r\n\r\nBut if extravagant homage was paid to the queens of song much was also\r\nexpected of them. The truth of this is seen in the episode chronicled\r\nunder the heading \"Persiani at Sea\":--\r\n\r\n    An enthusiastic audience is assembled to hurrah Persiani--to cry\r\n    _brava_--to throw bouquets, etc. The crowd open their mouths to\r\n    receive the honeyed voice of a _prima donna_, and Doctor Wardrop\r\n    throws blue pills into them. The following notice proves the truth\r\n    of our metaphor:--\r\n\r\n    \"Madame Persiani continues to _suffer so severely from the effects\r\n    of sea-sickness, accompanied with violent retching_, that it is\r\n    impossible for her to appear this evening.\r\n\r\n\"JAMES WARDROP, M.D.\"\r\n\r\n    On this, says _The Times_, \"the audience were at first disposed to\r\n    grumble, and gave many signs of dissatisfaction.\"\r\n\r\n    The audience were perfectly right. They were justified in becoming\r\n    very savage at the violent retching of a sea-sick St. Cecilia; and\r\n    had she had the effrontery to die, they would, we are convinced,\r\n    have been perfectly exonerated, by all the laws of English freedom,\r\n    in breaking the chandeliers and tearing up the benches!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SKATING BALLET]\r\n\r\nThe private life of operatic celebrities was as a rule no concern of the\r\nopera-going public, but the line was drawn at Lola Montez, whose\r\nengagement to dance at Drury Lane in 1843 was cancelled in deference to\r\ngeneral protests. The ballet was an integral part and commanding\r\nattraction of the old Italian opera. The most wonderful account of this\r\n\"explosion of all the upholsteries\" has been given by Carlyle at a\r\nslightly later date. In the 'forties the shining lights were\r\nTaglioni--whose skirts were quite long--Cerito, Fanny Ellsler and\r\nCarlotta Grisi, cousin of the _prima donna_, a wonderful quartet on\r\nwhose gyrations and levitations \"Jenkins\" showered all the adulatory\r\nepithets in his polyglot vocabulary. The skating ballet in _Le\r\nProphète_, popular in 1849, is the subject of a charming little sketch\r\nin _Punch_, and this production was notable vocally for the appearance\r\nof Pauline Viardot-Garcia, the greatest actress, the most accomplished\r\nand enlightened musician, and the most interesting personality of all\r\nnineteenth century _prime donne_. Henriette Sontag, however, was the\r\npopular operatic heroine of the year, graceful, charming and still\r\nhandsome, though no longer in her first youth,[31] a perfect singer, an\r\nincomparable _Susanna_ (as _Punch_ admitted), though lacking dramatic\r\nforce--Sontag, of whom Catalani said that she was the first in her\r\n_genre_, but that her _genre_ was not the first.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jenny Lind]\r\n\r\nGreat singers came and went but _Punch_ never wavered in his allegiance\r\nto Jenny Lind. Though her career on the lyric stage was brief, she is\r\nmore often and more enthusiastically mentioned than any other singer,\r\nand for reasons which are revealed in the following lines:--\r\n\r\nTHE NIGHTINGALE THAT SINGS IN THE WINTER\r\n\r\n    Sweetest creature, in song without rival or peer,\r\n    Far more inwardly vibrate thy notes than the ear,\r\n    For there speaks in that music, pure, gentle, refined,\r\n    The exquisite voice of a beautiful mind--\r\n\r\n    Of a spirit of earnestness, goodness and truth,\r\n    Of a heart full of tender compassion and ruth,\r\n    Ever ready to comfort, and succour, and bless,\r\n    In sorrow and suffering, in want and distress.\r\n\r\n    Now this Nightingale rare, in the winter who sings,\r\n    Being not yet a seraph, is one without wings;\r\n    And her name, which has travelled as wide as the wind,\r\n    Is kind-hearted, generous, dear JENNY LIND.\r\n\r\nWhen her retirement was rumoured _Punch_ declared that the Bishop of\r\nNorwich should rather persuade her to remain on the stage than quit it,\r\nbecause of her example. Reports of her engagement to a Mr. Harris\r\nprompted the remark that \"the people would never permit it.\" Indeed\r\nthere were some persons as sceptical of his existence as Mrs. Gamp was\r\nof his female namesake. Her last appearance was in May, 1849, to assist\r\nLumley, the unlucky _impresario_, then in difficulties, in response to\r\nappeals which were especially vehement in _Punch_. He asserted that her\r\nsecession was a national calamity: she \"made the stage better without\r\nmaking herself worse\"; and Mozart's aid was invoked in an imaginary\r\naddress from the composer of _Don Giovanni_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: She had already been twenty-five years on the stage and\r\nwas a link with Beethoven, having sung the soprano part in both the\r\nNinth Symphony and the Mass in D at the historic production of these\r\ngreat works in Vienna in 1824. Lablache's generous homage to Beethoven's\r\ngenius on the occasion of his funeral is too well known to need more\r\nthan a passing word of grateful recognition.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TO JENNY LIND\r\n\r\nFROM PUNCH]\r\n\r\nThe engagement to Mr. Harris was \"declared off\" immediately afterwards,\r\nbut Jenny Lind, in spite of _Punch's_ repeated appeals, adhered to her\r\ndecision to quit the stage. As late as 1856 _Punch_ still hoped she\r\nwould reconsider her verdict, and her farewell concerts at Exeter Hall\r\nin the summer of that year inspired the characteristic remark that \"if\r\nany sweetening process could purify the building it would be such\r\nsinging as hers.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Popular Favourites in 1844_]\r\n\r\nIn the early 'forties _Norma_ was the opera most frequently mentioned.\r\n_Punch_ published the stories of several of the most popular operas in\r\nverse. A fragment from _Linda di Chamouni_ may suffice:--\r\n\r\n    Then Mario warbles a beautiful bar\r\n    About the revenge of his cruel mamma,\r\n    Who, finding to Linda his faith has been plighted,\r\n    Resolves to another to get him united:\r\n    He curses his fate in a charming _falsetto_,\r\n    Gives way to despair in a _voce di petto_.\r\n    And, rather than grief in his bosom should fester,\r\n    He calls out for death in a _voce di testa_:\r\n    Of life his farewell he seems willing to take,\r\n    And gives on _addio_ a delicate shake.\r\n    The passage is managed with exquisite skill;\r\n    And Linda--acquainted with Mario's trill--\r\n    Lets him hold it as long as he's able to do,\r\n    Awaiting its finish to take for her cue.\r\n\r\nOpera singers were great public favourites, but if _Punch_ is to be\r\nbelieved they did not stand first. In a list of the great features of\r\nthe season of 1844 he puts the Polka and Tom Thumb first, followed by\r\nCerito (the dancer), Grisi, Mario, Persiani, Lablache and the Ojibbeway\r\nIndians, who were \"horrid but interesting.\" The ways and personalities\r\nof the operatic stars are genially hit off in an article on \"the\r\nMigration of the Italian Singing Birds.\" It is pleasant to find\r\nLablache--Stentor and male Siren in one--put first as a bird unrivalled\r\nfor the combined power and richness of his song. \"He is a bird that can\r\nsing, and will sing, never requiring any compulsion to make him sing.\"\r\n_Punch_ alludes to his genial disposition, his magnanimity in\r\nundertaking small parts to secure a perfect ensemble, but omits to\r\nmention his humour. Lablache was once living in the same house with Tom\r\nThumb, and a stranger who came to visit the \"General\" strayed into\r\nLablache's room. Aghast at the bulk of the inmate the visitor explained\r\n\"I thought Tom Thumb lived here.\" \"Yes,\" said Lablache, \"but when I am\r\nat home I take it easy.\" Lablache had as much brains as body, and\r\nelsewhere _Punch_ happily quotes in his praise the line of Virgil:\r\n_ingentes animos ingenti in pectore versat_. The notices of Grisi and\r\nMario are worth transcribing:--\r\n\r\n\"THE GRISI\"\r\n\r\n    Among Italian singing birds the female is equally musical, to say\r\n    the least, with the male. The song of the Grisi is remarkable for\r\n    its variety, strength and sweetness. The habits of the Grisi, from\r\n    what we have been enabled to glean respecting them, seem to be\r\n    those of a bird that continues, in a considerable measure, to enjoy\r\n    its own existence. Whether rising with the lark is one of them, or\r\n    not, we do not know, but we are certain that singing with it is;\r\n    for the Grisi may undoubtedly be said to vie with the lark, or even\r\n    the nightingale, in singing. The Grisi is evidently a bird of a\r\n    kind disposition, and susceptible of affection and attachment; but\r\n    we should conjecture that she would be apt to peck if ruffled. The\r\n    kind of food best adapted for this very fascinating songstress is\r\n    to be obtained at M. Verrey's.\r\n\r\n\"THE MARIO\"\r\n\r\n    A very pleasant vocalist. He is now regarded as an efficient\r\n    substitute for the Rubini, to whose note, his own, in point of\r\n    quality, is somewhat similar. He differs, however, from the latter\r\n    bird, in singing, like a good bullfinch, the airs which he has\r\n    acquired without any admixture of certain \"native wood-notes wild\"\r\n    which, however well enough in their way, are no embellishment to\r\n    such music as Mozart's. We lately had the pleasure of hearing him\r\n    deliver \"Il mio tesoro\" with very commendable fidelity. He is in\r\n    the habit of being frequently encored; which is the only habit our\r\n    knowledge enables us to ascribe to him. So highly are these Italian\r\n    singing birds prized that many of them fetch, on an average, fifty\r\n    pounds a night for a mere performance. The sum that would be\r\n    required to buy one of them up altogether would be enormous.\r\n    Whether it is the length of John Bull's ears that causes him to pay\r\n    so dearly for their gratification, we do not know. Would he give as\r\n    much to relieve the national distress? Perhaps: if it were set to\r\n    music and sung at the Italian opera.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Musical Grab_]\r\n\r\nThe last lines of this passage lend point to a sardonic remark in an\r\nearlier volume:--\r\n\r\n    The following extract is as honest as it is true. It is written by\r\n    Monsieur Henri Blanchard, in the _Gazette Musicale_:--\r\n\r\n    \"Are you aware,\" he asks, \"that the Italian singers, the French and\r\n    German instrumentalists, visit your shores solely for the purpose\r\n    of exercising that spirit of commerce which presides over\r\n    everything with you, and not to ask for the opinion of Englishmen\r\n    on the subject of art? They come to make amends in Paris, as they\r\n    all say, for the trading system they have been carrying on in\r\n    England, and to spend the money which they have earned with so much\r\n    _ennui_.\"\r\n\r\n    _Punch_ begs to lay the above on the reading-desk of his gracious\r\n    mistress the Queen, and humbly prays that her Majesty will\r\n    mercifully consider the condition of the French, German and Italian\r\n    _ennuyés_--and dispense for the future with their services.\r\n\r\nThis familiar wail is repeated in 1849 when London was likened to a\r\nmusical Babel with two Italian, one German, and one French operas;\r\nHungarian, French and other foreign _prime donne_; Strauss's band and\r\nStyrian minstrels. M. Blanchard's view was further confirmed by a\r\ncurious episode worthy of note for the first introduction of the name\r\nWagner to _Punch's_ readers and indeed to the British public. It was not\r\nthe great Richard, however, but his niece Johanna, an opera singer of\r\nconsiderable repute, who was concerned. In 1852 she simultaneously\r\naccepted engagements at both opera houses, a policy which led to\r\nprotracted litigation in Chancery. Her father was so frank as to say\r\nthat \"England was worth nothing except for her money,\" and _Punch_ in\r\nhis frequent references to the incident employs the term \"Wagnerism\" to\r\nexpress the point of view of opera-singers who would not abide by their\r\ncontracts. The unfortunate Johanna, \"the wandering minstrel,\" as _Punch_\r\ncalled her, never appeared in opera in London, but apparently did sing\r\nat Court. The engagement of Richard Wagner to conduct the concerts of\r\nthe Philharmonic Society in 1855 left _Punch_ not merely cold but\r\npugnaciously antagonistic.\r\n\r\nThe \"music of the future\" prompted him to rude remarks about \"long-eared\r\nmusicians,\" and he returns to the seat of the scornful in a curt notice\r\nheaded \"NOT a Magic Minstrel\":--\r\n\r\n    Herr Wagner, Professor of the \"Music of the Future,\" appears, in\r\n    conducting at the Philharmonic, to have made strange work with the\r\n    music of all time. He alters Mozart, it appears, if not exactly as\r\n    a parish clerk once said that he had altered Haydn for the singing\r\n    gallery, yet in a manner nearly as audacious, altering \"_allegro_\"\r\n    to \"_moderato_\"; \"_andante_\" to \"_adagio_\"; \"_allegretto_\" to\r\n    \"_andante_\"; and \"_allegro_\" again to \"_prestissimo_.\" Wagner would\r\n    seem strongly to resemble his namesake in _Faust_, in the\r\n    particular wherein that _Wagner_ differs from his master--that is,\r\n    in the circumstance of being no conjuror.\r\n\r\nThe sudden disappearance of that Italianized Westphalian, the fiery\r\nCruvelli, was a nine days' wonder in the operatic world in 1854 and is\r\nduly chronicled in _Punch_. Towards the end of this period Piccolomini,\r\na singer of small calibre but attractive personality, achieved great\r\npopularity in the _rôle_ of the consumptive heroine of _La Traviata_,\r\nand _Punch_ celebrated the craze of \"Piccolomania,\" as he called it, in\r\nthe following travesty:--\r\n\r\n    Art is long and time is fleeting,\r\n      But of genius the soul,\r\n    Ordinary talent beating,\r\n      Reaches at one stride the goal.\r\n\r\n    In the operatic battle,\r\n      In the _Prima Donna's_ life\r\n    Quit the herd--the vocal cattle,\r\n      Be a Grisi in the strife.\r\n\r\n    Trust no promise, howe'er pleasant,\r\n      Not who may be, but who are;\r\n    Piccolomini at present,\r\n      Is the bright particular star.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Jullien_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JULLIEN'S DESPAIR]\r\n\r\nOutside the opera houses, music in the period under review in this\r\nvolume may be said to begin and end with Jullien, so far as _Punch_ is\r\nconcerned. Jullien is roughly handled in the very first number of\r\n_Punch_. In the autumn of 1857 satire has given place to affection and\r\ngenerous recognition. And _Punch_ was right, for underneath all his\r\nsuperficial buffooneries Jullien was a great educator and reformer. The\r\npresent writer vividly remembers an anecdote told him by the late Sir\r\nCharles Hallé in the 'eighties. After giving a description of Jullien's\r\nflamboyant attire--on one occasion he wore a shirt front embroidered\r\nwith a picture of a nymph playing a flute under a palm tree--and his\r\nhabit, after performing a solo on his golden piccolo, of flinging\r\nhimself with a _beau geste_ of exhaustion into a gorgeously upholstered\r\narmchair, Sir Charles Hallé went on to recall how Jullien had once said\r\nto him: \"To succeed in music in England, one must be either a great\r\ngenius like _you_, or a great charlatan like _me_.\" Now Jullien had been\r\na failure as a student at the Paris Conservatoire--but so had Verdi at\r\nMilan. But there is no warrant whatever for Punch's statement that he\r\nwas \"a _ci-devant_ waiter of a _quarante-sous traiteur_.\" Of the\r\ncharlatan side of Jullien, the love of noise and, again to quote\r\nCarlyle, of the \"explosion of all the upholsteries,\" _Punch_ gives a\r\ngraphic if severe picture in the verses which appear in his first\r\nnumber:--\r\n\r\nMONSIEUR JULLIEN\r\n\r\n            \"One!\"--crash!\r\n            \"Two!\"--clash!\r\n            \"Three!\"--dash!\r\n            \"Four!\"--smash!\r\n            Diminuendo,\r\n            Now crescendo:--\r\n    Thus play the furious band,\r\n    Led by the kid-gloved hand\r\n    Of Jullien--that Napoleon of quadrille,\r\n    Of Piccolo-nians shrillest of the shrill;\r\n            Perspiring raver\r\n            Over a semi-quaver;\r\n    Who tunes his pipes so well, he'll tell you that\r\n    The natural key of Johnny Bull's--A flat.\r\n\r\n    Demon of discord, with moustaches cloven--\r\n    Arch-impudent _improver_ of Beethoven--\r\n    Tricksy Professor of _charlatanerie_--\r\n    Inventor of musical artillery--\r\n    Barbarous rain and thunder maker--\r\n    Unconscionable money taker--\r\n    Travelling about both near and far,\r\n    Toll to exact at every _bar_,\r\n      What brings thee here again\r\n      To desecrate old Drury's fane?\r\n\r\n      Egregious attitudiniser!\r\n      Antic fifer! com'st to advise her\r\n    'Gainst intellect and sense to close her walls?\r\n      To raze her benches,\r\n      That Gallic wenches\r\n    Might play their brazen antics at masked balls?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Early Promenade Concerts_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"GENTS\" AT THE PROMENADE CONCERT]\r\n\r\nBut when _Punch_ assails Jullien for leaving his \"stew-pans and\r\nmeat-oven To make a fricassee of the great Beet-hoven\" and \"saucily\r\nserve Mozart with sauce-piquant,\" and bids him \"put your hat on,\r\n_coupez votre bâton, Bah, Va_!!!\"--_Punch_ was both rude and ungenerous.\r\nFrom the very first at his Concerts d'Eté and then at the Promenade\r\nConcerts, Jullien was a popularizer of good music. He gave his public\r\nwaltzes, \"Row Polkas,\" and explosive Army Quadrilles, but he also\r\nsandwiched Beethoven and Mozart between the coarser viands of his\r\nmusical _menu_. So while he was credited with the intention of bringing\r\nout _Stabat Mater_ waltzes--by no means a difficult feat with Rossini's\r\nwork--and a _Dead March_ gallopade, we must never forget that he was the\r\nfirst conductor to introduce symphonic music to the masses and the\r\nauthentic pioneer of the movement which Sir Henry Wood has carried on at\r\nthe Queen's Hall for the last twenty years and more. Modern music\r\nstrikes heavily on the naked ear, but Jullien was in the habit of\r\nreinforcing instruments of percussion with explosives, and _Punch_\r\nsuggests in 1849 that his _Concerts Monstres_ should be held on\r\nSalisbury Plain to give elbow room for his \"stunning performances.\" His\r\n_chevelure_, his waistcoats and waistbands were too conspicuous to\r\nescape _Punch's_ vigilant eye, and Jullien was no doubt content that it\r\nshould be so, for he was a master of the art of _réclame_. He is\r\nhabitually alluded to as \"the Mons,\" primarily as the diminutive for\r\n\"Monsieur,\" but mainly because he was \"the Mont Blanc of Music.\" The\r\nexcesses of Jazz Bands of to-day are foreshadowed in a description of\r\nthe \"tongs and bones\" music at the Promenade Concerts. But the author of\r\nthe notice of Jullien[32] in the D.N.B. conveys a wrong impression when\r\nhe speaks of _Punch_ as only ridiculing Jullien. Already _Punch_ had\r\nlearned to recognize his merits, and, while rebuking him for his\r\nextravagant conducting of flashy and trashy pieces, renders homage to\r\nhis reverence for good music. Thenceforward the references to \"the Mons\"\r\nare in the main friendly. The _Almanack_ for 1852 speaks of the \"Julian\r\n(Jullien) Era\" in music. Jullien's opera _Peter the Great_ is tenderly\r\nhandled in the autumn of the same year, and, when he set out for his\r\ntour in the States, _Punch_ sped the parting minstrel in some verses\r\nwhich are an admirable and faithful summary of his services to musical\r\neducation in England:--\r\n\r\nFAREWELL TO JULLIEN\r\n\r\n    Composer of _Peter the Great_,\r\n      Ere over Atlantic's broad swell\r\n    The steamer shall carry thee, proud of her freight,\r\n      Let me bid thee a hearty farewell.\r\n\r\n    With ophicleides, cymbals, and gongs\r\n      At first thou didst wisely begin,\r\n    And bang the dull ears of the popular throngs,\r\n      As though 'twere to beat music in.\r\n\r\n    With national measures of France,\r\n      With polka, with waltz, and with jig,\r\n    The \"gents\" thou excitedst to caper and dance,\r\n      As Orpheus did ox, ass, and pig.\r\n\r\n    Then, leading them on, by degrees,\r\n      To a feeling for Genius and Art,\r\n    Thou mad'st them to feel that Beethoven could please,\r\n      And that all was not \"slow\" in Mozart.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: Jullien was, we assume, a naturalized British subject,\r\nthough he appears in Larousse.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _John Hullah_]\r\n\r\nThe end of the poor \"Mons\" was pitiful. He was, when he chose to lay\r\naside his mountebankery, an excellent and inspiring conductor. But he\r\nwas hopelessly extravagant and improvident, and always in money\r\ndifficulties. In the fire which destroyed Covent Garden Theatre in 1856\r\nhe lost all his musical library and other possessions, and a disastrous\r\nventure at the Royal Surrey Gardens completed his ruin. There is no\r\n\"ridicule\" in the tribute paid to the unlucky Jullien in the autumn of\r\n1857, when _Punch_ describes him as \"a most worthy fellow, at whose\r\neccentricities I have made good fun in his days of glory, but whom I\r\nhave always recognized as a true artist and a true friend to art.\" But\r\nthings went from bad to worse with the eccentric artist, and Jullien\r\ndied bankrupt and insane in a lunatic asylum in Paris in 1860, at the\r\nage of forty-eight.\r\n\r\nAnother musical pioneer on far more orthodox lines whom _Punch_\r\nrecognized was John Hullah, whose singing classes for the people at\r\nExeter Hall in 1842 prompted the comment: \"If music for the people be a\r\nfine moral pabulum, is the drama for the people to be considered of no\r\nvalue whatever?\" More sympathetic is the reference, under the heading of\r\n\"Io Bacche,\" to the performance of Bach's Mass in B minor at one of\r\nHullah's monthly concerts in St. Martin's Hall in March, 1851. Hullah,\r\nwho devoted his life to popular instruction in vocal music, well\r\ndeserved the commendation: no fewer than 25,000 pupils passed through\r\nhis singing classes between 1840 and 1860. The standard of taste in\r\nvocal music was not high in the early 'forties: _Punch_ satirizes the\r\nprevalent sentimentality in songs by suggesting in 1842 as a title\r\n\"Brush back that briny tear.\" On the instrumental side we have to note\r\nthe entrance of the banjo in the same year. Musical eccentricities and\r\nmonstrosities are duly noted. There seems to have been a special\r\neffervescence of them in 1856, when a performer who hammered out tunes\r\non his chin, and Picco, the blind Sardinian penny whistler, enjoyed a\r\nfleeting popularity. In the same year American negro dialect ballads\r\nwere much in vogue, a tyranny from which we are not yet relieved. The\r\nconcertina became fashionable much earlier, in 1844, owing to the\r\nremarkable performances of the Italian _virtuoso_ Giulio Regondi, but\r\nis seldom heard nowadays outside of music halls. Turgenieff said that\r\nthe zither always reminded him of a Jew trying to sing through his nose.\r\nWithout going so far as that, one may say that it would be hard to carry\r\nout Sir Edward Elgar's favourite expression-mark _nobilmente_ on the\r\nconcertina. With regard to fashionable music _Punch_ complains in 1849\r\nthat execution was everything, composition little or nothing. He only\r\nanticipated the complaint of a later satirist who wrote:--\r\n\r\n    Spare, execution, spare thy victim's bones--\r\n    Composed by Mozart, decomposed by Jones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MANNERS AND CVSTOMS OF YE ENGLYSHE IN 1849\r\n\r\nA FEW FRIENDS TO TEA AND A LYTTLE MVSYCK]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _\"Punch's\" Taste in Music_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TASTE IN 1854--VILLIKINS AND HIS DINAH IN THE\r\nDRAWING-ROOM\r\n\r\nYOUNG LADY (who ought to know better): \"Now, William, you are not low\r\nenough yet. Begin again at 'he took the cold pizen.'\"]\r\n\r\nSpecimens of fashionable musical criticism have already been given under\r\nthe head of opera. _Punch_ had the root of the matter in him but was\r\nlacking in technique, and confesses himself unable to make out what a\r\ncritic meant by alluding to a new tenor's \"admirable _portamento_.\" He\r\nwas on much more sure ground when he attacked Balfe for mangling\r\nBeethoven at the Grand National Concerts at Her Majesty's Theatre in\r\n1850, when trivial rubbish was sandwiched between movements of the\r\n_Eroica_ Symphony. A second visit, however, enabled him to withdraw his\r\ncensure, as the _Eroica_ and C minor Symphonies were performed without\r\nbeing cut in two. _Punch_ had \"no use for\" Wagner, as we have seen, but\r\nhe fully appreciated his romantic forerunner Weber; his salutation of\r\nSpohr and Hummel as classics was perhaps a trifle premature. The names\r\nof the various musical celebrities who figure in the pages of _Punch_ in\r\nthis period afford a striking illustration of the transitoriness of the\r\nfame of the executant. Who but experts in musical biography know of\r\nSivori and Ole Bull now? Even the laurels of the great Thalberg, the\r\nmost \"gentlemanly\" of all the great pianists, author of the most\r\nfashionable variations, have withered sadly in the last half century.\r\n_Punch_ does not seem to have been specially impressed by Liszt, the\r\ngreatest of them all, and misspells his name \"Listz\" on the occasion of\r\na perfunctory reference to him in 1843. The favourite composers of\r\nwaltzes were Strauss, the founder of the dynasty of the Viennese\r\nwaltz-kings, and Labitzky. To the present generation the name Strauss\r\nhas totally different associations; and we live so fast that an\r\nenlightened writer has recently declared that the once redoubtable\r\nRichard is also dead. It would be an overstatement to say that\r\nconductors were of no account in the 'forties and 'fifties, in view of\r\nthe notoriety of Jullien and the prestige of Costa, who was both an\r\nautocrat and a martinet, but they did not loom nearly so large in the\r\npublic eye as the great singers. The balance of repute has long since\r\nbeen decisively redressed and the popular conductor of to-day has no\r\nreason to complain of lack of homage, whether in the form of applause or\r\nofficial recognition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Turner as Painter and Poet_]\r\n\r\nThe low opinion which _Punch_ entertained of contemporary architects and\r\nsculptors and of their ability to design or execute a public building, a\r\nmonument, or a memorial, has been noted in our brief survey of London.\r\nHe made an exception in favour of Paxton, but does not seem to have\r\nrecognized the genius of Alfred Stevens, and here at any rate was not in\r\nadvance of public or expert opinion of the time. Stevens's design for\r\nthe Wellington monument was only placed sixth in order of merit by the\r\nadjudicators of the competition in 1857, and though ultimately the\r\nexecution of the monument was entrusted to him, it was not placed in the\r\nposition intended for it till twenty-seven years after his death. As a\r\njudge of painting and painters _Punch_ showed greater independence,\r\nintelligence and enlightenment. His earlier volumes abound in references\r\nto forgotten names, but he was at least no indiscriminate worshipper of\r\nestablished reputation. In a notice of the Suffolk Street Gallery in the\r\nautumn of 1841 he prints a most trenchant criticism of Maclise's\r\n\"Sleeping Beauty\" as showing \"a disdain for both law and reason and\r\navoiding an approximation to the vulgarity of flesh and blood in his\r\nrepresentation of humanity.\" Landseer falls under his lash for his\r\n\"courtier pictures\" at the R.A. in 1844, and in the same article we find\r\nthe first of many satirical references to Turner's poetic titles.\r\n_Punch_, we regret to say, wholly failed to recognize that a bad poet\r\nmight be a very great painter. In his \"Scamper through the Academy\" we\r\nread:--\r\n\r\n    No. 77 is called _Whalers_, by J. M. W. Turner, R.A., and embodies\r\n    one of those singular effects which are only met with in lobster\r\n    salads, and in this artist's pictures. Whether he calls his\r\n    pictures _Whalers_, or _Venice_, or _Morning_, or _Noon_, or\r\n    _Night_, it is all the same; for it is quite as easy to fancy it\r\n    one thing as another. We give here two subjects by this celebrated\r\n    artist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VENICE BY DAYLIGHT,--RETURNING FROM THE BALL\r\n\r\nMS. \"Fallacies of Hope\" (An Unpublished Poem).--TURNER.]\r\n\r\nAnd again:--\r\n\r\n    We had almost forgotten Mr. J. M. W. Turner, R.A., and his\r\n    celebrated MS. poem, the _Fallacies of Hope_, to which he\r\n    constantly refers us as \"in former years,\" but on this occasion he\r\n    has obliged us by simply mentioning the title of the poem, without\r\n    troubling us with an extract. We will, however, supply a motto to\r\n    his _Morning--returning from the Ball_, which really seems to need\r\n    a little explanation; and as he is too modest to quote the\r\n    _Fallacies of Hope_, we will quote it for him:\r\n\r\n    \"Oh! what a scene!--Can this be Venice? No.\r\n    And yet methinks it is--because I see\r\n    Amid the lumps of yellow, red and blue,\r\n    Something which looks like a Venetian spire.\r\n    That dash of orange in the background there\r\n    Bespeaks 'tis Morning! And that little boat\r\n    (Almost the colour of tomato sauce)\r\n    Proclaims them now returning from the ball!\r\n    This in my picture, I would fain convey,\r\n    I hope I do. Alas! _what_ FALLACY!\"\r\n\r\nBut there is some good \"horse sense\" mixed up with frivolity in an\r\narticle on the canons of criticism a few pages later:--\r\n\r\n    GENERAL MAXIMS\r\n\r\n    I. The power of criticism is a gift, and requires no previous\r\n    education.\r\n\r\n    II. The critic is greater than the artist.\r\n\r\n    III. The artist cannot know his own meaning. The critic's office is\r\n    to inform him of it.\r\n\r\n    IV. Painting is a mystery. The language of pictorial criticism,\r\n    like its subject, should be mysterious and unintelligible to the\r\n    vulgar. It is a mistake to classify it as ordinary English, the\r\n    rules of which it does not recognise.\r\n\r\n    V. Approbation should be sparingly given: it should be bestowed in\r\n    preference on what the general eye condemns. The critical dignity\r\n    must never be lowered by any explanation why a work of art is good\r\n    or bad.\r\n\r\n     [Sidenote: _Rules for Art Critics_]\r\n\r\n     CHARACTERISTICS OF PARTICULAR STYLES\r\n\r\n    1. _To criticise a Picture by Turner._--Begin by protesting against\r\n    his extravagance; then go on with a \"notwithstanding.\" Combine such\r\n    phrases as \"_bathed in sunlight_,\" \"_flooded with summer glories_,\"\r\n    \"_mellow distance_,\" with a reference to his earlier pictures; and\r\n    wind up with a rapturous rhapsody on the philosophy of art.\r\n\r\n    2. _To criticise a Picture by Stanfield._--Begin by unqualified\r\n    praise; then commence detracting, first on the score of \"_sharp,\r\n    hard outline_\"; then of \"_leathery texture_\"; then of \"_scenic\r\n    effect of the figures_\"; and conclude by a wish he had never been a\r\n    scene painter.\r\n\r\n    3. _To criticise a Picture by Etty._--Begin by delirious\r\n    satisfaction with his \"_delicious carnations_\" and \"_mellow\r\n    flesh-tones_.\" Remark on the skilful arrangement of colour and\r\n    admirable composition; and finish with a regret that Etty should\r\n    content himself with merely painting from \"_the nude Academy\r\n    model_,\" without troubling himself with that for which you had just\r\n    before praised him.--N.B. Never mind the contradiction.\r\n\r\n    4. _To criticise a Picture by E. Landseer._--Here you are bound to\r\n    unqualified commendation. If the subject be Prince Albert's Hat or\r\n    the Queen's Macaw, some ingenious compliment to royal patrons is\r\n    expected.\r\n\r\n    _Punch_ will be happy to supply newspaper critics with similar\r\n    directions for \"doing\" all the principal painters in similar style.\r\n\r\n    He subjoins some masterly specimens of artistic criticism:--\r\n\r\n    The \"_facile princeps_\" of daily critics of art (he of the Post)\r\n    has the following, in a criticism of Herbert's _Gregory and\r\n    Choristers_:--\r\n\r\n    \"There is a want of _modulative melody_ in its colours and\r\n    mellowness in _its hand_ (whose?), pushed to an _outré_ simplicity\r\n    in _the plainness and ungrammatical development of its general\r\n    effect_. The handling is firm and simple, though in the drapery\r\n    occasionally too square and inflexible.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MANNERS AND CVSTOMS OF YE ENGLYSHE IN 1849\r\n\r\nYE EXHYBITYON. AT YE ROYAL ACADEMYE.]\r\n\r\nThe neglect and rough handling of the treasures of the National Gallery,\r\nwhere pictures presented to the nation were buried in a vault, is a\r\nfrequent source of indignant comment throughout this period--note for\r\nexample \"The Pictures' Petition\" in 1853. But in another sense\r\ncontemporary pictures were roughly handled by _Punch_. Thus in 1849 he\r\nputs in an effective plea for realism as against Wardour Street \"Old\r\nClo',\" and appeals to artists to \"paint human beings instead of\r\nclothes-horses.\" There is indeed a strangely familiar ring in \"Mr.\r\nPips's\" notes on the R.A. Exhibition of the year:--\r\n\r\n    \"The Exhibition at large I judge to be a very excellent middling\r\n    one, many Pictures good in their kind, but that Kind in very few\r\n    cases high. The Silks and Satins mostly painted to admiration, and\r\n    the Figures copied carefully from the Model; but this do appear too\r\n    plainly; and the action generally too much like a Scene in a Play.\"\r\n\r\nThe same complaint recurs in the following year, when _Punch_ is moved,\r\nas the result of visiting all the exhibitions then open to ask certain\r\nquestions:--\r\n\r\n    Is painting a living art in England at this moment?\r\n\r\n    Is there a nineteenth century?\r\n\r\n    Are there men and women round about us, doing, acting, suffering?\r\n\r\n    Is the subject matter of Art, clothes? Or is it men and women,\r\n    their actions, passions and sufferings?\r\n\r\n    If Art is vital, should it not somehow find food among living\r\n    events, interests, and incidents? Is our life, at this day, so\r\n    unideal, so devoid of all sensuous and outward picturesqueness and\r\n    beauty, that for subjects to paint we must needs go back to the\r\n    Guelphs and Ghibellines, or to Charles the Second, or William the\r\n    Third, or George the Second?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The P.R.B._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONVENT THOUGHTS]\r\n\r\nBut much more interesting than these generalities--sound and sensible\r\nthough they are--is the first reference to \"certain young friends of\r\nmine, calling themselves--the dear silly boys--Pre-Raphaelites\" in the\r\nsame volume. It must certainly be admitted that in his earlier\r\ncriticisms of the P.R.B.'s _Mr. Punch_ managed to dissemble his\r\naffection pretty effectively. The initial compliment in the notice of\r\n1851 is largely discounted by what follows:--\r\n\r\n    Our dear and promising young friends, the Pre-Raphaelites, deserve\r\n    especial commendation for the courage with which they have dared to\r\n    tell some most disagreeable truths on their canvases this year. Mr.\r\n    Ruskin was quite right in taking up the cudgels against _The Times_\r\n    on this matter. The pictures of the P.R.B. _are_ true, and that's\r\n    the worst of them. Nothing can be more wonderful than the truth of\r\n    Collins's representation of the _Alisma Plantago_, _except_ the\r\n    unattractiveness of the demure lady, whose botanical pursuits he\r\n    has recorded under the name of CONVENT THOUGHTS.... By the size\r\n    of the lady's head he no doubt meant to imply her vast capacity of\r\n    brains--while by the utter absence of form and limb under the robe,\r\n    he subtly conveys that she has given up all thoughts of making a\r\n    figure in the world.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Millais's \"_Mariana_ in the moated Grange\" is obviously meant\r\n    to insinuate a delicate excuse for the gentleman who wouldn't\r\n    come--and to show the world the full import of Tennyson's\r\n    description:--\r\n\r\n   _then said she, \"I am very dreary.\"_\r\n\r\n    Anything drearier than the lady, or brighter than her blue velvet\r\n    robe, it is impossible to conceive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARIANA IN THE MOATED GRANGE]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Commercialism in Art_]\r\n\r\nBut Punch _makes_ the _amende_ most handsomely in 1852:--\r\n\r\n    Before two pictures of Mr. Millais I have spent the happiest hour\r\n    that I have ever spent in the Royal Academy Exhibition. In those\r\n    two pictures [_Ophelia_ and _The Huguenot_] I find more loving\r\n    observation of Nature, more mastery in the reproduction of her\r\n    forms and colours, more insight into the sentiment of our greatest\r\n    poet, a deeper feeling of human emotion, a happier choice of a\r\n    point of interest, and a more truthful rendering of its appropriate\r\n    expression, than in all the rest of those eight hundred squares of\r\n    canvas put together.\r\n\r\nIn 1852 _Punch_ singles out, from a wilderness of niggling landscapes\r\nand highly-coloured and meretricious upholstery, Watts's \"marvellous\r\nchalk drawing of Lord John Russell.\" For the rest,\r\n\r\n    Art is more of a trade now, than it was when Raphael's studio had\r\n    no other name than _bottega_--in English, shop; and moreover, it is\r\n    an emasculate and man-milliner sort of a trade, instead of one\r\n    demanding strong brains, and a brave and believing heart. It is a\r\n    trade mainly conversant with miserable things and petty aims--with\r\n    vanity, and ostentation and vulgarity, and sensuality and\r\n    frivolity--no longer dealing with themes of prayer and praise, with\r\n    the glories of beatitude, or the horror of damnation, with the\r\n    perpetuation of family dignities and devotions, the recording of\r\n    great events, the dignifying of public and national, or the\r\n    beautifying of private and individual life. It is a trade in\r\n    ornament, and its Academy is a shop, and its Exhibition a display\r\n    of rival wares, in which the best hope and the sole aim of the many\r\n    is to catch the eye of a customer; and he who \"colours most highly,\r\n    is sure to please.\"\r\n\r\nAs a comprehensive indictment of the commercialism and triviality of\r\nVictorian art this leaves little to be desired. For an illustration of\r\n_Punch's_ altered opinion of the P.R.B.'s it may suffice to quote his\r\npalinode in 1853:--\r\n\r\n    Will you consider me ridiculous or blind when I assure you, on my\r\n    honour as a puppet and a public performer, that these young\r\n    gentlemen have written for me this year four of the sweetest and\r\n    deepest and most thoughtful books I have read since I laid down Mr.\r\n    Millais's historical romance of _The Huguenot_, last year? I am\r\n    sensible of the omniscience of the daily, and some of the weekly\r\n    papers, and I am aware that this is an opinion which should not be\r\n    breathed within ear-shot of places where they take in _The Times_,\r\n    and the _Morning Post_, and the _Examiner_. But I am a sort of\r\n    chartered libertine, and nobody will believe anything I say is\r\n    serious, so I can enjoy the luxury of saying what I feel, having no\r\n    character to keep up. Then I tell you frankly--not forgetting Edwin\r\n    Landseer's two grand cantos of his Highland Poem, _Night and\r\n    Morning by the Lochside_, or Stanfield's noble paean-picture of the\r\n    Battered Hull that carries the body of Nelson, like a Viking with\r\n    his ship for bier--not forgetting these and other picture-books\r\n    well worth reading--I tell you that Hunt's _Claudio and Isabella_\r\n    is to me _the_ book of the collection, though it records in colours\r\n    what Shakespeare has written in words; and that little, if at all\r\n    after it, comes Millais's _Order of Release_, and then the _Strayed\r\n    Sheep_ and _Proscribed Royalist_ of the same authors. I do not mean\r\n    to put either after the other, so I bracket them.\"\r\n\r\nIn accepting the principles of the P.R.B.'s _Punch_ shows all the zeal\r\nof the convert, as may be gathered from the following discourse\r\npublished shortly afterwards:--\r\n\r\n    Art must adapt itself to the conditions of the time and the life it\r\n    has to reflect.\r\n\r\n    See what follows.\r\n\r\n    If pictures are to be hung in rooms instead of churches, and public\r\n    halls and palaces, they must be small.\r\n\r\n    Work on a small scale, being meant for the satisfaction of a close\r\n    eye, must be highly finished.\r\n\r\n    These conditions did not affect the old painters and must affect\r\n    the moderns, and these conditions my young friends the\r\n    Pre-Raphaelites appear to be conscious of and to submit to, for\r\n    which I cannot blame them, but praise them rather, for wisely\r\n    recognising the necessity of adapting Art to surrounding\r\n    circumstances.\r\n\r\n    What have they recognised besides?\r\n\r\n    That the truest representation and grandest creation may and must\r\n    be combined by the great artist; that as man works in a setting of\r\n    earth and air, all the beauties and fitness of that setting must be\r\n    rendered--the more truthfully the better--and that the most\r\n    accurate rendering of these need not detract from the crowning\r\n    work--the creation of the central interest which sums itself in\r\n    human expression.\r\n\r\n    The practice of painting hitherto has seemed to challenge the\r\n    possibility of combining these two things--human expression and\r\n    accurate representation of inanimate or lower nature. These young\r\n    men take up the gauntlet, and say, \"We are prepared to do this--at\r\n    least to try and do it.\" Their first-fruits are before the world,\r\n    and already it has felt that the undertaking is new and startling\r\n    and cheerfully courageous: nay, more: that to a certain point--and\r\n    further than might be expected from such beardless champions--it\r\n    has already succeeded.\r\n\r\n    So God speed these young Luthers of the worn-out Art-faith; they\r\n    have burnt the Bull of the Painter-Popes of their time. They have\r\n    still enough work before them, such as their spiritual father\r\n    before them went through--devils of their own creating to hurl\r\n    their palettes at, and many mighty magnates to wrestle with, and\r\n    confute, and put to shame--by trust in their gospel truth that\r\n    Accurate Representation is the first requisite of Art.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Enthusiasm of a Convert]\r\n\r\nIt may be added that when French medals were conferred on English\r\nartists in 1855, _Punch_ complained that the newer school, i.e. the\r\nP.R.B.'s, had been overlooked in favour of Court painters such as\r\nLandseer. As a set-off to these examples of _Punch's_ artistic and\r\naesthetic _flair_ and enlightenment, it must be owned that in 1854 he\r\nhad expressed high praise for Frith's _Ramsgate Sands_ (which was bought\r\nby the Queen) on account of its realism. But it may be accounted to him\r\nfor righteousness that he supported Lord Stanhope's National Portrait\r\nGallery Bill in 1856, and entered a vigorous protest against the vile\r\n\"Germanism\" of the title \"Art Treasures Exhibition\" instead of\r\n\"Treasures of Art\" for the show at Manchester in 1857. The more modern\r\nand equally vile Germanism \"Concert-Direction Smith\" or whoever the\r\nmusical agent may be, has apparently been washed out by the War of 1914.\r\n\r\nWith all deductions and limitations _Punch's_ record as a critic of the\r\nfine arts acquits him handsomely of the charge of Philistinism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSONALITIES\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the period reviewed in this volume, _Punch_\r\nenumerates his special _bêtes noires_ as \"Humbug, Cant, Sleek Hypocrisy\r\nand Brazen Wrong.\" But as has already been abundantly proved, the list\r\nwould have to be considerably extended to include all the personages,\r\nnotable and notorious, who came under his lash. In earlier years he is\r\nmuch more specific. Thus in 1850 his amiable catalogue of the gentlemen\r\nand public bodies who have kindly consented to furnish him with game in\r\nthe ensuing year contains Colonel Sibthorp, the bearded reactionary who\r\nsat for Lincoln, Barry, the architect of the new Houses of Parliament,\r\nall quack-medicine vendors, tyrants and woman-floggers (the Tsar\r\nNicholas and Haynau are specially aimed at), Madame Tussaud, Lord\r\nBrougham, R.A.'s, the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's, Smithfield and all\r\nCity nuisances, and all sinecurists and pensionists. In 1852 Panizzi\r\n(for his long deferred catalogue of the British Museum of which he was\r\nChief Librarian), Cardinal Wiseman, and Lord Maidstone are added,\r\ntogether with Railway Directors, Homoeopathists and Protectionists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PEEL AS THE KNAVE OF SPADES]\r\n\r\nAmong the various devices adopted to ventilate his personal animosity\r\nmay be noted _Punch's_ list of \"desirable emigrants,\" and the ingenious\r\nsuggestion that \"Penal Statues\" should be erected to commemorate the\r\nmisdeeds of great offenders, obstructionists, bigots and anti-reformers.\r\nOf some of _Punch's_ butts it may be said that they were rescued from\r\noblivion by his satire and caricature--Sibthorp for example, though he\r\nwas by no means the merely reactionary buffoon who appears in _Punch_.\r\nHe was eccentric in dress and figure, opposed all the great measures of\r\nReform, and was the incarnation of ultra-Tory tradition. But he was\r\nfrequently witty, and as truculently courageous as _Punch_ himself. Sir\r\nPeter Laurie, Alderman and Lord Mayor of London, stood to _Punch_ for\r\nall that was pompous, officious, meddlesome and even odious in City\r\nadministration. We rub our eyes on reading in the D.N.B. that Sir Peter\r\nthroughout his public life \"devoted himself largely to schemes of social\r\nadvancement, was a good magistrate and a disciple of Joseph Hume.\" But\r\nthe explanation of this and other divergent records is simple enough.\r\n_Punch_ was often too angry or enthusiastic to be just or\r\ndiscriminating. He wrote on the spur of the moment, with the result that\r\nhe often had to revise his verdicts. We have seen this change in regard\r\nto Prince Albert, the Duke of Wellington, and Palmerston, and already\r\n_Punch_ had reluctantly begun to admit that Disraeli was a force in\r\npolitics and not a mere mountebank. The bitter attacks on Bulwer Lytton\r\nas a pinch-beck writer and padded dandy, which abound in the 'forties,\r\nended in reconciliation and amity. We have seen the process at work\r\nagain in the altered estimates of Jullien. Bunn was severely let alone,\r\nbut only when it was found that the animal, as in the French saying, was\r\nso evil as to defend himself when he was attacked. Sometimes, however,\r\n_Punch_ was implacable and impenitent. He never appears to have had a\r\nreally good word to say for Daniel O'Connell, but regarded Repeal\r\nthroughout as a fraud, and the \"Liberator\" as a self-seeking and\r\ngrasping agitator. When Dan promised in 1845 to achieve Repeal in six\r\nmonths or lay his head on the block, and did neither, _Punch_ only\r\njeered at his \"brazen boasting,\" and depicted him later on as the real\r\n\"Potato Blight\" of Ireland. Impenitence, too, marked his attitude\r\ntowards both \"Henry of Exeter\" (Dr. Phillpotts), Pusey, and Wiseman; and\r\nhis distrust of Louis Napoleon, after a brief period of reticence\r\nimposed during the Crimean War, revived in full force in the later\r\n'fifties. We have also seen the converse of the process described above\r\nin the treatment of Cobden and Bright, who were rudely hauled down from\r\ntheir pinnacles when _Punch_ the peace-loving Free Trader developed in\r\nthe Crimean War into the bellicose patriot. The change was made in the\r\ncontrary direction with Peel, but the grace of recognition was\r\ngrievously impaired by its delay. Posthumous honours are a sorry\r\nreparation for continual abuse of the living, and _Punch's_ treatment of\r\nPeel is one of the worst blots on his scutcheon. In _Punch's_ early\r\nvolumes no abuse was too bad for the Conservative statesman. Even the\r\nBible was ransacked for invidious parallels, which only stopped short of\r\nJudas. He was a \"political eel,\" a \"quack,\" a \"genius or Janus,\" and\r\nthere is a curious foreshadowing of the recriminations of our own time,\r\nin the way in which Peel, in virtue of his inveterate policy of\r\ntemporizing, is saddled with the watchword \"wait awhile.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _\"Punch's\" Injustice to Peel_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ROYAL RED RIDING HOOD]\r\n\r\nIf \"Jenkins\" was _Punch's_ \"chief butler\"--in the sense of the supreme\r\nflunkey--Lord Brougham was his chief butt throughout these years. And\r\ncertainly no public character in the nineteenth century ever played\r\nbetter into the hands of the satirist. His nose in the most literal\r\nsense lent a handle to the caricaturist. His tweed trousers figure as\r\nregularly in _Punch's_ portraits as the straw in Palmerston's\r\nmouth--which, by the way, is generally traced to a trick that \"Pam\"\r\nacquired in visiting his stables. Palmerston's nickname was \"Cupid\" from\r\nhis gallantry: the mythological parallel for Brougham would have been\r\nProteus. One of the earliest references to him in _Punch_ appears in the\r\ncomposite Preface to Vol. vi., in which each of the contributors\r\nascribes to _Punch_ his own characteristics, Brougham praising him for\r\n\"forswearing like a chameleon every shade of opinion, when for the\r\nmoment he has ceased to wear it.\" Thereafter the fun becomes fast and\r\nfurious. Brougham is charged with writing the flamboyant advertisements\r\nof George Robins, a veritable Barnum among auctioneers. His tweed\r\ntrousers are explained as a cause of his always wanting to get back to\r\nthe woolsack. He is credited, in virtue of his versatile activities,\r\nwith the attempt to discover perpetual motion. Brougham's vanity,\r\ncraving for office at all costs, meddlesomeness, and subservience to the\r\nDuke of Wellington are held up to contempt, and in \"Rational Readings\r\nfor Grown-up People\" (an early anticipation of the Missing Word\r\nCompetition) we read:--\r\n\r\n    If people may, without rebuke,\r\n    Call Wellington the \"Iron----,\"\r\n    Why then we safely may presume\r\n    The \"Brazen Peer\" to term Lord----.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUEEN CANUTE REPROVING HER COURTIERS]\r\n\r\nThe snobbishness of Brougham's arguments on behalf of royal princes in\r\nhis Debtors' Bill again infuriates the democratic _Punch_, who in 1849\r\nwas even more disgusted by Brougham's fulsome championship of Radetzky\r\nand the Austrians when they defeated the Piedmontese. But _Punch's_\r\nhostility reaches its height in the verses (accompanying a cartoon which\r\nrepresents Brougham standing on his head) describing the amazing farrago\r\nof inconsistencies which composed the mind of one who was at once a\r\ncharlatan and encyclopædist, a reformer and a courtier. In the same year\r\n_Punch_ suggests a Bill should be promoted for \"the better behaviour of\r\nthe erotic and learned lord,\"\r\n\r\n    Who'd rather mount the mountebank's stage than be laid on the shelf,\r\n    Who does with ease the difficult task of turning his back on himself.\r\n\r\nBrougham's perversely obstructive attitude towards the Exhibition of\r\n1851 excited _Punch's_ wrath, when he himself had become converted to\r\nthe scheme, but already the tone of the paper had changed; and the\r\nturning point was reached on the occasion of Brougham's visit to America\r\nin 1850, when _Punch_ printed the following unofficial letter of\r\nintroduction to the President of the United States:--\r\n\r\n    To General Taylor, President of the United States,\r\n\r\n    Favoured by Henry Lord Brougham, Member of the French Institute.\r\n\r\n    \"Dear Taylor,\r\n\r\n    \"I have much pleasure in making yourself and my friend\r\n    _Brougham_--the _Brougham_ whose fame is _not_ European but\r\n    world-wide--personally acquainted. With all his little drolleries,\r\n    he is an excellent fellow; and with all his oddities, he has worked\r\n    like a Hercules stable-boy at our Augean Courts of Law. He has\r\n    cheapened costs; he has well-nigh destroyed the race of sharp\r\n    attorneys. Indeed, if you would seek Brougham's monument, look\r\n    around every attorney's office; and you will _not_ see Brougham's\r\n    picture.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A Palinode to Brougham_]\r\n\r\n_Punch_ had already welcomed Brougham's espousal of the anti-Sabbatarian\r\ncause, but the full avowal of reconciliation is to be found in the\r\nfollowing graceful verses printed in 1851:--\r\n\r\n      A PALINODE\r\n\r\n        From _Punch_ to Henry Brougham\r\n\r\n    \"During the last five or six weeks, he had with the utmost\r\n    difficulty, and against the opinion of his medical advisers,\r\n    attended the service of their Lordships' House. During the last ten\r\n    days the difficulty had increased and become more severe. In the\r\n    hope of assisting in this great measure, in a cause to which his\r\n    life had been devoted, he had struggled to the last, until he found\r\n    he could struggle no more.\"--_Lord Brougham's last speech on Law\r\n    Reform in the House of Lords._\r\n\r\n    And is the busy brain o'erwrought at last?\r\n      Has the sharp sword fretted the sheath so far?\r\n    Then, Henry Brougham, in spite of all that's past,\r\n      Our ten long years of all but weekly war,\r\n\r\n    Let _Punch_ hold out to you a friendly hand,\r\n      And speak what haply he had left unspoken\r\n    Had the sharp tongue lost naught of its command,\r\n      That nervous frame still kept its spring unbroken.\r\n\r\n    Forgot the changes of thy later years,\r\n      No more he knows the Ishmael once he knew,\r\n    Drinking delights of battle 'mongst the Peers--\r\n      Your hand 'gainst all men, all men's hands 'gainst you.\r\n\r\n    He knows the Orator whose fearless tongue\r\n      Lashed into infamy and endless scorn\r\n    The wretches who their blackening scandal flung\r\n      Upon a Queen--of women most forlorn.\r\n\r\n    He knows the lover of his kind, who stood\r\n      Chief of the banded few who dared to brave\r\n    The accursed traffickers in negro blood,\r\n      And struck his heaviest fetter from the slave;\r\n\r\n    The Statesman who, in a less happy hour\r\n      Than this, maintained man's right to read and know,\r\n    And gave the keys of knowledge and of power\r\n      With equal hand alike to high and low;\r\n\r\n    The Lawyer who, unwarped by private aims,\r\n      Denounced the Law's abuse, chicane, delay:\r\n    The Chancellor who settled century's claims,\r\n      And swept an age's dense arrears away;\r\n\r\n    The man whose name men read even as they run,\r\n      On every landmark the world's course along,\r\n    That speaks to us of a great battle won\r\n      Over untruth, or prejudice or wrong.\r\n\r\n    Remembering this, full sad I am to hear\r\n      That voice which loudest in the combat rung\r\n    Now weak and low and sorrowful of cheer,\r\n      To see that arm of battle all unstrung.\r\n\r\n    And so, even as a warrior after fight\r\n      Thinks of a noble foe, now wounded sore,\r\n    I think of thee, and of thine ancient might,\r\n      And hold a hand out, armed for strife no more.\r\n\r\nThis is a fine summary of Brougham's services as the friend of humanity,\r\nthe champion of free speech and popular education, and the great legal\r\nreformer, erring, if at all, in the over-generous estimate of his\r\ndisinterestedness as an advocate. Brougham recovered from his breakdown\r\nand lived for seventeen years longer--years crowded with multifarious\r\nactivities, legal, scientific, literary. He was, in many ways, a unique\r\nfigure in public life, though, when the lives of the Lord Chancellors\r\nare brought up to date in the next generation, he will not be able to\r\navoid rivalry on the score of early advancement, versatility,\r\nvituperation, and vulgarity.\r\n\r\nSir James Graham is not mentioned nearly so often as Brougham, but in\r\nrespect of concentrated hostility of criticism he occupies the first\r\nplace amongst _Punch's_ pet aversions. No cartoon in this period held up\r\nany politician to greater contempt and ridicule than the repulsive\r\npicture of the Home Secretary as \"Peel's Dirty Little Boy,\" who was\r\n\"always in trouble.\" The predominating cause of _Punch's_ resentment was\r\nthe historic episode of the opening of suspect correspondence, notably\r\nthat of Mazzini; but Sir James Graham could do nothing right in\r\n_Punch's_ view: _nihil tetigit quod non foedavit_. Peter Borthwick,\r\nthe advocate of the slave-owners, M.P. for Evesham from 1835 to 1847,\r\nand editor of the _Morning Post_ from 1850 till his death in 1852, was\r\nno favourite of _Punch_. He was, however, as the date shows, not\r\neditorially responsible for \"Jenkins\"; and by introducing the Borthwick\r\nclause into the Poor Law Amendment Bill in 1847, under which married\r\ncouples over the age of sixty were not, as theretofore, separated when\r\nthey entered the poor-house, he so far expiated his pro-slavery\r\nheresies that _Punch_ granted him \"six months immunity from ridicule for\r\nthis good act.\" _Punch's_ antipathy to Urquhart is curious, for they\r\nwere united in their Russophobia. But _Punch_ was often intolerant of\r\ncompetitors, and he was never an extravagant Turcophil as Urquhart was.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _\"Punch\" Designs a Statue_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. PUNCH'S DESIGN FOR A STATUE TO MISS NIGHTINGALE]\r\n\r\nIf a paper, like a man, is to be fairly judged by its heroes and\r\nfavourites, _Punch_ emerges from the test with considerable credit. Most\r\nof them have been mentioned incidentally elsewhere, and the list[33]\r\nmight easily be added to. Let it suffice, however, to give the names of\r\nJenner, Stephenson, Rowland Hill, Paxton, Faraday, and Livingstone;\r\nMazzini and Kossuth; Jenny Lind, Florence Nightingale, and William\r\nRussell, of whose lectures _Punch_ wrote an enthusiastic and\r\nwell-merited encomium in the summer of 1857.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: It is perhaps worthy of note that with the exception of\r\nPaxton none of those mentioned belonged to the decorated or decorative\r\nclasses. Stephenson refused a knighthood in 1850; it was not bestowed on\r\nWilliam Russell till more than forty years later. Rowland Hill was made\r\na K.C.B. in 1860.]\r\n\r\n_A complete Index will be found in the Fourth Volume._\r\n\r\n                               PRINTED BY\r\n             CASSELL & COMPANY, LIMITED, LA BELLE SAUVAGE,\r\n                             LONDON, E.C.4\r\n\r\n                               F.100.521",
