The novelist\r\nhas spared no language—has minced no words—to describe the violent\r\nscenes of a violent time.\r\n\r\n\"In some instances facts appear distorted out of their true perspective,\r\nand in others the author makes unwarranted charges. It is not within our\r\nprovince to edit the historical side of Dumas, any more than it would be\r\nto correct the obvious errors in Dickens’s Child’s History of England.\r\nThe careful, mature reader, for whom the books are intended, will\r\nrecognize, and allow for, this fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe contents of these volumes of ’Celebrated Crimes’, as well as the\r\nmotives which led to their inception, are unique. They are a series of\r\nstories based upon historical records, from the pen of Alexandre Dumas,\r\npere, when he was not \"the elder,\" nor yet the author of D’Artagnan or\r\nMonte Cristo, but was a rising young dramatist and a lion in the\r\nliterary set and world of fashion.\r\n\r\nDumas, in fact, wrote his ’Crimes Celebres’ just prior to launching upon\r\nhis wonderful series of historical novels, and they may therefore be\r\nconsidered as source books, whence he was to draw so much of that\r\nfar-reaching and intimate knowledge of inner history which has\r\nperennially astonished his readers. The Crimes were published in Paris,\r\nin 1839-40, in eight volumes, comprising eighteen titles—all of which\r\nnow appear in the present carefully translated text. The success of the\r\noriginal work was instantaneous. Dumas laughingly said that he thought\r\nhe had exhausted the subject of famous crimes, until the work was off\r\nthe press, when he immediately became deluged with letters from every\r\nprovince in France, supplying him with material upon other deeds of\r\nviolence! The subjects which he has chosen, however, are of both\r\nhistoric and dramatic importance, and they have the added value of\r\ngiving the modern reader a clear picture of the state of\r\nsemi-lawlessness which existed in Europe, during the middle ages. \"The\r\nBorgias, the Cenci, Urbain Grandier, the Marchioness of Brinvilliers,\r\nthe Marchioness of Ganges, and the rest—what subjects for the pen of\r\nDumas!\" exclaims Garnett.\r\n\r\nSpace does not permit us to consider in detail the material here\r\ncollected, although each title will be found to present points of\r\nspecial interest. The first volume comprises the annals of the Borgias\r\nand the Cenci. The name of the noted and notorious Florentine family has\r\nbecome a synonym for intrigue and violence, and yet the Borgias have not\r\nbeen without stanch defenders in history.\r\n\r\nAnother famous Italian story is that of the Cenci. The beautiful\r\nBeatrice Cenci—celebrated in the painting of Guido, the sixteenth\r\ncentury romance of Guerrazi, and the poetic tragedy of Shelley, not to\r\nmention numerous succeeding works inspired by her hapless fate—will\r\nalways remain a shadowy figure and one of infinite pathos.\r\n\r\nThe second volume chronicles the sanguinary deeds in the south of\r\nFrance, carried on in the name of religion, but drenching in blood the\r\nfair country round about Avignon, for a long period of years.\r\n\r\nThe third volume is devoted to the story of Mary Queen of Scots, another\r\nwoman who suffered a violent death, and around whose name an endless\r\ncontroversy has waged. Dumas goes carefully into the dubious episodes of\r\nher stormy career, but does not allow these to blind his sympathy for\r\nher fate. Mary, it should be remembered, was closely allied to France by\r\neducation and marriage, and the French never forgave Elizabeth the part\r\nshe played in the tragedy.\r\n\r\nThe fourth volume comprises three widely dissimilar tales. One of the\r\nstrangest stories is that of Urbain Grandier, the innocent victim of a\r\ncunning and relentless religious plot. His story was dramatised by\r\nDumas, in 1850. A famous German crime is that of Karl-Ludwig Sand, whose\r\nmurder of Kotzebue, Councillor of the Russian Legation, caused an\r\ninternational upheaval which was not to subside for many years.\r\n\r\nAn especially interesting volume is number six, containing, among other\r\nmaterial, the famous \"Man in the Iron Mask.\" This unsolved puzzle of\r\nhistory was later incorporated by Dumas in one of the D’Artagnan\r\nRomances a section of the Vicomte de Bragelonne, to which it gave its\r\nname. But in this later form, the true story of this singular man doomed\r\nto wear an iron vizor over his features during his entire lifetime could\r\nonly be treated episodically. While as a special subject in the Crimes,\r\nDumas indulges his curiosity, and that of his reader, to the full.\r\nHugo’s unfinished tragedy,’Les Jumeaux’, is on the same subject; as also\r\nare others by Fournier, in French, and Zschokke, in German.\r\n\r\nOther stories can be given only passing mention. The beautiful poisoner,\r\nMarquise de Brinvilliers, must have suggested to Dumas his later\r\nportrait of Miladi, in the Three Musketeers, the mast celebrated of his\r\nwoman characters. The incredible cruelties of Ali Pacha, the Turkish\r\ndespot, should not be charged entirely to Dumas, as he is said to have\r\nbeen largely aided in this by one of his \"ghosts,\" Mallefille.\r\n\r\n\"Not a mere artist\"—writes M. de Villemessant, founder of the\r\nFigaro,—\"he has nevertheless been able to seize on those dramatic\r\neffects which have so much distinguished his theatrical career, and to\r\ngive those sharp and distinct reproductions of character which alone can\r\npresent to the reader the mind and spirit of an age. Not a mere\r\nhistorian, he has nevertheless carefully consulted the original sources\r\nof information, has weighed testimonies, elicited theories, and . . .\r\nhas interpolated the poetry of history with its most thorough prose.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*THE BORGIAS*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROLOGUE\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of April, 1492, in a bedroom of the Carneggi Palace, about\r\nthree miles from Florence, were three men grouped about a bed whereon a\r\nfourth lay dying.\r\n\r\nThe first of these three men, sitting at the foot of the bed, and half\r\nhidden, that he might conceal his tears, in the gold-brocaded curtains,\r\nwas Ermolao Barbaro, author of the treatise ’On Celibacy’, and of\r\n’Studies in Pliny’: the year before, when he was at Rome in the capacity\r\nof ambassador of the Florentine Republic, he had been appointed\r\nPatriarch of Aquileia by Innocent VIII.\r\n\r\nThe second, who was kneeling and holding one hand of the dying man\r\nbetween his own, was Angelo Poliziano, the Catullus of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, a classic of the lighter sort, who in his Latin verses might\r\nhave been mistaken for a poet of the Augustan age.\r\n\r\nThe third, who was standing up and leaning against one of the twisted\r\ncolumns of the bed-head, following with profound sadness the progress of\r\nthe malady which he read in the face of his departing friend, was the\r\nfamous Pico della Mirandola, who at the age of twenty could speak\r\ntwenty-two languages, and who had offered to reply in each of these\r\nlanguages to any seven hundred questions that might be put to him by the\r\ntwenty most learned men in the whole world, if they could be assembled\r\nat Florence.\r\n\r\nThe man on the bed was Lorenzo the Magnificent, who at the beginning of\r\nthe year had been attacked by a severe and deep-seated fever, to which\r\nwas added the gout, a hereditary ailment in his family. He had found at\r\nlast that the draughts containing dissolved pearls which the quack\r\ndoctor, Leoni di Spoleto, prescribed for him (as if he desired to adapt\r\nhis remedies rather to the riches of his patient than to his\r\nnecessities) were useless and unavailing, and so he had come to\r\nunderstand that he must part from those gentle-tongued women of his,\r\nthose sweet-voiced poets, his palaces and their rich hangings; therefore\r\nhe had summoned to give him absolution for his sins—in a man of less\r\nhigh place they might perhaps have been called crimes—the Dominican,\r\nGiralamo Francesco Savonarola.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, without an inward fear, against which the praises\r\nof his friends availed nothing, that the pleasure-seeker and usurper\r\nawaited that severe and gloomy preacher by whose word’s all Florence was\r\nstirred, and on whose pardon henceforth depended all his hope far\r\nanother world.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Savonarola was one of those men of stone, coming, like the\r\nstatue of the Commandante, to knock at the door of a Don Giovanni, and\r\nin the midst of feast and orgy to announce that it is even now the\r\nmoment to begin to think of Heaven. He had been born at Ferrara, whither\r\nhis family, one of the most illustrious of Padua, had been called by\r\nNiccolo, Marchese d’Este, and at the age of twenty-three, summoned by an\r\nirresistible vocation, had fled from his father’s house, and had taken\r\nthe vows in the cloister of Dominican monks at Florence. There, where he\r\nwas appointed by his superiors to give lessons in philosophy, the young\r\nnovice had from the first to battle against the defects of a voice that\r\nwas both harsh and weak, a defective pronunciation, and above all, the\r\ndepression of his physical powers, exhausted as they were by too severe\r\nabstinence.\r\n\r\nSavonarala from that time condemned himself to the most absolute\r\nseclusion, and disappeared in the depths of his convent, as if the slab\r\nof his tomb had already fallen over him. There, kneeling on the flags,\r\npraying unceasingly before a wooden crucifix, fevered by vigils and\r\npenances, he soon passed out of contemplation into ecstasy, and began to\r\nfeel in himself that inward prophetic impulse which summoned him to\r\npreach the reformation of the Church.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the reformation of Savonarola, more reverential than\r\nLuther’s, which followed about five-and-twenty years later, respected\r\nthe thing while attacking the man, and had as its aim the altering of\r\nteaching that was human, not faith that was of God. He did not work,\r\nlike the German monk, by reasoning, but by enthusiasm. With him logic\r\nalways gave way before inspiration: he was not a theologian, but a\r\nprophet. Yet, although hitherto he had bowed his head before the\r\nauthority of the Church, he had already raised it against the temporal\r\npower. To him religion and liberty appeared as two virgins equally\r\nsacred; so that, in his view, Lorenzo in subjugating the one was as\r\nculpable as Pope Innocent VIII in dishonouring the other. The result of\r\nthis was that, so long as Lorenzo lived in riches, happiness, and\r\nmagnificence, Savonarola had never been willing, whatever entreaties\r\nwere made, to sanction by his presence a power which he considered\r\nillegitimate. But Lorenzo on his deathbed sent for him, and that was\r\nanother matter. The austere preacher set forth at once, bareheaded and\r\nbarefoot, hoping to save not only the soul of the dying man but also the\r\nliberty of the republic.\r\n\r\nLorenzo, as we have said, was awaiting the arrival of Savonarola with an\r\nimpatience mixed with uneasiness; so that, when he heard the sound of\r\nhis steps, his pale face took a yet more deathlike tinge, while at the\r\nsame time he raised himself on his elbow and ordered his three friends\r\nto go away. They obeyed at once, and scarcely had they left by one door\r\nthan the curtain of the other was raised, and the monk, pale, immovable,\r\nsolemn, appeared on the threshold. When he perceived him, Lorenzo dei\r\nMedici, reading in his marble brow the inflexibility of a statue, fell\r\nback on his bed, breathing a sigh so profound that one might have\r\nsupposed it was his last.\r\n\r\nThe monk glanced round the room as though to assure himself that he was\r\nreally alone with the dying man; then he advanced with a slow and solemn\r\nstep towards the bed. Lorenzo watched his approach with terror; then,\r\nwhen he was close beside him, he cried:\r\n\r\n\"O my father, I have been a very great sinner!\"\r\n\r\n\"The mercy of God is infinite,\" replied the monk; \"and I come into your\r\npresence laden with the divine mercy.\"\r\n\r\n\"You believe, then, that God will forgive my sins?\" cried the dying man,\r\nrenewing his hope as he heard from the lips of the monk such unexpected\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\"Your sins and also your crimes, God will forgive them all,\" replied\r\nSavonarola. \"God will forgive your vanities, your adulterous pleasures,\r\nyour obscene festivals; so much for your sins. God will forgive you for\r\npromising two thousand florins reward to the man who should bring you\r\nthe head of Dietisalvi, Nerone Nigi, Angelo Antinori, Niccalo Soderini,\r\nand twice the money if they were handed over alive; God will forgive you\r\nfor dooming to the scaffold or the gibbet the son of Papi Orlandi,\r\nFrancesco di Brisighella, Bernardo Nardi, Jacopo Frescobaldi, Amoretto\r\nBaldovinetti, Pietro Balducci, Bernardo di Banding, Francesco\r\nFrescobaldi, and more than three hundred others whose names were none\r\nthe less dear to Florence because they were less renowned; so much for\r\nyour crimes.\" And at each of these names which Savonarala pronounced\r\nslowly, his eyes fixed on the dying man, he replied with a groan which\r\nproved the monk’s memory to be only too true. Then at last, when he had\r\nfinished, Lorenzo asked in a doubtful tone:\r\n\r\n\"Then do you believe, my father, that God will forgive me everything,\r\nboth my sins and my crimes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything,\" said Savonarola, \"but on three conditions.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are they?\" asked the dying man.\r\n\r\n\"The first,\" said Savonarola, \"is that you feel a complete faith in the\r\npower and the mercy of God.\"\r\n\r\n\"My father,\" replied Lorenzo eagerly, \"I feel this faith in the very\r\ndepths of my heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"The second,\" said Savonarola, \"is that you give back the property of\r\nothers which you have unjustly confiscated and kept.\"\r\n\r\n\"My father, shall I have time?\" asked the dying man.\r\n\r\n\"God will give it to you,\" replied the monk.\r\n\r\nLorenzo shut his eyes, as though to reflect more at his ease; then,\r\nafter a moment’s silence, he replied:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my father, I will do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The third,\" resumed Savonarola, \"is that you restore to the republic\r\nher ancient independence and her farmer liberty.\"\r\n\r\nLorenzo sat up on his bed, shaken by a convulsive movement, and\r\nquestioned with his eyes the eyes of the Dominican, as though he would\r\nfind out if he had deceived himself and not heard aright. Savonarola\r\nrepeated the same words.\r\n\r\n\"Never! never!\" exclaimed Lorenzo, falling back on his bed and shaking\r\nhis head,—\"never!\"\r\n\r\nThe monk, without replying a single word, made a step to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\"My father, my father,\" said the dying man, \"do not leave me thus: have\r\npity on me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Have pity on Florence,\" said the monk.\r\n\r\n\"But, my father,\" cried Lorenzo, \"Florence is free, Florence is happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Florence is a slave, Florence is poor,\" cried Savonarola, \"poor in\r\ngenius, poor in money, and poor in courage; poor in genius, because\r\nafter you, Lorenzo, will come your son Piero; poor in money, because\r\nfrom the funds of the republic you have kept up the magnificence of your\r\nfamily and the credit of your business houses; poor in courage, because\r\nyou have robbed the rightful magistrates of the authority which was\r\nconstitutionally theirs, and diverted the citizens from the double path\r\nof military and civil life, wherein, before they were enervated by your\r\nluxuries, they had displayed the virtues of the ancients; and therefore,\r\nwhen the day shall dawn which is not far distant,\" continued the mark,\r\nhis eyes fixed and glowing as if he were reading in the future, \"whereon\r\nthe barbarians shall descend from the mountains, the walls of our towns,\r\nlike those of Jericho, shall fall at the blast of their trumpets.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you desire that I should yield up on my deathbed the power that\r\nhas made the glory of my whole life?\" cried Lorenzo dei Medici.\r\n\r\n\"It is not I who desire it; it is the Lord,\" replied Savonarola coldly.\r\n\r\n\"Impossible, impossible!\" murmured Lorenzo.\r\n\r\n\"Very well; then die as you have lived!\" cried the monk, \"in the midst\r\nof your courtiers and flatterers; let them ruin your soul as they have\r\nruined your body!\" And at these words, the austere Dominican, without\r\nlistening to the cries of the dying man, left the room as he had entered\r\nit, with face and step unaltered; far above human things he seemed to\r\nsoar, a spirit already detached from the earth.\r\n\r\nAt the cry which broke from Lorenzo dei Medici when he saw him\r\ndisappear, Ermolao, Poliziano, and Pico delta Mirandola, who had heard\r\nall, returned into the room, and found their friend convulsively\r\nclutching in his arms a magnificent crucifix which he had just taken\r\ndown from the bed-head. In vain did they try to reassure him with\r\nfriendly words. Lorenzo the Magnificent only replied with sobs; and one\r\nhour after the scene which we have just related, his lips clinging to\r\nthe feet of the Christ, he breathed his last in the arms of these three\r\nmen, of whom the most fortunate—though all three were young—was not\r\ndestined to survive him more than two years. \"Since his death was to\r\nbring about many calamities,\" says Niccolo Macchiavelli, \"it was the\r\nwill of Heaven to show this by omens only too certain: the dome of the\r\nchurch of Santa Regarata was struck by lightning, and Roderigo Borgia\r\nwas elected pope.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the fifteenth century—that is to say, at the epoch\r\nwhen our history opens the Piazza of St. Peter’s at Rome was far from\r\npresenting so noble an aspect as that which is offered in our own day to\r\nanyone who approaches it by the Piazza dei Rusticucci.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the Basilica of Constantine existed no longer, while that of\r\nMichael Angelo, the masterpiece of thirty popes, which cost the labour\r\nof three centuries and the expense of two hundred and sixty millions,\r\nexisted not yet. The ancient edifice, which had lasted for eleven\r\nhundred and forty-five years, had been threatening to fall in about\r\n1440, and Nicholas V, artistic forerunner of Julius II and Leo X, had\r\nhad it pulled down, together with the temple of Probus Anicius which\r\nadjoined it. In their place he had had the foundations of a new temple\r\nlaid by the architects Rossellini and Battista Alberti; but some years\r\nlater, after the death of Nicholas V, Paul II, the Venetian, had not\r\nbeen able to give more than five thousand crowns to continue the project\r\nof his predecessor, and thus the building was arrested when it had\r\nscarcely risen above the ground, and presented the appearance of a\r\nstill-born edifice, even sadder than that of a ruin.\r\n\r\nAs to the piazza itself, it had not yet, as the reader will understand\r\nfrom the foregoing explanation, either the fine colonnade of Bernini, or\r\nthe dancing fountains, or that Egyptian obelisk which, according to\r\nPliny, was set up by the Pharaoh at Heliopolis, and transferred to Rome\r\nby Caligula, who set it up in Nero’s Circus, where it remained till\r\n1586. Now, as Nero’s Circus was situate on the very ground where St.\r\nPeter’s now stands, and the base of this obelisk covered the actual site\r\nwhere the vestry now is, it looked like a gigantic needle shooting up\r\nfrom the middle of truncated columns, walls of unequal height, and\r\nhalf-carved stones.\r\n\r\nOn the right of this building, a ruin from its cradle, arose the\r\nVatican, a splendid Tower of Babel, to which all the celebrated\r\narchitects of the Roman school contributed their work for a thousand\r\nyears: at this epoch the two magnificent chapels did not exist, nor the\r\ntwelve great halls, the two-and-twenty courts, the thirty staircases,\r\nand the two thousand bedchambers; for Pope Sixtus V, the sublime\r\nswineherd, who did so many things in a five years’ reign, had not yet\r\nbeen able to add the immense building which on the eastern side towers\r\nabove the court of St. Damasius; still, it was truly the old sacred\r\nedifice, with its venerable associations, in which Charlemagne received\r\nhospitality when he was crowned emperor by Pope Leo III.\r\n\r\nAll the same, on the 9th of August, 1492, the whole of Rome, from the\r\nPeople’s Gate to the Coliseum and from the Baths of Diocletian to the\r\ncastle of Sant’ Angelo, seemed to have made an appointment on this\r\npiazza: the multitude thronging it was so great as to overflow into all\r\nthe neighbouring streets, which started from this centre like the rays\r\nof a star. The crowds of people, looking like a motley moving carpet,\r\nwere climbing up into the basilica, grouping themselves upon the stones,\r\nhanging on the columns, standing up against the walls; they entered by\r\nthe doors of houses and reappeared at the windows, so numerous and so\r\ndensely packed that one might have said each window was walled up with\r\nheads. Now all this multitude had its eyes fixed on one single point in\r\nthe Vatican; for in the Vatican was the Conclave, and as Innocent VIII\r\nhad been dead for sixteen days, the Conclave was in the act of electing\r\na pope.\r\n\r\nRome is the town of elections: since her foundation down to our own\r\nday—that is to say, in the course of nearly twenty-six centuries—she has\r\nconstantly elected her kings, consuls, tribunes, emperors, and popes:\r\nthus Rome during the days of Conclave appears to be attacked by a\r\nstrange fever which drives everyone to the Vatican or to Monte Cavallo,\r\naccording as the scarlet-robed assembly is held in one or the other of\r\nthese two palaces: it is, in fact, because the raising up of a new\r\npontiff is a great event for everybody; for, according to the average\r\nestablished in the period between St. Peter and Gregory XVI, every pope\r\nlasts about eight years, and these eight years, according to the\r\ncharacter of the man who is elected, are a period either of tranquillity\r\nor of disorder, of justice or of venality, of peace or of war.\r\n\r\nNever perhaps since the day when the first successor of St. Peter took\r\nhis seat on the, pontifical throne until the interregnum which now\r\noccurred, had so great an agitation been shown as there was at this\r\nmoment, when, as we have shown, all these people were thronging on the\r\nPiazza of St. Peter and in the streets which led to it. It is true that\r\nthis was not without reason; for Innocent VIII—who was called the father\r\nof his people because he had added to his subjects eight sons and the\r\nsame number of daughters—had, as we have said, after living a life of\r\nself-indulgence, just died, after a death-struggle during which, if the\r\njournal of Stefano Infessura may be believed, two hundred and twenty\r\nmurders were committed in the streets of Rome. The authority had then\r\ndevolved in the customary way upon the Cardinal Camerlengo, who during\r\nthe interregnum had sovereign powers; but as he had been obliged to\r\nfulfil all the duties of his office—that is, to get money coined in his\r\nname and bearing his arms, to take the fisherman’s ring from the finger\r\nof the dead pope, to dress, shave and paint him, to have the corpse\r\nembalmed, to lower the coffin after nine days’ obsequies into the\r\nprovisional niche where the last deceased pope has to remain until his\r\nsuccessor comes to take his place and consign him to his final tomb;\r\nlastly, as he had been obliged to wall up the door of the Conclave and\r\nthe window of the balcony from which the pontifical election is\r\nproclaimed, he had not had a single moment for busying himself with the\r\npolice; so that the assassinations had continued in goodly fashion, and\r\nthere were loud cries for an energetic hand which should make all these\r\nswords and all these daggers retire into their sheaths.\r\n\r\nNow the eyes of this multitude were fixed, as we have said, upon the\r\nVatican, and particularly upon one chimney, from which would come the\r\nfirst signal, when suddenly, at the moment of the ’Ave Maria’—that is to\r\nsay, at the hour when the day begins to decline—great cries went up from\r\nall the crowd mixed with bursts of laughter, a discordant murmur of\r\nthreats and raillery, the cause being that they had just perceived at\r\nthe top of the chimney a thin smoke, which seemed like a light cloud to\r\ngo up perpendicularly into the sky. This smoke announced that Rome was\r\nstill without a master, and that the world still had no pope; for this\r\nwas the smoke of the voting tickets which were being burned, a proof\r\nthat the cardinals had not yet come to an agreement.\r\n\r\nScarcely had this smoke appeared, to vanish almost immediately, when all\r\nthe innumerable crowd, knowing well that there was nothing else to wait\r\nfor, and that all was said and done until ten o’clock the next morning,\r\nthe time when the cardinals had their first voting, went off in a tumult\r\nof noisy joking, just as they would after the last rocket of a firework\r\ndisplay; so that at the end of one minute nobody was there where a\r\nquarter of an hour before there had been an excited crowd, except a few\r\ncurious laggards, who, living in the neighbourhood or on the very piazza\r\nitself; were less in a hurry than the rest to get back to their homes;\r\nagain, little by little, these last groups insensibly diminished; for\r\nhalf-past nine had just struck, and at this hour the streets of Rome\r\nbegan already to be far from safe; then after these groups followed some\r\nsolitary passer-by, hurrying his steps; one after another the doors were\r\nclosed, one after another the windows were darkened; at last, when ten\r\no’clock struck, with the single exception of one window in the Vatican\r\nwhere a lamp might be seen keeping obstinate vigil, all the houses,\r\npiazzas, and streets were plunged in the deepest obscurity.\r\n\r\nAt this moment a man wrapped in a cloak stood up like a ghost against\r\none of the columns of the uncompleted basilica, and gliding slowly and\r\ncarefully among the stones which were lying about round the foundations\r\nof the new church, advanced as far as the fountain which, formed the\r\ncentre of the piazza, erected in the very place where the obelisk is now\r\nset up of which we have spoken already; when he reached this spot he\r\nstopped, doubly concealed by the darkness of the night and by the shade\r\nof the monument, and after looking around him to see if he were really\r\nalone, drew his sword, and with its point rapping three times on the\r\npavement of the piazza, each time made the sparks fly. This signal, for\r\nsignal it was, was not lost: the last lamp which still kept vigil in the\r\nVatican went out, and at the same instant an object thrown out of the\r\nwindow fell a few paces off from the young man in the cloak: he, guided\r\nby the silvery sound it had made in touching the flags, lost no time in\r\nlaying his hands upon it in spite of the darkness, and when he had it in\r\nhis possession hurried quickly away.\r\n\r\nThus the unknown walked without turning round half-way along the Borgo\r\nVecchio; but there he turned to the right and took a street at the other\r\nend of which was set up a Madonna with a lamp: he approached the light,\r\nand drew from his pocket the object he had picked up, which was nothing\r\nelse than a Roman crown piece; but this crown unscrewed, and in a cavity\r\nhollowed in its thickness enclosed a letter, which the man to whom it\r\nwas addressed began to read at the risk of being recognised, so great\r\nwas his haste to know what it contained.\r\n\r\nWe say at the risk of being recognised, for in his eagerness the\r\nrecipient of this nocturnal missive had thrown back the hood of his\r\ncloak; and as his head was wholly within the luminous circle cast by the\r\nlamp, it was easy to distinguish in the light the head of a handsome\r\nyoung man of about five or six and twenty, dressed in a purple doublet\r\nslashed at the shoulder and elbow to let the shirt come through, and\r\nwearing on his head a cap of the same colour with a long black feather\r\nfalling to his shoulder. It is true that he did not stand there long;\r\nfor scarcely had he finished the letter, or rather the note, which he\r\nhad just received in so strange and mysterious a manner, when he\r\nreplaced it in its silver receptacle, and readjusting his cloak so as to\r\nhide all the lower part of his face, resumed his walk with a rapid step,\r\ncrossed Borgo San Spirito, and took the street of the Longara, which he\r\nfollowed as far as the church of Regina Coeli. When he arrived at this\r\nplace, he gave three rapid knocks on the door of a house of good\r\nappearance, which immediately opened; then slowly mounting the stairs he\r\nentered a room where two women were awaiting him with an impatience so\r\nunconcealed that both as they saw him exclaimed together:\r\n\r\n\"Well, Francesco, what news?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good news, my mother; good, my sister,\" replied the young man, kissing\r\nthe one and giving his hand to the other. \"Our father has gained three\r\nvotes to-day, but he still needs six to have the majority.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then is there no means of buying them?\" cried the elder of the two\r\nwomen, while the younger, instead of speaking, asked him with a look.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, my mother, certainly,\" replied the young man; \"and it is\r\njust about that that my father has been thinking. He is giving Cardinal\r\nOrsini his palace at Rome and his two castles of Monticello and Soriano;\r\nto Cardinal Colanna his abbey of Subiaca; he gives Cardinal Sant’ Angelo\r\nthe bishopric of Porto, with the furniture and cellar; to the Cardinal\r\nof Parma the town of Nepi; to the Cardinal of Genoa the church of Santa\r\nMaria-in-Via-Lata; and lastly, to Cardinal Savelli the church of Santa\r\nMaria Maggiore and the town of Civita Castellana; as to Cardinal\r\nAscanio-Sforza, he knows already that the day before yesterday we sent\r\nto his house four mules laden with silver and plate, and out of this\r\ntreasure he has engaged to give five thousand ducats to the Cardinal\r\nPatriarch of Venice.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how shall we get the others to know the intentions of Roderigo?\"\r\nasked the elder of the two women.\r\n\r\n\"My father has provided for everything, and proposes an easy method; you\r\nknow, my mother, with what sort of ceremonial the cardinals’ dinner is\r\ncarried in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, on a litter, in a large basket with the arms of the cardinal for\r\nwhom the meal is prepared.\"\r\n\r\n\"My father has bribed the bishop who examines it: to-morrow is a\r\nfeast-day; to the Cardinals Orsini, Colonna, Savelli, Sant’ Angelo, and\r\nthe Cardinals of Parma and of Genoa, chickens will be sent for hot meat,\r\nand each chicken will contain a deed of gift duly drawn up, made by me\r\nin my father’s name, of the houses, palaces, or churches which are\r\ndestined for each.\"\r\n\r\n\"Capital!\" said the elder of the two women; \"now, I am certain, all will\r\ngo well.\"\r\n\r\n\"And by the grace of God,\" added the younger, with a strangely mocking\r\nsmile, \"our father will be pope.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it will be a fine day for us!\" cried Francesco.\r\n\r\n\"And for Christendom,\" replied his sister, with a still more ironical\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n\"Lucrezia, Lucrezia,\" said the mother, \"you do not deserve the happiness\r\nwhich is coming to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does that matter, if it comes all the same? Besides, you know the\r\nproverb; mother: ’Large families are blessed of the Lord’; and still\r\nmore so our family, which is so patriarchal.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time she cast on her brother a look so wanton that the young\r\nman blushed under it: but as at the moment he had to think of other\r\nthings than his illicit loves, he ordered that four servants should be\r\nawakened; and while they were getting armed to accompany him, he drew up\r\nand signed the six deeds of gift which were to be carried the next day\r\nto the cardinals; for, not wishing to be seen at their houses, he\r\nthought he would profit by the night-time to carry them himself to\r\ncertain persons in his confidence who would have them passed in, as had\r\nbeen arranged, at the dinner-hour. Then, when the deeds were quite ready\r\nand the servants also, Francesco went out with them, leaving the two\r\nwomen to dream golden dreams of their future greatness.\r\n\r\nFrom the first dawn of day the people hurried anew, as ardent and\r\ninterested as on the evening before, to the Piazza of the Vatican,\r\nwhere; at the ordinary time, that is, at ten o’clock in the morning,—the\r\nsmoke rose again as usual, evoking laughter and murmuring, as it\r\nannounced that none of the cardinals had secured the majority. A report,\r\nhowever, began to be spread about that the chances were divided between\r\nthree candidates, who were Roderigo Borgia, Giuliano delta Rovera, and\r\nAscanio Sforza; for the people as yet knew nothing of the four mules\r\nladen with plate and silver which had been led to Sforza’s house, by\r\nreason of which he had given up his own votes to his rival. In the midst\r\nof the agitation excited in the crowd by this new report a solemn\r\nchanting was heard; it proceeded from a procession, led by the Cardinal\r\nCamerlengo, with the object of obtaining from Heaven the speedy election\r\nof a pope: this procession, starting from the church of Ara Coeli at the\r\nCapitol, was to make stations before the principal Madannas and the most\r\nfrequented churches. As soon as the silver crucifix was perceived which\r\nwent in front, the most profound silence prevailed, and everyone fell on\r\nhis knees; thus a supreme calm followed the tumult and uproar which had\r\nbeen heard a few minutes before, and which at each appearance of the\r\nsmoke had assumed a more threatening character: there was a shrewd\r\nsuspicion that the procession, as well as having a religious end in\r\nview, had a political object also, and that its influence was intended\r\nto be as great on earth as in heaven. In any case, if such had been the\r\ndesign of the Cardinal Camerlengo, he had not deceived himself, and the\r\neffect was what he desired: when the procession had gone past, the\r\nlaughing and joking continued, but the cries and threats had completely\r\nceased.\r\n\r\nThe whole day passed thus; for in Rome nobody works. You are either a\r\ncardinal or a lacquey, and you live, nobody knows how. The crowd was\r\nstill extremely numerous, when, towards two o’clock in the afternoon,\r\nanother procession, which had quite as much power of provoking noise as\r\nthe first of imposing silence, traversed in its turn the Piazza of St.\r\nPeter’s: this was the dinner procession. The people received it with the\r\nusual bursts of laughter, without suspecting, for all their irreverence,\r\nthat this procession, more efficacious than the former, had just settled\r\nthe election of the new pope.\r\n\r\nThe hour of the Ave Maria came as on the evening before; but, as on the\r\nevening before, the waiting of the whole day was lost; for, as half-past\r\neight struck, the daily smoke reappeared at the top of the chimney. But\r\nwhen at the same moment rumours which came from the inside of the\r\nVatican were spread abroad, announcing that, in all probability, the\r\nelection would take place the next day, the good people preserved their\r\npatience. Besides, it had been very hot that day, and they were so\r\nbroken with fatigue and roasted by the sun, these dwellers in shade and\r\nidleness, that they had no strength left to complain.\r\n\r\nThe morning of the next day, which was the 11th of August, 1492, arose\r\nstormy and dark; this did not hinder the multitude from thronging the\r\npiazzas, streets, doors, houses, churches. Moreover, this disposition of\r\nthe weather was a real blessing from Heaven; for if there were heat, at\r\nleast there would be no sun. Towards nine o’clock threatening\r\nstorm-clouds were heaped up over all the Trastevere; but to this crowd\r\nwhat mattered rain, lightning, or thunder? They were preoccupied with a\r\nconcern of a very different nature; they were waiting for their pope: a\r\npromise had been made them for to-day, and it could be seen by the\r\nmanner of all, that if the day should pass without any election taking\r\nplace, the end of it might very well be a riot; therefore, in proportion\r\nas the time advanced, the agitation grew greater. Nine o’clock,\r\nhalf-past nine, a quarter to ten struck, without anything happening to\r\nconfirm or destroy their hopes. At last the first stroke of ten was\r\nheard; all eyes turned towards the chimney: ten o’clock struck slowly,\r\neach stroke vibrating in the heart of the multitude. At last the tenth\r\nstroke trembled, then vanished shuddering into space, and, a great cry\r\nbreaking simultaneously frog a hundred thousand breasts followed the\r\nsilence \"Non v’e fumo! There is no smoke!\" In other words, \"We have a\r\npope.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment the rain began to fall; but no one paid any attention to\r\nit, so great were the transports of joy and impatience among all the\r\npeople. At last a little stone was detached from the walled window which\r\ngave on the balcony and upon which all eyes were fixed: a general shout\r\nsaluted its fall; little by little the aperture grew larger, and in a\r\nfew minutes it was large enough to allow a man to come out on the\r\nbalcony.\r\n\r\nThe Cardinal Ascanio Sforza appeared; but at the moment when he was on\r\nthe point of coming out, frightened by the rain and the lightning, he\r\nhesitated an instant, and finally drew back: immediately the multitude\r\nin their turn broke out like a tempest into cries, curses, howls,\r\nthreatening to tear down the Vatican and to go and seek their pope\r\nthemselves. At this noise Cardinal Sforza, more terrified by the popular\r\nstorm than by the storm in the heavens, advanced on the balcony, and\r\nbetween two thunderclaps, in a moment of silence astonishing to anyone\r\nwho had just heard the clamour that went before, made the following\r\nproclamation:\r\n\r\n\"I announce to you a great joy: the most Eminent and most Reverend\r\nSignor Roderigo Lenzuolo Borgia, Archbishop of Valencia, Cardinal-Deacon\r\nof San Nicolao-in-Carcere, Vice-Chancellor of the Church, has now been\r\nelected Pope, and has assumed the name of Alexander VI.\"\r\n\r\nThe news of this nomination was received with strange joy. Roderigo\r\nBorgia had the reputation of a dissolute man, it is true, but\r\nlibertinism had mounted the throne with Sixtus IV and Innocent VIII, so\r\nthat for the Romans there was nothing new in the singular situation of a\r\npope with a mistress and five children. The great thing for the moment\r\nwas that the power fell into strong hands; and it was more important for\r\nthe tranquillity of Rome that the new pope inherited the sword of St.\r\nPaul than that he inherited the keys of St. Peter.\r\n\r\nAnd so, in the feasts that were given on this occasion, the dominant\r\ncharacter was much more warlike than religious, and would have appeared\r\nrather to suit with the election of some young conqueror than the\r\nexaltation of an old pontiff: there was no limit to the pleasantries and\r\nprophetic epigrams on the name of Alexander, which for the second time\r\nseemed to promise the Romans the empire of the world; and the same\r\nevening, in the midst of brilliant illuminations and bonfires, which\r\nseemed to turn the town into a lake of flame, the following epigram was\r\nread, amid the acclamation of the people:\r\n\r\n    \"Rome under Caesar's rule in ancient story\r\n     At home and o'er the world victorious trod;\r\n     But Alexander still extends his glory:\r\n     Caesar was man, but Alexander God.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the new pope, scarcely had he completed the formalities of\r\netiquette which his exaltation imposed upon him, and paid to each man\r\nthe price of his simony, when from the height of the Vatican he cast his\r\neyes upon Europe, a vast political game of chess, which he cherished the\r\nhope of directing at the will of his own genius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nThe world had now arrived at one of those supreme moments of history\r\nwhen every thing is transformed between the end of one period and the\r\nbeginning of another: in the East Turkey, in the South Spain, in the\r\nWest France, and in the North German, all were going to assume, together\r\nwith the title of great Powers, that influence which they were destined\r\nto exert in the future over the secondary States. Accordingly we too,\r\nwith Alexander VI, will cast a rapid glance over them, and see what were\r\ntheir respective situations in regard to Italy, which they all coveted\r\nas a prize.\r\n\r\nConstantine, Palaeologos Dragozes, besieged by three hundred thousand\r\nTurks, after having appealed in vain for aid to the whole of\r\nChristendom, had not been willing to survive the loss of his empire, and\r\nhad been found in the midst of the dead, close to the Tophana Gate; and\r\non the 30th of May, 1453, Mahomet II had made his entry into\r\nConstantinople, where, after a reign which had earned for him the\r\nsurname of ’Fatile’, or the Conqueror, he had died leaving two sons, the\r\nelder of whom had ascended the throne under the name of Bajazet II.\r\n\r\nThe accession of the new sultan, however, had not taken place with the\r\ntranquillity which his right as elder brother and his father’s choice of\r\nhim should have promised. His younger brother, D’jem, better known under\r\nthe name of Zizimeh, had argued that whereas he was born in the\r\npurple—that is, born during the reign of Mahomet—Bajazet was born prior\r\nto his epoch, and was therefore the son of a private individual. This\r\nwas rather a poor trick; but where force is all and right is naught, it\r\nwas good enough to stir up a war. The two brothers, each at the head of\r\nan army, met accordingly in Asia in 1482. D’jem was defeated after a\r\nseven hours’ fight, and pursued by his brother, who gave him no time to\r\nrally his army: he was obliged to embark from Cilicia, and took refuge\r\nin Rhodes, where he implored the protection of the Knights of St. John.\r\nThey, not daring to give him an asylum in their island so near to Asia,\r\nsent him to France, where they had him carefully guarded in one of their\r\ncommanderies, in spite of the urgency of Cait Bey, Sultan of Egypt, who,\r\nhaving revolted against Bajazet, desired to have the young prince in his\r\narmy to give his rebellion the appearance of legitimate warfare. The\r\nsame demand, moreover, with the same political object, had been made\r\nsuccessively by Mathias Corvinus, King of Hungary, by Ferdinand, King of\r\nAragon and Sicily, and by Ferdinand, King of Naples.\r\n\r\nOn his side Bajazet, who knew all the importance of such a rival, if he\r\nonce allied himself with any one of the princes with whom he was at war,\r\nhad sent ambassadors to Charles VIII, offering, if he would consent to\r\nkeep D’jem with him, to give him a considerable pension, and to give to\r\nFrance the sovereignty of the Holy Land, so soon as Jerusalem should be\r\nconquered by the Sultan of Egypt. The King of France had accepted these\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nBut then Innocent VIII had intervened, and in his turn had claimed\r\nD’jem, ostensibly to give support by the claims of the refugee to a\r\ncrusade which he was preaching against the Turks, but in reality to\r\nappropriate the pension of 40,000 ducats to be given by Bajazet to any\r\none of the Christian princes who would undertake to be his brother’s\r\ngaoler. Charles VIII had not dared to refuse to the spiritual head of\r\nChristendom a request supported by such holy reasons; and therefore\r\nD’jem had quitted France, accompanied by the Grand Master d’Aubusson,\r\nunder whose direct charge he was; but his guardian had consented, for\r\nthe sake of a cardinal’s hat, to yield up his prisoner. Thus, on the\r\n13th of March, 1489, the unhappy young man, cynosure of so many\r\ninterested eyes, made his solemn entry into Rome, mounted on a superb\r\nhorse, clothed in a magnificent oriental costume, between the Prior of\r\nAuvergne, nephew of the Grand Master d’Aubusson, and Francesco Cibo, the\r\nson of the pope.\r\n\r\nAfter this he had remained there, and Bajazet, faithful to promises\r\nwhich it was so much his interest to fulfil, had punctually paid to the\r\nsovereign pontiff a pension of 40,000 ducats.\r\n\r\nSo much for Turkey.\r\n\r\nFerdinand and Isabella were reigning in Spain, and were laying the\r\nfoundations of that vast power which was destined, five-and-twenty years\r\nlater, to make Charles V declare that the sun never set on his\r\ndominions. In fact, these two sovereigns, on whom history has bestowed\r\nthe name of Catholic, had reconquered in succession nearly all Spain,\r\nand driven the Moors out of Granada, their last entrenchment; while two\r\nmen of genius, Bartolome Diaz and Christopher Columbus, had succeeded,\r\nmuch to the profit of Spain, the one in recovering a lost world, the\r\nother in conquering a world yet unknown. They had accordingly, thanks to\r\ntheir victories in the ancient world and their discoveries in the new,\r\nacquired an influence at the court of Rome which had never been enjoyed\r\nby any of their predecessors.\r\n\r\nSo much for Spain.\r\n\r\nIn France, Charles VIII had succeeded his father, Louis XI, on the 30th\r\nof August, 1483. Louis by dint of executions, had tranquillised his\r\nkingdom and smoothed the way for a child who ascended the throne under\r\nthe regency of a woman. And the regency had been a glorious one, and had\r\nput down the pretensions of princes of the blood, put an end to civil\r\nwars, and united to the crown all that yet remained of the great\r\nindependent fiefs. The result was that at the epoch where we now are,\r\nhere was Charles VIII, about twenty-two years of age, a prince (if we\r\nare to believe La Tremouille) little of body but great of heart; a child\r\n(if we are to believe Commines) only now making his first flight from\r\nthe nest, destitute of both sense and money, feeble in person, full of\r\nself-will, and consorting rather with fools than with the wise; lastly,\r\nif we are to believe Guicciardini, who was an Italian, might well have\r\nbrought a somewhat partial judgment to bear upon the subject, a young\r\nman of little wit concerning the actions of men, but carried away by an\r\nardent desire for rule and the acquisition of glory, a desire based far\r\nmore on his shallow character and impetuosity than on any consciousness\r\nof genius: he was an enemy to all fatigue and all business, and when he\r\ntried to give his attention to it he showed himself always totally\r\nwanting in prudence and judgment. If anything in him appeared at first\r\nsight to be worthy of praise, on a closer inspection it was found to be\r\nsomething nearer akin to vice than to virtue. He was liberal, it is\r\ntrue, but without thought, with no measure and no discrimination. He was\r\nsometimes inflexible in will; but this was through obstinacy rather than\r\na constant mind; and what his flatterers called goodness deserved far\r\nmore the name of insensibility to injuries or poverty of spirit.\r\n\r\nAs to his physical appearance, if we are to believe the same author, it\r\nwas still less admirable, and answered marvellously to his weakness of\r\nmind and character. He was small, with a large head, a short thick neck,\r\nbroad chest, and high shoulders; his thighs and legs were long and thin;\r\nand as his face also was ugly—and was only redeemed by the dignity and\r\nforce of his glance—and all his limbs were disproportionate with one\r\nanother, he had rather the appearance of a monster than a man. Such was\r\nhe whom Fortune was destined to make a conqueror, for whom Heaven was\r\nreserving more glory than he had power to carry.\r\n\r\nSo much for France.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial throne was occupied by Frederic III, who had been rightly\r\nnamed the Peaceful, not for the reason that he had always maintained\r\npeace, but because, having constantly been beaten, he had always been\r\nforced to make it. The first proof he had given of this very\r\nphilosophical forbearance was during his journey to Rome, whither he\r\nbetook himself to be consecrated. In crossing the Apennines he was\r\nattacked by brigands. They robbed him, but he made no pursuit. And so,\r\nencouraged by example and by the impunity of lesser thieves, the greater\r\nones soon took part in the robberies. Amurath seized part of Hungary.\r\nMathias Corvinus took Lower Austria, and Frederic consoled himself for\r\nthese usurpations by repeating the maxim, Forgetfulness is the best cure\r\nfor the losses we suffer. At the time we have now reached, he had just,\r\nafter a reign of fifty-three years, affianced his son Maximilian to\r\nMarie of Burgundy and had put under the ban of the Empire his\r\nson-in-law, Albert of Bavaria, who laid claim to the ownership of the\r\nTyrol. He was therefore too full of his family affairs to be troubled\r\nabout Italy. Besides, he was busy looking for a motto for the house of\r\nAustria, an occupation of the highest importance for a man of the\r\ncharacter of Frederic III. This motto, which Charles V was destined\r\nalmost to render true, was at last discovered, to the great joy of the\r\nold emperor, who, judging that he had nothing more to do on earth after\r\nhe had given this last proof of sagacity, died on the 19th of August,\r\n1493; leaving the empire to his son Maximilian.\r\n\r\nThis motto was simply founded on the five vowels, a, e, i, o, u, the\r\ninitial letters of these five words\r\n\r\n    \"AUSTRIAE EST IMPERARE ORBI UNIVERSO.\"\r\n\r\nThis means\r\n\r\n\"It is the destiny of Austria to rule over the whole world.\"\r\n\r\nSo much for Germany.\r\n\r\nNow that we have cast a glance over the four nations which were on the\r\nway, as we said before, to become European Powers, let us turn our\r\nattention to those secondary States which formed a circle more\r\ncontiguous to Rome, and whose business it was to serve as armour, so to\r\nspeak, to the spiritual queen of the world, should it please any of\r\nthese political giants whom we have described to make encroachments with\r\na view to an attack, on the seas or the mountains, the Adriatic Gulf or\r\nthe Alps, the Mediterranean or the Apennines.\r\n\r\nThese were the kingdom of Naples, the duchy of Milan, the magnificent\r\nrepublic of Florence, and the most serene republic of Venice.\r\n\r\nThe kingdom of Naples was in the hands of the old Ferdinand, whose birth\r\nwas not only illegitimate, but probably also well within the prohibited\r\ndegrees. His father, Alfonso of Aragon, received his crown from Giovanna\r\nof Naples, who had adopted him as her successor. But since, in the fear\r\nof having no heir, the queen on her deathbed had named two instead of\r\none, Alfonso had to sustain his rights against Rene. The two aspirants\r\nfor some time disputed the crown. At last the house of Aragon carried\r\nthe day over the house of Anjou, and in the course of the year 1442,\r\nAlfonso definitely secured his seat on the throne. Of this sort were the\r\nclaims of the defeated rival which we shall see Charles VIII maintaining\r\nlater on. Ferdinand had neither the courage nor the genius of his\r\nfather, and yet he triumphed over his enemies, one after another he had\r\ntwo rivals, both far superior in merit to him self. The one was his\r\nnephew, the Count of Viana, who, basing his claim on his uncle’s\r\nshameful birth, commanded the whole Aragonese party; the other was Duke\r\nJohn of Calabria, who commanded the whole Angevin party. Still he\r\nmanaged to hold the two apart, and to keep himself on the throne by dint\r\nof his prudence, which often verged upon duplicity. He had a cultivated\r\nmind, and had studied the sciences—above all, law. He was of middle\r\nheight, with a large handsome head, his brow open and admirably framed\r\nin beautiful white hair, which fell nearly down to his shoulders.\r\nMoreover, though he had rarely exercised his physical strength in arms,\r\nthis strength was so great that one day, when he happened to be on the\r\nsquare of the Mercato Nuovo at Naples, he seized by the horns a bull\r\nthat had escaped and stopped him short, in spite of all the efforts the\r\nanimal made to escape from his hands. Now the election of Alexander had\r\ncaused him great uneasiness, and in spite of his usual prudence he had\r\nnot been able to restrain himself from saying before the bearer of the\r\nnews that not only did he fail to rejoice in this election, but also\r\nthat he did not think that any Christian could rejoice in it, seeing\r\nthat Borgia, having always been a bad man, would certainly make a bad\r\npope. To this he added that, even were the choice an excellent one and\r\nsuch as would please everybody else, it would be none the less fatal to\r\nthe house of Aragon, although Roderigo was born her subject and owed to\r\nher the origin and progress of his fortunes; for wherever reasons of\r\nstate come in, the ties of blood and parentage are soon forgotten, and,\r\n’a fortiori’, relations arising from the obligations of nationality.\r\n\r\nThus, one may see that Ferdinand judged Alexander VI with his usual\r\nperspicacity; this, however, did not hinder him, as we shall soon\r\nperceive, from being the first to contract an alliance with him.\r\n\r\nThe duchy of Milan belonged nominally to John Galeazzo, grandson of\r\nFrancesco Sforza, who had seized it by violence on the 26th of February,\r\n1450, and bequeathed it to his son, Galeazzo Maria, father of the young\r\nprince now reigning; we say nominally, because the real master of the\r\nMilanese was at this period not the legitimate heir who was supposed to\r\npossess it, but his uncle Ludovico, surnamed ’il Moro’, because of the\r\nmulberry tree which he bore in his arms. After being exiled with his two\r\nbrothers, Philip who died of poison in 1479, and Ascanio who became the\r\ncardinal, he returned to Milan some days after the assassination of\r\nGaleazzo Maria, which took place on the 26th of December 1476, in St.\r\nStephen’s Church, and assumed the regency for the young duke, who at\r\nthat time was only eight years old. From now onward, even after his\r\nnephew had reached the age of two-and-twenty, Ludovico continued to\r\nrule, and according to all probabilities was destined to rule a long\r\ntime yet; for, some days after the poor young man had shown a desire to\r\ntake the reins himself, he had fallen sick, and it was said, and not in\r\na whisper, that he had taken one of those slow but mortal poisons of\r\nwhich princes made so frequent a use at this period, that, even when a\r\nmalady was natural, a cause was always sought connected with some great\r\nman’s interests. However it may have been, Ludovico had relegated his\r\nnephew, now too weak to busy himself henceforward with the affairs of\r\nhis duchy, to the castle of Pavia, where he lay and languished under the\r\neyes of his wife Isabella, daughter of King Ferdinand of Naples.\r\n\r\nAs to Ludovico, he was an ambitious man, full of courage and astuteness,\r\nfamiliar with the sword and with poison, which he used alternately,\r\naccording to the occasion, without feeling any repugnance or any\r\npredilection for either of them; but quite decided to be his nephew’s\r\nheir whether he died or lived.\r\n\r\nFlorence, although she had preserved the name of a republic, had little\r\nby little lost all her liberties, and belonged in fact, if not by right,\r\nto Piero dei Medici, to whom she had been bequeathed as a paternal\r\nlegacy by Lorenzo, as we have seen, at the risk of his soul’s salvation.\r\n\r\nThe son, unfortunately, was far from having the genius of his father: he\r\nwas handsome, it is true, whereas Lorenzo, on the contrary, was\r\nremarkably ugly; he had an agreeable, musical voice, whereas Lorenzo had\r\nalways spoken through his nose; he was instructed in Latin and Greek,\r\nhis conversation was pleasant and easy, and he improvised verses almost\r\nas well as the so-called Magnificent; but he was both ignorant of\r\npolitical affairs and haughtily insolent in his behaviour to those who\r\nhad made them their study. Added to this, he was an ardent lover of\r\npleasure, passionately addicted to women, incessantly occupied with\r\nbodily exercises that should make him shine in their eyes, above all\r\nwith tennis, a game at which he very highly excelled: he promised\r\nhimself that, when the period of mourning was fast, he would occupy the\r\nattention not only of Florence but of the whole of Italy, by the\r\nsplendour of his courts and the renown of his fetes. Piero dei Medici\r\nhad at any rate formed this plan; but Heaven decreed otherwise.\r\n\r\nAs to the most serene republic of Venice, whose doge was Agostino\r\nBarbarigo, she had attained, at the time we have reached, to her highest\r\ndegree of power and splendour. From Cadiz to the Palus Maeotis, there\r\nwas no port that was not open to her thousand ships; she possessed in\r\nItaly, beyond the coastline of the canals and the ancient duchy of\r\nVenice, the provinces of Bergamo, Brescia, Crema, Verona, Vicenza, and\r\nPadua; she owned the marches of Treviso, which comprehend the districts\r\nof Feltre, Belluno, Cadore, Polesella of Rovigo, and the principality of\r\nRavenna; she also owned the Friuli, except Aquileia; Istria, except\r\nTrieste; she owned, on the east side of the Gulf, Zara, Spalatra, and\r\nthe shore of Albania; in the Ionian Sea, the islands of Zante and Corfu;\r\nin Greece, Lepanto and Patras; in the Morea, Morone, Corone, Neapolis,\r\nand Argos; lastly, in the Archipelago, besides several little towns and\r\nstations on the coast, she owned Candia and the kingdom of Cyprus.\r\n\r\nThus from the mouth of the Po to the eastern extremity of the\r\nMediterranean, the most serene republic was mistress of the whole\r\ncoastline, and Italy and Greece seemed to be mere suburbs of Venice.\r\n\r\nIn the intervals of space left free between Naples, Milan, Florence, and\r\nVenice, petty tyrants had arisen who exercised an absolute sovereignty\r\nover their territories: thus the Colonnas were at Ostia and at Nettuna,\r\nthe Montefeltri at Urbino, the Manfredi at Faenza, the Bentivogli at\r\nBologna, the Malatesta family at Rimini, the Vitelli at Citta di\r\nCastello, the Baglioni at Perugia, the Orsini at Vicovaro, and the\r\nprinces of Este at Ferrara.\r\n\r\nFinally, in the centre of this immense circle, composed of great Powers,\r\nof secondary States, and of little tyrannies, Rome was set on high, the\r\nmost exalted, yet the weakest of all, without influence, without lands,\r\nwithout an army, without gold. It was the concern of the new pope to\r\nsecure all this: let us see, therefore, what manner of man was this\r\nAlexander VI, for undertaking and accomplishing such a project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nRODERIGO LENZUOLO was born at Valencia, in Spain, in 1430 or 1431, and\r\non his mother’s side was descended, as some writers declare, of a family\r\nof royal blood, which had cast its eyes on the tiara only after\r\ncherishing hopes of the crowns of Aragon and Valencia. Roderigo from his\r\ninfancy had shown signs of a marvellous quickness of mind, and as he\r\ngrew older he exhibited an intelligence extremely apt for the study of\r\nsciences, especially law and jurisprudence: the result was that his\r\nfirst distinctions were gained in the law, a profession wherein he soon\r\nmade a great reputation by his ability in the discussion of the most\r\nthorny cases. All the same, he was not slow to leave this career, and\r\nabandoned it quite suddenly for the military profession, which his\r\nfather had followed; but after various actions which served to display\r\nhis presence of mind and courage, he was as much disgusted with this\r\nprofession as with the other; and since it happened that at the very\r\ntime he began to feel this disgust his father died, leaving a\r\nconsiderable fortune, he resolved to do no more work, but to live\r\naccording to his own fancies and caprices. About this time he became the\r\nlover of a widow who had two daughters. The widow dying, Roderigo took\r\nthe girls under his protection, put one into a convent, and as the other\r\nwas one of the loveliest women imaginable, made her his mistress. This\r\nwas the notorious Rosa Vanozza, by whom he had five children—Francesco,\r\nCaesar, Lucrezia, and Goffredo; the name of the fifth is unknown.\r\n\r\nRoderigo, retired from public affairs, was given up entirely to the\r\naffections of a lover and a father, when he heard that his uncle, who\r\nloved him like a son, had been elected pope under the name of Calixtus\r\nIII. But the young man was at this time so much a lover that love\r\nimposed silence on ambition; and indeed he was almost terrified at the\r\nexaltation of his uncle, which was no doubt destined to force him once\r\nmore into public life. Consequently, instead of hurrying to Rome, as\r\nanyone else in his place would have done, he was content to indite to\r\nHis Holiness a letter in which he begged for the continuation of his\r\nfavours, and wished him a long and happy reign.\r\n\r\nThis reserve on the part of one of his relatives, contrasted with the\r\nambitious schemes which beset the new pope at every step, struck\r\nCalixtus III in a singular way: he knew the stuff that was in young\r\nRoderigo, and at a time when he was besieged on all sides by\r\nmediocrities, this powerful nature holding modestly aside gained new\r\ngrandeur in his eyes so he replied instantly to Roderigo that on the\r\nreceipt of his letter he must quit Spain for Italy, Valencia for Rome.\r\n\r\nThis letter uprooted Roderigo from the centre of happiness he had\r\ncreated for himself, and where he might perhaps have slumbered on like\r\nan ordinary man, if fortune had not thus interposed to drag him forcibly\r\naway. Roderigo was happy, Roderigo was rich; the evil passions which\r\nwere natural to him had been, if not extinguished,—at least lulled; he\r\nwas frightened himself at the idea of changing the quiet life he was\r\nleading for the ambitious, agitated career that was promised him; and\r\ninstead of obeying his uncle, he delayed the preparations for departure,\r\nhoping that Calixtus would forget him. It was not so: two months after\r\nhe received the letter from the pope, there arrived at Valencia a\r\nprelate from Rome, the bearer of Roderigo’s nomination to a benefice\r\nworth 20,000 ducats a year, and also a positive order to the holder of\r\nthe post to come and take possession of his charge as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nHolding back was no longer feasible: so Roderigo obeyed; but as he did\r\nnot wish to be separated from the source whence had sprung eight years\r\nof happiness, Rosa Vanozza also left Spain, and while he was going to\r\nRome, she betook herself to Venice, accompanied by two confidential\r\nservants, and under the protection of a Spanish gentleman named Manuel\r\nMelchior.\r\n\r\nFortune kept the promises she had made to Roderigo: the pope received\r\nhim as a son, and made him successively Archbishop of Valencia,\r\nCardinal-Deacon, and Vice-Chancellor. To all these favours Calixtus\r\nadded a revenue of 20,000 ducats, so that at the age of scarcely\r\nthirty-five Roderigo found himself the equal of a prince in riches and\r\npower.\r\n\r\nRoderigo had had some reluctance about accepting the cardinalship, which\r\nkept him fast at Rome, and would have preferred to be General of the\r\nChurch, a position which would have allowed him more liberty for seeing\r\nhis mistress and his family; but his uncle Calixtus made him reckon with\r\nthe possibility of being his successor some day, and from that moment\r\nthe idea of being the supreme head of kings and nations took such hold\r\nof Roderigo, that he no longer had any end in view but that which his\r\nuncle had made him entertain.\r\n\r\nFrom that day forward, there began to grow up in the young cardinal that\r\ntalent for hypocrisy which made of him the most perfect incarnation of\r\nthe devil that has perhaps ever existed; and Roderigo was no longer the\r\nsame man: with words of repentance and humility on his lips, his head\r\nbowed as though he were bearing the weight of his past sins, disparaging\r\nthe riches which he had acquired and which, according to him, were the\r\nwealth of the poor and ought to return to the poor, he passed his life\r\nin churches, monasteries, and hospitals, acquiring, his historian tells\r\nus, even in the eyes of his enemies, the reputation of a Solomon for\r\nwisdom, of a Job for patience, and of a very Moses for his promulgation\r\nof the word of God: Rosa Vanozza was the only person in the world who\r\ncould appreciate the value of this pious cardinal’s conversion.\r\n\r\nIt proved a lucky thing for Roderiga that he had assumed this pious\r\nattitude, for his protector died after a reign of three years three\r\nmonths and nineteen days, and he was now sustained by his own merit\r\nalone against the numerous enemies he had made by his rapid rise to\r\nfortune: so during the whole of the reign of Pius II he lived always\r\napart from public affairs, and only reappeared in the days of Sixtus IV,\r\nwho made him the gift of the abbacy of Subiaco, and sent him in the\r\ncapacity of ambassador to the kings of Aragon and Portugal. On his\r\nreturn, which took place during the pontificate of Innocent VIII, he\r\ndecided to fetch his family at last to Rome: thither they came, escorted\r\nby Don Manuel Melchior, who from that moment passed as the husband of\r\nRosa Vanozza, and took the name of Count Ferdinand of Castile. The\r\nCardinal Roderigo received the noble Spaniard as a countryman and a\r\nfriend; and he, who expected to lead a most retired life, engaged a\r\nhouse in the street of the Lungara, near the church of Regina Coeli, on\r\nthe banks of the Tiber. There it was that, after passing the day in\r\nprayers and pious works, Cardinal Roderigo used to repair each evening\r\nand lay aside his mask. And it was said, though nobody could prove it,\r\nthat in this house infamous scenes passed: Report said the dissipations\r\nwere of so dissolute a character that their equals had never been seen\r\nin Rome. With a view to checking the rumours that began to spread\r\nabroad, Roderigo sent Caesar to study at Pisa, and married Lucrezia to a\r\nyoung gentleman of Aragon; thus there only remained at home Rosa Vanozza\r\nand her two sons: such was the state of things when Innocent VIII died\r\nand Roderigo Borgia was proclaimed pope.\r\n\r\nWe have seen by what means the nomination was effected; and so the five\r\ncardinals who had taken no part in this simony—namely, the Cardinals of\r\nNaples, Sierra, Portugal, Santa Maria-in-Porticu, and St.\r\nPeter-in-Vinculis—protested loudly against this election, which they\r\ntreated as a piece of jobbery; but Roderigo had none the less, however\r\nit was done, secured his majority; Roderigo was none the less the two\r\nhundred and sixtieth successor of St. Peter.\r\n\r\nAlexander VI, however, though he had arrived at his object, did not dare\r\nthrow off at first the mask which the Cardinal Borgia had worn so long,\r\nalthough when he was apprised of his election he could not dissimulate\r\nhis joy; indeed, on hearing the favourable result of the scrutiny, he\r\nlifted his hands to heaven and cried, in the accents of satisfied\r\nambition, \"Am I then pope? Am I then Christ’s vicar? Am I then the\r\nkeystone of the Christian world?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, holy father,\" replied Cardinal Ascanio Sforza, the same who had\r\nsold to Roderigo the nine votes that were at his disposal at the\r\nConclave for four mules laden with silver; \"and we hope by your election\r\nto give glory to God, repose to the Church, and joy to Christendom,\r\nseeing that you have been chosen by the Almighty Himself as the most\r\nworthy among all your brethren.\"\r\n\r\nBut in the short interval occupied by this reply, the new pope had\r\nalready assumed the papal authority, and in a humble voice and with\r\nhands crossed upon his breast, he spoke:\r\n\r\n\"We hope that God will grant us His powerful aid, in spite of our\r\nweakness, and that He will do for us that which He did for the apostle\r\nwhen aforetime He put into his hands the keys of heaven and entrusted to\r\nhim the government of the Church, a government which without the aid of\r\nGod would prove too heavy a burden for mortal man; but God promised that\r\nHis Spirit should direct him; God will do the same, I trust, for us; and\r\nfor your part we fear not lest any of you fail in that holy obedience\r\nwhich is due unto the head of the Church, even as the flock of Christ\r\nwas bidden to follow the prince of the apostles.\"\r\n\r\nHaving spoken these words, Alexander donned the pontifical robes, and\r\nthrough the windows of the Vatican had strips of paper thrown out on\r\nwhich his name was written in Latin. These, blown by the wind, seemed to\r\nconvey to the whole world the news of the great event which was about to\r\nchange the face of Italy. The same day couriers started for all the\r\ncourts of Europe.\r\n\r\nCaesar Borgia learned the news of his father’s election at the\r\nUniversity of Pisa, where he was a student. His ambition had sometimes\r\ndreamed of such good fortune, yet his joy was little short of madness.\r\nHe was then a young man, about twenty-two or twenty-four years of age,\r\nskilful in all bodily exercises, and especially in fencing; he could\r\nride barebacked the most fiery steeds, could cut off the head of a bull\r\nat a single sword-stroke; moreover, he was arrogant, jealous, and\r\ninsincere. According to Tammasi, he was great among the godless, as his\r\nbrother Francesco was good among the great. As to his face, even\r\ncontemporary authors have left utterly different descriptions; for some\r\nhave painted him as a monster of ugliness, while others, on the\r\ncontrary, extol his beauty. This contradiction is due to the fact that\r\nat certain times of the year, and especially in the spring, his face was\r\ncovered with an eruption which, so long as it lasted, made him an object\r\nof horror and disgust, while all the rest of the year he was the sombre,\r\nblack-haired cavalier with pale skin and tawny beard whom Raphael shows\r\nus in the fine portrait he made of him. And historians, both chroniclers\r\nand painters, agree as to his fixed and powerful gaze, behind which\r\nburned a ceaseless flame, giving to his face something infernal and\r\nsuperhuman. Such was the man whose fortune was to fulfil all his\r\ndesires. He had taken for his motto, ’Aut Caesar, aut nihil’: Caesar or\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nCaesar posted to Rome with certain of his friends, and scarcely was he\r\nrecognised at the gates of the city when the deference shown to him gave\r\ninstant proof of the change in his fortunes: at the Vatican the respect\r\nwas twice as great; mighty men bowed down before him as before one\r\nmightier than themselves. And so, in his impatience, he stayed not to\r\nvisit his mother or any other member of his family, but went straight to\r\nthe pope to kiss his feet; and as the pope had been forewarned of his\r\ncoming, he awaited him in the midst of a brilliant and numerous\r\nassemblage of cardinals, with the three other brothers standing behind\r\nhim. His Holiness received Caesar with a gracious countenance; still, he\r\ndid not allow himself any demonstration of his paternal love, but,\r\nbending towards him, kissed him on the forehead, and inquired how he was\r\nand how he had fared on his journey. Caesar replied that he was\r\nwonderfully well, and altogether at the service of His Holiness: that,\r\nas to the journey, the trifling inconveniences and short fatigue had\r\nbeen compensated, and far more than compensated, by the joy which he\r\nfelt in being able to adore upon the papal throne a pope who was so\r\nworthy. At these words, leaving Caesar still on his knees, and reseating\r\nhimself—for he had risen from his seat to embrace him—the pope assumed a\r\ngrave and composed expression of face, and spoke as follows, loud enough\r\nto be heard by all, and slowly enough for everyone present to be able to\r\nponder and retain in his memory even the least of his words:\r\n\r\n\"We are convinced, Caesar, that you are peculiarly rejoiced in beholding\r\nus on this sublime height, so far above our deserts, whereto it has\r\npleased the Divine goodness to exalt us. This joy of yours is first of\r\nall our due because of the love we have always borne you and which we\r\nbear you still, and in the second place is prompted by your own personal\r\ninterest, since henceforth you may feel sure of receiving from our\r\npontifical hand those benefits which your own good works shall deserve.\r\nBut if your joy—and this we say to you as we have even now said to your\r\nbrothers—if your joy is founded on ought else than this, you are very\r\ngreatly mistaken, Caesar, and you will find yourself sadly deceived.\r\nPerhaps we have been ambitious—we confess this humbly before the face of\r\nall men—passionately and immoderately ambitious to attain to the dignity\r\nof sovereign pontiff, and to reach this end we have followed every path\r\nthat is open to human industry; but we have acted thus, vowing an inward\r\nvow that when once we had reached our goal, we would follow no other\r\npath but that which conduces best to the service of God and to the\r\nadvancement of the Holy See, so that the glorious memory of the deeds\r\nthat we shall do may efface the shameful recollection of the deeds we\r\nhave already done. Thus shall we, let us hope, leave to those who follow\r\nus a track where upon if they find not the footsteps of a saint, they\r\nmay at least tread in the path of a true pontiff. God, who has furthered\r\nthe means, claims at our hands the fruits, and we desire to discharge to\r\nthe full this mighty debt that we have incurred to Him; and accordingly\r\nwe refuse to arouse by any deceit the stern rigour of His judgments. One\r\nsole hindrance could have power to shake our good intentions, and that\r\nmight happen should we feel too keen an interest in your fortunes.\r\nTherefore are we armed beforehand against our love, and therefore have\r\nwe prayed to God beforehand that we stumble not because of you; for in\r\nthe path of favouritism a pope cannot slip without a fall, and cannot\r\nfall without injury and dishonour to the Holy See. Even to the end of\r\nour life we shall deplore the faults which have brought this experience\r\nhome to us; and may it please God that our uncle Calixtus of blessed\r\nmemory bear not this day in purgatory the burden of our sins, more\r\nheavy, alas, than his own! Ah, he was rich in every virtue, he was full\r\nof good intentions; but he loved too much his own people, and among them\r\nhe loved me chief. And so he suffered this love to lead him blindly\r\nastray, all this love that he bore to his kindred, who to him were too\r\ntruly flesh of his flesh, so that he heaped upon the heads of a few\r\npersons only, and those perhaps the least worthy, benefits which would\r\nmore fittingly have rewarded the deserts of many. In truth, he bestowed\r\nupon our house treasures that should never have been amassed at the\r\nexpense of the poor, or else should have been turned to a better\r\npurpose. He severed from the ecclesiastical State, already weak and\r\npoor, the duchy of Spoleto and other wealthy properties, that he might\r\nmake them fiefs to us; he confided to our weak hands the\r\nvice-chancellorship, the vice-prefecture of Rome, the generalship of the\r\nChurch, and all the other most important offices, which, instead of\r\nbeing monopolised by us, should have been conferred on those who were\r\nmost meritorious. Moreover, there were persons who were raised on our\r\nrecommendation to posts of great dignity, although they had no claims\r\nbut such as our undue partiality accorded them; others were left out\r\nwith no reason for their failure except the jealousy excited in us by\r\ntheir virtues. To rob Ferdinand of Aragon of the kingdom of Naples,\r\nCalixtus kindled a terrible war, which by a happy issue only served to\r\nincrease our fortune, and by an unfortunate issue must have brought\r\nshame and disaster upon the Holy See. Lastly, by allowing himself to be\r\ngoverned by men who sacrificed public good to their private interests,\r\nhe inflicted an injury, not only upon the pontifical throne and his own\r\nreputation, but what is far worse, far more deadly, upon his own\r\nconscience. And yet, O wise judgments of God! hard and incessantly\r\nthough he toiled to establish our fortunes, scarcely had he left empty\r\nthat supreme seat which we occupy to-day, when we were cast down from\r\nthe pinnacle whereon we had climbed, abandoned to the fury of the rabble\r\nand the vindictive hatred of the Roman barons, who chose to feel\r\noffended by our goodness to their enemies. Thus, not only, we tell you,\r\nCaesar, not only did we plunge headlong from the summit of our grandeur,\r\nlosing the worldly goods and dignities which our uncle had heaped at our\r\nfeet, but for very peril of our life we were condemned to a voluntary\r\nexile, we and our friends, and in this way only did we contrive to\r\nescape the storm which our too good fortune had stirred up against us.\r\nNow this is a plain proof that God mocks at men’s designs when they are\r\nbad ones. How great an error is it for any pope to devote more care to\r\nthe welfare of a house, which cannot last more than a few years, than to\r\nthe glory of the Church, which will last for ever! What utter folly for\r\nany public man whose position is not inherited and cannot be bequeathed\r\nto his posterity, to support the edifice of his grandeur on any other\r\nbasis than the noblest virtue practised for the general good, and to\r\nsuppose that he can ensure the continuance of his own fortune otherwise\r\nthan by taking all precautions against sudden whirlwinds which are want\r\nto arise in the midst of a calm, and to blow up the storm-clouds I mean\r\nthe host of enemies. Now any one of these enemies who does his worst can\r\ncause injuries far more powerful than any help that is at all likely to\r\ncome from a hundred friends and their lying promises. If you and your\r\nbrothers walk in the path of virtue which we shall now open for you,\r\nevery wish of your heart shall be instantly accomplished; but if you\r\ntake the other path, if you have ever hoped that our affection will wink\r\nat disorderly life, then you will very soon find out that we are truly\r\npope, Father of the Church, not father of the family; that, vicar of\r\nChrist as we are, we shall act as we deem best for Christendom, and not\r\nas you deem best for your own private good. And now that we have come to\r\na thorough understanding, Caesar, receive our pontifical blessing.\" And\r\nwith these words, Alexander VI rose up, laid his hands upon his son’s\r\nhead, for Caesar was still kneeling, and then retired into his\r\napartments, without inviting him to follow.\r\n\r\nThe young man remained awhile stupefied at this discourse, so utterly\r\nunexpected, so utterly destructive at one fell blow to his most\r\ncherished hopes. He rose giddy and staggering like a drunken man, and at\r\nonce leaving the Vatican, hurried to his mother, whom he had forgotten\r\nbefore, but sought now in his despair. Rosa Vanozza possessed all the\r\nvices and all the virtues of a Spanish courtesan; her devotion to the\r\nVirgin amounted to superstition, her fondness for her children to\r\nweakness, and her love for Roderigo to sensuality. In the depth of her\r\nheart she relied on the influence she had been able to exercise over him\r\nfor nearly thirty years; and like a snake, she knew how to envelop him\r\nin her coils when the fascination of her glance had lost its power. Rosa\r\nknew of old the profound hypocrisy of her lover, and thus she was in no\r\ndifficulty about reassuring Caesar.\r\n\r\nLucrezia was with her mother when Caesar arrived; the two young people\r\nexchanged a lover-like kiss beneath her very eyes: and before he left\r\nCaesar had made an appointment for the same evening with Lucrezia, who\r\nwas now living apart from her husband, to whom Roderigo paid a pension\r\nin her palace of the Via del Pelegrino, opposite the Campo dei Fiori,\r\nand there enjoying perfect liberty.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, at the hour fixed, Caesar appeared at Lucrezia’s; but he\r\nfound there his brother Francesco. The two young men had never been\r\nfriends. Still, as their tastes were very different, hatred with\r\nFrancesco was only the fear of the deer for the hunter; but with Caesar\r\nit was the desire for vengeance and that lust for blood which lurks\r\nperpetually in the heart of a tiger. The two brothers none the less\r\nembraced, one from general kindly feeling, the other from hypocrisy; but\r\nat first sight of one another the sentiment of a double rivalry, first\r\nin their father’s and then in their sister’s good graces, had sent the\r\nblood mantling to the cheek of Francesco, and called a deadly pallor\r\ninto Caesar’s. So the two young men sat on, each resolved not to be the\r\nfirst to leave, when all at once there was a knock at the door, and a\r\nrival was announced before whom both of them were bound to give way: it\r\nwas their father.\r\n\r\nRosa Vanozza was quite right in comforting Caesar. Indeed, although\r\nAlexander VI had repudiated the abuses of nepotism, he understood very\r\nwell the part that was to be played for his benefit by his sons and his\r\ndaughter; for he knew he could always count on Lucrezia and Caesar, if\r\nnot on Francesco and Goffredo. In these matters the sister was quite\r\nworthy of her brother. Lucrezia was wanton in imagination, godless by\r\nnature, ambitious and designing: she had a craving for pleasure,\r\nadmiration, honours, money, jewels, gorgeous stuffs, and magnificent\r\nmansions. A true Spaniard beneath her golden tresses, a courtesan\r\nbeneath her frank looks, she carried the head of a Raphael Madonna, and\r\nconcealed the heart of a Messalina. She was dear to Roderigo both as\r\ndaughter and as mistress, and he saw himself reflected in her as in a\r\nmagic mirror, every passion and every vice. Lucrezia and Caesar were\r\naccordingly the best beloved of his heart, and the three composed that\r\ndiabolical trio which for eleven years occupied the pontifical throne,\r\nlike a mocking parody of the heavenly Trinity.\r\n\r\nNothing occurred at first to give the lie to Alexander’s professions of\r\nprinciple in the discourse he addressed to Caesar, and the first year of\r\nhis pontificate exceeded all the hopes of Rome at the time of his\r\nelection. He arranged for the provision of stores in the public\r\ngranaries with such liberality, that within the memory of man there had\r\nnever been such astonishing abundance; and with a view to extending the\r\ngeneral prosperity to the lowest class, he organised numerous doles to\r\nbe paid out of his private fortune, which made it possible for the very\r\npoor to participate in the general banquet from which they had been\r\nexcluded for long enough. The safety of the city was secured, from the\r\nvery first days of his accession, by the establishment of a strong and\r\nvigilant police force, and a tribunal consisting of four magistrates of\r\nirreproachable character, empowered to prosecute all nocturnal crimes,\r\nwhich during the last pontificate had been so common that their very\r\nnumbers made impunity certain: these judges from the first showed a\r\nseverity which neither the rank nor the purse of the culprit could\r\nmodify. This presented such a great contrast to the corruption of the\r\nlast reign,—in the course of which the vice-chamberlain one day remarked\r\nin public, when certain people were complaining of the venality of\r\njustice, \"God wills not that a sinner die, but that he live and\r\npay,\"—that the capital of the Christian world felt for one brief moment\r\nrestored to the happy days of the papacy. So, at the end of a year,\r\nAlexander VI had reconquered that spiritual credit, so to speak, which\r\nhis predecessors lost. His political credit was still to be established,\r\nif he was to carry out the first part of his gigantic scheme. To arrive\r\nat this, he must employ two agencies—alliances and conquests. His plan\r\nwas to begin with alliances. The gentleman of Aragon who had married\r\nLucrezia when she was only the daughter of Cardinal Roderigo Borgia was\r\nnot a man powerful enough, either by birth and fortune or by intellect,\r\nto enter with any sort of effect into the plots and plans of Alexander\r\nVI; the separation was therefore changed into a divorce, and Lucrezia\r\nBorgia was now free to remarry. Alexander opened up two negotiations at\r\nthe same time: he needed an ally to keep a watch on the policy of the\r\nneighbouring States. John Sforza, grandson of Alexander Sforza, brother\r\nof the great Francis I, Duke of Milan, was lord of Pesaro; the\r\ngeographical situation of this place, on the coast, on the way between\r\nFlorence and Venice, was wonderfully convenient for his purpose; so\r\nAlexander first cast an eye upon him, and as the interest of both\r\nparties was evidently the same, it came about that John Sforza was very\r\nsoon Lucrezia’s second husband.\r\n\r\nAt the same time overtures had been made to Alfonso of Aragon, heir\r\npresumptive to the crown of Naples, to arrange a marriage between Dana\r\nSancia, his illegitimate daughter, and Goffreda, the pope’s third son;\r\nbut as the old Ferdinand wanted to make the best bargain he could out of\r\nit; he dragged on the negotiations as long as possible, urging that the\r\ntwo children were not of marriageable age, and so, highly honoured as he\r\nfelt in such a prospective alliance, there was no hurry about the\r\nengagement. Matters stopped at this point, to the great annoyance of\r\nAlexander VI, who saw through this excuse, and understood that the\r\npostponement was nothing more or less than a refusal. Accordingly\r\nAlexander and Ferdinand remained in statu quo, equals in the political\r\ngame, both on the watch till events should declare for one or other. The\r\nturn of fortune was for Alexander.\r\n\r\nItaly, though tranquil, was instinctively conscious that her calm was\r\nnothing but the lull which goes before a storm. She was too rich and too\r\nhappy to escape the envy of other nations. As yet the plains of Pisa had\r\nnot been reduced to marsh-lands by the combined negligence and jealousy\r\nof the Florentine Republic, neither had the rich country that lay around\r\nRome been converted into a barren desert by the wars of the Colonna and\r\nOrsini families; not yet had the Marquis of Marignan razed to the ground\r\na hundred and twenty villages in the republic of Siena alone; and though\r\nthe Maremma was unhealthy, it was not yet a poisonous marsh: it is a\r\nfact that Flavio Blando, writing in 1450, describes Ostia as being\r\nmerely less flourishing than in the days of the Romans, when she had\r\nnumbered 50,000 inhabitants, whereas now in our own day there are barely\r\n30 in all.\r\n\r\nThe Italian peasants were perhaps the most blest on the face of the\r\nearth: instead of living scattered about the country in solitary\r\nfashion, they lived in villages that were enclosed by walls as a\r\nprotection for their harvests, animals, and farm implements; their\r\nhouses—at any rate those that yet stand—prove that they lived in much\r\nmore comfortable and beautiful surroundings than the ordinary townsman\r\nof our day. Further, there was a community of interests, and many people\r\ncollected together in the fortified villages, with the result that\r\nlittle by little they attained to an importance never acquired by the\r\nboorish French peasants or the German serfs; they bore arms, they had a\r\ncommon treasury, they elected their own magistrates, and whenever they\r\nwent out to fight, it was to save their common country.\r\n\r\nAlso commerce was no less flourishing than agriculture; Italy at this\r\nperiod was rich in industries—silk, wool, hemp, fur, alum, sulphur,\r\nbitumen; those products which the Italian soil could not bring forth\r\nwere imported, from the Black Sea, from Egypt, from Spain, from France,\r\nand often returned whence they came, their worth doubled by labour and\r\nfine workmanship. The rich man brought his merchandise, the poor his\r\nindustry: the one was sure of finding workmen, the other was sure of\r\nfinding work.\r\n\r\nArt also was by no means behindhand: Dante, Giotto, Brunelleschi, and\r\nDonatello were dead, but Ariosto, Raphael, Bramante, and Michael Angelo\r\nwere now living. Rome, Florence, and Naples had inherited the\r\nmasterpieces of antiquity; and the manuscripts of AEschylus, Sophocles,\r\nand Euripides had come (thanks to the conquest of Mahomet II) to rejoin\r\nthe statue of Xanthippus and the works of Phidias and Praxiteles. The\r\nprincipal sovereigns of Italy had come to understand, when they let\r\ntheir eyes dwell upon the fat harvests, the wealthy villages, the\r\nflourishing manufactories, and the marvellous churches, and then\r\ncompared with them the poor and rude nations of fighting men who\r\nsurrounded them on all sides, that some day or other they were destined\r\nto become for other countries what America was for Spain, a vast\r\ngold-mine for them to work. In consequence of this, a league offensive\r\nand defensive had been signed, about 1480, by Naples, Milan, Florence,\r\nand Ferrara, prepared to take a stand against enemies within or without,\r\nin Italy or outside. Ludovico Sforza, who was more than anyone else\r\ninterested in maintaining this league, because he was nearest to France,\r\nwhence the storm seemed to threaten, saw in the new pope’s election\r\nmeans not only of strengthening the league, but of making its power and\r\nunity conspicuous in the sight of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of each new election to the papacy, it is the custom for\r\nall the Christian States to send a solemn embassy to Rome, to renew\r\ntheir oath of allegiance to the Holy Father. Ludovico Sforza conceived\r\nthe idea that the ambassadors of the four Powers should unite and make\r\ntheir entry into Rome on the same day, appointing one of their envoy,\r\nviz. the representative of the King of Naples, to be spokesman for all\r\nfour. Unluckily, this plan did not agree with the magnificent projects\r\nof Piero dei Medici. That proud youth, who had been appointed ambassador\r\nof the Florentine Republic, had seen in the mission entrusted to him by\r\nhis fellow-citizens the means of making a brilliant display of his own\r\nwealth. From the day of his nomination onwards, his palace was\r\nconstantly filled with tailors, jewellers, and merchants of priceless\r\nstuffs; magnificent clothes had been made for him, embroidered with\r\nprecious stones which he had selected from the family treasures. All his\r\njewels, perhaps the richest in Italy, were distributed about the\r\nliveries of his pages, and one of them, his favourite, was to wear a\r\ncollar of pearls valued by itself at 100,000 ducats, or almost, a\r\nmillion of our francs. In his party the Bishop of Arezzo, Gentile, who\r\nhad once been Lorenzo dei Medici’s tutor, was elected as second\r\nambassador, and it was his duty to speak. Now Gentile, who had prepared\r\nhis speech, counted on his eloquence to charm the ear quite as much as\r\nPiero counted on his riches to dazzle the eye. But the eloquence of\r\nGentile would be lost completely if nobody was to speak but the\r\nambassador of the King of Naples; and the magnificence of Piero dei\r\nMedici would never be noticed at all if he went to Rome mixed up with\r\nall the other ambassadors. These two important interests, compromised by\r\nthe Duke of Milan’s proposition, changed the whole face of Italy.\r\n\r\nLudovico Sforza had already made sure of Ferdinand’s promise to conform\r\nto the plan he had invented, when the old king, at the solicitation of\r\nPiero, suddenly drew back. Sforza found out how this change had come\r\nabout, and learned that it was Piero’s influence that had overmastered\r\nhis own. He could not disentangle the real motives that had promised the\r\nchange, and imagined there was some secret league against himself: he\r\nattributed the changed political programme to the death of Lorenzo dei\r\nMedici. But whatever its cause might be, it was evidently prejudicial to\r\nhis own interests: Florence, Milan’s old ally, was abandoning her for\r\nNaples. He resolved to throw a counter weight into the scales; so,\r\nbetraying to Alexander the policy of Piero and Ferdinand, he proposed to\r\nform a defensive and offensive alliance with him and admit the republic\r\nof Venice; Duke Hercules III of Ferrara was also to be summoned to\r\npronounce for one or other of the two leagues. Alexander VI, wounded by\r\nFerdinand’s treatment of himself, accepted Ludovico Sforza’s\r\nproposition, and an Act of Confederation was signed on the 22nd of\r\nApril, 1493, by which the new allies pledged themselves to set on foot\r\nfor the maintenance of the public peace an army of 20,000 horse and\r\n6,000 infantry.\r\n\r\nFerdinand was frightened when he beheld the formation of this league;\r\nbut he thought he could neutralise its effects by depriving Ludovico\r\nSforza of his regency, which he had already kept beyond the proper time,\r\nthough as yet he was not strictly an usurper. Although the young\r\nGaleazzo, his nephew, had reached the age of two-and-twenty, Ludovico\r\nSforza none the less continued regent. Now Ferdinand definitely proposed\r\nto the Duke of Milan that he should resign the sovereign power into the\r\nhands of his nephew, on pain of being declared an usurper.\r\n\r\nThis was a bold stroke; but there was a risk of inciting Ludovico Sforza\r\nto start one of those political plots that he was so familiar with,\r\nnever recoiling from any situation, however dangerous it might be. This\r\nwas exactly what happened: Sforza, uneasy about his duchy, resolved to\r\nthreaten Ferdinand’s kingdom.\r\n\r\nNothing could be easier: he knew the warlike nations of Charles VIII,\r\nand the pretensions of the house of France to the kingdom of Naples. He\r\nsent two ambassadors to invite the young king to claim the rights of\r\nAnjou usurped by Aragon; and with a view to reconciling Charles to so\r\ndistant and hazardous an expedition, offered him a free and friendly\r\npassage through his own States.\r\n\r\nSuch a proposition was welcome to Charles VIII, as we might suppose from\r\nour knowledge of his character; a magnificent prospect was opened to him\r\nas by an enchanter: what Ludovica Sforza was offering him was virtually\r\nthe command of the Mediterranean, the protectorship of the whole of\r\nItaly; it was an open road, through Naples and Venice, that well might\r\nlead to the conquest of Turkey or the Holy Land, if he ever had the\r\nfancy to avenge the disasters of Nicapolis and Mansourah. So the\r\nproposition was accepted, and a secret alliance was signed, with Count\r\nCharles di Belgiojasa and the Count of Cajazza acting for Ludovica\r\nSforza, and the Bishop of St. Malo and Seneschal de Beaucaire for\r\nCharles VIII. By this treaty it was agreed:—\r\n\r\nThat the King of France should attempt the conquest of the kingdom of\r\nNaples;\r\n\r\nThat the Duke of Milan should grant a passage to the King of France\r\nthrough his territories, and accompany him with five hundred lances;\r\n\r\nThat the Duke of Milan should permit the King of France to send out as\r\nmany ships of war as he pleased from Genoa;\r\n\r\nLastly, that the Duke of Milan should lend the King of France 200,000\r\nducats, payable when he started.\r\n\r\nOn his side, Charles VIII agreed:—\r\n\r\nTo defend the personal authority of Ludowico Sforza over the duchy of\r\nMilan against anyone who might attempt to turn him out;\r\n\r\nTo keep two hundred French lances always in readiness to help the house\r\nof Sforza, at Asti, a town belonging to the Duke of Orleans by the\r\ninheritance of his mother, Valentina Visconti;\r\n\r\nLastly, to hand over to his ally the principality of Tarentum\r\nimmediately after the conquest of Naples was effected.\r\n\r\nThis treaty was scarcely concluded when Charles VIII, who exaggerated\r\nits advantages, began to dream of freeing himself from every let or\r\nhindrance to the expedition. Precautions were necessary; for his\r\nrelations with the great Powers were far from being what he could have\r\nwished.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Henry VII had disembarked at Calais with a formidable army, and\r\nwas threatening France with another invasion.\r\n\r\nFerdinand and Isabella of Spain, if they had not assisted at the fall of\r\nthe house of Anjou, had at any rate helped the Aragon party with men and\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nLastly, the war with the emperor acquired a fresh impetus when Charles\r\nVIII sent back Margaret of Burgundy to her father Maximilian, and\r\ncontracted a marriage with Anne of Brittany.\r\n\r\nBy the treaty of Etaples, on the 3rd of November, 1492, Henry VII\r\ncancelled the alliance with the King of the Romans, and pledged himself\r\nnot to follow his conquests.\r\n\r\nThis cost Charles VIII 745,000 gold crowns and the expenses of the war\r\nwith England.\r\n\r\nBy the treaty of Barcelona, dated the 19th of January, 1493, Ferdinand\r\nthe Catholic and Isabella agreed never to grant aid to their cousin,\r\nFerdinand of Naples, and never to put obstacles in the way of the French\r\nking in Italy.\r\n\r\nThis cost Charles VIII Perpignan, Roussillon, and the Cerdagne, which\r\nhad all been given to Louis XI as a hostage for the sum of 300,000\r\nducats by John of Aragon; but at the time agreed upon, Louis XI would\r\nnot give them up for the money, for the old fox knew very well how\r\nimportant were these doors to the Pyrenees, and proposed in case of war\r\nto keep them shut.\r\n\r\nLastly, by the treaty of Senlis, dated the 23rd of May, 1493, Maximilian\r\ngranted a gracious pardon to France for the insult her king had offered\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIt cost Charles VIII the counties of Burgundy, Artois, Charalais, and\r\nthe seigniory of Noyers, which had come to him as Margaret’s dowry, and\r\nalso the towns of Aire, Hesdin, and Bethune, which he promised to\r\ndeliver up to Philip of Austria on the day he came of age.\r\n\r\nBy dint of all these sacrifices the young king made peace with his\r\nneighbours, and could set on foot the enterprise that Ludavico Sforza\r\nhad proposed. We have already explained that the project came into\r\nSforza’s mind when his plan about the deputation was refused, and that\r\nthe refusal was due to Piero dei Medici’s desire to make an exhibition\r\nof his magnificent jewels, and Gentile’s desire to make his speech.\r\n\r\nThus the vanity of a tutor and the pride of his scholar together\r\ncombined to agitate the civilized world from the Gulf of Tarentum to the\r\nPyrenees.\r\n\r\nAlexander VI was in the very centre of the impending earthquake, and\r\nbefore Italy had any idea that the earliest shocks were at hand he had\r\nprofited by the perturbed preoccupation of other people to give the lie\r\nto that famous speech we have reported. He created cardinal John Borgia,\r\na nephew, who during the last pontificate had been elected Archbishop of\r\nMontreal and Governor of Rome. This promotion caused no discontent,\r\nbecause of John’s antecedents; and Alexander, encouraged by the success\r\nof this, promised to Caesar Borgia the archbishopric of Valencia, a\r\nbenefice he had himself enjoyed before his elevation to the papacy. But\r\nhere the difficulty arose on the side of the recipient. The young man,\r\nfull-blooded, with all the vices and natural instincts of a captain of\r\ncondottieri, had very great trouble in assuming even the appearance of a\r\nChurchman’s virtue; but as he knew from his own father’s mouth that the\r\nhighest secular dignities were reserved for his elder brother, he\r\ndecided to take what he could get, for fear of getting nothing; but his\r\nhatred for Francesco grew stronger, for from henceforth he was doubly\r\nhis rival, both in love and ambition.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Alexander beheld the old King Ferdinand returning to his side,\r\nand at the very moment when he least expected it. The pope was too\r\nclever a politician to accept a reconciliation without finding out the\r\ncause of it; he soon learned what plots were hatching at the French\r\ncourt against the kingdom of Naples, and the whole situation was\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nNow it was his turn to impose conditions.\r\n\r\nHe demanded the completion of a marriage between Goffreda, his third\r\nson, and Dada Sancia, Alfonso’s illegitimate daughter.\r\n\r\nHe demanded that she should bring her husband as dowry the principality\r\nof Squillace and the county of Cariati, with an income of 10,000 ducats\r\nand the office of protonotary, one of the seven great crown offices\r\nwhich are independent of royal control.\r\n\r\nHe demanded for his eldest son, whom Ferdinand the Catholic had just\r\nmade Duke of Gandia, the principality of Tricarico, the counties of\r\nChiaramonte, Lauria, and Carinola, an income of 12,000 ducats, and the\r\nfirst of the seven great offices which should fall vacant.\r\n\r\nHe demanded that Virginio Orsini, his ambassador at the Neapolitan\r\ncourt, should be given a third great office, viz. that of Constable, the\r\nmost important of them all.\r\n\r\nLastly, he demanded that Giuliano delta Rovere, one of the five\r\ncardinals who had opposed his election and was now taking refuge at\r\nOstia, where the oak whence he took his name and bearings is still to be\r\nseen carved on all the walls, should be driven out of that town, and the\r\ntown itself given over to him.\r\n\r\nIn exchange, he merely pledged himself never to withdraw from the house\r\nof Aragon the investiture of the kingdom of Naples accorded by his\r\npredecessors. Ferdinand was paying somewhat dearly for a simple promise;\r\nbut on the keeping of this promise the legitimacy of his power wholly\r\ndepended. For the kingdom of Naples was a fief of the Holy See; and to\r\nthe pope alone belonged the right of pronouncing on the justice of each\r\ncompetitor’s pretensions; the continuance of this investiture was\r\ntherefore of the highest conceivable importance to Aragon just at the\r\ntime when Anjou was rising up with an army at her back to dispossess\r\nher.\r\n\r\nFor a year after he mounted the papal throne, Alexander VI had made\r\ngreat strides, as we see, in the extension of his temporal power. In his\r\nown hands he held, to be sure, only the least in size of the Italian\r\nterritories; but by the marriage of his daughter Lucrezia with the lord\r\nof Pesaro he was stretching out one hand as far as Venice, while by the\r\nmarriage of the Prince of Squillace with Dona Sancia, and the\r\nterritories conceded to the Duke of Sandia, he was touching with the\r\nother hand the boundary of Calabria.\r\n\r\nWhen this treaty, so advantageous for himself, was duly signed, he made\r\nCaesar Cardinal of Santa Maria Novella, for Caesar was always\r\ncomplaining of being left out in the distribution of his father’s\r\nfavours.\r\n\r\nOnly, as there was as yet no precedent in Church history for a bastard’s\r\ndonning the scarlet, the pope hunted up four false witnesses who\r\ndeclared that Caesar was the son of Count Ferdinand of Castile; who was,\r\nas we know, that valuable person Don Manuel Melchior, and who played the\r\nfather’s part with just as much solemnity as he had played the\r\nhusband’s.\r\n\r\nThe wedding of the two bastards was most splendid, rich with the double\r\npomp of Church and King. As the pope had settled that the young bridal\r\npair should live near him, Caesar Borgia, the new cardinal, undertook to\r\nmanage the ceremony of their entry into Rome and the reception, and\r\nLucrezia, who enjoyed at her father’s side an amount of favour hitherto\r\nunheard of at the papal court, desired on her part to contribute all the\r\nsplendour she had it in her power to add. He therefore went to receive\r\nthe young people with a stately and magnificent escort of lords and\r\ncardinals, while she awaited them attended by the loveliest and noblest\r\nladies of Rome, in one of the halls of the Vatican. A throne was there\r\nprepared for the pope, and at his feet were cushions for Lucrezia and\r\nDona Sancia. \"Thus,\" writes Tommaso Tommasi, \"by the look of the\r\nassembly and the sort of conversation that went on for hours, you would\r\nsuppose you were present at some magnificent and voluptuous royal\r\naudience of ancient Assyria, rather than at the severe consistory of a\r\nRoman pontiff, whose solemn duty it is to exhibit in every act the\r\nsanctity of the name he bears. But,\" continues the same historian, \"if\r\nthe Eve of Pentecost was spent in such worthy functions, the\r\ncelebrations of the coming of the Holy Ghost on the following day were\r\nno less decorous and becoming to the spirit of the Church; for thus\r\nwrites the master of the ceremonies in his journal:\r\n\r\n\"’The pope made his entry into the Church of the Holy Apostles, and\r\nbeside him on the marble steps of the pulpit where the canons of St.\r\nPeter are wont to chant the Epistle and Gospel, sat Lucrezia his\r\ndaughter and Sancia his son’s wife: round about them, a disgrace to the\r\nChurch and a public scandal, were grouped a number of other Roman ladies\r\nfar more fit to dwell in Messalina’s city than in St. Peter’s.’\"\r\n\r\nSo at Rome and Naples did men slumber while ruin was at hand; so did\r\nthey waste their time and squander their money in a vain display of\r\npride; and this was going on while the French, thoroughly alive, were\r\nbusy laying hands upon the torches with which they would presently set\r\nItaly on fire.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the designs of Charles VIII for conquest were no longer for\r\nanybody a matter of doubt. The young king had sent an embassy to the\r\nvarious Italian States, composed of Perrone dei Baschi, Brigonnet,\r\nd’Aubigny, and the president of the Provencal Parliament. The mission of\r\nthis embassy was to demand from the Italian princes their co-operation\r\nin recovering the rights of the crown of Naples for the house of Anjou.\r\n\r\nThe embassy first approached the Venetians, demanding aid and counsel\r\nfor the king their master. But the Venetians, faithful to their\r\npolitical tradition, which had gained for them the sobriquet of \"the\r\nJews of Christendom,\" replied that they were not in a position to give\r\nany aid to the young king, so long as they had to keep ceaselessly on\r\nguard against the Turks; that, as to advice, it would be too great a\r\npresumption in them to give advice to a prince who was surrounded by\r\nsuch experienced generals and such able ministers.\r\n\r\nPerrone dei Baschi, when he found he could get no other answer, next\r\nmade for Florence. Piero dei Medici received him at a grand council, for\r\nhe summoned on this occasion not only the seventy, but also the\r\ngonfalonieri who had sat for the last thirty-four years in the Signoria.\r\nThe French ambassador put forward his proposal, that the republic should\r\npermit their army to pass through her States, and pledge herself in that\r\ncase to supply for ready money all the necessary victual and fodder. The\r\nmagnificent republic replied that if Charles VIII had been marching\r\nagainst the Turks instead of against Ferdinand, she would be only too\r\nready to grant everything he wished; but being bound to the house of\r\nAragon by a treaty, she could not betray her ally by yielding to the\r\ndemands of the King of France.\r\n\r\nThe ambassadors next turned their steps to Siena. The poor little\r\nrepublic, terrified by the honour of being considered at all, replied\r\nthat it was her desire to preserve a strict neutrality, that she was too\r\nweak to declare beforehand either for or against such mighty rivals, for\r\nshe would naturally be obliged to join the stronger party. Furnished\r\nwith this reply, which had at least the merit of frankness, the French\r\nenvoys proceeded to Rome, and were conducted into the pope’s presence,\r\nwhere they demanded the investiture of the kingdom of Naples for their\r\nking.\r\n\r\nAlexander VI replied that, as his predecessors had granted this\r\ninvestiture to the house of Aragon, he could not take it away, unless it\r\nwere first established that the house of Anjou had a better claim than\r\nthe house that was to be dispossessed. Then he represented to Perrone\r\ndei Baschi that, as Naples was a fief of the Holy See, to the pope alone\r\nthe choice of her sovereign properly belonged, and that in consequence\r\nto attack the reigning sovereign was to attack the Church itself.\r\n\r\nThe result of the embassy, we see, was not very promising for Charles\r\nVIII; so he resolved to rely on his ally Ludovico Sforza alone, and to\r\nrelegate all other questions to the fortunes of war.\r\n\r\nA piece of news that reached him about this time strengthened him in\r\nthis resolution: this was the death of Ferdinand. The old king had\r\ncaught a severe cold and cough on his return from the hunting field, and\r\nin two days he was at his last gasp. On the 25th of January, 1494, he\r\npassed away, at the age of seventy, after a thirty-six years’ reign,\r\nleaving the throne to his elder son, Alfonso, who was immediately chosen\r\nas his successor.\r\n\r\nFerdinand never belied his title of \"the happy ruler.\" His death\r\noccurred at the very moment when the fortune of his family was changing.\r\n\r\nThe new king, Alfonso, was not a novice in arms: he had already fought\r\nsuccessfully against Florence and Venice, and had driven the Turks out\r\nof Otranto; besides, he had the name of being as cunning as his father\r\nin the tortuous game of politics so much in vogue at the Italian courts.\r\nHe did not despair of counting among his allies the very enemy he was at\r\nwar with when Charles VIII first put forward his pretensions, we mean\r\nBajazet II. So he despatched to Bajazet one of his confidential\r\nministers, Camillo Pandone, to give the Turkish emperor to understand\r\nthat the expedition to Italy was to the King of France nothing but a\r\nblind for approaching the scene of Mahomedan conquests, and that if\r\nCharles VIII were once at the Adriatic it would only take him a day or\r\ntwo to get across and attack Macedonia; from there he could easily go by\r\nland to Constantinople. Consequently he suggested that Bajazet for the\r\nmaintenance of their common interests should supply six thousand horse\r\nand six thousand infantry; he himself would furnish their pay so long as\r\nthey were in Italy. It was settled that Pandone should be joined at\r\nTarentum by Giorgia Bucciarda, Alexander VI’s envoy, who was\r\ncommissioned by the pope to engage the Turks to help him against the\r\nChristians. But while he was waiting for Bajazet’s reply, which might\r\ninvolve a delay of several months, Alfonso requested that a meeting\r\nmight take place between Piero dei Medici, the pope, and himself, to\r\ntake counsel together about important affairs. This meeting was arranged\r\nat Vicovaro, near Tivoli, and the three interested parties duly met on\r\nthe appointed day.\r\n\r\nThe intention of Alfonso, who before leaving Naples had settled the\r\ndisposition of his naval forces, and given his brother Frederic the\r\ncommand of a fleet that consisted of thirty-six galleys, eighteen large\r\nand twelve small vessels, with injunctions to wait at Livorno and keep a\r\nwatch on the fleet Charles VIII was getting ready at the port of Genoa,\r\nwas above all things to check with the aid of his allies the progress of\r\noperations on land. Without counting the contingent he expected his\r\nallies to furnish, he had at his immediate disposal a hundred squadrons\r\nof heavy cavalry, twenty men in each, and three thousand bowmen and\r\nlight horse. He proposed, therefore, to advance at once into Lombardy,\r\nto get up a revolution in favour of his nephew Galeazzo, and to drive\r\nLudovico Sforza out of Milan before he could get help from France; so\r\nthat Charles VIII, at the very time of crossing the Alps, would find an\r\nenemy to fight instead of a friend who had promised him a safe passage,\r\nmen, and money.\r\n\r\nThis was the scheme of a great politician and a bold commander; but as\r\neverybody had come in pursuit of his own interests, regardless of the\r\ncommon this plan was very coldly received by Piero dei Medici, who was\r\nafraid lest in the war he should play only the same poor part he had\r\nbeen threatened with in the affair of the embassy; by Alexander VI it\r\nwas rejected, because he reckoned on employing the troops of Alfonso on\r\nhis own account. He reminded the King of Naples of one of the conditions\r\nof the investiture he had promised him, viz. that he should drive out\r\nthe Cardinal Giuliano delta Rovere from the town of Ostia, and give up\r\nthe town to him, according to the stipulation already agreed upon.\r\nBesides, the advantages that had accrued to Virginio Orsini, Alexander’s\r\nfavourite, from his embassy to Naples had brought upon him the ill-will\r\nof Prospero and Fabrizio Colonna, who owned nearly all the villages\r\nround about Rome. Now the pope could not endure to live in the midst of\r\nsuch powerful enemies, and the most important matter was to deliver him\r\nfrom all of them, seeing that it was really of moment that he should be\r\nat peace who was the head and soul of the league whereof the others were\r\nonly the body and limbs.\r\n\r\nAlthough Alfonso had clearly seen through the motives of Piero’s\r\ncoldness, and Alexander had not even given him the trouble of seeking\r\nhis, he was none the less obliged to bow to the will of his allies,\r\nleaving the one to defend the Apennines against the French, and helping\r\nthe other to shake himself free of his neighbours in the Romagna.\r\nConsequently he, pressed on the siege of Ostia, and added to Virginio’s\r\nforces, which already amounted to two hundred men of the papal army, a\r\nbody of his own light horse; this little army was to be stationed round\r\nabout Rome, and was to enforce obedience from the Colonnas. The rest of\r\nhis troops Alfonso divided into two parties: one he left in the hands of\r\nhis son Ferdinand, with orders to scour the Romagna and worry, the petty\r\nprinces into levying and supporting the contingent they had promised,\r\nwhile with the other he himself defended the defiles of the Abruzzi.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of April, at three o’clock in the morning, Alexander VI was\r\nfreed from the first and fiercest of his foes; Giuliano delta Rovere,\r\nseeing the impossibility of holding out any longer against Alfonso’s\r\ntroops, embarked on a brigantine which was to carry him to Savona.\r\n\r\nFrom that day forward Virginio Orsini began that famous partisan warfare\r\nwhich reduced the country about Rome to the most pathetic desolation the\r\nworld has ever seen. During all this time Charles VIII was at Lyons, not\r\nonly uncertain as to the route he ought to take for getting into Italy,\r\nbut even beginning to reflect a little on the chances and risks of such\r\nan expedition. He had found no sympathy anywhere except with Ludovico\r\nSforza; so it appeared not unlikely that he would have to fight not the\r\nkingdom of Naples alone, but the whole of Italy to boot. In his\r\npreparations for war he had spent almost all the money at his disposal;\r\nthe Lady of Beaujeu and the Duke of Bourbon both condemned his\r\nenterprise; Briconnet, who had advised it, did not venture to support it\r\nnow; at last Charles, more irresolute than ever, had recalled several\r\nregiments that had actually started, when Cardinal Giuliano delta\r\nRovere, driven out of Italy by the pope, arrived at Lyons, and presented\r\nhimself before the king.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal, full of hatred, full of hope, hastened to Charles, and\r\nfound him on the point of abandoning that enterprise on which, as\r\nAlexander’s enemy, delta Rovere rested his whole expectation of\r\nvengeance. He informed Charles of the quarrelling among his enemies; he\r\nshowed him that each of them was seeking his own ends—Piero dei Medici\r\nthe gratification of his pride, the pope the aggrandisement of his\r\nhouse. He pointed out that armed fleets were in the ports of\r\nVillefranche, Marseilles, and Genoa, and that these armaments would be\r\nlost; he reminded him that he had sent Pierre d’Urfe, his grand equerry,\r\non in advance, to have splendid accommodation prepared in the Spinola\r\nand Doria palaces. Lastly, he urged that ridicule and disgrace would\r\nfall on him from every side if he renounced an enterprise so loudly\r\nvaunted beforehand, for whose successful execution, moreover, he had\r\nbeen obliged to sign three treaties of peace that were all vexatious\r\nenough, viz. with Henry VII, with Maximilian, and with Ferdinand the\r\nCatholic. Giuliano della Rovere had exercised true insight in probing\r\nthe vanity of the young king, and Charles did not hesitate for a single\r\nmoment. He ordered his cousin, the Duke of Orleans (who later on became\r\nLouis XII) to take command of the French fleet and bring it to Genoa; he\r\ndespatched a courier to Antoine de Bessay, Baron de Tricastel, bidding\r\nhim take to Asti the 2000 Swiss foot-soldiers he had levied in the\r\ncantons; lastly, he started himself from Vienne, in Dauphine, on the\r\n23rd of August, 1494, crossed the Alps by Mont Genevre, without\r\nencountering a single body of troops to dispute his passage, descended\r\ninto Piedmont and Monferrato, both just then governed by women regents,\r\nthe sovereigns of both principalities being children, Charles John Aime\r\nand William John, aged respectively six and eight.\r\n\r\nThe two regents appeared before Charles VIII, one at Turin, one at\r\nCasale, each at the head of a numerous and brilliant court, and both\r\nglittering with jewels and precious stones. Charles, although he quite\r\nwell knew that for all these friendly demonstrations they were both\r\nbound by treaty to his enemy, Alfonso of Naples, treated them all the\r\nsame with the greatest politeness, and when they made protestations of\r\nfriendship, asked them to let him have a proof of it, suggesting that\r\nthey should lend him the diamonds they were covered with. The two\r\nregents could do no less than obey the invitation which was really a\r\ncommand. They took off necklaces, rings, and earrings. Charles VIII gave\r\nthem a receipt accurately drawn up, and pledged the jewels for 20,000\r\nducats. Then, enriched by this money, he resumed his journey and made\r\nhis way towards Asti. The Duke of Orleans held the sovereignty of Asti,\r\nas we said before, and hither came to meet Charles both Ludovico Sforza\r\nand his father-in-law, Hercules d’Este, Duke of Ferrara. They brought\r\nwith them not only the promised troops and money, but also a court\r\ncomposed of the loveliest women in Italy.\r\n\r\nThe balls, fetes, and tourneys began with a magnificence surpassing\r\nanything that Italy had ever seen before. But suddenly they were\r\ninterrupted by the king’s illness. This was the first example in Italy\r\nof the disease brought by Christopher Columbus from the New World, and\r\nwas called by Italians the French, by Frenchmen the Italian disease. The\r\nprobability is that some of Columbus’s crew who were at Genoa or\r\nthereabouts had already brought over this strange and cruel complaint\r\nthat counter balanced the gains of the American gold-mines.\r\n\r\nThe king’s indisposition, however, did not prove so grave as was at\r\nfirst supposed. He was cured by the end of a few weeks, and proceeded on\r\nhis way towards Pavia, where the young Duke John Galeazzo lay dying. He\r\nand the King of France were first cousins, sons of two sisters of the\r\nhouse of Savoy. So Charles VIII was obliged to see him, and went to\r\nvisit him in the castle where he lived more like prisoner than lord. He\r\nfound him half reclining on a couch, pale and emaciated, some said in\r\nconsequence of luxurious living, others from the effects of a slow but\r\ndeadly poison. But whether or not the poor young man was desirous of\r\npouring out a complaint to Charles, he did not dare say a word; for his\r\nuncle, Ludovico Sforza, never left the King of France for an instant.\r\nBut at the very moment when Charles VIII was getting up to go, the door\r\nopened, and a young woman appeared and threw herself at the king’s feet;\r\nshe was the wife of the unlucky John Galeazzo, and came to entreat his\r\ncousin to do nothing against her father Alfonso, nor against her brother\r\nFerdinand. At sight of her; Sforza scowled with an anxious and\r\nthreatening aspect, for he knew not what impression might be produced on\r\nhis ally by this scene. But he was soon reassured; for Charles replied\r\nthat he had advanced too far to draw back now, and that the glory of his\r\nname was at stake as well as the interests of his kingdom, and that\r\nthese two motives were far too important to be sacrificed to any\r\nsentiment of pity he might feel, however real and deep it might be and\r\nwas. The poor young woman, who had based her last hope an this appeal,\r\nthen rose from her knees and threw herself sobbing into her husband’s\r\narms. Charles VIII and Ludavico Sforza, took their leave: John Galeazzo\r\nwas doomed.\r\n\r\nTwo days after, Charles VIII left for Florence, accompanied by his ally;\r\nbut scarcely had they reached Parma when a messenger caught them up, and\r\nannounced to Ludovico that his nephew was just dead: Ludovico at once\r\nbegged Charles to excuse his leaving him to finish the journey alone;\r\nthe interests which called him back to Milan were so important, he said,\r\nthat he could not under the circumstances stay away a single day longer.\r\nAs a fact he had to make sure of succeeding the man he had assassinated.\r\n\r\nBut Charles VIII continued his road not without some uneasiness. The\r\nsight of the young prince on his deathbed had moved him deeply, for at\r\nthe bottom of his heart he was convinced that Ludovico Sforza was his\r\nmurderer; and a murderer might very well be a traitor. He was going\r\nforward into an unfamiliar country, with a declared enemy in front of\r\nhim and a doubtful friend behind: he was now at the entrance to the\r\nmountains, and as his army had no store of provisions and only lived\r\nfrom hand to mouth, a forced delay, however short, would mean famine. In\r\nfront of him was Fivizzano, nothing, it is true, but a village\r\nsurrounded by walls, but beyond Fivizzano lay Sarzano and Pietra Santa,\r\nboth of them considered impregnable fortresses; worse than this, they\r\nwere coming into a part of the country that was especially unhealthy in\r\nOctober, had no natural product except oil, and even procured its own\r\ncorn from neighbouring provinces; it was plain that a whole army might\r\nperish there in a few days either from scarcity of food or from the\r\nunwholesome air, both of which were more disastrous than the impediments\r\noffered at every step by the nature of the ground. The situation was\r\ngrave; but the pride of Piero dei Medici came once more to the rescue of\r\nthe fortunes of Charles VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nPIERO DEI MEDICI had, as we may remember, undertaken to hold the\r\nentrance to Tuscany against the French; when, however, he saw his enemy\r\ncoming down from the Alps, he felt less confident about his own\r\nstrength, and demanded help from the pope; but scarcely had the rumour\r\nof foreign invasion began to spread in the Romagna, than the Colonna\r\nfamily declared themselves the French king’s men, and collecting all\r\ntheir forces seized Ostia, and there awaited the coming of the French\r\nfleet to offer a passage through Rome. The pope, therefore, instead of\r\nsending troops to Florence, was obliged to recall all his soldiers to be\r\nnear the capital; the only promise he made to Piero was that if Bajazet\r\nshould send him the troops that he had been asking for, he would\r\ndespatch that army for him to make use of. Piero dei Medici had not yet\r\ntaken any resolution or formed any plan, when he suddenly heard two\r\nstartling pieces of news. A jealous neighbour of his, the Marquis of\r\nTorderiovo, had betrayed to the French the weak side of Fivizzano, so\r\nthat they had taken it by storm, and had put its soldiers and\r\ninhabitants to the edge of the sword; on another side, Gilbert of\r\nMontpensier, who had been lighting up the sea-coast so as to keep open\r\nthe communications between the French army and their fleet, had met with\r\na detachment sent by Paolo Orsini to Sarzano, to reinforce the garrison\r\nthere, and after an hour’s fighting had cut it to pieces. No quarter had\r\nbeen granted to any of the prisoners; every man the French could get\r\nhold of they had massacred.\r\n\r\nThis was the first occasion on which the Italians, accustomed as they\r\nwere to the chivalrous contests of the fifteenth century, found\r\nthemselves in contact with savage foreigners who, less advanced in\r\ncivilisation, had not yet come to consider war as a clever game, but\r\nlooked upon it as simply a mortal conflict. So the news of these two\r\nbutcheries produced a tremendous sensation at Florence, the richest city\r\nin Italy, and the most prosperous in commerce and in art. Every\r\nFlorentine imagined the French to be like an army of those ancient\r\nbarbarians who were wont to extinguish fire with blood. The prophecies\r\nof Savonarola, who had predicted the foreign invasion and the\r\ndestruction that should follow it, were recalled to the minds of all;\r\nand so much perturbation was evinced that Piero dei Medici, bent on\r\ngetting peace at any price, forced a decree upon the republic whereby\r\nshe was to send an embassy to the conqueror; and obtained leave,\r\nresolved as he was to deliver himself in person into the hands of the\r\nFrench monarch, to act as one of the ambassadors. He accordingly quitted\r\nFlorence, accompanied by four other messengers, and on his arrival at\r\nPietra Santa, sent to ask from Charles VIII a safe-conduct for himself\r\nalone. The day after he made this request, Brigonnet and de Piennes came\r\nto fetch him, and led him into the presence of Charles VIII.\r\n\r\nPiero dei Medici, in spite of his name and influence, was in the eyes of\r\nthe French nobility, who considered it a dishonourable thing to concern\r\noneself with art or industry, nothing more than a rich merchant, with\r\nwhom it would be absurd to stand upon any very strict ceremony. So\r\nCharles VIII received him on horseback, and addressing him with a\r\nhaughty air, as a master might address a servant, demanded whence came\r\nthis pride of his that made him dispute his entrance into Tuscany. Piero\r\ndei Medici replied, that, with the actual consent of Louis XI, his\r\nfather Lorenzo had concluded a treaty of alliance with Ferdinand of\r\nNaples; that accordingly he had acted in obedience to prior obligations,\r\nbut as he did, not wish to push too far his devotion to the house of\r\nAragon or his opposition to France, he was ready to do whatever Charles\r\nVIII might demand of him. The king, who had never looked for such\r\nhumility in his enemy, demanded that Sarzano should be given up to him:\r\nto this Piero dei Medici at once consented. Then the conqueror, wishing\r\nto see how far the ambassador of the magnificent republic would extend\r\nhis politeness, replied that this concession was far from satisfying\r\nhim, and that he still must have the keys of Pietra Santa, Pisa,\r\nLibrafatta, and Livorno. Piero saw no more difficulty about these than\r\nabout Sarzano, and consented on Charles’s mere promise by word of mouth\r\nto restore the town when he had achieved the conquest of Naples. At last\r\nCharles VIII, seeing that this man who had been sent out to negotiate\r\nwith him was very easy to manage, exacted as a final condition, a ’sine\r\nqua non’, however, of his royal protection, that the magnificent\r\nrepublic should lend him the sum of 200,000 florins. Piero found it no\r\nharder to dispose of money than of fortresses, and replied that his\r\nfellow-citizens would be happy to render this service to their new ally.\r\nThen Charles VIII set him on horseback, and ordered him to go on in\r\nfront, so as to begin to carry out his promises by yielding up the four\r\nfortresses he had insisted on having. Piero obeyed, and the French army,\r\nled by the grandson of Cosimo the Great and the son of Lorenzo the\r\nMagnificent, continued its triumphal march through Tuscany.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival at Lucca, Piero dei Medici learnt that his concessions to\r\nthe King of France were making a terrible commotion at Florence. The\r\nmagnificent republic had supposed that what Charles VIII wanted was\r\nsimply a passage through her territory, so when the news came there was\r\na general feeling of discontent, which was augmented by the return of\r\nthe other ambassadors, whom Piero had not even consulted when he took\r\naction as he did. Piero considered it necessary that he should return,\r\nso he asked Charles’s permission to precede him to the capital. As he\r\nhad fulfilled all his promises, except the matter of the loan, which\r\ncould not be settled anywhere but at Florence, the king saw no\r\nobjection, and the very evening after he quitted the French army Piero\r\nreturned incognito to his palace in the Via Largo.\r\n\r\nThe next day he proposed to present himself before the Signoria, but\r\nwhen he arrived at the Piazza del Palazzo Vecchio, he perceived the\r\ngonfaloniere Jacopo de Nerli coming towards him, signalling to him that\r\nit was useless to attempt to go farther, and pointing out to him the\r\nfigure of Luca Corsini standing at the gate, sword in hand: behind him\r\nstood guards, ordered, if need-were, to dispute his passage. Piero dei\r\nMedici, amazed by an opposition that he was experiencing for the first\r\ntime in his life, did not attempt resistance. He went home, and wrote to\r\nhis brother-in-law, Paolo Orsini, to come and help him with his\r\ngendarmes. Unluckily for him, his letter was intercepted. The Signoria\r\nconsidered that it was an attempt at rebellion. They summoned the\r\ncitizens to their aid; they armed hastily, sallied forth in crowds, and\r\nthronged about the piazza of the palace. Meanwhile Cardinal Gian dei\r\nMedici had mounted on horseback, and under the impression that the\r\nOrsini were coming to the rescue, was riding about the streets of\r\nFlorence, accompanied by his servants and uttering his battle cry,\r\n\"Palle, Palle.\" But times had changed: there was no echo to the cry, and\r\nwhen the cardinal reached the Via dei Calizaioli, a threatening murmur\r\nwas the only response, and he understood that instead of trying to\r\narouse Florence he had much better get away before the excitement ran\r\ntoo high. He promptly retired to his own palace, expecting to find there\r\nhis two brothers, Piero and Giuliano. But they, under the protection of\r\nOrsini and his gendarmes, had made their escape by the Porto San Gallo.\r\nThe peril was imminent, and Gian dei Medici wished to follow their\r\nexample; but wherever he went he was met by a clamour that grew more and\r\nmore threatening. At last, as he saw that the danger was constantly\r\nincreasing, he dismounted from his horse and ran into a house that he\r\nfound standing open. This house by a lucky chance communicated with a\r\nconvent of Franciscans; one of the friars lent the fugitive his dress,\r\nand the cardinal, under the protection of this humble incognito,\r\ncontrived at last to get outside Florence, and joined his two brothers\r\nin the Apennines.\r\n\r\nThe same day the Medici were declared traitors and rebels, and\r\nambassadors were sent to the King of France. They found him at Pisa,\r\nwhere he was granting independence to the town which eighty-seven years\r\nago had fallen under the rule of the Florentines. Charles VIII made no\r\nreply to the envoys, but merely announced that he was going to march on\r\nFlorence.\r\n\r\nSuch a reply, one may easily understand, terrified the republic.\r\nFlorence, had no time to prepare a defence, and no strength in her\r\npresent state to make one. But all the powerful houses assembled and\r\narmed their own servants and retainers, and awaited the issue, intending\r\nnot to begin hostilities, but to defend themselves should the French\r\nmake an attack. It was agreed that if any necessity should arise for\r\ntaking up arms, the bells of the various churches in the town should\r\nring a peal and so serve as a general signal. Such a resolution was\r\nperhaps of more significant moment in Florence than it could have been\r\nin any other town. For the palaces that still remain from that period\r\nare virtually fortresses and the eternal fights between Guelphs and\r\nGhibellines had familiarised the Tuscan people with street warfare.\r\n\r\nThe king appeared, on the 17th of November, in the evening, at the gate\r\nof San Friano. He found there the nobles of Florence clad in their most\r\nmagnificent apparel, accompanied by priests chanting hymns, and by a mob\r\nwho were full of joy at any prospect of change, and hoped for a return\r\nof liberty after the fall of the Medici. Charles VIII stopped for a\r\nmoment under a sort of gilded canopy that had been prepared for him, and\r\nreplied in a few evasive words to the welcoming speeches which were\r\naddressed to him by the Signoria; then he asked for his lance, he set it\r\nin rest, and gave the order to enter the town, the whole of which he\r\nparaded with his army following him with arms erect, and then went down\r\nto the palace of the Medici, which had been prepared for him.\r\n\r\nThe next day negotiations commenced; but everyone was out of his\r\nreckoning. The Florentines had received Charles VIII as a guest, but he\r\nhad entered the city as a conqueror. So when the deputies of the\r\nSignoria spoke of ratifying the treaty of Piero dei Medici, the king\r\nreplied that such a treaty no longer existed, as they had banished the\r\nman who made it; that he had conquered Florence, as he proved the night\r\nbefore, when he entered lance in hand; that he should retain the\r\nsovereignty, and would make any further decision whenever it pleased him\r\nto do so; further, he would let them know later on whether he would\r\nreinstate the Medici or whether he would delegate his authority to the\r\nSignoria: all they had to do was to come back the next day, and he would\r\ngive them his ultimatum in writing.\r\n\r\nThis reply threw Florence into a great state of consternation; but the\r\nFlorentines were confirmed in their resolution of making a stand.\r\nCharles, for his part, had been astonished by the great number of the\r\ninhabitants; not only was every street he had passed through thickly\r\nlined with people, but every house from garret to basement seemed\r\noverflowing with human beings. Florence indeed, thanks to her rapid\r\nincrease in population, could muster nearly 150,000 souls.\r\n\r\nThe next day, at the appointed hour, the deputies made their appearance\r\nto meet the king. They were again introduced into his presence, and the\r\ndiscussion was reopened. At last, as they were coming to no sort of\r\nunderstanding, the royal secretary, standing at the foot of the throne\r\nupon which Charles VIII sat with covered head, unfolded a paper and\r\nbegan to read, article by article, the conditions imposed by the King of\r\nFrance. But scarcely had he read a third of the document when the\r\ndiscussion began more hotly than ever before. Then Charles VIII said\r\nthat thus it should be, or he would order his trumpets to be sounded.\r\nHereupon Piero Capponi, secretary to the republic, commonly called the\r\nScipio of Florence, snatched from the royal secretary’s hand the\r\nshameful proposal of capitulation, and tearing it to pieces, exclaimed:—\r\n\r\n\"Very good, sire; blow your trumpets, and we will ring our bells.\"\r\n\r\nHe threw the pieces in the face of the amazed reader, and dashed out of\r\nthe room to give the terrible order that would convert the street of\r\nFlorence into a battlefield.\r\n\r\nStill, against all probabilities, this bold answer saved the town. The\r\nFrench supposed, from such audacious words, addressed as they were to\r\nmen who so far had encountered no single obstacle, that the Florentines\r\nwere possessed of sure resources, to them unknown: the few prudent men\r\nwho retained any influence over the king advised him accordingly to\r\nabate his pretensions; the result was that Charles VIII offered new and\r\nmore reasonable conditions, which were accepted, signed by both parties,\r\nand proclaimed on the 26th of November during mass in the cathedral of\r\nSanta Maria Del Fiore.\r\n\r\nThese were the conditions:\r\n\r\nThe Signoria were to pay to Charles VIII, as subsidy, the sum of 120,000\r\nflorins, in three instalments;\r\n\r\nThe Signoria were to remove the sequestration imposed upon the property\r\nof the Medici, and to recall the decree that set a price on their heads;\r\n\r\nThe Signoria were to engage to pardon the Pisans, on condition of their\r\nagain submitting to the rule of Florence;\r\n\r\nLastly, the Signoria were to recognise the claims of the Duke of Milan\r\nover Sarzano and Pietra Santa, and these claims thus recognised, were to\r\nbe settled by arbitration.\r\n\r\nIn exchange for this, the King of France pledged himself to restore the\r\nfortresses that had been given up to him, either after he had made\r\nhimself master of the town of Naples, or when this war should be ended\r\nby a peace or a two years’ truce, or else when, for any reason\r\nwhatsoever, he should have quitted Italy.\r\n\r\nTwo days after this proclamation, Charles VIII, much to the joy of the\r\nSignoria, left Florence, and advanced towards Rome by the route of\r\nPoggibondi and Siena.\r\n\r\nThe pope began to be affected by the general terror: he had heard of the\r\nmassacres of Fivizzano, of Lunigiane, and of Imola; he knew that Piero\r\ndei Medici had handed over the Tuscan fortresses, that Florence had\r\nsuccumbed, and that Catherine Sforza had made terms with the conqueror;\r\nhe saw the broken remnants of the Neapolitan troops pass disheartened\r\nthrough Rome, to rally their strength in the Abruzzi, and thus he found\r\nhimself exposed to an enemy who was advancing upon him with the whole of\r\nthe Romagna under his control from one sea to the other, in a line of\r\nmarch extending from Piombina to Ancona.\r\n\r\nIt was at this juncture that Alexander VI received his answer from\r\nBajazet II: the reason of so long a delay was that the pope’s envoy and\r\nthe Neapolitan ambassador had been stopped by Gian della Rovere, the\r\nCardinal Giuliano’s brother, just as they were disembarking at\r\nSinigaglia. They were charged with a verbal answer, which was that the\r\nsultan at this moment was busied with a triple war, first with the\r\nSultan of Egypt, secondly with the King of Hungary, and thirdly with the\r\nGreeks of Macedonia and Epirus; and therefore he could not, with all the\r\nwill in the world, help His Holiness with armed men. But the envoys were\r\naccompanied by a favourite of the sultan’s bearing a private letter to\r\nAlexander VI, in which Bajazet offered on certain conditions to help him\r\nwith money. Although, as we see, the messengers had been stopped on the\r\nway, the Turkish envoy had all the same found a means of getting his\r\ndespatch sent to the pope: we give it here in all its naivete.\r\n\r\n\"Bajazet the Sultan, son of the Sultan Mahomet II, by the grace of God\r\nEmperor of Asia and Europe, to the Father and Lord of all the\r\nChristians, Alexander VI, Roman pontiff and pope by the will of heavenly\r\nProvidence, first, greetings that we owe him and bestow with all our\r\nheart. We make known to your Highness, by the envoy of your Mightiness,\r\nGiorgio Bucciarda, that we have been apprised of your convalescence, and\r\nreceived the news thereof with great joy and comfort. Among other\r\nmatters, the said Bucciarda has brought us word that the King of France,\r\nnow marching against your Highness, has shown a desire to take under his\r\nprotection our brother D’jem, who is now under yours—a thing which is\r\nnot only against our will, but which would also be the cause of great\r\ninjury to your Highness and to all Christendom. In turning the matter\r\nover with your envoy Giorgio we have devised a scheme most conducive to\r\npeace and most advantageous and honourable for your Highness; at the\r\nsame time satisfactory to ourselves personally; it would be well if our\r\naforesaid brother D’jem, who being a man is liable to death, and who is\r\nnow in the hands of your Highness, should quit this world as soon as\r\npossible, seeing that his departure, a real good to him in his position,\r\nwould be of great use to your Highness, and very conducive to your\r\npeace, while at the same time it would be very agreeable to us, your\r\nfriend. If this proposition is favourably received, as we hope, by your\r\nHighness, in your desire to be friendly towards us, it would be\r\nadvisable both in the interests of your Highness and for our own\r\nsatisfaction that it should occur rather sooner than later, and by the\r\nsurest means you might be pleased to employ; so that our said brother\r\nD’jem might pass from the pains of this world into a better and more\r\npeaceful life, where at last he may find repose. If your Highness should\r\nadapt this plan and send us the body of our brother, We, the above-named\r\nSultan Bajazet, pledge ourselves to send to your Highness, wheresoever\r\nand by whatsoever hands you please, the sum of 300,000 ducats, With\r\nwhich sum you could purchase some fair domain for your children. In\r\norder to facilitate this purchase, we would be willing, while awaiting\r\nthe issue, to place the 300,000 ducats in the hands of a third party, so\r\nthat your Highness might be quite certain of receiving the money on an\r\nappointed day, in return for the despatch of our brother’s body.\r\nMoreover, we promise your Highness herewith, for your greater\r\nsatisfaction, that never, so long as you shall remain on the pontifical\r\nthrone, shall there be any hurt done to the Christians, neither by us,\r\nnor by our servants, nor by any of our compatriots, of whatsoever kind\r\nor condition they may be, neither on sea nor on land. And for the still\r\nfurther satisfaction of your Highness, and in order that no doubt\r\nwhatever may remain concerning the fulfilment of our promises, we have\r\nsworn and affirmed in the presence of Bucciarda, your envoy, by the true\r\nGod whom we adore and by our holy Gospels, that they shall be faithfully\r\nkept from the first point unto the last. And now for the final and\r\ncomplete assurance of your Highness, in order that no doubt may still\r\nremain in your heart, and that you may be once again and profoundly\r\nconvinced of our good faith, we the aforesaid Sultan Bajazet do swear by\r\nthe true God, who has created the heavens and the earth and all that\r\ntherein is, that we will religiously observe all that has been above\r\nsaid and declared, and in the future will do nothing and undertake\r\nnothing that may be contrary to the interests of your Highness.\r\n\r\n\"Given at Constantinople, in our palace, on the 12th of September A.D.\r\n1494.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter was the cause of great joy to the Holy Father: the aid of\r\nfour or five thousand Turks would be insufficient under the present\r\ncircumstances, and would only serve to compromise the head of\r\nChristendom, while the sum of 300,000 ducats—that is, nearly a million\r\nfrancs—was good to get in any sort of circumstances. It is true that, so\r\nlong as D’jem lived, Alexander was drawing an income of 180,000 livres,\r\nwhich as a life annuity represented a capital of nearly two millions;\r\nbut when one needs ready maney, one ought to be able to make a sacrifice\r\nin the way of discount. All the same, Alexander formed no definite plan,\r\nresolved on acting as circumstances should indicate.\r\n\r\nBut it was a more pressing business to decide how he should behave to\r\nthe King of France: he had never anticipated the success of the French\r\nin Italy, and we have seen that he laid all the foundations of his\r\nfamily’s future grandeur upon his alliance with the house of Aragon. But\r\nhere was this house tottering, and a volcano more terrible than her own\r\nVesuvius was threatening to swallow up Naples. He must therefore change\r\nhis policy, and attach himself to the victor,—no easy matter, for\r\nCharles VIII was bitterly annoyed with the pope for having refused him\r\nthe investiture and given it to Aragon.\r\n\r\nIn consequence, he sent Cardinal Francesco Piccolomini as an envoy to\r\nthe king. This choice looked like a mistake at first, seeing that the\r\nambassador was a nephew of Pius II, who had vigorously opposed the house\r\nof Anjou; but Alexander in acting thus had a second design, which could\r\nnot be discerned by those around him. In fact, he had divined that\r\nCharles would not be quick to receive his envoy, and that, in the\r\nparleyings to which his unwillingness must give rise, Piccolomini would\r\nnecessarily be brought into contact with the young king’s advisers. Now,\r\nbesides his ostensible mission to the king, Piccalamini had also secret\r\ninstructions for the more influential among his counsellors. These were\r\nBriconnet and Philippe de Luxembourg; and Piccolomini was authorised to\r\npromise a cardinal’s hat to each of them. The result was just what\r\nAlexander had foreseen: his envoy could not gain admission to Charles,\r\nand was obliged to confer with the people about him. This was what the\r\npope wished. Piccolomini returned to Rome with the king’s refusal, but\r\nwith a promise from Briconnet and Philippe de Luxembourg that they would\r\nuse all their influence with Charles in favour of the Holy Father, and\r\nprepare him to receive a fresh embassy.\r\n\r\nBut the French all this time were advancing, and never stopped more than\r\nforty-eight hours in any town, so that it became more and more urgent to\r\nget something settled with Charles. The king had entered Siena and\r\nViterbo without striking a blow; Yves d’ Alegre and Louis de Ligny had\r\ntaken over Ostia from the hands of the Colonnas; Civita Vecchia and\r\nCorneto had opened their gates; the Orsini had submitted; even Gian\r\nSforza, the pope’s son-in-law, had retired from the alliance with\r\nAragon. Alexander accordingly judged that the moment had came to abandon\r\nhis ally, and sent to Charles the Bishops of Concordia and Terni, and\r\nhis confessor, Mansignore Graziano. They were charged to renew to\r\nBriconnet and Philippe de Luxembourg the promise of the cardinalship,\r\nand had full powers of negotiation in the name of their master, both in\r\ncase Charles should wish to include Alfonso II in the treaty, and in\r\ncase he should refuse to sign an agreement with any other but the pope\r\nalone. They found the mind of Charles influenced now by the insinuation\r\nof Giuliano della Ravere, who, himself a witness of the pope’s simony,\r\npressed the king to summon a council and depose the head of the Church,\r\nand now by the secret support given him by the Bishops of Mans and St.\r\nMalo. The end of it was that the king decided to form his own opinion\r\nabout the matter and settle nothing beforehand, and continued this\r\nroute, sending the ambassadors back to the pope, with the addition of\r\nthe Marechal de Gie, the Seneschal de Beaucaire, and Jean de Gannay,\r\nfirst president of the Paris Parliament. They were ordered to say to the\r\npope—\r\n\r\n  (1) That the king wished above all things to be admitted into Rome\r\n      without resistance; that, an condition of a voluntary, frank, and\r\n      loyal admission, he would respect the authority of the Holy Father\r\n      and the privileges of the Church;\r\n  (2) That the king desired that D’jem should be given up to him, in\r\n      order that he might make use of him against the sultan when he\r\n      should carry the war into Macedonia or Turkey or the Holy Land;\r\n  (3) That the remaining conditions were so unimportant that they could\r\n      be brought forward at the first conference.\r\n\r\nThe ambassadors added that the French army was now only two days distant\r\nfrom Rome, and that in the evening of the day after next Charles would\r\nprobably arrive in person to demand an answer from His Holiness.\r\n\r\nIt was useless to think of parleying with a prince who acted in such\r\nexpeditious fashion as this. Alexander accordingly warned Ferdinand to\r\nquit Rome as soon as possible, in the interests of his own personal\r\nsafety. But Ferdinand refused to listen to a word, and declared that he\r\nwould not go out at one gate while Charles VIII came in at another. His\r\nsojourn was not long. Two days later, about eleven o’clock in the\r\nmorning, a sentinel placed on a watch-tower at the top of the Castle S.\r\nAngelo, whither the pope had retired, cried out that the vanguard of the\r\nenemy was visible on the horizon. At once Alexander and the Duke of\r\nCalabria went up an the terrace which tops the fortress, and assured\r\nthemselves with their own eyes that what the soldier said was true.\r\nThen, and not till then, did the duke of Calabria mount on horseback,\r\nand, to use his own words, went out at the gate of San Sebastiana, at\r\nthe same moment that the French vanguard halted five hundred feet from\r\nthe Gate of the People. This was on the 31st of December 1494.\r\n\r\nAt three in the afternoon the whole army had arrived, and the vanguard\r\nbegan their march, drums beating, ensigns unfurled. It was composed,\r\nsays Paolo Giove, an eye-witness (book ii, p. 41 of his History), of\r\nSwiss and German soldiers, with short tight coats of various colours:\r\nthey were armed with short swords, with steel edges like those of the\r\nancient Romans, and carried ashen lances ten feet long, with straight\r\nand sharp iron spikes: only one-fourth of their number bore halberts\r\ninstead of lances, the spikes cut into the form of an axe and surmounted\r\nby a four-cornered spike, to be used both for cutting like an axe and\r\npiercing like a bayonet: the first row of each battalion wore helmets\r\nand cuirasses which protected the head and chest, and when the men were\r\ndrawn up for battle they presented to the enemy a triple array of iron\r\nspikes, which they could raise or lower like the spines of a porcupine.\r\nTo each thousand of the soldiery were attached a hundred fusiliers:\r\ntheir officers, to distinguish them from the men, wore lofty plumes on\r\ntheir helmets.\r\n\r\nAfter the Swiss infantry came the archers of Gascony: there were five\r\nthousand of them, wearing a very simple dress, that contrasted with the\r\nrich costume of the Swiss soldiers, the shortest of whom would have been\r\na head higher than the tallest of the Gascons. But they were excellent\r\nsoldiers, full of courage, very light, and with a special reputation for\r\nquickness in stringing and drawing their iron bows.\r\n\r\nBehind them rode the cavalry, the flower of the French nobility, with\r\ntheir gilded helmets and neck bands, their velvet and silk surcoats,\r\ntheir swords each of which had its own name, their shields each telling\r\nof territorial estates, and their colours each telling of a lady-love.\r\nBesides defensive arms, each man bore a lance in his hand, like an\r\nItalian gendarme, with a solid grooved end, and on his saddle bow a\r\nquantity of weapons, some for cutting and some for thrusting. Their\r\nhorses were large and strong, but they had their tails and ears cropped\r\naccording to the French custom. These horses, unlike those of the\r\nItalian gendarmes, wore no caparisons of dressed leather, which made\r\nthem more exposed to attack. Every knight was followed by three\r\nhorses—the first ridden by a page in armour like his own, the two others\r\nby equerries who were called lateral auxiliaries, because in a fray they\r\nfought to right and left of their chief. This troop was not only the\r\nmost magnificent, but the most considerable in the whole army; for as\r\nthere were 2500 knights, they formed each with their three followers a\r\ntotal of 10,000 men. Five thousand light horse rode next, who carried\r\nhuge wooden bows, and shot long arrows from a distance like English\r\narchers. They were a great help in battle, for moving rapidly wherever\r\naid was required, they could fly in a moment from one wing to another,\r\nfrom the rear to the van, then when their quivers were empty could go\r\noff at so swift a gallop that neither infantry or heavy cavalry could\r\npursue them. Their defensive armour consisted of a helmet and\r\nhalf-cuirass; some of them carried a short lance as well, with which to\r\npin their stricken foe to the ground; they all wore long cloaks adorned\r\nwith shoulder-knots, and plates of silver whereon the arms of their\r\nchief were emblazoned.\r\n\r\nAt last came the young king’s escort; there were four hundred archers,\r\namong whom a hundred Scots formed a line on each side, while two hundred\r\nof the most illustrious knights marched on foot beside the prince,\r\ncarrying heavy arms on their shoulders. In the midst of this magnificent\r\nescort advanced Charles VIII, both he and his horse covered with\r\nsplendid armour; on his right and left marched Cardinal Ascanio Sforza,\r\nthe Duke of Milan’s brother, and Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, of whom\r\nwe have spoken so often, who was afterwards Pope Julius II. The\r\nCardinals Colonna and Savelli followed immediately after, and behind\r\nthem came Prospero and Fabrizia Colonna, and all the Italian princes and\r\ngenerals who had thrown in their lot with the conqueror, and were\r\nmarching intermingled with the great French lords.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the crowd that had collected to see all these foreign\r\nsoldiers go by, a sight so new and strange, listened uneasily to a dull\r\nsound which got nearer and nearer. The earth visibly trembled, the glass\r\nshook in the windows, and behind the king’s escort thirty-six bronze\r\ncannons were seen to advance, bumping along as they lay on their\r\ngun-carriages. These cannons were eight feet in length; and as their\r\nmouths were large enough to hold a man’s head, it was supposed that each\r\nof these terrible machines, scarcely known as yet to the Italians,\r\nweighed nearly six thousand pounds. After the cannons came culverins\r\nsixteen feet long, and then falconets, the smallest of which shot balls\r\nthe size of a grenade. This formidable artillery brought up the rear of\r\nthe procession, and formed the hindmost guard of the French army.\r\n\r\nIt was six hours since the front guard entered the town; and as it was\r\nnow night and for every six artillery-men there was a torch-bearer, this\r\nillumination gave to the objects around a more gloomy character than\r\nthey would have shown in the sunlight. The young king was to take up his\r\nquarters in the Palazzo di Venezia, and all the artillery was directed\r\ntowards the plaza and the neighbouring streets. The remainder of the\r\narmy was dispersed about the town. The same evening, they brought to the\r\nking, less to do honour to him than to assure him of his safety, the\r\nkeys of Rome and the keys of the Belvedere Garden just the same thing\r\nhad been done for the Duke of Calabria.\r\n\r\nThe pope, as we said, had retired to the Castle S. Angelo with only six\r\ncardinals, so from the day after his arrival the young king had around\r\nhim a court of very different brilliance from that of the head of the\r\nChurch. Then arose anew the question of a convocation to prove\r\nAlexander’s simony and proceed to depose him; but the king’s chief\r\ncounsellors, gained over, as we know, pointed out that this was a bad\r\nmoment to excite a new schism in the Church, just when preparations were\r\nbeing made for war against the infidels. As this was also the king’s\r\nprivate opinion, there was not much trouble in persuading him, and he\r\nmade up his mind to treat with His Holiness.\r\n\r\nBut the negotiations had scarcely begun when they had to be broken off;\r\nfor the first thing Charles VIII demanded was the surrender of the\r\nCastle S. Angelo, and as the pope saw in this castle his only refuge, it\r\nwas the last thing he chose to give up. Twice, in his youthful\r\nimpatience, Charles wanted to take by force what he could not get by\r\ngoodwill, and had his cannons directed towards the Holy Father’s\r\ndwelling-place; but the pope was unmoved by these demonstrations; and\r\nobstinate as he was, this time it was the French king who gave way.\r\n\r\nThis article, therefore, was set aside, and the following conditions\r\nwere agreed upon:\r\n\r\nThat there should be from this day forward between His Majesty the King\r\nof France and the Holy Father a sincere friendship and a firm alliance;\r\n\r\nBefore the completion of the conquest of the kingdom of Naples, the King\r\nof France should occupy, for the advantage and accommodation of his\r\narmy, the fortresses of Civita Vecchia, Terracina, and Spoleto;\r\n\r\nLastly, the Cardinal Valentino (this was now the name of Caesar Borgia,\r\nafter his archbishopric of Valencia) should accompany the king in the\r\ncapacity of apostolic ambassador, really as a hostage.\r\n\r\nThese conditions fixed, the ceremonial of an interview was arranged. The\r\nking left the Palazzo di Venezia and went to live in the Vatican. At the\r\nappointed time he entered by the door of a garden that adjoined the\r\npalace, while the pope, who had not had to quit the Castle S. Angelo,\r\nthanks to a corridor communicating between the two palaces, came down\r\ninto the same garden by another gate. The result of this arrangement was\r\nthat the king the next moment perceived the pope, and knelt down, but\r\nthe pope pretended not to see him, and the king advancing a few paces,\r\nknelt a second time; as His Holiness was at that moment screened by some\r\nmasonry, this supplied him with another excuse, and the king went on\r\nwith the performance, got up again, once more advanced several steps,\r\nand was on the point of kneeling down the third time face to face, when\r\nthe Holy Father at last perceived him, and, walking towards him as\r\nthough he would prevent him from kneeling, took off his own hat, and\r\npressing him to his heart, raised him up and tenderly kissed his\r\nforehead, refusing to cover until the king had put his cap upon his\r\nhead, with the aid of the pope’s own hands. Then, after they had stood\r\nfor a moment, exchanging polite and friendly speeches, the king lost no\r\ntime in praying His Holiness to be so good as to receive into the Sacred\r\nCollege William Bricannet, the Bishop of St. Malo. As this matter had\r\nbeen agreed upon beforehand by that prelate and His Holiness, though the\r\nking was not aware of it, Alexander was pleased to get credit by\r\npromptly granting the request; and he instantly ordered one of his\r\nattendants to go to the house of his son, Cardinal Valentino, and fetch\r\na cape and hat. Then taking the king by the hand, he conducted him into\r\nthe hall of Papagalli, where the ceremony was to take place of the\r\nadmission of the new cardinal. The solemn oath of obedience which was to\r\nbe taken by Charles to His Holiness as supreme head of the Christian\r\nChurch was postponed till the following day.\r\n\r\nWhen that solemn day arrived, every person important in Rome, noble,\r\ncleric, or soldier, assembled around His Holiness. Charles, on his side,\r\nmade his approach to the Vatican with a splendid following of princes,\r\nprelates, and captains. At the threshold of the palace he found four\r\ncardinals who had arrived before him: two of them placed themselves one\r\non each side of him, the two others behind him, and all his retinue\r\nfollowing, they traversed a long line of apartments full of guards and\r\nservants, and at last arrived in the reception-room, where the pope was\r\nseated on his throne, with his son, Caesar Borgia; behind him. On his\r\narrival at the door, the King of France began the usual ceremonial, and\r\nwhen he had gone on from genuflexions to kissing the feet, the hand, and\r\nthe forehead, he stood up, while the first president of the Parliament\r\nof Paris, in his turn stepping forward, said in a loud voice:\r\n\r\n\"Very Holy Father, behold my king ready to offer to your Holiness that\r\noath of obedience that he owes to you; but in France it is customary\r\nthat he who offers himself as vassal to his lord shall receive in\r\nexchange therefor such boons as he may demand. His Majesty, therefore,\r\nwhile he pledges himself for his own part to behave unto your Holiness\r\nwith a munificence even greater than that wherewith your Holiness shall\r\nbehave unto him, is here to beg urgently that you accord him three\r\nfavours. These favours are: first, the confirmation of priveleges\r\nalready granted to the king, to the queen his wife, and to the dauphin\r\nhis son; secondly, the investiture, for himself and his successors, of\r\nthe kingdom of Naples; lastly, the surrender to him of the person of the\r\nsultan D’jem, brother of the Turkish emperor.\"\r\n\r\nAt this address the pope was for a moment stupefied, for he did not\r\nexpect these three demands, which were moreover made so publicly by\r\nCharles that no manner of refusal was possible. But quickly recovering\r\nhis presence of mind, he replied to the king that he would willingly\r\nconfirm the privileges that had been accorded to the house of France by\r\nhis predecessors; that he might therefore consider his first demand\r\ngranted; that the investiture of the kingdom was an affair that required\r\ndeliberation in a council of cardinals, but he would do all he possibly\r\ncould to induce them to accede to the king’s desire; lastly, he must\r\ndefer the affair of the sultan’s brother till a time more opportune for\r\ndiscussing it with the Sacred College, but would venture to say that, as\r\nthis surrender could not fail to be for the good of Christendom, as it\r\nwas demanded for the purpose of assuring further the success of a\r\ncrusade, it would not be his fault if on this point also the king should\r\nnot be satisfied.\r\n\r\nAt this reply, Charles bowed his head in sign of satisfaction, and the\r\nfirst president stood up, uncovered, and resumed his discourse as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\n\"Very Holy Father, it is an ancient custom among Christian kings,\r\nespecially the Most Christian kings of France, to signify, through their\r\nambassadors, the respect they feel for the Holy See and the sovereign\r\npontiffs whom Divine Providence places thereon; but the Most Christian\r\nking, having felt a desire to visit the tombs of the holy apostles, has\r\nbeen pleased to pay this religious debt, which he regards as a sacred\r\nduty, not by ambassadors or by delegates, but in his own person. This is\r\nwhy, Very Holy Father, His Majesty the King of France is here to\r\nacknowledge you as the true vicar of Christ, the legitimate successor of\r\nthe apostles St. Peter and St. Paul, and with promise and vow renders\r\nyou that filial and respectful devotion which the kings his predecessors\r\nhave been accustomed to promise and vow, devoting himself and all his\r\nstrength to the service of your Holiness and the interests of the Holy\r\nSee.\"\r\n\r\nThe pope arose with a joyful heart; for this oath, so publicly made,\r\nremoved all his fears about a council; so inclined from this moment to\r\nyield to the King of France anything he might choose to ask, he took him\r\nby his left hand and made him a short and friendly reply, dubbing him\r\nthe Church’s eldest son. The ceremony over, they left the hall, the pope\r\nalways holding the king’s hand in his, and in this way they walked as\r\nfar as the room where the sacred vestments are put off; the pope feigned\r\na wish to conduct the king to his own apartments, but the king would not\r\nsuffer this, and, embracing once more, they separated, each to retire to\r\nhis own domicile.\r\n\r\nThe king remained eight days longer at the Vatican, then returned to the\r\nPalazzo San Marco. During these eight days all his demands were debated\r\nand settled to his satisfaction. The Bishop of Mans was made cardinal;\r\nthe investiture of the kingdom of Naples was promised to the conqueror;\r\nlastly, it was agreed that on his departure the King of France should\r\nreceive from the pope’s hand the brother of the Emperor of\r\nConstantinople, for a sum of 120,000 livres. But—the pope, desiring to\r\nextend to the utmost the hospitality he had been bestowing, invited\r\nD’jem to dinner on the very day that he was to leave Rome with his new\r\nprotector.\r\n\r\nWhen the moment of departure arrived, Charles mounted his horse in full\r\narmour, and with a numerous and brilliant following made his way to the\r\nVatican; arrived at the door, he dismounted, and leaving his escort at\r\nthe Piazza of St. Peter, went up with a few gentlemen only. He found His\r\nHoliness waiting for him, with Cardinal Valentino on his right, and on\r\nhis left D’jem, who, as we said before, was dining with him, and round\r\nthe table thirteen cardinals. The king at once, bending on his knee,\r\ndemanded the pope’s benediction, and stooped to kiss his feet. But this\r\nAlexander would not suffer; he took him in his arms, and with the lips\r\nof a father and heart of an enemy, kissed him tenderly on his forehead.\r\nThen the pope introduced the son of Mahomet II, who was a fine young\r\nman, with something noble and regal in his air, presenting in his\r\nmagnificent oriental costume a great contrast in its fashion and\r\namplitude to the narrow, severe cut of the Christian apparel. D’jem\r\nadvanced to Charles without humility and without pride, and, like an\r\nemperor’s son treating with a king, kissed his hand and then his\r\nshoulder; then, turning towards the Holy Father, he said in Italian,\r\nwhich he spoke very well, that he entreated he would recommend him to\r\nthe young king, who was prepared to take him under his protection,\r\nassuring the pontiff that he should never have to repent giving him his\r\nliberty, and telling Charles that he hoped he might some day be proud of\r\nhim, if after taking Naples he carried out his intention of going on to\r\nGreece. These words were spoken with so much dignity and at the same\r\ntime with such gentleness, that the King of France loyally and frankly\r\ngrasped the young sultan’s hand, as though he were his\r\ncompanion-in-arms. Then Charles took a final farewell of the pope, and\r\nwent down to the piazza. There he was awaited by Cardinal Valentino, who\r\nwas about to accompany him, as we know, as a hostage, and who had\r\nremained behind to exchange a few words with his father. In a moment\r\nCaesar Borgia appeared, riding on a splendidly harnessed mule, and\r\nbehind him were led six magnificent horses, a present from the Holy\r\nFather to the King of France. Charles at once mounted one of these, to\r\ndo honour to the gift. The pope had just conferred on him, and leaving\r\nRome with the rest of his troops, pursued his way towards Marino, where\r\nhe arrived the same evening.\r\n\r\nHe learned there that Alfonso, belying his reputation as a clever\r\npolitician and great general, had just embarked with all his treasures\r\nin a flotilla of four galleys, leaving the care of the war and the\r\nmanagement of his kingdom to his son Ferdinand. Thus everything went\r\nwell for the triumphant march of Charles: the gates of towns opened of\r\nthemselves at his approach, his enemies fled without waiting for his\r\ncoming, and before he had fought a single battle he had won for himself\r\nthe surname of Conqueror.\r\n\r\nThe day after at dawn the army started once more, and after marching the\r\nwhole day, stopped in the evening at Velletri. There the king, who had\r\nbeen on horseback since the morning, with Cardinal Valentine and D’jem,\r\nleft the former at his lodging, and taking D’jem with him, went on to\r\nhis own. Then Caesar Borgia, who among the army baggage had twenty very\r\nheavy waggons of his own, had one of these opened, took out a splendid\r\ncabinet with the silver necessary for his table, and gave orders for his\r\nsupper to be prepared, as he had done the night before. Meanwhile, night\r\nhad come on, and he shut himself up in a private chamber, where,\r\nstripping off his cardinal’s costume, he put on a groom’s dress. Thanks\r\nto this disguise, he issued from the house that had been assigned for\r\nhis accommodation without being recognised, traversed the streets,\r\npassed through the gates, and gained the open country. Nearly half a\r\nleague outside the town, a servant awaited him with two swift horses.\r\nCaesar, who was an excellent rider, sprang to the saddle, and he and his\r\ncompanion at full gallop retraced the road to Rome, where they arrived\r\nat break of day. Caesar got down at the house of one Flores, auditor of\r\nthe rota, where he procured a fresh horse and suitable clothes; then he\r\nflew at once to his mother, who gave a cry of joy when she saw him; for\r\nso silent and mysterious was the cardinal for all the world beside, and\r\neven for her, that he had not said a word of his early return to Rome.\r\nThe cry of joy uttered by Rosa Vanozza when she beheld her son was far\r\nmore a cry of vengeance than of love. One evening, while everybody was\r\nat the rejoicings in the Vatican, when Charles VIII and Alexander VI\r\nwere swearing a friendship which neither of them felt, and exchanging\r\noaths that were broken beforehand, a messenger from Rosa Vanozza had\r\narrived with a letter to Caesar, in which she begged him to come at once\r\nto her house in the Via delta Longara. Caesar questioned the messenger,\r\nbut he only replied that he could tell him nothing, that he would learn\r\nall he cared to know from his mother’s own lips. So, as soon as he was\r\nat liberty, Caesar, in layman’s dress and wrapped in a large cloak,\r\nquitted the Vatican and made his way towards the church of Regina Coeli,\r\nin the neighbourhood of which, it will be remembered, was the house\r\nwhere the pope’s mistress lived.\r\n\r\nAs he approached his mother’s house, Caesar began to observe the signs\r\nof strange devastation. The street was scattered with the wreck of\r\nfurniture and strips of precious stuffs. As he arrived at the foot of\r\nthe little flight of steps that led to the entrance gate, he saw that\r\nthe windows were broken and the remains of torn curtains were fluttering\r\nin front of them. Not understanding what this disorder could mean, he\r\nrushed into the house and through several deserted and wrecked\r\napartments. At last, seeing light in one of the rooms, he went in, and\r\nthere found his mother sitting on the remains of a chest made of ebony\r\nall inlaid with ivory and silver. When she saw Caesar, she rose, pale\r\nand dishevelled, and pointing to the desolation around her, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Look, Caesar; behold the work of your new friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what does it mean, mother?\" asked the cardinal. \"Whence comes all\r\nthis disorder?\"\r\n\r\n\"From the serpent,\" replied Rosa Vanozza, gnashing her teeth,—\"from the\r\nserpent you have warmed in your bosom. He has bitten me, fearing no\r\ndoubt that his teeth would be broken on you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who has done this?\" cried Caesar. \"Tell me, and, by Heaven, mother, he\r\nshall pay, and pay indeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who?\" replied Rosa. \"King Charles VIII has done it, by the hands of his\r\nfaithful allies, the Swiss. It was well known that Melchior was away,\r\nand that I was living alone with a few wretched servants; so they came\r\nand broke in the doors, as though they were taking Rome by storm, and\r\nwhile Cardinal Valentino was making holiday with their master, they\r\npillaged his mother’s house, loading her with insults and outrages which\r\nno Turks or Saracens could possibly have improved upon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, very good, mother,\" said Caesar; \"be calm; blood shall wash\r\nout disgrace. Consider a moment; what we have lost is nothing compared\r\nwith what we might lose; and my father and I, you may be quite sure,\r\nwill give you back more than they have stolen from you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I ask for no promises,\" cried Rosa; \"I ask for revenge.\"\r\n\r\n\"My mother,\" said the cardinal, \"you shall be avenged, or I will lose\r\nthe name of son.\"\r\n\r\nHaving by these words reassured his mother, he took her to Lucrezia’s\r\npalace, which in consequence of her marriage with Pesaro was unoccupied,\r\nand himself returned to the Vatican, giving orders that his mother’s\r\nhouse should be refurnished more magnificently than before the disaster.\r\nThese orders were punctually executed, and it was among her new\r\nluxurious surroundings, but with the same hatred in her heart, that\r\nCaesar on this occasion found his mother. This feeling prompted her cry\r\nof joy when she saw him once more.\r\n\r\nThe mother and son exchanged a very few words; then Caesar, mounting on\r\nhorseback, went to the Vatican, whence as a hostage he had departed two\r\ndays before. Alexander, who knew of the flight beforehand, and not only\r\napproved, but as sovereign pontiff had previously absolved his son of\r\nthe perjury he was about to commit, received him joyfully, but all the\r\nsame advised him to lie concealed, as Charles in all probability would\r\nnot be slow to reclaim his hostage:\r\n\r\nIndeed, the next day, when the king got up, the absence of Cardinal\r\nValentino was observed, and as Charles was uneasy at not seeing him, he\r\nsent to inquire what had prevented his appearance. When the messenger\r\narrived at the house that Caesar had left the evening before, he learned\r\nthat he had gone out at nine o’clock in the evening and not returned\r\nsince. He went back with this news to the king, who at once suspected\r\nthat he had fled, and in the first flush of his anger let the whole army\r\nknow of his perjury. The soldiers then remembered the twenty waggons, so\r\nheavily laden, from one of which the cardinal, in the sight of all, had\r\nproduced such magnificent gold and silver plate; and never doubting that\r\nthe cargo of the others was equally precious, they fetched them down and\r\nbroke them to pieces; but inside they found nothing but stones and sand,\r\nwhich proved to the king that the flight had been planned a long time\r\nback, and incensed him doubly against the pope. So without loss of time\r\nhe despatched to Rome Philippe de Bresse, afterwards Duke of Savoy, with\r\norders to intimate to the Holy Father his displeasure at this conduct.\r\nBut the pope replied that he knew nothing whatever about his son’s\r\nflight, and expressed the sincerest regret to His Majesty, declaring\r\nthat he knew nothing of his whereabouts, but was certain that he was not\r\nin Rome. As a fact, the pope was speaking the truth this time, for\r\nCaesar had gone with Cardinal Orsino to one of his estates, and was\r\ntemporarily in hiding there. This reply was conveyed to Charles by two\r\nmessengers from the pope, the Bishops of Nepi and of Sutri, and the\r\npeople also sent an ambassador in their own behalf. He was Monsignore\r\nPorcari, dean of the rota, who was charged to communicate to the king\r\nthe displeasure of the Romans when they learned of the cardinal’s breach\r\nof faith. Little as Charles was disposed to content himself with empty\r\nwords, he had to turn his attention to more serious affairs; so he\r\ncontinued his march to Naples without stopping, arriving there on\r\nSunday, the 22nd of February, 1495.\r\n\r\nFour days later, the unlucky D’jem, who had fallen sick at Capua died at\r\nCastel Nuovo. When he was leaving, at the farewell banquet, Alexander\r\nhad tried on his guest the poison he intended to use so often later on\r\nupon his cardinals, and whose effects he was destined to feel\r\nhimself,—such is poetical justice. In this way the pope had secured a\r\ndouble haul; for, in his twofold speculation in this wretched young man,\r\nhe had sold him alive to Charles for 120,000 livres and sold him dead to\r\nBajazet for 300,00 ducats....\r\n\r\nBut there was a certain delay about the second payment; for the Turkish\r\nemperor, as we remember, was not bound to pay the price of fratricide\r\ntill he received the corpse, and by Charles’s order the corpse had been\r\nburied at Gaeta.\r\n\r\nWhen Caesar Borgia learned the news, he rightly supposed that the king\r\nwould be so busy settling himself in his new capital that he would have\r\ntoo much to think of to be worrying about him; so he went to Rome again,\r\nand, anxious to keep his promise to his mother, he signalised his return\r\nby a terrible vengeance.\r\n\r\nCardinal Valentino had in his service a certain Spaniard whom he had\r\nmade the chief of his bravoes; he was a man of five-and-thirty or forty,\r\nwhose whole life had been one long rebellion against society’s laws; he\r\nrecoiled from no action, provided only he could get his price. This Don\r\nMichele Correglia, who earned his celebrity for bloody deeds under the\r\nname of Michelotto, was just the man Caesar wanted; and whereas\r\nMichelotto felt an unbounded admiration for Caesar, Caesar had unlimited\r\nconfidence in Michelotto. It was to him the cardinal entrusted the\r\nexecution of one part of his vengeance; the other he kept for himself.\r\n\r\nDon Michele received orders to scour the Campagna and cut every French\r\nthroat he could find. He began his work at once; and very few days\r\nelapsed before he had obtained most satisfactory results: more than a\r\nhundred persons were robbed or assassinated, and among the last the son\r\nof Cardinal de St. Malo, who was on his way back to France, and on whom\r\nMichelotto found a sum of 3000 crowns.\r\n\r\nFor himself, Caesar reserved the Swiss; for it was the Swiss in\r\nparticular who had despoiled his mother’s house. The pope had in his\r\nservice about a hundred and fifty soldiers belonging to their nation,\r\nwho had settled their families in Rome, and had grown rich partly by\r\ntheir pay and partly in the exercise of various industries. The cardinal\r\nhad every one of them dismissed, with orders to quit Rome within\r\ntwenty-four hours and the Roman territories within three days. The poor\r\nwretches had all collected together to obey the order, with their wives\r\nand children and baggage, on the Piazza of St. Peter, when suddenly, by\r\nCardinal Valentino’s orders, they were hemmed in on all sides by two\r\nthousand Spaniards, who began to fire on them with their guns and charge\r\nthem with their sabres, while Caesar and his mother looked down upon the\r\ncarnage from a window. In this way they killed fifty or perhaps sixty;\r\nbut the rest coming up, made a charge at the assassins, and then,\r\nwithout suffering any loss, managed to beat a retreat to a house, where\r\nthey stood a siege, and made so valiant a defense that they gave the\r\npope time—he knew nothing of the author of this butchery—to send the\r\ncaptain of his guard to the rescue, who, with a strong detachment,\r\nsucceeded in getting nearly forty of them safely out of the town: the\r\nrest had been massacred on the piazza or killed in the house.\r\n\r\nBut this was no real and adequate revenge; for it did not touch Charles\r\nhimself, the sole author of all the troubles that the pope and his\r\nfamily had experienced during the last year. So Caesar soon abandoned\r\nvulgar schemes of this kind and busied himself with loftier concerns,\r\nbending all the force of his genius to restore the league of Italian\r\nprinces that had been broken by the defection of Sforza, the exile of\r\nPiero dei Medici, and the defeat of Alfonso. The enterprise was more\r\neasily accomplished than the pope could have anticipated. The Venetians\r\nwere very uneasy when Charles passed so near, and they trembled lest,\r\nwhen he was once master of Naples, he might conceive the idea of\r\nconquering the rest of Italy. Ludovico Sforza, on his side, was\r\nbeginning to tremble, seeing the rapidity with which the King of France\r\nhad dethroned the house of Aragon, lest he might not make much\r\ndifference between his allies and his enemies. Maximilian, for his part,\r\nwas only seeking an occasion to break the temporary peace which he had\r\ngranted for the sake of the concession made to him. Lastly, Ferdinand\r\nand Isabella were allies of the dethroned house. And so it came about\r\nthat all of them, for different reasons, felt a common fear, and were\r\nsoon in agreement as to the necessity of driving out Charles VIII, not\r\nonly from Naples, but from Italy, and pledged themselves to work\r\ntogether to this end, by every means in their power, by negotiations, by\r\ntrickery, or by actual force. The Florentines alone refused to take part\r\nin this general levy of arms, and remained faithful to their promises.\r\n\r\nAccording to the articles of the treaty agreed upon by the confederates,\r\nthe alliance was to last for five-and-twenty years, and had for\r\nostensible object the upholding of the majority of the pope, and the\r\ninterests of Christendom; and these preparations might well have been\r\ntaken for such as would precede a crusade against the Turks, if\r\nBajazet’s ambassador had not always been present at the deliberations,\r\nalthough the Christian princes could not have dared for very shame to\r\nadmit the, sultan by name into their league. Now the confederates had to\r\nset on foot an army of 30,000 horse and 20,000 infantry, and each of\r\nthem was taxed for a contingent; thus the pope was to furnish 4000\r\nhorse, Maximilian 6000, the King of Spain, the Duke of Milan, and the\r\nrepublic of Venice, 8000 each. Every confederate was, in addition to\r\nthis, to levy and equip 4000 infantry in the six weeks following the\r\nsignature of the treaty. The fleets were to be equipped by the Maritime\r\nStates; but any expenses they should incur later on were to be defrayed\r\nby all in equal shares.\r\n\r\nThe formation of this league was made public on the 12th of April, 1495,\r\nPalm Sunday, and in all the Italian States, especially at Rome, was made\r\nthe occasion of fetes and immense rejoicings. Almost as soon as the\r\npublicly known articles were announced the secret ones were put into\r\nexecution. These obliged Ferdinand and Isabella to send a fleet of sixty\r\ngalleys to Ischia, where Alfonso’s son had retired, with six hundred\r\nhorsemen on board and five thousand infantry, to help him to ascend the\r\nthrone once more. Those troops were to be put under the command of\r\nGonzalvo of Cordova, who had gained the reputation of the greatest\r\ngeneral in Europe after the taking of Granada. The Venetians with a\r\nfleet of forty galleys under the command of Antonio Grimani, were to\r\nattack all the French stations on the coast of Calabria and Naples. The\r\nDuke of Milan promised for his part to check all reinforcements as they\r\nshould arrive from France, and to drive the Duke of Orleans out of Asti.\r\n\r\nLastly, there was Maximilian, who had promised to make invasions on the\r\nfrontiers, and Bajazet, who was to help with money, ships, and soldiers\r\neither the Venetians or the Spaniards, according as he might be appealed\r\nto by Barberigo or by Ferdinand the Catholic.\r\n\r\nThis league was all the more disconcerting for Charles, because of the\r\nspeedy abatement of the enthusiasm that had hailed his first appearance.\r\nWhat had happened to him was what generally happens to a conqueror who\r\nhas more good luck than talent; instead of making himself a party among\r\nthe great Neapolitan and Calabrian vassals, whose roots would be\r\nembedded in the very soil, by confirming their privileges and augmenting\r\ntheir power, he had wounded their feelings by bestowing all the titles,\r\noffices, and fiefs on those alone who had followed him from France, so\r\nthat all the important positions in the kingdom were filled by\r\nstrangers.\r\n\r\nThe result was that just when the league was made known, Tropea and\r\nAmantea, which had been presented by Charles to the Seigneur de Precy,\r\nrose in revolt and hoisted the banner of Aragon; and the Spanish fleet\r\nhad only to present itself at Reggio, in Calabria, for the town to throw\r\nopen its gates, being more discontented with the new rule than the old;\r\nand Don Federiga, Alfonso’s brother and Ferdinand’s uncle, who had\r\nhitherto never quitted Brindisi, had only to appear at Tarentum to be\r\nreceived there as a liberator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES learned all this news at Naples, and, tired of his late\r\nconquests, which necessitated a labour in organisation for which he was\r\nquite unfitted, turned his eyes towards France, where victorious fetes\r\nand rejoicings were awaiting the victor’s return. So he yielded at the\r\nfirst breath of his advisers, and retraced his road to his kingdom,\r\nthreatened, as was said, by the Germans on the north and the Spaniards\r\non the south. Consequently, he appointed Gilbert de Montpensier, of the\r\nhouse of Bourbon, viceroy; d’Aubigny, of the Scotch Stuart family,\r\nlieutenant in Calabria; Etienne de Vese, commander at Gaeta; and Don\r\nJuliano, Gabriel de Montfaucon, Guillaume de Villeneuve, George de\r\nLilly, the bailiff of Vitry, and Graziano Guerra respectively governors\r\nof Sant’ Angelo, Manfredonia, Trani, Catanzaro, Aquila, and Sulmone;\r\nthen leaving behind in evidence of his claims the half of his Swiss, a\r\nparty of his Gascons, eight hundred French lances, and about five\r\nhundred Italian men-at-arms, the last under the command of the prefect\r\nof Rome, Prospero and Fabrizio Colonna, and Antonio Savelli, he left\r\nNaples on the 20th of May at two o’clock in the afternoon, to traverse\r\nthe whole of the Italian peninsula with the rest of his army, consisting\r\nof eight hundred French lances, two hundred gentlemen of his guard, one\r\nhundred Italian men-at-arms, three thousand Swiss infantry, one thousand\r\nFrench and one thousand Gascon. He also expected to be joined by Camillo\r\nVitelli and his brothers in Tuscany, who were to contribute two hundred\r\nand fifty men-at-arms.\r\n\r\nA week before he left Naples, Charles had sent to Rome Monseigneur de\r\nSaint-Paul, brother of Cardinal de Luxembourg; and just as he was\r\nstarting he despatched thither the new Archbishop of Lyons. They both\r\nwere commissioned to assure Alexander that the King of France had the\r\nmost sincere desire and the very best intention of remaining his friend.\r\nIn truth, Charles wished for nothing so much as to separate the pope\r\nfrom the league, so as to secure him as a spiritual and temporal\r\nsupport; but a young king, full of fire, ambition, and courage, was not\r\nthe neighbour to suit Alexander; so the latter would listen to nothing,\r\nand as the troops he had demanded from the doge and Ludavico Sforza had\r\nnot been sent in sufficient number for the defense of Rome, he was\r\ncontent with provisioning the castle of S. Angelo, putting in a\r\nformidable garrison, and leaving Cardinal Sant’ Anastasio to receive\r\nCharles while he himself withdrew with Caesar to Orvieto. Charles only\r\nstayed in Rome three days, utterly depressed because the pope had\r\nrefused to receive him in spite of his entreaties. And in these three\r\ndays, instead of listening to Giuliano delta Rovere, who was advising\r\nhim once more to call a council and depose the pope, he rather hoped to\r\nbring the pope round to his side by the virtuous act of restoring the\r\ncitadels of Terracina and Civita Vecchia to the authorities of the\r\nRomagna, only keeping for himself Ostia, which he had promised Giuliano\r\nto give back to him. At last, when the three days had elapsed, he left\r\nRome, and resumed his march in three columns towards Tuscany, crossed\r\nthe States of the Church, and on the 13th reached Siena, where he was\r\njoined by Philippe de Commines, who had gone as ambassador extraordinary\r\nto the Venetian Republic, and now announced that the enemy had forty\r\nthousand men under arms and were preparing for battle. This news\r\nproduced no other effect on the king and the gentlemen of his army than\r\nto excite their amusement beyond measure; for they had conceived such a\r\ncontempt for their enemy by their easy conquest, that they could not\r\nbelieve that any army, however numerous, would venture to oppose their\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nCharles, however, was forced to give way in the face of facts, when he\r\nheard at San Teranza that his vanguard, commanded by Marechal de Gie,\r\nand composed of six hundred lances and fifteen hundred Swiss, when it\r\narrived at Fornova had come face to face with the confederates, who had\r\nencamped at Guiarole. The marechal had ordered an instant halt, and he\r\ntoo had pitched his tents, utilising for his defence the natural\r\nadvantages of the hilly ground. When these first measures had been\r\ntaken, he sent out, first, a herald to the enemy’s camp to ask from\r\nFrancesco di Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua, generalissimo of the\r\nconfederate troops, a passage for his king’s army and provisions at a\r\nreasonable price; and secondly, he despatched a courier to Charles VIII,\r\npressing him to hurry on his march with the artillery and rearguard. The\r\nconfederates had given an evasive answer, for they were pondering\r\nwhether they ought to jeopardise the whole Italian force in a single\r\ncombat, and, putting all to the hazard, attempt to annihilate the King\r\nof France and his army together, so overwhelming the conqueror in the\r\nruins of his ambition. The messenger found Charles busy superintending\r\nthe passage of the last of his cannon over the mountain of Pontremoli.\r\nThis was no easy matter, seeing that there was no sort of track, and the\r\nguns had to be lifted up and lowered by main farce, and each piece\r\nneeded the arms of as many as two hundred men. At last, when all the\r\nartillery had arrived without accident on the other side of the\r\nApennines, Charles started in hot haste for Fornovd, where he arrived\r\nwith all his following on the morning of the next day.\r\n\r\nFrom the top of the mountain where the Marechal de Gie had pitched his\r\ntents, the king beheld both his own camp and the enemy’s. Both were on\r\nthe right bank of the Taro, and were at either end of a semicircular\r\nchain of hills resembling an amphitheatre; and the space between the two\r\ncamps, a vast basin filled during the winter floods by the torrent which\r\nnow only marked its boundary, was nothing but a plain covered with\r\ngravel, where all manoeuvres must be equally difficult for horse and\r\ninfantry. Besides, on the western slope of the hills there was a little\r\nwood which extended from the enemy’s army to the French, and was in the\r\npossession of the Stradiotes, who, by help of its cover, had already\r\nengaged in several skirmishes with the French troops during the two days\r\nof halt while they were waiting for the king.\r\n\r\nThe situation was not reassuring. From the top of the mountain which\r\noverlooked Fornovo, one could get a view, as we said before, of the two\r\ncamps, and could easily calculate the numerical difference between them.\r\nThe French army, weakened by the establishment of garrisons in the\r\nvarious towns and fortresses they had won in Italy, were scarcely eight\r\nthousand strong, while the combined forces of Milan and Venice exceeded\r\na total of thirty-five thousand. So Charles decided to try once more the\r\nmethods of conciliation, and sent Commines, who, as we know, had joined\r\nhim in Tuscany, to the Venetian ’proveditori’, whose acquaintance he had\r\nmade when on his embassy; he having made a great impression on these\r\nmen, thanks to a general high opinion of his merits. He was commissioned\r\nto tell the enemy’s generals, in the name of the King of France, that\r\nhis master only desired to continue his road without doing or receiving\r\nany harm; that therefore he asked to be allowed a free passage across\r\nthe fair plains of Lombardy, which he could see from the heights where\r\nhe now stood, stretching as far as the eye could reach, away to the foot\r\nof the Alps. Commines found the confederate army deep in discussion: the\r\nwish of the Milanese and Venetian party being to let the king go by, and\r\nnot attack him; they said they were only too happy that he should leave\r\nItaly in this way, without causing any further harm; but the ambassadors\r\nof Spain and Germany took quite another view. As their masters had no\r\ntroops in the army, and as all the money they had promised was already\r\npaid, they must be the gainer in either case from a battle, whichever\r\nway it went: if they won the day they would gather the fruits of\r\nvictory, and if they lost they would experience nothing of the evils of\r\ndefeat. This want of unanimity was the reason why the answer to Commines\r\nwas deferred until the following day, and why it was settled that on the\r\nnext day he should hold another conference with a plenipotentiary to be\r\nappointed in the course of that night. The place of this conference was\r\nto be between the two armies.\r\n\r\nThe king passed the night in great uneasiness. All day the weather had\r\nthreatened to turn to rain, and we have already said how rapidly the\r\nTaro could swell; the river, fordable to-day, might from tomorrow\r\nonwards prove an insurmountable obstacle; and possibly the delay had\r\nonly been asked for with a view to putting the French army in a worse\r\nposition. As a fact the night had scarcely come when a terrible storm\r\narose, and so long as darkness lasted, great rumblings were heard in the\r\nApennines, and the sky was brilliant with lightning. At break of day,\r\nhowever, it seemed to be getting a little calmer, though the Taro, only\r\na streamlet the day before, had become a torrent by this time, and was\r\nrapidly rising. So at six in the morning, the king, ready armed and on\r\nhorseback, summoned Commines and bade him make his way to the rendezvous\r\nthat the Venetian ’proveditori’ had assigned. But scarcely had he\r\ncontrived to give the order when loud cries were heard coming from the\r\nextreme right of the French army. The Stradiotes, under cover of the\r\nwood stretching between the two camps, had surprised an outpost, and\r\nfirst cutting the soldiers’ throats, were carrying off their heads in\r\ntheir usual way at the saddle-bow. A detachment of cavalry was sent in\r\npursuit; but, like wild animals, they had retreated to their lair in the\r\nwoods, and there disappeared.\r\n\r\nThis unexpected engagement, in all probability arranged beforehand by\r\nthe Spanish and German envoys, produced on the whole army the effect of\r\na spark applied to a train of gunpowder. Commines and the Venetian\r\n’proveditori’ each tried in vain to arrest the combat an either side.\r\nLight troops, eager for a skirmish, and, in the usual fashion of those\r\ndays, prompted only by that personal courage which led them on to\r\ndanger, had already come to blows, rushing down into the plain as though\r\nit were an amphitheatre where they might make a fine display of arms.\r\nFor a moment the young king, drawn on by example, was an the point of\r\nforgetting the responsibility of a general in his zeal as a soldier; but\r\nthis first impulse was checked by Marechal de Gie, Messire Claude de la\r\nChatre de Guise, and M. de la Trimauille, who persuaded Charles to adopt\r\nthe wiser plan, and to cross the Taro without seeking a battle,—at the\r\nsame time without trying to avoid it, should the enemy cross the river\r\nfrom their camp and attempt to block his passage. The king accordingly,\r\nfollowing the advice of his wisest and bravest captains, thus arranged\r\nhis divisions.\r\n\r\nThe first comprised the van and a body of troops whose duty it was to\r\nsupport them. The van consisted of three hundred and fifty men-at-arms,\r\nthe best and bravest of the army, under the command of Marechal de Gie\r\nand Jacques Trivulce; the corps following them consisted of three\r\nthousand Swiss, under the command of Engelbert der Cleves and de Larnay,\r\nthe queen’s grand equerry; next came three hundred archers of the guard,\r\nwhom the king had sent to help the cavalry by fighting in the spaces\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nThe second division, commanded by the king in person and forming the\r\nmiddle of the army, was composed of the artillery, under Jean de\r\nLagrange, a hundred gentlemen of the guard with Gilles Carrone for\r\nstandard-bearer, pensioners of the king’s household under Aymar de Prie,\r\nsome Scots, and two hundred cross-bowmen on horseback, with French\r\narchers besides, led by M. de Crussol.\r\n\r\nLastly, the third division, i.e. the rear, preceded by six thousand\r\nbeasts of burden bearing the baggage, was composed of only three hundred\r\nmen-at-arms, commanded by de Guise and by de la Trimouille: this was the\r\nweakest part of the army.\r\n\r\nWhen this arrangement was settled, Charles ordered the van to cross the\r\nriver, just at the little town of Fornovo. This was done at once, the\r\nriders getting wet up to their knees, and the footmen holding to the\r\nhorses’ tails. As soon as he saw the last soldiers of his first division\r\non the opposite bank, he started himself to follow the same road and\r\ncross at the same ford, giving orders to de Guise and de la Trimouille\r\nto regulate the march of the rear guard by that of the centre, just as\r\nhe had regulated their march by that of the van. His orders were\r\npunctually carried out; and about ten o’clock in the morning the whole\r\nFrench army was on the left bank of the Taro: at the same time, when it\r\nseemed certain from the enemy’s arrangements that battle was imminent,\r\nthe baggage, led by the captain, Odet de Reberac, was separated from the\r\nrear guard, and retired to the extreme left.\r\n\r\nNow, Francisco de Gonzaga, general-in-chief of the confederate troops,\r\nhad modelled his plans on those of the King of France; by his orders,\r\nCount de Cajazzo, with four hundred men-at-arms and two thousand\r\ninfantry, had crossed the Taro where the Venetian camp lay, and was to\r\nattack the French van; while Gonzaga himself, following the right bank\r\nas far as Fornovo, would go over the river by the same ford that Charles\r\nhad used, with a view to attacking his rear. Lastly, he had placed the\r\nStradiotes between these two fords, with orders to cross the river in\r\ntheir turn, so soon as they saw the French army attacked both in van and\r\nin the rear, and to fall upon its flank. Not content with offensive\r\nmeasures, Gonzaga had also made provision for retreat by leaving three\r\nreserve corps on the right bank, one to guard the camp under the\r\ninstruction of the Venetian ’provveditori’, and the other two arranged\r\nin echelon to support each other, the first commanded by Antonio di\r\nMontefeltro, the second by Annibale Bentivoglio.\r\n\r\nCharles had observed all these arrangements, and had recognised the\r\ncunning Italian strategy which made his opponents the finest generals in\r\nthe world; but as there was no means of avoiding the danger, he had\r\ndecided to take a sideway course, and had given orders to continue the\r\nmatch; but in a minute the French army was caught between Count di\r\nCajazzo, barring the way with his four hundred men-at-arms and his two\r\nthousand infantry, and Gonzaga in pursuit of the rear, as we said\r\nbefore; leading six hundred men-at-arms, the flower of his army, a\r\nsquadron of Stradiotes, and more than five thousand infantry: this\r\ndivision alone was stronger than the whole of the French army.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, M. de Guise and M. de la Trimouille found themselves\r\npressed in this way, they ordered their two hundred men-at-arms to turn\r\nright about face, while at the opposite end—that is, at the head of the\r\narmy-Marechal de Gie and Trivulce ordered a halt and lances in rest.\r\nMeanwhile, according to custom, the king, who, as we said, was in the\r\ncentre, was conferring knighthood on those gentlemen who had earned the\r\nfavour either by virtue of their personal powers or the king’s special\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was heard a terrible clash behind it was the French\r\nrearguard coming to blows with the Marquis of Mantua. In this encounter,\r\nwhere each man had singled out his own foe as though it were a\r\ntournament, very many lances were broken, especially those of the\r\nItalian knights; for their lances were hollowed so as to be less heavy,\r\nand in consequence had less solidity. Those who were thus disarmed at\r\nonce seized their swords. As they were far more numerous than the\r\nFrench, the king saw them suddenly outflanking his right wing and\r\napparently prepared to surround it; at the same moment loud cries were\r\nheard from a direction facing the centre: this meant that the Stradiotes\r\nwere crossing the river to make their attack.\r\n\r\nThe king at once ordered his division into two detachments, and giving\r\none to Bourbon the bastard, to make head against the Stradiotes, he\r\nhurried with the second to the rescue of the van, flinging himself into\r\nthe very midst of the melee, striking out like a king, and doing as\r\nsteady work as the lowest in rank of his captains. Aided by the\r\nreinforcement, the rearguard made a good stand, though the enemy were\r\nfive against one, and the combat in this part continued to rage with\r\nwonderful fury.\r\n\r\nObeying his orders, Bourbon had thrown himself upon the Stradiotes; but\r\nunfortunately, carried off by his horse, he had penetrated so far into\r\nthe enemy’s ranks that he was lost to sight: the disappearance of their\r\nchief, the strange dress of their new antagonists, and the peculiar\r\nmethod of their fighting produced a considerable effect on those who\r\nwere to attack them; and for the moment disorder was the consequence in\r\nthe centre, and the horse men scattered instead of serrying their ranks\r\nand fighting in a body. This false move would have done them serious\r\nharm, had not most of the Stradiotes, seeing the baggage alone and\r\nundefended, rushed after that in hope of booty, instead of following up\r\ntheir advantage. A great part of the troop nevertheless stayed behind to\r\nfight, pressing on the French cavalry and smashing their lances with\r\ntheir fearful scimitars. Happily the king, who had just repulsed the\r\nMarquis of Mantua’s attack, perceived what was going on behind him, and\r\nriding back at all possible speed to the succour of the centre, together\r\nwith the gentlemen of his household fell upon the Stradiotes, no longer\r\narmed with a lance, for that he had just broken, but brandishing his\r\nlong sword, which blazed about him like lightning, and—either because he\r\nwas whirled away like Bourbon by his own horse, or because he had\r\nallowed his courage to take him too far—he suddenly found himself in the\r\nthickest ranks of the Stradiotes, accompanied only by eight of the\r\nknights he had just now created, one equerry called Antoine des Ambus,\r\nand his standard-bearer. \"France, France!\" he cried aloud, to rally\r\nround him all the others who had scattered; they, seeing at last that\r\nthe danger was less than they had supposed, began to take their revenge\r\nand to pay back with interest the blows they had received from the\r\nStradiotes. Things were going still better, for the van, which the\r\nMarquis de Cajazzo was to attack; for although he had at first appeared\r\nto be animated with a terrible purpose, he stopped short about ten or\r\ntwelve feet from the French line and turned right about face without\r\nbreaking a single lance. The French wanted to pursue, but the Marechal\r\nde Gie, fearing that this flight might be only a trick to draw off the\r\nvanguard from the centre, ordered every man to stay in his place. But\r\nthe Swiss, who were German, and did not understand the order, or thought\r\nit was not meant for them, followed upon their heels, and although on\r\nfoot caught them up and killed a hundred of them. This was quite enough\r\nto throw them into disorder, so that some were scattered about the\r\nplain, and others made a rush for the water, so as to cross the river\r\nand rejoin their camp.\r\n\r\nWhen the Marechal de Gie saw this, he detached a hundred of his own men\r\nto go to the aid of the king, who was continuing to fight with\r\nunheard-of courage and running the greatest risks, constantly separated\r\nas he was from his gentlemen, who could not follow him; for wherever\r\nthere was danger, thither he rushed, with his cry of \"France,\" little\r\ntroubling himself as to whether he was followed or not. And it was no\r\nlonger with his sword that he fought; that he had long ago broken, like\r\nhis lance, but with a heavy battle-axe, whose every blow was mortal\r\nwhether cut or pierced. Thus the Stradiotes, already hard pressed by the\r\nking’s household and his pensioners, soon changed attack for defence and\r\ndefence for flight. It was at this moment that the king was really in\r\nthe greatest danger; for he had let himself be carried away in pursuit\r\nof the fugitives, and presently found himself all alone, surrounded by\r\nthese men, who, had they not been struck with a mighty terror, would\r\nhave had nothing to do but unite and crush him and his horse together;\r\nbut, as Commines remarks, \"He whom God guards is well guarded, and God\r\nwas guarding the King of France.\"\r\n\r\nAll the same, at this moment the French were sorely pressed in the rear;\r\nand although de Guise and de la Trimouille held out as firmly as it was\r\npossible to hold, they would probably have been compelled to yield to\r\nsuperior numbers had not a double aid arrived in time: first the\r\nindefatigable Charles, who, having nothing more to do among the\r\nfugitives, once again dashed into the midst of the fight, next the\r\nservants of the army, who, now that they were set free from the\r\nStradiotes and saw their enemies put to flight, ran up armed with the\r\naxes they habitually used to cut down wood for building their huts: they\r\nburst into the middle of the fray, slashing at the horses’ legs and\r\ndealing heavy blows that smashed in the visors of the dismounted\r\nhorsemen.\r\n\r\nThe Italians could not hold out against this double attack; the ’furia\r\nfrancese’ rendered all their strategy and all their calculations\r\nuseless, especially as for more than a century they had abandoned their\r\nfights of blood and fury for a kind of tournament they chose to regard\r\nas warfare; so, in spite of all Gonzaga’s efforts, they turned their\r\nbacks upon the French rear and took to flight; in the greatest haste and\r\nwith much difficulty they recrossed the torrent, which was swollen even\r\nmore now by the rain that had been falling during the whole time of the\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nSome thought fit to pursue the vanquished, for there was now such\r\ndisorder in their ranks that they were fleeing in all directions from\r\nthe battlefield where the French had gained so glorious a victory,\r\nblocking up the roads to Parma and Bercetto. But Marechal de Gie and de\r\nGuise and de la Trimouille, who had done quite enough to save them from\r\nthe suspicion of quailing before imaginary dangers, put a stop to this\r\nenthusiasm, by pointing out that it would only be risking the loss of\r\ntheir present advantage if they tried to push it farther with men and\r\nhorses so worn out. This view was adopted in spite of the opinion of\r\nTrivulce, Camillo Vitelli, and Francesco Secco, who were all eager to\r\nfollow up the victory.\r\n\r\nThe king retired to a little village on the left bank of the Taro, and\r\ntook shelter in a poor house. There he disarmed, being perhaps among all\r\nthe captains and all the soldiers the man who had fought best.\r\n\r\nDuring the night the torrent swelled so high that the Italian army could\r\nnot have pursued, even if they had laid aside their fears. The king did\r\nnot propose to give the appearance of flight after a victory, and\r\ntherefore kept his army drawn up all day, and at night went on to sleep\r\nat Medesano, a little village only a mile lower down than the hamlet\r\nwhere he rested after the fight. But in the course of the night he\r\nreflected that he had done enough for the honour of his arms in fighting\r\nan army four times as great as his own and killing three thousand men,\r\nand then waiting a day and a half to give them time to take their\r\nrevenge; so two hours before daybreak he had the fires lighted, that the\r\nenemy might suppose he was remaining in camp; and every man mounting\r\nnoiselessly, the whole French army, almost out of danger by this time,\r\nproceeded on their march to Borgo San Donnino.\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on, the pope returned to Rome, where news highly\r\nfavourable to his schemes was not slow to reach his ears. He learned\r\nthat Ferdinand had crossed from Sicily into Calabria with six thousand\r\nvolunteers and a considerable number of Spanish horse and foot, led, at\r\nthe command of Ferdinand and Isabella, by the famous Gonzalva de\r\nCordova, who arrived in Italy with a great reputation, destined to\r\nsuffer somewhat from the defeat at Seminara. At almost the same time the\r\nFrench fleet had been beaten by the Aragonese; moreover, the battle of\r\nthe Taro, though a complete defeat for the confederates, was another\r\nvictory for the pope, because its result was to open a return to France\r\nfor that man whom he regarded as his deadliest foe. So, feeling that he\r\nhad nothing more to fear from Charles, he sent him a brief at Turin,\r\nwhere he had stopped for a short time to give aid to Novara, therein\r\ncommanding him, by virtue of his pontifical authority, to depart out of\r\nItaly with his army, and to recall within ten days those of his troops\r\nthat still remained in the kingdom of Naples, on pain of\r\nexcommunication, and a summons to appear before him in person.\r\n\r\nCharles VIII replied:\r\n\r\n  (1) That he did not understand how the pope, the chief of the league,\r\n      ordered him to leave Italy, whereas the confederates had not only\r\n      refused him a passage, but had even attempted, though\r\n      unsuccessfully, as perhaps His Holiness knew, to cut off his\r\n      return into France;\r\n  (2) That, as to recalling his troops from Naples, he was not so\r\n      irreligious as to do that, since they had not entered the kingdom\r\n      without the consent and blessing of His Holiness;\r\n  (3) That he was exceedingly surprised that the pope should require his\r\n      presence in person at the capital of the Christian world just at\r\n      the present time, when six weeks previously, at the time of his\r\n      return from Naples, although he ardently desired an interview with\r\n      His Holiness, that he might offer proofs of his respect and\r\n      obedience, His Holiness, instead of according this favour, had\r\n      quitted Rome so hastily on his approach that he had not been able\r\n      to come up with him by any efforts whatsoever. On this point,\r\n      however, he promised to give His Holiness the satisfaction he\r\n      desired, if he would engage this time to wait for him: he would\r\n      therefore return to Rome so soon as the affairs that brought him\r\n      back to his own kingdom had been satisfactorily, settled.\r\n\r\nAlthough in this reply there was a touch of mockery and defiance,\r\nCharles was none the less compelled by the circumstances of the case to\r\nobey the pope’s strange brief. His presence was so much needed in France\r\nthat, in spite of the arrival of a Swiss reinforcement, he was compelled\r\nto conclude a peace with Ludovico Sforza, whereby he yielded Novara to\r\nhim; while Gilbert de Montpensier and d’Aubigny, after defending, inch\r\nby inch, Calabria, the Basilicate, and Naples, were obliged to sign the\r\ncapitulation of Atella, after a siege of thirty-two days, on the 20th of\r\nJuly, 1496. This involved giving back to Ferdinand II, King of Naples,\r\nall the palaces and fortresses of his kingdom; which indeed he did but\r\nenjoy for three months, dying of exhaustion on the 7th of September\r\nfollowing, at the Castello della Somma, at the foot of Vesuvius; all the\r\nattentions lavished upon him by his young wife could not repair the evil\r\nthat her beauty had wrought.\r\n\r\nHis uncle Frederic succeeded; and so, in the three years of his papacy,\r\nAlexander VI had seen five kings upon the throne of Naples, while he was\r\nestablishing himself more firmly upon his own pontifical seat—Ferdinand\r\nI, Alfonso I, Charles VIII, Ferdinand II, and Frederic. All this\r\nagitation about his throne, this rapid succession of sovereigns, was the\r\nbest thing possible for Alexander; for each new monarch became actually\r\nking only on condition of his receiving the pontifical investiture. The\r\nconsequence was that Alexander was the only gainer in power and credit\r\nby these changes; for the Duke of Milan and the republics of Florence\r\nand Venice had successively recognised him as supreme head of the\r\nChurch, in spite of his simony; moreover, the five kings of Naples had\r\nin turn paid him homage. So he thought the time had now come for\r\nfounding a mighty family; and for this he relied upon the Duke of\r\nGandia, who was to hold all the highest temporal dignities; and upon\r\nCaesar Borgia, who was to be appointed to all the great ecclesiastical\r\noffices. The pope made sure of the success of these new projects by\r\nelecting four Spanish cardinals, who brought up the number of his\r\ncompatriots in the Sacred College to twenty-two, thus assuring him a\r\nconstant and certain majority.\r\n\r\nThe first requirement of the pope’s policy was to clear away from the\r\nneighbourhood of Rome all those petty lords whom most people call vicars\r\nof the Church, but whom Alexander called the shackles of the papacy. We\r\nsaw that he had already begun this work by rousing the Orsini against\r\nthe Colonna family, when Charles VIII’s enterprise compelled him to\r\nconcentrate all his mental resources, and also the forces of his States,\r\nso as to secure his own personal safety.\r\n\r\nIt had come about through their own imprudent action that the Orsini,\r\nthe pope’s old friends, were now in the pay of the French, and had\r\nentered the kingdom of Naples with them, where one of them, Virginio, a\r\nvery important member of their powerful house, had been taken prisoner\r\nduring the war, and was Ferdinand II’s captive. Alexander could not let\r\nthis opportunity escape him; so, first ordering the King of Naples not\r\nto release a man who, ever since the 1st of June, 1496, had been a\r\ndeclared rebel, he pronounced a sentence of confiscation against\r\nVirginio Orsini and his whole family in a secret consistory, which sat\r\non the 26th of October following—that is to say, in the early days of\r\nthe reign of Frederic, whom he knew to be entirely at his command, owing\r\nto the King’s great desire of getting the investiture from him; then, as\r\nit was not enough to declare the goods confiscated, without also\r\ndispossessing the owners, he made overtures to the Colonna family,\r\nsaying he would commission them, in proof of their new bond of\r\nfriendship, to execute the order given against their old enemies under\r\nthe direction of his son Francesco, Duke of Gandia. In this fashion he\r\ncontrived to weaken his neighbours each by means of the other, till such\r\ntime as he could safely attack and put an end to conquered and conqueror\r\nalike.\r\n\r\nThe Colonna family accepted this proposition, and the Duke of Gandia was\r\nnamed General of the Church: his father in his pontifical robes bestowed\r\non him the insignia of this office in the church of St. Peter’s at Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nMatters went forward as Alexander had wished, and before the end of the\r\nyear the pontifical army had, seized a great number of castles and\r\nfortresses that belonged to the Orsini, who thought themselves already\r\nlost when Charles VIII came to the rescue. They had addressed themselves\r\nto him without much hope that he could be of real use to them, with his\r\nwant of armed troops and his preoccupation with his own affairs. He,\r\nhowever, sent Carlo Orsini, son of Virginio, the prisoner, and\r\nVitellozzo Vitelli, brother of Camillo Vitelli, one of the three valiant\r\nItalian condottieri who had joined him and fought for him at the\r\ncrossing of the Taro: These two captains, whose courage and skill were\r\nwell known, brought with them a considerable sum of money from the\r\nliberal coffers of Charles VIII. Now, scarcely had they arrived at Citta\r\ndi Castello, the centre of their little sovereignty, and expressed their\r\nintention of raising a band of soldiers, when men presented themselves\r\nfrom all sides to fight under their banner; so they very soon assembled\r\na small army, and as they had been able during their stay among the\r\nFrench to study those matters of military organisation in which France\r\nexcelled, they now applied the result of their learning to their own\r\ntroops: the improvements were mainly certain changes in the artillery\r\nwhich made their manoeuvres easier, and the substitution for their\r\nordinary weapons of pikes similar in form to the Swiss pikes, but two\r\nfeet longer. These changes effected, Vitellozzo Vitelli spent three or\r\nfour months in exercising his men in the management of their new\r\nweapons; then, when he thought them fit to make good use of these, and\r\nwhen he had collected more or less help from the towns of Perugia, Todi,\r\nand Narni, where the inhabitants trembled lest their turn should come\r\nafter the Orsini’s, as the Orsini’s had followed on the Colonnas’, he\r\nmarched towards Braccianno, which was being besieged by the Duke of\r\nUrbino, who had been lent to the pope by the Venetians, in virtue of the\r\ntreaty quoted above.\r\n\r\nThe Venetian general, when he heard of Vitelli’s approach, thought he\r\nmight as well spare him half his journey, and marched out to confront\r\nhim: the two armies met in the Soriano road, and the battle straightway\r\nbegan. The pontifical army had a body of eight hundred Germans, on which\r\nthe Dukes of Urbino and Gandia chiefly relied, as well they might, for\r\nthey were the best troops in the world; but Vitelli attacked these\r\npicked men with his infantry, who, armed with their formidable pikes,\r\nran them through, while they with arms four feet shorter had no chance\r\neven of returning the blows they received; at the same time Vitelli’s\r\nlight troops wheeled upon the flank, following their most rapid\r\nmovements, and silencing the enemy’s artillery by the swiftness and\r\naccuracy of their attack. The pontifical troops were put to flight,\r\nthough after a longer resistance than might have been expected when they\r\nhad to sustain the attack of an army so much better equipped than their\r\nown; with them they bore to Ronciglione the Duke of Gandia, wounded in\r\nthe face by a pike-thrust, Fabrizia Calonna, and the envoy; the Duke of\r\nUrbino, who was fighting in the rear to aid the retreat, was taken\r\nprisoner with all his artillery and the baggage of the conquered army.\r\nBut this success, great as it was, did not so swell the pride of\r\nVitellozza Vitelli as to make him oblivious of his position. He knew\r\nthat he and the Orsini together were too weak to sustain a war of such\r\nmagnitude; that the little store of money to which he owed the existence\r\nof his army would very soon be expended and his army would disappear\r\nwith it. So he hastened to get pardoned for the victory by making\r\npropositions which he would very likely have refused had he been the\r\nvanquished party; and the pope accepted his conditions without demur;\r\nduring the interval having heard that Trivulce had just recrossed the\r\nAlps and re-entered Italy with three thousand Swiss, and fearing lest\r\nthe Italian general might only be the advance guard of the King of\r\nFrance. So it was settled that the Orsini should pay 70,000 florins for\r\nthe expenses of the war, and that all the prisoners on both sides should\r\nbe exchanged without ransom with the single exception of the Duke of\r\nUrbino. As a pledge for the future payment of the 70,000 florins, the\r\nOrsini handed over to the Cardinals Sforza and San Severino the\r\nfortresses of Anguillara and Cervetri; then, when the day came and they\r\nhad not the necessary money, they gave up their prisoner, the Duke of\r\nUrbino, estimating his worth at 40,000 ducats—nearly all the sum\r\nrequired—and handed him over to Alexander on account; he, a rigid\r\nobserver of engagements, made his own general, taken prisoner in his\r\nservice, pay, to himself the ransom he owed to the enemy.\r\n\r\nThen the pope had the corpse of Virginio sent to Carlo Orsini and\r\nVitellozzo Vitelli, as he could not send him alive. By a strange\r\nfatality the prisoner had died, eight days before the treaty was signed,\r\nof the same malady—at least, if we may judge by analogy—that had carried\r\noff Bajazet’s brother.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the peace was signed, Prospero Calonna and Gonzalvo de\r\nCordova, whom the Pope had demanded from Frederic, arrived at Rome with\r\nan army of Spanish and Neapolitan troops. Alexander, as he could not\r\nutilise these against the Orsini, set them the work of recapturing\r\nOstia, not desiring to incur the reproach of bringing them to Rome for\r\nnothing. Gonzalvo was rewarded for this feat by receiving the Rose of\r\nGold from the pope’s hand—that being the highest honour His Holiness can\r\ngrant. He shared this distinction with the Emperor Maximilian, the King\r\nof France, the Doge of Venice, and the Marquis of Mantua.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all this occurred the solemn festival of the Assumption;\r\nin which Ganzalvo was invited to take part. He accordingly left his\r\npalace, proceeded in great pomp in the front of the pontifical cavalry,\r\nand took his place on the Duke of Gandia’s left hand. The duke attracted\r\nall eyes by his personal beauty, set off as it was by all the luxury he\r\nthought fit to display at this festival. He had a retinue of pages and\r\nservants, clad in sumptuous liveries, incomparable for richness with\r\nanything heretofore seen in Rome, that city of religious pomp. All these\r\npages and servants rode magnificent horses, caparisoned in velvet\r\ntrimmed with silver fringe, and bells of silver hanging down every here\r\nand there. He himself was in a robe of gold brocade, and wore at his\r\nneck a string of Eastern pearls, perhaps the finest and largest that\r\never belonged to a Christian prince, while on his cap was a gold chain\r\nstudded with diamonds of which the smallest was worth more than 20,000\r\nducats. This magnificence was all the more conspicuous by the contrast\r\nit presented to Caesar’s dress, whose scarlet robe admitted of no\r\nornaments. The result was that Caesar, doubly jealous of his brother,\r\nfelt a new hatred rise up within him when he heard all along the way the\r\npraises of his fine appearance and noble equipment. From this moment\r\nCardinal Valentino decided in his own mind the fate of this man, this\r\nconstant obstacle in the path of his pride, his love, and his ambition.\r\nVery good reason, says Tommaso, the historian, had the Duke of Gandia to\r\nleave behind him an impression on the public mind of his beauty and his\r\ngrandeur at this fete, for this last display was soon to be followed by\r\nthe obsequies of the unhappy young man.\r\n\r\nLucrezia also had come to Rome, on the pretext of taking part in the\r\nsolemnity, but really, as we shall see later, with the view of serving\r\nas a new instrument for her father’s ambition. As the pope was not\r\nsatisfied with an empty triumph of vanity and display for his son, and\r\nas his war with the Orsini had failed to produce the anticipated\r\nresults, he decided to increase the fortune of his firstborn by doing\r\nthe very thing which he had accused Calixtus in his speech of doing for\r\nhim, viz., alienating from the States of the Church the cities of\r\nBenevento, Terracino, and Pontecorvo to form, a duchy as an appanage to\r\nhis son’s house. Accordingly this proposition was put forward in a full\r\nconsistory, and as the college of cardinals was entirely Alexander’s,\r\nthere was no difficulty about carrying his point. This new favour to his\r\nelder brother exasperated Caesar, although he was himself getting a\r\nshare of the paternal gifts; for he had just been named envoy ’a latere’\r\nat Frederic’s court, and was appointed to crown him with his own hands\r\nas the papal representative. But Lucrezia, when she had spent a few days\r\nof pleasure with her father and brothers, had gone into retreat at the\r\nconvent of San Sisto. No one knew the real motive of her seclusion, and\r\nno entreaties of Caesar, whose love for her was strange and unnatural,\r\nhad induced her to defer this departure from the world even until the\r\nday after he left for Naples. His sister’s obstinacy wounded him deeply,\r\nfor ever since the day when the Duke of Gandia had appeared in the\r\nprocession so magnificently attired, he fancied he had observed a\r\ncoldness in the mistress of his illicit affection, and so far did this\r\nincrease his hatred of his rival that he resolved to be rid of him at\r\nall costs. So he ordered the chief of his sbirri to come and see him the\r\nsame night.\r\n\r\nMichelotto was accustomed to these mysterious messages, which almost\r\nalways meant his help was wanted in some love affair or some act of\r\nrevenge. As in either case his reward was generally a large one, he was\r\ncareful to keep his engagement, and at the appointed hour was brought\r\ninto the presence of his patron.\r\n\r\nCaesar received him leaning against a tall chimney-piece, no longer\r\nwearing his cardinal’s robe and hat, but a doublet of black velvet\r\nslashed with satin of the same colour. One hand toyed mechanically with\r\nhis gloves, while the other rested an the handle of a poisoned dagger\r\nwhich never left his side. This was the dress he kept for his nocturnal\r\nexpeditions, so Michelotto felt no surprise at that; but his eyes burned\r\nwith a flame more gloomy than their want, and his cheeks, generally\r\npale, were now livid. Michelotto had but to cast one look upon his\r\nmaster to see that Caesar and he were about to share some terrible\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nHe signed to him to shut the door. Michelotto obeyed. Then, after a\r\nmoment’s silence, during which the eyes of Borgia seemed to burn into\r\nthe soul of the bravo, who with a careless air stood bareheaded before\r\nhim, he said, in a voice whose slightly mocking tone gave the only sign\r\nof his emotion.\r\n\r\n\"Michelotto, how do you think this dress suits me?\"\r\n\r\nAccustomed as he was to his master’s tricks of circumlocution, the bravo\r\nwas so far from expecting this question, that at first he stood mute,\r\nand only after a few moments’ pause was able to say:\r\n\r\n\"Admirably, monsignore; thanks to the dress, your Excellency has the\r\nappearance as well as the true spirit of a captain.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad you think so,\" replied Caesar. \"And now let me ask you, do\r\nyou know who is the cause that, instead of wearing this dress, which I\r\ncan only put on at night, I am forced to disguise myself in the daytime\r\nin a cardinal’s robe and hat, and pass my time trotting about from\r\nchurch to church, from consistory to consistory, when I ought properly\r\nto be leading a magnificent army in the battlefield, where you would\r\nenjoy a captain’s rank, instead of being the chief of a few miserable\r\nsbirri?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, monsignore,\" replied Michelotto, who had divined Caesar’s meaning\r\nat his first word; \"the man who is the cause of this is Francesco, Duke\r\nof Gandia, and Benevento, your elder brother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know,\" Caesar resumed, giving no sign of assent but a nod and a\r\nbitter smile,—\"do you know who has all the money and none of the genius,\r\nwho has the helmet and none of the brains, who has the sword and no hand\r\nto wield it?\"\r\n\r\n\"That too is the Duke of Gandia,\" said Michelotto.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know;\" continued Caesar, \"who is the man whom I find continually\r\nblocking the path of my ambition, my fortune, and my love?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the same, the Duke of Gandia,\" said Michelotto.\r\n\r\n\"And what do you think of it?\" asked Caesar.\r\n\r\n\"I think he must die,\" replied the man coldly.\r\n\r\n\"That is my opinion also, Michelotto,\" said Caesar, stepping towards him\r\nand grasping his hand; \"and my only regret is that I did not think of it\r\nsooner; for if I had carried a sword at my side in stead of a crosier in\r\nmy hand when the King of France was marching through Italy, I should now\r\nhave been master of a fine domain. The pope is obviously anxious to\r\naggrandise his family, but he is mistaken in the means he adopts: it is\r\nI who ought to have been made duke, and my brother a cardinal. There is\r\nno doubt at all that, had he made me duke, I should have contributed a\r\ndaring and courage to his service that would have made his power far\r\nweightier than it is. The man who would make his way to vast dominions\r\nand a kingdom ought to trample under foot all the obstacles in his path,\r\nand boldly grasp the very sharpest thorns, whatever reluctance his weak\r\nflesh may feel; such a man, if he would open out his path to fortune,\r\nshould seize his dagger or his sword and strike out with his eyes shut;\r\nhe should not shrink from bathing his hands in the blood of his kindred;\r\nhe should follow the example offered him by every founder of empire from\r\nRomulus to Bajazet, both of whom climbed to the throne by the ladder of\r\nfratracide. Yes, Michelotto, as you say, such is my condition, and I am\r\nresolved I will not shrink. Now you know why I sent for you: am I wrong\r\nin counting upon you?\"\r\n\r\nAs might have been expected, Michelotto, seeing his own fortune in this\r\ncrime, replied that he was entirely at Caesar’s service, and that he had\r\nnothing to do but to give his orders as to time, place, and manner of\r\nexecution. Caesar replied that the time must needs be very soon, since\r\nhe was on the point of leaving Rome for Naples; as to the place and the\r\nmode of execution, they would depend on circumstances, and each of them\r\nmust look out for an opportunity, and seize the first that seemed\r\nfavourable.\r\n\r\nTwo days after this resolution had been taken, Caesar learned that the\r\nday of his departure was fixed for Thursday the 15th of June: at the\r\nsame time he received an invitation from his mother to come to supper\r\nwith her on the 14th. This was a farewell repast given in his honour.\r\nMichelotto received orders to be in readiness at eleven o’clock at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThe table was set in the open air in a magnificent vineyard, a property\r\nof Rosa Vanozza’s in the neighbourhood of San Piero-in-Vinculis: the\r\nguests were Caesar Borgia, the hero of the occasion; the Duke of Gandia;\r\nPrince of Squillace; Dona Sancha, his wife; the Cardinal of Monte Reale,\r\nFrancesco Borgia, son of Calixtus III; Don Roderigo Borgia, captain of\r\nthe apostolic palace; Don Goffredo, brother of the cardinal; Gian\r\nBorgia, at that time ambassador at Perugia; and lastly, Don Alfonso\r\nBorgia, the pope’s nephew: the whole family therefore was present,\r\nexcept Lucrezia, who was still in retreat, and would not come.\r\n\r\nThe repast was magnificent: Caesar was quite as cheerful as usual, and\r\nthe Duke of Gandia seemed more joyous than he had ever been before.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of supper a man in a mask brought him a letter. The duke\r\nunfastened it, colouring up with pleasure; and when he had read it\r\nanswered in these words, \"I will come\": then he quickly hid the letter\r\nin the pocket of his doublet; but quick as he was to conceal it from\r\nevery eye, Caesar had had time to cast a glance that way, and he fancied\r\nhe recognised the handwriting of his sister Lucrezia. Meanwhile the\r\nmessenger had gone off with his answer, no one but Caesar paying the\r\nslightest attention to him, for at that period it was the custom for\r\nhave messages to be conveyed by men in domino or by women whose faces\r\nwere concealed by a veil.\r\n\r\nAt ten o’clock they rose from the table, and as the air was sweet and\r\nmild they walked about a while under the magnificent pine trees that\r\nshaded the house of Rosa Vanozza, while Caesar never for an instant let\r\nhis brother out of his sight. At eleven o’clock the Duke of Gandia bade\r\ngood-night to his mother. Caesar at once followed suit, alleging his\r\ndesire to go to the Vatican to bid farewell to the pope, as he would not\r\nbe able to fulfil this duty on the morrow, his departure being fixed at\r\ndaybreak. This pretext was all the more plausible since the pope was in\r\nthe habit of sitting up every night till two or three o’clock in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nThe two brothers went out together, mounted their horses, which were\r\nwaiting for them at the door, and rode side by side as far as the\r\nPalazzo Borgia, the present home of Cardinal Ascanio Sforza, who had\r\ntaken it as a gift from Alexander the night before his election to the\r\npapacy. There the Duke of Gandia separated from his brother, saying with\r\na smile that he was not intending to go home, as he had several hours to\r\nspend first with a fair lady who was expecting him. Caesar replied that\r\nhe was no doubt free to make any use he liked best of his opportunities,\r\nand wished him a very good night. The duke turned to the right, and\r\nCaesar to the left; but Caesar observed that the street the duke had\r\ntaken led in the direction of the convent of San Sisto, where, as we\r\nsaid, Lucrezia was in retreat; his suspicions were confirmed by this\r\nobservation, and he directed his horse’s steps to the Vatican, found the\r\npope, took his leave of him, and received his benediction.\r\n\r\nFrom this moment all is wrapped in mystery and darkness, like that in\r\nwhich the terrible deed was done that we are now to relate.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is what is believed.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Gandia, when he quitted Caesar, sent away his servants, and\r\nin the company of one confidential valet alone pursued his course\r\ntowards the Piazza della Giudecca. There he found the same man in a mask\r\nwho had come to speak to him at supper, and forbidding his valet to\r\nfollow any farther, he bade him wait on the piazza where they then\r\nstood, promising to be on his way back in two hours’ time at latest, and\r\nto take him up as he passed. And at the appointed hour the duke\r\nreappeared, took leave this time of the man in the mask, and retraced\r\nhis steps towards his palace. But scarcely had he turned the corner of\r\nthe Jewish Ghetto, when four men on foot, led by a fifth who was on\r\nhorseback, flung themselves upon him. Thinking they were thieves, or\r\nelse that he was the victim of some mistake, the Duke of Gandia\r\nmentioned his name; but instead of the name checking the murderers’\r\ndaggers, their strokes were redoubled, and the duke very soon fell dead,\r\nhis valet dying beside him.\r\n\r\nThen the man on horseback, who had watched the assassination with no\r\nsign of emotion, backed his horse towards the dead body: the four\r\nmurderers lifted the corpse across the crupper, and walking by the side\r\nto support it, then made their way down the lane that leads to the\r\nChurch of Santa Maria-in-Monticelli. The wretched valet they left for\r\ndead upon the pavement. But he, after the lapse of a few seconds,\r\nregained some small strength, and his groans were heard by the\r\ninhabitants of a poor little house hard by; they came and picked him up,\r\nand laid him upon a bed, where he died almost at once, unable to give\r\nany evidence as to the assassins or any details of the murder.\r\n\r\nAll night the duke was expected home, and all the next morning; then\r\nexpectation was turned into fear, and fear at last into deadly terror.\r\nThe pope was approached, and told that the Duke of Gandia had never come\r\nback to his palace since he left his mother’s house. But Alexander tried\r\nto deceive himself all through the rest of the day, hoping that his son\r\nmight have been surprised by the coming of daylight in the midst of an\r\namorous adventure, and was waiting till the next night to get away in\r\nthat darkness which had aided his coming thither. But the night, like\r\nthe day, passed and brought no news. On the morrow, the pope, tormented\r\nby the gloomiest presentiments and by the raven’s croak of the ’vox\r\npopuli’, let himself fall into the depths of despair: amid sighs and\r\nsobs of grief, all he could say to any one who came to him was but these\r\nwords, repeated a thousand times: \"Search, search; let us know how my\r\nunhappy son has died.\"\r\n\r\nThen everybody joined in the search; for, as we have said, the Duke of\r\nGandia was beloved by all; but nothing could be discovered from scouring\r\nthe town, except the body of the murdered man, who was recognised as the\r\nduke’s valet; of his master there was no trace whatever: it was then\r\nthought, not without reason, that he had probably been thrown into the\r\nTiber, and they began to follow along its banks, beginning from the Via\r\ndella Ripetta, questioning every boatman and fisherman who might\r\npossibly have seen, either from their houses or from their boats, what\r\nhad happened on the river banks during the two preceding nights. At\r\nfirst all inquiries were in vain; but when they had gone up as high as\r\nthe Via del Fantanone, they found a man at last who said he had seen\r\nsomething happen on the night of the 14th which might very possibly have\r\nsome bearing on the subject of inquiry. He was a Slav named George, who\r\nwas taking up the river a boat laden with wood to Ripetta. The following\r\nare his own words:\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"last Wednesday evening, when I had set down my\r\nload of wood on the bank, I remained in my boat, resting in the cool\r\nnight air, and watching lest other men should come and take away what I\r\nhad just unloaded, when, about two o’clock in the morning, I saw coming\r\nout of the lane on the left of San Girolamo’s Church two men on foot,\r\nwho came forward into the middle of the street, and looked so carefully\r\nall around that they seemed to have come to find out if anybody was\r\ngoing along the street. When they felt sure that it was deserted, they\r\nwent back along the same lane, whence issued presently two other men,\r\nwho used similar precautions to make sure that there was nothing fresh;\r\nthey, when they found all as they wished, gave a sign to their\r\ncompanions to come and join them; next appeared one man on a dapple-grey\r\nhorse, which was carrying on the crupper the body of a dead man, his\r\nhead and arms hanging over on one side and his feet on the other. The\r\ntwo fellows I had first seen exploring were holding him up by the arms\r\nand legs. The other three at once went up to the river, while the first\r\ntwo kept a watch on the street, and advancing to the part of the bank\r\nwhere the sewers of the town are discharged into the Tiber, the horseman\r\nturned his horse, backing on the river; then the two who were at either\r\nside taking the corpse, one by the hands, the other by the feet, swung\r\nit three times, and the third time threw it out into the river with all\r\ntheir strength; then at the noise made when the body splashed into the\r\nwater, the horseman asked, ’Is it done?’ and the others answered, ’Yes,\r\nsir,’ and he at once turned right about face; but seeing the dead man’s\r\ncloak floating, he asked what was that black thing swimming about.\r\n’Sir,’ said one of the men, ’it is his cloak’; and then another man\r\npicked up some stones, and running to the place where it was still\r\nfloating, threw them so as to make it sink under; as soon, as it had\r\nquite disappeared, they went off, and after walking a little way along\r\nthe main road, they went into the lane that leads to San Giacomo. That\r\nwas all I saw, gentlemen, and so it is all I can answer to the questions\r\nyou have asked me.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words, which robbed of all hope any who might yet entertain it,\r\none of the pope’s servants asked the Slav why, when he was witness of\r\nsuch a deed, he had not gone to denounce it to the governor. But the\r\nSlav replied that, since he had exercised his present trade on the\r\nriverside, he had seen dead men thrown into the Tiber in the same way a\r\nhundred times, and had never heard that anybody had been troubled about\r\nthem; so he supposed it would be the same with this corpse as the\r\nothers, and had never imagined it was his duty to speak of it, not\r\nthinking it would be any more important than it had been before.\r\n\r\nActing on this intelligence, the servants of His Holiness summoned at\r\nonce all the boatmen and fishermen who were accustomed to go up and down\r\nthe river, and as a large reward was promised to anyone who should find\r\nthe duke’s body, there were soon more than a hundred ready for the job;\r\nso that before the evening of the same day, which was Friday, two men\r\nwere drawn out of the water, of whom one was instantly recognised as the\r\nhapless duke. At the very first glance at the body there could be no\r\ndoubt as to the cause of death. It was pierced with nine wounds, the\r\nchief one in the throat, whose artery was cut. The clothing had not been\r\ntouched: his doublet and cloak were there, his gloves in his waistband,\r\ngold in his purse; the duke then must have been assassinated not for\r\ngain but for revenge.\r\n\r\nThe ship which carried the corpse went up the Tiber to the Castello\r\nSant’ Angelo, where it was set down. At once the magnificent dress was\r\nfetched from the duke’s palace which he had worn on the day of the\r\nprocession, and he was clothed in it once more: beside him were placed\r\nthe insignia of the generalship of the Church. Thus he lay in state all\r\nday, but his father in his despair had not the courage to came and look\r\nat him. At last, when night had fallen, his most trusty and honoured\r\nservants carried the body to the church of the Madonna del Papala, with\r\nall the pomp and ceremony that Church and State combined could devise\r\nfor the funeral of the son of the pope.\r\n\r\nMeantime the bloodstained hands of Caesar Borgia were placing a royal\r\ncrown upon the head of Frederic of Aragon.\r\n\r\nThis blow had pierced Alexander’s heart very deeply. As at first he did\r\nnot know on whom his suspicions should fall, he gave the strictest\r\norders for the pursuit of the murderers; but little by little the\r\ninfamous truth was forced upon him. He saw that the blow which struck at\r\nhis house came from that very house itself and then his despair was\r\nchanged to madness: he ran through the rooms of the Vatican like a\r\nmaniac, and entering the consistory with torn garments and ashes on his\r\nhead, he sobbingly avowed all the errors of his past life, owning that\r\nthe disaster that struck his offspring through his offspring was a just\r\nchastisement from God; then he retired to a secret dark chamber of the\r\npalace, and there shut himself up, declaring his resolve to die of\r\nstarvation. And indeed for more than sixty hours he took no nourishment\r\nby day nor rest by night, making no answer to those who knocked at his\r\ndoor to bring him food except with the wailings of a woman or a roar as\r\nof a wounded lion; even the beautiful Giulia Farnese, his new mistress,\r\ncould not move him at all, and was obliged to go and seek Lucrezia, that\r\ndaughter doubly loved to conquer his deadly resolve. Lucrezia came out\r\nfrom the retreat were she was weeping for the Duke of Gandia, that she\r\nmight console her father. At her voice the door did really open, and it\r\nwas only then that the Duke of Segovia, who had been kneeling almost a\r\nwhole day at the threshold, begging His Holiness to take heart, could\r\nenter with servants bearing wine and food.\r\n\r\nThe pope remained alone with Lucrezia for three days and nights; then he\r\nreappeared in public, outwardly calm, if not resigned; for Guicciardini\r\nassures us that his daughter had made him understand how dangerous it\r\nwould be to himself to show too openly before the assassin, who was\r\ncoming home, the immoderate love he felt for his victim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nCaesar remained at Naples, partly to give time to the paternal grief to\r\ncool down, and partly to get on with another business he had lately been\r\ncharged with, nothing else than a proposition of marriage between\r\nLucrezia and Don Alfonso of Aragon, Duke of Bicelli and Prince of\r\nSalerno, natural son of Alfonso II and brother of Dona Sancha. It was\r\ntrue that Lucrezia was already married to the lord of Pesaro, but she\r\nwas the daughter of a father who had received from heaven the right of\r\nuniting and disuniting. There was no need to trouble about so trifling a\r\nmatter: when the two were ready to marry, the divorce would be effected.\r\nAlexander was too good a tactician to leave his daughter married to a\r\nson-in-law who was becoming useless to him.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of August it was announced that the ambassador was\r\ncoming back to Rome, having accomplished his mission to the new king to\r\nhis great satisfaction. And thither he returned an the 5th of\r\nSeptember,—that is, nearly three months after the Duke of Gandia’s\r\ndeath,—and on the next day, the 6th, from the church of Santa Maria\r\nNovella, where, according to custom, the cardinals and the Spanish and\r\nVenetian ambassadors were awaiting him on horseback at the door, he\r\nproceeded to the Vatican, where His Holiness was sitting; there he\r\nentered the consistory, was admitted by the pope, and in accordance with\r\nthe usual ceremonial received his benediction and kiss; then,\r\naccompanied once more in the same fashion by the ambassadors and\r\ncardinals, he was escorted to his own apartments. Thence he proceeded\r\nto, the pope’s, as soon as he was left alone; for at the consistory they\r\nhad had no speech with one another, and the father and son had a hundred\r\nthings to talk about, but of these the Duke of Gandia was not one, as\r\nmight have been expected. His name was not once spoken, and neither on\r\nthat day nor afterwards was there ever again any mention of the unhappy\r\nyoung man: it was as though he had never existed.\r\n\r\nIt was the fact that Caesar brought good news, King Frederic gave his\r\nconsent to the proposed union; so the marriage of Sforza and Lucrezia\r\nwas dissolved on a pretext of nullity. Then Frederic authorised the\r\nexhumation of D’jem’s body, which, it will be remembered, was worth\r\n300,000 ducats.\r\n\r\nAfter this, all came about as Caesar had desired; he became the man who\r\nwas all-powerful after the pope; but when he was second in command it\r\nwas soon evident to the Roman people that their city was making a new\r\nstride in the direction of ruin. There was nothing but balls, fetes,\r\nmasquerades; there were magnificent hunting parties, when Caesar—who had\r\nbegun to cast off his cardinal’s robe,—weary perhaps of the colour,\r\nappeared in a French dress, followed, like a king by cardinals, envoys\r\nand bodyguard. The whole pontifical town, given up like a courtesan to\r\norgies and debauchery, had never been more the home of sedition, luxury,\r\nand carnage, according to the Cardinal of Viterba, not even in the days\r\nof Nero and Heliogabalus. Never had she fallen upon days more evil;\r\nnever had more traitors done her dishonour or sbirri stained her streets\r\nwith blood. The number of thieves was so great, and their audacity such,\r\nthat no one could with safety pass the gates of the town; soon it was\r\nnot even safe within them. No house, no castle, availed for defence.\r\nRight and justice no longer existed. Money, farce, pleasure, ruled\r\nsupreme.\r\n\r\nStill, the gold was melting as in a furnace at these Fetes; and, by\r\nHeaven’s just punishment, Alexander and Caesar were beginning to covet\r\nthe fortunes of those very men who had risen through their simony to\r\ntheir present elevation. The first attempt at a new method of coining\r\nmoney was tried upon the Cardinal Cosenza. The occasion was as follows.\r\nA certain dispensation had been granted some time before to a nun who\r\nhad taken the vows: she was the only surviving heir to the throne of\r\nPortugal, and by means of the dispensation she had been wedded to the\r\nnatural son of the last king. This marriage was more prejudicial than\r\ncan easily be imagined to the interests of Ferdinand and Isabella of\r\nSpain; so they sent ambassadors to Alexander to lodge a complaint\r\nagainst a proceeding of this nature, especially as it happened at the\r\nvery moment when an alliance was to be formed between the house of\r\nAragon and the Holy See. Alexander understood the complaint, and\r\nresolved that all should be set right. So he denied all knowledge of the\r\npapal brief though he had as a fact received 60,000 ducats for signing\r\nit—and accused the Archbishop of Cosenza, secretary for apostolic\r\nbriefs, of having granted a false dispensation. By reason of this\r\naccusation, the archbishop was taken to the castle of Sant’ Angelo, and\r\na suit was begun.\r\n\r\nBut as it was no easy task to prove an accusation of this nature,\r\nespecially if the archbishop should persist in maintaining that the\r\ndispensation was really granted by the pope, it was resolved to employ a\r\ntrick with him which could not fail to succeed. One evening the\r\nArchbishop of Cosenza saw Cardinal Valentino come into his prison; with\r\nthat frank air of affability which he knew well how to assume when it\r\ncould serve his purpose, he explained to the prisoner the embarrassing\r\nsituation in which the pope was placed, from which the archbishop alone,\r\nwhom His Holiness looked upon as his best friend, could save him.\r\n\r\nThe archbishop replied that he was entirely at the service of His\r\nHoliness.\r\n\r\nCaesar, on his entrance, found the captive seated, leaning his elbows on\r\na table, and he took a seat opposite him and explained the pope’s\r\nposition: it was an embarrassing one. At the very time of contracting so\r\nimportant an alliance with the house of Aragon as that of Lucrezia and\r\nAlfonso, His Holiness could not avow to Ferdinand and Isabella that, for\r\nthe sake of a few miserable ducats, he had signed a dispensation which\r\nwould unite in the husband and wife together all the legitimate claims\r\nto a throne to which Ferdinand and Isabella had no right at all but that\r\nof conquest. This avowal would necessarily put an end to all\r\nnegotiations, and the pontifical house would fall by the overthrow of\r\nthat very pedestal which was to have heightened its grandeur.\r\nAccordingly the archbishop would understand what the pope expected of\r\nhis devotion and friendship: it was a simple and straight avowal that he\r\nhad supposed he might take it upon himself to accord the dispensation.\r\nThen, as the sentence to be passed on such an error would be the\r\nbusiness of Alexander, the accused could easily imagine beforehand how\r\ntruly paternal such a sentence would be. Besides, the reward was in the\r\nsame hands, and if the sentence was that of a father, the recompense\r\nwould be that of a king. In fact, this recompense would be no less than\r\nthe honour of assisting as envoy, with the title of cardinal, at the\r\nmarriage of Lucrezia and Alfonso—a favour which would be very\r\nappropriate, since it would be thanks to his devotion that the marriage\r\ncould take place.\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop of Cosenza knew the men he was dealing with; he knew that\r\nto save their own ends they would hesitate at nothing; he knew they had\r\na poison like sugar to the taste and to the smell, impossible to\r\ndiscover in food—a poison that would kill slowly or quickly as the\r\npoisoner willed and would leave no trace behind; he knew the secret of\r\nthe poisoned key that lay always on the pope’s mantelpiece, so that when\r\nHis Holiness wished to destroy some one of his intimates, he bade him\r\nopen a certain cupboard: on the handle of the key there was a little\r\nspike, and as the lock of the cupboard turned stiffly the hand would\r\nnaturally press, the lock would yield, and nothing would have come of it\r\nbut a trifling scratch: the scratch was mortal. He knew, too, that\r\nCaesar wore a ring made like two lions’ heads, and that he would turn\r\nthe stone on the inside when he was shaking hands with a friend. Then\r\nthe lions’ teeth became the teeth of a viper, and the friend died\r\ncursing Borgia. So he yielded, partly through fear, partly blinded by\r\nthe thought of the reward; and Caesar returned to the Vatican armed with\r\na precious paper, in which the Archbishop of Cosenza admitted that he\r\nwas the only person responsible for the dispensation granted to the\r\nroyal nun.\r\n\r\nTwo days later, by means of the proofs kindly furnished by the\r\narchbishop, the pope; in the presence of the governor of Rome, the\r\nauditor of the apostolic chamber, the advocate, and the fiscal attorney,\r\npronounced sentence, condemning the archbishop to the loss of all his\r\nbenefices and ecclesiastical offices, degradation from his orders, and\r\nconfiscation of his goods; his person was to be handed over to the civil\r\narm. Two days later the civil magistrate entered the prison to fulfil\r\nhis office as received from the pope, and appeared before the\r\narchbishop, accompanied by a clerk, two servants, and four guards. The\r\nclerk unrolled the paper he carried and read out the sentence; the two\r\nservants untied a packet, and, stripping the prisoner of his\r\necclesiastical garments, they reclothed him in a dress of coarse white\r\ncloth which only reached down to his knees, breeches of the same, and a\r\npair of clumsy shoes. Lastly, the guards took him, and led him into one\r\nof the deepest dungeons of the castle of Sant’ Angelo, where for\r\nfurniture he found nothing but a wooden crucifix, a table, a chair, and\r\na bed; for occupation, a Bible and a breviary, with a lamp to read by;\r\nfor nourishment, two pounds of bread and a little cask of water, which\r\nwere to be renewed every three days, together with a bottle of oil for\r\nburning in his lamp.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a year the poor archbishop died of despair, not before he\r\nhad gnawed his own arms in his agony.\r\n\r\nThe very same day that he was taken into the dungeon, Caesar Borgia, who\r\nhad managed the affair so ably, was presented by the pope with all the\r\nbelongings of the condemned prisoner.\r\n\r\nBut the hunting parties, balls, and masquerades were not the only\r\npleasures enjoyed by the pope and his family: from time to time strange\r\nspectacles were exhibited. We will only describe two—one of them a case\r\nof punishment, the other no more nor less than a matter of the stud\r\nfarm. But as both of these give details with which we would not have our\r\nreaders credit our imagination, we will first say that they are\r\nliterally translated from Burchard’s Latin journal.\r\n\r\n\"About the same time—that is, about the beginning of 1499—a certain\r\ncourtesan named La Corsetta was in prison, and had a lover who came to\r\nvisit her in woman’s clothes, a Spanish Moor, called from his disguise\r\n’the Spanish lady from Barbary!’ As a punishment, both of them were led\r\nthrough the town, the woman without petticoat or skirt, but wearing only\r\nthe Moor’s dress unbuttoned in front; the man wore his woman’s garb; his\r\nhands were tied behind his back, and the skirt fastened up to his\r\nmiddle, with a view to complete exposure before the eyes of all. When in\r\nthis attire they had made the circuit of the town, the Corsetta was sent\r\nback to the prison with the Moor. But on the 7th of April following, the\r\nMoor was again taken out and escorted in the company of two thieves\r\ntowards the Campo dei Fiori. The three condemned men were preceded by a\r\nconstable, who rode backwards on an ass, and held in his hand a long\r\npole, on the end of which were hung, still bleeding, the amputated limbs\r\nof a poor Jew who had suffered torture and death for some trifling\r\ncrime. When the procession reached the place of execution, the thieves\r\nwere hanged, and the unfortunate Moor was tied to a stake piled round\r\nwith wood, where he was to have been burnt to death, had not rain fallen\r\nin such torrents that the fire would not burn, in spite of all the\r\nefforts of the executioner.\"\r\n\r\nThis unlooked for accident, taken as a miracle by the people, robbed\r\nLucrezia of the most exciting part of the execution; but her father was\r\nholding in reserve another kind of spectacle to console her with later.\r\nWe inform the reader once more that a few lines we are about to set\r\nbefore him are a translation from the journal of the worthy German\r\nBurchard, who saw nothing in the bloodiest or most wanton performances\r\nbut facts for his journal, which he duly registered with the\r\nimpassibility of a scribe, appending no remark or moral reflection.\r\n\r\n\"On the 11th of November a certain peasant was entering Rome with two\r\nstallions laden with wood, when the servants of His Holiness, just as he\r\npassed the Piazza of St. Peter’s, cut their girths, so that their loads\r\nfell on the ground with the pack-saddles, and led off the horses to a\r\ncourt between the palace and the gate; then the stable doors were\r\nopened, and four stallions, quite free and unbridled, rushed out and in\r\nan instant all six animals began kicking, biting and fighting each other\r\nuntil several were killed. Roderigo and Madame Lucrezia, who sat at the\r\nwindow just over the palace gate, took the greatest delight in the\r\nstruggle and called their courtiers to witness the gallant battle that\r\nwas being fought below them.\"\r\n\r\nNow Caesar’s trick in the matter of the Archbishop of Cosenza had had\r\nthe desired result, and Isabella and Ferdinand could no longer impute to\r\nAlexander the signature of the brief they had complained of: so nothing\r\nwas now in the way of the marriage of Lucrezia and Alfonso; this\r\ncertainty gave the pope great joy, for he attached all the more\r\nimportance to this marriage because he was already cogitating a second,\r\nbetween Caesar and Dona Carlota, Frederic’s daughter.\r\n\r\nCaesar had shown in all his actions since his brother’s death his want\r\nof vocation for the ecclesiastical life; so no one was astonished when,\r\na consistory having been summoned one morning by Alexander, Caesar\r\nentered, and addressing the pope, began by saying that from his earliest\r\nyears he had been drawn towards secular pursuits both by natural\r\ninclination and ability, and it had only been in obedience to the\r\nabsolute commands of His Holiness that he entered the Church, accepted\r\nthe cardinal’s scarlet, other dignities, and finally the sacred order of\r\nthe diaconate; but feeling that in his situation it was improper to\r\nfollow his passions, and at his age impossible to resist them, he humbly\r\nentreated His Holiness graciously to yield to the desire he had failed\r\nto overcome, and to permit him to lay aside the dress and dignities of\r\nthe Church, and enter once more into the world, thereto contract a\r\nlawful marriage; also he entreated the lord cardinals to intercede for\r\nhim with His Holiness, to whom he would freely resign all his churches,\r\nabbeys, and benefices, as well as every other ecclesiastical dignity and\r\npreferment that had been accorded him. The cardinals, deferring to\r\nCaesar’s wishes, gave a unanimous vote, and the pope, as we may suppose,\r\nlike a good father, not wishing to force his son’s inclinations,\r\naccepted his resignation, and yielded to the petition; thus Caesar put\r\noff the scarlet robe, which was suited to him, says his historian\r\nTommaso Tommasi, in one particular only—that it was the colour of blood.\r\n\r\nIn truth, the resignation was a pressing necessity, and there was no\r\ntime to lose. Charles VIII one day after he had came home late and tired\r\nfrom the hunting-field, had bathed his head in cold water; and going\r\nstraight to table, had been struck down by an apoplectic seizure\r\ndirectly after his supper; and was dead, leaving the throne to the good\r\nLouis XII, a man of two conspicuous weaknesses, one as deplorable as the\r\nother: the first was the wish to make conquests; the second was the\r\ndesire to have children. Alexander, who was on the watch for all\r\npolitical changes, had seen in a moment what he could get from Louis\r\nXII’s accession to the throne, and was prepared to profit by the fact\r\nthat the new king of France needed his help for the accomplishment of\r\nhis twofold desire. Louis needed, first, his temporal aid in an\r\nexpedition against the duchy of Milan, on which, as we explained before,\r\nhe had inherited claims from Valentina Visconti, his grandmother; and,\r\nsecondly, his spiritual aid to dissolve his marriage with Jeanne, the\r\ndaughter of Louis XI; a childless and hideously deformed woman, whom he\r\nhad only married by reason of the great fear he entertained for her\r\nfather. Now Alexander was willing to do all this for Louis XII and to\r\ngive in addition a cardinal’s hat to his friend George d’Amboise,\r\nprovided only that the King of France would use his influence in\r\npersuading the young Dona Carlota, who was at his court, to marry his\r\nson Caesar.\r\n\r\nSo, as this business was already far advanced on the day when Caesar\r\ndoffed his scarlet and donned a secular garb, thus fulfilling the\r\nambition so long cherished, when the lord of Villeneuve, sent by Louis\r\nand commissioned to bring Caesar to France, presented himself before the\r\nex-cardinal on his arrival at Rome, the latter, with his usual\r\nextravagance of luxury and the kindness he knew well how to bestow on\r\nthose he needed, entertained his guest for a month, and did all the\r\nhonours of Rome. After that, they departed, preceded by one of the\r\npope’s couriers, who gave orders that every town they passed through was\r\nto receive them with marks of honour and respect. The same order had\r\nbeen sent throughout the whole of France, where the illustrious visitors\r\nreceived so numerous a guard, and were welcomed by a populace so eager\r\nto behold them, that after they passed through Paris, Caesar’s\r\ngentlemen-in-waiting wrote to Rome that they had not seen any trees in\r\nFrance, or houses, or walls, but only men, women and sunshine.\r\n\r\nThe king, on the pretext of going out hunting, went to meet his guest\r\ntwo leagues outside the town. As he knew Caesar was very fond of the\r\nname of Valentine, which he had used as cardinal, and still continued to\r\nemploy with the title of Count, although he had resigned the\r\narchbishopric which gave him the name, he there and then bestowed on him\r\nthe investiture of Valence, in Dauphine, with the title of Duke and a\r\npension of 20,000 francs; then, when he had made this magnificent gift\r\nand talked with him for nearly a couple of hours, he took his leave, to\r\nenable him to prepare the splendid entry he was proposing to make.\r\n\r\nIt was Wednesday, the 18th of December 1498, when Caesar Borgia entered\r\nthe town of Chinon, with pomp worthy of the son of a pope who is about\r\nto marry the daughter of a king. The procession began with\r\nfour-and-twenty mules, caparisoned in red, adorned with escutcheons\r\nbearing the duke’s arms, laden with carved trunks and chests inlaid with\r\nivory and silver; after them came four-and-twenty more, also\r\ncaparisoned, this time in the livery of the King of France, yellow and\r\nred; next after these came ten other mules, covered in yellow satin with\r\nred crossbars; and lastly another ten, covered with striped cloth of\r\ngold, the stripes alternately raised and flat gold.\r\n\r\nBehind the seventy mules which led the procession there pranced sixteen\r\nhandsome battle-horses, led by equerries who marched alongside; these\r\nwere followed by eighteen hunters ridden by eighteen pages, who were\r\nabout fourteen or fifteen years of age; sixteen of them were dressed in\r\ncrimson velvet, and two in raised gold cloth; so elegantly dressed were\r\nthese two children, who were also the best looking of the little band,\r\nthat the sight of them gave rise to strange suspicions as to the reason\r\nfor this preference, if one may believe what Brantome says. Finally,\r\nbehind these eighteen horses came six beautiful mules, all harnessed\r\nwith red velvet, and led by six valets, also in velvet to match.\r\n\r\nThe third group consisted of, first, two mules quite covered with cloth\r\nof gold, each carrying two chests in which it was said that the duke’s\r\ntreasure was stored, the precious stones he was bringing to his fiancee,\r\nand the relics and papal bulls that his father had charged him to convey\r\nfor him to Louis XII. These were followed by twenty gentlemen dressed in\r\ncloth of gold and silver, among whom rode Paul Giordano Orsino and\r\nseveral barons and knights among the chiefs of the state ecclesiastic.\r\n\r\nNext came two drums, one rebeck, and four soldiers blowing trumpets and\r\nsilver clarions; then, in the midst of a party of four-and-twenty\r\nlacqueys, dressed half in crimson velvet and half in yellow silk, rode\r\nMessire George d’Amboise and Monseigneur the Duke of Valentinois. Caesar\r\nwas mounted on a handsome tall courser, very richly harnessed, in a robe\r\nhalf red satin and half cloth of gold, embroidered all over with pearls\r\nand precious stones; in his cap were two rows of rubies, the size of\r\nbeans, which reflected so brilliant a light that one might have fancied\r\nthey were the famous carbuncles of the Arabian Nights; he also wore on\r\nhis neck a collar worth at least 200,000 livres; indeed, there was no\r\npart of him, even down to his boots, that was not laced with gold and\r\nedged with pearls. His horse was covered with a cuirass in a pattern of\r\ngolden foliage of wonderful workmanship, among which there appeared to\r\ngrow, like flowers, nosegays of pearls and clusters of rubies.\r\n\r\nLastly, bringing up the rear of the magnificent cortege, behind the duke\r\ncame twenty-four mules with red caparisons bearing his arms, carrying\r\nhis silver plate, tents, and baggage.\r\n\r\nWhat gave to all the cavalcade an air of most wonderful luxury and\r\nextravagance was that the horses and mules were shod with golden shoes,\r\nand these were so badly nailed on that more than three-quarters of their\r\nnumber, were lost on the road For this extravagance Caesar was greatly\r\nblamed, for it was thought an audacious thing to put on his horses’ feet\r\na metal of which king’s crowns are made.\r\n\r\nBut all this pomp had no effect on the lady for whose sake it had been\r\ndisplayed; for when Dona Carlota was told that Caesar Borgia had come to\r\nFrance in the hope of becoming her husband, she replied simply that she\r\nwould never take a priest for her husband, and, moreover, the son of a\r\npriest; a man who was not only an assassin, but a fratricide; not only a\r\nman of infamous birth, but still more infamous in his morals and his\r\nactions.\r\n\r\nBut, in default of the haughty lady of Aragon, Caesar soon found another\r\nprincess of noble blood who consented to be his wife: this was\r\nMademoiselle d’Albret, daughter of the King of Navarre. The marriage,\r\narranged on condition that the pope should pay 200,000 ducats dowry to\r\nthe bride, and should make her brother cardinal, was celebrated on the\r\n10th of May; and on the Whitsunday following the Duke of Valentois\r\nreceived the order of St. Michael, an order founded by Louis XI, and\r\nesteemed at this period as the highest in the gift of the kings of\r\nFrance. The news of this marriage, which made an alliance with Louis XII\r\ncertain, was received with great joy by the pope, who at once gave\r\norders for bonfires and illuminations all over the town.\r\n\r\nLouis XII was not only grateful to the pope for dissolving his marriage\r\nwith Jeanne of France and authorizing his union with Anne of Brittany,\r\nbut he considered it indispensable to his designs in Italy to have the\r\npope as his ally. So he promised the Duke of Valentinois to put three\r\nhundred lances at his disposal, as soon as he had made an entry into\r\nMilan, to be used to further his own private interests, and against\r\nwhomsoever he pleased except only the allies of France. The conquest of\r\nMilan should be undertaken so soon as Louis felt assured of the support\r\nof the Venetians, or at least of their neutrality, and he had sent them\r\nambassadors authorised to promise in his name the restoration of Cremona\r\nand Ghiera d’Adda when he had completed the conquest of Lombardy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nEverything from without was favouring Alexander’s encroaching policy,\r\nwhen he was compelled to turn his eyes from France towards the centre of\r\nItaly: in Florence dwelt a man, neither duke, nor king, nor soldier, a\r\nman whose power was in his genius, whose armour was his purity, who\r\nowned no offensive weapon but his tongue, and who yet began to grow more\r\ndangerous for him than all the kings, dukes, princes, in the whole world\r\ncould ever be; this man was the poor Dominican monk Girolamo Savonarola,\r\nthe same who had refused absolution to Lorenzo dei Medici because he\r\nwould not restore the liberty of Florence.\r\n\r\nGirolamo Savonarola had prophesied the invasion of a force from beyond\r\nthe Alps, and Charles VIII had conquered Naples; Girolamo Savonarola had\r\nprophesied to Charles VIII that because he had failed to fulfil the\r\nmission of liberator entrusted to him by God, he was threatened with a\r\ngreat misfortune as a punishment, and Charles was dead; lastly,\r\nSavonarola had prophesied his own fall like the man who paced around the\r\nholy city for eight days, crying, \"Woe to Jerusalem!\" and on the ninth\r\nday, \"Woe be on my own head!\" None the less, the Florentine reformer,\r\nwho could not recoil from any danger, was determined to attack the\r\ncolossal abomination that was seated on St. Peter’s holy throne; each\r\ndebauch, each fresh crime that lifted up its brazen face to the light of\r\nday or tried to hide its shameful head beneath the veil of night, he had\r\nnever failed to paint out to the people, denouncing it as the off spring\r\nof the pope’s luxurious living and lust of power. Thus had he\r\nstigmatised Alexander’s new amour with the beautiful Giulia Farnese, who\r\nin the preceding April a added another son to the pope’s family; thus\r\nhad he cursed the Duke of Gandia’s murderer, the lustful, jealous\r\nfratricide; lastly, he had pointed out to the Florentines, who were\r\nexcluded from the league then forming, what sort of future was in store\r\nfar them when the Borgias should have made themselves masters of the\r\nsmall principalities and should come to attack the duchies and\r\nrepublics. It was clear that in Savonarola, the pope had an enemy at\r\nonce temporal and spiritual, whose importunate and threatening voice\r\nmust be silenced at any cost.\r\n\r\nBut mighty as the pope’s power was, to accomplish a design like this was\r\nno easy matter. Savonarola, preaching the stern principles of liberty,\r\nhad united to his cause, even in the midst of rich, pleasure-loving\r\nFlorence, a party of some size, known as the ’Piagnoni’, or the\r\nPenitents: this band was composed of citizens who were anxious for\r\nreform in Church and State, who accused the Medici of enslaving the\r\nfatherland and the Borgias of upsetting the faith, who demanded two\r\nthings, that the republic should return to her democratic principles,\r\nand religion to a primitive simplicity. Towards the first of these\r\nprojects considerable progress had been made, since they had\r\nsuccessively obtained, first, an amnesty for all crimes and\r\ndelinquencies committed under other governments; secondly, the abolition\r\nof the ’balia’, which was an aristocratic magistracy; thirdly, the\r\nestablishment of a sovereign council, composed of 1800 citizens; and\r\nlastly, the substitution of popular elections for drawing by lot and for\r\noligarchical nominations: these changes had been effected in spite of\r\ntwo other factions, the ’Arrabiati’, or Madmen, who, consisting of the\r\nrichest and noblest youths of the Florentine patrician families, desired\r\nto have an oligarchical government; and the ’Bigi’, or Greys, so called\r\nbecause they always held their meetings in the shade, who desired the\r\nreturn of the Medici.\r\n\r\nThe first measure Alexander used against the growing power of Savonarola\r\nwas to declare him heretic, and as such banished from the pulpit; but\r\nSavonarola had eluded this prohibition by making his pupil and friend,\r\nDomenico Bonvicini di Pescia, preach in his stead. The result was that\r\nthe master’s teachings were issued from other lips, and that was all;\r\nthe seed, though scattered by another hand, fell none the less on\r\nfertile soil, where it would soon burst into flower. Moreover,\r\nSavonarola now set an example that was followed to good purpose by\r\nLuther, when, twenty-two years later, he burned Leo X’s bull of\r\nexcommunication at Wittenberg; he was weary of silence, so he declared,\r\non the authority of Pope Pelagius, that an unjust excommunication had no\r\nefficacy, and that the person excommunicated unjustly did not even need\r\nto get absolution. So on Christmas Day, 1497, he declared that by the\r\ninspiration of God he renounced his obedience to a corrupt master; and\r\nhe began to preach once more in the cathedral, with a success that was\r\nall the greater for the interruption, and an influence far more\r\nformidable than before, because it was strengthened by that sympathy of\r\nthe masses which an unjust persecution always inspires.\r\n\r\nThen Alexander made overtures to Leonardo dei Medici, vicar of the\r\narchbishopric of Florence, to obtain the punishment of the rebel:\r\nLeonardo, in obedience to the orders he received, from Rome, issued a\r\nmandate forbidding the faithful to attend at Savonarola’s sermons. After\r\nthis mandate, any who should hear the discourses of the excommunicated\r\nmonk would be refused communion and confession; and as when they died\r\nthey would be contaminated with heresy, in consequence of their\r\nspiritual intercourse with a heretic, their dead bodies would be dragged\r\non a hurdle and deprived of the rights of sepulture. Savonarola appealed\r\nfrom the mandate of his superior both to the people and to the Signoria,\r\nand the two together gave orders to the episcopal vicar to leave\r\nFlorence within two hours: this happened at the beginning of the year\r\n1498.\r\n\r\nThe expulsion of Leonard’s dei Medici was a new triumph for Savonarola,\r\nso, wishing to turn to good moral account his growing influence, he\r\nresolved to convert the last day of the carnival, hitherto given up to\r\nworldly pleasures, into a day of religious sacrifice. So actually on\r\nShrove Tuesday a considerable number of boys were collected in front of\r\nthe cathedral, and there divided into bands, which traversed the whole\r\ntown, making a house-to-house visitation, claiming all profane books,\r\nlicentious paintings, lutes, harps, cards and dice, cosmetics and\r\nperfumes—in a word, all the hundreds of products of a corrupt society\r\nand civilisation, by the aid of which Satan at times makes victorious\r\nwar on God. The inhabitants of Florence obeyed, and came forth to the\r\nPiazza of the Duoma, bringing these works of perdition, which were soon\r\npiled up in a huge stack, which the youthful reformers set on fire,\r\nsinging religious psalms and hymns the while. On this pile were burned\r\nmany copies of Boccaccio and of Margante Maggiore, and pictures by Fro\r\nBartalommeo, who from that day forward renounced the art of this world\r\nto consecrate his brush utterly and entirely to the reproduction of\r\nreligious scenes.\r\n\r\nA reform such as this was terrifying to Alexander; so he resolved on\r\nfighting Savonarola with his own weapons—that is, by the force of\r\neloquence. He chose as the Dominican’s opponent a preacher of recognised\r\ntalent, called Fra Francesco di Paglia; and he sent him to Florence,\r\nwhere he began to preach in Santa Croce, accusing Savonarola of heresy\r\nand impiety. At the same time the pope, in a new brief, announced to the\r\nSignaria that unless they forbade the arch-heretic to preach, all the\r\ngoods of Florentine merchants who lived on the papal territory would be\r\nconfiscated, and the republic laid under an interdict and declared the\r\nspiritual and temporal enemy of the Church. The Signoria, abandoned by\r\nFrance, and aware that the material power of Rome was increasing in a\r\nfrightful manner, was forced this time to yield, and to issue to\r\nSavonarola an order to leave off preaching. He obeyed, and bade farewell\r\nto his congregation in a sermon full of strength and eloquence.\r\n\r\nBut the withdrawal of Savonarola, so far from calming the ferment, had\r\nincreased it: there was talk about his prophecies being fulfilled; and\r\nsome zealots, more ardent than their mastery added miracle to\r\ninspiration, and loudly proclaimed that Savonarola had offered to go\r\ndown into the vaults of the cathedral with his antagonist, and there\r\nbring a dead man to life again, to prove that his doctrine was true,\r\npromising to declare himself vanquished if the miracle were performed by\r\nhis adversary. These rumours reached the ears of Fra Francesco, and as\r\nhe was a man of warm blood, who counted his own life as nothing if it\r\nmight be spent to help his cause, he declared in all humility that he\r\nfelt he was too great a sinner for God to work a miracle in his behalf;\r\nbut he proposed another challenge: he would try with Savonarola the\r\nordeal of fire. He knew, he said, that he must perish, but at least he\r\nshould perish avenging the cause of religion, since he was certain to\r\ninvolve in his destruction the tempter who plunged so many souls beside\r\nhis own into eternal damnation.\r\n\r\nThe proposition made by Fra Francesco was taken to Savanarola; but as he\r\nhad never proposed the earlier challenge, he hesitated to accept the\r\nsecond; hereupon his disciple, Fra Domenico Bonvicini, more confident\r\nthan his master in his own power, declared himself ready to accept the\r\ntrial by fire in his stead; so certain was he that God would perform a\r\nmiracle by the intercession of Savonarola, His prophet.\r\n\r\nInstantly the report spread through Florence that the mortal challenge\r\nwas accepted; Savonarola’s partisans, all men of the strongest\r\nconvictions, felt no doubt as to the success of their cause. His enemies\r\nwere enchanted at the thought of the heretic giving himself to the\r\nflames; and the indifferent saw in the ordeal a spectacle of real and\r\nterrible interest.\r\n\r\nBut the devotion of Fra Bonvicini of Pescia was not what Fra Francesco\r\nwas reckoning with. He was willing, no doubt, to die a terrible death,\r\nbut on condition that Savanarola died with him. What mattered to him the\r\ndeath of an obscure disciple like Fra Bonvicini? It was the master he\r\nwould strike, the great teacher who must be involved in his own ruin. So\r\nhe refused to enter the fire except with Savonarola himself, and,\r\nplaying this terrible game in his own person, would not allow his\r\nadversary to play it by proxy.\r\n\r\nThen a thing happened which certainly no one could have anticipated. In\r\nthe place of Fra Francesco, who would not tilt with any but the master,\r\ntwo Franciscan monks appeared to tilt with the disciple. These were Fra\r\nNicholas de Pilly and Fra Andrea Rondinelli. Immediately the partisans\r\nof Savonarala, seeing this arrival of reinforcements for their\r\nantagonist, came forward in a crowd to try the ordeal. The Franciscans\r\nwere unwilling to be behindhand, and everybody took sides with equal\r\nardour for one or other party. All Florence was like a den of madmen;\r\neveryone wanted the ordeal, everyone wanted to go into the fire; not\r\nonly did men challenge one another, but women and even children were\r\nclamouring to be allowed to try. At last the Signoria, reserving this\r\nprivilege for the first applicants, ordered that the strange duel should\r\ntake place only between Fra Domenico Bonvicini and Fra Andrea\r\nRondinelli; ten of the citizens were to arrange all details; the day was\r\nfixed for the 7th of April, 1498, and the place the Piazza del Palazzo.\r\n\r\nThe judges of the field made their arrangements conscientiously. By\r\ntheir orders scaffolding was erected at the appointed place, five feet\r\nin height, ten in width, and eighty feet long. This scaffolding was\r\ncovered with faggots and heath, supported by cross-bars of the very\r\ndriest wood that could be found. Two narrow paths were made, two feet\r\nwide at most, their entrance giving an the Loggia dei Lanzi, their exit\r\nexactly opposite. The loggia was itself divided into two by a partition,\r\nso that each champion had a kind of room to make his preparations in,\r\njust as in the theatre every actor has his dressing-room; but in this\r\ninstance the tragedy that was about to be played was not a fictitious\r\none.\r\n\r\nThe Franciscans arrived on the piazza and entered the compartment\r\nreserved for them without making any religious demonstration; while\r\nSavonarola, on the contrary, advanced to his own place in the\r\nprocession, wearing the sacerdotal robes in which he had just celebrated\r\nthe Holy Eucharist, and holding in his hand the sacred host for all the\r\nworld to see, as it was enclosed in a crystal tabernacle. Fra Domenico\r\ndi Pescia, the hero of the occasion, followed, bearing a crucifix, and\r\nall the Dominican monks, their red crosses in their hands, marched\r\nbehind singing a psalm; while behind them again followed the most\r\nconsiderable of the citizens of their party, bearing torches, for, sure\r\nas they were of the triumph of their cause, they wished to fire the\r\nfaggots themselves. The piazza was so crowded that the people overflowed\r\ninto all the streets around. In every door and window there was nothing\r\nto be seen but heads ranged one above the other; the terraces were\r\ncovered with people, and curious spectators were observed on the roof of\r\nthe Duomo and on the top of the Campanile.\r\n\r\nBut, brought face to face with the ordeal, the Franciscans raised such\r\ndifficulties that it was very plain the heart of their champion was\r\nfailing him. The first fear they expressed was that Fra Bonvicini was an\r\nenchanter, and so carried about him some talisman or charm which would\r\nsave him from the fire. So they insisted that he should be stripped of\r\nall his clothes and put on others to be inspected by witnesses. Fra\r\nBonvicini made no objection, though the suspicion was humiliating; he\r\nchanged shirt, dress, and cowl. Then, when the Franciscans observed that\r\nSavanarola was placing the tabernacle in his hands, they protested that\r\nit was profanation to expose the sacred host to the risk of burning,\r\nthat this was not in the bond, and if Bonvicini would not give up this\r\nsupernatural aid, they far their part would give up the trial\r\naltogether. Savonarola replied that it was not astonishing that the\r\nchampion of religion who put his faith in God should bear in his hands\r\nthat very God to whom he entrusted his salvation. But this reply did not\r\nsatisfy the Franciscans, who were unwilling to let go their contention.\r\nSavonarola remained inflexible, supporting his own right, and thus\r\nnearly four hours passed in the discussion of points which neither party\r\nwould give up, and affairs remained in ’statu quo’. Meanwhile the\r\npeople, jammed together in the streets, on the terraces, on the roofs,\r\nsince break of day, were suffering from hunger and thirst and beginning\r\nto get impatient: their impatience soon developed into loud murmurs,\r\nwhich reached even the champions’ ears, so that the partisans of\r\nSavonarala, who felt such faith in him that they were confident of a\r\nmiracle, entreated him to yield to all the conditions suggested. To this\r\nSavonarola replied that if it were himself making the trial he would be\r\nless inexorable; but since another man was incurring the danger; he\r\ncould not take too many precautions. Two more hours passed, while his\r\npartisans tried in vain to combat his refusals. At last, as night was\r\ncoming on and the people grew ever more and more impatient and their\r\nmurmurs began to assume a threatening tone, Bonvicini declared that he\r\nwas ready to walk through the fire, holding nothing in his hand but a\r\ncrucifix. No one could refuse him this; so Fra Rondinelli was compelled\r\nto accept his proposition. The announcement was made to the populace\r\nthat the champions had come to terms and the trial was about to take\r\nplace. At this news the people calmed down, in the hope of being\r\ncompensated at last for their long wait; but at that very moment a storm\r\nwhich had long been threatening broke over Florence with such fury that\r\nthe faggots which had just been lighted were extinguished by the rain,\r\nleaving no possibility of their rekindling. From the moment when the\r\npeople suspected that they had been fooled, their enthusiasm was changed\r\ninto derision. They were ignorant from which side the difficulties had\r\narisen that had hindered the trial, so they laid the responsibility on\r\nboth champions without distinction. The Signoria, foreseeing the\r\ndisorder that was now imminent, ordered the assembly to retire; but the\r\nassembly thought otherwise, and stayed on the piazza, waiting for the\r\ndeparture of the two champions, in spite of the fearful rain that still\r\nfell in torrents. Rondinelli was taken back amid shouts and hootings,\r\nand pursued with showers of stones. Savonarola, thanks to his sacred\r\ngarments and the host which he still carried, passed calmly enough\r\nthrough the midst of the mob—a miracle quite as remarkable as if he had\r\npassed through the fire unscathed.\r\n\r\nBut it was only the sacred majesty of the host that had protected this\r\nman, who was indeed from this moment regarded as a false prophet: the\r\ncrowd allowed Savonarola to return to his convent, but they regretted\r\nthe necessity, so excited were they by the Arrabbiati party, who had\r\nalways denounced him as a liar and a hypocrite. So when the next\r\nmorning, Palm Sunday, he stood up in the pulpit to explain his conduct,\r\nhe could not obtain a moment’s silence for insults, hooting, and loud\r\nlaughter. Then the outcry, at first derisive, became menacing:\r\nSavonarola, whose voice was too weak to subdue the tumult, descended\r\nfrom his pulpit, retired into the sacristy, and thence to his convent,\r\nwhere he shut himself up in his cell. At that moment a cry was heard,\r\nand was repeated by everybody present:\r\n\r\n\"To San Marco, to San Marco!\" The rioters, few at first, were recruited\r\nby all the populace as they swept along the streets, and at last reached\r\nthe convent, dashing like an angry sea against the wall.\r\n\r\nThe doors, closed on Savonarala’s entrance, soon crashed before the\r\nvehement onset of the powerful multitude, which struck down on the\r\ninstant every obstacle it met: the whole convent was quickly flooded\r\nwith people, and Savonarola, with his two confederates, Domenico\r\nBonvicini and Silvestro Maruffi, was arrested in his cell, and conducted\r\nto prison amid the insults of the crowd, who, always in extremes,\r\nwhether of enthusiasm or hatred, would have liked to tear them to\r\npieces, and would not be quieted till they had exacted a promise that\r\nthe prisoners should be forcibly compelled to make the trial of fire\r\nwhich they had refused to make of their own free will.\r\n\r\nAlexander VI, as we may suppose, had not been without influence in\r\nbringing about this sudden and astonishing reaction, although he was not\r\npresent in person; and had scarcely learned the news of Savonarola’s\r\nfall and arrest when he claimed him as subject to ecclesiastical\r\njurisdiction. But in spite of the grant of indulgences wherewith this\r\ndemand was accompanied, the Signoria insisted that Savonarola’s trial\r\nshould take place at Florence, adding a request so as not to appear to\r\nwithdraw the accused completely from the pontifical authority—that the\r\npope would send two ecclesiastical judges to sit in the Florentine\r\ntribunal. Alexander, seeing that he would get nothing better from the\r\nmagnificent republic, sent as deputies Gioacchino Turriano of Venice,\r\nGeneral of the Dominicans, and Francesco Ramolini, doctor in law: they\r\npractically brought the sentence with them, declaring Savonarola and his\r\naccomplices heretics, schismatics, persecutors of the Church and\r\nseducers of the people.\r\n\r\nThe firmness shown by the Florentines in claiming their rights of\r\njurisdiction were nothing but an empty show to save appearances; the\r\ntribunal, as a fact, was composed of eight members, all known to be\r\nfervent haters of Savonarola, whose trial began with the torture. The\r\nresult was that, feeble in body constitutionally nervous and irritable,\r\nhe had not been able to endure the rack, and, overcome by agony just at\r\nthe moment when the executioner had lifted him up by the wrists and then\r\ndropped him a distance of two feet to the ground, he had confessed, in\r\norder to get some respite, that his prophecies were nothing more than\r\nconjectures. It is true that, so soon as he went back to prison, he\r\nprotested against the confession, saying that it was the weakness of his\r\nbodily organs and his want of firmness that had wrested the lie from\r\nhim, but that the truth really was that the Lord had several times\r\nappeared to him in his ecstasies and revealed the things that he had\r\nspoken. This protestation led to a new application of the torture,\r\nduring which Savonarola succumbed once more to the dreadful pain, and\r\nonce more retracted. But scarcely was he unbound, and was still lying on\r\nthe bed of torture, when he declared that his confessions were the fault\r\nof his torturers, and the vengeance would recoil upon their heads; and\r\nhe protested yet once more against all he had confessed and might\r\nconfess again. A third time the torture produced the same avowals, and\r\nthe relief that followed it the same retractions. The judges therefore,\r\nwhen they condemned him and his two disciples to the flames, decided\r\nthat his confession should not be read aloud at the stake, according to\r\ncustom, feeling certain that on this occasion also he would give it the\r\nlie, and that publicly, which, as anyone must see who knew the versatile\r\nspirit of the public, would be a most dangerous proceeding.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of May, the fire which had been promised to the people\r\nbefore was a second time prepared on the Piazza del Palazzo, and this\r\ntime the crowd assembled quite certain that they would not be\r\ndisappointed of a spectacle so long anticipated. And towards eleven\r\no’clock in the morning, Girolamo Savonarola, Domenico Bonvicini, and\r\nSilvestro Maruffi were led to the place of execution, degraded of their\r\norders by the ecclesiastical judges, and bound all three to the same\r\nstake in the centre of an immense pile of wood. Then the bishop\r\nPagnanoli told the condemned men that he cut them off from the Church.\r\n\"Ay, from the Church militant,\" said Savonarola, who from that very\r\nhour, thanks to his martyrdom, was entering into the Church triumphant.\r\nNo other words were spoken by the condemned men, for at this moment one\r\nof the Arrabbiati, a personal enemy of Savonarola, breaking through the\r\nhedge of guards around the scaffold, snatched the torch from the\r\nexecutioner’s hand and himself set fire to the four corners of the pile.\r\nSavonarola and his disciples, from the moment when they saw the smoke\r\narise, began to sing a psalm, and the flames enwrapped them on all sides\r\nwith a glowing veil, while their religious song was yet heard mounting\r\nupward to the gates of heaven.\r\n\r\nPope Alexander VI was thus set free from perhaps the most formidable\r\nenemy who had ever risen against him, and the pontifical vengeance\r\npursued the victims even after their death: the Signoria, yielding to\r\nhis wishes, gave orders that the ashes of the prophet and his disciples\r\nshould be thrown into the Arno. But certain half-burned fragments were\r\npicked up by the very soldiers whose business it was to keep the people\r\nback from approaching the fire, and the holy relics are even now shown,\r\nblackened by the flames, to the faithful, who if they no longer regard\r\nSavonarola as a prophet, revere him none the less as a martyr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nThe French army was now preparing to cross the Alps a second time, under\r\nthe command of Trivulce. Louis XII had come as far as Lyons in the\r\ncompany of Caesar Borgia and Giuliano della Rovere, on whom he had\r\nforced a reconciliation, and towards the beginning of the month of May\r\nhad sent his vanguard before him, soon to be followed by the main body\r\nof the army. The forces he was employing in this second campaign of\r\nconquest were 1600, lances, 5000 Swiss, 9000 Gascons, and 3500 infantry,\r\nraised from all parts of France. On the 13th of August this whole body,\r\namounting to nearly 15,000 men, who were to combine their forces with\r\nthe Venetians, arrived beneath the walls of Arezzo, and immediately laid\r\nsiege to the town.\r\n\r\nLudovico Sforza’s position was a terrible one: he was now suffering from\r\nhis imprudence in calling the French into Italy; all the allies he had\r\nthought he might count upon were abandoning him at the same moment,\r\neither because they were busy about their own affairs, or because they\r\nwere afraid of the powerful enemy that the Duke of Milan had made for\r\nhimself. Maximilian, who had promised him a contribution of 400 lances,\r\nto make up for not renewing the hostilities with Louis XII that had been\r\ninterrupted, had just made a league with the circle of Swabia to war\r\nagainst the Swiss, whom he had declared rebels against the Empire. The\r\nFlorentines, who had engaged to furnish him with 300 men-at-arms and\r\n2000 infantry, if he would help them to retake Pisa, had just retracted\r\ntheir promise because of Louis XII’s threats, and had undertaken to\r\nremain neutral. Frederic, who was holding back his troops for the\r\ndefence of his own States, because he supposed, not without reason,\r\nthat, Milan once conquered, he would again have to defend Naples, sent\r\nhim no help, no men, no money, in spite of his promises. Ludovico Sforza\r\nwas therefore reduced to his own proper forces.\r\n\r\nBut as he was a man powerful in arms and clever in artifice, he did not\r\nallow himself to succumb at the first blow, and in all haste fortified\r\nAnnona, Novarro, and Alessandria, sent off Cajazzo with troops to that\r\npart of the Milanese territory which borders on the states of Venice,\r\nand collected on the Po as many troops as he could. But these\r\nprecautions availed him nothing against the impetuous onslaught of the\r\nFrench, who in a few days had taken Annona, Arezzo, Novarro, Voghiera,\r\nCastelnuovo, Ponte Corona, Tartone, and Alessandria, while Trivulce was\r\non the march to Milan.\r\n\r\nSeeing the rapidity of this conquest and their numerous victories,\r\nLudovico Sforza, despairing of holding out in his capital, resolved to\r\nretire to Germany, with his children, his brother, Cardinal Ascanio\r\nSforza, and his treasure, which had been reduced in the course of eight\r\nyears from 1,500,000 to 200,000 ducats. But before he went he left\r\nBernardino da Carte in charge of the castle of Milan. In vain did his\r\nfriends warn him to distrust this man, in vain did his brother Ascanio\r\noffer to hold the fortress himself, and offer to hold it to the very\r\nlast; Ludovico refused to make any change in his arrangements, and\r\nstarted on the 2nd of September, leaving in the citadel three thousand\r\nfoot and enough provisions, ammunition, and money to sustain a siege of\r\nseveral months.\r\n\r\nTwo days after Ludovico’s departure, the French entered Milan. Ten days\r\nlater Bernardino da Come gave up the castle before a single gun had been\r\nfired. Twenty-one days had sufficed for the French to get possession of\r\nthe various towns, the capital, and all the territories of their enemy.\r\n\r\nLouis XII received the news of this success while he was at Lyons, and\r\nhe at once started for Milan, where he was received with demonstrations\r\nof joy that were really sincere. Citizens of every rank had come out\r\nthree miles’ distance from the gates to receive him, and forty boys,\r\ndressed in cloth of gold and silk, marched before him singing hymns of\r\nvictory composed by poets of the period, in which the king was styled\r\ntheir liberator and the envoy of freedom. The great joy of the Milanese\r\npeople was due to the fact that friends of Louis had been spreading\r\nreports beforehand that the King of France was rich enough to abolish\r\nall taxes. And so soon as the second day from his arrival at Milan the\r\nconqueror made some slight reduction, granted important favours to\r\ncertain Milanese gentlemen, and bestowed the town of Vigavano on\r\nTrivulce as a reward for his swift and glorious campaign. But Caesar\r\nBorgia, who had followed Louis XII with a view to playing his part in\r\nthe great hunting-ground of Italy, scarcely waited for him to attain his\r\nend when he claimed the fulfilment of his promise, which the king with\r\nhis accustomed loyalty hastened to perform. He instantly put at the\r\ndisposal of Caesar three hundred lances under the command of Yves\r\nd’Alegre, and four thousand Swiss under the command of the bailiff of\r\nDijon, as a help in his work of reducing the Vicars of the Church.\r\n\r\nWe must now explain to our readers who these new personages were whom we\r\nintroduce upon the scene by the above name.\r\n\r\nDuring the eternal wars of Guelphs and Ghibelines and the long exile of\r\nthe popes at Avignon, most of the towns and fortresses of the Romagna\r\nhad been usurped by petty tyrants, who for the most part hard received\r\nfrom the Empire the investiture of their new possessions; but ever since\r\nGerman influence had retired beyond the Alps, and the popes had again\r\nmade Rome the centre of the Christian world, all the small princes,\r\nrobbed of their original protector, had rallied round the papal see, and\r\nreceived at the hands of the pope a new investiture, and now they paid\r\nannual dues, for which they received the particular title of duke,\r\ncount, or lord, and the general name of Vicar of the Church.\r\n\r\nIt had been no difficult matter for Alexander, scrupulously examining\r\nthe actions and behaviour of these gentlemen during the seven years that\r\nhad elapsed since he was exalted to St. Peter’s throne, to find in the\r\nconduct of each one of them something that could be called an infraction\r\nof the treaty made between vassals and suzerain; accordingly he brought\r\nforward his complaints at a tribunal established for the purpose, and\r\nobtained sentence from the judges to the effect that the vicars of the\r\nChurch, having failed to fulfil the conditions of their investiture,\r\nwere despoiled of their domains, which would again become the property\r\nof the Holy See. As the pope was now dealing with men against whom it\r\nwas easier to pass a sentence than to get it carried out, he had\r\nnominated as captain-general the new Duke of Valentinois, who was\r\ncommissioned to recover the territories for his own benefit. The lords\r\nin question were the Malatesti of Rimini, the Sforza of Pesaro, the\r\nManfredi of Faenza, the Riarii of Imola and Farli, the Variani of\r\nCamerina, the Montefeltri of Urbino, and the Caetani of Sermoneta.\r\n\r\nBut the Duke of Valentinois, eager to keep as warm as possible his great\r\nfriendship with his ally and relative Louis XII, was, as we know,\r\nstaying with him at Milan so long as he remained there, where, after a\r\nmonth’s occupation, the king retraced his steps to his own capital, the\r\nDuke of Valentinois ordered his men-at-arms and his Swiss to await him\r\nbetween Parma and Modena, and departed posthaste for Rome, to explain\r\nhis plans to his father viva voce and to receive his final instructions.\r\nWhen he arrived, he found that the fortune of his sister Lucrezia had\r\nbeen greatly augmented in his absence, not from the side of her husband\r\nAlfonso, whose future was very uncertain now in consequence of Louis’s\r\nsuccesses, which had caused some coolness between Alfonso and the pope,\r\nbut from her father’s side, upon whom at this time she exercised an\r\ninfluence more astonishing than ever. The pope had declared Lucrezia\r\nBorgia of Aragon life-governor of Spoleto and its duchy, with all\r\nemoluments, rights, and revenues accruing thereunto. This had so greatly\r\nincreased her power and improved her position, that in these days she\r\nnever showed herself in public without a company of two hundred horses\r\nridden by the most illustrious ladies and noblest knights of Rome.\r\nMoreover, as the twofold affection of her father was a secret to nobody,\r\nthe first prelates in the Church, the frequenters of the Vatican, the\r\nfriends of His Holiness, were all her most humble servants; cardinals\r\ngave her their hands when she stepped from her litter or her horse,\r\narchbishops disputed the honour of celebrating mass in her private\r\napartments.\r\n\r\nBut Lucrezia had been obliged to quit Rome in order to take possession\r\nof her new estates; and as her father could not spend much time away\r\nfrom his beloved daughter, he resolved to take into his hands the town\r\nof Nepi, which on a former occasion, as the reader will doubtless\r\nremember, he had bestowed on Ascanio Sforza in exchange for his\r\nsuffrage. Ascanio had naturally lost this town when he attached himself\r\nto the fortunes of the Duke of Milan, his brother; and when the pope was\r\nabout to take it again, he invited his daughter Lucrezia to join him\r\nthere and be present at the rejoicings held in honour of his resuming\r\nits possession.\r\n\r\nLucrezia’s readiness in giving way to her father’s wishes brought her a\r\nnew gift from him: this was the town and territory of Sermoneta, which\r\nbelonged to the Caetani. Of course the gift was as yet a secret, because\r\nthe two owners of the seigneury, had first to be disposed of, one being\r\nMonsignore Giacomo Caetano, apostolic protonotary, the other Prospero\r\nCaetano, a young cavalier of great promise; but as both lived at Rome,\r\nand entertained no suspicion, but indeed supposed themselves to be in\r\nhigh favour with His Holiness, the one by virtue of his position, the\r\nother of his courage, the matter seemed to present no great difficulty.\r\nSo directly after the return of Alexander to Rome, Giacomo Caetano was\r\narrested, on what pretext we know not, was taken to the castle of Sant’\r\nAngelo, and there died shortly after, of poison: Prospero Caetano was\r\nstrangled in his own house. After these two deaths, which both occurred\r\nso suddenly as to give no time for either to make a will, the pope\r\ndeclared that Sermoneta and all of her property appertaining to the\r\nCaetani devolved upon the apostolic chamber; and they were sold to\r\nLucrezia for the sum of 80,000 crowns, which her father refunded to her\r\nthe day after. Though Caesar hurried to Rome, he found when he arrived\r\nthat his father had been beforehand with him, and had made a beginning\r\nof his conquests.\r\n\r\nAnother fortune also had been making prodigious strides during Caesar’s\r\nstay in France, viz. the fortune of Gian Borgia, the pope’s nephew, who\r\nhad been one of the most devoted friends of the Duke of Gandia up to the\r\ntime of his death. It was said in Rome, and not in a whisper, that the\r\nyoung cardinal owed the favours heaped upon him by His Holiness less to\r\nthe memory of the brother than to the protection of the sister. Both\r\nthese reasons made Gian Borgia a special object of suspicion to Caesar,\r\nand it was with an inward vow that he should not enjoy his new dignities\r\nvery long that the Duke of Valentinois heard that his cousin Gian had\r\njust been nominated cardinal ’a latere’ of all the Christian world, and\r\nhad quitted Rome to make a circuit through all the pontifical states\r\nwith a suite of archbishops, bishops, prelates, and gentlemen, such as\r\nwould have done honour to the pope himself.\r\n\r\nCaesar had only come to Rome to get news; so he only stayed three days,\r\nand then, with all the troops His Holiness could supply, rejoined his\r\nforces on the borders of the Euza, and marched at once to Imola. This\r\ntown, abandoned by its chiefs, who had retired to Forli, was forced to\r\ncapitulate. Imola taken, Caesar marched straight upon Forli. There he\r\nmet with a serious check; a check, moreover, which came from a woman.\r\nCaterina Sforza, widow of Girolamo and mother of Ottaviano Riario, had\r\nretired to this town, and stirred up the courage of the garrison by\r\nputting herself, her goods and her person, under their protection.\r\nCaesar saw that it was no longer a question of a sudden capture, but of\r\na regular siege; so he began to make all his arrangements with a view to\r\nit, and placing a battery of cannon in front of the place where the\r\nwalls seemed to him weakest, he ordered an uninterrupted fire, to be\r\ncontinued until the breach was practicable.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to the camp after giving this order, he found there\r\nGian Borgia, who had gone to Rome from Ferrara and was unwilling to be\r\nso near Caesar without paying him a visit: he was received with effusion\r\nand apparently the greatest joy, and stayed three days; on the fourth\r\nday all the officers and members of the court were invited to a grand\r\nfarewell supper, and Caesar bade farewell to his cousin, charging him\r\nwith despatches for the pope, and lavishing upon him all the tokens of\r\naffection he had shown on his arrival.\r\n\r\nCardinal Gian Borgia posted off as soon as he left the supper-table, but\r\non arriving at Urbino he was seized with such a sudden and strange\r\nindisposition that he was forced to stop; but after a few minutes,\r\nfeeling rather better, he went an; scarcely, however, had he entered\r\nRocca Cantrada when he again felt so extremely ill that he resolved to\r\ngo no farther, and stayed a couple of days in the town. Then, as he\r\nthought he was a little better again, and as he had heard the news of\r\nthe taking of Forli and also that Caterina Sforza had been taken\r\nprisoner while she was making an attempt to retire into the castle, he\r\nresolved to go back to Caesar and congratulate him on his victory; but\r\nat Fassambrane he was forced to stop a third time, although he had given\r\nup his carriage for a litter. This was his last halt: the same day he\r\nsought his bed, never to rise from it again; three days later he was\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nHis body was taken to Rome and buried without any ceremony in the church\r\nof Santa Maria del Populo, where lay awaiting him the corpse of his\r\nfriend the Duke of Gandia; and there was now no more talk of the young\r\ncardinal, high as his rank had been, than if he had never existed. Thus\r\nin gloom and silence passed away all those who were swept to destruction\r\nby the ambition of that terrible trio, Alexander, Lucrezia, and Caesar.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same time Rome was terrified by another murder. Don\r\nGiovanni Cerviglione, a gentleman by birth and a brave soldier, captain\r\nof the pope’s men-at-arms, was attacked one evening by the sbirri, as he\r\nwas on his way home from supping with Don Elisio Pignatelli. One of the\r\nmen asked his name, and as he pronounced it, seeing that there was no\r\nmistake, plunged a dagger into his breast, while a second man with a\r\nback stroke of his sword cut off his head, which lay actually at his\r\nfeet before his body had time to fall.\r\n\r\nThe governor of Rome lodged a complaint against this assassination with\r\nthe pope; but quickly perceiving, by the way his intimation was\r\nreceived, that he would have done better to say nothing, he stopped the\r\ninquiries he had started, so that neither of the murderers was ever\r\narrested. But the rumour was circulated that Caesar, in the short stay\r\nhe had made at Rome, had had a rendezvous with Cerviglione’s wife, who\r\nwas a Borgia by birth, and that her husband when he heard of this\r\ninfringement of conjugal duty had been angry enough to threaten her and\r\nher lover, too: the threat had reached Caesar’s ears, who, making a long\r\narm of Michelotto, had, himself at Forli, struck down Cerviglione in the\r\nstreets of Rome.\r\n\r\nAnother unexpected death followed so quickly on that of Don Giovanni\r\nCerviglione that it could not but be attributed to the same originator,\r\nif not to the same cause. Monsignore Agnelli of Mantua, archbishop of\r\nCosenza, clerk of the chamber and vice-legate of Viterbo, having fallen\r\ninto disgrace with His Holiness, how it is not known, was poisoned at\r\nhis own table, at which he had passed a good part of the night in\r\ncheerful conversation with three or four guests, the poison gliding\r\nmeanwhile through his veins; then going to bed in perfect health, he was\r\nfound dead in the morning. His possessions were at once divided into\r\nthree portions: the land and houses were given to the Duke of\r\nValentinois; the bishopric went to Francesco Borgia, son of Calixtus\r\nIII; and the office of clerk of the chamber was sold for 5000 ducats to\r\nVentura Bonnassai, a merchant of Siena, who produced this sum for\r\nAlexander, and settled down the very same day in the Vatican.\r\n\r\nThis last death served the purpose of determining a point of law\r\nhitherto uncertain: as Monsignore Agnelli’s natural heirs had made some\r\ndifficulty about being disinherited, Alexander issued a brief; whereby\r\nhe took from every cardinal and every priest the right of making a will,\r\nand declared that all their property should henceforth devolve upon him.\r\n\r\nBut Caesar was stopped short in the midst of his victories. Thanks to\r\nthe 200,000 ducats that yet remained in his treasury, Ludovico Sforza\r\nhad levied 500 men-at-arms from Burgundy and 8000 Swiss infantry, with\r\nwhom he had entered Lombardy. So Trivulce, to face this enemy, had been\r\ncompelled to call back Yves d’Alegre and the troops that Louis XII had\r\nlent to Caesar; consequently Caesar, leaving behind a body of pontifical\r\nsoldiery as garrison at Forli and Imola, betook himself with the rest of\r\nhis force to Rome.\r\n\r\nIt was Alexander’s wish that his entry should be a triumph; so when he\r\nlearned that the quartermasters of the army were only a few leagues from\r\nthe town, he sent out runners to invite the royal ambassadors, the\r\ncardinals, the prelates, the Roman barons, and municipal dignitaries to\r\nmake procession with all their suite to meet the Duke of Valentinois;\r\nand as it always happens that the pride of those who command is\r\nsurpassed by the baseness of those who obey, the orders were not only\r\nfulfilled to the letter, but beyond it.\r\n\r\nThe entry of Caesar took place on the 26th of February, 1500. Although\r\nthis was the great Jubilee year, the festivals of the carnival began\r\nnone the less for that, and were conducted in a manner even more\r\nextravagant and licentious than usual; and the conqueror after the first\r\nday prepared a new display of ostentation, which he concealed under the\r\nveil of a masquerade. As he was pleased to identify himself with the\r\nglory, genius, and fortune of the great man whose name he bore, he\r\nresolved on a representation of the triumph of Julius Caesar, to be\r\ngiven on the Piazzi di Navona, the ordinary place for holding the\r\ncarnival fetes. The next day, therefore, he and his retinue started from\r\nthat square, and traversed all the streets of Rome, wearing classical\r\ncostumes and riding in antique cars, on one of which Caesar stood, clad\r\nin the robe of an emperor of old, his brow crowned with a golden laurel\r\nwreath, surrounded by lictors, soldiers, and ensign-bearers, who carried\r\nbanners whereon was inscribed the motto, ’Aut Caesar aut nihil’.\r\n\r\nFinally, on the fourth Sunday, in Lent, the pope conferred upon Caesar\r\nthe dignity he had so long coveted, and appointed him general and\r\ngonfaloniere of the Holy Church.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Sforza had crossed the Alps and passed the Lake of\r\nComo, amid acclamations of joy from his former subjects, who had quickly\r\nlost the enthusiasm that the French army and Louis’s promises had\r\ninspired. These demonstrations were so noisy at Milan, that Trivulce,\r\njudging that there was no safety for a French garrison in remaining\r\nthere, made his way to Navarra. Experience proved that he was not\r\ndeceived; for scarcely had the Milanese observed his preparations for\r\ndeparture when a suppressed excitement began to spread through the town,\r\nand soon the streets were filled with armed men. This murmuring crowd\r\nhad to be passed through, sword in hand and lance in rest; and scarcely\r\nhad the French got outside the gates when the mob rushed out after the\r\narmy into the country, pursuing them with shouts and hooting as far as\r\nthe banks of the Tesino. Trivulce left 400 lances at Novarra as well as\r\nthe 3000 Swiss that Yves d’Alegre had brought from the Romagna, and\r\ndirected his course with the rest of the army towards Mortara, where he\r\nstopped at last to await the help he had demanded from the King of\r\nFrance. Behind him Cardinal Ascanio and Ludovico entered Milan amid the\r\nacclamations of the whole town.\r\n\r\nNeither of them lost any time, and wishing to profit by this enthusiasm,\r\nAscanio undertook to besiege the castle of Milan while Ludovico should\r\ncross the Tesino and attack Novarra.\r\n\r\nThere besiegers and besieged were sons of the same nation; for Yves\r\nd’Alegre had scarcely as many as 300 French with him, and Ludovico 500\r\nItalians. In fact, for the last sixteen years the Swiss had been\r\npractically the only infantry in Europe, and all the Powers came, purse\r\nin hand, to draw from the mighty reservoir of their mountains. The\r\nconsequence was that these rude children of William Tell, put up to\r\nauction by the nations, and carried away from the humble, hardy life of\r\na mountain people into cities of wealth and pleasure, had lost, not\r\ntheir ancient courage, but that rigidity of principle for which they had\r\nbeen distinguished before their intercourse with other nations. From\r\nbeing models of honour and good faith they had become a kind of\r\nmarketable ware, always ready for sale to the highest bidder. The French\r\nwere the first to experience this venality, which later-on proved so\r\nfatal to Ludovico Sforza.\r\n\r\nNow the Swiss in the garrison at Novarra had been in communication with\r\ntheir compatriots in the vanguard of the ducal army, and when they found\r\nthat they, who as a fact were unaware that Ludavico’s treasure was\r\nnearly exhausted, were better fed as well as better paid than\r\nthemselves, they offered to give up the town and go over to the\r\nMilanese, if they could be certain of the same pay. Ludovico, as we may\r\nwell suppose, closed with this bargain. The whole of Novarra was given\r\nup to him except the citadel, which was defended by Frenchmen: thus the\r\nenemy’s army was recruited by 3000 men. Then Ludovico made the mistake\r\nof stopping to besiege the castle instead of marching on to Mortara with\r\nthe new reinforcement. The result of this was that Louis XII, to whom\r\nrunners had been sent by Trivulce, understanding his perilous position,\r\nhastened the departure of the French gendarmerie who were already\r\ncollected to cross into Italy, sent off the bailiff of Dijon to levy new\r\nSwiss forces, and ordered Cardinal Amboise, his prime minister, to cross\r\nthe Alps and take up a position at Asti, to hurry on the work of\r\ncollecting the troops. There the cardinal found a nest-egg of 3000 men.\r\nLa Trimouille added 1500 lances and 6000 French infantry; finally, the\r\nbailiff of Dijon arrived with 10,000 Swiss; so that, counting the troops\r\nwhich Trivulce had at Mortara, Louis XII found himself master on the\r\nother side of the Alps of the first army any French king had ever led\r\nout to battle. Soon, by good marching, and before Ludovico knew the\r\nstrength or even the existence of this army, it took up a position\r\nbetween Novarra and Milan, cutting off all communication between the\r\nduke and his capital. He was therefore compelled, in spite of his\r\ninferior numbers, to prepare for a pitched battle.\r\n\r\nBut it so happened that just when the preparations for a decisive\r\nengagement were being made on both sides, the Swiss Diet, learning that\r\nthe sons of Helvetia were on the point of cutting one another’s throats,\r\nsent orders to all the Swiss serving in either army to break their\r\nengagements and return to the fatherland. But during the two months that\r\nhad passed between the surrender of Novarra and the arrival of the\r\nFrench army before the town, there had been a very great change in the\r\nface of things, because Ludovico Sforza’s treasure was now exhausted.\r\nNew confabulations had gone on between the outposts, and this time,\r\nthanks to the money sent by Louis XII, it was the Swiss in the service\r\nof France who were found to be the better fed and better paid. The\r\nworthy Helvetians, since they no longer fought for their own liberty,\r\nknew the value of their blood too well to allow a single drop of it to\r\nbe spilled for less than its weight in gold: the result was that, as\r\nthey had, betrayed Yves d’Alegre, they resolved to betray Ludovico\r\nSforza too; and while the recruits brought in by the bailiff of Dijon\r\nwere standing firmly by the French flag, careless of the order of the\r\nDiet, Ludovico’s auxiliaries declared that in fighting against their\r\nSwiss brethren they would be acting in disobedience to the Diet, and\r\nwould risk capital punishment in the end—a danger that nothing would\r\ninduce them to incur unless they immediately received the arrears of\r\ntheir pay. The duke, who had spent the last ducat he had with him, and was\r\nentirely cut off from his capital, knew that he could not get money till\r\nhe had fought his way through to it, and therefore invited the Swiss to\r\nmake one last effort, promising them not only the pay that was in\r\narrears but a double hire. But unluckily the fulfilment of this promise\r\nwas dependent on the doubtful issue of a battle, and the Swiss replied\r\nthat they had far too much respect for their country to disobey its\r\ndecree, and that they loved their brothers far too well to consent to\r\nshed their blood without reward; and therefore Sforza would do well not\r\nto count upon them, since indeed the very next day they proposed to\r\nreturn to their homes. The duke then saw that all was lost, but he made\r\na last appeal to their honour, adjuring them at least to ensure his\r\npersonal safety by making it a condition of capitulation. But they\r\nreplied that even if a condition of such a kind, would not make\r\ncapitulation impossible, it would certainly deprive them of advantages\r\nwhich they had a right to expect, and on which they counted as\r\nindemnification for the arrears of their pay. They pretended, however,\r\nat last that they were touched by the prayers of the man whose orders\r\nthey had obeyed so long, and offered to conceal him dressed in their\r\nclothes among their ranks. This proposition was barely plausible; far\r\nSforza was short and, by this time an old man, and he could not possibly\r\nescape recognition in the midst of an army where the oldest was not past\r\nthirty and the shortest not less than five foot six. Still, this was his\r\nlast chance, and he did not reject it at once, but tried to modify it so\r\nthat it might help him in his straits. His plan was to disguise himself\r\nas a Franciscan monk, so that mounted on a shabby horse he might pass\r\nfor their chaplain; the others, Galeazzo di San Severing, who commanded\r\nunder him, and his two brothers, were all tall men, so, adopting the\r\ndress of common soldiers, they hoped they might escape detection in the\r\nSwiss ranks.\r\n\r\nScarcely were these plans settled when the duke heard that the\r\ncapitulation was signed between Trivulce and the Swiss, who had made no\r\nstipulation in favour of him and his generals. They were to go over the\r\nnext day with arms and baggage right into the French army; so the last\r\nhope of the wretched Ludovico and his generals must needs be in their\r\ndisguise. And so it was. San Severino and his brothers took their place\r\nin the ranks of the infantry, and Sforza took his among the baggage,\r\nclad in a monk’s frock, with the hood pulled over his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe army marched off; but the Swiss, who had first trafficked in their\r\nblood, now trafficked in their honour. The French were warned of the\r\ndisguise of Sforza and his generals, and thus they were all four\r\nrecognised, and Sforza was arrested by Trimouille himself. It is said\r\nthat the price paid for this treason was the town of Bellinzona; for it\r\nthen belonged to the French, and when the Swiss returned to their\r\nmountains and took possession of it, Louis XII took no steps to get it\r\nback again.\r\n\r\nWhen Ascanio Sforza, who, as we know, had stayed at Milan, learned the\r\nnews of this cowardly desertion, he supposed that his cause was lost and\r\nthat it would be the best plan for him to fly, before he found himself a\r\nprisoner in the hand’s of his brother’s old subjects: such a change of\r\nface on the people’s part would be very natural, and they might propose\r\nperhaps to purchase their own pardon at the price of his liberty; so he\r\nfled by night with the chief nobles of the Ghibelline party, taking the\r\nroad to Piacenza, on his way to the kingdom of Naples. But when he\r\narrived at Rivolta, he remembered that there was living in that town an\r\nold friend of his childhood, by name Conrad Lando, whom he had helped to\r\nmuch wealth in his days of power; and as Ascanio and his companions were\r\nextremely tired, he resolved to beg his hospitality for a single night.\r\nConrad received them with every sign of joy, putting all his house and\r\nservants at their disposal. But scarcely had they retired to bed when he\r\nsent a runner to Piacenza, to inform Carlo Orsini, at that time\r\ncommanding the Venetian garrison, that he was prepared to deliver up\r\nCardinal Ascanio and the chief men of the Milanese army. Carlo Orsini\r\ndid not care to resign to another so important an expedition, and\r\nmounting hurriedly with twenty-five men, he first surrounded Conrads\r\nhouse, and then entered sword in hand the chamber wherein Ascanio and\r\nhis companions lay, and being surprised in the middle of their sleep,\r\nthey yielded without resistance. The prisoners were taken to Venice, but\r\nLouis XII claimed them, and they were given up. Thus the King of France\r\nfound himself master of Ludovico Sforza and of Ascania, of a legitimate\r\nnephew of the great Francesco Sforza named Hermes, of two bastards named\r\nAlessandro and Cortino, and of Francesco, son of the unhappy Gian\r\nGaleazza who had been poisoned by his uncle.\r\n\r\nLouis XII, wishing to make an end of the whole family at a blow, forced\r\nFrancesco to enter a cloister, shut up Cardinal Ascanio in the tower of\r\nBaurges, threw into prison Alessandro, Cartino, and Hermes, and finally,\r\nafter transferring the wretched Ludovico from the fortress of\r\nPierre-Eucise to Lys-Saint-George he relegated him for good and all to\r\nthe castle of Loches, where he lived for ten years in solitude and utter\r\ndestitution, and there died, cursing the day when the idea first came\r\ninto his head of enticing the French into Italy.\r\n\r\nThe news of the catastrophe of Ludovico and his family caused the\r\ngreatest joy at Rome, for, while the French were consolidating their\r\npower in Milanese territory, the Holy See was gaining ground in the\r\nRomagna, where no further opposition was offered to Caesar’s conquest.\r\nSo the runners who brought the news were rewarded with valuable\r\npresents, and it was published throughout the whole town of Rome to the\r\nsound of the trumpet and drum. The war-cry of Louis, France, France, and\r\nthat of the Orsini, Orso, Orso, rang through all the streets, which in\r\nthe evening were illuminated, as though Constantinople or Jerusalem had\r\nbeen taken. And the pope gave the people fetes and fireworks, without\r\ntroubling his head the least in the world either about its being Holy\r\nWeek, or because the Jubilee had attracted more than 200,000 people to\r\nRome; the temporal interests of his family seeming to him far more\r\nimportant than the spiritual interests of his subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nOne thing alone was wanting to assure the success of the vast projects\r\nthat the pope and his son were founding upon the friendship of Louis and\r\nan alliance with him—that is,—money. But Alexander was not the man to be\r\ntroubled about a paltry worry of that kind; true, the sale of benefices\r\nwas by now exhausted, the ordinary and extraordinary taxes had already\r\nbeen collected for the whole year, and the prospect of inheritance from\r\ncardinals and priests was a poor thing now that the richest of them had\r\nbeen poisoned; but Alexander had other means at his disposal, which were\r\nnone the less efficacious because they were less often used.\r\n\r\nThe first he employed was to spread a, report that the Turks were\r\nthreatening an invasion of Christendom, and that he knew for a positive\r\nfact that before the end of the summer Bajazet would land two\r\nconsiderable armies, one in Romagna, the other in Calabria; he therefore\r\npublished two bulls, one to levy tithes of all ecclesiastical revenues\r\nin Europe of whatever nature they might be, the other to force the Jews\r\ninto paying an equivalent sum: both bulls contained the severest\r\nsentences of excommunication against those who refused to submit, or\r\nattempted opposition.\r\n\r\nThe second plan was the selling of indulgences, a thing which had never\r\nbeen done before: these indulgences affected the people who had been\r\nprevented by reasons of health or business from coming to Rome for the\r\nJubilee; the journey by this expedient was rendered unnecessary, and\r\nsins were pardoned for a third of what it would have cost, and just as\r\ncompletely as if the faithful had fulfilled every condition of the\r\npilgrimage. For gathering in this tax a veritable army of collectors was\r\ninstituted, a certain Ludovico delta Torre at their head. The sum that\r\nAlexander brought into the pontifical treasury is incalculable, and some\r\nidea of it may be gathered from the fact that 799,000 livres in gold was\r\npaid in from the territory of Venice alone.\r\n\r\nBut as the Turks did as a fact make some sort of demonstration from the\r\nHungarian side, and the Venetians began to fear that they might be\r\ncoming in their direction, they asked for help from the pope, who gave\r\norders that at twelve o’clock in the day in all his States an Ave Maria\r\nshould be said, to pray God to avert the danger which was threatening\r\nthe most serene republic. This was the only help the Venetians got from\r\nHis Holiness in exchange for the 799,000 livres in gold that he had got\r\nfrom them.\r\n\r\nBut it seemed as though God wished to show His strange vicar on earth\r\nthat He was angered by the mockery of sacred things, and on the Eve of\r\nSt. Peter’s Day, just as the pope was passing the Capanile on his way to\r\nthe tribune of benedictions, a enormous piece of iron broke off and fell\r\nat his feet; and then, as though one warning had not been enough, on the\r\nnext day, St. Peter’s, when the pope happened to be in one of the rooms\r\nof his ordinary dwelling with Cardinal Capuano and Monsignare Poto, his\r\nprivate chamberlain, he saw through the open windows that a very black\r\ncloud was coming up. Foreseeing a thunderstorm, he ordered the cardinal\r\nand the chamberlain to shut the windows. He had not been mistaken; for\r\neven as they were obeying his command, there came up such a furious gust\r\nof wind that the highest chimney of the Vatican was overturned, just as\r\na tree is rooted up, and was dashed upon the roof, breaking it in;\r\nsmashing the upper flooring, it fell into the very room where they were.\r\nTerrified by the noise of this catastrophe, which made the whole palace\r\ntremble, the cardinal and Monsignore Poto turned round, and seeing the\r\nroom full of dust and debris, sprang out upon the parapet and shouted to\r\nthe guards at the gate, \"The pope is dead, the pope is dead!\" At this\r\ncry, the guards ran up and discovered three persons lying in the rubbish\r\non the floor, one dead and the other two dying. The dead man was a\r\ngentleman of Siena ailed Lorenzo Chigi, and the dying were two resident\r\nofficials of the Vatican. They had been walking across the floor above,\r\nand had been flung down with the debris. But Alexander was not to be\r\nfound; and as he gave no answer, though they kept on calling to him, the\r\nbelief that he had perished was confirmed, and very soon spread about\r\nthe town. But he had only fainted, and at the end of a certain time he\r\nbegan to come to himself, and moaned, whereupon he was discovered, dazed\r\nwith the blow, and injured, though not seriously, in several parts of\r\nhis body. He had been saved by little short of a miracle: a beam had\r\nbroken in half and had left each of its two ends in the side walls; and\r\none of these had formed a sort of roof aver the pontifical throne; the\r\npope, who was sitting there at the time, was protected by this\r\noverarching beam, and had received only a few contusions.\r\n\r\nThe two contradictory reports of the sudden death and the miraculous\r\npreservation of the pope spread rapidly through Rome; and the Duke of\r\nValentinois, terrified at the thought of what a change might be wrought\r\nin his own fortunes by any slight accident to the Holy Father, hurried\r\nto the Vatican, unable to assure himself by anything less than the\r\nevidence of his own eyes. Alexander desired to render public thanks to\r\nHeaven for the protection that had been granted him; and on the very\r\nsame day was carried to the church of Santa Maria del Popalo, escorted\r\nby a numerous procession of prelates and men-at arms, his pontifical\r\nseat borne by two valets, two equerries, and two grooms. In this church\r\nwere buried the Duke of Gandia and Gian Borgia, and perhaps Alexander\r\nwas drawn thither by some relics of devotion, or may be by the\r\nrecollection of his love for his former mistress, Rosa Vanazza, whose\r\nimage, in the guise of the Madonna, was exposed for the veneration of\r\nthe faithful in a chapel on the left of the high altar. Stopping before\r\nthis altar, the pope offered to the church the gift of a magnificent\r\nchalice in which were three hundred gold crowns, which the Cardinal of\r\nSiena poured out into a silver paten before the eyes of all, much to the\r\ngratification of the pontifical vanity.\r\n\r\nBut before he left Rome to complete the conquest of the Romagna, the\r\nDuke of Valentinois had been reflecting that the marriage, once so\r\nardently desired, between Lucrezia and Alfonso had been quite useless to\r\nhimself and his father. There was more than this to be considered: Louis\r\nXII’s rest in Lombardy was only a halt, and Milan was evidently but the\r\nstage before Naples. It was very possible that Louis was annoyed about\r\nthe marriage which converted his enemy’s nephew into the son-in-law of\r\nhis ally. Whereas, if Alfonso were dead, Lucrezia would be the position\r\nto marry some powerful lord of Ferrara or Brescia, who would be able to\r\nhelp his brother-in-law in the conquest of Romagna. Alfonso was now not\r\nonly useless but dangerous, which to anyone with the character of the\r\nBorgias perhaps seemed worse, the death of Alfonso was resolved upon.\r\nBut Lucrezia’s husband, who had understoond for a long time past what\r\ndanger he incurred by living near his terrible father-in-law, had\r\nretired to Naples. Since, however, neither Alexander nor Caesar had\r\nchanged in their perpetual dissimulation towards him, he was beginning\r\nto lose his fear, when he received an invitation from the pope and his\r\nson to take part in a bull-fight which was to be held in the Spanish\r\nfashion in honour of the duke before his departure: In the present\r\nprecarious position of Naples it would not have been good policy for\r\nAlfonso to afford Alexander any sort of pretext for a rupture, so he\r\ncould not refuse without a motive, and betook himself to Rome. It was\r\nthought of no use to consult Lucrezia in this affair, for she had two or\r\nthree times displayed an absurd attachment for her husband, and they\r\nleft her undisturbed in her government of Spoleto.\r\n\r\nAlfonso was received by the pope and the duke with every demonstration\r\nof sincere friendship, and rooms in the Vatican were assigned to him\r\nthat he had inhabited before with Lucrezia, in that part of the building\r\nwhich is known as the Torre Nuova.\r\n\r\nGreat lists were prepared on the Piazza of St. Peter’s; the streets\r\nabout it were barricaded, and the windows of the surrounding houses\r\nserved as boxes for the spectators. The pope and his court took their\r\nplaces on the balconies of the Vatican.\r\n\r\nThe fete was started by professional toreadors: after they had exhibited\r\ntheir strength and skill, Alfonso and Caesar in their turn descended to\r\nthe arena, and to offer a proof of their mutual kindness, settled that\r\nthe bull which pursued Caesar should be killed by Alfonso, and the bull\r\nthat pursued Alfonso by Caesar.\r\n\r\nThen Caesar remained alone an horseback within the lists, Alfonso going\r\nout by an improvised door which was kept ajar, in order that he might go\r\nback on the instant if he judged that his presence was necessary. At the\r\nsame time, from the opposite side of the lists the bull was introduced,\r\nand was at the same moment pierced all over with darts and arrows, some\r\nof them containing explosives, which took fire, and irritated the bull\r\nto such a point that he rolled about with pain, and then got up in a\r\nfury, and perceiving a man on horseback, rushed instantly upon him. It\r\nwas now, in this narrow arena, pursued by his swift enemy, that Caesar\r\ndisplayed all that skill which made him one of the finest horsemen of\r\nthe period. Still, clever as he was, he could not have remained safe\r\nlong in that restricted area from an adversary against whom he had no\r\nother resource than flight, had not Alfonso appeared suddenly, just when\r\nthe bull was beginning to gain upon him, waving a red cloak in his left\r\nhand, and holding in his right a long delicate Aragon sword. It was high\r\ntime: the bull was only a few paces distant from Caesar, and the risk he\r\nwas running appeared so imminent that a woman’s scream was heard from\r\none of the windows. But at the sight of a man on foot the bull stopped\r\nshort, and judging that he would do better business with the new enemy\r\nthan the old one, he turned upon him instead. For a moment he stood\r\nmotionless, roaring, kicking up the dust with his hind feet, and lashing\r\nhis sides with his tail. Then he rushed upon Alfonso, his eyes all\r\nbloodshot, his horns tearing up the ground. Alfonso awaited him with a\r\ntranquil air; then, when he was only three paces away, he made a bound\r\nto one sides and presented instead of his body his sword, which\r\ndisappeared at once to the hilt; the bull, checked in the middle of his\r\nonslaught, stopped one instant motionless and trembling, then fell upon\r\nhis knees, uttered one dull roar, and lying down on the very spot where\r\nhis course had been checked, breathed his last without moving a single\r\nstep forward.\r\n\r\nApplause resounded an all sides, so rapid and clever had been the blow.\r\nCaesar had remained on horseback, seeking to discover the fair spectator\r\nwho had given so lively a proof of her interest in him, without\r\ntroubling himself about what was going on: his search had not been\r\nunrewarded, for he had recognized one of the maids of honour to\r\nElizabeth, Duchess of Urbino, who was betrothed to Gian Battista\r\nCarraciualo, captain-general of the republic of Venice.\r\n\r\nIt was now Alfonso’s turn to run from the bull, Caesar’s to fight him:\r\nthe young men changed parts, and when four mules had reluctantly dragged\r\nthe dead bull from the arena, and the valets and other servants of His\r\nHoliness had scattered sand over the places that were stained with\r\nblood, Alfonso mounted a magnificent Andalusian steed of Arab origin,\r\nlight as the wind of Sahara that had wedded with his mother, while\r\nCaesar, dismounting, retired in his turn, to reappear at the moment when\r\nAlfonso should be meeting the same danger from which he had just now\r\nrescued him.\r\n\r\nThen a second bull was introduced upon the scene, excited in the same\r\nmanner with steeled darts and flaming arrows. Like his predecessor, when\r\nhe perceived a man on horseback he rushed upon him, and then began a\r\nmarvellous race, in which it was impossible to see, so quickly did they\r\nfly over the ground, whether the horse was pursuing the bull or the bull\r\nthe horse. But after five or six rounds, the bull began to gain upon the\r\nson of Araby, for all his speed, and it was plain to see who fled and\r\nwho pursued; in another moment there was only the length of two lances\r\nbetween them, and then suddenly Caesar appeared, armed with one of those\r\nlong two handed swords which the French are accustomed to use, and just\r\nwhen the bull, almost close upon Don Alfonso, came in front of Caesar he\r\nbrandished the sword, which flashed like lightning, and cut off his\r\nhead, while his body, impelled by the speed of the run, fell to the\r\nground ten paces farther on. This blow was so unexpected, and had been\r\nperformed with such dexterity, that it was received not with mere\r\nclapping but with wild enthusiasm and frantic outcry. Caesar, apparently\r\nremembering nothing else in his hour of triumph but the scream that had\r\nbeen caused by his former danger, picked up the bull’s head, and, giving\r\nit to one of his equerries, ordered him to lay it as an act of homage at\r\nthe feet of the fair Venetian who had bestowed upon him so lively a sign\r\nof interest. This fete, besides affording a triumph to each of the young\r\nmen, had another end as well; it was meant to prove to the populace that\r\nperfect goodwill existed between the two, since each had saved the life\r\nof the other. The result was that, if any accident should happen to\r\nCaesar, nobody would dream of accusing Alfanso; and also if any accident\r\nshould happen to Alfonso, nobody would dream, of accusing Caesar.\r\n\r\nThere was a supper at the Vatican. Alfonso made an elegant toilet, and\r\nabout ten o’clock at night prepared to go from the quarters he inhabited\r\ninto those where the pope lived; but the door which separated the two\r\ncourts of the building was shut, and knock as he would, no one came to\r\nopen it. Alfonso then thought that it was a simple matter for him to go\r\nround by the Piazza of St. Peter’s; so he went out unaccompanied through\r\none of the garden gates of the Vatican and made his way across the\r\ngloomy streets which led to the stairway which gave on the piazza. But\r\nscarcely had he set his foot on the first step when he was attacked by a\r\nband of armed men. Alfonso would have drawn his sword; but before it was\r\nout of the scabbard he had received two blows from a halberd, one on his\r\nhead, the other on his shoulder; he was stabbed in the side, and wounded\r\nboth in the leg and in the temple. Struck down by these five blows, he\r\nlost his footing and fell to the ground unconscious; his assassins,\r\nsupposing he was dead, at once remounted the stairway, and found on the\r\npiazza forty horsemen waiting for them: by them they were calmly\r\nescorted from the city by the Porta Portesa. Alfonso was found at the\r\npoint of death, but not actually dead, by some passers-by, some of whom\r\nrecognised him, and instantly conveyed the news of his assassination to\r\nthe Vatican, while the others, lifting the wounded man in their arms,\r\ncarried him to his quarters in the Torre Nuova. The pope and Caesar, who\r\nlearned this news just as they were sitting down to table, showed great\r\ndistress, and leaving their companions, at once went to see Alfonso, to\r\nbe quite certain whether his wounds were fatal or not; and an the next\r\nmorning, to divert any suspicion that might be turned towards\r\nthemselves, they arrested Alfonso’s maternal uncle, Francesco Gazella,\r\nwho had come to Rome in his nephew’s company. Gazella was found guilty\r\non the evidence of false witnesses, and was consequently beheaded.\r\n\r\nBut they had only accomplished half of what they wanted. By some means,\r\nfair or foul, suspicion had been sufficiently diverted from the true\r\nassassins; but Alfonso was not dead, and, thanks to the strength of his\r\nconstitution and the skill of his doctors, who had taken the\r\nlamentations of the pope and Caesar quite seriously, and thought to\r\nplease them by curing Alexander’s son-in-law, the wounded man was making\r\nprogress towards convalescence: news arrived at the same time that\r\nLucrezia had heard of her husband’s accident, and was starting to come\r\nand nurse him herself. There was no time to lose, and Caesar summoned\r\nMichelotto.\r\n\r\n\"The same night,\" says Burcardus, \"Don Alfonso, who would not die of his\r\nwounds, was found strangled in his bed.\"\r\n\r\nThe funeral took place the next day with a ceremony not unbecoming in\r\nitself, though, unsuited to his high rank. Don Francesco Borgia,\r\nArchbishop of Cosenza, acted as chief mourner at St. Peter’s, where the\r\nbody was buried in the chapel of Santa Maria delle Febbre.\r\n\r\nLucrezia arrived the same evening: she knew her father and brother too\r\nwell to be put on the wrong scent; and although, immediately after\r\nAlfonso’s death, the Duke of Valentinois had arrested the doctors, the\r\nsurgeons, and a poor deformed wretch who had been acting as valet, she\r\nknew perfectly well from what quarter the blow had proceeded. In fear,\r\ntherefore, that the manifestation of a grief she felt this time too well\r\nmight alienate the confidence of her father and brother, she retired to\r\nNepi with her whole household, her whole court, and more than six\r\nhundred cavaliers, there to spend the period of her mourning.\r\n\r\nThis important family business was now settled, and Lucrezia was again a\r\nwidow, and in consequence ready to be utilized in the pope’s new\r\npolitical machinations. Caesar only stayed at Rome to receive the\r\nambassadors from France and Venice; but as their arrival was somewhat\r\ndelayed, and considerable inroads had been made upon the pope’s\r\ntreasury by the recent festivities, the creation of twelve new cardinals\r\nwas arranged: this scheme was to have two effects, viz., to bring\r\n600,000 ducats into the pontifical chest, each hat having been priced at\r\n50,000 ducats, and to assure the pope of a constant majority in the\r\nsacred council.\r\n\r\nThe ambassadors at last arrived: the first was M. de Villeneuve, the\r\nsame who had come before to see the Duke of Valentinois in the name of\r\nFrance. Just as he entered Rome, he met on the road a masked man, who,\r\nwithout removing his domino, expressed the joy he felt at his arrival.\r\nThis man was Caesar himself, who did not wish to be recognised, and who\r\ntook his departure after a short conference without uncovering his face.\r\nM. de Villeneuve then entered the city after him, and at the Porta del\r\nPopulo found the ambassadors of the various Powers, and among them those\r\nof Spain and Naples, whose sovereigns were not yet, it is true, in\r\ndeclared hostility to France, though there was already some coolness.\r\nThe last-named, fearing to compromise themselves, merely said to their\r\ncolleague of France, by way of complimentary address, \"Sir, you are\r\nwelcome\"; whereupon the master of the ceremonies, surprised at the\r\nbrevity of the greeting, asked if they had nothing else to say. When\r\nthey replied that they had not, M. de Villeneuve turned his back upon\r\nthem, remarking that those who had nothing to say required no answer; he\r\nthen took his place between the Archbishop of Reggia, governor of Rome,\r\nand the Archbishop of Ragusa, and made his way to the palace of the Holy\r\nApostles, which had been, got ready far his reception.\r\n\r\nSame days later, Maria Giorgi, ambassador extraordinary of Venice, made\r\nhis arrival. He was commissioned not only to arrange the business on\r\nhand with the pope, but also to convey to Alexander and Caesar the title\r\nof Venetian nobles, and to inform them that their names were inscribed\r\nin the Golden Book—a favour that both of them had long coveted, less for\r\nthe empty honour’s sake than for the new influence that this title might\r\nconfer. Then the pope went on to bestow the twelve cardinals’ hats that\r\nhad been sold. The new princes of the Church were Don Diego de Mendoza,\r\narchbishop of Seville; Jacques, archbishop of Oristagny, the Pope’s\r\nvicar-general; Thomas, archbishop of Strigania; Piero, archbishop of\r\nReggio, governor of Rome; Francesco Borgia, archbishop of Cosenza,\r\ntreasurer-general; Gian, archbishop of Salerno, vice-chamberlain; Luigi\r\nBorgia, archbishop of Valencia, secretary to His Holiness, and brother\r\nof the Gian Borgia whom Caesar had poisoned; Antonio, bishop of Coma;\r\nGian Battista Ferraro, bishop of Modem; Amedee d’Albret, son of the King\r\nof Navarre, brother-in-law of the Duke of Valentinois; and Marco\r\nCornaro, a Venetian noble, in whose person His Holiness rendered back to\r\nthe most serene republic the favour he had just received.\r\n\r\nThen, as there was nothing further to detain the Duke of Valentinois at\r\nRome, he only waited to effect a loan from a rich banker named Agostino\r\nChigi, brother of the Lorenzo Chigi who had perished on the day when the\r\npope had been nearly killed by the fall of a chimney, and departed for\r\nthe Romagna, accompanied by Vitellozzo Vitelli, Gian Paolo Baglione, and\r\nJacopo di Santa Croce, at that time his friends, but later on his\r\nvictims.\r\n\r\nHis first enterprise was against Pesaro: this was the polite attention\r\nof a brother-in-law, and Gian Sforza very well knew what would be its\r\nconsequences; for instead of attempting to defend his possessions by\r\ntaking up arms, or to venture on negotiations, unwilling moreover to\r\nexpose the fair lands he had ruled so long to the vengeance of an\r\nirritated foe, he begged his subjects, to preserve their former\r\naffection towards himself, in the hope of better days to come; and he\r\nfled into Dalmatia. Malatesta, lord of Rimini, followed his example;\r\nthus the Duke of Valentinois entered both these towns without striking a\r\nsingle blow. Caesar left a sufficient garrison behind him, and marched\r\non to Faenza.\r\n\r\nBut there the face of things was changed: Faenza at that time was under\r\nthe rule of Astor Manfredi, a brave and handsome young man of eighteen,\r\nwho, relying on the love of his subjects towards his family, had\r\nresolved on defending himself to the uttermost, although he had been\r\nforsaken by the Bentivagli, his near relatives, and by his allies, the\r\nVenetian and Florentines, who had not dared to send him any aid because\r\nof the affection felt towards Caesar by the King of France. Accordingly,\r\nwhen he perceived that the Duke of Valentinois was marching against him,\r\nhe assembled in hot haste all those of his vassals who were capable of\r\nbearing arms, together with the few foreign soldiers who were willing to\r\ncome into his pay, and collecting victual and ammunition, he took up his\r\nposition with them inside the town.\r\n\r\nBy these defensive preparations Caesar was not greatly, disconcerted; he\r\ncommanded a magnificent army, composed of the finest troops of France\r\nand Italy; led by such men as Paolo and Giulio Orsini, Vitellozzo\r\nVitelli and Paolo Baglione, not to speak of himself—that is to say, by\r\nthe first captains of the period. So, after he had reconnoitred, he at\r\nonce began the siege, pitching his camp between the two rivers, Amana\r\nand Marziano, placing his artillery on the side which faces on Forli, at\r\nwhich point the besieged party had erected a powerful bastion.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a few days busy with entrenchments, the breach became\r\npracticable, and the Duke of Valentinois ordered an assault, and gave\r\nthe example to his soldiers by being the first to march against the\r\nenemy. But in spite of his courage and that of his captains beside him,\r\nAstor Manfredi made so good a defence that the besiegers were repulsed\r\nwith great loss of men, while one of their bravest leaders, Honario\r\nSavella; was left behind in the trenches.\r\n\r\nBut Faenza, in spite of the courage and devotion of her defenders, could\r\nnot have held out long against so formidable an army, had not winter\r\ncome to her aid. Surprised by the rigour of the season, with no houses\r\nfor protection and no trees for fuel, as the peasants had destroyed both\r\nbeforehand, the Duke of Valentinois was forced to raise the siege and\r\ntake up his winter quarters in the neighbouring towns, in order to be\r\nquite ready for a return next spring; for Caesar could not forgive the\r\ninsult of being held in check by a little town which had enjoyed a long\r\ntime of peace, was governed by a mere boy, and deprived of all outside\r\naid, and had sworn to take his revenge. He therefore broke up his army\r\ninto three sections, sent one-third to Imola, the second to Forli, and\r\nhimself took the third to Cesena, a third-rate town, which was thus\r\nsuddenly transformed into a city of pleasure and luxury.\r\n\r\nIndeed, for Caesar’s active spirit there must needs be no cessation of\r\nwarfare or festivities. So, when war was interrupted, fetes began, as\r\nmagnificent and as exciting as he knew how to make them: the days were\r\npassed in games and displays of horsemanship, the nights in dancing and\r\ngallantry; for the loveliest women of the Romagna—and that is to say of\r\nthe whole world had come hither to make a seraglio for the victor which\r\nmight have been envied by the Sultan of Egypt or the Emperor of\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\nWhile the Duke of Valentinois was making one of his excursions in the\r\nneighbourhood of the town with his retinue of flattering nobles and\r\ntitled courtesans, who were always about him, he noticed a cortege on\r\nthe Rimini road so numerous that it must surely indicate the approach of\r\nsomeone of importance. Caesar, soon perceiving that the principal person\r\nwas a woman, approached, and recognised the very same lady-in-waiting to\r\nthe Duchess of Urbino who, on the day of the bull-fight, had screamed\r\nwhen Caesar was all but touched by the infuriated beast. At this time\r\nshe was betrothed, as we mentioned, to Gian Carracciuola, general of the\r\nVenetians. Elizabeth of Gonzaga, her protectress and godmother, was now\r\nsending her with a suitable retinue to Venice, where the marriage was to\r\ntake place.\r\n\r\nCaesar had already been struck by the beauty of this young girl, when at\r\nRome; but when he saw her again she appeared more lovely than on the\r\nfirst occasion, so he resolved on the instant that he would keep this\r\nfair flower of love for himself: having often before reproached himself\r\nfor his indifference in passing her by. Therefore he saluted her as an\r\nold acquaintance, inquired whether she were staying any time at Cesena,\r\nand ascertained that she was only passing through, travelling by long\r\nstages, as she was awaited with much impatience, and that she would\r\nspend the coming night at Forli. This was all that Caesar cared to knew;\r\nhe summoned Michelotto, and in a low voice said a few words to him,\r\nwhich were heard by no one else.\r\n\r\nThe cortege only made a halt at the neighbouring town, as the fair bride\r\nhad said, and started at once for Forli, although the day was already\r\nfar advanced; but scarcely had a league been revered when a troop of\r\nhorsemen from Cesena overtook and surrounded them. Although the soldiers\r\nin the escort were far from being in sufficient force, they were eager\r\nto defend their general’s bride; but soon some fell dead, and others,\r\nterrified, took to flight; and when the lady came down from her litter\r\nto try to escape, the chief seized her in his arms and set her in front\r\nof him on his horse; then, ordering his men to return to Cesena without\r\nhim, he put his horse to the gallop in a cross direction, and as the\r\nshades of evening were now beginning to fall, he soon disappeared into\r\nthe darkness.\r\n\r\nCarracciuolo learned the news through one of the fugitives, who declared\r\nthat he had recognised among the ravishers the Duke of Valentinois’\r\nsoldiers. At first he thought his ears had deceived him, so hard was it\r\nto believe this terrible intelligence; but it was repeated, and he stood\r\nfor one instant motionless, and, as it were, thunderstruck; then\r\nsuddenly, with a cry of vengeance, he threw off his stupor and dashed\r\naway to the ducal palace, where sat the Doge Barberigo and the Council\r\nof Ten; unannounced, he rushed into their midst, the very moment after\r\nthey had heard of Caesar’s outrage.\r\n\r\n\"Most serene lords,\" he cried, \"I am come to bid you farewell, for I am\r\nresolved to sacrifice my life to my private vengeance, though indeed I\r\nhad hoped to devote it to the service of the republic. I have been\r\nwounded in the soul’s noblest part—in my honour. The dearest thing I\r\npossessed, my wife, has been stolen from me, and the thief is the most\r\ntreacherous, the most impious, the most infamous of men, it is\r\nValentinois! My lords, I beg you will not be offended if I speak thus of\r\na man whose boast it is to be a member of your noble ranks and to enjoy\r\nyour protection: it is not so; he lies, and his loose and criminal life\r\nhas made him unworthy of such honours, even as he is unworthy of the\r\nlife whereof my sword shall deprive him. In truth, his very birth was a\r\nsacrilege; he is a fratricide, an usurper of the goods of other men, an\r\noppressor of the innocent, and a highway assassin; he is a man who will\r\nviolate every law, even, the law of hospitality respected by the veriest\r\nbarbarian, a man who will do violence to a virgin who is passing through\r\nhis own country, where she had every right to expect from him not only\r\nthe consideration due to her sex and condition, but also that which is\r\ndue to the most serene republic, whose condottiere I am, and which is\r\ninsulted in my person and in the dishonouring of my bride; this man, I\r\nsay, merits indeed to die by another hand than mine. Yet, since he who\r\nought to punish him is not for him a prince and judge, but only a father\r\nquite as guilty as the son, I myself will seek him out, and I will\r\nsacrifice my own life, not only in avenging my own injury and the blood\r\nof so many innocent beings, but also in promoting the welfare of the\r\nmost serene republic, on which it is his ambition to trample when he has\r\naccomplished the ruin of the other princes of Italy.\"\r\n\r\nThe doge and the senators, who, as we said, were already apprised of the\r\nevent that had brought Carracciuolo before them, listened with great\r\ninterest and profound indignation; for they, as he told them, were\r\nthemselves insulted in the person of their general: they all swore, on\r\ntheir honour, that if he would put the matter in their hands, and not\r\nyield to his rage, which could only work his own undoing, either his\r\nbride should be rendered up to him without a smirch upon her bridal\r\nveil, or else a punishment should be dealt out proportioned to the\r\naffront. And without delay, as a proof of the energy wherewith the noble\r\ntribunal would take action in the affair, Luigi Manenti, secretary to\r\nthe Ten, was sent to Imola, where the duke was reported to be, that he\r\nmight explain to him the great displeasure with which the most serene\r\nrepublic viewed the outrage perpetrated upon their candottiere. At the\r\nsame time the Council of Ten and the doge sought out the French\r\nambassador, entreating him to join with them and repair in person with\r\nManenti to the Duke of Valentinois, and summon him, in the name of King\r\nLouis XII, immediately to send back to Venice the lady he had carried\r\noff.\r\n\r\nThe two messengers arrived at Imola, where they found Caesar, who\r\nlistened to their complaint with every mark of utter astonishment,\r\ndenying that he had been in any way connected with the crime, nay,\r\nauthorising Manenti and the French ambassador to pursue the culprits and\r\npromising that he would himself have the most active search carried on.\r\nThe duke appeared to act in such complete good faith that the envoys\r\nwere for the moment hoodwinked, and themselves undertook a search of the\r\nmost careful nature. They accordingly repaired to the exact spot and\r\nbegan to procure information. On the highroad there had been found dead\r\nand wounded. A man had been seen going by at a gallop, carrying a woman\r\nin distress on his saddle; he had soon left the beaten track and plunged\r\nacross country. A peasant coming home from working in the fields had\r\nseen him appear and vanish again like a shadow, taking the direction of\r\na lonely house. An old woman declared that she had seen him go into this\r\nhouse. But the next night the house was gone, as though by enchantment,\r\nand the ploughshare had passed over where it stood; so that none could\r\nsay, what had become of her whom they sought, for those who had dwelt in\r\nthe house, and even the house itself, were there no longer.\r\n\r\nManenti and the French ambassador returned to Venice, and related what\r\nthe duke had said, what they had done, and how all search had been in\r\nvain. No one doubted that Caesar was the culprit, but no one could prove\r\nit. So the most serene republic, which could not, considering their war\r\nwith the Turks, be embroiled with the pope, forbade Caracciuala to take\r\nany sort of private vengeance, and so the talk grew gradually less, and\r\nat last the occurrence was no more mentioned.\r\n\r\nBut the pleasures of the winter had not diverted Caesar’s mind from his\r\nplans about Faenza. Scarcely did the spring season allow him to go into\r\nthe country than he marched anew upon the town, camped opposite the\r\ncastle, and making a new breach, ordered a general assault, himself\r\ngoing up first of all; but in spite of the courage he personally\r\ndisplayed, and the able seconding of his soldiers, they were repulsed by\r\nAstor, who, at the head of his men, defended the breach, while even the\r\nwomen, at the top of the rampart, rolled down stones and trunks of trees\r\nupon the besiegers. After an hour’s struggle man to man, Caesar was\r\nforced to retire, leaving two thousand men in the trenches about the\r\ntown, and among the two thousand one of his bravest condottieri,\r\nValentino Farnese.\r\n\r\nThen, seeing that neither excommunications nor assaults could help him,\r\nCaesar converted the siege into a blockade: all the roads leading to\r\nFaenza were cut off, all communications stopped; and further, as various\r\nsigns of revolt had been remarked at Cesena, a governor was installed\r\nthere whose powerful will was well known to Caesar, Ramiro d’Orco, with\r\npowers of life and death over the inhabitants; he then waited quietly\r\nbefore Faenza, till hunger should drive out the citizens from those\r\nwalls they defended with such vehement enthusiasm. At the end of a\r\nmonth, during which the people of Faenza had suffered all the horrors of\r\nfamine, delegates came out to parley with Caesar with a view to\r\ncapitulation. Caesar, who still had plenty to do in the Romagna, was\r\nless hard to satisfy than might have been expected, and the town yielded\r\non condition that he should not touch either the persons or the\r\nbelongings of the inhabitants, that Astor Manfredi, the youthful ruler,\r\nshould have the privilege of retiring whenever he pleased, and should\r\nenjoy the revenue of his patrimony wherever he might be.\r\n\r\nThe conditions were faithfully kept so far as the inhabitants were\r\nconcerned; but Caesar, when he had seen Astor, whom he did not know\r\nbefore, was seized by a strange passion for this beautiful youth, who\r\nwas like a woman: he kept him by his side in his own army, showing him\r\nhonours befitting a young prince, and evincing before the eyes of all\r\nthe strongest affection for him: one day Astor disappeared, just as\r\nCaracciuolo’s bride had disappeared, and no one knew what had become of\r\nhim; Caesar himself appeared very uneasy, saying that he had no doubt\r\nmade his escape somewhere, and in order to give credence to this story,\r\nhe sent out couriers to seek him in all directions.\r\n\r\nA year after this double disappearance, there was picked up in the\r\nTiber, a little below the Castle Sant’ Angelo, the body of a beautiful\r\nyoung woman, her hands bound together behind her back, and also the\r\ncorpse of a handsome youth with the bowstring he had been strangled with\r\ntied round his neck. The girl was Caracciuolo’s bride, the young man was\r\nAstor.\r\n\r\nDuring the last year both had been the slaves of Caesar’s pleasures;\r\nnow, tired of them, he had had them thrown into the Tiber.\r\n\r\nThe capture of Faenza had brought Caesar the title of Duke of Romagna,\r\nwhich was first bestowed on him by the pope in full consistory, and\r\nafterwards ratified by the King of Hungary, the republic of Venice, and\r\nthe Kings of Castile and Portugal. The news of the ratification arrived\r\nat Rome on the eve of the day on which the people are accustomed to keep\r\nthe anniversary of the foundation of the Eternal City; this fete, which\r\nwent back to the days of Pomponius Laetus, acquired a new splendour in\r\ntheir eyes from the joyful events that had just happened to their\r\nsovereign: as a sign of joy cannon were fired all day long; in the\r\nevening there were illuminations and bonfires, and during part of the\r\nnight the Prince of Squillace, with the chief lords of the Roman\r\nnobility, marched about the streets, bearing torches, and exclaiming,\r\n\"Long live Alexander! Long live Caesar! Long live the Borgias! Long live\r\nthe Orsini! Long live the Duke of Romagna!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nCaesar’s ambition was only fed by victories: scarcely was he master of\r\nFaenza before, excited by the Mariscotti, old enemies of the Bentivoglio\r\nfamily, he cast his eyes upon Bologna; but Gian di Bentivoglio, whose\r\nancestors had possessed this town from time immemorial, had not only\r\nmade all preparations necessary for a long resistance, but he had also\r\nput himself under the protection of France; so, scarcely had he learned\r\nthat Caesar was crossing the frontier of the Bolognese territory with\r\nhis army, than he sent a courier to Louis XII to claim the fulfilment of\r\nhis promise. Louis kept it with his accustomed good faith; and when\r\nCaesar arrived before Bologna, he received an intimation from the King\r\nof France that he was not to enter on any undertaking against his ally\r\nBentivoglio; Caesar, not being the man to have his plans upset for\r\nnothing, made conditions for his retreat, to which Bentivoglio\r\nconsented, only too happy to be quit of him at this price: the\r\nconditions were the cession of Castello Bolognese, a fortress between\r\nImola and Faenza, the payment of a tribute of 9000 ducats, and the\r\nkeeping for his service of a hundred men-at-arms and two thousand\r\ninfantry. In exchange for these favours, Caesar confided to Bentivoglio\r\nthat his visit had been due to the counsels of the Mariscotti; then,\r\nreinforced by his new ally’s contingent, he took the road for Tuscany.\r\nBut he was scarcely out of sight when Bentivoglio shut the gates of\r\nBologna, and commanded his son Hermes to assassinate with his own hand\r\nAgamemnon Mariscotti, the head of the family, and ordered the massacre\r\nof four-and-thirty of his near relatives, brothers, sons, daughters, and\r\nnephews, and two hundred other of his kindred and friends. The butchery\r\nwas carried out by the noblest youths of Bologna; whom Bentivoglio\r\nforced to bathe their hands in this blood, so that he might attach them\r\nto himself through their fear of reprisals.\r\n\r\nCaesar’s plans with regard to Florence were now no longer a mystery:\r\nsince the month of January he had sent to Pisa ten or twelve hundred men\r\nunder the Command of Regniero della Sassetta and Piero di Gamba Corti,\r\nand as soon as the conquest of the Romagna was complete, he had further\r\ndespatched Oliverotto di Fermo with new detachments. His own army he had\r\nreinforced, as we have seen, by a hundred men-at-arms and two thousand\r\ninfantry; he had just been joined by Vitellozzo Vitelli, lord of Citta,\r\ndi Castello, and by the Orsini, who had brought him another two or three\r\nthousand men; so, without counting the troops sent to Pisa, he had under\r\nhis control seven hundred men-at-arms and five thousand infantry.\r\n\r\nStill, in spite of this formidable company, he entered Tuscany declaring\r\nthat his intentions were only pacific, protesting that he only desired\r\nto pass through the territories of the republic on his way to Rome, and\r\noffering to pay in ready money for any victual his army might require.\r\nBut when he had passed the defiles of the mountains and arrived at\r\nBarberino, feeling that the town was in his power and nothing could now\r\nhinder his approach, he began to put a price on the friendship he had at\r\nfirst offered freely, and to impose his own conditions instead of\r\naccepting those of others. These were that Piero dei Medici, kinsman and\r\nally of the Orsini, should be reinstated in his ancient power; that six\r\nFlorentine citizens, to be chosen by Vitellozzo, should be put into his\r\nhands that they might by their death expiate that of Paolo Vitelli,\r\nunjustly executed by the Florentines; that the Signoria should engage to\r\ngive no aid to the lord of Piombino, whom Caesar intended to dispossess\r\nof his estates without delay; and further, that he himself should be\r\ntaken into the service of the republic, for a pay proportionate to his\r\ndeserts. But just as Caesar had reached this point in his negotiations\r\nwith Florence, he received orders from Louis XII to get ready, so soon\r\nas he conveniently could, to follow him with his army and help in the\r\nconquest of Naples, which he was at last in a position to undertake.\r\nCaesar dared not break his word to so powerful an ally; he therefore\r\nreplied that he was at the king’s orders, and as the Florentines were\r\nnot aware that he was quitting them on compulsion, he sold his retreat\r\nfor the sum of 36,000 ducats per annum, in exchange for which sum he was\r\nto hold three hundred men-at-arms always in readiness to go to the aid\r\nof the republic at her earliest call and in any circumstances of need.\r\n\r\nBut, hurried as he was, Caesar still hoped that he might find time to\r\nconquer the territory of Piombino as he went by, and take the capital by\r\na single vigorous stroke; so he made his entry into the lands of Jacopo\r\nIV of Appiano. The latter, he found, however, had been beforehand with\r\nhim, and, to rob him of all resource, had laid waste his own country,\r\nburned his fodder, felled his trees, torn down his vines, and destroyed\r\na few fountains that produced salubrious waters. This did not hinder\r\nCaesar from seizing in the space of a few days Severeto, Scarlino, the\r\nisle of Elba, and La Pianosa; but he was obliged to stop short at the\r\ncastle, which opposed a serious resistance. As Louis XII’s army was\r\ncontinuing its way towards Rome, and he received a fresh order to join\r\nit, he took his departure the next day, leaving behind him, Vitellozzo\r\nand Gian Paolo Bagliani to prosecute the siege in his absence.\r\n\r\nLouis XII was this time advancing upon Naples, not with the incautious\r\nardour of Charles VIII, but, on the contrary, with that prudence and\r\ncircumspection which characterised him. Besides his alliance with\r\nFlorence and Rome, he had also signed a secret treaty with Ferdinand the\r\nCatholic, who had similar pretensions, through the house of Duras, to\r\nthe throne of Naples to those Louis himself had through the house of\r\nAnjou. By this treaty the two kings were sharing their conquests\r\nbeforehand: Louis would be master of Naples, of the town of Lavore and\r\nthe Abruzzi, and would bear the title of King of Naples and Jerusalem;\r\nFerdinand reserved for his own share Apulia and Calabria, with the title\r\nof Duke of these provinces; both were to receive the investiture from\r\nthe pope and to hold them of him. This partition was all the more likely\r\nto be made, in fact, because Frederic, supposing all the time that\r\nFerdinand was his good and faithful friend, would open the gates of his\r\ntowns, only to receive into his fortresses conquerors and masters\r\ninstead of allies. All this perhaps was not very loyal conduct on the\r\npart of a king who had so long desired and had just now received the\r\nsurname of Catholic, but it mattered little to Louis, who profited by\r\ntreasonable acts he did not have to share.\r\n\r\nThe French army, which the Duke of Valentinois had just joined,\r\nconsisted of 1000 lances, 4000 Swiss, and 6000 Gascons and adventurers;\r\nfurther, Philip of Rabenstein was bringing by sea six Breton and\r\nProvencal vessels, and three Genoese caracks, carrying 6500 invaders.\r\n\r\nAgainst this mighty host the King of Naples had only 700 men-at-arms,\r\n600 light horse, and 6000 infantry under the command of the Colonna,\r\nwhom he had taken into his pay after they were exiled by the pope from\r\nthe States of the Church; but he was counting on Gonsalvo of Cordova,\r\nwho was to join him at Gaeta, and to whom he had confidingly opened all\r\nhis fortresses in Calabria.\r\n\r\nBut the feeling of safety inspired by Frederic’s faithless ally was not\r\ndestined to endure long: on their arrival at Rome, the French and\r\nSpanish ambassadors presented to the pope the treaty signed at Grenada\r\non the 11th of November, 1500, between Louis XII and Ferdinand the\r\nCatholic, a treaty which up, to that time had been secret. Alexander,\r\nforeseeing the probable future, had, by the death of Alfonso, loosened\r\nall the bonds that attached him to the house of Aragon, and then began\r\nby making some difficulty about it. It was demonstrated that the\r\narrangement had only been undertaken to provide the Christian princes\r\nwith another weapon for attacking the Ottoman Empire, and before this\r\nconsideration, one may readily suppose, all the pope’s scruples\r\nvanished; on the 25th of June, therefore, it was decided to call a\r\nconsistory which was to declare Frederic deposed from the throne of\r\nNaples. When Frederic heard all at once that the French army had arrived\r\nat Rome, that his ally Ferdinand had deceived him, and that Alexander\r\nhad pronounced the sentence of his downfall, he understood that all was\r\nlost; but he did not wish it to be said that he had abandoned his\r\nkingdom without even attempting to save it. So he charged his two new\r\ncondottieri, Fabrizio Calonna and Ranuzia di Marciano, to check the\r\nFrench before Capua with 300 men-at-arms, some light horse, and 3000\r\ninfantry; in person he occupied Aversa with another division of his\r\narmy, while Prospero Colonna was sent to defend Naples with the rest,\r\nand make a stand against the Spaniards on the side of Calabria.\r\n\r\nThese dispositions were scarcely made when d’Aubigny, having passed the\r\nVolturno, approached to lay siege to Capua, and invested the town on\r\nboth sides of the river. Scarcely were the French encamped before the\r\nramparts than they began to set up their batteries, which were soon in\r\nplay, much to the terror of the besieged, who, poor creatures, were\r\nalmost all strangers to the town, and had fled thither from every side,\r\nexpecting to find protection beneath the walls. So, although bravely\r\nrepulsed by Fabrizio Colonna, the French, from the moment of their first\r\nassault, inspired so great and blind a terror that everyone began to\r\ntalk of opening the gates, and it was only with great difficulty that\r\nCalonna made this multitude understand that at least they ought to reap\r\nsome benefit from the check the besiegers had received and obtain good\r\nterms of capitulation. When he had brought them round to his view, he\r\nsent out to demand a parley with d’Aubigny, and a conference was fixed\r\nfor the next day but one, in which they were to treat of the surrender\r\nof the town.\r\n\r\nBut this was not Caesar Borgia’s idea at all: he had stayed behind to\r\nconfer with the pope, and had joined the French army with some of his\r\ntroops on the very day on which the conference had been arranged for two\r\ndays later: and a capitulation of any nature would rob him of his share\r\nof the booty and the promise of such pleasure as would come from the\r\ncapture of a city so rich and populous as Capua. So he opened up\r\nnegotiations on his own account with a captain who was on guard at one\r\nof the gates such negotiations, made with cunning supported by bribery,\r\nproved as usual more prompt and efficacious than any others. At the very\r\nmoment when Fabrizio Colonna in a fortified outpost was discussing the\r\nconditions of capitulation with the French captains, suddenly great\r\ncries of distress were heard. These were caused by Borgia, who without a\r\nword to anyone had entered the town with his faithful army from Romagna,\r\nand was beginning to cut the throats of the garrison, which had\r\nnaturally somewhat relaxed their vigilance in the belief that the\r\ncapitulation was all but signed. The French, when they saw that the town\r\nwas half taken, rushed on the gates with such impetuosity that the\r\nbesieged did not even attempt to defend themselves any longer, and\r\nforced their way into Capua by three separate sides: nothing more could\r\nbe done then to stop the issue. Butchery and pillage had begun, and the\r\nwork of destruction must needs be completed: in vain did Fabrizio\r\nColonna, Ranuzio di Marciano, and Don Ugo di Cardona attempt to make\r\nhead against the French and Spaniards with such men as they could get\r\ntogether. Fabrizia Calonna and Don Ugo were made prisoners; Ranuzia,\r\nwounded by an arrow, fell into the hands of the Duke of Valentinois;\r\nseven thousand inhabitants were massacred in the streets among them the\r\ntraitor who had given up the gate; the churches were pillaged, the\r\nconvents of nuns forced open; and then might be seen the spectacle of\r\nsome of these holy virgins casting themselves into pits or into the\r\nriver to escape the soldiers. Three hundred of the noblest ladies of the\r\ntown took refuge in a tower. The Duke of Valentinois broke in the doors,\r\nchased out for himself forty of the most beautiful, and handed over the\r\nrest to his army.\r\n\r\nThe pillage continued for three days.\r\n\r\nCapua once taken, Frederic saw that it was useless any longer to attempt\r\ndefence. So he shut himself up in Castel Nuovo and gave permission to\r\nGaeta and to Naples to treat with the conqueror. Gaeta bought immunity\r\nfrom pillage with 60,000 ducats; and Naples with the surrender of the\r\ncastle. This surrender was made to d’Aubigny by Frederic himself, an\r\ncondition that he should be allowed to take to the island of Ischia his\r\nmoney, jewels, and furniture, and there remain with his family for six\r\nmonths secure from all hostile attack. The terms of this capitulation\r\nwere faithfully adhered to on both sides: d’Aubigny entered Naples, and\r\nFrederic retired to Ischia.\r\n\r\nThus, by a last terrible blow, never to rise again, fell this branch of\r\nthe house of Aragon, which had now reigned for sixty-five years.\r\nFrederic, its head, demanded and obtained a safe-conduct to pass into\r\nFrance, where Louis XII gave him the duchy of Anjou and 30,000 ducats a\r\nyear, on condition that he should never quit the kingdom; and there, in\r\nfact, he died, an the 9th of September 1504. His eldest son, Dan\r\nFerdinand, Duke of Calabria, retired to Spain, where he was permitted to\r\nmarry twice, but each time with a woman who was known to be barren; and\r\nthere he died in 1550. Alfonso, the second son, who had followed his\r\nfather to France, died, it is said, of poison, at Grenoble, at the age\r\nof twenty-two; lastly Caesar, the third son, died at Ferrara, before he\r\nhad attained his eighteenth birthday.\r\n\r\nFrederic’s daughter Charlotte married in France Nicholas, Count of\r\nLaval, governor and admiral of Brittany; a daughter was born of this\r\nmarriage, Anne de Laval, who married Francois de la Trimauille. Through\r\nher those rights were transmitted to the house of La Trimouille which\r\nwere used later on as a claim upon the kingdom of the Two Sicilies.\r\n\r\nThe capture of Naples gave the Duke of Valentinois his liberty again; so\r\nhe left the French army, after he had received fresh assurances on his\r\nown account of the king’s friendliness, and returned to the siege of\r\nPiombino, which he had been forced to interrupt. During this interval\r\nAlexander had been visiting the scenes of his son’s conquests, and\r\ntraversing all the Romagna with Lucrezia, who was now consoled for her\r\nhusband’s death, and had never before enjoyed quite so much favour with\r\nHis Holiness; so, when she returned to Rome. She no longer had separate\r\nrooms from him. The result of this recrudescence of affection was the\r\nappearance of two pontifical bulls, converting the towns of Nepi and\r\nSermoneta into duchies: one was bestowed on Gian Borgia, an illegitimate\r\nchild of the pope, who was not the son of either of his mistresses, Rosa\r\nVanozza or Giulia Farnese, the other on Don Roderigo of Aragon, son of\r\nLucrezia and Alfonso: the lands of the Colonna were in appanage to the\r\ntwo duchies.\r\n\r\nBut Alexander was dreaming of yet another addition to his fortune; this\r\nwas to came from a marriage between Lucrezia and Don Alfonso d’Este, son\r\nof Duke Hercules of Ferrara, in favour of which alliance Louis XII had\r\nnegotiated.\r\n\r\nHis Holiness was now having a run of good fortune, and he learned on the\r\nsame day that Piombino was taken and that Duke Hercules had given the\r\nKing of France his assent to the marriage. Both of these pieces of news\r\nwere good for Alexander, but the one could not compare in importance\r\nwith the other; and the intimation that Lucrezia was to marry the heir\r\npresumptive to the duchy of Ferrara was received with a joy so great\r\nthat it smacked of the humble beginnings of the Borgian house. The Duke\r\nof Valentinois was invited to return to Rome, to take his share in the\r\nfamily rejoicing, and on the day when the news was made public the\r\ngovernor of St. Angelo received orders that cannon should be fired every\r\nquarter of an hour from noon to midnight. At two o’clock, Lucrezia,\r\nattired as a fiancee, and accompanied by her two brothers, the Dukes of\r\nValentinois and Squillace, issued from the Vatican, followed by all the\r\nnobility of Rome, and proceeded to the church of the Madonna del Papalo,\r\nwhere the Duke of Gandia and Cardinal Gian Borgia were buried, to render\r\nthanks for this new favour accorded to her house by God; and in the\r\nevening, accompanied by the same cavalcade, which shone the more\r\nbrightly under the torchlight and brilliant illuminations, she made\r\nprocession through the whale town, greeted by cries of \"Long live Pope\r\nAlexander VI! Long live the Duchess of Ferrara!\" which were shouted\r\naloud by heralds clad in cloth of gold.\r\n\r\nThe next day an announcement was made in the town that a racecourse for\r\nwomen was opened between the castle of Sant’ Angelo and the Piazza of\r\nSt. Peter’s; that on every third day there would be a bull-fight in the\r\nSpanish fashion; and that from the end of the present month, which was\r\nOctober, until the first day of Lent, masquerades would be permitted in\r\nthe streets of Rome.\r\n\r\nSuch was the nature of the fetes outside; the programme of those going\r\non within the Vatican was not presented to the people; for by the\r\naccount of Bucciardo, an eye-witness, this is what happened—\r\n\r\n\"On the last Sunday of the month of October, fifty courtesans supped in\r\nthe apostolic palace in the Duke of Valentinois’ rooms, and after supper\r\ndanced with the equerries and servants, first wearing their usual\r\ngarments, afterwards in dazzling draperies; when supper was over, the\r\ntable was removed, candlesticks were set on the floor in a symmetrical\r\npattern, and a great quantity of chestnuts was scattered on the ground:\r\nthese the fifty women skilfully picked up, running about gracefully, in\r\nand out between the burning lights; the pope, the Duke of Valentinois,\r\nand his sister Lucrezia, who were looking on at this spectacle from a\r\ngallery, encouraged the most agile and industrious with their applause,\r\nand they received prizes of embroidered garters, velvet boots, golden\r\ncaps, and laces; then new diversions took the place of these.\"\r\n\r\nWe humbly ask forgiveness of our readers, and especially of our lady\r\nreaders; but though we have found words to describe the first part of\r\nthe spectacle, we have sought them in vain for the second; suffice it to\r\nsay that just as there had been prizes for feats of adroitness, others\r\nwere given now to the dancers who were most daring and brazen.\r\n\r\nSome days after this strange night, which calls to mind the Roman\r\nevenings in the days of Tiberius, Nero, and Heliogabalus, Lucrezia, clad\r\nin a robe of golden brocade, her train carried by young girls dressed in\r\nwhite and crowned with roses, issued from her palace to the sound of\r\ntrumpets and clarions, and made her way over carpets that were laid down\r\nin the streets through which she had to pass. Accompanied by the noblest\r\ncavaliers and the loveliest women in Rome, she betook herself to the\r\nVatican, where in the Pauline hall the pope awaited her, with the Duke\r\nof Valentinois, Don Ferdinand, acting as proxy for Duke Alfonso, and his\r\ncousin, Cardinal d’Este. The pope sat on one side of the table, while\r\nthe envoys from Ferrara stood on the other: into their midst came\r\nLucrezia, and Don Ferdinand placed on her finger the nuptial ring; this\r\nceremony over, Cardinal d’Este approached and presented to the bride\r\nfour magnificent rings set with precious stones; then a casket was\r\nplaced on the table, richly inlaid with ivory, whence the cardinal drew\r\nforth a great many trinkets, chains, necklaces of pearls and diamonds,\r\nof workmanship as costly as their material; these he also begged\r\nLucrezia to accept, before she received those the bridegroom was hoping\r\nto offer himself, which would be more worthy of her. Lucrezia showed the\r\nutmost delight in accepting these gifts; then she retired into the next\r\nroom, leaning on the pope’s arm, and followed by the ladies of her\r\nsuite, leaving the Duke of Valentinois to do the honours of the Vatican\r\nto the men. That evening the guests met again, and spent half the night\r\nin dancing, while a magnificent display of fireworks lighted up the\r\nPiazza of San Paolo.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of betrothal over, the pope and the Duke busied themselves\r\nwith making preparations for the departure. The pope, who wished the\r\njourney to be made with a great degree of splendour, sent in his\r\ndaughter’s company, in addition to the two brothers-in-law and the\r\ngentlemen in their suite, the Senate of Rome and all the lords who, by\r\nvirtue of their wealth, could display most magnificence in their\r\ncostumes and liveries. Among this brilliant throng might be seen Olivero\r\nand Ramiro Mattei, sons of Piero Mattei, chancellor of the town, and a\r\ndaughter of the pope whose mother was not Rosa Vanozza; besides these,\r\nthe pope nominated in consistory Francesco Borgia, Cardinal of Sosenza,\r\nlegate a latere, to accompany his daughter to the frontiers of the\r\nEcclesiastical States.\r\n\r\nAlso the Duke of Valentinois sent out messengers into all the cities of\r\nRomagna to order that Lucrezia should be received as sovereign lady and\r\nmistress: grand preparations were at once set on foot for the fulfilment\r\nof his orders. But the messengers reported that they greatly feared that\r\nthere would be some grumbling at Cesena, where it will be remembered\r\nthat Caesar had left Ramiro d’Orco as governor with plenary powers, to\r\ncalm the agitation of the town. Now Ramiro d’Orco had accomplished his\r\ntask so well that there was nothing more to fear in the way of\r\nrebellion; for one-sixth of the inhabitants had perished on the\r\nscaffold, and the result of this situation was that it was improbable\r\nthat the same demonstrations of joy could be expected from a town\r\nplunged in mourning that were looked for from Imola, Faenza, and Pesaro.\r\nThe Duke of Valentinois averted this inconvenience in the prompt and\r\nefficacious fashion characteristic of him alone. One morning the\r\ninhabitants of Cesena awoke to find a scaffold set up in the square, and\r\nupon it the four quarters of a man, his head, severed from the trunk,\r\nstuck up on the end of a pike.\r\n\r\nThis man was Ramiro d’Orco.\r\n\r\nNo one ever knew by whose hands the scaffold had been raised by night,\r\nnor by what executioners the terrible deed had been carried out; but\r\nwhen the Florentine Republic sent to ask Macchiavelli, their ambassador\r\nat Cesena, what he thought of it, he replied:\r\n\r\n\"MAGNIFICENT LORDS,-I can tell you nothing concerning the execution of\r\nRamiro d’Orco, except that Caesar Borgia is the prince who best knows\r\nhow to make and unmake men according to their deserts. NICCOLO\r\nMACCHIAVELLI\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Valentinois was not disappointed, and the future Duchess of\r\nFerrara was admirably received in every town along her route, and\r\nparticularly at Cesena.\r\n\r\nWhile Lucrezia was on her way to Ferrara to meet her fourth husband,\r\nAlexander and the Duke of Valentinois resolved to make a progress in the\r\nregion of their last conquest, the duchy of Piombino. The apparent\r\nobject of this journey was that the new subjects might take their oath\r\nto Caesar, and the real object was to form an arsenal in Jacopo\r\nd’Appiano’s capital within reach of Tuscany, a plan which neither the\r\npope nor his son had ever seriously abandoned. The two accordingly\r\nstarted from the port of Corneto with six ships, accompanied by a great\r\nnumber of cardinals and prelates, and arrived the same evening at\r\nPiombina. The pontifical court made a stay there of several days, partly\r\nwith a view of making the duke known to the inhabitants, and also in\r\norder to be present at certain ecclesiastical functions, of which the\r\nmost important was a service held on the third Sunday in Lent, in which\r\nthe Cardinal of Cosenza sang a mass and the pope officiated in state\r\nwith the duke and the cardinals. After these solemn functions the\r\ncustomary pleasures followed, and the pope summoned the prettiest girls\r\nof the country and ordered them to dance their national dances before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nFollowing on these dances came feasts of unheard of magnificence, during\r\nwhich the pope in the sight of all men completely ignored Lent and did\r\nnot fast. The object of all these fetes was to scatter abroad a great\r\ndeal of money, and so to make the Duke of Valentinois popular, while\r\npoor Jacopo d’Appiano was forgotten.\r\n\r\nWhen they left Piombino, the pope and his son visited the island of\r\nElba, where they only stayed long enough to visit the old fortifications\r\nand issue orders for the building of new ones.\r\n\r\nThen the illustrious travellers embarked on their return journey to\r\nRome; but scarcely had they put out to sea when the weather became\r\nadverse, and the pope not wishing to put in at Porto Ferrajo, they\r\nremained five days on board, though they had only two days’ provisions.\r\nDuring the last three days the pope lived on fried fish that were caught\r\nunder great difficulties because of the heavy weather. At last they\r\narrived in sight of Corneto, and there the duke, who was not on the same\r\nvessel as the pope, seeing that his ship could not get in, had a boat\r\nput out, and so was taken ashore. The pope was obliged to continue on\r\nhis way towards Pontercole, where at last he arrived, after encountering\r\nso violent a tempest that all who were with him were utterly subdued\r\neither by sickness or by the terror of death. The pope alone did not\r\nshow one instant’s fear, but remained on the bridge during the storm,\r\nsitting on his arm-chair, invoking the name of Jesus and making the sign\r\nof the cross. At last his ship entered the roads of Pontercole, where he\r\nlanded, and after sending to Corneto to fetch horses, he rejoined the\r\nduke, who was there awaiting him. They then returned by slow stages, by\r\nway of Civita Vecchia and Palo, and reached Rome after an absence of a\r\nmonth. Almost at the same time d’Albret arrived in quest of his\r\ncardinal’s hat. He was accompanied by two princes of the house of\r\nNavarre, who were received with not only those honours which beseemed\r\ntheir rank, but also as brothers-in-law to whom the, duke was eager to\r\nshow in what spirit he was contracting this alliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe time had now come for the Duke of Valentinois to continue the\r\npursuit of his conquests. So, since on the 1st of May in the preceding\r\nyear the pope had pronounced sentence of forfeiture in full consistory\r\nagainst Julius Caesar of Varano, as punishment for the murder of his\r\nbrother Rudolph and for the harbouring of the pope’s enemies, and he had\r\naccordingly been mulcted of his fief of Camerino, which was to be handed\r\nover to the apostolic chamber, Caesar left Rome to put the sentence in\r\nexecution. Consequently, when he arrived on the frontiers of Perugia,\r\nwhich belonged to his lieutenant, Gian Paolo Baglioni, he sent\r\nOliverotta da Fermo and Orsini of Gravina to lay waste the March of\r\nCamerino, at the same time petitioning Guido d’Ubaldo di Montefeltro,\r\nDuke of Urbino, to lend his soldiers and artillery to help him in this\r\nenterprise. This the unlucky Duke of Urbino, who enjoyed the best\r\npossible relations with the pope, and who had no reason for distrusting\r\nCaesar, did not dare refuse. But on the very same day that the Duke of\r\nUrbina’s troops started for Camerino, Caesar’s troops entered the duchy\r\nof Urbino, and took possession of Cagli, one of the four towns of the\r\nlittle State. The Duke of Urbino knew what awaited him if he tried to\r\nresist, and fled incontinently, disguised as a peasant; thus in less\r\nthan eight days Caesar was master of his whole duchy, except the\r\nfortresses of Maiolo and San Leone.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Valentinois forthwith returned to Camerino, where the\r\ninhabitants still held out, encouraged by the presence of Julius Caesar\r\ndi Varano, their lord, and his two sons, Venantio and Hannibal; the\r\neldest son, Gian Maria, had been sent by his father to Venice.\r\n\r\nThe presence of Caesar was the occasion of parleying between the\r\nbesiegers and besieged. A capitulation was arranged whereby Varano\r\nengaged to give up the town, on condition that he and his sons were\r\nallowed to retire safe and sound, taking with them their furniture,\r\ntreasure, and carriages. But this was by no means Caesar’s intention;\r\nso, profiting by the relaxation in vigilance that had naturally come\r\nabout in the garrison when the news of the capitulation had been\r\nannounced, he surprised the town in the night preceding the surrender,\r\nand seized Caesar di Varano and his two sons, who were strangled a short\r\ntime after, the father at La Pergola and the sons at Pesaro, by Don\r\nMichele Correglio, who, though he had left the position of sbirro for\r\nthat of a captain, every now and then returned to his first business.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Vitellozzo Vitelli, who had assumed the title of General of\r\nthe Church, and had under him 800 men-at-arms and 3,000 infantry, was\r\nfollowing the secret instructions that he had received from Caesar by\r\nword of mouth, and was carrying forward that system of invasion which\r\nwas to encircle Florence in a network of iron, and in the end make her\r\ndefence an impossibility. A worthy pupil of his master, in whose school\r\nhe had learned to use in turn the cunning of a fox and the strength of a\r\nlion, he had established an understanding between himself and certain\r\nyoung gentlemen of Arezzo to get that town delivered into his hands. But\r\nthe plot had been discovered by Guglielma dei Pazzi, commissary of the\r\nFlorentine Republic, and he had arrested two of the conspirators,\r\nwhereupon the others, who were much more numerous than was supposed; had\r\ninstantly dispersed about the town summoning the citizens to arms. All\r\nthe republican faction, who saw in any sort of revolution the means of\r\nsubjugating Florence, joined their party, set the captives at liberty,\r\nand seized Guglielmo; then proclaiming the establishment of the ancient\r\nconstitution, they besieged the citadel, whither Cosimo dei Pazzi,\r\nBishop of Arezzo, the son of Guglielmo, had fled for refuge; he, finding\r\nhimself invested on every side, sent a messenger in hot haste to\r\nFlorence to ask for help.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the cardinal, Vitellozzo’s troops were nearer to the\r\nbesiegers than were the soldiers of the most serene republic to the\r\nbesieged, and instead of help—the whole army of the enemy came down upon\r\nhim. This army was under the command of Vitellozzo, of Gian Paolo\r\nBaglioni, and of Fabio Orsino, and with them were the two Medici, ever\r\nready to go wherever there was a league against Florence, and ever ready\r\nat the command of Borgia, on any conditions whatever, to re-enter the\r\ntown whence they had been banished. The next day more help in the form\r\nof money and artillery arrived, sent by Pandolfo Petrucci, and on the\r\n18th of June the citadel of Arezzo, which had received no news from\r\nFlorence, was obliged to surrender.\r\n\r\nVitellozzo left the men of Arezzo to look after their town themselves,\r\nleaving also Fabio Orsina to garrison the citadel with a thousand men.\r\nThen, profiting by the terror that had been spread throughout all this\r\npart of Italy by the successive captures of the duchy of Urbino, of\r\nCamerino, and of Arezzo, he marched upon Monte San Severino,\r\nCastiglione, Aretino, Cortone, and the other towns of the valley of\r\nChiana, which submitted one after the other almost without a struggle.\r\nWhen he was only ten or twelve leagues from Florence, and dared not on\r\nhis own account attempt anything against her, he made known the state of\r\naffairs to the Duke of Valentinois. He, fancying the hour had came at\r\nlast for striking the blow so long delayed, started off at once to\r\ndeliver his answer in person to his faithful lieutenants.\r\n\r\nBut the Florentines, though they had sent no help to Guglielmo dei\r\nPazzi, had demanded aid from Chaumont dumbest, governor of the Milanese,\r\non behalf of Louis XII, not only explaining the danger they themselves\r\nwere in but also Caesar’s ambitious projects, namely that after first\r\novercoming the small principalities and then the states of the second\r\norder, he had now, it seemed, reached such a height of pride that he\r\nwould attack the King of France himself. The news from Naples was\r\ndisquieting; serious differences had already occurred between the Count\r\nof Armagnac and Gonzalva di Cordova, and Louis might any day need\r\nFlorence, whom he had always found loyal and faithful. He therefore\r\nresolved to check Caesar’s progress, and not only sent him orders to\r\nadvance no further step forwards, but also sent off, to give effect to\r\nhis injunction, the captain Imbaut with 400 lances. The Duke of\r\nValentinois on the frontier of Tuscany received a copy of the treaty\r\nsigned between the republic and the King of France, a treaty in which\r\nthe king engaged to help his ally against any enemy whatsoever, and at\r\nthe same moment the formal prohibition from Louis to advance any\r\nfurther. Caesar also learned that beside the 400 lances with the captain\r\nImbaut, which were on the road to Florence, Louis XII had as soon as he\r\nreached Asti sent off to Parma Louis de la Trimouille and 200\r\nmen-at-arms, 3000 Swiss, and a considerable train of artillery. In these\r\ntwo movements combined he saw hostile intentions towards himself, and\r\nturning right about face with his usual agility, he profited by the fact\r\nthat he had given nothing but verbal instructions to all his\r\nlieutenants, and wrote a furious letter to Vitellozzo, reproaching him\r\nfor compromising his master with a view to his own private interest, and\r\nordering the instant surrender to the Florentines of the towns and\r\nfortresses he had taken, threatening to march down with his own troops\r\nand take them if he hesitated for a moment.\r\n\r\nAs soon as this letter was written, Caesar departed for Milan, where\r\nLouis XII had just arrived, bringing with him proof positive that he had\r\nbeen calumniated in the evacuation of the conquered towns. He also was\r\nentrusted with the pope’s mission to renew for another eighteen months\r\nthe title of legate ’a latere’ in France to Cardinal dumbest, the friend\r\nrather than the minister of Louis XII. Thus, thanks to the public proof\r\nof his innocence and the private use of his influence, Caesar soon made\r\nhis peace with the King of France.\r\n\r\nBut this was not all. It was in the nature of Caesar’s genius to divert\r\nan impending calamity that threatened his destruction so as to come out\r\nof it better than before, and he suddenly saw the advantage he might\r\ntake from the pretended disobedience of his lieutenants. Already he had\r\nbeen disturbed now and again by their growing power, and coveted their\r\ntowns, now he thought the hour had perhaps come for suppressing them\r\nalso, and in the usurpation of their private possessions striking a blow\r\nat Florence, who always escaped him at the very moment when he thought\r\nto take her. It was indeed an annoying thing to have these fortresses\r\nand towns displaying another banner than his own in the midst of the\r\nbeautiful Romagna which he desired for his own kingdom. For Vitellozzo\r\npossessed Citta di Castello, Bentivoglio Bologna, Gian Paolo Baglioni\r\nwas in command of Perugia, Oliverotto had just taken Fermo, and Pandolfo\r\nPetrucci was lord of Siena; it was high time that all these returned:\r\ninto his own hands. The lieutenants of the Duke of Valentinois, like\r\nAlexander’s, were becoming too powerful, and Borgia must inherit from\r\nthem, unless he were willing to let them become his own heirs. He\r\nobtained from Louis XII three hundred lances wherewith to march against\r\nthem. As soon as Vitellozzo Vitelli received Caesar’s letter he\r\nperceived that he was being sacrificed to the fear that the King of\r\nFrance inspired; but he was not one of those victims who suffer their\r\nthroats to be cut in the expiation of a mistake: he was a buffalo of\r\nRomagna who opposed his horns to the knife of the butcher; besides, he\r\nhad the example of Varano and the Manfredi before him, and, death for\r\ndeath, he preferred to perish in arms.\r\n\r\nSo Vitellozzo convoked at Maggione all whose lives or lands were\r\nthreatened by this new reversal of Caesar’s policy. These were Paolo\r\nOrsino, Gian Paolo Baglioni, Hermes Bentivoglio, representing his father\r\nGian, Antonio di Venafro, the envoy of Pandolfo Petrucci, Olivertoxo da\r\nFermo, and the Duke of Urbino: the first six had everything to lose, and\r\nthe last had already lost everything.\r\n\r\nA treaty of alliance was signed between the confederates: they engaged\r\nto resist whether he attacked them severally or all together.\r\n\r\nCaesar learned the existence of this league by its first effects: the\r\nDuke of Urbino, who was adored by his subjects, had come with a handful\r\nof soldiers to the fortress of San Leone, and it had yielded at once. In\r\nless than a week towns and fortresses followed this example, and all the\r\nduchy was once more in the hands of the Duke of Urbino.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, each member of the confederacy openly proclaimed his\r\nrevolt against the common enemy, and took up a hostile attitude.\r\n\r\nCaesar was at Imola, awaiting the French troops, but with scarcely any\r\nmen; so that Bentivoglio, who held part of the country, and the Duke of\r\nUrbino, who had just reconquered the rest of it, could probably have\r\neither taken him or forced him to fly and quit the Romagna, had they\r\nmarched against him; all the more since the two men on whom he counted,\r\nviz., Don Ugo di Cardona, who had entered his service after Capua was\r\ntaken, and Michelotto had mistaken his intention, and were all at once\r\nseparated from him. He had really ordered them to fall back upon Rimini,\r\nand bring 200 light horse and 500 infantry of which they had the\r\ncommand; but, unaware of the urgency of his situation, at the very\r\nmoment when they were attempting to surprise La Pergola and Fossombrone,\r\nthey were surrounded by Orsino of Gravina and Vitellozzo. Ugo di Cardona\r\nand Michelotto defended themselves like lions; but in spite of their\r\nutmost efforts their little band was cut to pieces, and Ugo di Cardona\r\ntaken prisoner, while Michelotto only escaped the same fate by lying\r\ndown among the dead; when night came on, he escaped to Fano.\r\n\r\nBut even alone as he was, almost without troops at Imola, the\r\nconfederates dared attempt nothing against Caesar, whether because of\r\nthe personal fear he inspired, or because in him they respected the ally\r\nof the King of France; they contented themselves with taking the towns\r\nand fortresses in the neighbourhood. Vitellozzo had retaken the\r\nfortresses of Fossombrone, Urbino, Cagli, and Aggobbio; Orsino of\r\nGravina had reconquered Fano and the whole province; while Gian Maria de\r\nVarano, the same who by his absence had escaped being massacred with the\r\nrest of his family, had re-entered Camerino, borne in triumph by his\r\npeople. Not even all this could destroy Caesar’s confidence in his own\r\ngood fortune, and while he was on the one hand urging on the arrival of\r\nthe French troops and calling into his pay all those gentlemen known as\r\n\"broken lances,\" because they went about the country in parties of five\r\nor six only, and attached themselves to anyone who wanted them, he had\r\nopened up negotiations with his enemies, certain that from that very day\r\nwhen he should persuade them to a conference they were undone. Indeed,\r\nCaesar had the power of persuasion as a gift from heaven; and though\r\nthey perfectly well knew his duplicity, they had no power of resisting,\r\nnot so much his actual eloquence as that air of frank good-nature which\r\nMacchiavelli so greatly admired, and which indeed more than once\r\ndeceived even him, wily politician as he was. In order to get Paolo\r\nOrsino to treat with him at Imola, Caesar sent Cardinal Borgia to the\r\nconfederates as a hostage; and on this Paolo Orsino hesitated no longer,\r\nand on the 25th of October, 1502, arrived at Imola.\r\n\r\nCaesar received him as an old friend from whom one might have been\r\nestranged a few days because of some slight passing differences; he\r\nfrankly avowed that all the fault was no doubt on his side, since he had\r\ncontrived to alienate men who were such loyal lords and also such brave\r\ncaptains; but with men of their nature, he added, an honest, honourable\r\nexplanation such as he would give must put everything once more in statu\r\nquo. To prove that it was goodwill, not fear, that brought him back to\r\nthem, he showed Orsino the letters from Cardinal Amboise which announced\r\nthe speedy arrival of French troops; he showed him those he had\r\ncollected about him, in the wish, he declared, that they might be\r\nthoroughly convinced that what he chiefly regretted in the whole matter\r\nwas not so much the loss of the distinguished captains who were the very\r\nsoul of his vast enterprise, as that he had led the world to believe, in\r\na way so fatal to his own interest, that he could for a single instant\r\nfail to recognise their merit; adding that he consequently relied upon\r\nhim, Paolo Orsino, whom he had always cared for most, to bring back the\r\nconfederates by a peace which would be as much for the profit of all as\r\na war was hurtful to all, and that he was ready to sign a treaty in\r\nconsonance with their wishes so long as it should not prejudice his own\r\nhonour.\r\n\r\nOrsino was the man Caesar wanted: full of pride and confidence in\r\nhimself, he was convinced of the truth of the old proverb that says, \"A\r\npope cannot reign eight days, if he has hath the Colonnas and the Orsini\r\nagainst him.\" He believed, therefore, if not in Caesar’s good faith, at\r\nany rate in the necessity he must feel for making peace; accordingly he\r\nsigned with him the following conventions—which only needed\r\nratification—on the 18th of October, 1502, which we reproduce here as\r\nMacchiavelli sent them to the magnificent republic of Florence.\r\n\r\n\"Agreement between the Duke of Valentinois and the Confederates.\r\n\r\n\"Let it be known to the parties mentioned below, and to all who shall\r\nsee these presents, that His Excellency the Duke of Romagna of the one\r\npart and the Orsini of the other part, together with their confederates,\r\ndesiring to put an end to differences, enmities, misunderstandings, and\r\nsuspicions which have arisen between them, have resolved as follows:\r\n\r\n\"There shall be between them peace and alliance true and perpetual, with\r\na complete obliteration of wrongs and injuries which may have taken\r\nplace up to this day, both parties engaging to preserve no resentment of\r\nthe same; and in conformity with the aforesaid peace and union, His\r\nExcellency the Duke of Romagna shall receive into perpetual\r\nconfederation, league, and alliance all the lords aforesaid; and each of\r\nthem shall promise to defend the estates of all in general and of each\r\nin particular against any power that may annoy or attack them for any\r\ncause whatsoever, excepting always nevertheless the Pope Alexander VI\r\nand his Very Christian Majesty Louis XII, King of France: the lords\r\nabove named promising on the other part to unite in the defence of the\r\nperson and estates of His Excellency, as also those of the most\r\nillustrious lords, Don Gaffredo Borgia, Prince of Squillace, Don\r\nRoderigo Borgia, Duke of Sermaneta and Biselli, and Don Gian Borgia,\r\nDuke of Camerino and Negi, all brothers or nephews of the Duke of\r\nRomagna.\r\n\r\n\"Moreover, since the rebellion and usurpation of Urbino have occurred\r\nduring the above-mentioned misunderstandings, all the confederates\r\naforesaid and each of them shall bind themselves to unite all their\r\nforces for the recovery of the estates aforesaid and of such other\r\nplaces as have revolted and been usurped.\r\n\r\n\"His Excellency the Duke of Romagna shall undertake to continue to the\r\nOrsini and Vitelli their ancient engagements in the way of military\r\nservice and on the same conditions.\r\n\r\n\"His Excellency promises further not to insist on the service in person\r\nof more than one of them, as they may choose: the service that the\r\nothers may render shall be voluntary.\r\n\r\n\"He also promises that the second treaty shall be ratified by the\r\nsovereign pontiff, who shall not compel Cardinal Orsino to reside in\r\nRome longer than shall seem convenient to this prelate.\r\n\r\n\"Furthermore, since there are certain differences between the Pope and\r\nthe lord Gian Bentivoglio, the confederates aforesaid agree that they\r\nshall be put to the arbitration of Cardinal Orsino, of His Excellency\r\nthe Duke of Romagna, and of the lord Pandolfo Petrucci, without appeal.\r\n\r\n\"Thus the confederates engage, each and all, so soon as they may be\r\nrequired by the Duke of Romagna, to put into his hands as a hostage one\r\nof the legitimate sons of each of them, in that place and at that time\r\nwhich he may be pleased to indicate.\r\n\r\n\"The same confederates promising moreover, all and each, that if any\r\nproject directed against any one of them come to their knowledge, to\r\ngive warning thereof, and all to prevent such project reciprocally.\r\n\r\n\"It is agreed, over and above, between the Duke of Romagna and the\r\nconfederates aforesaid, to regard as a common enemy any who shall fail\r\nto keep the present stipulations, and to unite in the destruction of any\r\nStates not conforming thereto.\r\n\r\n\"(Signed) CAESAR, PAOLO ORSINO.\r\n\r\n\"AGAPIT, Secretary.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time, while Orsino was carrying to the confederates the\r\ntreaty drawn up between him and the duke, Bentivoglio, not willing to\r\nsubmit to the arbitration indicated, made an offer to Caesar of settling\r\ntheir differences by a private treaty, and sent his son to arrange the\r\nconditions: after some parleying, they were settled as follows:—\r\n\r\nBentivaglio should separate his fortunes from the Vitelli and Orsini;\r\n\r\nHe should furnish the Duke of Valentinois with a hundred men-at-arms and\r\na hundred mounted archers for eight years;\r\n\r\nHe should pay 12,000 ducats per annum to Caesar, for the support of a\r\nhundred lances;\r\n\r\nIn return for this, his son Hannibal was to marry the sister of the\r\nArchbishop of Enna, who was Caesar’s niece, and the pope was to\r\nrecognise his sovereignty in Bologna;\r\n\r\nThe King of France, the Duke of Ferrara, and the republic of Florence\r\nwere to be the guarantors of this treaty.\r\n\r\nBut the convention brought to the confederates by Orsino was the cause\r\nof great difficulties on their part. Vitellozza Vitelli in particular,\r\nwho knew Caesar the best, never ceased to tell the other condottieri\r\nthat so prompt and easy a peace must needs be the cover to some trap;\r\nbut since Caesar had meanwhile collected a considerable army at Imola,\r\nand the four hundred lances lent him by Louis XII had arrived at last,\r\nVitellozzo and Oliverotto decided to sign the treaty that Orsino\r\nbrought, and to let the Duke of Urbino and the lord of Camerino know of\r\nit; they, seeing plainly that it was henceforth impossible to make a\r\ndefence unaided, had retired, the one to Citta di Castello and the other\r\ninto the kingdom of Naples.\r\n\r\nBut Caesar, saying nothing of his intentions, started on the 10th of\r\nDecember, and made his way to Cesena with a powerful army once more\r\nunder his command. Fear began to spread on all sides, not only in\r\nRomagna but in the whole of Northern Italy; Florence, seeing him move\r\naway from her, only thought it a blind to conceal his intentions; while\r\nVenice, seeing him approach her frontiers, despatched all her troops to\r\nthe banks of the Po. Caesar perceived their fear, and lest harm should\r\nbe done to himself by the mistrust it might inspire, he sent away all\r\nFrench troops in his service as soon as he reached Cesena, except a\r\nhundred men with M. de Candale, his brother-in-law; it was then seen\r\nthat he only had 2000 cavalry and 2000 infantry with him. Several days\r\nwere spent in parleying, for at Cesena Caesar found the envoys of the\r\nVitelli and Orsini, who themselves were with their army in the duchy of\r\nUrbino; but after the preliminary discussions as to the right course to\r\nfollow in carrying on the plan of conquest, there arose such\r\ndifficulties between the general-in-chief and these agents, that they\r\ncould not but see the impossibility of getting anything settled by\r\nintermediaries, and the urgent necessity of a conference between Caesar\r\nand one of the chiefs. So Oliverotto ran the risk of joining the duke in\r\norder to make proposals to him, either to march on Tuscany or to take\r\nSinigaglia, which was the only place in the duchy of Urbino that had not\r\nagain fallen into Caesar’s power. Caesar’s reply was that he did not\r\ndesire to war upon Tuscany, because the Tuscans were his friends; but\r\nthat he approved of the lieutenants’ plan with regard to Sinigaglia, and\r\ntherefore was marching towards Fano.\r\n\r\nBut the daughter of Frederic, the former Duke of Urbino, who held the\r\ntown of Sinigaglia, and who was called the lady-prefect, because she had\r\nmarried Gian delta Rovere, whom his uncle, Sixtus IV, had made prefect\r\nof Rome, judging that it would be impossible to defend herself against\r\nthe forces the Duke of Valentinois was bringing, left the citadel in the\r\nhands of a captain, recommending him to get the best terms he could for\r\nthe town, and took boat for Venice.\r\n\r\nCaesar learned this news at Rimini, through a messenger from Vitelli and\r\nthe Orsini, who said that the governor of the citadel, though refusing\r\nto yield to them, was quite ready to make terms with him, and\r\nconsequently they would engage to go to the town and finish the business\r\nthere. Caesar’s reply was that in consequence of this information he was\r\nsending some of his troops to Cesena and Imola, for they would be\r\nuseless to him, as he should now have theirs, which together with the\r\nescort he retained would be sufficient, since his only object was the\r\ncomplete pacification of the duchy of Urbino. He added that this\r\npacification would not be possible if his old friends continued to\r\ndistrust him, and to discuss through intermediaries alone plans in which\r\ntheir own fortunes were interested as well as his. The messenger\r\nreturned with this answer, and the confederates, though feeling, it is\r\ntrue, the justice of Caesar’s remarks, none the less hesitated to comply\r\nwith his demand. Vitellozzo Vitelli in particular showed a want of\r\nconfidence in him which nothing seemed able to subdue; but, pressed by\r\nOliverotto, Gravina, and Orsino, he consented at last to await the\r\nduke’s coming; making concession rather because he could not bear to\r\nappear more timid than his companions, than because of any confidence he\r\nfelt in the return of friendship that Borgia was displaying.\r\n\r\nThe duke learned the news of this decision, so much desired, when he\r\narrived at Fano on the 20th of December 1502. At once he summoned eight\r\nof his most faithful friends, among whom were d’Enna, his nephew,\r\nMichelotto, and Ugo di Cardona, and ordered them, as soon as they\r\narrived at Sinigaglia, and had seen Vitellozzo, Gravina, Oliveratta, and\r\nOrsino come out to meet them, on a pretext of doing them honour, to\r\nplace themselves on the right and left hand of the four generals, two\r\nbeside each, so that at a given signal they might either stab or arrest\r\nthem; next he assigned to each of them his particular man, bidding them\r\nnot quit his side until he had reentered Sinigaglia and arrived at the\r\nquarters prepared for him; then he sent orders to such of the soldiers\r\nas were in cantonments in the neighbourhood to assemble to the number of\r\n8000 on the banks of the Metaurus, a little river of Umbria which runs\r\ninto the Adriatic and has been made famous by the defeat of Hannibal.\r\n\r\nThe duke arrived at the rendezvous given to his army on the 31st of\r\nDecember, and instantly sent out in front two hundred horse, and\r\nimmediately behind them his infantry; following close in the midst of\r\nhis men-at-arms, following the coast of the Adriatic, with the mountains\r\non his right and the sea on his left, which in part of the way left only\r\nspace for the army to march ten abreast.\r\n\r\nAfter four hours’ march, the duke at a turn of the path perceived\r\nSinigaglia, nearly a mile distant from the sea, and a bowshot from the\r\nmountains; between the army and the town ran a little river, whose banks\r\nhe had to follow for some distance. At last he found a bridge opposite a\r\nsuburb of the town, and here Caesar ordered his cavalry to stop: it was\r\ndrawn up in two lines, one between the road and the river, the other on\r\nthe side of the country, leaving the whole width of the road to the\r\ninfantry: which latter defiled, crossed the bridge, and entering the\r\ntown, drew themselves up in battle array in the great square.\r\n\r\nOn their side, Vitellazzo, Gravina, Orsino, and Oliverotto, to make room\r\nfor the duke’s army, had quartered their soldiers in little towns or\r\nvillages in the neighbourhood of Sinigaglia; Oliverotto alone had kept\r\nnearly 1000 infantry and 150 horse, who were in barracks in the suburb\r\nthrough which the duke entered.\r\n\r\nCaesar had made only a few steps towards the town when he perceived\r\nVitellozzo at the gate, with the Duke of Gravina and Orsina, who all\r\ncame out to meet him; the last two quite gay and confident, but the\r\nfirst so gloomy and dejected that you would have thought he foresaw the\r\nfate that was in store for him; and doubtless he had not been without\r\nsome presentiments; for when he left his army to come to Sinigaglia, he\r\nhad bidden them farewell as though never to meet again, had commended\r\nthe care of his family to the captains, and embraced his children with\r\ntears—a weakness which appeared strange to all who knew him as a brave\r\ncondottiere.\r\n\r\nThe duke marched up to them holding out his hand, as a sign that all was\r\nover and forgotten, and did it with an air at once so loyal and so\r\nsmiling that Gravina and Orsina could no longer doubt the genuine return\r\nof his friendship, and it was only Vitellozza still appeared sad. At the\r\nsame moment, exactly as they had been commanded, the duke’s accomplices\r\ntook their posts on the right and left of those they were to watch, who\r\nwere all there except Oliverotto, whom the duke could not see, and began\r\nto seek with uneasy looks; but as he crossed the suburb he perceived him\r\nexercising his troops on the square. Caesar at once despatched\r\nMichelotto and d’Enna, with a message that it was a rash thing to have\r\nhis troops out, when they might easily start some quarrel with the\r\nduke’s men and bring about an affray: it would be much better to settle\r\nthem in barracks and then come to join his companions, who were with\r\nCaesar. Oliverotto, drawn by the same fate as his friends, made no\r\nobjection, ordered his soldiers indoors, and put his horse to the gallop\r\nto join the duke, escorted on either side by d’Enna and Michelotto.\r\nCaesar, on seeing him, called him, took him by the hand, and continued\r\nhis march to the palace that had been prepared for him, his four victims\r\nfollowing after.\r\n\r\nArrived on the threshold, Caesar dismounted, and signing to the leader\r\nof the men-at-arms to, await his orders, he went in first, followed by\r\nOliverotto, Gravina, Vitellozzo Vitelli, and Orsino, each accompanied by\r\nhis two satellites; but scarcely had they gone upstairs and into the\r\nfirst room when the door was shut behind them, and Caesar turned round,\r\nsaying, \"The hour has come!\" This was the signal agreed upon. Instantly\r\nthe former confederates were seized, thrown down, and forced to\r\nsurrender with a dagger at their throat. Then, while they were being\r\ncarried to a dungeon, Caesar opened the window, went out on the balcony\r\nand cried out to the leader of his men-at-arms, \"Go forward!\" The man\r\nwas in the secret, he rushed on with his band towards the barracks where\r\nOliverotto’s soldiers had just been consigned, and they, suddenly\r\nsurprised and off their guard, were at once made prisoners; then the\r\nduke’s troops began to pillage the town, and he summoned Macchiavelli.\r\n\r\nCaesar and the Florentine envoy were nearly two hours shut up together,\r\nand since Macchiavelli himself recounts the history of this interview,\r\nwe will give his own words.\r\n\r\n\"He summoned me,\" says the Florentine ambassador, \"and in the calmest\r\nmanner showed me his joy at the success of this enterprise, which he\r\nassured me he had spoken of to me the evening before; I remember that he\r\ndid, but I did not at that time understand what he meant; next he\r\nexplained, in terms of much feeling and lively affection for our city,\r\nthe different motives which had made him desire your alliance, a desire\r\nto which he hopes you will respond. He ended with charging me to lay\r\nthree proposals before your lordships: first, that you rejoice with him\r\nin the destruction at a single blow of the mortal enemies of the king,\r\nhimself, and you, and the consequent disappearance of all seeds of\r\ntrouble and dissension likely to waste Italy: this service of his,\r\ntogether with his refusal to allow the prisoners to march against you,\r\nought, he thinks, to excite your gratitude towards him; secondly, he\r\nbegs that you will at this juncture give him a striking proof of your\r\nfriendliness, by urging your cavalry’s advance towards Borgo, and there\r\nassembling some infantry also, in order that they may march with him,\r\nshould need arise, on Castello or on Perugia. Lastly, he desires—and\r\nthis is his third condition—that you arrest the Duke of Urbino, if he\r\nshould flee from Castello into your territories, when he learns that\r\nVitellozzo is a prisoner.\r\n\r\n\"When I objected that to give him up would not beseem the dignity of the\r\nrepublic, and that you would never consent, he approved of my words, and\r\nsaid that it would be enough for you to keep the duke, and not give him\r\nhis liberty without His Excellency’s permission. I have promised to give\r\nyou all this information, to which he awaits your reply.\"\r\n\r\nThe same night eight masked men descended to the dungeon where the\r\nprisoners lay: they believed at that moment that the fatal hour had\r\narrived for all. But this time the executioners had to do with\r\nVitellozzo and Oliverotto alone. When these two captains heard that they\r\nwere condemned, Oliverotto burst forth into reproaches against\r\nVitellozzo, saying that it was all his fault that they had taken up arms\r\nagainst the duke: not a word Vitellozzo answered except a prayer that\r\nthe pope might grant him plenary indulgence for all his sins. Then the\r\nmasked men took them away, leaving Orsino and Gravina to await a similar\r\nfate, and led away the two chosen out to die to a secluded spot outside\r\nthe ramparts of the town, where they were strangled and buried at once\r\nin two trenches that had been dug beforehand.\r\n\r\nThe two others were kept alive until it should be known if the pope had\r\narrested Cardinal Orsino, archbishop of Florence and lord of Santa\r\nCroce; and when the answer was received in the affirmative from His\r\nHoliness, Gravina and Orsina, who had been transferred to a castle, were\r\nlikewise strangled.\r\n\r\nThe duke, leaving instructions with Michelotto, set off for Sinigaglia\r\nas soon as the first execution was over, assuring Macchiavelli that he\r\nhad never had any other thought than that of giving tranquillity to the\r\nRomagna and to Tuscany, and also that he thought he had succeeded by\r\ntaking and putting to death the men who had been the cause of all the\r\ntrouble; also that any other revolt that might take place in the future\r\nwould be nothing but sparks that a drop of water could extinguish.\r\n\r\nThe pope had barely learned that Caesar had his enemies in his power,\r\nwhen, eager to play the same winning game himself, he announced to\r\nCardinal Orsino, though it was then midnight, that his son had taken\r\nSinigaglia, and gave him an invitation to come the next morning and talk\r\nover the good news. The cardinal, delighted at this increase of favour,\r\ndid not miss his appointment. So, in the morning, he started an\r\nhorseback for the Vatican; but at a turn of the first street he met the\r\ngovernor of Rome with a detachment of cavalry, who congratulated himself\r\non the happy chance that they were taking the same road, and accompanied\r\nhim to the threshold of the Vatican. There the cardinal dismounted, and\r\nbegan to ascend the stairs; scarcely, however, had he reached the first\r\nlanding before his mules and carriages were seized and shut in the\r\npalace stables. When he entered the hall of the Perropont, he found that\r\nhe and all his suite were surrounded by armed men, who led him into\r\nanother apartment, called the Vicar’s Hall, where he found the Abbate\r\nAlviano, the protonotary Orsino, Jacopo Santa Croce, and Rinaldo Orsino,\r\nwho were all prisoners like himself; at the same time the governor\r\nreceived orders to seize the castle of Monte Giardino, which belonged to\r\nthe Orsini, and take away all the jewels, all the hangings, all the\r\nfurniture, and all the silver that he might find.\r\n\r\nThe governor carried out his orders conscientiously, and brought to the\r\nVatican everything he seized, down to the cardinal’s account-book. On\r\nconsulting this book, the pope found out two things: first, that a sum\r\nof 2000 ducats was due to the cardinal, no debtor’s name being\r\nmentioned; secondly, that the cardinal had bought three months before,\r\nfor 1500 Roman crowns, a magnificent pearl which could not be found\r\namong the objects belonging to him: on which Alexander ordered that from\r\nthat very moment until the negligence in the cardinal’s accounts was\r\nrepaired, the men who were in the habit of bringing him food twice a day\r\non behalf of his mother should not be admitted into the Castle Sant’\r\nAngelo. The same day, the cardinal’s mother sent the pope the 2000\r\nducats, and the next day his mistress, in man’s attire, came in person\r\nto bring the missing pearl. His Holiness, however, was so struck with\r\nher beauty in this costume, that, we are told, he let her keep the pearl\r\nfor the same price she had paid for it.\r\n\r\nThen the pope allowed the cardinal to have his food brought as before,\r\nand he died of poison on the 22nd of February—that is, two days after\r\nhis accounts had been set right.\r\n\r\nThat same night the Prince of Squillace set off to take possession, in\r\nthe pope’s name, of the lands of the deceased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Valentinois had continued, his road towards Citta di\r\nCastello and Perugia, and had seized these two towns without striking a\r\nblow; for the Vitelli had fled from the former, and the latter had been\r\nabandoned by Gian Paolo Baglione with no attempt whatever at resistance.\r\nThere still remained Siena, where Pandolfo Petrucci was shut up, the\r\nonly man remaining of all who had joined the league against Caesar.\r\n\r\nBut Siena was under the protection of the French. Besides, Siena was not\r\none of the States of the Church, and Caesar had no rights there.\r\nTherefore he was content with insisting upon Pandolfo Petrucci’s leaving\r\nthe town and retiring to Lucca, which he accordingly did.\r\n\r\nThen all on this side being peaceful and the whole of Romagna in\r\nsubjection, Caesar resolved to return to Rome and help the pope to\r\ndestroy all that was left of the Orsini.\r\n\r\nThis was all the easier because Louis XII, having suffered reverses in\r\nthe kingdom of Naples, had since then been much concerned with his own\r\naffairs to disturb himself about his allies. So Caesar, doing for the\r\nneighbourhood of the Holy See the same thing that he had done for the\r\nRomagna, seized in succession Vicovaro, Cera, Palombera, Lanzano, and\r\nCervetti; when these conquests were achieved, having nothing else to do\r\nnow that he had brought the pontifical States into subjection from the\r\nfrontiers of Naples to those of Venice, he returned to Rome to concert\r\nwith his father as to the means of converting his duchy into a kingdom.\r\n\r\nCaesar arrived at the right moment to share with Alexander the property\r\nof Cardinal Gian Michele, who had just died, having received a poisoned\r\ncup from the hands of the pope.\r\n\r\nThe future King of Italy found his father preoccupied with a grand\r\nproject: he had resolved, for the Feast of St. Peter’s, to create nine\r\ncardinals. What he had to gain from these nominations is as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst, the cardinals elected would leave all their offices vacant; these\r\noffices would fall into the hands of the pope, and he would sell them;\r\n\r\nSecondly, each of them would buy his election, more or less dear\r\naccording to his fortune; the price, left to be settled at the pope’s\r\nfancy, would vary from 10,000 to 40,000 ducats;\r\n\r\nLastly, since as cardinals they would by law lose the right of making a\r\nwill, the pope, in order to inherit from them, had only to poison them:\r\nthis put him in the position of a butcher who, if he needs money, has\r\nonly to cut the throat of the fattest sheep in the flock.\r\n\r\nThe nomination came to pass: the new cardinals were Giovanni Castellaro\r\nValentine, archbishop of Trani; Francesco Remolini, ambassador from the\r\nKing of Aragon; Francesco Soderini, bishop of Volterra; Melchiore Copis,\r\nbishop of Brissina; Nicolas Fiesque, bishop of Frejus; Francesco di\r\nSprate, bishop of Leome; Adriano Castellense, clerk of the chamber,\r\ntreasurer-general, and secretary of the briefs; Francesco Boris, bishop\r\nof Elva, patriarch of Constantinople, and secretary to the pope; and\r\nGiacomo Casanova, protonotary and private chamberlain to His Holiness.\r\n\r\nThe price of their simony paid and their vacated offices sold, the pope\r\nmade his choice of those he was to poison: the number was fixed at\r\nthree, one old and two new; the old one was Cardinal Casanova, and the\r\nnew ones Melchiore Copis and Adriano Castellense, who had taken the name\r\nof Adrian of Carneta from that town where he had been born, and where,\r\nin the capacity of clerk of the chamber, treasurer-general, and\r\nsecretary of briefs, he had amassed an immense fortune.\r\n\r\nSo, when all was settled between Caesar and the pope, they invited their\r\nchosen guests to supper in a vineyard situated near the Vatican,\r\nbelonging to the Cardinal of Corneto. In the morning of this day, the\r\n2nd of August, they sent their servants and the steward to make all\r\npreparations, and Caesar himself gave the pope’s butler two bottles of\r\nwine prepared with the white powder resembling sugar whose mortal\r\nproperties he had so often proved, and gave orders that he was to serve\r\nthis wine only when he was told, and only to persons specially\r\nindicated; the butler accordingly put the wine an a sideboard apart,\r\nbidding the waiters on no account to touch it, as it was reserved for\r\nthe pope’s drinking.\r\n\r\n[The poison of the Borgias, say contemporary writers, was of two kinds,\r\npowder and liquid. The poison in the form of powder was a sort of white\r\nflour, almost impalpable, with the taste of sugar, and called\r\nContarella. Its composition is unknown.\r\n\r\nThe liquid poison was prepared, we are told in so strange a fashion that\r\nwe cannot pass it by in silence. We repeat here what we read, and vouch\r\nfor nothing ourselves, lest science should give us the lie.\r\n\r\nA strong dose of arsenic was administered to a boar; as soon as the\r\npoison began to take effect, he was hung up by his heels; convulsions\r\nsupervened, and a froth deadly and abundant ran out from his jaws; it\r\nwas this froth, collected into a silver vessel and transferred into a\r\nbottle hermetically sealed, that made the liquid poison.]\r\n\r\nTowards evening Alexander VI walked from the Vatican leaning on Caesar’s\r\narm, and turned his steps towards the vineyard, accompanied by Cardinal\r\nCaraffa; but as the heat was great and the climb rather steep, the pope,\r\nwhen he reached the top, stopped to take breath; then putting his hand\r\non his breast, he found that he had left in his bedroom a chain that he\r\nalways wore round his neck, which suspended a gold medallion that\r\nenclosed the sacred host. He owed this habit to a prophecy that an\r\nastrologer had made, that so long as he carried about a consecrated\r\nwafer, neither steel nor poison could take hold upon him. Now, finding\r\nhimself without his talisman, he ordered Monsignors Caraffa to hurry\r\nback at once to the Vatican, and told him in which part of his room he\r\nhad left it, so that he might get it and bring it him without delay.\r\nThen, as the walk had made him thirsty, he turned to a valet, giving\r\nsigns with his hand as he did so that his messenger should make haste,\r\nand asked for something to drink. Caesar, who was also thirsty, ordered\r\nthe man to bring two glasses. By a curious coincidence, the butler had\r\njust gone back to the Vatican to fetch some magnificent peaches that had\r\nbeen sent that very day to the pope, but which had been forgotten when\r\nhe came here; so the valet went to the under butler, saying that His\r\nHoliness and Monsignors the Duke of Romagna were thirsty and asking for\r\na drink. The under butler, seeing two bottles of wine set apart, and\r\nhaving heard that this wine was reserved for the pope, took one, and\r\ntelling the valet to bring two glasses on a tray, poured out this wine,\r\nwhich both drank, little thinking that it was what they had themselves\r\nprepared to poison their guests.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Caraffa hurried to the Vatican, and, as he knew the palace\r\nwell, went up to the pope’s bedroom, a light in his hand and attended by\r\nno servant. As he turned round a corridor a puff of wind blew out his\r\nlamp; still, as he knew the way, he went on, thinking there was no need\r\nof seeing to find the object he was in search of; but as he entered the\r\nroom he recoiled a step, with a cry of terror: he beheld a ghastly\r\napparition; it seemed that there before his eyes, in the middle of the\r\nroom, between the door and the cabinet which held the medallion,\r\nAlexander VI, motionless and livid, was lying on a bier at whose four\r\ncorners there burned four torches. The cardinal stood still for a\r\nmoment, his eyes fixed, and his hair standing on end, without strength\r\nto move either backward or forward; then thinking it was all a trick of\r\nfancy or an apparition of the devil’s making, he made the sign of the\r\ncross, invoking God’s holy name; all instantly vanished, torches, bier,\r\nand corpse, and the seeming mortuary, chamber was once more in darkness.\r\n\r\nThen Cardinal Caraffa, who has himself recorded this strange event, and\r\nwho was afterwards Pope Paul IV, entered baldly, and though an icy sweat\r\nran dawn his brow, he went straight to the cabinet, and in the drawer\r\nindicated found the gold chain and the medallion, took them, and hastily\r\nwent out to give them to the pope. He found supper served, the guests\r\narrived, and His Holiness ready to take his place at table; as soon as\r\nthe cardinal was in sight, His Holiness, who was very pale, made one\r\nstep towards him; Caraffa doubled his pace, and handed the medallion to\r\nhim; but as the pope stretched forth his arm to take it, he fell back\r\nwith a cry, instantly followed by violent convulsions: an instant later,\r\nas he advanced to render his father assistance, Caesar was similarly\r\nseized; the effect of the poison had been more rapid than usual, for\r\nCaesar had doubled the dose, and there is little doubt that their heated\r\ncondition increased its activity.\r\n\r\nThe two stricken men were carried side by side to the Vatican, where\r\neach was taken to his own rooms: from that moment they never met again.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he reached his bed, the pope was seized with a violent fever,\r\nwhich did not give way to emetics or to bleeding; almost immediately it\r\nbecame necessary to administer the last sacraments of the Church; but\r\nhis admirable bodily constitution, which seemed to have defied old age,\r\nwas strong enough to fight eight days with death; at last, after a week\r\nof mortal agony, he died, without once uttering the name of Caesar or\r\nLucrezia, who were the two poles around which had turned all his\r\naffections and all his crimes. His age was seventy-two, and he had\r\nreigned eleven years.\r\n\r\nCaesar, perhaps because he had taken less of the fatal beverage, perhaps\r\nbecause the strength of his youth overcame the strength of the poison,\r\nor maybe, as some say, because when he reached his own rooms he had\r\nswallowed an antidote known only to himself, was not so prostrated as to\r\nlose sight for a moment of the terrible position he was in: he summoned\r\nhis faithful Michelotto, with those he could best count on among his\r\nmen, and disposed this band in the various rooms that led to his own,\r\nordering the chief never to leave the foot of his bed, but to sleep\r\nlying on a rug, his hand upon the handle of his soard.\r\n\r\nThe treatment had been the same for Caesar as for the pope, but in\r\naddition to bleeding and emetics strange baths were added, which Caesar\r\nhad himself asked for, having heard that in a similar case they had once\r\ncured Ladislaus, King of Naples. Four posts, strongly welded to the\r\nfloor and ceiling, were set up in his room, like the machines at which\r\nfarriers shoe horses; every day a bull was brought in, turned over on\r\nhis back and tied by his four legs to the four posts; then, when he was\r\nthus fixed, a cut was made in his belly a foot and a half long, through\r\nwhich the intestines were drawn out; then Caesar slipped into this\r\nliving bath of blood: when the bull was dead, Caesar was taken out and\r\nrolled up in burning hot blankets, where, after copious perspirations,\r\nhe almost always felt some sort of relief.\r\n\r\nEvery two hours Caesar sent to ask news of his father: he hardly waited\r\nto hear that he was dead before, though still at death’s door himself,\r\nhe summoned up all the force of character and presence of mind that\r\nnaturally belonged to him. He ordered Michelotto to shut the doors of\r\nthe Vatican before the report of Alexander’s decease could spread about\r\nthe town, and forbade anyone whatsoever to enter the pope’s apartments\r\nuntil the money and papers had been removed. Michelotto obeyed at once,\r\nwent to find Cardinal Casanova, held a dagger at his throat, and made\r\nhim deliver up the keys of the pope’s rooms and cabinets; then, under\r\nhis guidance, took away two chests full of gold, which perhaps contained\r\n100,000 Roman crowns in specie, several boxes full of jewels, much\r\nsilver and many precious vases; all these were carried to Caesar’s\r\nchamber; the guards of the room were doubled; then the doors of the\r\nVatican were once more thrown open, and the death of the pope was\r\nproclaimed.\r\n\r\nAlthough the news was expected, it produced none the less a terrible\r\neffect in Rome; for although Caesar was still alive, his condition left\r\neveryone in suspense: had the mighty Duke of Romagna, the powerful\r\ncondottiere who had taken thirty towns and fifteen fortresses in five\r\nyears, been seated, sword in hand, upon his charger, nothing would have\r\nbeen uncertain of fluctuating even for a moment; for, as Caesar\r\nafterwards told Macchiavelli, his ambitious soul had provided for all\r\nthings that could occur on the day of the pope’s death, except the one\r\nthat he should be dying himself; but being nailed down to his bed,\r\nsweating off the effects the poison had wrought; so, though he had kept\r\nhis power of thinking he could no longer act, but must needs wait and\r\nsuffer the course of events, instead of marching on in front and\r\ncontrolling them.\r\n\r\nThus he was forced to regulate his actions no longer by his own plans\r\nbut according to circumstances. His most bitter enemies, who could press\r\nhim hardest, were the Orsini and the Colonnas: from the one family he\r\nhad taken their blood, from the other their goods.\r\n\r\nSo he addressed himself to those to whom he could return what he had\r\ntaken, and opened negotiations with the Colonnas.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the obsequies of the pope were going forward: the\r\nvice-chancellor had sent out orders to the highest among the clergy, the\r\nsuperiors of convents, and the secular orders, not to fail to appear,\r\naccording to regular custom, on pain of being despoiled of their office\r\nand dignities, each bringing his own company to the Vatican, to be\r\npresent at the pope’s funeral; each therefore appeared on the day and at\r\nthe hour appointed at the pontifical palace, whence the body was to be\r\nconveyed to the church of St. Peter’s, and there buried. The corpse was\r\nfound to be abandoned and alone in the mortuary chamber; for everyone of\r\nthe name of Borgia, except Caesar, lay hidden, not knowing what might\r\ncome to pass. This was indeed well justified; for Fabio Orsino, meeting\r\none member of the family, stabbed him, and as a sign of the hatred they\r\nhad sworn to one another, bathed his mouth and hands in the blood.\r\n\r\nThe agitation in Rome was so great, that when the corpse of Alexander VI\r\nwas about to enter the church there occurred a kind of panic, such as\r\nwill suddenly arise in times of popular agitation, instantly causing so\r\ngreat a disturbance in the funeral cortege that the guards drew up in\r\nbattle array, the clergy fled into the sacristy, and the bearers dropped\r\nthe bier.\r\n\r\nThe people, tearing off the pall which covered it, disclosed the corpse,\r\nand everyone could see with impunity and close at hand the man who,\r\nfifteen days before, had made princes, kings and emperors tremble, from\r\none end of the world to the other.\r\n\r\nBut in accordance with that religious feeling towards death which all\r\nmen instinctively feel, and which alone survives every other, even in\r\nthe heart of the atheist, the bier was taken up again and carried to the\r\nfoot of the great altar in St. Peter’s, where, set on trestles, it was\r\nexposed to public view; but the body had become so black, so deformed\r\nand swollen, that it was horrible to behold; from its nose a bloody\r\nmatter escaped, the mouth gaped hideously, and the tongue was so\r\nmonstrously enlarged that it filled the whole cavity; to this frightful\r\nappearance was added a decomposition so great that, although at the\r\npope’s funeral it is customary to kiss the hand which bore the\r\nFisherman’s ring, not one approached to offer this mark of respect and\r\nreligious reverence to the representative of God on earth.\r\n\r\nTowards seven o’clock in the evening, when the declining day adds so\r\ndeep a melancholy to the silence of a church, four porters and two\r\nworking carpenters carried the corpse into the chapel where it was to be\r\ninterred, and, lifting it off the catafalque, where it lay in state, put\r\nit in the coffin which was to be its last abode; but it was found that\r\nthe coffin was too short, and the body could not be got in till the legs\r\nwere bent and thrust in with violent blows; then the carpenters put on\r\nthe lid, and while one of them sat on the top to force the knees to\r\nbend, the others hammered in the nails: amid those Shakespearian\r\npleasantries that sound as the last orison in the ear of the mighty;\r\nthen, says Tommaso Tommasi, he was placed on the right of the great\r\naltar of St. Peter’s, beneath a very ugly tomb.\r\n\r\nThe next morning this epitaph was found inscribed upon the tomb:\r\n\r\n    \"VENDIT ALEXANDER CLAVES, ALTARIA, CHRISTUM:\r\n      EMERAT ILLE PRIUS, VENDERE JUKE POTEST\";\r\n\r\nthat is,\r\n\r\n    \"Pope Alexander sold the Christ, the altars, and the keys:\r\n      But anyone who buys a thing may sell it if he please.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the effect produced at Rome by Alexander’s death, one may imagine\r\nwhat happened not only in the whole of Italy but also in the rest of the\r\nworld: for a moment Europe swayed, for the column which supported the\r\nvault of the political edifice had given way, and the star with eyes of\r\nflame and rays of blood, round which all things had revolved for the\r\nlast eleven years, was now extinguished, and for a moment the world, on\r\na sudden struck motionless, remained in silence and darkness.\r\n\r\nAfter the first moment of stupefaction, all who had an injury to avenge\r\narose and hurried to the chase. Sforza retook Pesaro, Bagloine Perugia,\r\nGuido and Ubaldo Urbino, and La Rovere Sinigaglia; the Vitelli entered\r\nCitta di Castello, the Appiani Piombino, the Orsini Monte Giordano and\r\ntheir other territories; Romagna alone remained impassive and loyal, for\r\nthe people, who have no concern with the quarrels of the great, provided\r\nthey do not affect themselves, had never been so happy as under the\r\ngovernment of Caesar.\r\n\r\nThe Colonnas were pledged to maintain a neutrality, and had been\r\nconsequently restored to the possession of their castles and the cities\r\nof Chiuzano, Capo d’Anno, Frascati, Rocca di Papa, and Nettuno, which\r\nthey found in a better condition than when they had left them, as the\r\npope had had them embellished and fortified.\r\n\r\nCaesar was still in the Vatican with his troops, who, loyal to him in\r\nhis misfortune, kept watch about the palace, where he was writhing on\r\nhis bed of pain and roaring like a wounded lion. The cardinals, who had\r\nin their first terror fled, each his own way, instead of attending the\r\npope’s obsequies, began to assemble once more, some at the Minerva,\r\nothers around Cardinal Caraffa. Frightened by the troops that Caesar\r\nstill had, especially since the command was entrusted to Michelotto,\r\nthey collected all the money they could to levy an army of 2000 soldiers\r\nwith. Charles Taneo at their head, with the title of Captain of the\r\nSacred College. It was then hoped that peace was re-established, when it\r\nwas heard that Prospero Colonna was coming with 3000 men from the side\r\nof Naples, and Fabio Orsino from the side of Viterbo with 200 horse and\r\nmore than 1000 infantry. Indeed, they entered Rome at only one day’s\r\ninterval one from another, by so similar an ardour were they inspired.\r\n\r\nThus there were five armies in Rome: Caesar’s army, holding the Vatican\r\nand the Borgo; the army of the Bishop of Nicastro, who had received from\r\nAlexander the guardianship of the Castle Sant’ Angelo and had shut\r\nhimself up there, refusing to yield; the army of the Sacred College,\r\nwhich was stationed round about the Minerva; the army of Prospero\r\nColonna, which was encamped at the Capitol; and the army of Fabio\r\nOrsino, in barracks at the Ripetta.\r\n\r\nOn their side, the Spaniards had advanced to Terracino, and the French\r\nto Nepi. The cardinals saw that Rome now stood upon a mine which the\r\nleast spark might cause to explode: they summoned the ambassadors of the\r\nEmperor of Germany, the Kings of France and Spain, and the republic of\r\nVenice to raise their voice in the name of their masters. The\r\nambassadors, impressed with the urgency of the situation, began by\r\ndeclaring the Sacred College inviolable: they then ordered the Orsini,\r\nthe Colonnas, and the Duke of Valentinois to leave Rome and go each his\r\nown, way.\r\n\r\nThe Orsini were the first to submit: the next morning their example was\r\nfollowed by the Colonnas. No one was left but Caesar, who said he was\r\nwilling to go, but desired to make his conditions beforehand: the\r\nVatican was undermined, he declared, and if his demands were refused he\r\nand those who came to take him should be blown up together.\r\n\r\nIt was known that his were never empty threats they came to terms with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n[Caesar promised to remain ten miles away from Rome the whole time the\r\nConclave lasted, and not to take any action against the town or any\r\nother of the Ecclesiastical States: Fabio Orsino and. Prospero Colonna\r\nhad made the same promises.]\r\n\r\n[It was agreed that Caesar should quit Rome with his army, artillery,\r\nand baggage; and to ensure his not being attacked or molested in the\r\nstreets, the Sacred College should add to his numbers 400 infantry, who,\r\nin case of attack or insult, would fight for him. The Venetian\r\nambassador answered for the Orsini, the Spanish ambassador for the\r\nColonnas, the ambassador of France for Caesar.]\r\n\r\nAt the day and hour appointed Caesar sent out his artillery, which\r\nconsisted of eighteen pieces of cannon, and 400 infantry of the Sacred\r\nCollege, on each of whom he bestowed a ducat: behind the artillery came\r\na hundred chariots escorted by his advance guard.\r\n\r\nThe duke was carried out of the gate of the Vatican: he lay on a bed\r\ncovered with a scarlet canopy, supported by twelve halberdiers, leaning\r\nforward on his cushions so that no one might see his face with its\r\npurple lips and bloodshot eyes: beside him was his naked sword, to show\r\nthat, feeble as he was, he could use it at need: his finest charger,\r\ncaparisoned in black velvet embroidered with his arms, walked beside the\r\nbed, led by a page, so that Caesar could mount in case of surprise or\r\nattack: before him and behind, both right and left, marched his army,\r\ntheir arms in rest, but without beating of drums or blowing of trumpets:\r\nthis gave a sombre, funereal air to the whole procession, which at the\r\ngate of the city met Prospero Colonna awaiting it with a considerable\r\nband of men.\r\n\r\nCaesar thought at first that, breaking his word as he had so often done\r\nhimself, Prospero Colonna was going to attack him. He ordered a halt,\r\nand prepared to mount his horse; but Prospera Colonna, seeing the state\r\nhe was in, advanced to his bedside alone: he came, against expectation,\r\nto offer him an escort, fearing an ambuscade on the part of Fabio\r\nOrsino, who had loudly sworn that he would lose his honour or avenge the\r\ndeath of Paolo Orsina, his father. Caesar thanked Colanna, and replied\r\nthat from the moment that Orsini stood alone he ceased to fear him. Then\r\nColonna saluted the duke, and rejoined his men, directing them towards\r\nAlbano, while Caesar took the road to Citta Castellana, which had\r\nremained loyal.\r\n\r\nWhen there, Caesar found himself not only master of his own fate but of\r\nothers as well: of the twenty-two votes he owned in the Sacred College\r\ntwelve had remained faithful, and as the Conclave was composed in all of\r\nthirty-seven cardinals, he with his twelve votes could make the majority\r\nincline to whichever side he chose. Accordingly he was courted both by\r\nthe Spanish and the French party, each desiring the election of a pope\r\nof their own nation. Caesar listened, promising nothing and refusing\r\nnothing: he gave his twelve votes to Francesco Piccolomini, Cardinal of\r\nSiena, one of his father’s creatures who had remained his friend, and\r\nthe latter was elected on the 8th of October and took the name of Pius\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nCaesar’s hopes did not deceive him: Pius III was hardly elected before\r\nhe sent him a safe-conduct to Rome: the duke came back with 250\r\nmen-at-arms, 250 light horse, and 800 infantry, and lodged in his\r\npalace, the soldiers camping round about.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Orsini, pursuing their projects of vengeance against\r\nCaesar, had been levying many troops at Perugia and the neighbourhood to\r\nbring against him to Rome, and as they fancied that France, in whose\r\nservice they were engaged, was humouring the duke for the sake of the\r\ntwelve votes which were wanted to secure the election of Cardinal\r\nAmboise at the next Conclave, they went over to the service of Spain.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Caesar was signing a new treaty with Louis XII, by which he\r\nengaged to support him with all his forces, and even with his person, so\r\nsoon as he could ride, in maintaining his conquest of Naples: Louis, on\r\nhis side, guaranteed that he should retain possession of the States he\r\nstill held, and promised his help in recovering those he had lost.\r\n\r\nThe day when this treaty was made known, Gonzalvo di Cordovo proclaimed\r\nto the sound of a trumpet in all the streets of Rome that every Spanish\r\nsubject serving in a foreign army was at once to break his engagement on\r\npain of being found guilty of high treason.\r\n\r\nThis measure robbed Caesar of ten or twelve of his best officers and of\r\nnearly 300 men.\r\n\r\nThen the Orsini, seeing his army thus reduced, entered Rome, supported\r\nby the Spanish ambassador, and summoned Caesar to appear before the pope\r\nand the Sacred College and give an account of his crimes.\r\n\r\nFaithful to his engagements, Pius III replied that in his quality of\r\nsovereign prince the duke in his temporal administration was quite\r\nindependent and was answerable for his actions to God alone.\r\n\r\nBut as the pope felt he could not much longer support Caesar against his\r\nenemies for all his goodwill, he advised him to try to join the French\r\narmy, which was still advancing on Naples, in the midst of which he\r\nwould alone find safety. Caesar resolved to retire to Bracciano, where\r\nGian Giordano Orsino, who had once gone with him to France, and who was\r\nthe only member of the family who had not declared against him, offered\r\nhim an asylum in the name of Cardinal dumbest: so one morning he ordered\r\nhis troops to march for this town, and, taking his place in their midst,\r\nhe left Rome.\r\n\r\nBut though Caesar had kept his intentions quiet, the Orsini had been\r\nforewarned, and, taking out all the troops they had by the gate of San\r\nPancracio, they had made along detour and blocked Caesar’s way; so, when\r\nthe latter arrived at Storta, he found the Orsini’s army drawn up\r\nawaiting him in numbers exceeding his own by at least one-half.\r\n\r\nCaesar saw that to come to blows in his then feeble state was to rush on\r\ncertain destruction; so he ordered his troops to retire, and, being a\r\nfirst-rate strategist, echelonned his retreat so skilfully that his\r\nenemies, though they followed, dared not attack him, and he re-entered\r\nthe pontifical town without the loss of a single man.\r\n\r\nThis time Caesar went straight to the Vatican, to put himself more\r\ndirectly under the pope’s protection; he distributed his soldiers about\r\nthe palace, so as to guard all its exits. Now the Orsini, resolved to\r\nmake an end of Caesar, had determined to attack him wheresoever he might\r\nbe, with no regard to the sanctity of the place: this they attempted,\r\nbut without success, as Caesar’s men kept a good guard on every side,\r\nand offered a strong defence.\r\n\r\nThen the Orsini, not being able to force the guard of the Castle Sant’\r\nAngelo, hoped to succeed better with the duke by leaving Rome and then\r\nreturning by the Torione gate; but Caesar anticipated this move, and\r\nthey found the gate guarded and barricaded. None the less, they pursued\r\ntheir design, seeking by open violence the vengeance that they had hoped\r\nto obtain by craft; and, having surprised the approaches to the gate,\r\nset fire to it: a passage gained, they made their way into the gardens\r\nof the castle, where they found Caesar awaiting them at the head of his\r\ncavalry.\r\n\r\nFace to face with danger, the duke had found his old strength: and he\r\nwas the first to rush upon his enemies, loudly challenging Orsino in the\r\nhope of killing him should they meet; but either Orsino did not hear him\r\nor dared not fight; and after an exciting contest, Caesar, who was\r\nnumerically two-thirds weaker than his enemy, saw his cavalry cut to\r\npieces; and after performing miracles of personal strength and courage,\r\nwas obliged to return to the Vatican. There he found the pope in mortal\r\nagony: the Orsini, tired of contending against the old man’s word of\r\nhonour pledged to the duke, had by the interposition of Pandolfo\r\nPetrucci, gained the ear of the pope’s surgeon, who placed a poisoned\r\nplaster upon a wound in his leg.\r\n\r\nThe pope then was actually dying when Caesar, covered with dust and\r\nblood, entered his room, pursued by his enemies, who knew no check till\r\nthey reached the palace walls, behind which the remnant of his army\r\nstill held their ground.\r\n\r\nPius III, who knew he was about to die, sat up in his bed, gave Caesar\r\nthe key of the corridor which led to the Castle of Sant’ Angelo, and an\r\norder addressed to the governor to admit him and his family, to defend\r\nhim to the last extremity, and to let him go wherever he thought fit;\r\nand then fell fainting on his bed.\r\n\r\nCaesar took his two daughters by the hand, and, followed by the little\r\ndukes of Sermaneta and Nepi, took refuge in the last asylum open to him.\r\n\r\nThe same night the pope died: he had reigned only twenty-six days.\r\n\r\nAfter his death, Caesar, who had cast himself fully dressed upon his\r\nbed, heard his door open at two o’clock in the morning: not knowing what\r\nanyone might want of him at such an hour, he raised himself on one elbow\r\nand felt for the handle of his sword with his other hand; but at the\r\nfirst glance he recognised in his nocturnal visitor Giuliano della\r\nRovere.\r\n\r\nUtterly exhausted by the poison, abandoned by his troops, fallen as he\r\nwas from the height of his power, Caesar, who could now do nothing for\r\nhimself, could yet make a pope: Giuliano delta Rovere had come to buy\r\nthe votes of his twelve cardinals.\r\n\r\nCaesar imposed his conditions, which were accepted.\r\n\r\nIf elected, Giuliano della Rovere was to help Caesar to recover his\r\nterritories in Romagna; Caesar was to remain general of the Church; and\r\nFrancesco Maria delta Rovere, prefect of Rome, was to marry one of\r\nCaesar’s daughters.\r\n\r\nOn these conditions Caesar sold his twelve cardinals to Giuliano.\r\n\r\nThe next day, at Giuliano’s request, the Sacred College ordered the\r\nOrsini to leave Rome for the whole time occupied by the Conclave.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of October 1503, at the first scrutiny, Giuliano delta\r\nRovere was elected pope, and took the name of Julius II.\r\n\r\nHe was scarcely installed in the Vatican when he made it his first care\r\nto summon Caesar and give him his former rooms there; then, since the\r\nduke was fully restored to health, he began to busy himself with the\r\nre-establishment of his affairs, which had suffered sadly of late.\r\n\r\nThe defeat of his army and his own escape to Sant’ Angelo, where he was\r\nsupposed to be a prisoner, had brought about great changes in Romagna.\r\nSesena was once more in the power of the Church, as formerly it had\r\nbeen; Gian Sforza had again entered Pesaro; Ordelafi had seized Forli;\r\nMalatesta was laying claim to Rimini; the inhabitants of Imola had\r\nassassinated their governor, and the town was divided between two\r\nopinions, one that it should be put into the hands of the Riani, the\r\nother, into the hands of the Church; Faenza had remained loyal longer\r\nthan any other place; but at last, losing hope of seeing Caesar recover\r\nhis power, it had summoned Francesco, a natural son of Galeotto\r\nManfredi, the last surviving heir of this unhappy family, all whose\r\nlegitimate descendants had been massacred by Borgia.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the fortresses of these different places had taken no\r\npart in these revolutions, and had remained immutably faithful to the\r\nDuke of Valentinois.\r\n\r\nSo it was not precisely the defection of these towns, which, thanks to\r\ntheir fortresses, might be reconquered, that was the cause of uneasiness\r\nto Caesar and Julius II, it was the difficult situation that Venice had\r\nthrust upon them. Venice, in the spring of the same year, had signed a\r\ntreaty of peace with the Turks: thus set free from her eternal enemy,\r\nshe had just led her forces to the Romagna, which she had always\r\ncoveted: these troops had been led towards Ravenna, the farthermost\r\nlimit of the Papal estates, and put under the command of Giacopo\r\nVenieri, who had failed to capture Cesena, and had only failed through\r\nthe courage of its inhabitants; but this check had been amply\r\ncompensated by the surrender of the fortresses of Val di Lamane and\r\nFaenza, by the capture of Farlimpopoli, and the surrender of Rimini,\r\nwhich Pandolfo Malatesta, its lord, exchanged for the seigniory of\r\nCittadella, in the State of Padua, and for the rank of gentleman of\r\nVenice.\r\n\r\nThen Caesar made a proposition to Julius II: this was to make a\r\nmomentary cession to the Church of his own estates in Romagna, so that\r\nthe respect felt by the Venetians for the Church might save these towns\r\nfrom their aggressors; but, says Guicciardini, Julius II, whose\r\nambition, so natural in sovereign rulers, had not yet extinguished the\r\nremains of rectitude, refused to accept the places, afraid of exposing\r\nhimself to the temptation of keeping them later on, against his\r\npromises.\r\n\r\nBut as the case was urgent, he proposed to Caesar that he should leave\r\nRome, embark at Ostia, and cross over to Spezia, where Michelotto was to\r\nmeet him at the head of 100 men-at-arms and 100 light horse, the only\r\nremnant of his magnificent army, thence by land to Ferrara, and from\r\nFerrara to Imola, where, once arrived, he could utter his war-cry so\r\nloud that it would be heard through the length and breadth of Romagna.\r\n\r\nThis advice being after Caesar’s own heart, he accepted it at once.\r\n\r\nThe resolution submitted to the Sacred College was approved, and Caesar\r\nleft for Ostia, accompanied by Bartolommeo della Rovere, nephew of His\r\nHoliness.\r\n\r\nCaesar at last felt he was free, and fancied himself already on his good\r\ncharger, a second time carrying war into all the places where he had\r\nformerly fought. When he reached Ostia, he was met by the cardinals of\r\nSorrento and Volterra, who came in the name of Julius II to ask him to\r\ngive up the very same citadels which he had refused three days before:\r\nthe fact was that the pope had learned in the interim that the Venetians\r\nhad made fresh aggressions, and recognised that the method proposed by\r\nCaesar was the only one that would check them. But this time it was\r\nCaesar’s turn, to refuse, for he was weary of these tergiversations, and\r\nfeared a trap; so he said that the surrender asked for would be useless,\r\nsince by God’s help he should be in Romagna before eight days were past.\r\nSo the cardinals of Sorrento and Volterra returned to Rome with a\r\nrefusal.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, just as Caesar was setting foot on his vessel, he was\r\narrested in the name of Julius II.\r\n\r\nHe thought at first that this was the end; he was used to this mode of\r\naction, and knew how short was the space between a prison and a tomb;\r\nthe matter was all the easier in his case, because the pope, if he\r\nchose, would have plenty of pretext for making a case against him. But\r\nthe heart of Julius was of another kind from his; swift to anger, but\r\nopen to clemency; so, when the duke came back to Rome guarded, the\r\nmomentary irritation his refusal had caused was already calmed, and the\r\npope received him in his usual fashion at his palace, and with his\r\nordinary courtesy, although from the beginning it was easy for the duke\r\nto see that he was being watched. In return for this kind reception,\r\nCaesar consented to yield the fortress of Cesena to the pope, as being a\r\ntown which had once belonged to the Church, and now should return;\r\ngiving the deed, signed by Caesar, to one of his captains, called Pietro\r\nd’Oviedo, he ordered him to take possession of the fortress in the name\r\nof the Holy See. Pietro obeyed, and starting at once for Cesena,\r\npresented himself armed with his warrant before Don Diego Chinon; a\r\nnoble condottiere of Spain, who was holding the fortress in Caesar’s\r\nname. But when he had read over the paper that Pietro d’Oviedo brought,\r\nDon Diego replied that as he knew his lord and master was a prisoner, it\r\nwould be disgraceful in him to obey an order that had probably been\r\nwrested from him by violence, and that the bearer deserved to die for\r\nundertaking such a cowardly office. He therefore bade his soldiers seize\r\nd’Oviedo and fling him down from the top of the walls: this sentence was\r\npromptly executed.\r\n\r\nThis mark of fidelity might have proved fatal to Caesar: when the pope\r\nheard how his messenger had been treated, he flew into such a rage that\r\nthe prisoner thought a second time that his hour was come; and in order\r\nto receive his liberty, he made the first of those new propositions to\r\nJulius II, which were drawn up in the form of a treaty and sanctioned by\r\na bull. By these arrangements, the Duke of Valentinois was bound to hand\r\nover to His Holiness, within the space of forty days, the fortresses of\r\nCesena and Bertinoro, and authorise the surrender of Forli. This\r\narrangement was guaranteed by two bankers in Rome who were to be\r\nresponsible for 15,000 ducats, the sum total of the expenses which the\r\ngovernor pretended he had incurred in the place on the duke’s account.\r\nThe pope on his part engaged to send Caesar to Ostia under the sole\r\nguard of the Cardinal of Santa Croce and two officers, who were to give\r\nhim his full liberty on the very day when his engagements were\r\nfulfilled: should this not happen, Caesar was to be taken to Rome and\r\nimprisoned in the Castle of Sant’ Angelo. In fulfilment of this treaty,\r\nCaesar went down the Tiber as far as Ostia, accompanied by the pope’s\r\ntreasurer and many of his servants. The Cardinal of Santa Croce\r\nfollowed, and the next day joined him there.\r\n\r\nBut as Caesar feared that Julius II might keep him a prisoner, in spite\r\nof his pledged word, after he had yielded up the fortresses, he asked,\r\nthrough the mediation of Cardinals Borgia and Remolina, who, not feeling\r\nsafe at Rome, had retired to Naples, for a safe-conduct to Gonzalva of\r\nCordova, and for two ships to take him there; with the return of the\r\ncourier the safe-conduct arrived, announcing that the ships would\r\nshortly follow.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all this, the Cardinal of Santa Croce, learning that by\r\nthe duke’s orders the governors of Cesena and Bertinoro had surrendered\r\ntheir fortresses to the captains of His Holiness, relaxed his rigour,\r\nand knowing that his prisoner would some day or other be free, began to\r\nlet him go out without a guard. Then Caesar, feeling some fear lest when\r\nhe started with Gonzalvo’s ships the same thing might happen as on the\r\noccasion of his embarking on the pope’s vessel—that is, that he might be\r\narrested a second time—concealed himself in a house outside the town;\r\nand when night came on, mounting a wretched horse that belonged to a\r\npeasant, rode as far as Nettuno, and there hired a little boat, in which\r\nhe embarked for Monte Dragone, and thence gained Naples. Gonzalvo\r\nreceived him with such joy that Caesar was deceived as to his intention,\r\nand this time believed that he was really saved. His confidence was\r\nredoubled when, opening his designs to Gonzalvo, and telling him that he\r\ncounted upon gaining Pisa and thence going on into Romagna, Ganzalva\r\nallowed him to recruit as many soldiers at Naples as he pleased,\r\npromising him two ships to embark with. Caesar, deceived by these\r\nappearances, stopped nearly six weeks at Naples, every day seeing the\r\nSpanish governor and discussing his plans. But Gonzalvo was only waiting\r\nto gain time to tell the King of Spain that his enemy was in his hands;\r\nand Caesar actually went to the castle to bid Gonzalvo good-bye,\r\nthinking he was just about to start after he had embarked his men on the\r\ntwo ships. The Spanish governor received him with his accustomed\r\ncourtesy, wished him every kind of prosperity, and embraced him as he\r\nleft; but at the door of the castle Caesar found one of Gonzalvo’s\r\ncaptains, Nuno Campeja by name, who arrested him as a prisoner of\r\nFerdinand the Catholic. Caesar at these words heaved a deep sigh,\r\ncursing the ill luck that had made him trust the word of an enemy when\r\nhe had so often broken his own.\r\n\r\nHe was at once taken to the castle, where the prison gate closed behind\r\nhim, and he felt no hope that anyone would come to his aid; for the only\r\nbeing who was devoted to him in this world was Michelotto, and he had\r\nheard that Michelotto had been arrested near Pisa by order of Julius II.\r\nWhile Caesar was being taken to prison an officer came to him to deprive\r\nhim of the safe-conduct given him by Gonzalvo.\r\n\r\nThe day after his arrest, which occurred on the 27th of May, 1504,\r\nCaesar was taken on board a ship, which at once weighed anchor and set\r\nsail for Spain: during the whole voyage he had but one page to serve\r\nhim, and as soon as he disembarked he was taken to the castle of Medina\r\ndel Campo.\r\n\r\nTen years later, Gonzalvo, who at that time was himself proscribed,\r\nowned to Loxa on his dying bed that now, when he was to appear in the\r\npresence of God, two things weighed cruelly on his conscience: one was\r\nhis treason to Ferdinand, the other his breach of faith towards Caesar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nCaesar was in prison for two years, always hoping that Louis XII would\r\nreclaim him as peer of the kingdom of France; but Louis, much disturbed\r\nby the loss of the battle of Garigliano, which robbed him of the kingdom\r\nof Naples, had enough to do with his own affairs without busying himself\r\nwith his cousin’s. So the prisoner was beginning to despair, when one\r\nday as he broke his bread at breakfast he found a file and a little\r\nbottle containing a narcotic, with a letter from Michelotto, saying that\r\nhe was out of prison and had left Italy for Spain, and now lay in hiding\r\nwith the Count of Benevento in the neighbouring village: he added that\r\nfrom the next day forward he and the count would wait every night on the\r\nroad between the fortress and the village with three excellent horses;\r\nit was now Caesar’s part to do the best he could with his bottle and\r\nfile. When the whole world had abandoned the Duke of Romagna he had been\r\nremembered by a sbirro.\r\n\r\nThe prison where he had been shut up for two years was so hateful to\r\nCaesar that he lost not a single moment: the same day he attacked one of\r\nthe bars of a window that looked out upon an inner court, and soon\r\ncontrived so to manipulate it that it would need only a final push to\r\ncome out. But not only was the window nearly seventy feet from the\r\nground, but one could only get out of the court by using an exit\r\nreserved for the governor, of which he alone had the key; also this key\r\nnever left him; by day it hung at his waist, by night it was under his\r\npillow: this then was the chief difficulty.\r\n\r\nBut prisoner though he was, Caesar had always been treated with the\r\nrespect due to his name and rank: every day at the dinner-hour he was\r\nconducted from the room that served as his prison to the governor, who\r\ndid the honours of the table in a grand and courteous fashion. The fact\r\nwas that Don Manuel had served with honour under King Ferdinand, and\r\ntherefore, while he guarded Caesar rigorously, according to orders, he\r\nhad a great respect for so brave a general, and took pleasure in\r\nlistening to the accounts of his battles. So he had often insisted that\r\nCaesar should not only dine but also breakfast with him; happily the\r\nprisoner, yielding perhaps to some presentiment, had till now refused\r\nthis favour. This was of great advantage to him, since, thanks to his\r\nsolitude, he had been able to receive the instruments of escape sent by\r\nMichelotto. The same day he received them, Caesar, on going back to his\r\nroom, made a false step and sprained his foot; at the dinner-hour he\r\ntried to go down, but he pretended to be suffering so cruelly that he\r\ngave it up. The governor came to see him in his room, and found him\r\nstretched upon the bed.\r\n\r\nThe day after, he was no better; the governor had his dinner sent in,\r\nand came to see him, as on the night before; he found his prisoner so\r\ndejected and gloomy in his solitude that he offered to come and sup with\r\nhim: Caesar gratefully accepted.\r\n\r\nThis time it was the prisoner who did the honours: Caesar was charmingly\r\ncourteous; the governor thought he would profit by this lack of\r\nrestraint to put to him certain questions as to the manner of his\r\narrest, and asked him as an Old Castilian, for whom honour is still of\r\nsome account, what the truth really was as to Gonzalvo’s and Ferdinand’s\r\nbreach of faith, with him. Caesar appeared extremely inclined to give\r\nhim his entire confidence, but showed by a sign that the attendants were\r\nin the way. This precaution appeared quite natural, and the governor\r\ntook no offense, but hastened to send them all away, so as to be sooner\r\nalone with his companion. When the door was shut, Caesar filled his\r\nglass and the governor’s, proposing the king’s health: the governor\r\nhonoured the toast: Caesar at once began his tale; but he had scarcely\r\nuttered a third part of it when, interesting as it was, the eyes of his\r\nhost shut as though by magic, and he slid under the table in a profound\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nAfter half a hour had passed, the servants, hearing no noise, entered\r\nand found the two, one on the table, the other under it: this event was\r\nnot so extraordinary that they paid any great attention to it: all they\r\ndid was to carry Don Manuel to his room and lift Caesar on the bed; then\r\nthey put away the remnant of the meal for the next day’s supper, shut\r\nthe door very carefully, and left their prisoner alone.\r\n\r\nCaesar stayed for a minute motionless and apparently plunged in the\r\ndeepest sleep; but when he had heard the steps retreating, he quietly\r\nraised his head, opened his eyes, slipped off the bed, walked to the\r\ndoor, slowly indeed, but not to all appearance feeling the accident of\r\nthe night before, and applied his ear for some minutes to the keyhole;\r\nthen lifting his head with an expression of indescribable pride, he\r\nwiped his brow with his hand, and for the first time since his guards\r\nwent out, breathed freely with full-drawn breaths.\r\n\r\nThere was no time to lose: his first care was to shut the door as\r\nsecurely on the inside as it was already shut on the outside, to blow\r\nout the lamp, to open the window, and to finish sawing through the bar.\r\nWhen this was done, he undid the bandages on his leg, took down the\r\nwindow and bed curtains, tore them into strips, joined the sheets, table\r\nnapkins and cloth, and with all these things tied together end to end,\r\nformed a rope fifty or sixty feet long, with knots every here and there.\r\nThis rope he fixed securely to the bar next to the one he had just cut\r\nthrough; then he climbed up to the window and began what was really the\r\nhardest part of his perilous enterprise, clinging with hands and feet to\r\nthis fragile support. Luckily he was both strong and skilful, and he\r\nwent down the whole length of the rope without accident; but when he\r\nreached the end and was hanging on the last knot, he sought in vain to\r\ntouch the ground with his feet; his rope was too short.\r\n\r\nThe situation was a terrible one: the darkness of the night prevented\r\nthe fugitive from seeing how far off he was from the ground, and his\r\nfatigue prevented him from even attempting to climb up again. Caesar put\r\nup a brief prayer, whether to God or Satan he alone could say; then\r\nletting go the rope, he dropped from a height of twelve or fifteen feet.\r\n\r\nThe danger was too great for the fugitive to trouble about a few\r\ntrifling contusions: he at once rose, and guiding himself by the\r\ndirection of his window, he went straight to the little door of exit; he\r\nthen put his hand into the pocket of his doublet, and a cold sweat\r\ndamped his brow; either he had forgotten and left it in his room or had\r\nlost it in his fall; anyhow, he had not the key.\r\n\r\nBut summoning his recollections, he quite gave up the first idea for the\r\nsecond, which was the only likely one: again he crossed the court,\r\nlooking for the place where the key might have fallen, by the aid of the\r\nwall round a tank on which he had laid his hand when he got up; but the\r\nobject of search was so small and the night so dark that there was\r\nlittle chance of getting any result; still Caesar sought for it, for in\r\nthis key was his last hope: suddenly a door was opened, and a night\r\nwatch appeared, preceded by two torches. Caesar for the moment thought\r\nhe was lost, but remembering the tank behind him, he dropped into it,\r\nand with nothing but his head above water anxiously watched the\r\nmovements of the soldiers, as they advanced beside him, passed only a\r\nfew feet away, crossed the court, and then disappeared by an opposite\r\ndoor. But short as their luminous apparition had been, it had lighted up\r\nthe ground, and Caesar by the glare of the torches had caught the\r\nglitter of the long-sought key, and as soon as the door was shut behind\r\nthe men, was again master of his liberty.\r\n\r\nHalf-way between the castle and the village two cavaliers and a led\r\nhorse were waiting for him: the two men were Michelotto and the Count of\r\nBenevento. Caesar sprang upon the riderless horse, pressed with fervour\r\nthe hand of the count and the sbirro; then all three galloped to the\r\nfrontier of Navarre, where they arrived three days later, and were\r\nhonourably received by the king, Jean d’Albret, the brother of Caesar’s\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nFrom Navarre he thought to pass into France, and from France to make an\r\nattempt upon Italy, with the aid of Louis XII; but during Caesar’s\r\ndetention in the castle of Medina del Campo, Louis had made peace with\r\nthe King of Spain; and when he heard of Caesar’s flight; instead of\r\nhelping him, as there was some reason to expect he would, since he was a\r\nrelative by marriage, he took away the duchy of Valentinois and also his\r\npension. Still, Caesar had nearly 200,000 ducats in the charge of\r\nbankers at Genoa; he wrote asking for this sum, with which he hoped to\r\nlevy troops in Spain and in Navarre, and make an attempt upon Pisa: 500\r\nmen, 200,000 ducats, his name and his word were more than enough to save\r\nhim from despair.\r\n\r\nThe bankers denied the deposit.\r\n\r\nCaesar was at the mercy of his brother-in-law.\r\n\r\nOne of the vassals of the King of Navarre, named Prince Alarino, had\r\njust then revolted: Caesar then took command of the army which Jean\r\nd’Albret was sending out against him, followed by Michelotto, who was as\r\nfaithful in adversity as ever before. Thanks to Caesar’s courage and\r\nskilful tactics, Prince Alarino was beaten in a first encounter; but the\r\nday after his defeat he rallied his army, and offered battle about three\r\no’clock in the afternoon. Caesar accepted it.\r\n\r\nFor nearly four hours they fought obstinately on both sides; but at\r\nlength, as the day was going down, Caesar proposed to decide the issue\r\nby making a charge himself, at the head of a hundred men-at-arms, upon a\r\nbody of cavalry which made his adversary’s chief force. To his great\r\nastonishment, this cavalry at the first shock gave way and took flight\r\nin the direction of a little wood, where they seemed to be seeking\r\nrefuge. Caesar followed close on their heels up to the edge of the\r\nforest; then suddenly the pursued turned right about face, three or four\r\nhundred archers came out of the wood to help them, and Caesar’s men,\r\nseeing that they had fallen into an ambush, took to their heels like\r\ncowards, and abandoned their leader.\r\n\r\nLeft alone, Caesar would not budge one step; possibly he had had enough\r\nof life, and his heroism was rather the result of satiety than courage:\r\nhowever that may be, he defended himself like a lion; but, riddled with\r\narrows and bolts, his horse at last fell, with Caesar’s leg under him.\r\nHis adversaries rushed upon him, and one of them thrusting a sharp and\r\nslender iron pike through a weak place in his armour, pierced his\r\nbreast; Caesar cursed God and died.\r\n\r\nBut the rest of the enemy’s army was defeated, thanks to the courage of\r\nMichelotto, who fought like a valiant condottiere, but learned, on\r\nreturning to the camp in the evening, from those who had fled; that they\r\nhad abandoned Caesar and that he had never reappeared. Then only too\r\ncertain, from his master’s well-known courage, that disaster had\r\noccurred, he desired to give one last proof of his devotion by not\r\nleaving his body to the wolves and birds of prey. Torches were lighted,\r\nfor it was dark, and with ten or twelve of those who had gone with\r\nCaesar as far as the little wood, he went to seek his master. On\r\nreaching the spot they pointed out, he beheld five men stretched side by\r\nside; four of them were dressed, but the fifth had been stripped of his\r\nclothing and lay completely naked. Michelotto dismounted, lifted the\r\nhead upon his knees, and by the light of the torches recognised Caesar.\r\n\r\nThus fell, on the 10th of March, 1507, on an unknown field, near an\r\nobscure village called Viane, in a wretched skirmish with the vassal of\r\na petty king, the man whom Macchiavelli presents to all princes as the\r\nmodel of ability, diplomacy, and courage.\r\n\r\nAs to Lucrezia, the fair Duchess of Ferrara, she died full of years, and\r\nhonours, adored as a queen by her subjects, and sung as a goddess by\r\nAriosto and by Bembo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once in Paris, says Boccaccio, a brave and good merchant named\r\nJean de Civigny, who did a great trade in drapery, and was connected in\r\nbusiness with a neighbour and fellow-merchant, a very rich man called\r\nAbraham, who, though a Jew, enjoyed a good reputation. Jean de Civigny,\r\nappreciating the qualities of the worthy Israelite; feared lest, good\r\nman as he was, his false religion would bring his soul straight to\r\neternal perdition; so he began to urge him gently as a friend to\r\nrenounce his errors and open his eyes to the Christian faith, which he\r\ncould see for himself was prospering and spreading day by day, being the\r\nonly true and good religion; whereas his own creed, it was very plain,\r\nwas so quickly diminishing that it would soon disappear from the face of\r\nthe earth. The Jew replied that except in his own religion there was no\r\nsalvation, that he was born in it, proposed to live and die in it, and\r\nthat he knew nothing in the world that could change his opinion. Still,\r\nin his proselytising fervour Jean would not think himself beaten, and\r\nnever a day passed but he demonstrated with those fair words the\r\nmerchant uses to seduce a customer, the superiority of the Christian\r\nreligion above the Jewish; and although Abraham was a great master of\r\nMosaic law, he began to enjoy his friend’s preaching, either because of\r\nthe friendship he felt for him or because the Holy Ghost descended upon\r\nthe tongue of the new apostle; still obstinate in his own belief, he\r\nwould not change. The more he persisted in his error, the more excited\r\nwas Jean about converting him, so that at last, by God’s help, being\r\nsomewhat shaken by his friend’s urgency, Abraham one day said—\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Jean: since you have it so much at heart that I should be\r\nconverted, behold me disposed to satisfy you; but before I go to Rome to\r\nsee him whom you call God’s vicar on earth, I must study his manner of\r\nlife and his morals, as also those of his brethren the cardinals; and\r\nif, as I doubt not, they are in harmony with what you preach, I will\r\nadmit that, as you have taken such pains to show me, your faith is\r\nbetter than mine, and I will do as you desire; but if it should prove\r\notherwise, I shall remain a Jew, as I was before; for it is not worth\r\nwhile, at my age, to change my belief for a worse one.\"\r\n\r\nJean was very sad when he heard these words; and he said mournfully to\r\nhimself, \"Now I have lost my time and pains, which I thought I had spent\r\nso well when I was hoping to convert this unhappy Abraham; for if he\r\nunfortunately goes, as he says he will, to the court of Rome, and there\r\nsees the shameful life led by the servants of the Church, instead of\r\nbecoming a Christian the Jew will be more of a Jew than ever.\" Then\r\nturning to Abraham, he said, \"Ah, friend, why do you wish to incur such\r\nfatigue and expense by going to Rome, besides the fact that travelling\r\nby sea or by land must be very dangerous for so rich a man as you are?\r\nDo you suppose there is no one here to baptize you? If you have any\r\ndoubts concerning the faith I have expounded, where better than here\r\nwill you find theologians capable of contending with them and allaying\r\nthem? So, you see, this voyage seems to me quite unnecessary: just\r\nimagine that the priests there are such as you see here, and all the\r\nbetter in that they are nearer to the supreme pastor. If you are guided\r\nby my advice, you will postpone this toil till you have committed some\r\ngrave sin and need absolution; then you and I will go together.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Jew replied—\r\n\r\n\"I believe, dear Jean, that everything is as you tell me; but you know\r\nhow obstinate I am. I will go to Rome, or I will never be a Christian.\"\r\n\r\nThen Jean, seeing his great wish, resolved that it was no use trying to\r\nthwart him, and wished him good luck; but in his heart he gave up all\r\nhope; for it was certain that his friend would come back from his\r\npilgrimage more of a Jew than ever, if the court of Rome was still as he\r\nhad seen it.\r\n\r\nBut Abraham mounted his horse, and at his best speed took the road to\r\nRome, where on his arrival he was wonderfully well received by his\r\ncoreligionists; and after staying there a good long time, he began to\r\nstudy the behaviour of the pope, the cardinals and other prelates, and\r\nof the whole court. But much to his surprise he found out, partly by\r\nwhat passed under his eyes and partly by what he was told, that all from\r\nthe pope downward to the lowest sacristan of St. Peter’s were committing\r\nthe sins of luxurious living in a most disgraceful and unbridled manner,\r\nwith no remorse and no shame, so that pretty women and handsome youths\r\ncould obtain any favours they pleased. In addition to this sensuality\r\nwhich they exhibited in public, he saw that they were gluttons and\r\ndrunkards, so much so that they were more the slaves of the belly than\r\nare the greediest of animals. When he looked a little further, he found\r\nthem so avaricious and fond of money that they sold for hard cash both\r\nhuman bodies and divine offices, and with less conscience than a man in\r\nParis would sell cloth or any other merchandise. Seeing this and much\r\nmore that it would not be proper to set down here, it seemed to Abraham,\r\nhimself a chaste, sober, and upright man, that he had seen enough. So he\r\nresolved to return to Paris, and carried out the resolution with his\r\nusual promptitude. Jean de Civigny held a great fete in honour of his\r\nreturn, although he had lost hope of his coming back converted. But he\r\nleft time for him to settle down before he spoke of anything, thinking\r\nthere would be plenty of time to hear the bad news he expected. But,\r\nafter a few days of rest, Abraham himself came to see his friend, and\r\nJean ventured to ask what he thought of the Holy Father, the cardinals,\r\nand the other persons at the pontifical court. At these words the Jew\r\nexclaimed, \"God damn them all! I never once succeeded in finding among\r\nthem any holiness, any devotion, any good works; but, on the contrary,\r\nluxurious living, avarice, greed, fraud, envy, pride, and even worse, if\r\nthere is worse; all the machine seemed to be set in motion by an impulse\r\nless divine than diabolical. After what I saw, it is my firm conviction\r\nthat your pope, and of course the others as well, are using all their\r\ntalents, art, endeavours, to banish the Christian religion from the face\r\nof the earth, though they ought to be its foundation and support; and\r\nsince, in spite of all the care and trouble they expend to arrive at\r\nthis end, I see that your religion is spreading every day and becoming\r\nmore brilliant and more pure, it is borne in upon me that the Holy\r\nSpirit Himself protects it as the only true and the most holy religion;\r\nthis is why, deaf as you found me to your counsel and rebellious to your\r\nwish, I am now, ever since I returned from this Sodom, firmly resolved\r\non becoming a Christian. So let us go at once to the church, for I am\r\nquite ready to be baptized.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no need to say if Jean de Civigny, who expected a refusal, was\r\npleased at this consent. Without delay he went with his godson to Notre\r\nDame de Paris, where he prayed the first priest he met to administer\r\nbaptism to his friend, and this was speedily done; and the new convert\r\nchanged his Jewish name of Abraham into the Christian name of Jean; and\r\nas the neophyte, thanks to his journey to Rome, had gained a profound\r\nbelief, his natural good qualities increased so greatly in the practice\r\nof our holy religion, that after leading an exemplary life he died in\r\nthe full odour of sanctity.\r\n\r\nThis tale of Boccaccio’s gives so admirable an answer to the charge of\r\nirreligion which some might make against us if they mistook our\r\nintentions, that as we shall not offer any other reply, we have not\r\nhesitated to present it entire as it stands to the eyes of our readers.\r\n\r\nAnd let us never forget that if the papacy has had an Innocent VIII and\r\nan Alexander VI who are its shame, it has also had a Pius VII and a\r\nGregory XVI who are its honour and glory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*THE CENCI—1598*\r\n\r\n\r\nShould you ever go to Rome and visit the villa Pamphili, no doubt, after\r\nhaving sought under its tall pines and along its canals the shade and\r\nfreshness so rare in the capital of the Christian world, you will\r\ndescend towards the Janiculum Hill by a charming road, in the middle of\r\nwhich you will find the Pauline fountain. Having passed this monument,\r\nand having lingered a moment on the terrace of the church of St. Peter\r\nMontorio, which commands the whole of Rome, you will visit the cloister\r\nof Bramante, in the middle of which, sunk a few feet below the level, is\r\nbuilt, on the identical place where St. Peter was crucified, a little\r\ntemple, half Greek, half Christian; you will thence ascend by a side\r\ndoor into the church itself. There, the attentive cicerone will show\r\nyou, in the first chapel to the right, the Christ Scourged, by Sebastian\r\ndel Piombo, and in the third chapel to the left, an Entombment by\r\nFiammingo; having examined these two masterpieces at leisure, he will\r\ntake you to each end of the transverse cross, and will show you—on one\r\nside a picture by Salviati, on slate, and on the other a work by Vasari;\r\nthen, pointing out in melancholy tones a copy of Guido’s Martyrdom of\r\nSt. Peter on the high altar, he will relate to you how for three\r\ncenturies the divine Raffaelle’s Transfiguration was worshipped in that\r\nspot; how it was carried away by the French in 1809, and restored to the\r\npope by the Allies in 1814. As you have already in all probability\r\nadmired this masterpiece in the Vatican, allow him to expatiate, and\r\nsearch at the foot of the altar for a mortuary slab, which you will\r\nidentify by a cross and the single word; Orate; under this gravestone is\r\nburied Beatrice Cenci, whose tragical story cannot but impress you\r\nprofoundly.\r\n\r\nShe was the daughter of Francesco Cenci. Whether or not it be true that\r\nmen are born in harmony with their epoch, and that some embody its good\r\nqualities and others its bad ones, it may nevertheless interest our\r\nreaders to cast a rapid glance over the period which had just passed\r\nwhen the events which we are about to relate took place. Francesco Cenci\r\nwill then appear to them as the diabolical incarnation of his time.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of August, 1492, after the lingering death-agony of Innocent\r\nVIII, during which two hundred and twenty murders were committed in the\r\nstreets of Rome, Alexander VI ascended the pontifical throne. Son of a\r\nsister of Pope Calixtus III, Roderigo Lenzuoli Borgia, before being\r\ncreated cardinal, had five children by Rosa Vanozza, whom he afterwards\r\ncaused to be married to a rich Roman. These children were:\r\n\r\nFrancis, Duke of Gandia;\r\n\r\nCaesar, bishop and cardinal, afterwards Duke of Valentinois;\r\n\r\nLucrezia, who was married four times: her first husband was Giovanni\r\nSforza, lord of Pesaro, whom she left owing to his impotence; the\r\nsecond, Alfonso, Duke of Bisiglia, whom her brother Caesar caused to be\r\nassassinated; the third, Alfonso d’Este, Duke of Ferrara, from whom a\r\nsecond divorce separated her; finally, the fourth, Alfonso of Aragon,\r\nwho was stabbed to death on the steps of the basilica of St. Peter, and\r\nafterwards, three weeks later, strangled, because he did not die soon\r\nenough from his wounds, which nevertheless were mortal;\r\n\r\nGiofre, Count of Squillace, of whom little is known;\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, a youngest son, of whom nothing at all is known.\r\n\r\nThe most famous of these three brothers was Caesar Borgia. He had made\r\nevery arrangement a plotter could make to be King of Italy at the death\r\nof his father the pope, and his measures were so carefully taken as to\r\nleave no doubt in his own mind as to the success of this vast project.\r\nEvery chance was provided against, except one; but Satan himself could\r\nhardly have foreseen this particular one. The reader will judge for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe pope had invited Cardinal Adrien to supper in his vineyard on the\r\nBelvidere; Cardinal Adrien was very rich, and the pope wished to inherit\r\nhis wealth, as he already had acquired that of the Cardinals of Sant’\r\nAngelo, Capua, and Modena. To effect this, Caesar Borgia sent two\r\nbottles of poisoned wine to his father’s cup-bearer, without taking him\r\ninto his confidence; he only instructed him not to serve this wine till\r\nhe himself gave orders to do so; unfortunately, during supper the\r\ncup-bearer left his post for a moment, and in this interval a careless\r\nbutler served the poisoned wine to the pope, to Caesar Borgia, and to\r\nCardinal Corneto.\r\n\r\nAlexander VI died some hours afterwards; Caesar Borgia was confined to\r\nbed, and sloughed off his skin; while Cardinal Corneto lost his sight\r\nand his senses, and was brought to death’s door.\r\n\r\nPius III succeeded Alexander VI, and reigned twenty-five days; on the\r\ntwenty-sixth he was poisoned also.\r\n\r\nCaesar Borgia had under his control eighteen Spanish cardinals who owed\r\nto him their places in the Sacred College; these cardinals were entirely\r\nhis creatures, and he could command them absolutely. As he was in a\r\nmoribund condition and could make no use of them for himself, he sold\r\nthem to Giuliano della Rovere, and Giuliano della Rovere was elected\r\npope, under the name of Julius II. To the Rome of Nero succeeded the\r\nAthens of Pericles.\r\n\r\nLeo X succeeded Julius II, and under his pontificate Christianity\r\nassumed a pagan character, which, passing from art into manners, gives\r\nto this epoch a strange complexion. Crimes for the moment disappeared,\r\nto give place to vices; but to charming vices, vices in good taste, such\r\nas those indulged in by Alcibiades and sung by Catullus. Leo X died\r\nafter having assembled under his reign, which lasted eight years, eight\r\nmonths, and nineteen days, Michael Angelo, Raffaelle, Leonardo da Vinci,\r\nCorreggio, Titian, Andrea del Sarto, Fra Bartolommeo, Giulio Romano,\r\nAriosto, Guicciardini, and Macchiavelli.\r\n\r\nGiulio di Medici and Pompeo Colonna had equal claims to succeed him. As\r\nboth were skilful politicians, experienced courtiers, and moreover of\r\nreal and almost equal merit, neither of them could obtain a majority,\r\nand the Conclave was prolonged almost indefinitely, to the great fatigue\r\nof the cardinals. So it happened one day that a cardinal, more tired\r\nthan the rest, proposed to elect, instead of either Medici or Colonna,\r\nthe son, some say of a weaver, others of a brewer of Utrecht, of whom no\r\none had ever thought till then, and who was for the moment acting head\r\nof affairs in Spain, in the absence of Charles the Fifth. The jest\r\nprospered in the ears of those who heard it; all the cardinals approved\r\ntheir colleague’s proposal, and Adrien became pope by a mere accident.\r\n\r\nHe was a perfect specimen of the Flemish type a regular Dutchman, and\r\ncould not speak a word of Italian. When he arrived in Rome, and saw the\r\nGreek masterpieces of sculpture collected at vast cost by Leo X, he\r\nwished to break them to pieces, exclaiming, \"Suet idola anticorum.\" His\r\nfirst act was to despatch a papal nuncio, Francesco Cherigato, to the\r\nDiet of Nuremberg, convened to discuss the reforms of Luther, with\r\ninstructions which give a vivid notion of the manners of the time.\r\n\r\n\"Candidly confess,\" said he, \"that God has permitted this schism and\r\nthis persecution on account of the sins of man, and especially those of\r\npriests and prelates of the Church; for we know that many abominable\r\nthings have taken place in the Holy See.\"\r\n\r\nAdrien wished to bring the Romans back to the simple and austere manners\r\nof the early Church, and with this object pushed reform to the minutest\r\ndetails. For instance, of the hundred grooms maintained by Leo X, he\r\nretained only a dozen, in order, he said, to have two more than the\r\ncardinals.\r\n\r\nA pope like this could not reign long: he died after a year’s\r\npontificate. The morning after his death his physician’s door was found\r\ndecorated with garlands of flowers, bearing this inscription: \"To the\r\nliberator of his country.\"\r\n\r\nGiulio di Medici and Pompeo Colonna were again rival candidates.\r\nIntrigues recommenced, and the Conclave was once more so divided that at\r\none time the cardinals thought they could only escape the difficulty in\r\nwhich they were placed by doing what they had done before, and electing\r\na third competitor; they were even talking about Cardinal Orsini, when\r\nGiulio di Medici, one of the rival candidates, hit upon a very ingenious\r\nexpedient. He wanted only five votes; five of his partisans each offered\r\nto bet five of Colonna’s a hundred thousand ducats to ten thousand\r\nagainst the election of Giulio di Medici. At the very first ballot after\r\nthe wager, Giulio di Medici got the five votes he wanted; no objection\r\ncould be made, the cardinals had not been bribed; they had made a bet,\r\nthat was all.\r\n\r\nThus it happened, on the 18th of November, 1523, Giulio di Medici was\r\nproclaimed pope under the name of Clement VII. The same day, he\r\ngenerously paid the five hundred thousand ducats which his five\r\npartisans had lost.\r\n\r\nIt was under this pontificate, and during the seven months in which\r\nRome, conquered by the Lutheran soldiers of the Constable of Bourbon,\r\nsaw holy things subjected to the most frightful profanations, that\r\nFrancesco Cenci was born.\r\n\r\nHe was the son of Monsignor Nicolo Cenci, afterwards apostolic treasurer\r\nduring the pontificate of Pius V. Under this venerable prelate, who\r\noccupied himself much more with the spiritual than the temporal\r\nadministration of his kingdom, Nicolo Cenci took advantage of his\r\nspiritual head’s abstraction of worldly matters to amass a net revenue\r\nof a hundred and sixty thousand piastres, about f32,000 of our money.\r\nFrancesco Cenci, who was his only son, inherited this fortune.\r\n\r\nHis youth was spent under popes so occupied with the schism of Luther\r\nthat they had no time to think of anything else. The result was, that\r\nFrancesco Cenci, inheriting vicious instincts and master of an immense\r\nfortune which enabled him to purchase immunity, abandoned himself to all\r\nthe evil passions of his fiery and passionate temperament. Five times\r\nduring his profligate career imprisoned for abominable crimes, he only\r\nsucceeded in procuring his liberation by the payment of two hundred\r\nthousand piastres, or about one million francs. It should be explained\r\nthat popes at this time were in great need of money.\r\n\r\nThe lawless profligacy of Francesco Cenci first began seriously to\r\nattract public attention under the pontificate of Gregory XIII. This\r\nreign offered marvellous facilities for the development of a reputation\r\nsuch as that which this reckless Italian Don Juan seemed bent on\r\nacquiring. Under the Bolognese Buoncampagno, a free hand was given to\r\nthose able to pay both assassins and judges. Rape and murder were so\r\ncommon that public justice scarcely troubled itself with these trifling\r\nthings, if nobody appeared to prosecute the guilty parties. The good\r\nGregory had his reward for his easygoing indulgence; he was spared to\r\nrejoice over the Massacre of St. Bartholomew.\r\n\r\nFrancesco Cenci was at the time of which we are speaking a man of\r\nforty-four or forty-five years of age, about five feet four inches in\r\nheight, symmetrically proportioned, and very strong, although rather\r\nthin; his hair was streaked with grey, his eyes were large and\r\nexpressive, although the upper eyelids drooped somewhat; his nose was\r\nlong, his lips were thin, and wore habitually a pleasant smile, except\r\nwhen his eye perceived an enemy; at this moment his features assumed a\r\nterrible expression; on such occasions, and whenever moved or even\r\nslightly irritated, he was seized with a fit of nervous trembling, which\r\nlasted long after the cause which provoked it had passed. An adept in\r\nall manly exercises and especially in horsemanship, he sometimes used to\r\nride without stopping from Rome to Naples, a distance of forty-one\r\nleagues, passing through the forest of San Germano and the Pontine\r\nmarshes heedless of brigands, although he might be alone and unarmed\r\nsave for his sword and dagger. When his horse fell from fatigue, he\r\nbought another; were the owner unwilling to sell he took it by force; if\r\nresistance were made, he struck, and always with the point, never the\r\nhilt. In most cases, being well known throughout the Papal States as a\r\nfree-handed person, nobody tried to thwart him; some yielding through\r\nfear, others from motives of interest. Impious, sacrilegious, and\r\natheistical, he never entered a church except to profane its sanctity.\r\nIt was said of him that he had a morbid appetite for novelties in crime,\r\nand that there was no outrage he would not commit if he hoped by so\r\ndoing to enjoy a new sensation.\r\n\r\nAt the age of about forty-five he had married a very rich woman, whose\r\nname is not mentioned by any chronicler. She died, leaving him seven\r\nchildren—five boys and two girls. He then married Lucrezia Petroni, a\r\nperfect beauty of the Roman type, except for the ivory pallor of her\r\ncomplexion. By this second marriage he had no children.\r\n\r\nAs if Francesco Cenci were void of all natural affection, he hated his\r\nchildren, and was at no pains to conceal his feelings towards them: on\r\none occasion, when he was building, in the courtyard of his magnificent\r\npalace, near the Tiber, a chapel dedicated to St. Thomas, he remarked to\r\nthe architect, when instructing him to design a family vault, \"That is\r\nwhere I hope to bury them all.\" The architect often subsequently\r\nadmitted that he was so terrified by the fiendish laugh which\r\naccompanied these words, that had not Francesco Cenci’s work been\r\nextremely profitable, he would have refused to go on with it.\r\n\r\nAs soon as his three eldest boys, Giacomo, Cristoforo, and Rocco, were\r\nout of their tutors’ hands, in order to get rid of them he sent them to\r\nthe University of Salamanca, where, out of sight, they were out of mind,\r\nfor he thought no more about them, and did not even send them the means\r\nof subsistence. In these straits, after struggling for some months\r\nagainst their wretched plight, the lads were obliged to leave Salamanca,\r\nand beg their way home, tramping barefoot through France and Italy, till\r\nthey made their way back to Rome, where they found their father harsher\r\nand more unkind than ever.\r\n\r\nThis happened in the early part of the reign of Clement VIII, famed for\r\nhis justice. The three youths resolved to apply to him, to grant them an\r\nallowance out of their father’s immense income. They consequently\r\nrepaired to Frascati, where the pope was building the beautiful\r\nAldobrandini Villa, and stated their case. The pope admitted the justice\r\nof their claims, and ordered Francesco, to allow each of them two\r\nthousand crowns a year. He endeavoured by every possible means to evade\r\nthis decree, but the pope’s orders were too stringent to be disobeyed.\r\n\r\nAbout this period he was for the third time imprisoned for infamous\r\ncrimes. His three sons then again petitioned the pope, alleging that\r\ntheir father dishonoured the family name, and praying that the extreme\r\nrigour of the law, a capital sentence, should be enforced in his case.\r\nThe pope pronounced this conduct unnatural and odious, and drove them\r\nwith ignominy from his presence. As for Francesco, he escaped, as on the\r\ntwo previous occasions, by the payment of a large sum of money.\r\n\r\nIt will be readily understood that his sons’ conduct on this occasion\r\ndid not improve their father’s disposition towards them, but as their\r\nindependent pensions enabled them to keep out of his way, his rage fell\r\nwith all the greater intensity on his two unhappy daughters. Their\r\nsituation soon became so intolerable, that the elder, contriving to\r\nelude the close supervision under which she was kept, forwarded to the\r\npope a petition, relating the cruel treatment to which she was\r\nsubjected, and praying His Holiness either to give her in marriage or\r\nplace her in a convent. Clement VIII took pity on her; compelled\r\nFrancesco Cenci to give her a dowry of sixty thousand crowns, and\r\nmarried her to Carlo Gabrielli, of a noble family of Gubbio. Francesco\r\ndriven nearly frantic with rage when he saw this victim released from\r\nhis clutches.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time death relieved him from two other encumbrances: his\r\nsons Rocco and Cristoforo were killed within a year of each other; the\r\nlatter by a bungling medical practitioner whose name is unknown; the\r\nformer by Paolo Corso di Massa, in the streets of Rome. This came as a\r\nrelief to Francesco, whose avarice pursued his sons even after their\r\ndeath, for he intimated to the priest that he would not spend a farthing\r\non funeral services. They were accordingly borne to the paupers’ graves\r\nwhich he had caused to be prepared for them, and when he saw them both\r\ninterred, he cried out that he was well rid of such good-for-nothing\r\nchildren, but that he should be perfectly happy only when the remaining\r\nfive were buried with the first two, and that when he had got rid of the\r\nlast he himself would burn down his palace as a bonfire to celebrate the\r\nevent.\r\n\r\nBut Francesco took every precaution against his second daughter,\r\nBeatrice Cenci, following the example of her elder sister. She was then\r\na child of twelve or thirteen years of age, beautiful and innocent as an\r\nangel. Her long fair hair, a beauty seen so rarely in Italy, that\r\nRaffaelle, believing it divine, has appropriated it to all his Madonnas,\r\ncurtained a lovely forehead, and fell in flowing locks over her\r\nshoulders. Her azure eyes bore a heavenly expression; she was of middle\r\nheight, exquisitely proportioned; and during the rare moments when a\r\ngleam of happiness allowed her natural character to display itself, she\r\nwas lively, joyous, and sympathetic, but at the same time evinced a firm\r\nand decided disposition.\r\n\r\nTo make sure of her custody, Francesco kept her shut up in a remote\r\napartment of his palace, the key of which he kept in his own possession.\r\nThere, her unnatural and inflexible gaoler daily brought her some food.\r\nUp to the age of thirteen, which she had now reached, he had behaved to\r\nher with the most extreme harshness and severity; but now, to poor\r\nBeatrice’s great astonishment, he all at once became gentle and even\r\ntender. Beatrice was a child no longer; her beauty expanded like a\r\nflower; and Francesco, a stranger to no crime, however heinous, had\r\nmarked her for his own.\r\n\r\nBrought up as she had been, uneducated, deprived of all society, even\r\nthat of her stepmother, Beatrice knew not good from evil: her ruin was\r\ncomparatively easy to compass; yet Francesco, to accomplish his\r\ndiabolical purpose, employed all the means at his command. Every night\r\nshe was awakened by a concert of music which seemed to come from\r\nParadise. When she mentioned this to her father, he left her in this\r\nbelief, adding that if she proved gentle and obedient she would be\r\nrewarded by heavenly sights, as well as heavenly sounds.\r\n\r\nOne night it came to pass that as the young girl was reposing, her head\r\nsupported on her elbow, and listening to a delightful harmony, the\r\nchamber door suddenly opened, and from the darkness of her own room she\r\nbeheld a suite of apartments brilliantly illuminated, and sensuous with\r\nperfumes; beautiful youths and girls, half clad, such as she had seen in\r\nthe pictures of Guido and Raffaelle, moved to and fro in these\r\napartments, seeming full of joy and happiness: these were the ministers\r\nto the pleasures of Francesco, who, rich as a king, every night revelled\r\nin the orgies of Alexander, the wedding revels of Lucrezia, and the\r\nexcesses of Tiberius at Capri. After an hour, the door closed, and the\r\nseductive vision vanished, leaving Beatrice full of trouble and\r\namazement.\r\n\r\nThe night following, the same apparition again presented itself, only,\r\non this occasion, Francesco Cenci, undressed, entered his daughter’s\r\nroom and invited her to join the fete. Hardly knowing what she did,\r\nBeatrice yet perceived the impropriety of yielding to her father’s\r\nwishes: she replied that, not seeing her stepmother, Lucrezia Petroni,\r\namong all these women, she dared not leave her bed to mix with persons\r\nwho were unknown to her. Francesco threatened and prayed, but threats\r\nand prayers were of no avail. Beatrice wrapped herself up in the\r\nbedclothes, and obstinately refused to obey.\r\n\r\nThe next night she threw herself on her bed without undressing. At the\r\naccustomed hour the door opened, and the nocturnal spectacle reappeared.\r\nThis time, Lucrezia Petroni was among the women who passed before\r\nBeatrice’s door; violence had compelled her to undergo this humiliation.\r\nBeatrice was too far off to see her blushes and her tears. Francesco\r\npointed out her stepmother, whom she had looked for in vain the previous\r\nevening; and as she could no longer make any opposition, he led her,\r\ncovered with blushes and confusion, into the middle of this orgy.\r\n\r\nBeatrice there saw incredible and infamous things....\r\n\r\nNevertheless, she resisted a long time: an inward voice told her that\r\nthis was horrible; but Francesco had the slow persistence of a demon. To\r\nthese sights, calculated to stimulate her passions, he added heresies\r\ndesigned to warp her mind; he told her that the greatest saints\r\nvenerated by the Church were the issue of fathers and daughters, and in\r\nthe end Beatrice committed a crime without even knowing it to be a sin.\r\n\r\nHis brutality then knew no bounds. He forced Lucrezia and Beatrice to\r\nshare the same bed, threatening his wife to kill her if she disclosed to\r\nhis daughter by a single word that there was anything odious in such an\r\nintercourse. So matters went on for about three years.\r\n\r\nAt this time Francesco was obliged to make a journey, and leave the\r\nwomen alone and free. The first thing Lucrezia did was to enlighten\r\nBeatrice on the infamy of the life they were leading; they then together\r\nprepared a memorial to the pope, in which they laid before him a\r\nstatement of all the blows and outrages they had suffered. But, before\r\nleaving, Francesco Cenci had taken precautions; every person about the\r\npope was in his pay, or hoped to be. The petition never reached His\r\nHoliness, and the two poor women, remembering that Clement VIII had on a\r\nfarmer occasion driven Giacomo, Cristaforo, and Rocco from his presence,\r\nthought they were included in the same proscription, and looked upon\r\nthemselves as abandoned to their fate.\r\n\r\nWhen matters were in this state, Giacomo, taking advantage of his\r\nfather’s absence, came to pay them a visit with a friend of his, an abbe\r\nnamed Guerra: he was a young man of twenty-five or twenty-six, belonging\r\nto one of the most noble families in Rome, of a bold, resolute, and\r\ncourageous character, and idolised by all the Roman ladies for his\r\nbeauty. To classical features he added blue eyes swimming in poetic\r\nsentiment; his hair was long and fair, with chestnut beard and eyebrows;\r\nadd to these attractions a highly educated mind, natural eloquence\r\nexpressed by a musical and penetrating voice, and the reader may form\r\nsome idea of Monsignor the Abbe Guerra.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had he seen Beatrice than he fell in love with her. On her\r\nside, she was not slow to return the sympathy of the young priest. The\r\nCouncil of Trent had not been held at that time, consequently\r\necclesiastics were not precluded from marriage. It was therefore decided\r\nthat on the return of Francesco the Abbe Guerra should demand the hand\r\nof Beatrice from her father, and the women, happy in the absence of\r\ntheir master, continued to live on, hoping for better things to come.\r\n\r\nAfter three or four months, during which no one knew where he was,\r\nFrancesco returned. The very first night, he wished to resume his\r\nintercourse with Beatrice; but she was no longer the same person, the\r\ntimid and submissive child had become a girl of decided will; strong in\r\nher love for the abbe, she resisted alike prayers, threats, and blows.\r\n\r\nThe wrath of Francesco fell upon his wife, whom he accused of betraying\r\nhim; he gave her a violent thrashing. Lucrezia Petroni was a veritable\r\nRoman she-wolf, passionate alike in love and vengeance; she endured all,\r\nbut pardoned nothing.\r\n\r\nSome days after this, the Abbe Guerra arrived at the Cenci palace to\r\ncarry out what had been arranged. Rich, young, noble, and handsome,\r\neverything would seem to promise him success; yet he was rudely\r\ndismissed by Francesco. The first refusal did not daunt him; he returned\r\nto the charge a second time and yet a third, insisting upon the\r\nsuitableness of such a union. At length Francesco, losing patience, told\r\nthis obstinate lover that a reason existed why Beatrice could be neither\r\nhis wife nor any other man’s. Guerra demanded what this reason was.\r\nFrancesco replied:\r\n\r\n\"Because she is my mistress.\"\r\n\r\nMonsignor Guerra turned pale at this answer, although at first he did\r\nnot believe a word of it; but when he saw the smile with which Francesco\r\nCenci accompanied his words, he was compelled to believe that, terrible\r\nthough it was, the truth had been spoken.\r\n\r\nFor three days he sought an interview with Beatrice in vain; at length\r\nhe succeeded in finding her. His last hope was her denial of this\r\nhorrible story: Beatrice confessed all. Henceforth there was no human\r\nhope for the two lovers; an impassable gulf separated them. They parted\r\nbathed in tears, promising to love one another always.\r\n\r\nUp to that time the two women had not formed any criminal resolution,\r\nand possibly the tragical incident might never have happened, had not\r\nFrances one night returned into his daughter’s room and violently forced\r\nher into the commission of fresh crime.\r\n\r\nHenceforth the doom of Francesco was irrevocably pronounced.\r\n\r\nAs we have said, the mind of Beatrice was susceptible to the best and\r\nthe worst influences: it could attain excellence, and descend to guilt.\r\nShe went and told her mother of the fresh outrage she had undergone;\r\nthis roused in the heart of the other woman the sting of her own wrongs;\r\nand, stimulating each other’s desire for revenge, they, decided upon the\r\nmurder of Francesco.\r\n\r\nGuerra was called in to this council of death. His heart was a prey to\r\nhatred and revenge. He undertook to communicate with Giacomo Cenci,\r\nwithout whose concurrence the women would not act, as he was the head of\r\nthe family, when his father was left out of account.\r\n\r\nGiacomo entered readily into the conspiracy. It will be remembered what\r\nhe had formerly suffered from his father; since that time he had\r\nmarried, and the close-fisted old man had left him, with his wife and\r\nchildren, to languish in poverty. Guerra’s house was selected to meet in\r\nand concert matters.\r\n\r\nGiacomo hired a sbirro named Marzio, and Guerra a second named Olympio.\r\n\r\nBoth these men had private reasons for committing the crime—one being\r\nactuated by love, the other by hatred. Marzio, who was in the service of\r\nGiacomo, had often seen Beatrice, and loved her, but with that silent\r\nand hopeless love which devours the soul. When he conceived that the\r\nproposed crime would draw him nearer to Beatrice, he accepted his part\r\nin it without any demur.\r\n\r\nAs for Olympio, he hated Francesco, because the latter had caused him to\r\nlose the post of castellan of Rocco Petrella, a fortified stronghold in\r\nthe kingdom of Naples, belonging to Prince Colonna. Almost every year\r\nFrancesco Cenci spent some months at Rocco Petrella with his family; for\r\nPrince Colonna, a noble and magnificent but needy prince, had much\r\nesteem for Francesco, whose purse he found extremely useful. It had so\r\nhappened that Francesco, being dissatisfied with Olympio, complained\r\nabout him to Prince Colonna, and he was dismissed.\r\n\r\nAfter several consultations between the Cenci family, the abbe and the\r\nsbirri, the following plan of action was decided upon.\r\n\r\nThe period when Francesco Cenci was accustomed to go to Rocco Petrella\r\nwas approaching: it was arranged that Olympio, conversant with the\r\ndistrict and its inhabitants, should collect a party of a dozen\r\nNeapolitan bandits, and conceal them in a forest through which the\r\ntravellers would have to pass. Upon a given signal, the whole family\r\nwere to be seized and carried off. A heavy ransom was to be demanded,\r\nand the sons were to be sent back to Rome to raise the sum; but, under\r\npretext of inability to do so, they were to allow the time fixed by the\r\nbandits to lapse, when Francesco was to be put to death. Thus all\r\nsuspicions of a plot would be avoided, and the real assassins would\r\nescape justice.\r\n\r\nThis well-devised scheme was nevertheless unsuccessful. When Francesco\r\nleft Rome, the scout sent in advance by the conspirators could not find\r\nthe bandits; the latter, not being warned beforehand, failed to come\r\ndown before the passage of the travellers, who arrived safe and sound at\r\nRocco Petrella. The bandits, after having patrolled the road in vain,\r\ncame to the conclusion that their prey had escaped, and, unwilling to\r\nstay any longer in a place where they had already spent a week, went off\r\nin quest of better luck elsewhere.\r\n\r\nFrancesco had in the meantime settled down in the fortress, and, to be\r\nmore free to tyrannise over Lucrezia and Beatrice, sent back to Rome\r\nGiacomo and his two other sons. He then recommenced his infamous\r\nattempts upon Beatrice, and with such persistence, that she resolved\r\nherself to accomplish the deed which at first she desired to entrust to\r\nother hands.\r\n\r\nOlympio and Marzio, who had nothing to fear from justice, remained\r\nlurking about the castle; one day Beatrice saw them from a window, and\r\nmade signs that she had something to communicate to them. The same night\r\nOlympio, who having been castellan knew all the approaches to the\r\nfortress, made his way there with his companion. Beatrice awaited them\r\nat a window which looked on to a secluded courtyard; she gave them\r\nletters which she had written to her brother and to Monsignor Guerra.\r\nThe former was to approve, as he had done before, the murder of their\r\nfather; for she would do nothing without his sanction. As for Monsignor\r\nGuerra, he was to pay Olympio a thousand piastres, half the stipulated\r\nsum; Marzio acting out of pure love for Beatrice, whom he worshipped as\r\na Madonna; which observing, the girl gave him a handsome scarlet mantle,\r\ntrimmed with gold lace, telling him to wear it for love of her. As for\r\nthe remaining money, it was to be paid when the death of the old man\r\nhad placed his wife and daughter in possession of his fortune.\r\n\r\nThe two sbirri departed, and the imprisoned conspirators anxiously\r\nawaited their return. On the day fixed, they were seen again. Monsignor\r\nGuerra had paid the thousand piastres, and Giacomo had given his\r\nconsent. Nothing now stood in the way of the execution of this terrible\r\ndeed, which was fixed for the 8th of September, the day of the Nativity\r\nof the Virgin; but Signora Lucrezia, a very devout person, having\r\nnoticed this circumstance, would not be a party to the committal of a\r\ndouble sin; the matter was therefore deferred till the next day, the\r\n9th.\r\n\r\nThat evening, the 9th of September, 1598, the two women, supping with\r\nthe old man, mixed some narcotic with his wine so adroitly that,\r\nsuspicious though he was, he never detected it, and having swallowed the\r\npotion, soon fell into a deep sleep.\r\n\r\nThe evening previous, Marzio and Olympio had been admitted into the\r\ncastle, where they had lain concealed all night and all day; for, as\r\nwill be remembered, the assassination would have been effected the day\r\nbefore had it not been for the religious scruples of Signora Lucrezia\r\nPetroni. Towards midnight, Beatrice fetched them out of their\r\nhiding-place, and took them to her father’s chamber, the door of which\r\nshe herself opened. The assassins entered, and the two women awaited the\r\nissue in the room adjoining.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment, seeing the sbirri reappear pale and nerveless, shaking\r\ntheir heads without speaking, they at once inferred that nothing had\r\nbeen done.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" cried Beatrice; \"and what hinders you?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a cowardly act,\" replied the assassins, \"to kill a poor old man\r\nin his sleep. At the thought of his age, we were struck with pity.\"\r\n\r\nThen Beatrice disdainfully raised her head, and in a deep firm voice\r\nthus reproached them.\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible that you, who pretend to be brave and strong, have not\r\ncourage enough to kill a sleeping old man? How would it be if he were\r\nawake? And thus you steal our money! Very well: since your cowardice\r\ncompels me to do so, I will kill my father myself; but you will not long\r\nsurvive him.\"\r\n\r\nHearing these words, the sbirri felt ashamed of their irresolution, and,\r\nindicating by signs that they would fulfil their compact, they entered\r\nthe room, accompanied by the two women. As they had said, a ray of\r\nmoonlight shone through the open window, and brought into prominence the\r\ntranquil face of the old man, the sight of whose white hair had so\r\naffected them.\r\n\r\nThis time they showed no mercy. One of them carried two great nails,\r\nsuch as those portrayed in pictures of the Crucifixion; the other bore a\r\nmallet: the first placed a nail upright over one of the old man’s eyes;\r\nthe other struck it with the hammer, and drove it into his head. The\r\nthroat was pierced in the same way with the second nail; and thus the\r\nguilty soul, stained throughout its career with crimes of violence, was\r\nin its turn violently torn from the body, which lay writhing on the\r\nfloor where it had rolled.\r\n\r\nThe young girl then, faithful to her word, handed the sbirri a large\r\npurse containing the rest of the sum agreed upon, and they left. When\r\nthey found themselves alone, the women drew the nails out of the wounds,\r\nwrapped the corpse in a sheet, and dragged it through the rooms towards\r\na small rampart, intending to throw it down into a garden which had been\r\nallowed to run to waste. They hoped that the old man’s death would be\r\nattributed to his having accidentally fallen off the terrace on his way\r\nin the dark to a closet at the end of the gallery. But their strength\r\nfailed them when they reached the door of the last room, and, while\r\nresting there, Lucrezia perceived the two sbirri, sharing the money\r\nbefore making their escape. At her call they came to her, carried the\r\ncorpse to the rampart, and, from a spot pointed out by the women, where\r\nthe terrace was unfenced by any parapet, they threw it into an elder\r\ntree below, whose branches retained’ it suspended.\r\n\r\nWhen the body was found the following morning hanging in the branches of\r\nthe elder tree, everybody supposed, as Beatrice and her stepmother had\r\nforeseen, that Francesco, stepping over the edge of the terrace in\r\nthe dark, had thus met his end. The body was so scratched and disfigured\r\nthat no one noticed the wounds made by the two nails. The ladies, as\r\nsoon as the news was imparted to them, came out from their rooms,\r\nweeping and lamenting in so natural a manner as to disarm any\r\nsuspicions. The only person who formed any was the laundress to whom\r\nBeatrice entrusted the sheet in which her father’s body had been\r\nwrapped, accounting for its bloody condition by a lame explanation,\r\nwhich the laundress accepted without question, or pretended to do so;\r\nand immediately after the funeral, the mourners returned to Rome, hoping\r\nat length to enjoy quietude and peace. For some time, indeed, they did\r\nenjoy tranquillity, perhaps poisoned by remorse, but ere long\r\nretribution pursued them. The court of Naples, hearing of the sudden and\r\nunexpected death of Francesco Cenci, and conceiving some suspicions of\r\nviolence, despatched a royal commissioner to Petrella to exhume the body\r\nand make minute inquiries, if there appeared to be adequate grounds for\r\ndoing so. On his arrival all the domestics in the castle were placed\r\nunder arrest and sent in chains to Naples. No incriminating proofs,\r\nhowever, were found, except in the evidence of the laundress, who\r\ndeposed that Beatrice had given her a bloodstained sheet to wash. This,\r\nclue led to terrible consequences; for, further questioned she declared\r\nthat she could not believe the explanation given to account for its\r\ncondition. The evidence was sent to the Roman court; but at that period\r\nit did not appear strong enough to warrant the arrest of the Cenci\r\nfamily, who remained undisturbed for many months, during which time the\r\nyoungest boy died. Of the five brothers there only remained Giacomo, the\r\neldest, and Bernardo, the youngest but one. Nothing prevented them from\r\nescaping to Venice or Florence; but they remained quietly in Rome.\r\n\r\nMeantime Monsignor Guerra received private information that, shortly\r\nbefore the death of Francesco, Marzio and Olympio had been seen prowling\r\nround the castle, and that the Neapolitan police had received orders to\r\narrest them.\r\n\r\nThe monsignor was a most wary man, and very difficult to catch napping\r\nwhen warned in time. He immediately hired two other sbirri to\r\nassassinate Marzio and Olympio. The one commissioned to put Olympio out\r\nof the way came across him at Terni, and conscientiously did his work\r\nwith a poniard, but Marzio’s man unfortunately arrived at Naples too\r\nlate, and found his bird already in the hands of the police.\r\n\r\nHe was put to the torture, and confessed everything. His deposition was\r\nsent to Rome, whither he shortly afterwards followed it, to be\r\nconfronted with the accused. Warrants were immediately issued for the\r\narrest of Giacomo, Bernardo, Lucrezia, and Beatrice; they were at first\r\nconfined in the Cenci palace under a strong guard, but the proofs\r\nagainst them becoming stronger and stronger, they were removed to the\r\ncastle of Corte Savella, where they were confronted with Marzio; but\r\nthey obstinately denied both any complicity in the crime and any\r\nknowledge of the assassin. Beatrice, above all, displayed the greatest\r\nassurance, demanding to be the first to be confronted with Marzio; whose\r\nmendacity she affirmed with such calm dignity, that he, more than ever\r\nsmitten by her beauty, determined, since he could not live for her, to\r\nsave her by his death. Consequently, he declared all his statements to\r\nbe false, and asked forgiveness from God and from Beatrice; neither\r\nthreats nor tortures could make him recant, and he died firm in his\r\ndenial, under frightful tortures. The Cenci then thought themselves\r\nsafe.\r\n\r\nGod’s justice, however, still pursued them. The sbirro who had killed\r\nOlympio happened to be arrested for another crime, and, making a clean\r\nbreast, confessed that he had been employed by Monsignor Guerra—to put\r\nout of the way a fellow-assassin named Olympio, who knew too many of the\r\nmonsignor’s secrets.\r\n\r\nLuckily for himself, Monsignor Guerra heard of this opportunely. A man\r\nof infinite resource, he lost not a moment in timid or irresolute plans,\r\nbut as it happened that at the very moment when he was warned, the\r\ncharcoal dealer who supplied his house with fuel was at hand, he sent\r\nfor him, purchased his silence with a handsome bribe, and then, buying\r\nfor almost their weight in gold the dirty old clothes which he wore, he\r\nassumed these, cut off all his beautiful cherished fair hair, stained\r\nhis beard, smudged his face, bought two asses, laden with charcoal, and\r\nlimped up and down the streets of Rome, crying, \"Charcoal! charcoal!\"\r\nThen, whilst all the detectives were hunting high and low for him, he\r\ngot out of the city, met a company of merchants under escort, joined\r\nthem, and reached Naples, where he embarked. What ultimately became of\r\nhim was never known; it has been asserted, but without confirmation,\r\nthat he succeeded—in reaching France, and enlisted in a Swiss regiment\r\nin the pay of Henry IV.\r\n\r\nThe confession of the sbirro and the disappearance of Monsignor Guerra\r\nleft no moral doubt of the guilt of the Cenci. They were consequently\r\nsent from the castle to the prison; the two brothers, when put to the\r\ntorture, broke down and confessed their guilt. Lucrezia Petroni’s full\r\nhabit of body rendered her unable to bear the torture of the rope, and,\r\non being suspended in the air, begged to be lowered, when she confessed\r\nall she knew.\r\n\r\nAs for Beatrice, she continued unmoved; neither promises, threats, nor\r\ntorture had any effect upon her; she bore everything unflinchingly, and\r\nthe judge Ulysses Moscati himself, famous though he was in such matters,\r\nfailed to draw from her a single incriminating word. Unwilling to take\r\nany further responsibility, he referred the case to Clement VIII; and\r\nthe pope, conjecturing that the judge had been too lenient in applying\r\nthe torture to, a young and beautiful Roman lady, took it out of his\r\nhands and entrusted it to another judge, whose severity and\r\ninsensibility to emotion were undisputed.\r\n\r\nThis latter reopened the whole interrogatory, and as Beatrice up to that\r\ntime had only been subjected to the ordinary torture, he gave\r\ninstructions to apply both the ordinary and extraordinary. This was the\r\nrope and pulley, one of the most terrible inventions ever devised by the\r\nmost ingenious of tormentors.\r\n\r\nTo make the nature of this horrid torture plain to our readers, we give\r\na detailed description of it, adding an extract of the presiding judge’s\r\nreport of the case, taken from the Vatican manuscripts.\r\n\r\nOf the various forms of torture then used in Rome the most common were\r\nthe whistle, the fire, the sleepless, and the rope.\r\n\r\nThe mildest, the torture of the whistle, was used only in the case of\r\nchildren and old persons; it consisted in thrusting between the nails\r\nand the flesh reeds cut in the shape of whistles.\r\n\r\nThe fire, frequently employed before the invention of the sleepless\r\ntorture, was simply roasting the soles of the feet before a hot fire.\r\n\r\nThe sleepless torture, invented by Marsilius, was worked by forcing the\r\naccused into an angular frame of wood about five feet high, the sufferer\r\nbeing stripped and his arms tied behind his back to the frame; two men,\r\nrelieved every five hours, sat beside him, and roused him the moment he\r\nclosed his eyes. Marsilius says he has never found a man proof against\r\nthis torture; but here he claims more than he is justly entitled to.\r\nFarinacci states that, out of one hundred accused persons subjected to\r\nit, five only refused to confess—a very satisfactory result for the\r\ninventor.\r\n\r\nLastly comes the torture of the rope and pulley, the most in vogue of\r\nall, and known in other Latin countries as the strappado.\r\n\r\nIt was divided into three degrees of intensity—the slight, the severe,\r\nand the very severe.\r\n\r\nThe first, or slight torture, which consisted mainly in the\r\napprehensions it caused, comprised the threat of severe torture,\r\nintroduction into the torture chamber, stripping, and the tying of the\r\nrope in readiness for its appliance. To increase the terror these\r\npreliminaries excited, a pang of physical pain was added by tightening a\r\ncord round the wrists. This often sufficed to extract a confession from\r\nwomen or men of highly strung nerves.\r\n\r\nThe second degree, or severe torture, consisted in fastening the\r\nsufferer, stripped naked, and his hands tied behind his back, by the\r\nwrists to one end of a rope passed round a pulley bolted into the\r\nvaulted ceiling, the other end being attached to a windlass, by turning\r\nwhich he could be hoisted, into the air, and dropped again, either\r\nslowly or with a jerk, as ordered by the judge. The suspension generally\r\nlasted during the recital of a Pater Noster, an Ave Maria, or a\r\nMiserere; if the accused persisted in his denial, it was doubled. This\r\nsecond degree, the last of the ordinary torture, was put in practice\r\nwhen the crime appeared reasonably probable but was not absolutely\r\nproved.\r\n\r\nThe third, or very severe, the first of the extraordinary forms of\r\ntorture, was so called when the sufferer, having hung suspended by the\r\nwrists, for sometimes a whole hour, was swung about by the executioner,\r\neither like the pendulum of a clock, or by elevating him with the\r\nwindlass and dropping him to within a foot or two of the ground. If he\r\nstood this torture, a thing almost unheard of, seeing that it cut the\r\nflesh of the wrist to the bone and dislocated the limbs, weights were\r\nattached to the feet, thus doubling the torture. This last form of\r\ntorture was only applied when an atrocious crime had been proved to have\r\nbeen committed upon a sacred person, such as a priest, a cardinal, a\r\nprince, or an eminent and learned man.\r\n\r\nHaving seen that Beatrice was sentenced to the torture ordinary and\r\nextraordinary, and having explained the nature of these tortures, we\r\nproceed to quote the official report:—\r\n\r\n\"And as in reply to every question she would confess nothing, we caused\r\nher to be taken by two officers and led from the prison to the torture\r\nchamber, where the torturer was in attendance; there, after cutting off\r\nher hair, he made her sit on a small stool, undressed her, pulled off\r\nher shoes, tied her hands behind her back, fastened them to a rope\r\npassed over a pulley bolted into the ceiling of the aforesaid chamber,\r\nand wound up at the other end by a four lever windlass, worked by two\r\nmen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Before hoisting her from the ground we again interrogated her touching\r\nthe aforesaid parricide; but notwithstanding the confessions of her\r\nbrother and her stepmother, which were again produced, bearing their\r\nsignatures, she persisted in denying everything, saying, ’Haul me about\r\nand do what you like with me; I have spoken the truth, and will tell you\r\nnothing else, even if I were torn to pieces.’\r\n\r\n\"Upon this we had her hoisted in the air by the wrists to the height of\r\nabout two feet from the ground, while we recited a Pater Noster; and\r\nthen again questioned her as to the facts and circumstances of the\r\naforesaid parricide; but she would make no further answer, only saying,\r\n’You are killing me! You are killing me!’\r\n\r\n\"We then raised her to the elevation of four feet, and began an Ave\r\nMaria. But before our prayer was half finished she fainted away; or\r\npretended to do so.\r\n\r\n\"We caused a bucketful of water to be thrown over her head; feeling its\r\ncoolness, she recovered consciousness, and cried, ’My God! I am dead!\r\nYou are killing me! My God!’ But this was all she would say.\r\n\r\n\"We then raised her higher still, and recited a Miserere, during which,\r\ninstead of joining in the prayer, she shook convulsively and cried\r\nseveral times, ’My God! My God!’\r\n\r\n\"Again questioned as to the aforesaid parricide, she would confess\r\nnothing, saying only that she was innocent, and then again fainted away.\r\n\r\n\"We caused more water to be thrown over her; then she recovered her\r\nsenses, opened her eyes, and cried, ’O cursed executioners! You are\r\nkilling me! You are killing me!’ But nothing more would she say.\r\n\r\n\"Seeing which, and that she persisted in her denial, we ordered the\r\ntorturer to proceed to the torture by jerks.\r\n\r\n\"He accordingly hoisted her ten feet from the ground, and when there we\r\nenjoined her to tell the truth; but whether she would not or could not\r\nspeak, she answered only by a motion of the head indicating that she\r\ncould say nothing.\r\n\r\n\"Seeing which, we made a sign to the executioner, to let go the rope,\r\nand she fell with all her weight from the height of ten feet to that of\r\ntwo feet; her arms, from the shock, were dislocated from their sockets;\r\nshe uttered a loud cry, and swooned away.\r\n\r\n\"We again caused water to be dashed in her face; she returned to\r\nherself, and again cried out, ’Infamous assassins! You are killing me;\r\nbut were you to tear out my arms, I would tell you nothing else.’\r\n\r\n\"Upon this, we ordered a weight of fifty pounds to be fastened to her\r\nfeet. But at this moment the door opened, and many voices cried,\r\n’Enough! Enough! Do not torture her any more!’\"\r\n\r\nThese voices were those of Giacomo, Bernardo, and Lucrezia Petroni. The\r\njudges, perceiving the obstinacy of Beatrice, had ordered that the\r\naccused, who had been separated for five months, should be confronted.\r\n\r\nThey advanced into the torture chamber, and seeing Beatrice hanging by\r\nthe wrists, her arms disjointed, and covered with blood, Giacomo cried\r\nout:—\r\n\r\n\"The sin is committed; nothing further remains but to save our souls by\r\nrepentance, undergo death courageously, and not suffer you to be thus\r\ntortured.\"\r\n\r\nThen said Beatrice, shaking her head as if to cast off grief—\r\n\r\n\"Do you then wish to die? Since you wish it, be it so.\"\r\n\r\nThen turning to the officers:—\r\n\r\n\"Untie me,\" said she, \"read the examination to me; and what I have to\r\nconfess, I will confess; what I have to deny, I will deny.\"\r\n\r\nBeatrice was then lowered and untied; a barber reduced the dislocation\r\nof her arms in the usual manner; the examination was read over to her,\r\nand, as she had promised, she made a full confession.\r\n\r\nAfter this confession, at the request of the two brothers, they were all\r\nconfined in the same prison; but the next day Giacomo and Bernardo were\r\ntaken to the cells of Tordinona; as for the women, they remained where\r\nthey were.\r\n\r\nThe pope was so horrified on reading the particulars of the crime\r\ncontained in the confessions, that he ordered the culprits to be dragged\r\nby wild horses through the streets of Rome. But so barbarous a sentence\r\nshocked the public mind, so much so that many persons of princely rank\r\npetitioned the Holy Father on their knees, imploring him to reconsider\r\nhis decree, or at least allow the accused to be heard in their defence.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me,\" replied Clement VIII, \"did they give their unhappy father\r\ntime to be heard in his own defence, when they slew him in so merciless\r\nand degrading a fashion?\"\r\n\r\nAt length, overcome by so many entreaties, he respited them for three\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThe most eloquent and skilful advocates in Rome immediately busied\r\nthemselves in preparing pleadings for so emotional a case, and on the\r\nday fixed for hearing appeared before His Holiness.\r\n\r\nThe first pleader was Nicolo degli Angeli, who spoke with such force and\r\neloquence that the pope, alarmed at the effect he was producing among\r\nthe audience, passionately interrupted him.\r\n\r\n\"Are there then to be found,\" he indignantly cried, \"among the Roman\r\nnobility children capable of killing their parents, and among Roman\r\nlawyers men capable of speaking in their defence? This is a thing we\r\nshould never have believed, nor even for a moment supposed it possible!\"\r\n\r\nAll were silent upon this terrible rebuke, except Farinacci, who,\r\nnerving himself with a strong sense of duty, replied respectfully but\r\nfirmly—\r\n\r\n\"Most Holy Father, we are not here to defend criminals, but to save the\r\ninnocent; for if we succeeded in proving that any of the accused acted\r\nin self-defence, I hope that they will be exonerated in the eyes of your\r\nHoliness; for just as the law provides for cases in which the father may\r\nlegally kill the child, so this holds good in the converse. We will\r\ntherefore continue our pleadings on receiving leave from your Holiness\r\nto do so.\"\r\n\r\nClement VIII then showed himself as patient as he had previously been\r\nhasty, and heard the argument of Farinacci, who pleaded that Francesco\r\nCenci had lost all the rights of a father from, the day that he violated\r\nhis daughter. In support of his contention he wished to put in the\r\nmemorial sent by Beatrice to His Holiness, petitioning him, as her\r\nsister had done, to remove her from the paternal roof and place her in a\r\nconvent. Unfortunately, this petition had disappeared, and\r\nnotwithstanding the minutest search among the papal documents, no trace\r\nof it could be found.\r\n\r\nThe pope had all the pleadings collected, and dismissed the advocates,\r\nwho then retired, excepting d’Altieri, who knelt before him, saying—\r\n\r\n\"Most Holy Father, I humbly ask pardon for appearing before you in this\r\ncase, but I had no choice in the matter, being the advocate of the\r\npoor.\"\r\n\r\nThe pope kindly raised him, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Go; we are not surprised at your conduct, but at that of others, who\r\nprotect and defend criminals.\"\r\n\r\nAs the pope took a great interest in this case, he sat up all night over\r\nit, studying it with Cardinal di San Marcello, a man of much acumen and\r\ngreat experience in criminal cases. Then, having summed it up, he sent a\r\ndraft of his opinion to the advocates, who read it with great\r\nsatisfaction, and entertained hopes that the lives of the convicted\r\npersons would be spared; for the evidence all went to prove that even if\r\nthe children had taken their father’s life, all the provocation came\r\nfrom him, and that Beatrice in particular had been dragged into the part\r\nshe had taken in this crime by the tyranny, wickedness, and brutality of\r\nher father. Under the influence of these considerations the pope\r\nmitigated the severity of their prison life, and even allowed the\r\nprisoners to hope that their lives would not be forfeited.\r\n\r\nAmidst the general feeling of relief afforded to the public by these\r\nfavours, another tragical event changed the papal mind and frustrated\r\nall his humane intentions. This was the atrocious murder of the Marchese\r\ndi Santa Croce, a man seventy years of age, by his son Paolo, who\r\nstabbed him with a dagger in fifteen or twenty places, because the\r\nfather would not promise to make Paolo his sole heir. The murderer fled\r\nand escaped.\r\n\r\nClement VIII was horror-stricken at the increasing frequency of this\r\ncrime of parricide: for the moment, however, he was unable to take\r\naction, having to go to Monte Cavallo to consecrate a cardinal titular\r\nbishop in the church of Santa Maria degli Angeli; but the day following,\r\non Friday the 10th of September 1599, at eight o’clock in the morning,\r\nhe summoned Monsignor Taverna, governor of Rome, and said to him—\r\n\r\n\"Monsignor, we place in your hands the Cenci case, that you may carry\r\nout the sentence as speedily as possible.\"\r\n\r\nOn his return to his palace, after leaving His Holiness, the governor\r\nconvened a meeting of all the criminal judges in the city, the result of\r\nthe council being that all the Cenci were condemned to death.\r\n\r\nThe final sentence was immediately known; and as this unhappy family\r\ninspired a constantly increasing interest, many cardinals spent the\r\nwhole of the night either on horseback or in their carriages, making\r\ninterest that, at least so far as the women were concerned, they should\r\nbe put to death privately and in the prison, and that a free pardon\r\nshould be granted to Bernardo, a poor lad only fifteen years of age,\r\nwho, guiltless of any participation in the crime, yet found himself\r\ninvolved in its consequences. The one who interested himself most in the\r\ncase was Cardinal Sforza, who nevertheless failed to elicit a single\r\ngleam of hope, so obdurate was His Holiness. At length Farinacci,\r\nworking on the papal conscience, succeeded, after long and urgent\r\nentreaties, and only at the last moment, that the life of Bernardo\r\nshould be spared.\r\n\r\nFrom Friday evening the members of the brotherhood of the Conforteria\r\nhad gathered at the two prisons of Corte Savella and Tordinona. The\r\npreparations for the closing scene of the tragedy had occupied workmen\r\non the bridge of Sant’ Angelo all night; and it was not till five\r\no’clock in the morning that the registrar entered the cell of Lucrezia\r\nand Beatrice to read their sentences to them.\r\n\r\nBoth were sleeping, calm in the belief of a reprieve. The registrar woke\r\nthem, and told them that, judged by man, they must now prepare to appear\r\nbefore God.\r\n\r\nBeatrice was at first thunderstruck: she seemed paralysed and\r\nspeechless; then she rose from bed, and staggering as if intoxicated,\r\nrecovered her speech, uttering despairing cries. Lucrezia heard the\r\ntidings with more firmness, and proceeded to dress herself to go to the\r\nchapel, exhorting Beatrice to resignation; but she, raving, wrung her,\r\nhands and struck her head against the wall, shrieking, \"To die! to die!\r\nAm I to die unprepared, on a scaffold! on a gibbet! My God! my God!\"\r\nThis fit led to a terrible paroxysm, after which the exhaustion of her\r\nbody enabled her mind to recover its balance, and from that moment she\r\nbecame an angel of humility and an example of resignation.\r\n\r\nHer first request was for a notary to make her will. This was\r\nimmediately complied with, and on his arrival she dictated its\r\nprovisions with much calmness and precision. Its last clause desired her\r\ninterment in the church of San Pietro in Montorio, for which she always\r\nhad a strong attachment, as it commanded a view of her father’s palace.\r\nShe bequeathed five hundred crowns to the nuns of the order of the\r\nStigmata, and ordered that her dowry; amounting to fifteen thousand\r\ncrowns, should be distributed in marriage portions to fifty poor girls.\r\nShe selected the foot of the high altar as the place where she wished to\r\nbe buried, over which hung the beautiful picture of the Transfiguration,\r\nso often admired by her during her life.\r\n\r\nFollowing her example, Lucrezia in her turn, disposed of her property:\r\nshe desired to be buried in the church of San Giorgio di Velobre, and\r\nleft thirty-two thousand crowns to charities, with other pious legacies.\r\nHaving settled their earthly affairs, they joined in prayer, reciting\r\npsalms, litanies, and prayers for the dying.\r\n\r\nAt eight o’clock they confessed, heard mass, and received the\r\nsacraments; after which Beatrice, observing to her stepmother that the\r\nrich dresses they wore were out of place on a scaffold, ordered two to\r\nbe made in nun’s fashion—that is to say, gathered at the neck, with long\r\nwide sleeves. That for Lucrezia was made of black cotton stuff,\r\nBeatrice’s of taffetas. In addition she had a small black turban made to\r\nplace on her head. These dresses, with cords for girdles, were brought\r\nthem; they were placed on a chair, while the women continued to pray.\r\n\r\nThe time appointed being near at hand, they were informed that their\r\nlast moment was approaching. Then Beatrice, who was still on her knees,\r\nrose with a tranquil and almost joyful countenance. \"Mother,\" said she,\r\n\"the moment of our suffering is impending; I think we had better dress\r\nin these clothes, and help one another at our toilet for the last time.\"\r\nThey then put on the dresses provided, girt themselves with the cords;\r\nBeatrice placed her turban on her head, and they awaited the last\r\nsummons.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Giacomo and Bernardo, whose sentences had been read to\r\nthem, awaited also the moment of their death. About ten o’clock the\r\nmembers of the Confraternity of Mercy, a Florentine order, arrived at\r\nthe prison of Tordinona, and halted on the threshold with the crucifix,\r\nawaiting the appearance of the unhappy youths. Here a serious accident\r\nhad nearly happened. As many persons were at the prison windows to see\r\nthe prisoners come out, someone accidentally threw down a large\r\nflower-pot full of earth, which fell into the street and narrowly missed\r\none of the Confraternity who was amongst the torch-bearers just before\r\nthe crucifix. It passed so close to the torch as to extinguish the flame\r\nin its descent.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the gates opened, and Giacomo appeared first on the\r\nthreshold. He fell on his knees, adoring the holy crucifix with great\r\ndevotion. He was completely covered with a large mourning cloak, under\r\nwhich his bare breast was prepared to be torn by the red-hot pincers of\r\nthe executioner, which were lying ready in a chafing-dish fixed to the\r\ncart. Having ascended the vehicle, in which the executioner placed him\r\nso as more readily to perform this office, Bernardo came out, and was\r\nthus addressed on his appearance by the fiscal of Rome—\r\n\r\n\"Signor Bernardo Cenci, in the name of our blessed Redeemer, our Holy\r\nFather the Pope spares your life; with the sole condition that you\r\naccompany your relatives to the scaffold and to their death, and never\r\nforget to pray for those with whom you were condemned to die.\"\r\n\r\nAt this unexpected intelligence, a loud murmur of joy spread among the\r\ncrowd, and the members of the Confraternity immediately untied the small\r\nmask which covered the youth’s eyes; for, owing to his tender age, it\r\nhad been thought proper to conceal the scaffold from his sight.\r\n\r\nThen the executioner; having disposed of Giacomo, came down from the\r\ncart to take Bernardo; whose pardon being formally communicated to him,\r\nhe took off his handcuffs, and placed him alongside his brother,\r\ncovering him up with a magnificent cloak embroidered with gold, for the\r\nneck and shoulders of the poor lad had been already bared, as a\r\npreliminary to his decapitation. People were surprised to see such a\r\nrich cloak in the possession of the executioner, but were told that it\r\nwas the one given by Beatrice to Marzio to pledge him to the murder of\r\nher father, which fell to the executioner as a perquisite after the\r\nexecution of the assassin. The sight of the great assemblage of people\r\nproduced such an effect upon the boy that he fainted.\r\n\r\nThe procession then proceeded to the prison of Corte Savella, marching\r\nto the sound of funeral chants. At its gates the sacred crucifix halted\r\nfor the women to join: they soon appeared, fell on their knees, and\r\nworshipped the holy symbol as the others had done. The march to the\r\nscaffold was then resumed.\r\n\r\nThe two female prisoners followed the last row of penitents in single\r\nfile, veiled to the waist, with the distinction that Lucrezia, as a\r\nwidow, wore a black veil and high-heeled slippers of the same hue, with\r\nbows of ribbon, as was the fashion; whilst Beatrice, as a young\r\nunmarried girl, wore a silk flat cap to match her corsage, with a plush\r\nhood, which fell over her shoulders and covered her violet frock; white\r\nslippers with high heels, ornamented with gold rosettes and\r\ncherry-coloured fringe. The arms of both were untrammelled, except for a\r\nthin slack cord which left their hands free to carry a crucifix and a\r\nhandkerchief.\r\n\r\nDuring the night a lofty scaffold had been erected on the bridge of\r\nSant’ Angelo, and the plank and block were placed thereon. Above the\r\nblock was hung, from a large cross beam, a ponderous axe, which, guided\r\nby two grooves, fell with its whole weight at the touch of a spring.\r\n\r\nIn this formation the procession wended its way towards the bridge of\r\nSant’ Angela. Lucrezia, the more broken down of the two, wept bitterly;\r\nbut Beatrice was firm and unmoved. On arriving at the open space before\r\nthe bridge, the women were led into a chapel, where they were shortly\r\njoined by Giacomo and Bernardo; they remained together for a few\r\nmoments, when the brothers were led away to the scaffold, although one\r\nwas to be executed last, and the other was pardoned. But when they had\r\nmounted the platform, Bernardo fainted a second time; and as the\r\nexecutioner was approaching to his assistance, some of the crowd,\r\nsupposing that his object was to decapitate him, cried loudly, \"He is\r\npardoned!\" The executioner reassured them by seating Bernardo near the\r\nblock, Giacomo kneeling on the other side.\r\n\r\nThen the executioner descended, entered the chapel, and reappeared\r\nleading Lucrezia, who was the first to suffer. At the foot of the\r\nscaffold he tied her hands behind her back, tore open the top of her\r\ncorsage so as to uncover her shoulders, gave her the crucifix to kiss,\r\nand led her to the step ladder, which she ascended with great\r\ndifficulty, on account of her extreme stoutness; then, on her reaching\r\nthe platform, he removed the veil which covered her head. On this\r\nexposure of her features to the immense crowd, Lucrezia shuddered from\r\nhead to foot; then, her eyes full of tears, she cried with a loud voice—\r\n\r\n\"O my God, have mercy upon me; and do you, brethren, pray for my soul!\"\r\n\r\nHaving uttered these words, not knowing what was required of her, she\r\nturned to Alessandro, the chief executioner, and asked what she was to\r\ndo; he told her to bestride the plank and lie prone upon it; which she\r\ndid with great trouble and timidity; but as she was unable, on account\r\nof the fullness of her bust, to lay her neck upon the block, this had to\r\nbe raised by placing a billet of wood underneath it; all this time the\r\npoor woman, suffering even more from shame than from fear, was kept in\r\nsuspense; at length, when she was properly adjusted, the executioner\r\ntouched the spring, the knife fell, and the decapitated head, falling on\r\nthe platform of the scaffold, bounded two or three times in the air, to\r\nthe general horror; the executioner then seized it, showed it to the\r\nmultitude, and wrapping it in black taffetas, placed it with the body on\r\na bier at the foot of the scaffold.\r\n\r\nWhilst arrangements were being made for the decapitation of Beatrice,\r\nseveral stands, full of spectators, broke down; some people were killed\r\nby this accident, and still more lamed and injured.\r\n\r\nThe machine being now rearranged and washed, the executioner returned to\r\nthe chapel to take charge of Beatrice, who, on seeing the sacred\r\ncrucifix, said some prayers for her soul, and on her hands being tied,\r\ncried out, \"God grant that you be binding this body unto corruption, and\r\nloosing this soul unto life eternal!\" She then arose, proceeded to the\r\nplatform, where she devoutly kissed the stigmata; then leaving her\r\nslippers at the foot of the scaffold, she nimbly ascended the ladder,\r\nand instructed beforehand, promptly lay down on the plank, without\r\nexposing her naked shoulders. But her precautions to shorten the\r\nbitterness of death were of no avail, for the pope, knowing her\r\nimpetuous disposition, and fearing lest she might be led into the\r\ncommission of some sin between absolution and death, had given orders\r\nthat the moment Beatrice was extended on the scaffold a signal gun\r\nshould be fired from the castle of Sant’ Angelo; which was done, to the\r\ngreat astonishment of everybody, including Beatrice herself, who, not\r\nexpecting this explosion, raised herself almost upright; the pope\r\nmeanwhile, who was praying at Monte Cavallo, gave her absolution ’in\r\narticulo mortis’. About five minutes thus passed, during which the\r\nsufferer waited with her head replaced on the block; at length, when the\r\nexecutioner judged that the absolution had been given, he released the\r\nspring, and the axe fell.\r\n\r\nA gruesome sight was then afforded: whilst the head bounced away on one\r\nside of the block, on the other the body rose erect, as if about to step\r\nbackwards; the executioner exhibited the head, and disposed of it and\r\nthe body as before. He wished to place Beatrice’s body with that of her\r\nstepmother, but the brotherhood of Mercy took it out of his hands, and\r\nas one of them was attempting to lay it on the bier, it slipped from him\r\nand fell from the scaffold to the ground below; the dress being\r\npartially torn from the body, which was so besmeared with dust and blood\r\nthat much time was occupied in washing it. Poor Bernardo was so overcome\r\nby this horrible scene that he swooned away for the third time, and it\r\nwas necessary to revive him with stimulants to witness the fate of his\r\nelder brother.\r\n\r\nThe turn of Giacomo at length arrived: he had witnessed the death of his\r\nstepmother and his sister, and his clothes were covered with their\r\nblood; the executioner approached him and tore off his cloak, exposing\r\nhis bare breast covered with the wounds caused by the grip of red-hot\r\npincers; in this state, and half-naked, he rose to his feet, and turning\r\nto his brother, said—\r\n\r\n\"Bernardo, if in my examination I have compromised and accused you, I\r\nhave done so falsely, and although I have already disavowed this\r\ndeclaration, I repeat, at the moment of appearing before God, that you\r\nare innocent, and that it is a cruel abuse of justice to compel you to\r\nwitness this frightful spectacle.\"\r\n\r\nThe executioner then made him kneel down, bound his legs to one of the\r\nbeams erected on the scaffold, and having bandaged his eyes, shattered\r\nhis head with a blow of his mallet; then, in the sight of all, he hacked\r\nhis body into four quarters. The official party then left, taking with\r\nthem Bernardo, who, being in a state of high fever, was bled and put to\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nThe corpses of the two ladies were laid out each on its bier under the\r\nstatue of St. Paul, at the foot of the bridge, with four torches of\r\nwhite wax, which burned till four o’clock in the afternoon; then, along\r\nwith the remains of Giacomo, they were taken to the church of San\r\nGiovanni Decollato; finally, about nine in the evening, the body of\r\nBeatrice, covered with flowers, and attired in the dress worn at her\r\nexecution, was carried to the church of San Pietro in Montorio, with\r\nfifty lighted torches, and followed by the brethren of the order of the\r\nStigmata and all the Franciscan monks in Rome; there, agreeably to her\r\nwish, it was buried at the foot of the high altar.\r\n\r\nThe same evening Signora Lucrezia was interred, as she had desired to\r\nbe, in the church of San Giorgio di Velobre.\r\n\r\nAll Rome may be said to have been present at this tragedy, carriages,\r\nhorses, foot people, and cars crowding as it were upon one another. The\r\nday was unfortunately so hot, and the sun so scorching, that many\r\npersons fainted, others returned home stricken with fever, and some even\r\ndied during the night, owing to sunstroke from exposure during the three\r\nhours occupied by the execution.\r\n\r\nThe Tuesday following, the 14th of September; being the Feast of the\r\nHoly Cross, the brotherhood of San Marcello, by special licence of the\r\npope, set at liberty the unhappy Bernardo Cenci, with the condition of\r\npaying within the year two thousand five hundred Roman crowns to the\r\nbrotherhood of the most Holy Trinity of Pope Sixtus, as may be found\r\nto-day recorded in their archives.\r\n\r\nHaving now seen the tomb, if you desire to form a more vivid impression\r\nof the principal actors in this tragedy than can be derived from a\r\nnarrative, pay a visit to the Barberini Gallery, where you will see,\r\nwith five other masterpieces by Guido, the portrait of Beatrice, taken,\r\nsome say the night before her execution, others during her progress to\r\nthe scaffold; it is the head of a lovely girl, wearing a headdress\r\ncomposed of a turban with a lappet. The hair is of a rich fair chestnut\r\nhue; the dark eyes are moistened with recent tears; a perfectly framed\r\nnose surmounts an infantile mouth; unfortunately, the loss of tone in\r\nthe picture since it was painted has destroyed the original fair\r\ncomplexion. The age of the subject may be twenty, or perhaps twenty-two\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nNear this portrait is that of Lucrezia Petrani the small head indicates\r\na person below the middle height; the attributes are those of a Roman\r\nmatron in her pride; her high complexion, graceful contour, straight\r\nnose, black eyebrows, and expression at the same time imperious and\r\nvoluptuous indicate this character to the life; a smile still seems to\r\nlinger an the charming dimpled cheeks and perfect mouth mentioned by the\r\nchronicler, and her face is exquisitely framed by luxuriant curls\r\nfalling from her forehead in graceful profusion.\r\n\r\nAs for Giacomo and Bernardo, as no portraits of them are in existence,\r\nwe are obliged to gather an idea of their appearance from the manuscript\r\nwhich has enabled us to compile this sanguinary history; they are thus\r\ndescribed by the eye-witness of the closing scene—Giacomo was short,\r\nwell-made and strong, with black hair and beard; he appeared to be about\r\ntwenty-six years of age.\r\n\r\nPoor Bernardo was the image of his sister, so nearly resembling her,\r\nthat when he mounted the scaffold his long hair and girlish face led\r\npeople to suppose him to be Beatrice herself: he might be fourteen or\r\nfifteen years of age.\r\n\r\nThe peace of God be with them!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*MASSACRES OF THE SOUTH—1551-1815*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is possible that our reader, whose recollections may perhaps go back\r\nas far as the Restoration, will be surprised at the size of the frame\r\nrequired for the picture we are about to bring before him, embracing as\r\nit does two centuries and a half; but as everything, has its precedent,\r\nevery river its source, every volcano its central fire, so it is that\r\nthe spot of earth on which we are going to fix our eyes has been the\r\nscene of action and reaction, revenge and retaliation, till the\r\nreligious annals of the South resemble an account-book kept by double\r\nentry, in which fanaticism enters the profits of death, one side being\r\nwritten with the blood of Catholics, the other with that of Protestants.\r\n\r\nIn the great political and religious convulsions of the South, the\r\nearthquake-like throes of which were felt even in the capital, Nimes has\r\nalways taken the central place; Nimes will therefore be the pivot round\r\nwhich our story will revolve, and though we may sometimes leave it for a\r\nmoment, we shall always return thither without fail.\r\n\r\nNimes was reunited to France by Louis VIII, the government being taken\r\nfrom its vicomte, Bernard Athon VI, and given to consuls in the year\r\n1207. During the episcopate of Michel Briconnet the relics of St.\r\nBauzile were discovered, and hardly were the rejoicings over this event\r\nat an end when the new doctrines began to spread over France. It was in\r\nthe South that the persecutions began, and in 1551 several persons were\r\npublicly burnt as heretics by order of the Seneschal’s Court at Nimes,\r\namongst whom was Maurice Secenat, a missionary from the Cevennes, who\r\nwas taken in the very act of preaching. Thenceforth Nimes rejoiced in\r\ntwo martyrs and two patron saints, one revered by the Catholics, and one\r\nby the Protestants; St. Bauzile, after reigning as sole protector for\r\ntwenty-four years, being forced to share the honours of his guardianship\r\nwith his new rival.\r\n\r\nMaurice Secenat was followed as preacher by Pierre de Lavau; these two\r\nnames being still remembered among the crowd of obscure and forgotten\r\nmartyrs. He also was put to death on the Place de la Salamandre, all the\r\ndifference being that the former was burnt and the latter hanged.\r\n\r\nPierre de Lavau was attended in his last moments by Dominique Deyron,\r\nDoctor of Theology; but instead of, as is usual, the dying man being\r\nconverted by the priest, it was the priest who was converted by de\r\nLavau, and the teaching which it was desired should be suppressed burst\r\nforth again. Decrees were issued against Dominique Deyron; he was\r\npursued and tracked down, and only escaped the gibbet by fleeing to the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nThe mountains are the refuge of all rising or decaying sects; God has\r\ngiven to the powerful on earth city, plain, and sea, but the mountains\r\nare the heritage of the oppressed.\r\n\r\nPersecution and proselytism kept pace with each other, but the blood\r\nthat was shed produced the usual effect: it rendered the soil on which\r\nit fell fruitful, and after two or three years of struggle, during which\r\ntwo or three hundred Huguenots had been burnt or hanged, Nimes awoke one\r\nmorning with a Protestant majority. In 1556 the consuls received a sharp\r\nreprimand on account of the leaning of the city towards the doctrines of\r\nthe Reformation; but in 1557, one short year after this admonition,\r\nHenri II was forced to confer the office of president of the Presidial\r\nCourt on William de Calviere, a Protestant. At last a decision of the\r\nsenior judge having declared that it was the duty of the consuls to\r\nsanction the execution of heretics by their presence, the magistrates of\r\nthe city protested against this decision, and the power of the Crown was\r\ninsufficient to carry it out.\r\n\r\nHenri II dying, Catherine de Medicis and the Guises took possession of\r\nthe throne in the name of Francois II. There is a moment when nations\r\ncan always draw a long breath, it is while their kings are awaiting\r\nburial; and Nimes took advantage of this moment on the death of Henri\r\nII, and on September 29th, 1559, Guillaume Moget founded the first\r\nProtestant community.\r\n\r\nGuillaume Moget came from Geneva. He was the spiritual son of Calvin,\r\nand came to Nimes with the firm purpose of converting all the remaining\r\nCatholics or of being hanged. As he was eloquent, spirited, and wily,\r\ntoo wise to be violent, ever ready to give and take in the matter of\r\nconcessions, luck was on his side, and Guillaume Moget escaped hanging.\r\n\r\nThe moment a rising sect ceases to be downtrodden it becomes a queen,\r\nand heresy, already mistress of three-fourths of the city, began to hold\r\nup its head with boldness in the streets. A householder called Guillaume\r\nRaymond opened his house to the Calvinist missionary, and allowed him to\r\npreach in it regularly to all who came, and the wavering were thus\r\nconfirmed in the new faith. Soon the house became too narrow to contain\r\nthe crowds which flocked thither to imbibe the poison of the\r\nrevolutionary doctrine, and impatient glances fell on the churches.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Vicomte de Joyeuse, who had just been appointed governor\r\nof Languedoc in the place of M. de Villars, grew uneasy at the rapid\r\nprogress made by the Protestants, who so far from trying to conceal it\r\nboasted of it; so he summoned the consuls before him, admonished them\r\nsharply in the king’s name, and threatened to quarter a garrison in the\r\ntown which would soon put an end to these disorders. The consuls\r\npromised to stop the evil without the aid of outside help, and to carry\r\nout their promise doubled the patrol and appointed a captain of the town\r\nwhose sole duty was to keep order in the streets. Now this captain whose\r\noffice had been created solely for the repression of heresy, happened to\r\nbe Captain Bouillargues, the most inveterate Huguenot who ever existed.\r\n\r\nThe result of this discriminating choice was that Guillaume Moget began\r\nto preach, and once when a great crowd had gathered in a garden to hear\r\nhim hold forth, heavy rain came on, and it became necessary for the\r\npeople either to disperse or to seek shelter under a roof. As the\r\npreacher had just reached the most interesting part of his sermon, the\r\ncongregation did not hesitate an instant to take the latter alternative.\r\nThe Church of St. Etienne du Capitole was quite near: someone present\r\nsuggested that this building, if not the most suitable, as at least the\r\nmost spacious for such a gathering.\r\n\r\nThe idea was received with acclamation: the rain grew heavier, the crowd\r\ninvaded the church, drove out the priests, trampled the Holy Sacrament\r\nunder foot, and broke the sacred images. This being accomplished,\r\nGuillaume Moget entered the pulpit, and resumed his sermon with such\r\neloquence that his hearers’ excitement redoubled, and not satisfied with\r\nwhat had already been done, rushed off to seize on the Franciscan\r\nmonastery, where they forthwith installed Moget and the two women, who,\r\naccording to Menard the historian of Languedoc, never left him day or\r\nnight; all which proceedings were regarded by Captain Bouillargues with\r\nmagnificent calm.\r\n\r\nThe consuls being once more summoned before M. de Villars, who had again\r\nbecome governor, would gladly have denied the existence of disorder; but\r\nfinding this impossible, they threw themselves on his mercy. He being\r\nunable to repose confidence in them any longer, sent a garrison to the\r\ncitadel of Nimes, which the municipality was obliged to support,\r\nappointed a governor of the city with four district captains under him,\r\nand formed a body of military police which quite superseded the\r\nmunicipal constabulary. Moget was expelled from Nimes, and Captain\r\nBouillargues deprived of office.\r\n\r\nFrancis II dying in his turn, the usual effect was produced,—that is,\r\nthe persecution became less fierce,—and Moget therefore returned to\r\nNimes. This was a victory, and every victory being a step forward, the\r\ntriumphant preacher organised a Consistory, and the deputies of Nimes\r\ndemanded from the States-General of Orleans possession of the churches.\r\nNo notice was taken of this demand; but the Protestants were at no loss\r\nhow to proceed. On the 21st December 1561 the churches of Ste. Eugenie,\r\nSt. Augustin, and the Cordeliers were taken by assault, and cleared of\r\ntheir images in a hand’s turn; and this time Captain Bouillargues was\r\nnot satisfied with looking on, but directed the operations.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral was still safe, and in it were entrenched the remnant of\r\nthe Catholic clergy; but it was apparent that at the earliest\r\nopportunity it too would be turned into a meeting-house; and this\r\nopportunity was not long in coming.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday, when Bishop Bernard d’Elbene had celebrated mass, just as\r\nthe regular preacher was about to begin his sermon, some children who\r\nwere playing in the close began to hoot the ’beguinier’ [a name of\r\ncontempt for friars]. Some of the faithful being disturbed in their\r\nmeditations, came out of the church and chastised the little Huguenots,\r\nwhose parents considered themselves in consequence to have been insulted\r\nin the persons of their children. A great commotion ensued, crowds began\r\nto form, and cries of \"To the church! to the church!\" were heard.\r\nCaptain Bouillargues happened to be in the neighbourhood, and being very\r\nmethodical set about organising the insurrection; then putting himself\r\nat its head, he charged the cathedral, carrying everything before him,\r\nin spite of the barricades which had been hastily erected by the\r\nPapists. The assault was over in a few moments; the priests and their\r\nflock fled by one door, while the Reformers entered by another. The\r\nbuilding was in the twinkling of an eye adapted to the new form of\r\nworship: the great crucifix from above the altar was dragged about the\r\nstreets at the end of a rope and scourged at every cross-roads. In the\r\nevening a large fire was lighted in the place before the cathedral, and\r\nthe archives of the ecclesiastical and religious houses, the sacred\r\nimages, the relics of the saints, the decorations of the altar, the\r\nsacerdotal vestments, even the Host itself, were thrown on it without\r\nany remonstrance from the consuls; the very wind which blew upon Nimes\r\nbreathed heresy.\r\n\r\nFor the moment Nimes was in full revolt, and the spirit of organisation\r\nspread: Moget assumed the titles of pastor and minister of the Christian\r\nChurch. Captain Bouillargues melted down the sacred vessels of the\r\nCatholic churches, and paid in this manner the volunteers of Nimes and\r\nthe German mercenaries; the stones of the demolished religious houses\r\nwere used in the construction of fortifications, and before anyone\r\nthought of attacking it the city was ready for a siege. It was at this\r\nmoment that Guillaume Calviere, who was at the head of the Presidial\r\nCourt, Moget being president of the Consistory, and Captain Bouillargues\r\ncommander-in-chief of the armed forces, suddenly resolved to create a\r\nnew authority, which, while sharing the powers hitherto vested solely in\r\nthe consuls, should be, even more than they, devoted to Calvin: thus the\r\noffice of les Messieurs came into being. This was neither more nor less\r\nthan a committee of public safety, and having been formed in the stress\r\nof revolution it acted in a revolutionary spirit, absorbing the powers\r\nof the consuls, and restricting the authority of the Consistory to\r\nthings spiritual. In the meantime the Edict of Amboise, was promulgated,\r\nand it was announced that the king, Charles IX, accompanied by Catherine\r\nde Medicis, was going to visit his loyal provinces in the South.\r\n\r\nDetermined as was Captain Bouillargues, for once he had to give way, so\r\nstrong was the party against him; therefore, despite the murmurs of the\r\nfanatics, the city of Nimes resolved, not only to open its gates to its\r\nsovereign, but to give him such a reception as would efface the bad\r\nimpression which Charles might have received from the history of recent\r\nevents. The royal procession was met at the Pont du Gare, where young\r\ngirls attired as nymphs emerged from a grotto bearing a collation, which\r\nthey presented to their Majesties, who graciously and heartily partook\r\nof it. The repast at an end, the illustrious travellers resumed their\r\nprogress; but the imagination of the Nimes authorities was not to be\r\nrestrained within such narrow bounds: at the entrance to the city the\r\nking found the Porte de la Couronne transformed into a mountain-side,\r\ncovered with vines and olive trees, under which a shepherd was tending\r\nhis flock. As the king approached the mountain parted as if yielding to\r\nthe magic of his power, the most beautiful maidens and the most noble\r\ncame out to meet their sovereign, presenting him the keys of the city\r\nwreathed with flowers, and singing to the accompaniment of the\r\nshepherd’s pipe. Passing through the mountain, Charles saw chained to a\r\npalm tree in the depths of a grotto a monster crocodile from whose jaws\r\nissued flames: this was a representation of the old coat of arms granted\r\nto the city by Octavius Caesar Augustus after the battle of Actium, and\r\nwhich Francis I had restored to it in exchange for a model in silver of\r\nthe amphitheatre presented to him by the city. Lastly, the king found in\r\nthe Place de la Salamandre numerous bonfires, so that without waiting to\r\nask if these fires were made from the remains of the faggots used at the\r\nmartyrdom of Maurice Secenat, he went to bed very much pleased with the\r\nreception accorded him by his good city of Nimes, and sure that all the\r\nunfavourable reports he had heard were calumnies.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in order that such rumours, however slight their\r\nfoundation, should not again be heard, the king appointed Damville\r\ngovernor of Languedoc, installing him himself in the chief city of his\r\ngovernment; he then removed every consul from his post without\r\nexception, and appointed in their place Guy-Rochette, doctor and lawyer;\r\nJean Beaudan, burgess; Francois Aubert, mason; and Cristol Ligier, farm\r\nlabourer—all Catholics. He then left for Paris, where a short time after\r\nhe concluded a treaty with the Calvinists, which the people with its\r\ngift of prophecy called \"The halting peace of unsure seat,\" and which in\r\nthe end led to the massacre of St. Bartholomew.\r\n\r\nGracious as had been the measures taken by the king to secure the peace\r\nof his good city of Nimes, they had nevertheless been reactionary;\r\nconsequently the Catholics, feeling the authorities were now on their\r\nside, returned in crowds: the householders reclaimed their houses, the\r\npriests their churches; while, rendered ravenous by the bitter bread of\r\nexile, both the clergy and the laity pillaged the treasury. Their return\r\nwas not, however; stained by bloodshed, although the Calvinists were\r\nreviled in the open street. A few stabs from a dagger or shots from an\r\narquebus might, however, have been better; such wounds heal while\r\nmocking words rankle in the memory.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow of Michaelmas Day—that is, on the 31st September 1567—a\r\nnumber of conspirators might have been seen issuing from a house and\r\nspreading themselves through the streets, crying \"To arms! Down with the\r\nPapists!\" Captain Bouillargues was taking his revenge.\r\n\r\nAs the Catholics were attacked unawares, they did not make even a show\r\nof resistance: a number of Protestants—those who possessed the best\r\narms—rushed to the house of Guy-Rochette, the first consul, and seized\r\nthe keys of the city. Guy Rochette, startled by the cries of the crowds,\r\nhad looked out of the window, and seeing a furious mob approaching his\r\nhouse, and feeling that their rage was directed against himself, had\r\ntaken refuge with his brother Gregoire. There, recovering his courage\r\nand presence of mind, he recalled the important responsibilities\r\nattached to his office, and resolving to fulfil them whatever might\r\nhappen, hastened to consult with the other magistrates, but as they all\r\ngave him very excellent reasons for not meddling, he soon felt there was\r\nno dependence to be placed on such cowards and traitors. He next\r\nrepaired to the episcopal palace, where he found the bishop surrounded\r\nby the principal Catholics of the town, all on their knees offering up\r\nearnest prayers to Heaven, and awaiting martyrdom. Guy-Rochette joined\r\nthem, and the prayers were continued.\r\n\r\nA few instants later fresh noises were heard in the street, and the\r\ngates of the palace court groaned under blows of axe and crowbar.\r\nHearing these alarming sounds, the bishop, forgetting that it was his\r\nduty to set a brave example, fled through a breach in the wall of the\r\nnext house; but Guy-Rochette and his companions valiantly resolved not\r\nto run away, but to await their fate with patience. The gates soon\r\nyielded, and the courtyard and palace were filled with Protestants: at\r\ntheir head appeared Captain Bouillargues, sword in hand. Guy-Rochette\r\nand those with him were seized and secured in a room under the charge of\r\nfour guards, and the palace was looted. Meantime another band of\r\ninsurgents had attacked the house of the vicar-general, John Pebereau,\r\nwhose body pierced by seven stabs of a dagger was thrown out of a\r\nwindow, the same fate as was meted out to Admiral Coligny eight years\r\nlater at the hands of the Catholics. In the house a sum of 800 crowns\r\nwas found and taken. The two bands then uniting, rushed to the\r\ncathedral, which they sacked for the second time.\r\n\r\nThus the entire day passed in murder and pillage: when night came the\r\nlarge number of prisoners so imprudently taken began to be felt as an\r\nencumbrance by the insurgent chiefs, who therefore resolved to take\r\nadvantage of the darkness to get rid of them without causing too much\r\nexcitement in the city. They were therefore gathered together from the\r\nvarious houses in which they had been confined, and were brought to a\r\nlarge hall in the Hotel de Ville, capable of containing from four to\r\nfive hundred persons, and which was soon full. An irregular tribunal\r\narrogating to itself powers of life and death was formed, and a clerk\r\nwas appointed to register its decrees. A list of all the prisoners was\r\ngiven him, a cross placed before a name indicating that its bearer was\r\ncondemned to death, and, list in hand, he went from group to group\r\ncalling out the names distinguished by the fatal sign. Those thus sorted\r\nout were then conducted to a spot which had been chosen beforehand as\r\nthe place of execution.\r\n\r\nThis was the palace courtyard in the middle of which yawned a well\r\ntwenty-four feet in circumference and fifty deep. The fanatics thus\r\nfound a grave ready-digged as it were to their hand, and to save time,\r\nmade use of it.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Catholics, led thither in groups, were either stabbed\r\nwith daggers or mutilated with axes, and the bodies thrown down the\r\nwell. Guy-Rochette was one of the first to be dragged up. For himself he\r\nasked neither mercy nor favour, but he begged that the life of his young\r\nbrother might be spared, whose only crime was the bond of blood which\r\nunited them; but the assassins, paying no heed to his prayers, struck\r\ndown both man and boy and flung them into the well. The corpse of the\r\nvicar-general, who had been killed the day before, was in its turn\r\ndragged thither by a rope and added to the others. All night the\r\nmassacre went on, the crimsoned water rising in the well as corpse after\r\ncorpse was thrown in, till, at break of day, it overflowed, one hundred\r\nand twenty bodies being then hidden in its depths.\r\n\r\nNext day, October 1st, the scenes of tumult were renewed: from early\r\ndawn Captain Bouillargues ran from street to street crying, \"Courage,\r\ncomrades! Montpellier, Pezenas, Aramon, Beaucaire, Saint-Andeol, and\r\nVilleneuve are taken, and are on our side. Cardinal de Lorraine is dead,\r\nand the king is in our power.\" This aroused the failing energies of the\r\nassassins. They joined the captain, and demanded that the houses round\r\nthe palace should be searched, as it was almost certain that the bishop,\r\nwho had, as may be remembered, escaped the day before, had taken refuge\r\nin one of them. This being agreed to, a house-to-house visitation was\r\nbegun: when the house of M. de Sauvignargues was reached, he confessed\r\nthat the bishop was in his cellar, and proposed to treat with Captain\r\nBouillargues for a ransom. This proposition being considered reasonable,\r\nwas accepted, and after a short discussion the sum of 120 crowns was\r\nagreed on. The bishop laid down every penny he had about him, his\r\nservants were despoiled, and the sum made up by the Sieur de\r\nSauvignargues, who having the bishop in his house kept him caged. The\r\nprelate, however, made no objection, although under other circumstances\r\nhe would have regarded this restraint as the height of impertinence; but\r\nas it was he felt safer in M. de Sauvignargues’ cellar than in the\r\npalace.\r\n\r\nBut the secret of the worthy prelate’s hiding place was but badly kept\r\nby those with whom he had treated; for in a few moments a second crowd\r\nappeared, hoping to obtain a second ransom. Unfortunately, the Sieur de\r\nSauvignargues, the bishop, and the bishop’s servants had stripped\r\nthemselves of all their ready money to make up the first, so the master\r\nof the house, fearing for his own safety, having barricaded the doors,\r\ngot out into a lane and escaped, leaving the bishop to his fate. The\r\nHuguenots climbed in at the windows, crying, \"No quarter! Down with the\r\nPapists!\" The bishop’s servants were cut down, the bishop himself\r\ndragged out of the cellar and thrown into the street. There his rings\r\nand crozier were snatched from him; he was stripped of his clothes and\r\narrayed in a grotesque and ragged garment which chanced to be at hand;\r\nhis mitre was replaced by a peasant’s cap; and in this condition he was\r\ndragged back to the palace and placed on the brink of the well to be\r\nthrown in. One of the assassins drew attention to the fact that it was\r\nalready full. \"Pooh!\" replied another, \"they won’t mind a little\r\ncrowding for a bishop.\" Meantime the prelate, seeing he need expect no\r\nmercy from man, threw himself on his knees and commended his soul to\r\nGod. Suddenly, however, one of those who had shown himself most\r\nferocious during the massacre, Jean Coussinal by name, was touched as if\r\nby miracle with a feeling of compassion at the sight of so much\r\nresignation, and threw himself between the bishop and those about to\r\nstrike, and declaring that whoever touched the prelate must first\r\novercome himself, took him under his protection, his comrades retreating\r\nin astonishment. Jean Coussinal raising the bishop, carried him in his\r\narms into a neighbouring house, and drawing his sword, took his stand on\r\nthe threshold.\r\n\r\nThe assassins, however, soon recovered from their surprise, and\r\nreflecting that when all was said and done they were fifty to one,\r\nconsidered it would be shameful to let themselves be intimidated by a\r\nsingle opponent, so they advanced again on Coussinal, who with a\r\nback-handed stroke cut off the head of the first-comer. The cries upon\r\nthis redoubled, and two or three shots were fired at the obstinate\r\ndefender of the poor bishop, but they all missed aim. At that moment\r\nCaptain Bouillargues passed by, and seeing one man attacked by fifty,\r\ninquired into the cause. He was told of Coussinal’s odd determination to\r\nsave the bishop. \"He is quite right,\" said the captain; \"the bishop has\r\npaid ransom, and no one has any right to touch him.\" Saying this, he\r\nwalked up to Coussinal, gave him his hand, and the two entered the\r\nhouse, returning in a few moments with the bishop between them. In this\r\norder they crossed the town, followed by the murmuring crowd, who were,\r\nhowever, afraid to do more than murmur; at the gate the bishop was\r\nprovided with an escort and let go, his defenders remaining there till\r\nhe was out of sight.\r\n\r\nThe massacres went on during the whole of the second day, though towards\r\nevening the search for victims relaxed somewhat; but still many isolated\r\nacts of murder took place during the night. On the morrow, being tired\r\nof killing, the people began to destroy, and this phase lasted a long\r\ntime, it being less fatiguing to throw stones about than corpses. All\r\nthe convents, all the monasteries, all the houses of the priests and\r\ncanons were attacked in turn; nothing was spared except the cathedral,\r\nbefore which axes and crowbars seemed to lose their power, and the\r\nchurch of Ste. Eugenie, which was turned into a powder-magazine. The day\r\nof the great butchery was called \"La Michelade,\" because it took place\r\nthe day after Michaelmas, and as all this happened in the year 1567 the\r\nMassacre of St. Bartholomew must be regarded as a plagiarism.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, with the help of M. Damville; the Catholics again got\r\nthe upper hand, and it was the turn of the Protestants to fly. They took\r\nrefuge in the Cevennes. From the beginning of the troubles the Cevennes\r\nhad been the asylum of those who suffered for the Protestant faith; and\r\nstill the plains are Papist, and the mountains Protestant. When the\r\nCatholic party is in the ascendant at Nimes, the plain seeks the\r\nmountain; when the Protestants come into power, the mountain comes down\r\ninto the plain.\r\n\r\nHowever, vanquished and fugitive though they were, the Calvinists did\r\nnot lose courage: in exile one day, they felt sure their luck would turn\r\nthe next; and while the Catholics were burning or hanging them in effigy\r\nfor contumacy, they were before a notary, dividing the property of their\r\nexecutioners.\r\n\r\nBut it was not enough for them to buy or sell this property amongst each\r\nother, they wanted to enter into possession; they thought of nothing\r\nelse, and in 1569—that is, in the eighteenth month of their exile—they\r\nattained their wish in the following manner:\r\n\r\nOne day the exiles perceived a carpenter belonging to a little village\r\ncalled Cauvisson approaching their place of refuge. He desired to speak\r\nto M. Nicolas de Calviere, seigneur de St. Cosme, and brother of the\r\npresident, who was known to be a very enterprising man. To him the\r\ncarpenter, whose name was Maduron, made the following proposition:\r\n\r\nIn the moat of Nimes, close to the Gate of the Carmelites, there was a\r\ngrating through which the waters from the fountain found vent. Maduron\r\noffered to file through the bars of this grating in such a manner that\r\nsome fine night it could be lifted out so as to allow a band of armed\r\nProtestants to gain access to the city. Nicolas de Calviere approving of\r\nthis plan, desired that it should be carried out at once; but the\r\ncarpenter pointed out that it would be necessary to wait for stormy\r\nweather, when the waters swollen by the rain would by their noise drown\r\nthe sound of the file. This precaution was doubly necessary as the box\r\nof the sentry was almost exactly above the grating. M. de Calviere tried\r\nto make Maduron give way; but the latter, who was risking more than\r\nanyone else, was firm. So whether they liked it or not, de Calviere and\r\nthe rest had to await his good pleasure.\r\n\r\nSome days later rainy weather set in, and as usual the fountain became\r\nfuller; Maduron seeing that the favourable moment had arrived, glided at\r\nnight into the moat and applied his file, a friend of his who was hidden\r\non the ramparts above pulling a cord attached to Maduron’s arm every\r\ntime the sentinel, in pacing his narrow round, approached the spot.\r\nBefore break of day the work was well begun. Maduron then obliterated\r\nall traces of his file by daubing the bars with mud and wax, and\r\nwithdrew. For three consecutive nights he returned to his task, taking\r\nthe same precautions, and before the fourth was at an end he found that\r\nby means of a slight effort the grating could be removed. That was all\r\nthat was needed, so he gave notice to Messire Nicolas de Calviere that\r\nthe moment had arrived.\r\n\r\nEverything was favourable to the undertaking: as there was no moon, the\r\nnext night was chosen to carry out the plan, and as soon as it was dark\r\nMessire Nicolas de Calviere set out with his men, who, slipping down\r\ninto the moat without noise, crossed, the water being up to their belts,\r\nclimbed up the other side, and crept along at the foot of the wall till\r\nthey reached the grating without being perceived. There Maduron was\r\nwaiting, and as soon as he caught sight of them he gave a slight blow to\r\nthe loose bars; which fell, and the whole party entered the drain, led\r\nby de Calviere, and soon found themselves at the farther end—that is to\r\nsay, in the Place de la Fontaine. They immediately formed into companies\r\ntwenty strong, four of which hastened to the principal gates, while the\r\nothers patrolled the streets shouting, \"The city taken! Down with the\r\nPapists! A new world!\" Hearing this, the Protestants in the city\r\nrecognised their co-religionists, and the Catholics their opponents: but\r\nwhereas the former had been warned and were on the alert, the latter\r\nwere taken by surprise; consequently they offered no resistance, which,\r\nhowever, did not prevent bloodshed. M. de St. Andre, the governor of the\r\ntown, who during his short period of office had drawn the bitter hatred\r\nof the Protestants on him, was shot dead in his bed, and his body being\r\nflung out of the window, was torn in pieces by the populace. The work of\r\nmurder went on all night, and on the morrow the victors in their turn\r\nbegan an organised persecution, which fell more heavily on the Catholics\r\nthan that to which they had subjected the Protestants; for, as we have\r\nexplained above, the former could only find shelter in the plain, while\r\nthe latter used the Cevennes as a stronghold.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that the peace, which was called, as we have\r\nsaid, \"the insecurely seated,\" was concluded. Two years later this name\r\nwas justified by the Massacre of St. Bartholomew.\r\n\r\nWhen this event took place, the South, strange as it may seem, looked\r\non: in Nimes both Catholics and Protestants, stained with the other’s\r\nblood, faced each other, hand on hilt, but without drawing weapon. It\r\nwas as if they were curious to see how the Parisians would get through.\r\nThe massacre had one result, however, the union of the principal cities\r\nof the South and West: Montpellier, Uzes, Montauban, and La Rochelle,\r\nwith Nimes at their head, formed a civil and military league to last, as\r\nis declared in the Act of Federation, until God should raise up a\r\nsovereign to be the defender of the Protestant faith. In the year 1775\r\nthe Protestants of the South began to turn their eyes towards Henri IV\r\nas the coming defender.\r\n\r\nAt that date Nimes, setting an example to the other cities of the\r\nLeague, deepened her moats, blew up her suburbs, and added to the height\r\nof her ramparts. Night and day the work of perfecting the means of\r\ndefence went on; the guard at every gate was doubled, and knowing how\r\noften a city had been taken by surprise, not a hole through which a\r\nPapist could creep was left in the fortifications. In dread of what the\r\nfuture might bring, Nimes even committed sacrilege against the past, and\r\npartly demolished the Temple of Diana and mutilated the amphitheatre—of\r\nwhich one gigantic stone was sufficient to form a section of the wall.\r\nDuring one truce the crops were sown, during another they were garnered\r\nin, and so things went on while the reign of the Mignons lasted. At\r\nlength the prince raised up by God, whom the Huguenots had waited for so\r\nlong, appeared; Henri IV ascended the, throne.\r\n\r\nBut once seated, Henri found himself in the same difficulty as had\r\nconfronted Octavius fifteen centuries earlier, and which confronted\r\nLouis Philippe three centuries later—that is to say, having been raised\r\nto sovereign power by a party which was not in the majority, he soon\r\nfound himself obliged to separate from this party and to abjure his\r\nreligious beliefs, as others have abjured or will yet abjure their\r\npolitical beliefs; consequently, just as Octavius had his Antony, and\r\nLouis Philippe was to have his Lafayette, Henri IV was to have his\r\nBiron. When monarchs are in this position they can no longer have a will\r\nof their own or personal likes and dislikes; they submit to the force of\r\ncircumstances, and feel compelled to rely on the masses; no sooner are\r\nthey freed from the ban under which they laboured than they are obliged\r\nto bring others under it.\r\n\r\nHowever, before having recourse to extreme measures, Henri IV with\r\nsoldierly frankness gathered round him all those who had been his\r\ncomrades of old in war and in religion; he spread out before them a map\r\nof France, and showed them that hardly a tenth of the immense number of\r\nits inhabitants were Protestants, and that even that tenth was shut up\r\nin the mountains; some in Dauphine, which had been won for them by their\r\nthree principal leaders, Baron des Adrets, Captain Montbrun, and\r\nLesdiguieres; others in the Cevennes, which had become Protestant\r\nthrough their great preachers, Maurice Secenat and Guillaume Moget; and\r\nthe rest in the mountains of Navarre, whence he himself had come. He\r\nrecalled to them further that whenever they ventured out of their\r\nmountains they had been beaten in every battle, at Jarnac, at\r\nMoncontour, and at Dreux. He concluded by explaining how impossible it\r\nwas for him, such being the case, to entrust the guidance of the State\r\nto their party; but he offered them instead three things, viz., his\r\npurse to supply their present needs, the Edict of Nantes to assure their\r\nfuture safety, and fortresses to defend themselves should this edict one\r\nday be revoked, for with profound insight the grandfather divined the\r\ngrandson: Henri IV feared Louis XIV.\r\n\r\nThe Protestants took what they were offered, but of course like all who\r\naccept benefits they went away filled with discontent because they had\r\nnot been given more.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Protestants ever afterwards looked on Henri IV as a\r\nrenegade, his reign nevertheless was their golden age, and while it\r\nlasted Nimes was quiet; for, strange to say, the Protestants took no\r\nrevenge for St. Bartholomew, contenting themselves with debarring the\r\nCatholics from the open exercise of their religion, but leaving them\r\nfree to use all its rites and ceremonies in private. They even permitted\r\nthe procession of the Host through the streets in case of illness,\r\nprovided it took place at night. Of course death would not always wait\r\nfor darkness, and the Host was sometimes carried to the dying during the\r\nday, not without danger to the priest, who, however, never let himself\r\nbe deterred thereby from the performance of his duty; indeed, it is of\r\nthe essence of religious devotion to be inflexible; and few soldiers,\r\nhowever brave, have equalled the martyrs in courage.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, taking advantage of the truce to hostilities and the\r\nimpartial protection meted out to all without distinction by the\r\nConstable Damville, the Carmelites and Capuchins, the Jesuits and monks\r\nof all orders and colours, began by degrees to return to Nimes; without\r\nany display, it is true, rather in a surreptitious manner, preferring\r\ndarkness to daylight; but however this may be, in the course of three or\r\nfour years they had all regained foothold in the town; only now they\r\nwere in the position in which the Protestants had been formerly, they\r\nwere without churches, as their enemies were in possession of all the\r\nplaces of worship. It also happened that a Jesuit high in authority,\r\nnamed Pere Coston, preached with such success that the Protestants, not\r\nwishing to be beaten, but desirous of giving word for word, summoned to\r\ntheir aid the Rev. Jeremie Ferrier, of Alais, who at the moment was\r\nregarded as the most eloquent preacher they had. Needless to say, Alais\r\nwas situated in the mountains, that inexhaustible source of Huguenot\r\neloquence. At once the controversial spirit was aroused; it did not as\r\nyet amount to war, but still less could it be called peace: people were\r\nno longer assassinated, but they were anathematised; the body was safe,\r\nbut the soul was consigned to damnation: the days as they passed were\r\nused by both sides to keep their hand in, in readiness for the moment\r\nwhen the massacres should again begin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nThe death of Henri IV led to new conflicts, in which although at first\r\nsuccess was on the side of the Protestants it by degrees went over to\r\nthe Catholics; for with the accession of Louis XIII Richelieu had taken\r\npossession of the throne: beside the king sat the cardinal; under the\r\npurple mantle gleamed the red robe. It was at this crisis that Henri de\r\nRohan rose to eminence in the South. He was one of the most illustrious\r\nrepresentatives of that great race which, allied as it was to the royal\r\nhouses of Scotland, France, Savoy, and Lorraine; had taken as their\r\ndevice, \"Be king I cannot, prince I will not, Rohan I am.\"\r\n\r\nHenri de Rohan was at this time about forty years of age, in the prime\r\nof life. In his youth, in order to perfect his education, he had visited\r\nEngland, Scotland, and Italy. In England Elizabeth had called him her\r\nknight; in Scotland James VI had asked him to stand godfather to his\r\nson, afterwards Charles I; in Italy he had been so deep in the\r\nconfidence of the leaders of men, and so thoroughly initiated into the\r\npolitics of the principal cities, that it was commonly said that, after\r\nMachiavel, he was the greatest authority in these matters. He had\r\nreturned to France in the lifetime of Henry IV, and had married the\r\ndaughter of Sully, and after Henri’s death had commanded the Swiss and\r\nthe Grison regiments—at the siege of Juliers. This was the man whom the\r\nking was so imprudent as to offend by refusing him the reversion of the\r\noffice of governor of Poitou, which was then held by Sully, his\r\nfather-in-law. In order to revenge himself for the neglect he met with\r\nat court, as he states in his Memoires with military ingenuousness, he\r\nespoused the cause of Conde with all his heart, being also drawn in this\r\ndirection by his liking for Conde’s brother and his consequent desire to\r\nhelp those of Conde’s religion.\r\n\r\nFrom this day on street disturbances and angry disputes assumed another\r\naspect: they took in a larger area and were not so readily appeased. It\r\nwas no longer an isolated band of insurgents which roused a city, but\r\nrather a conflagration which spread over the whole South, and a general\r\nuprising which was almost a civil war.\r\n\r\nThis state of things lasted for seven or eight years, and during this\r\ntime Rohan, abandoned by Chatillon and La Force, who received as the\r\nreward of their defection the field marshal’s baton, pressed by Conde,\r\nhis old friend, and by Montmorency, his consistent rival, performed\r\nprodigies of courage and miracles of strategy. At last, without\r\nsoldiers, without ammunition, without money, he still appeared to\r\nRichelieu to be so redoubtable that all the conditions of surrender he\r\ndemanded were granted. The maintenance of the Edict of Nantes was\r\nguaranteed, all the places of worship were to be restored to the\r\nReformers, and a general amnesty granted to himself and his partisans.\r\nFurthermore, he obtained what was an unheard-of thing until then, an\r\nindemnity of 300,000 livres for his expenses during the rebellion; of\r\nwhich sum he allotted 240,000 livres to his co-religionists—that is to\r\nsay, more than three-quarters of the entire amount—and kept, for the\r\npurpose of restoring his various chateaux and setting his domestic\r\nestablishment, which had been destroyed during the war, again on foot,\r\nonly 60,000 livres. This treaty was signed on July 27th, 1629.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Richelieu, to whom no sacrifice was too great in order to\r\nattain his ends, had at last reached the goal, but the peace cost him\r\nnearly 40,000,000 livres; on the other hand, Saintonge, Poitou, and\r\nLanguedoc had submitted, and the chiefs of the houses of La Tremouille,\r\nConde, Bouillon, Rohan, and Soubise had came to terms with him;\r\norganised armed opposition had disappeared, and the lofty manner of\r\nviewing matters natural to the cardinal duke prevented him from noticing\r\nprivate enmity. He therefore left Nimes free to manage her local affairs\r\nas she pleased, and very soon the old order, or rather disorder, reigned\r\nonce more within her walls. At last Richelieu died, and Louis XIII soon\r\nfollowed him, and the long minority of his successor, with its\r\nembarrassments, left to Catholics and Protestants in the South more\r\ncomplete liberty than ever to carry on the great duel which down to our\r\nown days has never ceased.\r\n\r\nBut from this period, each flux and reflux bears more and more the\r\npeculiar character of the party which for the moment is triumphant; when\r\nthe Protestants get the upper hand, their vengeance is marked by\r\nbrutality and rage; when the Catholics are victorious, the retaliation\r\nis full of hypocrisy and greed. The Protestants pull down churches and\r\nmonasteries, expel the monks, burn the crucifixes, take the body of some\r\ncriminal from the gallows, nail it on a cross, pierce its side, put a\r\ncrown of thorns round its temples and set it up in the market-place—an\r\neffigy of Jesus on Calvary. The Catholics levy contributions, take back\r\nwhat they had been deprived of, exact indemnities, and although ruined\r\nby each reverse, are richer than ever after each victory. The\r\nProtestants act in the light of day, melting down the church bells to\r\nmake cannon to the sound of the drum, violate agreements, warm\r\nthemselves with wood taken from the houses of the cathedral clergy,\r\naffix their theses to the cathedral doors, beat the priests who carry\r\nthe Holy Sacrament to the dying, and, to crown all other insults, turn\r\nchurches into slaughter-houses and sewers.\r\n\r\nThe Catholics, on the contrary, march at night, and, slipping in at the\r\ngates which have been left ajar for them, make their bishop president of\r\nthe Council, put Jesuits at the head of the college, buy converts with\r\nmoney from the treasury, and as they always have influence at court,\r\nbegin by excluding the Calvinists from favour, hoping soon to deprive\r\nthem of justice.\r\n\r\nAt last, on the 31st of December, 1657, a final struggle took place, in\r\nwhich the Protestants were overcome, and were only saved from\r\ndestruction because from the other side of the Channel, Cromwell exerted\r\nhimself in their favour, writing with his own hand at the end of a\r\ndespatch relative to the affairs of Austria, \"I Learn that there have\r\nbeen popular disturbances in a town of Languedoc called Nimes, and I beg\r\nthat order may be restored with as much mildness as possible, and\r\nwithout shedding of blood.\" As, fortunately for the Protestants, Mazarin\r\nhad need of Cromwell at that moment, torture was forbidden, and nothing\r\nallowed but annoyances of all kinds. These henceforward were not only\r\ninnumerable, but went on without a pause: the Catholics, faithful to\r\ntheir system of constant encroachment, kept up an incessant persecution,\r\nin which they were soon encouraged by the numerous ordinances issued by\r\nLouis XIV. The grandson of Henri IV could not so far forget all ordinary\r\nrespect as to destroy at once the Edict of Nantes, but he tore off\r\nclause after clause.\r\n\r\nIn 1630—that is, a year after the peace with Rohan had been signed in\r\nthe preceding reign—Chalons-sur-Saone had resolved that no Protestant\r\nshould be allowed to take any part in the manufactures of the town.\r\n\r\nIn 1643, six months after the accession of Louis XIV, the laundresses of\r\nParis made a rule that the wives and daughters of Protestants were\r\nunworthy to be admitted to the freedom of their respectable guild.\r\n\r\nIn 1654, just one year after he had attained his majority, Louis XIV\r\nconsented to the imposition of a tax on the town of Nimes of 4000 francs\r\ntowards the support of the Catholic and the Protestant hospitals; and\r\ninstead of allowing each party to contribute to the support of its own\r\nhospital, the money was raised in one sum, so that, of the money paid by\r\nthe Protestants, who were twice as numerous as the Catholics, two-sixths\r\nwent to their enemies. On August 9th of the same year a decree of the\r\nCouncil ordered that all the artisan consuls should be Catholics; on the\r\n16th September another decree forbade Protestants to send deputations to\r\nthe king; lastly, on the 20th of December, a further decree declared\r\nthat all hospitals should be administered by Catholic consuls alone.\r\n\r\nIn 1662 Protestants were commanded to bury their dead either at dawn or\r\nafter dusk, and a special clause of the decree fixed the number of\r\npersons who might attend a funeral at ten only.\r\n\r\nIn 1663 the Council of State issued decrees prohibiting the practice of\r\ntheir religion by the Reformers in one hundred and forty-two communes in\r\nthe dioceses of Nimes, Uzes, and Mendes; and ordering the demolition of\r\ntheir meetinghouses.\r\n\r\nIn 1664 this regulation was extended to the meeting-houses of Alencon\r\nand Montauban, as Well as their small place of worship in Nimes. On the\r\n17th July of the same year the Parliament of Rouen forbade the\r\nmaster-mercers to engage any more Protestant workmen or apprentices when\r\nthe number already employed had reached the proportion of one\r\nProtestant, to fifteen Catholics; on the 24th of the same month the\r\nCouncil of State declared all certificates of mastership held by a\r\nProtestant invalid from whatever source derived; and in October reduced\r\nto two the number of Protestants who might be employed at the mint.\r\n\r\nIn 1665 the regulation imposed on the mercers was extended to the\r\ngoldsmiths.\r\n\r\nIn 1666 a royal declaration, revising the decrees of Parliament, was\r\npublished, and Article 31 provided that the offices of clerk to the\r\nconsulates, or secretary to a guild of watchmakers, or porter in a\r\nmunicipal building, could only be held by Catholics; while in Article 33\r\nit was ordained that when a procession carrying the Host passed a place\r\nof worship belonging to the so-called Reformers, the worshippers should\r\nstop their psalm-singing till the procession had gone by; and lastly, in\r\nArticle 34 it was enacted that the houses and other buildings belonging\r\nto those who were of the Reformed religion might, at the pleasure of the\r\ntown authorities, be draped with cloth or otherwise decorated on any\r\nreligious Catholic festival.\r\n\r\nIn 1669 the Chambers appointed by the Edict of Nantes in the Parliaments\r\nof Rouen and Paris were suppressed, as well as the articled clerkships\r\nconnected therewith, and the clerkships in the Record Office; and in\r\nAugust of the same year, when the emigration of Protestants was just\r\nbeginning, an edict was issued, of which the following is a clause:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas many of our subjects have gone to foreign countries, where they\r\ncontinue to follow their various trades and occupations, even working as\r\nshipwrights, or taking service as sailors, till at length they feel at\r\nhome and determine never to return to France, marrying abroad and\r\nacquiring property of every description: We hereby forbid any member of\r\nthe so-called Reformed Church to leave this kingdom without our\r\npermission, and we command those who have already left France to return\r\nforthwith within her boundaries.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1670 the king excluded physicians of the Reformed faith from the\r\noffice of dean of the college of Rouen, and allowed only two Protestant\r\ndoctors within its precincts. In 1671 a decree was published commanding\r\nthe arms of France to be removed from all the places of worship\r\nbelonging to the pretended Reformers. In 1680 a proclamation from the\r\nking closed the profession of midwife to women of the Reformed faith. In\r\n1681 those who renounced the Protestant religion were exempted for two\r\nyears from all contributions towards the support of soldiers sent to\r\ntheir town, and were for the same period relieved from the duty of\r\ngiving them board and lodging. In the same year the college of Sedan was\r\nclosed—the only college remaining in the entire kingdom at which\r\nCalvinist children could receive instruction. In 1682 the king commanded\r\nProtestant notaries; procurators, ushers, and serjeants to lay down\r\ntheir offices, declaring them unfit for such professions; and in\r\nSeptember of the same year three months only were allowed them for the\r\nsale of the reversion of the said offices. In 1684 the Council of State\r\nextended the preceding regulations to those Protestants holding the\r\ntitle of honorary secretary to the king, and in August of the same year\r\nProtestants were declared incapable of serving on a jury of experts.\r\n\r\nIn 1685 the provost of merchants in Paris ordered all Protestant\r\nprivileged merchants in that city to sell their privileges within a\r\nmonth. And in October of the same year the long series of persecutions,\r\nof which we have omitted many, reached its culminating point—the:\r\nRevocation of the Edict of Nantes. Henri IV, who foresaw this result,\r\nhad hoped that it would have occurred in another manner, so that his\r\nco-religionists would have been able to retain their fortresses; but\r\nwhat was actually done was that the strong places were first taken away,\r\nand then came the Revocation; after which the Calvinists found\r\nthemselves completely at the mercy of their mortal enemies.\r\n\r\nFrom 1669, when Louis first threatened to aim a fatal blow at the civil\r\nrights of the Huguenots, by abolishing the equal partition of the\r\nChambers between the two parties, several deputations had been sent to\r\nhim praying him to stop the course of his persecutions; and in order not\r\nto give him any fresh excuse for attacking their party, these\r\ndeputations addressed him in the most submissive manner, as the\r\nfollowing fragment from an address will prove:\r\n\r\n\"In the name of God, sire,\" said the Protestants to the king, \"listen to\r\nthe last breath of our dying liberty, have pity on our sufferings, have\r\npity on the great number of your poor subjects who daily water their\r\nbread with their tears: they are all filled with burning zeal and\r\ninviolable loyalty to you; their love for your august person is only\r\nequalled by their respect; history bears witness that they contributed\r\nin no small degree to place your great and magnanimous ancestor on his\r\nrightful throne, and since your miraculous birth they have never done\r\nanything worthy of blame; they might indeed use much stronger terms, but\r\nyour Majesty has spared their modesty by addressing to them on many\r\noccasions words of praise which they would never have ventured to apply\r\nto themselves; these your subjects place their sole trust in your\r\nsceptre for refuge and protection on earth, and their interest as well\r\nas their duty and conscience impels them to remain attached to the\r\nservice of your Majesty with unalterable devotion.\"\r\n\r\nBut, as we have seen, nothing could restrain the triumvirate which held\r\nthe power just then, and thanks to the suggestions of Pere Lachaise and\r\nMadame de Maintenon, Louis XIV determined to gain heaven by means of\r\nwheel and stake.\r\n\r\nAs we see, for the Protestants, thanks to these numerous decrees,\r\npersecution began at the cradle and followed them to the grave.\r\n\r\nAs a boy, a Huguenot could—enter no public school; as a youth, no career\r\nwas open to him; he could become neither mercer nor concierge, neither\r\napothecary nor physician, neither lawyer nor consul. As a man, he had no\r\nsacred house, of prayer; no registrar would inscribe his marriage or the\r\nbirth of his children; hourly his liberty and his conscience were\r\nignored. If he ventured to worship God by the singing of psalms, he had\r\nto be silent as the Host was carried past outside. When a Catholic\r\nfestival occurred, he was forced not only to swallow his rage but to let\r\nhis house be hung with decorations in sign of joy; if he had inherited a\r\nfortune from his fathers, having neither social standing nor civil\r\nrights, it slipped gradually out of his hands, and went to support the\r\nschools and hospitals of his foes. Having reached the end of his life,\r\nhis deathbed was made miserable; for dying in the faith of his fathers,\r\nhe could not be laid to rest beside them, and like a pariah he would be\r\ncarried to his grave at night, no more than ten of those near and dear\r\nto him being allowed to follow his coffin.\r\n\r\nLastly, if at any age whatever he should attempt to quit the cruel soil\r\non which he had no right to be born, to live, or to die, he would be\r\ndeclared a rebel, his goods would be confiscated, and the lightest\r\npenalty that he had to expect, if he ever fell into the hands of his\r\nenemies, was to row for the rest of his life in the galleys of the king,\r\nchained between a murderer and a forger.\r\n\r\nSuch a state of things was intolerable: the cries of one man are lost in\r\nspace, but the groans of a whole population are like a storm; and this\r\ntime, as always, the tempest gathered in the mountains, and the\r\nrumblings of the thunder began to be heard.\r\n\r\nFirst there were texts written by invisible hands on city walls, on the\r\nsignposts and cross-roads, on the crosses in the cemeteries: these\r\nwarnings, like the ’Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin’ of Belshazzar, even\r\npursued the persecutors into the midst of their feasts and orgies.\r\n\r\nNow it was the threat, \"Jesus came not to send peace, but a sword.\" Then\r\nthis consolation, \"For where two or three are gathered together in My\r\nname, there am I in the midst of them.\" Or perhaps it was this appeal\r\nfor united action which was soon to become a summons to revolt, \"That\r\nwhich we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have\r\nfellowship with us.\"\r\n\r\nAnd before these promises, taken from the New Testament, the persecuted\r\npaused, and then went home inspired by faith in the prophets, who spake,\r\nas St. Paul says in his First Epistle to the Thessalonians, \"not the\r\nword of men but the word of God.\"\r\n\r\nVery soon these words became incarnate, and what the prophet Joel\r\nforetold came to pass: \"Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,\r\nyour old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions,...\r\nand I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood and\r\nfire,... and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name\r\nof the Lord shall be delivered.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1696 reports began to circulate that men had had visions; being able\r\nto see what was going on in the most distant parts, and that the heavens\r\nthemselves opened to their eyes. While in this ecstatic state they were\r\ninsensible to pain when pricked with either pin or blade; and when, on\r\nrecovering consciousness, they were questioned they could remember\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nThe first of these was a woman from Vivarais, whose origin was unknown.\r\nShe went about from town to town, shedding tears of blood. M. de\r\nBaville, intendant of Languedoc, had her arrested and brought to\r\nMontpellier. There she was condemned to death and burnt at the stake,\r\nher tears of blood being dried by fire.\r\n\r\nAfter her came a second fanatic, for so these popular prophets were\r\ncalled. He was born at Mazillon, his name was Laquoite, and he was\r\ntwenty years of age. The gift of prophecy had come to him in a strange\r\nmanner. This is the story told about him:—\"One day, returning from\r\nLanguedoc, where he had been engaged in the cultivation of silkworms, on\r\nreaching the bottom of the hill of St. Jean he found a man lying on the\r\nground trembling in every limb. Moved by pity, he stopped and asked what\r\nailed him. The man replied, ’Throw yourself on your knees, my son, and\r\ntrouble not yourself about me, but learn how to attain salvation and\r\nsave your brethren. This can only be done by the communion of the Holy\r\nGhost, who is in me, and whom by the grace of God I can bestow on you.\r\nApproach and receive this gift in a kiss.’ At these words the unknown\r\nkissed the young man on the mouth, pressed his hand and disappeared,\r\nleaving the other trembling in his turn; for the spirit of God was in\r\nhim, and being inspired he spread the word abroad.\"\r\n\r\nA third fanatic, a prophetess, raved about the parishes of St. Andeol de\r\nClerguemont and St. Frazal de Vantalon, but she addressed herself\r\nprincipally to recent converts, to whom she preached concerning the\r\nEucharist that in swallowing the consecrated wafer they had swallowed a\r\npoison as venomous as the head of the basilisk, that they had bent the\r\nknee to Baal, and that no penitence on their part could be great enough\r\nto save them. These doctrines inspired such profound terror that the\r\nRev. Father Louvreloeil himself tells us that Satan by his efforts\r\nsucceeded in nearly emptying the churches, and that at the following\r\nEaster celebrations there were only half as many communicants as the\r\npreceding year.\r\n\r\nSuch a state of licence, which threatened to spread farther and farther,\r\nawoke the religious solicitude of Messire Francois Langlade de Duchayla,\r\nPrior of Laval, Inspector of Missions of Gevaudan, and Arch-priest of\r\nthe Cevennes. He therefore resolved to leave his residence at Mende and\r\nto visit the parishes in which heresy had taken the strongest hold, in\r\norder to oppose it by every mean’s which God and the king had put in his\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThe Abbe Duchayla was a younger son of the noble house of Langlade, and\r\nby the circumstances of his birth, in spite of his soldierly instincts,\r\nhad been obliged to leave epaulet and sword to his elder brother, and\r\nhimself assume cassock and stole. On leaving the seminary, he espoused\r\nthe cause of the Church militant with all the ardour of his temperament.\r\nPerils to encounter; foes to fight, a religion to force on others, were\r\nnecessities to this fiery character, and as everything at the moment was\r\nquiet in France, he had embarked for India with the fervent resolution\r\nof a martyr.\r\n\r\nOn reaching his destination, the young missionary had found himself\r\nsurrounded by circumstances which were wonderfully in harmony with his\r\ncelestial longings: some of his predecessors had been carried so far by\r\nreligious zeal that the King of Siam had put several to death by torture\r\nand had forbidden any more missionaries to enter his dominions; but\r\nthis, as we can easily imagine, only excited still more the abbe’s\r\nmissionary fervour; evading the watchfulness of the military, and\r\nregardless of the terrible penalties imposed by the king, he crossed the\r\nfrontier, and began to preach the Catholic religion to the heathen, many\r\nof whom were converted.\r\n\r\nOne day he was surprised by a party of soldiers in a little village in\r\nwhich he had been living for three months, and in which nearly all the\r\ninhabitants had abjured their false faith, and was brought before the\r\ngovernor of Bankan, where instead of denying his faith, he nobly\r\ndefended Christianity and magnified the name of God. He was handed over\r\nto the executioners to be subjected to torture, and suffered at their\r\nhands with resignation everything that a human body can endure while yet\r\nretaining life, till at length his patience exhausted their rage; and\r\nseeing him become unconscious, they thought he was dead, and with\r\nmutilated hands, his breast furrowed with wounds, his limbs half worn\r\nthrough by heavy fetters, he was suspended by the wrists to a branch of\r\na tree and abandoned. A pariah passing by cut him down and succoured\r\nhim, and reports of his martyrdom having spread, the French ambassador\r\ndemanded justice with no uncertain voice, so that the King of Siam,\r\nrejoicing that the executioners had stopped short in time, hastened to\r\nsend back to M. de Chaumont, the representative of Louis XIV, a\r\nmutilated though still living man, instead of the corpse which had been\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\nAt the time when Louis XIV was meditating the Revocation of the Edict of\r\nNantes he felt that the services of such a man would be invaluable to\r\nhim, so about 1632, Abbe Duchayla was recalled from India, and a year\r\nlater was sent to Mende, with the titles of Arch-priest of the Cevennes\r\nand Inspector of Missions.\r\n\r\nSoon the abbe, who had been so much persecuted, became a persecutor,\r\nshowing himself as insensible to the sufferings of others as he had been\r\ninflexible under his own. His apprenticeship to torture stood him in\r\nsuch good stead that he became an inventor, and not only did he enrich\r\nthe torture chamber by importing from India several scientifically\r\nconstructed machines, hitherto unknown in Europe, but he also designed\r\nmany others. People told with terror of reeds cut in the form of\r\nwhistles which the abbe pitilessly forced under the nails of malignants;\r\nof iron pincers for tearing out their beards, eyelashes, and eyebrows;\r\nof wicks steeped in oil and wound round the fingers of a victim’s hands,\r\nand then set on fire so as to form a pair of five-flamed candelabra; of\r\na case turning on a pivot in which a man who refused to be converted was\r\nsometimes shut up, the case being then made to revolve rapidly till the\r\nvictim lost consciousness; and lastly of fetters used when taking\r\nprisoners from one town to another, and brought to such perfection, that\r\nwhen they were on the prisoner could neither stand nor sit.\r\n\r\nEven the most fervent panegyrists of Abbe Duchayla spoke of him with\r\nbated breath, and, when he himself looked into his own heart and\r\nrecalled how often he had applied to the body the power to bind and\r\nloose which God had only given him over the soul, he was seized with\r\nstrange tremors, and falling on his knees with folded hands and bowed\r\nhead he remained for hours wrapt in thought, so motionless that were it\r\nnot for the drops of sweat which stood on his brow he might have been\r\ntaken for a marble statue of prayer over a tomb.\r\n\r\nMoreover, this priest by virtue of the powers with which he was\r\ninvested, and feeling that he had the authority of M. de Baville,\r\nintendant of Languedoc, and M. de Broglie, commander of the troops,\r\nbehind him, had done other terrible things.\r\n\r\nHe had separated children from father and mother, and had shut them up\r\nin religious houses, where they had been subjected to such severe\r\nchastisement, by way of making them do penance for the heresy of their\r\nparents, that many of them died under it.\r\n\r\nHe had forced his way into the chamber of the dying, not to bring\r\nconsolation but menaces; and bending over the bed, as if to keep back\r\nthe Angel of Death, he had repeated the words of the terrible decree\r\nwhich provided that in case of the death of a Huguenot without\r\nconversion, his memory should be persecuted, and his body, denied\r\nChristian burial, should be drawn on hurdles out of the city, and cast\r\non a dungheap.\r\n\r\nLastly, when with pious love children tried to shield their parents in\r\nthe death-agony from his threats, or dead from his justice, by carrying\r\nthem, dead or dying, to some refuge in which they might hope to draw\r\ntheir last breath in peace or to obtain Christian burial, he declared\r\nthat anyone who should open his door hospitably to such disobedience was\r\na traitor to religion, although among the heathen such pity would have\r\nbeen deemed worthy of an altar.\r\n\r\nSuch was the man raised up to punish, who went on his way, preceded by\r\nterror, accompanied by torture, and followed by death, through a country\r\nalready exhausted by long and bloody oppression, and where at every step\r\nhe trod on half repressed religious hate, which like a volcano was ever\r\nready to burst out afresh, but always prepared for martyrdom. Nothing\r\nheld him back, and years ago he had had his grave hollowed out in the\r\nchurch of St. Germain, choosing that church for his last long sleep\r\nbecause it had been built by Pope Urban IV when he was bishop of Mende.\r\n\r\nAbbe Duchayla extended his visitation over six months, during which\r\nevery day was marked by tortures and executions: several prophets were\r\nburnt at the stake; Francoise de Brez, she who had preached that the\r\nHost contained a more venomous poison than a basilisk’s head, was\r\nhanged; and Laquoite, who had been confined in the citadel of\r\nMontpellier, was on the point of being broken on the wheel, when on the\r\neve of his execution his cell was found empty. No one could ever\r\ndiscover how he escaped, and consequently his reputation rose higher\r\nthan ever, it being currently believed that, led by the Holy Spirit as\r\nSt. Peter by the angel, he had passed through the guards invisible to\r\nall, leaving his fetters behind.\r\n\r\nThis incomprehensible escape redoubled the severity of the Arch-priest,\r\ntill at last the prophets, feeling that their only chance of safety lay\r\nin getting rid of him, began to preach against him as Antichrist, and\r\nadvocate his death. The abbe was warned of this, but nothing could abate\r\nhis zeal. In France as in India, martyrdom was his longed-for goal, and\r\nwith head erect and unfaltering step he \"pressed toward the mark.\"\r\n\r\nAt last, on the evening of the 24th of July, two hundred conspirators\r\nmet in a wood on the top of a hill which overlooked the bridge of\r\nMontvert, near which was the Arch-priest’s residence. Their leader was a\r\nman named Laporte, a native of Alais, who had become a master-blacksmith\r\nin the pass of Deze. He was accompanied by an inspired man, a former\r\nwool-carder, born at Magistavols, Esprit Seguier by name. This man was,\r\nafter Laquoite, the most highly regarded of the twenty or thirty\r\nprophets who were at that moment going up and down the Cevennes in every\r\ndirection. The whole party was armed with scythes, halberts, and swords;\r\na few had even pistols and guns.\r\n\r\nOn the stroke of ten, the hour fixed for their departure, they all knelt\r\ndown and with uncovered heads began praying as fervently as if they were\r\nabout to perform some act most pleasing to God, and their prayers ended,\r\nthey marched down the hill to the town, singing psalms, and shouting\r\nbetween the verses to the townspeople to keep within their homes, and\r\nnot to look out of door or window on pain of death.\r\n\r\nThe abbe was in his oratory when he heard the mingled singing and\r\nshouting, and at the same moment a servant entered in great alarm,\r\ndespite the strict regulation of the Arch-priest that he was never to be\r\ninterrupted at his prayers. This man announced that a body of fanatics\r\nwas coming down the hill, but the abbe felt convinced that it was only\r\nan unorganised crowd which was going to try and carry off six prisoners,\r\nat that moment in the ’ceps.’ [ A terrible kind of stocks—a beam split\r\nin two, no notches being made for the legs: the victim’s legs were\r\nplaced between the two pieces of wood, which were then, by means of a\r\nvice at each end, brought gradually together. Translators Note.]\r\n\r\nThese prisoners were three young men and three girls in men’s clothes,\r\nwho had been seized just as they were about to emigrate. As the abbe was\r\nalways protected by a guard of soldiers, he sent for the officer in\r\ncommand and ordered him to march against, the fanatics and disperse\r\nthem. But the officer was spared the trouble of obeying, for the\r\nfanatics were already at hand. On reaching the gate of the courtyard he\r\nheard them outside, and perceived that they were making ready to burst\r\nit in. Judging of their numbers by the sound of their voices, he\r\nconsidered that far from attacking them, he would have enough to do in\r\npreparing for defence, consequently he bolted and barred the gate on the\r\ninside, and hastily erected a barricade under an arch leading to the\r\napartments of the abbe. Just as these preparations were complete, Esprit\r\nSeguier caught sight of a heavy beam of wood lying in a ditch; this was\r\nraised by a dozen men and used as a battering-ram to force in the gate,\r\nwhich soon showed a breach. Thus encouraged, the workers, cheered by the\r\nchants of their comrades, soon got the gate off the hinges, and thus the\r\noutside court was taken. The crowd then loudly demanded the release of\r\nthe prisoners, using dire threats.\r\n\r\nThe commanding officer sent to ask the abbe what he was to do; the abbe\r\nreplied that he was to fire on the conspirators. This imprudent order\r\nwas carried out; one of the fanatics was killed on the spot, and two\r\nwounded men mingled their groans with the songs and threats of their\r\ncomrades.\r\n\r\nThe barricade was next attacked, some using axes, others darting their\r\nswords and halberts through the crevices and killing those behind; as\r\nfor those who had firearms, they climbed on the shoulders of the others,\r\nand having fired at those below, saved themselves by tumbling down\r\nagain. At the head of the besiegers were Laporte and Esprit Seguier, one\r\nof whom had a father to avenge and the other a son, both of whom had\r\nbeen done to death by the abbe. They were not the only ones of the party\r\nwho were fired by the desire of vengeance; twelve or fifteen others were\r\nin the same position.\r\n\r\nThe abbe in his room listened to the noise of the struggle, and finding\r\nmatters growing serious, he gathered his household round him, and making\r\nthem kneel down, he told them to make their confession, that he might,\r\nby giving them absolution, prepare them for appearing before God. The\r\nsacred words had just been pronounced when the rioters drew near, having\r\ncarried the barricade, and driven the soldiers to take refuge in a hall\r\non the ground floor just under the Arch-priest’s room.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly, the assault was stayed, some of the men going to surround\r\nthe house, others setting out on a search for the prisoners. These were\r\neasily found, for judging by what they could hear that their brethren\r\nhad come to their rescue, they shouted as loudly as they could.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate creatures had already passed a whole week with their\r\nlegs caught and pressed by the cleft beams which formed these\r\ninexpressibly painful stocks. When the unfortunate victims were\r\nreleased, the fanatics screamed with rage at the sight of their swollen\r\nbodies and half-broken bones. None of the unhappy people were able to\r\nstand. The attack on the soldiers was renewed, and these being driven\r\nout of the lower hall, filled the staircase leading to the abbe’s\r\napartments, and offered such determined resistance that their assailants\r\nwere twice forced to fall back. Laporte, seeing two of his men killed\r\nand five or six wounded, called out loudly, \"Children of God, lay down\r\nyour arms: this way of going to work is too slow; let us burn the abbey\r\nand all in it. To work! to work!\" The advice was good, and they all\r\nhastened to follow it: benches, chairs, and furniture of all sorts were\r\nheaped up in the hall, a palliasse thrown on the top, and the pile\r\nfired. In a moment the whole building was ablaze, and the Arch-priest,\r\nyielding to the entreaties of his servants, fastened his sheets to the\r\nwindow-bars, and by their help dropped into the garden. The drop was so\r\ngreat that he broke one of his thigh bones, but dragging himself along\r\non his hands and one knee, he, with one of his servants, reached a\r\nrecess in the wall, while another servant was endeavouring to escape\r\nthrough the flames, thus falling into the hands of the fanatics, who\r\ncarried him before their captain. Then cries of \"The prophet! the\r\nprophet!\" were heard on all sides. Esprit Seguier, feeling that\r\nsomething fresh had taken place, came forward, still holding in his hand\r\nthe blazing torch with which he had set fire to the pile.\r\n\r\n\"Brother,\" asked Laporte, pointing to the prisoner, \"is this man to\r\ndie?\"\r\n\r\nEsprit Seguier fell on his knees and covered his face with his mantle,\r\nlike Samuel, and sought the Lord in prayer, asking to know His will.\r\n\r\nIn a short time he rose and said, \"This man is not to die; for inasmuch\r\nas he has showed mercy to our brethren we must show mercy to him.\"\r\n\r\nWhether this fact had been miraculously revealed to Seguier, or whether\r\nhe had gained his information from other sources, the newly released\r\nprisoners confirmed its truth, calling out that the man had indeed\r\ntreated them with humanity. Just then a roar as of a wild beast was\r\nheard: one of the fanatics, whose brother had been put to death by the\r\nabbe, had just caught sight of him, the whole neighbourhood being lit up\r\nby the fire; he was kneeling in an angle of the wall, to which he had\r\ndragged himself.\r\n\r\n\"Down with the son of Belial!\" shouted the crowd, rushing towards the\r\npriest, who remained kneeling and motionless like a marble statue. His\r\nvalet took advantage of the confusion to escape, and got off easily; for\r\nthe sight of him on whom the general hate was concentrated made the\r\nHuguenots forget everything else:\r\n\r\nEsprit Seguier was the first to reach the priest, and spreading his\r\nhands over him, he commanded the others to hold back. \"God desireth not\r\nthe death of a sinner,’\" said he, \"’but rather that he turn from his\r\nwickedness and live.’\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" shouted a score of voices, refusing obedience for the first\r\ntime, perhaps, to an order from the prophet; \"let him die without mercy,\r\nas he struck without pity. Death to the son of Belial, death!\"\r\n\r\n\"Silence!\" exclaimed the prophet in a terrible voice, \"and listen to the\r\nword of God from my mouth. If this man will join us and take upon him\r\nthe duties of a pastor, let us grant him his life, that he may\r\nhenceforward devote it to the spread of the true faith.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather a thousand deaths than apostasy!\" answered the priest.\r\n\r\n\"Die, then!\" cried Laporte, stabbing him; \"take that for having burnt my\r\nfather in Nimes.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he passed on the dagger to Esprit Seguier.\r\n\r\nDuchayla made neither sound nor gesture: it would have seemed as if the\r\ndagger had been turned by the priest’s gown as by a coat of mail were it\r\nnot that a thin stream of blood appeared. Raising his eyes to heaven, he\r\nrepeated the words of the penitential psalm: \"Out of the depths have I\r\ncried unto Thee, O Lord! Lord, hear my voice!\"\r\n\r\nThen Esprit Seguier raised his arm and struck in his turn, saying, \"Take\r\nthat for my son, whom you broke on the wheel at Montpellier.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he passed on the dagger.\r\n\r\nBut this blow also was not mortal, only another stream of blood\r\nappeared, and the abbe said in a failing voice, \"Deliver me, O my\r\nSaviour, out of my well-merited sufferings, and I will acknowledge their\r\njustice; far I have been a man of blood.\"\r\n\r\nThe next who seized the dagger came near and gave his blow, saying,\r\n\"Take that for my brother, whom you let die in the ’ceps.’\"\r\n\r\nThis time the dagger pierced the heart, and the abbe had only time to\r\nejaculate, \"Have mercy on me, O God, according to Thy great mercy!\"\r\nbefore he fell back dead.\r\n\r\nBut his death did not satisfy the vengeance of those who had not been\r\nable to strike him living; one by one they drew near and stabbed, each\r\ninvoking the shade of some dear murdered one and pronouncing the same\r\nwords of malediction.\r\n\r\nIn all, the body of the abbe received fifty-two dagger thrusts, of which\r\ntwenty-four would have been mortal.\r\n\r\nThus perished, at the age of fifty-five, Messire Francois de Langlade\r\nDuchayla, prior of Laval, inspector of missions in Gevaudan, and\r\nArch-priest of the Cevennes and Mende.\r\n\r\nTheir vengeance thus accomplished, the murderers felt that there was no\r\nmore safety for them in either city or plain, and fled to the mountains;\r\nbut in passing near the residence of M. de Laveze, a Catholic nobleman\r\nof the parish of Molezon, one of the fugitives recollected that he had\r\nheard that a great number of firearms was kept in the house. This seemed\r\na lucky chance, for firearms were what the Huguenots needed most of all.\r\nThey therefore sent two envoys to M. de Laveze to ask him to give them\r\nat, least a share of his weapons; but he, as a good Catholic, replied\r\nthat it was quite true that he had indeed a store of arms, but that they\r\nwere destined to the triumph and not to the desecration of religion, and\r\nthat he would only give them up with his life. With these words, he\r\ndismissed the envoys, barring his doors behind them.\r\n\r\nBut while this parley was going on the conspirators had approached the\r\nchateau, and thus received the valiant answer to their demands sooner\r\nthan M. de Laveze had counted on. Resolving not to leave him time to\r\ntake defensive measures, they dashed at the house, and by standing on\r\neach other’s shoulders reached the room in which M. de Laveze and his\r\nentire family had taken refuge. In an instant the door was forced, and\r\nthe fanatics, still reeking with the life-blood of Abbe Duchayla, began\r\nagain their work of death. No one was spared; neither the master of the\r\nhouse, nor his brother, nor his uncle, nor his sister, who knelt to the\r\nassassins in vain; even his old mother, who was eighty years of age,\r\nhaving from her bed first witnessed the murder of all her family, was at\r\nlast stabbed to the heart, though the butchers might have reflected that\r\nit was hardly worth while thus to anticipate the arrival of Death, who\r\naccording to the laws of nature must have been already at hand.\r\n\r\nThe massacre finished, the fanatics spread over the castle, supplying\r\nthemselves with arms and under-linen, being badly in need of the latter;\r\nfor when they left their homes they had expected soon to return, and had\r\ntaken nothing with them. They also carried off the copper kitchen\r\nutensils, intending to turn them into bullets. Finally, they seized on a\r\nsum of 5000 francs, the marriage-portion of M. de Laveze’s sister, who\r\nwas just about to be married, and thus laid the foundation of a war\r\nfund.\r\n\r\nThe news of these two bloody events soon reached not only Nimes but all\r\nthe countryside, and roused the authorities to action. M. le Comte de\r\nBroglie crossed the Upper Cevennes, and marched down to the bridge of\r\nMontvert, followed by several companies of fusiliers. From another\r\ndirection M. le Comte de Peyre brought thirty-two cavalry and three\r\nhundred and fifty infantry, having enlisted them at Marvejols, La\r\nCanourgue, Chiac, and Serverette. M. de St. Paul, Abbe Duchayla’s\r\nbrother, and the Marquis Duchayla, his nephew, brought eighty horsemen\r\nfrom the family estates. The Count of Morangiez rode in from St. Auban\r\nand Malzieu with two companies of cavalry, and the town of Mende by\r\norder of its bishop despatched its nobles at the head of three companies\r\nof fifty men each.\r\n\r\nBut the mountains had swallowed up the fanatics, and nothing was ever\r\nknown of their fate, except that from time to time a peasant would\r\nrelate that in crossing the Cevennes he had heard at dawn or dusk, on\r\nmountain peak or from valley depths, the sound going up to heaven of\r\nsongs of praise. It was the fanatic assassins worshipping God.\r\n\r\nOr occasionally at night, on the tops of the lofty mountains, fires\r\nshone forth which appeared to signal one to another, but on looking the\r\nnext night in the same direction all was dark.\r\n\r\nSo M. de Broglie, concluding that nothing could be done against enemies\r\nwho were invisible, disbanded the troops which had come to his aid, and\r\nwent back to Montpellier, leaving a company of fusiliers at Collet,\r\nanother at Ayres, one at the bridge of Montvert, one at Barre, and one\r\nat Pompidon, and appointing Captain Poul as their chief.\r\n\r\nThis choice of such a man as chief showed that M. de Broglie was a good\r\njudge of human nature, and was also perfectly acquainted with the\r\nsituation, for Captain Poul was the very man to take a leading part in\r\nthe coming struggle. \"He was,\" says Pere Louvreloeil, priest of the\r\nChristian doctrine and cure of Saint-Germain de Calberte, \"an officer of\r\nmerit and reputation, born in Ville-Dubert, near Carcassonne, who had\r\nwhen young served in Hungary and Germany, and distinguished himself in\r\nPiedmont in several excursions against the Barbets, [ A name applied\r\nfirst to the Alpine smugglers who lived in the valleys, later to the\r\ninsurgent peasants in the Cevennes.—Translator’s Note.] notably in one\r\nof the later ones, when, entering the tent of their chief, Barbanaga, he\r\ncut off his head. His tall and agile figure, his warlike air, his love\r\nof hard work, his hoarse voice, his fiery and austere character, his\r\ncarelessness in regard to dress, his mature age, his tried courage, his\r\ntaciturn habit, the length and weight of his sword, all combined to\r\nrender him formidable. Therefore no one could have been chosen more\r\nsuitable for putting down the rebels, for forcing their entrenchments,\r\nand for putting them to flight.\"\r\n\r\nHardly had he taken up a position in the market town of Labarre, which\r\nwas to be his headquarters, than he was informed that a gathering of\r\nfanatics had been seen on the little plain of Fondmorte, which formed a\r\npass between two valleys. He ordered out his Spanish steed, which he was\r\naccustomed to ride in the Turkish manner—that is, with very short\r\nstirrups, so that he could throw himself forward to the horse’s ears, or\r\nbackward to the tail, according as he wished to give or avoid a mortal\r\nblow. Taking with him eighteen men of his own company and twenty-five\r\nfrom the town, he at once set off for the place indicated, not\r\nconsidering any larger number necessary to put to rout a band of\r\npeasants, however numerous.\r\n\r\nThe information turned out to be correct: a hundred Reformers led by\r\nEsprit Seguier had encamped in the plain of Fondmorte, and about eleven\r\no’clock in the morning one of their sentinels in the defile gave the\r\nalarm by firing off his gun and running back to the camp, shouting, \"To\r\narms!\" But Captain Poul, with his usual impetuosity, did not give the\r\ninsurgents time to form, but threw himself upon them to the beat of the\r\ndrum, not in the least deterred by their first volley. As he had\r\nexpected, the band consisted of undisciplined peasants, who once\r\nscattered were unable to rally. They were therefore completely routed.\r\nPoul killed several with his own hand, among whom were two whose heads\r\nhe cut off as cleverly as the most experienced executioner could have\r\ndone, thanks to the marvellous temper of his Damascus blade. At this\r\nsight all who had till then stood their ground took to flight, Poul at\r\ntheir heels, slashing with his sword unceasingly, till they disappeared\r\namong the mountains. He then returned to the field of battle, picked up\r\nthe two heads, and fastening them to his saddlebow, rejoined his\r\nsoldiers with his bloody trophies,—that is to say, he joined the largest\r\ngroup of soldiers he could find; for the fight had turned into a number\r\nof single combats, every soldier fighting for himself. Here he found\r\nthree prisoners who were about to be shot; but Poul ordered that they\r\nshould not be touched: not that he thought for an instant of sparing\r\ntheir lives, but that he wished to reserve them for a public execution.\r\nThese three men were Nouvel, a parishioner of Vialon, Moise Bonnet of\r\nPierre-Male, and Esprit Seguier the prophet.\r\n\r\nCaptain Poul returned to Barre carrying with him his two heads and his\r\nthree prisoners, and immediately reported to M. Just de Baville,\r\nintendant of Languedoc, the important capture he had made. The prisoners\r\nwere quickly tried. Pierre Nouvel was condemned to be burnt alive at the\r\nbridge of Montvert, Molise Bonnet to be broken on the wheel at Deveze,\r\nand Esprit Seguier to be hanged at Andre-de-Lancise. Thus those who were\r\namateurs in executions had a sufficient choice.\r\n\r\nHowever, Moise Bonnet saved himself by becoming Catholic, but Pierre\r\nNouvel and Esprit Seguier died as martyrs, making profession of the new\r\nfaith and praising God.\r\n\r\nTwo days after the sentence on Esprit Seguier had been carried out, the\r\nbody disappeared from the gallows. A nephew of Laporte named Roland had\r\naudaciously carried it off, leaving behind a writing nailed to the\r\ngibbet. This was a challenge from Laporte to Poul, and was dated from\r\nthe \"Camp of the Eternal God, in the desert of Cevennes,\" Laporte\r\nsigning himself \"Colonel of the children of God who seek liberty of\r\nconscience.\" Poul was about to accept the challenge when he learned that\r\nthe insurrection was spreading on every side. A young man of Vieljeu,\r\ntwenty-six years of age, named Solomon Couderc, had succeeded Esprit\r\nSeguier in the office of prophet, and two young lieutenants had joined\r\nLaporte. One of these was his nephew Roland, a man of about thirty,\r\npock-marked, fair, thin, cold, and reserved; he was not tall, but very\r\nstrong, and of inflexible courage. The other, Henri Castanet of\r\nMassevaques, was a keeper from the mountain of Laygoal, whose skill as a\r\nmarksman was so well known that it was said he never missed a shot. Each\r\nof these lieutenants had fifty men under him.\r\n\r\nProphets and prophetesses too increased apace, so that hardly a day\r\npassed without reports being heard of fresh ones who were rousing whole\r\nvillages by their ravings.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime a great meeting of the Protestants of Languedoc had been\r\nheld in the fields of Vauvert, at which it had been resolved to join\r\nforces with the rebels of the Cevennes, and to send a messenger thither\r\nto make this resolution known.\r\n\r\nLaporte had just returned from La Vaunage, where he had been making\r\nrecruits, when this good news arrived; he at once sent his nephew Roland\r\nto the new allies with power to pledge his word in return for theirs,\r\nand to describe to them, in order to attract them, the country which he\r\nhad chosen as the theatre of the coming war, and which, thanks to its\r\nhamlets, its woods, its defiles, its valleys, its precipices, and its\r\ncaves, was capable of affording cover to as many bands of insurgents as\r\nmight be employed, would be a good rallying-ground after repulse, and\r\ncontained suitable positions for ambuscades. Roland was so successful in\r\nhis mission that these new \"soldiers of the Lord,\" as they called\r\nthemselves, on learning that he had once been a dragoon, offered him the\r\npost of leader, which he accepted, and returned to his uncle at the head\r\nof an army.\r\n\r\nBeing thus reinforced, the Reformers divided themselves into three\r\nbands, in order to spread abroad their beliefs through the entire\r\ndistrict. One went towards Soustele and the neighbourhood of Alais,\r\nanother towards St. Privat and the bridge of Montvert, while the third\r\nfollowed the mountain slope down to St. Roman le Pompidou, and Barre.\r\n\r\nThe first was commanded by Castanet, the second by Roland, and the third\r\nby Laporte.\r\n\r\nEach party ravaged the country as it passed, returning deathblow for\r\ndeathblow and conflagration for conflagration, so that hearing one after\r\nanother of these outrages Captain Poul demanded reinforcements from M.\r\nde Broglie and M. de Baville, which were promptly despatched.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Captain Poul found himself at the head of a sufficient number\r\nof troops, he determined to attack the rebels. He had received\r\nintelligence that the band led by Laporte was just about to pass through\r\nthe valley of Croix, below Barre, near Temelague. In consequence of this\r\ninformation, he lay in ambush at a favourable spot on the route. As soon\r\nas the Reformers who were without suspicion, were well within the narrow\r\npass in which Poul awaited them, he issued forth at the head of his\r\nsoldiers, and charged the rebels with such courage and impetuosity that\r\nthey, taken by surprise, made no attempt at resistance, but, thoroughly\r\ndemoralised, spread over the mountain-side, putting a greater and\r\ngreater distance at, every instant between themselves and the enemy,\r\ndespite the efforts of Laporte to make them stand their ground. At last,\r\nseeing himself deserted, Laporte began to think of his own safety. But\r\nit was already too late, for he was surrounded by dragoons, and the only\r\nway of retreat open to him lay over a large rock. This he successfully\r\nscaled, but before trying to get down the other side he raised his hands\r\nin supplication to Heaven; at that instant a volley was fired, two\r\nbullets struck him, and he fell head foremost down the precipice.\r\n\r\nWhen the dragoons reached the foot of the rock, they found him dead. As\r\nthey knew he was the chief of the rebels, his body was searched: sixty\r\nLouis was found in his pockets, and a sacred chalice which he was in the\r\nhabit of using as an ordinary drinking-cup. Poul cut off his head and\r\nthe heads of twelve other Reformers found dead on the field of battle,\r\nand enclosing them in a wicker basket, sent them to M. Just de Baville.\r\n\r\nThe Reformers soon recovered from this defeat and death, joined all\r\ntheir forces into one body, and placed Roland at their head in the place\r\nof Laporte. Roland chose a young man called Couderc de Mazel-Rozade, who\r\nhad assumed the name of Lafleur, as his lieutenant, and the rebel forces\r\nwere not only quickly reorganised, but made complete by the addition of\r\na hundred men raised by the new lieutenant, and soon gave a sign that\r\nthey were again on the war-path by burning down the churches of\r\nBousquet, Cassagnas, and Prunet.\r\n\r\nThen first it was that the consuls of Mende began to realise that it was\r\nno longer an insurrection they had on hand but a war, and Mende being\r\nthe capital of Gevaudan and liable to be attacked at any moment, they\r\nset themselves to bring into repair their counterscarps, ravelins,\r\nbastions, gates, portcullises, moats, walls, turrets, ramparts,\r\nparapets, watchtowers, and the gear of their cannon, and having laid in\r\na stock of firearms, powder and ball, they formed eight companies each\r\nfifty strong, composed of townsmen, and a further band of one hundred\r\nand fifty peasants drawn from the neighbouring country. Lastly, the\r\nStates of the province sent an envoy to the king, praying him graciously\r\nto take measures to check the plague of heresy which was spreading from\r\nday to day. The king at once sent M. Julien in answer to the petition.\r\nThus it was no longer simple governors of towns nor even chiefs of\r\nprovinces who were engaged in the struggle; royalty itself had come to\r\nthe rescue.\r\n\r\n  M. de Julien, born a Protestant, was a, member of the nobility of\r\n     Orange, and in his youth had served against France and borne arms\r\n     in England and Ireland when William of Orange succeeded James II as\r\n     King of England, Julien was one of his pages, and received as a\r\n     reward for his fidelity in the famous campaign of 1688 the command\r\n     of a regiment which was sent to the aid of the Duke of Savoy, who\r\n     had begged both England and Holland to help him. He bore himself so\r\n     gallantly that it was in great part due to him that the French were\r\n     forced to raise the siege of Cony.\r\n\r\nWhether it was that he expected too much from this success, or that the\r\nDuke of Savoy did not recognise his services at their worth, he withdrew\r\nto Geneva, where Louis XIV hearing of his discontent, caused overtures\r\nto be made to him with a view to drawing him into the French service. He\r\nwas offered the same rank in the French army as he had held in the\r\nEnglish, with a pension of 3000 livres.\r\n\r\n  M. de Julien accepted, and feeling that his religious belief would be\r\n     in the way of his advancement, when he changed his master he\r\n     changed his Church. He was given the command of the valley of\r\n     Barcelonnette, whence he made many excursions against the Barbets;\r\n     then he was transferred to the command of the Avennes, of the\r\n     principality of Orange, in order to guard the passes, so that the\r\n     French Protestants could not pass over the frontier for the purpose\r\n     of worshipping with their Dutch Protestant brethren; and after\r\n     having tried this for a year, he went to Versailles to report\r\n     himself to the king. While he was there, it chanced that the envoy\r\n     from Gevaudan arrived, and the king being satisfied with de\r\n     Julien’s conduct since he had entered his service, made him\r\n     major-general, chevalier of the military order of St. Louis; and\r\n     commander-in-chief in the Vivarais and the Cevennes.\r\n\r\n  M. de Julien from the first felt that the situation was very grave,\r\n     and saw that his predecessors had felt such great contempt for the\r\n     heretics that they had not realised the danger of the revolt. He\r\n     immediately proceeded to inspect in person the different points\r\n     where M. de Broglie had placed detachments of the Tournon and\r\n     Marsily regiments. It is true that he arrived by the light of\r\n     thirty burning village churches.\r\n\r\n  M. de Broglie, M. de Baville, M. de Julien, and Captain Poul met\r\n     together to consult as to the best means of putting an end to these\r\n     disorders. It was agreed that the royal troops should be divided\r\n     into two bodies, one under the command of M. de Julien to advance\r\n     on Alais, where it was reported large meetings of the rebels were\r\n     taking place, and the other under M. de Brogue, to march about in\r\n     the neighbourhood of Nimes.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the two chiefs separated. M. le Comte de Broglie at the\r\nhead of sixty-two dragoons and some companies of foot, and having under\r\nhim Captain Poul and M. de Dourville, set out from Cavayrac on the 12th\r\nof January at 2 a. m., and having searched without finding anything the\r\nvineyards of Nimes and La Garrigue de Milhau, took the road to the\r\nbridge of Lunel. There he was informed that those he was in search of\r\nhad been seen at the chateau of Caudiac the day before; he therefore at\r\nonce set out for the forest which lies around it, not doubting to find\r\nthe fanatics entrenched there; but, contrary to his expectations, it was\r\nvacant. He then pushed on to Vauvert, from Vauvert to Beauvoisin, from\r\nBeauvoisin to Generac, where he learned that a troop of rebels had\r\npassed the night there, and in the morning had left for Aubore. Resolved\r\nto give them no rest, M. de Broglie set out at once for this village.\r\n\r\nWhen half-way there, a member of his staff thought he could distinguish\r\na crowd of men near a house about half a league distant; M. de Broglie\r\ninstantly ordered Sieur de Gibertin, Captain Poul’s lieutenant, who was\r\nriding close by, at the head of his company, to take eight dragoons and\r\nmake a reconnaissance, in order to ascertain who these men were, while\r\nthe rest of the troops would make a halt.\r\n\r\nThis little band, led by its officer, crossed a clearing in the wood,\r\nand advanced towards the farmhouse, which was called the Mas de Gafarel,\r\nand which now seemed deserted. But when they were within half a gun-shot\r\nof the wall the charge was sounded behind it, and a band of rebels\r\nrushed towards them, while from a neighbouring house a second troop\r\nemerged, and looking round, he perceived a third lying on their faces in\r\na small wood. These latter suddenly stood up and approached him, singing\r\npsalms. As it was impossible for M. de Gibertin to hold his ground\r\nagainst so large a force, he ordered two shots to be fired as a warning\r\nto de Brogue to advance to meet him, and fell back on his comrades.\r\nIndeed, the rebels had only pursued him till they had reached a\r\nfavourable position, on which they took their stand.\r\n\r\n  M. de Brogue having surveyed the whole position with the aid of a\r\n     telescope, held a council of war, and it was decided that an attack\r\n     should be made forthwith. They therefore advanced on the rebels in\r\n     line: Captain Poul on the right, M. de Dourville on the left, and\r\n     Count Broglie in the centre.\r\n\r\nAs they got near they could see that the rebels had chosen their ground\r\nwith an amount of strategical sagacity they had never till then\r\ndisplayed. This skill in making their dispositions was evidently due to\r\ntheir having found a new leader whom no one knew, not even Captain Poul,\r\nalthough they could see him at the head of his men, carbine in hand.\r\n\r\nHowever, these scientific preparations did not stop M. de Brogue: he\r\ngave the order to charge, and adding example to precept, urged his horse\r\nto a gallop. The rebels in the first rank knelt on one knee, so that the\r\nrank behind could take aim, and the distance between the two bodies of\r\ntroops disappeared rapidly, thanks to the impetuosity of the dragoons;\r\nbut suddenly, when within thirty paces of the enemy, the royals found\r\nthemselves on the edge of a deep ravine which separated them from the\r\nenemy like a moat. Some were able to check their horses in time, but\r\nothers, despite desperate efforts, pressed upon by those behind, were\r\npushed into the ravine, and rolled helplessly to the bottom. At the same\r\nmoment the order to fire was given in a sonorous voice, there was a\r\nrattle of musketry, and several dragoons near M. de Broglie fell.\r\n\r\n\"Forward!\" cried Captain Poul, \"forward!\" and putting his horse at a\r\npart of the ravine where the sides were less steep, he was soon\r\nstruggling up the opposite side, followed by a few dragoons.\r\n\r\n\"Death to the son of Belial!\" cried the same voice which had given the\r\norder to fire. At that moment a single shot rang out, Captain Poul threw\r\nup his hands, letting his sabre go, and fell from his horse, which\r\ninstead of running away, touched his master with its smoking nostrils,\r\nthen lifting its head, neighed long and low. The dragoons retreated.\r\n\r\n\"So perish all the persecutors of Israel!\" cried the leader, brandishing\r\nhis carbine. He then dashed down into the ravine, picked up Captain\r\nPoul’s sabre and jumped upon his horse. The animal, faithful to its old\r\nmaster, showed some signs of resistance, but soon felt by the pressure\r\nof its rider’s knees that it had to do with one whom it could not\r\nreadily unseat. Nevertheless, it reared and bounded, but the horseman\r\nkept his seat, and as if recognising that it had met its match, the\r\nnoble animal tossed its head, neighed once more, and gave in. While this\r\nwas going on, a party of Camisards [Name given to the insurgent\r\nCalvinists after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes.—Translator’s\r\nNote.] and one of the dragoons had got down into the ravine, which had\r\nin consequence been turned into a battlefield; while those who remained\r\nabove on either side took advantage of their position to fire down at\r\ntheir enemies. M. de Dourville, in command of the dragoons, fought among\r\nthe others like a simple soldier, and received a serious wound in the\r\nhead; his men beginning to lose ground, M. de Brogue tried to rally\r\nthem, but without avail, and while he was thus occupied his own troop\r\nran away; so seeing there was no prospect of winning the battle, he and\r\na few valiant men who had remained near him dashed forward to extricate\r\nM. Dourville, who, taking advantage of the opening thus made, retreated,\r\nhis wound bleeding profusely. On the other hand, the Camisards\r\nperceiving at some distance bodies of infantry coming up to reinforce\r\nthe royals, instead of pursuing their foes, contented themselves with\r\nkeeping up a thick and well-directed musketry-fire from the position in\r\nwhich they had won such a quick and easy victory.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the royal forces were out of reach of their weapons, the\r\nrebel chief knelt down and chanted the song the Israelites sang when,\r\nhaving crossed the Red Sea in safety, they saw the army of Pharaoh\r\nswallowed up in the waters, so that although no longer within reach of\r\nbullets the defeated troops were still pursued by songs of victory.\r\nTheir thanksgivings ended, the Calvinists withdrew into the forest, led\r\nby their new chief, who had at his first assay shown the great extent of\r\nhis knowledge, coolness, and courage.\r\n\r\nThis new chief, whose superiors were soon to become his lieutenants, was\r\nthe famous Jean Cavalier.\r\n\r\nJean Cavalier was then a young man of twenty-three, of less than medium\r\nheight, but of great strength. His face was oval, with regular features,\r\nhis eyes sparkling and beautiful; he had long chestnut hair falling on\r\nhis shoulders, and an expression of remarkable sweetness. He was born in\r\n1680 at Ribaute, a village in the diocese of Alais, where his father had\r\nrented a small farm, which he gave up when his son was about fifteen,\r\ncoming to live at the farm of St. Andeol, near Mende.\r\n\r\nYoung Cavalier, who was only a peasant and the son of a peasant, began\r\nlife as a shepherd at the Sieur de Lacombe’s, a citizen of Vezenobre,\r\nbut as the lonely life dissatisfied a young man who was eager for\r\npleasure, Jean gave it up, and apprenticed himself to a baker of Anduze.\r\n\r\nThere he developed a great love for everything connected with the\r\nmilitary; he spent all his free time watching the soldiers at their\r\ndrill, and soon became intimate with some of them, amongst others with a\r\nfencing-master who gave him lessons, and a dragoon who taught him to\r\nride.\r\n\r\nOn a certain Sunday, as he was taking a walk with his sweetheart on his\r\narm, the young girl was insulted by a dragoon of the Marquis de Florae’s\r\nregiment. Jean boxed the dragoon’s ears, who drew his sword. Cavalier\r\nseized a sword from one of the bystanders, but the combatants were\r\nprevented from fighting by Jean’s friends. Hearing of the quarrel, an\r\nofficer hurried up: it was the Marquis de Florae himself, captain of the\r\nregiment which bore his name; but when he arrived on the scene he found,\r\nnot the arrogant peasant who had dared to attack a soldier of the king,\r\nbut only the young girl, who had fainted, the townspeople having\r\npersuaded her lover to decamp.\r\n\r\nThe young girl was so beautiful that she was commonly called la belle\r\nIsabeau, and the Marquis de Florac, instead of pursuing Jean Cavalier,\r\noccupied himself in reviving Isabeau.\r\n\r\nAs it was, however, a serious affair, and as the entire regiment had\r\nsworn Cavalier’s death, his friends advised him to leave the country for\r\na time. La belle Isabeau, trembling for the safety of her lover, joined\r\nher entreaties to those of his friends, and Jean Cavalier yielded. The\r\nyoung girl promised him inviolable fidelity, and he, relying on this\r\npromise, went to Geneva.\r\n\r\nThere he made the acquaintance of a Protestant gentleman called Du\r\nSerre, who having glass-works at the Mas Arritas, quite near the farm of\r\nSt. Andeol, had undertaken several times, at the request of Jean’s\r\nfather, Jerome, to convey money to Jean; for Du Serre went very often to\r\nGeneva, professedly on business affairs, but really in the interests of\r\nthe Reformed faith. Between the outlaw and the apostle union was\r\nnatural. Du Serre found in Cavalier a young man of robust nature, active\r\nimagination, and irreproachable courage; he confided to him his hopes of\r\nconverting all Languedoc and Vivarais. Cavalier felt himself drawn back\r\nthere by many ties, especially by patriotism and love. He crossed the\r\nfrontier once more, disguised as a servant, in the suite of a Protestant\r\ngentleman; he arrived one night at Anduze, and immediately directed his\r\nsteps to the house of Isabeau.\r\n\r\nHe was just about to knock, although it was one o’clock in the morning,\r\nwhen the door was opened from within, and a handsome young man came out,\r\nwho took tender leave of a woman on the threshold. The handsome young\r\nman was the Marquis de Florac; the woman was Isabeau. The promised wife\r\nof the peasant had become the mistress of the noble.\r\n\r\nOur hero was not the man to suffer such an outrage quietly. He walked\r\nstraight up to the marquis and stood right in his way. The marquis tried\r\nto push him aside with his elbow, but Jean Cavalier, letting fall the\r\ncloak in which he was wrapped, drew his sword. The marquis was brave,\r\nand did not stop to inquire if he who attacked him was his equal or not.\r\nSword answered sword, the blades crossed, and at the end of a few\r\ninstants the marquis fell, Jean’s sword piercing his chest.\r\n\r\nCavalier felt sure that he was dead, for he lay at his feet motionless.\r\nHe knew he had no time to lose, for he had no mercy to hope for. He\r\nreplaced his bloody sword in the scabbard, and made for the open\r\ncountry; from the open country he hurried into the mountains, and at\r\nbreak of day he was in safety.\r\n\r\nThe fugitive remained the whole day in an isolated farmhouse whose\r\ninmates offered him hospitality. As he very soon felt that he was in the\r\nhouse of a co-religionist, he confided to his host the circumstances in\r\nwhich he found himself, and asked where he could meet with an organised\r\nband in which he could enrol himself in order to fight for the\r\npropagation of the Reformed religion. The farmer mentioned Generac as\r\nbeing a place in which he would probably find a hundred or so of the\r\nbrethren gathered together. Cavalier set out the same evening for this\r\nvillage, and arrived in the middle of the Camisards at the very moment\r\nwhen they had just caught sight of M. de Broglie and his troops in the\r\ndistance. The Calvinists happening to have no leader, Cavalier with\r\ngoverning faculty which some men possess by nature, placed himself at\r\ntheir head and took those measures for the reception of the royal forces\r\nof which we have seen the result, so that after the victory to which his\r\nhead and arm had contributed so much he was confirmed in the title which\r\nhe had arrogated to himself, by acclamation.\r\n\r\nSuch was the famous Jean Cavalier when the Royalists first learned of\r\nhis existence, through the repulse of their bravest troops and the death\r\nof their most intrepid captain.\r\n\r\nThe news of this victory soon spread through the Cevennes, and fresh\r\nconflagrations lit up the mountains in sign of joy. The beacons were\r\nformed of the chateau de la Bastide, the residence of the Marquis de\r\nChambonnas, the church of Samson, and the village of Grouppieres, where\r\nof eighty houses only seven were left standing.\r\n\r\nThereupon M. de Julien wrote to the king, explaining the serious turn\r\nthings had taken, and telling him that it was no longer a few fanatics\r\nwandering through the mountains and flying at the sight of a dragoon\r\nwhom they had to put down, but organised companies well led and\r\nofficered, which if united would form an army twelve to fifteen hundred\r\nstrong. The king replied by sending M. le Comte de Montrevel to Nimes.\r\nHe was the son of the Marechal de Montrevel, chevalier of the Order of\r\nthe Holy Spirit, major-general, lieutenant of the king in Bresse and\r\nCharolais, and captain of a hundred men-at-arms.\r\n\r\nIn their struggle against shepherds, keepers, and peasants, M. de\r\nBrogue, M. de Julien, and M. de Baville were thus joined together with\r\nthe head of the house of Beaune, which had already at this epoch\r\nproduced two cardinals, three archbishops, two bishops, a viceroy of\r\nNaples, several marshals of France, and many governors of Savoy,\r\nDauphine, and Bresse.\r\n\r\nHe was followed by twenty pieces of ordnance, five thousand bullets,\r\nfour thousand muskets, and fifty thousand pounds of powder, all of which\r\nwas carried down the river Rhone, while six hundred of the skilful\r\nmountain marksmen called ’miquelets’ from Roussillon came down into\r\nLanguedoc.\r\n\r\n  M. de Montrevel was the bearer of terrible orders. Louis XIV was\r\n     determined, no matter what it cost, to root out heresy, and set\r\n     about this work as if his eternal salvation depended on it. As soon\r\n     as M. de Baville had read these orders, he published the following\r\n     proclamation:\r\n\r\n\"The king having been informed that certain people without religion\r\nbearing arms have been guilty of violence, burning down churches and\r\nkilling priests, His Majesty hereby commands all his subjects to hunt\r\nthese people down, and that those who are taken with arms in their hands\r\nor found amongst their bands, be punished with death without any trial\r\nwhatever, that their houses be razed to the ground and their goods\r\nconfiscated, and that all buildings in which assemblies of these people\r\nhave been held, be demolished. The king further forbids fathers,\r\nmothers, brothers, sisters, and other relations of the fanatics, or of\r\nother rebels, to give them refuge, food, stores, ammunition, or other\r\nassistance of any kind, under any pretext whatever, either directly or\r\nindirectly, on pain of being reputed accessory to the rebellion, and he\r\ncommands the Sieur de Baville and whatever officers he may choose to\r\nprosecute such and pronounce sentence of death on them. Furthermore, His\r\nMajesty commands that all the inhabitants of Languedoc who may be absent\r\nat the date of the issue of this proclamation, return home within a\r\nweek, unless their absence be caused by legitimate business, in which\r\ncase they shall declare the same to the commandant, the Sieur de\r\nMontrevel, or to the intendant, the Sieur de Baville, and also to the\r\nmayors and consuls of the places where they may be, receiving from the\r\nlatter certificates that there is a sufficient reason for their delay,\r\nwhich certificates they shall forward to the above-mentioned commandant\r\nor intendant. And His Majesty furthermore commands the said commandant\r\nand intendant to admit no foreigner or inhabitant of any other province\r\ninto Languedoc for commercial purposes or for any other reason\r\nwhatsoever, unless provided with certificates from the commandants or\r\nintendants of the provinces whence they come, or from the judges of the\r\nroyal courts in the places whence they come, or from the nearest place\r\ncontaining such courts. Foreigners must be provided with passports from\r\nthe ambassadors or ministers of the king accredited to the countries to\r\nwhich they belong, or from the commandants or intendants of the\r\nprovinces, or from the judges of the royal courts of the places in which\r\nthey may be at the date of this proclamation. Furthermore, it is His\r\nMajesty’s will that those who are found in the, aforesaid province of\r\nLanguedoc without such certificates be regarded as fanatics and rebels,\r\nand that they be prosecuted as such, and punished with death, and that\r\nthey be brought for this purpose before the aforesaid Sieur de Baville\r\nor the officers whom he may choose.\r\n\r\n\"(Signed) \"(Countersigned) \"LOUIS PHILIPPEAU\r\n\r\n\"Given at Versailles the 25th day, of the month of February 1703.\"\r\n\r\n  M. de Montrevel obeyed this proclamation to the letter. For instance,\r\n     one day—the 1st of April 1703—as he was seated at dinner it was\r\n     reported to him that about one hundred and fifty Reformers were\r\n     assembled in a mill at Carmes, outside Nimes, singing psalms.\r\n     Although he was told at the same time that the gathering was\r\n     composed entirely of old people and children, he was none the less\r\n     furious, and rising from the table, gave orders that the call to\r\n     horse should be sounded. Putting himself at the head of his\r\n     dragoons, he advanced on the mill, and before the Huguenots knew\r\n     that they were about to be attacked they were surrounded on every\r\n     side. It was no combat which ensued, for the Huguenots were\r\n     incapable of resistance, it was simply a massacre; a certain number\r\n     of the dragoons entered the mill sword in hand, stabbing all whom\r\n     they could reach, whilst the rest of the force stationed outside\r\n     before the windows received those who jumped out on the points of\r\n     their swords. But soon this butchery tired the butchers, and to get\r\n     over the business more quickly, the marshal, who was anxious to\r\n     return to his dinner, gave orders that the mill should be set on\r\n     fire. This being done, the dragoons, the marshal still at their\r\n     head, no longer exerted themselves so violently, but were satisfied\r\n     with pushing back into the flames the few unfortunates who,\r\n     scorched and burnt, rushed out, begging only for a less cruel\r\n     death.\r\n\r\nOnly one victim escaped. A beautiful young girl of sixteen was saved by\r\nthe marshal’s valet: both were taken and condemned to death; the young\r\ngirl was hanged, and the valet was on the point of being executed when\r\nsome Sisters of Mercy from the town threw themselves at the marshal’s\r\nfeet end begged for his life: after long supplication, he granted their\r\nprayer, but he banished the valet not only from his service, but from\r\nNimes.\r\n\r\nThe very same evening at supper word was brought to the marshal that\r\nanother gathering had been discovered in a garden near the still smoking\r\nmill. The indefatigable marshal again rose from table, and taking with\r\nhim his faithful dragoons, surrounded the garden, and caught and shot on\r\nthe spot all those who were assembled in it. The next day it turned out\r\nthat he had made a mistake: those whom he had shot were Catholics who\r\nhad gathered together to rejoice over the execution of the Calvinists.\r\nIt is true that they had assured the marshal that they were Catholics,\r\nbut he had refused to listen to them. Let us, however, hasten to assure\r\nthe reader that this mistake caused no further annoyance to the marshal,\r\nexcept that he received a paternal remonstrance from the Bishop of\r\nNimes, begging him in future not to confound the sheep with the wolves.\r\n\r\nIn requital of these bloody deeds, Cavalier took the chateau of Serras,\r\noccupied the town of Sauve, formed a company of horse, and advancing to\r\nNimes, took forcible possession of sufficient ammunition for his\r\npurposes. Lastly, he did something which in the eyes of the courtiers\r\nseemed the most incredible thing of all, he actually wrote a long letter\r\nto Louis XIV himself. This letter was dated from the \"Desert, Cevennes,\"\r\nand signed \"Cavalier, commander of the troops sent by God\"; its purpose\r\nwas to prove by numerous passages from Holy Writ that Cavalier and his\r\ncomrades had been led to revolt solely from a sense of duty, feeling\r\nthat liberty of conscience was their right; and it dilated on the\r\nsubject of the persecutions under which Protestants had suffered, and\r\nasserted that it was the infamous measures put in force against them\r\nwhich had driven them to take up arms, which they were ready to lay down\r\nif His Majesty would grant them that liberty in matters of religion\r\nwhich they sought and if he would liberate all who were in prison for\r\ntheir faith. If this were accorded, he assured the king His Majesty\r\nwould have no more faithful subjects than themselves, and would\r\nhenceforth be ready to shed their last drop of blood in his service, and\r\nwound up by saying that if their just demands were refused they would\r\nobey God rather than the king, and would defend their religion to their\r\nlast breath.\r\n\r\nRoland, who, whether in mockery or pride, began now to call himself\r\n\"Comte Roland,\" did not lag behind his young brother either as warrior\r\nor correspondent. He had entered the town of Ganges, where a wonderful\r\nreception awaited him; but not feeling sure that he would be equally\r\nwell received at St. Germain and St. Andre, he had written the following\r\nletters:—\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen and officers of the king’s forces, and citizens of St.\r\nGermain, make ready to receive seven hundred troops who have vowed to\r\nset Babylon on fire; the seminary and the houses of MM. de Fabregue, de\r\nSarrasin, de Moles, de La Rouviere, de Musse, and de Solier, will be\r\nburnt to the ground. God, by His Holy Spirit, has inspired my brother\r\nCavalier and me with the purpose of entering your town in a few days;\r\nhowever strongly you fortify yourselves, the children of God will bear\r\naway the victory. If ye doubt this, come in your numbers, ye soldiers of\r\nSt. Etienne, Barre, and Florac, to the field of Domergue; we shall be\r\nthere to meet you. Come, ye hypocrites, if your hearts fail not. \"COMTE\r\nROLAND.\"\r\n\r\nThe second letter was no less violent. It was as follows:—\r\n\r\n\"We, Comte Roland, general of the Protestant troops of France assembled\r\nin the Cevennes in Languedoc, enjoin on the inhabitants of the town of\r\nSt. Andre of Valborgne to give proper notice to all priests and\r\nmissionaries within it, that we forbid them to say mass or to preach in\r\nthe afore-mentioned town, and that if they will avoid being burnt alive\r\nwith their adherents in their churches and houses, they are to withdraw\r\nto some other place within three days. \"COMTE ROLAND.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the cause of the king, though the rebels met with some\r\nresistance in the villages of the plain, such as St. Germain and St.\r\nAndre, it was otherwise with those situated in the mountains; in those,\r\nwhen beaten, the Protestants found cover, when victorious rest; so that\r\nM. de Montrevel becoming aware that while these villages existed heresy\r\nwould never be extirpated, issued the following ordinance:—\r\n\r\n\"We, governor for His most Christian Majesty in the provinces of\r\nLanguedoc and Vivarais, do hereby make known that it has pleased the\r\nking to command us to reduce all the places and parishes hereinafter\r\nnamed to such a condition that they can afford no assistance to the\r\nrebel troops; no inhabitants will therefore be allowed to remain in\r\nthem. His Majesty, however, desiring to provide for the subsistence of\r\nthe afore-mentioned inhabitants, orders them to conform to the following\r\nregulations. He enjoins on the afore-mentioned inhabitants of the\r\nhereinafter-mentioned parishes to repair instantly to the places\r\nhereinafter appointed, with their furniture, cattle, and in general all\r\ntheir movable effects, declaring that in case of disobedience their\r\neffects will be confiscated and taken away by the troops employed to\r\ndemolish their houses. And it is hereby forbidden to any other commune\r\nto receive such rebels, under pain of having their houses also razed to\r\nthe ground and their goods confiscated, and furthermore being regarded\r\nand treated as rebels to the commands of His Majesty.\"\r\n\r\nTo this proclamation were appended the following instructions:—\r\n\r\n\"I. The officers who may be appointed to perform the above task shall\r\nfirst of all make themselves acquainted with the position of the\r\nparishes and villages which are to be destroyed and depopulated, in\r\norder to an effective disposition of the troops, who are to guard the\r\nmilitia engaged in the work of destruction.\r\n\r\n\"II. The attention of the officers is called to the following:—When two\r\nor more villages or hamlets are so near together that they may be\r\nprotected at the same time by the same troops, then in order to save\r\ntime the work is to be carried on simultaneously in such villages or\r\nhamlets.\r\n\r\n\"III. When inhabitants are found still remaining in any of the\r\nproscribed places, they are to be brought together, and a list made of\r\nthem, as well as an inventory taken of their stock and corn.\r\n\r\n\"IV. Those inhabitants who are of the most consequence among them shall\r\nbe selected to guide the others to the places assigned.\r\n\r\n\"V. With regard to the live stock, the persons who may be found in\r\ncharge of it shall drive it to the appointed place, save and except\r\nmules and asses, which shall be employed in the transport of corn to\r\nwhatever places it may be needed in. Nevertheless, asses may be given to\r\nthe very old, and to women with child who may be unable to walk.\r\n\r\n\"VI. A regular distribution of the militia is to be made, so that each\r\nhouse to be destroyed may have a sufficient number, for the task; the\r\nfoundations of such houses may be undermined or any other method\r\nemployed which may be most convenient; and if the house can be destroyed\r\nby no other means, it is to be set on fire.\r\n\r\n\"VII. No damage is to be done to the houses of former Catholics until\r\nfurther notice, and to ensure the carrying out of this order a guard is\r\nto be placed in them, and an inventory of their contents taken and sent\r\nto Marechal de Montrevel.\r\n\r\n\"VIII. The order forbidding the inhabitants to return to their houses is\r\nto be read to the inhabitants of each village; but if any do return they\r\nshall not be harmed, but simply driven away with threats; for the king\r\ndoes not desire that blood be shed; and the said order shall be affixed\r\nto a wall or tree in each village.\r\n\r\n\"IX. Where no inhabitants are found, the said order shall simply be\r\naffixed as above-mentioned in each place.\r\n\r\n\"(Signed) \"MARECHAL DE MONTREVEL\"\r\n\r\nUnder these instructions the list of the villages to be destroyed was\r\ngiven. It was as follows:\r\n\r\n    18 in the parish of Frugeres,\r\n\r\n    5    \"      \"  Fressinet−de−Lozere,\r\n\r\n    4    \"      \"  Grizac,\r\n\r\n    15   \"      \"  Castagnols,\r\n\r\n    11   \"      \"  Vialas,\r\n\r\n    6    \"      \"  Saint−Julien,\r\n\r\n    8    \"      \"  Saint−Maurice de Vantalon,\r\n\r\n    14   \"      \"  Frezal de Vantalon,\r\n\r\n    7    \"      \"  Saint−Hilaire de Laret,\r\n\r\n    6    \"      \"  Saint−Andeol de Clergues,\r\n\r\n    28   \"      \"  Saint−Privat de Vallongues,\r\n\r\n    10   \"      \"  Saint−Andre de Lancise,\r\n\r\n    19   \"      \"  Saint−Germain de Calberte,\r\n\r\n    26   \"      \"  Saint−Etienne de Valfrancesque,\r\n\r\n    9    \"      \"  parishes of Prunet and Montvaillant,\r\n\r\n    16   \"      \"  parish of Florac.\r\n    —−\r\n    202\r\n\r\nA second list was promised, and was shortly afterwards published: it\r\nincluded the parishes of Frugeres, Pompidon, Saint-Martin, Lansuscle,\r\nSaint-Laurent, Treves, Vebron, Ronnes, Barre, Montluzon, Bousquet, La\r\nBarthes, Balme, Saint-Julien d’Aspaon Cassagnas, Sainte-Croix de\r\nValfrancesque, Cabriac, Moissac, Saint-Roman, Saint Martin de Robaux, La\r\nMelouse, le Collet de Deze, Saint-Michel de Deze, and the villages of\r\nSalieges, Rampon, Ruas, Chavrieres, Tourgueselle, Ginestous, Fressinet,\r\nFourques, Malbos, Jousanel, Campis, Campredon, Lous-Aubrez, La Croix de\r\nFer, Le Cap de Coste, Marquayres, Le Cazairal, and Le Poujal.\r\n\r\nIn all, 466 market towns, hamlets, and villages, with 19,500\r\ninhabitants, were included.\r\n\r\nAll these preparations made Marechal de Montrevel set out for Aix,\r\nSeptember 26th, 1703, in order that the work might be carried out under\r\nhis personal supervision. He was accompanied by MM. de Vergetot and de\r\nMarsilly, colonels of infantry, two battalions of the Royal-Comtois, two\r\nof the Soissonnais infantry, the Languedoc regiment of dragoons, and two\r\nhundred dragoons from the Fimarcon regiment. M. de Julien, on his side,\r\nset out for the Pont-de-Montvert at the same time with two battalions\r\nfrom Hainault, accompanied by the Marquis of Canillac, colonel of\r\ninfantry, who brought two battalions of his own regiment, which was\r\nstationed in Rouergue, with him, and Comte de Payre, who brought\r\nfifty-five companies of militia from Gevaudan, and followed by a number\r\nof mules loaded with crowbars, axes, and other iron instruments\r\nnecessary for pulling down houses.\r\n\r\nThe approach of all these troops following close on the terrible\r\nproclamations we have given above, produced exactly the contrary effect\r\nto that intended. The inhabitants of the proscribed districts were\r\nconvinced that the order to gather together in certain places was given\r\nthat they might be conveniently massacred together, so that all those\r\ncapable of bearing arms went deeper into the mountains, and joined the\r\nforces of Cavalier and Roland, thus reinforcing them to the number of\r\nfifteen hundred men. Also hardly had M. de Julien set his hand to the\r\nwork than he received information from M. de Montrevel, who had heard\r\nthe news through a letter from Flechier, that while the royal troops\r\nwere busy in the mountains the Camisards had come down into the plain,\r\nswarmed over La Camargue, and had been seen in the neighbourhood of\r\nSaint-Gilles. At the same time word was sent him that two ships had been\r\nseen in the offing, from Cette, and that it was more than probable that\r\nthey contained troops, that England and Holland were sending to help the\r\nCamisards.\r\n\r\n  M. de Montrevel; leaving the further conduct of the expedition to MM.\r\n     de Julien and de Canillac, hastened to Cette with eight hundred men\r\n     and ten guns. The ships were still in sight, and were really, as\r\n     had been surmised, two vessels which had been detached from the\r\n     combined fleets of England and Holland by Admiral Schowel, and were\r\n     the bearers of money, arms, and ammunition to the Huguenots. They\r\n     continued to cruise about and signal, but as the rebels were forced\r\n     by the presence of M. de Montrevel to keep away from the coast, and\r\n     could therefore make no answer, they put off at length into the\r\n     open, and rejoined the fleet. As M. de Montrevel feared that their\r\n     retreat might be a feint, he ordered all the fishermen’s huts from\r\n     Aigues-Morte to Saint-Gilles to be destroyed, lest they should\r\n     afford shelter to the Camisards. At the same time he carried off\r\n     the inhabitants of the district of Guillan and shut them up in the\r\n     chateau of Sommerez, after having demolished their villages.\r\n     Lastly, he ordered all those who lived in homesteads, farms, or\r\n     hamlets, to quit them and go to some large town, taking with them\r\n     all the provisions they were possessed of; and he forbade any\r\n     workman who went outside the town to work to take more than one\r\n     day’s provisions with him.\r\n\r\nThese measures had the desired effect, but they were terrible in their\r\nresults; they deprived the Camisards of shelter indeed, but they ruined\r\nthe province. M. de Baville, despite his well-known severity tried\r\nremonstrances, but they were taken in bad part by M. de Montrevel, who\r\ntold the intendant to mind his own business, which was confined to civil\r\nmatters, and to leave military matters in his, M. de Montrevel’s, hands;\r\nwhereupon the commandant joined M. de Julien, who was carrying on the\r\nwork of destruction with indefatigable vigour.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all the enthusiasm with which M. de Julien went to work to\r\naccomplish his mission, and being a new convert, it was, of course, very\r\ngreat. Material hindrances hampered him at every step. Almost all the\r\ndoomed houses were built on vaulted foundations, and were therefore\r\ndifficult to lay low; the distance of one house from another, too, their\r\nalmost inaccessible position, either on the peak of a high mountain or\r\nin the bottom of a rocky valley, or buried in the depths of the forest\r\nwhich hid them like a veil, made the difficulty still greater; whole\r\ndays were often lost by the workmen and militia in searching for the\r\ndwellings they came to destroy.\r\n\r\nThe immense size of the parishes also caused delay: that of\r\nSaint-Germain de Calberte, for instance, was nine leagues in\r\ncircumference, and contained a hundred and eleven hamlets, inhabited by\r\ntwo hundred and seventy-five families, of which only nine were Catholic;\r\nthat of Saint-Etienne de Valfrancesque was of still greater extent, and\r\nits population was a third larger, so that obstacles to the work\r\nmultiplied in a remarkable manner. For the first few days the soldiers\r\nand workmen found food in and around the villages, but this was soon at\r\nan end, and as they could hardly expect the peasants to keep up the\r\nsupply, and the provisions they had brought with them being also\r\nexhausted, they were soon reduced to biscuit and water; and they were\r\nnot even able to make it into a warm mess by heating the water, as they\r\nhad no vessels; moreover, when their hard day’s work was at an end, they\r\nhad but a handful of straw on which to lie. These privations, added to\r\ntheir hard and laborious life, brought on an endemic fever, which\r\nincapacitated for work many soldiers and labourers, numbers of whom had\r\nto be dismissed. Very soon the unfortunate men, who were almost as much\r\nto be pitied as those whom they were persecuting, waited no longer to be\r\nsent away, but deserted in numbers.\r\n\r\n  M. de Julien soon saw that all his efforts would end in failure if he\r\n     could not gain the king’s consent to a slight change in the\r\n     original plan. He therefore wrote to Versailles, and represented to\r\n     the king how long the work would take if the means employed were\r\n     only iron tools and the human hand, instead of fire, the only true\r\n     instrument employed by Heaven in its vengeance. He quoted in\r\n     support of his petition the case of Sodom and Gomorrah—those cities\r\n     accursed of the Lord. Louis XIV, impressed by the truth of this\r\n     comparison, sent him back a messenger post-haste authorising him to\r\n     employ the suggested means.\r\n\r\n\"At once,\" says Pere Louvreloeil, \"the storm burst, and soon of all the\r\nhappy homesteads nothing was left: the hamlets, with their barns and\r\nouthouses, the isolated farmhouses, the single huts and cottages, every\r\nspecies of building in short, disappeared before the swift advancing\r\nflames as wild flowers, weeds, and roots fall before the ploughshare.\"\r\n\r\nThis destruction was accompanied by horrible cruelty. For instance,\r\ntwenty-five inhabitants of a certain village took refuge in a chateau;\r\nthe number consisted of children and very old people, and they were all\r\nthat was left of the entire population. Palmerolle, in command of the\r\nmiquelets, hearing of this, hastened thither, seized the first eight he\r\ncould lay hold of, and shot them on the spot, \"to teach them,\" as he\r\nsays in his report, \"not to choose a shelter which was not on the list\r\nof those permitted to them.\"\r\n\r\nThe Catholics also of St. Florent, Senechas, Rousson, and other\r\nparishes, becoming excited at seeing the flames which enveloped the\r\nhouses of their old enemies, joined together, and arming themselves with\r\neverything that could be made to serve as an instrument of death, set\r\nout to hunt the conscripts down; they carried off the flocks of Perolat,\r\nFontareche, and Pajolas, burned down a dozen houses at the\r\nCollet-de-Deze, and from there went to the village of Brenoux, drunk\r\nwith the lust of destruction. There they massacred fifty-two persons,\r\namong them mothers with unborn children; and with these babes, which\r\nthey tore from them, impaled on their pikes and halberts, they continued\r\ntheir march towards the villages of St. Denis and Castagnols.\r\n\r\nVery soon these volunteers organised themselves into companies, and\r\nbecame known under the name of Cadets de la Croix, from a small white\r\ncross which they wore on their coats; so the poor Huguenots had a new\r\nspecies of enemy to contend with, much more bloodthirsty than the\r\ndragoons and the miquelets; for while these latter simply obeyed orders\r\nfrom Versailles, Nimes, or Montpellier, the former gratified a personal\r\nhate—a hate which had come down to them from their fathers, and which\r\nthey would pass on to their children.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the young Huguenot leader, who every day gained more\r\ninfluence over his soldiers, tried to make the dragoons and Cadets de la\r\nCroix suffer in return everything they inflicted on the Huguenots,\r\nexcept the murders. In the night from the 2nd to the 3rd October, about\r\nten o’clock, he came down into the plain and attacked Sommieres from two\r\ndifferent points, setting fire to the houses. The inhabitants seizing\r\ntheir arms, made a sortie, but Cavalier charged them at the head of the\r\nCavalry and forced them to retreat. Thereupon the governor, whose\r\ngarrison was too small to leave the shelter of the walls, turned his\r\nguns on them and fired, less in the hope of inflicting injury on them\r\nthan in that of being heard by the neighbouring garrisons.\r\n\r\nThe Camisards recognising this danger, retired, but not before they had\r\nburnt down the hotels of the Cheval-Blanc, the Croix-d’Or, the\r\nGrand-Louis, and the Luxembourg, as well as a great number of other\r\nhouses, and the church and the presbytery of Saint-Amand.\r\n\r\nThence the Camisards proceeded to Cayla and Vauvert, into which they\r\nentered, destroying the fortifications. There they provided themselves\r\nabundantly with provisions for man and beast. In Vauvert, which was\r\nalmost entirely inhabited by his co-religionists, Cavalier assembled the\r\ninhabitants in the market-place, and made them join with him in prayer\r\nto God, that He would prevent the king from following evil counsel; he\r\nalso exhorted his brethren to be ready to sacrifice their goods and\r\ntheir lives for the re-establishment of their religion, affirming that\r\nthe Holy Spirit had revealed to him that the arm of the Lord, which had\r\nalways come to their aid, was still stretched out over them.\r\n\r\nCavalier undertook these movements in the hope of interrupting the work\r\nof destruction going on in Upper Cevennes; and partly obtained the\r\ndesired result; for M. de Julien received orders to come down into the\r\nopen country and disperse the Camisards.\r\n\r\nThe troops tried to fulfil this task, but, thanks to the knowledge that\r\nthe rebels had of the country, it was impossible to come up with them,\r\nso that Fleshier, who was in the thick of the executions,\r\nconflagrations, and massacres, but who still found time to write Latin\r\nverse and gallant letters, said, in speaking of them, \"They were never\r\ncaught, and did all the damage they wished to do without let or\r\nhindrance. We laid their mountains waste, and they laid waste our plain.\r\nThere are no more churches left in our dioceses, and not being able\r\neither to plough or sow our lands, we have no revenues. We dread serious\r\nrevolt, and desire to avoid a religious civil war; so all our efforts\r\nare relaxing, we let our arms fall without knowing why, and we are told,\r\n’You must have patience; it is not possible to fight against phantoms.’\"\r\nNevertheless, from time to time, these phantoms became visible. Towards\r\nthe end of October, Cavalier came down to Uzes, carried off two\r\nsentinels who were guarding the gates, and hearing the call to arms\r\nwithin, shouted that he would await the governor of the city, M. de\r\nVergetot, near Lussan.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed Cavalier, accompanied by his two lieutenants, Ravanel and\r\nCatinat, took his way towards this little town, between Uzes and\r\nBargeac, which stands upon an eminence surrounded upon all sides by\r\ncliffs, which serve it as ramparts and render it very difficult of\r\naccess. Having arrived within three gun-shots of Lussan, Cavalier sent\r\nRavanel to demand provisions from the inhabitants; but they, proud of\r\ntheir natural ramparts, and believing their town impregnable, not only\r\nrefused to comply with the requisition, but fired several shots on the\r\nenvoy, one of which wounded in the arm a Camisard of the name of La\r\nGrandeur, who had accompanied Ravanel. Ravanel withdrew, supporting his\r\nwounded comrade, followed by shots and the hootings of the inhabitants.\r\nWhen they rejoined Cavalier and made their report, the young commander\r\nissued orders to his soldiers to make ready to take the town the next\r\nmorning; for, as night was already falling, he did not venture to start\r\nin the dark. In the meantime the besieged sent post-haste to M. de\r\nVergetot to warn him of their situation; and resolving to defend\r\nthemselves as long as they could, while waiting for a response to their\r\nmessage they set about barricading their gates, turned their scythes\r\ninto weapons, fastened large hooks on long poles, and collected all the\r\ninstruments they could find that could be used in attack or defence. As\r\nto the Camisards, they encamped for the night near an old chateau called\r\nFan, about a gun-shot from Lussan.\r\n\r\nAt break of day loud shouts from the town told the Camisards that the\r\nexpected relief was in sight, and looking out they saw in the distance a\r\ntroop of soldiers advancing towards them; it was M. de Vergetat at the\r\nhead of his regiment, accompanied by forty Irish officers.\r\n\r\nThe Protestants prepared themselves, as usual, by reciting psalms and\r\nprayers, notice without taking of the shouts and threats of any of the\r\ntownspeople, and having finished their invocations, they marched out to\r\nmeet the approaching column. The cavalry, commanded by Catinat, made a\r\ndetour, taking a sheltered way to an unguarded bridge over a small river\r\nnot far off, so as to outflank the royal forces, which they were to\r\nattack in the rear as soon as Cavalier and Ravanel should have engaged\r\nthem in front.\r\n\r\n  M. de Vergetot, on his side, continued to advance, so that the\r\n     Calvinists and the Catholics were soon face to face. The battle\r\n     began on both sides by a volley; but Cavalier having seen his\r\n     cavalry emerging from a neighbouring wood, and counting upon their\r\n     assistance, charged the enemy at the double quick. Catinat judging\r\n     by the noise of the firing that his presence was necessary, charged\r\n     also at a gallop, falling on the flank of the Catholics.\r\n\r\nIn this charge, one of M. de Vergetot’s captains was killed by a bullet,\r\nand the other by a sabre-cut, and the grenadiers falling into disorder,\r\nfirst lost ground and then fled, pursued by Catinat and his horsemen,\r\nwho, seizing them by the hair, despatched them with their swords. Having\r\ntried in vain to rally his men, M. de Vergetot, surrounded by a few\r\nIrish, was forced in his turn to fly; he was hotly pursued, and on the\r\npoint of being taken, when by good luck he reached the height of Gamene,\r\nwith its walls of rock. Jumping off his horse, he entered the narrow\r\npathway which led to the top, and entrenched himself with about a\r\nhundred men in this natural fort. Cavalier perceiving that further\r\npursuit would be dangerous, resolved to rest satisfied with his victory;\r\nas he knew by his own experience that neither men nor horses had eaten\r\nfor eighteen hours, he gave the signal for retreat, and retired on\r\nSeyne, where he hoped to find provisions.\r\n\r\nThis defeat mortified the royal forces very deeply, and they resolved to\r\ntake their revenge. Having learnt by their spies that on a certain night\r\nin November Cavalier and his band intended to sleep on a mountain called\r\nNages, they surrounded the mountain during the night, so that at dawn\r\nCavalier found himself shut in on every side. As he wished to see with\r\nhis own eyes if the investment was complete, he ordered his troops to\r\nfall into rank on the top of the mountain, giving the command to Ravanel\r\nand Catinat, and with a pair of pistols in his belt and his carbine on\r\nhis shoulder, he glided from bush to bush and rock to rock, determined,\r\nif any weak spot existed, to discover it; but the information he had\r\nreceived was perfectly correct, every issue was guarded.\r\n\r\nCavalier now set off to rejoin his troops, passing through a ravine, but\r\nhe had hardly taken thirty steps when he found himself confronted by a\r\ncornet and two dragoons who were lying in ambush. There was no time to\r\nrun away, and indeed such a thought never entered the young commander’s\r\nhead; he walked straight up to them. On their side, the dragoons\r\nadvanced towards him, and the cornet covering him with his pistol,\r\ncalled out, \"Halt! you are Cavalier; I know you. It is not possible for\r\nyou to escape; surrender at discretion.\" Cavalier’s answer was to blow\r\nout the cornet’s brains with a shot from his carbine, then throwing it\r\nbehind him as of no further use, he drew his two pistols from his belt,\r\nwalked up to the two dragoons, shot them both dead, and rejoined his\r\ncomrades unwounded. These, who had believed him lost, welcomed him with\r\ncheers.\r\n\r\nBut Cavalier had something else to do than to celebrate his return;\r\nmounting his horse, he put himself at the head of his men, and fell upon\r\nthe royal troops with such impetuosity that they gave way at the first\r\nonset. Then a strange incident occurred. About thirty women who had come\r\nto the camp with provisions, carried away by their enthusiasm at the\r\nsight of this success, threw themselves upon the enemy, fighting like\r\nmen. One young girl of about seventeen, Lucrese Guigon by name,\r\ndistinguished herself amongst the others by her great valour. Not\r\ncontent with encouraging her brethren by the cry of \"The sword of the\r\nLord and of Gideon!\" she tore sabres from the hands of the dead dragoons\r\nto despatch the dying. Catinat, followed by ten of his men, pursued the\r\nflying troops as far as the plain of Calvisson. There they were able to\r\nrally, thanks to the advance of the garrison to meet them.\r\n\r\nEighty dragoons lay dead on the field of battle, while Cavalier had only\r\nlost five men.\r\n\r\nAs we shall see, Cavalier was not only a brave soldier and a skilful\r\ncaptain, but also a just judge. A few days after the deed of arms which\r\nwe have just related, he learned that a horrible murder had been\r\ncommitted by four Camisards, who had then retired into the forest of\r\nBouquet. He sent a detachment of twenty men with orders to arrest the\r\nmurderers and bring them before him. The following are the details of\r\nthe crime:\r\n\r\nThe daughter of Baron Meyrargues, who was not long married to a\r\ngentleman named M. de Miraman, had set out on the 29th November for\r\nAmbroix to join her husband, who was waiting for her there. She was\r\nencouraged to do this by her coachman, who had often met with Camisards\r\nin the neighbourhood, and although a Catholic, had never received any\r\nharm from them. She occupied her own carriage, and was accompanied by a\r\nmaid, a nurse, a footman, and the coachman who had persuaded her to\r\nundertake the journey. Two-thirds of the way already lay safely behind\r\nthem, when between Lussan and Vaudras she was stopped by four, men, who\r\nmade her get out of her carriage and accompany them into the\r\nneighbouring forest. The account of what then happened is taken from the\r\ndeposition of the maid. We copy it word for word:\r\n\r\n\"These wretches having forced us,\" says she, \"to walk into the forest\r\ntill we were at some distance from the high road, my poor mistress grew\r\nso tired that she begged the man who walked beside her to allow her to\r\nlean on his shoulder. He looking round and seeing that they had reached\r\na lonely spot, replied, ’We need hardly go any farther,’ and made us sit\r\ndawn on a plot of grass which was to be the scene of our martyrdom. My\r\npoor mistress began to plead with the barbarians in the most touching\r\nmanner, and so sweetly that she would have softened the heart of a\r\ndemon. She offered them her purse, her gold waistband, and a fine\r\ndiamond which she drew from her finger; but nothing could move these\r\ntigers, and one of them said, ’I am going to kill all the Catholics at\r\nonce, and shall begin with you.’ ’What will you gain by my death?’\r\nasked my mistress. ’Spare my life.’—’No; shut up!’ replied he. ’You\r\nshall die by my hand. Say your prayers.’ My good mistress threw herself\r\nat once on her knees and prayed aloud that God would show mercy to her\r\nand to her murderers, and while she was thus praying she received a\r\npistol-shot in her left breast, and fell; a second assassin cut her\r\nacross the face with his sword, and a third dropped a large stone on her\r\nhead, while the fourth killed the nurse with a shot from his pistol.\r\nWhether it was that they had no more loaded firearms, or that they\r\nwished to save their ammunition, they were satisfied with only giving me\r\nseveral bayonet wounds. I pretended to be dead: they thought it was\r\nreally the case, and went away. Some time after, seeing that everything\r\nhad become quiet, and hearing no sound, I dragged myself, dying as I\r\nwas, to where my dear mistress lay, and called her. As it happened, she\r\nwas not quite dead, and she said in a faint voice, ’Stay with me, Suzon,\r\ntill I die.’ She added, after a short pause, for she was hardly able to\r\nspeak, ’I die for my religion, and I hope that God will have pity on me.\r\nTell my husband that I confide our little one to his care.’ Having said\r\nthis, she turned her thoughts from the world, praying to God in broken\r\nand tender words, and drew her last breath as the night fell.\"\r\n\r\nIn obedience to Cavalier’s orders, the four criminals were taken and\r\nbrought before him. He was then with his troops near Saint-Maurice de\r\nCasevielle; he called a council of war, and having had the prisoners\r\ntried for their atrocious deed, he summed up the evidence in as clear a\r\nmanner as any lawyer could have done, and called upon the judges to\r\npronounce sentence. All the judges agreed that the prisoners should be\r\nput to death, but just as the sentence was made known one of the\r\nassassins pushed aside the two men who guarded him, and jumping down a\r\nrock, disappeared in the forest before any attempt could be made to stop\r\nhim. The three others were shot.\r\n\r\nThe Catholics also condemned many to be executed, but the trials\r\nconducted by them were far from being as remarkable for honour and\r\njustice as was that which we have just described. We may instance the\r\ntrial of a poor boy of fourteen, the son of a miller of Saint-Christol\r\nwho had been broken the wheel just a month before. For a moment the\r\njudges hesitated to condemn so young a boy to death, but a witness\r\npresented himself who testified that the little fellow was employed by\r\nthe fanatics to strangle Catholic children. Although no one believed the\r\nevidence, yet it was seized-on as a pretext: the unfortunate boy was\r\ncondemned to death, and hanged without mercy an hour later.\r\n\r\nA great many people from the parishes devastated by M. de Julien had\r\ntaken refuge in Aussilargues, in the parish of St. Andre. Driven by\r\nhunger and misery, they went beyond the prescribed limits in search of\r\nmeans of subsistence. Planque hearing of this, in his burning zeal for\r\nthe Catholic faith resolved not to leave such a crime unpunished. He\r\ndespatched a detachment of soldiers to arrest the culprits: the task was\r\neasy, for they were all once more inside the barrier and in their beds.\r\nThey were seized, brought to St. Andre’s Church and shut in; then,\r\nwithout trial of any kind,—they were taken, five at a time, and\r\nmassacred: some were shot and some cut down with sword or axe; all were\r\nkilled without exception—old and young women and children. One of the\r\nlatter, who had received three shots was still able to raise his head\r\nand cry, \"Where is father? Why doesn’t he come and take me away.\"\r\n\r\nFour men and a young girl who had taken refuge in the town of Lasalle,\r\none of the places granted to the houseless villagers as an asylum, asked\r\nand received formal permission from the captain of the Soissonais\r\nregiment, by name Laplace, to go home on important private business, on\r\ncondition that they returned the same night. They promised, and in the\r\nintention of keeping this promise they all met on their way back at a\r\nsmall farmhouse. Just as they reached it a terrible storm came on. The\r\nmen were for continuing their way in spite of the weather, but the young\r\ngirl besought them to wait till daylight, as she did not dare to venture\r\nout in the dark during such a storm, and would die of fright if left\r\nalone at the farm. The men, ashamed to desert their companion, who was\r\nrelated to one of them, yielded to her entreaties and remained, hoping\r\nthat the storm would be a sufficient excuse for the delay. As soon as it\r\nwas light, the five resumed their journey. But the news of their crime\r\nhad reached the ears of Laplace before they got back. They were\r\narrested, and all their excuses were of no avail. Laplace ordered the\r\nmen to be taken outside the town and shot. The young girl was condemned\r\nto be hanged; and the sentence was to be carried out that very day, but\r\nsome nuns who had been sent for to prepare her for death, having vainly\r\nbegged Laplace to show mercy, entreated the girl to declare that she\r\nwould soon become a mother. She indignantly refused to save her life at\r\nthe cost of her good name, so the nuns took the lie on themselves and\r\nmade the necessary declaration before the captain, begging him if he had\r\nno pity for the mother to spare the child at least, by granting a\r\nreprieve till it should be born. The captain was not for a moment\r\ndeceived, but he sent for a midwife and ordered her to examine the young\r\ngirl. At the end of half an hour she declared that the assertion of the\r\nnuns was true.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said the captain: \"let them both be kept in prison for\r\nthree months; if by the end of that time the truth of this assertion is\r\nnot self-evident, both shall be hanged.\" When this decision was made\r\nknown to the poor woman, she was overcome by fear, and asked to see the,\r\ncaptain again, to whom she confessed that, led away by the entreaties of\r\nthe nuns, she had told a lie.\r\n\r\nUpon this, the woman was sentenced to be publicly whipped, and the young\r\ngirl hanged on a gibbet round which were placed the corpses of the four\r\nmen of whose death she was the cause.\r\n\r\nAs may easily be supposed, the \"Cadets of the Cross\" vied with both\r\nCatholics and Protestants in the work of destruction. One of their bands\r\ndevoted itself to destroying everything belonging to the new converts\r\nfrom Beaucaire to Nimes. They killed a woman and two children at\r\nCampuget, an old man of eighty at a farm near Bouillargues, several\r\npersons at Cicure, a young girl at Caissargues, a gardener at Nimes, and\r\nmany other persons, besides carrying off all the flocks, furniture, and\r\nother property they could lay hands on, and burning down the farmhouses\r\nof Clairan, Loubes, Marine, Carlot, Campoget Miraman, La Bergerie, and\r\nLarnac—all near St. Gilies and Manduel. \"They stopped travellers on the\r\nhighways,\" says Louvreloeil, \"and by way of finding out whether they\r\nwere Catholic or not, made them say in Latin the Lord’s Prayer, the Ave\r\nMaria, the Symbol of the Faith, and the General Confession, and those\r\nwho were unable to do this were put to the sword. In Dions nine corpses\r\nwere found supposed to have been killed by their hands, and when the\r\nbody of a shepherd who had been in the service of the Sieur de\r\nRoussiere, a former minister, was found hanging to a tree, no one\r\ndoubted who were the murderers. At last they went so far that one of\r\ntheir bands meeting the Abbe de Saint Gilles on the road, ordered him to\r\ndeliver up to them one of his servants, a new convert, in order to put\r\nhim to death. It was in vain that the abbe remonstrated with them,\r\ntelling them it was a shame to put such an affront on a man of his birth\r\nand rank; they persisted none the less in their determination, till at\r\nlast the abbe threw his arms round his servant and presented his own\r\nbody to the blows directed at the other.\"\r\n\r\nThe author of The Troubles in the Cevennes relates something surpassing\r\nall this which took place at Montelus on the 22nd February \"There were a\r\nfew Protestants in the place,\" he says, \"but they were far outnumbered\r\nby the Catholics; these being roused by a Capuchin from Bergerac, formed\r\nthemselves into a body of ’Cadets of the Cross,’ and hastened to serve\r\ntheir apprenticeship to the work of assassination at the cost of their\r\ncountrymen. They therefore entered the house of one Jean Bernoin, cut\r\noff his ears and further mutilated him, and then bled him to death like\r\na pig. On coming out of this house they met Jacques Clas, and shot him\r\nin the abdomen, so that his intestines obtruded; pushing them back, he\r\nreached his house in a terrible condition, to the great alarm of his\r\nwife, who was near her confinement, and her children, who hastened to\r\nthe help of husband and father. But the murderers appeared on the\r\nthreshold, and, unmoved by the cries and tears of the unfortunate wife\r\nand the poor little children, they finished the wounded man, and as the\r\nwife made an effort to prevent them, they murdered her also, treating\r\nher dead body, when they discovered her condition, in a manner too\r\nrevolting for description; while a neighbour, called Marie Silliot, who\r\ntried to rescue the children, was shot dead; but in her case they did\r\nnot pursue their vengeance any further. They then went into the open\r\ncountry and meeting Pierre and Jean Bernard, uncle and nephew, one aged\r\nforty-five and the other ten, seized on them both, and putting a pistol\r\ninto the hands of the child, forced him to shoot his uncle. In the\r\nmeantime the boy’s father had come up, and him they tried to constrain\r\nto shoot his son; but finding that no threats had any effect, they ended\r\nby killing both, one by the sword, the other by the bayonet.\r\n\r\n\"The reason why they put an end to father and son so quickly was that\r\nthey had noticed three young girls of Bagnols going towards a grove of\r\nmulberry trees, where they were raising silk-worms. The men followed\r\nthem, and as it was broad daylight and the girls were therefore not\r\nafraid, they soon came up with them. Having first violated them, they\r\nhung them by the feet to a tree, and put them to death in a horrible\r\nmanner.\"\r\n\r\nAll this took place in the reign of Louis the Great, and for the greater\r\nglory of the Catholic religion.\r\n\r\nHistory has preserved the names of the five wretches who perpetrated\r\nthese crimes: they were Pierre Vigneau, Antoine Rey, Jean d’Hugon,\r\nGuillaume, and Gontanille.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch crimes, of which we have only described a few, inspired horror in\r\nthe breasts of those who were neither maddened by fanaticism nor\r\ndevoured by the desire of vengeance. One of these, a Protestant, Baron\r\nd’Aygaliers, without stopping to consider what means he had at his\r\ncommand or what measures were the best to take to accomplish his object,\r\nresolved to devote his life to the pacification of the Cevennes. The\r\nfirst thing to be considered was, that if the Camisards were ever\r\nentirely destroyed by means of Catholic troops directed by de Baville,\r\nde Julien, and de Montrevel, the Protestants, and especially the\r\nProtestant nobles who had never borne arms, would be regarded as\r\ncowards, who had been prevented by fear of death or persecution from\r\nopenly taking the part of the Huguenots: He was therefore convinced that\r\nthe only course to pursue was to get, his co-religionists to put an end\r\nto the struggle themselves, as the one way of pleasing His Majesty and\r\nof showing him how groundless were the suspicions aroused in the minds\r\nof men by the Catholic clergy.\r\n\r\nThis plan presented, especially to Baron d’Aygaliers, two apparently\r\ninsurmountable difficulties, for it could only be carried out by\r\ninducing the king to relax his rigorous measures and by inducing the\r\nCamisards to submit. Now the baron had no connection with the court, and\r\nwas not personally acquainted with a single Huguenot chief.\r\n\r\nThe first thing necessary to enable the baron to begin his efforts was a\r\npassport for Paris, and he felt sure that as he was a Protestant neither\r\nM. de Baville nor M. de Montrevel would give him one. A lucky accident,\r\nhowever, relieved his embarrassment and strengthened his resolution, for\r\nhe thought he saw in this accident the hand of Providence.\r\n\r\nBaron d’Aygaliers found one day at the house of a friend a M. de\r\nParatte, a colonel in the king’s army, and who afterwards became\r\nmajor-general, but who at the time we are speaking of was commandant at\r\nUzes. He was of a very impulsive disposition, and so zealous in matters\r\nrelating to the Catholic religion and in the service of the king, that\r\nhe never could find himself in the presence of a Protestant without\r\nexpressing his indignation at those who had taken up arms against their\r\nprince, and also those who without taking up arms encouraged the rebels\r\nin their designs. M. d’Aygaliers understood that an allusion was meant\r\nto himself, and he resolved to take advantage of it.\r\n\r\nSo the next day he paid a visit to M. de Paratte, and instead of\r\ndemanding satisfaction, as the latter quite expected, for the rudeness\r\nof his remarks on the previous day, he professed himself very much\r\nobliged for what he had said, which had made such a deep impression on\r\nhim that he had made up his mind to give proof of his zeal and loyalty\r\nby going to Paris and petitioning the king for a position at court. De\r\nParatte, charmed with what he had heard, and enchanted with his convert,\r\nembraced d’Aygaliers, and gave him, says the chronicler, his blessing;\r\nand with the blessing a passport, and wished him all the success that a\r\nfather could wish for his son. D’Aygaliers had now attained his object,\r\nand furnished with the lucky safe-conduct, he set out for Paris, without\r\nhaving communicated his intentions to anyone, not even to his mother.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Paris he put up at a friend’s house, and drew up a statement\r\nof his plan: it was very short and very clear.\r\n\r\n\"The undersigned has the honour to point out humbly to His Majesty:\r\n\r\n\"That the severities and the persecutions which have been employed by\r\nsome of the village priests have caused many people in the country\r\ndistricts to take up arms, and that the suspicions which new converts\r\nexcited have driven a great many of them to join the insurgents. In\r\ntaking this step they were also impelled by the desire to avoid\r\nimprisonment or removal from their homes, which were the remedies chosen\r\nto keep them in the old faith. This being the case, he thinks that the\r\nbest means of putting an end to this state of things would be to take\r\nmeasures exactly the contrary of those which produced it, such as\r\nputting an end to the persecutions and permitting a certain number of\r\nthose of the Reformed religion to bear arms, that they might go to the\r\nrebels and tell them that far from approving of their actions the\r\nProtestants as a whole wished to bring them back to the right way by\r\nsetting them a good example, or to fight against them in order to show\r\nthe king and France, at the risk of their lives, that they disapproved\r\nof the conduct of their co-religionists, and that the priests had been\r\nin the wrong in writing to the court that all those of the Reformed\r\nreligion were in favour of revolt.\"\r\n\r\nD’Aygaliers hoped that the court would adopt this plan; for if they did,\r\none of two things must happen: either the Camisards, by refusing to\r\naccept the terms offered to them, would make themselves odious to their\r\nbrethren (for d’Aygaliers intended to take with him on his mission of\r\npersuasion only men of high reputation among the Reformers, who would be\r\nrepelled by the Camisards if they refused to submit), or else; by laying\r\ndown their arms and submitting, they would restore peace to the South of\r\nFrance, obtain liberty of worship, set free their brethren from the\r\nprisons and galleys, and come to the help of the king in his war against\r\nthe allied powers, by supplying him in a moment with a large body of\r\ndisciplined troops ready to take the field against his enemies; for not\r\nonly would the Camisards, if they were supplied with officers, be\r\navailable for this purpose, but also those troops which were at the\r\nmoment employed in hunting down the Camisards would be set free for this\r\nimportant duty.\r\n\r\nThis proposition was so clear and promised to produce such useful\r\nresults, that although the prejudice against the Reformers was very\r\nstrong, Baron d’Aygaliers found supporters who were at once intelligent\r\nand genuine in the Duke de Chevreuse and the Duke de Montfort, his son.\r\nThese two gentlemen brought about a meeting between the baron and\r\nChamillard, and the latter presented him to the Marechal de Villars, to\r\nwhom he showed his petition, begging him to bring it to the notice of\r\nthe king; but M. de Villars, who was well acquainted with the obstinacy\r\nof Louis, who, as Baron de Peken says, \"only saw the Reformers through\r\nthe spectacles of Madame de Maintenon,\" told d’Aygaliers that the last\r\nthing he should do would be to give the king any hint of his plans,\r\nunless he wished to see them come to nothing; on the contrary, he\r\nadvised him to go at once to Lyons and wait there for him, M. de\r\nVillars; for he would probably be passing through that town in a few\r\ndays, being almost certain to be appointed governor of Languedoc in\r\nplace of M. de Montrevel, who had fallen under the king’s displeasure\r\nand was about to be recalled. In the course of the three interviews\r\nwhich d’Aygaliers had had with M. de Villars, he had become convinced\r\nthat de Villars was a man capable of understanding his object; he\r\ntherefore followed his advice, as he believed his knowledge of the king\r\nto be correct, and left Paris for Lyons.\r\n\r\nThe recall of M. de Montrevel had been brought about in the following\r\nmanner:—M. de Montrevel having just come to Uzes, learned that Cavalier\r\nand his troops were in the neighbourhood of Sainte-Chatte; he\r\nimmediately sent M. de La Jonquiere, with six hundred picked marines and\r\nsome companies of dragoons from the regiment of Saint-Sernin, but half\r\nan hour later, it having occurred to him that these forces were not\r\nsufficient, he ordered M. de Foix, lieutenant of the dragoons of\r\nFimarqon, to join M. de La Jonquiere at Sainte-Chatte with a hundred\r\nsoldiers of his regiment, and to remain with him if he were wanted; if\r\nnot, to return the same night.\r\n\r\n  M. de Foix gave the necessary orders, chose a hundred of his bravest\r\n     men, put himself at their head, and joined M. de La Jonquiere,\r\n     showing him his orders; but the latter, confiding in the courage of\r\n     his soldiers and unwilling to share with anyone the glory of a\r\n     victory of which he felt assured, not only sent away M. de Foix,\r\n     but begged him to go back to Uzes, declaring to him that he had\r\n     enough troops to fight and conquer all the Camisards whom he might\r\n     encounter; consequently the hundred dragoons whom the lieutenant\r\n     had brought with him were quite useless at Sainte-Chatte, while on\r\n     the contrary they might be very necessary somewhere else. M. de\r\n     Foix did not consider that it was his duty to insist on remaining\r\n     under these circumstances, and returned to Uzes, while M. de La\r\n     Jonquiere continued his route in order to pass the night at\r\n     Moussac. Cavalier left the town by one gate just as M. de La\r\n     Jonquiere entered at the other. The wishes of the young Catholic\r\n     commander were thus in a fair way to be fulfilled, for in all\r\n     probability he would come up with his enemy the next day.\r\n\r\nAs the village was inhabited for the most part by new converts, the\r\nnight instead of being spent in repose was devoted to pillage.\r\n\r\nThe next day the Catholic troops reached Moussac, which they found\r\ndeserted, so they went on to Lascours-de-Gravier, a little village\r\nbelonging to the barony of Boucairan, which M. de La Jonquiere gave up\r\nto pillage, and where he had four Protestants shot—a man, a woman, and\r\ntwo young girls. He then resumed his route. As it had rained, he soon\r\ncame on the trail of the Camisards, the terrible game which he was\r\nhunting down. For three hours he occupied himself in this pursuit,\r\nmarching at the head of his troops, lest someone else less careful than\r\nhe should make some mistake, when, suddenly raising his eyes, he\r\nperceived the Camisards on a small eminence called Les Devois de\r\nMaraignargues. This was the spot they had chosen to await attack in,\r\nbeing eager for the approaching combat.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Cavalier saw the royals advancing, he ordered his men,\r\naccording to custom, to offer up prayers to God, and when these were\r\nfinished he disposed his troops for battle. His plan was to take up\r\nposition with the greater part of his men on the other side of a ravine,\r\nwhich would thus form a kind of moat between him and the king’s\r\nsoldiers; he also ordered about thirty horsemen to make a great round,\r\nthus reaching unseen a little wood about two hundred yards to his left,\r\nwhere they could conceal themselves; and lastly, he sent to a point on\r\nthe right sixty foot-soldiers chosen from his best marksmen, whom he\r\nordered not to fire until the royal forces were engaged in the struggle\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n  M. de La Jonquiere having approached to within a certain distance,\r\n     halted, and sent one of his lieutenants named de Sainte-Chatte to\r\n     make a reconnaissance, which he did, advancing beyond the men in\r\n     ambush, who gave no sign of their existence, while the officer\r\n     quietly examined the ground. But Sainte-Chatte was an old soldier\r\n     of fortune and not easily taken in, so on his return, while\r\n     explaining the plan of the ground chosen by Cavalier for the\r\n     disposition of his troops to M. de La Jonquiere, he added that he\r\n     should be very much astonished if the young Camisard had not\r\n     employed the little wood on his left and the lie of the ground on\r\n     his right as cover for soldiers in ambush; but M. de La Jonquiere\r\n     returned that the only thing of importance was to know the position\r\n     of the principal body of troops in order to attack it at once.\r\n     Sainte-Chatte told him that the principal body was that which was\r\n     before his eyes, and that on this subject there could be no\r\n     mistake; for he had approached near enough to recognise Cavalier\r\n     himself in the front rank.\r\n\r\nThis was enough for M. de La Jonquiere: he put himself at the head of\r\nhis men and rode straight to the ravine, beyond which Cavalier and his\r\ncomrades awaited him in order of battle. Having got within a\r\npistol-shot, M. de La Jonquiere gave the order to fire, but he was so\r\nnear that Cavalier heard the words and saw the motion made by the men as\r\nthey made ready; he therefore gave a rapid sign to his men, who threw\r\nthemselves on their faces, as did their leader, and the bullets passed\r\nover them without doing any harm M.M. de La Jonquiere, who believed them\r\nall dead, was astonished when Cavalier and his Camisards rose up and\r\nrushed upon the royal troops, advancing to the sound of a psalm. At a\r\ndistance of ten paces they fired, and then charged the enemy at the\r\npoint of the bayonet. At this moment the sixty men in ambush to the\r\nright opened fire, while the thirty horsemen to the left, uttering loud\r\nshouts, charged at a gallop. Hearing this noise, and seeing death\r\napproach them in three different directions, the royals believed\r\nthemselves surrounded, and did not attempt to make a stand; the men,\r\nthrowing away their weapons, took to their heels, the officers alone and\r\na few dragoons whom they had succeeded in rallying making a desperate\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\nCavalier was riding over the field of battle, sabring all the fugitives\r\nwhom he met, when he caught sight of a group, composed of ten naval\r\nofficers; standing close together and back to back, spontoon in hand,\r\nfacing the Camisards, who surrounded them. He spurred up to them,\r\npassing through the ranks of his soldiers, and not pausing till he was\r\nwithin fifteen paces of them, although they raised their weapons to\r\nfire. Then making a sign with his hand that he wished to speak to them,\r\nhe said, \"Gentlemen, surrender. I shall give quarter, and in return for\r\nthe ten lives I now spare you, will ask that my father, who is in prison\r\nat Nimes, be released.\"\r\n\r\nFor sole answer, one of the officers fired and wounded the young chief’s\r\nhorse in the head. Cavalier drew a pistol from his belt, took aim at the\r\nofficer and killed him, then turning again to the others, he asked,\r\n\"Gentlemen, are you as obstinate as your comrade, or do you accept my\r\noffer?\" A second shot was the reply, and a bullet grazed his shoulder.\r\nSeeing that no other answer was to be hoped for, Cavalier turned to his\r\nsoldiers. \"Do your duty,\" said he, and withdrew, to avoid seeing the\r\nmassacre. The nine officers were shot.\r\n\r\n  M. de La Jonquiere, who had received a slight wound in the cheek,\r\n     abandoned his horse in order to climb over a wall. On the other\r\n     side he made a dragoon dismount and give him his horse, on which he\r\n     crossed the river Gardon, leaving behind him on the battlefield\r\n     twenty-five officers and six hundred soldiers killed. This defeat\r\n     was doubly disastrous to the royal cause, depriving it of the\r\n     flower of its officers, almost all of those who fell belonging to\r\n     the noblest families of France, and also because the Camisards\r\n     gained what they so badly needed, muskets, swords, and bayonets in\r\n     great quantities, as well as eighty horses, these latter enabling\r\n     Cavalier to complete the organisation of a magnificent troop of\r\n     cavalry.\r\n\r\nThe recall of the Marechal de Montrevel was the consequence of this\r\ndefeat, and M. de Villars, as he had anticipated, was appointed in his\r\nplace. But before giving up his governorship Montrevel resolved to\r\nefface the memory of the check which his lieutenant’s foolhardiness had\r\ncaused, but for which, according to the rules of war, the general had to\r\npay the penalty. His plan was by spreading false rumours and making\r\nfeigned marches to draw the Camisards into a trap in which they, in\r\ntheir turn, would be caught. This was the less difficult to accomplish\r\nas their latest great victory had made Cavalier over confident both in\r\nhimself and his men.\r\n\r\nIn fact, since the incident connected with the naval officers the troops\r\nof Cavalier had increased enormously in numbers, everyone desiring to\r\nserve under so brave a chief, so that he had now under him over one\r\nthousand infantry and two hundred cavalry; they were furnished, besides,\r\njust like regular troops, with a bugler for the cavalry, and eight drums\r\nand a fife for the infantry.\r\n\r\nThe marechal felt sure that his departure would be the signal for some\r\nexpedition into the level country under Cavalier, so it was given out\r\nthat he had left for Montpellier, and had sent forward some of his\r\nbaggage-waggons to that place. On April 15th he was informed that\r\nCavalier, deceived by the false news, had set out on the 16th April,\r\nintending to pass the night at Caveyrac, a small town about a league\r\nfrom Nimes, that he might be ready next day to make a descent on La\r\nVannage. This news was brought to M. de Montrevel by a village priest\r\ncalled Verrien, who had in his pay vigilant and faithful spies in whom\r\nhe had every confidence.\r\n\r\nMontrevel accordingly ordered the commandant of Lunel, M. de Grandval,\r\nto set out the next day, very early in the morning, with the Charolais\r\nregiment and five companies of the Fimarcon and Saint-Sernin dragoons,\r\nand to repair to the heights of Boissieres, where instructions would\r\nawait him. Sandricourt, governor of Nimes, was at the same time directed\r\nto withdraw as many men as possible from the garrison, both Swiss and\r\ndragoons, and send them by night towards Saint-Come and Clarensac;\r\nlastly, he himself set out, as he had said, but instead of going on to\r\nMontpellier, he stopped at Sommieres, whence he could observe the\r\nmovements of Cavalier.\r\n\r\nCavalier, as M. de Montrevel already knew, was to sleep on the 15th at\r\nCaveyrac. On this day Cavalier reached the turning-point in his\r\nmagnificent career. As he entered the town with his soldiers, drums\r\nbeating and flags flying, he was at the zenith of his power. He rode the\r\nsplendid horse M. de La Jonquiere had abandoned in his flight; behind\r\nhim, serving as page, rode his young brother, aged ten, followed by four\r\ngrooms; he was preceded by twelve guards dressed in red; and as his\r\ncolleague Roland had taken the title of Comte, he allowed himself to be\r\ncalled Duke of the Cevennes.\r\n\r\nAt his approach half of the garrison, which was commanded by M. de\r\nMaillan, took possession of the church and half of the citadel; but as\r\nCavalier was more bent on obtaining food and rest for his soldiers than\r\nof disturbing the town, he billeted his men on the townspeople, and\r\nplaced sentinels at the church and fortress, who exchanged shots all the\r\nnight through with the royal troops. The next morning, having destroyed\r\nthe fortifications, he marched out of the town again, drums beating and\r\nflags flying as before. When almost in sight of Nimes he made his\r\ntroops, which had never before been so numerous or so brilliant, perform\r\na great many evolutions, and then continued his way towards Nages.\r\n\r\n  M. de Montrevel received a report at nine o’clock in the morning of\r\n     the direction Cavalier and his troops had taken, and immediately\r\n     left Sommieres, followed by six companies of Fimarqon dragoons, one\r\n     hundred Irish free-lances, three hundred rank and file of the\r\n     Hainault regiment, and one company each of the Soissonnais,\r\n     Charolais, and Menon regiments, forming in all a corps over nine\r\n     hundred strong. They took the direction of Vaunages, above\r\n     Clarensac; but suddenly hearing the rattle of musketry behind them,\r\n     they wheeled and made for Langlade.\r\n\r\nThey found that Grandval had already encountered the Camisards. These\r\nbeing fatigued had withdrawn into a hollow between Boissieres and the\r\nwindmill at Langlade, in order to rest. The infantry lay down, their\r\narms beside them; the cavalry placed themselves at the feet of their\r\nhorses, the bridle on arm. Cavalier himself, Cavalier the indefatigable,\r\nbroken by the fatigues of the preceding days, had fallen asleep, with\r\nhis young brother watching beside him. Suddenly he felt himself shaken\r\nby the arm, and rousing up, he heard on all sides cries of \"Kill! Kill!\"\r\nand \"To arms! To arms!\" Grandval and his men, who had been sent to find\r\nout where the Camisards were, had suddenly come upon them.\r\n\r\nThe infantry formed, the cavalry sprang to their saddles, Cavalier\r\nleaped on his horse, and drawing his sword, led his soldiers as usual\r\nagainst the dragoons, and these, as was also usual, ran away, leaving\r\ntwelve of their number dead on the field. The Camisard cavalry soon gave\r\nup the pursuit, as they found themselves widely separated from the\r\ninfantry and from their leader; for Cavalier had been unable to keep up\r\nwith them, his horse having received a bullet through its neck.\r\n\r\nStill they followed the flying dragoons for a good hour, from time to\r\ntime a wounded dragoon falling from his horse, till at last the Camisard\r\ncavalry found itself confronted by the Charolais regiment, drawn up in\r\nbattle array, and behind them the royal dragoons, who had taken refuge\r\nthere, and were re-forming.\r\n\r\nCarried on by the rapidity of their course, the Camisards could not pull\r\nup till they were within a hundred yards of the enemy; they fired once,\r\nkilling several, then turned round and retreated.\r\n\r\nWhen a third of the way, back had been covered, they met their chief,\r\nwho had found a fresh horse by the wayside standing beside its dead\r\nmaster. He arrived at full gallop, as he was anxious to unite his\r\ncavalry and infantry at once, as he had seen the forces of the marechal\r\nadvancing, who, as we have already said, had turned in the direction of\r\nthe firing. Hardly had Cavalier effected the desired junction of his\r\nforces than he perceived that his retreat was cut off. He had the royal\r\ntroops both before and behind him.\r\n\r\nThe young chief saw that a desperate dash to right or left was all that\r\nremained to him, and not knowing this country as well as the Cevennes,\r\nhe asked a peasant the way from Soudorgues to Nages, that being the only\r\none by which he could escape. There was no time to inquire whether the\r\npeasant was Catholic or Protestant; he could only trust to chance, and\r\nfollow the road indicated. But a few yards from the spot where the road\r\nfrom Doudorgues to Nages joins the road to Nimes he found himself in\r\nface of Marechal Montrevel’s troops under the command of Menon. However,\r\nas they hardly outnumbered the Camisards, these did not stop to look for\r\nanother route, but bending forward in their saddles, they dashed through\r\nthe lines at full gallop, taking the direction of Nages, hoping to reach\r\nthe plain round Calvisson. But the village, the approaches, the issues\r\nwere all occupied by royal troops, and at the same time Grandval and the\r\nmarechal joined forces, while Menon collected his men together and\r\npushed forward. Cavalier was completely surrounded: he gave the\r\nsituation a comprehensive glance—his foes, were five to one.\r\n\r\nRising in his stirrups, so that he could see over every head, Cavalier\r\nshouted so loud that not only his own men heard but also those of the\r\nenemy: \"My children, if our hearts fail us now, we shall be taken and\r\nbroken on the wheel. There is only one means of safety: we must cut our\r\nway at full gallop through these people. Follow me, and keep close\r\norder!\"\r\n\r\nSo speaking, he dashed on the nearest group, followed by all his men,\r\nwho formed a compact mass; round which the three corps of royal troops\r\nclosed. Then there was everywhere a hand-to-hand battle there was no\r\ntime to load and fire; swords flashed and fell, bayonets stabbed, the\r\nroyals and the Camisards took each other by the throat and hair. For an\r\nhour this demoniac fight lasted, during which Cavalier lost five hundred\r\nmen and slew a thousand of the enemy. At last he won through, followed\r\nby about two hundred of his troops, and drew a long breath; but finding\r\nhimself in the centre of a large circle of soldiers, he made for a\r\nbridge, where alone it seemed possible to break through, it being only\r\nguarded by a hundred dragoons.\r\n\r\nHe divided his men into two divisions, one to force the bridge, the\r\nother to cover the retreat. Then he faced his foes like a wild boar\r\ndriven to bay.\r\n\r\nSuddenly loud shouts behind him announced that the bridge was forced;\r\nbut the Camisards, instead of keeping the passage open for their leader,\r\nscattered over the plain and sought safety in flight. But a child threw\r\nhimself before them, pistol in hand. It was Cavalier’s young brother,\r\nmounted on one of the small wild horses of Camargues of that Arab breed\r\nwhich was introduced into Languedoc by the Moors from Spain. Carrying a\r\nsword and carbine proportioned to his size, the boy addressed the flying\r\nmen. \"Where are you going?\" he cried, \"Instead of running away like\r\ncowards, line the river banks and oppose the enemy to facilitate my\r\nbrother’s escape.\" Ashamed of having deserved such reproaches, the\r\nCamisards stopped, rallied, lined the banks of the river, and by keeping\r\nup a steady fire, covered Cavalier’s retreat, who crossed without having\r\nreceived a single wound, though his horse was riddled with bullets and\r\nhe had been forced to change his sword three times.\r\n\r\nStill the combat raged; but gradually Cavalier managed to retreat: a\r\nplain cut by trenches, the falling darkness, a wood which afforded\r\ncover, all combined to help him at last. Still his rearguard, harassed\r\nby the enemy, dotted the ground it passed over with its dead, until at\r\nlast both victors and vanquished were swallowed up by night. The fight\r\nhad lasted ten hours, Cavalier had lost more than five hundred men, and\r\nthe royals about a thousand.\r\n\r\n\"Cavalier,\" says M. de Villars, in his Memoirs, \"acted on this day in a\r\nway which astonished everyone. For who could help being astonished to\r\nsee a nobody, inexperienced in the art of warfare, bear himself in such\r\ndifficult and trying circumstances like some great general? At one\r\nperiod of the day he was followed everywhere by a dragoon; Cavalier shot\r\nat him and killed his horse. The dragoon returned the shot, but missed.\r\nCavalier had two horses killed under him; the first time he caught a\r\ndragoon’s horse, the second time he made one of his own men dismount and\r\ngo on foot.\"\r\n\r\n  M. de Montrevel also showed himself to be a gallant soldier; wherever\r\n     there was danger there was he, encouraging officers and soldiers by\r\n     his example: one Irish captain was killed at his side, another\r\n     fatally wounded, and a third slightly hurt. Grandval, on his part,\r\n     had performed miracles: his horse was shot under him, and M. de\r\n     Montrevel replaced it by one of great value, on which he joined in\r\n     the pursuit of the Camisards. After this affair M. de Montrevel\r\n     gave up his place to M. de Villars, leaving word for Cavalier that\r\n     it was thus he took leave of his friends.\r\n\r\nAlthough Cavalier came out of this battle with honour, compelling even\r\nhis enemies to regard him as a man worthy of their steel, it had\r\nnevertheless destroyed the best part of his hopes. He made a halt-near\r\nPierredon to gather together the remnant of his troops, and truly it was\r\nbut a remnant which remained. Of those who came back the greater number\r\nwere without weapons, for they had thrown them away in their flight.\r\nMany were incapacitated for service by their wounds; and lastly, the\r\ncavalry could hardly be said to exist any longer, as the few men who\r\nsurvived had been obliged to abandon their horses, in order to get\r\nacross the high ditches which were their only cover from the dragoons\r\nduring the flight.\r\n\r\nMeantime the royalists were very active, and Cavalier felt that it would\r\nbe imprudent to remain long at Pierredon, so setting out during the\r\nnight, and crossing the Gardon, he buried himself in the forest of\r\nHieuzet, whither he hoped his enemies would not venture to follow him.\r\nAnd in fact the first two days were quiet, and his troops benefited\r\ngreatly by the rest, especially as they were able to draw stores of all\r\nkinds—wheat, hay, arms, and ammunition—from an immense cave which the\r\nCamisards had used for a long time as a magazine and arsenal. Cavalier\r\nnow also employed it as a hospital, and had the wounded carried there,\r\nthat their wounds might receive attention.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Cavalier was soon obliged to quit the forest, in spite of\r\nhis hopes of being left in peace; for one day on his way back from a\r\nvisit to the wounded in the cave, whose existence was a secret, he came\r\nacross a hundred miquelets who had penetrated thus far, and who would\r\nhave taken him prisoner if he had not, with his, accustomed presence of\r\nmind and courage, sprung from a rock twenty feet high. The miquelets\r\nfired at him, but no bullet reached him. Cavalier rejoined his troops,\r\nbut fearing to attract the rest of the royalists to the place,—retreated\r\nto some distance from the cave, as it was of the utmost importance that\r\nit should not be discovered, since it contained all his resources.\r\n\r\nCavalier had now reached one of those moments when Fortune, tired of\r\nconferring favours, turns her back on the favourite. The royalists had\r\noften noticed an old woman from the village of Hieuzet going towards the\r\nforest, sometimes carrying a basket in her hand, sometimes with a hamper\r\non her head, and it occurred to them that she was supplying the hidden\r\nCamisards with provisions. She was arrested and brought before General\r\nLalande, who began his examination by threatening that he would have her\r\nhanged if she did not at once declare the object of her frequent\r\njourneys to the forest without reserve. At first she made use of all\r\nkinds of pretexts, which only strengthened the suspicions of Lalande,\r\nwho, ceasing his questions, ordered her to be taken to the gallows and\r\nhanged. The old woman walked to the place of execution with such a firm\r\nstep that the general began to think he would get no information from\r\nher, but at the foot of the ladder her courage failed. She asked to be\r\ntaken back before the general, and having been promised her life, she\r\nrevealed everything.\r\n\r\n  M. de Lalande put himself at once at the head of a strong detachment\r\n     of miquelets, and forced the woman to walk before them till they\r\n     reached the cavern, which they never would have discovered without\r\n     a guide, so cleverly was the entrance hidden by rocks and\r\n     brushwood. On entering, the first thing that met their eye was the\r\n     wounded, about thirty in number. The miquelets threw themselves\r\n     upon them and slaughtered them. This deed accomplished, they went\r\n     farther into the cave, which to their great surprise contained a\r\n     thousand things they never expected to find there—heaps of grain,\r\n     sacks of flour, barrels of wine, casks of brandy, quantities of\r\n     chestnuts and potatoes; and besides all this, chests containing\r\n     ointments, drugs and lint, and lastly a complete arsenal of\r\n     muskets, swords, and bayonets, a quantity of powder ready-made, and\r\n     sulphur, saltpetre, and charcoal-in short, everything necessary for\r\n     the manufacture of more, down to small mills to be turned by hand.\r\n     Lalande kept his word: the life of an old woman was not too much to\r\n     give in return for such a treasure.\r\n\r\nMeantime M. de Villars, as he had promised, took up Baron d’Aygaliers in\r\npassing through Lyons, so that during the rest of the journey the\r\npeacemaker had plenty of time to expatiate on his plans. As M. de\r\nVillars was a man of tact and a lover of justice, and desired above all\r\nthings to bring a right spirit to bear on the performance of the duties\r\nof his new office, in which his two predecessors had failed, he promised\r\nthe baron \"to keep,\" as he expressed himself, his \"two ears open\" and\r\nlisten to both sides, and as a first proof of impartiality—he refused to\r\ngive any opinion until he had heard M. de Julien, who was coming to meet\r\nhim at Tournon.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at Tournon, M. de Julien was there to receive them,\r\nand had a very different story to tell from that which M. de Villars had\r\nheard from d’Aygaliers. According to him, the only pacific ration\r\npossible was the complete extermination of the Camisards. He felt\r\nhimself very hardly treated in that he had been allowed to destroy only\r\nfour hundred villages and hamlets in the Upper Cevennes,—assuring de\r\nVillars with the confidence of a man who had studied the matter\r\nprofoundly, that they should all have been demolished without exception,\r\nand all the peasants killed to the last man.\r\n\r\nSo it came to pass that M. de Villars arrived at Beaucaire placed like\r\nDon Juan between the spirits of good and evil, the one advising clemency\r\nand the other murder. M. de Villars not being able to make up his mind,\r\non reaching Nimes, d’Aygaliers assembled the principal Protestants of\r\nthe town, told them of his plan, showing them its practicability, so\r\nthat also joined in the good work, and drew up a document in which they\r\nasked the marechal to allow them to take up arms and march against the\r\nrebels, as they were determined either to bring them back into the good\r\nway by force of example or to fight them as a proof of their loyalty.\r\n\r\nThis petition, which was signed by several nobles and by almost all the\r\nlawyers and merchants of the city of Nimes, was presented to M. de\r\nVillars on Tuesday, 22nd April, 1704, by M. de Albenas, at the head of\r\nseven or eight hundred persons of the Reformed religion. M. de Villars\r\nreceived the request kindly, thanked its bearer and those who\r\naccompanied him, assuring them that he had no doubt of the sincerity of\r\ntheir professions, and that if he were in want of help he would have\r\nrecourse to them with as much confidence as if they were old Catholics.\r\nHe hoped, however, to win the rebels back by mildness, and he begged\r\nthem to second his efforts in this direction by spreading abroad the\r\nfact that an amnesty was offered to all those who would lay down arms\r\nand return to their houses within a week. The very next day but one, M.\r\nde Villars set out from Nimes to visit all the principal towns, in order\r\nto make himself acquainted with men, things, and places.\r\n\r\nAlthough the answer to the petition had been a delicate refusal,\r\nd’Aygaliers was not discouraged, but followed M. de Villars everywhere.\r\nWhen the latter arrived at Alais, the new governor sent for MM. de\r\nLalande and de Baville, in order to consult them as to the best means of\r\ninducing the Camisards to lay down their arms. Baron d’Aygaliers was\r\nsummoned to this consultation, and described his plan to the two\r\ngentlemen. As he expected, both were opposed to it; however, he tried to\r\nbring them over to his side by presenting to them what seemed to him to\r\nbe cogent reasons for its adoption. But de Lalande and de Baville made\r\nlight of all his reasons, and rejected his proposals with such\r\nvehemence, that the marechal, however much inclined to the side of\r\nd’Aygaliers, did not venture to act quite alone, and said he would not\r\ndecide on any course until he reached Uzes.\r\n\r\nD’Aygaliers saw clearly that until he had obtained the approbation of\r\neither the general or the intendant, he would get nothing from the\r\nmarechal. He therefore considered which of the two he should try to\r\npersuade, and although de Baville was his personal enemy, having several\r\ntimes shown his hatred for him and his family, he decided to address\r\nhimself to him.\r\n\r\nIn consequence, the next day, to the great astonishment of M. de\r\nBaville, d’Aygaliers paid him a visit. The intendant received him coldly\r\nbut politely, asked him to sit down, and when he was seated begged to\r\nknow the motive which had brought him. \"Sir,\" replied the baron, \"you\r\nhave given my family and me such cause of offence that I had come to the\r\nfirm resolution never to ask a favour of you, and as perhaps you may\r\nhave remarked during the journey we have taken with M. le marechal, I\r\nwould rather have died of thirst than accept a glass of water from you.\r\nBut I have come here to-day not upon any private matter, to obtain my\r\nown ends, but upon a matter which concerns the welfare of the State. I\r\ntherefore beg you to put out of your mind the dislike which you have to\r\nme and mine, and I do this the more earnestly that your dislike can only\r\nhave been caused by the fact that our religion is different from yours—a\r\nthing which could neither have been foreseen nor prevented. My entreaty\r\nis that you do not try to set M. le marechal against the course which I\r\nhave proposed to him, which I am convinced would bring the disorders in\r\nour province to an end, stop the occurrence of the many unfortunate\r\nevents which I am sure you look on with regret, and spare you much\r\ntrouble and embarrassment.\"\r\n\r\nThe intendant was much touched by this calm speech, and above all by the\r\nconfidence which M. d’Aygaliers had shown him, and replied that he had\r\nonly offered opposition to the plan of pacification because he believed\r\nit to be impracticable. M. d’Aygaliers then warmly pressed him to try it\r\nbefore rejecting it for ever, and in the end M. de Baville withdrew his\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\n  M. d’Aygaliers hastened to the marechal, who finding himself no longer\r\n     alone in his favourable opinion, made no further delay, but told\r\n     the baron to call together that very day all the people whom he\r\n     thought suitable for the required service, and desired that they\r\n     should be presented to him the next morning before he set out for\r\n     Nimes.\r\n\r\nThe next day, instead of the fifty men whom the marachal had thought\r\ncould be gathered together, d’Aygaliers came to him followed by eighty,\r\nwho were almost all of good and many of noble family. The meeting took\r\nplace, by the wish of the baron, in the courtyard of the episcopal\r\npalace. \"This palace,\" says the baron in his Memoirs, \"which was of\r\ngreat magnificence, surrounded by terraced gardens and superbly\r\nfurnished, was occupied by Monseigneur Michel Poncet de La Riviere. He\r\nwas a man passionately devoted to pleasures of all kinds, especially to\r\nmusic, women, and good cheer. There were always to be found in his house\r\ngood musicians, pretty women, and excellent wines. These latter suited\r\nhim so well that he never left the table without being in a pleasant\r\nhumour, and at such a moment if it came into his head that anyone in his\r\ndiocese was not as good a Christian as himself, he would sit down and\r\nwrite to M. de Baville, urging that the delinquent ought to be sent into\r\nexile. He often did this honour to my late father.\" M. d’Aygaliers goes\r\non to say that \"on seeing such a great number of Huguenots in the court\r\nwho were all declaring that they were better servants of the king than\r\nthe Catholics, he almost fell from his balcony with vexation and\r\nsurprise. This vexation increased when he saw M. de Villars and M. de\r\nBaville, who had apartments in the palace, come down into the court and\r\ntalk to these people. One hope still remained to him: it was that the\r\nmarechal and the intendant had come down to send them away; but this\r\nlast hope was cruelly disappointed when he heard M. de Villars say that\r\nhe accepted their service and expected them to obey d’Aygaliers in all\r\nmatters concerning the service of the king.\"\r\n\r\nBut this was not all that had to be accomplished arms were necessary for\r\nthe Protestants, and though their number was not great, there was a\r\ndifficulty in finding them weapons. The unfortunate Calvinists had been\r\ndisarmed so often that even their table-knives had been carried off, so\r\nit was useless to search their houses for guns and sabres. D’Aygaliers\r\nproposed that they should take the arms of the townspeople, but M. de\r\nVillars considered that it would offend the Catholics to have their arms\r\ntaken from them and given to the Protestants. In the end, however, this\r\nwas the course that had to be adopted: M. de Paratte was ordered to give\r\nfifty muskets and the same number of bayonets to M. d’Aygaliers, who\r\nalso received, as the reward of his long patience, from M. de Villars,\r\nbefore the latter left for Nimes, the following commission:\r\n\r\n\"We, Marechal de Villars, general in the armies of the king, etc., etc.,\r\nhave given permission to M. d’Aygaliers, nobleman and Protestant of the\r\ntown of Uzes, and to fifty men chosen by him, to make war on the\r\nCamisards.\r\n\r\n\"(Signed) \"VILLARS\r\n\r\n\"Given at Uzes, the 4th of May 1704\"\r\n\r\nHardly had M. de Villars set out for Nimes than d’Aygaliers met with\r\nfresh difficulties. The bishop, who could not forget that his episcopal\r\npalace had been turned into barracks for Huguenots, went from house to\r\nhouse threatening those who had promised to countenance d’Aygaliers’\r\nplans, and strictly forbidding the captains of the town troops to\r\ndeliver any weapons to the Protestants. Fortunately, d’Aygaliers had not\r\naccomplished so much without having learned not to draw back when the\r\nroad grew rough, so he also on his side went about confirming the strong\r\nand encouraging the feeble, and called on M. de Paratte to beg him to\r\ncarry out the orders of M. de Villars. De Paratte was happily an old\r\nsoldier, whose one idea was that discipline should be maintained, so\r\nthat he gave the guns and bayonets to d’Aygaliers on the spot, without a\r\nword of objection, and thus enabled the latter to start at five o’clock\r\nnext morning with his little band.\r\n\r\nMeantime de Baville and de Lalande had been reflecting what great\r\ninfluence d’Aygaliers would gain in the province should he succeed in\r\nhis aims, and their jealousy had made them resolve to forestall him in\r\nhis work, by themselves inducing Cavalier to abandon his present course.\r\nThey did not conceal from themselves that this would be difficult, but\r\nas they could command means of corruption which were not within the\r\npower of d’Aygaliers, they did not despair of success.\r\n\r\nThey therefore sent for a countryman called Lacombe, in order to enlist\r\nhim on their side; for Cavalier, when a boy, had been his shepherd for\r\ntwo years, and both had remained friends ever since: this man undertook\r\nto try and bring about a meeting between the two gentlemen and\r\nCavalier—an enterprise which would have been dangerous for anyone else.\r\nHe promised first of all to explain to Cavalier the offers of MM. de\r\nBaville and de Lalande.\r\n\r\nLacombe kept his word: he set off the same day, and two days later\r\nappeared before Cavalier. The first feeling of the young chief was\r\nastonishment, the second pleasure. Lacombe could not have chosen a\r\nbetter moment to speak of peace to his former shepherd.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" says Cavalier in his Memoirs, \"the loss which I had just\r\nsustained at Nages was doubly painful to me because it was irreparable.\r\nI had lost at one blow not only a great number of weapons, all my\r\nammunition, and all my money, but also a body of men, inured to danger\r\nand fatigue, and capable of any undertaking;—besides all this, I had\r\nbeen robbed of my stores—a loss which made itself felt more than all the\r\nothers put together, because as long as the secret of the cavern was\r\nkept, in all our misfortunes we were never without resources; but from\r\nthe moment it got into the possession of our enemies we were quite\r\ndestitute. The country was ravaged, my friends had grown cold, their\r\npurses were empty, a hundred towns had been sacked and burned, the\r\nprisons were full of Protestants, the fields were uncultivated. Added to\r\nall this, the long promised help from England had never arrived, and the\r\nnew marechal had appeared in the province accompanied by fresh troops.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in spite of his desperate position, Cavalier listened to\r\nthe propositions laid before him by Lacombe with cold and haughty front,\r\nand his reply was that he would never lay down arms till the Protestants\r\nhad obtained the right to the free exercise of their religion.\r\n\r\nFirm as was this answer, Lalande did not despair of inducing Cavalier to\r\ncome to terms: he therefore wrote him a letter with his own hand, asking\r\nhim for an interview, and pledging his word that if they came to no\r\nagreement Cavalier should be free to retire without any harm being done\r\nhim; but he added that, if he refused this request, he should regard him\r\nas an enemy to peace, and responsible for all the blood which might be\r\nshed in future.\r\n\r\nThis overture, made with a soldier’s frankness, had a great effect on\r\nCavalier, and in order that neither his friends nor his enemies should\r\nhave the least excuse for blaming him, he resolved to show everyone that\r\nhe was eager to seize the first chance of making peace on advantageous\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nHe therefore replied to Lalande, that he would come to the bridge of\r\nAvene on that very day, the 12th May, at noon, and sent his letter by\r\nCatinat, ordering him to deliver it into the hands of the Catholic\r\ngeneral himself.\r\n\r\nCatinat was worthy of his mission. He was a peasant from Cayla, whose\r\nreal name was Abdias Maurel. He had served under Marshal Catinat in\r\nItaly, the same who had maintained so gallant a struggle against Prince\r\nEugene. When Maurel returned home he could talk of nothing but his\r\nmarshal and his campaigns, so that he soon went among his neighbours by\r\nthe name of \"Catinat.\" He was, as we have seen, Cavalier’s right hand,\r\nwho had placed him in command of his cavalry, and who now entrusted him\r\nwith a still more dangerous post, that of envoy to a man who had often\r\nsaid that he would give 2000 livres to him who would bring him the head\r\nof Cavalier, and 1000 livres each for the heads of his two lieutenants.\r\nCatinat was quite well aware of this offer of Lalande’s, yet he appeared\r\nbefore the general perfectly cool and calm; only, either from a feeling\r\nof propriety or of pride, he was dressed in full uniform.\r\n\r\nThe bold and haughty expression of the man who presented Cavalier’s\r\nletter astonished the general, who asked him his name.\r\n\r\n\"I am Catinat,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"Catinat!\" exclaimed Lalande in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Catinat, commander of the cavalry of Cavalier.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" said Lalande, \"are you the Catinat who massacred so many people\r\nin Beaucaire?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am. I did it, but it was my duty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" exclaimed M. de Lalande, \"you show great hardihood in daring to\r\nappear before me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I came,\" said Catinat proudly, \"trusting to your honour and to the\r\npromise that Brother Cavalier gave me that nothing should happen to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was quite right,\" returned Lalande, taking the letter. Having read\r\nit, he said, \"Go back to Cavalier and assure him that I shall be at the\r\nbridge of Avene at noon, accompanied only by a few officers and thirty\r\ndragoons. I expect to find him there with a similar number of men.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" answered Catinat, \"it is possible that Brother Cavalier may not\r\nwish-to come with so poor a following.\"\r\n\r\n\"If so,\" returned Lalande, \"then tell him that he may bring his whole\r\narmy if he likes, but that I shall not take a single man with me more\r\nthan I have said; as Cavalier has confidence in me, I have confidence in\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nCatinat reported Lalande’s answer to his chief it was of a kind that he\r\nunderstood and liked, so leaving the rest of his troops at Massanes, he\r\nchose sixty men from his infantry, and eight horsemen as escort. On\r\ncoming in sight of the bridge, he saw Lalande approaching from the other\r\nside. He at once ordered his sixty men to halt, went a few steps farther\r\nwith his eight horsemen, and then ordered them in their turn to stop,\r\nand advanced alone towards the bridge. Lalande had acted in the same\r\nmanner with regard to his dragoons and officers, and now dismounting,\r\ncame towards Cavalier.\r\n\r\nThe two met in the middle of the bridge, and saluted with the courtesy\r\nof men who had learned to esteem each other on the field of battle. Then\r\nafter a short silence, during which they examined each other, Lalande\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said he, \"the king in his clemency desires to put an end to the\r\nwar which is going on between his subjects, and which can only result in\r\nthe ruin of his kingdom. As he knows that this war has been instigated\r\nand supported by the enemies of France, he hopes to meet no opposition\r\nto his wishes among those of his subjects who were momentarily led\r\nastray, but to whom he now offers pardon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" answered Cavalier, \"the war not having been begun by the\r\nProtestants, they are always ready for peace—but a real peace, without\r\nrestriction or reserve. They have no right, I know, to lay down\r\nconditions, but I hope they will be permitted to discuss those which may\r\nbe laid down for them. Speak openly, sir, and let me know what the\r\noffers are that you have been authorised to make to us, that I may judge\r\nif we can accept them.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how would it be,\" said Lalande, \"if you were mistaken, and if the\r\nking desired to know what conditions you would consider reasonable?\"\r\n\r\n\"If that is so,\" answered Cavalier, \"I will tell you our conditions at\r\nonce, in order not to prolong the negotiations; for every minute’s\r\ndelay, as you know, costs someone his life or fortune.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then tell me what your conditions are,\" returned Lalande.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Cavalier, \"our demands are three first, liberty of\r\nconscience; secondly, the release of all prisoners who have been\r\ncondemned to imprisonment or the galleys because of their religion; and\r\nthirdly, that if we are not granted liberty of conscience we may be at\r\nleast permitted to leave the kingdom.\"\r\n\r\n\"As far as I can judge,\" replied Lalande, \"I do not believe that the\r\nking will accept the first proposition, but it is possible that he may\r\naccede to the third. In that case, how many Protestants would you take\r\nwith you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ten thousand of all ages and both sexes.\"\r\n\r\n\"The number is excessive, sir. I believe that His Majesty is not\r\ndisposed to go beyond three thousand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" replied Cavalier, \"there is nothing more to be said, for I could\r\nnot accept passports for any smaller number, and I could accept for the\r\nten thousand only on condition that the king would grant us three months\r\nin which to dispose of our possessions and withdraw from the country\r\nwithout being molested. Should His Majesty, however, not be pleased to\r\nallow us to leave the kingdom, then we beg that our edicts be re-enacted\r\nand our privileges restored, whereupon we shall become once more, what\r\nwe were formerly, His Majesty’s loyal and obedient servants.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said Lalande, \"I shall lay your conditions before M. le Marechal,\r\nand if no satisfactory conclusion can be arrived at, it will be to me a\r\nmatter of profound regret. And now, sir, will you permit me to inspect\r\nmore closely the gallant men with whose help you have done such\r\nastounding deeds?\" Cavalier smiled; for these \"gallant men\" when caught\r\nhad been broken on the wheel, burnt at the stake, or hanged like\r\nbrigands. His sole answer was an inclination of the head as he turned\r\nand led the way to his little escort. M. de Lalande followed him with\r\nperfect confidence, and, passing by the eight horsemen who were grouped\r\non the road, he walked up to the infantry, and taking out of his pocket\r\na handful of gold, he scattered it before them, saying:\r\n\r\n\"There, my men! that is to drink the king’s health with.\"\r\n\r\nNot a man stooped to pick the money up, and one of them said, shaking\r\nhis head,\r\n\r\n\"It is not money we want, but liberty of conscience.\"\r\n\r\n\"My men,\" answered Lalande, \"it is unfortunately not in my power to\r\ngrant your demand, but I advise you to submit to the king’s will and\r\ntrust in his clemency.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" answered Cavalier, \"we are all ready to obey him, provided that\r\nhe graciously grant us our just demands; if not, we shall die weapon in\r\nhand, rather than expose ourselves once more to such outrages as have\r\nalready been inflicted on us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your demands shall be transmitted word for word to M. de Villars, who\r\nwill lay them before the king,\" said Lalande, \"and you may be sure, sir,\r\nthat my most sincere wish is that His Majesty may not find them\r\nexorbitant.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, M. de Lalande saluted Cavalier, and turned to rejoin\r\nhis escort; but Cavalier, wishing to return confidence with confidence,\r\ncrossed the bridge with him, and accompanied the general to where his\r\nsoldiers had halted. There, with another salute, the two chiefs parted,\r\nM. de Lalande taking the road to Uzes, while Cavalier rejoined his\r\ncomrades.\r\n\r\nMeantime d’Aygaliers, who, as we have seen, had not left Uzes until the\r\n5th May, in order to join Cavalier, did not come up with him until the\r\n13th, that is to say, the day after his conference with Lalande.\r\nD’Aygaliers gives us an account of their interview, and we cannot do\r\nbetter than quote it.\r\n\r\n\"Although it was the first time that we had met face to face, we\r\nembraced each other as if we were old acquaintances. My little band\r\nmixed with his and sang psalms together, while Cavalier and I talked. I\r\nwas very much pleased with what, he said, and convinced him without\r\ndifficulty that he should submit for the sake of the brethren, who could\r\nthen choose whichever course best suited them, and either leave the\r\nkingdom or serve the king. I said that I believed the last course to be\r\nthe best, provided we were allowed to worship God according to our\r\nconsciences; because I hoped that, seeing their faithful service, His\r\nMajesty would recognise that he had been imposed upon by those who had\r\ndescribed us as disloyal subjects, and that we should thus obtain for\r\nthe whole nation that liberty of conscience which had been granted to\r\nus; that in no other way, as far as I could see, could our deplorable\r\ncondition be ameliorated, for although Cavalier and his men might be\r\nable to exist for some time longer in the forests and mountains, they\r\nwould never be strong enough to save the inhabitants of towns and other\r\nenclosed places from perishing.\r\n\r\n\"Upon this he replied, that although the Catholics seldom kept a promise\r\nmade to those of our religion, he was willing to risk his life for the\r\nwelfare of his brethren and the province but that he trusted if he\r\nconfided in the clemency of the king for whom he had never ceased to\r\npray, no harm would happen him.\"\r\n\r\nThereupon d’Aygaliers, delighted to find him so well inclined, begged\r\nhim to give him a letter for M. de Villars, and as Cavalier knew the\r\nmarechal to be loyal and zealous, and had great confidence in him, he\r\nwrote without any hesitation the following letter:\r\n\r\n\"MONSEIGNEUR,—Permit me to address your Excellency in order to beg\r\nhumbly for the favour of your protection for myself and for my soldiers.\r\nWe are filled with the most ardent desire to repair the fault which we\r\nhave committed by bearing arms, not against the king, as our enemies\r\nhave so falsely asserted, but to defend our lives against those who\r\npersecuted us, attacking us so fiercely that we believed it was done by\r\norder of His Majesty. We know that it was written by St. Paul that\r\nsubjects ought to submit themselves to their king, and if in spite of\r\nthese sincere protestations our sovereign should still demand our blood,\r\nwe shall soon be ready to throw ourselves on his justice or his mercy;\r\nbut we should, Monseigneur, regard ourselves as happy, if His Majesty,\r\nmoved by our repentance, would grant us his pardon and receive us into\r\nhis service, according to the example of the God of mercy whose\r\nrepresentative His Majesty is on earth. We trust, Monseigneur, by our\r\nfaithfulness and zeal to acquire the honour of your protection, and we\r\nglory in the thought of being permitted, under the command of such an\r\nillustrious and noble-minded general as yourself, to shed our blood for\r\nthe king; this being so, I hope that your Excellency will be pleased to\r\nallow me to inscribe myself with profound respect and humility,\r\nMonseigneur, your most humble and obedient servant, \"CAVALIER.\"\r\n\r\nD’Aygaliers, as soon as he got possession of this letter, set out for\r\nNimes in the best of spirits; for he felt sure that he was bringing M.\r\nde Villars more than he had expected. And, indeed, as soon as the\r\nmarechal saw how far things had gone, in spite of everything that\r\nLalande could say, who in his jealousy asserted that d’Aygaliers would\r\nspoil everything, he sent him back to Cavalier with an invitation to\r\ncome to Nimes. D’Aygaliers set out at once, promising to bring the young\r\nchief back with him, at which Lalande laughed loudly, pretending to be\r\nvery much amused at the baron’s confident way of speaking, and\r\nprotesting that Cavalier would not come.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime events were happening in the mountains which might\r\neasily have changed the state of mind of the young chief. The Comte de\r\nTournan, who was in command at Florae, had encountered Roland’s army in\r\nthe plain of Fondmortes, and had lost two hundred men, a considerable\r\nsum of money, and eighty mules loaded with provisions. The anxiety which\r\nthis news caused to M. de Villars was soon relieved; for six days after\r\nthe defeat he received a letter from Cavalier by the hands of Lacombe,\r\nthe same who had brought about the interview on the bridge of Avenes. In\r\nthis letter Cavalier expressed the greatest regret for what had just\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nD’Aygaliers therefore found Cavalier in the best of humours when he\r\njoined him at Tarnac. The first feeling that the young chief felt on\r\nreceiving the invitation was one of stupefaction; for an interview with\r\nthe marechal was an honour so unexpected and so great, that his\r\nimpression was that some treason lay behind it; but he was soon\r\nreassured when he recalled the character for loyalty which the marechal\r\nbore, and how impossible it was that d’Aygaliers should lend himself to\r\ntreachery. So Cavalier sent back word that he would obey the marechal’s\r\norders; and that he put himself entirely into his hands in what\r\nconcerned the arrangements for the interview. M. de Villars let him know\r\nthat he would expect him on the 16th in the garden of the convent of the\r\nRecollets of Nimes, which lay just outside the city, between the gates\r\nof Beaucaire and the Madeleine, and that Lalande would meet him beyond\r\nCarayrac to receive him and to bring him hostages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 15th May Cavalier set out from Tarnac at the head of one hundred\r\nand sixty foot-soldiers and fifty horse; he was accompanied by his young\r\nbrother and by d’Aygaliers and Lacombe. They all passed the night at\r\nLanglade.\r\n\r\nThe next day they set out for Nimes, and, as had been agreed upon, were\r\nmet by Lalande between Saint-Cesaire and Carayrac. Lalande advanced to\r\ngreet Cavalier and present the hostages to him. These hostages were M.\r\nde La Duretiere, captain of the Fimarcon regiment, a captain of\r\ninfantry, several other officers, and ten dragoons. Cavalier passed them\r\nover to his lieutenant, Ravanel, who was in command of the infantry, and\r\nleft them in his charge at Saint-Cesaire. The cavalry accompanied him to\r\nwithin a musket-shot of Nimes, and encamped upon the heights. Besides\r\nthis, Cavalier posted sentinels and mounted orderlies at all the\r\napproaches to the camp, and even as far off as the fountain of Diana and\r\nthe tennis-court. These precautions taken, he entered the city,\r\naccompanied by his brother, d’Aygaliers, Lacombe, and a body-guard of\r\neighteen cavalry, commanded by Catinat. Lalande rode on before to\r\nannounce their arrival to the marechal, whom he found waiting with MM.\r\nde Baville and Sandricourt, in the garden of the Recollets, dreading\r\nevery moment to receive word that Cavalier had refused to come; for he\r\nexpected great results from this interview. Lalande, however, reassured\r\nhim by telling him the young Huguenot was behind.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes a great tumult was heard: it was the people hastening\r\nto welcome their hero. Not a Protestant, except paralytic old people and\r\ninfants in the cradle, remained indoors; for the Huguenots, who had long\r\nlooked on Cavalier as their champion, now considered him their saviour,\r\nso that men and women threw themselves under the feet of his horse in\r\ntheir efforts to kiss the skirts of his coat. It was more like a victor\r\nmaking his entry into a conquered town than a rebel chief coming to beg\r\nfor an amnesty for himself and his adherents. M. de Villars heard the\r\noutcry from the garden of Recollets, and when he learned its cause his\r\nesteem for Cavalier rose higher, for every day since his arrival as\r\ngovernor had showed him more and more clearly how great was the young\r\nchief’s influence. The tumult increased as Cavalier came nearer, and it\r\nflashed through the marechal’s mind that instead of giving hostages he\r\nshould have claimed them. At this moment Cavalier appeared at the gate,\r\nand seeing the marechal’s guard drawn up in line, he caused his own to\r\nform a line opposite them. The memoirs of the time tell us that he was\r\ndressed in a coffee-coloured coat, with a very full white muslin cravat;\r\nhe wore a cross-belt from which depended his sword, and on his head a\r\ngold-laced hat of black felt. He was mounted on a magnificent bay horse,\r\nthe same which he had taken from M. de La Jonquiere on the bloody day of\r\nVergenne.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant of the guard met him at the gate. Cavalier quickly\r\ndismounted, and throwing the bridle of his horse to one of his men, he\r\nentered the garden, and advanced towards the expectant group, which was\r\ncomposed, as we have said, of Villars, Baville, and Sandricourt. As he\r\ndrew near, M. de Villars regarded him with growing astonishment; for he\r\ncould not believe that in the young man, or rather boy, before him he\r\nsaw the terrible Cevenol chief, whose name alone made the bravest\r\nsoldiers tremble. Cavalier at this period had just completed his\r\ntwenty-fourth year, but, thanks to his fair hair which fell in long\r\nlocks over his shoulders, and to the gentle expression of his eyes he\r\ndid not appear more than eighteen. Cavalier was acquainted with none of\r\nthe men in whose presence he stood, but he noticed M. de Villars’ rich\r\ndress and air of command. He therefore saluted him first; afterwards,\r\nturning towards the others, he bowed to each, but less profoundly, then\r\nsomewhat embarrassed and with downcast eyes he stood motionless and\r\nsilent. The marechal still continued to look at him in silent\r\nastonishment, turning from time to time to Baville and Sandricourt, as\r\nif to assure himself that there was no mistake and that it was really\r\nthe man whom they expected who stood before them. At last, doubting\r\nstill, in spite of the signs they made to reassure him, he asked—\r\n\r\n\"Are you really Jean Cavalier?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, monseigneur,\" was the reply, given in an unsteady voice.\r\n\r\n\"But I mean Jean Cavalier, the Camisard general, he who has assumed the\r\ntitle of Duke of the Cevennes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not assumed that title, monseigneur, only some people call me so\r\nin joke: the king alone has the right to confer titles, and I rejoice\r\nexceedingly, monseigneur, that he has given you that of governor of\r\nLanguedoc.\"\r\n\r\n\"When you are speaking of the king, why do you not say ’His Majesty’?\"\r\nsaid M. de Baville. \"Upon my soul, the king is too good to treat thus\r\nwith a rebel.\"\r\n\r\nThe blood rushed to Cavalier’s head, his face flamed, and after a\r\nmoment’s pause, fixing his eye boldly upon M. de Baville, and speaking\r\nin a voice which was now as firm as it had been tremulous a moment\r\nbefore, he said, \"If you have only brought me here, sir, to speak to me\r\nin such a manner, you might better have left me in my mountains, and\r\ncome there yourself to take a lesson in hospitality. If I am a rebel, it\r\nis not I who am answerable, for it was the tyranny and cruelty of M. de\r\nBaville which forced us to have recourse to arms; and if history takes\r\nexception to anything connected with the great monarch for whose pardon\r\nI sue to-day, it will be, I hope, not that he had foes like me, but\r\nfriends like him.\"\r\n\r\n  M. de Baville grew pale with anger; for whether Cavalier knew to whom\r\n     he was speaking or not, his words had the effect of a violent blow\r\n     full in his face; but before he could reply M. de Villars\r\n     interposed.\r\n\r\n\"Your business is only with me, sir,\" he said; \"attend to me alone, I\r\nbeg: I speak in the name of the king; and the king, of his clemency,\r\nwishes to spare his subjects by treating them with tenderness.\"\r\n\r\nCavalier opened his mouth to reply, but the intendant cut him short.\r\n\r\n\"I should hope that that suffices,\" he said contemptuously: \"as pardon\r\nis more than you could have hoped for, I suppose you are not going to\r\ninsist on the other conditions you laid down?\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is precisely those other conditions,\" said Cavalier, addressing\r\nhimself to M. de Villars, and not seeming to see that anyone else was\r\npresent, \"for which we have fought. If I were alone, sir, I should give\r\nmyself up, bound hand and foot, with entire confidence in your good\r\nfaith, demanding no assurances and exacting no conditions; but I stand\r\nhere to defend the interests of my brethren and friends who trust me;\r\nand what is more, things have gone so far that we must either die weapon\r\nin hand, or obtain our rights.\"\r\n\r\nThe intendant was about to speak, but the marechal stopped him with such\r\nan imperative gesture that he stepped back as if to show that he washed\r\nhis hands of the whole matter.\r\n\r\n\"What are those rights? Are they those which M. Lalande has transmitted\r\nto me by word of mouth?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be well to commit them to writing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have done so, monseigneur, and sent a copy to M. d’Aygaliers.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not seen it, sir; make me another copy and place it in my hands,\r\nI beg.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall go and set about it directly, monseigneur,\" stepping back as if\r\nabout to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\"One moment!\" said the marechal, detaining him by a smile. \"Is it true\r\nthat you are willing to enter the king’s army?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am more than willing, I desire it with all my heart,\" exclaimed\r\nCavalier, with the frank enthusiasm natural to his age, \"but I cannot do\r\nso till our just demands are granted.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if they were granted—?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, sir,\" replied Cavalier, \"the king has never had more loyal\r\nsubjects than we shall be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, have a little patience and everything will be arranged, I hope.\"\r\n\r\n\"May God grant it!\" said Cavalier. \"He is my witness that we desire\r\npeace beyond everything.\" And he took another step backwards.\r\n\r\n\"You will not go too far away, I hope,\" said the marechal.\r\n\r\n\"We shall remain wherever your excellency may appoint,\" said Cavalier.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" continued M. de Villars; \"halt at Calvisson, and try all\r\nyou can to induce the other leaders to follow your example.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall do my best, monseigneur; but while we await His Majesty’s reply\r\nshall we be allowed to fulfil our religious duties unimpeded?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I shall give orders that you are to have full liberty in that\r\nrespect.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, monseigneur.\"\r\n\r\nCavalier bowed once more, and was about to go; but M. de Villars\r\naccompanied him and Lalande, who had now joined them, and who stood with\r\nhis hand on Cavalier’s shoulder, a few steps farther. Catinat seeing\r\nthat the conference was at an end, entered the garden with his men.\r\nThereupon M. de Villars took leave, saying distinctly, \"Adieu, Seigneur\r\nCavalier,\" and withdrew, leaving the young chief surrounded by a dozen\r\npersons all wanting to speak to him at once. For half an hour he was\r\ndetained by questions, to all of which he replied pleasantly. On one\r\nfinger was an emerald taken from a naval officer named Didier, whom he\r\nhad killed with his own hand in the action at Devois de Martignargues;\r\nhe kept time by a superb watch which had belonged to M. d’Acqueville,\r\nthe second in command of the marines; and he offered his questioners\r\nfrom time to time perfumed snuff from a magnificent snuffbox, which he\r\nhad found in the holsters when he took possession of M. de La\r\nJonquiere’s horse. He told everyone who wished to listen that he had\r\nnever intended to revolt against the king; and that he was now ready to\r\nshed the last drop of his blood in his service; that he had several\r\ntimes offered to surrender on condition that liberty of conscience was\r\ngranted to those of the new faith, but that M. de Montrevel had always\r\nrejected his offers, so that he had been obliged to remain under arms,\r\nin order to deliver those who were in prison, and to gain permission for\r\nthose who were free to worship God in their own way.\r\n\r\nHe said these things in an unembarrassed and graceful manner, hat in\r\nhand; then passing through the crowd which had gathered outside the\r\ngarden of the Recollets, he repaired to the Hotel de la Poste for lunch,\r\nand afterwards walked along the Esplanade to the house of one Guy\r\nBillard, a gardener, who was his head prophet’s father. As he thus moved\r\nabout he was preceded by two Camisards with drawn swords, who made way\r\nfor him; and several ladies were presented to him who were happy to\r\ntouch his doublet. The visit over, he once again passed along the\r\nEsplanade, still preceded by his two Camisards, and just as he passed\r\nthe Little Convent he and those with him struck up a psalm tune, and\r\ncontinued singing till they reached Saint-Cesaire, where the hostages\r\nwere. These he at once sent back.\r\n\r\nFive hundred persons from Nimes were awaiting him; refreshments were\r\noffered to him, which he accepted gratefully, thanking all those who had\r\ngathered together to meet him. At last he went off to St. Denoise, where\r\nhe was to sup and sleep; but before going to bed he offered up\r\nsupplications in a loud voice for the king, for M. de Villars, for M. de\r\nLalande, and even for M. de Baville.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, Cavalier, according to promise, sent a copy of his\r\ndemands to M. de Villars, who caused it to be laid before the king,\r\nalong with a full report of all that had passed at the interview at\r\nNimes. As soon as the young chief had sent off his missive, he rejoined\r\nhis troops at Tarnac, and related all that had passed to Roland, urging\r\nhim to follow his example. That night he slept at Sauves, having passed\r\nthrough Durfort at the head of his men; a captain of dragoons named\r\nMontgros, with twenty-five soldiers, accompanying him everywhere, by M.\r\nde Villars’ orders, and seeing that the villages through which they\r\npassed furnished him with all that was needed. They left Sauves on May\r\n16th very early in the morning, in order to get to Calvisson, which, as\r\nour readers may remember, was the place appointed for the residence of\r\nCavalier during the truce. In passing through Quissac, where they\r\nstopped for refreshments, they were joined by Castanet who delivered a\r\nlong sermon, at which all the Protestants of the neighbourhood were\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThe two battalions of the Charolais regiment which were quartered at\r\nCalvisson had received orders on the evening of the 17th to march out\r\nnext morning, so as to make room for the Camisards.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th the head of the commissary department, Vincel, ordered\r\nsuitable accommodation to be provided for Cavalier and his troops; the\r\nmuster roll being in the hands of M. d’Aygaliers, it would be sent by\r\nhim or brought in the course of the day. In the meantime, vans were\r\narriving filled with all sorts of provisions, followed by droves of\r\ncattle, while a commissary and several clerks, charged with the\r\ndistribution of rations, brought up the rear.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th, Catinat, accompanied by twelve Camisards, rode into the\r\ntown, and was met at the barrier by the commandant and eighty\r\ntownspeople. As soon as the little band came in sight the commandant\r\nreiterated his orders that nothing should be said or done in the town,\r\non pain of corporal punishment, that could offend the Camisards.\r\n\r\nAt one o’clock P. M. Baron d’Aygaliers arrived, followed in his turn by\r\nthe chief of the commissariat, Vincel, by Captain Cappon, two other\r\nofficers named Viala and Despuech, and six dragoons. These were the\r\nhostages Cavalier had given.\r\n\r\nAt six o’clock there was heard a great noise; and shouts of \"Cavalier!\r\nCavalier!\" resounded on all sides. The young Cevenol was in sight, and\r\nthe whole population hastened to meet him. He rode at the head of his\r\ncavalry, the infantry following, and the whole number—about six hundred\r\nmen—sang psalms in a loud voice.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the church, Cavalier drew up before it with all his\r\nmen in review order, and for some time the singing went on. When it\r\nstopped, a long prayer was offered up, which was most edifying to all\r\nthe bystanders; and this being over, Cavalier went to the quarters\r\nassigned him, which were in the best house in Calvisson. Arrived there,\r\nhe sent out for a dozen loaves that he might judge how his men were\r\ngoing to be fed; not finding them white enough, he complained to M.\r\nVincel, whom he sent for, and who promised that in future the bread\r\nshould be of a better quality. Having received this assurance, Cavalier\r\ngave orders that the loaves in hand should be distributed for that day,\r\nbut probably fearing poison, he first made M. de Vincel and his clerks\r\ntaste them in his presence. These duties accomplished, he visited in\r\nperson all the gates of the town, placed guards and posted sentinels at\r\nall the entrances and along all the avenues, the most advanced being\r\nthree-quarters of a league from the town. Besides this, he placed guards\r\nin the streets, and a sentinel at each door of the house he occupied; in\r\naddition, thirty guards always slept outside the door of his bedroom,\r\nand these accompanied him as an escort when he went out; not that he was\r\nafraid, for he was not of a mistrustful character, but that he thought\r\nit politic to give people an exalted idea of his importance. As to his\r\nsoldiers, they were billeted on the inhabitants, and received each as\r\ndaily rations a pound of meat, a quart of wine, and two and a half\r\npounds of bread.\r\n\r\nThe same day a convocation was held on the site of the old meeting-house\r\nwhich had been destroyed by the Catholics. It was a very numerous\r\nassembly, to which crowds of people came from all parts; but on the\r\nfollowing days it was still more numerous; for, as the news spread,\r\npeople ran with great eagerness to hear the preaching of the word of\r\nwhich they had been so long deprived. D’Aygaliers tells us in his\r\nMemoirs that—\"No one could help being touched to see a whole people just\r\nescaped from fire and sword, coming together in multitudes to mingle\r\ntheir tears and sighs. So famished were they for the manna divine, that\r\nthey were like people coming out of a besieged city, after a long and\r\ncruel famine, to whom peace has brought food in abundance, and who,\r\nfirst devouring it with their eyes, then throw themselves on it,\r\ndevouring it bodily—meat, bread, and fruit—as it comes to hand. So it\r\nwas with the unfortunate inhabitants of La Vannage, and even of places\r\nmore distant still. They saw their brethren assembling in the meadows\r\nand at the gates of Calvisson, gathering in crowds and pressing round\r\nanyone who started singing a psalm, until at last four or five thousand\r\npersons, singing, weeping, and praying, were gathered together, and\r\nremained there all day, supplicating God with a devotion that went to\r\nevery heart and made a deep impression. All night the same things went\r\non; nothing was to be heard but preaching, singing, praying, and\r\nprophesying.\"\r\n\r\nBut if it was a time of joy for the Protestants, it was a time of\r\nhumiliation for the Catholics. \"Certainly,\" says a contemporary\r\nhistorian, \"it was a very surprising thing, and quite a novelty, to see\r\nin a province like Languedoc, where so many troops were quartered, such\r\na large number of villains—all murderers, incendiaries, and guilty of\r\nsacrilege—gathered together in one place by permission of those in\r\ncommand of the troops; tolerated in their eccentricities, fed at the\r\npublic expense, flattered by everyone, and courteously, received by\r\npeople sent specially to meet them.\"\r\n\r\nOne of those who was most indignant at this state of things was M. de\r\nBaville. He was so eager to put an end to it that he went to see the\r\ngovernor, and told him the scandal was becoming too great in his\r\nopinion: the assemblies ought to be put an end to by allowing the troops\r\nto fall upon them and disperse them; but the governor thought quite\r\notherwise, and told Baville that to act according to his advice would be\r\nto set fire to the province again and to scatter for ever people whom\r\nthey had got together with such difficulty. In any case, he reminded\r\nBaville that what he objected to would be over in a few days. His\r\nopinion was that de Baville might stifle the expression of his\r\ndissatisfaction for a little, to bring about a great good. \"More than\r\nthat,\" added the marechal, \"the impatience of the priests is most\r\nridiculous. Besides your remonstrances, of which I hope I have now heard\r\nthe last, I have received numberless letters full of such complaints\r\nthat it would seem as if the prayers of the Camisards not only grated on\r\nthe ears of the clergy but flayed them alive. I should like above\r\neverything to find out the writers of these letters, in order to have\r\nthem flogged; but they have taken good care to put no signatures. I\r\nregard it as a very great impertinence for those who caused these\r\ndisturbances to grumble and express their disapproval at my efforts to\r\nbring them to an end.\" After this speech, M. de Baville saw there was\r\nnothing for him to do but to let things take their course.\r\n\r\nThe course that they took turned Cavalier’s head more and more; for\r\nthanks to the injunctions of M. de Villars, all the orders that Cavalier\r\ngave were obeyed as if they had been issued by the governor himself. He\r\nhad a court like a prince, lieutenants like a general, and secretaries\r\nlike a statesman. It was the duty of one secretary to give leave of\r\nabsence to those Camisards who had business to attend to or who desired\r\nto visit their relations. The following is a copy of the form used for\r\nthese passports:\r\n\r\n\"We, the undersigned, secretary to Brother Cavalier, generalissimo of\r\nthe Huguenots, permit by this order given by him to absent himself on\r\nbusiness for three days.\r\n\r\n\"(Signed) DUPONT.\r\n\r\n\"Calvisson, this——\"\r\n\r\nAnd these safe-conducts were as much respected as if they had been\r\nsigned \"Marechal de Villars.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd M. de Saint-Pierre arrived from the court, bringing the\r\nreply of the king to the proposals which Cavalier had submitted to M. de\r\nLalande. What this reply was did not transpire; probably it was not in\r\nharmony with the pacific intentions of the marechal. At last, on the\r\n25th, the answer to the demands which Cavalier had made to M. de Villars\r\nhimself arrived. The original paper written by the Camisard chief\r\nhimself had been sent to Louis XIV, and he returned it with notes in his\r\nown writing; thus these two hands, to one of which belonged the\r\nshepherd’s crook and to the other the sceptre, had rested on the same\r\nsheet of paper. The following is the text of the agreement as given by\r\nCavalier in his Memoirs:\r\n\r\n    \"THE HUMBLE PETITION OF THE REFORMERS OF\r\n      LANGUEDOC TO THE KING\r\n\r\n\"1. That it may please the king to grant us liberty of conscience\r\nthroughout the province, and to permit us to hold religious meetings in\r\nevery suitable place, except fortified places and walled cities.\r\n\r\n’Granted, on condition that no churches be built.\r\n\r\n\"2. That all those in prison or at the galleys who have been sent there\r\nsince the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, because of their religion,\r\nbe set at liberty within six weeks from the date of this petition.\r\n\r\n’Granted.\r\n\r\n\"3. That all those who have left the kingdom because of their religion\r\nbe allowed to return in freedom and safety, and that their goods and\r\nprivileges be restored to them.\r\n\r\n’Granted on condition that they take the oath of fidelity to the king.\r\n\r\n\"4. That the Parliament of Languedoc be reestablished on its ancient\r\nfooting, and with all its former privileges.\r\n\r\n’The king reserves decision on this point.\r\n\r\n\"5. That the province of Languedoc be exempted from the poll tax for ten\r\nyears, this to apply, to Catholics and Protestants alike, both sides\r\nhaving equally suffered.\r\n\r\n’Refused.\r\n\r\n\"6. That the cities of Perpignan, Montpellier, Cette, and Aiguemortes be\r\nassigned us as cities of refuge.\r\n\r\n’Refused.\r\n\r\n\"7. That the inhabitants of the Cevennes whose houses were burnt or\r\notherwise destroyed during the war be exempt from taxes for seven years.\r\n\r\n’Granted.\r\n\r\n\"8. That it may please His Majesty to permit Cavalier to choose 2000\r\nmen, both from among his own troops and from among those who may be\r\ndelivered from the prisons and galleys, to form a regiment of dragoons\r\nfor the service of His Majesty, and that this regiment when formed may\r\nat once be ordered to serve His Majesty in Portugal.\r\n\r\n’Granted: and on condition that all the Huguenots everywhere lay down\r\ntheir arms, the king will permit them to live quietly in the free\r\nexercise of their religion.’\"\r\n\r\n\"I had been a week at Calvisson,\" says Cavalier in his Memoirs, \"when I\r\nreceived a letter from M. le Marechal de Villars ordering me to repair\r\nto Nimes, as he wished to see me, the answer to my demands having\r\narrived. I obeyed at once, and was very much displeased to find that\r\nseveral of my demands, and in particular the one relating to the cities\r\nof refuge, had been refused; but M. le marechal assured me that the\r\nking’s word was better than twenty cities of refuge, and that after all\r\nthe trouble we had given him we should regard it as showing great\r\nclemency on his part that he had granted us the greater part of what we\r\nhad asked. This reasoning was not entirely convincing, but as there was\r\nno more time for deliberation, and as I was as anxious for peace as the\r\nking himself, I decided to accept gracefully what was offered.\"\r\n\r\nAll the further advantage that Cavalier could obtain from M. de Villars\r\nwas that the treaty should bear the date of the day on which it had been\r\ndrawn up; in this manner the prisoners who were to be set at liberty in\r\nsix weeks gained one week.\r\n\r\n  M. de Villars wrote at the bottom of the treaty, which was signed the\r\n     same day by him and M. de Baville on the part of the king, and by\r\n     Cavalier and Daniel Billard on the part of the Protestants, the\r\n     following ratification:\r\n\r\n\"In virtue of the plenary powers which we have received from the king,\r\nwe have granted to the Reformers of Languedoc the articles above made\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n\"MARECHAL DE VILLARS J. CAVALIER \"LAMOIGNON DE BAVILLE DANIEL BILLARD\r\n\r\n\"Given at Nimes, the 17th of May 1704\"\r\n\r\nThese two signatures, all unworthy as they were to stand beside their\r\nown, gave such great delight to MM. de Villars and de Baville, that they\r\nat once sent off fresh orders to Calvisson that the wants of the\r\nCamisards should be abundantly supplied until the articles of the treaty\r\nwere executed—that is to say, until the prisoners and the galley slaves\r\nwere set at liberty, which, according to article 2 of the treaty, would\r\nbe within the next six weeks. As to Cavalier, the marechal gave him on\r\nthe spot a commission as colonel, with a pension of 1200 livres\r\nattached, and the power of nominating the subordinate officers in his\r\nregiment, and at the same time he handed him a captain’s commission for\r\nhis young brother.\r\n\r\nCavalier drew up the muster-roll of the regiment the same day, and gave\r\nit to the marechal. It was to consist of seven hundred and twelve men,\r\nforming fifteen companies, with sixteen captains, sixteen lieutenants, a\r\nsergeant-major, and a surgeon-major.\r\n\r\nWhile all this was happening, Roland, taking advantage of the suspension\r\nof hostilities, was riding up and down the province as if he were\r\nviceroy of the Cevennes, and wherever he appeared he had a magnificent\r\nreception. Like Cavalier, he gave leave of absence and furnished\r\nescorts, and held himself haughtily, sure that he too would soon be\r\nnegotiating treaties on terms of equality with marshals of France and\r\ngovernors of provinces. But Roland was much mistaken: M. de Villars had\r\nmade great concessions to the popularity of Cavalier, but they were the\r\nlast he intended to make. So, instead of being in his turn summoned to\r\nNimes, or Uzes, to confer with M. de Villars, Roland merely received an\r\nintimation from Cavalier that he desired to speak with him on important\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nThey met near Anduze, and Cavalier, faithful to the promise given to M.\r\nde Villars, neglected no argument that he could think of to induce\r\nRoland to follow his example; but Roland would listen to nothing. Then,\r\nwhen Cavalier saw that arguments and promises were of no avail, he\r\nraised his voice in anger; but Roland, laying his hand on his shoulder,\r\ntold him that his head was turned, that he should remember that he,\r\nRoland, was his senior in command, and therefore bound by nothing that\r\nhad been promised in his name by his junior, and that he had registered\r\na vow in Heaven that nothing would persuade him to make peace unless\r\ncomplete liberty of conscience were granted to all. The young Cevenol,\r\nwho was unaccustomed to such language, laid his hand on the hilt of his\r\nsword, Roland, stepping back, drew his, and the consultation would have\r\nended in a duel if the prophets had not thrown themselves between them,\r\nand succeeded in getting Roland to consent to one of their number, a man\r\nmuch esteemed among the Huguenots, named Salomon, going back to Nimes\r\nwith Cavalier to learn from M. de Villars’ own mouth what the exact\r\nterms were which Cavalier had accepted and now offered to Roland.\r\n\r\nIn a couple of hours Cavalier and Salomon set out together, and arrived\r\nat Nimes on the 27th May, escorted by twenty-five men; they halted at\r\nthe tower of Magne, and the Protestants of the city came out to meet\r\nthem, bringing refreshments; then, after prayers and a hasty meal, they\r\nadvanced to the barracks and crossed the courtyards. The concourse of\r\npeople and the enthusiasm was no whit less than on Cavalier’s first\r\nentry, more than three hundred persons kissing his hands and knees.\r\nCavalier was dressed on this occasion in a doublet of grey cloth, and a\r\nbeaver hat, laced with gold, and adorned with a white feather.\r\n\r\nCavalier and his travelling-companion went direct to the garden of the\r\nRecollets, and hardly had they got there than MM. de Villars and de\r\nBaville, accompanied by Lalande and Sandricourt, came out to meet them:\r\nthe conference lasted three hours, but all that could be learned of the\r\nresult was that Salomon had declared that his brethren would never lay\r\ndown their arms till full liberty of conscience had been secured to\r\nthem. In consequence of this declaration, it was decided that Cavalier\r\nand his regiment should be despatched to Spain without delay, in order\r\nto weaken the Calvinist forces to that extent; meantime Salomon was sent\r\nback to Roland with a positive promise that if he would surrender, as\r\nCavalier had done, he would be granted the same conditions—that is to\r\nsay, receive a commission as colonel, have the right to name the\r\nofficers of his regiment, and receive a pension of 1200 livres. On\r\nquitting the garden of the Recollets, Cavalier found as great a crowd as\r\never waiting for him, and so closely did they press on him that two of\r\nhis men were obliged to ride before him with drawn sabres to clear a way\r\nfor him till the Montpellier road was reached. He lay that night at\r\nLanglade, in order to rejoin his troops early next morning.\r\n\r\nBut during his absence things had happened among these men, who had\r\nhitherto obeyed him blindly, which he little expected. He had left, as\r\nusual, Ravanel in command; but hardly had he ridden away when Ravanel\r\nbegan to take all kinds of precautions, ordering the men not to lay\r\naside their arms. The negotiations with M. de Villars had made him most\r\nanxious; he looked upon all the promises given as snares, and he\r\nregarded the compromise favoured by his chief as a defection on\r\nCavalier’s part. He therefore called all the officers and men together,\r\ntold them of his fears, and ended by imbuing them with his suspicions.\r\nThis was all the more easily done, as it was very well known that\r\nCavalier had joined the Huguenots less from devotion to the cause than\r\nto avenge a private wrong, and on many occasions had given rise to the\r\nremark that he had more genius than religion.\r\n\r\nSo, on getting back to Calvisson, the young chief found his principal\r\nofficers, Ravanel at their head, drawn up in the market-place, waiting\r\nfor him. As soon as he drew near they told him that they were determined\r\nto know at once what were the conditions of the treaty he had signed\r\nwith the marechal; they had made up their minds to have a plain answer\r\nwithout delay. Such a way of speaking to him was so strange and\r\nunexpected, that Cavalier shrugged his shoulders and replied that such\r\nmatters were no business of theirs, being too high for their\r\nintelligence; that it was his business to decide what course to take and\r\ntheirs to take it; it had always been so in the past, and with the help\r\nof God and his own, Cavalier’s, goodwill, it should still be so in\r\nfuture; and having so spoken, he told them to disperse. Ravanel upon\r\nthis came forward, and in the name of all the others said they would not\r\ngo away until they knew what orders Cavalier was about to give the\r\ntroops, that they might consult among themselves whether they should\r\nobey them or not. This insubordination was too much for Cavalier’s\r\npatience.\r\n\r\n\"The orders are,\" he said, \"to put on the uniforms that are being made\r\nfor you, and to follow me to Portugal.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of such words on men who were expecting nothing less than the\r\nre-enactment of the Edict of Nantes, can be easily imagined; the words\r\n\"coward\" and \"traitor\" could be distinguished above the murmurs, as\r\nCavalier noticed with increasing astonishment. Raising himself in his\r\nstirrups, and glancing round with that look before which they had been\r\nused to tremble, he asked in a voice as calm as if all the demons of\r\nanger were not raging in his heart, \"Who called Jean Cavalier traitor\r\nand coward?\"\r\n\r\n\"I,\" said Ravanel, crossing his arms on his breast.\r\n\r\nCavalier drew a pistol from his holsters, and striking those near him\r\nwith the butt end, opened a way towards his lieutenant, who drew his\r\nsword; but at this moment the commissary-general, Vincel, and Captain\r\nCappon threw themselves between the two and asked the cause of the\r\nquarrel.\r\n\r\n\"The cause,\" said Ravanel, \"is that the Cadets of the Cross, led by the\r\n’Hermit,’ have just knocked out the brains of two of our brethren, who\r\nwere coming to join us, and are hindering others from attending our\r\nmeetings to worship God: the conditions of the truce having been thus\r\nbroken, is it likely they will keep those of the treaty? We refuse to\r\naccept the treaty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said Vincel, \"if the ’Hermit’ has done what you say, it is\r\nagainst the orders of the marachal, and the misdoer will be punished;\r\nbesides, the large number of strangers at present in Calvisson ought to\r\nbe sufficient proof that no attempt has been made to prevent the new\r\nconverts from coming to the town, and it seems to me that you have been\r\ntoo easily led to believe everything that malicious people have told\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe what I choose to believe,\" said Ravanel impatiently; \"but\r\nwhat I know and say is, that I shall never lay down arms till the king\r\ngrants us full liberty of conscience, permission to rebuild our places\r\nof worship, and sends us back all prisoners and exiles.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, judging by your tone,\" said Cavalier, who had till now remained\r\nsilent while toying with his pistol, \"you seem to be in command here;\r\nhave we changed, parts without my being aware?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is possible,\" said Ravanel.\r\n\r\nCavalier burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to astonish you,\" said Ravanel, \"but it is true. Make peace\r\nfor yourself, lay down what conditions suit you, sell yourself for\r\nwhatever you will bring; my only reply is, You are a coward and a\r\ntraitor. But as to the troops, they will not lay down arms except on the\r\nconditions formulated by me.\"\r\n\r\nCavalier tried to get at Ravanel, but seeing from his paleness and his\r\nsmile that terrible things would happen if he reached his lieutenant,\r\nVincel and Cappon, backed by some Camisards, threw themselves before his\r\nhorse. Just then the whole band shouted with one voice, \"No peace! no\r\npeace! no reconciliation till our temples are restored!\" Cavalier then\r\nsaw for the first time that things were more serious than he had\r\nbelieved, but Vincel, Cappon, Berlie, and about twenty Camisards\r\nsurrounded the young chief and forced him to enter a house; it was the\r\nhouse of Vincel.\r\n\r\nThey had hardly got indoors when the ’generale’ was sounded: resisting\r\nall entreaties, Cavalier sprang to the door, but was detained by Berlie,\r\nwho said that the first thing he ought to do was to write M. de Villars\r\nan account of what had happened, who would then take measures to put\r\nthings straight.\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" said Cavalier; \"as I have so many enemies, the general\r\nmight be told if I were killed that I had broken my word. Give me pen\r\nand ink.\"\r\n\r\nWriting materials were brought, and he wrote to M. de Villars.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" he said, giving the letter unsealed to Vincel, \"set out for\r\nNimes and give this to the marechal, and tell him, if I am killed in the\r\nattempt I am about to make, I died his humble servant.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, he darted out of the house and mounted his horse,\r\nbeing met at the door by twelve to fifteen men who had remained faithful\r\nto him. He asked them where Ravanel and his troops were, not seeing a\r\nsingle Camisard in the streets; one of the soldiers answered that they\r\nwere probably still in town, but that they were moving towards Les\r\nGarrigues de Calvisson. Cavalier set off at a gallop to overtake them.\r\n\r\nIn crossing the market-place he met Catinat, walking between two\r\nprophets, one called Moses and the other Daniel Guy; Catinat was just\r\nback from a visit to the mountains, so that he had taken no part in the\r\nscene of insubordination that had so lately been enacted.\r\n\r\nCavalier felt a ray of hope; he was sure he could depend on Catinat as\r\non himself. He hurried to greet him, holding out his hand; but Catinat\r\ndrew back his.\r\n\r\n\"What does this mean?\" cried Cavalier, the blood mounting to his\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\n\"It means,\" answered Catinat, \"that you are a traitor, and I cannot give\r\nmy hand to a traitor.\"\r\n\r\nCavalier gave a cry of rage, and advancing on Catinat, raised his cane\r\nto strike him; but Moses and Daniel Guy threw themselves between, so\r\nthat the blow aimed at Catinat fell on Moses. At the same moment\r\nCatinat, seeing Cavalier’s gesture, drew a pistol from his belt. As it\r\nwas at full cock, it went off in his hand, a bullet piercing Guy’s hat,\r\nwithout, however, wounding him.\r\n\r\nAt the noise of the report shouts were heard about a hundred yards away.\r\nIt was the Camisards, who had been on the point of leaving the town, but\r\nhearing the shot had turned back, believing that some of their brethren\r\nwere being murdered. On seeing them appear, Cavalier forgot Catinat, and\r\nrode straight towards them. As soon as they caught sight of him they\r\nhalted, and Ravanel advanced before them ready for every danger.\r\n\r\n\"Brethren,\" he cried, \"the traitor has come once more to tempt us.\r\nBegone, Judas! You have no business here.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I have,\" exclaimed Cavalier. \"I have to punish a scoundrel called\r\nRavanel, if he has courage to follow me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come on, then,\" cried Ravanel, darting down a small side-street, \"and\r\nlet us have done with it.\" The Camisards made a motion as if to follow\r\nthem, but Ravanel turning towards them ordered them to remain where they\r\nwere.\r\n\r\nThey obeyed, and thus Cavalier could see that, insubordinate as they had\r\nbeen towards him, they were ready to obey another.\r\n\r\nJust at the moment as he turned into the narrow street where the dispute\r\nwas to be settled once for all, Moses and Guy came up, and seizing the\r\nbridle of his horse stopped him, while the Camisards who were on the\r\nside of Cavalier surrounded Ravanel and forced him to return to his\r\nsoldiers. The troops struck up a psalm, and resumed their march, while\r\nCavalier was held back by force.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, the young Cevenol succeeded in breaking away from\r\nthose who surrounded him, and as the street by which the Camisards had\r\nretired was blocked, he dashed down another. The two prophets suspecting\r\nhis intention, hurried after the troops by the most direct route, and\r\ngot up with them, just as Cavalier, who had made the circuit of the\r\ntown, came galloping across the plain to intercept their passage. The\r\ntroops halted, and Ravanel gave orders to fire. The first rank raised\r\ntheir muskets and took aim, thus indicating that they were ready to\r\nobey. But it was not a danger of this kind that could frighten Cavalier;\r\nhe continued to advance. Then Moses seeing his peril, threw himself\r\nbetween the Camisards and him, stretching out his arms and shouting,\r\n\"Stop! stop! misguided men! Are you going to kill Brother Cavalier like\r\na highwayman and thief? You must pardon him, my brethren! you must\r\npardon him! If he has done wrong in the past, he will do better in\r\nfuture.\"\r\n\r\nThen those who had taken aim at Cavalier grounded their muskets, and\r\nCavalier changing menace for entreaty, begged them not to break the\r\npromise that he had made in their name; whereupon the prophets struck up\r\na psalm, and the rest of the soldiers joining in, his voice was\r\ncompletely drowned. Nevertheless, Cavalier did not lose heart, but\r\naccompanied them on their march to Saint-Esteve, about a league farther\r\non, unable to relinquish all hope. On reaching Saint-Esteve the singing\r\nceased for a moment, and he made another attempt to recall them to\r\nobedience. Seeing, however, that it was all in vain, he gave up hope,\r\nand calling out, \"At least defend yourselves as well as you can, for the\r\ndragoons will soon be on you,\" he set his horse’s head towards the town.\r\nThen turning to them for the last time, he said, \"Brethren, let those\r\nwho love me follow me!\" He pronounced these words in tones so full of\r\ngrief and affection that many were shaken in their resolution; but\r\nRavanel and Moses seeing the effect he had produced, began to shout,\r\n\"The sword of the Lord!\" Immediately all the troops turned their back on\r\nCavalier except about forty men who had joined him on his first\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nCavalier went into a house near by, and wrote another letter to M. de\r\nVillars, in which he told him what had just taken place, the efforts he\r\nhad made to win back his troops, and the conditions they demanded. He\r\nended by assuring him that he would make still further efforts, and\r\npromised the marechal that he would keep him informed of everything that\r\nwent on. He then withdrew to Cardet, not venturing to return to\r\nCalvisson.\r\n\r\nBoth Cavalier’s letters reached M. de Villars at the same time; in the\r\nfirst impulse of anger aroused by this unexpected check, he issued the\r\nfollowing order:\r\n\r\n\"Since coming to this province and taking over the government by order\r\nof the king, our sole thought has been how to put an end to the\r\ndisorders we found existing here by gentle measures, and to restore\r\npeace and to preserve the property of those who had taken no part in the\r\ndisturbances. To that end we obtained His Majesty’s pardon for those\r\nrebels who had, by the persuasion of their chiefs, been induced to lay\r\ndown their arms; the only condition exacted being that they should throw\r\nthemselves on the king’s clemency and beg his permission to expiate\r\ntheir crime by adventuring their lives in his service. But, being\r\ninformed that instead of keeping the engagements they had made by\r\nsigning petitions, by writing letters, and by speaking words expressing\r\ntheir intentions, some among them have been trying to delude the minds\r\nof the people with false hopes of full liberty for the exercise of this\r\nso-called Reformed religion, which there has never been any intention of\r\ngranting, but which we have always declared as clearly as we could, to\r\nbe contrary to the will of the king and likely to bring about great\r\nevils for which it would be difficult to find a remedy, it becomes\r\nnecessary to prevent those who give belief to these falsehoods from\r\nexpecting to escape from well-deserved chastisement. We therefore\r\ndeclare hereby that all religious assemblies are expressly forbidden\r\nunder the penalties proclaimed in the edicts and ordinances of His\r\nMajesty, and that these will be more strictly enforced in the future\r\nthan in the past.\r\n\r\n\"Furthermore, we order all the troops under our command to break up such\r\nassemblies by force, as having been always illegal, and we desire to\r\nimpress on the new converts of this province that they are to give their\r\nobedience where it is due, and we forbid them to give any credence to\r\nthe false reports which the enemies of their repose are spreading\r\nabroad. If they let themselves be led astray, they will soon find\r\nthemselves involved in troubles and misfortunes, such as the loss of\r\ntheir lands, the ruin of their families, and the desolation of their\r\ncountry; and we shall take care that the true authors of these\r\nmisfortunes shall receive punishment proportioned to their crime.\r\n\r\n\"MARECHAL DE VILLARS\r\n\r\n\"Given at Nimes the 27th day of May 1704\"\r\n\r\nThis order, which put everything back upon the footing on which it had\r\nbeen in the time of M. de Montrevel, had hardly been issued than\r\nd’Aygaliers, in despair at seeing the result of so much labour destroyed\r\nin one day, set off for the mountains to try and find Cavalier. He found\r\nhim at Cardet, whither, as we have said, he had retired after the day of\r\nCalvisson. Despite the resolution which Cavalier had taken never to show\r\nhis face again to the marechal, the baron repeated to him so many times\r\nthat M. de Villars was thoroughly convinced that what had happened had\r\nnot been his fault, he having done everything that he could to prevent\r\nit, that the young chief began to feel his self-confidence and courage\r\nreturning, and hearing that the marachal had expressed himself as very\r\nmuch pleased with his conduct, to which Vincel had borne high testimony,\r\nmade up his mind to return to Nimes. They left Cardet at once, followed\r\nby the forty men who had remained true to Cavalier, ten on horse and\r\nthirty on foot, and arrived on the 31st May at Saint-Genies, whither M.\r\nde Villars had come to meet them.\r\n\r\nThe assurances of d’Aygaliers were justified. The marechal received\r\nCavalier as if he were still the chief of a powerful party and able to\r\nnegotiate with him on terms of equality. At Cavalier’s request, in order\r\nto prove to him that he stood as high in his good opinion as ever, the\r\nmarechal returned once more to gentle methods, and mitigated the\r\nseverity of his first proclamation by a second, granting an extension of\r\nthe amnesty:\r\n\r\n\"The principal chiefs of the rebels, with the greater number of their\r\nfollowers, having surrendered, and having received the king’s pardon, we\r\ndeclare that we give to all those who have taken up arms until next\r\nThursday, the 5th instant inclusive, the opportunity of receiving the\r\nlike pardon, by surrendering to us at Anduze, or to M. le Marquis de\r\nLalande at Alais, or to M. de Menon at Saint Hippolyte, or to the\r\ncommandants of Uzes, Nimes, and Lunel. But the fifth day passed, we\r\nshall lay a heavy hand on all rebels, pillaging and burning all the\r\nplaces which have given them refuge, provisions, or help of any kind;\r\nand that they may not plead ignorance of this proclamation, we order it\r\nto be publicly read and posted up in every suitable place.\r\n\r\n\"MARECHAL DE VILLARS\r\n\r\n\"At Saint-Genies, the 1st June 1704\"\r\n\r\nThe next day, in order to leave no doubt as to his good intentions, the\r\nmarechal had the gibbets and scaffolds taken down, which until then had\r\nbeen permanent erections.\r\n\r\nAt the same time all the Huguenots were ordered to make a last effort to\r\ninduce the Camisard chiefs to accept the conditions offered them by M.\r\nde Villars. The towns of Alais, Anduze, Saint-Jean, Sauve,\r\nSaint-Hippolyte, and Lasalle, and the parishes of Cros, Saint-Roman,\r\nManoblet, Saint-Felix, Lacadiere, Cesas, Cambo, Colognac, and Vabre were\r\nordered to send deputies to Durfort to confer as to the best means of\r\nbringing about that peace which everyone desired. These deputies wrote\r\nat once to M. de Villars to beg him to send them M. d’Aygaliers, and to\r\nM. d’Aygaliers to request him to come.\r\n\r\nBoth consented to do as they were asked, and M. d’Aygaliers arrived at\r\nDurfort on the 3rd of June 1704.\r\n\r\nThe deputies having first thanked him for the trouble which he had taken\r\nto serve the common cause during the past year, resolved to divide their\r\nassembly into two parts, one of which, was to remain permanently\r\nsitting, while the other went to seek Roland and Ravanel to try and\r\nobtain a cessation of hostilities. The deputies charged with this task\r\nwere ordered to make it quite clear to the two chiefs that if they did\r\nnot accept the proposals made by M. de Villars, the Protestants in\r\ngeneral would take up arms and hunt them down, and would cease to supply\r\nthem with the means of subsistence.\r\n\r\nOn hearing this, Roland made reply that the deputies were to go back at\r\nonce to those who sent them, and threatened, should they ever show him\r\ntheir faces again, to fire on them.\r\n\r\nThis answer put an end to the assembly, the deputies dispersed, and\r\nd’Aygaliers returned to the Marechal de Villars to make his report.\r\n\r\nHardly had he done this when a letter from Roland arrived, in which the\r\nCamisard chief asked M. de Villars to grant him an interview, such as he\r\nhad granted to Cavalier. This letter was addressed to d’Aygaliers, who\r\nimmediately communicated its contents to the marechal, from whom he\r\nreceived orders to set out at once to find Roland and to spare no pains\r\nto bring him round.\r\n\r\nD’Aygaliers, who was always indefatigable when working for his country,\r\nstarted the same day, and went to a mountain about three-quarters of a\r\nleague from Anduze, where Roland awaited him. After a conference of two\r\nhours, it was agreed that hostages should be exchanged and negotiations\r\nentered upon.\r\n\r\nConsequently, M. de Villars on his side sent Roland M. de Montrevel, an\r\nofficer commanding a battalion of marines, and M. de la Maison-Blanche,\r\ncaptain of the Froulay regiment; while Roland in return sent M. de\r\nVillars four of his principal officers with the title of\r\nplenipotentiaries.\r\n\r\nUnskilled in diplomacy as these envoys were, and laughable as they\r\nappeared to contemporary historians, they received nevertheless the\r\nmarechal’s consent to the following conditions:\r\n\r\n  1. That Cavalier and Roland should each be placed in charge of a\r\n     regiment serving abroad, and that each of them should be allowed a\r\n     minister.\r\n  2. That all the prisoners should be released and the exiles recalled.\r\n  3. That the Protestants should be permitted to leave the kingdom,\r\n     taking their effects with them.\r\n  4. That those Camisards who desired to remain might do so, on giving\r\n     up their arms.\r\n  5. That those who were abroad might return.\r\n  6. That no one should be molested on account of his religion provided\r\n     everyone remained quietly at home.\r\n  7. That indemnities should be borne by the whole province, and not\r\n     exacted specially from the Protestants.\r\n  8. That a general amnesty should be granted to all without reserve.\r\n\r\nThese articles were laid before Roland and Ravanel by d’Aygaliers.\r\nCavalier, who from the day he went back to Nimes had remained in the\r\ngovernor’s suite, asked leave to return with the baron, and was\r\npermitted to do so. D’Aygaliers and he set out together in consequence\r\nfor Anduze, and met Roland and Ravanel about a quarter of a league from\r\nthe town, waiting to know the result of the negotiations. They were\r\naccompanied by MM. de Montbel and de Maison-Blanche, the Catholic\r\nhostages.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Cavalier and Roland met they burst out into recriminations\r\nand reproaches, but through the efforts of d’Aygaliers they soon became\r\nmore friendly, and even embraced on parting.\r\n\r\nBut Ravanel was made of harder stuff: as soon as he caught sight of\r\nCavalier he called him \"traitor,\" saying that for his part he would\r\nnever surrender till the Edict of Nantes was re-enacted; then, having\r\nwarned them that the governor’s promises were not to be trusted, and\r\nhaving predicted that a day would come when they would regret their too\r\ngreat confidence in him, he left the conference and rejoined his troops,\r\nwhich, with those of Roland, were drawn up on a mountain about\r\nthree-quarters of a league distant.\r\n\r\nThe negotiators did not, however, despair. Ravanel had gone away, but\r\nRoland had debated with them at some length, so they determined to speak\r\nto \"the brethren\"—that is, to the troops under Roland and Ravanel, whose\r\nheadquarters at the moment were at Leuzies, in order that they might\r\nknow exactly what articles had been agreed on between Roland’s envoys\r\nand the marechal. Those who made up their minds to take this step were,\r\nCavalier, Roland, Moise, Saint-Paul, Laforet, Maille, and d’Aygaliers.\r\nWe take the following account of what happened in consequence of this\r\ndecision from d’Aygaliers’ Memoirs:\r\n\r\n\"We had no sooner determined on this plan, than, anxious to carry it\r\nout, we set off. We followed a narrow mountain path on the face of the\r\ncliff which rose up to our right; to our left flowed the Gardon.\r\n\r\n\"Having gone about a league, we came in sight of the troops, about 3000\r\nstrong; an advanced post barred our way.\r\n\r\n\"Thinking it was placed there in our honour, I was advancing\r\nunsuspiciously, when suddenly we found our road cut off by Camisards to\r\nright and left, who threw themselves on Roland and forced him in among\r\ntheir troops. Maille and Malplach were dragged from their horses. As to\r\nCavalier, who was somewhat behind, as soon as he saw people coming\r\ntowards him with uplifted sabres and shouting Traitor! he put spurs to\r\nhis horse and went off at full gallop, followed by some townspeople from\r\nAnduze who had come with us, and who, now that they saw the reception we\r\nmet with, were ready to die with fear.\r\n\r\n\"I was too far forward to escape: five or six muskets rested on my\r\nbreast and a pistol pressed each ear; so I made up my mind to be bold. I\r\ntold the troopers to fire; I was willing to die in the service of my\r\nprince, my country, and my religion, as well as for themselves, whom I\r\nwas trying to benefit by procuring them the king’s goodwill.\r\n\r\n\"These words, which I repeated several times in the midst of the\r\ngreatest uproar, gave them pause.\r\n\r\n\"They commanded me to retire, as they did not want to kill me. I said I\r\nshould do nothing of the kind: I was going into the middle of the troops\r\nto defend Roland against the charge of treason, or be put to death\r\nmyself, unless I could convince them that what I had proposed to him and\r\nCavalier was for the good of the country, of our religion, and the\r\nbrethren; and having thus expostulated at the top of my voice against\r\nthirty voices all trying to drown mine for about an hour, I offered to\r\nfight the man who had induced them to oppose us.\r\n\r\n\"At this offer they pointed their muskets at me once more; but Maille,\r\nMalplach, and some others threw themselves before me, and although they\r\nwere unarmed, had enough influence to hinder my being insulted; I was\r\nforced, however, to retreat.\r\n\r\n\"In leaving, I warned them that they were about to bring great\r\nmisfortunes on the province, whereupon a man named Claris stepped out\r\nfrom among the troops, and approaching me exclaimed, ’Go on, sir, and\r\nGod bless you! We know that you mean well, and were the first to be\r\ntaken in. But go on working for the good of the country, and God will\r\nbless you.’\"\r\n\r\nD’Aygaliers returned to the marechal, who, furious at the turn things\r\nhad taken, resolved instantly to break off all negotiations and have\r\nrecourse once more to measures of severity. However, before actually\r\ncarrying out this determination, he wrote the following letter to the\r\nking:\r\n\r\n\"SIRE,—It is always my glory to execute faithfully your Majesty’s\r\norders, whatever those orders may be; but I should have been able, on\r\nmany occasions since coming here, to display my zeal for your Majesty’s\r\nservice in other ways if I had not had to deal with madmen on whom no\r\ndependence could be placed. As soon as we were ready to attack them,\r\nthey offered to submit, but a little later changed their minds again.\r\nNothing could be a greater proof of madness than their hesitation to\r\naccept a pardon of which they were unworthy, and which was so generously\r\noffered by your Majesty. If they do not soon make up their minds, I\r\nshall bring them back to the paths of duty by force, and thus restore\r\nthis province to that state of peace which has been disturbed by these\r\nfools.\"\r\n\r\nThe day after writing this letter to the king, Roland sent Maille to M.\r\nde Villars to beg him to wait till Saturday and Sunday the 7th and the\r\n8th June were over, before resorting to severity, that being the end of\r\nthe truce. He gave him a solemn promise that he would, in the interval,\r\neither bring in his troops to the last man, or would himself surrender\r\nalong with a hundred and fifty followers. The marechal consented to wait\r\ntill Saturday morning, but as soon as Saturday arrived he gave orders to\r\nattack the Camisards, and the next day led a considerable body of troops\r\nto Carnoulet, intending to take the Huguenots by surprise, as word had\r\nbeen brought that they were all gathered there. They, however, received\r\nintelligence of his plan, and evacuated the village during the night.\r\n\r\nThe village had to pay dearly for its sin of hospitality; it was\r\npillaged and burnt down: the miquelets even murdered two women whom they\r\nfound there, and d’Aygaliers failed to obtain any satisfaction for this\r\ncrime. In this manner M. de Villars kept the fatal promise he had given,\r\nand internecine war raged once more.\r\n\r\nFurious at having missed the Camisards, de Menon having heard from his\r\nscouts that Roland was to sleep next night at the chateau de Prade, went\r\nto M. de Villars and asked leave to conduct an expedition against the\r\nchief. He was almost sure of taking Roland by surprise, having procured\r\na guide whose knowledge of the country was minute. The marechal gave him\r\ncarte blanche. In the evening Menon set out with two hundred grenadiers.\r\nHe had already put three-quarters of the way behind him without being\r\ndiscovered, when an Englishman met them by chance. This man was serving\r\nunder Roland, but had been visiting his sweetheart in a neighbouring\r\nvillage, and was on his way home when he fell among Menon’s grenadiers.\r\nWithout a thought for his own safety, he fired off his gun, shouting,\r\n\"Fly! fly! The royals are upon you!\"\r\n\r\nThe sentinels took up the cry, Roland jumped out of bed, and, without\r\nstaying for clothes or horse, ran off in his shirt, escaping by a\r\npostern gate which opened on the forest just as de Menon entered by\r\nanother. He found Roland’s bed still warm, and took possession of his\r\nclothes, finding in a coat pocket a purse containing thirty-five Louis,\r\nand in the stables three superb horses. The Camisards answered this\r\nbeginning of hostilities by a murder. Four of them, thinking they had\r\nreasons for displeasure against one of M. de Baville’s subordinates,\r\nnamed Daude, who was both mayor and magistrate; at Le Vigan, hid in a\r\ncorn-field which he had to pass on his way back from La Valette, his\r\ncountry place. Their measures were successful: Daude came along just as\r\nwas expected, and as he had not the slightest suspicion of the impending\r\ndanger, he continued conversing with M. de Mondardier, a gentleman of\r\nthe neighbourhood who had asked for the; hand of Daude’s daughter in\r\nmarriage that very day. Suddenly he found himself surrounded by four\r\nmen, who, upbraiding him for his exactions and cruelties, shot him twice\r\nthrough the head with a pistol. They offered no violence to M. de\r\nMondardier except to deprive him of his laced hat and sword. The day on\r\nwhich M. de Villars heard of its murder he set a price on the heads of\r\nRoland, Ravanel, and Catinat. Still the example set by Cavalier, joined\r\nto the resumption of hostilities, was not without influence on the\r\nCamisards; every day letters arrived from single troopers offering to\r\nlay down their arms, and in one day thirty rebels came in and put\r\nthemselves into Lalande’s hands, while twenty surrendered to Grandval;\r\nthese were accorded not only pardon, but received a reward, in hopes\r\nthat they might be able to induce others to do like them; and on the\r\n15th June eight of the troops which had abandoned Cavalier at Calvisson\r\nmade submission; while twelve others asked to be allowed to return to\r\ntheir old chief to follow him wherever he went. This request was at once\r\ngranted: they were sent to Valabregues, where they found forty-two of\r\ntheir old comrades, amongst whom were Duplan and Cavalier’s young\r\nbrother, who had been ordered there a few days before. As they arrived\r\nthey were given quarters in the barracks, and received good pay—the\r\nchiefs forty sous a day, and the privates ten. So they felt as happy as\r\npossible, being well fed and well lodged, and spent their time\r\npreaching, praying, and psalm-singing, in season and out of season. All\r\nthis, says La Baume, was so disagreeable to the inhabitants of the\r\nplace, who were Catholics, that if they had not been guarded by the\r\nking’s soldiers they would have been pitched into the Rhone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nMeantime the date of Cavalier’s departure drew near. A town was to be\r\nnamed in which he was to reside at a sufficient distance from the\r\ntheatre of war to prevent the rebels from depending on him any more; in\r\nthis town he was to organise his regiment, and as soon as it was\r\ncomplete it was to go, under his command, to Spain, and fight for the\r\nking. M. de Villars was still on the same friendly terms with him,\r\ntreating him, not like a rebel, but according to his new rank in the\r\nFrench army. On the 21st June he told him that he was to get ready to\r\nleave the next day, and at the same time he handed him an advance on\r\ntheir future pay—fifty Louis for himself, thirty for Daniel Billard, who\r\nhad been made lieutenant-colonel in the place of Ravanel, ten for each\r\ncaptain, five for each lieutenant, two for each sergeant, and one for\r\neach private. The number of his followers had then reached one hundred\r\nand fifty, only sixty of whom were armed. M. de Vassiniac, major in the\r\nFimarcn regiment, accompanied them with fifty dragoons and fifty of the\r\nrank and file from Hainault.\r\n\r\nAll along the road Cavalier and his men met with a courteous reception;\r\nat Macon they found orders awaiting them to halt. Cavalier at once wrote\r\nto M. de Chamillard to tell him that he had things of importance to\r\ncommunicate to him, and the minister sent a courier of the Cabinet\r\ncalled Lavallee to bring Cavalier to Versailles. This message more than\r\nfulfilled all Cavalier’s hopes: he knew that he had been greatly talked\r\nabout at court, and in spite of his natural modesty the reception he had\r\nmet with at Nimes had given him new ideas, if not of his own merit, at\r\nleast of his own importance. Besides, he felt that his services to the\r\nking deserved some recognition.\r\n\r\nThe way in which Cavalier was received by Chamillard did not disturb\r\nthese golden dreams: the minister welcomed the young colonel like a man\r\nwhose worth he appreciated, and told him that the great lords and ladies\r\nof the court were not less favourably disposed towards him. The next day\r\nChamillard announced to Cavalier that the king desired to see him, and\r\nthat he was to keep himself prepared for a summons to court. Two days\r\nlater, Cavalier received a letter from the minister telling him to be at\r\nthe palace at four o’clock in the afternoon, and he would place him on\r\nthe grand staircase, up which the king would pass.\r\n\r\nCavalier put on his handsomest clothes, for the first time in his life\r\nperhaps taking trouble with his toilet. He had fine features, to which\r\nhis extreme youth, his long fair hair, and the gentle expression of his\r\neyes lent much charm. Two years of warfare had given him a martial air;\r\nin short, even among the most elegant, he might pass as a beau cavalier.\r\n\r\nAt three o’clock he reached Versailles, and found Chamillard waiting for\r\nhim; all the courtiers of every rank were in a state of great\r\nexcitement, for they had learned that the great Louis had expressed a\r\nwish to meet the late Cevenol chief, whose name had been pronounced so\r\nloud and so often in the mountains of Languedoc that its echoes had\r\nresounded in the halls of Versailles. Cavalier had not been mistaken in\r\nthinking that everyone was curious to see him, only as no one yet knew\r\nin what light the king regarded him, the courtiers dared not accost him\r\nfor fear of compromising their dignity; the manner of his reception by\r\nHis Majesty would regulate the warmth of his reception by everyone else.\r\n\r\nMet thus by looks of curiosity and affected silence, the young colonel\r\nfelt some embarrassment, and this increased when Chamillard, who had\r\naccompanied him to his appointed place, left him to rejoin the king.\r\nHowever, in a few moments he did what embarrassed people so often do,\r\nhid his shyness under an air of disdain, and, leaning on the balustrade,\r\ncrossed his legs and played with the feather of his hat.\r\n\r\nWhen half an hour had passed in this manner, a great commotion was\r\nheard: Cavalier turned in the direction from which it came, and\r\nperceived the king just entering the vestibule. It was the first time he\r\nhad seen him, but he recognized him at once. Cavalier’s knees knocked\r\ntogether and his face flushed.\r\n\r\nThe king mounted the stairs step by step with his usual dignity,\r\nstopping from time to time to say a word or make a sign with head or\r\nhand. Behind him, two steps lower, came Chamillard, moving and stopping\r\nas the king moved and stopped, and answering the questions which His\r\nMajesty put to him in a respectful but formal and precise manner.\r\n\r\nReaching the level on which Cavalier stood, the king stopped under\r\npretext of pointing out to Chamillard a new ceiling which Le Brun had\r\njust finished, but really to have a good look at the singular man who\r\nhad maintained a struggle against two marshals of France and treated\r\nwith a third on equal terms. When he had examined him quite at his ease,\r\nhe turned to Chamillard, pretending he had only just caught sight of the\r\nstranger, and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Who is this young gentleman?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" answered the minister, stepping forward to present him to the\r\nking, \"this is Colonel Jean Cavalier.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah yes,\" said the king contemptuously, \"the former baker of Anduze!\"\r\n\r\nAnd shrugging his shoulders disdainfully, he passed on.\r\n\r\nCavalier on his side had, like Chamillard, taken a step forward, when\r\nthe scornful answer of the great king changed him into a statue. For an\r\ninstant he stood motionless and pale as death, then instinctively he\r\nlaid his hand on his sword, but becoming conscious that he was lost if\r\nhe remained an instant longer among these people, whom not one of his\r\nmotions escaped, although they pretended to despise him too much to be\r\naware of his presence, he dashed down the staircase and through the\r\nhall, upsetting two or three footmen who were in his way, hurried into\r\nthe garden, ran across it at full speed, and regaining his room at the\r\nhotel, threw himself on the floor, where he rolled like a maniac,\r\nuttering cries of rage, and cursing the hour when, trusting to the\r\npromises of M. de Villars, he had abandoned the mountains where he was\r\nas much a king as Louis XIV at Versailles. The same evening he received\r\norders to leave Paris and rejoin his regiment at Macon. He therefore set\r\nout the next morning, without seeing M. de Chamillard again.\r\n\r\nCavalier on arriving at Macon found that his comrades had had a visit\r\nfrom M. d’Aygaliers, who had come again to Paris, in the hope of\r\nobtaining more from the king than M. de Villars could or would grant.\r\n\r\nCavalier, without telling his comrades of the strange manner in which\r\nthe king had received him, gave them to understand that he was beginning\r\nto fear that not only would the promises they had received be broken,\r\nbut that some strange trick would be played upon them.\r\n\r\nThereupon these men, whose chief and oracle he had been for so long,\r\nasked him what they ought to do; Cavalier replied that if they would\r\nfollow him, their best course and his would be to take the first\r\nopportunity of gaining the frontier and leaving the country. They all\r\ndeclared themselves ready to follow him anywhere. This caused Cavalier a\r\nnew pang of regret, for he could not help recollecting that he had once\r\nhad under his command fifteen hundred men like these.\r\n\r\nThe next day Cavalier and his comrades set out on their march without\r\nknowing whither they were being taken, not having been able to obtain\r\nany information as to their destination from their escort—a silence\r\nwhich confirmed them in their resolution. As soon, therefore, as they\r\nreached Onnan, Cavalier declared that he considered that the looked-for\r\nopportunity had arrived, asking them if they were still in the same\r\nmind: they returned that they would do whatever he advised. Cavalier\r\nthen ordered them to hold themselves in readiness, Daniel offered up a\r\nprayer, and the prayer ended, the whole company deserted in a body, and,\r\ncrossing Mont Belliard, entered Porentruy, and took the road to\r\nLausanne.\r\n\r\nMeantime d’Aygaliers, in his turn, arrived at Versailles, with letters\r\nfrom M. de Villars for the Duke of Beauvilliers, president of the king’s\r\ncouncil, and for Chamillard. The evening of his arrival he delivered\r\nthese letters to those to whom they were addressed, and both gentlemen\r\npromised to present him to the king.\r\n\r\nFour days later, Chamillard sent word to d’Aygaliers that he was to be\r\nnext day at the door of the king’s chamber at the time when the council\r\nentered. D’Aygaliers was punctual, the king appeared at the usual hour,\r\nand as he paused before d’Aygaliers, Chamillard came forward and said:\r\n\r\n\"Baron d’Aygaliers, sire.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very glad to see you, sir,\" said the king, \"for I am very much\r\npleased with the zeal you have displayed in Languedoc in my service—very\r\nmuch pleased indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" answered d’Aygaliers, \"I consider myself most unfortunate in\r\nthat I have been able to accomplish nothing deserving of the gracious\r\nwords which your Majesty deigns to address me, and I pray God of His\r\ngrace to grant me in the future an opportunity of proving my zeal and\r\nloyalty in your Majesty’s service more clearly than hitherto.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, never mind,\" said the king. \"I repeat, sir, that I am very\r\nmuch pleased with what you have done.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he entered the room where the council was waiting.\r\n\r\nD’Aygaliers went away only half satisfied: he had not come so far only\r\nto receive commendation from the king, but in the hope of obtaining some\r\nconcession for his brethren; but with Louis XIV it was impossible either\r\nto intercede or complain, one could only wait.\r\n\r\nThe same evening Chamillard sent for the baron, and told him that as\r\nMarechal Villars had mentioned in his letter that the Camisards had\r\ngreat confidence in him, d’Aygaliers, he wished to ask him if he were\r\nwilling to go once more to them and try and bring them back to the path\r\nof duty.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly I am willing; but I fear things have now got so far that\r\nthere will be great difficulty in calming the general perturbation of\r\nmind.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what can these people want?\" asked Chamillard, as if he had just\r\nheard them spoken of for the first time, \"and by what means can we\r\npacify them?\"\r\n\r\n\"In my opinion,\" said the baron, \"the king should allow to all his\r\nsubjects the free exercise of their religion.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! legalise once more the exercise of the so-called Reformed\r\nreligion!\" exclaimed the minister. \"Be sure you never mention such a\r\nthing again. The king would rather see his kingdom destroyed than\r\nconsent to such a measure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monseigneur,\" replied the baron, \"if that is the case, then I must say\r\nwith great regret that I know of no other way to calm the discontent\r\nwhich will ultimately result in the ruin of one of the fairest provinces\r\nin France.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that is unheard-of obstinacy,\" said the minister, lost in\r\nastonishment; \"these people will destroy themselves, and drag their\r\ncountry down with them. If they cannot conform to our religion, why do\r\nthey not worship God in their own way at home? No one will disturb them\r\nas long as they don’t insist on public worship.\"\r\n\r\n\"At first that was all they wanted, monseigneur; and I am convinced that\r\nif people had not been dragged to confession and communion by force, it\r\nwould have been easy to keep them in that submissive frame of mind from\r\nwhich they were only driven by despair; but at present they say that it\r\nis not enough to pray at home, they want to be married, to have their\r\nchildren baptised and instructed, and to die and be buried according to\r\nthe ordinances of their own faith.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where may you have seen anyone who was ever made to communicate by\r\nforce?\" asked Chamillard.\r\n\r\nD’Aygaliers looked at the minister in surprise, thinking he spoke in\r\njoke; but seeing he was quite serious, he answered:\r\n\r\n\"Alas, monseigneur, my late father and my mother, who is still living,\r\nare both instances of people subjected to this indignity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you, then, not a Catholic?\" asked Chamillard.\r\n\r\n\"No, monseigneur,\" replied d’Aygaliers.\r\n\r\n\"Then how did you manage to return to France?\"\r\n\r\n\"To speak the truth, sir, I only came back to help my mother to escape;\r\nbut she never could make up her mind to leave France, as such a step was\r\nsurrounded by many difficulties which she feared she could never\r\nsurmount. So she asked my other relations to persuade me to remain. I\r\nyielded to their importunities on condition that they would never\r\ninterfere with my beliefs. To accomplish this end they got a priest with\r\nwhom they were intimate to say that I had changed my views once more,\r\nand I did not contradict the report. It was a great sin on my part, and\r\nI deeply repent it. I must add, however, that whenever anyone has asked\r\nme the question your Excellency asked me just now I have always given\r\nthe same reply.\"\r\n\r\nThe minister did not seem to take the baron’s frankness in bad part;\r\nonly he remarked, when dismissing him, that he hoped he would find out\r\nsome way of ridding the kingdom of those who refused to think in\r\nreligious matters as His Majesty commanded.\r\n\r\nD’Aygaliers replied that it was a problem to which he had given much\r\nthought, but without ever being able to find a solution, but that he\r\nwould think about it more earnestly in future. He then withdrew.\r\n\r\nSome days later, Chamillard sent word to d’Aygaliers that the king would\r\ngraciously give him a farewell audience. The baron relates what took\r\nplace at this second interview, as follows.\r\n\r\n\"His Majesty,\" says he, \"received me in the council chamber, and was so\r\ngood as to repeat once more in the presence of all his ministers that he\r\nwas very much pleased with my services, but that there was one thing\r\nabout me he should like to correct. I begged His Majesty to tell me what\r\nthe fault was, and I should try to get rid of it at, the peril of my\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\"’It is your religion,’ said the king. ’I should like to have you become\r\na good Catholic, so that I might be able to grant you favours and enable\r\nyou to serve me better.’ His Majesty added that I ought to seek\r\ninstruction, and that then I should one day recognise what a great\r\nbenefit he desired to bring within my reach.\r\n\r\n\"I answered that I would esteem myself happy if at the cost of my life I\r\ncould prove the burning zeal with which I was filled for the service of\r\nthe greatest of earthly kings, but that I should be unworthy of the\r\nleast of his favours if I obtained it by hypocrisy or by anything of\r\nwhich my conscience did not approve, but that I was grateful for the\r\ngoodness which made him anxious for my salvation. I told him also that I\r\nhad already taken every opportunity of receiving instruction, and had\r\ntried to put aside the prejudices arising from my birth, such as often\r\nhindered people from recognising the truth, with the result that I had\r\nat one time almost lost all sense of religion, until God, taking pity on\r\nme, had opened my eyes and brought me out of that deplorable condition,\r\nmaking me see that the faith in which I had been born was the only one\r\nfor me. ’And I can assure your Majesty,’ I added, ’that many of the\r\nLanguedoc bishops who ought, it seems to me, to try to make us\r\nCatholics, are the instruments which Providence uses to prevent us from\r\nbecoming so. For instead of attracting us by gentleness and good\r\nexample, they ceaselessly subject us to all kinds of persecutions, as if\r\nto convince us that God is punishing us for our cowardice in giving up a\r\nreligion which we know to be good, by delivering us up to pastors who,\r\nfar from labouring to assure our salvation, use all their efforts to\r\ndrive us to despair.\"\r\n\r\n\"At this the king shrugged his shoulders and said, ’Enough, do not say\r\nany more.’ I asked for his blessing as the king and father of all his\r\nsubjects. The king burst out laughing, and told me that M. de Chamillard\r\nwould give me his orders.\"\r\n\r\nIn virtue of this intimation d’Aygaliers went next day to the minister’s\r\ncountry house; for Chamillard had given him that address, and there he\r\nlearned that the king had granted him a pension of 800 livres. The baron\r\nremarked that, not having worked for money, he had hoped for a better\r\nreward; as far as money was concerned, he desired only the reimbursement\r\nof the actual expenses of his journeys to and from, but Chamillard\r\nanswered that the king expected all that he offered and whatever he\r\noffered to be accepted with gratitude. To this there was no possible\r\nreply, so the same evening d’Aygaliers set out on his return to\r\nLanguedoc.\r\n\r\nThree months later, Chamillard forwarded him an order to leave the\r\nkingdom, telling him that he was to receive a pension of four hundred\r\ncrowns per annum, and enclosing the first quarter in advance.\r\n\r\nAs there was no means of evading this command, D’Aygaliers set out for\r\nGeneva, accompanied by thirty-three followers, arriving there on the\r\n23rd of September. Once rid of him, Louis the Magnificent thought that\r\nhe had done his part nobly and that he owed him nothing further, so that\r\nd’Aygaliers waited a whole year in vain for the second quarter of his\r\npension.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this time, as his letters to Chamillard remained\r\nunanswered, and finding himself without resources in a foreign country,\r\nhe believed himself justified in returning to France and taking up his\r\nresidence on his family estate. Unfortunately, on his way through Lyons,\r\nthe provost of merchants, hearing of his return, had him arrested, and\r\nsent word to the king, who ordered him to be taken to the chateau de\r\nLoches. After a year’s imprisonment, d’Aygaliers, who had just entered\r\non his thirty-fifth year, resolved to try and escape, preferring to die\r\nin the attempt rather than remain a prisoner for life. He succeeded in\r\ngetting possession of a file with which he removed one of the bars of\r\nhis window, and by means of knotting his sheets together, he got down,\r\ntaking the loosened bar with him to serve, in case of need, as a weapon.\r\nA sentinel who was near cried, \"Who goes there?\" but d’Aygaliers stunned\r\nhim with his bar. The cry, however, had given the alarm: a second\r\nsentinel saw a man flying, fired at him, and killed him on the spot.\r\n\r\nSuch was the reward of the devoted patriotism of Baron d’Aygaliers!\r\n\r\nMeantime Roland’s troops had increased greatly in number, having been\r\njoined by the main body of those who had once been commanded by\r\nCavalier, so that he had, about eight hundred men at his disposal. Some\r\ndistance away, another chief, named Joanny, had four hundred; Larose, to\r\nwhom Castanet had transferred his command, found himself at the head of\r\nthree hundred; Boizeau de Rochegude was followed by one hundred, Saltet\r\nde Soustel by two hundred, Louis Coste by fifty, and Catinat by forty,\r\nso that, in spite of the victory of Montrevel and the negotiations of M.\r\nde Villars, the Camisards still formed an effective force of eighteen\r\nhundred and ninety men, not to speak of many single troopers who owned\r\nno commander but acted each for himself, and were none the less\r\nmischievous for that. All these troops, except these latter, obeyed\r\nRoland, who since the defection of Cavalier had been recognised as\r\ngeneralissimo of the forces. M. de Villars thought if he could separate\r\nRoland from his troops as he had separated Cavalier, his plans would be\r\nmore easy to carry out.\r\n\r\nSo he made use of every means within his reach to gain over Roland, and\r\nas soon as one plan failed he tried another. At one moment he was almost\r\nsure of obtaining his object by the help of a certain Jourdan de Mianet,\r\na great friend of his, who offered his services as an intermediary, but\r\nwho failed like all the others, receiving from Roland a positive\r\nrefusal, so that it became evident that resort must be had to other\r\nmeans than those of persuasion. A sum of 100 Louis had already been set\r\non Roland’s head: this sum was now doubled.\r\n\r\nThree days afterwards, a young man from Uzes, by name Malarte, in whom\r\nRoland had every confidence, wrote to M. de Paratte that the Camisard\r\ngeneral intended to pass the night of the 14th of August at the chateau\r\nCastelnau.\r\n\r\nDe Paratte immediately made his dispositions, and ordered Lacoste-Badie,\r\nat the head of two companies of dragoons, and all the officers at Uzes\r\nwho were well mounted, to hold themselves in readiness to start on an\r\nexpedition at eight o’clock in the evening, but not revealing its object\r\nto them till the time came. At eight o’clock, having been told what they\r\nhad to do, they set off at such a pace that they came in sight of the\r\nchateau within an hour, and were obliged to halt and conceal themselves,\r\nlest they should appear too soon, before Roland had retired for the\r\nnight. But they need not have been afraid; the Camisard chief, who was\r\naccustomed to rely on all his men as on himself, had gone to bed without\r\nany suspicion, having full confidence in the vigilance of one of his\r\nofficers, named Grimaud, who had stationed himself as sentinel on the\r\nroof of the chateau. Led by Malarte, Lacoste-Badie and his dragoons took\r\na narrow covered way, which led them to the foot of the walls, so that\r\nwhen Grimaud saw them it was already too late, the chateau being\r\nsurrounded on all sides. Firing off his gun, he cried, \"To arms!\"\r\nRoland, roused by the cry and the shot, leaped out of bed, and taking\r\nhis clothes in one hand and his sword in the other, ran out of his room.\r\nAt the door he met Grimaud, who, instead of thinking of his own safety,\r\nhad come to watch over that of his chief. They both ran to the stables\r\nto get horses, but three of their men—Marchand, Bourdalie, and Bayos—had\r\nbeen before them and had seized on the best ones, and riding them\r\nbare-backed had dashed through the front gates before the dragoons could\r\nstop them. The horses that were left were so wretched that Roland felt\r\nthere was no chance of out-distancing the dragoons by their help, so he\r\nresolved to fly on foot, thus avoiding the open roads and being able to\r\ntake refuge in every ravine and every bush as cover. He therefore\r\nhastened with Grimaud and four other officers who had gathered round him\r\ntowards a small back gate which opened on the fields, but as there was,\r\nbesides the troops which entered the chateau, a ring of dragoons round\r\nit, they fell at once into the hands of some men who had been placed in\r\nambush. Seeing himself surrounded, Roland let fall the clothes which he\r\nhad not yet had time to put on, placed his back against a tree, drew his\r\nsword, and challenged the boldest, whether officer or private, to\r\napproach. His features expressed such resolution, that when he thus,\r\nalone and half naked, defied them all, there was a moment’s hesitation,\r\nduring which no one ventured to take a forward step; but this pause was\r\nbroken by the report of a gun: the arm which Roland had stretched out\r\nagainst his adversaries fell to his side, the sword with which he had\r\nthreatened them escaped from his hand, his knees gave way, so that his\r\nbody, which was only supported by the tree against which he leaned,\r\nafter remaining an instant erect, gradually sank to the ground.\r\nCollecting all his strength, Roland raised his two hands to Heaven, as\r\nif to call down the vengeance of God upon his murderers, then, without\r\nhaving uttered a single word, he fell forward dead, shot through the\r\nheart. The name of the dragoon who killed him was Soubeyrand.\r\n\r\nMaillie, Grimaud, Coutereau, Guerin, and Ressal, the five Camisard\r\nofficers, seeing their chief dead, let themselves be taken as if they\r\nwere children, without thinking of making any resistance.\r\n\r\nThe dead body of Roland was carried back in triumph to Uzes, and from\r\nthere to Nimes, where it was put upon trial as if still alive. It was\r\nsentenced to be dragged on hurdles and then burnt. The execution of this\r\nsentence was carried out with such pomp as made it impossible for the\r\none party to forget the punishment and for the other to forget the\r\nmartyrdom. At the end the ashes of Roland were scattered to the four\r\nwinds of heaven.\r\n\r\nThe execution of the five officers followed close on that of their\r\nchief’s body; they were condemned to be broken on the wheel, and the\r\nsentence was carried out on all at once. But their death, instead of\r\ninspiring the Calvinists with terror, gave them rather fresh courage,\r\nfor, as an eye-witness relates, the five Camisards bore their tortures\r\nnot only with fortitude, but with a light-heartedness which surprised\r\nall present, especially those who had never seen a Camisard executed\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nMalarte received his 200 Louis, but to-day his name is coupled with that\r\nof Judas in the minds of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nFrom this time on fortune ceased to smile on the Camisards. Genius had\r\ngone with Cavalier, and, faith with Roland. The very day of the death of\r\nthe latter, one of their stores, containing more than eighty sacks of\r\ncorn, had been taken at Toiras. The next day, Catinat, who, with a dozen\r\nmen, was in hiding in a vineyard of La Vaunage, was surprised by a\r\ndetachment of Soissonnais; eleven of his men were killed, the twelfth\r\nmade prisoner, and he himself barely escaped with a severe wound. The\r\n25th of the same month, a cavern near Sauve, which the rebels used as a\r\nstore, and which contained one hundred and fifty sacks of fine wheat,\r\nwas discovered; lastly, Chevalier de Froulay had found a third\r\nhiding-place near Mailet. In this, which had been used not only as a\r\nstore but as a hospital, besides a quantity of salt beef, wine, and\r\nflour, six wounded Camisards were found, who were instantly shot as they\r\nlay.\r\n\r\nThe only band which remained unbroken was Ravanel’s, but since the\r\ndeparture of Cavalier things had not gone well with his lieutenant.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this, and also on account of the successive checks\r\nwhich the other bodies of Camisard troops had met with, Ravanel\r\nproclaimed a solemn fast, in order to intercede with God to protect the\r\nHuguenot cause. On Saturday, the 13th September, he led his entire force\r\nto the wood of St. Benazet, intending to pass the whole of the next day\r\nwith them there in prayer. But treason was rife. Two peasants who knew\r\nof this plan gave information to M. Lenoir, mayor of Le Vigan, and he\r\nsent word to the marechal and M. de Saville, who were at Anduze.\r\n\r\nNothing could have been more welcome to the governor than this important\r\ninformation: he made the most careful disposition of his forces, hoping\r\nto destroy the rebellion at one blow. He ordered M. de Courten, a\r\nbrigadier-colonel in command at Alais, to take a detachment of the\r\ntroops under him and patrol the banks of the Gardon between Ners and\r\nCastagnols. He was of opinion that if the Camisards were attacked on the\r\nother side by a body of soldiers drawn from Anduze, which he had\r\nstationed during the night at Dommersargues, they would try to make good\r\ntheir retreat towards the river. The force at Dommersargues might almost\r\nbe called a small army; for it was composed of a Swiss battalion, a\r\nbattalion of the Hainault regiment, one from the Charolais regiment, and\r\nfour companies of dragoons from Fimarcon and Saint-Sernin.\r\n\r\nEverything took place as the peasants had said: on Saturday the 13th,\r\nthe Camisards entered, as we have seen, the wood of St. Benazet, and\r\npassed the night there.\r\n\r\nAt break of day the royals from Dommersargues began their advance. The\r\nCamisard outposts soon perceived the movement, and warned Ravanel, who\r\nheld his little council of war. Everyone was in favour of instant\r\nretreat, so they retired towards Ners, intending to cross the Gardon\r\nbelow that town: just as M. de Villars had foreseen, the Camisards did\r\neverything necessary for the success of his plans, and ended by walking\r\nright into the trap set for them.\r\n\r\nOn emerging from the wood of St. Benazet, they caught sight of a\r\ndetachment of royals drawn up and waiting for them between Marvejols and\r\na mill called the Moulin-du-Pont. Seeing the road closed in this\r\ndirection, they turned sharp to the left, and gained a rocky valley\r\nwhich ran parallel to the Gardon. This they followed till they came out\r\nbelow Marvejols, where they crossed the river. They now thought\r\nthemselves out of danger, thanks to this manoeuvre, but suddenly they\r\nsaw another detachment of royals lying on the grass near the mill of La\r\nScie. They at once halted again, and then, believing themselves\r\nundiscovered, turned back, moving as noiselessly as possible, intending\r\nto recross the river and make for Cardet. But they only avoided one trap\r\nto fall into another, for in this direction they were met by the\r\nHainault battalion, which swooped down upon them. A few of these\r\nill-fated men rallied at the sound of Ravanel’s voice and made an effort\r\nto defend themselves in spite of the prevailing confusion; but the\r\ndanger was so imminent, the foes so numerous, and their numbers\r\ndecreased so rapidly under the fierce assault, that their example failed\r\nof effect, and flight became general: every man trusted to chance for\r\nguidance, and, caring nothing for the safety of others, thought only of\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\nThen it ceased to be a battle and become a massacre, for the royals were\r\nten to one; and among those they encountered, only sixty had firearms,\r\nthe rest, since the discovery of their various magazines, having been\r\nreduced to arm themselves with bad swords, pitchforks, and bayonets\r\nattached to sticks. Hardly a man survived the fray. Ravanel himself only\r\nsucceeded in escaping by throwing himself into the river, where he\r\nremained under water between two rocks for seven hours, only coming to\r\nthe surface to breathe. When night fell and the dragoons had retired, he\r\nalso fled.\r\n\r\nThis was the last battle of the war, which had lasted four years. With\r\nCavalier and Roland, those two mountain giants, the power of the rebels\r\ndisappeared. As the news of the defeat spread, the Camisard chiefs and\r\nsoldiers becoming convinced that the Lord had hidden His face from them,\r\nsurrendered one by one. The first to set an example was Castanet. On\r\nSeptember 6th, a week after the defeat of Ravanel, he surrendered to the\r\nmarechal. On the 19th, Catinat and his lieutenant, Franqois Souvayre,\r\ntendered their submission; on the 22nd, Amet, Roland’s brother, came in;\r\non October 4th, Joanny; on the 9th, Larose, Valette, Salomon, Laforet,\r\nMoulieres, Salles, Abraham and Marion; on the 20th, Fidele; and on the\r\n25th, Rochegude.\r\n\r\nEach made what terms he could; in general the conditions were\r\nfavourable. Most of those who submitted received rewards of money, some\r\nmore, some less; the smallest amount given being 200 livres. They all\r\nreceived passports, and were ordered to leave the kingdom, being sent,\r\naccompanied by an escort and at the king’s expense, to Geneva. The\r\nfollowing is the account given by Marion of the agreement he came to\r\nwith the Marquis Lalande; probably all the others were of the same\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n\"I was deputed,\" he says, \"to treat with this lieutenant-general in\r\nregard to the surrender of my own troops and those of Larose, and to\r\narrange terms for the inhabitants of thirty-five parishes who had\r\ncontributed to our support during the war. The result of the\r\nnegotiations was that all the prisoners from our cantons should be set\r\nat liberty, and be reinstated in their possessions, along with all the\r\nothers. The inhabitants of those parishes which had been ravaged by fire\r\nwere to be exempt from land-tax for three years; and in no parish were\r\nthe inhabitants to be taunted with the past, nor molested on the subject\r\nof religion, but were to be free to worship God in their own houses\r\naccording to their consciences.\"\r\n\r\nThese agreements were fulfilled with such punctuality, that Larose was\r\npermitted to open the prison doors of St. Hippolyte to forty prisoners\r\nthe very day he made submission.\r\n\r\nAs we have said, the Camisards, according as they came in, were sent off\r\nto Geneva. D’Aygaliers, whose fate we have anticipated, arrived there on\r\nSeptember 23rd, accompanied by Cavalier’s eldest brother, Malpach,\r\nRoland’s secretary, and thirty-six Camisards. Catinat and Castanet\r\narrived there on the 8th October, along with twenty-two other persons,\r\nwhile Larose, Laforet, Salomon, Moulieres, Salles, Marion, and Fidele\r\nreached it under the escort of forty dragoons from Fimarcon in the month\r\nof November.\r\n\r\nOf all the chiefs who had turned Languedoc for four years into a vast\r\narena, only Ravanel remained, but he refused either to surrender or to\r\nleave the country. On the 8th October the marechal issued an order\r\ndeclaring he had forfeited all right to the favour of an amnesty, and\r\noffering a reward of 150 Louis to whoever delivered him up living, and\r\n2400 livres to whoever brought in his dead body, while any hamlet,\r\nvillage, or town which gave him refuge would be burnt to the ground and\r\nthe inhabitants put to the sword.\r\n\r\nThe revolt seemed to be at an end and peace established. So the marechal\r\nwas recalled to court, and left Nimes on January the 6th. Before his\r\ndeparture he received the States of Languedoc, who bestowed on him not\r\nonly the praise which was his due for having tempered severity with\r\nmercy, but also a purse of 12,000 livres, while a sum of 8000 livres was\r\npresented to his wife. But all this was only a prelude to the favours\r\nawaiting him at court. On the day he returned to Paris the king\r\ndecorated him with all the royal orders and created him a duke. On the\r\nfollowing day he received him, and thus addressed him: \"Sir, your past\r\nservices lead me to expect much of those you will render me in the\r\nfuture. The affairs of my kingdom would be better conducted if I had\r\nseveral Villars at my disposal. Having only one, I must always send him\r\nwhere he is most needed. It was for that reason I sent you to Languedoc.\r\nYou have, while there, restored tranquillity to my subjects, you must\r\nnow defend them against their enemies; for I shall send you to command\r\nmy army on the Moselle in the next campaign.\"\r\n\r\nThe, Duke of Berwick arrived at Montpellier on the 17th March to replace\r\nMarechal Villars. His first care was to learn from M. de Baville the\r\nexact state of affairs. M. de Baville told him that they were not at all\r\nsettled as they appeared to be on the surface. In fact, England and\r\nHolland, desiring nothing so much as that an intestine war should waste\r\nFrance, were making unceasing efforts to induce the exiles to return\r\nhome, promising that this time they would really support them by lending\r\narms, ammunition, and men, and it was said that some were already on\r\ntheir way back, among the number Castanet.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed the late rebel chief, tired of inaction, had left Geneva in\r\nthe end of February, and arrived safely at Vivarais. He had held a\r\nreligious meeting in a cave near La Goree, and had drawn to his side\r\nValette of Vals and Boyer of Valon. Just as the three had determined to\r\npenetrate into the Cevennes, they were denounced by some peasants before\r\na Swiss officer named Muller, who was in command of a detachment of\r\ntroops in the village of Riviere. Muller instantly mounted his horse,\r\nand guided by the informers made his way into the little wood in which\r\nthe Camisards had taken refuge, and fell upon them quite unexpectedly.\r\nBoyer was killed in trying to escape; Castanet was taken and brought to\r\nthe nearest prison, where he was joined the next day by Valette, who had\r\nalso been betrayed by some peasants whom he had asked for assistance.\r\n\r\nThe first punishment inflicted on Castanet was, that he was compelled to\r\ncarry in his hand the head of Boyer all the way from La Goree to\r\nMontpellier. He protested vehemently at first, but in vain: it was\r\nfastened to his wrist by the hair; whereupon he kissed it on both\r\ncheeks, and went through the ordeal as if it were a religious act,\r\naddressing words of prayer to the head as he might have done to a relic\r\nof a martyr.\r\n\r\nArrived at Montpellier, Castanet was examined, and at first persisted in\r\nsaying that he had only returned from exile because he had not the\r\nwherewithal to live abroad. But when put to the torture he was made to\r\nendure such agony that, despite his courage and constancy, he confessed\r\nthat he had formed a plan to introduce a band of Huguenot soldiers with\r\ntheir officers into the Cevennes by way of Dauphine or by water, and\r\nwhile waiting for their arrival he had sent on emissaries in advance to\r\nrouse the people to revolt; that he himself had also shared in this\r\nwork; that Catinat was at the moment in Languedoc or Vivarais engaged in\r\nthe same task, and provided with a considerable sum of money sent him by\r\nforeigners for distribution, and that several persons of still greater\r\nimportance would soon cross the frontier and join him.\r\n\r\nCastanet was condemned to be broken on the wheel. As he was about to be\r\nled to execution, Abbe Tremondy, the cure of Notre-Dame, and Abbe\r\nPlomet, canon of the cathedral, came to his cell to make a last effort\r\nto convert him, but he refused to speak. They therefore went on before,\r\nand awaited him on the scaffold. There they appeared to inspire Castanet\r\nwith more horror than the instruments of torture, and while he addressed\r\nthe executioner as \"brother,\" he called out to the priests, \"Go away out\r\nof my sight, imps from the bottomless pit! What are you doing here, you\r\naccursed tempters? I will die in the religion in which I was born. Leave\r\nme alone, ye hypocrites, leave me alone!\" But the two abbes were\r\nunmoved, and Castanet expired cursing, not the executioner but the two\r\npriests, whose presence during his death-agony disturbed his soul,\r\nturning it away from things which should have filled it.\r\n\r\nValette was sentenced to be hanged, and was executed on the same day as\r\nCastanet.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the admissions wrung from Castanet in March, nearly a month\r\npassed without any sign of fresh intrigues or any attempt at rebellion.\r\nBut on the 17th of April, about seven o’clock in the evening, M. de\r\nBaville received intelligence that several Camisards had lately returned\r\nfrom abroad, and were in hiding somewhere, though their retreat was not\r\nknown. This information was laid before the Duke of Berwick, and he and\r\nM. de Baville ordered certain houses to be searched, whose owners were\r\nin their opinion likely to have given refuge to the malcontents. At\r\nmidnight all the forces which they could collect were divided into\r\ntwelve detachments, composed of archers and soldiers, and at the head of\r\neach detachment was placed a man that could be depended upon. Dumayne,\r\nthe king’s lieutenant, assigned to each the districts they were to\r\nsearch, and they all set out at once from the town hall, at half-past\r\ntwelve, marching in silence, and separating at signs from their leaders,\r\nso anxious were they to make no noise. At first all their efforts were\r\nof no avail, several houses being searched without any result; but at\r\nlength Jausserand, the diocesan provost, having entered one of the\r\nhouses which he and Villa, captain of the town troops, had had assigned\r\nto them, they found three men sleeping on mattresses laid on the floor.\r\nThe provost roused them by asking them who they were, whence they came,\r\nand what they were doing at Montpellier, and as they, still half asleep,\r\ndid not reply quite promptly, he ordered them to dress and follow him.\r\n\r\nThese three men were Flessiere, Gaillard, and Jean-Louis. Flessiere was\r\na deserter from the Fimarcon regiment: he it was who knew most about the\r\nplot. Gaillard had formerly served in the Hainault regiment; and\r\nJean-Louis, commonly called \"the Genevois,\" was a deserter from the\r\nCourten regiment.\r\n\r\nFlessiere, who was the leader, felt that it would be a great disgrace to\r\nlet themselves be taken without resistance; he therefore pretended to\r\nobey, but in lifting up his clothes, which lay upon a trunk, he managed\r\nto secure two pistols, which he cocked. At the noise made by the hammers\r\nthe provost’s suspicions were aroused, and throwing himself on\r\nFlessiere, he seized him round the waist from behind. Flessiere, unable\r\nto turn, raised his arm and fired over his shoulder. The shot missed the\r\nprovost, merely burning a lock of his hair, but slightly wounded one of\r\nhis servants, who was carrying a lantern. He then tried to fire a second\r\nshot, but Jausserand, seizing him by the wrist with one hand, blew out\r\nhis brains with the other. While Jausserand and Flessiere were thus\r\nstruggling, Gaillard threw himself on Villa, pinning his arms to his\r\nsides. As he had no weapons, he tried to push him to the wall, in order\r\nto stun him by knocking his head against it; but when the servant, being\r\nwounded, let the lantern fall, he took advantage of the darkness to make\r\na dash for the door, letting go his hold of his antagonist.\r\nUnfortunately for him, the doors, of which there were two, were guarded,\r\nand the guards, seeing a half-naked man running away at the top of his\r\nspeed, ran after him, firing several shots. He received a wound which,\r\nthough not dangerous, impeded his flight, so that he was soon overtaken\r\nand captured. They brought him back a prisoner to the town hall, where\r\nFlessiere’s dead body already lay.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Jean-Louis had had better luck. While the two struggles as\r\nrelated above were going on, he slipped unnoticed to an open window and\r\ngot out into the street. He ran round the corner of the house, and\r\ndisappeared like a shadow in the darkness before the eyes of the guards.\r\nFor a long time he wandered from street to street, running down one and\r\nup another, till chance brought him near La Poissonniere. Here he\r\nperceived a beggar propped against a post and fast asleep; he awoke him,\r\nand proposed that they should exchange clothes. As Jean-Louis’ suit was\r\nnew and the beggar’s in rags, the latter thought at first it was a joke.\r\nSoon perceiving, however, that the offer was made in all seriousness, he\r\nagreed to the exchange, and the two separated, each delighted with his\r\nbargain. Jean-Louis approached one of the gates of the town, in order to\r\nbe able to get out as soon as it was opened, and the beggar hastened off\r\nin another direction, in order to get away from the man who had let him\r\nhave so good a bargain, before he had time to regret the exchange he had\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nBut the night’s adventures were far from being over. The beggar was\r\ntaken a prisoner, Jean-Louis’ coat being recognised, and brought to the\r\ntown hall, where the mistake was discovered. The Genevois meantime got\r\ninto a dark street, and lost his way. Seeing three men approach, one of\r\nwhom carried a lantern, he went towards the light, in order to find out\r\nwhere he was, and saw, to his surprise, that one of the men was the\r\nservant whom Flessiere had wounded, and who was now going to have his\r\nwound dressed. The Genevois tried to draw back into the shade, but it\r\nwas too late: the servant had recognised him. He then tried to fly; but\r\nthe wounded man soon overtook him, and although one of his hands was\r\ndisabled, he held him fast with the other, so that the two men who were\r\nwith him ran up and easily secured him. He also was brought to the town\r\nhall, where he found the Duke of Berwick and M. de Baville, who were\r\nawaiting the result of the affray.\r\n\r\nHardly had the prisoner caught sight of them than, seeing himself\r\nalready hanged, which was no wonder considering the marvellous celerity\r\nwith which executions were conducted at that epoch, he threw himself on\r\nhis knees, confessed who he was, and related for what reason he had\r\njoined the fanatics. He went on to say that as he had not joined them of\r\nhis own free will, but had been forced to do so, he would, if they would\r\nspare his life, reveal important secrets to them, by means of which they\r\ncould arrest the principal conspirators.\r\n\r\nHis offer was so tempting and his life of so little worth that the duke\r\nand de Baville did not long hesitate, but pledged their word to spare\r\nhis life if the revelations he was about to make proved to be of real\r\nimportance. The bargain being concluded, the Genevois made the following\r\nstatement:\r\n\r\n\"That several letters having arrived from foreign countries containing\r\npromises of men and money, the discontented in the provinces had leagued\r\ntogether in order to provoke a fresh rebellion. By means of these\r\nletters and other documents which were scattered abroad, hopes were\r\nraised that M. de Miremont, the last Protestant prince of the house of\r\nBourbon, would bring them reinforcements five or six thousand strong.\r\nThese reinforcements were to come by sea and make a descent on\r\nAigues-Mortes or Cette,—and two thousand Huguenots were to arrive at the\r\nsame time by way of Dauphine and join the others as they disembarked.\r\n\r\n\"That in this hope Catinat, Clary, and Jonquet had left Geneva and\r\nreturned to France, and having joined Ravanel had gone secretly through\r\nthose parts of the country known to be infected with fanaticism, and\r\nmade all necessary arrangements, such as amassing powder and lead,\r\nmunitions of war, and stores of all kinds, as well as enrolling the\r\nnames of all those who were of age to bear arms. Furthermore, they had\r\nmade an estimate of what each city, town, and village ought to\r\ncontribute in money or in kind to the—League of the Children of God, so\r\nthat they could count on having eight or ten thousand men ready to rise\r\nat the first signal. They had furthermore resolved that there should be\r\nrisings in several places at the same time, which places were already\r\nchosen, and each of those who were to take part in the movement knew his\r\nexact duty. At Montpellier a hundred of the most determined amongst the\r\ndisaffected were to set fire in different quarters to the houses of the\r\nCatholics, killing all who attempted to extinguish the fires, and with\r\nthe help of the Huguenot inhabitants were, to slaughter the garrison,\r\nseize the citadel, and carry off the Duke of Berwick and M. de Baville.\r\nThe same things were to be done at Nimes, Uzes, Alais, Anduze,\r\nSaint-Hippolyte, and Sommieres. Lastly, he said, this conspiracy had\r\nbeen going on for more than three months, and the conspirators, in order\r\nnot to be found out, had only revealed their plans to those whom they\r\nknew to be ready to join them: they had not admitted a single woman to\r\ntheir confidence, or any man whom it was possible to suspect. Further,\r\nthey had only met at night and a few persons at a time, in certain\r\ncountry houses, to which admittance was gained by means of a\r\ncountersign; the 25th of April was the day fixed for the general rising\r\nand the execution of these projects.\"\r\n\r\nAs may be seen, the danger was imminent, as there was only six days’\r\ninterval between the revelation and the expected outburst; so the\r\nGenevois was consulted, under renewed promises of safety for himself, as\r\nto the best means of seizing on the principal chiefs in the shortest\r\npossible time. He replied that he saw no other way but to accompany them\r\nhimself to Nimes, where Catinat and Ravanel were in hiding, in a house\r\nof which he did not know the number and in a street of which he did not\r\nknow the name, but which he was sure of recognising when he saw them. If\r\nthis advice were to be of any avail, there was no time to be lost, for\r\nRavanel and Catinat were to leave Nimes on the 20th or the 21st at\r\nlatest; consequently, if they did not set off at once, the chiefs would\r\nno longer be there when they arrived. The advice seemed good, so the\r\nmarechal and the intendant hastened to follow it: the informer was sent\r\nto Nimes guarded by six archers, the conduct of the expedition was given\r\nto Barnier, the provost’s lieutenant, a man of intellect and common\r\nsense, and in whom the provost had full confidence. He carried letters\r\nfor the Marquis of Sandricourt.\r\n\r\nAs they arrived late on the evening of the 19th, the Genevois was at\r\nonce led up and down the streets of Nimes, and, as he had promised, he\r\npointed out several houses in the district of Sainte-Eugenie.\r\nSandricourt at once ordered the garrison officers, as well as those of\r\nthe municipal and Courten regiments, to put all their soldiers under\r\narms and to station them quietly throughout the town so as to surround\r\nthat district. At ten o’clock, the Marquis of Sandricourt, having made\r\ncertain that his instructions had been carefully carried out, gave\r\norders to MM. de L’Estrade, Barnier, Joseph Martin, Eusebe, the major of\r\nthe Swiss regiment, and several other officers, along with ten picked\r\nmen, to repair to the house of one Alison, a silk merchant, this house\r\nhaving been specially pointed out by the prisoner. This they did, but\r\nseeing the door open, they had little hope of finding the chiefs of a\r\nconspiracy in a place so badly guarded; nevertheless, determined to obey\r\ntheir instructions, they glided softly into the hall. In a few moments,\r\nduring which silence and darkness reigned, they heard people speaking\r\nrather loudly in an adjoining room, and by listening intently they\r\ncaught the following words: \"It is quite sure that in less than three\r\nweeks the king will be no longer master of Dauphine, Vivarais, and\r\nLanguedoc. I am being sought for everywhere, and here I am in Nimes,\r\nwith nothing to fear.\"\r\n\r\nIt was now quite clear to the listeners that close at hand were some at\r\nleast of those for whom they were looking. They ran to the door, which\r\nwas ajar, and entered the room, sword in hand. They found Ravanel,\r\nJonquet, and Villas talking together, one sitting on a table, another\r\nstanding on the hearth, and the third lolling on a bed.\r\n\r\nJonquet was a young man from Sainte-Chatte, highly thought of among the\r\nCamisards. He had been, it may be remembered, one of Cavalier’s\r\nprincipal officers. Villas was the son of a doctor in Saint-Hippolyte;\r\nhe was still young, though he had seen ten years’ service, having been\r\ncornet in England in the Galloway regiment. As to Ravanel, he is\r\nsufficiently known to our readers to make any words of introduction\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\nDe l’Estrade threw himself on the nearest of the three, and, without\r\nusing his sword, struck him with his fist. Ravanel (for it was he) being\r\nhalf stunned, fell back a step and asked the reason of this violent\r\nassault; while Barnier exclaimed, \"Hold him fast, M. de l’Estrade; it is\r\nRavanel!\" \"Well, yes, I am Ravanel,\" said the Camisard, \"but that is no\r\nreason for making so much noise.\" As he said these words he made an\r\nattempt to reach his weapons, but de l’Estrade and Barnier prevented him\r\nby throwing themselves on him, and succeeded in knocking him down after\r\na fierce struggle. While, this was going on, his two companions were\r\nsecured, and the three were removed to the fort, where their guard never\r\nleft them night or day.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Sandricourt immediately sent off a courier to the Duke of\r\nBerwick and M. de Baville to inform them of the important capture he had\r\nmade. They were so delighted at the news that they came next day to\r\nNimes.\r\n\r\nThey found the town intensely excited, soldiers with fixed bayonets at\r\nevery street corner, all the houses shut up, and the gates of the town\r\nclosed, and no one allowed to leave without written permission from\r\nSandricourt. On the 20th, and during the following night, more than\r\nfifty persons were arrested, amongst whom were Alison, the merchant in\r\nwhose house Ravanel, Villas, and Jonquet were found; Delacroix, Alison’s\r\nbrother-in-law, who, on hearing the noise of the struggle, had hidden on\r\nthe roof and was not discovered till next day; Jean Lauze, who was\r\naccused of having prepared Ravanel’s supper; Lauze’s mother, a widow;\r\nTourelle, the maid-servant; the host of the Coupe d’Or, and a preacher\r\nnamed La Jeunesse.\r\n\r\nGreat, however, as was the joy felt by the duke, the marquis, and de\r\nBaville, it fell short of full perfection, for the most dangerous man\r\namong the rebels was still at large; in spite of every effort, Catinat’s\r\nhiding-place had not till now been discovered.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the duke issued a proclamation offering a reward of one\r\nhundred Louis-d’or to whoever would take Catinat, or cause him to be\r\ntaken prisoner, and granting a free pardon to anyone who had sheltered\r\nhim, provided that he was denounced before the house-to-house visitation\r\nwhich was about to be made took place. After the search began, the\r\nmaster of the house in which he might be found would be hung at his own\r\ndoor, his family thrown into prison, his goods confiscated, his house\r\nrazed to the ground, without any form of trial whatever.\r\n\r\nThis proclamation had the effect expected by the duke: whether the man\r\nin whose house Catinat was concealed grew frightened and asked him to\r\nleave, or whether Catinat thought his best course would be to try and\r\nget away from the town, instead of remaining shut up in it, he dressed\r\nhimself one morning in suitable clothes, and went to a barber’s, who\r\nshaved him, cut his hair, and made up his face so as to give him as much\r\nthe appearance of a nobleman as possible; and then with wonderful\r\nassurance he went out into the streets, and pulling his hat over his\r\neyes and holding a paper in his hand as if reading it, he crossed the\r\ntown to the gate of St. Antoine. He was almost through when Charreau,\r\nthe captain of the guard, having his attention directed to Catinat by a\r\ncomrade to whom he was talking, stopped him, suspecting he was trying to\r\nescape. Catinat asked what he wanted with him, and Charreau replied that\r\nif he would enter the guard-house he would learn; as under such\r\ncircumstances any examination was to be avoided, Catinat tried to force\r\nhis way out; whereupon he was seized by Charreau and his\r\nbrother-officer, and Catinat seeing that resistance would be not only\r\nuseless but harmful, allowed himself to be taken to the guard-room.\r\n\r\nHe had been there about an hour without being recognised by any of those\r\nwho, drawn by curiosity, came to look at him, when one of the visitors\r\nin going out said he bore a strong resemblance to Catinat; some children\r\nhearing these words, began to shout, \"Catinat is taken! Catinat is\r\ntaken!\" This cry drew a large crowd to the guard-house, among others a\r\nman whose name was Anglejas, who, looking closely at the prisoner,\r\nrecognised him and called him by name.\r\n\r\nInstantly the guard was doubled, and Catinat searched: a psalm-book with\r\na silver clasp and a letter addressed to \"M. Maurel, called Catinat,\"\r\nwere found on him, leaving no doubt as to his identity; while he\r\nhimself, growing impatient, and desiring to end all these\r\ninvestigations, acknowledged that he was Catinat and no other.\r\n\r\nHe was at once taken to the palace, where the Presidial Court was\r\nsitting, M. de Baville and the president being occupied in trying\r\nRavanel, Villas, and Jonquet. On hearing the news of this important\r\ncapture, the intendant, hardly daring to believe his ears, rose and went\r\nout to meet the prisoner, in order to convince himself that it was\r\nreally Catinat.\r\n\r\nFrom the Presidial Court he was brought before the Duke of Berwick, who\r\naddressed several questions to him, which Catinat answered; he then told\r\nthe duke he had something of importance to impart to him and to him\r\nalone. The duke was not very anxious for a tete-a-tete with Catinat;\r\nhowever, having ordered his hands to be securely bound, and telling\r\nSandricourt not to go away, he consented to hear what the prisoner had\r\nto say.\r\n\r\nCatinat then, in the presence of the duke and Sandricourt, proposed that\r\nan exchange of prisoners should be made, the Marechal de Tallard, who\r\nwas a prisoner of war in England, being accepted in his place. Catinat\r\nadded that if this offer was not accepted, the marechal would meet the\r\nsame treatment from the English as might be meted out to him, Catinat,\r\nin France. The duke, full of the aristocratic ideas to which he was\r\nborn, found the proposal insolent, and said, \"If that is all you have to\r\npropose, I can assure you that your hours are numbered.\"\r\n\r\nThereupon Catinat was promptly sent back to the palace, where truly his\r\ntrial did not occupy much time. That of the three others was already\r\nfinished, and soon his was also at an end, and it only remained to\r\npronounce sentence on all four. Catinat and Ravanel, as the most guilty,\r\nwere condemned to be burnt at the stake. Some of the councillors thought\r\nCatinat should have been torn apart by four horses, but the majority\r\nwere for the stake, the agony lasting longer, being more violent and\r\nmore exquisite than in the of other case.\r\n\r\nVillars and Jonquet were sentenced to be broken on the wheel alive—the\r\nonly difference between them being that Jonquet was to be to taken while\r\nstill living and thrown into the fire lit round Catinat and Ravael. It\r\nwas also ordered that the four condemned men before their execution\r\nshould be put to the torture ordinary and extraordinary. Catinat, whose\r\ntemper was fierce, suffered with courage, but cursed his torturers.\r\nRavanel bore all the torments that could be inflicted on him with a\r\nfortitude that was more than human, so that the torturers were exhausted\r\nbefore he was. Jonquet spoke little, and the revelations he made were of\r\nslight importance. Villas confessed that the conspirators had the\r\nintention of carrying off the duke and M. de Baville when they were out\r\nwalking or driving, and he added that this plot had been hatched at the\r\nhouse of a certain Boeton de Saint-Laurent-d’Aigozre, at Milhaud, in\r\nRouergue.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile all this torturing and questioning had taken so much time that\r\nwhen the stake and the scaffold were ready it was almost dark, so that\r\nthe duke put off the executions until the next day, instead of carrying\r\nthem out by torchlight. Brueys says that this was done in order that the\r\nmost disaffected amongst the fanatics should not be able to say that it\r\nwas not really Catinat, Ravanel, Villas, and Jonquet who had been\r\nexecuted but some other unknown men; but it is more probable that the\r\nduke and Baville were afraid of riots, as was proved by their ordering\r\nthe scaffold and the stake to be erected at the end of the Cours and\r\nopposite the glacis of the fortress, so that the garrison might be at\r\nhand in case of any disturbance.\r\n\r\nCatinat was placed in a cell apart, and could be, heard cursing and\r\ncomplaining all night through. Ravanel, Villas, and Jonquet were\r\nconfined together, and passed the night singing and praying.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 22nd April, 1705, they were taken from the prison and\r\ndrawn to the place of execution in two carts, being unable to walk, on\r\naccount of the severe torture to which they had been subjected, and\r\nwhich had crushed the bones of their legs. A single pile of wood had\r\nbeen prepared for Catinat and Ravanel, who were to be burnt together;\r\nthey were in one cart, and Villas and Jonquet, for whom two wheels had\r\nbeen prepared, were in the other.\r\n\r\nThe first operation was to bind Catinat and Ravanel back to back to the\r\nsame stake, care being taken to place Catinat with his face to windward,\r\nso that his agony might last longer, and then the pile was lit under\r\nRavanel.\r\n\r\nAs had been foreseen, this precaution gave great pleasure to those\r\npeople who took delight in witnessing executions. The wind being rather\r\nhigh, blew the flames away from Catinat, so that at first the fire burnt\r\nhis legs only—a circumstance which, the author of the History of the\r\nCamisards tells us, aroused Catinat’s impatience. Ravanel, however, bore\r\neverything to the end with the greatest heroism, only pausing in his\r\nsinging to address words of encouragement to his companion in suffering,\r\nwhom he could not see, but whose groans and curses he could hear; he\r\nwould then return to his psalms, which he continued to sing until his\r\nvoice was stifled in the flames. Just as he expired, Jonquet was removed\r\nfrom the wheel, and carried, his broken limbs dangling, to the burning\r\npile, on which he was thrown. From the midst of the flames his voice was\r\nheard saying, \"Courage, Catinat; we shall soon meet in heaven.\" A few\r\nmoments later, the stake, being burnt through at the base, broke, and\r\nCatinat falling into the flames, was quickly suffocated. That this\r\naccident had not been forseen and prevented by proper precautions caused\r\ngreat displeasure to spectators who found that the three-quarter of an\r\nhour which the spectacle had lasted was much too brief a time.\r\n\r\nVillas lived three hours longer on his wheel, and expired without having\r\nuttered a single complaint.\r\n\r\nTwo days later, there was another trial, at which six persons were\r\ncondemned to death and one to the galleys; these were the two Alisons,\r\nin whose house Villas, Ravanel, and Jonquet had been found; Alegre, who\r\nwas accused of having concealed Catinat, and of having been the Camisard\r\ntreasurer; Rougier, an armourer who was found guilty of having repaired\r\nthe muskets of the rebels; Jean Lauze, an innkeeper who had prepared\r\nmeals for Ravanel; La Jeunesse, a preacher, convicted of having preached\r\nsermons and sung psalms; and young Delacroix, brother-in-law to one of\r\nthe Alisons. The first three were condemned to be broken on the wheel,\r\ntheir houses demolished, and their goods confiscated. The next three\r\nwere to be hanged. Jean Delacroix, partly because of his youth, but more\r\nbecause of the revelations he made, was only sent to the galleys.\r\nSeveral years later he was liberated and returned to Arles, and was\r\ncarried off by the plague in 1720.\r\n\r\nAll these sentences were carried out with the utmost rigour.\r\n\r\nThus, as may be seen, the suppression of the revolt proceeded apace;\r\nonly two young Camisard chiefs were still at large, both of whom had\r\nformerly served under Cavalier and Catinat. The name of the one was Brun\r\nand of the other Francezet. Although neither of them possessed the\r\ngenius and influence of Catinat and Ravanel, yet they were both men to\r\nbe feared, the one on account of his personal strength, the other for\r\nhis skill and agility. Indeed, it was said of him that he never missed a\r\nshot, and that one day being pursued by dragoons he had escaped by\r\njumping over the Gardon at a spot where it was twenty-two feet wide.\r\n\r\nFor a long time all search was in vain, but one day the wife of a miller\r\nnamed Semenil came into town ostensibly to buy provisions, but really to\r\ndenounce them as being concealed, with two other Camisards, in her\r\nhusband’s house.\r\n\r\nThis information was received with an eager gratitude, which showed the\r\nimportance which the governor of Nimes attached to their capture. The\r\nwoman was promised a reward of fifty Louis if they were taken, and the\r\nChevalier de la Valla, Grandidier, and fifty Swiss, the major of the\r\nSaint-Sernin regiment, a captain, and thirty dragoons, were sent off to\r\nmake the capture. When they were within a quarter of a league of the\r\nmill, La Valla, who was in command of the expedition, made the woman\r\ngive him all the necessary topographical information.\r\n\r\nHaving learned that besides the door by which they hoped to effect an\r\nentrance, the mill possessed only one other, which opened on a bridge\r\nover the Vistre, he despatched ten dragoons and five Swiss to occupy\r\nthis bridge, whilst he and the rest of the troops bore down on the main\r\nentrance. As soon as the four Camisards perceived the approach of the\r\nsoldiers, their first thought was to escape by the bridge, but one of\r\nthem having gone up to the roof to make sure that the way was clear,\r\ncame down exclaiming that the bridge was occupied. On hearing this, the\r\nfour felt that they were lost, but nevertheless resolved to defend\r\nthemselves as valiantly and to sell their lives as dearly as possible.\r\nAs soon as the royals were within musket range of the mill, four shots\r\nwere fired, and two dragoons, one Swiss, and one horse, fell. M. de\r\nValla thereupon ordered the troops to charge at full gallop, but before\r\nthe mill door was reached three other shots were heard, and two more men\r\nkilled. Nevertheless, seeing they could not long hold out against such\r\nnumbers, Francezet gave the signal for retreat, calling out, \"Sauve qui\r\npetit!\" at the same instant he jumped out of a lattice window twenty\r\nfeet from the ground, followed by Brun. Neither of them being hurt, both\r\nset off across country, one trusting to his strength and the other to\r\nhis fleetness of foot. The two other Camisards, who had tried to escape\r\nby the door, were captured.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers, horse and foot, being now free to give all their attention\r\nto Brun and Francezet, a wonderful race began; for the two fugitives,\r\nbeing strong and active, seemed to play with their pursuers, stopping\r\nevery now and then, when they had gained sufficient headway, to shoot at\r\nthe nearest soldiers; when Francezet, proving worthy of his reputation,\r\nnever missed a single shot. Then, resuming their flight and loading\r\ntheir weapons as they ran, they leaped rivers and ditches, taking\r\nadvantage of the less direct road which the troops were obliged to\r\nfollow, to stop and take breath, instead of making for some cover where\r\nthey might have found safety. Two or three times Brun was on the point\r\nof being caught, but each time the dragoon or Swiss who had got up to\r\nhim fell, struck by Francezet’s unerring bullet. The chase lasted four\r\nhours, during which time five officers, thirty dragoons, and fifty Swiss\r\nwere baffled by two men, one of whom Francezet was almost a boy, being\r\nonly twenty years old! Then the two Camisards, having exhausted their\r\nammunition, gave each other the name of a village as a rendezvous, and\r\neach taking a different direction, bounded away with the lightness of a\r\nstag. Francezet ran in the direction of Milhaud with such rapidity that\r\nhe gained on the dragoons, although they put their horses at full speed.\r\nHe was within an inch of safety, when a peasant named La Bastide, who\r\nwas hoeing in a field, whence he had watched the contest with interest\r\nfrom the moment he had first caught sight of it, seeing the fugitive\r\nmake for an opening in a wall, ran along at the foot of the wall on the\r\nother side, and, just as Francezet dashed through the opening like a\r\nflash of lightning, struck him such a heavy blow on the head with his\r\nhoe that the skull was laid open, and he fell bathed in blood.\r\n\r\nThe dragoons, who had seen in the distance what had happened, now came\r\nup, and rescued Francezet from the hands of his assailant, who had\r\ncontinued to rain blows upon him, desiring to put an end to him. The\r\nunconscious Camisard was carried to Milhaud, where his wounds were\r\nbandaged, and himself revived by means of strong spirits forced into\r\nmouth and nostrils.\r\n\r\nWe now return to Brun. At first it seemed as if he were more fortunate\r\nthan his comrade; for, meeting with no obstacle, he was soon not only\r\nout of reach, but out of sight of his enemies. He now, however, felt\r\nbroken by fatigue, and taught caution by the treachery to which he had\r\nalmost fallen a victim, he dared not ask for an asylum, so, throwing\r\nhimself down in a ditch, he was soon fast asleep. The dragoons, who had\r\nnot given up the search, presently came upon him, and falling on him as\r\nhe lay, overpowered him before he was well awake.\r\n\r\nWhen both Camisards met before the governor, Francezet replied to all\r\ninterrogations that since the death of brother Catinat his sole desire\r\nhad been to die a martyr’s death like him; while Brun said that he was\r\nproud and happy to die in the cause of the Lord along with such a brave\r\ncomrade as Francezet. This manner of defence led to the application of\r\nthe question both ordinary and extraordinary, and to the stake; and our\r\nreaders already know what such a double sentence meant. Francezet and\r\nBrun paid both penalties on the 30th of April, betraying no secrets and\r\nuttering no complaints.\r\n\r\nBoeton, who had been denounced by Villas when under torture (and who\r\nthereby abridged his agony) as the person in whose house the plot to\r\ncarry off the Duke of Berwick and de Baville had been arranged, still\r\nremained to be dealt with.\r\n\r\nHe was moderate in his religious views, but firm and full of faith; his\r\nprinciples resembled those of the Quakers in that he refused to carry\r\narms; he was, however, willing to aid the good cause by all other means\r\nwithin his reach. He was at home waiting, with that calm which perfect\r\ntrust in God gives, for the day to come which had been appointed for the\r\nexecution of the plan, when suddenly his house was surrounded during the\r\nnight by the royals. Faithful to his principles, he offered no\r\nresistance, but held out his hands to be bound. He was taken in triumph\r\nto Nimes, and from there to the citadel of Montpellier. On the way he\r\nencountered his wife and his son, who were going to the latter town to\r\nintercede for him. When they met him, they dismounted from their horse,\r\nfor the mother was riding on a pillion behind the son, and kneeling on\r\nthe highroad, asked for Boeton’s blessing. Unfeeling though the soldiers\r\nwere, they yet permitted their prisoner to stop an instant, while he,\r\nraising his fettered hands to heaven, gave the double blessing asked\r\nfor. So touched was Baron Saint-Chatte by the scene (be it remarked in\r\npassing that the baron and Boeton were cousins by marriage) that he\r\npermitted them to embrace one another, so for a few moments they stood,\r\nthe husband and father clasped to the hearts of his dear ones; then, on\r\na sign from Boeton, they tore themselves away, Boeton commanding them to\r\npray for M. de Saint-Chatte, who had given them this consolation. As he\r\nresumed his march the prisoner set them the example by beginning to sing\r\na psalm for the benefit of M. de Saint-Chatte.\r\n\r\nThe next day, despite the intercession of his wife and son, Boeton was\r\ncondemned to torture both ordinary and extraordinary, and then to be\r\nbroken on the wheel. On hearing this cruel sentence, he said that he was\r\nready to suffer every ill that God might send him in order to prove the\r\nsteadfastness of his faith.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed he endured his torture with such firmness, that M. de\r\nBaville, who was present in the hope of obtaining a confession, became\r\nmore impatient than the sufferer, and, forgetting his sacred office, the\r\njudge struck and insulted the prisoner. Upon this Baeton raised his eyes\r\nto heaven and cried, \"Lord, Lord! how long shall the wicked triumph? How\r\nlong shall innocent blood be shed? How long wilt Thou not judge and\r\navenge our blood with cries to Thee? Remember Thy jealousy, O Lord, and\r\nThy loving-kindness of old!\" Then M. de Baville withdrew, giving orders\r\nthat he was to be brought to the scaffold.\r\n\r\nThe scaffold was erected on the Esplanade: being, as was usual when this\r\nsort of death was to be inflicted, a wooden platform five or six feet\r\nhigh, on which was fastened flat a St. Andrew’s cross, formed of two\r\nbeams of wood in the form of an X. In each of the four arms two square\r\npieces were cut out to about half the depth of the beam, and about a\r\nfoot apart, so that when the victim was bound on the cross the\r\noutstretched limbs were easy to break by a blow at these points, having\r\nno support beneath. Lastly, near the cross, at one corner of the\r\nscaffold an upright wooden post was fixed, on which was fastened\r\nhorizontally a small carriage wheel, as on a pivot, the projecting part\r\nof the nave being sawn off to make it flat. On this bed of pain the\r\nsufferer was laid, so that the spectators might enjoy the sight of his\r\ndying convulsions when, the executioner having accomplished his part,\r\nthe turn of death arrived.\r\n\r\nBoeton was carried to execution in a cart, and drums were beaten that\r\nhis exhortations might not be heard. But above the roll of drums his\r\nvoice rose unfalteringly, as he admonished his brethren to uphold their\r\nfellowship in Christ.\r\n\r\nHalf-way to the Esplanade a friend of the condemned man, who happened to\r\nbe in the street, met the procession, and fearing that he could not\r\nsupport the sight, he took refuge in a shop. When Boeton was opposite\r\nthe door, he stopped the cart and asked permission of the provost to\r\nspeak to his friend. The request being granted, he called him out, and\r\nas he approached, bathed in tears, Boeton said, \"Why do you run away\r\nfrom me? Is it because you see me covered with the tokens of Jesus\r\nChrist? Why do you weep because He has graciously called me to Himself,\r\nand all unworthy though I be, permits me to seal my faith with my\r\nblood?\" Then, as the friend threw himself into Boeton’s arms and some\r\nsigns of sympathetic emotion appeared among the crowd; the procession\r\nwas abruptly ordered to move on; but though the leave-taking was thus\r\nroughly broken short, no murmur passed the lips of Boeton.\r\n\r\nIn turning out of the first street, the scaffold came in sight; the\r\ncondemned man raised his hands towards heaven, and exclaimed in a\r\ncheerful voice, while a smile lit up his face, \"Courage, my soul! I see\r\nthy place of triumph, whence, released from earthly bonds, thou shall\r\ntake flight to heaven.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he got to the foot of the scaffold, it was found he could not mount\r\nwithout assistance; for his limbs, crushed in the terrible \"boot,\" could\r\nno longer sustain his weight. While they were preparing to carry him up,\r\nhe exhorted and comforted the Protestants, who were all weeping round\r\nhim. When he reached the platform he laid himself of his own accord on\r\nthe cross; but hearing from the executioner that he must first be\r\nundressed, he raised himself again with a smile, so that the\r\nexecutioner’s assistant could remove his doublet and small-clothes. As\r\nhe wore no stockings, his legs being bandaged the man also unwound these\r\nbandages, and rolled up Boeton’s shirts-sleeves to the elbow, and then\r\nordered him to lay himself again on the cross. Boeton did so with\r\nunbroken calm. All his limbs were then bound to the beams with cords at\r\nevery joint; this accomplished, the assistant retired, and the\r\nexecutioner came forward. He held in his hand a square bar of iron, an\r\ninch and a half thick, three feet long, and rounded at one end so as to\r\nform a handle.\r\n\r\nWhen Boeton saw it he began singing a psalm, but almost immediately the\r\nmelody was interrupted by a cry: the executioner had broken a bone of\r\nBoeton’s right leg; but the singing was at once resumed, and continued\r\nwithout interruption till each limb had been broken in two places. Then\r\nthe executioner unbound the formless but still living body from the\r\ncross, and while from its lips issued words of faith in God he laid it\r\non the wheel, bending it back on the legs in such a manner that the\r\nheels and head met; and never once during the completion of this\r\natrocious performance did the voice of the sufferer cease to sound forth\r\nthe praises of the Lord.\r\n\r\nNo execution till then had ever produced such an effect on the crowd, so\r\nthat Abbe Massilla, who was present, seeing the general emotion,\r\nhastened to call M. de Baville’s attention to the fact that, far from\r\nBoeton’s death inspiring the Protestants with terror, they were only\r\nencouraged to hold out, as was proved by their tears, and the praises\r\nthey lavished on the dying man.\r\n\r\n  M. de Baville, recognising the truth of this observation, ordered that\r\n     Boeton should be put out of misery. This order being conveyed to\r\n     the executioner, he approached the wheel to break in Boeton’s chest\r\n     with one last blow; but an archer standing on the scaffold threw\r\n     himself before the sufferer, saying that the Huguenot had not yet\r\n     suffered half enough. At this, Boeton, who had heard the dreadful\r\n     dispute going on beside him, interrupted his prayers for an\r\n     instant, and raising his head, which hung down over the edge of the\r\n     wheel, said, \"Friend, you think I suffer, and in truth I do; but He\r\n     for whom I suffer is beside me and gives me strength to bear\r\n     everything joyfully.\" Just then M. de Baville’s order was repeated,\r\n     and the archer, no longer daring to interfere, allowed the\r\n     executioner to approach. Then Boeton, seeing his last moment had\r\n     come, said, \"My dear friends, may my death be an example to you, to\r\n     incite you to preserve the gospel pure; bear faithful testimony\r\n     that I died in the religion of Christ and His holy apostles.\"\r\n     Hardly had these words passed his lips, than the death-blow was\r\n     given and his chest crushed; a few inarticulate sounds, apparently\r\n     prayers, were heard; the head fell back, the martyrdom was ended.\r\n\r\nThis execution ended the war in Languedoc. A few imprudent preachers\r\nstill delivered belated sermons, to which the rebels listened trembling\r\nwith fear, and for which the preachers paid on the wheel or gibbet.\r\nThere were disturbances in Vivarais, aroused by Daniel Billard, during\r\nwhich a few Catholics were found murdered on the highway; there were a\r\nfew fights, as for instance at Sainte-Pierre-Ville, where the Camisards,\r\nfaithful to the old traditions which had come to them from Cavalier,\r\nCatinat, and Ravenal, fought one to twenty, but they were all without\r\nimportance; they were only the last quiverings of the dying civil\r\nstrife, the last shudderings of the earth when the eruption of the\r\nvolcano is over.\r\n\r\nEven Cavalier understood that the end had come, for he left Holland for\r\nEngland. There Queen Anne distinguished him by a cordial welcome; she\r\ninvited him to enter her service, an offer which he accepted, and he was\r\nplaced in command of a regiment of refugees; so that he actually\r\nreceived in England the grade of colonel, which he had been offered in\r\nFrance. At the battle of Almanza the regiment commanded by Cavalier\r\nfound itself opposed by a French regiment. The old enemies recognised\r\neach other, and with a howl of rage, without waiting for the word of\r\ncommand or executing any military evolutions, they hurled themselves at\r\neach other with such fury that, if we may believe the Duke of Berwick,\r\nwho was present, they almost annihilated each other in the conflict.\r\nCavalier, however, survived the slaughter, in which he had performed his\r\npart with energy; and for his courage was made general and governor of\r\nthe island of Jersey. He died at Chelsea in May 1740, aged sixty years.\r\n\"I must confess,\" says Malesherbes, \"that this soldier, who without\r\ntraining became a great general by means of his natural gifts; this\r\nCamisard, who dared in the face of fierce troopers to punish a crime\r\nsimilar to those by which the troopers existed; this rude peasant, who,\r\nadmitted into the best society; adopted its manners and gained its\r\nesteem and love; this man, who though accustomed to an adventurous life,\r\nand who might justly have been puffed up by success, had yet enough\r\nphilosophy to lead for thirty-five years a tranquil private existence,\r\nappears to me to be one of the rarest characters to be met with in the\r\npages of history.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nAt length Louis XIV, bowed beneath the weight of a reign of sixty years,\r\nwas summoned in his turn to appear before God, from whom, as some said,\r\nhe looked for reward, and others for pardon. But Nimes, that city with\r\nthe heart of fire, was quiet; like the wounded who have lost the best\r\npart of their blood, she thought only, with the egotism of a\r\nconvalescent, of being left in peace to regain the strength which had\r\nbecome exhausted through the terrible wounds which Montrevel and the\r\nDuke of Berwick had dealt her. For sixty years petty ambition had taken\r\nthe place of sublime self-sacrifice, and disputes about etiquette\r\nsucceeded mortal combats. Then the philosophic era dawned, and the\r\nsarcasms of the encyclopedists withered the monarchical intolerance of\r\nLouis XIV and Charles IX. Thereupon the Protestants resumed their\r\npreaching, baptized their children and buried their dead, commerce\r\nflourished once more, and the two religions lived side by side, one\r\nconcealing under a peaceful exterior the memory of its martyrs, the\r\nother the memory of its triumphs. Such was the mood on which the\r\nblood-red orb of the sun of ’89 rose. The Protestants greeted it with\r\ncries of joy, and indeed the promised liberty gave them back their\r\ncountry, their civil rights, and the status of French citizens.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, whatever were the hopes of one party or the fears of the\r\nother, nothing had as yet occurred to disturb the prevailing\r\ntranquillity, when, on the 19th and 20th of July, 1789, a body of troops\r\nwas formed in the capital of La Gard which was to bear the name of the\r\nNimes Militia: the resolution which authorised this act was passed by\r\nthe citizens of the three orders sitting in the hall of the palace.\r\n\r\nIt was as follows:—\r\n\r\n\"Article 10. The Nimes Legion shall consist of a colonel, a\r\nlieutenant-colonel, a major, a lieutenant-major, an adjutant,\r\ntwenty-four captains, twenty-four lieutenants, seventy-two sergeants,\r\nseventy-two corporals, and eleven hundred and fifty-two privates—in all,\r\nthirteen hundred and forty-nine men, forming eighty companies.\r\n\r\n\"Article 11. The place of general assembly shall be, the Esplanade.\r\n\r\n\"Article 12. The eighty companies shall be attached to the four quarters\r\nof the town mentioned below—viz., place de l’Hotel-de-Ville, place de la\r\nMaison-Carree, place Saint-Jean, and place du Chateau.\r\n\r\n\"Article 13. The companies as they are formed by the permanent council\r\nshall each choose its own captain, lieutenant, sergeants and corporals,\r\nand from the date of his nomination the captain shall have a seat on the\r\npermanent council.\"\r\n\r\nThe Nimes Militia was deliberately formed upon certain lines which\r\nbrought Catholics and Protestants closely together as allies, with\r\nweapons in their hands; but they stood over a mine which was bound to\r\nexplode some day, as the slightest friction between the two parties\r\nwould produce a spark.\r\n\r\nThis state of concealed enmity lasted for nearly a year, being augmented\r\nby political antipathies; for the Protestants almost to man were\r\nRepublicans, and the Catholics Royalists.\r\n\r\nIn the interval—that is to say, towards January, 1790—a Catholic called\r\nFrancois Froment was entrusted by the Marquis de Foucault with the task\r\nof raising, organising, and commanding a Royalist party in the South.\r\nThis we learn from one of his own letters to the marquis, which was\r\nprinted in Paris in 1817. He describes his mode of action in the\r\nfollowing words:—\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to understand that being faithful to my religion and\r\nmy king, and shocked at the seditious ideas which were disseminated on\r\nall sides, I should try to inspire others with the same spirit with\r\nwhich I myself was animated, so, during the year 1789, I published\r\nseveral articles in which I exposed the dangers which threatened altar\r\nand throne. Struck with the justice of my criticisms, my countrymen\r\ndisplayed the most zealous ardor in their efforts to restore to the king\r\nthe full exercise of all his rights. Being anxious to take advantage of\r\nthis favourable state of feeling, and thinking that it would be\r\ndangerous to hold communication with the ministers of Louis XVI, who\r\nwere watched by the conspirators, I went secretly to Turin to solicit\r\nthe approbation and support of the French princes there. At a\r\nconsultation which was held just after my arrival, I showed them that if\r\nthey would arm not only the partisans of the throne, but those of the\r\naltar, and advance the interests of religion while advancing the\r\ninterests of royalty, it would be easy to save both.\r\n\r\n\"My plan had for sole object to bind a party together, and give it as\r\nfar as I was able breadth and stability.\r\n\r\n\"As the revolutionists placed their chief dependence on force, I felt\r\nthat they could only be met by force; for then as now I was convinced of\r\nthis great truth, that one strong passion can only be overcome by\r\nanother stronger, and that therefore republican fanaticism could only be\r\ndriven out by religious zeal.\r\n\r\n\"The princes being convinced of the correctness of my reasoning and the\r\nefficacy of my remedies, promised me the arms and supplies necessary to\r\nstem the tide of faction, and the Comte d’Artois gave me letters of\r\nrecommendation to the chief nobles in Upper Languedoc, that I might\r\nconcert measures with them; for the nobles in that part of the country\r\nhad assembled at Toulouse to deliberate on the best way of inducing the\r\nother Orders to unite in restoring to the Catholic religion its useful\r\ninfluence, to the laws their power, and to the king his liberty and\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n\"On my return to Languedoc, I went from town to town in order to meet\r\nthose gentlemen to whom the Comte d’Artois had written, among whom were\r\nmany of the most influential Royalists and some members of the States of\r\nParliament. Having decided on a general plan, and agreed on a method of\r\ncarrying on secret correspondence with each other, I went to Nimes to\r\nwait for the assistance which I had been promised from Turin, but which\r\nI never received. While waiting, I devoted myself to awakening and\r\nsustaining the zeal of the inhabitants, who at my suggestion, on the\r\n20th April, passed a resolution, which was signed by 5,000 inhabitants.\"\r\n\r\nThis resolution, which was at once a religious and political manifesto,\r\nwas drafted by Viala, M. Froment’s secretary, and it lay for signature\r\nin his office. Many of the Catholics signed it without even reading it,\r\nfor there was a short paragraph prefixed to the document which contained\r\nall the information they seemed to desire.\r\n\r\n\"GENTLEMEN,—The aspirations of a great number of our Catholic and\r\npatriotic fellow-citizens are expressed in the resolution which we have\r\nthe honour of laying before you. They felt that under present\r\ncircumstances such a resolution was necessary, and they feel convinced\r\nthat if you give it your support, as they do not doubt you will, knowing\r\nyour patriotism, your religious zeal, and your love for our august\r\nsovereign, it will conduce to the happiness of France, the maintenance\r\nof the true religion, and the rightful authority of the king.\r\n\r\n\"We are, gentlemen, with respect, your very humble and obedient\r\nservants, the President and Commissioners of the Catholic Assembly of\r\nNimes.\r\n\r\n\"(Signed):\r\n\r\n    \"FROMENT, Commissioner\r\n     LAPIERRE, President\r\n     FOLACHER,    \"\r\n     LEVELUT, Commissioner\r\n     FAURE,\r\n     MELCHIOND,   \"\r\n     ROBIN,       \"\r\n     VIGNE,       \" \"\r\n\r\nAt the same time a number of pamphlets, entitled Pierre Roman to the\r\nCatholics of Nimes, were distributed to the people in the streets,\r\ncontaining among other attacks on the Protestants the following\r\npassages:\r\n\r\n\"If the door to high positions and civil and military honours were\r\nclosed to the Protestants, and a powerful tribunal established at Nimes\r\nto see that this rule were strictly kept, you would soon see\r\nProtestantism disappear.\r\n\r\n\"The Protestants demand to share all the privileges which you enjoy, but\r\nif you grant them this, their one thought will then be to dispossess you\r\nentirely, and they will soon succeed.\r\n\r\n\"Like ungrateful vipers, who in a torpid state were harmless, they will\r\nwhen warmed by your benefits turn and kill you.\r\n\r\n\"They are your born enemies: your fathers only escaped as by a miracle\r\nfrom their blood-stained hands. Have you not often heard of the\r\ncruelties practised on them? It was a slight thing when the Protestants\r\ninflicted death alone, unaccompanied by the most horrible tortures. Such\r\nas they were such they are.\"\r\n\r\nIt may easily be imagined that such attacks soon embittered minds\r\nalready disposed to find new causes for the old hatred, and besides the\r\nCatholics did not long confine themselves to resolutions and pamphlets.\r\nFroment, who had already got himself appointed Receiver-General of the\r\nChapter and captain of one of the Catholic companies, insisted on being\r\npresent at the installation of the Town Council, and brought his company\r\nwith him armed with pitchforks, in spite of the express prohibition of\r\nthe colonel of the legion. These forks were terrible weapons, and had\r\nbeen fabricated in a particular form for the Catholics of Nimes, Uzes,\r\nand Alais. But Froment and his company paid no attention to the\r\nprohibition, and this disobedience made a great impression on the\r\nProtestants, who began to divine the hostility of their adversaries, and\r\nit is very possible that if the new Town Council had not shut their eyes\r\nto this act of insubordination, civil war might have burst forth in\r\nNimes that very day.\r\n\r\nThe next day, at roll-call, a sergeant of another company, one Allien, a\r\ncooper by trade, taunted one of the men with having carried a pitchfork\r\nthe day before, in disobedience to orders. He replied that the mayor had\r\npermitted him to carry it; Allien not believing this, proposed to some\r\nof the men to go with him to the mayor’s and ask if it were true. When\r\nthey saw M. Marguerite, he said that he had permitted nothing of the\r\nkind, and sent the delinquent to prison. Half an hour later, however, he\r\ngave orders for his release.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was free he set off to find his comrades, and told them\r\nwhat had occurred: they, considering that an insult to one was an insult\r\nto the whole company, determined on having satisfaction at once, so\r\nabout eleven o’clock P.M. they went to the cooper’s house, carrying with\r\nthem a gallows and ropes ready greased. But quietly as they approached,\r\nAllien heard them, for his door being bolted from within had to be\r\nforced. Looking out of the window, he saw a great crowd, and as he\r\nsuspected that his life was in danger, he got out of a back window into\r\nthe yard and so escaped. The militia being thus disappointed, wreaked\r\ntheir vengeance on some passing Protestants, whose unlucky stars had led\r\nthem that way; these they knocked about, and even stabbed one of them\r\nthree times with a knife.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd April, 1790, the royalists—that is to say, the\r\nCatholics—assumed the white cockade, although it was no longer the\r\nnational emblem, and on the 1st May some of the militia who had planted\r\na maypole at the mayor’s door were invited to lunch with him. On the\r\n2nd, the company which was on guard at the mayor’s official residence\r\nshouted several times during the day, \"Long live the king! Up with the\r\nCross and down with the black throats!\" (This was the name which they\r\nhad given to the Calvinists.) \"Three cheers for the white cockade!\r\nBefore we are done, it will be red with the blood of the Protestants!\"\r\nHowever, on the 5th of May they ceased to wear it, replacing it by a\r\nscarlet tuft, which in their patois they called the red pouf, which was\r\nimmediately adopted as the Catholic emblem.\r\n\r\nEach day as it passed brought forth fresh brawls and provocations:\r\nlibels were invented by the Capuchins, and spread abroad by three of\r\ntheir number. Meetings were held every day, and at last became so\r\nnumerous that the town authorities called in the aid of the\r\nmilitia-dragoons to disperse them. Now these gatherings consisted\r\nchiefly of those tillers of the soil who are called cebets, from a\r\nProvencal word cebe, which means \"onion,\" and they could easily be\r\nrecognised as Catholics by their red pouf, which they wore both in and\r\nout of uniform. On the other hand, the dragoons were all Protestants.\r\n\r\nHowever, these latter were so very gentle in their admonitions, that\r\nalthough the two parties found themselves, so to speak, constantly face\r\nto face and armed, for several days the meetings were dispersed without\r\nbloodshed. But this was exactly what the cebets did not want, so they\r\nbegan to insult the dragoons and turn them into ridicule. Consequently,\r\none morning they gathered together in great numbers, mounted on asses,\r\nand with drawn swords began to patrol the city.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the lower classes, who were nearly all Catholics,\r\njoined the burlesque patrols in complaining loudly of the dragoons, some\r\nsaying that their horses had trampled on their children, and others that\r\nthey had frightened their wives.\r\n\r\nThe Protestants contradicted them, both parties grew angry, swords were\r\nhalf drawn, when the municipal authorities came on the scene, and\r\ninstead of apprehending the ringleaders, forbade the dragoons to patrol\r\nthe town any more, ordering them in future to do nothing more than send\r\ntwenty men every day to mount guard at the episcopal palace and to\r\nundertake no other duty except at the express request of the Town\r\nCouncil. Although it was expected that the dragoons would revolt against\r\nsuch a humiliation, they submitted, which was a great disappointment to\r\nthe cebets, who had been longing for a chance to indulge in new\r\noutrages. For all that, the Catholics did not consider themselves\r\nbeaten; they felt sure of being able to find some other way of driving\r\ntheir quarry to bay.\r\n\r\nSunday, the 13th of June, arrived. This day had been selected by the\r\nCatholics for a great demonstration. Towards ten o’clock in the morning,\r\nsome companies wearing the red tuft, under pretext of going to mass,\r\nmarched through the city armed and uttering threats. The few dragoons,\r\non the other hand, who were on guard at the palace, had not even a\r\nsentinel posted, and had only five muskets in the guard-house. At two\r\no’clock P.M. there was a meeting held in the Jacobin church, consisting\r\nalmost exclusively of militia wearing the red tuft. The mayor pronounced\r\na panegyric on those who wore it, and was followed by Pierre Froment,\r\nwho explained his mission in much the same words as those quoted above.\r\nHe then ordered a cask of wine to be broached and distributed among the\r\ncebets, and told them to walk about the streets in threes, and to disarm\r\nall the dragoons whom they might meet away from their post. About six\r\no’clock in the evening a red-tuft volunteer presented himself at the\r\ngate of the palace, and ordered the porter to sweep the courtyard,\r\nsaying that the volunteers were going to get up a ball for the dragoons.\r\nAfter this piece of bravado he went away, and in a few moments a note\r\narrived, couched in the following terms:\r\n\r\n\"The bishop’s porter is warned to let no dragoon on horse or on foot\r\nenter or leave the palace this evening, on pain of death.\r\n\r\n\"13th June 1790.\"\r\n\r\nThis note being brought to the lieutenant, he came out, and reminded the\r\nvolunteer that nobody but the town authorities could give orders to the\r\nservants at the palace. The volunteer gave an insolent answer, the\r\nlieutenant advised him to go away quietly, threatening if he did not to\r\nput him out by force. This altercation attracted a great many of the\r\nred-tufts from outside, while the dragoons, hearing the noise, came down\r\ninto the yard; the quarrel became more lively, stones were thrown, the\r\ncall to arms was heard, and in a few moments about forty cebets, who\r\nwere prowling around in the neighbourhood of the palace, rushed into the\r\nyard carrying guns and swords. The lieutenant, who had only about a\r\ndozen dragoons at his back, ordered the bugle to sound, to recall those\r\nwho had gone out; the volunteers threw themselves upon the bugler,\r\ndragged his instrument from his hands, and broke it to pieces. Then\r\nseveral shots were fired by the militia, the dragoons returned them, and\r\na regular battle began. The lieutenant soon saw that this was no mere\r\nstreet row, but a deliberate rising planned beforehand, and realising\r\nthat very serious consequences were likely to ensue, he sent a dragoon\r\nto the town hall by a back way to give notice to the authorities.\r\n\r\n  M. de Saint-Pons, major of the Nimes legion, hearing some noise\r\n     outside, opened his window, and found the whole city in a tumult:\r\n     people were running in every direction, and shouting as they ran\r\n     that the dragoons were being killed at the palace. The major rushed\r\n     out into the streets at once, gathered together a dozen to fifteen\r\n     patriotic citizens without weapons, and hurried to the town hall:\r\n     There he found two officials of the town, and begged them to go at\r\n     once to the place de l’Eveche, escorted by the first company, which\r\n     was on guard at the town hall. They agreed, and set off. On the way\r\n     several shots were fired at them, but no one was hit. When they\r\n     arrived at the square, the cebets fired a volley at them with the\r\n     same negative result. Up the three principal streets which led to\r\n     the palace numerous red-tufts were hurrying; the first company took\r\n     possession of the ends of the streets, and being fired at returned\r\n     the fire, repulsing the assailants and clearing the square, with\r\n     the loss of one of their men, while several of the retreating\r\n     cebets were wounded.\r\n\r\nWhile this struggle was going on at the palace, the spirit of murder\r\nbroke loose in the town.\r\n\r\nAt the gate of the Madeleine, M. de Jalabert’s house was broken into by\r\nthe red-tufts; the unfortunate old man came out to meet them and asked\r\nwhat they wanted. \"Your life and the lives of all the other dogs of\r\nProtestants!\" was the reply. Whereupon he was seized and dragged through\r\nthe streets, fifteen insurgents hacking at him with their swords.\r\n\r\nAt last he managed to escape from their hands, but died two days later\r\nof his wounds.\r\n\r\nAnother old man named Astruc, who was bowed beneath the weight of\r\nseventy-two years and whose white hair covered his shoulders, was met as\r\nhe was on his way to the gate of Carmes. Being recognised as a\r\nProtestant, he received five wounds from some of the famous pitchforks\r\nbelonging to the company of Froment. He fell, but the assassins picked\r\nhim up, and throwing him into the moat, amused themselves by flinging\r\nstones at him, till one of them, with more humanity than his fellows,\r\nput a bullet through his head.\r\n\r\nThree electors—M. Massador from near Beaucaire, M. Vialla from the\r\ncanton of Lasalle, and M. Puech of the same place-were attacked by\r\nred-tufts on their way home, and all three seriously wounded. The\r\ncaptain who had been in command of the detachment on guard at the\r\nElectoral Assembly was returning to his quarters, accompanied by a\r\nsergeant and three volunteers of his own company, when they were stopped\r\non the Petit-Cours by Froment, commonly called Damblay, who, pressing\r\nthe barrel of a pistol to the captain’s breast, said, \"Stand, you\r\nrascal, and give up your arms.\" At the same time the red-tufts, seizing\r\nthe captain from behind by the hair, pulled him down. Froment fired his\r\npistol, but missed. As he fell the captain drew his sword, but it was\r\ntorn from his hands, and he received a cut from Froment’s sword. Upon\r\nthis the captain made a great effort, and getting one of his arms free,\r\ndrew a pistol from his pocket, drove back his assassins, fired at\r\nFroment, and missed him. One of the men by his side was wounded and\r\ndisarmed.\r\n\r\nA patrol of the regiment of Guienne, attached to which was M. Boudon, a\r\ndragoon officer, was passing the Calquieres. M. Boudon was attacked by a\r\nband of red-tufts and his casque and his musket carried off. Several\r\nshots were fired at him, but none of them hit him; the patrol surrounded\r\nhim to save him, but as he had received two bayonet wounds, he desired\r\nrevenge, and, breaking through his protectors, darted forward to regain\r\npossession of his musket, and was killed in a moment. One of his fingers\r\nwas cut off to get at a diamond ring which he wore, his pockets were\r\nrifled of his purse and watch, and his body was thrown into the moat.\r\n\r\nMeantime the place-des-Recollets, the Cours, the place-des-Carmes, the\r\nGrand-Rue, and rue de Notre Dame-de-l’Esplanade were filled with men\r\narmed with guns, pitchforks, and swords. They had all come from\r\nFroment’s house, which overlooked that part of Nimes called Les\r\nCalquieres, and the entrance to which was on the ramparts near the\r\nDominican Towers. The three leaders of the insurrection—Froment.\r\nFolacher, and Descombiez—took possession of these towers, which formed a\r\npart of the old castle; from this position the Catholics could sweep the\r\nentire quay of Les Calquieres and the steps of the Salle de Spectacle\r\nwith their guns, and if it should turn out that the insurrection they\r\nhad excited did not attain the dimensions they expected nor gain such\r\nenthusiastic adherents, it would be quite feasible for them to defend\r\nthemselves in such a position until relief came.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements were either the result of long meditation or were the\r\ninspiration of some clever strategist. The fact is that everything leads\r\none to believe that it was a plan which had been formed with great care,\r\nfor the rapidity with which all the approaches to the fortress were\r\nlined with a double row of militiamen all wearing the red tuft, the care\r\nwhich was taken to place the most eager next the barracks in which the\r\npark of artillery was stationed, and lastly, the manner in which the\r\napproach to the citadel was barred by an entire company (this being the\r\nonly place where the patriots could procure arms), combine to prove that\r\nthis plan was the result of much forethought; for, while it appeared to\r\nbe only defensive, it enabled the insurrectionists to attack without\r\nmuch, danger; it caused others to believe that they had been first\r\nattacked. It was successfully carried out before the citizens were\r\narmed, and until then only a part of the foot guard and the twelve\r\ndragoons at the palace had offered any resistance to the conspirators.\r\n\r\nThe red flag round which, in case of civil war, all good citizens were\r\nexpected to gather, and which was kept at the town hall, and which\r\nshould have been brought out at the first shot, was now loudly called\r\nfor. The Abbe de Belmont, a canon, vicar-general, and municipal\r\nofficial, was persuaded, almost forced, to become standard-bearer, as\r\nbeing the most likely on account of his ecclesiastical position to awe\r\nrebels who had taken up arms in the name of religion. The abbe himself\r\ngives the following account of the manner in which he fulfilled this\r\nmandate:\r\n\r\n\"About seven o’clock in the evening I was engaged with MM. Porthier and\r\nFerrand in auditing accounts, when we heard a noise in the court, and\r\ngoing out on the lobby, we saw several dragoons coming upstairs, amongst\r\nwhom was M. Paris. They told us that fighting was going on in the place\r\nde-l’Eveche, because some one or other had brought a note to the porter\r\nordering him to admit no more dragoons to the palace on pain of death.\r\nAt this point I interrupted their story by asking why the gates had not\r\nbeen closed and the bearer of the letter arrested, but they replied to\r\nme that it had not been possible; thereupon MM. Ferrand and Ponthier put\r\non their scarfs and went out.\r\n\r\n\"A few instants later several dragoons, amongst whom I recognised none\r\nbut MM. Lezan du Pontet, Paris junior, and Boudon, accompanied by a\r\ngreat number of the militia, entered, demanding that the red flag should\r\nbe brought out. They tried to open the door of the council hall, and\r\nfinding it locked, they called upon me for the key. I asked that one of\r\nthe attendants should be sent for, but they were all out; then I went to\r\nthe hall-porter to see if he knew where the key was. He said M. Berding\r\nhad taken it. Meanwhile, just as the volunteers were about to force an\r\nentrance, someone ran up with the key. The door was opened, and the red\r\nflag seized and forced into my hands. I was then dragged down into the\r\ncourtyard, and from thence to the square.\r\n\r\n\"It was all in vain to tell them that they ought first to get authority,\r\nand to represent to them that I was no suitable standard-bearer on\r\naccount of my profession; but they would not listen to any objection,\r\nsaying that my life depended upon my obedience, and that my profession\r\nwould overawe the disturbers of the public peace. So I went on, followed\r\nby a detachment of the Guienne regiment, part of the first company of\r\nthe legion, and several dragoons; a young man with fixed bayonet kept\r\nalways at my side. Rage was depicted on the faces of all those who\r\naccompanied me, and they indulged in oaths and threats, to which I paid\r\nno attention.\r\n\r\n\"In passing through the rue des Greffes they complained that I did not\r\ncarry the red flag high enough nor unfurl it fully. When we got to the\r\nguardhouse at the Crown Gate, the guard turned out, and the officer was\r\ncommanded to follow us with his men. He replied that he could not do\r\nthat without a written order from a member of the Town Council.\r\nThereupon those around me told me I must write such an order, but I\r\nasked for a pen and ink; everybody was furious because I had none with\r\nme. So offensive were the remarks indulged in by the volunteers and some\r\nsoldiers of the Guienne regiment, and so threatening their gestures,\r\nthat I grew alarmed. I was hustled and even received several blows; but\r\nat length M. de Boudon brought me paper and a pen, and I wrote:—’I\r\nrequire the troops to assist us to maintain order by force if\r\nnecessary.’ Upon this, the officer consented to accompany us. We had\r\nhardly taken half a dozen steps when they all began to ask what had\r\nbecome of the order I had just written, for it could not be found. They\r\nsurrounded me, saying that I had not written it at all, and I was on the\r\npoint of being trampled underfoot, when a militiaman found it all\r\ncrumpled up in his pocket. The threats grew louder, and once more it was\r\nbecause I did not carry the flag high enough, everyone insisting that I\r\nwas quite tall enough to display it to better advantage.\r\n\r\n\"However, at this point the militiamen with the red tufts made their\r\nappearance, a few armed with muskets but the greater number with swords;\r\nshots were exchanged, and the soldiers of the line and the National\r\nGuard arranged themselves in battle order, in a kind of recess, and\r\ndesired me to go forward alone, which I refused to do, because I should\r\nhave been between two fires.\r\n\r\n\"Upon this, curses, threats, and blows reached their height. I was\r\ndragged out before the troops and struck with the butt ends of their\r\nmuskets and the flat of their swords until I advanced. One blow that I\r\nreceived between the shoulders filled my mouth with blood.\r\n\r\n\"All this time those of the opposite party were coming nearer, and those\r\nwith whom I was continued to yell at me to go on. I went on until I met\r\nthem. I besought them to retire, even throwing myself at their feet. But\r\nall persuasion was in vain; they swept me along with them, making me\r\nenter by the Carmelite Gate, where they took the flag from me and\r\nallowed me to enter the house of a woman whose name I have never known.\r\nI was spitting such a quantity of blood that she took pity on me and\r\nbrought me everything she could think of as likely to do me good, and as\r\nsoon as I was a little revived I asked to be shown the way to M.\r\nPonthier’s.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Abbe de Belmont was carrying the red flag the militia forced the\r\nTown Councillors to proclaim martial law. This had just been done when\r\nword was brought that the first red flag had been carried off, so M.\r\nFerrand de Missol got out another, and, followed by a considerable\r\nescort, took the same road as his colleague, Abbe de Belmont. When he\r\narrived at the Calquieres, the red-tufts, who still adorned the ramparts\r\nand towers, began to fire upon the procession, and one of the militia\r\nwas disabled; the escort retreated, but M. Ferrand advanced alone to the\r\nCarmelite Gate, like M. de Belmont, and like him, he too, was taken\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\nHe was brought to the tower, where he found Froment in a fury, declaring\r\nthat the Council had not kept its promise, having sent no relief, and\r\nhaving delayed to give up the citadel to him.\r\n\r\nThe escort, however, had only retreated in order to seek help; they\r\nrushed tumultuously to the barracks, and finding the regiment of Guienne\r\ndrawn up in marching order in command of Lieutenant-Colonel Bonne, they\r\nasked him to follow them, but he refused without a written order from a\r\nTown Councillor. Upon this an old corporal shouted, \"Brave soldiers of\r\nGuienne! the country is in danger, let us not delay to do our duty.\"\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" cried the soldiers; \"let us march\" The lieutenant colonel no\r\nlonger daring to resist, gave the word of command, and they set off for\r\nthe Esplanade.\r\n\r\nAs they came near the rampart with drums beating, the firing ceased, but\r\nas night was coming on the new-comers did not dare to risk attacking,\r\nand moreover the silence of the guns led them to think that the rebels\r\nhad given up their enterprise. Having remained an hour in the square,\r\nthe troops returned to their quarters, and the patriots went to pass the\r\nnight in an inclosure on the Montpellier road.\r\n\r\nIt almost seemed as if the Catholics were beginning to recognise the\r\nfutility of their plot; for although they had appealed to fanaticism,\r\nforced the Town Council to do their will, scattered gold lavishly and\r\nmade wine flow, out of eighteen companies only three had joined them.\r\n\"Fifteen companies,\" said M. Alquier in his report to the National\r\nAssembly, \"although they had adopted the red tuft, took no part in the\r\nstruggle, and did not add to the number of crimes committed either on\r\nthat day or during the days that followed. But although the Catholics\r\ngained few partisans among their fellow-citizens, they felt certain that\r\npeople from the country would rally to their aid; but about ten o’clock\r\nin the evening the rebel ringleaders, seeing that no help arrived from\r\nthat quarter either, resolved to apply a stimulus to those without.\r\nConsequently, Froment wrote the following letter to M. de Bonzols,\r\nunder-commandant of the province of Languedoc, who was living at Lunel:\r\n\r\n\"SIR, Up to the present all my demands, that the Catholic companies\r\nshould be put under arms, have been of no avail. In spite of the order\r\nthat you gave at my request, the officials of the municipality were of\r\nopinion that it would be more prudent to delay the distribution of the\r\nmuskets until after the meeting of the Electoral Assembly. This day the\r\nProtestant dragoons have attacked and killed several of our unarmed\r\nCatholics, and you may imagine the confusion and alarm that prevail in\r\nthe town. As a good citizen and a true patriot, I entreat you to send an\r\norder to the regiment of royal dragoons to repair at once to Nimes to\r\nrestore tranquillity and put down all who break the peace. The Town\r\nCouncil does not meet, none of them dares to leave his house; and if you\r\nreceive no requisition from them just now, it is because they go in\r\nterror of their lives and fear to appear openly. Two red flags have been\r\ncarried about the streets, and municipal officers without guards have\r\nbeen obliged to take refuge in patriotic houses. Although I am only a\r\nprivate citizen, I take the liberty of asking for aid from you, knowing\r\nthat the Protestants have sent to La Vannage and La Gardonninque to ask\r\nyou for reinforcements, and the arrival of fanatics from these districts\r\nwould expose all good patriots to slaughter. Knowing as I do of your\r\nkindness and justice, I have full trust that my prayer will receive your\r\nfavourable attention.\r\n\r\n\"FROMENT, Captain of Company No. 39\r\n\r\n\"June 13, 1790, 11 o’c. p.m.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the Catholic party, Dupre and Lieutaud, to whom this\r\nletter was entrusted for delivery, and for whom passports were made out\r\nas being employed on business connected with the king and the State,\r\nwere arrested at Vehaud, and their despatches laid before the Electoral\r\nAssembly. Many other letters of the same kind were also intercepted, and\r\nthe red-tufts went about the town saying that the Catholics of Nimes\r\nwere being massacred.\r\n\r\nThe priest of Courbessac, among others, was shown a letter saying that a\r\nCapuchin monk had been murdered, and that the Catholics were in need of\r\nhelp. The agents who brought this letter to him wanted him to put his\r\nname to it that they might show it everywhere, but were met by a\r\npositive refusal.\r\n\r\nAt Bouillargues and Manduel the tocsin was sounded: the two villages\r\njoined forces, and with weapons in their hands marched along the road\r\nfrom Beaucaire to Nimes. At the bridge of Quart the villagers of\r\nRedressan and Marguerite joined them. Thus reinforced, they were able to\r\nbar the way to all who passed and subject them to examination; if a man\r\ncould show he was a Catholic, he was allowed to proceed, but the\r\nProtestants were murdered then and there. We may remind our readers that\r\nthe \"Cadets de la Croix\" pursued the same method in 1704.\r\n\r\nMeantime Descombiez, Froment, and Folacher remained masters of the\r\nramparts and the tower, and when very early one morning their forces\r\nwere augmented by the insurgents from the villages (about two hundred\r\nmen), they took advantage of their strength to force a way into the\r\nhouse of a certain Therond, from which it was easy to effect an entrance\r\nto the Jacobin monastery, and from there to the tower adjoining, so that\r\ntheir line now extended from the gate at the bridge of Calquieres to\r\nthat at the end of College Street. From daylight to dusk all the\r\npatriots who came within range were fired at whether they were armed or\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th June, at four o’clock in the morning, that part of the\r\nlegion which was against the Catholics gathered together in the square\r\nof the Esplanade, where they were joined by the patriots from the\r\nadjacent towns and villages, who came in in small parties till they\r\nformed quite an army. At five A.M. M. de St. Pons, knowing that the\r\nwindows of the Capuchin monastery commanded the position taken up by the\r\npatriots, went there with a company and searched the house thoroughly,\r\nand also the Amphitheatre, but found nothing suspicious in either.\r\n\r\nImmediately after, news was heard of the massacres that had taken place\r\nduring the night.\r\n\r\nThe country-house belonging to M. and Mme. Noguies had been broken into,\r\nthe furniture destroyed, the owners killed in their beds, and an old man\r\nof seventy who lived with them cut to pieces with a scythe.\r\n\r\nA young fellow of fifteen, named Payre, in passing near the guard placed\r\nat the Pont des files, had been asked by a red-tuft if he were Catholic\r\nor Protestant. On his replying he was Protestant, he was shot dead on\r\nthe spot. \"That was like killing a lamb,\" said a comrade to the\r\nmurderer. \"Pooh!\" said he, \"I have taken a vow to kill four Protestants,\r\nand he may pass for one.\"\r\n\r\n  M. Maigre, an old man of eighty-two, head of one of the most respected\r\n     families in the neighbourhood, tried to escape from his house along\r\n     with his son, his daughter-in-law, two grandchildren, and two\r\n     servants; but the carriage was stopped, and while the rebels were\r\n     murdering him and his son, the mother and her two children\r\n     succeeded in escaping to an inn, whither the assassins pursued\r\n     them, Fortunately, however, the two fugitives having a start,\r\n     reached the inn a few minutes before their pursuers, and the\r\n     innkeeper had enough presence of mind to conceal them and open the\r\n     garden gate by which he said they had escaped. The Catholics,\r\n     believing him, scattered over the country to look for them, and\r\n     during their absence the mother and children were rescued by the\r\n     mounted patrol.\r\n\r\nThe exasperation of the Protestants rose higher and higher as reports of\r\nthese murders came in one by one, till at last the desire for vengeance\r\ncould no longer be repressed, and they were clamorously insisting on\r\nbeing led against the ramparts and the towers, when without warning a\r\nheavy fusillade began from the windows and the clock tower of the\r\nCapuchin monastery. M. Massin, a municipal officer, was killed on the\r\nspot, a sapper fatally wounded, and twenty-five of the National Guard\r\nwounded more or less severely. The Protestants immediately rushed\r\ntowards the monastery in a disorderly mass; but the superior, instead of\r\nordering the gates to be opened, appeared at a window above the\r\nentrance, and addressing the assailants as the vilest of the vile, asked\r\nthem what they wanted at the monastery. \"We want to destroy it, we want\r\nto pull it down till not one stone rests upon another,\" they replied.\r\nUpon this, the reverend father ordered the alarm bells to be rung, and\r\nfrom the mouths of bronze issued the call for help; but before it could\r\narrive, the door was burst in with hatchets, and five Capuchins and\r\nseveral of the militia who wore the red tuft were killed, while all the\r\nother occupants of the monastery ran away, taking refuge in the house of\r\na Protestant called Paulhan. During this attack the church was\r\nrespected; a man from Sornmieres, however, stole a pyx which he found in\r\nthe sacristy, but as soon as his comrades perceived this he was arrested\r\nand sent to prison.\r\n\r\nIn the monastery itself, however, the doors were broken in, the\r\nfurniture smashed, the library and the dispensary wrecked. The sacristy\r\nitself was not spared, its presses being broken into, its chests\r\ndestroyed, and two monstrances broken; but nothing further was touched.\r\nThe storehouses and the small cloth-factory connected with the monastery\r\nremained intact, like the church.\r\n\r\nBut still the towers held out, and it was round them that the real\r\nfighting took place, the resistance offered from within being all the\r\nmore obstinate that the besieged expected relief from moment to moment,\r\nnot knowing that their letters had been intercepted by the enemy. On\r\nevery side the rattling of shot was heard, from the Esplanade, from the\r\nwindows, from the roofs; but very little effect was produced by the\r\nProtestants, for Descombiez had told his men to put their caps with the\r\nred tufts on the top of the wall, to attract the bullets, while they\r\nfired from the side. Meantime the conspirators, in order to get a better\r\ncommand of the besiegers, reopened a passage which had been long walled\r\nup between the tower Du Poids and the tower of the Dominicans.\r\nDescombiez, accompanied by thirty men, came to the door of the monastery\r\nnearest the fortifications and demanded the key of another door which\r\nled to that part of the ramparts which was opposite the place des\r\nCarmes, where the National Guards were stationed. In spite of the\r\nremonstrances of the monks, who saw that it would expose them to great\r\ndanger, the doors were opened, and Froment hastened to occupy every post\r\nof vantage, and the battle began in that quarter, too, becoming fiercer\r\nas the conspirators remarked that every minute brought the Protestants\r\nreinforcements from Gardonninque and La Vaunage. The firing began at ten\r\no’clock in the morning, and at four o’clock in the afternoon it was\r\ngoing on with unabated fury.\r\n\r\nAt four o’clock, however, a servant carrying a flag of truce appeared;\r\nhe brought a letter from Descombiez, Fremont, and Folacher, who styled\r\nthemselves \"Captains commanding the towers of the Castle.\" It was\r\ncouched in the following words:—\r\n\r\n\"To the Commandant of the troops of the line, with the request that the\r\ncontents be communicated to the militia stationed in the Esplanade.\r\n\r\n\"SIR,—We have just been informed that you are anxious for peace. We also\r\ndesire it, and have never done anything to break it. If those who have\r\ncaused the frightful confusion which at present prevails in the city are\r\nwilling to bring it to an end, we offer to forget the past and to live\r\nwith them as brothers.\r\n\r\n\"We remain, with all the frankness and loyalty of patriots and\r\nFrenchmen, your humble servants,\r\n\r\n\"The Captains of the Legion of Nimes, in command of the towers of the\r\nCastle,\r\n\r\n\"FROMENT, DESCOMBIEZ, FOLACHER NIMES, the 14th June 1790, 4.00 P.M.\"\r\n\r\nOn the receipt of this letter, the city herald was sent to the towers to\r\noffer the rebels terms of capitulation. The three \"captains in command\"\r\ncame out to discuss the terms with the commissioners of the electoral\r\nbody; they were armed and followed by a great number of adherents.\r\nHowever, as the negotiators desired peace before all things, they\r\nproposed that the three chiefs should surrender and place themselves in\r\nthe hands of the Electoral Assembly. This offer being refused, the\r\nelectoral commissioners withdrew, and the rebels retired behind their\r\nfortifications. About five o’clock in the evening, just as the\r\nnegotiations were broken off, M. Aubry, an artillery captain who had\r\nbeen sent with two hundred men to the depot of field artillery in the\r\ncountry, returned with six pieces of ordnance, determined to make a\r\nbreach in the tower occupied by the conspirators, and from which they\r\nwere firing in safety at the soldiers, who had no cover. At six o’clock,\r\nthe guns being mounted, their thunder began, first drowning the noise of\r\nthe musketry and then silencing it altogether; for the cannon balls did\r\ntheir work quickly, and before long the tower threatened to fall.\r\nThereupon the electoral commissioners ordered the firing to cease for a\r\nmoment, in the hope that now the danger had become so imminent the\r\nleaders would accept the conditions which they had refused one hour\r\nbefore; and not desiring to drive them to desperation, the commissioners\r\nadvanced again down College Street, preceded by a bugler, and the\r\ncaptains were once more summoned to a parley. Froment and Descombiez\r\ncame out to meet them, and seeing the condition of the tower, they\r\nagreed to lay down their arms and send them for the palace, while they\r\nthemselves would proceed to the Electoral Assembly and place themselves\r\nunder its protection. These proposals being accepted, the commissioners\r\nwaved their hats as a sign that the treaty was concluded.\r\n\r\nAt that instant three shots were fired from the ramparts, and cries of\r\n\"Treachery! treachery!\" were heard on every side. The Catholic chiefs\r\nreturned to the tower, while the Protestants, believing that the\r\ncommissioners were being assassinated, reopened the cannonade; but\r\nfinding that it took too long to complete the breach, ladders were\r\nbrought, the walls scaled, and the towers carried by assault. Some of\r\nthe Catholics were killed, the others gained Froment’s house, where,\r\nencouraged by him, they tried to organise a resistance; but the\r\nassailants, despite the oncoming darkness, attacked the place with such\r\nfury that doors and windows were shattered in an instant. Froment and\r\nhis brother Pierre tried to escape by a narrow staircase which led to\r\nthe roof, but before they reached it Pierre was wounded in the hip and\r\nfell; but Froment reached the roof, and sprang upon an adjacent\r\nhousetop, and climbing from roof to roof, reached the college, and\r\ngetting into it by a garret window, took refuge in a large room which\r\nwas always unoccupied at night, being used during the day as a study.\r\n\r\nFroment remained hidden there until eleven o’clock. It being then\r\ncompletely dark, he got out of the window, crossed the city, gained the\r\nopen country, and walking all night, concealed himself during the day in\r\nthe house of a Catholic. The next night he set off again, and reached\r\nthe coast, where he embarked on board a vessel for Italy, in order to\r\nreport to those who had sent him the disastrous result of his\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nFor three whole days the carnage lasted. The Protestants losing all\r\ncontrol over themselves, carried on the work of death not only without\r\npity but with refined cruelty. More than five hundred Catholics lost\r\ntheir lives before the 17th, when peace was restored.\r\n\r\nFor a long time recriminations went on between Catholics and\r\nProtestants, each party trying to fix on the other the responsibility\r\nfor those dreadful three days; but at last Franqois Froment put an end\r\nto all doubt on the subject, by publishing a work from which are set\r\nforth many of the details just laid before our readers, as well as the\r\nreward he met with when he reached Turin. At a meeting of the French\r\nnobles in exile, a resolution was passed in favour of M. Pierre Froment\r\nand his children, inhabitants of Nimes.\r\n\r\nWe give a literal reproduction of this historic document:\r\n\r\n\"We the undersigned, French nobles, being convinced that our Order was\r\ninstituted that it might become the prize of valour and the\r\nencouragement of virtue, do declare that the Chevalier de Guer having\r\ngiven us proof of the devotion to their king and the love of their\r\ncountry which have been displayed by M. Pierre Froment, receiver of the\r\nclergy, and his three sons, Mathieu Froment citizen, Jacques Froment\r\ncanon, Francois Froment advocate, inhabitants of Nimes, we shall\r\nhenceforward regard them and their descendants as nobles and worthy to\r\nenjoy all the distinctions which belong to the true nobility. Brave\r\ncitizens, who perform such distinguished actions as fighting for the\r\nrestoration of the monarchy, ought to be considered as the equals of\r\nthose French chevaliers whose ancestors helped to found it. Furthermore,\r\nwe do declare that as soon as circumstances permit we shall join\r\ntogether to petition His Majesty to grant to this family, so illustrious\r\nthrough its virtue, all the honours and prerogatives which belong to\r\nthose born noble.\r\n\r\n\"We depute the Marquis de Meran, Comte d’Espinchal, the Marquis\r\nd’Escars, Vicomte de Pons, Chevalier de Guer, and the Marquis de la\r\nFeronniere to go to Mgr. le Comte d’Artois, Mgr. le Duc d’Angouleme,\r\nMgr. le Duc de Berry, Mgr. le Prince de Conde, Mgr. le Due de Bourbon,\r\nand Mgr. le Duc d’Enghien, to beg them to put themselves at our head\r\nwhen we request His Majesty to grant to MM. Froment all the distinctions\r\nand advantages reserved for the true nobility.\r\n\r\n\"At TURIN, 12th September 1790.\"\r\n\r\nThe nobility of Languedoc learned of the honours conferred on their\r\ncountryman, M. Froment, and addressed the following letter to him:\r\n\r\n\"LORCH, July 7, 1792\r\n\r\n\"MONSIEUR, The nobles of Languedoc hasten to confirm the resolution\r\nadopted in your favour by the nobles assembled at Turin. They appreciate\r\nthe zeal and the courage which have distinguished your conduct and that\r\nof your family; they have therefore instructed us to assure you of the\r\npleasure with which they will welcome you among those nobles who are\r\nunder the orders of Marshal de Castries, and that you are at liberty to\r\nrepair to Lorch to assume your proper rank in one of the companies.\r\n\r\n\"We have the honour to be, monsieur, your humble and obedient servants,\r\n\r\n\"COMTE DE TOULOUSE-LAUTREC\r\n\r\n\"MARQUIS DE LA JONQUIERE \"ETC.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Protestants, as we have said, hailed the golden dawn of the\r\nrevolution with delight; then came the Terror, which struck at all\r\nwithout distinction of creed. A hundred and thirty-eight heads fell on\r\nthe scaffold, condemned by the revolutionary tribunal of the Gard.\r\nNinety-one of those executed were Catholic, and forty-seven Protestants,\r\nso that it looked as if the executioners in their desire for\r\nimpartiality had taken a census of the population.\r\n\r\nThen came the Consulate: the Protestants being mostly tradesmen and\r\nmanufacturers, were therefore richer than the Catholics, and had more to\r\nlose; they seemed to see more chance of stability in this form of\r\ngovernment than in those preceding it, and it was evident that it had a\r\nmore powerful genius at its head, so they rallied round it with\r\nconfidence and sincerity. The Empire followed, with its inclination to\r\nabsolutism, its Continental system, and its increased taxation; and the\r\nProtestants drew back somewhat, for it was towards them who had hoped so\r\nmuch from him that Napoleon in not keeping the promises of Bonaparte was\r\nmost perjured.\r\n\r\nThe first Restoration, therefore, was greeted at Nimes with a universal\r\nshout of joy; and a superficial-observer might have thought that all\r\ntrace of the old religious leaven had disappeared. In fact, for\r\nseventeen years the two faiths had lived side by side in perfect peace\r\nand mutual good-will; for seventeen years men met either for business or\r\nfor social purposes without inquiring about each other’s religion, so\r\nthat Nimes on the surface might have been held up as an example of union\r\nand fraternity.\r\n\r\nWhen Monsieur arrived at Nimes, his guard of honour was drawn from the\r\ncity guard, which still retained its organisation of 1812, being\r\ncomposed of citizens without distinction of creed. Six decorations were\r\nconferred on it—three on Catholics, and three on Protestants. At the\r\nsame time, M. Daunant, M. Olivier Desmonts, and M. de Seine, the first\r\nthe mayor, the second the president of the Consistory, and the third a\r\nmember of the Prefecture, all three belonging to the Reformed religion,\r\nreceived the same favour.\r\n\r\nSuch impartiality on the part of Monsieur almost betrayed a preference,\r\nand this offended the Catholics. They muttered to one another that in\r\nthe past there had been a time when the fathers of those who had just\r\nbeen decorated by the hand of the prince had fought against his faithful\r\nadherents. Hardly had Monsieur left the town, therefore, than it became\r\napparent that perfect harmony no longer existed.\r\n\r\nThe Catholics had a favorite cafe, which during the whole time the\r\nEmpire lasted was also frequented by Protestants without a single\r\ndispute caused by the difference of religion ever arising. But from this\r\ntime forth the Catholics began to hold themselves aloof from the\r\nProtestants; the latter perceiving this, gave up the cafe by degrees to\r\nthe Catholics, being determined to keep the peace whatever it might\r\ncost, and went to a cafe which had been just opened under the sign of\r\nthe \"Isle of Elba.\" The name was enough to cause them to be regarded as\r\nBonapartists, and as to Bonapartists the cry \"Long live the king!\" was\r\nsupposed to be offensive, they were saluted at every turn with these\r\nwords, pronounced in a tone which became every day more menacing. At\r\nfirst they gave back the same cry, \"Long live the king!\" but then they\r\nwere called cowards who expressed with their lips a sentiment which did\r\nnot come from their hearts. Feeling that this accusation had some truth\r\nin it, they were silent, but then they were accused of hating the royal\r\nfamily, till at length the cry which at first had issued from full\r\nhearts in a universal chorus grew to be nothing but an expression of\r\nparty hatred, so that on the 21st February, 1815, M. Daunant the mayor,\r\nby a decree, prohibited the public from using it, as it had become a\r\nmeans of exciting sedition. Party feeling had reached this height at\r\nNimes when, on the 4th March, the news of the landing of Napoleon\r\narrived.\r\n\r\nDeep as was the impression produced, the city remained calm, but\r\nsomewhat sullen; in any case, the report wanted confirmation. Napoleon,\r\nwho knew of the sympathy that the mountaineers felt for him, went at\r\nonce into the Alps, and his eagle did not as yet take so high a flight\r\nthat it could be seen hovering above Mount Geneve.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th, the Duc d’Angouleme arrived: two proclamations calling the\r\ncitizens to arms signalised his presence. The citizens answered the call\r\nwith true Southern ardour: an army was formed; but although Protestants\r\nand Catholics presented themselves for enrolment with equal alacrity,\r\nthe Protestants were excluded, the Catholics denying the right of\r\ndefending their legitimate sovereign to any but themselves.\r\n\r\nThis species of selection apparently went on without the knowledge of\r\nthe Duc d’Angouleme. During his stay in Nimes he received Protestants\r\nand Catholics with equal cordiality, and they sat at his table side by\r\nside. It happened once, on a Friday, at dinner, that a Protestant\r\ngeneral took fish and a Catholic general helped himself to fowl. The\r\nduke being amused, drew attention to this anomaly, whereupon the\r\nCatholic general replied, \"Better more chicken and less treason.\" This\r\nattack was so direct, that although the Protestant general felt that as\r\nfar as he was concerned it had no point, he rose from table and left the\r\nroom. It was the brave General Gilly who was treated in this cruel\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the news became more disastrous every day: Napoleon was moving\r\nabout with the rapidity of his eagles. On the 24th March it was reported\r\nin Nimes that Louis XVIII had left Paris on the 19th and that Napoleon\r\nhad entered on the 20th. This report was traced to its source, and it\r\nwas found that it had been spread abroad by M. Vincent de Saint-Laurent,\r\na councillor of the Prefecture and one of the most respected men in\r\nNimes. He was summoned at once before the authorities and asked whence\r\nhe had this information; he replied, \"From a letter received from M.\r\nBragueres,\" producing the letter. But convincing as was this proof, it\r\navailed him nothing: he was escorted from brigade to brigade till he\r\nreached the Chateau d’If. The Protestants sided with M. Vincent de\r\nSaint-Laurent, the Catholics took the part of the authorities who were\r\npersecuting him, and thus the two factions which had been so long\r\nquiescent found themselves once more face to face, and their dormant\r\nhatred awoke to new life. For the moment, however, there was no\r\nexplosion, although the city was at fever heat, and everyone felt that a\r\ncrisis was at hand.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd March two battalions of Catholic volunteers had already been\r\nenlisted at Nimes, and had formed part of the eighteen hundred men who\r\nwere sent to Saint-Esprit. Just before their departure fleurs-de-lys had\r\nbeen distributed amongst them, made of red cloth; this change in the\r\ncolour of the monarchical emblem was a threat which the Protestants well\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nThe prince left Nimes in due course, taking with him the rest of the\r\nroyal volunteers, and leaving the Protestants practically masters of\r\nNimes during the absence of so many Catholics. The city, however,\r\ncontinued calm, and when provocations began, strange to say they came\r\nfrom the weaker party.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th March six men met in a barn; dined together, and then agreed\r\nto make the circuit of the town. These men were Jacques Dupont, who\r\nlater acquired such terrible celebrity under the name of Trestaillons,\r\nTruphemy the butcher, Morenet the dog shearer, Hours, Servant, and\r\nGilles. They got opposite the cafe \"Isle of Elba,\" the name of which\r\nindicated the opinion of those who frequented it. This cafe was faced by\r\na guard-house which was occupied by soldiers of the 67th Regiment. The\r\nsix made a halt, and in the most insulting tones raised the cry of \"Long\r\nlive the king!\" The disturbance that ensued was so slight that we only\r\nmention it in order to give an idea of the tolerance of the Protestants,\r\nand to bring upon the stage the men mentioned above, who were three\r\nmonths later to play such a terrible part.\r\n\r\nOn April 1st the mayor summoned to a meeting at his official residence\r\nthe municipal council, the members of all the variously constituted\r\nadministrative bodies in Nimes, the officers of the city guards, the\r\npriests, the Protestant pastors, and the chief citizens. At this\r\nmeeting, M. Trinquelague, advocate of the Royal Courts, read a powerful\r\naddress, expressing the love, of the citizens for their king and\r\ncountry, and exhorting them to union and peace. This address was\r\nunanimously adopted and signed by all present, and amongst the\r\nsignatures were those of the principal Protestants of Nimes. But this\r\nwas not all: the next day it was printed and published, and copies sent\r\nto all the communes in the department over which the white flag still\r\nfloated. And all this happened, as we have said, on April and, eleven\r\ndays after Napoleon’s return to Paris.\r\n\r\nThe same day word arrived that the Imperial Government had been\r\nproclaimed at Montpellier.\r\n\r\nThe next day, April 3rd, all the officers on half-pay assembled at the\r\nfountain to be reviewed by a general and a sub-inspector, and as these\r\nofficers were late, the order of the, day issued by General Ambert,\r\nrecognising the Imperial Government, was produced and passed along the\r\nranks, causing such excitement that one of the officers drew his sword\r\nand cried, \"Long live the emperor!\" These magic words were re-echoed\r\nfrom every side, and they all hastened to the barracks of the 63rd\r\nRegiment, which at once joined the officers. At this juncture Marshal\r\nPelissier arrived, and did not appear to welcome the turn things had\r\ntaken; he made an effort to restrain the enthusiasm of the crowd, but\r\nwas immediately arrested by his own soldiers. The officers repaired in a\r\nbody to the headquarters of General Briche, commandant of the garrison,\r\nand asked for the official copy of the order of the day. He replied that\r\nhe had received none, and when questioned as to which side he was on he\r\nrefused to answer. The officers upon this took him prisoner. Just as\r\nthey had consigned him to the barracks for confinement, a post-office\r\nofficial arrived bringing a despatch from General Ambert. Learning that\r\nGeneral Briche was a prisoner, the messenger carried his packet to the\r\ncolonel of the 63rd Regiment, who was the next in seniority after the\r\ngeneral. In opening it, it was found to contain the order of the day.\r\n\r\nInstantly the colonel ordered the ’gineyale’ to sound: the town guards\r\nassumed arms, the troops left the barracks and formed in line, the\r\nNational Guards in the rear of the regular troops, and when they were\r\nall thus drawn up; the order of the day was read; it was then snatched\r\nout of the colonel’s hands, printed on large placards, and in less time\r\nthan seemed possible it was posted up in every street and at every\r\nstreet corner; the tricolour replaced the white cockade, everyone being\r\nobliged to wear the national emblem or none at all, the city was\r\nproclaimed in a state of seige, and the military officers formed a\r\nvigilance committee and a police force.\r\n\r\nWhile the Duc d’Angouleme had been staying at Nimes, General Gilly had\r\napplied for a command in that prince’s army, but in spite of all his\r\nefforts obtained nothing; so immediately after the dinner at which he\r\nwas insulted he had withdrawn to Avernede, his place in the country. He\r\nwas awoke in the night of the 5th-6th April by a courier from General\r\nAmbert, who sent to offer him the command of the 2nd Subdivision. On the\r\n6th, General Gilly went to Nimes, and sent in his acceptance, whereby\r\nthe departments of the Gard, the Lozere, and Ardeche passed under his\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nNext day General Gilly received further despatches from General Ambert,\r\nfrom which he learned that it was the general’s intention, in order to\r\navoid the danger of a civil war, to separate the Duc d’Angouleme’s army\r\nfrom the departments which sympathised with the royal cause; he had\r\ntherefore decided to make Pont-Saint-Esprit a military post, and had\r\nordered the 10th Regiment of mounted chasseurs, the 13th artillery, and\r\na battalion of infantry to move towards this point by forced marches.\r\nThese troops were commanded by Colonel Saint-Laurent, but General Ambert\r\nwas anxious that if it could be done without danger, General Gilly\r\nshould leave Nimes, taking with him part of the 63rd Regiment, and\r\njoining the other forces under the command of Colonel Saint-Laurent,\r\nshould assume the chief command. As the city was quite tranquil, General\r\nGilly did not hesitate to obey this order: he set out from Nimes on the\r\n7th, passed the night at Uzes, and finding that town abandoned by the\r\nmagistrates, declared it in a state of siege, lest disturbances should\r\narise in the absence of authority. Having placed M. de Bresson in\r\ncommand, a retired chief of battalion who was born in Uzes, and who\r\nusually lived there, he continued his march on the morning of the 8th.\r\n\r\nBeyond the village of Conans, General Gilly met an orderly sent to him\r\nby Colonel Saint-Laurent to inform him that he, the colonel, had\r\noccupied Pont Saint-Esprit, and that the Duc d’Angouleme, finding\r\nhimself thus caught between two fires, had just sent General d’Aultanne,\r\nchief of staff in the royal army, to him, to enter into negotiations for\r\na surrender. Upon this, General Gilly quickened his advance, and on\r\nreaching Pont-Saint-Esprit found General d’Aultanne and Colonel\r\nSaint-Laurent conferring together at the Hotel de la Poste.\r\n\r\nAs Colonel Saint-Laurent had received his instructions directly from the\r\ncommander-in-chief, several points relating to the capitulation had\r\nalready been agreed upon; of these General Gilly slightly altered some,\r\nand approved of the others, and the same day the following convention\r\nwas signed:\r\n\r\n\"Convention concluded between General Gilly and Baron de Damas\r\n\r\n\"S.A.R. Mgr. le Duc d’Angouleme, Commander-in-Chief of the royal army in\r\nthe South, and Baron de Gilly, General of Division and\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the first corps of the Imperial Army, being most\r\nanxiously desirous to prevent any further effusion of French blood, have\r\ngiven plenary powers to arrange the terms of a convention to S.A.R. M.\r\nle Baron de Damas, Field-Marshal and Under-Chief of Staff, and General\r\nde Gilly and Adjutant Lefevre, Chevalier of the Legion of Honour, and\r\nChief of the Staff of the first Army Corps; who, having shown each other\r\ntheir respective credentials, have agreed on the following terms:—\r\n\r\n\"Art. 1. The royal army is to be disbanded; and the National Guards\r\nwhich are enrolled in it, under whatever name they may have been levied,\r\nwill return to their homes, after laying down their arms. Safe conducts\r\nwill be provided, and the general of division commanding-in-chief\r\nguarantees that they shall never be molested for anything they may have\r\nsaid or done in connection with the events preceding the present\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\n\"The officers will retain their swords; the troops of the line who form\r\npart of this army will repair to such garrisons as may be assigned to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"Art. 2. The general officers, superior staff officers and others of all\r\nbranches of the service, and the chiefs and subordinates of the\r\nadministrative departments, of whose names a list will be furnished to\r\nthe general-in-chief, will retire to their homes and there await the\r\norders of His Majesty the Emperor.\r\n\r\n\"Art. 3. Officers of every rank who wish to resign their commissions are\r\ncompetent to do so. They will receive passports for their homes.\r\n\r\n\"Art. 4. The funds of the army and the lists of the paymaster-general\r\nwill be handed over at once to commissioners appointed for that purpose\r\nby the commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\n\"Art. 5. The above articles apply to the corps commanded by Mgr. le Duc\r\nd’Angouleme in person, and also to those who act separately but under\r\nhis orders, and as forming part of the royal army of the South.\r\n\r\n\"Art. 6. H.R.H. will post to Cette, where the vessels necessary for him\r\nand his suite will be waiting to take him wherever he may desire.\r\nDetachments of the Imperial Army will be placed at all the relays on the\r\nroad to protect His Royal Highness during the journey, and the honours\r\ndue to his rank will be everywhere paid him, if he so desire.\r\n\r\n\"Art. 7. All the officers and other persons of His Royal Highness’ suite\r\nwho desire to follow him will be permitted to do so, and they may either\r\nembark with him at once or later, should their private affairs need time\r\nfor arrangement.\r\n\r\n\"Art. 8. The present treaty will be kept secret until His Royal Highness\r\nhave quitted the limits of the empire.\r\n\r\n\"Executed in duplicate and agreed upon between the above-mentioned\r\nplenipotentiaries the 8th day of April in the year 1815, with the\r\napproval of the general commanding-in-chief, and signed,\r\n\r\n\"At the headquarters at Pont-Saint-Esprit on the day and year above\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\n\"(Signed) LEFEVRE Adjutant and Chief of Staff of the First Corps of the\r\nImperial Army of the South\r\n\r\n\"(Signed) BARON DE DAMAS Field-Marshal and Under-Chief of Staff\r\n\r\n\"The present convention is approved of by the General of Division\r\nCommanding-in-Chief the Imperial Army of the South.\r\n\r\n\"(Signed) GILLY\"\r\n\r\nAfter some discussion between General Gilly and General Grouchy, the\r\ncapitulation was carried into effect. On the 16th April, at eight\r\no’clock in the morning, the Duc d’Angouleme arrived at Cette, and went\r\non board the Swedish vessel Scandinavia, which, taking advantage of a\r\nfavourable wind, set sail the same day.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning of the 9th an officer of high rank had been sent to\r\nLa Palud to issue safe-conducts to the troops, who according to Article\r\nI of the capitulation were to return home \"after laying down their\r\narms.\" But during the preceding day and night some of the royal\r\nvolunteers had evaded this article by withdrawing with their arms and\r\nbaggage. As this infraction of the terms led to serious consequences, we\r\npropose, in order to establish the fact, to cite the depositions of\r\nthree royal volunteers who afterwards gave evidence.\r\n\r\n\"On leaving the army of the Duc d’Angouleme after the capitulation,\"\r\nsays Jean Saunier, \"I went with my officers and my corps to\r\nSaint-Jean-des-Anels. From there we marched towards Uzes. In the middle\r\nof a forest, near a village, the name of which I have forgotten, our\r\nGeneral M. de Vogue told us that we were all to return to our own homes.\r\nWe asked him where we should deposit the flag. Just then Commandant\r\nMagne detached it from the staff and put it in his pocket. We then asked\r\nthe general where we should deposit our arms; he replied, that we had\r\nbetter keep them, as we should probably find use for them before long,\r\nand also to take our ammunition with us, to ensure our safety on the\r\nroad.\r\n\r\n\"From that time on we all did what we thought best: sixty-four of us\r\nremained together, and took a guide to enable us to avoid Uzes.\"\r\n\r\nNicholas Marie, labourer, deposed as follows:\r\n\r\n\"On leaving the army of the Duc d’Angouleme after the capitulation, I\r\nwent with my officers and my corps to Saint-Jean-des-Anels. We marched\r\ntowards Uzes, but when we were in the middle of a forest, near a village\r\nthe name of which I have forgotten, our general, M. de Vogue, told us\r\nthat we were to go to our own homes as soon as we liked. We saw\r\nCommandant Magne loose the flag from its staff, roll it up and put it in\r\nhis pocket. We asked the general what we were to do with our arms; he\r\nreplied that we were to keep both them and our ammunition, as we should\r\nfind them of use. Upon this, our chiefs left us, and we all got away as\r\nbest we could.\"\r\n\r\n\"After the capitulation of the Duc d’Angouleme I found myself,\" deposes\r\nPaul Lambert, lace-maker of Nimes, \"in one of several detachments under\r\nthe orders of Commandant Magne and General Vogue. In the middle of a\r\nforest near a village, the name of which I do not know, M. de Vogue and\r\nthe other officer, told us we might go home. The flag was folded up, and\r\nM. Magne put it in his pocket. We asked our chiefs what we were to do\r\nwith our arms. M. de Vogue told us that we had better keep them, as we\r\nshould need them before very long; and in any case it would be well to\r\nhave them with us on the road, lest anything should happen to us.\"\r\n\r\nThe three depositions are too much alike to leave room for any doubt.\r\nThe royal volunteers contravened Article I of the convention.\r\n\r\nBeing thus abandoned by their chiefs, without general and without flag,\r\nM. de Vogue’s soldiers asked no further counsel of anyone but\r\nthemselves, and, as one of them has already told us, sixty-four of them\r\njoined together to hire a guide who was to show them how to get by Uzes\r\nwithout going through it, for they were afraid of meeting with insult\r\nthere. The guide brought them as far as Montarem without anyone opposing\r\ntheir passage or taking notice of their arms.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a coachman named Bertrand, a confidential servant of Abbe\r\nRafin, former Grand-Vicar of Alais, and of Baroness Arnaud-Wurmeser (for\r\nthe abbe administered the estate of Aureillac in his own name and that\r\nof the baroness), galloped into the village of Arpaillargues, which was\r\nalmost entirely Protestant and consequently Napoleonist, announcing that\r\nthe miquelets (for after one hundred and ten years the old name given to\r\nthe royal troops was revived) were on the way from Montarem, pillaging\r\nhouses, murdering magistrates, outraging women, and then throwing them\r\nout of the windows. It is easy to understand the effect of such a story.\r\nThe people gathered together in groups; the mayor and his assistant\r\nbeing absent, Bertrand was taken before a certain Boucarut, who on\r\nreceiving his report ordered the generale to be beaten and the tocsin to\r\nbe rung. Then the consternation became general: the men seized their\r\nmuskets, the women and children stones and pitchforks, and everyone made\r\nready to face a danger which only existed in the imagination of\r\nBertrand, for there was not a shadow of foundation for the story he had\r\ntold.\r\n\r\nWhile the village was in this state of feverish excitement the royal\r\nvolunteers came in sight. Hardly were they seen than the cry, \"There\r\nthey are! There they are!\" arose on all sides, the streets were\r\nbarricaded with carts, the tocsin rang out with redoubled frenzy, and\r\neveryone capable of carrying arms rushed to the entrance of the village.\r\n\r\nThe volunteers, hearing the uproar and seeing the hostile preparations,\r\nhalted, and to show that their intentions were peaceful, put their\r\nshakos on their musket stocks and waved them above their heads, shouting\r\nthat no one need fear, for they would do no harm to anyone. But alarmed\r\nas they were by the terrible stories told by Bertrand, the villagers\r\nshouted back that they could not trust to such assurances, and that if\r\nthey wanted to pass through the village they must first give up their\r\nweapons. It may easily be imagined that men who had broken the\r\nconvention in order to keep their weapons were not likely to give them\r\nup to these villagers—in fact, they obstinately refused to let them out\r\nof their hands, and by doing so increased the suspicions of the people.\r\nA parley of a very excited character took place between M. Fournier for\r\nthe royal guards and M. Boucarut, who was chosen spokesman by the\r\nvillagers. From words they came to deeds: the miquelets tried to force\r\ntheir way through, some shots were fired, and two miquelets, Calvet and\r\nFournier, fell. The others scattered, followed by a lively discharge,\r\nand two more miquelets were slightly wounded. Thereupon they all took to\r\nflight through the fields on either side of the road, pursued for a\r\nshort distance by the villagers, but soon returned to examine the two\r\nwounded men, and a report was drawn up by Antoine Robin, advocate and\r\nmagistrate of the canton of Uzes, of the events just related.\r\n\r\nThis accident was almost the only one of its kind which happened during\r\nthe Hundred Days: the two parties remained face to face, threatening but\r\nself-controlled. But let there be no mistake: there was no peace; they\r\nwere simply awaiting a declaration of war. When the calm was broken, it\r\nwas from Marseilles that the provocation came. We shall efface ourselves\r\nfor a time and let an eye-witness speak, who being a Catholic cannot be\r\nsuspected of partiality for the Protestants.\r\n\r\n\"I was living in Marseilles at the time of Napoleon’s landing, and I was\r\na witness of the impression which the news produced upon everyone. There\r\nwas one great cry; the enthusiasm was universal; the National Guard\r\nwanted to join him to the last man, but Marshal Massena did not give his\r\nconsent until it was too late, for Napoleon had already reached the\r\nmountains, and was moving with such swiftness that it would have been\r\nimpossible to overtake him. Next we heard of his triumphal entry into\r\nLyons, and of his arrival in Paris during the night. Marseilles\r\nsubmitted like the rest of France; Prince d’Essling was recalled to the\r\ncapital, and Marshal Brune, who commanded the 6th corps of observation,\r\nfixed his headquarters at Marseilles.\r\n\r\n\"With quite incomprehensible fickleness, Marseilles, whose name during\r\nthe Terror had been, as one may say, the symbol of the most advanced\r\nopinions, had become almost entirely Royalist in 1815. Nevertheless, its\r\ninhabitants saw without a murmur the tricolour flag after a year’s\r\nabsence floating once more above the walls. No arbitrary interference on\r\nthe part of the authorities, no threats, and no brawling between the\r\ncitizens and the soldiers, troubled the peace of old Phocea; no\r\nrevolution ever took place with such quietness and facility.\r\n\r\n\"It must, however, be said, that Marshal Brune was just the man to\r\naccomplish such a transformation without friction; in him the frankness\r\nand loyalty of an old soldier were combined with other qualities more\r\nsolid than brilliant. Tacitus in hand, he looked on at modern\r\nrevolutions as they passed, and only interfered when the, voice of his\r\ncountry called him to her defence. The conqueror of Harlem and Bakkun\r\nhad been for four years forgotten in retirement, or rather in exile,\r\nwhen the same voice which sent him away recalled him, and at the summons\r\nCincinnatus left his plough and grasped his weapons. Physically he was\r\nat this period a man of about fifty-five, with a frank and open face\r\nframed by large whiskers; his head was bald except for a little grizzled\r\nhair at the temples; he was tall and active, and had a remarkably\r\nsoldierly bearing.\r\n\r\n\"I had been brought into contact with him by a report which one of my\r\nfriends and I had drawn up on the opinions of the people of the South,\r\nand of which he had asked to have a copy. In a long conversation with\r\nus, he discussed the subject with the impartiality of a man who brings\r\nan open mind to a debate, and he invited us to come often to see him. We\r\nenjoyed ourselves so much in his society that we got into the habit of\r\ngoing to his house nearly every evening.\r\n\r\n\"On his arrival in the South an old calumny which had formerly pursued\r\nhim again made its appearance, quite rejuvenated by its long sleep. A\r\nwriter whose name I have forgotten, in describing the Massacres of the\r\nSecond of September and the death of the unfortunate Princesse de\r\nLamballe, had said, ’Some people thought they recognised in the man who\r\ncarried her head impaled on a pike, General Brune in disguise,’ and this\r\naccusation; which had been caught up with eagerness under the Consulate,\r\nstill followed him so relentlessly in 1815, that hardly a day passed\r\nwithout his receiving an anonymous letter, threatening him with the same\r\nfate which had overtaken the princess. One evening while we were with\r\nhim such a letter arrived, and having read it he passed it on to us. It\r\nwas as follows:\r\n\r\n\"’Wretch,—We are acquainted with all your crimes, for which you will\r\nsoon receive the chastisement you well deserve. It was you who during\r\nthe revolution brought about the death of the Princesse de Lamballe; it\r\nwas you who carried her head on a pike, but your head will be impaled on\r\nsomething longer. If you are so rash as to be present at the review of\r\nthe Allies it is all up with you, and your head will be stuck on the\r\nsteeple of the Accoules. Farewell, SCOUNDREL!’\r\n\r\n\"We advised him to trace this calumny to its source, and then to take\r\nsignal vengeance on the authors. He paused an instant to reflect, and\r\nthen lit the letter at a candle, and looking at it thoughtfully as it\r\nturned to ashes in his hand, said,—Vengeance! Yes, perhaps by seeking\r\nthat I could silence the authors of these slanders and preserve the\r\npublic tranquillity which they constantly imperil. But I prefer\r\npersuasion to severity. My principle is, that it is better to bring\r\nmen’s heads back to a right way of thinking than to cut them off, and to\r\nbe regarded as a weak man rather than as a bloodthirsty one.’\r\n\r\n\"The essence of Marshal Brune’s character was contained in these words.\r\n\r\n\"Public tranquillity was indeed twice endangered at Marseilles during\r\nthe Hundred Days, and both times in the same manner. The garrison\r\nofficers used to gather at a coffee-house in the place Necker, and sing\r\nsongs suggested by passing events. This caused an attack by the\r\ntownspeople, who broke the windows by throwing stones, some of which\r\nstruck the officers. These rushed out, crying, ’To arms!’ The\r\ntownspeople were not slow to respond, but the commandant ordered the\r\n’geneydle’ to beat, sent out numerous patrols, and succeeded in calming\r\nthe excitement and restoring quietness without any casualties.\r\n\r\n\"The day of the Champ du Mai orders for a general illumination were\r\ngiven, and that the tricolour flag should be displayed from the windows.\r\nThe greater number of the inhabitants paid no attention to the desires\r\nof the authorities, and the officers being annoyed at this neglect,\r\nindulged in reprehensible excesses, which, however, resulted in nothing\r\nmore serious than some broken windows belonging to houses which had not\r\nilluminated, and in some of the householders being forced to illuminate\r\naccording to order.\r\n\r\n\"In Marseilles as in the rest of France, people began to despair of the\r\nsuccess of the royal cause, and those who represented this cause, who\r\nwere very numerous at Marseilles, gave up annoying the military and\r\nseemed to resign themselves to their fate. Marshal Brune had left the\r\ncity to take up his post on the frontier, without any of the dangers\r\nwith which he was threatened having come across his path.\r\n\r\n\"The 25th of June arrived, and the news of the successes obtained at\r\nFleurus and at Ligny seemed to justify the hopes of the soldiers, when,\r\nin the middle of the day, muttered reports began to spread in the town,\r\nthe distant reverberations of the cannon of Waterloo. The silence of the\r\nleaders, the uneasiness of the soldiers, the delight of the Royalists,\r\nforetold the outbreak of a new struggle, the, results of which it was\r\neasy to anticipate. About four o’clock in the afternoon, a man, who had\r\nprobably got earlier information than his fellow-townspeople, tore off\r\nhis tricoloured cockade and trampled it under foot, crying, \"Long live\r\nthe king!\" The angry soldiers seized him and were about to drag him to\r\nthe guard-house, but the National Guards prevented them, and their\r\ninterference led to a fight. Shouts were heard on all sides, a large\r\nring was formed round the soldiers, a few musket shots heard, others\r\nanswered, three or four men fell, and lay there weltering in their\r\nblood. Out of this confused uproar the word \"Waterloo\" emerged distinct;\r\nand with this unfamiliar name pronounced for the first time in the\r\nresounding voice of history, the news of the defeat of the French army\r\nand the triumph of the Allies spread apace. Then General Verdier, who\r\nheld the chief command in the absence of Marshal Brune, tried to\r\nharangue the people, but his voice was drowned by the shouts of the mob\r\nwho had gathered round a coffee-house where stood a bust of the emperor,\r\nwhich they insisted should be given up to them. Verdier, hoping to calm,\r\nwhat he took to be a simple street row, gave orders that the bust should\r\nbe brought out, and this concession, so significant on the part of a\r\ngeneral commanding in the emperor’s name, convinced the crowd that his\r\ncause was lost. The fury of the populace grew greater now that they felt\r\nthat they could indulge it with impunity; they ran to the Town Hall, and\r\ntearing down and burning the tricoloured, raised the white flag. The\r\nroll of the generale, the clang of the tocsin were heard, the\r\nneighbouring villages poured in their populations and increased the\r\nthrong in the streets; single acts of violence began to occur, wholesale\r\nmassacres were approaching. I had arrived in the town with my friend\r\nM____ the very beginning of the tumult, so we had seen the dangerous\r\nagitation and excitement grow under our eyes, but we were still ignorant\r\nof its true cause, when, in the rue de Noailles, we met an acquaintance,\r\nwho, although his political opinions did not coincide with ours, had\r\nalways shown himself very friendly to us. ’Well,’ said I, ’what news?’\r\n’Good for me and bad for you,’ he answered;’ I advise you to go away at\r\nonce.’ Surprised and somewhat alarmed at these words, we begged him to\r\nexplain. ’Listen,’ said he; ’there are going to be riots in the town; it\r\nis well known that you used to go to Brune’s nearly every evening, and\r\nthat you are in consequence no favourite with your neighbours; seek\r\nsafety in the country.’ I addressed some further question to him, but,\r\nturning his back on me, he left me without another word.\r\n\r\n\"M______ and I were still looking at each other in stupefaction, when\r\nthe increasing uproar aroused us to a sense that if we desired to follow\r\nthe advice just given we had not a moment to lose. We hastened to my\r\nhouse, which was situated in the Allees de Meilhan. My wife was just\r\ngoing out, but I stopped her.\r\n\r\n\"’We are not safe here,’ I said; ’we must get away into the country.’\r\n\r\n\"’But where can we go?’\r\n\r\n\"’Wherever luck takes us. Let us start.’\r\n\r\n\"She was going to put on her bonnet, but I told her to leave it behind;\r\nfor it was most important that no one should think we suspected\r\nanything, but were merely going for a stroll. This precaution saved us,\r\nfor we learned the next day that if our intention to fly had been\r\nsuspected we should have been stopped.\r\n\r\n\"We walked at random, while behind us we heard musket shots from every\r\npart of the town. We met a company of soldiers who were hurrying to the\r\nrelief of their comrades, but heard later that they had not been allowed\r\nto pass the gate.\r\n\r\n\"We recollected an old officer of our acquaintance who had quitted the\r\nservice and withdrawn from the world some years before, and had taken a\r\nplace in the country near the village of Saint-Just; we directed our\r\ncourse towards his house.\r\n\r\n\"’Captain,’ said I to him, ’they are murdering each other in the town,\r\nwe are pursued and without asylum, so we come to you.’ ’That’s right, my\r\nchildren,’ said he; ’come in and welcome. I have never meddled with\r\npolitical affairs, and no one can have anything against me. No one will\r\nthink of looking for you here.’\r\n\r\n\"The captain had friends in the town, who, one after another, reached\r\nhis house, and brought us news of all that went on during that dreadful\r\nday. Many soldiers had been killed, and the Mamelukes had been\r\nannihilated. A negress who had been in the service of these unfortunates\r\nhad been taken on the quay. ’Cry \"Long live the king!’ shouted the mob.\r\n’No,’ she replied. ’To Napoleon I owe my daily bread; long live\r\nNapoleon!’ A bayonet-thrust in the abdomen was the answer. ’Villains!’\r\nsaid she, covering the wound with her hand to keep back the protruding\r\nentrails. ’Long live Napoleon!’ A push sent her into the water; she\r\nsank, but rose again to the surface, and waving her hand, she cried for\r\nthe last time, ’Long live Napoleon!’ a bullet shot putting an end to her\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\"Several of the townspeople had met with shocking deaths. For instance,\r\nM. Angles, a neighbour of mine, an old man and no inconsiderable\r\nscholar, having unfortunately, when at the palace some days before,\r\ngiven utterance before witnesses to the sentiment that Napoleon was a\r\ngreat man, learned that for this crime he was about to be arrested.\r\nYielding to the prayers of his family, he disguised himself, and,\r\ngetting into a waggon, set off to seek safety in the country. He was,\r\nhowever, recognised and brought a prisoner to the place du Chapitre,\r\nwhere, after being buffeted about and insulted for an hour by the\r\npopulace, he was at last murdered.\r\n\r\n\"It may easily be imagined that although no one came to disturb us we\r\ndid not sleep much that night. The ladies rested on sofas or in\r\narm-chairs without undressing, while our host, M______ and myself took\r\nturns in guarding the door, gun in hand.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as it was light we consulted what course we should take: I was\r\nof the opinion that we ought to try to reach Aix by unfrequented paths;\r\nhaving friends there, we should be able to procure a carriage and get to\r\nNimes, where my family lived. But my wife did not agree with me. ’I must\r\ngo back to town for our things,’ said she; ’we have no clothes but those\r\non our backs. Let us send to the village to ask if Marseilles is quieter\r\nto-day than yesterday.’ So we sent off a messenger.\r\n\r\n\"The news he brought back was favourable; order was completely restored.\r\nI could not quite believe this, and still refused to let my wife return\r\nto the town unless I accompanied her. But in that everyone was against\r\nme: my presence would give rise to dangers which without me had no\r\nexistence. Where were the miscreants cowardly enough to murder a woman\r\nof eighteen who belonged to no-party and had never injured anyone? As\r\nfor me, my opinions were well known. Moreover, my mother-in-law offered\r\nto accompany her daughter, and both joined in persuading me that there\r\nwas no danger. At last I was forced to consent, but only on one\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n\"’I cannot say,’ I observed, ’whether there is any foundation for the\r\nreassuring tidings we have heard, but of one thing you may be sure: it\r\nis now seven o’clock in the morning, you can get to Marseilles in an\r\nhour, pack your trunks in another hour, and return in a third; let us\r\nallow one hour more for unforeseen delays. If you are not back by eleven\r\no’clock, I shall believe something has happened, and take steps\r\naccordingly.’ ’Very well,’ said my wife; ’if I am not back by then, you\r\nmay think me dead, and do whatever you think best.’ And so she and her\r\nmother left me.\r\n\r\n\"An hour later, quite different news came to hand. Fugitives, seeking\r\nlike ourselves safety in the country, told us that the rioting, far from\r\nceasing, had increased; the streets were encumbered with corpses, and\r\ntwo people had been murdered with unheard-of cruelty.\r\n\r\n\"An old man named Bessieres, who had led a simple and blameless life,\r\nand whose only crime was that he had served under the Usurper,\r\nanticipating that under existing circumstances this would be regarded as\r\na capital crime, made his will, which was afterwards found among his\r\npapers. It began with the following words:\r\n\r\n\"’As it is possible that during this revolution I may meet my death, as\r\na partisan of Napoleon, although I have never loved him, I give and\r\nbequeath, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n\"The day before, his brother-in-law, knowing he had private enemies, had\r\ncome to the house and spent the night trying to induce him to flee, but\r\nall in vain. But the next morning, his house being attacked, he yielded,\r\nand tried to escape by the back door. He was stopped by some of the\r\nNational Guard, and placed himself under their protection.\r\n\r\n\"They took him to the Cours St. Louis, where, being hustled by the crowd\r\nand very ineffectually defended by the Guards, he tried to enter the\r\nCafe Mercantier, but the door was shut in his face. Being broken by\r\nfatigue, breathless, and covered with dust and sweat, he threw himself\r\non one of the benches placed against the wall, outside the house. Here\r\nhe was wounded by a musket bullet, but not killed. At the sight of his\r\nblood shrieks of joy were heard, and then a young man with a pistol in\r\neach hand forced his way through the throng and killed the old man by\r\ntwo shots fired point blank in his face.\r\n\r\n\"Another still more atrocious murder took place in the course of the\r\nsame morning. A father and son, bound back to back, were delivered over\r\nto the tender mercies of the mob. Stoned and beaten and covered with\r\neach other’s blood, for two long hours their death-agony endured, and\r\nall the while those who could not get near enough to strike were dancing\r\nround them.\r\n\r\n\"Our time passed listening to such stories; suddenly I saw a friend\r\nrunning towards the house. I went to meet him. He was so pale that I\r\nhardly dared to question him. He came from the city, and had been at my\r\nhouse to see what had become of me. There was no one in it, but across\r\nthe door lay two corpses wrapped in a blood-stained sheet which he had\r\nnot dared to lift.\r\n\r\n\"At these terrible words nothing could hold me back. I set off for\r\nMarseilles. M______ who would not consent to let me return alone,\r\naccompanied me. In passing through the village of Saint-Just we\r\nencountered a crowd of armed peasants in the main street who appeared to\r\nbelong to the free companies. Although this circumstance was rather\r\nalarming, it would have been dangerous to turn back, so we continued our\r\nway as if we were not in the least uneasy. They examined our bearing and\r\nour dress narrowly, and then exchanged some sentences in a low, voice,\r\nof which we only caught the word austaniers. This was the name by which\r\nthe Bonapartists were called by the peasants, and means ’eaters of\r\nchestnuts,’ this article of food being brought from Corsica to France.\r\nHowever, we were not molested in any way, for as we were going towards\r\nthe city they did not think we could be fugitives. A hundred yards\r\nbeyond the village we came up with a crowd of peasants, who were, like\r\nus, on the way to Marseilles. It was plain to see that they had just\r\nbeen pillaging some country house, for they were laden with rich stuffs,\r\nchandeliers and jewels. It proved to be that of M. R____, inspector of\r\nreviews. Several carried muskets. I pointed out to my companion a stain\r\nof blood on the trousers of one of the men, who began to laugh when he\r\nsaw what we were looking at. Two hundred yards outside the city I met a\r\nwoman who had formerly been a servant in my house. She was very much\r\nastonished to see me, and said, ’Go away at once; the massacre is\r\nhorrible, much worse than yesterday.’\r\n\r\n\"’But my wife,’ I cried, ’do you know anything about her?’\r\n\r\n\"’No, sir,’ she replied; ’I was going to knock at the door, but some\r\npeople asked me in a threatening manner if I could tell them where the\r\nfriend of that rascal Brine was, as they were going to take away his\r\nappetite for bread. So take my advice,’ she continued, ’and go back to\r\nwhere you came from.’\r\n\r\n\"This advice was the last I could make up my mind to follow, so we went\r\non, but found a strong guard at the gate, and saw that it would be\r\nimpossible to get through without being recognised. At the same time,\r\nthe cries and the reports of firearms from within were coming nearer; it\r\nwould therefore have been to court certain death to advance, so we\r\nretraced our steps. In passing again through the village of Saint-Just\r\nwe met once more our armed peasants. But this time they burst out into\r\nthreats on seeing us, shouting, ’Let us kill them! Let us kill them!’\r\nInstead of running away, we approached them, assuring them that we were\r\nRoyalists. Our coolness was so convincing that we got through safe and\r\nsound.\r\n\r\n\"On getting back to the captain’s I threw myself on the sofa, quite\r\novercome by the thought that only that morning my wife had been beside\r\nme under my protection, and that I had let her go back to the town to a\r\ncruel and inevitable death. I felt as if my heart would break, and\r\nnothing that our host and my friend could say gave me the slightest\r\ncomfort. I was like a madman, unconscious of everything round me.\r\n\r\n\"M______ went out to try to pick up some news, but in an instant we\r\nheard him running back, and he dashed into the room, calling out:\r\n\r\n\"’They are coming! There they are!’\r\n\r\n\"’Who are coming?’ we asked.\r\n\r\n\"’The assassins!’\r\n\r\n\"My first feeling, I confess, was one of joy. I pounced upon a pair of\r\ndouble-barrelled pistols, resolved not to let myself be slaughtered like\r\na sheep. Through the window I could see some men climbing over the wall\r\nand getting down into the garden. We had just sufficient time to escape\r\nby a back staircase which led to a door, through which we passed,\r\nshutting it behind us. We found ourselves on a road, at the other side\r\nof which was a vineyard. We crossed the road and crept under the vines,\r\nwhich completely concealed us.\r\n\r\n\"As we learned later, the captain’s house had been denounced as a\r\nBonapartist nest, and the assassins had hoped to take it by surprise;\r\nand, indeed, if they had come a little sooner we had been lost, for\r\nbefore we had been five minutes in our hiding-place the murderers rushed\r\nout on the road, looking for us in every direction, without the\r\nslightest suspicion that we were not six yards distant. Though they did\r\nnot see us I could see them, and I held my pistols ready cocked, quite\r\ndetermined to kill the first who came near. However, in a short time\r\nthey went away.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as they were out of hearing we began to consider our situation\r\nand weigh our chances. There was no use in going back to the captain’s,\r\nfor he was no longer there, having also succeeded in getting away. If we\r\nwere to wander about the country we should be recognised as fugitives,\r\nand the fate that awaited us as such was at that moment brought home to\r\nus, for a few yards away we suddenly heard the shrieks of a man who was\r\nbeing murdered. They were the first cries of agony I had ever heard, and\r\nfor a few moments, I confess, I was frozen with terror. But soon a\r\nviolent reaction took place within me, and I felt that it would be\r\nbetter to march straight to meet peril than to await its coming, and\r\nalthough I knew the danger of trying to go through Saint-Just again, I\r\nresolved to risk it, and to get to Marseilles at all costs. So, turning\r\nto M____, I said:\r\n\r\n\"’You can remain here without danger until the evening, but I am going\r\nto Marseilles at once; for I cannot endure this uncertainty any longer.\r\nIf I find Saint-Just clear, I shall come back and rejoin you, but if not\r\nI shall get away as best I can alone.’\r\n\r\n\"Knowing the danger that we were running, and how little chance there\r\nwas that we should ever see each other again, he held out his hand to\r\nme, but I threw myself into his arms and gave him a last embrace.\r\n\r\n\"I started at once: when I reached Saint-Just I found the freebooters\r\nstill there; so I walked up to them, trolling a melody, but one of them\r\nseized me by the collar and two others took aim at me with their\r\nmuskets.\r\n\r\n\"If ever in my life I shouted ’Long live the king!’ with less enthusiasm\r\nthan the cry deserves, it was then: to assume a rollicking air, to laugh\r\nwith cool carelessness when there is nothing between you and death but\r\nthe more or less strong pressure of a highwayman’s finger on the trigger\r\nof a musket, is no easy task; but all this I accomplished, and once more\r\ngot through the village with a whole skin indeed, but with the\r\nunalterable resolution to blow my brains out rather than again try such\r\nan experiment.\r\n\r\n\"Having now a village behind me which I had vowed never to re-enter, and\r\nthere being no road available by which I could hope to get round\r\nMarseilles, the only course open to me was to make my way into the city.\r\nAt that moment this was a thing of difficulty, for many small bodies of\r\ntroops, wearing the white cockade, infested the approaches. I soon\r\nperceived that the danger of getting in was as great as ever, so I\r\ndetermined to walk up and down till night, hoping the darkness would\r\ncome to my aid; but one of the patrols soon gave me to understand that\r\nmy prowling about had aroused suspicion, and ordered me either to go on\r\nto the city, in which by all accounts there was small chance of safety\r\nfor me, or back to the village; where certain death awaited me. A happy\r\ninspiration flashed across my mind, I would get some refreshment, and\r\nseeing an inn near by, I went in and ordered a mug of beer, sitting down\r\nnear the window, faintly hoping that before the necessity for a final\r\ndecision arrived, someone who knew me would pass by. After waiting half\r\nan hour, I did indeed see an acquaintance—no other than M______, whom I\r\nhad left in the vineyard. I beckoned him, and he joined me. He told me\r\nthat, being too impatient to await my return, he had soon made up his\r\nmind to follow me, and by joining a band of pillagers was lucky enough\r\nto get safely through Saint-Just. We consulted together as to what we\r\nhad better do next, and having applied to our host, found he could\r\nsupply us with a trusty messenger, who would carry the news of our\r\nwhereabouts to my brother-in-law. After an anxious wait of three hours,\r\nwe saw him coming. I was about to run out to meet him, but M____ held me\r\nback, pointing out the danger of such a step; so we sat still our eyes\r\nfixed on the approaching figure. But when my brother-in-law reached the\r\ninn, I could restrain my impatience no longer, but rushing out of the\r\nroom met him on the stairs.\r\n\r\n\"’My wife?’ I cried. ’Have you seen my wife?’\r\n\r\n\"’She is at my house,’ was the reply, and with a cry of joy I threw\r\nmyself into his arms.\r\n\r\n\"My wife, who had been threatened, insulted, and roughly treated because\r\nof my opinions, had indeed found safety at my brother-in-law’s.\r\n\r\n\"Night was coming on. My brother-in-law, who wore the uniform of the\r\nNational Guard, which was at that moment a safeguard, took us each by an\r\narm, and we passed the barrier without anyone asking us who we were.\r\nChoosing quiet streets, we reached his house unmolested; but in fact the\r\nwhole city was quiet, for the carnage was practically at an end.\r\n\r\n\"My wife safe! this thought filled my heart with joy almost too great to\r\nbear.\r\n\r\n\"Her adventures were the following:\r\n\r\n\"My wife and her mother had gone to our house, as agreed upon, to pack\r\nour trunks. As they left their rooms, having accomplished their task,\r\nthey found the landlady waiting on the staircase, who at once\r\noverwhelmed my wife with a torrent of abuse.\r\n\r\n\"The husband, who until then had known nothing of their tenant’s return,\r\nhearing the noise, came out of his room, and, seizing his wife by the\r\narm, pulled her in and shut the door. She, however, rushed to the\r\nwindow, and just as my wife and her mother reached the street, shouted\r\nto a free band who were on guard across the way, ’Fire! they are\r\nBonapartists!’ Fortunately the men, more merciful than the woman, seeing\r\ntwo ladies quite alone, did not hinder their passage, and as just then\r\nmy brother-in-law came by, whose opinions were well known and whose\r\nuniform was respected, he was allowed to take them under his protection\r\nand conduct them to his house in safety.\r\n\r\n\"A young man, employed at the Prefecture, who had called at my house the\r\nday before, I having promised to help him in editing the Journal des\r\nBouches-du-Rhone, was not so lucky. His occupation and his visit to me\r\nlaid him under suspicion of possessing dangerous opinions, and his\r\nfriends urged him to fly; but it was too late. He was attacked at the\r\ncorner of the rue de Noailles, and fell wounded by a stab from a dagger.\r\nHappily, however, he ultimately recovered.\r\n\r\n\"The whole day was passed in the commission of deeds still more bloody\r\nthan those of the day before; the sewers ran blood, and every hundred\r\nyards a dead body was to be met. But this sight, instead of satiating\r\nthe thirst for blood of the assassins, only seemed to awaken a general\r\nfeeling of gaiety. In the evening the streets resounded with song and\r\nroundelay, and for many a year to come that which we looked back on as\r\n’the day of the massacre’ lived in the memory of the Royalists as ’the\r\nday of the farce.’\r\n\r\n\"As we felt we could not live any longer in the midst of such scenes,\r\neven though, as far as we were concerned, all danger was over, we set\r\nout for Nimes that same evening, having been offered the use of a\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing worthy of note happened on the road to Orgon, which we reached\r\nnext day; but the isolated detachments of troops which we passed from\r\ntime to time reminded us that the tranquillity was nowhere perfect. As\r\nwe neared the town we saw three men going about arm in arm; this\r\nfriendliness seemed strange to us after our recent experiences, for one\r\nof them wore a white cockade, the second a tricolour, and the third none\r\nat all, and yet they went about on the most brotherly terms, each\r\nawaiting under a different banner the outcome of events. Their wisdom\r\nimpressed me much, and feeling I had nothing to fear from such\r\nphilosophers, I went up to them and questioned them, and they explained\r\ntheir hopes to me with the greatest innocence, and above all, their firm\r\ndetermination to belong to what ever party got the upper hand. As we\r\ndrove into Orgon we saw at a glance that the whole town was simmering\r\nwith excitement. Everybody’s face expressed anxiety. A man who, we were\r\ntold, was the mayor, was haranguing a group. As everyone was listening,\r\nwith the greatest attention, we drew near and asked them the cause of\r\nthe excitement.\r\n\r\n\"’Gentlemen,’ said he, ’you ought to know the news: the king is in his\r\ncapital, and we have once more hoisted the white flag, and there has not\r\nbeen a single dispute to mar the tranquillity of the day; one party has\r\ntriumphed without violence, and the other has submitted with\r\nresignation. But I have just learned that a band of vagabonds, numbering\r\nabout three hundred, have assembled on the bridge over the Durance, and\r\nare preparing to raid our little town to-night, intending by pillage or\r\nextortion to get at what we possess. I have a few guns left which I am\r\nabout to distribute, and each man will watch over the safety of all.’\r\n\r\n\"Although he had not enough arms to go round, he offered to supply us,\r\nbut as I had my double-barrelled pistols I did not deprive him of his\r\nweapons. I made the ladies go to bed, and, sitting at their door, tried\r\nto sleep as well as I could, a pistol in each hand. But at every instant\r\nthe noise of a false alarm sounded through the town, and when day dawned\r\nmy only consolation was that no one else in Orgon had slept any better\r\nthan I.\r\n\r\n\"The next day we continued our journey to Tarascon, where new\r\nexcitements awaited us. As we got near the town we heard the tocsin\r\nclanging and drums beating the generale. We were getting so accustomed\r\nto the uproar that we were not very much astonished. However, when we\r\ngot in we asked what was going on, and we were told that twelve thousand\r\ntroops from Nimes had marched on Beaucaire and laid it waste with fire\r\nand sword. I insinuated that twelve thousand men was rather a large\r\nnumber for one town to furnish, but was told that that included troops\r\nfrom the Gardonninque and the Cevennes. Nimes still clung to the\r\ntricolour, but Beaucaire had hoisted the white flag, and it was for the\r\npurpose of pulling it down and scattering the Royalists who were\r\nassembling in numbers at Beaucaire that Nimes had sent forth her troops\r\non this expedition. Seeing that Tarascon and Beaucaire are only\r\nseparated by the Rhone, it struck me as peculiar that such quiet should\r\nprevail on one bank, while such fierce conflict was raging on the other.\r\nI did not doubt that something had happened, but not an event of such\r\ngravity as was reported. We therefore decided to push on to Beaucaire,\r\nand when we got there we found the town in the most perfect order. The\r\nexpedition of twelve thousand men was reduced to one of two hundred,\r\nwhich had been easily repulsed, with the result that of the assailants\r\none had been wounded and one made prisoner. Proud of this success, the\r\npeople of Beaucaire entrusted us with a thousand objurgations to deliver\r\nto their inveterate enemies the citizens of Nimes.\r\n\r\n\"If any journey could give a correct idea of the preparations for civil\r\nwar and the confusion which already prevailed in the South, I should\r\nthink that without contradiction it would be that which we took that\r\nday. Along the four leagues which lie between Beaucaire and Nimes were\r\nposted at frequent intervals detachments of troops displaying\r\nalternately the white and the tricoloured cockade. Every village upon\r\nour route except those just outside of Nimes had definitely joined\r\neither one party or the other, and the soldiers, who were stationed at\r\nequal distances along the road, were now Royalist and now Bonapartist.\r\nBefore leaving Beaucaire we had all provided ourselves, taking example\r\nby the men we had seen at Orgon, with two cockades, one white, and one\r\ntricoloured, and by peeping out from carriage windows we were able to\r\nsee which was worn by the troops we were approaching in time to attach a\r\nsimilar one to our hats before we got up to them, whilst we hid the\r\nother in our shoes; then as we were passing we stuck our heads,\r\ndecorated according to circumstances, out of the windows, and shouted\r\nvigorously, ’Long live the king!’ or ’Long live the emperor!’ as the\r\ncase demanded. Thanks to this concession to political opinions on the\r\nhighway, and in no less degree to the money which we gave by way of tips\r\nto everybody everywhere, we arrived at length at the barriers of Nimes,\r\nwhere we came up with the National Guards who had been repulsed by the\r\ntownspeople of Beaucaire.\r\n\r\n\"This is what had taken place just before we arrived in the city:\r\n\r\n\"The National Guard of Nimes and the troops of which the garrison was\r\ncomposed had resolved to unite in giving a banquet on Sunday, the 28th\r\nof June, to celebrate the success of the French army. The news of the\r\nbattle of Waterloo travelled much more quickly to Marseilles than to\r\nNimes, so the banquet took place without interruption. A bust of\r\nNapoleon was carried in procession all over the town, and then the\r\nregular soldiers and the National Guard devoted the rest of the day to\r\nrejoicings, which were followed by no excess.\r\n\r\n\"But the day was not quite finished before news came that numerous\r\nmeetings were taking place at Beaucaire, so although the news of the\r\ndefeat at Waterloo reached Nimes on the following Tuesday, the troops\r\nwhich we had seen returning at the gates of the city had been despatched\r\non Wednesday to disperse these assemblies. Meantime the Bonapartists,\r\nunder the command of General Gilly, amongst whom was a regiment of\r\nchasseurs, beginning to despair of the success of their cause, felt that\r\ntheir situation was becoming very critical, especially as they learnt\r\nthat the forces at Beaucaire had assumed the offensive and were about to\r\nmarch upon Nimes. As I had had no connection with anything that had\r\ntaken place in the capital of the Gard, I personally had nothing to\r\nfear; but having learned by experience how easily suspicions arise, I\r\nwas afraid that the ill-luck which had not spared either my friends or\r\nmy family might lead to their being accused of having received a refugee\r\nfrom Marseilles, a word which in itself had small significance, but\r\nwhich in the mouth of an enemy might be fatal. Fears for the future\r\nbeing thus aroused by my recollections of the past, I decided to give up\r\nthe contemplation of a drama which might become redoubtable, asked to\r\nbury myself in the country with the firm intention of coming back to\r\nNimes as soon as the white flag should once more float from its towers.\r\n\r\n\"An old castle in the Cevennes, which from the days when the Albigenses\r\nwere burnt, down to the massacre of La Bagarre, had witnessed many a\r\nrevolution and counter revolution, became the asylum of my wife, my\r\nmother, M______, and myself. As the peaceful tranquillity of our life\r\nthere was unbroken by any event of interest, I shall not pause to dwell\r\non it. But at length we grew weary, for such is man, of our life of\r\ncalm, and being left once for nearly a week without any news from\r\noutside, we made that an excuse for returning to Nimes in order to see\r\nwith our own eyes how things were going on.\r\n\r\n\"When we were about two leagues on our way we met the carriage of a\r\nfriend, a rich landed proprietor from the city; seeing that he was in\r\nit, I alighted to ask him what was happening at Nimes. ’I hope you do\r\nnot think of going there,’ said he, ’especially at this moment; the\r\nexcitement is intense, blood has already flowed, and a catastrophe is\r\nimminent.’ So back we went to our mountain castle, but in a few days\r\nbecame again a prey to the same restlessness, and, not being able to\r\novercome it, decided to go at all risks and see for ourselves the\r\ncondition of affairs; and this time, neither advice nor warning having\r\nany effect, we not only set out, but we arrived at our destination the\r\nsame evening.\r\n\r\n\"We had not been misinformed, frays having already taken place in the\r\nstreets which had heated public opinion. One man had been killed on the\r\nEsplanade by a musket shot, and it seemed as if his death would be only\r\nthe forerunner of many. The Catholics were awaiting with impatience the\r\narrival of those doughty warriors from Beaucaire on whom they placed\r\ntheir chief reliance. The Protestants went about in painful silence, and\r\nfear blanched every face. At length the white flag was hoisted and the\r\nking proclaimed without any of the disorders which had been dreaded\r\ntaking place, but it was plainly visible that this calm was only a pause\r\nbefore a struggle, and that on the slightest pretext the pent-up\r\npassions would break loose again.\r\n\r\n\"Just at this time the memory of our quiet life in the mountains\r\ninspired us with a happy idea. We had learned that the obstinate\r\nresolution of Marshal Brune never to acknowledge Louis XVIII as king had\r\nbeen softened, and that the marshal had been induced to hoist the white\r\nflag at Toulon, while with a cockade in his hat he had formally resigned\r\nthe command of that place into the hands of the royal authorities.\r\n\r\n\"Henceforward in all Provence there was no spot where he could live\r\nunmarked. His ultimate intentions were unknown to us, indeed his\r\nmovements seemed to show great hesitation on his part, so it occurred to\r\nus to offer him our little country house as a refuge where he could\r\nawait the arrival of more peaceful times. We decided that M____ and\r\nanother friend of ours who had just arrived from Paris should go to him\r\nand make the offer, which he would at once accept all the more readily\r\nbecause it came from the hearts which were deeply devoted to him. They\r\nset out, but to my great surprise returned the same day. They brought us\r\nword that Marshal Brune had been assassinated at Avignon.\r\n\r\n\"At first we could not believe the dreadful news, and took it for one of\r\nthose ghastly rumours which circulate with such rapidity during periods\r\nof civil strife; but we were not left long in uncertainty, for the\r\ndetails of the catastrophe arrived all too soon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some days Avignon had its assassins, as Marseilles had had them, and\r\nas Nimes was about to have them; for some days all Avignon shuddered at\r\nthe names of five men—Pointu, Farges, Roquefort, Naudaud, and Magnan.\r\n\r\nPointu was a perfect type of the men of the South, olive-skinned and\r\neagle-eyed, with a hook nose, and teeth of ivory. Although he was hardly\r\nabove middle height, and his back was bent from bearing heavy burdens,\r\nhis legs bowed by the pressure of the enormous masses which he daily\r\ncarried, he was yet possessed of extraordinary strength and dexterity.\r\nHe could throw over the Loulle gate a 48-pound cannon ball as easily as\r\na child could throw its ball. He could fling a stone from one bank of\r\nthe Rhone to the other where it was two hundred yards wide. And lastly,\r\nhe could throw a knife backwards while running at full speed with such\r\nstrength and precision of aim that this new kind of Parthian arrow would\r\ngo whistling through the air to hide two inches of its iron head in a\r\ntree trunk no thicker than a man’s thigh. When to these accomplishments\r\nare added an equal skill with the musket, the pistol, and the\r\nquarter-staff, a good deal of mother wit, a deep hatred for Republicans,\r\nagainst whom he had vowed vengeance at the foot of the scaffold on which\r\nhis father and mother had perished, an idea can be formed of the\r\nterrible chief of the assassins of Avignon, who had for his lieutenants,\r\nFarges the silk-weaver, Roquefort the porter, Naudaud the baker, and\r\nMagnan the secondhand clothes dealer.\r\n\r\nAvignon was entirely in the power of these five men, whose brutal\r\nconduct the civil and military authorities would not or could not\r\nrepress, when word came that Marshal Brune, who was at Luc in command of\r\nsix thousand troops, had been summoned to Paris to give an account of\r\nhis conduct to the new Government.\r\n\r\nThe marshal, knowing the state of intense excitement which prevailed in\r\nthe South, and foreseeing the perils likely to meet him on the road,\r\nasked permission to travel by water, but met with an official refusal,\r\nand the Duc de Riviere, governor of Marseilles, furnished him with a\r\nsafe-conduct. The cut-throats bellowed with joy when they learned that a\r\nRepublican of ’89, who had risen to the rank of marshal under the\r\nUsurper, was about to pass through Avignon. At the same time sinister\r\nreports began to run from mouth to mouth, the harbingers of death. Once\r\nmore the infamous slander which a hundred times had been proved to be\r\nfalse, raised its voice with dogged persistence, asserting that Brune,\r\nwho did not arrive at Paris until the 5th of September, 1792, had on the\r\n2nd, when still at Lyons, carried the head of the Princesse de Lamballe\r\nimpaled on a pike. Soon the news came that the marshal had just escaped\r\nassassination at Aix, indeed he owed his safety to the fleetness of his\r\nhorses. Pointu, Forges, and Roquefort swore that they would manage\r\nthings better at Avignon.\r\n\r\nBy the route which the marshal had chosen there were only two ways open\r\nby which he could reach Lyons: he must either pass through Avignon, or\r\navoid it by taking a cross-road, which branched off the Pointet highway,\r\ntwo leagues outside the town. The assassins thought he would take the\r\nlatter course, and on the 2nd of August, the day on which the marshal\r\nwas expected, Pointu, Magnan, and Naudaud, with four of their creatures,\r\ntook a carriage at six o’clock in the morning, and, setting out from the\r\nRhone bridge, hid themselves by the side of the high road to Pointet.\r\n\r\nWhen the marshal reached the point where the road divided, having been\r\nwarned of the hostile feelings so rife in Avignon, he decided to take\r\nthe cross-road upon which Pointu and his men were awaiting him; but the\r\npostillion obstinately refused to drive in this direction, saying that\r\nhe always changed horses at Avignon, and not at Pointet. One of the\r\nmarshal’s aides-de-camp tried, pistol in hand, to force him to obey; but\r\nthe marshal would permit no violence to be offered him, and gave him\r\norders to go on to Avignon.\r\n\r\nThe marshal reached the town at nine o’clock in the morning, and\r\nalighted at the Hotel du Palais Royal, which was also the post-house.\r\nWhile fresh horses were being put to and the passports and safe-conduct\r\nexamined at the Loulle gate, the marshal entered the hotel to take a\r\nplate of soup. In less than five minutes a crowd gathered round the\r\ndoor, and M. Moulin the proprietor noticing the sinister and threatening\r\nexpression many of the faces bore, went to the marshal’s room and urged\r\nhim to leave instantly without waiting for his papers, pledging his word\r\nthat he would send a man on horseback after him, who would overtake him\r\ntwo or three leagues beyond the town, and bring him his own safe-conduct\r\nand the passports of his aides-de-camp. The marshal came downstairs, and\r\nfinding the horses ready, got into the carriage, on which loud murmurs\r\narose from the populace, amongst which could be distinguished the\r\nterrible word ’zaou!’ that excited cry of the Provencal, which according\r\nto the tone in which it is uttered expresses every shade of threat, and\r\nwhich means at once in a single syllable, \"Bite, rend, kill, murder!\"\r\n\r\nThe marshal set out at a gallop, and passed the town gates unmolested,\r\nexcept by the howlings of the populace, who, however, made no attempt to\r\nstop him. He thought he had left all his enemies behind, but when he\r\nreached the Rhone bridge he found a group of men armed with muskets\r\nwaiting there, led by Farges and Roquefort. They all raised their guns\r\nand took aim at the marshal, who thereupon ordered the postillion to\r\ndrive back. The order was obeyed, but when the carriage had gone about\r\nfifty yards it was met by the crowd from the \"Palais Royal,\" which had\r\nfollowed it, so the postillion stopped. In a moment the traces were cut,\r\nwhereupon the marshal, opening the door, alighted, followed by his\r\nvalet, and passing on foot through the Loulle gate, followed by a second\r\ncarriage in which were his aides-de-camp, he regained the \"Palais\r\nRoyal,\" the doors of which were opened to him and his suite, and\r\nimmediately secured against all others.\r\n\r\nThe marshal asked to be shown to a room, and M. Moulin gave him No. 1,\r\nto the front. In ten minutes three thousand people filled the square; it\r\nwas as if the population sprang up from the ground. Just then the\r\ncarriage, which the marshal had left behind, came up, the postillion\r\nhaving tied the traces, and a second time the great yard gates were\r\nopened, and in spite of the press closed again and barricaded by the\r\nporter Vernet, and M. Moulin himself, both of whom were men of colossal\r\nstrength. The aides-de-camp, who had remained in the carriage until\r\nthen, now alighted, and asked to be shown to the marshal; but Moulin\r\nordered the porter to conceal them in an outhouse. Vernet taking one in\r\neach hand, dragged them off despite their struggles, and pushing them\r\nbehind some empty barrels, over which he threw an old piece of carpet,\r\nsaid to them in a voice as solemn as if he were a prophet, \"If you move,\r\nyou are dead men,\" and left them. The aides-de-camp remained there\r\nmotionless and silent.\r\n\r\nAt that moment M. de Saint-Chamans, prefect of Avignon, who had arrived\r\nin town at five o’clock in the morning, came out into the courtyard. By\r\nthis time the crowd was smashing the windows and breaking in the street\r\ndoor. The square was full to overflowing, everywhere threatening cries\r\nwere heard, and above all the terrible zaou, which from moment to moment\r\nbecame more full of menace. M. Moulin saw that if they could not hold\r\nout until the troops under Major Lambot arrived, all was lost; he\r\ntherefore told Vernet to settle the business of those who were breaking\r\nin the door, while he would take charge of those who were trying to get\r\nin at the window. Thus these two men, moved by a common impulse and of\r\nequal courage, undertook to dispute with a howling mob the possession of\r\nthe blood for which it thirsted.\r\n\r\nBoth dashed to their posts, one in the hall, the other in the\r\ndining-room, and found door and windows already smashed, and several men\r\nin the house. At the sight of Vernet, with whose immense strength they\r\nwere acquainted, those in the hall drew back a step, and Vernet, taking\r\nadvantage of this movement, succeeded in ejecting them and in securing\r\nthe door once more. Meantime M. Moulin, seizing his double-barrelled\r\ngun, which stood in the chimney-corner, pointed it at five men who had\r\ngot into the dining-room, and threatened to fire if they did not\r\ninstantly get out again. Four obeyed, but one refused to budge;\r\nwhereupon Moulin, finding himself no longer outnumbered, laid aside his\r\ngun, and, seizing his adversary round the waist, lifted him as if he\r\nwere a child and flung him out of the window. The man died three weeks\r\nlater, not from the fall but from the squeeze.\r\n\r\nMoulin then dashed to the window to secure it, but as he laid his hand\r\non it he felt his head seized from behind and pressed violently down on\r\nhis left shoulder; at the same instant a pane was broken into splinters,\r\nand the head of a hatchet struck his right shoulder. M. de\r\nSaint-Chamans, who had followed him into the room, had seen the weapon\r\nthrown at Moulin’s head, and not being able to turn aside the iron, had\r\nturned aside the object at which it was aimed. Moulin seized the hatchet\r\nby the handle and tore it out of the hands of him who had delivered the\r\nblow, which fortunately had missed its aim. He then finished closing the\r\nwindow, and secured it by making fast the inside shutters, and went\r\nupstairs to see after the marshal.\r\n\r\nHim he found striding up and down his room, his handsome and noble face\r\nas calm as if the voices of all those shouting men outside were not\r\ndemanding his death. Moulin made him leave No. 1 for No. 3, which, being\r\na back room and looking out on the courtyard, seemed to offer more\r\nchances of safety than the other. The marshal asked for writing\r\nmaterials, which Moulin brought, whereupon the marshal sat down at a\r\nlittle table and began to write.\r\n\r\nJust then the cries outside became still more uproarious. M. de\r\nSaint-Chamans had gone out and ordered the crowd to disperse, whereupon\r\na thousand people had answered him with one voice, asking who he was\r\nthat he should give such an order. He announced his rank and authority,\r\nto which the answer was, \"We only know the prefect by his clothes.\" Now\r\nit had unfortunately happened that M. de Chamans having sent his trunks\r\nby diligence they had not yet arrived, and being dressed in a green\r\ncoat; nankeen trousers, and a pique vest, it could hardly be expected\r\nthat in such a suit he should overawe the people under the\r\ncircumstances; so, when he got up on a bench to harangue the populace,\r\ncries arose of \"Down with the green coat! We have enough of charlatans\r\nlike that!\" and he was forced to get down again. As Vernet opened the\r\ndoor to let him in, several men took advantage of the circumstance to\r\npush in along with him; but Vernet let his fist fall three times, and\r\nthree men rolled at his feet like bulls struck by a club. The others\r\nwithdrew. A dozen champions such as Vernet would have saved the marshal.\r\nYet it must not be forgotten that this man was a Royalist, and held the\r\nsame opinions as those against whom he fought; for him as for them the\r\nmarshal was a mortal enemy, but he had a noble heart, and if the marshal\r\nwere guilty he desired a trial and not a murder. Meantime a certain\r\nonlooker had heard what had been said to M. de Chamans about his\r\nunofficial costume, and had gone to put on his uniform. This was M. de\r\nPuy, a handsome and venerable old man, with white hair, pleasant\r\nexpression, and winning voice. He soon came back in his mayor’s robes,\r\nwearing his scarf and his double cross of St. Louis and the Legion of\r\nHonour. But neither his age nor his dignity made the slightest\r\nimpression on these people; they did not even allow him to get back to\r\nthe hotel door, but knocked him down and trampled him under foot, so\r\nthat he hardly escaped with torn clothes and his white hair covered with\r\ndust and blood. The fury of the mob had now reached its height.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture the garrison of Avignon came in sight; it was composed\r\nof four hundred volunteers, who formed a battalion known as the Royal\r\nAngouleme. It was commanded by a man who had assumed the title of\r\nLieutenant-General of the Emancipating Army of Vaucluse. These forces\r\ndrew up under the windows of the \"Palais Royal.\" They were composed\r\nalmost entirely of Provenceaux, and spoke the same dialect as the people\r\nof the lower orders. The crowd asked the soldiers for what they had\r\ncome, why they did not leave them to accomplish an act of justice in\r\npeace, and if they intended to interfere. \"Quite the contrary,\" said one\r\nof the soldiers; \"pitch him out of the window, and we will catch him on\r\nthe points of our bayonets.\" Brutal cries of joy greeted this answer,\r\nsucceeded by a short silence, but it was easy to see that under the\r\napparent calm the crowd was in a state of eager expectation. Soon new\r\nshouts were heard, but this time from the interior of the hotel; a small\r\nband of men led by Forges and Roquefort had separated themselves from\r\nthe throng, and by the help of ladders had scaled the walls and got on\r\nthe roof of the house, and, gliding down the other side, had dropped\r\ninto the balcony outside the windows of the rooms where the marshal was\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nSome of these dashed through the windows without waiting to open them,\r\nothers rushed in at the open door. The marshal, thus taken by surprise,\r\nrose, and not wishing that the letter he was writing to the Austrian\r\ncommandant to claim his protection should fall into the hands of these\r\nwretches, he tore it to pieces. Then a man who belonged to a better\r\nclass than the others, and who wears to-day the Cross of the Legion of\r\nHonour, granted to him perhaps for his conduct on this occasion,\r\nadvanced towards the marshal, sword in hand, and told him if he had any\r\nlast arrangements to make, he should make them at once, for he had only\r\nten minutes to live.\r\n\r\n\"What are you thinking of?\" exclaimed Forges. \"Ten minutes! Did he give\r\nthe Princesse de Lamballe ten minutes?\" and he pointed his pistol at the\r\nmarshal’s breast; but the marshal striking up the weapon, the shot\r\nmissed its aim and buried itself in the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\"Clumsy fellow!\" said the marshal, shrugging his shoulders, \"not to be\r\nable to kill a man at such close range.\"\r\n\r\n\"That’s true,\" replied Roquefort in his patois. \"I’ll show you how to do\r\nit\"; and, receding a step, he took aim with his carbine at his victim,\r\nwhose back was partly towards him. A report was heard, and the marshal\r\nfell dead on the spot, the bullet which entered at the shoulder going\r\nright through his body and striking the opposite wall.\r\n\r\nThe two shots, which had been heard in the street, made the howling mob\r\ndance for joy. One cowardly fellow, called Cadillan, rushed out on one\r\nof the balconies which looked on the square, and, holding a loaded\r\npistol in each hand, which he had not dared to discharge even into the\r\ndead body of the murdered man, he cut a caper, and, holding up the\r\ninnocent weapons, called out, \"These have done the business!\" But he\r\nlied, the braggart, and boasted of a crime which was committed by braver\r\ncutthroats than he.\r\n\r\nBehind him came the general of the \"Emancipating Army of Vaucluse,\" who,\r\ngraciously saluting the crowd, said, \"The marshal has carried out an act\r\nof justice by taking his own life.\" Shouts of mingled joy, revenge, and\r\nhatred rose from the crowd, and the king’s attorney and the examining\r\nmagistrate set about drawing up a report of the suicide.\r\n\r\nNow that all was over and there was no longer any question of saving the\r\nmarshal, M. Moulin desired at least to save the valuables which he had\r\nin his carriage. He found in a cash box 40,000 francs, in the pockets a\r\nsnuff-box set with diamonds, and a pair of pistols and two swords; the\r\nhilt of one of these latter was studded with precious stones, a gift\r\nfrom the ill-starred Selim. M. Moulin returned across the court,\r\ncarrying these things. The Damascus blade was wrenched from his hands,\r\nand the robber kept it five years as a trophy, and it was not until the\r\nyear 1820 that he was forced to give it up to the representative of the\r\nmarshal’s widow. Yet this man was an officer, and kept his rank all\r\nthrough the Restoration, and was not dismissed the army till 1830. When\r\nM. Moulin had placed the other objects in safety, he requested the\r\nmagistrate to have the corpse removed, as he wished the crowds to\r\ndisperse, that he might look after the aides-de camp. While they were\r\nundressing the marshal, in order to certify the cause of death, a\r\nleathern belt was found on him containing 5536 francs. The body was\r\ncarried downstairs by the grave-diggers without any opposition being\r\noffered, but hardly had they advanced ten yards into the square when\r\nshouts of \"To the Rhone! to the Rhone!\" resounded on all sides. A police\r\nofficer who tried to interfere was knocked down, the bearers were\r\nordered to turn round; they obeyed, and the crowd carried them off\r\ntowards the wooden bridge. When the fourteenth arch was reached, the\r\nbier was torn from the bearers’ hands, and the corpse was flung into the\r\nriver. \"Military honours!\" shouted some one, and all who had guns fired\r\nat the dead body, which was twice struck. \"Tomb of Marshal Brune\" was\r\nthen written on the arch, and the crowd withdrew, and passed the rest of\r\nthe day in holiday-making.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Rhone, refusing to be an accomplice in such a crime, bore\r\naway the corpse, which the assassins believed had been swallowed up for\r\never. Next day it was found on the sandy shore at Tarascon, but the news\r\nof the murder had preceded it, and it was recognised by the wounds, and\r\npushed back again into the waters, which bore it towards the sea.\r\n\r\nThree leagues farther on it stopped again, this time by a grassy bank,\r\nand was found by a man of forty and another of eighteen. They also\r\nrecognised it, but instead of shoving it back into the current, they\r\ndrew it up gently on the bank and carried it to a small property\r\nbelonging to one of them, where they reverently interred it. The elder\r\nof the two was M. de Chartruse, the younger M. Amedee Pichot.\r\n\r\nThe body was exhumed by order of the marshal’s widow, and brought to her\r\ncastle of Saint-Just, in Champagne; she had it embalmed, and placed in a\r\nbedroom adjoining her own, where it remained, covered only by a veil,\r\nuntil the memory of the deceased was cleansed from the accusation of\r\nsuicide by a solemn public trial and judgment. Then only it was finally\r\ninterred, along with the parchment containing the decision of the Court\r\nof Riom.\r\n\r\nThe ruffians who killed Marshal Brune, although they evaded the justice\r\nof men, did not escape the vengeance of God: nearly every one of them\r\ncame to a miserable end. Roquefort and Farges were attacked by strange\r\nand hitherto unknown diseases, recalling the plagues sent by God on the\r\npeoples whom He desired to punish in bygone ages. In the case of Farges,\r\nhis skin dried up and became horny, causing him such intense irritation,\r\nthat as the only means of allaying it he had to be kept buried up to the\r\nneck while still alive. The disease under which Roquefort suffered\r\nseemed to have its seat in the marrow, for his bones by degrees lost all\r\nsolidity and power of resistance, so that his limbs refused to bear his\r\nweight, and he went about the streets crawling like a serpent. Both died\r\nin such dreadful torture that they regretted having escaped the\r\nscaffold, which would have spared them such prolonged agony.\r\n\r\nPointu was condemned to death, in his absence, at the Assizes Court of\r\nLa Drome, for having murdered five people, and was cast off by his own\r\nfaction. For some time his wife, who was infirm and deformed, might be\r\nseen going from house to house asking alms for him, who had been for two\r\nmonths the arbiter of civil war and assassination. Then came a day when\r\nshe ceased her quest, and was seen sitting, her head covered by a black\r\nrag: Pointu was dead, but it was never known where or how. In some\r\ncorner, probably, in the crevice of a rock or in the heart of the\r\nforest, like an old tiger whose talons have been clipped and his teeth\r\ndrawn.\r\n\r\nNaudaud and Magnan were sentenced to the galleys for ten years. Naudaud\r\ndied there, but Magnan finished his time and then became a scavenger,\r\nand, faithful to his vocation as a dealer of death, a poisoner of stray\r\ndogs.\r\n\r\nSome of these cut-throats are still living, and fill good positions,\r\nwearing crosses and epaulets, and, rejoicing in their impunity, imagine\r\nthey have escaped the eye of God.\r\n\r\nWe shall wait and see!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was on Saturday that the white flag was hoisted at Nimes. The next\r\nday a crowd of Catholic peasants from the environs marched into the\r\ncity, to await the arrival of the Royalist army from Beaucaire.\r\nExcitement was at fever heat, the desire of revenge filled every breast,\r\nthe hereditary hatred which had slumbered during the Empire again awoke\r\nstronger than ever. Here I may pause to say that in the account which\r\nfollows of the events which took place about this time, I can only\r\nguarantee the facts and not the dates: I relate everything as it\r\nhappened; but the day on which it happened may sometimes have escaped my\r\nmemory, for it is easier to recollect a murder to which one has been an\r\neye-witness, than to recall the exact date on which it happened.\r\n\r\nThe garrison of Nimes was composed of one battalion of the 13th Regiment\r\nof the line, and another battalion of the 79th Regiment, which not being\r\nup to its full war-strength had been sent to Nimes to complete its\r\nnumbers by enlistment. But after the battle of Waterloo the citizens had\r\ntried to induce the soldiers to desert, so that of the two battalions,\r\neven counting the officers, only about two hundred men remained.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of the proclamation of Napoleon II reached Nimes,\r\nBrigadier-General Malmont, commandant of the department, had him\r\nproclaimed in the city without any disturbance being caused thereby. It\r\nwas not until some days later that a report began to be circulated that\r\na royal army was gathering at Beaucaire, and that the populace would\r\ntake advantage of its arrival to indulge in excesses. In the face of\r\nthis two-fold danger, General Malmont had ordered the regular troops,\r\nand a part of the National Guard of the Hundred Days, to be drawn up\r\nunder arms in the rear of the barracks upon an eminence on which he had\r\nmounted five pieces of ordnance. This disposition was maintained for two\r\ndays and a night, but as the populace remained quiet, the troops\r\nreturned to the barracks and the Guards to their homes.\r\n\r\nBut on Monday a concourse of people, who had heard that the army from\r\nBeaucaire would arrive the next day, made a hostile demonstration before\r\nthe barracks, demanding with shouts and threats that the five cannons\r\nshould be handed over to them. The general and the officers who were\r\nquartered in the town, hearing of the tumult, repaired at once to the\r\nbarracks, but soon came out again, and approaching the crowd tried to\r\npersuade it to disperse, to which the only answer they received was a\r\nshower of bullets. Convinced by this, as he was well acquainted with the\r\ncharacter of the people with whom he had to deal, that the struggle had\r\nbegun in earnest and must be fought out to the bitter end, the general\r\nretreated with his officers, step by step, to the barracks, and having\r\ngot inside the gates, closed and bolted them.\r\n\r\nHe then decided that it was his duty to repulse force by force, for\r\neveryone was determined to defend, at no matter what cost, a position\r\nwhich, from the first moment of revolt, was fraught with such peril. So,\r\nwithout waiting for orders, the soldiers, seeing that some of their\r\nwindows had been broken by shots from without, returned the fire, and,\r\nbeing better marksmen than the townspeople, soon laid many low. Upon\r\nthis the alarmed crowd retired out of musket range, and entrenched\r\nthemselves in some neighbouring houses.\r\n\r\nAbout nine o’clock in the evening, a man bearing something resembling a\r\nwhite flag approached the walls and asked to speak to the general. He\r\nbrought a message inquiring on what terms the troops would consent to\r\nevacuate Nimes. The general sent back word that the conditions were,\r\nthat the troops should be allowed to march out fully armed and with all\r\ntheir baggage; the five guns alone would be left behind. When the forces\r\nreached a certain valley outside the city they would halt, that the men\r\nmight be supplied with means sufficient to enable them either to rejoin\r\nthe regiments to which they belonged, or to return to their own homes.\r\n\r\nAt two o’clock A. M. the same envoy returned, and announced to the\r\ngeneral that the conditions had been accepted with one alteration, which\r\nwas that the troops, before marching out, should lay down their arms.\r\nThe messenger also intimated that if the offer he had brought were not\r\nquickly accepted—say within two hours—the time for capitulation would\r\nhave gone by, and that he would not be answerable for what the people\r\nmight then do in their fury. The general accepted the conditions as\r\namended, and the envoy disappeared.\r\n\r\nWhen the troops heard of the agreement, that they should be disarmed\r\nbefore being allowed to leave the town, their first impulse was to\r\nrefuse to lay down their weapons before a rabble which had run away from\r\na few musket shots; but the general succeeded in soothing their sense of\r\nhumiliation and winning their consent by representing to them that there\r\ncould be nothing dishonourable in an action which prevented the children\r\nof a common fatherland from shedding each other’s blood.\r\n\r\nThe gendarmerie, according to one article of the treaty, were to close\r\nin at, the rear of the evacuating column; and thus hinder the populace\r\nfrom molesting the troops of which it was composed. This was the only\r\nconcession obtained in return for the abandoned arms, and the farce in\r\nquestion was already drawn up in field order, apparently waiting to\r\nescort the troops out of the city.\r\n\r\nAt four o’clock P.M. the troops got ready, each company stacking its\r\narms in the courtyard before: marching out; but hardly had forty or\r\nfifty men passed the gates than fire was opened on them at such close\r\nrange that half of them were killed or disabled at the first volley.\r\nUpon this, those who were still within the walls closed the courtyard\r\ngates, thus cutting off all chance of retreat from their comrades. In\r\nthe event; however, it turned out that several of the latter contrived\r\nto escape with their lives and that they lost nothing through being\r\nprevented from returning; for as soon as the mob saw that ten or twelve\r\nof their victims had slipped through their hands they made a furious\r\nattack on the barracks, burst in the gates, and scaled the walls with\r\nsuch rapidity, that the soldiers had no time to repossess themselves of\r\ntheir muskets, and even had they succeeded in seizing them they would\r\nhave been of little use, as ammunition was totally wanting. The barracks\r\nbeing thus carried by assault, a horrible massacre ensued, which lasted\r\nfor three hours. Some of the wretched men, being hunted from room to\r\nroom, jumped out of the first window they could reach, without stopping\r\nto measure its height from the ground, and were either impaled on the\r\nbayonets held in readiness below, or, falling on the pavement, broke\r\ntheir limbs and were pitilessly despatched.\r\n\r\nThe gendarmes, who had really been called out to protect the retreat of\r\nthe garrison, seemed to imagine they were there to witness a judicial\r\nexecution, and stood immovable and impassive while these horrid deeds\r\nwent on before their eyes. But the penalty of this indifference was\r\nswiftly exacted, for as soon as the soldiers were all done with, the\r\nmob, finding their thirst for blood still unslacked, turned on the\r\ngendarmes, the greater number of whom were wounded, while all lost their\r\nhorses, and some their lives.\r\n\r\nThe populace was still engaged at its bloody task when news came that\r\nthe army from Beaucaire was within sight of the town, and the murderers,\r\nhastening to despatch some of the wounded who still showed signs of\r\nlife, went forth to meet the long expected reinforcements.\r\n\r\nOnly those who saw the advancing army with their own eyes can form any\r\nidea of its condition and appearance, the first corps excepted. This\r\ncorps was commanded by M. de Barre, who had put himself at its head with\r\nthe noble purpose of preventing, as far as he could, massacre and\r\npillage. In this he was seconded by the officers under him, who were\r\nactuated by the same philanthropic motives as their general in\r\nidentifying themselves with the corps. Owing to their exertions, the men\r\nadvanced in fairly regular order, and good discipline was maintained.\r\nAll the men carried muskets.\r\n\r\nBut the first corps was only a kind of vanguard to the second, which was\r\nthe real army, and a wonderful thing to see and hear. Never were brought\r\ntogether before or since so many different kinds of howl, so many\r\nthreats of death, so many rags; so many odd weapons, from the matchlock\r\nof the time of the Michelade to the steel-tipped goad of the bullock\r\ndrovers of La Camargue, so that when the Nimes mob; which in all\r\nconscience was howling and ragged enough, rushed out to offer a\r\nbrotherly welcome to the strangers, its first feeling was one of\r\nastonishment and dismay as it caught sight of the motley crew which held\r\nout to it the right hand of fellowship.\r\n\r\nThe new-comers soon showed that it was through necessity and not choice\r\nthat their outer man presented such a disreputable appearance; for they\r\nwere hardly well within the gates before demanding that the houses of\r\nthe members of the old Protestant National Guard should be pointed out\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nThis being done, they promptly proceeded to exact from each household a\r\nmusket, a coat, a complete kit, or a sum of money, according to their\r\nhumour, so that before evening those who had arrived naked and penniless\r\nwere provided with complete uniforms and had money in their pockets.\r\nThese exactions were levied under the name of a contribution, but before\r\nthe day was ended naked and undisguised pillage began.\r\n\r\nSomeone asserted that during the assault on the barracks a certain\r\nindividual had fired out of a certain house on the assailants. The\r\nindignant people now rushed to the house indicated, and soon left\r\nnothing of it in existence but its walls. A little later it was clearly\r\nproved that the individual accused was quite innocent of the crime laid\r\nto his charge.\r\n\r\nThe house of a rich merchant lay in the path of the advancing army. A\r\ncry arose that the owner was a Bonapartist, and nothing more was needed.\r\nThe house was broken into and pillaged, and the furniture thrown out of\r\nthe windows.\r\n\r\nTwo days later it turned out that not only was the merchant no\r\nBonapartist, but that his son had been one of those who had accompanied\r\nthe Duc d’Angouleme to Cette when he left the country. The pillagers\r\nexcused themselves by saying they had been misled by a resemblance\r\nbetween two names, and this excuse, as far as appears, was accepted as\r\nvalid by the authorities.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the populace of Nimes began to think they might\r\nas well follow the example set them by their brothers from Beaucaire. In\r\ntwenty-four hours free companies were formed, headed by Trestaillons,\r\nTrupheny, Graffan, and Morinet. These bands arrogated to themselves the\r\ntitle of National Guard, and then what took place at Marseilles in the\r\nexcitement of the moment was repeated at Nimes with deliberation and\r\nmethod, inspired by hate and the desire of vengeance. A revolt broke out\r\nwhich followed the ordinary course: first pillage, then fire, then\r\nmurder, laid waste the city.\r\n\r\n  M. V______’s house, which stood in the middle of the town, was sacked\r\n     and then burnt to the ground, without a hand being raised to\r\n     prevent the crime.\r\n\r\n  M. T______’s house, on the road to Montpellier, was sacked and wrecked\r\n     and a bonfire made of the furniture, round which the crowd danced;\r\n     as if it had been an occasion of public rejoicing. Then cries were\r\n     raised for the proprietor, that he might be killed, and as he could\r\n     not be found the baffled fury of the mob vented itself on the dead.\r\n     A child three months buried was dragged from its grave, drawn by\r\n     the feet through the sewers and wayside puddles, and then flung on\r\n     a dung-heap; and, strange to say, while incendiarism and sacrilege\r\n     thus ran riot, the mayor of the place slept so sound that when he\r\n     awoke he was \"quite astonished,\" to use his own expression, to hear\r\n     what had taken place during the night.\r\n\r\nThis expedition completed, the same company which had brought this\r\nexpedition to a successful issue next turned their attention to a small\r\ncountry house occupied by a widow, whom I had often begged to take\r\nrefuge with us. But, secure in her insignificance, she had always\r\ndeclined our offers, preferring to live solitary and retired in her own\r\nhome. But the freebooters sought her out, burst in her doors, drove her\r\naway with blows and insults, destroyed her house and burnt her\r\nfurniture. They then proceeded to the vault in which lay the remains of\r\nher family, dragged them out of their coffins and scattered them about\r\nthe fields. The next day the poor woman-ventured back, collected the\r\ndesecrated remains with pious care, and replaced them in the vault. But\r\nthis was counted to her as a crime; the company returned, once more cast\r\nforth the contents of the coffins, and threatened to kill her should she\r\ndare to touch them again. She was often seen in the days that followed\r\nshedding bitter tears and watching over the sacred relics as they lay\r\nexposed on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe name of this widow was Pepin, and the scene of the sacrilege was a\r\nsmall enclosure on the hill of the Moulins-a-Vent.\r\n\r\nMeantime the people in the Faubourg des Bourgades had invented a new\r\nsort of game, or rather, had resolved to vary the serious business of\r\nthe drama that was being enacted by the introduction of comic scenes.\r\nThey had possessed themselves of a number of beetles such as washerwomen\r\nuse, and hammered in long nails, the points of which projected an inch\r\non the other side in the form of a fleur-de-lis. Every Protestant who\r\nfell into their hands, no matter what his age or rank, was stamped with\r\nthe bloody emblem, serious wounds being inflicted in many cases.\r\n\r\nMurders were now becoming common. Amongst other names of victims\r\nmentioned were Loriol, Bigot, Dumas, Lhermet, Heritier, Domaison, Combe,\r\nClairon, Begomet, Poujas, Imbert, Vigal, Pourchet, Vignole. Details more\r\nor less shocking came to light as to the manner in which the murderers\r\nwent to work. A man called Dalbos was in the custody of two armed men;\r\nsome others came to consult with them. Dalbos appealed for mercy to the\r\nnew-comers. It was granted, but as he turned to go he was shot dead.\r\nAnother of the name of Rambert tried to escape by disguising himself as\r\na woman, but was recognised and shot down a few yards outside his own\r\ndoor. A gunner called Saussine was walking in all security along the\r\nroad to Uzes, pipe in mouth, when he was met by five men belonging to\r\nTrestaillon’s company, who surrounded him and stabbed him to the heart\r\nwith their knives. The elder of two brothers named Chivas ran across\r\nsome fields to take shelter in a country house called Rouviere, which,\r\nunknown to him, had been occupied by some of the new National Guard.\r\nThese met him on the threshold and shot him dead.\r\n\r\nRant was seized in his own house and shot. Clos was met by a company,\r\nand seeing Trestaillons, with whom he had always been friends, in its\r\nranks, he went up to him and held out his hand; whereupon Trestaillons\r\ndrew a pistol from his belt and blew his brains out. Calandre being\r\nchased down the rue des Soeurs-Grises, sought shelter in a tavern, but\r\nwas forced to come out, and was killed with sabres. Courbet was sent to\r\nprison under the escort of some men, but these changed their minds on\r\nthe way as to his punishment, halted, and shot him dead in the middle of\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\nA wine merchant called Cabanot, who was flying from Trestaillons, ran\r\ninto a house in which there was a venerable priest called Cure Bonhomme.\r\nWhen the cut-throat rushed in, all covered with blood, the priest\r\nadvanced and stopped him, crying:\r\n\r\n\"What will happen, unhappy man, when you come to the confessional with\r\nblood-stained hands?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pooh!\" replied Trestaillons, \"you must put on your wide gown; the\r\nsleeves are large enough to let everything pass.\"\r\n\r\nTo the short account given above of so many murders I will add the\r\nnarrative of one to which I was an eye-witness, and which made the most\r\nterrible impression on me of, anything in my experience.\r\n\r\nIt was midnight. I was working beside my wife’s bed; she was just\r\nbecoming drowsy, when a noise in the distance caught our attention. It\r\ngradually became more distinct, and drums began to beat the ’generale’\r\nin every direction. Hiding my own alarm for fear of increasing hers, I\r\nanswered my wife, who was asking what new thing was about to happen,\r\nthat it was probably troops marching in or out of garrison. But soon\r\nreports of firearms, accompanied by an uproar with which we were so\r\nfamiliar that we could no longer mistake its meaning, were heard\r\noutside. Opening my window, I heard bloodcurdling imprecations, mixed\r\nwith cries of \"Long live the king!\" going on. Not being able to remain\r\nany longer in this uncertainty, I woke a captain who lived in the same\r\nhouse. He rose, took his arms, and we went out together, directing our\r\ncourse towards the point whence the shouts seemed to come. The moon\r\nshone so bright that we could see everything almost as distinctly as in\r\nbroad daylight.\r\n\r\nA concourse of people was hurrying towards the Cours yelling like\r\nmadmen; the greater number of them, half naked, armed with muskets,\r\nswords, knives, and clubs, and swearing to exterminate everything, waved\r\ntheir weapons above the heads of men who had evidently been torn from\r\ntheir houses and brought to the square to be put to death. The rest of\r\nthe crowd had, like ourselves, been drawn thither by curiosity, and were\r\nasking what was going on. \"Murder is abroad,\" was the answer; \"several\r\npeople have been killed in the environs, and the patrol has been fired\r\non.\" While this questioning was going on the noise continued to\r\nincrease. As I had really no business to be on a spot where such things\r\nwere going on, and feeling that my place was at my wife’s side, to\r\nreassure her for the present and to watch over her should the rioters\r\ncome our way, I said good-bye to the captain, who went on to the\r\nbarracks, and took the road back to the suburb in which I lived.\r\n\r\nI was not more than fifty steps from our house when I heard loud talking\r\nbehind me, and, turning, saw gun barrels glittering in the moonlight. As\r\nthe speakers seemed to be rapidly approaching me, I kept close in the\r\nshadow of the houses till I reached my own door, which I laid softly to\r\nbehind me, leaving myself a chink by which I could peep out and watch\r\nthe movements of the group which was drawing near. Suddenly I felt\r\nsomething touch my hand; it was a great Corsican dog, which was turned\r\nloose at night, and was so fierce that it was a great protection to our\r\nhouse. I felt glad to have it at my side, for in case of a struggle it\r\nwould be no despicable ally.\r\n\r\nThose approaching turned out to be three armed men leading a fourth,\r\ndisarmed and a prisoner. They all stopped just opposite my door, which I\r\ngently closed and locked, but as I still wished to see what they were\r\nabout, I slipped into the garden, which lay towards the street, still\r\nfollowed by my dog. Contrary to his habit, and as if he understood the\r\ndanger, he gave a low whine instead of his usual savage growl. I climbed\r\ninto a fig tree the branches of which overhung the street, and, hidden\r\nby the leaves, and resting my hands on the top of the wall, I leaned far\r\nenough forward to see what the men were about.\r\n\r\nThey were still on the same spot, but there was a change in their\r\npositions. The prisoner was now kneeling with clasped hands before the\r\ncut-throats, begging for his life for the sake of his wife and children,\r\nin heartrending accents, to which his executioners replied in mocking\r\ntones, \"We have got you at last into our hands, have we? You dog of a\r\nBonapartist, why do you not call on your emperor to come and help you\r\nout of this scrape?\" The unfortunate man’s entreaties became more\r\npitiful and their mocking replies more pitiless. They levelled their\r\nmuskets at him several times, and then lowered them, saying; \"Devil take\r\nit, we won’t shoot yet; let us give him time to see death coming,\" till\r\nat last the poor wretch, seeing there was no hope of mercy, begged to be\r\nput out of his misery.\r\n\r\nDrops of sweat stood on my forehead. I felt my pockets to see if I had\r\nnothing on me which I could use as a weapon, but I had not even a knife.\r\nI looked at my dog; he was lying flat at the foot of the tree, and\r\nappeared to be a prey to the most abject terror. The prisoner continued\r\nhis supplications, and the assassins their threats and mockery. I\r\nclimbed quietly down out of the fig tree, intending to fetch my pistols.\r\nMy dog followed me with his eyes, which seemed to be the only living\r\nthings about him. Just as my foot touched the ground a double report\r\nrang out, and my dog gave a plaintive and prolonged howl. Feeling that\r\nall was over, and that no weapons could be of any use, I climbed up\r\nagain into my perch and looked out. The poor wretch was lying face\r\ndownwards writhing in his blood; the assassins were reloading their\r\nmuskets as they walked away.\r\n\r\nBeing anxious to see if it was too late to help the man whom I had not\r\nbeen able to save, I went out into the street and bent over him. He was\r\nbloody, disfigured, dying, but was yet alive, uttering dismal groans. I\r\ntried to lift him up, but soon saw that the wounds which he had received\r\nfrom bullets fired at close range were both mortal, one being in the\r\nhead, and the other in the loins. Just then a patrol, of the National\r\nGuard turned round the corner of the street. This, instead of being a\r\nrelief, awoke me to a sense of my danger, and feeling I could do nothing\r\nfor the wounded man, for the death rattle had already begun, I entered\r\nmy house, half shut the door, and listened.\r\n\r\n\"Qui vive?\" asked the corporal.\r\n\r\n\"Idiot!\" said someone else, \"to ask ’Qui vive?’ of a dead man!\"\r\n\r\n\"He is not dead,\" said a third voice; \"listen to him singing\"; and\r\nindeed the poor fellow in his agony was giving utterance to dreadful\r\ngroans.\r\n\r\n\"Someone has tickled him well,\" said a fourth, \"but what does it matter?\r\nWe had better finish the job.\"\r\n\r\nFive or six musket shots followed, and the groans ceased.\r\n\r\nThe name of the man who had just expired was Louis Lichaire; it was not\r\nagainst him, but against his nephew, that the assassins had had a\r\ngrudge, but finding the nephew out when they burst into the house, and a\r\nvictim being indispensable, they had torn the uncle from the arms of his\r\nwife, and, dragging him towards the citadel, had killed him as I have\r\njust related.\r\n\r\nVery early next morning I sent to three commissioners of police, one\r\nafter the other, for permission to have the corpse carried to the\r\nhospital, but these gentlemen were either not up or had already gone\r\nout, so that it was not until eleven o’clock and after repeated\r\napplications that they condescended to give me the needed authorisation.\r\n\r\nThanks to this delay, the whole town came to see the body of the\r\nunfortunate man. Indeed, the day which followed a massacre was always\r\nkept as a holiday, everyone leaving his work undone and coming out to\r\nstare at the slaughtered victims. In this case, a man wishing to amuse\r\nthe crowd took his pipe out of his mouth and put it between the teeth of\r\nthe corpse—a joke which had a marvellous success, those present\r\nshrieking with laughter.\r\n\r\nMany murders had been committed during the night; the companies had\r\nscoured the streets singing some doggerel, which one of the bloody\r\nwretches, being in poetic vein, had composed, the chorus of which was:\r\n\r\n    \"Our work's well done,\r\n     We spare none!\"\r\n\r\nSeventeen fatal outrages were committed, and yet neither the reports of\r\nthe firearms nor the cries of the victims broke the peaceful slumbers of\r\nM. le Prefet and M. le Commissaire General de la Police. But if the\r\ncivil authorities slept, General Lagarde, who had shortly before come to\r\ntown to take command of the city in the name of the king, was awake. He\r\nhad sprung from his bed at the first shot, dressed himself, and made a\r\nround of the posts; then sure that everything was in order, he had\r\nformed patrols of chasseurs, and had himself, accompanied by two\r\nofficers only, gone wherever he heard cries for help. But in spite of\r\nthe strictness of his orders the small number of troops at his\r\ndisposition delayed the success of his efforts, and it was not until\r\nthree o’clock in the morning that he succeeded in securing Trestaillons.\r\nWhen this man was taken he was dressed as usual in the uniform of the\r\nNational Guard, with a cocked hat and captain’s epaulets. General\r\nLagarde ordered the gens d’armes who made the capture to deprive him of\r\nhis sword and carbine, but it was only after a long struggle that they\r\ncould carry out this order, for Trestaillons protested that he would\r\nonly give up his carbine with his life. However, he was at last obliged\r\nto yield to numbers, and when disarmed was removed to the barracks; but\r\nas there could be no peace in the town as long as he was in it, the\r\ngeneral sent him to the citadel of Montpellier next morning before it\r\nwas light.\r\n\r\nThe disorders did not, however, cease at once. At eight o’clock A.M.\r\nthey were still going on, the mob seeming to be animated by the spirit\r\nof Trestaillons, for while the soldiers were occupied in a distant\r\nquarter of the town a score of men broke into the house of a certain\r\nScipion Chabrier, who had remained hidden from his enemies for a long\r\ntime, but who had lately returned home on the strength of the\r\nproclamations published by General Lagarde when he assumed the position\r\nof commandant of the town. He had indeed been sure that the disturbances\r\nin Nimes were over, when they burst out with redoubled fury on the 16th\r\nof October; on the morning of the 17th he was working quietly at home at\r\nhis trade of a silk weaver, when, alarmed by the shouts of a parcel of\r\ncut-throats outside his house, he tried to escape. He succeeded in\r\nreaching the \"Coupe d’Or,\" but the ruffians followed him, and the first\r\nwho came up thrust him through the thigh with his bayonet. In\r\nconsequence of this wound he fell from top to bottom of the staircase,\r\nwas seized and dragged to the stables, where the assassins left him for\r\ndead, with seven wounds in his body.\r\n\r\nThis was, however, the only murder committed that day in the town,\r\nthanks to the vigilance and courage of General Lagarde.\r\n\r\nThe next day a considerable crowd gathered, and a noisy deputation went\r\nto General Lagarde’s quarters and insolently demanded that Trestaillons\r\nshould be set at liberty. The general ordered them to disperse, but no\r\nattention was paid to this command, whereupon he ordered his soldiers to\r\ncharge, and in a moment force accomplished what long-continued\r\npersuasion had failed to effect. Several of the ringleaders were\r\narrested and taken to prison.\r\n\r\nThus, as we shall see, the struggle assumed a new phase: resistance to\r\nthe royal power was made in the name of the royal power, and both those\r\nwho broke or those who tried to maintain the public peace used the same\r\ncry, \"Long live the king!\"\r\n\r\nThe firm attitude assumed by General Lagarde restored Nimes to a state\r\nof superficial peace, beneath which, however, the old enmities were\r\nfermenting. An occult power, which betrayed itself by a kind of passive\r\nresistance, neutralised the effect of the measures taken by the military\r\ncommandant. He soon became cognisant of the fact that the essence of\r\nthis sanguinary political strife was an hereditary religious animosity,\r\nand in order to strike a last blow at this, he resolved, after having\r\nreceived permission from the king, to grant the general request of the\r\nProtestants by reopening their places of worship, which had been closed\r\nfor more than four months, and allowing the public exercise of the\r\nProtestant religion, which had been entirely suspended in the city for\r\nthe same length of time.\r\n\r\nFormerly there had been six Protestant pastors resident in Nimes, but\r\nfour of them, had fled; the two who remained were MM. Juillerat and\r\nOlivier Desmonts, the first a young man, twenty-eight years of age, the\r\nsecond an old man of seventy.\r\n\r\nThe entire weight of the ministry had fallen during this period of\r\nproscription on M. Juillerat, who had accepted the task and religiously\r\nfulfilled it. It seemed as if a special providence had miraculously\r\nprotected him in the midst of the many perils which beset his path.\r\nAlthough the other pastor, M. Desmonts, was president of the Consistory,\r\nhis life was in much less danger; for, first, he had reached an age\r\nwhich almost everywhere commands respect, and then he had a son who was\r\na lieutenant in, one of the royal corps levied at Beaucaire, who\r\nprotected him by his name when he could not do so by his presence. M.\r\nDesmonts had therefore little cause for anxiety as to his safety either\r\nin the streets of Nimes or on the road between that and his country\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nBut, as we have said, it was not so with M. Juillerat. Being young and\r\nactive, and having an unfaltering trust in God, on him alone devolved\r\nall the sacred duties of his office, from the visitation of the sick and\r\ndying to the baptism of the newly born. These latter were often brought\r\nto him at night to be baptized, and he consented, though unwillingly, to\r\nmake this concession, feeling that if he insisted on the performance of\r\nthe rite by day he would compromise not only his own safety but that of\r\nothers. In all that concerned him personally, such as consoling the\r\ndying or caring for the wounded, he acted quite openly, and no danger\r\nthat he encountered on his way ever caused him to flinch from the path\r\nof duty.\r\n\r\nOne day, as M. Juillerat was passing through the rue des Barquettes on\r\nhis way to the prefecture to transact some business connected with his\r\nministry, he saw several men lying in wait in a blind alley by which he\r\nhad to pass. They had their guns pointed at him. He continued his way\r\nwith tranquil step and such an air of resignation that the assassins\r\nwere overawed, and lowered their weapons as he approached, without\r\nfiring a single shot. When M. Juillerat reached the prefecture, thinking\r\nthat the prefect ought to be aware of everything connected with the\r\npublic order, he related this incident to M. d’Arbaud-Jouques, but the\r\nlatter did not think the affair of enough importance to require any\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nIt was, as will be seen, a difficult enterprise to open once again the\r\nProtestant places of worship, which had been so long closed, in present\r\ncircumstances, and in face of the fact that the civil authorities\r\nregarded such a step with disfavour, but General Lagarde was one of\r\nthose determined characters who always act up to their convictions.\r\nMoreover, to prepare people’s minds for this stroke of religious policy,\r\nhe relied on the help of the Duc d’Angouleme, who in the course of a\r\ntour through the South was almost immediately expected at Nimes.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of November the prince made his entry into the city, and\r\nhaving read the reports of the general to the King Louis XVIII, and\r\nhaving received positive injunctions from his uncle to pacify the\r\nunhappy provinces which he was about to visit, he arrived full of the\r\ndesire to displays whether he felt it or not, a perfect impartiality; so\r\nwhen the delegates from the Consistory were presented to him, not only\r\ndid he receive them most graciously, but he was the first to speak of\r\nthe interests of their faith, assuring them that it was only a few days\r\nsince he had learned with much regret that their religious services had\r\nbeen; suspended since the 16th of July. The delegates replied that in\r\nsuch a time of agitation the closing of their places of worship was, a\r\nmeasure of prudence which they had felt ought to be borne, and which had\r\nbeen borne, with resignation. The prince expressed his approval of this\r\nattitude with regard to the past, but said that his presence was a\r\nguarantee for the future, and that on Thursday the 9th inst. the two\r\nmeeting-houses should be reopened and restored to their proper use. The\r\nProtestants were alarmed at, having a favour accorded to them which was\r\nmuch more than they would have dared to ask and for which they were\r\nhardly prepared. But the prince reassured them by saying that all\r\nneedful measures would be taken to provide against any breach of the\r\npublic peace, and at the same time invited M. Desmonts, president, and\r\nM. Roland-Lacoste, member of the Consistory, to dine with him.\r\n\r\nThe next deputation to arrive was a Catholic one, and its object was to\r\nask that Trestaillons might be set at liberty. The prince was so\r\nindignant at this request that his only answer was to turn his back on\r\nthose who proffered it.\r\n\r\nThe next day the duke, accompanied by General Lagarde, left for\r\nMontpellier; and as it was on the latter that the Protestants placed\r\ntheir sole reliance for the maintenance of those rights guaranteed for\r\nthe future by the word of the prince, they hesitated to take any new\r\nstep in his absence, and let the 9th of November go by without\r\nattempting to resume public worship, preferring to wait for the return\r\nof their protector, which took place on Saturday evening the 11th of\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\nWhen the general got back, his first thought was to ask if the commands\r\nof the prince had been carried out, and when he heard that they had not,\r\nwithout waiting to hear a word in justification of the delay, he sent a\r\npositive order to the president of the Consistory to open both places of\r\nworship the next morning.\r\n\r\nUpon this, the president carrying self-abnegation and prudence to their\r\nextreme limits, went to the general’s quarters, and having warmly\r\nthanked him, laid before him the dangers to which he would expose\r\nhimself by running counter to the opinions of those who had had their\r\nown way in the city for the last four months. But General Lagarde\r\nbrushed all these considerations aside: he had received an order from\r\nthe prince, and to a man of his military cast of mind no course was open\r\nbut to carry that order out.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the president again expressed his doubts and fears.\r\n\r\n\"I will answer with my head,\" said the general, \"that nothing happens.\"\r\nStill the president counselled prudence, asking that only one place of\r\nworship at first be opened, and to this the general gave his consent.\r\n\r\nThis continued resistance to the re-establishment of public worship on\r\nthe part of those who most eagerly desired it enabled the general at\r\nlast to realise the extent of the danger which would be incurred by the\r\ncarrying out of this measure, and he at once took all possible\r\nprecautions. Under the pretext that he was going to-have a general\r\nreview, he brought the entire civil and military forces of Nimes under\r\nhis authority, determined, if necessary, to use the one to suppress the\r\nother. As early as eight o’clock in the morning a guard of gens d’armes\r\nwas stationed at the doors of the meeting-house, while other members of\r\nthe same force took up their positions in the adjacent streets. On the\r\nother hand, the Consistory had decided that the doors were to be opened\r\nan hour sooner than usual, that the bells were not to be rung, and that\r\nthe organ should be silent.\r\n\r\nThese precautions had both a good and a bad side. The gens d’armes at\r\nthe door of the meetinghouse gave if not a promise of security at least\r\na promise of support, but they showed to the citizens of the other party\r\nwhat was about to be done; so before nine o’clock groups of Catholics\r\nbegan to form, and as it happened to be Sunday the inhabitants of the\r\nneighbouring villages arriving constantly by twos and threes soon united\r\nthese groups into a little army. Thus the streets leading to the church\r\nbeing thronged, the Protestants who pushed their way through were\r\ngreeted with insulting remarks, and even the president of the\r\nConsistory, whose white, hair and dignified expression had no effect\r\nupon the mob, heard the people round him saying, \"These brigands of\r\nProtestants are going again to their temple, but we shall soon give them\r\nenough of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe anger of the populace soon grows hot; between the first bubble and\r\nthe boiling-point the interval is short. Threats spoken in a low voice\r\nwere soon succeeded by noisy objurgations. Women, children, and men\r\nbrake out into yells, \"Down with the broilers!\" (for this was one of the\r\nnames by which the Protestants were designated). \"Down with the\r\nbroilers! We do not want to see them using our churches: let them give\r\nus back our churches; let them give us back our churches, and go to the\r\ndesert. Out with them! Out with them! To the desert! To the desert!\"\r\n\r\nAs the crowd did not go beyond words, however insulting, and as the\r\nProtestants were long inured to much worse things, they plodded along to\r\ntheir meeting-house, humble and silent, and went in, undeterred by the\r\ndispleasure they aroused, whereupon the service commenced.\r\n\r\nBut some Catholics went in with them, and soon the same shouts which had\r\nbeen heard without were heard also within. The general, however, was on\r\nthe alert, and as soon as the shouts arose inside the gens d’armes\r\nentered the church and arrested those who had caused the disturbance.\r\nThe crowds tried to rescue them on their way to prison, but the general\r\nappeared at the head of imposing forces, at the sight of which they\r\ndesisted. An apparent calm succeeded the tumult, and the public worship\r\nwent on without further interruption.\r\n\r\nThe general, misled by appearances, went off himself to attend a\r\nmilitary mass, and at eleven o’clock returned to his quarters for lunch.\r\nHis absence was immediately perceived and taken advantage of. In the:\r\ntwinkling of an eye, the crowds, which had dispersed, gathered together\r\nin even greater numbers and the Protestants, seeing themselves once more\r\nin danger, shut the doors from within, while the gens d’armes guarded\r\nthem without. The populace pressed so closely round the gens d’armes,\r\nand assumed such a threatening attitude, that fearing he and his men\r\nwould not be able to hold their own in such a throng, the captain\r\nordered M. Delbose, one of his officers, to ride off and warn the\r\ngeneral. He forced his way through the crowd with great trouble, and\r\nwent off at a gallop. On seeing this, the people felt there was no time\r\nto be lost; they knew of what kind the general was, and that he would be\r\non the spot in a quarter of an hour. A large crowd is invincible through\r\nits numbers; it has only to press forward, and everything gives way,\r\nmen, wood, iron. At this moment the crowd, swayed by a common impulse,\r\nswept forward, the gens d’armes and their horses were crushed against\r\nthe wall, doors gave way, and instantly with a tremendous roar a living\r\nwave flooded the church. Cries of terror and frightful imprecations were\r\nheard on all sides, everyone made a weapon of whatever came to hand,\r\nchairs and benches were hurled about, the disorder was at its height; it\r\nseemed as if the days of the Michelade and the Bagarre were about to\r\nreturn, when suddenly the news of a terrible event was spread abroad,\r\nand assailants and assailed paused in horror. General Lagarde had just\r\nbeen assassinated.\r\n\r\nAs the crowd had foreseen, no sooner did the messenger deliver his\r\nmessage than the general sprang on his horse, and, being too brave, or\r\nperhaps too scornful, to fear such foes, he waited for no escort, but,\r\naccompanied by two or three officers, set off at full gallop towards the\r\nscene of the tumult. He had passed through the narrow streets which led\r\nto the meeting-house by pushing the crowd aside with his horse’s chest,\r\nwhen, just as he got out into the open square, a young man named\r\nBoisson, a sergeant in the Nimes National Guard, came up and seemed to\r\nwish to speak to him. The general seeing a man in uniform, bent down\r\nwithout a thought of danger to listen to what he had to say, whereupon\r\nBoisson drew a pistol out and fired at him. The ball broke the\r\ncollar-bone and lodged in the neck behind the carotid artery, and the\r\ngeneral fell from his horse.\r\n\r\nThe news of this crime had a strange and unexpected effect; however\r\nexcited and frenzied the crowd was, it instantly realised the\r\nconsequences of this act. It was no longer like the murder of Marshal\r\nBrune at Avignon or General Ramel at Toulouse, an act of vengeance on a\r\nfavourite of Napoleon, but open and armed rebellion against the king. It\r\nwas not a simple murder, it was high treason.\r\n\r\nA feeling of the utmost terror spread through the town; only a few\r\nfanatics went on howling in the church, which the Protestants, fearing\r\nstill greater disasters, had by this time resolved to abandon. The first\r\nto come out was President Olivier Desmonts, accompanied by M.\r\nVallongues, who had only just arrived in the city, but who had\r\nimmediately hurried to the spot at the call of duty.\r\n\r\n  M. Juillerat, his two children in his arms, walked behind them,\r\n     followed by all the other worshippers. At first the crowd,\r\n     threatening and ireful, hooted and threw stones at them, but at the\r\n     voice of the mayor and the dignified aspect of the president they\r\n     allowed them to pass. During this strange retreat over eighty\r\n     Protestants were wounded, but not fatally, except a young girl\r\n     called Jeannette Cornilliere, who had been so beaten and ill-used\r\n     that she died of her injuries a few days later.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the momentary slackening of energy which followed the\r\nassassination of General Lagarde, the Catholics did not remain long in a\r\nstate of total inaction. During the rest of the day the excited populace\r\nseemed as if shaken by an earthquake. About six o’clock in the evening,\r\nsome of the most desperate characters in the town possessed themselves\r\nof a hatchet, and, taking their way to the Protestant church, smashed\r\nthe doors, tore the pastors’ gowns, rifled the poor-box, and pulled the\r\nbooks to pieces. A detachment of troops arrived just in time to prevent\r\ntheir setting the building on fire.\r\n\r\nThe next day passed more quietly. This time the disorders were of too\r\nimportant a nature for the prefect to ignore, as he had ignored so many\r\nbloody acts in the past; so in due time a full report was laid before\r\nthe king. It became known the same evening that General Lagarde was still\r\nliving, and that those around him hoped that the wound would not prove\r\nmortal. Dr. Delpech, who had been summoned from Montpellier, had\r\nsucceeded in extracting the bullet, and though he spoke no word of hope,\r\nhe did not expressly declare that the case was hopeless.\r\n\r\nTwo days later everything in the town had assumed its ordinary aspect,\r\nand on the 21st of November the king issued the following edict:—\r\n\r\n\"Louis, by the grace of God, King of France and of Navarre,\r\n\r\n\"To all those to whom these presents shall come, greeting:\r\n\r\n\"An abominable crime has cast a stain on Our city of Nimes. A seditious\r\nmob has dared to oppose the opening of the Protestant place of worship,\r\nin contempt of the constitutional charter, which while it recognises the\r\nCatholic religion as the religion of the State, guarantees to the other\r\nreligious bodies protection and freedom of worship. Our military\r\ncommandant, whilst trying to disperse these crowds by gentle means\r\nbefore having resort to force, was shot down, and his assassin has till\r\nnow successfully evaded the arm of the law. If such an outrage were to\r\nremain unpunished, the maintenance of good government and public order\r\nwould be impossible, and Our ministers would be guilty of neglecting the\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n\"Wherefore We have ordered and do order as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Art. 1. Proceedings shall be commenced without delay by Our attorney,\r\nand the attorney-general, against the perpetrator of the murderous\r\nattack on the person of Sieur Lagarde, and against the authors,\r\ninstigators, and accomplices of the insurrection which took place in the\r\ncity of Nimes on the 12th of the present month.\r\n\r\n\"Art. 2. A sufficient number of troops shall be quartered in the said\r\ncity, and shall remain there at the cost of the inhabitants, until the\r\nassassin and his accomplices have been produced before a court of law.\r\n\r\n\"Art. 3. All those citizens whose names are not entitled to be on the\r\nroll of the National Guard shall be disarmed.\r\n\r\n\"Our Keeper of the Seals, Our Minister of War, Our Minister of the\r\nInterior, and Our Minister of Police, are entrusted with the execution\r\nof this edict.\r\n\r\n\"Given at Paris at Our Castle of the Tuileries on the 21st of November\r\nin the year of grace 1815, and of Our reign the 21st.\r\n\r\n\"(Signed) Louis\"\r\n\r\nBoissin was acquitted.\r\n\r\nThis was the last crime committed in the South, and it led fortunately\r\nto no reprisals.\r\n\r\nThree months after the murderous attempt to which he had so nearly\r\nfallen a victim, General Lagarde left Nimes with the rank of ambassador,\r\nand was succeeded as prefect by M. d’Argont.\r\n\r\nDuring the firm, just, and independent administration of the latter, the\r\ndisarming of the citizens decreed by the royal edict was carried out\r\nwithout bloodshed.\r\n\r\nThrough his influence, MM. Chabot-Latour, Saint-Aulaire, and Lascour\r\nwere elected to the Chamber of Deputies in place of MM. De Calviere, De\r\nVogue, and De Trinquelade.\r\n\r\nAnd down to the present time the name of M. d’Argont is held in\r\nveneration at Nimes, as if he had only quitted the city yesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*MARY STUART—1587*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nSome royal names are predestined to misfortune: in France, there is the\r\nname \"Henry\". Henry I was poisoned, Henry II was killed in a tournament,\r\nHenry III and Henry IV were assassinated. As to Henry V, for whom the\r\npast is so fatal already, God alone knows what the future has in store\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, the unlucky name is \"Stuart\". Robert I, founder of the\r\nrace, died at twenty-eight of a lingering illness. Robert II, the most\r\nfortunate of the family, was obliged to pass a part of his life, not\r\nmerely in retirement, but also in the dark, on account of inflammation\r\nof the eyes, which made them blood-red. Robert III succumbed to grief,\r\nthe death of one son and the captivity of other. James I was stabbed by\r\nGraham in the abbey of the Black Monks of Perth. James II was killed at\r\nthe siege of Roxburgh, by a splinter from a burst cannon. James III was\r\nassassinated by an unknown hand in a mill, where he had taken refuge\r\nduring the battle of Sauchie. James IV, wounded by two arrows and a blow\r\nfrom a halberd, fell amidst his nobles on the battlefield of Flodden.\r\nJames V died of grief at the loss of his two sons, and of remorse for\r\nthe execution of Hamilton. James VI, destined to unite on his head the\r\ntwo crowns of Scotland and England, son of a father who had been\r\nassassinated, led a melancholy and timorous existence, between the\r\nscaffold of his mother, Mary Stuart, and that of his son, Charles I.\r\nCharles II spent a portion of his life in exile. James II died in it.\r\nThe Chevalier Saint-George, after having been proclaimed King of\r\nScotland as James VIII, and of England and Ireland as James III, was\r\nforced to flee, without having been able to give his arms even the\r\nlustre of a defeat. His son, Charles Edward, after the skirmish at Derby\r\nand the battle of Culloden, hunted from mountain to mountain, pursued\r\nfrom rock to rock, swimming from shore to shore, picked up half naked by\r\na French vessel, betook himself to Florence to die there, without the\r\nEuropean courts having ever consented to recognise him as a sovereign.\r\nFinally, his brother, Henry Benedict, the last heir of the Stuarts,\r\nhaving lived on a pension of three thousand pounds sterling, granted him\r\nby George III, died completely forgotten, bequeathing to the House of\r\nHanover all the crown jewels which James II had carried off when he\r\npassed over to the Continent in 1688—a tardy but complete recognition of\r\nthe legitimacy of the family which had succeeded his.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this unlucky race, Mary Stuart was the favourite of\r\nmisfortune. As Brantome has said of her, \"Whoever desires to write about\r\nthis illustrious queen of Scotland has, in her, two very, large\r\nsubjects, the one her life, the other her death,\" Brantome had known her\r\non one of the most mournful occasions of her life—at the moment when she\r\nwas quitting France for Scotland.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 9th of August, 1561, after having lost her mother and her\r\nhusband in the same year, that Mary Stuart, Dowager of France and Queen\r\nof Scotland at nineteen, escorted by her uncles, Cardinals Guise and\r\nLorraine, by the Duke and Duchess of Guise, by the Duc d’Aumale and M.\r\nde Nemours, arrived at Calais, where two galleys were waiting to take\r\nher to Scotland, one commanded by M. de Mevillon and the other by\r\nCaptain Albize. She remained six days in the town. At last, on the 15th\r\nof the month, after the saddest adieus to her family, accompanied by\r\nMessieurs d’Aumale, d’Elboeuf, and Damville, with many nobles, among\r\nwhom were Brantome and Chatelard, she embarked in M. Mevillon’s galley,\r\nwhich was immediately ordered to put out to sea, which it did with the\r\naid of oars, there not being sufficient wind to make use of the sails.\r\n\r\nMary Stuart was then in the full bloom of her beauty, beauty even more\r\nbrilliant in its mourning garb—a beauty so wonderful that it shed around\r\nher a charm which no one whom she wished to please could escape, and\r\nwhich was fatal to almost everyone. About this time, too, someone made\r\nher the subject of a song, which, as even her rivals confessed,\r\ncontained no more than the truth. It was, so it was said, by M. de\r\nMaison-Fleur, a cavalier equally accomplished in arms and letters: Here\r\nit is:—\r\n\r\n\"In robes of whiteness, lo, Full sad and mournfully, Went pacing to and\r\nfro Beauty’s divinity; A shaft in hand she bore From Cupid’s cruel\r\nstore, And he, who fluttered round, Bore, o’er his blindfold eyes And\r\no’er his head uncrowned, A veil of mournful guise, Whereon the words\r\nwere wrought: ’You perish or are caught.’\"\r\n\r\nYes, at this moment, Mary Stuart, in her deep mourning of white, was\r\nmore lovely than ever; for great tears were trickling down her cheeks,\r\nas, weaving a handkerchief, standing on the quarterdeck, she who was so\r\ngrieved to set out, bowed farewell to those who were so grieved to\r\nremain.\r\n\r\nAt last, in half an hour’s time, the harbour was left behind; the vessel\r\nwas out at sea. Suddenly, Mary heard loud cries behind her: a boat\r\ncoming in under press of sail, through her pilot’s ignorance had struck\r\nupon a rock in such a manner that it was split open, and after having\r\ntrembled and groaned for a moment like someone wounded, began to be\r\nswallowed up, amid the terrified screams of all the crew. Mary,\r\nhorror-stricken, pale, dumb, and motionless, watched her gradually sink,\r\nwhile her unfortunate crew, as the keel disappeared, climbed into the\r\nyards and shrouds, to delay their death-agony a few minutes; finally,\r\nkeel, yards, masts, all were engulfed in the ocean’s gaping jaws. For a\r\nmoment there remained some black specks, which in turn disappeared one\r\nafter another; then wave followed upon wave, and the spectators of this\r\nhorrible tragedy, seeing the sea calm and solitary as if nothing had\r\nhappened, asked themselves if it was not a vision that had appeared to\r\nthem and vanished.\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" cried Mary, falling on a seat and leaning both arms an the\r\nvessel’s stern, \"what a sad omen for such a sad voyage!\" Then, once more\r\nfixing on the receding harbour her eyes, dried for a moment by terror,\r\nand beginning to moisten anew, \"Adieu, France!\" she murmured, \"adieu,\r\nFrance!\" and for five hours she remained thus, weeping and murmuring,\r\n\"Adieu, France! adieu, France!\"\r\n\r\nDarkness fell while she was still lamenting; and then, as the view was\r\nblotted out and she was summoned to supper, \"It is indeed now, dear\r\nFrance,\" said she, rising, \"that I really lose you, since jealous night\r\nheaps mourning upon mourning, casting a black veil before my sight.\r\nAdieu then, one last time, dear France; for never shall I see you more.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, she went below, saying that she was the very opposite\r\nof Dido, who, after the departure of AEneas, had done nothing but look\r\nat the waves, while she, Mary, could not take her eyes off the land.\r\nThen everyone gathered round her to try to divert and console her. But\r\nshe, growing sadder, and not being able to respond, so overcome was she\r\nwith tears, could hardly eat; and, having had a bed got ready on the\r\nstern deck, she sent for the steersman, and ordered him if he still saw\r\nland at daybreak, to come and wake her immediately. On this point Mary\r\nwas favoured; for the wind having dropped, when daybreak came the vessel\r\nwas still within sight of France.\r\n\r\nIt was a great joy when, awakened by the steersman, who had not\r\nforgotten the order he had received, Mary raised herself on her couch,\r\nand through the window that she had had opened, saw once more the\r\nbeloved shore. But at five o’clock in the morning, the wind having\r\nfreshened, the vessel rapidly drew farther away, so that soon the land\r\ncompletely disappeared. Then Mary fell back upon her bed, pale as death,\r\nmurmuring yet once again—\"Adieu, France! I shall see thee no more.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, the happiest years of her life had just passed away in this\r\nFrance that she so much regretted. Born amid the first religious\r\ntroubles, near the bedside of her dying father, the cradle mourning was\r\nto stretch for her to the grave, and her stay in France had been a ray\r\nof sunshine in her night. Slandered from her birth, the report was so\r\ngenerally spread abroad that she was malformed, and that she could not\r\nlive to grow up, that one day her mother, Mary of Guise, tired of these\r\nfalse rumours, undressed her and showed her naked to the English\r\nambassador, who had come, on the part of Henry VIII, to ask her in\r\nmarriage for the Prince of Wales, himself only five years old. Crowned\r\nat nine months by Cardinal Beaton, archbishop of St. Andrews, she was\r\nimmediately hidden by her mother, who was afraid of treacherous dealing\r\nin the King of England, in Stirling Castle. Two years later, not finding\r\neven this fortress safe enough, she removed her to an island in the\r\nmiddle of the Lake of Menteith, where a priory, the only building in the\r\nplace, provided an asylum for the royal child and for four young girls\r\nborn in the same year as herself, having like her the sweet name which\r\nis an anagram of the word \"aimer,\" and who, quitting her neither in her\r\ngood nor in her evil fortune, were called the \"Queen’s Marys\". They were\r\nMary Livingston, Mary Fleming, Mary Seyton, and Mary Beaton. Mary stayed\r\nin this priory till Parliament, having approved her marriage with the\r\nFrench dauphin, son of Henry II, she was taken to Dumbarton Castle, to\r\nawait the moment of departure. There she was entrusted to M. de Breze,\r\nsent by Henry II to-fetch her. Having set out in the French galleys\r\nanchored at the mouth of the Clyde, Mary, after having been hotly\r\npursued by the English fleet, entered Brest harbour, 15th August, 1548,\r\none year after the death of Francis! Besides the queen’s four Marys, the\r\nvessels also brought to France three of her natural brothers, among whom\r\nwas the Prior of St. Andrews, James Stuart, who was later to abjure the\r\nCatholic faith, and with the title of Regent, and under the name of the\r\nEarl of Murray, to become so fatal to poor Mary. From Brest, Mary went\r\nto St. Germain-en-Laye, where Henry II, who had just ascended the\r\nthrone, overwhelmed her with caresses, and then sent her to a convent\r\nwhere the heiresses of the noblest French houses were brought up. There\r\nMary’s happy qualities developed. Born with a woman’s heart and a man’s\r\nhead, Mary not only acquired all the accomplishments which constituted\r\nthe education of a future queen, but also that real knowledge which is\r\nthe object of the truly learned.\r\n\r\nThus, at fourteen, in the Louvre, before Henry II, Catherine de Medici,\r\nand the whole court, she delivered a discourse in Latin of her own\r\ncomposition, in which she maintained that it becomes women to cultivate\r\nletters, and that it is unjust and tyrannical to deprive flowery of\r\ntheir perfumes, by banishing young girls from all but domestic cares.\r\nOne can imagine in what manner a future queen, sustaining such a thesis,\r\nwas likely to be welcomed in the most lettered and pedantic court in\r\nEurope. Between the literature of Rabelais and Marot verging on their\r\ndecline, and that of Ronsard and Montaigne reaching their zenith, Mary\r\nbecame a queen of poetry, only too happy never to have to wear another\r\ncrown than that which Ronsard, Dubellay, Maison-Fleur, and Brantome\r\nplaced daily on her head. But she was predestined. In the midst of those\r\nfetes which a waning chivalry was trying to revive came the fatal joust\r\nof Tournelles: Henry II, struck by a splinter of a lance for want of a\r\nvisor, slept before his time with his ancestors, and Mary Stuart\r\nascended the throne of France, where, from mourning for Henry, she\r\npassed to that for her mother, and from mourning for her mother to that\r\nfor her husband. Mary felt this last loss both as woman and as poet; her\r\nheart burst forth into bitter tears and plaintive harmonies. Here are\r\nsome lines that she composed at this time:—\r\n\r\n\"Into my song of woe, Sung to a low sad air, My cruel grief I throw, For\r\nloss beyond compare; In bitter sighs and tears Go by my fairest years.\r\n\r\nWas ever grief like mine Imposed by destiny? Did ever lady pine, In high\r\nestate, like me, Of whom both heart and eye Within the coffin lie?\r\n\r\nWho, in the tender spring And blossom of my youth, Taste all the\r\nsorrowing Of life’s extremest ruth, And take delight in nought Save in\r\nregretful thought.\r\n\r\nAll that was sweet and gay Is now a pain to see; The sunniness of day Is\r\nblack as night to me; All that was my delight Is hidden from my sight.\r\n\r\nMy heart and eye, indeed, One face, one image know, The which this\r\nmournful weed On my sad face doth show, Dyed with the violet’s tone That\r\nis the lover’s own.\r\n\r\nTormented by my ill, I go from place to place, But wander as I will My\r\nwoes can nought efface; My most of bad and good I find in solitude.\r\n\r\nBut wheresoe’er I stay, In meadow or in copse, Whether at break of day\r\nOr when the twilight drops, My heart goes sighing on, Desiring one\r\nthat’s gone.\r\n\r\nIf sometimes to the skies My weary gaze I lift, His gently shining eyes\r\nLook from the cloudy drift, Or stooping o’er the wave I see him in the\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\nOr when my bed I seek, And-sleep begins to steal, Again I hear him\r\nspeak, Again his touch I feel; In work or leisure, he Is ever near to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nNo other thing I see, However fair displayed, By which my heart will be\r\nA tributary made, Not having the perfection Of that, my lost affection.\r\n\r\nHere make an end, my verse, Of this thy sad lament, Whose burden shall\r\nrehearse Pure love of true intent, Which separation’s stress Will never\r\nrender less.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was then,\" says Brantorne, \"that it was delightful to see her; for\r\nthe whiteness of her countenance and of her veil contended together; but\r\nfinally the artificial white yielded, and the snow-like pallor of her\r\nface vanquished the other. For it was thus,\" he adds, \"that from the\r\nmoment she became a widow, I always saw her with her pale hue, as long\r\nas I had the honour of seeing her in France, and Scotland, where she had\r\nto go in eighteen months’ time, to her very great regret, after her\r\nwidowhood, to pacify her kingdom, greatly divided by religious troubles.\r\nAlas! she had neither the wish nor the will for it, and I have often\r\nheard her say so, with a fear of this journey like death; for she\r\npreferred a hundred times to dwell in France as a dowager queen, and to\r\ncontent herself with Touraine and Poitou for her jointure, than to go\r\nand reign over there in her wild country; but her uncles, at least some\r\nof them, not all, advised her, and even urged her to it, and deeply\r\nrepented their error.\"\r\n\r\nMary was obedient, as we have seen, and she began her journey under such\r\nauspices that when she lost sight of land she was like to die. Then it\r\nwas that the poetry of her soul found expression in these famous lines:\r\n\r\n    \"Farewell, delightful land of France,\r\n     My motherland,\r\n     The best beloved!\r\n     Foster−nurse of my young years!\r\n     Farewell, France, and farewell my happy days!\r\n     The ship that separates our loves\r\n     Has borne away but half of me;\r\n     One part is left thee and is throe,\r\n     And I confide it to thy tenderness,\r\n     That thou may'st hold in mind the other part.\"'\r\n\r\n_[Translator’s note.-It has not been found possible to make a rhymed\r\nversion of these lines without sacrificing the simplicity which is their\r\nchief charm.]_\r\n\r\nThis part of herself that Mary left in France was the body of the young\r\nking, who had taken with him all poor Mary’s happiness into his tomb.\r\n\r\nMary had but one hope remaining, that the sight of the English fleet\r\nwould compel her little squadron to turn back; but she had to fulfil her\r\ndestiny. This same day, a fog, a very unusual occurrence in summer-time,\r\nextended all over the Channel, and caused her to escape the fleet; for\r\nit was such a dense fog that one could not see from stern to mast. It\r\nlasted the whole of Sunday, the day after the departure, and did not\r\nlift till the following day, Monday, at eight o’clock in the morning.\r\nThe little flotilla, which all this time had been sailing haphazard, had\r\ngot among so many reefs that if the fog had lasted some minutes longer\r\nthe galley would certainly have grounded on some rock, and would have\r\nperished like the vessel that had been seen engulfed on leaving port.\r\nBut, thanks to the fog’s clearing, the pilot recognised the Scottish\r\ncoast, and, steering his four boats with great skill through all the\r\ndangers, on the 20th August he put in at Leith, where no preparation had\r\nbeen made for the queen’s reception. Nevertheless, scarcely had she\r\narrived there than the chief persons of the town met together and came\r\nto felicitate her. Meanwhile, they hastily collected some wretched nags,\r\nwith harness all falling in pieces, to conduct the queen to Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nAt sight of this, Mary could not help weeping again; for she thought of\r\nthe splendid palfreys and hackneys of her French knights and ladies, and\r\nat this first view Scotland appeared to-her in all its poverty. Next day\r\nit was to appear to her in all its wildness.\r\n\r\nAfter having passed one night at Holyrood Palace, \"during which,\" says\r\nBrantome, \"five to six hundred rascals from the town, instead of letting\r\nher sleep, came to give her a wild morning greeting on wretched fiddles\r\nand little rebecks,\" she expressed a wish to hear mass. Unfortunately,\r\nthe people of Edinburgh belonged almost entirely to the Reformed\r\nreligion; so that, furious at the queen’s giving such a proof of\r\npapistry at her first appearance, they entered the church by force,\r\narmed with knives, sticks and stones, with the intention of putting to\r\ndeath the poor priest, her chaplain. He left the altar, and took refuge\r\nnear the queen, while Mary’s brother, the Prior of St. Andrews, who was\r\nmore inclined from this time forward to be a soldier than an\r\necclesiastic, seized a sword, and, placing himself between the people\r\nand the queen, declared that he would kill with his own hand the first\r\nman who should take another step. This firmness, combined with the\r\nqueen’s imposing and dignified air, checked the zeal of the Reformers.\r\n\r\nAs we have said, Mary had arrived in the midst of all the heat of the\r\nfirst religious wars. A zealous Catholic, like all her family on the\r\nmaternal side, she inspired the Huguenots with the gravest fears:\r\nbesides, a rumour had got about that Mary, instead of landing at Leith,\r\nas she had been obliged by the fog, was to land at Aberdeen. There, it\r\nwas said, she would have found the Earl of Huntly, one of the peers who\r\nhad remained loyal to the Catholic faith, and who, next to the family of\r\nHamilton, was, the nearest and most powerful ally of the royal house.\r\nSeconded by him and by twenty thousand soldiers from the north, she\r\nwould then have marched upon Edinburgh, and have re-established the\r\nCatholic faith throughout Scotland. Events were not slow to prove that\r\nthis accusation was false.\r\n\r\nAs we have stated, Mary was much attached to the Prior of St. Andrews, a\r\nson of James V and of a noble descendant of the Earls of Mar, who had\r\nbeen very handsome in her youth, and who, in spite of the well-known\r\nlove for her of James V, and the child who had resulted, had none the\r\nless wedded Lord Douglas of Lochleven, by whom she had had two other\r\nsons, the elder named William and the younger George, who were thus\r\nhalf-brothers of the regent. Now, scarcely had she reascended the throne\r\nthan Mary had restored to the Prior of St. Andrews the title of Earl of\r\nMar, that of his maternal ancestors, and as that of the Earl of Murray\r\nhad lapsed since the death of the famous Thomas Randolph, Mary, in her\r\nsisterly friendship for James Stuart, hastened to add, this title to\r\nthose which she had already bestowed upon him.\r\n\r\nBut here difficulties and complications arose; for the new Earl of\r\nMurray, with his character, was not a man to content himself with a\r\nbarren title, while the estates which were crown property since the\r\nextinction of the male branch of the old earls, had been gradually\r\nencroached upon by powerful neighbours, among whom was the famous Earl\r\nof Huntly, whom we have already mentioned: the result was that, as the\r\nqueen judged that in this quarter her orders would probably encounter\r\nopposition, under pretext of visiting her possessions in the north, she\r\nplaced herself at the head of a small army, commanded by her brother,\r\nthe Earl of Mar and Murray.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Huntly was the less duped by the apparent pretext of this\r\nexpedition, in that his son, John Cordon, for some abuse of his powers,\r\nhad just been condemned to a temporary imprisonment. He,\r\nnotwithstanding, made every possible submission to the queen, sending\r\nmessengers in advance to invite-her to rest in his castle; and following\r\nup the messengers in person, to renew his invitation viva voce.\r\nUnfortunately, at the very moment when he was about to join the queen,\r\nthe governor of Inverness, who was entirely devoted to him, was refusing\r\nto allow Mary to enter this castle, which was a royal one. It is true\r\nthat Murray, aware that it does not do to hesitate in the face of such\r\nrebellions, had already had him executed for high treason.\r\n\r\nThis new act of firmness showed Huntly that the young queen was not\r\ndisposed to allow the Scottish lords a resumption of the almost\r\nsovereign power humbled by her father; so that, in spite of the\r\nextremely kind reception she accorded him, as he learned while in camp\r\nthat his son, having escaped from prison, had just put himself at the\r\nhead of his vassals, he was afraid that he should be thought, as\r\ndoubtless he was, a party to the rising, and he set out the same night\r\nto assume command of his troops, his mind made up, as Mary only had with\r\nher seven to eight thousand men, to risk a battle, giving out, however,\r\nas Buccleuch had done in his attempt to snatch James V from the hands of\r\nthe Douglases, that it was not at the queen he was aiming, but solely at\r\nthe regent, who kept her under his tutelage and perverted her good\r\nintentions.\r\n\r\nMurray, who knew that often the entire peace of a reign depends on the\r\nfirmness one displays at its beginning, immediately summoned all the\r\nnorthern barons whose estates bordered on his, to march against Huntly.\r\nAll obeyed, for the house of Cordon was already so powerful that each\r\nfeared it might become still more so; but, however, it was clear that if\r\nthere was hatred for the subject there was no great affection for the\r\nqueen, and that the greater number came without fixed intentions and\r\nwith the idea of being led by circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe two armies encountered near Aberdeen. Murray at once posted the\r\ntroops he had brought from Edinburgh, and of which he was sure, on the\r\ntop of rising ground, and drew up in tiers on the hill slope all his\r\nnorthern allies. Huntly advanced resolutely upon them, and attacked his\r\nneighbours the Highlanders, who after a short resistance retired in\r\ndisorder. His men immediately threw away their lances, and, drawing\r\ntheir swords, crying, \"Cordon, Cordon!\" pursued the fugitives, and\r\nbelieved they had already gained the battle, when they suddenly ran\r\nright against the main body of Murray’s army, which remained motionless\r\nas a rampart of iron, and which, with its long lances, had the advantage\r\nof its adversaries, who were armed only with their claymores. It was\r\nthen the turn of the Cordons to draw back, seeing which, the northern\r\nclans rallied and returned to the fight, each soldier having a sprig of\r\nheather in his cap that his comrades might recognise him. This\r\nunexpected movement determined the day: the Highlanders ran down the\r\nhillside like a torrent, dragging along with them everyone who could\r\nhave wished to oppose their passage. Then Murray seeing that the moment\r\nhad come for changing the defeat into a rout, charged with his entire\r\ncavalry: Huntly, who was very stout and very heavily armed, fell and was\r\ncrushed beneath the horses’ feet; John Cordon, taken prisoner in his\r\nflight, was executed at Aberdeen three days afterwards; finally, his\r\nbrother, too young to undergo the same fate at this time, was shut up in\r\na dungeon and executed later, the day he reached the age of sixteen.\r\n\r\nMary had been present at the battle, and the calm and courage she\r\ndisplayed had made a lively impression on her wild defenders, who all\r\nalong the road had heard her say that she would have liked to be a man,\r\nto pass her days on horseback, her nights under a tent, to wear a coat\r\nof mail, a helmet, a buckler, and at her side a broadsword.\r\n\r\nMary made her entry into Edinburgh amid general enthusiasm; for this\r\nexpedition against the Earl of Huntly, who was a Catholic, had been very\r\npopular among the inhabitants, who had no very clear idea of the real\r\nmotives which had caused her to undertake it: They were of the Reformed\r\nfaith, the earl was a papist, there was an enemy the less; that is all\r\nthey thought about. Now, therefore; the Scotch, amid their acclamations,\r\nwhether viva voce or by written demands, expressed the wish that their\r\nqueen, who was without issue by Francis II, should re-marry: Mary agreed\r\nto this, and, yielding to the prudent advice of those about her, she\r\ndecided to consult upon this marriage Elizabeth, whose heir she was, in\r\nher title of granddaughter of Henry VII, in the event of the Queen of\r\nEngland’s dying without posterity. Unfortunately, she had not always\r\nacted with like circumspection; for at the death of Mary Tudor, known as\r\nBloody. Mary, she had laid claim to the throne of Henry VIII, and,\r\nrelying on the illegitimacy of Elizabeth’s birth, had with the dauphin\r\nassumed sovereignty over Scotland, England, and Ireland, and had had\r\ncoins struck with this new title, and plate engraved with these new\r\narmorial bearings.\r\n\r\nElizabeth was nine years older than Mary—that is to say, that at this\r\ntime she had not yet attained her thirtieth year; she was not merely her\r\nrival as queen, then, but as woman. As regards education, she could\r\nsustain comparison with advantage; for if she had less charm of mind,\r\nshe had more solidity of judgment: versed in politics, philosophy,\r\nhistory; rhetoric, poetry and music, besides English, her maternal\r\ntongue, she spoke and wrote to perfection Greek, Latin, French, Italian\r\nand Spanish; but while Elizabeth excelled Mary on this point, in her\r\nturn Mary was more beautiful, and above all more attractive, than her\r\nrival. Elizabeth had, it is true, a majestic and agreeable appearance,\r\nbright quick eyes, a dazzlingly white complexion; but she had red hair,\r\na large foot,—[Elizabeth bestowed a pair of her shoes on the University\r\nof Oxford; their size would point to their being those of a man of\r\naverage stature.]—and a powerful hand, while Mary, on the contrary, with\r\nher beautiful ashy-fair hair,—[Several historians assert that Mary\r\nStuart had black hair; but Brantome, who had seen it, since, as we have\r\nsaid, he accompanied her to Scotland, affirms that it was fair. And, so\r\nsaying, he (the executioner) took off her headdress, in a contemptuous\r\nmanner, to display her hair already white, that while alive, however,\r\nshe feared not to show, nor yet to twist and frizz as in the days when\r\nit was so beautiful and so fair.]—her noble open forehead, eyebrows\r\nwhich could be only blamed for being so regularly arched that they\r\nlooked as if drawn by a pencil, eyes continually beaming with the\r\nwitchery of fire, a nose of perfect Grecian outline, a mouth so ruby red\r\nand gracious that it seemed that, as a flower opens but to let its\r\nperfume escape, so it could not open but to give passage to gentle\r\nwords, with a neck white and graceful as a swan’s, hands of alabaster,\r\nwith a form like a goddess’s and a foot like a child’s, Mary was a\r\nharmony in which the most ardent enthusiast for sculptured form could\r\nhave found nothing to reproach.\r\n\r\nThis was indeed Mary’s great and real crime: one single imperfection in\r\nface or figure, and she would not have died upon the scaffold. Besides,\r\nto Elizabeth, who had never seen her, and who consequently could only\r\njudge by hearsay, this beauty was a great cause of uneasiness and of\r\njealousy, which she could not even disguise, and which showed itself\r\nunceasingly in eager questions. One day when she was chatting with James\r\nMelville about his mission to her court, Mary’s offer to be guided by\r\nElizabeth in her choice of a husband,—a choice which the queen of\r\nEngland had seemed at first to wish to see fixed on the Earl of\r\nLeicester,—she led the Scotch ambassador into a cabinet, where she\r\nshowed him several portraits with labels in her own handwriting: the\r\nfirst was one of the Earl of Leicester. As this nobleman was precisely\r\nthe suitor chosen by Elizabeth, Melville asked the queen to give it him\r\nto show to his mistress; but Elizabeth refused, saying that it was the\r\nonly one she had. Melville then replied, smiling, that being in\r\npossession of the original she might well part with the copy; but\r\nElizabeth would on no account consent. This little discussion ended, she\r\nshowed him the portrait of Mary Stuart, which she kissed very tenderly,\r\nexpressing to Melville a great wish to see his mistress. \"That is very\r\neasy, madam,\" he replied: \"keep your room, on the pretext that you are\r\nindisposed, and set out incognito for Scotland, as King James V set out\r\nfor France when he wanted to see Madeleine de Valois, whom he afterwards\r\nmarried.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" replied Elizabeth, \"I would like to do so, but it is not so easy\r\nas you think. Nevertheless, tell your queen that I love her tenderly,\r\nand that I wish we could live more in friendship than we have done up to\r\nthe present\". Then passing to a subject which she seemed to have wanted\r\nto broach for a long time, \"Melville,\" she continued, \"tell me frankly,\r\nis my sister as beautiful as they say?\"\r\n\r\n\"She has that reputation,\" replied Melville; \"but I cannot give your\r\nMajesty any idea of hex beauty, having no point of comparison.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will give you one,\" the queen said. \"Is she more beautiful than I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" replied Melville, \"you are the most beautiful woman in England,\r\nand Mary Stuart is the most beautiful woman in Scotland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then which of the two is the taller?\" asked Elizabeth, who was not\r\nentirely satisfied by this answer, clever as it was.\r\n\r\n\"My mistress, madam,\" responded Melville; \"I am obliged to confess it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then she is too tall,\" Elizabeth said sharply, \"for I am tall enough.\r\nAnd what are her favourite amusements?\" she continued.\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" Melville replied, \"hunting, riding, performing on the lute and\r\nthe harpischord.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she skilled upon the latter?\" Elizabeth inquired. \"Oh yes, madam,\"\r\nanswered Melville; \"skilled enough for a queen.\"\r\n\r\nThere the conversation stopped; but as Elizabeth was herself an\r\nexcellent musician, she commanded Lord Hunsdon to bring Melville to her\r\nat a time when she was at her harpischord, so that he could hear her\r\nwithout her seeming to have the air of playing for him. In fact, the\r\nsame day, Hunsdon, agreeably to her instructions, led the ambassador\r\ninto a gallery separated from the queen’s apartment merely by tapestry,\r\nso that his guide having raised it. Melville at his leisure could hear\r\nElizabeth, who did not turn round until she had finished the piece,\r\nwhich, however, she was playing with much skill. When she saw Melville,\r\nshe pretended to fly into a passion, and even wanted to strike him; but\r\nher anger calmed down by little and little at the ambassador’s\r\ncompliments, and ceased altogether when he admitted that Mary Stuart was\r\nnot her equal. But this was not all: proud of her triumph, Elizabeth\r\ndesired also that Melville should see her dance. Accordingly, she kept\r\nback her despatches for two days that he might be present at a ball that\r\nshe was giving. These despatches, as we have said, contained the wish\r\nthat Mary Stuart should espouse Leicester; but this proposal could not\r\nbe taken seriously. Leicester, whose personal worth was besides\r\nsufficiently mediocre, was of birth too inferior to aspire to the hand\r\nof the daughter of so many kings; thus Mary replied that such an\r\nalliance would not become her. Meanwhile, something strange and tragic\r\ncame to pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the lords who had followed Mary Stuart to Scotland was, as we have\r\nmentioned, a young nobleman named Chatelard, a true type of the nobility\r\nof that time, a nephew of Bayard on his mother’s side, a poet and a\r\nknight, talented and courageous, and attached to Marshal Damville, of\r\nwhose household he formed one. Thanks to this high position, Chatelard,\r\nthroughout her stay in France, paid court to Mary Stuart, who, in the\r\nhomage he rendered her in verse, saw nothing more than those poetical\r\ndeclarations of gallantry customary in that age, and with which she\r\nespecially was daily overwhelmed. But it happened that about the time\r\nwhen Chatelard was most in love with the queen she was obliged to leave\r\nFrance, as we have said. Then Marshal Damville, who knew nothing of\r\nChatelard’s passion, and who himself, encouraged by Mary’s kindness, was\r\namong the candidates to succeed Francis II as husband, set out for\r\nScotland with the poor exile, taking Chatelard with him, and, not\r\nimagining he would find a rival in him, he made a confidant of him, and\r\nleft him with Mary when he was obliged to leave her, charging the young\r\npoet to support with her the interests of his suit. This post as\r\nconfidant brought Mary and Chatelard more together; and, as in her\r\ncapacity as poet, the queen treated him like a brother, he made bold in\r\nhis passion to risk all to obtain another title. Accordingly, one\r\nevening he got into Mary Stuart’s room, and hid himself under the bed;\r\nbut at the moment when the queen was beginning to undress, a little dog\r\nshe had began to yelp so loudly that her women came running at his\r\nbarking, and, led by this indication, perceived Chatelard. A woman\r\neasily pardons a crime for which too great love is the excuse: Mary\r\nStuart was woman before being queen—she pardoned.\r\n\r\nBut this kindness only increased Chatelard’s confidence: he put down the\r\nreprimand he had received to the presence of the queen’s women, and\r\nsupposed that if she had been alone she would have forgiven him still\r\nmore completely; so that, three weeks after, this same scene was\r\nrepeated. But this time, Chatelard, discovered in a cupboard, when the\r\nqueen was already in bed, was placed under arrest.\r\n\r\nThe moment was badly chosen: such a scandal, just when the queen was\r\nabout to re-marry, was fatal to Mary, let alone to Chatelard. Murray\r\ntook the affair in hand, and, thinking that a public trial could alone\r\nsave his sister’s reputation, he urged the prosecution with such vigour,\r\nthat Chatelard, convicted of the crime of lese-majeste, was condemned to\r\ndeath. Mary entreated her brother that Chatelard might be sent back to\r\nFrance; but Murray made her see what terrible consequences such a use of\r\nher right of pardon might have, so that Mary was obliged to let justice\r\ntake its course: Chatelard was led to execution. Arrived on the\r\nscaffold, which was set up before the queen’s palace, Chatelard, who had\r\ndeclined the services of a priest, had Ronsard’s Ode on Death read; and\r\nwhen the reading, which he followed with evident pleasure, was ended, he\r\nturned—towards the queen’s windows, and, having cried out for the last\r\ntime, \"Adieu, loveliest and most cruel of princesses!\" he stretched out\r\nhis neck to the executioner, without displaying any repentance or\r\nuttering any complaint. This death made all the more impression upon\r\nMary, that she did not dare to show her sympathy openly.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there was a rumour that the queen of Scotland was consenting\r\nto a new marriage, and several suitors came forward, sprung from the\r\nprincipal reigning families of Europe: first, the Archduke Charles,\r\nthird son of the Emperor of Germany; then the Duke of Anjou, who\r\nafterwards became Henry III. But to wed a foreign prince was to give up\r\nher claims to the English crown. So Mary refused, and, making a merit of\r\nthis to Elizabeth, she cast her eyes on a relation of the latter’s,\r\nHenry Stuart, Lord Darnley, son of the Earl of Lennox. Elizabeth, who\r\nhad nothing plausible to urge against this marriage, since the Queen of\r\nScotland not only chose an Englishman for husband, but was marrying into\r\nher own family, allowed the Earl of Lennox and his son to go to the\r\nScotch court, reserving it to herself, if matters appeared to take a\r\nserious turn, to recall them both—a command which they would be\r\nconstrained to obey, since all their property was in England.\r\n\r\nDarnley was eighteen years of age: he was handsome, well-made, elegant;\r\nhe talked in that attractive manner of the young nobles of the French\r\nand English courts that Mary no longer heard since her exile in\r\nScotland; she let herself be deceived by these appearances, and did not\r\nsee that under this brilliant exterior Darnley hid utter insignificance,\r\ndubious courage, and a fickle and churlish character. It is true that he\r\ncame to her under the auspices of a man whose influence was as striking\r\nas the risen fortune which gave him the opportunity to exert it. We\r\nrefer to David Rizzio.\r\n\r\nDavid Rizzio, who played such a great part in the life of Mary Stuart,\r\nwhose strange favour for him has given her enemies, probably without any\r\ncause, such cruel weapons against her, was the son of a Turin musician\r\nburdened with a numerous family, who, recognising in him a pronounced\r\nmusical taste, had him instructed in the first principles of the art. At\r\nthe age of fifteen he had left his father’s house and had gone on foot\r\nto Nice, where the Duke of Savoy held his court; there he entered the\r\nservice of the Duke of Moreto, and this lord having been appointed, some\r\nyears afterwards, to the Scottish embassy, Rizzio followed him to\r\nScotland. As this young man had a very fine voice, and accompanied on\r\nthe viol and fiddle songs of which both the airs and the words were of\r\nhis own composition, the ambassador spoke of him to Mary, who wished to\r\nsee him. Rizzio, full of confidence in himself, and seeing in the\r\nqueen’s desire a road to success, hastened to obey her command, sang\r\nbefore her, and pleased her. She begged him then of Moreto, making no\r\nmore of it than if she had asked of him a thoroughbred dog or a\r\nwell-trained falcon. Moreta presented him to her, delighted at finding\r\nsuch an opportunity to pay his court; but scarcely was Rizzio in her\r\nservice than Mary discovered that music was the least of his gifts, that\r\nhe possessed, besides that, education if not profound at least varied, a\r\nsupple mind, a lively imagination, gentle ways, and at the same time\r\nmuch boldness and presumption. He reminded her of those Italian artists\r\nwhom she had seen at the French court, and spoke to her the tongue of\r\nMarot and Ronsard, whose most beautiful poems he knew by heart: this was\r\nmore than enough to please Mary Stuart. In a short time he became her\r\nfavourite, and meanwhile the place of secretary for the French\r\ndespatches falling vacant, Rizzio was provided for with it.\r\n\r\nDarnley, who wished to succeed at all costs, enlisted Rizzio in his\r\ninterests, unconscious that he had no need of this support; and as, on\r\nher side, Mary, who had fallen in love with him at first sight, fearing\r\nsome new intrigue of Elizabeth’s, hastened on this union so far as the\r\nproprieties permitted, the affair moved forward with wonderful rapidity;\r\nand in the midst of public rejoicing, with the approbation of the\r\nnobility, except for a small minority, with Murray at its head, the\r\nmarriage was solemnised under the happiest auspices, 29th July 1565. Two\r\ndays before, Darnley and his father, the Earl of Lennox, had received a\r\ncommand to return to London, and as they had not obeyed it, a week after\r\nthe celebration of the marriage they learned that the Countess of\r\nLennox, the only one of the family remaining in Elizabeth’s power, had\r\nbeen arrested and taken to the Tower. Thus Elizabeth, in spite of her\r\ndissimulation, yielding to that first impulse of violence that she\r\nalways had such trouble to overcome, publicly displayed her resentment.\r\n\r\nHowever, Elizabeth was not the woman to be satisfied with useless\r\nvengeance: she soon released the countess, and turned her eyes towards\r\nMurray, the most discontented of the nobles in opposition, who by this\r\nmarriage was losing all his personal influence. It was thus easy for\r\nElizabeth to put arms in his hand. In fact, when he had failed in his\r\nfirst attempt to seize Darnley, he called to his aid the Duke of\r\nChatellerault, Glencairn, Argyll, and Rothes, and collecting what\r\npartisans they could, they openly rebelled against the queen. This was\r\nthe first ostensible act of that hatred which was afterwards so fatal to\r\nMary.\r\n\r\nThe queen, on her side, appealed to her nobles, who in response hastened\r\nto rally to her, so that in a month’s time she found herself at the head\r\nof the finest army that ever a king of Scotland had raised. Darnley\r\nassumed the command of this magnificent assembly, mounted on a superb\r\nhorse, arrayed in gilded armour; and accompanied by the queen, who, in a\r\nriding habit, with pistols at her saddle-bow, wished to make the\r\ncampaign with him, that she might not quit his side for a moment. Both\r\nwere young, both were handsome, and they left Edinburgh amidst the\r\ncheers of the people and the army.\r\n\r\nMurray and his accomplices did not even try to stand against them, and\r\nthe campaign consisted of such rapid and complex marches and\r\ncounter-marches, that this rebellion is called the Run-about Raid-that\r\nis to say, the run in every sense of the word. Murray and the rebels\r\nwithdrew into England, where Elizabeth, while seeming to condemn their\r\nunlucky attempt, afforded them all the assistance they needed.\r\n\r\nMary returned to Edinburgh delighted at the success of her two first\r\ncampaigns, not suspecting that this new good fortune was the last she\r\nwould have, and that there her short-lived prosperity would cease.\r\nIndeed, she soon saw that in Darnley she had given herself not a devoted\r\nand very attentive husband, as she had believed, but an imperious and\r\nbrutal master, who, no longer having any motive for concealment, showed\r\nhimself to her just as he was, a man of disgraceful vices, of which\r\ndrunkenness and debauchery was the least. Accordingly, serious\r\ndifferences were not long in springing up in this royal household.\r\n\r\nDarnley in wedding Mary had not become king, but merely the queen’s\r\nhusband. To confer on him authority nearly equalling a regent’s, it was\r\nnecessary that Mary should grant him what was termed the crown\r\nmatrimonial—a crown Francis II had worn during his short royalty, and\r\nthat Mary, after Darnley’s conduct to herself, had not the slightest\r\nintention of bestowing on him. Thus, to whatever entreaties he made, in\r\nwhatever form they were wrapped, Mary merely replied with an unvaried\r\nand obstinate refusal. Darnley, amazed at this force of will in a young\r\nqueen who had loved him enough to raise him to her, and not believing\r\nthat she could find it in herself, sought in her entourage for some\r\nsecret and influential adviser who might have inspired her with it. His\r\nsuspicions fell on Rizzio.\r\n\r\nIn reality, to whatever cause Rizzio owed his power (and to even the\r\nmost clear-sighted historians this point has always remained obscure),\r\nbe it that he ruled as lover, be it that he advised as minister, his\r\ncounsels as long as he lived were always given for the greater glory of\r\nthe queen. Sprung from so low, he at least wished to show himself\r\nworthy, of having risen so high, and owing everything to Mary, he tried\r\nto repay her with devotion. Thus Darnley was not mistaken, and it was\r\nindeed Rizzio who, in despair at having helped to bring about a union\r\nwhich he foresaw must become so unfortunate, gave Mary the advice not to\r\ngive up any of her power to one who already possessed much more than he\r\ndeserved, in possessing her person.\r\n\r\nDarnley, like all persons of both weak and violent character,\r\ndisbelieved in the persistence of will in others, unless this will was\r\nsustained by an outside influence. He thought that in ridding himself of\r\nRizzio he could not fail to gain the day, since, as he believed, he\r\nalone was opposing the grant of this great desire of his, the crown\r\nmatrimonial. Consequently, as Rizzio was disliked by the nobles in\r\nproportion as his merits had raised him above them, it was easy for\r\nDarnley to organise a conspiracy, and James Douglas of Morton,\r\nchancellor of the kingdom, consented to act as chief.\r\n\r\nThis is the second time since the beginning of our narrative that we\r\ninscribe this name Douglas, so often pronounced, in Scottish history,\r\nand which at this time, extinct in the elder branch, known as the Black\r\nDouglases, was perpetuated in the younger branch, known as the Red\r\nDouglases. It was an ancient, noble, and powerful family, which, when\r\nthe descent in the male line from Robert Bruce had lapsed, disputed the\r\nroyal title with the first Stuart, and which since then had constantly\r\nkept alongside the throne, sometimes its support, sometimes its enemy,\r\nenvying every great house, for greatness made it uneasy, but above all\r\nenvious of the house of Hamilton, which, if not its equal, was at any\r\nrate after itself the next most powerful.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole reign of James V, thanks to the hatred which the king\r\nbore them, the Douglases had: not only lost all their influence, but had\r\nalso been exiled to England. This hatred was on account of their having\r\nseized the guardianship of the young prince and kept him prisoner till\r\nhe was fifteen. Then, with the help of one of his pages, James V had\r\nescaped from Falkland, and had reached Stirling, whose governor was in\r\nhis interests. Scarcely was he safe in the castle than he made\r\nproclamation that any Douglas who should approach within a dozen miles\r\nof it would be prosecuted for high treason. This was not all: he\r\nobtained a decree from Parliament, declaring them guilty of felony, and\r\ncondemning them to exile; they remained proscribed, then, during the\r\nking’s lifetime, and returned to Scotland only upon his death. The\r\nresult was that, although they had been recalled about the throne, and\r\nthough, thanks to the past influence of Murray, who, one remembers, was\r\na Douglas on the mother’s side, they filled the most important posts\r\nthere, they had not forgiven to the daughter the enmity borne them by\r\nthe father.\r\n\r\nThis was why James Douglas, chancellor as he was, and consequently\r\nentrusted with the execution of the laws, put himself at the head of a\r\nconspiracy which had for its aim the violation of all laws; human and\r\ndivine.\r\n\r\nDouglas’s first idea had been to treat Rizzio as the favourites of James\r\nIII had been treated at the Bridge of Lauder—that is to say, to make a\r\nshow of having a trial and to hang him afterwards. But such a death did\r\nnot suffice for Darnley’s vengeance; as above everything he wished to\r\npunish the queen in Rizzio’s person, he exacted that the murder should\r\ntake place in her presence.\r\n\r\nDouglas associated with himself Lord Ruthven, an idle and dissolute\r\nsybarite, who under the circumstances promised to push his devotion so\r\nfar as to wear a cuirass; then, sure of this important accomplice, he\r\nbusied himself with finding other agents.\r\n\r\nHowever, the plot was not woven with such secrecy but that something of\r\nit transpired; and Rizzio received several warnings that he despised.\r\nSir James Melville, among others, tried every means to make him\r\nunderstand the perils a stranger ran who enjoyed such absolute\r\nconfidence in a wild, jealous court like that of Scotland. Rizzio\r\nreceived these hints as if resolved not to apply them to himself; and\r\nSir James Melville, satisfied that he had done enough to ease his\r\nconscience, did not insist further. Then a French priest, who had a\r\nreputation as a clever astrologer, got himself admitted to Rizzio, and\r\nwarned him that the stars predicted that he was in deadly peril, and\r\nthat he should beware of a certain bastard above all. Rizzio replied\r\nthat from the day when he had been honoured with his sovereign’s\r\nconfidence, he had sacrificed in advance his life to his position; that\r\nsince that time, however, he had had occasion to notice that in general\r\nthe Scotch were ready to threaten but slow to act; that, as to the\r\nbastard referred to, who was doubtless the Earl of Murray, he would take\r\ncare that he should never enter Scotland far enough for his sword to\r\nreach him, were it as long as from Dumfries to Edinburgh; which in other\r\nwords was as much as to say that Murray should remain exiled in England\r\nfor life, since Dumfries was one of the principal frontier towns.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the conspiracy proceeded, and Douglas and Ruthven, having\r\ncollected their accomplices and taken their measures, came to Darnley to\r\nfinish the compact. As the price of the bloody service they rendered the\r\nking, they exacted from him a promise to obtain the pardon of Murray and\r\nthe nobles compromised with him in the affair of the \"run in every\r\nsense\". Darnley granted all they asked of him, and a messenger was sent\r\nto Murray to inform him of the expedition in preparation, and to invite\r\nhim to hold himself in readiness to reenter Scotland at the first notice\r\nhe should receive. Then, this point settled, they made Darnley sign a\r\npaper in which he acknowledged himself the author and chief of the\r\nenterprise. The other assassins were the Earl of Morton, the Earl of\r\nRuthven, George Douglas the bastard of Angus, Lindley, and Andrew,\r\nCarew. The remainder were soldiers, simple murderers’ tools, who did not\r\neven know what was afoot. Darnley reserved it for himself to appoint the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nTwo days after these conditions were agreed upon, Darnley having been\r\nnotified that the queen was alone with Rizzio, wished to make himself\r\nsure of the degree of her favour enjoyed by the minister. He accordingly\r\nwent to her apartment by a little door of which he always kept the key\r\nupon him; but though the key turned in the lock, the door did not open.\r\nThen Darnley knocked, announcing himself; but such was the contempt into\r\nwhich he had fallen with the queen, that Mary left him outside,\r\nalthough, supposing she had been alone with Rizzio, she would have had\r\ntime to send him away. Darnley, driven to extremities by this, summoned\r\nMorton, Ruthven, Lennox, Lindley, and Douglas’s bastard, and fixed the\r\nassassination of Rizzio for two days later.\r\n\r\nThey had just completed all the details, and had, distributed the parts\r\nthat each must play in this bloody tragedy, when suddenly, and at the\r\nmoment when they least expected it, the door opened and, Mary Stuart\r\nappeared on the threshold.\r\n\r\n\"My lords,\" said she, \"your holding these secret counsels is useless. I\r\nam informed of your plots, and with God’s help I shall soon apply a\r\nremedy\".\r\n\r\nWith these words, and before the conspirators had had time to collect\r\nthemselves, she shut the door again, and vanished like a passing but\r\nthreatening vision. All remained thunderstruck. Morton was the first to\r\nfind his tongue.\r\n\r\n\"My lords,\" said he, \"this is a game of life and death, and the winner\r\nwill not be the cleverest or the strongest, but the readiest. If we do\r\nnot destroy this man, we are lost. We must strike him down, this very\r\nevening, not the day after to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nEveryone applauded, even Ruthven, who, still pale and feverish from\r\nriotous living, promised not to be behindhand. The only point changed,\r\non Morton’s suggestion, was that the murder should take place next day;\r\nfor, in the opinion of all, not less than a day’s interval was needed to\r\ncollect the minor conspirators, who numbered not less than five hundred.\r\n\r\nThe next day, which was Saturday, March 9th, 1566, Mary Stuart, who had\r\ninherited from her father, James V, a dislike of ceremony and the need\r\nof liberty, had invited to supper with her six persons, Rizzio among the\r\nnumber. Darnley, informed of this in the morning, immediately gave\r\nnotice of it to the conspirators, telling them that he himself would let\r\nthem into the palace between six and seven o’clock in the evening. The\r\nconspirators replied that they would be in readiness.\r\n\r\nThe morning had been dark and stormy, as nearly all the first days of\r\nspring are in Scotland, and towards evening the snow and wind redoubled\r\nin depth and violence. So Mary had remained shut up with Rizzio, and\r\nDarnley, who had gone to the secret door several times, could hear the\r\nsound of instruments and the voice of the favourite, who was singing\r\nthose sweet melodies which have come down to our time, and which\r\nEdinburgh people still attribute to him. These songs were for Mary a\r\nreminder of her stay in France, where the artists in the train of the\r\nMedicis had already brought echoes from Italy; but for Darnley they were\r\nan insult, and each time he had withdrawn strengthened in his design.\r\n\r\nAt the appointed time, the conspirators, who had been given the password\r\nduring the day, knocked at the palace gate, and were received there so\r\nmuch the more easily that Darnley himself, wrapped in a great cloak,\r\nawaited them at the postern by which they were admitted. The five\r\nhundred soldiers immediately stole into an inner courtyard, where they\r\nplaced themselves under some sheds, as much to keep themselves from the\r\ncold as that they might not be seen on the snow-covered ground. A\r\nbrightly lighted window looked into this courtyard; it was that of the\r\nqueen’s study: at the first signal given them from this window, the\r\nsoldiers were to break in the door and go to the help of the chief\r\nconspirators.\r\n\r\nThese instructions given, Darnley led Morton, Ruthven, Lennox, Lindley,\r\nAndrew Carew, and Douglas’s bastard into the room adjoining the study,\r\nand only separated from it by a tapestry hanging before the door. From\r\nthere one could overhear all that was being said, and at a single bound\r\nfall upon the guests.\r\n\r\nDarnley left them in this room, enjoining silence; then, giving them as\r\na signal to enter the moment when they should hear him cry, \"To me,\r\nDouglas!\" he went round by the secret passage, so that seeing him come\r\nin by his usual door the queen’s suspicions might not be roused by his\r\nunlooked-for visit.\r\n\r\nMary was at supper with six persons, having, say de Thou and Melville,\r\nRizzio seated on her right; while, on the contrary, Carapden assures us\r\nthat he was eating standing at a sideboard. The talk was gay and\r\nintimate; for all were giving themselves up to the ease one feels at\r\nbeing safe and warm, at a hospitable board, while the snow is beating\r\nagainst the windows and the wind roaring in the chimneys. Suddenly Mary,\r\nsurprised that the most profound silence had succeeded to the lively and\r\nanimated flow of words among her guests since the beginning of supper,\r\nand suspecting, from their glances, that the cause of their uneasiness\r\nwas behind her, turned round and saw Darnley leaning on the back of her\r\nchair. The queen shuddered; for although her husband was smiling when\r\nlooking at Rizzio, this smile had assumed such a strange expression\r\nthat it was clear that something terrible was about to happen. At the\r\nsame moment, Mary heard in the next room a heavy, dragging step draw\r\nnear the cabinet, then the tapestry was raised, and Lord Ruthven, in\r\narmour of which he could barely support the weight, pale as a ghost,\r\nappeared on the threshold, and, drawing his sword in silence, leaned\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nThe queen thought he was delirious.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want, my lord?\" she said to him; \"and why do you come to\r\nthe palace like this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ask the king, madam,\" replied Ruthven in an indistinct voice. \"It is\r\nfor him to answer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Explain, my lord,\" Mary demanded, turning again towards Darnley; \"what\r\ndoes such a neglect of ordinary propriety mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"It means, madam,\" returned Darnley, pointing to Rizzio, \"that that man\r\nmust leave here this very minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"That man is mine, my lord,\" Mary said, rising proudly, \"and\r\nconsequently takes orders only from me.\"\r\n\r\n\"To me, Douglas!\" cried Darnley.\r\n\r\nAt these words, the conspirators, who for some moments had drawn nearer\r\nRuthven, fearing, so changeable was Darnley’s character, lest he had\r\nbrought them in vain and would not dare to utter the signal—at these\r\nwords, the conspirators rushed into the room with such haste that they\r\noverturned the table. Then David Rizzio, seeing that it was he alone\r\nthey wanted, threw himself on his knees behind the queen, seizing the\r\nhem of her robe and crying in Italian, \"Giustizia! giustizia!\" Indeed,\r\nthe queen, true to her character, not allowing herself to be intimidated\r\nby this terrible irruption, placed herself in front of Rizzio and\r\nsheltered him behind her Majesty. But she counted too much on the\r\nrespect of a nobility accustomed to struggle hand to hand with its kings\r\nfor five centuries. Andrew Carew held a dagger to her breast and\r\nthreatened to kill her if she insisted on defending any longer him whose\r\ndeath was resolved upon. Then Darnley, without consideration for the\r\nqueen’s pregnancy, seized her round the waist and bore her away from\r\nRizzio, who remained on his knees pale and trembling, while Douglas’s\r\nbastard, confirming the prediction of the astrologer who had warned\r\nRizzio to beware of a certain bastard, drawing the king’s own dagger,\r\nplunged it into the breast of the minister, who fell wounded, but not\r\ndead. Morton immediately took him by the feet and dragged him from the\r\ncabinet into the larger room, leaving on the floor that long track of\r\nblood which is still shown there; then, arrived there, each rushed upon\r\nhim as upon a quarry, and set upon the corpse, which they stabbed in\r\nfifty-six places. Meanwhile Darnley held the queen, who, thinking that\r\nall was not over, did not cease crying for mercy. But Ruthven came back,\r\npaler than at first, and at Darnley’s inquiry if Rizzio were dead, he\r\nnodded in the affirmative; then, as he could not bear further fatigue in\r\nhis convalescent state, he sat down, although the queen, whom Darnley\r\nhad at last released, remained standing on the same spot. At this Mary\r\ncould not contain herself.\r\n\r\n\"My lord,\" cried she, \"who has given you permission to sit down in my\r\npresence, and whence comes such insolence?\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" Ruthven answered, \"I act thus not from insolence, but from\r\nweakness; for, to serve your husband, I have just taken more exercise\r\nthan my doctors allow\". Then turning round to a servant, \"Give me a\r\nglass of wine,\" said he, showing Darnley his bloody dagger before\r\nputting it back in its sheath, \"for here is the proof that I have well\r\nearned it\". The servant obeyed, and Ruthven drained his glass with as\r\nmuch calmness as if he had just performed the most innocent act.\r\n\r\n\"My lord,\" the queen then said, taking a step towards him, \"it may be\r\nthat as I am a woman, in spite of my desire and my will, I never find an\r\nopportunity to repay you what you are doing to me; but,\" she added,\r\nenergetically striking her womb with her hand, \"he whom I bear there,\r\nand whose life you should have respected, since you respect my Majesty\r\nso little, will one day revenge me for all these insults\". Then, with a\r\ngesture at once superb and threatening, she withdrew by Darnley’s door,\r\nwhich she closed behind her.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a great noise was heard in the queen’s room. Huntly,\r\nAthol, and Bothwell, who, we are soon about to see, play such an\r\nimportant part in the sequel of this history, were supping together in\r\nanother hall of the palace, when suddenly they had heard outcries and\r\nthe clash of arms, so that they had run with all speed. When Athol, who\r\ncame first, without knowing whose it was, struck against the dead body\r\nof Rizzio, which was stretched at the top of the staircase, they\r\nbelieved, seeing someone assassinated, that the lives of the king and\r\nqueen were threatened, and they had drawn their swords to force the door\r\nthat Morton was guarding. But directly Darnley understood what was going\r\non, he darted from the cabinet, followed by Ruthven, and showing himself\r\nto the newcomers—\r\n\r\n\"My lords,\" he said, \"the persons of the queen and myself are safe, and\r\nnothing has occurred here but by our orders. Withdraw, then; you will\r\nknow more about it in time. As to him,\" he added, holding up Rizzio’s\r\nhead by the hair, whilst the bastard of Douglas lit up the face with a\r\ntorch so that it could be recognised, \"you see who it is, and whether it\r\nis worth your while to get into trouble for him\".\r\n\r\nAnd in fact, as soon as Huntly, Athol, and Bothwell had recognised the\r\nmusician-minister, they sheathed their swords, and, having saluted the\r\nking, went away.\r\n\r\nMary had gone away with a single thought in her heart, vengeance. But\r\nshe understood that she could not revenge herself at one and the same\r\ntime on her husband and his companions: she set to work, then, with all\r\nthe charms of her wit and beauty to detach the kind from his\r\naccomplices. It was not a difficult task: when that brutal rage which\r\noften carried Darnley beyond all bounds was spent, he was frightened\r\nhimself at the crime he had committed, and while the assassins,\r\nassembled by Murray, were resolving that he should have that greatly\r\ndesired crown matrimonial, Darnley, as fickle as he was violent, and as\r\ncowardly as he was cruel, in Mary’s very room, before the scarcely dried\r\nblood, made another compact, in which he engaged to deliver up his\r\naccomplices. Indeed, three days after the event that we have just\r\nrelated, the murderers learned a strange piece of news—that Darnley and\r\nMary, accompanied by Lord Seyton, had escaped together from Holyrood\r\nPalace. Three days later still, a proclamation appeared, signed by Mary\r\nand dated from Dunbar, which summoned round the queen, in her own name\r\nand the king’s, all the Scottish lords and barons, including those who\r\nhad been compromised in the affair of the \"run in every sense,\" to whom\r\nshe not only granted full and complete pardon, but also restored her\r\nentire confidence. In this way she separated Murray’s cause from that of\r\nMorton and the other assassins, who, in their turn, seeing that there\r\nwas no longer any safety for them in Scotland, fled to England, where\r\nall the queen’s enemies were always certain to find a warm welcome, in\r\nspite of the good relations which reigned in appearance between Mary and\r\nElizabeth. As to Bothwell, who had wanted to oppose the assassination,\r\nhe was appointed Warden of all the Marches of the Kingdom.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for her honour, Mary, always more the woman than the\r\nqueen, while, on the contrary, Elizabeth was always more the queen than\r\nthe woman, had no sooner regained her power than her first royal act was\r\nto exhume Rizzio, who had been quietly buried on the threshold of the\r\nchapel nearest Holyrood Palace, and to have him removed to the\r\nburial-place of the Scottish kings, compromising herself still more by\r\nthe honours she paid him dead than by the favour she had granted him\r\nliving.\r\n\r\nSuch an imprudent demonstration naturally led to fresh quarrels between\r\nMary and Darnley: these quarrels were the more bitter that, as one can\r\nwell understand, the reconciliation between the husband and wife, at\r\nleast on the latter’s side, had never been anything but a pretence; so\r\nthat, feeling herself in a stronger position still on account of her\r\npregnancy, she restrained herself no longer, and, leaving Darnley, she\r\nwent from Dunbar to Edinburgh Castle, where on June 19th, 1566, three\r\nmonths after the assassination of Rizzio, she gave birth to a son who\r\nafterwards became James VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nDirectly she was delivered, Mary sent for James Melville, her usual\r\nenvoy to Elizabeth, and charged him to convey this news to the Queen of\r\nEngland, and to beg her to be godmother to the royal child at the same\r\ntime. On arriving in London, Melville immediately presented himself at\r\nthe palace; but as there was a court ball, he could not see the queen,\r\nand contented himself with making known the reason for his journey to\r\nthe minister Cecil, and with begging him to ask his mistress for an\r\naudience next day. Elizabeth was dancing in a quadrille at the moment\r\nwhen Cecil, approaching her, said in a low voice, \"Queen Mary of\r\nScotland has just given birth to a son\". At these words she grew\r\nfrightfully pale, and, looking about her with a bewildered air, and as\r\nif she were about to faint, she leaned against an arm-chair; then, soon,\r\nnot being able to stand upright, she sat down, threw back her head, and\r\nplunged into a mournful reverie. Then one of the ladies of her court,\r\nbreaking through the circle which had formed round the queen, approached\r\nher, ill at ease, and asked her of what she was thinking so sadly. \"Ah!\r\nmadam,\" Elizabeth replied impatiently, \"do you not know that Mary Stuart\r\nhas given birth to a son, while I am but a barren stock, who will die\r\nwithout offspring?\"\r\n\r\nYet Elizabeth was too good a politician, in spite of her liability to be\r\ncarried away by a first impulse, to compromise herself by a longer\r\ndisplay of her grief. The ball was not discontinued on that account, and\r\nthe interrupted quadrille was resumed and finished.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Melville had his audience. Elizabeth received him to\r\nperfection, assuring him of all the pleasure that the news he brought\r\nhad caused her, and which, she said, had cured her of a complaint from\r\nwhich she had suffered for a fortnight. Melville replied that his\r\nmistress had hastened to acquaint her with her joy, knowing that she had\r\nno better friend; but he added that this joy had nearly cost Mary her\r\nlife, so grievous had been her confinement. As he was returning to this\r\npoint for the third time, with the object of still further increasing\r\nthe queen of England’s dislike to marriage—\r\n\r\n\"Be easy, Melville,\" Elizabeth answered him; \"you need not insist upon\r\nit. I shall never marry; my kingdom takes the place of a husband for me,\r\nand my subjects are my children. When I am dead, I wish graven on my\r\ntombstone: ’Here lies Elizabeth, who reigned so many years, and who died\r\na virgin.’\"\r\n\r\nMelville availed himself of this opportunity to remind Elizabeth of the\r\ndesire she had shown to see Mary, three or four years before; but\r\nElizabeth said, besides her country’s affairs, which necessitated her\r\npresence in the heart of her possessions, she did not care, after all\r\nshe had heard said of her rival’s beauty, to expose herself to a\r\ncomparison disadvantageous to her pride. She contented herself, then,\r\nwith choosing as her proxy the Earl of Bedford, who set out with several\r\nother noblemen for Stirling Castle, where the young prince was\r\nchristened with great pomp, and received the name of Charles James.\r\n\r\nIt was remarked that Darnley did not appear at this ceremony, and that\r\nhis absence seemed to scandalise greatly the queen of England’s envoy.\r\nOn the contrary, James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell, had the most important\r\nplace there.\r\n\r\nThis was because, since the evening when Bothwell, at Mary’s cries, had\r\nrun to oppose the murder of Rizzio, he had made great way in the queen’s\r\nfavour; to her party he himself appeared to be really attached, to the\r\nexclusion of the two others, the king’s and the Earl of Murray’s.\r\nBothwell was already thirty-five years old, head of the powerful family\r\nof Hepburn, which had great influence in East Lothian and the county of\r\nBerwick; for the rest, violent, rough, given to every kind of\r\ndebauchery, and capable of anything to satisfy an ambition that he did\r\nnot even give himself the trouble to hide. In his youth he had been\r\nreputed courageous, but for long he had had no serious opportunity to\r\ndraw the sword.\r\n\r\nIf the king’s authority had been shaken by Rizzio’s influence, it was\r\nentirely upset by Bothwell’s. The great nobles, following the\r\nfavourite’s example, no longer rose in the presence of Darnley, and\r\nceased little by little to treat him as their equal: his retinue was cut\r\ndown, his silver plate taken from him, and some officers who remained\r\nabout him made him buy their services with the most bitter vexations. As\r\nfor the queen, she no longer even took the trouble to conceal her\r\ndislike for him, avoiding him without consideration, to such a degree\r\nthat one day when she had gone with Bothwell to Alway, she left there\r\nagain immediately, because Darnley came to join her. The king, however,\r\nstill had patience; but a fresh imprudence of Mary’s at last led to the\r\nterrible catastrophe that, since the queen’s liaison with Bothwell, some\r\nhad already foreseen.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the month of October, 1566, while the queen was\r\nholding a court of justice at Jedburgh, it was announced to her that\r\nBothwell, in trying to seize a malefactor called John Elliot of Park,\r\nhad been badly wounded in the hand; the queen, who was about to attend\r\nthe council, immediately postponed the sitting till next day, and,\r\nhaving ordered a horse to be saddled, she set out for Hermitage Castle,\r\nwhere Bothwell was living, and covered the distance at a stretch,\r\nalthough it was twenty miles, and she had to go across woods, marshes,\r\nand rivers; then, having remained some hours tete-a-tete with him, she\r\nset out again with the same speed for Jedburgh, to which she returned in\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\nAlthough this proceeding had made a great deal of talk, which was\r\ninflamed still more by the queen’s enemies, who chiefly belonged to the\r\nReformed religion, Darnley did not hear of it till nearly two months\r\nafterwards—that is to say, when Bothwell, completely recovered, returned\r\nwith the queen to Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nThen Darnley thought that he ought not to put up any longer with such\r\nhumiliations. But as, since his treason to his accomplices, he had not\r\nfound in all Scotland a noble who would have drawn the sword for him, he\r\nresolved to go and seek the Earl of Lennox, his father, hoping that\r\nthrough his influence he could rally the malcontents, of whom there were\r\na great number since Bothwell had been in favour. Unfortunately,\r\nDarnley, indiscreet and imprudent as usual, confided this plan to some\r\nof his officers, who warned Bothwell of their master’s intention.\r\nBothwell did not seem to oppose the journey in any way; but Darnley was\r\nscarcely a mile from Edinburgh when he felt violent pains none the less,\r\nhe continued his road, and arrived very ill at Glasgow. He immediately\r\nsent for a celebrated doctor, called James Abrenets, who found his body\r\ncovered with pimples, and declared without any hesitation that he had\r\nbeen poisoned. However, others, among them Walter Scott, state that this\r\nillness was nothing else than smallpox.\r\n\r\nWhatever it may have been, the queen, in the presence of the danger her\r\nhusband ran, appeared to forget her resentment, and at the risk of what\r\nmight prove troublesome to herself, she went to Darnley, after sending\r\nher doctor in advance. It is true that if one is to believe in the\r\nfollowing letters, dated from Glasgow, which Mary is accused of having\r\nwritten to Bothwell, she knew the illness with which he was attacked too\r\nwell to fear infection. As these letters are little known, and seem to\r\nus very singular we transcribe them here; later we shall tell how they\r\nfell into the power of the Confederate lords, and from their hands\r\npassed into Elizabeth’s, who, quite delighted, cried on receiving them,\r\n\"God’s death, then I hold her life and honour in my hands!\"\r\n\r\nFIRST LETTER\r\n\r\n\"When I set out from the place where I had left my heart, judge in what\r\na condition I was, poor body without a soul: besides, during the whole\r\nof dinner I have not spoken to anyone, and no one has dared to approach\r\nme, for it was easy to see that there was something amiss. When I\r\narrived within a league of the town, the Earl of Lennox sent me one of\r\nhis gentlemen to make me his compliments, and to excuse himself for not\r\nhaving come in person; he has caused me to be informed, moreover, that\r\nhe did not dare to present himself before me after the reprimand that I\r\ngave Cunningham. This gentleman begged me, as if of his own accord, to\r\nexamine his master’s conduct, to ascertain if my suspicions were well\r\nfounded. I have replied to him that fear was an incurable disease, that\r\nthe Earl of Lennox would not be so agitated if his conscience reproached\r\nhim with nothing, and that if some hasty words had escaped me, they were\r\nbut just reprisals for the letter he had written me.\r\n\r\n\"None of the inhabitants visited me, which makes me think they are all\r\nin his interests; besides, they speak of him very favourably, as well as\r\nof his son. The king sent for Joachim yesterday, and asked him why I did\r\nnot lodge with him, adding that my presence would soon cure him, and\r\nasked me also with what object I had come: if it were to be reconciled\r\nwith him; if you were here; if I had taken Paris and Gilbert as\r\nsecretaries, and if I were still resolved to dismiss Joseph? I do not\r\nknow who has given him such accurate information. There is nothing, down\r\nto the marriage of Sebastian, with which he has not made himself\r\nacquainted. I have asked him the meaning of one of his letters, in which\r\nhe complains of the cruelty of certain people. He replied that he\r\nwas—stricken, but that my presence caused him so much joy that he\r\nthought he should die of it. He reproached me several times for being\r\ndreamy; I left him to go to supper; he begged me to return: I went back.\r\nThen he told me the story of his illness, and that he wished to make a\r\nwill leaving me everything, adding that I was a little the cause of his\r\ntrouble, and that he attributed it to my coldness. ’You ask me,’ added\r\nhe, ’who are the people of whom I complain: it is of you, cruel one, of\r\nyou, whom I have never been able to appease by my tears and my\r\nrepentance. I know that I have offended you, but not on the matter that\r\nyou reproach me with: I have also offended some of your subjects, but\r\nthat you have forgiven me. I am young, and you say that I always relapse\r\ninto my faults; but cannot a young man like me, destitute of experience,\r\ngain it also, break his promises, repent directly, and in time improve?\r\nIf you will forgive me yet once more, I will promise to offend you never\r\nagain. All the favour I ask of you is that we should live together like\r\nhusband and wife, to have but one bed and one board: if you are\r\ninflexible, I shall never rise again from here. I entreat you, tell me\r\nyour decision: God alone knows what I suffer, and that because I occupy\r\nmyself with you only, because I love and adore only you. If I have\r\noffended you sometimes, you must bear the reproach; for when someone\r\noffends me, if it were granted me to complain to you, I should not\r\nconfide my griefs to others; but when we are on bad terms, I am obliged\r\nto keep them to myself, and that maddens me.’\r\n\r\n\"He then urged me strongly to stay with him and lodge in his house; but\r\nI excused myself, and replied that he ought to be purged, and that he\r\ncould not be, conveniently, at Glasgow; then he told me that he knew I\r\nhad brought a letter for him, but that he would have preferred to make\r\nthe journey with me. He believed, I think, that I meant to send him to\r\nsome prison: I replied that I should take him to Craigmiller, that he\r\nwould find doctors there, that I should remain near him, and that we\r\nshould be within reach of seeing my son. He has answered that he will go\r\nwhere I wish to take him, provided that I grant him what he has asked.\r\nHe does not, however, wish to be seen by anyone.\r\n\r\n\"He has told me more than a hundred pretty things that I cannot repeat\r\nto you, and at which you yourself would be surprised: he did not want to\r\nlet me go; he wanted to make me sit up with him all night. As for me, I\r\npretended to believe everything, and I seemed to interest myself really\r\nin him. Besides, I have never seen him so small and humble; and if I had\r\nnot known how easily his heart overflows, and how mine is impervious to\r\nevery other arrow than those with which you have wounded it, I believe\r\nthat I should have allowed myself to soften; but lest that should alarm\r\nyou, I would die rather than give up what I have promised you. As for\r\nyou, be sure to act in the same way towards those traitors who will do\r\nall they can to separate you from me. I believe that all those people\r\nhave been cast in the same mould: this one always has a tear in his eye;\r\nhe bows down before everyone, from the greatest to the smallest; he\r\nwishes to interest them in his favour, and make himself pitied. His\r\nfather threw up blood to-day through the nose and mouth; think what\r\nthese symptoms mean. I have not seen him yet, for he keeps to the house.\r\nThe king wants me to feed him myself; he won’t eat unless I do. But,\r\nwhatever I may do, you will be deceived by it no more than I shall be\r\ndeceiving myself. We are united, you and I, to two kinds of very\r\ndetestable people [Mary means Miss Huntly, Bothwell’s wife, whom he\r\nrepudiated, at the king’s death, to marry the queen.]: that hell may\r\nsever these knots then, and that heaven may form better ones, that\r\nnothing can break, that it may make of us the most tender and faithful\r\ncouple that ever was; there is the profession of faith in which I would\r\ndie.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse my scrawl: you must guess more than the half of it, but I know\r\nno help for this. I am obliged to write to you hastily while everyone is\r\nasleep here: but be easy, I take infinite pleasure in my watch; for I\r\ncannot sleep like the others, not being able to sleep as I would\r\nlike—that is to say, in your arms.\r\n\r\n\"I am going to get into bed; I shall finish my letter tomorrow: I have\r\ntoo many things to tell to you, the night is too far advanced: imagine\r\nmy despair. It is to you I am writing, it is of myself that I converse\r\nwith you, and I am obliged to make an end.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot prevent myself, however, from filling up hastily the rest of\r\nmy paper. Cursed be the crazy creature who torments me so much! Were it\r\nnot for him, I could talk to you of more agreeable things: he is not\r\ngreatly changed; and yet he has taken a great deal o f %t. But he has\r\nnearly killed me with the fetid smell of his breath; for now his is\r\nstill worse than your cousin’s: you guess that this is a fresh reason\r\nfor my not approaching him; on the contrary, I go away as far as I can,\r\nand sit on a chair at the foot of his bed.\r\n\r\n\"Let us see if I forget anything:\r\n\r\n    \"His father's messenger on the road;\r\n     The question about Joachim;\r\n     The−state of my house;\r\n     The people of my suite;\r\n     Subject of my arrival;\r\n     Joseph;\r\n     Conversation between him and me;\r\n     His desire to please me and his repentance;\r\n     The explanation of his letter;\r\n     Mr. Livingston.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! I was forgetting that. Yesterday Livingston during supper told de\r\nRere in a low voice to drink to the health of one I knew well, and to\r\nbeg me to do him the honour. After supper, as I was leaning on his\r\nshoulder near the fire, he said to me, ’Is it not true that there are\r\nvisits very agreeable for those who pay them and those who receive them?\r\nBut, however satisfied they seem with your arrival, I challenge their\r\ndelight to equal the grief of one whom you have left alone to-day, and\r\nwho will never be content till he sees you again.’ I asked him of whom\r\nhe wished to speak to me. He then answered me by pressing my arm: ’Of\r\none of those who have not followed you; and among those it is easy for\r\nyou to guess of whom I want to speak.’\r\n\r\n\"I have worked till two o’clock at the bracelet; I have enclosed a\r\nlittle key which is attached by two strings: it is not as well worked as\r\nI should like, but I have not had time to make it better; I will make\r\nyou a finer one on the first occasion. Take care that it is not seen on\r\nyou; for I have worked at it before everyone, and it would be recognised\r\nto a certainty.\r\n\r\n\"I always return, in spite of myself, to the frightful attempt that you\r\nadvise. You compel me to concealments, and above all to treacheries that\r\nmake me shudder; I would rather die, believe me, than do such things;\r\nfor it makes my heart bleed. He does not want to follow me unless I\r\npromise him to have the selfsame bed and board with him as before, and\r\nnot to abandon him so often. If I consent to it, he says he will do all\r\nI wish, and will follow me everywhere; but he has begged me to put off\r\nmy departure for two days. I have pretended to agree to all he wishes;\r\nbut I have told him not to speak of our reconciliation to anyone, for\r\nfear it should make some lords uneasy. At last I shall take him\r\neverywhere I wish.... Alas! I have never deceived anyone; but what would\r\nI not do to please you? Command, and whatever happens, I shall obey. But\r\nsee yourself if one could not contrive some secret means in the shape of\r\na remedy. He must purge himself at Craigmiller and take baths there; he\r\nwill be some days without going out. So far as I can see, he is very\r\nuneasy; but he has great trust in what I tell him: however, his\r\nconfidence does not go so far as to allow him to open his mind to me. If\r\nyou like, I will tell him every thing: I can have no pleasure in\r\ndeceiving someone who is trusting. However, it will be just as you wish:\r\ndo not esteem me the less for that. It is you advised it; never would\r\nvengeance have taken me so far. Sometimes he attacks me in a very\r\nsensitive place, and he touches me to the quick when he tells me that\r\nhis crimes are known, but that every day greater ones are committed that\r\none uselessly attempts to hide, since all crimes, whatsoever they be,\r\ngreat or small, come to men’s knowledge and form the common subject of\r\ntheir discourse. He adds sometimes, in speaking to me of Madame de Rere,\r\n’I wish her services may do you honour.’ He has assured me that many\r\npeople thought, and that he thought himself, that I was not my own\r\nmistress; this is doubtless because I had rejected the conditions he\r\noffered me. Finally, it is certain that he is very uneasy about you know\r\nwhat, and that he even suspects that his life is aimed at. He is in\r\ndespair whenever the conversation turns on you, Livingston, and my\r\nbrother. However, he says neither good nor ill of absent people; but, on\r\nthe contrary, he always avoids speaking of them. His father keeps to the\r\nhouse: I have not seen him yet. A number of the Hamiltons are here, and\r\naccompany me everywhere; all the friends of the other one follow me each\r\ntime I go to see him. He has begged me to be at his rising to-morrow. My\r\nmessenger will tell you the rest.\r\n\r\n\"Burn my letter: there would be danger in keeping it. Besides, it is\r\nhardly worth the trouble, being filled only with dark thoughts.\r\n\r\n\"As for you, do not be offended if I am sad and uneasy to-day, that to\r\nplease you I rise above honour, remorse, and dangers. Do not take in bad\r\npart what I tell you, and do not listen to the malicious explanations of\r\nyour wife’s brother; he is a knave whom you ought not to hear to the\r\nprejudice of the most tender and most faithful mistress that ever was.\r\nAbove all, do not allow yourself to be moved by that woman: her sham\r\ntears are nothing in comparison with the real tears that I shed, and\r\nwith what love and constancy make me suffer at succeeding her; it is for\r\nthat alone that in spite of myself I betray all those who could cross my\r\nlove. God have mercy on me, and send you all the prosperity that a\r\nhumble and tender friend who awaits from you soon another reward wishes\r\nyou. It is very late; but it is always with regret that I lay down my\r\npen when I write to you; however, I shall not end my letter until I\r\nshall have kissed your hands. Forgive me that it is so ill-written:\r\nperhaps I do so expressly that you may be obliged to re-read it several\r\ntimes: I have transcribed hastily what I had written down on my tablets,\r\nand my paper has given out. Remember a tender friend, and write to her\r\noften: love me as tenderly as I love you, and remember:\r\n\r\n    \"Madame de Rere's words;\r\n     The English;\r\n     His mother;\r\n     The Earl of Argyll;\r\n     The Earl of Bothwell;\r\n     The Edinburgh dwelling.\"\r\n\r\nSECOND LETTER\r\n\r\n\"It seems that you have forgotten me during your absence, so much the\r\nmore that you had promised me, at setting out, to let me know in detail\r\neverything fresh that should happen. The hope of receiving your news was\r\ngiving me almost as much delight as your return could have brought me:\r\nyou have put it off longer than you promised me. As for me, although you\r\ndo not write, I play my part always. I shall take him to Craigmiller on\r\nMonday, and he will spend the whole of Wednesday there. On that day I\r\nshall go to Edinburgh to be bled there, unless you arrange otherwise at\r\nleast. He is more cheerful than usual, and he is better than ever.\r\n\r\n\"He says everything he can to persuade me that he loves me; he has a\r\nthousand attentions for me, and he anticipates me in everything: all\r\nthat is so pleasant for me, that I never go to him but the pain in my\r\nside comes on again, his company weighs on me so much. If Paris brought\r\nme what I asked him, I should be soon cured. If you have not yet\r\nreturned when I go you know where, write to me, I beg you, and tell me\r\nwhat you wish me to do; for if you do not manage things prudently, I\r\nforesee that the whole burden will fall on me: look into everything and\r\nweigh the affair maturely. I send you my letter by Beaton, who will set\r\nout the day which has been assigned to Balfour. It only remains for me\r\nto beg you to inform me of your journey.\r\n\r\n\"Glasgow, this Saturday morning.\"\r\n\r\nTHIRD LETTER\r\n\r\n\"I stayed you know where longer than I should have done, if it had not\r\nbeen to get from him something that the bearer of these presents will\r\ntell you it was a good opportunity for covering up our designs: I have\r\npromised him to bring the person you know to-morrow. Look after the\r\nrest, if you think fit. Alas! I have failed in our agreement, for you\r\nhave forbidden me to write to you, or to despatch a messenger to you.\r\nHowever, I do not intend to offend you: if you knew with what fears I am\r\nagitated, you would not have yourself so many doubts and suspicions. But\r\nI take them in good part, persuaded as I am that they have no other\r\ncause than love—love that I esteem more than anything on earth.\r\n\r\n\"My feelings and my favours are to me sure warrants for that love, and\r\nanswer to me for your heart; my trust is entire on this head: but\r\nexplain yourself, I entreat you, and open your soul to me; otherwise, I\r\nshall fear lest, by the fatality of my star, and by the too fortunate\r\ninfluence of the stars on women less tender and less faithful than I, I\r\nmay be supplanted in your heart as Medea was in Jason’s; not that I wish\r\nto compare you to a lover as unfortunate as Jason, and to parallel\r\nmyself with a monster like Medea, although you have enough influence\r\nover me to force me to resemble her each time our love exacts it, and\r\nthat it concerns me to keep your heart, which belongs to me, and which\r\nbelongs to me only. For I name as belonging to me what I have purchased\r\nwith the tender and constant love with which I have burned for you, a\r\nlove more alive to-day than ever, and which will end only with my life;\r\na love, in short, which makes me despise both the dangers and the\r\nremorse which will be perhaps its sad sequel. As the price of this\r\nsacrifice, I ask you but one favour, it is to remember a spot not far\r\nfrom here: I do not exact that you should keep your promise to-morrow;\r\nbut I want to see you to disperse your suspicions. I ask of God only one\r\nthing: it is that He should make you read my heart, which is less mine\r\nthan yours, and that He should guard you from every ill, at least during\r\nmy life: this life is dear to me only in so far as it pleases you, and\r\nas I please you myself. I am going to bed: adieu; give me your news\r\nto-morrow morning; for I shall be uneasy till I have it. Like a bird\r\nescaped from its cage, or the turtle-dove which has lost her mate, I\r\nshall be alone, weeping your absence, short as it may be. This letter,\r\nhappier than I, will go this evening where I cannot go, provided that\r\nthe messenger does not find you asleep, as I fear. I have not dared to\r\nwrite it in the presence of Joseph, of Sebastian, and of Joachim, who\r\nhad only just left me when I began it.\"\r\n\r\nThus, as one sees, and always supposing these letters to be genuine,\r\nMary had conceived for Bothwell one of those mad passions, so much the\r\nstronger in the women who are a prey to them, that one the less\r\nunderstands what could have inspired them. Bothwell was no longer young,\r\nBothwell was not handsome, and yet Mary sacrificed for him a young\r\nhusband, who was considered one of the handsomest men of his century. It\r\nwas like a kind of enchantment. Darnley, the sole obstacle to the union,\r\nhad been already condemned for a long time, if not by Mary, at least by\r\nBothwell; then, as his strong constitution had conquered the poison,\r\nanother kind of death was sought for.\r\n\r\nThe queen, as she announces in her letter to Bothwell, had refused to\r\nbring back Darnley with her, and had returned alone to Edinburgh.\r\nArrived there, she gave orders for the king to be moved, in his turn, in\r\na litter; but instead of taking him to Stirling or Holyrood, she decided\r\nto lodge him in the abbey of the Kirk of Field. The king made some\r\nobjections when he knew of this arrangement; however, as he had no power\r\nto oppose it, he contented himself with complaining of the solitude of\r\nthe dwelling assigned him; but the queen made answer that she could not\r\nreceive him at that moment, either at Holyrood or at Stirling, for fear,\r\nif his illness were infectious, lest he might give it to his son:\r\nDarnley was then obliged to make the best of the abode allotted him.\r\n\r\nIt was an isolated abbey, and little calculated by its position to\r\ndissipate the fears that the king entertained; for it was situated\r\nbetween two ruined churches and two cemeteries: the only house, which\r\nwas distant about a shot from a cross-bow, belonged to the Hamiltons,\r\nand as they were Darnley’s mortal enemies the neighbourhood was none the\r\nmore reassuring: further, towards the north, rose some wretched huts,\r\ncalled the \"Thieves’ cross-roads\". In going round his new residence,\r\nDarnley noticed that three holes, each large enough for a man to get\r\nthrough, had been made in the walls; he asked that these holes, through\r\nwhich ill-meaning persons could get in, should be stopped up: it was\r\npromised that masons should be sent; but nothing was done, and the holes\r\nremained open.\r\n\r\nThe day after his arrival at Kirk of Field, the king saw a light in that\r\nhouse near his which he believed deserted; next day he asked Alexander\r\nDurham whence it came, and he heard that the Archbishop of St. Andrew’s\r\nhad left his palace in Edinburgh and had housed there since the\r\npreceding evening, one didn’t know why: this news still further\r\nincreased the king’s uneasiness; the Archbishop of St. Andrew’s was one\r\nof his most declared enemies.\r\n\r\nThe king, little by little abandoned by all his servants lived on the\r\nfirst floor of an isolated pavilion, having about him only this same\r\nAlexander Durham, whom we have mentioned already, and who was his valet.\r\nDarnley, who had quite a special friendship for him, and who besides, as\r\nwe have said, feared some attack on his life at every moment, had made\r\nhim move his bed into his own apartment, so that both were sleeping in\r\nthe same room.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 8th February, Darnley awoke Durham: he thought he\r\nheard footsteps in the apartment beneath him. Durham rose, took a sword\r\nin one hand, a taper in the other, and went down to the ground floor;\r\nbut although Darnley was quite certain he had not been deceived, Durham\r\ncame up again a moment after, saying he had seen no one.\r\n\r\nThe morning of the next day passed without bringing anything fresh. The\r\nqueen was marrying one of her servants named Sebastian: he was an\r\nAuvergnat whom she had brought with her from France, and whom she liked\r\nvery much. However, as the king sent word that he had not seen her for\r\ntwo days, she left the wedding towards six o’clock in the evening, and\r\ncame to pay him a visit, accompanied by the Countess of Argyll and the\r\nCountess of Huntly. While she was there, Durham, in preparing his bed,\r\nset fire to his palliasse, which was burned as well as a part of the\r\nmattress; so that, having thrown them out of the window all in flames,\r\nfor fear lest the fire should reach the rest of the furniture, he found\r\nhimself without a bed, and asked permission to return to the town to\r\nsleep; but Darnley, who remembered his terror the night before, and who\r\nwas surprised at the promptness that had made Durham throw all his\r\nbedding out of the window, begged him not to go away, offering him one\r\nof his mattresses, or even to take him into his own bed. However, in\r\nspite of this offer, Durham insisted, saying that he felt unwell, and\r\nthat he should like to see a doctor the same evening. So the queen\r\ninterceded for Durham, and promised Darnley to send him another valet to\r\nspend the night with him: Darnley was then obliged to yield, and, making\r\nMary repeat that she would send him someone, he gave Durham leave for\r\nthat evening. At that moment Paris; of whom the queen speaks in her\r\nletters, came in: he was a young Frenchman who had been in Scotland for\r\nsome years, and who, after having served with Bothwell and Seyton, was\r\nat present with the queen. Seeing him, she got up, and as Darnley still\r\nwished to keep her—\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, my lord, it is impossible,\" said she, \"to come and see you. I\r\nhave left this poor Sebastian’s wedding, and I must return to it; for I\r\npromised to come masked to his ball.\"\r\n\r\nThe king dared not insist; he only reminded her of the promise that she\r\nhad made to send him a servant: Mary renewed it yet once again, and went\r\naway with her attendants. As for Durham, he had set out the moment he\r\nreceived permission.\r\n\r\nIt was nine o’clock in the evening. Darnley, left alone, carefully shut\r\nthe doors within, and retired to rest, though in readiness to rise to\r\nlet in the servant who should come to spend the night with him. Scarcely\r\nwas he in bed than the same noise that he had heard the night before\r\nrecommenced; this time Darnley listened with all the attention fear\r\ngives, and soon he had no longer any doubt but that several men were\r\nwalking about beneath him. It was useless to call, it was dangerous to\r\ngo out; to wait was the only course that remained to the king. He made\r\nsure again that the doors were well fastened, put his sword under his\r\npillow, extinguished his lamp for fear the light might betray him, and\r\nawaited in silence for his servant’s arrival; but the hours passed away,\r\nand the servant did not come. At one o’clock in the morning, Bothwell,\r\nafter having talked some while with the queen, in the presence of the\r\ncaptain of the guard, returned home to change his dress; after some\r\nminutes, he came out wrapped up in the large cloak of a German hussar,\r\nwent through the guard-house, and had the castle gate opened. Once\r\noutside, he took his way with all speed to Kirk of Field, which he\r\nentered by the opening in the wall: scarcely had he made a step in the\r\ngarden than he met James Balfour, governor of the castle.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said to him, \"how far have we got?\r\n\r\n\"Everything is ready,\" replied Balfour, \"and we were waiting for you to\r\nset fire to the fuse\". \"That is well,\" Bothwell answered—\"but first I\r\nwant to make sure that he is in his room.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words, Bothwell opened the pavilion door with a false key, and,\r\nhaving groped his way up the stairs; he went to listen at Darnley’s\r\ndoor. Darnley, hearing no further noise, had ended by going to sleep;\r\nbut he slept with a jerky breathing which pointed to his agitation.\r\nLittle mattered it to Bothwell what kind of sleep it was, provided that\r\nhe was really in his room. He went down again in silence, then, as he\r\nhad come up, and taking a lantern from one of the conspirators, he went\r\nhimself into the lower room to see if everything was in order: this room\r\nwas full of barrels of powder, and a fuse ready prepared wanted but a\r\nspark to set the whole on fire. Bothwell withdrew, then, to the end of\r\nthe garden with Balfour, David, Chambers, and three or four others,\r\nleaving one man to ignite the fuse. In a moment this man rejoined them.\r\n\r\nThere ensued some minutes of anxiety, during which the five men looked\r\nat one another in silence and as if afraid of themselves; then, seeing\r\nthat nothing exploded, Bothwell impatiently turned round to the\r\nengineer, reproaching him for having, no doubt through fear, done his\r\nwork badly. He assured his master that he was certain everything was all\r\nright, and as Bothwell, impatient, wanted to return to the house\r\nhimself, to make sure, he offered to go back and see how things stood.\r\nIn fact, he went back to the pavilion, and, putting his head through a\r\nkind of air-hole, he saw the fuse, which was still burning. Some seconds\r\nafterwards, Bothwell saw him come running back, making a sign that all\r\nwas going well; at the same moment a frightful report was heard, the\r\npavilion was blown to pieces, the town and the firth were lit up with a\r\nclearness exceeding the brightest daylight; then everything fell back\r\ninto night, and the silence was broken only by the fall of stones and\r\njoists, which came down as fast as hail in a hurricane.\r\n\r\nNext day the body of the king was found in a garden in the\r\nneighbourhood: it had been saved from the action of the fire by the\r\nmattresses on which he was lying, and as, doubtless, in his terror he\r\nhad merely thrown himself on his bed wrapped in his dressing-gown and in\r\nhis slippers, and as he was found thus, without his slippers, which were\r\nflung some paces away, it was believed that he had been first strangled,\r\nthen carried there; but the most probable version was that the murderers\r\nsimply relied upon powder—an auxiliary sufficiently powerful in itself\r\nfor them to have no fear it would fail them.\r\n\r\nWas the queen an accomplice or not? No one has ever known save herself,\r\nBothwell, and God; but, yes or no, her conduct, imprudent this time as\r\nalways, gave the charge her enemies brought against her, if not\r\nsubstance, at least an appearance of truth. Scarcely had she heard the\r\nnews than she gave orders that the body should be brought to her, and,\r\nhaving had it stretched out upon a bench, she looked at it with more\r\ncuriosity than sadness; then the corpse, embalmed, was placed the same\r\nevening, without pomp, by the side of Rizzio’s.\r\n\r\nScottish ceremonial prescribes for the widows of kings retirement for\r\nforty days in a room entirely closed to the light of day: on the twelfth\r\nday Mary had the windows opened, and on the fifteenth set out with\r\nBothwell for Seaton, a country house situated five miles from the\r\ncapital, where the French ambassador, Ducroc, went in search of her, and\r\nmade her remonstrances which decided her to return to Edinburgh; but\r\ninstead of the cheers which usually greeted her coming, she was received\r\nby an icy silence, and a solitary woman in the crowd called out, \"God\r\ntreat her as she deserves!\"\r\n\r\nThe names of the murderers were no secret to the people. Bothwell having\r\nbrought a splendid coat which was too large for him to a tailor, asking\r\nhim to remake it to his measure, the man recognised it as having\r\nbelonged to the king. \"That’s right,\" said he; \"it is the custom for the\r\nexecutioner to inherit from the-condemned\". Meanwhile, the Earl of\r\nLennox, supported by the people’s murmurs, loudly demanded justice for\r\nhis son’s death, and came forward as the accuser of his murderers. The\r\nqueen was then obliged, to appease paternal clamour and public\r\nresentment, to command the Earl of Argyll, the Lord Chief Justice of the\r\nkingdom, to make investigations; the same day that this order was given,\r\na proclamation was posted up in the streets of Edinburgh, in which the\r\nqueen promised two thousand pounds sterling to whoever would make known\r\nthe king’s murderers. Next day, wherever this letter had been affixed,\r\nanother placard was found, worded thus:\r\n\r\n\"As it has been proclaimed that those who should make known the king’s\r\nmurderers should have two thousand pounds sterling, I, who have made a\r\nstrict search, affirm that the authors of the murder are the Earl of\r\nBothwell, James Balfour, the priest of Flisk, David, Chambers,\r\nBlackmester, Jean Spens, and the queen herself.\"\r\n\r\nThis placard was torn down; but, as usually happens, it had already been\r\nread by the entire population.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Lennox accused Bothwell, and public opinion, which also\r\naccused him, seconded the earl with such violence, that Mary was\r\ncompelled to bring him to trial: only every precaution was taken to\r\ndeprive the prosecutor of the power of convicting the accused. On the\r\n28th March, the Earl of Lennox received notice that the 12th April was\r\nfixed for the trial: he was granted a fortnight to collect decisive\r\nproofs against the most powerful man in all Scotland; but the Earl of\r\nLennox, judging that this trial was a mere mockery, did not appear.\r\nBothwell, on the contrary, presented himself at the court, accompanied\r\nby five thousand partisans and two hundred picked fusiliers, who guarded\r\nthe doors directly he had entered; so that he seemed to be rather a king\r\nwho is about to violate the law than an accused who comes to submit to\r\nit. Of course there happened what was certain to happen—that is to say,\r\nthe jury acquitted Bothwell of the crime of which everyone, the judges\r\nincluded, knew him to be guilty.\r\n\r\nThe day of the trial, Bothwell had this written challenge placarded:\r\n\r\n\"Although I am sufficiently cleared of the murder of the king, of which\r\nI have been falsely accused, yet, the better to prove my innocence, I\r\nam, ready to engage in combat with whomsoever will dare to maintain that\r\nI have killed the king.\"\r\n\r\nThe day after, this reply appeared:\r\n\r\n\"I accept the challenge, provided that you select neutral ground.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, judgment had been barely given, when rumours of a marriage\r\nbetween the queen and the Earl of Bothwell were abroad. However strange\r\nand however mad this marriage, the relations of the two lovers were so\r\nwell known that no one doubted but that it was true. But as everyone\r\nsubmitted to Bothwell, either through fear or through ambition, two men\r\nonly dared to protest beforehand against this union: the one was Lord\r\nHerries, and the other James Melville.\r\n\r\nMary was at Stirling when Lord Herries, taking advantage of Bothwell’s\r\nmomentary absence, threw himself at her feet, imploring her not to lose\r\nher honour by marrying her husband’s murderer, which could not fail to\r\nconvince those who still doubted it that she was his accomplice. But the\r\nqueen, instead of thanking Herries for this devotion, seemed very much\r\nsurprised at his boldness, and scornfully signing to him to rise, she\r\ncoldly replied that her heart was silent as regarded the Earl of\r\nBothwell, and that, if she should ever re-marry, which was not probable,\r\nshe would neither forget what she owed to her people nor what she owed\r\nto herself.\r\n\r\nMelville did not allow himself to be discouraged by this experience, and\r\npretended, to have received a letter that one of his friends, Thomas\r\nBishop, had written him from England. He showed this letter to the\r\nqueen; but at the first lines Mary recognised the style, and above all\r\nthe friendship of her ambassador, and giving the letter to the Earl of\r\nLivingston, who was present, \"There is a very singular letter,\" said\r\nshe. \"Read it. It is quite in Melville’s manner.\"\r\n\r\nLivingston glanced through the letter, but had scarcely read the half of\r\nit when he took Melville by the hand, and drawing him into the embrasure\r\nof a window,\r\n\r\n\"My dear Melville,\" said he, \"you were certainly mad when you just now\r\nimparted this letter to the queen: as soon as the Earl of Bothwell gets\r\nwind of it, and that will not be long, he will have you assassinated.\r\nYou have behaved like an honest man, it is true; but at court it is\r\nbetter to behave as a clever man. Go away, then, as quickly as possible;\r\nit is I who recommend it.\"\r\n\r\nMelville did not require to be told twice, and stayed away for a week.\r\nLivingston was not mistaken: scarcely had Bothwell returned to the queen\r\nthan he knew all that had passed. He burst out into curses against\r\nMelville, and sought for him everywhere; but he could not find him.\r\n\r\nThis beginning of opposition, weak as it was, none the less disquieted\r\nBothwell, who, sure of Mary’s love, resolved to make short work of\r\nthings. Accordingly, as the queen was returning from Stirling to\r\nEdinburgh some days after the scenes we have just related, Bothwell\r\nsuddenly appeared at the Bridge of Grammont with a thousand horsemen,\r\nand, having disarmed the Earl of Huntly, Livingston, and Melville, who\r\nhad returned to his mistress, he seized the queen’s horse by the bridle,\r\nand with apparent violence he forced Mary to turn back and follow him to\r\nDunbar; which the queen did without any resistance—a strange thing for\r\none of Mary’s character.\r\n\r\nThe day following, the Earls of Huntly, Livingston, Melville, and the\r\npeople in their train were set at liberty; then, ten days afterwards,\r\nBothwell and the queen, perfectly reconciled, returned to Edinburgh\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nTwo days after this return, Bothwell gave a great dinner to the nobles\r\nhis partisans in a tavern. When the meal was ended, on the very same\r\ntable, amid half-drained glasses and empty bottles, Lindsay, Ruthven,\r\nMorton, Maitland, and a dozen or fifteen other noblemen signed a bond\r\nwhich not only set forth that upon their souls and consciences Bothwell\r\nwas innocent, but which further denoted him as the most suitable husband\r\nfor the queen. This bond concluded with this sufficiently strange\r\ndeclaration:\r\n\r\n\"After all, the queen cannot do otherwise, since the earl has carried\r\nher off and has lain with her.\"\r\n\r\nYet two circumstances were still opposed to this marriage: the first,\r\nthat Bothwell had already been married three times, and that his three\r\nwives were living; the second, that having carried off the queen, this\r\nviolence might cause to be regarded as null the alliance which she\r\nshould contract with him: the first of these objections was attended to,\r\nto begin with, as the one most difficult to solve.\r\n\r\nBothwell’s two first wives were of obscure birth, consequently he\r\nscorned to disquiet himself about them; but it was not so with the\r\nthird, a daughter of that Earl of Huntly who been trampled beneath the\r\nhorses’ feet, and a sister of Gordon, who had been decapitated.\r\nFortunately for Bothwell, his past behaviour made his wife long for a\r\ndivorce with an eagerness as great as his own. There was not much\r\ndifficulty, then, in persuading her to bring a charge of adultery\r\nagainst her husband. Bothwell confessed that he had had criminal\r\nintercourse with a relative of his wife, and the Archbishop of St.\r\nAndrews, the same who had taken up his abode in that solitary house at\r\nKirk of Field to be present at Darnley’s death, pronounced the marriage\r\nnull. The case was begun, pushed on, and decided in ten days.\r\n\r\nAs to the second obstacle, that of the violence used to the queen, Mary\r\nundertook to remove it herself; for, being brought before the court, she\r\ndeclared that not only did she pardon Bothwell for his conduct as\r\nregarded her, but further that, knowing him to be a good and faithful\r\nsubject, she intended raising him immediately to new honours. In fact,\r\nsome days afterwards she created him Duke of Orkney, and on the 15th of\r\nthe same month—that is to say, scarcely four months after the death of\r\nDarnley—with levity that resembled madness, Mary, who had petitioned for\r\na dispensation to wed a Catholic prince, her cousin in the third degree,\r\nmarried Bothwell, a Protestant upstart, who, his divorce\r\nnotwithstanding, was still bigamous, and who thus found himself in the\r\nposition of having four wives living, including the queen.\r\n\r\nThe wedding was dismal, as became a festival under such outrageous\r\nauspices. Morton, Maitland, and some base flatterers of Bothwell alone\r\nwere present at it. The French ambassador, although he was a creature of\r\nthe House of Guise, to which the queen belonged, refused to attend it.\r\n\r\nMary’s delusion was short-lived: scarcely was she in Bothwell’s power\r\nthan she saw what a master she had given herself. Gross, unfeeling, and\r\nviolent, he seemed chosen by Providence to avenge the faults of which he\r\nhad been the instigator or the accomplice. Soon his fits of passion\r\nreached such a point, that one day, no longer able to endure them, Mary\r\nseized a dagger from Erskine, who was present with Melville at one of\r\nthese scenes, and would have struck herself, saying that she would\r\nrather die than continue living unhappily as she did; yet, inexplicable\r\nas it seems, in spite of these miseries, renewed without ceasing, Mary,\r\nforgetting that she was wife and queen, tender and submissive as a\r\nchild, was always the first to be reconciled with Bothwell.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, these public scenes gave a pretext to the nobles, who only\r\nsought an opportunity for an outbreak. The Earl of Mar, the young\r\nprince’s tutor, Argyll, Athol, Glencairn, Lindley, Boyd, and even Morton\r\nand Maitland themselves, those eternal accomplices of Bothwell, rose,\r\nthey said, to avenge the death of the king, and to draw the son from\r\nhands which had killed the father and which were keeping the mother\r\ncaptive. As to Murray, he had kept completely in the background during\r\nall the last events; he was in the county of Fife when the king was\r\nassassinated, and three days before the trial of Bothwell he had asked\r\nand obtained from his sister permission to take a journey on the\r\nContinent.\r\n\r\nThe insurrection took place in such a prompt and instantaneous manner,\r\nthat the Confederate lords, whose plan was to surprise and seize both\r\nMary and Bothwell, thought they would succeed at the first attempt.\r\n\r\nThe king and queen were at table with Lord Borthwick, who was\r\nentertaining them, when suddenly it was announced that a large body of\r\narmed men was surrounding the castle: Bothwell and Mary suspected that\r\nthey were aimed at, and as they had no means of resistance, Bothwell\r\ndressed himself as a squire, Mary as a page, and both immediately taking\r\nhorse, escaped by one door just as the Confederates were coming in by\r\nthe other. The fugitives withdrew to Dunbar.\r\n\r\nThere they called together all Bothwell’s friends, and made them sign a\r\nkind of treaty by which they undertook to defend the queen and her\r\nhusband. In the midst of all this, Murray arrived from France, and\r\nBothwell offered the document to him as to the others; but Murray\r\nrefused to put his signature to it, saying that it was insulting him to\r\nthink he need be bound by a written agreement when it was a question of\r\ndefending his sister and his queen. This refusal having led to an\r\naltercation between him and Bothwell, Murray, true to his system of\r\nneutrality, withdrew into his earldom, and let affairs follow without\r\nhim the fatal decline they had taken.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Confederates, after having failed at Borthwick, not\r\nfeeling strong enough to attack Bothwell at Dunbar, marched upon\r\nEdinburgh, where they had an understanding with a man of whom Bothwell\r\nthought himself sure. This man was James Balfour, governor of the\r\ncitadel, the same who had presided over the preparation of the mine\r\nwhich had blown up Darnley, and whom Bothwell had, met on entering the\r\ngarden at Kirk of Field. Not only did Balfour deliver Edinburgh Castle\r\ninto the hands of the Confederates, but he also gave them a little\r\nsilver coffer of which the cipher, an \"F\" crowned, showed that it had\r\nbelonged to Francis II; and in fact it was a gift from her first\r\nhusband, which the queen had presented to Bothwell. Balfour stated that\r\nthis coffer contained precious papers, which in the present\r\ncircumstances might be of great use to Mary’s enemies. The Confederate\r\nlords opened it, and found inside the three genuine or spurious letters\r\nthat we have quoted, the marriage contract of Mary and Bothwell, and\r\ntwelve poems in the queen’s handwriting. As Balfour had said, therein\r\nlay, for her enemies, a rich and precious find, which was worth more\r\nthan a victory; for a victory would yield them only the queen’s life,\r\nwhile Balfour’s treachery yielded them her honour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Bothwell had levied some troops, and thought himself in a\r\nposition to hold the country: accordingly, he set out with his army,\r\nwithout even waiting for the Hamiltons, who were assembling their\r\nvassals, and June 15th, 1567, the two opposed forces were face to face.\r\nMary, who desired to try to avoid bloodshed, immediately sent the French\r\nambassador to the Confederate lords to exhort them to lay aside their\r\narms; but they replied \"that the queen deceived herself in taking them\r\nfor rebels; that they were marching not against her, but against\r\nBothwell.\" Then the king’s friends did what they could to break off the\r\nnegotiations and give battle: it was already too late; the soldiers knew\r\nthat they were defending the cause of one man, and that they were going\r\nto fight for a woman’s caprice, and not for the good of the country:\r\nthey cried aloud, then, that \"since Bothwell alone was aimed at, it was\r\nfor Bothwell to defend his cause\". And he, vain and blustering as usual,\r\ngave out that he was ready to prove his innocence in person against\r\nwhomsoever would dare to maintain that he was guilty. Immediately\r\neveryone with any claim to nobility in the rival camp accepted the\r\nchallenge; and as the honour was given to the bravest, Kirkcaldy of\r\nGrange, Murray of Tullibardine, and Lord Lindsay of Byres defied him\r\nsuccessively. But, be it that courage failed him, be it that in the\r\nmoment of danger he did not himself believe in the justice of his cause,\r\nhe, to escape the combat, sought such strange pretexts that the queen\r\nherself was ashamed; and his most devoted friends murmured.\r\n\r\nThen Mary, perceiving the fatal humour of men’s minds, decided not to\r\nrun the risk of a battle. She sent a herald to Kirkcaldy of Grange, who\r\nwas commanding an outpost, and as he was advancing without distrust to\r\nconverse with the queen, Bothwell, enraged at his own cowardice, ordered\r\na soldier to fire upon him; but this time Mary herself interposed,\r\nforbidding him under pain of death to offer the least violence. In the\r\nmeanwhile, as the imprudent order given by Bothwell spread through the\r\narmy, such murmurs burst forth that he clearly saw that his cause was\r\nfor ever lost.\r\n\r\nThat is what the queen thought also; for the result of her conference\r\nwith Lord Kirkcaldy was that she should abandon Bothwell’s cause, and\r\npass over into the camp of the Confederates, on condition that they\r\nwould lay down their arms before her and bring her as queen to\r\nEdinburgh. Kirkcaldy left her to take these conditions to the nobles,\r\nand promised to return next day with a satisfactory answer. But at the\r\nmoment of leaving Bothwell, Mary was seized again with that fatal love\r\nfor him that she was never able to surmount, and felt herself overcome\r\nwith such weakness, that, weeping bitterly, and before everyone, she\r\nwanted Kirkcaldy to be told that she broke off all negotiations;\r\nhowever, as Bothwell had understood that he was no longer safe in camp,\r\nit was he who insisted that things should remain as they were; and,\r\nleaving Mary in tears, he mounted, and setting off at full speed, he did\r\nnot stop till he reached Dunbar.\r\n\r\nNext day, at the time appointed, the arrival of Lord Kirkcaldy of Grange\r\nwas announced by the trumpeters preceding him. Mary mounted directly and\r\nwent to meet him; them, as he alighted to greet her, \"My lord;\" said\r\nshe, \"I surrender to you, on the conditions that you have proposed to me\r\non the part of the nobles, and here is my hand as a sign of entire\r\nconfidence\". Kirkcaldy then knelt down, kissed, the queen’s hand\r\nrespectfully; and, rising, he took her horse by the bridle and led it\r\ntowards the Confederates’ camp.\r\n\r\nEveryone of any rank in the army received her with such marks of respect\r\nas entirely to satisfy her; but it was not so at all with the soldiers\r\nand common people. Hardly had the queen reached the second line, formed\r\nby them, than great murmurs arose, and several voices cried, \"To the\r\nstake, the adulteress! To the stake, the parricide!\" However, Mary bore\r\nthese outrages stoically enough but a more terrible trial yet was in\r\nstore for her. Suddenly she saw rise before her a banner, on which was\r\ndepicted on one side the king dead and stretched out in the fatal\r\ngarden, and on the other the young prince kneeling, his hands joined and\r\nhis eyes raised to heaven, with this inscription, \"O Lord! judge and\r\nrevenge my cause!\" Mary reined in her horse abruptly at this sight, and\r\nwanted to turn back; but she had scarcely moved a few paces when the\r\naccusing banner again blocked her passage. Wherever she went, she met\r\nthis dreadful apparition. For two hours she had incessantly under her\r\neyes the king’s corpse asking vengeance, and the young prince her son\r\npraying God to punish the murderers. At last she could endure it no\r\nlonger, and, crying out, she threw herself back, having completely lost\r\nconsciousness, and would have fallen, if someone had not caught hold of\r\nher. In the evening she entered Edinburgh, always preceded by the cruel\r\nbanner, and she already had rather the air of a prisoner than of a\r\nqueen; for, not having had a moment during the day to attend to her\r\ntoilet, her hair was falling in disorder about her shoulders, her face\r\nwas pale and showed traces of tears; and finally, her clothes were\r\ncovered with dust and mud. As she proceeded through the town, the\r\nhootings of the people and the curses of the crowd followed her. At\r\nlast, half dead with fatigue, worn out with grief, bowed down with\r\nshame, she reached the house of the Lord Provost; but scarcely had she\r\ngot there when the entire population of Edinburgh crowded into the\r\nsquare, with cries that from time to time assumed a tone of terrifying\r\nmenace. Several times, then, Mary wished to go to the window, hoping\r\nthat the sight of her, of which she had so often proved the influence,\r\nwould disarm this multitude; but each time she saw this banner unfurling\r\nitself like a bloody curtain between herself and the people—a terrible\r\nrendering of their feelings.\r\n\r\nHowever, all this hatred was meant still more for Bothwell than for her:\r\nthey were pursuing Bothwell in Darnley’s widow. The curses were for\r\nBothwell: Bothwell was the adulterer, Bothwell was the murderer,\r\nBothwell was the coward; while Mary was the weak, fascinated woman, who,\r\nthat same evening, gave afresh proof of her folly.\r\n\r\nIn fact, directly the falling night had scattered the crowd and a little\r\nquiet was regained, Mary, ceasing to be uneasy on her own account,\r\nturned immediately to Bothwell, whom she had been obliged to abandon,\r\nand who was now proscribed and fleeing; while she, as she believed, was\r\nabout to reassume her title and station of queen. With that eternal\r\nconfidence of the woman in her own love, by which she invariably\r\nmeasures the love of another, she thought that Bothwell’s greatest\r\ndistress was to have lost, not wealth and power, but to have lost\r\nherself. So she wrote him a long letter, in which, forgetful of herself,\r\nshe promised him with the most tender expressions of love never to\r\ndesert him, and to recall him to her directly the breaking up of the\r\nConfederate lords should give her power to do so; then, this letter\r\nwritten, she called a soldier, gave him a purse of gold, and charged him\r\nto take this letter to Dunbar, where Bothwell ought to be, and if he\r\nwere already gone, to follow him until he came up with him.\r\n\r\nThen she went to bed and slept more calmly; for, unhappy as she was, she\r\nbelieved she had just sweetened misfortunes still greater than hers.\r\n\r\nNext day the queen was awakened by the step of an armed man who entered\r\nher room. Both astonished and frightened at this neglect of propriety,\r\nwhich could augur nothing good, Mary sat up in bed, and parting the\r\ncurtains, saw standing before her Lord Lindsay of Byres: she knew he was\r\none of her oldest friends, so she asked him in a voice which she vainly\r\ntried to make confident, what he wanted of her at such a time.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know this writing, madam?\" Lord Lindsay asked in a rough voice,\r\npresenting to the queen the letter she had written to Bothwell at night,\r\nwhich the soldier had carried to the Confederate lords, instead of\r\ntaking to its address.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, doubtless, my lord,\" the queen answered; \"but am I already a\r\nprisoner, then, that my correspondence is intercepted? or is it no\r\nlonger allowed to a wife to write to her husband?\"\r\n\r\n\"When the husband is a traitor,\" replied Lindsay, \"no, madam, it is no\r\nlonger allowed to a wife to write to her husband—at least, however, if\r\nthis wife have a part in his treason; which seems to me, besides, quite\r\nproved by the promise you make to this wretch to recall him to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"My lord,\" cried Mary, interrupting Lindsay, \"do you forget that you are\r\nspeaking to your queen.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was a time, madam,\" Lindsay replied, \"when I should have spoken\r\nto you in a more gentle voice, and bending the knee, although it is not\r\nin the nature of us old Scotch to model ourselves on your French\r\ncourtiers; but for some time, thanks to your changing loves, you have\r\nkept us so often in the field, in harness, that our voices are hoarse\r\nfrom the cold night air, and our stiff knees can no longer bend in our\r\narmour: you must then take me just as I am, madam; since to-day, for the\r\nwelfare of Scotland, you are no longer at liberty to choose your\r\nfavourites.\"\r\n\r\nMary grew frightfully pale at this want of respect, to which she was not\r\nyet accustomed; but quickly containing her anger, as far as possible—\r\n\r\n\"But still, my lord,\" said she, \"however disposed I may be to take you\r\nas you are, I must at least know by what right you come here. That\r\nletter which you are holding in your hand would lead me to think it is\r\nas a spy, if the ease with which you enter my room without being asked\r\ndid not make me believe it is as a gaoler. Have the goodness, then, to\r\ninform me by which of these two names I must call you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither by one nor the other, madam; for I am simply your\r\nfellow-traveller, chef of the escort which is to take you to Lochleven\r\nCastle, your future residence. And yet, scarcely have I arrived there\r\nthan I shall be obliged to leave you to go and assist the Confederate\r\nlords choose a regent for the kingdom.\"\r\n\r\n\"So,\" said Mary, \"it was as prisoner and not as queen that I surrendered\r\nto Lord Kirkcaldy. It seems to me that things were agreed upon\r\notherwise; but I am glad to see how much time Scotch noblemen need to\r\nbetray their sworn undertakings\".\r\n\r\n\"Your Grace forgets that these engagements were made on one condition,\"\r\nLindsay answered.\r\n\r\n\"On which?\" Mary asked.\r\n\r\n\"That you should separate for ever from your husband’s murderer; and\r\nthere is the proof,\" he added, showing the letter, \"that you had\r\nforgotten your promise before we thought of revoking ours.\"\r\n\r\n\"And at what o’clock is my departure fixed?\" said Mary, whom this\r\ndiscussion was beginning to fatigue.\r\n\r\n\"At eleven o’clock, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is well, my lord; as I have no desire to make your lordship wait,\r\nyou will have the goodness, in withdrawing, to send me someone to help\r\nme dress, unless I am reduced to wait upon myself.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, in pronouncing these words, Mary made a gesture so imperious, that\r\nwhatever may have been Lindsay’s wish to reply, he bowed and went out.\r\nBehind him entered Mary Seyton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time appointed the queen was ready: she had suffered so much at\r\nEdinburgh that she left it without any regret. Besides, whether to spare\r\nher the humiliations of the day before, or to conceal her departure from\r\nany partisans who might remain to her, a litter had been made ready.\r\nMary got into it without any resistance, and after two hours’ journey\r\nshe reached Duddington; there a little vessel was waiting for her, which\r\nset sail directly she was on board, and next day at dawn she disembarked\r\non the other side of the Firth of Forth in the county of Fife.\r\n\r\nMary halted at Rosythe Castle only just long enough to breakfast, and\r\nimmediately recommenced her journey; for Lord Lindsay had declared that\r\nhe wished to reach his destination that same evening. Indeed, as the sun\r\nwas setting, Mary perceived gilded with his last rays the high towers of\r\nLochleven Castle, situated on an islet in the midst of the lake of the\r\nsame name.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the royal prisoner was already expected at Lochleven Castle,\r\nfor, on reaching the lake side, Lord Lindsay’s equerry unfurled his\r\nbanner, which till then had remained in its case, and waved it from\r\nright to left, while his master blew a little hunting bugle which he\r\nwore hanging from his neck. A boat immediately put off from the island\r\nand came towards the arrivals, set in motion by four vigorous oarsmen,\r\nwho had soon propelled it across the space which separated it from the\r\nbank. Mary silently got into it, and sat down at the stern, while Lord\r\nLindsay and his equerry stood up before her; and as her guide did not\r\nseem any more inclined to speak than she was herself to respond, she had\r\nplenty of time to examine her future dwelling.\r\n\r\nThe castle, or rather the fortress of Lochleven, already somewhat gloomy\r\nin its situation and architecture, borrowed fresh mournfulness still\r\nfrom the hour at which it appeared to the queen’s gaze. It was, so far\r\nas she could judge amid the mists rising from the lake, one of those\r\nmassive structures of the twelfth century which seem, so fast shut up\r\nare they, the stone armour of a giant. As she drew near, Mary began to\r\nmake out the contours of two great round towers, which flanked the\r\ncorners and gave it the severe character of a state prison. A clump of\r\nancient trees enclosed by a high wall, or rather by a rampart, rose at\r\nits north front, and seemed vegetation in stone, and completed the\r\ngeneral effect of this gloomy abode, while, on the contrary, the eye\r\nwandering from it and passing from islands to islands, lost itself in\r\nthe west, in the north, and in the south, in the vast plain of Kinross,\r\nor stopped southwards at the jagged summits of Ben Lomond, whose\r\nfarthest slopes died down on the shores of the lake.\r\n\r\nThree persons awaited Mary at the castle door: Lady Douglas, William\r\nDouglas her son, and a child of twelve who was called Little Douglas,\r\nand who was neither a son nor a brother of the inhabitants of the\r\ncastle, but merely a distant relative. As one can imagine, there were\r\nfew compliments between Mary and her hosts; and the queen, conducted to\r\nher apartment, which was on the first floor, and of which the windows\r\noverlooked the lake, was soon left with Mary Seyton, the only one of the\r\nfour Marys who had been allowed to accompany her.\r\n\r\nHowever, rapid as the interview had been, and short and measured the\r\nwords exchanged between the prisoner and her gaolers, Mary had had time,\r\ntogether with what she knew of them beforehand, to construct for herself\r\na fairly accurate idea of the new personages who had just mingled in her\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nLady Lochleven, wife of Lord William Douglas, of whom we have already\r\nsaid a few words at the beginning of this history, was a woman of from\r\nfifty-five to sixty years of age, who had been handsome enough in her\r\nyouth to fix upon herself the glances of King James V, and who had had a\r\nson by him, who was this same Murray whom we have already seen figuring\r\nso often in Mary’s history, and who, although his birth was\r\nillegitimate, had always been treated as a brother by the queen.\r\n\r\nLady Lochleven had had a momentary hope, so great was the king’s love\r\nfor her, of becoming his wife, which upon the whole was possible, the\r\nfamily of Mar, from which she was descended, being the equal of the most\r\nancient and the noblest families in Scotland. But, unluckily, perhaps\r\nslanderously, certain talk which was circulating among the young\r\nnoblemen of the time came to James’s ears; it was said that together\r\nwith her royal lover the beautiful favourite had another, whom she had\r\nchosen, no doubt from curiosity, from the very lowest class. It was\r\nadded that this Porterfeld, or Porterfield, was the real father of the\r\nchild who had already received the name of James Stuart, and whom the\r\nking was educating as his son at the monastery of St. Andrews. These\r\nrumours, well founded or not, had therefore stopped James V at the\r\nmoment when, in gratitude to her who had given him a son, he was on the\r\npoint of raising her to the rank of queen; so that, instead of marrying\r\nher himself, he had invited her to choose among the nobles at court; and\r\nas she was very handsome, and the king’s favour went with the marriage,\r\nthis choice, which fell on Lord William Douglas of Lochleven, did not\r\nmeet with any resistance on his part. However, in spite of this direct\r\nprotection, that James V preserved for her all his life, Lady Douglas\r\ncould never forget that she had fingered higher fortune; moreover, she\r\nhad a hatred for the one who, according to herself, had usurped her\r\nplace, and poor Mary had naturally inherited the profound animosity that\r\nLady Douglas bore to her mother, which had already come to light in the\r\nfew words that the two women had exchanged. Besides, in ageing, whether\r\nfrom repentance for her errors or from hypocrisy, Lady Douglas had\r\nbecome a prude and a puritan; so that at this time she united with the\r\nnatural acrimony of her character all the stiffness of the new religion\r\nshe had adopted.\r\n\r\nWilliam Douglas, who was the eldest son of Lord Lochleven, on his\r\nmother’s side half-brother of Murray, was a man of from thirty-five to\r\nthirty-six years of age, athletic, with hard and strongly pronounced\r\nfeatures, red-haired like all the younger branch, and who had inherited\r\nthat paternal hatred that for a century the Douglases cherished against\r\nthe Stuarts, and which was shown by so many plots, rebellions, and\r\nassassinations. According as fortune had favoured or deserted Murray,\r\nWilliam Douglas had seen the rays of the fraternal star draw near or\r\naway from him; he had then felt that he was living in another’s life,\r\nand was devoted, body and soul, to him who was his cause of greatness or\r\nof abasement. Mary’s fall, which must necessarily raise Murray, was thus\r\na source of joy for him, and the Confederate lords could not have chosen\r\nbetter than in confiding the safe-keeping of their prisoner to the\r\ninstinctive spite of Lady Douglas and to the intelligent hatred of her\r\nson.\r\n\r\nAs to Little Douglas, he was, as we have said, a child of twelve, for\r\nsome months an orphan, whom the Lochlevens had taken charge of, and whom\r\nthey made buy the bread they gave him by all sorts of harshness. The\r\nresult was that the child, proud and spiteful as a Douglas, and knowing,\r\nalthough his fortune was inferior, that his birth was equal to his proud\r\nrelatives, had little by little changed his early gratitude into lasting\r\nand profound hatred: for one used to say that among the Douglases there\r\nwas an age for loving, but that there was none for hating. It results\r\nthat, feeling his weakness and isolation, the child was self-contained\r\nwith strength beyond his years, and, humble and submissive in\r\nappearance, only awaited the moment when, a grown-up young man, he could\r\nleave Lochleven, and perhaps avenge himself for the proud protection of\r\nthose who dwelt there. But the feelings that we have just expressed did\r\nnot extend to all the members of the family: as much as from the bottom\r\nof his heart the little Douglas detested William and his mother, so much\r\nhe loved George, the second of Lady Lochleven’s sons, of whom we have\r\nnot yet spoken, because, being away from the castle when the queen\r\narrived, we have not yet found an opportunity to present him to our\r\nreaders.\r\n\r\nGeorge, who at this time might have been about twenty-five or twenty-six\r\nyears old, was the second son of Lord Lochleven; but by a singular\r\nchance, that his mother’s adventurous youth had caused Sir William to\r\ninterpret amiss, this second son had none of the characteristic features\r\nof the Douglases’ full cheeks, high colour, large ears, and red hair.\r\nThe result was that poor George, who, on the contrary, had been given by\r\nnature pale cheeks, dark blue eyes, and black hair, had been since\r\ncoming into the world an object of indifference to his father and of\r\ndislike to his elder brother. As to his mother, whether she were indeed\r\nin good faith surprised like Lord Douglas at this difference in race,\r\nwhether she knew the cause and inwardly reproached herself, George had\r\nnever been, ostensibly at least, the object of a very lively maternal\r\naffection; so the young man, followed from his childhood by a fatality\r\nthat he could not explain, had sprung up like a wild shrub, full of sap\r\nand strength, but uncultivated and solitary. Besides, from the time when\r\nhe was fifteen, one was accustomed to his motiveless absences, which the\r\nindifference that everyone bore him made moreover perfectly explicable;\r\nfrom time to time, however, he was seen to reappear at the castle, like\r\nthose migratory birds which always return to the same place but only\r\nstay a moment, then take their way again without one’s knowing towards\r\nwhat spot in the world they are directing their flight.\r\n\r\nAn instinct of misfortune in common had drawn Little Douglas to George.\r\nGeorge, seeing the child ill-treated by everyone, had conceived an\r\naffection for him, and Little Douglas, feeling himself loved amid the\r\natmosphere of indifference around him, turned with open arms and heart\r\nto George: it resulted from this mutual liking that one day, when the\r\nchild had committed I do not know what fault, and that William Douglas\r\nraised the whip he beat his dogs with to strike him, that George, who\r\nwas sitting on a stone, sad and thoughtful, had immediately sprung up,\r\nsnatched the whip from his brother’s hands and had thrown it far from\r\nhim. At this insult William had drawn his sword, and George his, so that\r\nthese two brothers, who had hated one another for twenty years like two\r\nenemies, were going to cut one another’s throats, when Little Douglas,\r\nwho had picked up the whip, coming back and kneeling before William,\r\noffered him the ignominious weapon, saying,\r\n\r\n\"Strike, cousin; I have deserved it.\"\r\n\r\nThis behaviour of the child had caused some minutes’ reflection to the\r\ntwo young men, who, terrified at the crime they were about to commit,\r\nhad returned their swords to their scabbards and had each gone away in\r\nsilence. Since this incident the friendship of George and Little Douglas\r\nhad acquired new strength, and on the child’s side it had become\r\nveneration.\r\n\r\nWe dwell upon all these details somewhat at length, perhaps, but no\r\ndoubt our readers will pardon us when they see the use to be made of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThis is the family, less George, who, as we have said, was absent at the\r\ntime of her arrival, into the midst of which the queen had fallen,\r\npassing in a moment from the summit of power to the position of a\r\nprisoner; for from the day following her arrival Mary saw that it was by\r\nsuch a title she was an inmate of Lochleven Castle. In fact, Lady\r\nDouglas presented herself before her as soon as it was morning, and with\r\nan embarrassment and dislike ill disguised beneath an appearance of\r\nrespectful indifference, invited Mary to follow her and take stock of\r\nthe several parts of the fortress which had been chosen beforehand for\r\nher private use. She then made her go through three rooms, of which one\r\nwas to serve as her bedroom, the second as sitting-room, and the third\r\nas ante-chamber; afterwards, leading the way down a spiral staircase,\r\nwhich looked into the great hall of the castle, its only outlet, she had\r\ncrossed this hall, and had taken Mary into the garden whose trees the\r\nqueen had seen topping the high walls on her arrival: it was a little\r\nsquare of ground, forming a flower-bed in the midst of which was an\r\nartificial fountain. It was entered by a very low door, repeated in the\r\nopposite wall; this second door looked on to the lake and, like all the\r\ncastle doors, whose keys, however, never left the belt or the pillow of\r\nWilliam Douglas, it was guarded night and day by a sentinel. This was\r\nnow the whole domain of her who had possessed the palaces, the plains,\r\nand the mountains of an entire kingdom.\r\n\r\nMary, on returning to her room, found breakfast ready, and William\r\nDouglas standing near the table he was going to fulfil about the queen\r\nthe duties of carver and taster.\r\n\r\nIn spite of their hatred for Mary, the Douglases would have considered\r\nit an eternal blemish on their honour if any accident should have\r\nbefallen the queen while she was dwelling in their castle; and it was in\r\norder that the queen herself should not entertain any fear in this\r\nrespect that William Douglas, in his quality of lord of the manor, had\r\nnot only desired to carve before the queen, but even to taste first in\r\nher presence, all the dishes served to her, as well as the water and the\r\nseveral wines to be brought her. This precaution saddened Mary more than\r\nit reassured her; for she understood that, while she stayed in the\r\ncastle, this ceremony would prevent any intimacy at table. However, it\r\nproceeded from too noble an intention for her to impute it as a crime to\r\nher hosts: she resigned herself, then, to this company, insupportable as\r\nit was to her; only, from that day forward, she so cut short her meals\r\nthat all the time she was at Lochleven her longest dinners barely lasted\r\nmore than a quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nTwo days after her arrival, Mary, on sitting down to table for\r\nbreakfast, found on her plate a letter addressed to her which had been\r\nput there by William Douglas. Mary recognised Murray’s handwriting, and\r\nher first feeling was one of joy; for if a ray of hope remained to her,\r\nit came from her brother, to whom she had always been perfectly kind,\r\nwhom from Prior of St. Andrew’s she had made an earl in bestowing on him\r\nthe splendid estates which formed part of the old earldom of Murray, and\r\nto whom, which was of more importance, she had since pardoned, or\r\npretended to pardon, the part he had taken in Rizzio’s assassination.\r\n\r\nHer astonishment was great, then, when, having opened the letter, she\r\nfound in it bitter reproaches for her conduct, an exhortation to do\r\npenance, and an assurance several times repeated that she should never\r\nleave her prison. He ended his letter in announcing to her that, in\r\nspite of his distaste for public affairs, he had been obliged to accept\r\nthe regency, which he had done less for his country than for his sister,\r\nseeing that it was the sole means he had of standing in the way of the\r\nignominious trial to which the nobles wished to bring her, as author, or\r\nat least as chief accomplice, of Darnley’s death. This imprisonment was\r\nthen clearly a great good fortune for her, and she ought to thank Heaven\r\nfor it, as an alleviation of the fate awaiting her if he had not\r\ninterceded for her.\r\n\r\nThis letter was a lightning stroke for Mary: only, as she did not wish\r\nto give her enemies the delight of seeing her suffer, she contained her\r\ngrief, and, turning to William Douglas—\r\n\r\n\"My lord,\" said she, \"this letter contains news that you doubtless know\r\nalready, for although we are not children by the same mother, he who\r\nwrites to me is related to us in the same degree, and will not have\r\ndesired to write to his sister without writing to his brother at the\r\nsame time; besides, as a good son, he will have desired to acquaint his\r\nmother with the unlooked-for greatness that has befallen him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied William, \"we know since yesterday that, for the\r\nwelfare of Scotland, my brother has been named regent; and as he is a\r\nson as respectful to his mother as he is devoted to his country, we hope\r\nthat he will repair the evil that for five years favourites of every\r\nsort and kind have done to both.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is like a good son, and at the same time like a courteous host, to\r\ngo back no farther into the history of Scotland,\" replied Mary Stuart,\r\n\"and not to make the daughter blush for the father’s errors; for I have\r\nheard say that the evil which your lordship laments was prior to the\r\ntime to which you assign it, and that King James V. also had formerly\r\nfavourites, both male and female. It is true that they add that the ones\r\nas ill rewarded his friendship as the others his love. In this, if you\r\nare ignorant of it, my lord, you can be instructed, if he is still\r\nliving, by a certain. Porterfeld or Porterfield, I don’t know which,\r\nunderstanding these names of the lower classes too ill to retain and\r\npronounce them, but about which, in my stead, your noble mother could\r\ngive you information.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, Mary Stuart rose, and, leaving William Douglas crimson\r\nwith rage, she returned into her bedroom, and bolted the door behind\r\nher.\r\n\r\nAll that day Mary did not come down, remaining at her window, from which\r\nshe at least enjoyed a splendid view over the plains and village of\r\nKinross; but this vast extent only contracted her heart the more, when,\r\nbringing her gaze back from the horizon to the castle, she beheld its\r\nwalls surrounded on all sides by the deep waters of the lake, on whose\r\nwide surface a single boat, where Little Douglas was fishing, was\r\nrocking like a speck. For some moments Mary’s eyes mechanically rested\r\non this child, whom she had already seen upon her arrival, when suddenly\r\na horn sounded from the Kinross side. At the same moment Little Douglas\r\nthrew away his line, and began to row towards the shore whence the\r\nsignal had come with skill and strength beyond his years. Mary, who had\r\nlet her gaze rest on him absently, continued to follow him with her\r\neyes, and saw him make for a spot on the shore so distant that the boat\r\nseemed to her at length but an imperceptible speck; but soon it\r\nreappeared, growing larger as it approached, and Mary could then observe\r\nthat it was bringing back to the castle a new passenger, who, having in\r\nhis turn taken the oars, made the little skiff fly over the tranquil\r\nwater of the lake, where it left a furrow gleaming in the last rays of\r\nthe sun. Very soon, flying on with the swiftness of a bird, it was near\r\nenough for Mary to see that the skilful and vigorous oarsman was a young\r\nman from twenty-five to twenty-six years of age, with long black hair,\r\nclad in a close coat of green cloth, and wearing a Highlander’s cap,\r\nadorned with an eagle’s feather; then, as with his back turned to the\r\nwindow he drew nearer, Little Douglas, who was leaning on his shoulder,\r\nsaid a few words which made him turn round towards the queen:\r\nimmediately Mary, with an instinctive movement rather than with the\r\ndread of being an object of idle curiosity, drew back, but not so\r\nquickly, however, but that she had been able to see the handsome pale\r\nface of the unknown, who, when she returned to the window, had\r\ndisappeared behind one of the corners of the castle.\r\n\r\nEverything is a cause of conjecture to a prisoner: it seemed to Mary\r\nthat this young man’s face was not unknown to her, and that he had seen\r\nher already; but though great the care with which she questioned her\r\nmemory, she could not recall any distinct remembrance, so much so that\r\nthe queen ended in thinking it the play of her imagination, or that some\r\nvague and distinct resemblance had deceived her.\r\n\r\nHowever, in spite of Mary, this idea had taken an important place in her\r\nmind: she incessantly saw this little boat skimming the water, and the\r\nyoung man and the child who were in it drawing near her, as if to bring\r\nher help. It followed that, although there had been nothing real in all\r\nthese captive’s dreams, she slept that night a calmer sleep than she had\r\nyet done since she had been in Lochleven Castle.\r\n\r\nNext day, on rising, Mary ran to her window: the weather was fine, and\r\neverything seemed to smile on her, the water, the heavens and the earth.\r\nBut, without being able to account for the restraining motive, she did\r\nnot want to go down into the garden before breakfast. When the door\r\nopened, ’she turned quickly round: it was, as on the day before, William\r\nDouglas, who came to fulfil his duty as taster.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast was a short and silent one; then, as soon as Douglas had\r\nwithdrawn, Mary descended in her turn: in crossing the courtyard she saw\r\ntwo horses ready saddled, which pointed to the near departure of a\r\nmaster and a squire. Was it the young man with the black hair already\r\nsetting out again? This is what Mary did not dare or did not wish to\r\nask. She consequently went her way, and entered the garden: at the first\r\nglance she took it in in its full extent; it was deserted.\r\n\r\nMary walked there a moment; then, soon tiring of the promenade, she went\r\nup again to her room: in passing back through the courtyard she had\r\nnoticed that the horses were no longer there. Directly she returned into\r\nher apartment, she went then to the window to see if she could discover\r\nanything upon the lake to guide her in her conjectures: a boat was in\r\nfact receding, and in this boat were the two horses and the two\r\nhorsemen; one was William Douglas, the other a simple squire from the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nMary continued watching the boat until it had touched the shore. Arrived\r\nthere, the two horsemen got out, disembarked their horses, and went away\r\nat full gallop, taking the same road by which the queen had come; so\r\nthat, as the horses were prepared for a long journey, Mary thought that\r\nWilliam Douglas was going to Edinburgh. As to the boat, scarcely had it\r\nlanded its two passengers on the opposite shore than it returned towards\r\nthe castle.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Mary Seyton announced to the queen that Lady Douglas was\r\nasking permission to visit her.\r\n\r\nIt was the second time, after long hatred on Lady Douglas’s part and\r\ncontemptuous indifference on the queen’s, that the two women were face\r\nto face; therefore the queen, with that instinctive impulse of coquetry\r\nwhich urges women, in whatever situation they find themselves, to desire\r\nto be beautiful, above all for women, made a sign to Mary Seyton, and,\r\ngoing to a little mirror fastened to the wall in a heavy Gothic frame,\r\nshe arranged her curls, and readjusted the lace of her collar; then;\r\nhaving seated herself in the pose most favourable to her, in a great\r\narm-chair, the only one in her sitting-room, she said smilingly to Mary\r\nSeyton that she might admit Lady Douglas, who was immediately\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\nMary’s expectation was not disappointed: Lady Douglas, in spite of her\r\nhatred for James Vs daughter, and mistress of herself as she thought she\r\nwas, could not prevent herself from showing by a movement of surprise the\r\nimpression that this marvelous beauty was making on her: she thought she\r\nshould find Mary crushed by her unhappiness, pallid from her fatigues,\r\nhumbled by captivity, and she saw her calm, lovely, and haughty as\r\nusual. Mary perceived the effect that she was producing, and addressing\r\nherself with an ironical smile partly to Mary Seyton, who was leaning on\r\nthe back of her chair, and partly to her who was paying her this\r\nunforeseen visit.\r\n\r\n\"We are fortunate to-day,\" said she, \"for we are going as it seems to\r\nenjoy the society of our good hostess, whom we thank besides for having\r\nkindly maintained with us the empty ceremony of announcing herself—a\r\nceremony with which, having the keys of our apartment, she could have\r\ndispensed.\"\r\n\r\n\"If my presence is inconvenient to your grace,\" replied Lady Lochleven,\r\n\"I am all the more sorry for it, as circumstances will oblige me to\r\nimpose it twice daily, at least during the absence of my son, who is\r\nsummoned to Edinburgh by the regent; this is of what I came to inform\r\nyour grace, not with the empty ceremonial of the court, but with the\r\nconsideration which Lady Lochleven owes to everyone who has received\r\nhospitality in her castle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our good hostess mistakes our intention,\" Mary answered, with affected\r\ngood-nature; \"and the regent himself can bear witness to the pleasure we\r\nhave always had in bringing nearer to us the persons who can recall to\r\nus, even indirectly, our well-beloved father, James V. It will be\r\ntherefore unjustly that Lady Douglas will interpret in a manner\r\ndisagreeable to herself our surprise at seeing her; and the hospitality\r\nthat she offers us so obligingly does not promise us, in spite of her\r\ngoodwill, sufficient distractions that we should deprive ourselves of\r\nthose that her visits cannot fail to procure us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunately, madam,\" replied Lady Lochleven, whom Mary was keeping\r\nstanding before her, \"whatever pleasure I myself derive from these\r\nvisits, I shall be obliged to deprive myself of, except at the times I\r\nhave mentioned. I am now too old to bear fatigue, and I have, always\r\nbeen too proud to endure sarcasms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, Seyton,\" cried Mary, seeming to recollect herself, \"we had not\r\ndreamed that Lady Lochleven, having won her right to a stool at the\r\ncourt of the king my father, would have need to preserve it in the\r\nprison of the queen his daughter. Bring forward a seat, Seyton, that we\r\nbe not deprived so soon, and by a failure of memory on our part, of our\r\ngracious hostess’s company; or even,\" went on Mary, rising and pointing\r\nout her own seat to Lady Lochleven, who was making a motion to withdraw,\r\n\"if a stool does not suit you, my lady, take this easy-chair: you will\r\nnot be the first member of your family to sit in my place.\"\r\n\r\nAt this last allusion, which recalled to her Murray’s usurpation, Lady\r\nLochleven was no doubt about to make some exceedingly bitter reply, when\r\nthe young man with the dark hair appeared on the threshold, without\r\nbeing announced, and, advancing towards Lady Lochleven, without saluting\r\nMary—\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" said he, bowing to the former, \"the boat which took my brother\r\nhas just returned, and one of the men in it is charged with a pressing\r\ncharge that Lord William forgot to make to you himself.\"\r\n\r\nThen, saluting the old lady with the same respect, he immediately went\r\nout of the room, without even glancing at the queen, who, hurt by this\r\nimpertinence, turned round to Mary Seyton, and, with her usual calm—\r\n\r\n\"What have they told us, Seyton, of injurious rumours which were spread\r\nabout our worthy hostess apropos of a child with a pale face and dark\r\nhair? If this child, as I have every reason to believe, has become the\r\nyoung man who just went out of the room, I am ready to affirm to all the\r\nincredulous that he is a true Douglas, if not for courage, of which we\r\ncannot judge, then for insolence, of which he has just given us proofs.\r\nLet us return, darling,\" continued the queen, leaning on Mary Seyton’s\r\narm; \"for our good hostess, out of courtesy, might think herself obliged\r\nto keep us company longer, while we know that she is impatiently awaited\r\nelsewhere.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, Mary went into her bedroom; while the old lady, still\r\nquite stunned with the shower of sarcasms that the queen had rained on\r\nher, withdrew, murmuring, \"Yes, yes, he is a Douglas, and with God’s\r\nhelp he will prove it, I hope.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen had had strength as long as she was sustained by her enemy’s\r\npresence, but scarcely was she alone than she sank into a chair, and no\r\nlonger having any witness of her weakness than Mary Seyton, burst into\r\ntears. Indeed, she had just been cruelly wounded: till then no man had\r\ncome near her who had not paid homage either to the majesty of her rank\r\nor to the beauty of her countenance. But precisely he, on whom she had\r\nreckoned, without knowing why, with instinctive hopes, insulted her at\r\none and the same time in her double pride of queen and woman: thus she\r\nremained shut up till evening.\r\n\r\nAt dinner-time, just as Lady Lochleven had informed Mary, she ascended\r\nto the queen’s apartment, in her dress of honour, and preceding four\r\nservants who were carrying the several dishes composing the prisoner’s\r\nrepast, and who, in their turn, were followed by the old castle steward,\r\nhaving, as on days of great ceremony, his gold chain round his neck and\r\nhis ivory stick in his hand. The servants’ placed the dishes on the\r\ntable, and waited in silence for the moment when it should please the\r\nqueen to come out of her room; but at this moment the door opened, and\r\nin place of the queen Mary Seyton appeared.\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" said she on entering, \"her grace was indisposed during the day,\r\nand will take nothing this evening; it will be useless, then, for you to\r\nwait longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Permit me to hope,\" replied Lady Lochleven, \"that she will change her\r\ndecision; in any case, see me perform my office.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words, a servant handed Lady Lochleven bread and salt on a\r\nsilver salver, while the old steward, who, in the absence of William\r\nDouglas, fulfilled the duties of carver, served to her on a plate of the\r\nsame metal a morsel from each of the dishes that had been brought; then,\r\nthis transaction ended.\r\n\r\n\"So the queen will not appear to-day?\" Lady Lochleven inquired.\r\n\r\n\"It is her Majesty’s resolve,\" replied Mary Seyton.\r\n\r\n\"Our presence is then needless,\" said the old lady; \"but in any case the\r\ntable is served, and if her grace should have need of anything else, she\r\nwould have but to name it.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, Lady Lochleven, with the same stiffness and the same\r\ndignity with which she had come, withdrew, followed by her four servants\r\nand her steward.\r\n\r\nAs Lady Lochleven had foreseen, the queen, yielding to the entreaties of\r\nMary Seyton, came out of her room at last, towards eight o’clock in the\r\nevening, sat down to table, and, served by the only maid of honour left\r\nher, ate a little; then, getting up, she went to the window.\r\n\r\nIt was one of those magnificent summer evenings on which the whole of\r\nnature seems making holiday: the sky was studded with stars, which were\r\nreflected in the lake, and in their midst, like a more fiery star, the\r\nflame of the chafing-dish shone, burning at the stern of a little boat:\r\nthe queen, by the gleam of the light it shed, perceived George Douglas\r\nand Little Douglas, who were fishing. However great her wish to profit\r\nby this fine evening to breathe the pure night air, the sight of this\r\nyoung man who had so grossly insulted her this very day made such a keen\r\nimpression on her that she shut her window directly, and, retiring into\r\nher room, went to bed, and made her companion in captivity read several\r\nprayers aloud; then, not being able to sleep, so greatly was she\r\nagitated, she rose, and throwing on a mantle went again to the window\r\nthe boat had disappeared.\r\n\r\nMary spent part of the night gazing into the immensity of the heavens,\r\nor into the depths of the lake; but in spite of the nature of the\r\nthoughts agitating her, she none the less found very great physical\r\nalleviation in contact with this pure air and in contemplation of this\r\npeaceful and silent night: thus she awoke next day calmer and more\r\nresigned. Unfortunately, the sight of Lady Lochleven, who presented\r\nherself at breakfast-time, to fulfil her duties as taster, brought back\r\nher irritability. Perhaps, however, things would have gone on smoothly\r\nif Lady Lochleven, instead of remaining standing by the sideboard, had\r\nwithdrawn after having tasted the various dishes of the courses; but\r\nthis insisting on remaining throughout the meal, which was at bottom a\r\nmark of respect, seemed to the queen unbearable tyranny.\r\n\r\n\"Darling,\" said she, speaking to Mary Seyton, \"have you already\r\nforgotten that our good hostess complained yesterday of the fatigue she\r\nfelt in standing? Bring her, then, one of the two stools which compose\r\nour royal furniture, and take care that it is not the one with the leg\r\nbroken\". \"If the furniture of Lochleven Castle is in such bad condition,\r\nmadam,\" the old lady replied, \"it is the fault of the kings of Scotland:\r\nthe poor Douglases for nearly a century have had such a small part of\r\ntheir sovereigns’ favour, that they have not been able to keep up the\r\nsplendour of their ancestors to the level of that of private\r\nindividuals, and because there was in Scotland a certain musician, as I\r\nam informed, who spent their income for a whole year in one month.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those who know how to take so well, my lady,\" the queen answered, \"have\r\nno need of being given to: it seems to me the Douglases have lost\r\nnothing by waiting, and there is not a younger son of this noble family\r\nwho might not aspire to the highest alliances; it is truly vexatious\r\nthat our sister the queen of England has taken a vow of virginity; as is\r\nstated.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or rather,\" interrupted Lady Lochleven, \"that the Queen of Scotland is\r\nnot a widow by her third husband. But,\" continued the old lady,\r\npretending to recollect herself, \"I do not say that to reproach your\r\ngrace. Catholics look upon marriage as a sacrament, and on this head\r\nreceive it as often as they can.\"\r\n\r\n\"This, then,\" returned Mary, \"is the difference between them and the\r\nHuguenots; for they, not having the same respect for it, think it is\r\nallowed them to dispense with it in certain circumstances.\"\r\n\r\nAt this terrible sarcasm Lady Lochleven took a step towards Mary Stuart,\r\nholding in her hand the knife which she had just been using to cut off a\r\npiece of meat brought her to taste; but the queen rose up with so great\r\na calm and with such majesty, that either from involuntary respect or\r\nshame of her first impulse, she let fall the weapon she was holding, and\r\nnot finding anything sufficiently strong in reply to express her\r\nfeelings, she signed to the servants to follow her, and went out of the\r\napartment with all the dignity that anger permitted her to summon to her\r\naid.\r\n\r\nScarcely had Lady Lochleven left the room than the queen sat down again,\r\njoyful and triumphant at the victory she had just gained, and ate with a\r\nbetter appetite than she had yet done since she was a prisoner, while\r\nMary Seyton deplored in a low tone and with all possible respect this\r\nfatal gift of repartee that Mary had received, and which, with her\r\nbeauty, was one of the causes of all her misfortunes; but the queen did\r\nnothing but laugh at all her observations, saying she was curious to see\r\nthe figure her good hostess would cut at dinnertime.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, the queen went down into the garden: her satisfied\r\npride had restored some of her cheerfulness, so much so that, seeing,\r\nwhile crossing the hall, a mandolin lying forgotten on a chair, she told\r\nMary Seyton to take it, to see, she said, if she could recall her old\r\ntalent. In reality the queen was one of the best musicians of the time,\r\nand played admirably, says Brantome, on the lute and viol d’amour, an\r\ninstrument much resembling the mandolin.\r\n\r\nMary Seyton obeyed.\r\n\r\nArrived in the garden, the queen sat down in the deepest shade, and\r\nthere, having tuned her instrument, she at first drew from it lively and\r\nlight tones, which soon darkened little by little, at the same time that\r\nher countenance assumed a hue of deep melancholy. Mary Seyton looked at\r\nher with uneasiness, although for a long time she had been used to these\r\nsudden changes in her mistress’s humour, and she was about to ask the\r\nreason of this gloomy veil suddenly spread over her face, when,\r\nregulating her harmonies, Mary began to sing in a low voice, and as if\r\nfor herself alone, the following verses:\r\n\r\n    \"Caverns, meadows, plains and mounts,\r\n     Lands of tree and stone,\r\n     Rivers, rivulets and founts,\r\n     By which I stray alone,\r\n     Bewailing as I go,\r\n     With tears that overflow,\r\n     Sing will I\r\n     The miserable woe\r\n     That bids me grieve and sigh.\r\n\r\n     Ay, but what is here to lend\r\n     Ear to my lament?\r\n     What is here can comprehend\r\n     My dull discontent?\r\n     Neither grass nor reed,\r\n     Nor the ripples heed,\r\n     Flowing by,\r\n     While the stream with speed\r\n     Hastens from my eye.\r\n\r\n     Vainly does my wounded heart\r\n     Hope, alas, to heal;\r\n     Seeking, to allay its smart,\r\n     Things that cannot feel.\r\n     Better should my pain\r\n     Bitterly complain,\r\n     Crying shrill,\r\n     To thee who dost constrain\r\n     My spirit to such ill.\r\n\r\n     Goddess, who shalt never die,\r\n     List to what I say;\r\n     Thou who makest me to lie\r\n     Weak beneath thy sway,\r\n     If my life must know\r\n     Ending at thy blow,\r\n     Cruellest!\r\n     Own it perished so\r\n     But at thy behest.\r\n\r\n     Lo! my face may all men see\r\n     Slowly pine and fade,\r\n     E'en as ice doth melt and flee\r\n     Near a furnace laid.\r\n     Yet the burning ray\r\n     Wasting me away\r\n     Passion's glow,\r\n     Wakens no display\r\n     Of pity for my woe.\r\n\r\n     Yet does every neighbour tree,\r\n     Every rocky wall,\r\n     This my sorrow know and see;\r\n     So, in brief, doth all\r\n     Nature know aright\r\n     This my sorry plight;\r\n     Thou alone\r\n     Takest thy delight\r\n     To hear me cry and moan.\r\n\r\n     But if it be thy will,\r\n     To see tormented still\r\n     Wretched me,\r\n     Then let my woful ill\r\n     Immortal be.\"\r\n\r\nThis last verse died away as if the queen were exhausted, and at the\r\nsame time the mandolin slipped from her hands, and would have fallen to\r\nthe ground had not Mary Seyton thrown herself on her knees and prevented\r\nit. The young girl remained thus at her mistress’s feet for some time,\r\ngazing at her silently, and as she saw that she was losing herself more\r\nand more in gloomy reverie—\r\n\r\n\"Have those lines brought back to your Majesty some sad remembrance?\"\r\nshe asked hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" answered the queen; \"they reminded me of the unfortunate\r\nbeing who composed them.\"\r\n\r\n\"And may I, without indiscretion, inquire of your grace who is their\r\nauthor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! he was a noble, brave, and handsome young man, with a faithful\r\nheart and a hot head, who would defend me to-day, if I had defended him\r\nthen; but his boldness seemed to me rashness, and his fault a crime.\r\nWhat was to be done? I did not love him. Poor Chatelard! I was very\r\ncruel to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you did not prosecute him, it was your brother; you did not condemn\r\nhim, the judges did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes; I know that he too was Murray’s victim, and that is no doubt\r\nthe reason that I am calling him to mind just now. But I was able to\r\npardon him, Mary, and I was inflexible; I let ascend the scaffold a man\r\nwhose only crime was in loving me too well; and now I am astonished and\r\ncomplain of being abandoned by everyone. Listen, darling, there is one\r\nthing that terrifies me: it is, that when I search within myself I find\r\nthat I have not only deserved my fate, but even that God did not punish\r\nme severely enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"What strange thoughts for your grace!\" cried Mary; \"and see where those\r\nunlucky lines which returned to your mind have led you, the very day\r\nwhen you were beginning to recover a little of your cheerfulness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" replied the queen, shaking her head and uttering a deep sigh,\r\n\"for six years very few days have passed that I have not repeated those\r\nlines to myself, although it may be for the first time to-day that I\r\nrepeat them aloud. He was a Frenchman too, Mary: they have exiled from\r\nme, taken or killed all who came to me from France. Do you remember that\r\nvessel which was swallowed up before our eyes when we came out of Calais\r\nharbour? I exclaimed then that it was a sad omen: you all wanted to\r\nreassure me. Well, who was right, now, you or I?\"\r\n\r\nThe queen was in one of those fits of sadness for which tears are the\r\nsole remedy; so Mary Seyton, perceiving that not only would every\r\nconsolation be vain, but also unreasonable, far from continuing to react\r\nagainst her mistress’s melancholy, fully agreed with her: it followed\r\nthat the queen, who was suffocating, began to weep, and that her tears\r\nbrought her comfort; then little by little she regained self-control,\r\nand this crisis passed as usual, leaving her firmer and more resolute\r\nthan ever, so that when she went up to her room again it was impossible\r\nto read the slightest alteration in her countenance.\r\n\r\nThe dinner-hour was approaching, and Mary, who in the morning was\r\nlooking forward impatiently to the enjoyment of her triumph over Lady\r\nLochleven, now saw her advance with uneasiness: the mere idea of again\r\nfacing this woman, whose pride one was always obliged to oppose with\r\ninsolence, was, after the moral fatigues of the day, a fresh weariness.\r\nSo she decided not to appear for dinner, as on the day before: she was\r\nall the more glad she had taken this resolution, that this time it was\r\nnot Lady Lochleven who came to fulfil the duties enjoined on a member of\r\nthe family to make the queen easy, but George Douglas, whom his mother\r\nin her displeasure at the morning scene sent to replace her. Thus, when\r\nMary Seyton told the queen that she saw the young man with dark hair\r\ncross the courtyard on his way to her, Mary still further congratulated\r\nherself on her decision; for this young man’s insolence had wounded her\r\nmore deeply than all his mother’s haughty insults. The queen was not a\r\nlittle astonished, then, when in a few minutes Mary Seyton returned and\r\ninformed her that George Douglas, having sent away the servants, desired\r\nthe honour of speaking to her on a matter of importance. At first the\r\nqueen refused; but Mary Seyton told her that the young man’s air and\r\nmanner this time were so different from what she had seen two days\r\nbefore, that she thought her mistress would be wrong to refuse his\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\nThe queen rose then, and with the pride and majesty habitual to her,\r\nentered the adjoining room, and, having taken three steps, stopped with\r\na disdainful air, waiting for George to address her.\r\n\r\nMary Seyton had spoken truly: George Douglas was now another man. To-day\r\nhe seemed to be as respectful and timid as the preceding day he had\r\nseemed haughty and proud. He, in his turn, made a step towards the\r\nqueen; but seeing Mary Seyton standing behind her—\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" said he, \"I wished to speak with your Majesty alone: shall I\r\nnot obtain this favour?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mary Seyton is not a stranger to me, Sir: she is my sister, my friend;\r\nshe is more than all that, she is my companion in captivity.\"\r\n\r\n\"And by all these claims, madam, I have the utmost veneration for her;\r\nbut what I have to tell you cannot be heard by other ears than yours.\r\nThus, madam, as the opportunity furnished now may perhaps never present\r\nitself again, in the name of what is dearest to you, grant me what I\r\nask.\"\r\n\r\nThere was such a tone of respectful prayer in George’s voice that Mary\r\nturned to the young girl, and, making her a friendly sign with her hand—\r\n\r\n\"Go, then, darling,\" said she; \"but be easy, you will lose nothing by\r\nnot hearing. Go.\"\r\n\r\nMary Seyton withdrew; the queen smilingly looked after her, till the\r\ndoor was shut; then, turning to George—\r\n\r\n\"Now, sir,\" said she, \"we are alone, speak.\"\r\n\r\nBut George, instead of replying, advanced to the queen, and, kneeling on\r\none knee, drew from his breast a paper which he presented to her. Mary\r\ntook it with amazement, unfolded it, glancing at Douglas, who remained\r\nin the same posture, and read as follows:\r\n\r\nWe, earls, lords, and barons, in consideration that our queen is\r\ndetained at Lochleven, and that her faithful subjects cannot have access\r\nto her person; seeing, on the other hand, that our duty pledges us to\r\nprovide for her safety, promise and swear to employ all reasonable means\r\nwhich will depend on us to set her at liberty again on conditions\r\ncompatible with the honour of her Majesty, the welfare of the kingdom,\r\nand even with the safety of those who keep her in prison, provided that\r\nthey consent to give her up; that if they refuse, we declare that we are\r\nprepared to make use of ourselves, our children, our friends, our\r\nservants, our vassals, our goods, our persons, and our lives, to restore\r\nher to liberty, to procure the safety of the prince, and to co-operate\r\nin punishing the late king’s murderers. If we are assailed for this\r\nintent, whether as a body or in private, we promise to defend ourselves,\r\nand to aid one another, under pain of infamy and perjury. So may God\r\nhelp us.\r\n\r\n\"Given with our own hands at Dumbarton,\r\n\r\n\"St. Andrews, Argyll, Huntly, Arbroath, Galloway, Ross, Fleming,\r\nHerries, Stirling, Kilwinning, Hamilton, and Saint-Clair, Knight.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Seyton!\" cried Mary, \"among all these signatures, I do not see that\r\nof my faithful Seyton.\"\r\n\r\nDouglas, still kneeling, drew from his breast a second paper, and\r\npresented it to the queen with the same marks of respect. It contained\r\nonly these few words:\r\n\r\n\"Trust George Douglas; for your Majesty has no more devoted friend in\r\nthe entire kingdom. \"SEYTON.\"\r\n\r\nMary lowered her eyes to Douglas with an expression which was hers only;\r\nthen, giving him her hand to raise him—\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said she, with a sigh more of joy than of sadness, \"now I see that\r\nGod, in spite of my faults, has not yet abandoned me. But how is it, in\r\nthis castle, that you, a Douglas.... oh! it is incredible!\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" replied George, \"seven years have passed since I saw you in\r\nFrance for the first time, and for seven years I have loved you\". Mary\r\nmoved; but Douglas put forth his hand and shook his head with an air of\r\nsuch profound sadness, that she understood that she might hear what the\r\nyoung man had to say. He continued: \"Reassure yourself, madam; I should\r\nnever have made this confession if, while explaining my conduct to you,\r\nthis confession would not have given you greater confidence in me. Yes,\r\nfor seven years I have loved you, but as one loves a star that one can\r\nnever reach, a madonna to whom one can only pray; for seven years I have\r\nfollowed you everywhere without you ever having paid attention to me,\r\nwithout my saying a word or making a gesture to attract your notice. I\r\nwas on the knight of Mevillon’s galley when you crossed to Scotland; I\r\nwas among the regent’s soldiers when you beat Huntly; I was in the\r\nescort which accompanied you when you went to see the sick king at\r\nGlasgow; I reached Edinburgh an hour after you had left it for\r\nLochleven; and then it seemed to me that my mission was revealed to me\r\nfor the first time, and that this love for which till then, I had\r\nreproached myself as a crime, was on the contrary a favour from God. I\r\nlearned that the lords were assembled at Dumbarton: I flew thither. I\r\npledged my name, I pledged my honour, I pledged my life; and I obtained\r\nfrom them, thanks to the facility I had for coming into this fortress,\r\nthe happiness of bringing you the paper they have just signed. Now,\r\nmadam, forget all I have told you, except the assurance of my devotion\r\nand respect: forget that I am near you; I am used to not being seen:\r\nonly, if you have need of my life, make a sign; for seven years my life\r\nhas been yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" replied Mary, \"I was complaining this morning of no longer being\r\nloved, and I ought to complain, on the contrary, that I am still loved;\r\nfor the love that I inspire is fatal and mortal. Look back, Douglas, and\r\ncount the tombs that, young as I am, I have already left on my\r\npath—Francis II, Chatelard, Rizzio, Darnley.... Oh to attach one’s self\r\nto my fortunes more than love is needed now heroism and devotion are\r\nrequisite so much the more that, as you have said, Douglas, it is love\r\nwithout any possible reward. Do you understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, madam, madam,\" answered Douglas, \"is it not reward beyond my\r\ndeserts to see you daily, to cherish the hope that liberty will be\r\nrestored to you through me, and to have at least, if I do not give it\r\nyou, the certainty of dying in your sight?\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor young man!\" murmured Mary, her eyes raised to heaven, as if she\r\nwere reading there beforehand the fate awaiting her new defender.\r\n\r\n\"Happy Douglas, on the contrary,\" cried George, seizing the queen’s hand\r\nand kissing it with perhaps still more respect than love, \"happy\r\nDouglas! for in obtaining a sigh from your Majesty he has already\r\nobtained more than he hoped.\"\r\n\r\n\"And upon what have you decided with my friends?\" said the queen,\r\nraising Douglas, who till then had remained on his knees before her.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing yet,\" George replied; \"for we scarcely had time to see one\r\nanother. Your escape, impossible without me, is difficult even with me;\r\nand your Majesty has seen that I was obliged publicly to fail in\r\nrespect, to obtain from my mother the confidence which gives me the good\r\nfortune of seeing you to-day: if this confidence on my mother’s or my\r\nbrother’s part ever extends to giving up to me the castle keys, then you\r\nare saved! Let your Majesty not be surprised at anything, then: in the\r\npresence of others, I shall ever be always a Douglas, that is an enemy;\r\nand except your life be in danger, madam, I shall not utter a word, I\r\nshall not make a gesture which might betray the faith that I have sworn\r\nyou; but, on your side, let your grace know well, that present or\r\nabsent, whether I am silent or speak, whether I act or remain inert, all\r\nwill be in appearance only, save my devotion. Only,\" continued Douglas,\r\napproaching the window and showing to the queen a little house on\r\nKinross hill,—\"only, look every evening in that direction, madam, and so\r\nlong as you see a light shine there, your friends will be keeping watch\r\nfor you, and you need not lose hope.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, Douglas, thanks,\" said the queen; \"it does one good to meet\r\nwith a heart like yours from time to time—oh! thanks.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now, madam,\" replied the young man, \"I must leave your Majesty; to\r\nremain longer with you would be to raise suspicions, and a single doubt\r\nof me, think of it well, madam, and that light which is your sole beacon\r\nis extinguished, and all returns into night.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, Douglas bowed more respectfully than he had yet done,\r\nand withdrew, leaving Mary full of hope, and still more full of pride;\r\nfor this time the homage that she had just received was certainly for\r\nthe woman and not for the queen.\r\n\r\nAs the queen had told him, Mary Seyton was informed of everything, even\r\nthe love of Douglas, and, the two women impatiently awaited the evening\r\nto see if the promised star would shine on the horizon. Their hope was\r\nnot in vain: at the appointed time the beacon was lit. The queen\r\ntrembled with joy, for it was the confirmation of her hopes, and her\r\ncompanion could not tear her from the window, where she remained with\r\nher gaze fastened on the little house in Kinross. At last she yielded to\r\nMary Seyton’s prayers, and consented to go to bed; but twice in the\r\nnight she rose noiselessly to go to the window: the light was always\r\nshining, and was not extinguished till dawn, with its sisters the stars.\r\n\r\nNext day, at breakfast, George announced to the queen the return of his\r\nbrother, William Douglas: he arrived the same evening; as to himself,\r\nGeorge, he had to leave Lochleven next morning, to confer with the\r\nnobles who had signed the declaration, and who had immediately separated\r\nto raise troops in their several counties. The queen could not attempt\r\nto good purpose any escape but at a time when she would be sure of\r\ngathering round her an army strong enough to hold the country; as to\r\nhim, Douglas, one was so used to his silent disappearances and to his\r\nunexpected returns, that there was no reason to fear that his departure\r\nwould inspire any suspicion.\r\n\r\nAll passed as George had said: in the evening the sound of a bugle\r\nannounced the arrival of William Douglas; he had with him Lord Ruthven,\r\nthe son of him who had assassinated Rizzio, and who, exiled with Morton\r\nafter the murder, died in England of the sickness with which he was\r\nalready attacked the day of the terrible catastrophe in which we have\r\nseen him take such a large share. He preceded by one day Lord Lindsay of\r\nByres and Sir Robert Melville, brother of Mary’s former ambassador to\r\nElizabeth: all three were charged with a mission from the regent to the\r\nqueen.\r\n\r\nOn the following day everything fell back into the usual routine, and\r\nWilliam Douglas reassumed his duties as carver. Breakfast passed without\r\nMary’s having learned anything of George’s departure or Ruthven’s\r\narrival. On rising from the table she went to her window: scarcely was\r\nshe there than she heard the sound of a horn echoing on the shores of\r\nthe lake, and saw a little troop of horsemen halt, while waiting for the\r\nboat to came and take those who were going to the castle.\r\n\r\nThe distance was too great for Mary to recognise any of the visitors;\r\nbut it was clear, from the signs of intelligence exchanged between the\r\nlittle troop and the inhabitants of the fortress, that the newcomers\r\nwere her enemies. This was a reason why the queen, in her uneasiness,\r\nshould not lose sight for a moment of the boat which was going to fetch\r\nthem. She saw only two men get into it; and immediately it put off again\r\nfor the castle.\r\n\r\nAs the boat drew nearer, Mary’s presentiments changed to real fears, for\r\nin one of the men coming towards her she thought she made out Lord\r\nLindsay of Byres, the same who, a week before, had brought her to her\r\nprison. It was indeed he himself, as usual in a steel helmet without a\r\nvisor, which allowed one to see his coarse face designed to express\r\nstrong passions, and his long black beard with grey hairs here and\r\nthere, which covered his chest: his person was protected, as if it were\r\nin time of war, with his faithful suit of armour, formerly polished and\r\nwell gilded, but which, exposed without ceasing to rain and mist, was\r\nnow eaten up with rust; he had slung on his back, much as one slings a\r\nquiver, a broadsword, so heavy that it took two hands to manage it, and\r\nso long that while the hilt reached the left shoulder the point reached\r\nthe right spur: in a word, he was still the same soldier, brave to\r\nrashness but brutal to insolence, recognising nothing but right and\r\nforce, and always ready to use force when he believed himself in the\r\nright.\r\n\r\nThe queen was so much taken up with the sight of Lord Lindsay of Byres,\r\nthat it was only just as the boat reached the shore that she glanced at\r\nhis companion and recognised Robert Melville: this was some consolation,\r\nfor, whatever might happen, she knew that she should find in him if not\r\nostensible at least secret sympathy. Besides, his dress, by which one\r\ncould have judged him equally with Lord Lindsay, was a perfect contrast\r\nto his companion’s. It consisted of a black velvet doublet, with a cap\r\nand a feather of the same hue fastened to it with a gold clasp; his only\r\nweapon, offensive or defensive, was a little sword, which he seemed to\r\nwear rather as a sign of his rank than for attack or defence. As to his\r\nfeatures and his manners, they were in harmony with this peaceful\r\nappearance: his pale countenance expressed both acuteness and\r\nintelligence; his quick eye was mild, and his voice insinuating; his\r\nfigure slight and a little bent by habit rather than by years, since he\r\nwas but forty-five at this time, indicated an easy and conciliatory\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nHowever, the presence of this man of peace, who seemed entrusted with\r\nwatching over the demon of war, could not reassure the queen, and as to\r\nget to the landing-place, in front of the great door of the castle, the\r\nboat had just disappeared behind the corner of a tower, she told Mary\r\nSeyton to go down that she might try to learn what cause brought Lord\r\nLindsay to Lochleven, well knowing that with the force of character with\r\nwhich she was endowed, she need know this cause but a few minutes\r\nbeforehand, whatever it might be, to give her countenance that calm and\r\nthat majesty which she had always found to influence her enemies.\r\n\r\nLeft alone, Mary let her glance stray back to the little house in\r\nKinross, her sole hope; but the distance was too great to distinguish\r\nanything; besides, its shutters remained closed all day, and seemed to\r\nopen only in the evening, like the clouds, which, having covered the sky\r\nfor a whole morning, scatter at last to reveal to the lost sailor a\r\nsolitary star. She had remained no less motionless, her gaze always\r\nfixed on the same object, when she was drawn from this mute\r\ncontemplation by the step of Mary Seyton.\r\n\r\n\"Well, darling?\" asked the queen, turning round.\r\n\r\n\"Your Majesty is not mistaken,\" replied the messenger: \"it really was\r\nSir Robert Melville and Lord Lindsay; but there came yesterday with Sir\r\nWilliam Douglas a third ambassador, whose name, I am afraid, will be\r\nstill more odious to your Majesty than either of the two I have just\r\npronounced.\"\r\n\r\n\"You deceive yourself, Mary,\" the queen answered: \"neither the name of\r\nMelville nor that of Lindsay is odious to me. Melville’s, on the\r\ncontrary, is, in my present circumstances, one of those which I have\r\nmost pleasure in hearing; as to Lord Lindsay’s, it is doubtless not\r\nagreeable to me, but it is none the less an honourable name, always\r\nborne by men rough and wild, it is true, but incapable of treachery.\r\nTell me, then, what is this name, Mary; for you see I am calm and\r\nprepared.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! madam,\" returned Mary, \"calm and prepared as you may be, collect\r\nall your strength, not merely to hear this name uttered, but also to\r\nreceive in a few minutes the man who bears it; for this name is that of\r\nLord Ruthven.\"\r\n\r\nMary Seyton had spoken truly, and this name had a terrible influence\r\nupon the queen; for scarcely had it escaped the young girl’s lips than\r\nMary Stuart uttered a cry, and turning pale, as if she were about to\r\nfaint, caught hold of the window-ledge.\r\n\r\nMary Seyton, frightened at the effect produced by this fatal name,\r\nimmediately sprang to support the queen; but she, stretching one hand\r\ntowards her, while she laid the other on her heart—\r\n\r\n\"It is nothing,\" said she; \"I shall be better in a moment. Yes, Mary,\r\nyes, as you said, it is a fatal name and mingled with one of my most\r\nbloody memories. What such men are coming to ask of me must be dreadful\r\nindeed. But no matter, I shall soon be ready to receive my brother’s\r\nambassadors, for doubtless they are sent in his name. You, darling,\r\nprevent their entering, for I must have some minutes to myself: you know\r\nme; it will not take me long.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words the queen withdrew with a firm step to her bedchamber.\r\n\r\nMary Seyton was left alone, admiring that strength of character which\r\nmade of Mary Stuart, in all other respects so completely woman-like, a\r\nman in the hour of danger. She immediately went to the door to close it\r\nwith the wooden bar that one passed between two iron rings, but the bar\r\nhad been taken away, so that there was no means of fastening the door\r\nfrom within. In a moment she heard someone coming up the stairs, and\r\nguessing from the heavy, echoing step that this must be Lord Lindsay,\r\nshe looked round her once again to see if she could find something to\r\nreplace the bar, and finding nothing within reach, she passed her arm\r\nthrough the rings, resolved to let it be broken rather than allow anyone\r\nto approach her mistress before it suited her. Indeed, hardly had those\r\nwho were coming up reached the landing than someone knocked violently,\r\nand a harsh voice cried:\r\n\r\n\"Come, come, open the door; open directly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And by what right,\" said Mary Seyton, \"am I ordered thus insolently to\r\nopen the Queen of Scotland’s door?\"\r\n\r\n\"By the right of the ambassador of the regent to enter everywhere in his\r\nname. I am Lord Lindsay, and I am come to speak to Lady Mary Stuart.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be an ambassador,\" answered Mary Seyton, \"is not to be exempted from\r\nhaving oneself announced in visiting a woman, and much more a queen; and\r\nif this ambassador is, as he says, Lord Lindsay, he will await his\r\nsovereign’s leisure, as every Scottish noble would do in his place.\"\r\n\r\n\"By St. Andrew!\" cried Lord Lindsay, \"open, or I will break in the\r\ndoor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do nothing to it, my lord, I entreat you,\" said another voice, which\r\nMary recognised as Meville’s. \"Let us rather wait for Lord Ruthven, who\r\nis not yet ready.\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon my soul,\" cried Lindsay, shaking the door, \"I shall not wait a\r\nsecond\". Then, seeing that it resisted, \"Why did you tell me, then, you\r\nscamp,\" Lindsay went on, speaking to the steward, \"that the bar had been\r\nremoved?\r\n\r\n\"It is true,\" replied he.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" returned Lindsay, \"with what is this silly wench securing the\r\ndoor?\"\r\n\r\n\"With my arm, my lord, which I have passed through the rings, as a\r\nDouglas did for King James I, at a time when Douglases had dark hair\r\ninstead of red, and were faithful instead of being traitors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Since you know your history so well,\" replied Lindsay, in a rage,\" you\r\nshould remember that that weak barrier did not hinder Graham, that\r\nCatherine Douglas’s arm was broken like a willow wand, and that James I\r\nwas killed like a dog.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you, my lord,\" responded the courageous young girl, \"ought also to\r\nknow the ballad that is still sung in our time—\r\n\r\n\"’Now, on Robert Gra’am, The king’s destroyer, shame! To Robert Graham\r\ncling Shame, who destroyed our king.’\"\r\n\r\n\"Mary,\" cried the queen, who had overheard this altercation from her\r\nbedroom,—\"Mary, I command you to open the door directly: do you hear?\"\r\n\r\nMary obeyed, and Lord Lindsay entered, followed by Melville, who walked\r\nbehind him, with slow steps and bent head. Arrived in the middle of the\r\nsecond room, Lord Lindsay stopped, and, looking round him—\r\n\r\n\"Well, where is she, then?\" he asked; \"and has she not already kept us\r\nwaiting long enough outside, without making us wait again inside? Or\r\ndoes she imagine that, despite these walls and these bars, she is always\r\nqueen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Patience, my lord,\" murmured Sir Robert: \"you see that Lord Ruthven has\r\nnot come yet, and since we can do nothing without him, let us wait.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let wait who will,\" replied Lindsay, inflamed with anger; \"but it will\r\nnot be I, and wherever she may be, I shall go and seek her.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, he made some steps towards Mary Stuart’s bedroom; but\r\nat the same moment the queen opened the door, without seeming moved\r\neither at the visit or at the insolence of the visitors, and so lovely\r\nand so full of majesty, that each, even Lindsay himself, was silent at\r\nher appearance, and, as if in obedience to a higher power, bowed\r\nrespectfully before her.\r\n\r\n\"I fear I have kept you waiting, my lord,\" said the queen, without\r\nreplying to the ambassador’s salutation otherwise than by a slight\r\ninclination of the head; \"but a woman does not like to receive even\r\nenemies without having spent a few minutes over her toilet. It is true\r\nthat men are less tenacious of ceremony,\" added she, throwing a\r\nsignificant glance at Lord Lindsay’s rusty armour and soiled and pierced\r\ndoublet. \"Good day, Melville,\" she continued, without paying attention\r\nto some words of excuse stammered by Lindsay; \"be welcome in my prison,\r\nas you were in my palace; for I believe you as devoted to the one as to\r\nthe other\".\r\n\r\nThen, turning to Lindsay, who was looking interrogatively at the door,\r\nimpatient as he was for Ruthven to come—\r\n\r\n\"You have there, my lord,\" said she, pointing to the sword he carried\r\nover his shoulder, \"a faithful companion, though it is a little heavy:\r\ndid you expect, in coming here, to find enemies against whom to employ\r\nit? In the contrary case, it is a strange ornament for a lady’s\r\npresence. But no matter, my lord, I, am too much of a Stuart to fear the\r\nsight of a sword, even if it were naked, I warn you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not out of place here, madam,\" replied Lindsay, bringing it\r\nforward and leaning his elbow on its cross hilt, \"for it is an old\r\nacquaintance of your family.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your ancestors, my lord, were brave and loyal enough for me not to\r\nrefuse to believe what you tell me. Besides, such a good blade must have\r\nrendered them good service.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madam, yes, surely it has done so, but that kind of service that\r\nkings do not forgive. He for whom it was made was Archibald\r\nBell-the-Cat, and he girded himself with it the day when, to justify his\r\nname, he went to seize in the very tent of King James III, your\r\ngrandfather, his un worthy favourites, Cochran, Hummel, Leonard, and\r\nTorpichen, whom he hanged on Louder Bridge with the halters of his\r\nsoldiers’ horses. It was also with this sword that he slew at one blow,\r\nin the lists, Spens of Kilspindie, who had insulted him in the presence\r\nof King James IV, counting on the protection his master accorded him,\r\nand which did not guard him against it any more than his shield, which\r\nit split in two. At his master’s death, which took place two years after\r\nthe defeat of Flodden, on whose battlefield he left his two sons and two\r\nhundred warriors of the name of Douglas, it passed into the hands of the\r\nEarl of Angus, who drew it from the scabbard when he drove the Hamiltons\r\nout of Edinburgh, and that so quickly and completely that the affair was\r\ncalled the ’sweeping of the streets.’ Finally, your father James V saw\r\nit glisten in the fight of the bridge over the Tweed, when Buccleuch,\r\nstirred up by him, wanted to snatch him from the guardianship of the\r\nDouglases, and when eighty warriors of the name of Scott remained on the\r\nbattlefield.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said the queen, \"how is it that this weapon, after such exploits,\r\nhas not remained as a trophy in the Douglas family? No doubt the Earl of\r\nAngus required a great occasion to decide him to-renounce in your favour\r\nthis modern Excalibur\". [History of Scotland, by Sir Walter Scott.—\"The\r\nAbbott\": historical part.]\r\n\r\n\"Yes, no doubt, madam, it was upon a great occasion,\" replied Lindsay,\r\nin spite of the imploring signs made by Melville, \"and this will have at\r\nleast the advantage of the others, in being sufficiently recent for you\r\nto remember. It was ten days ago, on the battlefield of Carberry Hill,\r\nmadam, when the infamous Bothwell had the audacity to make a public\r\nchallenge in which he defied to single combat whomsoever would dare to\r\nmaintain that he was not innocent of the murder of the king your\r\nhusband. I made him answer then, I the third, that he was an assassin.\r\nAnd as he refused to fight with the two others under the pretext that\r\nthey were only barons, I presented myself in my turn, I who am earl and\r\nlord. It was on that occasion that the noble Earl of Morton gave me this\r\ngood sword to fight him to the death. So that, if he had been a little\r\nmore presumptuous or a little less cowardly, dogs and vultures would be\r\neating at this moment the pieces that, with the help of this good sword,\r\nI should have carved for them from that traitor’s carcass.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words, Mary Seyton and Robert Melville looked at each other in\r\nterror, for the events that they recalled were so recent that they were,\r\nso to speak, still living in the queen’s heart; but the queen, with\r\nincredible impassibility and a smile of contempt on her lips—\r\n\r\n\"It is easy, my lord,\" said she, \"to vanquish an enemy who does not\r\nappear in the lists; however, believe me, if Mary had inherited the\r\nStuarts’ sword as she has inherited their sceptre, your sword, long as\r\nit is, would yet have seemed to you too short. But as you have only to\r\nrelate to us now, my lord, what you intended doing, and not what you\r\nhave done, think it fit that I bring you back to something of more\r\nreality; for I do not suppose you have given yourself the trouble to\r\ncome here purely and simply to add a chapter to the little treatise Des\r\nRodomontades Espagnolles by M. de Brantome.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, madam,\" replied Lindsay, reddening with anger, \"and you\r\nwould already know the object of our mission if Lord Ruthven did not so\r\nridiculously keep us waiting. But,\" added he, \"have patience; the matter\r\nwill not be long now, for here he is.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, at that moment they heard steps mounting the staircase and\r\napproaching the room, and at the sound of these steps, the queen, who\r\nhad borne with such firmness Lindsay’s insults, grew so perceptibly\r\npaler, that Melville, who did not take his eyes off her,—put out his\r\nhand towards the arm-chair as if to push it towards her; but the queen\r\nmade a sign that she had no need of it, and gazed at the door with\r\napparent calm. Lord Ruthven appeared; it was the first time that she had\r\nseen the son since Rizzio had been assassinated by the father.\r\n\r\nLord Ruthven was both a warrior and a statesman, and at this moment his\r\ndress savoured of the two professions: it consisted of a close coat of\r\nembroidered buff leather, elegant enough to be worn as a court undress,\r\nand on which, if need were, one could buckle a cuirass, for battle: like\r\nhis father, he was pale; like his father, he was to die young, and, even\r\nmore than his father, his countenance wore that ill-omened melancholy by\r\nwhich fortune-tellers recognise those who are to die a violent death.\r\n\r\nLord Ruthven united in himself the polished dignity of a courtier and\r\nthe inflexible character of a minister; but quite resolved as he was to\r\nobtain from Mary Stuart, even if it were by violence, what he had come\r\nto demand in the regent’s name, he none the less made her, on entering,\r\na cold but respectful greeting, to which the queen responded with a\r\ncourtesy; then the steward drew up to the empty arm-chair a heavy table\r\non which had been prepared everything necessary for writing, and at a\r\nsign from the two lords he went out, leaving the queen and her companion\r\nalone with the three ambassadors. Then the queen, seeing that this table\r\nand this arm-chair were put ready for her, sat down; and after a moment,\r\nherself breaking this silence more gloomy than any word could have been—\r\n\r\n\"My lords,\" said she, \"you see that I wait: can it be that this message\r\nwhich you have to communicate to me is so terrible that two soldiers as\r\nrenowned as Lord Lindsay and Lord Ruthven hesitate at the moment of\r\ntransmitting it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" answered Ruthven, \"I am not of a family, as you know, which\r\never hesitates to perform a duty, painful as it may be; besides, we hope\r\nthat your captivity has prepared you to hear what we have to tell you on\r\nthe part of the Secret Council.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Secret Council!\" said the queen. \"Instituted by me, by what right\r\ndoes it act without me? No matter, I am waiting for this message: I\r\nsuppose it is a petition to implore my mercy for the men who have dared\r\nto reach to a power that I hold only from God.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" replied Ruthven, who appeared to have undertaken the painful\r\nrole of spokesman, while Lindsay, mute and impatient, fidgeted with the\r\nhilt of his long sword, \"it is distressing to me to have to undeceive\r\nyou on this point: it is not your mercy that I come to ask; it is, on\r\nthe contrary, the pardon of the Secret Council that I come to offer\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"To me, my lord, to me!\" cried Mary: \"subjects offer pardon to their\r\nqueen! Oh! it is such a new and wonderful thing, that my amazement\r\noutweighs my indignation, and that I beg you to continue, instead of\r\nstopping you there, as perhaps I ought to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I obey you so much the more willingly, madam,\" went on Ruthven\r\nimperturbably, \"that this pardon is only granted on certain conditions,\r\nstated in these documents, destined to re-establish the tranquillity of\r\nthe State, so cruelly compromised by the errors that they are going to\r\nrepair.\"\r\n\r\n\"And shall I be permitted, my lord, to read these documents, or must I,\r\nallured by my confidence in those who present them to me, sign them with\r\nmy eyes shut?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, madam,\" Ruthven returned; \"the Secret Council desire, on the\r\ncontrary, that you acquaint yourself with them, for you must sign them\r\nfreely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Read me these documents, my lord; for such a reading is, I think,\r\nincluded in the strange duties you have accepted.\"\r\n\r\nLord Ruthven took one of the two papers that he had in his hand, and\r\nread with the impassiveness of his usual voice the following:\r\n\r\n\"Summoned from my tenderest youth to the government of the kingdom and\r\nto the crown of Scotland, I have carefully attended to the\r\nadministration; but I have experienced so much fatigue and trouble that\r\nI no longer find my mind free enough nor my strength great enough to\r\nsupport the burden of affairs of State: accordingly, and as Divine\r\nfavour has granted us a son whom we desire to see during our lifetime\r\nbear the crown which he has acquired by right of birth, we have resolved\r\nto abdicate, and we abdicate in his favour, by these presents, freely\r\nand voluntarily, all our rights to the crown and to the government of\r\nScotland, desiring that he may immediately ascend the throne, as if he\r\nwere called to it by our natural death, and not as the effect of our own\r\nwill; and that our present abdication may have a more complete and\r\nsolemn effect, and that no one should put forward the claim of\r\nignorance, we give full powers to our trusty and faithful cousins, the\r\nlords Lindsay of Byres and William Ruthven, to appear in our name before\r\nthe nobility, the clergy, and the burgesses of Scotland, of whom they\r\nwill convoke an assembly at Stirling, and to there renounce, publicly\r\nand solemnly, on our part, all our claims to the crown and to the\r\ngovernment of Scotland.\r\n\r\n\"Signed freely and as the testimony of one of our last royal wishes, in\r\nour castle of Lochleven, the ___ June 1567\". (The date was left blank.)\r\n\r\nThere was a moment’s silence after this reading, then\r\n\r\n\"Did you hear, madam?\" asked Ruthven.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Mary Stuart,—\"yes, I have heard rebellious words that I\r\nhave not understood, and I thought that my ears, that one has tried to\r\naccustom for some time to a strange language, still deceived me, and\r\nthat I have thought for your honour, my lord William Ruthven, and my\r\nlord Lindsay of Byres.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" answered Lindsay, out of patience at having kept silence so\r\nlong, \"our honour has nothing to do with the opinion of a woman who has\r\nso ill known how to watch over her own.\"\r\n\r\n\"My lord!\" said Melville, risking a word.\r\n\r\n\"Let him speak, Robert,\" returned the queen. \"We have in our conscience\r\narmour as well tempered as that with which Lord Lindsay is so prudently\r\ncovered, although, to the shame of justice, we no longer have a sword.\r\nContinue, my lord,\" the queen went on, turning to Lord Ruthven: \"is this\r\nall that my subjects require of me? A date and a signature? Ah!\r\ndoubtless it is too little; and this second paper, which you have kept\r\nin order to proceed by degrees, probably contains some demand more\r\ndifficult to grant than that of yielding to a child scarcely a year old\r\na crown which belongs to me by birthright, and to abandon my sceptre to\r\ntake a distaff.\"\r\n\r\n\"This other paper,\" replied Ruthven, without letting himself be\r\nintimidated by the tone of bitter irony adopted by the queen, \"is the\r\ndeed by which your Grace confirms the decision of the Secret Council\r\nwhich has named your beloved brother, the Earl of Murray, regent of the\r\nkingdom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\" said Mary. \"The Secret Council thinks it needs my confirmation\r\nto an act of such slight importance? And my beloved brother, to bear it\r\nwithout remorse, needs that it should be I who add a fresh title to\r\nthose of Earl of Mar and of Murray that I have already bestowed upon\r\nhim? But one cannot desire anything more respectful and touching than\r\nall this, and I should be very wrong to complain. My lords,\" continued\r\nthe queen, rising and changing her tone, \"return to those who have sent\r\nyou, and tell them that to such demands Mary Stuart has no answer to\r\ngive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take care, madam,\" responded Ruthven; \"for I have told you it is only\r\non these conditions that your pardon can be granted you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if I refuse this generous pardon,\" asked Mary, \"what will happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot pronounce beforehand, madam; but your Grace has enough\r\nknowledge of the laws, and above all of the history of Scotland and\r\nEngland, to know that murder and adultery are crimes for which more than\r\none queen has been punished with death.\"\r\n\r\n\"And upon what proofs could such a charge be founded, my lord? Pardon my\r\npersistence, which takes up your precious time; but I am sufficiently\r\ninterested in the matter to be permitted such a question.\"\r\n\r\n\"The proof, madam?\" returned Ruthven. \"There is but one, I know; but\r\nthat one is unexceptionable: it is the precipitate marriage of the widow\r\nof the assassinated with the chief assassin, and the letters which have\r\nbeen handed over to us by James Balfour, which prove that the guilty\r\npersons had united their adulterous hearts before it was permitted them\r\nto unite their bloody hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"My lord,\" cried the queen, \"do you forget a certain repast given in an\r\nEdinburgh tavern, by this same Bothwell, to those same noblemen who\r\ntreat him to-day as an adulterer and a murderer; do you forget that at\r\nthe end of that meal, and on the same table at which it had been given,\r\na paper was signed to invite that same woman, to whom to-day you make\r\nthe haste of her new wedding a crime, to leave off a widow’s mourning to\r\nreassume a marriage robe? for if you have forgotten it, my lords, which\r\nwould do no more honour to your sobriety than to your memory, I\r\nundertake to show it to you, I who have preserved it; and perhaps if we\r\nsearch well we shall find among the signatures the names of Lindsay of\r\nByres and William Ruthven. O noble Lord Herries,\" cried Mary, \"loyal\r\nJames Melville, you alone were right then, when you threw yourselves at\r\nmy feet, entreating me not to conclude this marriage, which, I see it\r\nclearly to-day, was only a trap set for an ignorant woman by perfidious\r\nadvisers or disloyal lords.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" cried Ruthven, in spite of his cold impassivity beginning to\r\nlose command of himself, while Lindsay was giving still more noisy and\r\nless equivocal signs of impatience, \"madam, all these discussions are\r\nbeside our aim: I beg you to return to it, then, and inform us if, your\r\nlife and honour guaranteed, you consent to abdicate the crown of\r\nScotland.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what safeguard should I have that the promises you here make me\r\nwill be kept?\"\r\n\r\n\"Our word, madam,\" proudly replied Ruthven.\r\n\r\n\"Your word, my lord, is a very feeble pledge to offer, when one so\r\nquickly forgets one’s signature: have you not some trifle to add to it,\r\nto make me a little easier than I should be with it alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough, Ruthven, enough,\" cried Lindsay. \"Do you not see that for an\r\nhour this woman answers our proposals only by insults?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, let us go,\" said Ruthven; \"and thank yourself only, madam, for the\r\nday when the thread breaks which holds the sword suspended over your\r\nhead.\"\r\n\r\n\"My lords,\" cried Melville, \"my lords, in Heaven’s name, a little\r\npatience, and forgive something to her who, accustomed to command, is\r\ntoday forced to obey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Lindsay, turning round, \"stay with her, then, and try\r\nto obtain by your smooth words what is refused to our frank and loyal\r\ndemand. In a quarter of an hour we shall return: let the answer be ready\r\nin a quarter of an hour!\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, the two noblemen went out, leaving Melville with the\r\nqueen; and one could count their footsteps, from the noise that\r\nLindsay’s great sword made, in resounding on each step of the staircase.\r\n\r\nScarcely were they alone than Melville threw himself at the queen’s\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" said he, \"you remarked just now that Lord Herries and my\r\nbrother had given your Majesty advice that you repented not having\r\nfollowed; well, madam, reflect on that I in my turn give you; for it is\r\nmore important than the other, for you will regret with still more\r\nbitterness not having listened to it. Ah! you do not know what may\r\nhappen, you are ignorant of what your brother is capable.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me, however,\" returned the queen, \"that he has just\r\ninstructed me on that head: what more will he do than he has done\r\nalready? A public trial! Oh! it is all I ask: let me only plead my\r\ncause, and we shall see what judges will dare to condemn me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that is what they will take good care not to do, madam; for they\r\nwould be mad to do it when they keep you here in this isolated castle,\r\nin the care of your enemies, having no witness but God, who avenges\r\ncrime, but who does not prevent it. Recollect, madam, what Machiavelli\r\nhas said, ’A king’s tomb is never far from his prison.’ You come of a\r\nfamily in which one dies young, madam, and almost always of a sudden\r\ndeath: two of your ancestors perished by steel, and one by poison.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if my death were sudden and easy,\" cried Mary, \"yes, I should\r\naccept it as an expiation for my faults; for if I am proud when I\r\ncompare myself with others, Melville, I am humble when I judge myself. I\r\nam unjustly accused of being an accomplice of Darnley’s death, but I am\r\njustly condemned for having married Bothwell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Time presses, madam; time presses,\" cried Melville, looking at the\r\nsand, which, placed on the table, was marking the time. \"They are coming\r\nback, they will be here in a minute; and this time you must give them an\r\nanswer. Listen, madam, and at least profit by your situation as much as\r\nyou can. You are alone here with one woman, without friends, without\r\nprotection, without power: an abdication signed at such a juncture will\r\nnever appear to your people to have been freely given, but will always\r\npass as having been torn from you by force; and if need be, madam, if\r\nthe day comes when such a solemn declaration is worth something, well,\r\nthen you will have two witnesses of the violence done you: the one will\r\nbe Mary Seyton, and the other,\" he added in a low voice and looking\r\nuneasily about him,—\"the other will be Robert Melville.\"\r\n\r\nHardly had he finished speaking when the footsteps of the two nobles\r\nwere again heard on the staircase, returning even before the quarter of\r\nan hour had elapsed; a moment afterwards the door opened, and Ruthven\r\nappeared, while over his shoulder was seen Lindsay’s head.\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" said Ruthven, \"we have returned. Has your Grace decided? We\r\ncome for your answer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Lindsay, pushing aside Ruthven, who stood in his way, and\r\nadvancing to the table,—\"yes, an answer, clear, precise, positive, and\r\nwithout dissimulation.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are exacting, my lord,\" said the queen: \"you would scarcely have\r\nthe right to expect that from me if I were in full liberty on the other\r\nside of the lake and surrounded with a faithful escort; but between\r\nthese walls, behind these bars, in the depths of this fortress, I shall\r\nnot tell you that I sign voluntarily, lest you should not believe it.\r\nBut no matter, you want my signature; well, I am going to give it to\r\nyou. Melville, pass me the pen.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I hope,\" said Lord Ruthven, \"that your Grace is not counting on\r\nusing your present position one day in argument to protest against what\r\nyou are going to do?\"\r\n\r\nThe queen had already stooped to write, she had already set her hand to\r\nthe paper, when Ruthven spoke to her. But scarcely had he done so, than\r\nshe rose up proudly, and letting fall the pen, \"My lord,\" said she,\r\n\"what you asked of me just now was but an abdication pure and simple,\r\nand I was going to sign it. But if to this abdication is joined this\r\nmarginal note, then I renounce of my own accord, and as judging myself\r\nunworthy, the throne of Scotland. I would not do it for the three united\r\ncrowns that I have been robbed of in turn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take care, madam,\" cried Lord Lindsay, seizing the queen’s wrist with\r\nhis steel gauntlet and squeezing it with all his angry strength—\"take\r\ncare, for our patience is at an end, and we could easily end by breaking\r\nwhat would not bend.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen remained standing, and although a violent flush had passed\r\nlike a flame over her countenance, she did not utter a word, and did not\r\nmove: her eyes only were fixed with such a great expression of contempt\r\non those of the rough baron, that he, ashamed of the passion that had\r\ncarried him away, let go the hand he had seized and took a step back.\r\nThen raising her sleeve and showing the violet marks made on her arm by\r\nLord Lindsay’s steel gauntlet.\r\n\r\n\"This is what I expected, my lords,\" said she, \"and nothing prevents me\r\nany longer from signing; yes, I freely abdicate the throne and crown of\r\nScotland, and there is the proof that my will has not been forced.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, she took the pen and rapidly signed the two documents,\r\nheld them out to Lord Ruthven, and bowing with great dignity, withdrew\r\nslowly into her room, accompanied by Mary Seyton. Ruthven looked after\r\nher, and when she had disappeared, \"It doesn’t matter,\" he said; \"she\r\nhas signed, and although the means you employed, Lindsay, may be\r\nobsolete enough in diplomacy, it is not the less efficacious, it seems.\"\r\n\r\n\"No joking, Ruthven,\" said Lindsay; \"for she is a noble creature, and if\r\nI had dared, I should have thrown myself at her feet to ask her\r\nforgiveness.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is still time,\" replied Ruthven, \"and Mary, in her present\r\nsituation, will not be severe upon you: perhaps she has resolved to\r\nappeal to the judgment of God to prove her innocence, and in that case a\r\nchampion such as you might well change the face of things.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not joke, Ruthven,\" Lindsay answered a second time, with more\r\nviolence than the first; \"for if I were as well convinced of her\r\ninnocence as I am of her crime, I tell you that no one should touch a\r\nhair of her head, not even the regent.\"\r\n\r\n\"The devil! my lord,\" said Ruthven. \"I did not know you were so\r\nsensitive to a gentle voice and a tearful eye; you know the story of\r\nAchilles’ lance, which healed with its rust the wounds it made with its\r\nedge: do likewise my lord, do likewise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough, Ruthven, enough,\" replied Lindsay; \"you are like a corselet of\r\nMilan steel, which is three times as bright as the steel armour of\r\nGlasgow, but which is at the same time thrice as hard: we know one\r\nanother, Ruthven, so an end to railleries or threats; enough, believe\r\nme, enough.\"\r\n\r\nAnd after these words, Lord Lindsay went out first, followed by Ruthven\r\nand Melville, the first with his head high and affecting an air of\r\ninsolent indifference, and the second, sad, his brow bent, and not even\r\ntrying to disguise the painful impression which this scene had made on\r\nhim.’ [\"History of Scotland, by Sir Walter Scott.—’The Abbott\":\r\nhistorical part.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe queen came out of her room only in the evening, to take her place at\r\nthe window which looked over the lake: at the usual time she saw the\r\nlight which was henceforth her sole hope shine in the little house in\r\nKinross; for a whole long month she had no other consolation than seeing\r\nit, every night, fixed and faithful.\r\n\r\nAt last, at the end of this time, and as she was beginning to despair of\r\nseeing George Douglas again, one morning, on opening the window, she\r\nuttered a cry. Mary Seyton ran to her, and the queen, without having\r\nstrength to speak, showed her in the middle of the lake the tiny boat at\r\nanchor, and in the boat Little Douglas and George, who were absorbed in\r\nfishing, their favourite amusement. The young man had arrived the day\r\nbefore, and as everyone was accustomed to his unexpected returns, the\r\nsentinel had not even blown the horn, and the queen had not known that\r\nat last a friend had come.\r\n\r\nHowever, she was three days yet without seeing this friend otherwise\r\nthan she had just done-that is, on the lake. It is true that from\r\nmorning till evening he did not leave that spot, from which he could\r\nview the queen’s windows and the queen herself, when, to gaze at a wider\r\nhorizon, she leaned her face against the bars. At last, on the morning\r\nof the fourth day, the queen was awakened by a great noise of dogs and\r\nhorns: she immediately ran to the window, for to a prisoner everything\r\nis an event, and she saw William Douglas, who was embarking with a pack\r\nof hounds and some huntsmen. In fact, making a truce, for a day, with\r\nhis gaoler’s duties, to enjoy a pleasure more in harmony with his rank\r\nand birth, he was going to hunt in the woods which cover the last ridge\r\nof Ben Lomond, and which, ever sinking, die down on the banks of the\r\nlake.\r\n\r\nThe queen trembled with delight, for she hoped that Lady Lochleven would\r\nmaintain her ill-will, and that then George would replace his brother:\r\nthis hope was not disappointed. At the usual time the queen heard the\r\nfootsteps of those who were bringing her her breakfast; the door opened,\r\nand she saw George Douglas enter, preceded by the servants who were\r\ncarrying the dishes. George barely bowed; but the queen, warned by him\r\nnot to be surprised at anything, returned him his greeting with a\r\ndisdainful air; then the servants performed their task and went out, as\r\nthey were accustomed.\r\n\r\n\"At last,\" said the queen, \"you are back again, then.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge motioned with his finger, went to the door to listen if all the\r\nservants had really gone away, and if no one had remained to spy. Then,\r\nreturning more at ease, and bowing respectfully—\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madam,\" returned he; \"and, Heaven be thanked, I bring good news.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, tell me quickly!\" cried the queen; \"for staying in this castle is\r\nhell. You knew that they came, did you not, and that they made me sign\r\nan abdication?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied Douglas; \"but we also knew that your signature had\r\nbeen obtained from you by violence alone, and our devotion to your\r\nMajesty is increased thereby, if possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, after all, what have you done?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Seytons and the Hamiltons, who are, as your Majesty knows, your\r\nmost faithful servants,\"—Mary turned round, smiling, and put out her\r\nhand to Mary Seyton,—\"have already,\" continued George, \"assembled their\r\ntroops, who keep themselves in readiness for the first signal; but as\r\nthey alone would not be sufficiently numerous to hold the country, we\r\nshall make our way directly to Dumbarton, whose governor is ours, and\r\nwhich by its position and its strength can hold out long enough against\r\nall the regent’s troops to give to the faithful hearts remaining to you\r\ntime to come and join us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" said the queen; \"I see clearly what we shall do once we get\r\nout of this; but how are we to get out?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the occasion, madam,\" replied Douglas, \"for which your Majesty\r\nmust call to your aid that courage of which you have given such great\r\nproofs.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I have need only of courage and coolness,\" replied the queen, \"be\r\neasy; neither the one nor the other will fail me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here is a file,\" said George, giving Mary Seyton that instrument which\r\nhe judged unworthy to touch the queen’s hands, \"and this evening I shall\r\nbring your Majesty cords to construct a ladder. You will cut through one\r\nof the bars of this window, it is only at a height of twenty feet; I\r\nshall come up to you, as much to try it as to support you; one of the\r\ngarrison is in my pay, he will give us passage by the door it is his\r\nduty to guard, and you will be free.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when will that be?\" cried the queen.\r\n\r\n\"We must wait for two things, madam,\" replied Douglas: \"the first, to\r\ncollect at Kinross an escort sufficient for your Majesty’s safety; the\r\nsecond, that the turn for night watch of Thomas Warden should happen to\r\nbe at an isolated door that we can reach without being seen.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how will you know that? Do you stay at the castle, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! no, madam,\" replied George; \"at the castle I am a useless and\r\neven a dangerous friend for you, while once beyond the lake I can serve\r\nyou in an effectual manner.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how will you know when Warden’s turn to mount guard has come?\"\r\n\r\n\"The weathercock in the north tower, instead of turning in the wind with\r\nthe others, will remain fixed against it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I, how shall I be warned?\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything is already provided for on that side: the light which shines\r\neach night in the little house in Kinross incessantly tells you that\r\nyour friends keep watch for you; but when you would like to know if the\r\nhour of your deliverance approaches or recedes, in your turn place a\r\nlight in this window. The other will immediately disappear; then,\r\nplacing your hand on your breast, count your heartbeats: if you reach\r\nthe number twenty without the light reappearing, nothing is yet settled;\r\nif you only reach ten, the moment approaches; if the light does not\r\nleave you time to count beyond five, your escape is fixed for the\r\nfollowing night; if it reappears no more, it is fixed for the same\r\nevening; then the owl’s cry, repeated thrice in the courtyard, will be\r\nthe signal; let down the ladder when you hear it\".\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Douglas,\" cried the queen, \"you alone could foresee and calculate\r\neverything thus. Thank you, thank you a hundred times!\" And she gave him\r\nher hand to kiss.\r\n\r\nA vivid red flushed the young man’s cheeks; but almost directly\r\nmastering his emotion, he kneeled down, and, restraining the expression\r\nof that love of which he had once spoken to the queen, while promising\r\nher never more to speak of it, he took the hand that Mary extended, and\r\nkissed it with such respect that no one could have seen in this action\r\nanything but the homage of devotion and fidelity.\r\n\r\nThen, having bowed to the queen, he went out, that a longer stay with\r\nher should not give rise to any suspicions.\r\n\r\nAt the dinner-hour Douglas brought, as he had said, a parcel of cord. It\r\nwas not enough, but when evening came Mary Seyton was to unroll it and\r\nlet fall the end from the window, and George would fasten the remainder\r\nto it: the thing was done as arranged, and without any mishap, an hour\r\nafter the hunters had returned.\r\n\r\nThe following day George left the castle.\r\n\r\nThe queen and Mary Seyton lost no time in setting about the rope ladder,\r\nand it was finished on the third day. The same evening, the queen in her\r\nimpatience, and rather to assure herself of her partisans’ vigilance\r\nthan in the hope that the time of her deliverance was so near, brought\r\nher lamp to the window: immediately, and as George Douglas had told her,\r\nthe light in the little house at Kinross disappeared: the queen then\r\nlaid her hand on her heart and counted up to twenty-two; then the light\r\nreappeared; they were ready for everything, but nothing was yet settled.\r\nFor a week the queen thus questioned the light and her heart-beats\r\nwithout their number changing; at last, on the eighth day, she counted\r\nonly as far as ten; at the eleventh the light reappeared.\r\n\r\nThe queen believed herself mistaken: she did not dare to hope what this\r\nannounced. She withdrew the lamp; then, at the end of a quarter of an\r\nhour, showed it again: her unknown correspondent understood with his\r\nusual intelligence that a fresh trial was required of him, and the light\r\nin the little house disappeared in its turn. Mary again questioned the\r\npulsations of her heart, and, fast as it leaped, before the twelfth beat\r\nthe propitious star was shining on the horizon: there was no longer any\r\ndoubt; everything was settled.\r\n\r\nMary could not sleep all night: this persistency of her partisans\r\ninspired her with gratitude to the point of tears. The day came, and the\r\nqueen several times questioned her companion to assure herself that it\r\nwas not all a dream; at every sound it seemed to her that the scheme on\r\nwhich her liberty hung was discovered, and when, at breakfast and at\r\ndinner time, William Douglas entered as usual, she hardly dared look at\r\nhim, for fear of reading on his face the announcement that all was lost.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the queen again questioned the light: it made the same\r\nanswer; nothing had altered; the beacon was always one of hope.\r\n\r\nFor four days it thus continued to indicate that the moment of escape\r\nwas at hand; on the evening of the fifth, before the queen had counted\r\nfive beats, the light reappeared: the queen leaned upon Mary Seyton; she\r\nwas nearly fainting, between dread and ’delight. Her escape was fixed\r\nfor the next evening.\r\n\r\nThe queen tried once more, and obtained the same reply: there was no\r\nlonger a doubt; everything was ready except the prisoner’s courage, for\r\nit failed her for a moment, and if Mary Seyton had not drawn up a seat\r\nin time, she would have fallen prone; but, the first moment over, she\r\ncollected herself as usual, and was stronger and more resolute than\r\never.\r\n\r\nTill midnight the queen remained at the window, her eyes fixed on that\r\nstar of good omen: at last Mary Seyton persuaded her to go to bed,\r\noffering, if she had no wish to sleep, to read her some verses by M.\r\nRonsard, or some chapters from the Mer des Histoires; but Mary had no\r\ndesire now for any profane reading, and had her Hours read, making the\r\nresponses as she would have done if she had been present at a mass said\r\nby a Catholic priest: towards dawn, however, she grew drowsy, and as\r\nMary Seyton, for her part, was dropping with fatigue, she fell asleep\r\ndirectly in the arm-chair at the head of the queen’s bed.\r\n\r\nNext day she awoke, feeling that someone was tapping her on the\r\nshoulder: it was the queen, who had already arisen.\r\n\r\n\"Come and see, darling,\" said she,—\"come and see the fine day that God\r\nis giving us. Oh! how alive is Nature! How happy I shall be to be once\r\nmore free among those plains and mountains! Decidedly, Heaven is on our\r\nside.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" replied Mary, \"I would rather see the weather less fine: it\r\nwould promise us a darker night; and consider, what we need is darkness,\r\nnot light.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" said the queen; \"it is by this we are going to see if God is\r\nindeed for us; if the weather remains as it is, yes, you are right, He\r\nabandons us; but if it clouds over, oh! then, darling, this will be a\r\ncertain proof of His protection, will it not?\"\r\n\r\nMary Seyton smiled, nodding that she adopted her mistress’s\r\nsuperstition; then the queen, incapable of remaining idle in her great\r\npreoccupation of mind, collected the few jewels that she had preserved,\r\nenclosed them in a casket, got ready for the evening a black dress, in\r\norder to be still better hidden in the darkness: and, these preparations\r\nmade, she sat down again at the window, ceaselessly carrying her eyes\r\nfrom the lake to the little house in Kinross, shut up and dumb as usual.\r\n\r\nThe dinner-hour arrived: the queen was so happy that she received\r\nWilliam Douglas with more goodwill than was her wont, and it was with\r\ndifficulty she remained seated during the time the meal lasted; but she\r\nrestrained herself, and William Douglas withdrew, without seeming to\r\nhave noticed her agitation.\r\n\r\nScarcely had he gone than Mary ran to the window; she had need of air,\r\nand her gaze devoured in advance those wide horizons which she was about\r\nto cross anew; it seemed to her that once at liberty she would never\r\nshut herself up in a palace again, but would wander about the\r\ncountryside continually: then, amid all these tremors of delight, from\r\ntime to time she felt unexpectedly heavy at heart. She then turned round\r\nto Mary Seyton, trying to fortify her strength with hers, and the young\r\ngirl kept up her hopes, but rather from duty than from conviction.\r\n\r\nBut slow as they seemed to the queen, the hours yet passed: towards the\r\nafternoon some clouds floated across the blue sky; the queen remarked\r\nupon them joyfully to her companion; Mary Seyton congratulated her upon\r\nthem, not on account of the imaginary omen that the queen sought in\r\nthem, but because of the real importance that the weather should be\r\ncloudy, that darkness might aid them in their flight. While the two\r\nprisoners were watching the billowy, moving vapours, the hour of dinner\r\narrived; but it was half an hour of constraint and dissimulation, the\r\nmore painful that, no doubt in return for the sort of goodwill shown him\r\nby the queen in the morning, William Douglas thought himself obliged, in\r\nhis turn, to accompany his duties with fitting compliments, which\r\ncompelled the queen to take a more active part in the conversation than\r\nher preoccupation allowed her; but William Douglas did not seem in any\r\nway to observe this absence of mind, and all passed as at breakfast.\r\n\r\nDirectly he had gone the queen ran to the window: the few clouds which\r\nwere chasing one another in the sky an hour before had thickened and\r\nspread, and—all the blue was blotted out, to give place to a hue dull\r\nand leaden as pewter. Mary Stuart’s presentiments were thus realised: as\r\nto the little house in Kinross, which one could still make out in the\r\ndusk, it remained shut up, and seemed deserted.\r\n\r\nNight fell: the light shone as usual; the queen signalled, it\r\ndisappeared. Mary Stuart waited in vain; everything remained in\r\ndarkness: the escape was for the same evening. The queen heard eight\r\no’clock, nine o’clock, and ten o’clock strike successively. At ten\r\no’clock the sentinels were relieved; Mary Stuart heard the patrols pass\r\nbeneath her windows, the steps of the watch recede: then all returned to\r\nsilence. Half an hour passed away thus; suddenly the owl’s cry resounded\r\nthrice, the queen recognised George Douglas’s signal: the supreme moment\r\nhad come.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances the queen found all her strength revive: she\r\nsigned to Mary Seyton to take away the bar and to fix the rope ladder,\r\nwhile, putting out the lamp, she felt her way into the bedroom to seek\r\nthe casket which contained her few remaining jewels. When she came back,\r\nGeorge Douglas was already in the room.\r\n\r\n\"All goes well, madam,\" said he. \"Your friends await you on the other\r\nside of the lake, Thomas Warden watches at the postern, and God has sent\r\nus a dark night.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen, without replying, gave him her hand. George bent his knee and\r\ncarried this hand to his lips; but on touching it, he felt it cold and\r\ntrembling.\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" said he, \"in Heaven’s name summon all your courage, and do not\r\nlet yourself be downcast at such a moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our Lady-of-Good-Help,\" murmured Seyton, \"come to our aid!\"\r\n\r\n\"Summon to you the spirit of the kings your ancestors,\" responded\r\nGeorge, \"for at this moment it is not the resignation of a Christian\r\nthat you require, but the strength and resolution of a queen\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Douglas! Douglas,\" cried Mary mournfully, \"a fortune-teller\r\npredicted to me that I should die in prison and by a violent death: has\r\nnot the hour of the prediction arrived?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" George said, \"but it is better to die as a queen than to live\r\nin this ancient castle calumniated and a prisoner.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, George,\" the queen answered; \"but for a woman the first\r\nstep is everything: forgive me\". Then, after a moment’s pause, \"Come,\"\r\nsaid she; \"I am ready.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge immediately went to the window, secured the ladder again and more\r\nfirmly, then getting up on to the sill and holding to the bars with one\r\nhand, he stretched out the other to the queen, who, as resolute as she\r\nhad been timid a moment before, mounted on a stool, and had already set\r\none foot on the window-ledge, when suddenly the cry, \"Who goes there?\"\r\nrang out at the foot of the tower. The queen sprang quickly back, partly\r\ninstinctively and partly pushed by George, who, on the contrary, leaned\r\nout of the window to see whence came this cry, which, twice again\r\nrenewed, remained twice unanswered, and was immediately followed by a\r\nreport and the flash of a firearm: at the same moment the sentinel on\r\nduty on the tower blew his bugle, another set going the alarm bell, and\r\nthe cries, \"To arms, to arms!\" and \"Treason, treason!\" resounded\r\nthroughout the castle.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, treason, treason!\" cried George Douglas, leaping down into\r\nthe room. \"Yes, the infamous Warden has betrayed us!\" Then, advancing to\r\nMary, cold and motionless as a statue, \"Courage, madam,\" said he,\r\n\"courage! Whatever happens, a friend yet remains for you in the castle;\r\nit is Little Douglas.\"\r\n\r\nScarcely had he finished speaking when the door of the queen’s apartment\r\nopened, and William Douglas and Lady Lochleven, preceded by servants\r\ncarrying torches and armed soldiers, appeared on the threshold: the room\r\nwas immediately filled with people and light.\r\n\r\n\"Mother,\" said William Douglas, pointing to his brother standing before\r\nMary Stuart and protecting her with his body, \"do you believe me now?\r\nLook!\"\r\n\r\nThe old lady was for a moment speechless; then finding a word at last,\r\nand taking a step forward—\r\n\r\n\"Speak, George Douglas,\" cried she, \"speak, and clear yourself at once\r\nof the charge which weighs on your honour; say but these words, ’A\r\nDouglas was never faithless to his trust,’ and I believe you\".\r\n\r\n\"Yes, mother,\" answered William, \"a Douglas!... but he—he is not a\r\nDouglas.\"\r\n\r\n\"May God grant my old age the strength needed to bear on the part of one\r\nof my sons such a misfortune, and on the part of the other such an\r\ninjury!\" exclaimed Lady Lochleven. \"O woman born under a fatal star,\"\r\nshe went on, addressing the queen, \"when will you cease to be, in the\r\nDevil’s hands, an instrument of perdition and death to all who approach\r\nyou? O ancient house of Lochleven, cursed be the hour when this\r\nenchantress crossed thy threshold!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not say that, mother, do not say that,\" cried George; \"blessed be,\r\non the contrary, the moment which proves that, if there are Douglases\r\nwho no longer remember what they owe to their sovereigns, there are\r\nothers who have never forgotten it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Douglas! Douglas!\" murmured Mary Stuart, \"did I not tell you?\"\r\n\r\n\"And I, madam,\" said George, \"what did I reply then? That it was an\r\nhonour and a duty to every faithful subject of your Majesty to die for\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, die, then!\" cried William Douglas, springing on his brother with\r\nraised sword, while he, leaping back, drew his, and with a movement\r\nquick as thought and eager as hatred defended himself. But at the same\r\nmoment Mary Stuart darted between the two young people.\r\n\r\n\"Not another step, Lord Douglas,\" said she. \"Sheathe your sword, George,\r\nor if you use it, let be to go hence, and against everyone but your\r\nbrother. I still have need of your life; take care of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"My life, like my arm and my honour, is at your service, madam, and from\r\nthe moment you command it I shall preserve it for you.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, rushing to the door with a violence and resolve which\r\nprevented anyone’s stopping him—\r\n\r\n\"Back!\" cried he to the domestics who were barring the passage; \"make\r\nway for the young master of Douglas, or woe to you!\".\r\n\r\n\"Stop him!\" cried William. \"Seize him, dead or alive! Fire upon him!\r\nKill him like a dog!\"\r\n\r\nTwo or three soldiers, not daring to disobey William, pretended to\r\npursue his brother. Then some gunshots were heard, and a voice crying\r\nthat George Douglas had just thrown himself into the lake.\r\n\r\n\"And has he then escaped?\" cried William.\r\n\r\nMary Stuart breathed again; the old lady raised her hands to Heaven.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" murmured William,—\"yes, thank Heaven for your son’s flight;\r\nfor his flight covers our entire house with shame; counting from this\r\nhour, we shall be looked upon as the accomplices of his treason.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have pity on me, William!\" cried Lady Lochleven, wringing her hands.\r\n\"Have compassion on your old mother! See you not that I am dying?\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, she fell backwards, pale and tottering; the steward\r\nand a servant supported her in their arms.\r\n\r\n\"I believe, my lord,\" said Mary Seyton, coming forward, \"that your\r\nmother has as much need of attention just now as the queen has need of\r\nrepose: do you not consider it is time for you to withdraw?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" said William, \"to give you time to spin fresh webs, I\r\nsuppose, and to seek what fresh flies you can take in them? It is well,\r\ngo on with your work; but you have just seen that it is not easy to\r\ndeceive William Douglas. Play your game, I shall play mine\". Then\r\nturning to the servants, \"Go out, all of you,\" said he; \"and you,\r\nmother, come.\"\r\n\r\nThe servants and the soldiers obeyed; then William Douglas went out\r\nlast, supporting Lady Lochleven, and the queen heard him shut behind him\r\nand double-lock the two doors of her prison.\r\n\r\nScarcely was Mary alone, and certain that she was no longer seen or\r\nheard, than all her strength deserted her, and, sinking into an\r\narm-chair, she burst out sobbing.\r\n\r\nIndeed, all her courage had been needed to sustain her so far, and the\r\nsight of her enemies alone had given her this courage; but hardly had\r\nthey gone than her situation appeared before her in all its fatal\r\nhardship. Dethroned, a prisoner, without another fiend in this\r\nimpregnable castle than a child to whom she had scarce given attention,\r\nand who was the sole and last thread attaching her past hopes to her\r\nhopes for the future, what remained to Mary Stuart of her two thrones\r\nand her double power? Her name, that was all; her, name with which,\r\nfree, she had doubtless stirred Scotland, but which little by little was\r\nabout to be effaced in the hearts of her adherents, and which during her\r\nlifetime oblivion was to cover perhaps as with a shroud. Such an idea\r\nwas insupportable to a soul as lofty as Mary Stuart’s, and to an\r\norganisation which, like that of the flowers, has need, before\r\neverything, of air, light, and sun.\r\n\r\nFortunately there remained to her the best beloved of her four Marys,\r\nwho, always devoted and consoling, hastened to succour and comfort her;\r\nbut this time it was no easy matter, and the queen let her act and speak\r\nwithout answering her otherwise than with sobs and tears; when suddenly,\r\nlooking through the window to which she had drawn up her mistress’s\r\narmchair—\r\n\r\n\"The light!\" cried she, \"madam, the light!\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time she raised the queen, and with arm outstretched from\r\nthe window, she showed her the beacon, the eternal symbol of hope,\r\nrelighted in the midst of this dark night on Kinross hill: there was no\r\nmistake possible, not a star was shining in the sky.\r\n\r\n\"Lord God, I give Thee thanks,\" said the queen, falling on her knees and\r\nraising her arms to heaven with a gesture of gratitude: \"Douglas has\r\nescaped, and my friends still keep watch.\"\r\n\r\nThen, after a fervent prayer, which restored to her a little strength,\r\nthe queen re-entered her room, and, tired out by her varied successive\r\nemotions, she slept an uneasy, agitated sleep, over which the\r\nindefatigable Mary Seyton kept watch till daybreak.\r\n\r\nAs William Douglas had said, from this time forward the queen was a\r\nprisoner indeed, and permission to go down into the garden was no longer\r\ngranted but under the surveillance of two soldiers; but this annoyance\r\nseemed to her so unbearable that she preferred to give up the\r\nrecreation, which, surrounded with such conditions, became a torture. So\r\nshe shut herself up in her apartments, finding a certain bitter and\r\nhaughty pleasure in the very excess of her misfortune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nA week after the events we have related, as nine o’clock in the evening\r\nhad just sounded from the castle bell, and the queen and Mary Seyton\r\nwere sitting at a table where they were working at their tapestry, a\r\nstone thrown from the courtyard passed through the window bars, broke a\r\npane of glass, and fell into the room. The queen’s first idea was to\r\nbelieve it accidental or an insult; but Mary Seyton, turning round,\r\nnoticed that the stone was wrapped up in a paper: she immediately picked\r\nit up. The paper was a letter from George Douglas, conceived in these\r\nterms:\r\n\r\n\"You have commanded me to live, madam: I have obeyed, and your Majesty\r\nhas been able to tell, from the Kinross light, that your servants\r\ncontinue to watch over you. However, not to raise suspicion, the\r\nsoldiers collected for that fatal night dispersed at dawn, and will not\r\ngather again till a fresh attempt makes their presence necessary. But,\r\nalas! to renew this attempt now, when your Majesty’s gaolers are on\r\ntheir guard, would be your ruin. Let them take every precaution, then,\r\nmadam; let them sleep in security, while we, we, in our devotion, shall\r\ngo on watching.\r\n\r\n\"Patience and courage!\"\r\n\r\n\"Brave and loyal heart!\" cried Mary, \"more constantly devoted to\r\nmisfortune than others are to prosperity! Yes, I shall have patience and\r\ncourage, and so long as that light shines I shall still believe in\r\nliberty.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter restored to the queen all her former courage: she had means\r\nof communication with George through Little Douglas; for no doubt it was\r\nhe who had thrown that stone. She hastened, in her turn, to write a\r\nletter to George, in which she both charged him to express her gratitude\r\nto all the lords who had signed the protestation; and begged them, in\r\nthe name of the fidelity they had sworn to her, not to cool in their\r\ndevotion, promising them, for her part, to await the result with that\r\npatience and courage they asked of her.\r\n\r\nThe queen was not mistaken: next day, as she was at her window, Little\r\nDouglas came to play at the foot of the tower, and, without raising his\r\nhead, stopped just beneath her to dig a trap to catch birds. The queen\r\nlooked to see if she were observed, and assured that that part of the\r\ncourtyard was deserted, she let fall the stone wrapped in her letter: at\r\nfirst she feared to have made a serious error; for Little Douglas did\r\nnot even turn at the noise, and it was only after a moment, during which\r\nthe prisoner’s heart was torn with frightful anxiety, that\r\nindifferently, and as if he were looking for something else, the child\r\nlaid his hand on the stone, and without hurrying, without raising his\r\nhead, without indeed giving any sign of intelligence to her who had\r\nthrown it, he put the letter in his pocket, finishing the work he had\r\nbegun with the greatest calm, and showing the queen, by this coolness\r\nbeyond his years, what reliance she could place in him.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment the queen regained fresh hope; but days, weeks, months\r\npassed without bringing any change in her situation: winter came; the\r\nprisoner saw snow spread over the plains and mountains, and the lake\r\nafforded her, if she had only been able to pass the door, a firm road to\r\ngain the other bank; but no letter came during all this time to bring\r\nher the consoling news that they were busy about her deliverance; the\r\nfaithful light alone announced to her every evening that a friend was\r\nkeeping watch.\r\n\r\nSoon nature awoke from her death-sleep: some forward sun-rays broke\r\nthrough the clouds of this sombre sky of Scotland; the snow melted, the\r\nlake broke its ice-crust, the first buds opened, the green turf\r\nreappeared; everything came out of its prison at the joyous approach of\r\nspring, and it was a great grief to Mary to see that she alone was\r\ncondemned to an eternal winter.\r\n\r\nAt last; one evening, she thought she observed in the motions of the\r\nlight that something fresh was happening: she had so often questioned\r\nthis poor flickering star, and she had so often let it count her\r\nheart-beats more than twenty times, that to spare herself the pain of\r\ndisappointment, for a long time she had no longer interrogated it;\r\nhowever, she resolved to make one last attempt, and, almost hopeless,\r\nshe put her light near the window, and immediately took it away; still,\r\nfaithful to the signal, the other disappeared at the same moment, and\r\nreappeared at the eleventh heart-beat of the queen. At the same time, by\r\na strange coincidence, a stone passing through the window fell at Mary\r\nSeyton’s feet. It was, like the first, wrapped in a letter from George:\r\nthe queen took it from her companion’s hands, opened it, and read:\r\n\r\n\"The moment draws near; your adherents are assembled; summon all your\r\ncourage.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow, at eleven o’clock in the evening, drop a cord from your\r\nwindow, and draw up the packet that will be fastened to it.\"\r\n\r\nThere remained in the queen’s apartments the rope over and above what\r\nhad served for the ladder taken away by the guards the evening of the\r\nfrustrated escape: next day, at the appointed hour, the two prisoners\r\nshut up the lamp in the bedroom, so that no light should betray them,\r\nand Mary Seyton, approaching the window, let down the cord. After a\r\nminute, she felt from its movements that something was being attached to\r\nit. Mary Seyton pulled, and a rather bulky parcel appeared at the bars,\r\nwhich it could not pass on account of its size. Then the queen came to\r\nher companion’s aid. The parcel was untied, and its contents,\r\nseparately, got through easily. The two prisoners carried them into the\r\nbedroom, and, barricaded within, commenced an inventory. There were two\r\ncomplete suits of men’s clothes in the Douglas livery. The queen was at\r\na loss, when she saw a letter fastened to the collar of one of the two\r\ncoats. Eager to know the meaning of this enigma, she immediately opened\r\nit, and read as follows:\r\n\r\n\"It is only by dint of audacity that her Majesty can recover her\r\nliberty: let her Majesty read this letter, then, and punctually follow,\r\nif she deign to adopt them, the instructions she will find therein.\r\n\r\n\"In the daytime the keys of the castle do not leave the belt of the old\r\nsteward; when curfew is rung and he has made his rounds to make sure\r\nthat all the doors are fast shut, he gives them up to William Douglas,\r\nwho, if he stays up, fastens them to his sword-belt, or, if he sleeps,\r\nputs them under his pillow. For five months, Little Douglas, whom\r\neveryone is accustomed to see working at the armourer’s forge of the\r\ncastle, has been employed in making some keys like enough to the others,\r\nonce they are substituted for them, for William to be deceived.\r\nYesterday Little Douglas finished the last.\r\n\r\n\"On the first favourable opportunity that her Majesty will know to be\r\nabout to present itself, by carefully questioning the light each day,\r\nLittle Douglas will exchange the false keys for the true, will enter the\r\nqueen’s room, and will find her dressed, as well as Miss Mary Seyton, in\r\ntheir men’s clothing, and he will go before them to lead them, by the\r\nway which offers the best chances for their escape; a boat will be\r\nprepared and will await them.\r\n\r\n\"Till then, every evening, as much to accustom themselves to these new\r\ncostumes as to give them an appearance of having been worn, her Majesty\r\nand Miss Mary Seyton will dress themselves in the suits, which they must\r\nkeep on from nine o’clock till midnight. Besides, it is possible that,\r\nwithout having had time to warn them, their young guide may suddenly\r\ncome to seek them: it is urgent, then, that he find them ready.\r\n\r\n\"The garments ought to fit perfectly her Majesty and her companion, the\r\nmeasure having been taken on Miss Mary Fleming and Miss Mary Livingston,\r\nwho are exactly their size.\r\n\r\n\"One cannot too strongly recommend her Majesty to summon to her aid on\r\nthe supreme occasion the coolness and courage of which she has given\r\nsuch frequent proofs at other times.\"\r\n\r\nThe two prisoners were astounded at the boldness of this plan: at first\r\nthey looked at one another in consternation, for success seemed\r\nimpossible. They none the less made trial of their disguise: as George\r\nhad said, it fitted each of them as if they had been measured for it.\r\n\r\nEvery evening the queen questioned the light, as George had urged, and\r\nthat for a whole long month, during which each evening the queen and\r\nMary Seyton, although the light gave no fresh tidings, arrayed\r\nthemselves in their men’s clothes, as had been arranged, so that they\r\nboth acquired such practice that they became as familiar to them as\r\nthose of their own sex.\r\n\r\nAt last, the 2nd May, 1568, the queen was awakened by the blowing of a\r\nhorn: uneasy as to what it announced, she slipped on a cloak and ran to\r\nthe window, where Mary Seyton joined her directly. A rather numerous\r\nband of horsemen had halted on the side of the lake, displaying the\r\nDouglas pennon, and three boats were rowing together and vying with each\r\nother to fetch the new arrivals.\r\n\r\nThis event caused the queen dismay: in her situation the least change in\r\nthe castle routine was to be feared, for it might upset all the\r\nconcerted plans. This apprehension redoubled when, on the boats drawing\r\nnear, the queen recognised in the elder Lord Douglas, the husband of\r\nLady Lochleven, and the father of William and George. The venerable\r\nknight, who was Keeper of the Marches in the north, was coming to visit\r\nhis ancient manor, in which he had not set foot for three years.\r\n\r\nIt was an event for Lochleven; and, some minutes after the arrival of\r\nthe boats, Mary Stuart heard the old steward’s footsteps mounting the\r\nstairs: he came to announce his master’s arrival to the queen, and, as\r\nit must needs be a time of rejoicing to all the castle inhabitants when\r\nits master returned, he came to invite the queen to the dinner in\r\ncelebration of the event: whether instinctively or from distaste, the\r\nqueen declined.\r\n\r\nAll day long the bell and the bugle resounded: Lord Douglas, like a true\r\nfeudal lord, travelled with the retinue of a prince. One saw nothing but\r\nnew soldiers and servants passing and repassing beneath the queen’s\r\nwindows: the footmen and horsemen were wearing, moreover, a livery\r\nsimilar to that which the queen and Mary Seyton had received.\r\n\r\nMary awaited the night with impatience. The day before, she had\r\nquestioned her light, and it had informed her as usual, in reappearing\r\nat her eleventh or twelfth heart-beat, that the moment of escape was\r\nnear; but she greatly feared that Lord Douglas’s arrival might have\r\nupset everything, and that this evening’s signal could only announce a\r\npostponement. But hardly had she seen the light shine than she placed\r\nher lamp in the window; the other disappeared directly, and Mary Stuart,\r\nwith terrible anxiety, began to question it. This anxiety increased when\r\nshe had counted more than fifteen beats. Then she stopped, cast down,\r\nher eyes mechanically fixed on the spot where the light had been. But\r\nher astonishment was great when, at the end of a few minutes, she did\r\nnot see it reappear, and when, half an hour having elapsed, everything\r\nremained in darkness. The queen then renewed her signal, but obtained no\r\nresponse: the escape was for the same evening.\r\n\r\nThe queen and Mary Seyton were so little expecting this issue, that,\r\ncontrary to their custom, they had not put on their men’s clothes that\r\nevening. They immediately flew to the queen’s bed-chamber, bolted the\r\ndoor behind them, and began to dress.\r\n\r\nThey had hardly finished their hurried toilette when they heard a key\r\nturn in the lock: they immediately blew out the lamp. Light steps\r\napproached the door. The two women leaned one against the other; for\r\nthey both were near falling. Someone tapped gently. The queen asked who\r\nwas there, and Little Douglas’s voice answered in the two first lines of\r\nan old ballad—\r\n\r\n\"Douglas, Douglas, Tender and true.\"\r\n\r\nMary opened, directly: it was the watchword agreed upon with George\r\nDouglas.\r\n\r\nThe child was without a light. He stretched out his hand and encountered\r\nthe queen’s: in the starlight, Mary Stuart saw him kneel down; then she\r\nfelt the imprint of his lips on her fingers.\r\n\r\n\"Is your Majesty ready to follow me?\" he asked in a low tone, rising.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my child,\" the queen answered: \"it is for this evening, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"With your Majesty’s permission, yes, it is for this evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is everything ready?\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are we to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Follow me everywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"My God! my God!\" cried Mary Stuart, \"have pity on us!\" Then, having\r\nbreathed a short prayer in a low voice, while Mary Seyton was taking the\r\ncasket in which were the queen’s jewels, \"I am ready,\" said she: \"and\r\nyou, darling?\"\r\n\r\n\"I also,\" replied Mary Seyton.\r\n\r\n\"Come, then,\" said Little Douglas.\r\n\r\nThe two prisoners followed the child; the queen going first, and Mary\r\nSeyton after. Their youthful guide carefully shut again the door behind\r\nhim, so that if a warder happened to pass he would see nothing; then he\r\nbegan to descend the winding stair. Half-way down, the noise of the\r\nfeast reached them, a mingling of shouts of laughter, the confusion of\r\nvoices, and the clinking of glasses. The queen placed her hand on her\r\nyoung guide’s shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you leading us?\" she asked him with terror.\r\n\r\n\"Out of the castle,\" replied the child.\r\n\r\n\"But we shall have to pass through the great hall?\"\r\n\r\n\"Without a doubt; and that is exactly what George foresaw. Among the\r\nfootmen, whose livery your Majesty is wearing, no one will recognise\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"My God! my God!\" the queen murmured, leaning against the wall.\r\n\r\n\"Courage, madam,\" said Mary Seyton in a low voice, \"or we are lost.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" returned the queen; \"let us go\". And they started again\r\nstill led by their guide.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the stair he stopped, and giving the queen a stone\r\npitcher full of wine—\r\n\r\n\"Set this jug on your right shoulder, madam,\" said he; \"it will hide\r\nyour face from the guests, and your Majesty will give rise to less\r\nsuspicion if carrying something. You, Miss Mary, give me that casket,\r\nand put on your head this basket of bread. Now, that’s right: do you\r\nfeel you have strength?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the queen.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mary Seyton.\r\n\r\n\"Then follow me.\"\r\n\r\nThe child went on his way, and after a few steps the fugitives found\r\nthemselves in a kind of antechamber to the great hall, from which\r\nproceeded noise and light. Several servants were occupied there with\r\ndifferent duties; not one paid attention to them, and that a little\r\nreassured the queen. Besides, there was no longer any drawing back:\r\nLittle Douglas had just entered the great hall.\r\n\r\nThe guests, seated on both sides of a long table ranged according to the\r\nrank of those assembled at it, were beginning dessert, and consequently\r\nhad reached the gayest moment of the repast. Moreover, the hall was so\r\nlarge that the lamps and candles which lighted it, multiplied as they\r\nwere, left in the most favourable half-light both sides of the\r\napartment, in which fifteen or twenty servants were coming and going.\r\nThe queen and Mary Seyton mingled with this crowd, which was too much\r\noccupied to notice them, and without stopping, without slackening,\r\nwithout looking back, they crossed the whole length of the hall, reached\r\nthe other door, and found themselves in the vestibule corresponding to\r\nthe one they had passed through on coming in. The queen set down her jug\r\nthere, Mary Seyton her basket, and both, still led by the child, entered\r\na corridor at the end of which they found themselves in the courtyard. A\r\npatrol was passing at the moment, but he took no notice of them.\r\n\r\nThe child made his way towards the garden, still followed by the two\r\nwomen. There, for no little while, it was necessary to try which of all\r\nthe keys opened the door; it—was a time of inexpressible anxiety. At\r\nlast the key turned in the lock, the door opened; the queen and Mary\r\nSeyton rushed into the garden. The child closed the door behind them.\r\n\r\nAbout two-thirds of the way across, Little Douglas held out his hand as\r\na sign to them to stop; then, putting down the casket and the keys on\r\nthe ground, he placed his hands together, and blowing into them, thrice\r\nimitated the owl’s cry so well that it was impossible to believe that a\r\nhuman voice was uttering the sounds; then, picking up the casket and the\r\nkeys, he kept on his way on tiptoe and with an attentive ear. On getting\r\nnear the wall, they again stopped, and after a moment’s anxious waiting\r\nthey heard a groan, then something like the sound of a falling body.\r\nSome seconds later the owl’s cry was—answered by a tu-whit-tu-whoo.\r\n\r\n\"It is over,\" Little Douglas said calmly; \"come.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is over?\" asked the queen; \"and what is that groan we heard?\"\r\n\r\n\"There was a sentry at the door on to the lake,\" the child answered,\r\n\"but he is no longer there.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen felt her heart’s blood grow cold, at the same time that a\r\nchilly sweat broke out to the roots of her hair; for she perfectly\r\nunderstood: an unfortunate being had just lost his life on her account.\r\nTottering, she leaned on Mary Seyton, who herself felt her strength\r\ngiving way. Meanwhile Little Douglas was trying the keys: the second\r\nopened the door.\r\n\r\n\"And the queen?\" said in a low voice a man who was waiting on the other\r\nside of the wall.\r\n\r\n\"She is following me,\" replied the child.\r\n\r\nGeorge Douglas, for it was he, sprang into the garden, and, taking the\r\nqueen’s arm on one side and Mary Seyton’s on the other, he hurried them\r\naway quickly to the lake-side. When passing through the doorway Mary\r\nStuart could not help throwing an uneasy look about her, and it seemed\r\nto her that a shapeless object was lying at the bottom of the wall, and\r\nas she was shuddering all over.\r\n\r\n\"Do not pity him,\" said George in a low voice, \"for it is a judgment\r\nfrom heaven. That man was the infamous Warden who betrayed us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" said the queen, \"guilty as he was, he is none the less dead on\r\nmy account.\"\r\n\r\n\"When it concerned your safety, madam, was one to haggle over drops of\r\nthat base blood? But silence! This way, William, this way; let us keep\r\nalong the wall, whose shadow hides us. The boat is within twenty steps,\r\nand we are saved.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, George hurried on the two women still more quickly,\r\nand all four, without having been detected, reached the banks of the\r\nlake. ’As Douglas had said, a little boat was waiting; and, on seeing\r\nthe fugitives approach, four rowers, couched along its bottom, rose, and\r\none of them, springing to land, pulled the chain, so that the queen and\r\nMary Seyton could get in. Douglas seated them at the prow, the child\r\nplaced himself at the rudder, and George, with a kick, pushed off the\r\nboat, which began to glide over the lake.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said he, \"we are really saved; for they might as well pursue\r\na sea swallow on Solway Firth as try to reach us. Row, children, row;\r\nnever mind if they hear us: the main thing is to get into the open.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who goes there?\" cried a voice above, from the castle terrace.\r\n\r\n\"Row, row,\" said Douglas, placing himself in front of the queen.\r\n\r\n\"The boat! the boat!\" cried the same voice; \"bring to the boat!\" Then,\r\nseeing that it continued to recede, \"Treason! treason!\" cried the\r\nsentinel. \"To arms!\"\r\n\r\nAt the same moment a flash lit up the lake; the report of a firearm was\r\nheard, and a ball passed, whistling. The queen uttered a little cry,\r\nalthough she had run no danger, George, as we have said, having placed\r\nhimself in front of her, quite protecting her with his body.\r\n\r\nThe alarm bell now rang, and all the castle lights were seen moving and\r\nglancing about, as if distracted, in the rooms.\r\n\r\n\"Courage, children!\" said Douglas. \"Row as if your lives depended on\r\neach stroke of the oar; for ere five minutes the skiff will be out after\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\n\"That won’t be so easy for them as you think, George,\" said Little\r\nDouglas; \"for I shut all the doors behind me, and some time will elapse\r\nbefore the keys that I have left there open them. As to these,\" added\r\nhe, showing those he had so skilfully abstracted, \"I resign them to the\r\nKelpie, the genie of the lake, and I nominate him porter of Lochleven\r\nCastle.\"\r\n\r\nThe discharge of a small piece of artillery answered William’s joke; but\r\nas the night was too dark for one to aim to such a distance as that\r\nalready between the castle and the boat, the ball ricochetted at twenty\r\npaces from the fugitives, while the report died away in echo after echo.\r\nThen Douglas drew his pistol from his belt, and, warning the ladies to\r\nhave no fear, he fired in the air, not to answer by idle bravado the\r\ncastle cannonade, but to give notice to a troop of faithful friends, who\r\nwere waiting for them on the other shore of the lake, that the queen had\r\nescaped. Immediately, in spite of the danger of being so near Kinross,\r\ncries of joy resounded on the bank, and William having turned the\r\nrudder, the boat made for land at the spot whence they had been heard.\r\nDouglas then gave his hand to the queen, who sprang lightly ashore, and\r\nwho, falling on her knees, immediately began to give thanks to God for\r\nher happy deliverance.\r\n\r\nOn rising, the queen found herself surrounded by her most faithful\r\nservants—Hamilton, Herries, and Seyton, Mary’s father. Light-headed with\r\njoy, the queen extended her hands to them, thanking them with broken\r\nwords, which expressed her intoxication and her gratitude better than\r\nthe choicest phrases could have done, when suddenly, turning round, she\r\nperceived George Douglas, alone and melancholy. Then, going to him and\r\ntaking him by the hand—\r\n\r\n\"My lords,\" said she, presenting George to them, and pointing to\r\nWilliam, \"behold my two deliverers: behold those to whom, as long as I\r\nlive, I shall preserve gratitude of which nothing will ever acquit me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" said Douglas, \"each of us has only done what he ought, and he\r\nwho has risked most is the happiest. But if your Majesty will believe\r\nme, you will not lose a moment in needless words.\"\r\n\r\n\"Douglas is right,\" said Lord Seyton. \"To horse! to horse!\"\r\n\r\nImmediately, and while four couriers set out in four different\r\ndirections to announce to the queen’s friends her happy escape, they\r\nbrought her a horse saddled for her, which she mounted with her usual\r\nskill; then the little troop, which, composed of about twenty persons,\r\nwas escorting the future destiny of Scotland, keeping away from the\r\nvillage of Kinross, to which the castle firing had doubtless given the\r\nalarm, took at a gallop the road to Seyton’s castle, where was already a\r\ngarrison large enough to defend the queen from a sudden attack.\r\n\r\nThe queen journeyed all night, accompanied on one side by Douglas, on\r\nthe other by Lord Seyton; then, at daybreak, they stopped at the gate of\r\nthe castle of West Niddrie, belonging to Lord Seyton, as we have said,\r\nand situated in West Lothian. Douglas sprang from his horse to offer his\r\nhand to Mary Stuart; but Lord Seyton claimed his privilege as master of\r\nthe house. The queen consoled Douglas with a glance, and entered the\r\nfortress.\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" said Lord Seyton, leading her into a room prepared for her for\r\nnine months, \"your Majesty must have need of repose, after the fatigue\r\nand the emotions you have gone through since yesterday morning; you may\r\nsleep here in peace, and disquiet yourself for nothing: any noise you\r\nmay hear will be made by a reinforcement of friends which we are\r\nexpecting. As to our enemies, your Majesty has nothing to fear from them\r\nso long as you inhabit the castle of a Seyton.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen again thanked all her deliverers, gave her hand to Douglas to\r\nkiss one last time, kissed Little William on the forehead, and named him\r\nher favourite page for the future; then, profiting by the advice given\r\nher, entered her room where Mary Seyton, to the exclusion of every other\r\nwoman, claimed the privilege of performing about her the duties with\r\nwhich she had been charged during their eleven months’ captivity in\r\nLochleven Castle.\r\n\r\nOn opening her eyes, Mary Stuart thought she had had one of those dreams\r\nso gainful to prisoners, when waking they see again the bolts on their\r\ndoors and the bars on their windows. So the queen, unable to believe the\r\nevidence of her senses, ran, half dressed, to the window. The courtyard\r\nwas filled with soldiers, and these soldiers all friends who had\r\nhastened at the news of her escape; she recognised the banners of her\r\nfaithful friends, the Seytons, the Arbroaths, the Herries, and the\r\nHamiltons, and scarcely had she been seen at the window than all these\r\nbanners bent before her, with the shouts a hundred times repeated of\r\n\"Long live Mary of Scotland! Long live our queen!\" Then, without giving\r\nheed to the disarray of her toilet, lovely and chaste with her emotion\r\nand her happiness, she greeted them in her turn, her eyes full of tears;\r\nbut this time they were tears of joy. However, the queen recollected\r\nthat she was barely covered, and blushing at having allowed herself to\r\nbe thus carried away in her ecstasy, she abruptly drew back, quite rosy\r\nwith confusion.\r\n\r\nThen she had an instant’s womanly fright: she had fled from Lochleven\r\nCastle in the Douglas livery, and without either the leisure or the\r\nopportunity for taking women’s clothes with her. But she could not\r\nremain attired as a man; so she explained her uneasiness to Mary Seyton,\r\nwho responded by opening the closets in the queen’s room. They were\r\nfurnished, not only with robes, the measure for which, like that of the\r\nsuit, had been taken from Mary Fleming, but also with all the\r\nnecessaries for a woman’s toilet. The queen was astonished: it was like\r\nbeing in a fairy castle.\r\n\r\n\"Mignonne,\" said she, looking one after another at the robes, all the\r\nstuffs of which were chosen with exquisite taste, \"I knew your father\r\nwas a brave and loyal knight, but I did not think him so learned in the\r\nmatter of the toilet. We shall name him groom of the wardrobe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! madam,\" smilingly replied Mary Seyton, \"you are not mistaken: my\r\nfather has had everything in the castle furbished up to the last\r\ncorselet, sharpened to the last sword, unfurled to the last banner; but\r\nmy father, ready as he is to die for your Majesty, would not have\r\ndreamed for an instant of offering you anything but his roof to rest\r\nunder, or his cloak to cover you. It is Douglas again who has foreseen\r\neverything, prepared everything—everything even to Rosabelle, your\r\nMajesty’s favourite steed, which is impatiently awaiting in the stable\r\nthe moment when, mounted on her, your Majesty will make your triumphal\r\nre-entry into Edinburgh.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how has he been able to get her back again?\" Mary asked. \"I thought\r\nthat in the division of my spoils Rosabelle had fallen to the fair\r\nAlice, my brother’s favourite sultana?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Mary Seyton, \"it was so; and as her value was known,\r\nshe was kept under lock and key by an army of grooms; but Douglas is the\r\nman of miracles, and, as I have told you, Rosabelle awaits your\r\nMajesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Noble Douglas!\" murmured the queen, with eyes full of tears; then, as\r\nif speaking to herself, \"And this is precisely one of those devotions\r\nthat we can never repay. The others will be happy with honours, places,\r\nmoney; but to Douglas what matter all these things?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, madam, come,\" said Mary Seyton, \"God takes on Himself the debts\r\nof kings; He will reward Douglas. As to your Majesty, reflect that they\r\nare waiting dinner for you. I hope,\" added she, smiling, \"that you will\r\nnot affront my father as you did Lord Douglas yesterday in refusing to\r\npartake of his feast on his fortunate home-coming.\"\r\n\r\n\"And luck has come to me for it, I hope,\" replied Mary. \"But you are\r\nright, darling: no more sad thoughts; we will consider when we have\r\nindeed become queen again what we can do for Douglas.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen dressed and went down. As Mary Seyton had told her, the chief\r\nnoblemen of her party, already gathered round her, were waiting for her\r\nin the great hall of the castle. Her arrival was greeted with\r\nacclamations of the liveliest enthusiasm, and she sat down to table,\r\nwith Lord Seyton on her right hand, Douglas on her left, and behind her\r\nLittle William, who the same day was beginning his duties as page.\r\n\r\nNext morning the queen was awakened by the sound of trumpets and bugles:\r\nit had been decided the day before that she should set out that day for\r\nHamilton, where reinforcements were looked for. The queen donned an\r\nelegant riding-habit, and soon, mounted on Rosabelle, appeared amid her\r\ndefenders. The shouts of joy redoubled: her beauty, her grace, and her\r\ncourage were admired by everyone. Mary Stuart became her own self once\r\nmore, and she felt spring up in her again the power of fascination she\r\nhad always exercised on those who came near her. Everyone was in good\r\nhumour, and the happiest of all was perhaps Little William, who for the\r\nfirst time in his life had such a fine dress and such a fine horse.\r\n\r\nTwo or three thousand men were awaiting the queen at Hamilton, which she\r\nreached the same evening; and during the night following her arrival the\r\ntroops increased to six thousand. The 2nd of May she was a prisoner,\r\nwithout another friend but a child in her prison, without other means of\r\ncommunication with her adherents than the flickering and uncertain light\r\nof a lamp, and three days afterwards—that is to say, between the Sunday\r\nand the Wednesday—she found herself not only free, but also at the head\r\nof a powerful confederacy, which counted at its head nine earls, eight\r\npeers, nine bishops, and a number of barons and nobles renowned among\r\nthe bravest of Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe advice of the most judicious among those about the queen was to shut\r\nherself up in the strong castle of Dumbarton, which, being impregnable,\r\nwould give all her adherents time to assemble together, distant and\r\nscattered as they were: accordingly, the guidance of the troops who were\r\nto conduct the queen to that town was entrusted to the Earl of Argyll,\r\nand the 11th of May she took the road with an army of nearly ten\r\nthousand men.\r\n\r\nMurray was at Glasgow when he heard of the queen’s escape: the place was\r\nstrong; he decided to hold it, and summoned to him his bravest and most\r\ndevoted partisans. Kirkcaldy of Grange, Morton, Lindsay of Byres, Lord\r\nLochleven, and William Douglas hastened to him, and six thousand of the\r\nbest troops in the kingdom gathered round them, while Lord Ruthven in\r\nthe counties of Berwick and Angus raised levies with which to join them.\r\n\r\nThe 13th May, Morton occupied from daybreak the village of Langside,\r\nthrough which the queen must pass to get to Dumbarton. The news of the\r\noccupation reached the queen as the two armies were yet seven miles\r\napart. Mary’s first instinct was to escape an engagement: she remembered\r\nher last battle at Carberry Hill, at the end of which she had been\r\nseparated from Bothwell and brought to Edinburgh; so she expressed aloud\r\nthis opinion, which was supported by George Douglas, who, in black\r\narmour, without other arms, had continued at the queen’s side.\r\n\r\n\"Avoid an engagement!\" cried Lord Seyton, not daring to answer his\r\nsovereign, and replying to George as if this opinion had originated with\r\nhim. \"We could do it, perhaps, if we were one to ten; but we shall\r\ncertainly not do so when we are three to two. You speak a strange\r\ntongue, my young master,\" continued he, with some contempt; \"and you\r\nforget, it seems to me, that you are a Douglas and that you speak to a\r\nSeyton.\"\r\n\r\n\"My lord,\" returned George calmly, \"when we only hazard the lives of\r\nDouglases and Seytons, you will find me, I hope, as ready to fight as\r\nyou, be it one to ten, be it three to two; but we are now answerable for\r\nan existence dearer to Scotland than that of all the Seytons and all the\r\nDouglases. My advice is then to avoid battle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Battle! battle!\" cried all the chieftains.\r\n\r\n\"You hear, madam?\" said Lord Seyton to Mary Stuart: \"I believe that to\r\nwish to act against such unanimity would be dangerous. In Scotland,\r\nmadam, there is an ancient proverb which has it that ’there is most\r\nprudence in courage.’\"\r\n\r\n\"But have you not heard that the regent has taken up an advantageous\r\nposition?\" the queen said.\r\n\r\n\"The greyhound hunts the hare on the hillside as well as in the plain,\"\r\nreplied Seyton: \"we will drive him out, wherever he is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let it be as you desire, then, my lords. It shall not be said that Mary\r\nStuart returned to the scabbard the sword her defenders had drawn for\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\nThen, turning round to Douglas\r\n\r\n\"George,\" she said to him, \"choose a guard of twenty men for me, and\r\ntake command of them: you will not quit me.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge bent low in obedience, chose twenty from among the bravest men,\r\nplaced the queen in their midst, and put himself at their head; then the\r\ntroops, which had halted, received the order to continue their road. In\r\ntwo hours’ time the advance guard was in sight of the enemy; it halted,\r\nand the rest of the army rejoined it.\r\n\r\nThe queen’s troops then found themselves parallel with the city of\r\nGlasgow, and the heights which rose in front of them were already\r\noccupied by a force above which floated, as above that of Mary, the\r\nroyal banners of Scotland, On the other side, and on the opposite slope,\r\nstretched the village of Langside, encircled with enclosures and\r\ngardens. The road which led to it, and which followed all the variations\r\nof the ground, narrowed at one place in such a way that two men could\r\nhardly pass abreast, then, farther on, lost itself in a ravine, beyond\r\nwhich it reappeared, then branched into two, of which one climbed to the\r\nvillage of Langside, while the other led to Glasgow.\r\n\r\nOn seeing the lie of the ground, the Earl of Argyll immediately\r\ncomprehended the importance of occupying this village, and, turning to\r\nLord Seyton, he ordered him to gallop off and try to arrive there before\r\nthe enemy, who doubtless, having made the same observation as the\r\ncommander of the royal forces, was setting in motion at that very moment\r\na considerable body of cavalry.\r\n\r\nLord Seyton called up his men directly, but while he was ranging them\r\nround his banner, Lord Arbroath drew his sword, and approaching the Earl\r\nof Argyll—\r\n\r\n\"My lord,\" said he, \"you do me a wrong in charging Lord Seyton to seize\r\nthat post: as commander of the vanguard, it is to me this honour\r\nbelongs. Allow me, then, to use my privilege in claiming it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is I who received the order to seize it; I will seize it!\" cried\r\nSeyton.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" returned Lord Arbroath, \"but not before me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Before you and before every Hamilton in the world!\" exclaimed Seyton,\r\nputting his horse to the gallop and rushing down into the hollow road—\r\n\r\n\"Saint Bennet! and forward!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, my faithful kinsmen!\" cried Lord Arbroath, dashing forward on his\r\nside with the same object; \"come, my men-at-arms! For God and the\r\nqueen!\"\r\n\r\nThe two troops precipitated themselves immediately in disorder and ran\r\nagainst one another in the narrow way, where, as we have said, two men\r\ncould hardly pass abreast. There was a terrible collision there, and the\r\nconflict began among friends who should have been united against the\r\nenemy. Finally, the two troops, leaving behind them some corpses stifled\r\nin the press, or even killed by their companions, passed through the\r\ndefile pell-mell and were lost sight of in the ravine. But during this\r\nstruggle Seyton and Arbroath had lost precious time, and the detachment\r\nsent by Murray, which had taken the road by Glasgow, had reached the\r\nvillage beforehand; it was now necessary not to take it, but to retake\r\nit.\r\n\r\nArgyll saw that the whole day’s struggle would be concentrated there,\r\nand, understanding more and more the importance of the village,\r\nimmediately put himself at the head of the body of his army, commanding\r\na rearguard of two thousand men to remain there and await further orders\r\nto take part in the fighting. But whether the captain who commanded them\r\nhad ill understood, or whether he was eager to distinguish himself in\r\nthe eyes of the queen, scarcely had Argyll vanished into the ravine, at\r\nthe end of which the struggle had already commenced between Kirkcaldy of\r\nGrange and Morton on the one side, and on the other between Arbroath and\r\nSeyton, than, without regarding the cries of Mary Stuart, he set off in\r\nhis turn at a gallop, leaving the queen without other guard than the\r\nlittle escort of twenty men which Douglas had chosen for her. Douglas\r\nsighed.\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" said the queen, hearing him, \"I am not a soldier, but there it\r\nseems to me is a battle very badly begun.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is to be done?\" replied Douglas. \"We are every one of us\r\ninfatuated, from first to last, and all these men are behaving to-day\r\nlike madmen or children.\"\r\n\r\n\"Victory! victory!\" said the queen; \"the enemy is retreating, fighting.\r\nI see the banners of Seyton and Arbroath floating near the first houses\r\nin the village. Oh! my brave lords,\" cried she, clapping her hands.\r\n\"Victory! victory!\"\r\n\r\nBut she stopped suddenly on perceiving a body of the enemy’s army\r\nadvancing to charge the victors in flank.\r\n\r\n\"It is nothing, it is nothing,\" said Douglas; \"so long as there is only\r\ncavalry we have nothing much to fear, and besides the Earl of Argyll\r\nwill fall in in time to aid them.\"\r\n\r\n\"George,\" said Little William.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" asked Douglas.\r\n\r\n\"Don’t you see?\" the child went on, stretching out his arms towards the\r\nenemy’s force, which was coming on at a gallop.\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Each horseman carries a footman armed with an arquebuse behind him, so\r\nthat the troop is twice as numerous as it appears.\"\r\n\r\n\"That’s true; upon my soul, the child has good sight. Let someone go at\r\nonce full gallop and take news of this to the Earl or Argyll.\"\r\n\r\n\"I! I!\" cried Little William. \"I saw them first; it is my right to bear\r\nthe tidings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go, then, my child,\" said Douglas; \"and may God preserve thee!\"\r\n\r\nThe child flew, quick as lightning, not hearing or feigning not to hear\r\nthe queen, who was recalling him. He was seen to cross the gorge and\r\nplunge into the hollow road at the moment when Argyll was debouching at\r\nthe end and coming to the aid of Seyton and Arbroath. Meanwhile, the\r\nenemy’s detachment had dismounted its infantry, which, immediately\r\nformed up, was scattering on the sides of the ravine by paths\r\nimpracticable for horses.\r\n\r\n\"William will come too late!\" cried Douglas, \"or even, should he arrive\r\nin time, the news is now useless to them. Oh madmen, madmen that we are!\r\nThis is how we have always lost all our battles!\"\r\n\r\n\"Is the battle lost, then?\" demanded Mary, growing pale.\r\n\r\n\"No, madam, no,\" cried Douglas; \"Heaven be thanked, not yet; but through\r\ntoo great haste we have begun badly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And William?\" said Mary Stuart.\r\n\r\n\"He is now serving his apprenticeship in arms; for, if I am not\r\nmistaken, he must be at this moment at the very spot where those\r\nmarksmen are making such quick firing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor child!\" cried the queen; \"if ill should befall him, I shall never\r\nconsole myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! madam,\" replied Douglas, \"I greatly fear that his first battle is\r\nhis last, and that everything is already over for him; for, unless I\r\nmistake, there is his horse returning riderless.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my God! my God!\" said the queen, weeping, and raising her hands to\r\nheaven, \"it is then decreed that I should be fatal to all around me!\"\r\n\r\nGeorge was not deceived: it was William’s horse coming back without his\r\nyoung master and covered with blood.\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" said Douglas, \"we are ill placed here; let us gain that hillock\r\non which is the Castle of Crookstone: from thence we shall survey the\r\nwhole battlefield.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not there! not there!\" said the queen in terror: \"within that\r\ncastle I came to spend the first days of my marriage with Darnley; it\r\nwill bring me misfortune.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, beneath that yew-tree, then,\" said George, pointing to another\r\nslight rise near the first; \"but it is important for us to lose no\r\ndetail of this engagement. Everything depends perhaps for your Majesty\r\non an ill-judged manoeuvre or a lost moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Guide me, then,\" the queen said; \"for, as for me, I no longer see it.\r\nEach report of that terrible cannonade echoes to the depths of my\r\nheart.\"\r\n\r\nHowever well placed as was this eminence for overlooking from its summit\r\nthe whole battlefield, the reiterated discharge of cannon and musketry\r\ncovered it with such a cloud of smoke that it was impossible to make out\r\nfrom it anything but masses lost amid a murderous fog. At last, when an\r\nhour had passed in this desperate conflict, through the skirts of this\r\nsea of smoke the fugitives were seen to emerge and disperse in all\r\ndirections, followed by the victors. Only, at that distance, it was\r\nimpossible to make out who had gained or lost the battle, and the\r\nbanners, which on both sides displayed the Scottish arms, could in no\r\nway clear up this confusion.\r\n\r\nAt that moment there was seen coming down from the Glasgow hillsides all\r\nthe remaining reserve of Murray’s army; it was coming at full speed to\r\nengage in the fighting; but this manoeuvre might equally well have for\r\nits object the support of defeated friends as to complete the rout of\r\nthe enemy. However, soon there was no longer any doubt; for this reserve\r\ncharged the fugitives, amid whom it spread fresh confusion. The queen’s\r\narmy was beaten. At the same time, three or four horsemen appeared on\r\nthe hither side of the ravine, advancing at a gallop. Douglas recognised\r\nthem as enemies.\r\n\r\n\"Fly, madam,\" cried George, \"fly without loss of a second; for those who\r\nare coming upon us are followed by others. Gain the road, while I go to\r\ncheck them. And you,\" added he, addressing the escort, \"be killed to the\r\nlast man rather than let them take your queen.\"\r\n\r\n\"George! George!\" cried the queen, motionless, and as if riveted to the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nBut George had already dashed away with all his horse’s speed, and as he\r\nwas splendidly mounted, he flew across the space with lightning\r\nrapidity, and reached the gorge before the enemy. There he stopped, put\r\nhis lance in rest, and alone against five bravely awaited the encounter.\r\n\r\nAs to the queen, she had no desire to go; but, on the contrary, as if\r\nturned to stone, she remained in the same place, her eyes fastened on\r\nthis combat which was taking place at scarcely five hundred paces from\r\nher. Suddenly, glancing at her enemies, she saw that one of them bore in\r\nthe middle of his shield a bleeding heart, the Douglas arms. Then she\r\nuttered a cry of pain, and drooping her head—\r\n\r\n\"Douglas against Douglas; brother against brother!\" she murmured: \"it\r\nonly wanted this last blow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam, madam,\" cried her escort, \"there is not an instant to lose: the\r\nyoung master of Douglas cannot hold out long thus alone against five;\r\nlet us fly! let us fly!\" And two of them taking the queen’s horse by the\r\nbridle, put it to the gallop, at the moment when George, after having\r\nbeaten down two of his enemies and wounded a third, was thrown down in\r\nhis turn in the dust, thrust to the heart by a lance-head. The queen\r\ngroaned on seeing him fall; then, as if he alone had detained her, and\r\nas if he being killed she had no interest in anything else, she put\r\nRosabelle to the gallop, and as she and her troop were splendidly\r\nmounted, they had soon lost sight of the battlefield.\r\n\r\nShe fled thus for sixty miles, without taking any rest, and without\r\nceasing to weep or to sigh: at last, having traversed the counties of\r\nRenfrew and Ayr, she reached the Abbey of Dundrennan, in Galloway, and\r\ncertain of being, for the time at least, sheltered from every danger,\r\nshe gave the order to stop. The prior respectfully received her at the\r\ngate of the convent.\r\n\r\n\"I bring you misfortune and ruin, father,\" said the queen, alighting\r\nfrom her horse.\r\n\r\n\"They are welcome,\" replied the prior, \"since they come accompanied by\r\nduty.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen gave Rosabelle to the care of one of the men-at-arms who had\r\naccompanied her, and leaning on Mary Seyton, who had not left her for a\r\nmoment, and on Lord Herries, who had rejoined her on the road, she\r\nentered the convent.\r\n\r\nLord Herries had not concealed her position from Mary Stuart: the day\r\nhad been completely lost, and with the day, at least for the present,\r\nall hope of reascending the throne of Scotland. There remained but three\r\ncourses for the queen to take to withdraw into France, Spain or England.\r\nOn the advice of Lord Herries, which accorded with her own feeling, she\r\ndecided upon the last; and that same night she wrote this double missive\r\nin verse and in prose to Elizabeth:\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SISTER,—I have often enough begged you to receive my\r\ntempest-tossed vessel into your haven during the storm. If at this pass\r\nshe finds a safe harbour there, I shall cast anchor there for ever:\r\notherwise the bark is in God’s keeping, for she is ready and caulked for\r\ndefence on her voyage against all storms. I have dealt openly with you,\r\nand still do so: do not take it in bad part if I write thus; it is not\r\nin defiance of you, as it appears, for in everything I rely on your\r\nfriendship.\"\r\n\r\n\"This sonnet accompanied the letter:—\r\n\r\n\"One thought alone brings danger and delight; Bitter and sweet change\r\nplaces in my heart, With doubt, and then with hope, it takes its part,\r\nTill peace and rest alike are put to flight.\r\n\r\nTherefore, dear sister, if this card pursue That keen desire by which I\r\nam oppressed, To see you, ’tis because I live distressed, Unless some\r\nswift and sweet result ensue.\r\n\r\nBeheld I have my ship compelled by fate To seek the open sea, when close\r\nto port, And calmest days break into storm and gale; Wherefore full\r\ngrieved and fearful is my state, Not for your sake, but since, in evil\r\nsort, Fortune so oft snaps strongest rope and sail.\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth trembled with joy at receiving this double letter; for the\r\neight years that her enmity had been daily increasing to Mary Stuart,\r\nshe had followed her with her eyes continually, as a wolf might a\r\ngazelle; at last the gazelle sought refuge in the wolf’s den. Elizabeth\r\nhad never hoped as much: she immediately despatched an order to the\r\nSheriff of Cumberland to make known to Mary that she was ready to\r\nreceive her. One morning a bugle was heard blowing on the sea-shore: it\r\nwas Queen Elizabeth’s envoy come to fetch Queen Mary Stuart.\r\n\r\nThen arose great entreaties to the fugitive not to trust herself thus to\r\na rival in power, glory, and beauty; but the poor dispossessed queen was\r\nfull of confidence in her she called her good sister, and believed\r\nherself going, free and rid of care, to take at Elizabeth’s court the\r\nplace due to her rank and her misfortunes: thus she persisted, in spite\r\nof all that could be said. In our time, we have seen the same\r\ninfatuation seize another royal fugitive, who like Mary Stuart confided\r\nhimself to the generosity of his enemy England: like Mary Stuart, he was\r\ncruelly punished for his confidence, and found in the deadly climate of\r\nSt. Helena the scaffold of Fotheringay.\r\n\r\nMary Stuart set out on her journey, then, with her little following.\r\nArrived at the shore of Solway Firth, she found there the Warden of the\r\nEnglish Marches: he was a gentleman named Lowther, who received the\r\nqueen with the greatest respect, but who gave her to understand that he\r\ncould not permit more than three of her women to accompany her. Mary\r\nSeyton immediately claimed her privilege: the queen held out to her her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\"Alas! mignonne,\" said she, \"but it might well be another’s turn: you\r\nhave already suffered enough for me and with me.\"\r\n\r\nBut Mary, unable to reply, clung to her hand, making a sign with her\r\nhead that nothing in the world should part her from her mistress. Then\r\nall who had accompanied the queen renewed their entreaties that she\r\nshould not persist in this fatal resolve, and when she was already a\r\nthird of the way along the plank placed for her to enter the skiff, the\r\nPrior of Dundrennan, who had offered Mary Stuart such dangerous and\r\ntouching hospitality, entered the water up to his knees, to try to\r\ndetain her; but all was useless: the queen had made up her mind.\r\n\r\nAt that, moment Lowther approached her. \"Madam,\" said he, \"accept anew\r\nmy regrets that I cannot offer a warm welcome in England to all who\r\nwould wish to follow you there; but our queen has given us positive\r\norders, and we must carry them out. May I be permitted to remind your\r\nMajesty that the tide serves?\"\r\n\r\n\"Positive orders!\" cried the prior. \"Do you hear, madam? Oh! you are\r\nlost if you quit this shore! Back, while there is yet time! Back; madam,\r\nin Heaven’s name! To me, sir knights, to me!\" he cried, turning to Lord\r\nHerries and the other lords who had accompanied Mary Stuart; \"do not\r\nallow your queen to abandon you, were it needful to struggle with her\r\nand the English at the same time. Hold her back, my lords, in Heaven’s\r\nname! withhold her!\"\r\n\r\n\"What means this violence, sir priest?\" said the Warden of the Marches.\r\n\"I came here at your queen’s express command; she is free to return to\r\nyou, and there is no need to have recourse to force for that\". Then,\r\naddressing the queen—\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" said he, \"do you consent to follow me into England in full\r\nliberty of choice? Answer, I entreat you; for my honour demands that the\r\nwhole world should be aware that you have followed me freely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" replied Mary Stuart, \"I ask your pardon, in the name of this\r\nworthy servant of God and his queen, for what he may have said of\r\noffence to you. Freely I leave Scotland and place myself in your hands,\r\ntrusting that I shall be free either to remain in England with my royal\r\nsister, or to return to France to my worthy relatives\". Then, turning to\r\nthe priest, \"Your blessing, father, and God protect you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! alas!\" murmured the abbot, obeying the queen, \"it is not we who\r\nare in need of God’s protection, but rather you, my daughter. May the\r\nblessing of a poor priest turn aside from you the misfortunes I foresee!\r\nGo, and may it be with you as the Lord has ordained in His wisdom and in\r\nHis mercy!\"\r\n\r\nThen the queen gave her hand to the sheriff, who conducted her to the\r\nskiff, followed by Mary Seyton and two other women only. The sails were\r\nimmediately unfurled, and the little vessel began to recede from the\r\nshores of Galloway, to make her way towards those of Cumberland. So long\r\nas it could be seen, they who had accompanied the queen lingered on the\r\nbeach, waving her signs of adieu, which, standing on the deck of the\r\nshallop which was bearing her, away, she returned with her handkerchief.\r\nFinally, the boat disappeared, and all burst into lamentations or into\r\nsobbing. They were right, for the good Prior of Dundrennan’s\r\npresentiments were only too true, and they had seen Mary Stuart for the\r\nlast time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nOn landing on the shores of England, the Queen of Scotland found\r\nmessengers from Elizabeth empowered to express to her all the regret\r\ntheir mistress felt in being unable to admit her to her presence, or to\r\ngive her the affectionate welcome she bore her in her heart. But it was\r\nessential, they added, that first of all the queen should clear herself\r\nof the death of Darnley, whose family, being subjects of the Queen of\r\nEngland, had a right to her protection and justice.\r\n\r\nMary Stuart was so blinded that she did not see the trap, and\r\nimmediately offered to prove her innocence to the satisfaction of her\r\nsister Elizabeth; but scarcely had she in her hands Mary Stuart’s\r\nletter, than from arbitress she became judge, and, naming commissioners\r\nto hear the parties, summoned Murray to appear and accuse his sister.\r\nMurray, who knew Elizabeth’s secret intentions with regard to her rival,\r\ndid not hesitate a moment. He came to England, bringing the casket\r\ncontaining the three letters we have quoted, some verses and some other\r\npapers which proved that the queen had not only been Bothwell’s mistress\r\nduring the lifetime of Darnley, but had also been aware of the\r\nassassination of her husband. On their side, Lord Herries and the Bishop\r\nof Ross, the queen’s advocates, maintained that these letters had been\r\nforged, that the handwriting was counterfeited, and demanded, in\r\nverification, experts whom they could not obtain; so that this great\r\ncontroversy, remained pending for future ages, and to this hour nothing\r\nis yet affirmatively settled in this matter either by scholars or\r\nhistorians.\r\n\r\nAfter a five months’ inquiry, the Queen of England made known to the\r\nparties, that not having, in these proceedings, been able to discover\r\nanything to the dishonour of accuser or accused, everything would remain\r\nin statu quo till one or the other could bring forward fresh proofs.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this strange decision, Elizabeth should have sent back\r\nthe regent to Scotland, and have left Mary Stuart free to go where she\r\nwould. But, instead of that, she had her prisoner removed from Bolton\r\nCastle to Carlisle Castle, from whose terrace, to crown her with grief,\r\npoor Mary Stuart saw the blue mountains of her own Scotland.\r\n\r\nHowever, among the judges named by Elizabeth to examine into Mary\r\nStuart’s conduct was Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk. Be it that he was\r\nconvinced of Mary’s innocence, be it that he was urged by the ambitious\r\nproject which since served as a ground for his prosecution, and which\r\nwas nothing else than to wed Mary Stuart, to affiance his daughter to\r\nthe young king, and to become regent of Scotland, he resolved to\r\nextricate her from her prison. Several members of the high nobility of\r\nEngland, among whom were the Earls of Westmoreland and Northumberland,\r\nentered into the plot and undertook to support it with all their\r\nforces. But their scheme had been communicated to the regent: he\r\ndenounced it to Elizabeth, who had Norfolk arrested. Warned in time,\r\nWestmoreland and Northumberland crossed the frontiers and took refuge in\r\nthe Scottish borders which were favourable to Queen Mary. The former\r\nreached Flanders, where he died in exile; the latter, given up to\r\nMurray, was sent to the castle of Lochleven, which guarded him more\r\nfaithfully than it had done its royal prisoner. As to Norfolk, he was\r\nbeheaded. As one sees, Mary Stuart’s star had lost none of its fatal\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the regent had returned to Edinburgh, enriched with presents\r\nfrom Elizabeth, and having gained, in fact, his case with her, since\r\nMary remained a prisoner. He employed himself immediately in dispersing\r\nthe remainder of her adherents, and had hardly shut the gates of\r\nLochleven Castle upon Westmoreland than, in the name of the young King\r\nJames VI, he pursued those who had upheld his mother’s cause, and among\r\nthem more particularly the Hamiltons, who since the affair of \"sweeping\r\nthe streets of Edinburgh,\" had been the mortal enemies of the Douglases\r\npersonally; six of the chief members of this family were condemned to\r\ndeath, and only obtained commutation of the penalty into an eternal\r\nexile on the entreaties of John Knox, at that time so powerful in\r\nScotland that Murray dared not refuse their pardon.\r\n\r\nOne of the amnestied was a certain Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh, a man of\r\nancient Scottish times, wild and vindictive as the nobles in the time of\r\nJames I. He had withdrawn into the highlands, where he had found an\r\nasylum, when he learned that Murray, who in virtue of the confiscation\r\npronounced against exiles had given his lands to one of his favourites,\r\nhad had the cruelty to expel his sick and bedridden wife from her own\r\nhouse, and that without giving her time to dress, and although it was in\r\nthe winter cold. The poor woman, besides, without shelter, without\r\nclothes, and without food, had gone out of her mind, had wandered about\r\nthus for some time, an object of compassion but equally of dread; for\r\neveryone had been afraid of compromising himself by assisting her. At\r\nlast, she had returned to expire of misery and cold on the threshold\r\nwhence she had been driven.\r\n\r\nOn learning this news, Bothwellhaugh, despite the violence of his\r\ncharacter, displayed no anger: he merely responded, with a terrible\r\nsmile, \"It is well; I shall avenge her.\"\r\n\r\nNext day, Bothwellhaugh left his highlands, and came down, disguised,\r\ninto the plain, furnished with an order of admission from the Archbishop\r\nof St. Andrews to a house which this prelate—who, as one remembers, had\r\nfollowed the queen’s fortunes to the last moment—had at Linlithgow. This\r\nhouse, situated in the main street, had a wooden balcony looking on to\r\nthe square, and a gate which opened out into the country. Bothwellhaugh\r\nentered it at night, installed himself on the first floor, hung black\r\ncloth on the walls so that his shadow should not be seen from without,\r\ncovered the floor with mattresses so that his footsteps might not be\r\nheard on the ground floor, fastened a racehorse ready saddled and\r\nbridled in the garden, hollowed out the upper part of the little gate\r\nwhich led to the open country so that he could pass through it at a\r\ngallop, armed himself with a loaded arquebuse, and shut himself up in\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nAll these preparations had been made, one imagines, because Murray was\r\nto spend the following day in Linlithgow. But, secret as they were, they\r\nwere to be rendered useless, for the regent’s friends warned him that it\r\nwould not be safe for him to pass through the town, which belonged\r\nalmost wholly to the Hamiltons, and advised him to go by it. However,\r\nMurray was courageous, and, accustomed not to give way before a real\r\ndanger, he did nothing but laugh at a peril which he looked upon as\r\nimaginary, and boldly followed his first plan, which was not to go out\r\nof his way. Consequently, as the street into which the Archbishop of St.\r\nAndrews’ balcony looked was on his road, he entered upon it, not going\r\nrapidly and preceded by guards who would open up a passage for him, as\r\nhis friends still counselled, but advancing at a foot’s pace, delayed as\r\nhe was by the great crowd which was blocking up the streets to see him.\r\nArrived in front of the balcony, as if chance had been in tune with the\r\nmurderer, the crush became so great that Murray was obliged to halt for\r\na moment: this rest gave Bothwellhaugh time to adjust himself for a\r\nsteady shot. He leaned his arquebuse on the balcony, and, having taken\r\naim with the necessary leisure and coolness, fired. Bothwellhaugh had\r\nput such a charge into the arquebuse, that the ball, having passed\r\nthrough the regent’s heart, killed the horse of a gentleman on his\r\nright. Murray fell directly, saying, \"My God! I am killed.\"\r\n\r\nAs they had seen from which window the shot was fired, the persons in\r\nthe regent’s train had immediately thrown themselves against the great\r\ndoor of the house which looked on to the street, and had smashed it in;\r\nbut they only arrived in time to see Bothwellhaugh fly through the\r\nlittle garden gate on the horse he had got ready: they immediately\r\nremounted the horses they had left in the street, and, passing through\r\nthe house, pursued him. Bothwellhaugh had a good horse and the lead of\r\nhis enemies; and yet, four of them, pistol in hand, were so well mounted\r\nthat they were beginning to gain upon him. Then Bothwellhaugh; seeing\r\nthat whip and spur were not enough, drew his dagger and used it to goad\r\non his horse. His horse, under this terrible stimulus, acquired fresh\r\nvigour, and, leaping a gully eighteen feet deep, put between his master\r\nand his pursuers a barrier which they dared not cross.\r\n\r\nThe murderer sought an asylum in France, where he retired under the\r\nprotection of the Guises. There, as the bold stroke he had attempted had\r\nacquired him a great reputation, some days before the Massacre of St.\r\nBartholomew, they made him overtures to assassinate Admiral Coligny. But\r\nBothwellhaugh indignantly repulsed these proposals, saying that he was\r\nthe avenger of abuses and not an assassin, and that those who had to\r\ncomplain of the admiral had only to come and ask him how he had done,\r\nand to do as he.\r\n\r\nAs to Murray, he died the night following his wound, leaving the regency\r\nto the Earl of Lennox, the father of Darnley: on learning the news of\r\nhis death, Elizabeth wrote that she had lost her best friend.\r\n\r\nWhile these events were passing in Scotland, Mary Stuart was still a\r\nprisoner, in spite of the pressing and successive protests of Charles IX\r\nand Henry III. Taking fright at the attempt made in her favour,\r\nElizabeth even had her removed to Sheffield Castle, round which fresh\r\npatrols were incessantly in motion.\r\n\r\nBut days, months, years passed, and poor Mary, who had borne so\r\nimpatiently her eleven months’ captivity in Lochleven Castle, had been\r\nalready led from prison to prison for fifteen or sixteen years, in spite\r\nof her protests and those of the French and Spanish ambassadors, when\r\nshe was finally taken to Tutbury Castle and placed under the care of Sir\r\nAmyas Paulet, her last gaoler: there she found for her sole lodging two\r\nlow and damp rooms, where little by little what strength remained to her\r\nwas so exhausted that there were days on which she could not walk, on\r\naccount of the pain in all her limbs. Then it was that she who had been\r\nthe queen of two kingdoms, who was born in a gilded cradle and brought\r\nup in silk and velvet, was forced to humble herself to ask of her gaoler\r\na softer bed and warmer coverings. This request, treated as an affair of\r\nstate, gave rise to negotiations which lasted a month, after which the\r\nprisoner was at length granted what she asked. And yet the\r\nunhealthiness, cold, and privations of all kinds still did not work\r\nactively enough on that healthy and robust organisation. They tried to\r\nconvey to Paulet what a service he would render the Queen of England in\r\ncutting short the existence of her who, already condemned in her rival’s\r\nmind, yet delayed to die. But Sir Amyas Paulet, coarse and harsh as he\r\nwas to Mary Stuart, declared that, so long as she was with him she would\r\nhave nothing to fear from poison or dagger, because he would taste all\r\nthe dishes served to his prisoner, and that no one should approach her\r\nbut in his presence. In fact, some assassins, sent by Leicester, the\r\nvery same who had aspired for a moment to the hand of the lovely Mary\r\nStuart, were driven from the castle directly its stern keeper had\r\nlearned with what intentions they had entered it. Elizabeth had to be\r\npatient, then, in contenting herself with tormenting her whom she could\r\nnot kill, and still hoping that a fresh opportunity would occur for\r\nbringing her to trial. That opportunity, so long delayed, the fatal star\r\nof Mary Stuart at length brought.\r\n\r\nA young Catholic gentleman, a last scion of that ancient chivalry which\r\nwas already dying out at that time, excited by the excommunication of\r\nPius V, which pronounced Elizabeth fallen from her kingdom on earth and\r\nher salvation in heaven, resolved to restore liberty to Mary, who\r\nthenceforth was beginning to be looked upon, no longer as a political\r\nprisoner, but as a martyr for her faith. Accordingly, braving the law\r\nwhich Elizabeth had had made in 1585, and which provided that, if any\r\nattempt on her person was meditated by, or for, a person who thought he\r\nhad claims to the crown of England, a commission would be appointed\r\ncomposed of twenty-five members, which, to the exclusion of every other\r\ntribunal, would be empowered to examine into the offence, and to condemn\r\nthe guilty persons, whosoever they might be. Babington, not at all\r\ndiscouraged by the example of his predecessors, assembled five of his\r\nfriends, Catholics as zealous as himself, who engaged their life and\r\nhonour in the plot of which he was the head, and which had as its aim to\r\nassassinate Elizabeth, and as a result to place Mary Stuart on the\r\nEnglish throne. But this scheme, well planned as it was, was revealed to\r\nWalsingham, who allowed the conspirators to go as far as he thought he\r\ncould without danger, and who, the day before that fixed for the\r\nassassination, had them arrested.\r\n\r\nThis imprudent and desperate attempt delighted Elizabeth, for, according\r\nto the letter of the law, it finally gave her rival’s life into her\r\nhands. Orders were immediately given to Sir Amyas Paulet to seize the\r\nprisoner’s papers and to move her to Fotheringay Castle. The gaoler,\r\nthen, hypocritically relaxing his usual severity, suggested to Mary\r\nStuart that she should go riding, under the pretext that she had need of\r\nan airing. The poor prisoner, who for three years had only seen the\r\ncountry through her prison bars, joyfully accepted, and left Tutbury\r\nbetween two guards, mounted, for greater security, on a horse whose feet\r\nwere hobbled. These two guards took her to Fotheringay Castle, her new\r\nhabitation, where she found the apartment she was to lodge in already\r\nhung in black. Mary Stuart had entered alive into her tomb. As to\r\nBabington and his accomplices, they had been already beheaded.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, her two secretaries, Curle and Nau, were arrested, and all\r\nher papers were seized and sent to Elizabeth, who, on her part, ordered\r\nthe forty commissioners to assemble, and proceed without intermission to\r\nthe trial of the prisoner. They arrived at Fotheringay the 14th October\r\n1586; and next day, being assembled in the great hall of the castle,\r\nthey began the examination.\r\n\r\nAt first Mary refused to appear before them, declaring that she did not\r\nrecognise the commissioners as judges, they not being her peers, and not\r\nacknowledging the English law, which had never afforded her protection,\r\nand which had constantly abandoned her to the rule of force. But seeing\r\nthat they proceeded none the less, and that every calumny was allowed,\r\nno one being there to refute it, she resolved to appear before the\r\ncommissioners. We quote the two interrogatories to which Mary Stuart\r\nsubmitted as they are set down in the report of M. de Bellievre to M. de\r\nVilleroy. M. de Bellievre, as we shall see later, had been specially\r\nsent by King Henry III to Elizabeth. [Intelligence for M. Villeroy of\r\nwhat was done in England by M. de Bellievre about the affairs of the\r\nQueen of Scotland, in the months of November and December 1586 and\r\nJanuary 1587.]\r\n\r\nThe said lady being seated at the end of the table in the said hall, and\r\nthe said commissioners about her—\r\n\r\nThe Queen of Scotland began to speak in these terms:\r\n\r\n\"I do not admit that any one of you here assembled is my peer or my\r\njudge to examine me upon any charge. Thus what I do, and now tell you,\r\nis of my own free will, taking God to witness that I am innocent and\r\npure in conscience of the accusations and slanders of which they wish to\r\naccuse me. For I am a free princess and born a queen, obedient to no\r\none, save to God, to whom alone I must give an account of my actions.\r\nThis is why I protest yet again that my appearance before you be not\r\nprejudicial either to me, or to the kings, princes and potentates, my\r\nallies, nor to my son, and I require that my protest be registered, and\r\nI demand the record of it.\"\r\n\r\nThen the chancellor, who was one of the commissioners, replied in his\r\nturn, and protested against the protestation; then he ordered that there\r\nshould be read over to the Queen of Scotland the commission in virtue of\r\nwhich they were proceeding—a commission founded on the statutes and law\r\nof the kingdom.\r\n\r\nBut to this Mary Stuart made answer that she again protested; that the\r\nsaid statutes and laws were without force against her, because these\r\nstatutes and laws are not made for persons of her condition.\r\n\r\nTo this the chancellor replied that the commission intended to proceed\r\nagainst her, even if she refused to answer, and declared that the trial\r\nshould proceed; for she was doubly subject to indictment, the\r\nconspirators having not only plotted in her favour, but also with her\r\nconsent: to which the said Queen of Scotland responded that she had\r\nnever even thought of it.\r\n\r\nUpon this, the letters it was alleged she had written to Babington and\r\nhis answers were read to her.\r\n\r\nMary Stuart then affirmed that she had never seen Babington, that she\r\nhad never had any conference with him, had never in her life received a\r\nsingle letter from him, and that she defied anyone in the world to\r\nmaintain that she had ever done anything to the prejudice of the said\r\nQueen of England; that besides, strictly guarded as she was, away from\r\nall news, withdrawn from and deprived of those nearest her, surrounded\r\nwith enemies, deprived finally of all advice, she had been unable to\r\nparticipate in or to consent to the practices of which she was accused;\r\nthat there are, besides, many persons who wrote to her what she had no\r\nknowledge of, and that she had received a number of letters without\r\nknowing whence they came to her.\r\n\r\nThen Babington’s confession was read to her; but she replied that she\r\ndid not know what was meant; that besides, if Babington and his\r\naccomplices had said such things, they were base men, false and liars.\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" added she, \"show me my handwriting and my signature, since\r\nyou say that I wrote to Babington, and not copies counterfeited like\r\nthese which you have filled at your leisure with the falsehoods it has\r\npleased you to insert.\"\r\n\r\nThen she was shown the letter that Babington, it was said, had written\r\nher. She glanced at it; then said, \"I have no knowledge of this letter\".\r\nUpon this, she was shown her reply, and she said again, \"I have no more\r\nknowledge of this answer. If you will show me my own letter and my own\r\nsignature containing what you say, I will acquiesce in all; but up to\r\nthe present, as I have already told you, you have produced nothing\r\nworthy of credence, unless it be the copies you have invented and added\r\nto with what seemed good to you.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, she rose, and with her eyes full of tears—\r\n\r\n\"If I have ever,\" said she, \"consented to such intrigues, having for\r\nobject my sister’s death, I pray God that He have neither pity nor mercy\r\non me. I confess that I have written to several persons, that I have\r\nimplored them to deliver me from my wretched prisons, where I\r\nlanguished, a captive and ill-treated princess, for nineteen years and\r\nseven months; but it never occurred to me, even in thought, to write or\r\neven to desire such things against the queen. Yes, I also confess to\r\nhaving exerted myself for the deliverance of some persecuted Catholics,\r\nand if I had been able, and could yet, with my own blood, protect them\r\nand save them from their pains, I would have done it, and would do it\r\nfor them with all my power, in order to save them from destruction.\"\r\n\r\nThen, turning to the secretary, Walsingham—\r\n\r\n\"But, my lord,\" said she, \"from the moment I see you here, I know whence\r\ncomes this blow: you have always been my greatest enemy and my son’s,\r\nand you have moved everyone against me and to my prejudice.\"\r\n\r\nThus accused to his face, Walsingham rose.\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" he replied, \"I protest before God, who is my witness, that you\r\ndeceive yourself, and that I have never done anything against you\r\nunworthy of a good man, either as an individual or as a public\r\npersonage.\"\r\n\r\nThis is all that was said and done that day in the proceedings, till the\r\nnext day, when the queen was again obliged to appear before the\r\ncommissioners.\r\n\r\nAnd, being seated at the end of the table of the said hall, and the said\r\ncommissioners about her, she began to speak in a loud voice.\r\n\r\n\"You are not unaware, my lords and gentlemen, that I am a sovereign\r\nqueen, anointed and consecrated in the church of God, and cannot, and\r\nought not, for any reason whatever, be summoned to your courts, or\r\ncalled to your bar, to be judged by the law and statutes that you lay\r\ndown; for I am a princess and free, and I do not owe to any prince more\r\nthan he owes to me; and on everything of which I am accused towards my\r\nsaid sister, I cannot, reply if you do not permit me to be assisted by\r\ncounsel. And if you go further, do what you will; but from all your\r\nprocedure, in reiterating my protestations, I appeal to God, who is the\r\nonly just and true judge, and to the kings and princes, my allies and\r\nconfederates.\"\r\n\r\nThis protestation was once more registered, as she had required of the\r\ncommissioners. Then she was told that she had further written several\r\nletters to the princes of Christendom, against the queen and the kingdom\r\nof England.\r\n\r\n\"As to that,\" replied Mary Stuart, \"it is another matter, and I do not\r\ndeny it; and if it was again to do, I should do as I have done, to gain\r\nmy liberty; for there is not a man or woman in the world, of less rank\r\nthan I, who would not do it, and who would not make use of the help and\r\nsuccour of their friends to issue from a captivity as harsh as mine was.\r\nYou charge me with certain letters from Babington: well, I do not deny\r\nthat he has written to me and that I have replied to him; but if you\r\nfind in my answers a single word about the queen my sister, well, yes,\r\nthere will be good cause to prosecute me. I replied to him who wrote to\r\nme that he would set me at liberty, that I accepted his offer, if he\r\ncould do it without compromising the one or the other of us: that is\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\"As to my secretaries,\" added the queen, \"not they, but torture spoke by\r\ntheir mouths: and as to the confessions of Babington and his\r\naccomplices, there is not much to be made of them; for now that they are\r\ndead you can say all that seems good to you; and let who will believe\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, the queen refused to answer further if she were not\r\ngiven counsel, and, renewing her protestation, she withdraw into her\r\napartment; but, as the chancellor had threatened, the trial was\r\ncontinued despite her absence.\r\n\r\nHowever, M. de Chateauneuf, the French ambassador to London, saw matters\r\ntoo near at hand to be deceived as to their course: accordingly, at the\r\nfirst rumour which came to him of bringing Mary Stuart to trial, he\r\nwrote to King Henry III, that he might intervene in the prisoner’s\r\nfavour. Henry III immediately despatched to Queen Elizabeth an embassy\r\nextraordinary, of which M. de Bellievre was the chief; and at the same\r\ntime, having learned that James VI, Mary’s son, far from interesting\r\nhimself in his mother’s fate, had replied to the French minister,\r\nCourcelles, who spoke to him of her, \"I can do nothing; let her drink\r\nwhat she has spilled,\" he wrote him the following letter, to decide the\r\nyoung prince to second him in the steps he was going to take:\r\n\r\n\"21st November, 1586.\r\n\r\n\"COURCELLES, I have received your letter of the 4th October last, in\r\nwhich I have seen the discourse that the King of Scotland has held with\r\nyou concerning what you have witnessed to him of the good affection I\r\nbear him, discourse in which he has given proof of desiring to\r\nreciprocate it entirely; but I wish that that letter had informed me\r\nalso that he was better disposed towards the queen his mother, and that\r\nhe had the heart and the desire to arrange everything in a way to assist\r\nher in the affliction in which she now is, reflecting that the prison\r\nwhere she has been unjustly detained for eighteen years and more has\r\ninduced her to lend an ear to many things which have been proposed to\r\nher for gaining her liberty, a thing which is naturally greatly desired\r\nby all men, and more still by those who are born sovereigns and rulers,\r\nwho bear being kept prisoners thus with less patience. He should also\r\nconsider that if the Queen of England, my good sister, allows herself to\r\nbe persuaded by the counsels of those who wish that she should stain\r\nherself with Queen Mary’s blood, it will be a matter which will bring\r\nhim to great dishonour, inasmuch as one will judge that he will have\r\nrefused his mother the good offices that he should render her with the\r\nsaid Queen of England, and which would have perhaps been sufficient to\r\nmove her, if he would have employed them, as warmly, and as soon as his\r\nnatural duty commanded him. Moreover, it is to be feared for him, that,\r\nhis mother dead, his own turn may come, and that one may think of doing\r\nas much for him, by some violent means, to make the English succession\r\neasier to seize for those who are likely to have it after the said Queen\r\nElizabeth, and not only to defraud the said King of Scotland of the\r\nclaim he can put forward, but to render doubtful even that which he has\r\nto his own crown. I do not know in what condition the affairs of my said\r\nsister-in-law will be when you receive this letter; but I will tell you\r\nthat in every case I wish you to rouse strongly the said King of\r\nScotland, with remonstrances, and everything else which may bear on this\r\nsubject, to embrace the defence and protection of his said mother, and\r\nto express to him, on my part, that as this will be a matter for which\r\nhe will be greatly praised by all the other kings and sovereign princes,\r\nhe must be assured that if he fails in it there will be great censure\r\nfor him, and perhaps notable injury to himself in particular.\r\nFurthermore, as to the state of my own affairs, you know that the queen,\r\nmadam and mother, is about to see very soon the King of Navarre, and to\r\nconfer with him on the matter of the pacification of the troubles of\r\nthis kingdom, to which, if he bear as much good affection as I do for my\r\npart, I hope that things may come to a good conclusion, and that my\r\nsubjects will have some respite from the great evils and calamities that\r\nthe war occasions them: supplicating the Creator, Courcelles, that He\r\nmay have you in His holy keeping.\r\n\r\n\"Written at St. Germain-en-Laye, the 21st day of November 1586.(Signed)\r\nHENRI,\r\n\r\n\"And below, BRULART.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter finally decided James VI to make a kind of demonstration in\r\nhis mother’s favour: he sent Gray, Robert Melville, and Keith to Queen\r\nElizabeth. But although London was nearer Edinburgh than was Paris, the\r\nFrench envoys reached it before the Scotch.\r\n\r\nIt is true that on reaching Calais, the 27th of November, M. de\r\nBellievre had found a special messenger there to tell him not to lose an\r\ninstant, from M. de Chateauneuf, who, to provide for every difficulty,\r\nhad chartered a vessel ready in the harbour. But however great the speed\r\nthese noble lords wished to make, they were obliged to await the wind’s\r\ngood-will, which did not allow them to put to sea till Friday 28th at\r\nmidnight; next day also, on reaching Dover at nine o’clock, they were so\r\nshaken by sea-sickness that they were forced to stay a whole day in the\r\ntown to recover, so that it was not till Sunday 30th that M. de\r\nBellievre was able to set out in the coach that M. Chateauneuf sent him\r\nby M. de Brancaleon, and take the road to London, accompanied by the\r\ngentlemen of his suite, who rode on post-horses; but resting only a few\r\nhours on the way to make up for lost time, they at last arrived in\r\nLondon, Sunday the 1st of December at midday. M. de Bellievre\r\nimmediately sent one of the gentlemen of his suite, named M. de\r\nVilliers, to the Queen of England, who was holding her court at Richmond\r\nCastle: the decree had been secretly pronounced already six days, and\r\nsubmitted to Parliament, which was to deliberate upon it with closed\r\ndoors.\r\n\r\nThe French ambassadors could not have chosen a worse moment to approach\r\nElizabeth; and to gain time she declined to receive M. de Villiers,\r\nreturning the answer that he would himself know next day the reason for\r\nthis refusal. And indeed, next day, the rumour spread in London that the\r\nFrench Embassy had contagion, and that two of the lords in it having\r\ndied of the plague at Calais, the queen, whatever wish she might have to\r\nbe agreeable to Henry III, could not endanger her precious existence by\r\nreceiving his envoys. Great was the astonishment of M. de Bellievre at\r\nlearning this news he protested that the queen was led into error by a\r\nfalse report, and insisted on being received. Nevertheless, the delays\r\nlasted another six days; but as the ambassadors threatened to depart\r\nwithout waiting longer, and as, upon the whole, Elizabeth, disquieted by\r\nSpain, had no desire to embroil herself with France, she had M. de\r\nBellievre informed on the morning of the 7th of December that she was\r\nready to receive him after dinner at Richmond Castle, together with the\r\nnoblemen of his suite.\r\n\r\nAt the appointed time the French ambassadors presented themselves at the\r\ncastle gates, and, having been brought to the queen, found her seated on\r\nher throne and surrounded by the greatest lords in her kingdom. Then MM.\r\nde Chateauneuf and de Bellievre, the one the ambassador in ordinary and\r\nthe other the envoy extraordinary, having greeted her on the part of the\r\nKing of France, began to make her the remonstrances with which they were\r\ncharged. Elizabeth replied, not only in the same French tongue, but also\r\nin the most beautiful speech in use at that time, and, carried away by\r\npassion, pointed out to the envoys of her brother Henry that the Queen\r\nof Scotland had always proceeded against her, and that this was the\r\nthird time that she had wished to attempt her life by an infinity of\r\nways; which she had already borne too long and with too much patience,\r\nbut that never had anything so profoundly cut her to the heart as her\r\nlast conspiracy; that event, added she with sadness, having caused her\r\nto sigh more and to shed more tears than the loss of all her relations,\r\nso much the more that the Queen of Scotland was her near relative and\r\nclosely connected with the King of France; and as, in their\r\nremonstrances, MM. de Chateauneuf and de Bellievre had brought forward\r\nseveral examples drawn from history, she assumed, in reply to them on\r\nthis occasion, the pedantic style which was usual with her, and told\r\nthem that she had seen and read a great many books in her life, and a\r\nthousand more than others of her sex and her rank were wont to, but that\r\nshe had never found in them a single example of a deed like that\r\nattempted on her—a deed pursued by a relative, whom the king her brother\r\ncould not and ought not to support in her wickedness, when it was, on\r\nthe contrary, his duty to hasten the just punishment of it: then she\r\nadded, addressing herself specially to M. de Bellievre, and coming down\r\nagain from the height of her pride to a gracious countenance, that she\r\ngreatly regretted he was not deputed for a better occasion; that in a\r\nfew days she would reply to King Henry her brother, concerning whose\r\nhealth she was solicitous, as well as that of the queen mother, who must\r\nexperience such great fatigue from the trouble she took to restore peace\r\nto her son’s kingdom; and then, not wishing to hear more, she withdrew\r\ninto her room.\r\n\r\nThe envoys returned to London, where they awaited the promised reply;\r\nbut while they were expecting it unavailingly, they heard quietly the\r\nsentence of death given against Queen Mary, which decided them to return\r\nto Richmond to make fresh remonstrances to Queen Elizabeth. After two or\r\nthree fruitless journeys, they were at last, December 15th, admitted for\r\nthe second time to the royal presence.\r\n\r\nThe queen did not deny that the sentence had been pronounced, and as it\r\nwas easy to see that she did not intend in this case to use her right of\r\npardon, M. de Bellievre, judging that there was nothing to be done,\r\nasked for a safe-conduct to return to his king: Elizabeth promised it to\r\nhim within two or three days.\r\n\r\nOn the following Tuesday, the 17th of the same month of December,\r\nParliament as well as the chief lords of the realm were convoked at the\r\nPalace of Westminster, and there, in full court and before all, sentence\r\nof death was proclaimed and pronounced against Mary Stuart: then this\r\nsame sentence, with great display and great solemnity, was read in the\r\nsquares and at the cross-roads of London, whence it spread throughout\r\nthe kingdom; and upon this proclamation the bells rang for twenty-four\r\nhours, while the strictest orders were given to each of the inhabitants\r\nto light bonfires in front of their houses, as is the custom in France\r\non the Eve of St. John the Baptist.\r\n\r\nThen, amid this sound of bells, by the light of these bonfires, M. de\r\nBellievre, wishing to make a last effort, in order to have nothing with\r\nwhich to reproach himself, wrote the following letter to Queen\r\nElizabeth:\r\n\r\n\"MADAM:—We quitted your Majesty yesterday, expecting, as it had pleased\r\nyou to inform us, to receive in a few days your reply touching the\r\nprayer that we made you on behalf of our good master, your brother, for\r\nthe Queen of Scotland, his sister in-law and confederate; but as this\r\nmorning we have been informed that the judgment given against the said\r\nqueen has been proclaimed in London, although we had promised ourselves\r\nanother issue from your clemency and the friendship your bear to the\r\nsaid lord king your good brother, nevertheless, to neglect no part of\r\nour duty, and believing in so doing to serve the intentions of the king\r\nour master, we have not wanted to fail to write to you this present\r\nletter, in which we supplicate you once again, very humbly, not to\r\nrefuse his Majesty the very pressing and very affectionate prayer that\r\nhe has made you, that you will be pleased to preserve the life of the\r\nsaid lady Queen of Scotland, which the said lord king will receive as\r\nthe greatest pleasure your Majesty could do him; while, on the contrary,\r\nhe could not imagine anything which would cause him more displeasure,\r\nand which would wound him more, than if he were used harshly with regard\r\nto the said lady queen, being what she is to him: and as, madam, the\r\nsaid king our master, your good brother, when for this object he\r\ndespatched us to your Majesty, had not conceived that it was possible,\r\nin any case, to determine so promptly upon such an execution, we implore\r\nyou, madam, very humbly, before permitting it to go further, to grant us\r\nsome time in which we can make known to him the state of the affairs of\r\nthe said Queen of Scotland, in order that before your Majesty takes a\r\nfinal resolution, you may know what it may please his very Christian\r\nMajesty to tell you and point out to you on the greatest affair which,\r\nin our memory, has been submitted to men’s judgment. Monsieur de\r\nSaint-Cyr, who will give these presents to your Majesty, will bring us,\r\nif it pleases you, your good reply.\r\n\r\n\"London, this 16th day of December 1586.\r\n\r\n\"(Signed) DE BELLIEVRE,\r\n\r\n\"And DE L’AUBESPINE CHATEAUNEUF.\"\r\n\r\nThe same day, M. de Saint-Cyr and the other French lords returned to\r\nRichmond to take this letter; but the queen would not receive them,\r\nalleging indisposition, so that they were obliged to leave the letter\r\nwith Walsingham, her first Secretary of State, who promised them to send\r\nthe queen’s answer the following day.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this promise, the French lords waited two days more: at\r\nlast, on the second day, towards evening, two English gentlemen sought\r\nout M. de Fellievre in London, and, viva voce, without any letter to\r\nconfirm what they were charged to say, announced to him, on behalf of\r\ntheir queen, that in reply to the letter that they had written her, and\r\nto do justice to the desire they had shown to obtain for the condemned a\r\nreprieve during which they would make known the decision to the King of\r\nFrance, her Majesty would grant twelve days. As this was Elizabeth’s\r\nlast word, and it was useless to lose time in pressing her further, M.\r\nde Genlis was immediately despatched to his Majesty the King of France,\r\nto whom, besides the long despatch of M. de Chateauneuf and de Bellievre\r\nwhich he was charged to remit, he was to say ’viva voce’ what he had\r\nseen and heard relative to the affairs of Queen Mary during the whole\r\ntime he had been in England.\r\n\r\nHenry III responded immediately with a letter containing fresh\r\ninstructions for MM. de Chateauneuf and de Bellievre; but in spite of\r\nall the haste M. de Genlis could make, he did not reach London till the\r\nfourteenth day—that is to say, forty-eight hours after the expiration of\r\nthe delay granted; nevertheless, as the sentence had not yet been put\r\ninto execution, MM. de Bellievre and de Chateauneuf set out at once for\r\nGreenwich Castle, some miles from London, where the queen was keeping\r\nChristmas, to beg her to grant them an audience, in which they could\r\ntransmit to her Majesty their king’s reply; but they could obtain\r\nnothing for four or five days; however, as they were not disheartened,\r\nand returned unceasingly to the charge, January 6th, MM. de Bellievre\r\nand de Chateauneuf were at last sent for by the queen.\r\n\r\nAs on the first occasion, they were introduced with all the ceremonial\r\nin use at that time, and found Elizabeth in an audience-chamber. The\r\nambassadors approached her, greeted her, and M. de Bellievre began to\r\naddress to her with respect, but at the same time with firmness, his\r\nmaster’s remonstrances. Elizabeth listened to them with an impatient\r\nair, fidgeting in her seat; then at last, unable to control herself, she\r\nburst out, rising and growing red with anger—\r\n\r\n\"M. de Bellievre,\" said she, \"are you really charged by the king, my\r\nbrother, to speak to me in such a way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied M. de Bellievre, bowing; \"I am expressly commanded\r\nto do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"And have you this command under his hand?\" continued Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madam,\" returned the ambassador with the same calmness; \"and the\r\nking, my master, your good brother, has expressly charged me, in letters\r\nsigned by his own hand, to make to your Majesty the remonstrances which\r\nI have had the honour to address to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" cried Elizabeth, no longer containing herself, \"I demand of you\r\na copy of that letter, signed by you; and reflect that you will answer\r\nfor each word that you take away or add.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" answered M. de Bellievre, \"it is not the custom of the kings of\r\nFrance, or of their agents, to forge letters or documents; you will have\r\nthe copies you require to-morrow morning, and I pledge their accuracy on\r\nmy honour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough, sir, enough!\" said the queen, and signing to everyone in the\r\nroom to go out, she remained nearly an hour with MM. de Chateauneuf and\r\nde Bellievre. No one knows what passed in that interview, except that\r\nthe queen promised to send an ambassador to the King of France, who, she\r\npromised, would be in Paris, if not before, at least at the same time as\r\nM. de Bellievre, and would be the bearer of her final resolve as to the\r\naffairs of the Queen of Scotland; Elizabeth then withdrew, giving the\r\nFrench envoys to understand that any fresh attempt they might make to\r\nsee her would be useless.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of January the ambassadors received their passports, and at\r\nthe same time notice that a vessel of the queen’s was awaiting them at\r\nDover.\r\n\r\nThe very day of their departure a strange incident occurred. A gentleman\r\nnamed Stafford, a brother of Elizabeth’s ambassador to the King of\r\nFrance, presented himself at M. de Trappes’s, one of the officials in\r\nthe French chancellery, telling him that he was acquainted with a\r\nprisoner for debt who had a matter of the utmost importance to\r\ncommunicate to him, and that he might pay the greater attention to it,\r\nhe told him that this matter was connected with the service of the King\r\nof France, and concerned the affairs of Queen Mary of Scotland. M. de\r\nTrappes, although mistrusting this overture from the first, did not\r\nwant, in case his suspicions deceived him, to have to reproach himself\r\nfor any neglect on such a pressing occasion. He repaired, then, with;\r\nMr. Stafford to the prison, where he who wished to converse with him was\r\ndetained. When he was with him, the prisoner told him that he was locked\r\nup for a debt of only twenty crowns, and that his desire to be at\r\nliberty was so great that if M. de Chateauneuf would pay that sum for\r\nhim he would undertake to deliver the Queen of Scotland from her danger,\r\nby stabbing Elizabeth: to this proposal, M. de Trappes, who saw the\r\npitfall laid for the French ambassador, was greatly astonished, and said\r\nthat he was certain that M. de Chateauneuf would consider as very evil\r\nevery enterprise having as its aim to threaten in any way the life of\r\nQueen Elizabeth or the peace of the realm; then, not desiring to hear\r\nmore, he returned to M. de Chateauneuf and related to him what had just\r\nhappened. M. de Chateauneuf, who perceived the real cause of this\r\noverture, immediately said to Mr. Stafford that he thought it strange\r\nthat a gentleman like himself should undertake with another gentleman\r\nsuch treachery, and requested him to leave the Embassy at once, and\r\nnever to set foot there again. Then Stafford withdrew, and, appearing to\r\nthink himself a lost man, he implored M. de Trappes to allow him to\r\ncross the Channel with him and the French envoys. M. de Trappes referred\r\nhim to M. de Chateauneuf, who answered Mr. Stafford directly that he had\r\nnot only forbidden him his house, but also all relations with any person\r\nfrom the Embassy, that he must thus very well see that his request could\r\nnot be granted; he added that if he were not restrained by the\r\nconsideration he desired to keep for his brother, the Earl of Stafford,\r\nhis colleague, he would at once denounce his treason to Elizabeth. The\r\nsame day Stafford was arrested.\r\n\r\nAfter this conference, M. de Trappes set out to rejoin his travelling\r\ncompanions, who were some hours in advance of him, when, on reaching\r\nDover he was arrested in his turn and brought hack to prison in London.\r\nInterrogated the same day, M. de Trappes frankly related what had\r\npassed, appealing to M. de Chateauneuf as to the truth of what he said.\r\n\r\nThe day following there was a second interrogatory, and great was his\r\namazement when, on requesting that the one of the day before should be\r\nshown him, he was merely shown, according to custom in English law,\r\ncounterfeit copies, in which were avowals compromising him as well as M.\r\nde Chateauneuf: he objected and protested, refused to answer or to sign\r\nanything further, and was taken back to the Tower with redoubled\r\nprecaution, the object of which was the appearance of an important\r\naccusation.\r\n\r\nNext day, M. de Chateauneuf was summoned before the queen, and there\r\nconfronted with Stafford, who impudently maintained that he had treated\r\nof a plot with M. de Trappes and a certain prisoner for debt—a plot\r\nwhich aimed at nothing less than endangering the Queen’s life. M. de\r\nChateauneuf defended himself with the warmth of indignation, but\r\nElizabeth had too great an interest in being unconvinced even to attend\r\nto the evidence. She then said to M. de Chateauneuf that his character\r\nof ambassador alone prevented her having him arrested like his\r\naccomplice M. de Trappes; and immediately despatching, as she had\r\npromised, an ambassador to King Henry III, she charged him not to excuse\r\nher for the sentence which had just been pronounced and the death which\r\nmust soon follow, but to accuse M. de Chateauneuf of having taken part\r\nin a plot of which the discovery alone had been able to decide her to\r\nconsent to the death of the Queen of Scotland, certain as she was by\r\nexperience, that so long as her enemy lived her existence would be\r\nhourly threatened.\r\n\r\nOn the same day, Elizabeth made haste to spread, not only in London, but\r\nalso throughout England, the rumour of the fresh danger from which she\r\nhad just escaped, so that, when, two days after the departure of the\r\nFrench envoys, the Scottish ambassadors, who, as one sees, had not used\r\nmuch speed, arrived, the queen answered them that their request came\r\nunseasonably, at a time when she had just had proof that, so long as\r\nMary Stuart existed, her own (Elizabeth’s) life was in danger. Robert\r\nMelville wished to reply to this; but Elizabeth flew into a passion,\r\nsaying that it was he, Melville, who had given the King of Scotland the\r\nbad advice to intercede for his mother, and that if she had such an\r\nadviser she would have him beheaded. To which Melville answered—\r\n\r\n\"That at the risk of his life he would never spare his master good\r\nadvice; and that, on the contrary, he who would counsel a son to let his\r\nmother perish, would deserve to be beheaded.\"\r\n\r\nUpon this reply, Elizabeth ordered the Scotch envoys to withdrew,\r\ntelling them that she would let them have her answer.\r\n\r\nThree or four days passed, and as they heard nothing further, they asked\r\nagain for a parting audience to hear the last resolve of her to whom\r\nthey were sent: the queen then decided to grant it, and all passed, as\r\nwith M. de Bellievre, in recriminations and complaints. Finally,\r\nElizabeth asked them what guarantee they would give for her life in the\r\nevent of her consenting to pardon the Queen of Scotland. The envoys\r\nresponded that they were authorised to make pledges in the name of the\r\nKing of Scotland, their master, and all the lords of his realm, that\r\nMary Stuart should renounce in favour of her son all her claims upon the\r\nEnglish crown, and that she should give as security for this undertaking\r\nthe King of France, and all the princes and lords, his relations and\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nTo this answer, the queen, without her usual presence of mind, cried,\r\n\"What are you saying, Melville? That would be to arm my enemy with two\r\nclaims, while he has only one\".\r\n\r\n\"Does your Majesty then regard the king, my master, as your enemy?\"\r\nreplied Melville. \"He believed himself happier, madam, and thought he\r\nwas your ally.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" Elizabeth said, blushing; \"it is a way of speaking: and if you\r\nfind a means of reconciling everything, gentlemen, to prove to you, on\r\nthe contrary, that I regard King James VI as my good and faithful ally,\r\nI am quite ready to incline to mercy. Seek, then, on your side\" added\r\nshe, \"while I seek on mine.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, she went out of the room, and the ambassadors retired,\r\nwith the light of the hope of which she had just let them catch a\r\nglimpse.\r\n\r\nThe same evening, a gentleman at the court sought out the Master of\r\nGray, the head of the Embassy, as if to pay him a civil visit, and while\r\nconversing said to him, \"That it was very difficult to reconcile the\r\nsafety of Queen Elizabeth with the life of her prisoner; that besides,\r\nif the Queen of Scotland were pardoned, and she or her son ever came to\r\nthe English throne, there would be no security for the lords\r\ncommissioners who had voted her death; that there was then only one way\r\nof arranging everything, that the King of Scotland should himself give\r\nup his claims to the kingdom of England; that otherwise, according to\r\nhim, there was no security for Elizabeth in saving the life of the\r\nScottish queen\". The Master of Gray then, looking at him fixedly, asked\r\nhim if his sovereign had charged him to come to him with this talk. But\r\nthe gentleman denied it, saying that all this was on his own account and\r\nin the way of opinion.\r\n\r\nElizabeth received the envoys from Scotland once more, and then told\r\nthem—\r\n\r\n\"That after having well considered, she had found no way of saving the\r\nlife of the Queen of Scotland while securing her own, that accordingly\r\nshe could not grant it to them\". To this declaration, the Master of Gray\r\nreplied: \"That since it was thus, he was, in this case, ordered by his\r\nmaster to say that they protested in the name of King James that all\r\nthat had been done against his mother was of no account, seeing that\r\nQueen Elizabeth had no authority over a queen, as she was her equal in\r\nrank and birth; that accordingly they declared that immediately after\r\ntheir return, and when their master should know the result of their\r\nmission, he would assemble his Parliament and send messengers to all the\r\nChristian princes, to take counsel with them as to what could be done to\r\navenge her whom they could not save.\"\r\n\r\nThen Elizabeth again flew into a passion, saying that they had certainly\r\nnot received from their king a mission to speak to her in such a way;\r\nbut they thereupon offered to give her this protest in writing under\r\ntheir signatures; to which Elizabeth replied that she would send an\r\nambassador to arrange all that with her good friend and ally, the King\r\nof Scotland. But the envoys then said that their master would not listen\r\nto anyone before their return. Upon which Elizabeth begged them not to\r\ngo away at once, because she had not yet come to her final decision upon\r\nthis matter. On the evening following this audience, Lord Hingley having\r\ncome to see the Master of Gray, and having seemed to notice some\r\nhandsome pistols which came from Italy, Gray, directly he had gone,\r\nasked this nobleman’s cousin to take them to him as a gift from him.\r\nDelighted with this pleasant commission, the young man wished to perform\r\nit the same evening, and went to the queen’s palace, where his relative\r\nwas staying, to give him the present which he had been told to take to\r\nhim. But hardly had he passed through a few rooms than he was arrested,\r\nsearched, and the arms he was taking were found upon him. Although these\r\nwere not loaded, he was immediately arrested; only he was not taken to\r\nthe Tower, but kept a prisoner in his own room.\r\n\r\nNext day there was a rumour that the Scotch ambassadors had wanted to\r\nassassinate the queen in their turn, and that pistols, given by the\r\nMaster of Gray himself, had been found on the assassin.\r\n\r\nThis bad faith could not but open the envoys’ eyes. Convinced at last\r\nthat they could do nothing for poor Mary Stuart, they left her to her\r\nfate, and set out next day for Scotland.\r\n\r\nScarcely were they gone than Elizabeth sent her secretary, Davison, to\r\nSir Amyas Paulet. He was instructed to sound him again with regard to\r\nthe prisoner; afraid, in spite of herself, of a public execution, the\r\nqueen had reverted to her former ideas of poisoning or assassination;\r\nbut Sir Amyas Paulet declared that he would let no one have access to\r\nMary but the executioner, who must in addition be the bearer of a\r\nwarrant perfectly in order, Davison reported this answer to Elizabeth,\r\nwho, while listening to him, stamped her foot several times, and when he\r\nhad finished, unable to control herself, cried, \"God’s death! there’s a\r\ndainty fellow, always talking of his fidelity and not knowing how to\r\nprove it!\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth was then obliged to make up her mind. She asked Davison for\r\nthe warrant; he gave it to her, and, forgetting that she was the\r\ndaughter of a queen who had died on the scaffold, she signed it without\r\nany trace of emotion; then, having affixed to it the great seal of\r\nEngland, \"Go,\" said she, laughing, \"tell Walsingham that all is ended\r\nfor Queen Mary; but tell him with precautions, for, as he is ill, I am\r\nafraid he will die of grief when he hears it.\"\r\n\r\nThe jest was the more atrocious in that Walsingham was known to be the\r\nQueen of Scotland’s bitterest enemy.\r\n\r\nTowards evening of that day, Saturday the 14th, Beale, Walsingham’s\r\nbrother-in-law, was summoned to the palace! The queen gave into his\r\nhands the death warrant, and with it an order addressed to the Earls of\r\nShrewsbury, Kent, Rutland, and other noblemen in the neighbourhood of\r\nFotheringay, to be present at the execution. Beale took with him the\r\nLondon executioner, whom Elizabeth had had dressed in black velvet for\r\nthis great occasion; and set out two hours after he had received his\r\nwarrant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nQueen Mary had known the decree of the commissioners these two months.\r\nThe very day it had been pronounced she had learned the news through her\r\nchaplain, whom they had allowed her to see this once only. Mary Stuart\r\nhad taken advantage of this visit to give him three letters she had just\r\nwritten-one for Pope Sixtus V, the other to Don Bernard Mendoza, the\r\nthird to the Duke of Guise. Here is that last letter:—\r\n\r\n14th December, 1586\r\n\r\n\"My Good Cousin, whom I hold dearest in the world, I bid you farewell,\r\nbeing prepared to be put to death by an unjust judgment, and to a death\r\nsuch as no one of our race, thanks to God, and never a queen, and still\r\nless one of my rank, has ever suffered. But, good cousin, praise the\r\nLord; for I was useless to the cause of God and of His Church in this\r\nworld, prisoner as I was; while, on the contrary, I hope that my death\r\nwill bear witness to my constancy in the faith and to my willingness to\r\nsuffer for the maintenance and the restoration of the Catholic Church in\r\nthis unfortunate island. And though never has executioner dipped his\r\nhand in our blood, have no shame of it, my friend; for the judgment of\r\nheretics who have no authority over me, a free queen, is profitable in\r\nthe sight of God to the children of His Church. If I adhered, moreover,\r\nto what they propose to me, I should not suffer this stroke. All of our\r\nhouse have been persecuted by this sect, witness your good father,\r\nthrough whose intercession I hope to be received with mercy by the just\r\njudge. I commend to you, then, my poor servants, the discharge of my\r\ndebts, and the founding of some annual mass for my soul, not at your\r\nexpense, but that you may make the arrangements, as you will be required\r\nwhen you learn my wishes through my poor and faithful servants, who are\r\nabout to witness my last tragedy. God prosper you, your wife, children,\r\nbrothers and cousins, and above all our chief, my good brother and\r\ncousin, and all his. The blessing of God and that which I shall give to\r\nmy children be on yours, whom I do not commend less to God than my own\r\nson, unfortunate and ill-treated as he is. You will receive some rings\r\nfrom me, which will remind you to pray God for the soul of your poor\r\ncousin, deprived of all help and counsel except that of the Lord, who\r\ngives me strength and courage to alone to resist so many wolves howling\r\nafter me. To God be the glory.\r\n\r\n\"Believe particularly what will be told you by a person who will give\r\nyou a ruby ring from me; for I take it on my conscience that the truth\r\nwill be told you of what I have charged him to tell, and especially in\r\nwhat concerns my poor servants and the share of any. I commend this\r\nperson to you for his simple sincerity and honesty, that he may be\r\nplaced in some good place. I have chosen him as the least partial and as\r\nthe one who will most simply bring you my commands. Ignore, I beg you,\r\nthat he told you anything in particular; for envy might injure him. I\r\nhave suffered a great deal for two years and more, and have not been\r\nable to let you know, for an important reason. God be praised for all,\r\nand give you grace to persevere in the service of His Church as long as\r\nyou live, and never may this honour pass from our race, while so many\r\nmen and women are ready to shed their blood to maintain the fight for\r\nthe faith, all other worldly considerations set aside. And as to me, I\r\nesteem myself born on both father’s and mother’s sides, that I should\r\noffer up my blood for this cause, and I have no intention of\r\ndegenerating. Jesus, crucified for us, and all the holy martyrs, make us\r\nby their intercession worthy of the voluntary offering we make of our\r\nbodies to their glory!\r\n\r\n\"From Fotheringay, this Thursday, 24th November.\r\n\r\n\"They have, thinking to degrade me, pulled down my canopy of state, and\r\nsince then my keeper has come to offer to write to their queen, saying\r\nthis deed was not done by his order, but by the advice of some of the\r\nCouncil. I have shown them instead of my arms on the said canopy the\r\ncross of Our Lord. You will hear all this; they have been more gentle\r\nsince.—Your affectionate cousin and perfect friend,\r\n\r\n\"MARY, Queen of Scotland, Dowager of France\"\r\n\r\nFrom this day forward, when she learned the sentence delivered by the\r\ncommissioners, Mary Stuart no longer preserved any hope; for as she knew\r\nElizabeth’s pardon was required to save her, she looked upon herself\r\nthenceforward as lost, and only concerned herself with preparing to die\r\nwell. Indeed, as it had happened to her sometimes, from the cold and\r\ndamp in her prisons, to become crippled for some time in all her limbs,\r\nshe was afraid of being so when they would come to take her, which would\r\nprevent her going resolutely to the scaffold, as she was counting on\r\ndoing. So, on Saturday the 14th February, she sent for her doctor,\r\nBourgoin, and asked him, moved by a presentiment that her death was at\r\nhand, she said, what she must do to prevent the return of the pains\r\nwhich crippled her. He replied that it would be good for her to medicine\r\nherself with fresh herbs. \"Go, then,\" said the queen, \"and ask Sir Amyas\r\nPaulet from me permission to seek them in the fields.\"\r\n\r\nBourgoin went to Sir Amyas, who, as he himself was troubled with\r\nsciatica, should have understood better than anyone the need of the\r\nremedies for which the queen asked. But this request, simple as it was,\r\nraised great difficulties. Sir Amyas replied that he could do nothing\r\nwithout referring to his companion, Drury; but that paper and ink might\r\nbe brought, and that he, Master Bourgoin, could then make a list of the\r\nneedful plants, which they would try to procure. Bourgoin answered that\r\nhe did not know English well enough, and that the village apothecaries\r\ndid not know enough Latin, for him to risk the queen’s life for some\r\nerror by himself or others. Finally, after a thousand hesitations,\r\nPaulet allowed Bourgoin to go out, which he did, accompanied by the\r\napothecary Gorjon; so that the following day the queen was able to begin\r\nto doctor herself.\r\n\r\nMary Stuart’s presentiments had not deceived her: Tuesday, February\r\n17th, at about two o’clock in the afternoon, the Earls of Kent and\r\nShrewsbury, and Beale sent word to the queen that they desired to speak\r\nwith her. The queen answered that she was ill and in bed, but that if\r\nnotwithstanding what they had to tell her was a matter of importance,\r\nand they would give her a little time, she would get up. They made\r\nanswer that the communication they had to make admitted of no delay,\r\nthat they begged her then to make ready; which the queen immediately\r\ndid, and rising from her bed and cloaking herself, she went and seated\r\nherself at a little table, on the same spot where she was wont to be\r\ngreat part of the day.\r\n\r\nThen the two earls, accompanied by Beale, Arnyas Paulet, and Drue Drury,\r\nentered. Behind them, drawn by curiosity, full of terrible anxiety, came\r\nher dearest ladies and most cherished servants. These were, of\r\nwomenkind, the Misses Renee de Really, Gilles Mowbray, Jeanne Kennedy,\r\nElspeth Curle, Mary Paget, and Susan Kercady; and of men-kind, Dominique\r\nBourgoin her doctor, Pierre Gorjon her apothecary, Jacques Gervais her\r\nsurgeon, Annibal Stewart her footman, Dither Sifflart her butler, Jean\r\nLaudder her baker, and Martin Huet her carver.\r\n\r\nThen the Earl of Shrewsbury, with head bared like all those present, who\r\nremained thus as long as they were in the queen’s room, began to say in\r\nEnglish, addressing Mary—\r\n\r\n\"Madam, the Queen of England, my august mistress, has sent me to you,\r\nwith the Earl of Kent and Sir Robert Beale, here present, to make known\r\nto you that after having honourably proceeded in the inquiry into the\r\ndeed of which you are accused and found guilty, an inquiry which has\r\nalready been submitted to your Grace by Lord Buckhurst, and having\r\ndelayed as long as it was in her power the execution of the sentence,\r\nshe can no longer withstand the importunity of her subjects, who press\r\nher to carry it out, so great and loving is their fear for her. For this\r\npurpose we have come the bearers of a commission, and we beg very\r\nhumbly, madam, that it may please you to hear it read.\"\r\n\r\n\"Read, my lord; I am listening,\" replied Mary Stuart, with the greatest\r\ncalmness. Then Robert Beale unrolled the said commission, which was on\r\nparchment, sealed with the Great Seal in yellow wax, and read as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"Elizabeth, by the grace of God, Queen of England, France, and Ireland,\r\netc., to our beloved and faithful cousins, George, Earl of Shrewsbury,\r\nGrand Marshal of England; Henry, Earl of Kent; Henry, Earl of Derby;\r\nGeorge, Earl of Cumberland; Henry, Earl of Pembroke, greeting: [The\r\nEarls of Cumberland, Derby, and Pembroke did not attend to the queen’s\r\norders, and were present neither at the reading of the sentence nor at\r\nthe execution.]\r\n\r\n\"Considering the sentence by us given, and others of our Council,\r\nnobility, and judges, against the former Queen of Scotland, bearing the\r\nname of Mary, daughter and heiress of James v, King of Scotland,\r\ncommonly called Queen of Scotland and Dowager of France, which sentence\r\nall the estates of our realm in our last Parliament assembled not only\r\nconcluded, but, after mature deliberation, ratified as being just and\r\nreasonable; considering also the urgent prayer and request of our\r\nsubjects, begging us and pressing us to proceed to the publication\r\nthereof, and to carry it into execution against her person, according as\r\nthey judge it duly merited, adding in this place that her detention was\r\nand would be daily a certain and evident danger, not only to our life,\r\nbut also to themselves and their posterity, and to the public weal of\r\nthis realm, as much on account of the Gospel and the true religion of\r\nChrist as of the peace and tranquillity of this State, although the said\r\nsentence has been frequently delayed, so that even until this time we\r\nabstained from issuing the commission to execute it: yet, for the\r\ncomplete satisfaction of the said demands made by the Estates of our\r\nParliament, through which daily we hear that all our friends and\r\nsubjects, as well as the nobility, the wisest, greatest, and most pious,\r\nnay, even those of inferior condition, with all humility and affection\r\nfrom the care they have of our life, and consequently from the fear they\r\nhave of the destruction of the present divine and happy state of the\r\nrealm if we spare the final execution, consenting and desiring the said\r\nexecution; though the general and continual demands, prayers, counsels,\r\nand advice were in such things contrary to our natural inclination; yet,\r\nbeing convinced of the urgent weight of their continual intercessions\r\ntending to the safety of our person, and also to the public and private\r\nstate of our realm, we have at last consented and suffered that justice\r\nhave its course, and for its execution, considering the singular\r\nconfidence we have in your fidelity and loyalty together for the love\r\nand affection that you have toward us, particularly to the safe-guarding\r\nof our person and our country of which you are very noble and chief\r\nmembers; we summon, and, for the discharge of it we enjoin you, that at\r\nsight of these presents you go to the castle of Fotheringay, where the\r\nformer Queen of Scotland is, in the care of our friend and faithful\r\nservant and counsellor, Sir Amyas Paulet, and there take into your\r\nkeeping and do that by your command execution be done on her person, in\r\nthe presence of yourselves and the said Sir Amyas Paulet, and of all the\r\nother officers of justice whom you command to be there: in the meantime\r\nwe have for this end and this execution given warrant in such a way and\r\nmanner, and in such a time and place, and by such persons, that you\r\nfive, four, three, or two, find expedient in your discretion;\r\nnotwithstanding all laws, statutes, and ordinances whatsoever, contrary\r\nto these presents, sealed with our Great Seal of England, which will\r\nserve for each of you, and all those who are present, or will make by\r\nyour order anything pertaining to the execution aforesaid full and\r\nsufficient discharge for ever.\r\n\r\n\"Done and given in our house at Greenwich, the first day of February\r\n(10th February New Style), in the twenty-ninth year of our reign.\"\r\n\r\nMary listened to this reading with great calmness and great dignity;\r\nthen, when it was ended, making the sign of the cross—\r\n\r\n\"Welcome,\" said she, \"to all news which comes in the name of God!\r\nThanks, Lord, for that You deign to put an end to all the ills You have\r\nseen me suffer for nineteen years and more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" said the Earl of Kent, \"have no ill-will towards us on account\r\nof your death; it was necessary to the peace of the State and the\r\nprogress of the new religion.\"\r\n\r\n\"So,\" cried Mary with delight, \"so I shall have the happiness of dying\r\nfor the faith of my fathers; thus God deigns to grant me the glory of\r\nmartyrdom. Thanks, God,\" added she, joining her hands with less\r\nexcitement but with more piety, \"thanks that You have deigned to destine\r\nfor me such an end, of which I was not worthy. That, O my God, is indeed\r\na proof of Your love, and an assurance that You will receive me in the\r\nnumber of Your servants; for although this sentence had been notified to\r\nme, I was afraid, from the manner in which they have dealt with me for\r\nnineteen years, of not yet being so near as I am to such a happy end,\r\nthinking that your queen would not dare to lay a hand on me, who, by the\r\ngrace of God, am a queen as she is, the daughter of a queen as she is,\r\ncrowned as she is, her near relative, granddaughter of King Henry VII,\r\nand who has had the honour of being Queen of France, of which I am still\r\nDowager; and this fear was so much the greater,\" added she, laying her\r\nhand on a New Testament which was near her on the little table, \"that, I\r\nswear on this holy book, I have never attempted, consented to, or even\r\ndesired the death of my sister, the Queen of England.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" replied the Earl of Kent, taking a step towards her and\r\npointing to the New Testament; \"this book on which you have sworn is not\r\ngenuine, since it is the papist version; consequently, your oath cannot\r\nbe considered as any more genuine than the book on which it has been\r\ntaken.\"\r\n\r\n\"My lord,\" answered the queen, \"what you say may befit you, but not me,\r\nwho well know that this book is the true and faithful version of the\r\nword of the Lord, a version made by a very wise divine, a very good man,\r\nand approved by the Church.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" the Earl of Kent returned, \"your Grace stopped at what you were\r\ntaught in your youth, without inquiry as to whether it was good or bad:\r\nit is not surprising, then, that you have remained in your error, for\r\nwant of having heard anyone who could make known the truth to you; this\r\nis why, as your Grace has but a few hours longer to remain in this\r\nworld, and consequently has no time to lose, with your permission we\r\nshall send for the Dean of Peterborough, the most learned man there is\r\non the subject of religion, who, with his word, will prepare you for\r\nyour salvation, which you risk to our great grief and that of our august\r\nqueen, by all the papistical follies, abominations, and childish\r\nnonsense which keep Catholics away from the holy word of God and the\r\nknowledge of the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mistake, my lord,\" replied the queen gently, \"if you have believed\r\nthat I have grown up careless in the faith of my fathers, and without\r\nseriously occupying myself with a matter so important as religion. I\r\nhave, on the contrary, spent my life with learned and wise men who\r\ntaught me what one must learn on this subject, and I have sustained\r\nmyself by reading their works, since the means of hearing them has been\r\ntaken from me. Besides, never having doubted in my lifetime, doubt is\r\nnot likely to seize me in my death-hour. And there is the Earl of\r\nShrewsbury, here present, who will tell you that, since my arrival in\r\nEngland, I have, for an entire Lent, of which I repent, heard your\r\nwisest doctors, without their arguments having made any impression on my\r\nmind. It will be useless, then, my lord,\" she added, smiling, \"to summon\r\nto one so hardened as I the Dean of Peterborough, learned as he is. The\r\nonly thing I ask you in exchange, my lord, and for which I shall be\r\ngrateful to you beyond expression, is that you will send me my almoner,\r\nwhom you keep shut up in this house, to console me and prepare me for\r\ndeath, or, in his stead, another priest, be he who he may; if only a\r\npoor priest from a poor village, I being no harder to please than God,\r\nand not asking that he have knowledge, provided that he has faith.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is with regret, madam,\" replied the Earl of Kent, \"that I find\r\nmyself obliged to refuse your Grace’s, request; but it would be contrary\r\nto our religion and our conscience, and we should be culpable in doing\r\nit; this is why we again offer you the venerable Dean of Peterborough,\r\ncertain that your Grace will find more consolation and content in him\r\nthan in any bishop, priest, or vicar of the Catholic faith.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, my lord,\" said the queen again, \"but I have nothing to-do\r\nwith him, and as I have a conscience free of the crime for which I am\r\nabout to die, with God’s help, martyrdom will take the place of\r\nconfession for me. And now, I will remind you, my lord, of what you told\r\nme yourself, that I have but a few hours to live; and these few hours,\r\nto profit me, should be passed in prayer and meditation, and not in idle\r\ndisputes.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, she rose, and, bowing to the earls, Sir Robert Beale,\r\nAmyas, and Drury, she indictated, by a gesture full of dignity, that she\r\nwished to be alone and in peace; then, as they prepared to go out—\r\n\r\n\"Apropos, my lords,\" said she, \"for what o’clock should I make ready to\r\ndie?\"\r\n\r\n\"For eight o’clock to-morrow, madam,\" answered the Earl of Shrewsbury,\r\nstammering.\r\n\r\n\"It is well,\" said Mary; \"but have you not some reply to make me, from\r\nmy sister Elizabeth, relative to a letter which I wrote to her about a\r\nmonth ago?\"\r\n\r\n\"And of what did this letter treat, if it please you, madam?\" asked the\r\nEarl of Kent.\r\n\r\n\"Of my burial and my funeral ceremony, my lord: I asked to be interred\r\nin France, in the cathedral church of Rheims, near the late queen my\r\nmother.\"\r\n\r\n\"That may not be, madam,\" replied the Earl of Kent; \"but do not trouble\r\nyourself as to all these details: the queen, my august mistress, will\r\nprovide for them as is suitable. Has your grace anything else to ask\r\nus?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would also like to know,\" said Mary, \"if my servants will be allowed\r\nto return, each to his own country, with the little that I can give him;\r\nwhich will hardly be enough, in any case, for the long service they have\r\ndone me, and the long imprisonment they have borne on my account.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have no instructions on that head, madam,\" the Earl of Kent said,\r\n\"but we think that an order will be given for this as for the other\r\nthings, in accordance with your wishes. Is this all that your Grace has\r\nto say to us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my lord,\" replied the queen, bowing a second time, \"and now you\r\nmay withdraw.\"\r\n\r\n\"One moment, my lords, in Heaven’s name, one moment!\" cried the old\r\nphysician, coming forward and throwing himself on his knees before the\r\ntwo earls.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\" asked Lord Shrewsbury.\r\n\r\n\"To point out to you, my lords,\" replied the aged Bourgoin, weeping,\r\n\"that you have granted the queen but a very short time for such an\r\nimportant matter as this of her life. Reflect, my lords, what rank and\r\ndegree she whom you have condemned has held among the princes of this\r\nearth, and consider if it is well and seemly to treat her as an ordinary\r\ncondemned person of middling estate. And if not for the sake of this\r\nnoble queen, my lords, do this for the sake of us her poor servants,\r\nwho, having had the honour of living near her so long, cannot thus part\r\nfrom her so quickly and without preparation. Besides, my lords, think of\r\nit, a woman of her state and position ought to have some time in which\r\nto set in order her last affairs. And what will become of her, and of\r\nus, if before dying, our mistress has not time to regulate her jointure\r\nand her accounts and to put in order her papers and her title-deeds? She\r\nhas services to reward and offices of piety to perform. She should not\r\nneglect the one or the other. Besides, we know that she will only\r\nconcern herself with us, and, through this, my lords, neglect her own\r\nsalvation. Grant her, then, a few more days, my lords; and as our\r\nmistress is too proud to ask of you such a favour, I ask you in all our\r\nnames, and implore you not to refuse to poor servants a request which\r\nyour august queen would certainly not refuse them, if they had the good\r\nfortune to be able to lay it at her feet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it then true, madam,\" Sir Robert Beale asked, \"that you have not yet\r\nmade a will?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not, sir,\" the queen answered.\r\n\r\n\"In that case, my lords,\" said Sir Robert Beale, turning to the two\r\nearls, \"perhaps it would be a good thing to put it off for a day or\r\ntwo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible, sir,\" replied the Earl of Shrewsbury: \"the time is fixed,\r\nand we cannot change anything, even by a minute, now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough, Bourgoin, enough,\" said the queen; \"rise, I command you.\"\r\n\r\nBourgoin obeyed, and the Earl of Shrewsbury, turning to Sir Amyas\r\nPaulet, who was behind him—\r\n\r\n\"Sir Amyas,\" said he, \"we entrust this lady to your keeping: you will\r\ncharge yourself with her, and keep her safe till our return.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words he went out, followed by the Earl of Kent, Sir Robert\r\nBeale, Amyas Paulet, and Drury, and the queen remained alone with her\r\nservants.\r\n\r\nThen, turning to her women with as serene a countenance as if the event\r\nwhich had just taken place was of little importance—\r\n\r\n\"Well, Jeanne,\" said she, speaking to Kennedy, \"have I not always told\r\nyou, and was I not right, that at the bottom of their hearts they wanted\r\nto do this? and did I not see clearly through all their procedure the\r\nend they had in view, and know well enough that I was too great an\r\nobstacle to their false religion to be allowed to live? Come,\" continued\r\nshe, \"hasten supper now, that I may put my affairs in order\". Then,\r\nseeing that instead of obeying her, her servants were weeping and\r\nlamenting, \"My children,\" said she, with a sad smile, but without a tear\r\nin her eye, \"it is no time for weeping, quite the contrary; for if you\r\nlove me, you ought to rejoice that the Lord, in making me die for His\r\ncause, relieves me from the torments I have endured for nineteen years.\r\nAs for me, I thank Him for allowing me to die for the glory of His faith\r\nand His Church. Let each have patience, then, and while the men prepare\r\nsupper, we women will pray to God.\"\r\n\r\nThe men immediately went out, weeping and sobbing, and the queen and her\r\nwomen fell on their knees. When they had recited some prayers, Mary\r\nrose, and sending for all the money she had left, she counted it and\r\ndivided it into portions, which she put into purses with the name of the\r\ndestined recipient, in her handwriting, with the money.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, supper being served, she seated herself at table with\r\nher women as usual, the other servants standing or coming and going, her\r\ndoctor waiting on her at table as he was accustomed since her steward\r\nhad been taken from her. She ate no more nor less than usual, speaking,\r\nthroughout supper, of the Earl of Kent, and of the way in which he\r\nbetrayed himself with respect to religion, by his insisting on wanting\r\nto give the queen a pastor instead of a priest. \"Happily,\" she added,\r\nlaughing, \"one more skilful than he was needed to change me\". Meanwhile\r\nBourgoin was weeping behind the queen, for he was thinking that he was\r\nserving her for the last time, and that she who was eating, talking, and\r\nlaughing thus, next day at the same hour would be but a cold and\r\ninsensible corpse.\r\n\r\nWhen the meal was over, the queen sent for all her servants; then;\r\nbefore the table was cleared of anything, she poured out a cup of wine,\r\nrose and drank to their health, asking them if they would not drink to\r\nher salvation. Then she had a glass given to each one: all kneeled down,\r\nand all, says the account from which we borrow these details, drank,\r\nmingling their tears with the wine, and asking pardon of the queen for\r\nany wrongs they had done her. The queen granted it heartily, and asked\r\nthem to do as much for her, and to forget her impatient ways, which she\r\nbegged them to put down to her imprisonment. Then, having given them a\r\nlong discourse, in which she explained to them their duties to God, and\r\nexhorted them to persevere in the Catholic faith, she begged them, after\r\nher death, to live together in peace and charity, forgetting all the\r\npetty quarrels and disputes which they had had among one another in the\r\npast.\r\n\r\nThis speech ended, the queen rose from table, and desired to go into her\r\nwardrobe-room, to see the clothes and jewels she wished to dispose of;\r\nbut Bourgoin observed that it would be better to have all these separate\r\nobjects brought into her chamber; that there would be a double advantage\r\nin this, she would be less tired for one thing, and the English would\r\nnot see them for another. This last reason decided her, and while the\r\nservants were supping, she had brought into her ante-room, first of all,\r\nall her robes, and took the inventory from her wardrobe attendant, and\r\nbegan to write in the margin beside each item the name of the person it\r\nwas to be given to. Directly, and as fast as she did it, that person to\r\nwhom it was given took it and put it aside. As for the things which were\r\ntoo personal to her to be thus bestowed, she ordered that they should be\r\nsold, and that the purchase-money should be used for her servants’\r\ntravelling expenses, when they returned to their own countries, well\r\nknowing how great the cost would be and that no one would have\r\nsufficient means. This memorandum finished, she signed it, and gave it\r\nas a discharge to her wardrobe attendant.\r\n\r\nThen, that done, she went into her room, where had been brought her\r\nrings, her jewels, and her most valuable belongings; inspected them all,\r\none after the other, down to the very least; and distributed them as she\r\nhad done her robes, so that, present or absent, everyone had something.\r\nThen she furthermore gave, to her most faithful people, the jewels she\r\nintended for the king and queen of France, for the king her son, for the\r\nqueen-mother, for Messieurs de Guise and de Lorraine, without forgetting\r\nin this distribution any prince or princess among her relatives. She\r\ndesired, besides, that each should keep the things then in his care,\r\ngiving her linen to the young lady who looked after it, her silk\r\nembroideries to her who took charge of them, her silver plate to her\r\nbutler, and so on with the rest.\r\n\r\nThen, as they were asking her for a discharge, \"It is useless,\" said\r\nshe; \"you owe an account to me only, and to-morrow, therefore, you will\r\nno longer owe it to anyone\"; but, as they pointed out that the king her\r\nson could claim from them, \"You are right,\" said she; and she gave them\r\nwhat they asked.\r\n\r\nThat done, and having no hope left of being visited by her confessor,\r\nshe wrote him this letter:\r\n\r\n\"I have been tormented all this day on account of my religion, and urged\r\nto receive the consolations of a heretic: you will learn, through\r\nBourgoin and the others, that everything they could say on this matter\r\nhas been useless, that I have faithfully made protestation of the faith\r\nin which I wish to die. I requested that you should be allowed to\r\nreceive my confession and to give me the sacrament, which has been\r\ncruelly refused, as well as the removal of my body, and the power to\r\nmake my will freely; so that I cannot write anything except through\r\ntheir hands, and with the good pleasure of their mistress. For want of\r\nseeing you, then, I confess to you my sins in general, as I should have\r\ndone in particular, begging you, in God’s name, to watch and pray this\r\nnight with me, for the remission of my sins, and to send me your\r\nabsolution and forgiveness for all the wrongs I have done you. I shall\r\ntry to see you in their presence, as they permitted it to my steward;\r\nand if it is allowed, before all, and on my knees, I shall ask your\r\nblessing. Send me the best prayers you know for this night and for\r\nto-morrow morning; for the time is short, and I have not the leisure to\r\nwrite; but be calm, I shall recommend you like the rest of my servants,\r\nand your benefices above all will be secured to you. Farewell, for I\r\nhave not much more time. Send to me in writing everything you can find,\r\nbest for my salvation, in prayers and exhortations, I send you my last\r\nlittle ring.\"\r\n\r\nDirectly she had written this letter the queen began to make her will,\r\nand at a stroke, with her pen running on and almost without lifting it\r\nfrom the paper, she wrote two large sheets, containing several\r\nparagraphs, in which no one was forgotten, present as absent,\r\ndistributing the little she had with scrupulous fairness, and still more\r\naccording to need than according to service. The executors she chose\r\nwere: the Duke of Guise, her first cousin; the Archbishop of Glasgow,\r\nher ambassador; the Bishop of Ross, her chaplain in chief; and M. du\r\nRuysseau, her chancellor, all four certainly very worthy of the charge,\r\nthe first from his authority; the two bishops by piety and conscience,\r\nand the last by his knowledge of affairs. Her will finished, she wrote\r\nthis letter to the King of France:\r\n\r\nSIR MY BROTHER-IN-LAW,—Having, by God’s permission and for my sins, I\r\nbelieve, thrown myself into the arms of this queen, my cousin, where I\r\nhave had much to endure for more than twenty years, I am by her and by\r\nher Parliament finally condemned to death; and having asked for my\r\npapers, taken from me, to make my will, I have not been able to obtain\r\nanything to serve me, not even permission to write my last wishes\r\nfreely, nor leave that after my death my body should be transported, as\r\nwas my dearest desire, into your kingdom, where I had had the honour of\r\nbeing queen, your sister and your ally. To-day, after dinner, without\r\nmore respect, my sentence has been declared to me, to be executed\r\nto-morrow, like a criminal, at eight o’clock in the morning. I have not\r\nthe leisure to give you a full account of what has occurred; but if it\r\nplease you to believe my doctor and these others my distressed servants,\r\nyou will hear the truth, and that, thanks to God, I despise death, which\r\nI protest I receive innocent of every crime, even if I were their\r\nsubject, which I never was. But my faith in the Catholic religion and my\r\nclaims to the crown of England are the real causes for my condemnation,\r\nand yet they will not allow me to say that it is for religion I die, for\r\nmy religion kills theirs; and that is so true, that they have taken my\r\nchaplain from me, who, although a prisoner in the same castle, may not\r\ncome either to console me, or to give me the holy sacrament of the\r\neucharist; but, on the contrary, they have made me urgent entreaties to\r\nreceive the consolations of their minister whom they have brought for\r\nthis purpose. He who will bring you this letter, and the rest of my\r\nservants, who are your subjects for the most part, will bear you witness\r\nof the way in which I shall have performed my last act. Now it remains\r\nto me to implore you, as a most Christian king, as my brother-in-law, as\r\nmy ancient ally, and one who has so often done me the honour to protest\r\nyour friendship for me, to give proof of this friendship, in your virtue\r\nand your charity, by helping me in that of which I cannot without you\r\ndischarge my conscience—that is to say, in rewarding my good distressed\r\nservants, by giving them their dues; then, in having prayers made to God\r\nfor a queen who has been called most Christian, and who dies a Catholic\r\nand deprived of all her goods. As to my son, I commend him to you as\r\nmuch as he shall deserve, for I cannot answer for him; but as to my\r\nservants, I commend them with clasped hands. I have taken the liberty of\r\nsending you two rare stones good for the health, hoping that yours may\r\nbe perfect during a long life; you will receive them as coming from your\r\nvery affectionate sister-in-law, at the point of death and giving proof\r\nof her, good disposition towards you.\r\n\r\n\"I shall commend my servants to you in a memorandum, and will order you,\r\nfor the good of my soul, for whose salvation it will be employed, to pay\r\nme a portion of what you owe me, if it please you, and I conjure you for\r\nthe honour of Jesus, to whom I shall pray to-morrow at my death, that\r\nyou leave me the wherewithal to found a mass and to perform the\r\nnecessary charities.\r\n\r\n\"This Wednesday, two hours after midnight—Your affectionate and good\r\nsister, \"MARY, R....\"\r\n\r\nOf all these recommendations, the will and the letters, the queen at\r\nonce had copies made which she signed, so that, if some should be seized\r\nby the English, the others might reach their destination. Bourgoin\r\npointed out to her that she was wrong to be in such a hurry to close\r\nthem, and that perhaps in two or three hours she would remember that she\r\nhad left something out. But the queen paid no attention, saying she was\r\nsure she had not forgotten anything, and that if she had, she had only\r\ntime now to pray and to look to her conscience. So she shut up all the\r\nseveral articles in the drawers of a piece of furniture and gave the key\r\nto Bourgoin; then sending for a foot-bath, in which she stayed for about\r\nten minutes, she lay down in bed, where she was not seen to sleep, but\r\nconstantly to repeat prayers or to remain in meditation.\r\n\r\nTowards four o’clock in the morning, the queen, who was accustomed,\r\nafter evening prayers, to have the story of some male or female saint\r\nread aloud to her, did not wish to depart from this habit, and, after\r\nhaving hesitated among several for this solemn occasion, she chose the\r\ngreatest sinner of all, the penitent thief, saying humbly—\r\n\r\n\"If, great sinner as he was, he has yet sinned less than I, I desire to\r\nbeg of him, in remembrance of the passion of Jesus Christ; to, have pity\r\non me in the hour of my death, as Our Lord had pity on him.\"\r\n\r\nThen, when the reading was over, she had all her handkerchiefs brought,\r\nand chose the finest, which was of delicate cambric all embroidered in\r\ngold, to bandage her eyes with.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak, reflecting that she had only two hours to live, she rose\r\nand began dressing, but before she had finished, Bourgoin came into her\r\nroom, and, afraid lest the absent servants might murmur against the\r\nqueen, if by chance they were discontented at the will, and might accuse\r\nthose who had been present of having taken away from their share to add\r\nto their own, he begged Mary to send for them all and to read it in\r\ntheir presence; to which Mary agreed, and consented to do so at once.\r\n\r\nAll the servants were then summoned, and the queen read her testament,\r\nsaying that it was done of her own free, full and entire will, written\r\nand signed with her own hand, and that accordingly she begged those\r\npresent to give all the help in their power in seeing it carried out\r\nwithout change or omission; then, having read it over, and having\r\nreceived a promise from all, she gave it to Bourgoin, charging him to\r\nsend it to M. de Guise, her chief executor, and at the same time to\r\nforward her letters to the king and her principal papers and\r\nmemorandums: after this, she had the casket brought in which she had put\r\nthe purses which we mentioned before; she opened them one after another,\r\nand seeing by the ticket within for whom each was intended, she\r\ndistributed them with her own hand, none of the recipients being aware\r\nof their contents. These gifts varied from twenty to three hundred\r\ncrowns; and to these sums she added seven hundred livres for the poor,\r\nnamely, two hundred for the poor of England and five hundred for the\r\npoor of France; then she gave to each man in her suite two rose nobles\r\nto be distributed in alms for her sake, and finally one hundred and\r\nfifty crowns to Bourgoin to be divided among them all when they should\r\nseparate; and thus twenty-six or twenty-seven people had money legacies.\r\n\r\nThe queen performed all this with great composure and calmness, with no\r\napparent change of countenance; so that it seemed as if she were only\r\npreparing for a journey or change of dwelling; then she again bade her\r\nservants farewell, consoling them and exhorting them to live in peace,\r\nall this while finishing dressing as well and as elegantly as she could.\r\n\r\nHer toilet ended, the queen went from her reception-room to her\r\nante-room, where there was an altar set up and arranged, at which,\r\nbefore he had been taken from her, her chaplain used to say mass; and\r\nkneeling on the steps, surrounded by all her servants, she began the\r\ncommunion prayers, and when they were ended, drawing from a golden box a\r\nhost consecrated by Pius V, which she had always scrupulously preserved\r\nfor the occasion of her death, she told Bourgoin to take it, and, as he\r\nwas the senior, to take the priest’s place, old age being holy and\r\nsacred; and in this manner in spite of all the precautions taken to\r\ndeprive her of it, the queen received the holy sacrament of the\r\neucharist.\r\n\r\nThis pious ceremony ended, Bourgoin told the queen that in her will she\r\nhad forgotten three people—Mesdemoiselles Beauregard, de Montbrun, and\r\nher chaplain. The queen was greatly astonished at this oversight, which\r\nwas quite involuntary, and, taking back her will, she wrote her wishes\r\nwith respect to them in the first empty margin; then she kneeled down\r\nagain in prayer; but after a moment, as she suffered too much in this\r\nposition, she rose, and Bourgoin having had brought her a little bread\r\nand wine, she ate and drank, and when she had finished, gave him her\r\nhand and thanked him for having been present to help her at her last\r\nmeal as he was accustomed; and feeling stronger, she kneeled down and\r\nbegan to pray again.\r\n\r\nScarcely had she done so, than there was a knocking at the door: the\r\nqueen understood what was required of her; but as she had not finished\r\npraying, she begged those who were come to fetch her to wait a moment,\r\nand in a few minutes’ she would be ready.\r\n\r\nThe Earls of Kent and Shrewsbury, remembering the resistance she had\r\nmade when she had had to go down to the commissioners and appear before\r\nthe lawyers, mounted some guards in the ante-room where they were\r\nwaiting themselves, so that they could take her away by force if\r\nnecessary, should she refuse to come willingly, or should her servants\r\nwant to defend her; but it is untrue that the two barons entered her\r\nroom, as some have said. They only set foot there once, on the occasion\r\nwhich we have related, when they came to apprise her of her sentence.\r\n\r\nThey waited some minutes, nevertheless, as the queen had begged them;\r\nthen, about eight o’clock, they knocked again, accompanied by the\r\nguards; but to their great surprise the door was opened immediately, and\r\nthey found Mary on her knees in prayer. Upon this, Sir Thomas Andrew,\r\nwho was at the time sheriff of the county of Nottingham, entered alone,\r\na white wand in his hand, and as everyone stayed on their knees praying,\r\nhe crossed the room with a slow step and stood behind the queen: he\r\nwaited a moment there, and as Mary Stuart did not seem to see him—\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" said he, \"the earls have sent me to you.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words the queen turned round, and at once rising in the middle\r\nof her prayer, \"Let us go,\" she replied, and she made ready to follow\r\nhim; then Bourgoin, taking the cross of black wood with an ivory Christ\r\nwhich was over the altar, said—\r\n\r\n\"Madam, would you not like to take this little cross?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you for having reminded me,\" Mary answered; \"I had intended to,\r\nbut I forgot\". Then, giving it to Annibal Stewart, her footman, that he\r\nmight present it when she should ask for it, she began to move to the\r\ndoor, and on account of the great pain in her limbs, leaning on\r\nBourgoin, who, as they drew near, suddenly let her go, saying—\r\n\r\n\"Madam, your Majesty knows if we love you, and all, such as we are, are\r\nready to obey you, should you command us to die for you; but I, I have\r\nnot the strength to lead you farther; besides, it is not becoming that\r\nwe, who should be defending you to the last drop of our blood, should\r\nseem to be betraying you in giving you thus into the hands of these\r\ninfamous English.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Bourgoin,\" said the queen; \"moreover, my death would be\r\na sad sight for you, which I ought to spare your age and your\r\nfriendship. Mr. Sheriff,\" added she, \"call someone to support me, for\r\nyou see that I cannot walk.\"\r\n\r\nThe sheriff bowed, and signed to two guards whom he had kept hidden\r\nbehind the door to lend him assistance in case the queen should resist,\r\nto approach and support her; which they at once did; and Mary Stuart\r\nwent on her way, preceded and followed by her servants weeping and\r\nwringing their hands. But at the second door other guards stopped them,\r\ntelling them they must go no farther. They all cried out against such a\r\nprohibition: they said that for the nineteen years they had been shut up\r\nwith the queen they had always accompanied her wherever she went; that\r\nit was frightful to deprive their mistress of their services at the last\r\nmoment, and that such an order had doubtless been given because they\r\nwanted to practise some shocking cruelty on her, of which they desired\r\nno witnesses. Bourgoin, who was at their head, seeing that he could\r\nobtain nothing by threats or entreaties, asked to speak with the earls;\r\nbut this claim was not allowed either, and as the servants wanted to\r\npass by force, the soldiers repulsed them with blows of their\r\narquebuses; then, raising her voice—\r\n\r\n\"It is wrong of you to prevent my servants following me,\" said the\r\nqueen, \"and I begin to think, like them, that you have some ill designs\r\nupon me beyond my death.\"\r\n\r\nThe sheriff replied, \"Madam, four of your servants are chosen to follow\r\nyou, and no more; when you have come down, they will be fetched, and\r\nwill rejoin you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" said the queen, \"the four chosen persons cannot even follow me\r\nnow?\"\r\n\r\n\"The order is thus given by the earls,\" answered the sheriff, \"and, to\r\nmy great regret, madam, I can do nothing.\"\r\n\r\nThen the queen turned to them, and taking the cross from Annibal\r\nStewart, and in her other hand her book of Hours and her handkerchief,\r\n\"My children,\" said she, \"this is one more grief to add to our other\r\ngriefs; let us bear it like Christians, and offer this fresh sacrifice\r\nto God.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words sobs and cries burst forth on all sides: the unhappy\r\nservants fell on their knees, and while some rolled on the ground,\r\ntearing their hair, others kissed her hands, her knees, and the hem of\r\nher gown, begging her forgiveness for every possible fault, calling her\r\ntheir mother and bidding her farewell. Finding, no doubt, that this\r\nscene was lasting too long, the sheriff made a sign, and the soldiers\r\npushed the men and women back into the room and shut the door on them;\r\nstill, fast as was the door, the queen none the less heard their cries\r\nand lamentations, which seemed, in spite of the guards, as if they would\r\naccompany her to the scaffold.\r\n\r\nAt the stair-head, the queen found Andrew Melville awaiting her: he was\r\nthe Master of her Household, who had been secluded from her for some\r\ntime, and who was at last permitted to see her once more to say\r\nfarewell. The queen, hastening her steps, approached him, and kneeling\r\ndown to receive his blessing, which he gave her, weeping—\r\n\r\n\"Melville,\" said she, without rising, and addressing him as \"thou\" for\r\nthe first time, \"as thou hast been an honest servant to me, be the same\r\nto my son: seek him out directly after my death, and tell him of it in\r\nevery detail; tell him that I wish him well, and that I beseech God to\r\nsend him His Holy Spirit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" replied Melville, \"this is certainly the saddest message with\r\nwhich a man can be charged: no matter, I shall faithfully fulfil it, I\r\nswear to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What sayest thou, Melville?\" responded the queen, rising; \"and what\r\nbetter news canst thou bear, on the contrary, than that I am delivered\r\nfrom all my ills? Tell him that he should rejoice, since the sufferings\r\nof Mary Stuart are at an end; tell him that I die a Catholic, constant\r\nin my religion, faithful to Scotland and France, and that I forgive\r\nthose who put me to death. Tell him that I have always desired the union\r\nof England and Scotland; tell him, finally, that I have done nothing\r\ninjurious to his kingdom, to his honour, or to his rights. And thus,\r\ngood Melville, till we meet again in heaven.\"\r\n\r\nThen, leaning on the old man, whose face was bathed in tears, she\r\ndescended the staircase, at the foot of which she found the two earls,\r\nSir Henry Talbot, Lord Shrewsbury’s son, Amyas Paulet, Drue Drury,\r\nRobert Beale, and many gentlemen of the neighbourhood: the queen,\r\nadvancing towards them without pride, but without humility, complained\r\nthat her servants had been refused permission to follow her, and asked\r\nthat it should be granted. The lords conferred together; and a moment\r\nafter the Earl of Kent inquired which ones she desired to have, saying\r\nshe might be allowed six. So the queen chose from among the men\r\nBourgoin, Gordon, Gervais, and Didier; and from the women Jeanne Kennedy\r\nand Elspeth Curle, the ones she preferred to all, though the latter was\r\nsister to the secretary who had betrayed her. But here arose a fresh\r\ndifficulty, the earls saying that this permission did not extend to\r\nwomen, women not being used to be present at such sights, and when they\r\nwere, usually upsetting everyone with cries and lamentations, and, as\r\nsoon as the decapitation was over, rushing to the scaffold to staunch\r\nthe blood with their handkerchiefs—a most unseemly proceeding.\r\n\r\n\"My lords,\" then said the queen, \"I answer and promise for my servants,\r\nthat they will not do any of the things your honours fear. Alas! poor\r\npeople! they would be very glad to bid me farewell; and I hope that your\r\nmistress, being a maiden queen, and accordingly sensitive for the honour\r\nof women, has not given you such strict orders that you are unable to\r\ngrant me the little I ask; so much the more,\" added she in a profoundly\r\nmournful tone, \"that my rank should be taken into consideration; for\r\nindeed I am your queen’s cousin, granddaughter of Henry VII, Queen\r\nDowager of France and crowned Queen of Scotland.\"\r\n\r\nThe lords consulted together for another moment, and granted her\r\ndemands. Accordingly, two guards went up immediately to fetch the chosen\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nThe queen then moved on to the great hall, leaning on two of Sir Amyas\r\nPaulet’s gentlemen, accompanied and followed by the earls and lords, the\r\nsheriff walking before her, and Andrew Melville bearing her train. Her\r\ndress, as carefully chosen as possible, as we have said, consisted of a\r\ncoif of fine cambric, trimmed with lace, with a lace veil thrown back\r\nand falling to the ground behind. She wore a cloak of black stamped\r\nsatin lined with black taffetas and trimmed in front with sable, with a\r\nlong train and sleeves hanging to the ground; the buttons were of jet in\r\nthe shape of acorns and surrounded with pearls, her collar in the\r\nItalian style; her doublet was of figured black satin, and underneath\r\nshe wore stays, laced behind, in crimson satin, edged with velvet of the\r\nsame colour; a gold cross hung by a pomander chain at her neck, and two\r\nrosaries at her girdle: it was thus she entered the great hall where the\r\nscaffold was erected.\r\n\r\nIt was a platform twelve feet wide, raised about two feet from the\r\nfloor, surrounded with barriers and covered with black serge, and on it\r\nwere a little chair, a cushion to kneel on, and a block also covered in\r\nblack. Just as, having mounted the steps, she set foot on the fatal\r\nboards, the executioner came forward, and; asking forgiveness for the\r\nduty he was about to perform, kneeled, hiding behind him his axe. Mary\r\nsaw it, however, and cried—\r\n\r\n\"Ah! I would rather have been beheaded in the French way, with a\r\nsword!...\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not my fault, madam,\" said the executioner, \"if this last wish of\r\nyour Majesty cannot be fulfilled; but, not having been instructed to\r\nbring a sword, and having found this axe here only, I am obliged to use\r\nit. Will that prevent your pardoning me, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I pardon you, my friend,\" said Mary, \"and in proof of it, here is my\r\nhand to kiss.\"\r\n\r\nThe executioner put his lips to the queen’s hand, rose and approached\r\nthe chair. Mary sat down, and the Earls of Kent and Shrewsbury standing\r\non her left, the sheriff and his officers before her, Amyas Paulet\r\nbehind, and outside the barrier the lords, knights, and gentlemen,\r\nnumbering nearly two hundred and fifty, Robert Beale for the second time\r\nread the warrant for execution, and as he was beginning the servants who\r\nhad been fetched came into the hall and placed themselves behind the\r\nscaffold, the men mounted upon a bench put back against the wall, and\r\nthe women kneeling in front of it; and a little spaniel, of which the\r\nqueen was very fond, came quietly, as if he feared to be driven away,\r\nand lay down near his mistress.\r\n\r\nThe queen listened to the reading of the warrant without seeming to pay\r\nmuch attention, as if it had concerned someone else, and with a\r\ncountenance as calm and even as joyous as if it had been a pardon and\r\nnot a sentence of death; then, when Beale had ended, and having ended,\r\ncried in a loud voice, \"God save Queen Elizabeth!\" to which no one made\r\nany response, Mary signed herself with the cross, and, rising without\r\nany change of expression, and, on the contrary, lovelier than ever—\r\n\r\n\"My lords,\" said she, \"I am a queen-born sovereign princess, and not\r\nsubject to law,—a near relation of the Queen of England, and her\r\nrightful heir; for a long time I have been a prisoner in this country, I\r\nhave suffered here much tribulation and many evils that no one had the\r\nright to inflict, and now, to crown all, I am about to lose my life.\r\nWell, my lords, bear witness that I die in the Catholic faith, thanking\r\nGod for letting me die for His holy cause, and protesting, to-day as\r\nevery day, in public as in private, that I have never plotted, consented\r\nto, nor desired the queen’s death, nor any other thing against her\r\nperson; but that, on the contrary, I have always loved her, and have\r\nalways offered her good and reasonable conditions to put an end to the\r\ntroubles of the kingdom and deliver me from my captivity, without my\r\nhaving ever been honoured with a reply from her; and all this, my lords,\r\nyou well know. Finally, my enemies have attained their end, which was to\r\nput me to death: I do not pardon them less for it than I pardon all\r\nthose who have attempted anything against me. After my, death, the\r\nauthors of it will be known. But I die without accusing anyone, for fear\r\nthe Lord should hear me and avenge me.\"\r\n\r\nUpon this, whether he was afraid that such a speech by so great a queen\r\nshould soften the assembly too much, or whether he found that all these\r\nwords were making too much delay, the Dean of Peterborough placed\r\nhimself before Mary, and, leaning on the barrier—\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" he said, \"my much honoured mistress has commanded me to come to\r\nyou—\" But at these words, Mary, turning and interrupting him:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Dean,\" she answered in a loud voice, \"I have nothing to do with\r\nyou; I do not wish to hear you, and beg you to withdraw.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" said the dean, persisting in spite of this resolve expressed in\r\nsuch firm and precise terms, \"you have but a moment longer: change your\r\nopinions, abjure your errors, and put your faith in Jesus Christ alone,\r\nthat you may be saved through Him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything you can say is useless,\" replied the queen, \"and you will\r\ngain nothing by it; be silent, then, I beg you, and let me die in\r\npeace.\"\r\n\r\nAnd as she saw that he wanted to go on, she sat down on the other side\r\nof the chair and turned her back to him; but the dean immediately walked\r\nround the scaffold till he faced her again; then, as he was going to\r\nspeak, the queen turned about once more, and sat as at first. Seeing\r\nwhich the Earl of Shrewsbury said—\r\n\r\n\"Madam, truly I despair that you are so attached to this folly of\r\npapacy: allow us, if it please you, to pray for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"My lord,\" the queen answered, \"if you desire to pray for me, I thank\r\nyou, for the intention is good; but I cannot join in your prayers, for\r\nwe are not of the same religion.\"\r\n\r\nThe earls then called the dean, and while the queen, seated in her\r\nlittle chair, was praying in a low tone, he, kneeling on the scaffold\r\nsteps, prayed aloud; and the whole assembly except the queen and her\r\nservants prayed after him; then, in the midst of her orison, which she\r\nsaid with her Agnus Dei round her neck, a crucifix in one hand, and her\r\nbook of Hours in the other, she fell from her seat on to, her knees,\r\npraying aloud in Latin, whilst the others prayed in English, and when\r\nthe others were silent, she continued in English in her turn, so that\r\nthey could hear her, praying for the afflicted Church of Christ, for an\r\nend to the persecution of Catholics, and for the happiness of her son’s\r\nreign; then she said, in accents full of faith and fervour, that she\r\nhoped to be saved by the merits of Jesus Christ, at the foot of whose\r\ncross she was going to shed her blood.\r\n\r\nAt these words the Earl of Kent could no longer contain himself, and\r\nwithout respect for the sanctity of the moment—\r\n\r\n\"Oh, madam,\" said he, \"put Jesus Christ in your heart, and reject all\r\nthis rubbish of popish deceptions.\"\r\n\r\nBut she, without listening, went on, praying the saints to intercede\r\nwith God for her, and kissing the crucifix, she cried—\r\n\r\n\"Lord! Lord! receive me in Thy arms out stretched on the cross, and\r\nforgive me all my sins!\"\r\n\r\nThereupon,—she being again seated in the chair, the Earl of Kent asked\r\nher if she had any confession to make; to which she replied that, not\r\nbeing guilty of anything, to confess would be to give herself, the lie.\r\n\r\n\"It is well,\" the earl answered; \"then, madam, prepare.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen rose, and as the executioner approached to assist her disrobe—\r\n\r\n\"Allow me, my friend,\" said she; \"I know how to do it better than you,\r\nand am not accustomed to undress before so many spectators, nor to be\r\nserved by such valets.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then, calling her two women, she began to unpin her coiffure, and as\r\nJeanne Kennedy and Elspeth Curle, while performing this last service for\r\ntheir mistress, could not help weeping bitterly—\r\n\r\n\"Do not weep,\" she said to them in French; \"for I have promised and\r\nanswered for you.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, she made the sign of the cross upon the forehead of\r\neach, kissed them, and recommended them to pray for her.\r\n\r\nThen the queen began to undress, herself assisting, as she was wont to\r\ndo when preparing for bed, and taking the gold cross from her neck, she\r\nwished to give it to Jeanne, saying to the executioner—\r\n\r\n\"My friend, I know that all I have upon me belongs to you; but this is\r\nnot in your way: let me bestow it, if you please, on this young lady,\r\nand she will give you twice its value in money.\"\r\n\r\nBut the executioner, hardly allowing her to finish, snatched it from her\r\nhands with—\r\n\r\n\"It is my right.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen was not moved much by this brutality, and went on taking off\r\nher garments until she was simply in her petticoat.\r\n\r\nThus rid of all her garb, she again sat down, and Jeanne Kennedy\r\napproaching her, took from her pocket the handkerchief of\r\ngold-embroidered cambric which she had prepared the night before, and\r\nbound her eyes with it; which the earls, lords; and gentlemen looked\r\nupon with great surprise, it not being customary in England, and as she\r\nthought that she was to be beheaded in the French way—that is to say,\r\nseated in the chair—she held herself upright, motionless, and with her\r\nneck stiffened to make it easier for the executioner, who, for his part,\r\nnot knowing how to proceed, was standing, without striking, axe in hand:\r\nat last the man laid his hand on the queen’s head, and drawing her\r\nforward, made her fall on her knees: Mary then understood what was\r\nrequired of her, and feeling for the block with her hands, which were\r\nstill holding her book of Hours and her crucifix, she laid her neck on\r\nit, her hands joined beneath her chin, that she might pray till the last\r\nmoment: the executioner’s assistant drew them away, for fear they should\r\nbe cut off with her head; and as the queen was saying, \"In manes teas,\r\nDomine,\" the executioner raised his axe, which was simply an axe far\r\nchopping wood, and struck the first blow, which hit too high, and\r\npiercing the skull, made the crucifix and the book fly from the\r\ncondemned’s hands by its violence, but which did not sever the head.\r\nHowever, stunned with the blow, the queen made no movement, which gave\r\nthe executioner time to redouble it; but still the head did not fall,\r\nand a third stroke was necessary to detach a shred of flesh which held\r\nit to the shoulders.\r\n\r\nAt last, when the head was quite severed, the executioner held it up to\r\nshow to the assembly, saying:\r\n\r\n\"God save Queen Elizabeth!\"\r\n\r\n\"So perish all Her Majesty’s enemies!\" responded the Dean of\r\nPeterborough.\r\n\r\n\"Amen,\" said the Earl of Kent; but he was the only one: no other voice\r\ncould respond, for all were choked with sobs.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the queen’s headdress falling, disclosed her hair, cut\r\nvery short, and as white as if she had been aged seventy: as to her\r\nface, it had so changed during her death-agony that no one would have\r\nrecognised it had he not known it was hers. The spectators cried out\r\naloud at this sign; for, frightful to see, the eyes were open, and the\r\nlids went on moving as if they would still pray, and this muscular\r\nmovement lasted for more than a quarter of an hour after the head had\r\nbeen cut off.\r\n\r\nThe queen’s servants had rushed upon the scaffold, picking up the book\r\nof Hours and the crucifix as relics; and Jeanne Kennedy, remembering the\r\nlittle dog who had come to his mistress, looked about for him on all\r\nsides, seeking him and calling him, but she sought and called in vain.\r\nHe had disappeared.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, as one of the executioners was untying the queen’s\r\ngarters, which were of blue satin embroidered in silver, he saw the poor\r\nlittle animal, which had hidden in her petticoat, and which he was\r\nobliged to bring out by force; then, having escaped from his hands, it\r\ntook refuge between the queen’s shoulders and her head, which the\r\nexecutioner had laid down near the trunk. Jeanne took him then, in spite\r\nof his howls, and carried him away, covered with blood; for everyone had\r\njust been ordered to leave the hall. Bourgoin and Gervais stayed behind,\r\nentreating Sir Amyas Paulet to let them take the queen’s heart, that\r\nthey might carry it to France, as they had promised her; but they were\r\nharshly refused and pushed out of the hall, of which all the doors were\r\nclosed, and there there remained only the executioner and the corpse.\r\n\r\nBrantome relates that something infamous took place there!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo hours after the execution, the body and the head were taken into the\r\nsame hall in which Mary Stuart had appeared before the commissioners,\r\nset down on a table round which the judges had sat, and covered over\r\nwith a black serge cloth; and there remained till three o’clock in the\r\nafternoon, when Waters the doctor from Stamford and the surgeon from\r\nFotheringay village came to open and embalm them—an operation which they\r\ncarried out under the eyes of Amyas Paulet and his soldiers, without any\r\nrespect for the rank and sex of the poor corpse, which was thus exposed\r\nto the view of anyone who wanted to see it: it is true that this\r\nindignity did not fulfil its proposed aim; for a rumour spread about\r\nthat the queen had swollen limbs and was dropsical, while, on the\r\ncontrary, there was not one of the spectators but was obliged to confess\r\nthat he had never seen the body of a young girl in the bloom of health\r\npurer and lovelier than that of Mary Stuart, dead of a violent death\r\nafter nineteen years of suffering and captivity.\r\n\r\nWhen the body was opened, the spleen was in its normal state, with the\r\nveins a little livid only, the lungs yellowish in places, and the brain\r\none-sixth larger than is usual in persons of the same age and sex; thus\r\neverything promised a long life to her whose end had just been so\r\ncruelly hastened.\r\n\r\nA report having been made of the above, the body was embalmed after a\r\nfashion, put in a leaden coffin and that in another of wood, which was\r\nleft on the table till the first day of August—that is, for nearly five\r\nmonths—before anyone was allowed to come near it; and not only that, but\r\nthe English having noticed that Mary Stuart’s unhappy servants, who were\r\nstill detained as prisoners, went to look at it through the keyhole,\r\nstopped that up in such a way that they could not even gaze at the\r\ncoffin enclosing the body of her whom they had so greatly loved.\r\n\r\nHowever, one hour after Mary Stuart’s death, Henry Talbot, who had been\r\npresent at it, set out at full speed for London, carrying to Elizabeth\r\nthe account of her rival’s death; but at the very first lines she read,\r\nElizabeth, true to her character, cried out in grief and indignation,\r\nsaying that her orders had been misunderstood, that there had been too\r\ngreat haste, and that all this was the fault of Davison the Secretary of\r\nState, to whom she had given the warrant to keep till she had made up\r\nher mind, but not to send to Fotheringay. Accordingly, Davison was sent\r\nto the Tower and condemned to pay a fine of ten thousand pounds\r\nsterling, for having deceived the queen. Meanwhile, amid all this grief,\r\nan embargo was laid on all vessels in all the ports of the realm, so\r\nthat the news of the death should not reach abroad, especially France,\r\nexcept through skilful emissaries who could place the execution in the\r\nleast unfavourable light for Elizabeth. At the same time the scandalous\r\npopular festivities which had marked the announcement of the sentence\r\nagain celebrated the tidings of the execution. London was illuminated,\r\nbonfires lit, and the enthusiasm was such that the French Embassy was\r\nbroken into and wood taken to revive the fires when they began to die\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nCrestfallen at this event, M. de Chateauneuf was still shut up at the\r\nEmbassy, when, a fortnight later, he received an invitation from\r\nElizabeth to visit her at the country house of the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury. M. de Chateauneuf went thither with the firm resolve to say\r\nno word to her on what had happened; but as soon as she saw him,\r\nElizabeth, dressed in black, rose, went to him, and, overwhelming him\r\nwith kind attentions, told him that she was ready to place all the\r\nstrength of her kingdom at Henry III’s disposal to help him put down the\r\nLeague. Chateauneuf received all these offers with a cold and severe\r\nexpression, without saying, as he had promised himself, a single word\r\nabout the event which had put both the queen and himself into mourning.\r\nBut, taking him by the hand, she drew him aside, and there, with deep\r\nsighs, said—\r\n\r\n\"Ah! sir, since I saw you the greatest misfortune which could befall me\r\nhas happened: I mean the death of my good sister, the Queen of Scotland,\r\nof which I swear by God Himself, my soul and my salvation, that I am\r\nperfectly innocent. I had signed the order, it is true; but my\r\ncounsellors have played me a trick for which I cannot calm myself; and I\r\nswear to God that if it were not for their long service I would have\r\nthem beheaded. I have a woman’s frame, sir, but in this woman’s frame\r\nbeats a man’s heart.\"\r\n\r\nChateauneuf bowed without a response; but his letter to Henry III and\r\nHenry’s answer prove that neither the one nor the other was the dupe of\r\nthis female Tiberius.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as we have said, the unfortunate servants were prisoners, and\r\nthe poor body was in that great hall waiting for a royal interment.\r\nThings remained thus, Elizabeth said, to give her time to order a\r\nsplendid funeral for her good sister Mary, but in reality because the\r\nqueen dared not place in juxtaposition the secret and infamous death and\r\nthe public and royal burial; then, was not time needed for the first\r\nreports which it pleased Elizabeth to spread to be credited before the\r\ntruth should be known by the mouths of the servants? For the queen hoped\r\nthat once this careless world had made up its mind about the death of\r\nthe Queen of Scots, it would not take any further trouble to change it.\r\nFinally, it was only when the warders were as tired as the prisoners,\r\nthat Elizabeth, having received a report stating that the ill-embalmed\r\nbody could no longer be kept, at last ordered the funeral to take place.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, after the 1st of August, tailors and dressmakers arrived at\r\nFotheringay Castle, sent by Elizabeth, with cloth and black silk stuffs,\r\nto clothe in mourning all Mary’s servants. But they refused, not having\r\nwaited for the Queen of England’s bounty, but having made their funeral\r\ngarments at their own expense, immediately after their mistress’s death.\r\nThe tailors and dressmakers, however, none the less set so actively to\r\nwork that on the 7th everything was finished.\r\n\r\nNext day, at eight o’clock in the evening, a large chariot, drawn by\r\nfour horses in mourning trappings, and covered with black velvet like\r\nthe chariot, which was, besides, adorned with little streamers on which\r\nwere embroidered the arms of Scotland, those of the queen, and the arms\r\nof Aragon, those of Darnley, stopped at the gate of Fotheringay Castle.\r\nIt was followed by the herald king, accompanied by twenty gentlemen on\r\nhorseback, with their servants and lackeys, all dressed in mourning,\r\nwho, having alighted, mounted with his whole train into the room where\r\nthe body lay, and had it brought down and put into the chariot with all\r\npossible respect, each of the spectators standing with bared head and in\r\nprofound silence.\r\n\r\nThis visit caused a great stir among the prisoners, who debated a while\r\nwhether they ought not to implore the favour of being allowed to follow\r\ntheir mistress’s body, which they could not and should not let go alone\r\nthus; but just as they were about to ask permission to speak to the\r\nherald king, he entered the room where they were assembled, and told\r\nthem that he was charged by his mistress, the august Queen of England,\r\nto give the Queen of Scotland the most honourable funeral he could;\r\nthat, not wishing to fail in such a high undertaking, he had already\r\nmade most of the preparations for the ceremony, which was to take place\r\non the 10th of August, that is to say, two days later,—but that the\r\nleaden shell in which the body was enclosed being very heavy, it was\r\nbetter to move it beforehand, and that night, to where the grave was\r\ndug, than to await the day of the interment itself; that thus they might\r\nbe easy, this burial of the shell being only a preparatory ceremony; but\r\nthat if some of them would like to accompany the corpse, to see what was\r\ndone with it, they were at liberty, and that those who stayed behind\r\ncould follow the funeral pageant, Elizabeth’s positive desire being that\r\nall, from first to last, should be present in the funeral procession.\r\nThis assurance calmed the unfortunate prisoners, who deputed Bourgoin,\r\nGervais, and six others to follow their mistress’s body: these were\r\nAndrew Melville, Stewart, Gorjon, Howard, Lauder, and Nicholas\r\nDelamarre.\r\n\r\nAt ten o’clock at night they set out, walking behind the chariot,\r\npreceded by the herald, accompanied by men on foot, who carried torches\r\nto light the way, and followed by twenty gentlemen and their servants.\r\nIn this manner, at two o’clock in the morning, they reached\r\nPeterborough, where there is a splendid cathedral built by an ancient\r\nSaxon king, and in which, on the left of the choir, was already interred\r\ngood Queen Catharine of Aragon, wife of Henry VIII, and where was her\r\ntomb, still decked with a canopy bearing her arms.\r\n\r\nOn arriving, they found the cathedral all hung with black, with a dome\r\nerected in the middle of the choir, much in the way in which ’chapelles\r\nardentes’ are set up in France, except that there were no lighted\r\ncandles round it. This dome was covered with black velvet, and overlaid\r\nwith the arms of Scotland and Aragon, with streamers like those on the\r\nchariot yet again repeated. The state coffin was already set up under\r\nthis dome: it was a bier, covered like the rest in black velvet fringed\r\nwith silver, on which was a pillow of the same supporting a royal crown.\r\n\r\nTo the right of this dome, and in front of the burial-place of Queen\r\nCatharine of Aragon, Mary of Scotland’s sepulchre had been dug: it was a\r\ngrave of brick, arranged to be covered later with a slab or a marble\r\ntomb, and in which was to be deposited the coffin, which the Bishop of\r\nPeterborough, in his episcopal robes, but without his mitre, cross, or\r\ncope, was awaiting at the door, accompanied by his dean and several\r\nother clergy. The body was brought into the cathedral, without chant or\r\nprayer, and was let down into the tomb amid a profound silence. Directly\r\nit was placed there, the masons, who had stayed their hands, set to work\r\nagain, closing the grave level with the floor, and only leaving an\r\nopening of about a foot and a half, through which could be seen what was\r\nwithin, and through which could be thrown on the coffin, as is customary\r\nat the obsequies of kings, the broken staves of the officers and the\r\nensigns and banners with their arms. This nocturnal ceremony ended,\r\nMelville, Bourgoin, and the other deputies were taken to the bishop’s\r\npalace, where the persons appointed to take part in the funeral\r\nprocession were to assemble, in number more than three hundred and\r\nfifty, all chosen, with the exception of the servants, from among the\r\nauthorities, the nobility, and Protestant clergy.\r\n\r\nThe day following, Thursday, August the 9th, they began to hang the\r\nbanqueting halls with rich and sumptuous stuffs, and that in the sight\r\nof Melville, Bourgoin, and the others, whom they had brought thither,\r\nless to be present at the interment of Queen Mary than to bear witness\r\nto the magnificence of Queen Elizabeth. But, as one may suppose, the\r\nunhappy prisoners were indifferent to this splendour, great and\r\nextraordinary as it was.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, August 10th, all the chosen persons assembled at the bishop’s\r\npalace: they ranged themselves in the appointed order, and turned their\r\nsteps to the cathedral, which was close by. When they arrived there,\r\nthey took the places assigned them in the choir, and the choristers\r\nimmediately began to chant a funeral service in English and according to\r\nProtestant rites. At the first words of this service, when he saw it was\r\nnot conducted by Catholic priests, Bourgoin left the cathedral,\r\ndeclaring that he would not be present at such sacrilege, and he was\r\nfollowed by all Mary’s servants, men and women, except Melville and\r\nBarbe Mowbray, who thought that whatever the tongue in which one prayed,\r\nthat tongue was heard by the Lord. This exit created great scandal; but\r\nthe bishop preached none the less.\r\n\r\nThe sermon ended, the herald king went to seek Bourgoin and his\r\ncompanions, who were walking in the cloisters, and told them that the\r\nalmsgiving was about to begin, inviting them to take part in this\r\nceremony; but they replied that being Catholics they could not make\r\nofferings at an altar of which they disapproved. So the herald king\r\nreturned, much put out at the harmony of the assembly being disturbed by\r\nthis dissent; but the alms-offering took place no less than the sermon.\r\nThen, as a last attempt, he sent to them again, to tell them that the\r\nservice was quite over, and that accordingly they might return for the\r\nroyal ceremonies, which belonged only to the religion of the dead; and\r\nthis time they consented; but when they arrived, the staves were broken,\r\nand the banners thrown into the grave through the opening that the\r\nworkmen had already closed.\r\n\r\nThen, in the same order in which it had come, the procession returned to\r\nthe palace, where a splendid funeral repast had been prepared. By a\r\nstrange contradiction, Elizabeth, who, having punished the living woman\r\nas a criminal, had just treated the dead woman as a queen, had also\r\nwished that the honours of the funeral banquet should be for the\r\nservants, so long forgotten by her. But, as one can imagine, these ill\r\naccommodated themselves to that intention, did not seem astonished at\r\nthis luxury nor rejoiced at this good cheer, but, on the contrary,\r\ndrowned their bread and wine in tears, without otherwise responding to\r\nthe questions put to them or the honours granted them. And as soon as\r\nthe repast was ended, the poor servants left Peterborough and took the\r\nroad back to Fotheringay, where they heard that they were free at last\r\nto withdraw whither they would. They did not need to be told twice; for\r\nthey lived in perpetual fear, not considering their lives safe so long\r\nas they remained in England. They therefore immediately collected all\r\ntheir belongings, each taking his own, and thus went out of Fotheringay\r\nCastle on foot, Monday, 13th August, 1587.\r\n\r\nBourgoin went last: having reached the farther side of the drawbridge,\r\nhe turned, and, Christian as he was, unable to forgive Elizabeth, not\r\nfor his own sufferings, but for his mistress’s, he faced about to those\r\nregicide walls, and, with hands outstretched to them, said in a loud and\r\nthreatening voice, those words of David: \"Let vengeance for the blood of\r\nThy servants, which has been shed, O Lord God, be acceptable in Thy\r\nsight\". The old man’s curse was heard, and inflexible history is\r\nburdened with Elizabeth’s punishment.\r\n\r\nWe said that the executioner’s axe, in striking Mary Stuart’s head, had\r\ncaused the crucifix and the book of Hours which she was holding to fly\r\nfrom her hands. We also said that the two relics had been picked up by\r\npeople in her following. We are not aware of what became of the\r\ncrucifix, but the book of Hours is in the royal library, where those\r\ncurious about these kinds of historical souvenirs can see it: two\r\ncertificates inscribed on one of the blank leaves of the volume\r\ndemonstrate its authenticity. These are they:\r\n\r\n    FIRST CERTIFICATE\r\n\r\n\"We the undersigned Vicar Superior of the strict observance of the Order\r\nof Cluny, certify that this book has been entrusted to us by order of\r\nthe defunct Dom Michel Nardin, a professed religious priest of our said\r\nobservance, deceased in our college of Saint-Martial of Avignon, March\r\n28th, 1723, aged about eighty years, of which he has spent about thirty\r\namong us, having lived very religiously: he was a German by birth, and\r\nhad served as an officer in the army a long time.\r\n\r\n\"He entered Cluny, and made his profession there, much detached from all\r\nthis world’s goods and honours; he only kept, with his superior’s\r\npermission, this book, which he knew had been in use with Mary Stuart,\r\nQueen of England and Scotland, to the end of her life.\r\n\r\n\"Before dying and being parted from his brethren, he requested that, to\r\nbe safely remitted to us, it should be sent us by mail, sealed.

Mannheim is seen rising calm and smiling amid gardens\r\nwhich once were ramparts, and which now surround and embrace it like a\r\ngirdle of foliage and flowers. Having reached this spot, he lifted his\r\ncap, above the peak of which were embroidered three interlaced oak\r\nleaves in silver, and uncovering his brow, stood bareheaded for a moment\r\nto feel the fresh air that rose from the valley of the Neckar. At first\r\nsight his irregular features produced a strange impression; but before\r\nlong the pallor of his face, deeply marked by smallpox, the infinite\r\ngentleness of his eyes, and the elegant framework of his long and\r\nflowing black hair, which grew in an admirable curve around a broad,\r\nhigh forehead, attracted towards him that emotion of sad sympathy to\r\nwhich we yield without inquiring its reason or dreaming of resistance.\r\nThough it was still early, he seemed already to have come some distance,\r\nfor his boots were covered with dust; but no doubt he was nearing his\r\ndestination, for, letting his cap drop, and hooking into his belt his\r\nlong pipe, that inseparable companion of the German Borsch, he drew from\r\nhis pocket a little note-book, and wrote in it with a pencil: \"Left\r\nWanheim at five in the morning, came in sight of Mannheim at a\r\nquarter-past nine.\" Then putting his note-book back into his pocket, he\r\nstood motionless for a moment, his lips moving as though in mental\r\nprayer, picked up his hat, and walked on again with a firm step towards\r\nMannheim.\r\n\r\nThis young Student was Karl-Ludwig Sand, who was coming from Jena, by\r\nway of Frankfort and Darmstadt, in order to assassinate Kotzebue.\r\n\r\nNow, as we are about to set before our readers one of those terrible\r\nactions for the true appreciation of which the conscience is the sole\r\njudge, they must allow us to make them fully acquainted with him whom\r\nkings regarded as an assassin, judges as a fanatic, and the youth of\r\nGermany as a hero. Charles Louis Sand was born on the 5th of October,\r\n1795, at Wonsiedel, in the Fichtel Wald; he was the youngest son of\r\nGodfrey Christopher Sand, first president and councillor of justice to\r\nthe King of Prussia, and of Dorothea Jane Wilheltmina Schapf, his wife.\r\nBesides two elder brothers, George, who entered upon a commercial career\r\nat St, Gall, and Fritz, who was an advocate in the Berlin court of\r\nappeal, he had an elder sister named Caroline, and a younger sister\r\ncalled Julia.\r\n\r\nWhile still in the cradle he had been attacked by smallpox of the most\r\nmalignant type. The virus having spread through all his body, laid bare\r\nhis ribs, and almost ate away his skull. For several months he lay\r\nbetween life and death; but life at last gained the upper hand. He\r\nremained weak and sickly, however, up to his seventh year, at which time\r\na brain fever attacked him; and again put his life in danger. As a\r\ncompensation, however, this fever, when it left him, seemed to carry\r\naway with it all vestiges of his former illness. From that moment his\r\nhealth and strength came into existence; but during these two long\r\nillnesses his education had remained very backward, and it was not until\r\nthe age of eight that he could begin his elementary studies; moreover,\r\nhis physical sufferings having retarded his intellectual development, he\r\nneeded to work twice as hard as others to reach the same result.\r\n\r\nSeeing the efforts that young Sand made, even while still quite a child,\r\nto conquer the defects of his organisation, Professor Salfranck, a\r\nlearned and distinguished man, rector of the Hof gymnasium [college],\r\nconceived such an affection for him, that when, at a later time, he was\r\nappointed director of the gymnasium at Ratisbon, he could not part from\r\nhis pupil, and took him with him. In this town, and at the age of eleven\r\nyears, he gave the first proof of his courage and humanity. One day,\r\nwhen he was walking with some young friends, he heard cries for help,\r\nand ran in that direction: a little boy, eight or nine years old, had\r\njust fallen into a pond. Sand immediately, without regarding his best\r\nclothes, of which, however, he was very proud, sprang into the water,\r\nand, after unheard-of efforts for a child of his age, succeeded in\r\nbringing the drowning boy to land.\r\n\r\nAt the age of twelve or thirteen, Sand, who had become more active,\r\nskilful, and determined than many of his elders, often amused himself by\r\ngiving battle to the lads of the town and of the neighbouring villages.\r\nThe theatre of these childish conflicts, which in their pale innocence\r\nreflected the great battles that were at that time steeping Germany in\r\nblood, was generally a plain extending from the town of Wonsiedel to the\r\nmountain of St. Catherine, which had ruins at its top, and amid the\r\nruins a tower in excellent preservation. Sand, who was one of the most\r\neager fighters, seeing that his side had several times been defeated on\r\naccount of its numerical inferiority, resolved, in order to make up for\r\nthis drawback, to fortify the tower of St. Catherine, and to retire into\r\nit at the next battle if its issue proved unfavourable to him. He\r\ncommunicated this plan to his companions, who received it with\r\nenthusiasm. A week was spent, accordingly, in collecting all possible\r\nweapons of defence in the tower and in repairing its doors and stairs.\r\nThese preparations were made so secretly that the army of the enemy had\r\nno knowledge of them.\r\n\r\nSunday came: the holidays were the days of battle. Whether because the\r\nboys were ashamed of having been beaten last time, or for some other\r\nreason, the band to which Sand belonged was even weaker than usual.\r\nSure, however, of a means of retreat, he accepted battle,\r\nnotwithstanding. The struggle was not a long one; the one party was too\r\nweak in numbers to make a prolonged resistance, and began to retire in\r\nthe best order that could be maintained to St. Catherine’s tower, which\r\nwas reached before much damage had been felt. Having arrived there, some\r\nof the combatants ascended to the ramparts, and while the others\r\ndefended themselves at the foot of the wall, began to shower stones and\r\npebbles upon the conquerors. The latter, surprised at the new method of\r\ndefence which was now for the first time adopted, retreated a little;\r\nthe rest of the defenders took advantage of the moment to retire into\r\nthe fortress and shut the door. Great was the astonishment on the part\r\nof the besiegers: they had always seen that door broken down, and lo!\r\nall at once it was presenting to them a barrier which preserved the\r\nbesieged from their blows. Three or four went off to find instruments\r\nwith which to break it down and meanwhile the rest of the attacking\r\nforce kept the garrison blockaded.\r\n\r\nAt the end of half an hour the messengers returned not only with levers\r\nand picks, but also with a considerable reinforcement composed of lads\r\nfrom, the village to which they had been to fetch tools.\r\n\r\nThen began the assault: Sand and his companions defended themselves\r\ndesperately; but it was soon evident that, unless help came, the\r\ngarrison would be forced to capitulate. It was proposed that they should\r\ndraw lots, and that one of the besieged should be chosen, who in spite\r\nof the danger should leave the tower, make his way as best he might\r\nthrough the enemy’s army, and go to summon the other lads of Wonsiedel,\r\nwho had faint-heartedly remained at home. The tale of the peril in which\r\ntheir Comrades actually were, the disgrace of a surrender, which would\r\nfall upon all of them, would no doubt overcome their indolence and\r\ninduce them to make a diversion that would allow the garrison to attempt\r\nsortie. This suggestion was adopted; but instead of leaving the decision\r\nto chance, Sand proposed himself as the messenger. As everybody knew his\r\ncourage, his skill, and his lightness of foot, the proposition was\r\nunanimously accepted, and the new Decius prepared to execute his act of\r\ndevotion. The deed was not free from danger: there were but two means of\r\negress, one by way of the door, which would lead to the fugitive’s\r\nfalling immediately into the hands of the enemy; the other by jumping\r\nfrom a rampart so high that the enemy had not set a guard there. Sand\r\nwithout a moment’s hesitation went to the rampart, where, always\r\nreligious, even in his childish pleasures, he made a short prayer; then,\r\nwithout fear, without hesitation, with a confidence that was almost\r\nsuperhuman, he sprang to the ground: the distance was twenty-two feet.\r\nSand flew instantly to Wonsiedel, and reached it, although the enemy had\r\ndespatched their best runners in pursuit. Then the garrison, seeing the\r\nsuccess of their enterprise, took fresh courage, and united their\r\nefforts against the besiegers, hoping everything from Sand’s eloquence,\r\nwhich gave him a great influence over his young companions. And, indeed,\r\nin half an hour he was seen reappearing at the head of some thirty boys\r\nof his own age, armed with slings and crossbows. The besiegers, on the\r\npoint of being attacked before and behind, recognised the disadvantage\r\nof their position and retreated. The victory remained with Sand’s party,\r\nand all the honours of the day were his.\r\n\r\nWe have related this anecdote in detail, that our readers may understand\r\nfrom the character of the child what was that of the man. Besides, we\r\nshall see him develop, always calm and superior amid small events as\r\namid large ones.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time Sand escaped almost miraculously from two dangers.\r\nOne day a hod full of plaster fell from a scaffold and broke at his\r\nfeet. Another day the Price of Coburg, who during the King of Prussia’s\r\nstay at the baths of Alexander, was living in the house of Sand’s\r\nparents, was galloping home with four horses when he came suddenly upon\r\nyoung Karl in a gateway; he could not escape either on the right or the\r\nleft, without running the risk of being crushed between the wall and the\r\nwheels, and the coachman could not, when going at such a pace, hold in\r\nhis horses: Sand flung himself on his face, and the carriage passed over\r\nhim without his receiving so much as a single scratch either from the\r\nhorses or the wheels. From that moment many people regarded him as\r\npredestined, and said that the hand of God was upon him.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile political events were developing themselves around the boy,\r\nand their seriousness made him a man before the age of manhood. Napoleon\r\nweighed upon Germany like another Sennacherib. Staps had tried to play\r\nthe part of Mutius Scaevola, and had died a martyr. Sand was at Hof at\r\nthat time, and was a student of the gymnasium of which his good tutor\r\nSalfranck was the head. He learned that the man whom he regarded as the\r\nantichrist was to come and review the troops in that town; he left it at\r\nonce and went home to his parents, who asked him for what reason he had\r\nleft the gymnasium.\r\n\r\n\"Because I could not have been in the same town with Napoleon,\" he\r\nanswered, \"without trying to kill him, and I do not feel my hand strong\r\nenough for that yet.\"\r\n\r\nThis happened in 1809; Sand was fourteen years old. Peace, which was\r\nsigned on the 15th of October, gave Germany some respite, and allowed\r\nthe young fanatic to resume his studies without being distracted by\r\npolitical considerations; but in 1811 he was occupied by them again,\r\nwhen he learned that the gymnasium was to be dissolved and its place\r\ntaken by a primary school. To this the rector Salfranck was appointed as\r\na teacher, but instead of the thousand florins which his former\r\nappointment brought him, the new one was worth only five hundred. Karl\r\ncould not remain in a primary school where he could not continue his\r\neducation; he wrote to his mother to announce this event and to tell her\r\nwith what equanimity the old German philosopher had borne it. Here is\r\nthe answer of Sand’s mother; it will serve to show the character of the\r\nwoman whose mighty heart never belied itself in the midst of the\r\nseverest suffering; the answer bears the stamp of that German mysticism\r\nof which we have no idea in France:—\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR KARL,—You could not have given me a more grievous piece of news\r\nthan that of the event which has just fallen upon your tutor and father\r\nby adoption; nevertheless, terrible though it may be, do not doubt that\r\nhe will resign himself to it, in order to give to the virtue of his\r\npupils a great example of that submission which every subject owes to\r\nthe king whom God has set over him. Furthermore, be well assured that in\r\nthis world there is no other upright and well calculated policy than\r\nthat which grows out of the old precept, ’Honour God, be just and fear\r\nnot.’ And reflect also that when injustice against the worthy becomes\r\ncrying, the public voice makes itself heard, and uplifts those who are\r\ncast down.\r\n\r\n\"But if, contrary to all probability, this did not happen,—if God should\r\nimpose this sublime probation upon the virtue of our friend, if the\r\nworld were to disown him and Providence were to become to that degree\r\nhis debtor,—yet in that case there are, believe me, supreme\r\ncompensations: all the things and all the events that occur around us\r\nand that act upon us are but machines set in motion by a Higher Hand, so\r\nas to complete our education for a higher world, in which alone we shall\r\ntake our true place. Apply yourself, therefore, my dear child, to watch\r\nover yourself unceasingly and always, so that you may not take great and\r\nfine isolated actions for real virtue, and may be ready every moment to\r\ndo all that your duty may require of you. Fundamentally nothing is\r\ngreat, you see, and nothing small, when things are, looked at apart from\r\none another, and it is only the putting of things together that produces\r\nthe unity of evil or of good.\r\n\r\n\"Moreover, God only sends the trial to the heart where He has put\r\nstrength, and the manner in which you tell me that your master has borne\r\nthe misfortune that has befallen him is a fresh proof of this great and\r\neternal truth. You must form yourself upon him, my dear child, and if\r\nyou are obliged to leave Hof for Bamberg you must resign yourself to it\r\ncourageously. Man has three educations: that which he receives from his\r\nparents, that which circumstances impose upon him, and lastly that which\r\nhe gives himself; if that misfortune should occur, pray to God that you\r\nmay yourself worthily complete that last education, the most important\r\nof all.\r\n\r\n\"I will give you as an example the life and conduct of my father, of\r\nwhom you have not heard very much, for he died before you were born, but\r\nwhose mind and likeness are reproduced in you only among all your\r\nbrothers and sisters. The disastrous fire which reduced his native town\r\nto ashes destroyed his fortune and that of his relatives; grief at\r\nhaving lost everything—for the fire broke out in the next house to\r\nhis—cost his father his life; and while his mother, who for six years\r\nhad been stretched on a bed of pain, where horrible convulsions held her\r\nfast, supported her three little girls by the needlework that she did in\r\nthe intervals of suffering, he went as a mere clerk into one of the\r\nleading mercantile houses of Augsburg, where his lively and yet even\r\ntemper made him welcome; there he learned a calling, for which, however,\r\nhe was not naturally adapted, and came back to the home of his birth\r\nwith a pure and stainless heart, in order to be the support of his\r\nmother and his sisters.\r\n\r\n\"A man can do much when he wishes to do much: join your efforts to my\r\nprayers, and leave the rest in the hands of God.\"\r\n\r\nThe prediction of this Puritan woman was fulfilled: a little time\r\nafterwards rector Salfranck was appointed professor at Richembourg,\r\nwhither Sand followed him; it was there that the events of 1813 found\r\nhim. In the month of March he wrote to his mother:—\r\n\r\n\"I can scarcely, dear mother, express to you how calm and happy I begin\r\nto feel since I am permitted to believe in the enfranchisement of my\r\ncountry, of which I hear on every side as being so near at hand,—of that\r\ncountry which, in my faith in God, I see beforehand free and mighty,\r\nthat country for whose happiness I would undergo the greatest\r\nsufferings, and even death. Take strength for this crisis. If by chance\r\nit should reach our good province, lift your eyes to the Almighty, then\r\ncarry them back to beautiful rich nature. The goodness of God which\r\npreserved and protected so many men during the disastrous Thirty Years’\r\nWar can do and will do now what it could and did then. As for me, I\r\nbelieve and hope.\"\r\n\r\nLeipzig came to justify Sand’s presentiments; then the year 1814\r\narrived, and he thought Germany free.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of December in the same year he left Richembourg with this\r\ncertificate from his master:—\r\n\r\n\"Karl Sand belongs to the small number of those elect young men who are\r\ndistinguished at once by the gifts of the mind and the faculties of the\r\nsoul; in application and work he surpasses all his fellow-students, and\r\nthis fact explains his rapid progress in all the philosophical and\r\nphilological sciences; in mathematics only there are still some further\r\nstudies which he might pursue. The most affectionate wishes of his\r\nteacher follow him on his departure.\r\n\r\n\"J. A. KEYN, \"Rector, and master of the first class. \"Richembourg, Sept.\r\n15, 1814\"\r\n\r\nBut it was really the parents of Sand, and in particular his mother, who\r\nhad prepared the fertile soil in which his teachers had sowed the seeds\r\nof learning; Sand knew this well, for at the moment of setting out for\r\nthe university of Tubingen, where he was about to complete the\r\ntheological studies necessary for becoming a pastor, as he desired to\r\ndo, he wrote to them:—\r\n\r\n\"I confess that, like all my brothers and sisters, I owe to you that\r\nbeautiful and great part of my education which I have seen to be lacking\r\nto most of those around me. Heaven alone can reward you by a conviction\r\nof having so nobly and grandly fulfilled your parental duties, amid many\r\nothers.\"\r\n\r\nAfter having paid a visit to his brother at St. Gall, Sand reached\r\nTubingen, to which he had been principally attracted by the reputation\r\nof Eschenmayer; he spent that winter quietly, and no other incident\r\nbefell than his admission into an association of Burschen, called the\r\nTeutonic; then came tester of 1815, and with it the terrible news that\r\nNapoleon had landed in the Gulf of Juan. Immediately all the youth of\r\nGermany able to bear arms gathered once more around the banners of 1813\r\nand 1814. Sand followed the general example; but the action, which in\r\nothers was an effect of enthusiasm, was in him the result of calm and\r\ndeliberate resolution. He wrote to Wonsiedel on this occasion:—\r\n\r\n\"April 22, 1813\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR PARENTS,—Until now you have found me submissive to your\r\nparental lessons and to the advice of my excellent masters; until now I\r\nhave made efforts to render myself worthy of the education that God has\r\nsent me through you, and have applied myself to become capable of\r\nspreading the word of the Lord through my native land; and for this\r\nreason I can to-day declare to you sincerely the decision that I have\r\ntaken, assured that as tender and affectionate parents you will calm\r\nyourselves, and as German parents and patriots you will rather praise my\r\nresolution than seek to turn me from it.\r\n\r\n\"The country calls once more for help, and this time the call is\r\naddressed to me, too, for now I have courage and strength. It cost me a\r\ngreat inward struggle, believe me, to abstain when in 1813 she gave her\r\nfirst cry, and only the conviction held me back that thousands of others\r\nwere then fighting and conquering for Germany, while I had to live for\r\nthe peaceful calling to which I was destined. Now it is a question of\r\npreserving our newly re-established liberty, which in so many places has\r\nalready brought in so rich a harvest. The all-powerful and merciful Lord\r\nreserves for us this great trial, which will certainly be the last; it\r\nis for us, therefore, to show that we are worthy of the supreme gift\r\nwhich He has given us, and capable of upholding it with strength and\r\nfirmness.\r\n\r\n\"The danger of the country has never been so great as it is now, that is\r\nwhy, among the youth of Germany, the strong should support the wavering,\r\nthat all may rise together. Our brave brothers in the north are already\r\nassembling from all parts under their banners; the State of Wurtemburg\r\nis, proclaiming a general levy, and volunteers are coming in from every\r\nquarter, asking to die for their country. I consider it my duty, too, to\r\nfight for my country and for all the dear ones whom I love. If I were\r\nnot profoundly convinced of this truth, I should not communicate my\r\nresolution to you; but my family is one that has a really German heart,\r\nand that would consider me as a coward and an unworthy son if I did not\r\nfollow this impulse. I certainly feel the greatness of the sacrifice; it\r\ncosts me something, believe me, to leave my beautiful studies and go to\r\nput myself under the orders of vulgar, uneducated people, but this only\r\nincreases my courage in going to secure the liberty of my brothers;\r\nmoreover, when once that liberty is secured, if God deigns to allow, I\r\nwill return to carry them His word.\r\n\r\n\"I take leave, therefore, for a time of you, my most worthy parents, of\r\nmy brothers, my sisters, and all who are dear to me. As, after mature\r\ndeliberation, it seems the most suitable thing for me to serve with the\r\nBavarians. I shall get myself enrolled, for as long as the war may last,\r\nwith a company of that nation. Farewell, then; live happily; far away\r\nfrom you as I shall be, I shall follow your pious exhortations. In this\r\nnew track I shall still I hope, remain pure before God, and I shall\r\nalways try to walk in the path that rises above the things of earth and\r\nleads to those of heaven, and perhaps in this career the bliss of saving\r\nsome souls from their fall may be reserved for me.\r\n\r\n\"Your dear image will always be about me; I will always have the Lord\r\nbefore my eyes and in my heart, so that I may endure joyfully the pains\r\nand fatigues of this holy war. Include me in your Prayers; God will send\r\nyou the hope of better times to help you in bearing the unhappy time in\r\nwhich we now are. We cannot see one another again soon, unless we\r\nconquer; and if we should be conquered (which God forbid!), then my last\r\nwish, which I pray you, I conjure you, to fulfil, my last and supreme\r\nwish would be that you, my dear and deserving German relatives, should\r\nleave an enslaved country for some other not yet under the yoke.\r\n\r\n\"But why should we thus sadden one another’s hearts? Is not our cause\r\njust and holy, and is not God just and holy? How then should we not be\r\nvictors? You see that sometimes I doubt, so, in your letters, which I am\r\nimpatiently expecting, have pity on me and do not alarm my soul, for in\r\nany case we shall meet again in another country, and that one will\r\nalways be free and happy.\r\n\r\n\"I am, until death, your dutiful and grateful son, \"KARL SAND.\"\r\n\r\nThese two lines of Korner’s were written as a postscript:\r\n\r\n    \"Perchance above our foeman lying dead\r\n     We may behold the star of liberty.\"\r\n\r\nWith this farewell to his parents, and with Korner’s poems on his lips,\r\nSand gave up his books, and on the 10th of May we find him in arms among\r\nthe volunteer chasseurs enrolled under the command of Major\r\nFalkenhausen, who was at that time at Mannheim; here he found his second\r\nbrother, who had preceded him, and they underwent all their drill\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThough Sand was not accustomed to great bodily fatigues, he endured\r\nthose of the campaign with surprising strength, refusing all the\r\nalleviations that his superiors tried to offer him; for he would allow\r\nno one to outdo him in the trouble that he took for the good of the\r\ncountry. On the march he invariably shared: anything that he possessed\r\nfraternally with his comrades, helping those who were weaker than\r\nhimself to carry their burdens, and, at once priest and soldier,\r\nsustaining them by his words when he was powerless to do anything more.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of June, at eight o’clock in the evening, he arrived upon\r\nthe field of battle at Waterloo, On the 14th of July he entered Paris.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of December, 1815, Karl Sand and his brother were back at\r\nWonsiedel, to the great joy of their family. He spent the Christmas\r\nholidays and the end of the year with them, but his ardour for his new\r\nvacation did not allow him to remain longer, and an the 7th of January\r\nhe reached Erlangen. Then, to make up for lost time, he resolved to\r\nsubject his day to fixed and uniform rules, and to write down every\r\nevening what he had done since the morning. It is by the help of this\r\njournal that we are able to follow the young enthusiast, not only in all\r\nthe actions of his life, but also in all the thoughts of his mind and\r\nall the hesitations of his conscience. In it we find his whole self,\r\nsimple to naivete, enthusiastic to madness, gentle even to weakness\r\ntowards others, severe even to asceticism towards himself. One of his\r\ngreat griefs was the expense that his education occasioned to his\r\nparents, and every useless and costly pleasure left a remorse in his\r\nheart. Thus, on the 9th of February 1816, he wrote:—\r\n\r\n\"I meant to go and visit my parents. Accordingly I went to the\r\n’Commers-haus’, and there I was much amused. N. and T. began upon me\r\nwith the everlasting jokes about Wonsiedel; that went on until eleven\r\no’clock. But afterwards N. and T. began to torment me to go to the\r\nwine-shop; I refused as long as I could. But as, at last, they seemed to\r\nthink that it was from contempt of them that I would not go and drink a\r\nglass of Rhine wine with them, I did not dare resist longer.\r\nUnfortunately, they did not stop at Braunberger; and while my glass was\r\nstill half full, N. ordered a bottle of champagne. When the first had\r\ndisappeared, T. ordered a second; then, even before this second battle\r\nwas drunk, both of them ordered a third in my name and in spite of me. I\r\nreturned home quite giddy, and threw myself on the sofa, where I slept\r\nfor about an hour, and only went to bed afterwards.\r\n\r\n\"Thus passed this shameful day, in which I have not thought enough of my\r\nkind and worthy parents, who are leading a poor and hard life, and in\r\nwhich I suffered myself to be led away by the example of people who have\r\nmoney into spending four florins—an expenditure which was useless, and\r\nwhich would have kept the whole family for two days. Pardon me, my God,\r\npardon me, I beseech Thee, and receive the vow that I make never to fall\r\ninto the same fault again. In future I will live even more abstemiously\r\nthan I usually do, so as to repair the fatal traces in my poor cash-box\r\nof my extravagance, and not to be obliged to ask money of my mother\r\nbefore the day when she thinks of sending me some herself.\"\r\n\r\nThen, at the very time when the poor young man reproaches himself as if\r\nwith a crime with having spent four florins, one of his cousins, a\r\nwidow, dies and leaves three orphan children. He runs immediately to\r\ncarry the first consolations to the unhappy little creatures, entreats\r\nhis mother to take charge of the youngest, and overjoyed at her answer,\r\nthanks her thus:—\r\n\r\n\"Far the very keen joy that you have given me by your letter, and for\r\nthe very dear tone in which your soul speaks to me, bless you, O my\r\nmother! As I might have hoped and been sure, you have taken little\r\nJulius, and that fills me afresh with the deepest gratitude towards you,\r\nthe rather that, in my constant trust in your goodness, I had already in\r\nher lifetime given our good little cousin the promise that you are\r\nfulfilling for me after her death.\"\r\n\r\nAbout March, Sand, though he did not fall ill, had an indisposition that\r\nobliged him to go and take the waters; his mother happened at the time\r\nto be at the ironworks of Redwitz, some twelve or fifteen miles from\r\nWonsiedel, where the mineral springs are found. Sand established himself\r\nthere with his mother, and notwithstanding his desire to avoid\r\ninterrupting his work, the time taken up by baths, by invitations to\r\ndinners, and even by the walks which his health required, disturbed the\r\nregularity of his usual existence and awakened his remorse. Thus we find\r\nthese lines written in his journal for April 13th:\r\n\r\n\"Life, without some high aim towards which all thoughts and actions\r\ntend, is an empty desert: my day yesterday is a proof of this; I spent\r\nit with my own people, and that, of course, was a great pleasure to me;\r\nbut how did I spend it? In continual eating, so that when I wanted to\r\nwork I could do nothing worth doing. Full of indolence and slackness, I\r\ndragged myself into the company of two or three sets of people, and came\r\nfrom them in the same state of mind as I went to them.\"\r\n\r\nFor these expeditions Sand made use of a little chestnut horse which\r\nbelonged to his brother, and of which he was very fond. This little\r\nhorse had been bought with great difficulty; for, as we have said, the\r\nwhole family was poor. The following note, in relation to the animal,\r\nwill give an idea of Sand’s simplicity of heart:—\r\n\r\n\"19th April \"To-day I have been very happy at the ironworks, and very\r\nindustrious beside my kind mother. In the evening I came home on the\r\nlittle chestnut. Since the day before yesterday, when he got a strain\r\nand hurt his foot, he has been very restive and very touchy, and when he\r\ngot home he refused his food. I thought at first that he did not fancy\r\nhis fodder, and gave him some pieces of sugar and sticks of cinnamon,\r\nwhich he likes very much; he tasted them, but would not eat them. The\r\npoor little beast seems to have same other internal indisposition\r\nbesides his injured foot. If by ill luck he were to become foundered or\r\nill, everybody, even my parents, would throw the blame on me, and yet I\r\nhave been very careful and considerate of him. My God, my Lord, Thou who\r\ncanst do things both great and small, remove from me this misfortune,\r\nand let him recover as quickly as possible. If, however, Thou hast\r\nwilled otherwise, and if this fresh trouble is to fall upon us, I will\r\ntry to bear it with courage, and as the expiation of some sin.\r\nMeanwhile, O my God, I leave this matter in Thy hands, as I leave my\r\nlife and my soul.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of April he wrote:—\"The little horse is well; God has helped\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nGerman manners and customs are so different from ours, and contrasts\r\noccur so frequently in the same man, on the other side of the Rhine,\r\nthat anything less than all the quotations which we have given would\r\nhave been insufficient to place before our readers a true idea of that\r\ncharacter made up of artlessness and reason, childishness and strength,\r\ndepression and enthusiasm, material details and poetic ideas, which\r\nrenders Sand a man incomprehensible to us. We will now continue the\r\nportrait, which still wants a few finishing touches.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to Erlangen, after the completion of his \"cure,\" Sand\r\nread Faust for the first time. At first he was amazed at that work,\r\nwhich seemed to him an orgy of genius; then, when he had entirely\r\nfinished it, he reconsidered his first impression, and wrote:—\r\n\r\n\"4th May\r\n\r\n\"Oh, horrible struggle of man and devil! What Mephistopheles is in me I\r\nfeel for the first time in this hour, and I feel it, O God, with\r\nconsternation!\r\n\r\n\"About eleven at night I finished reading the tragedy, and I felt and\r\nsaw the fiend in myself, so that by midnight, amid my tears and despair,\r\nI was at last frightened at myself.\"\r\n\r\nSand was falling by degrees into a deep melancholy, from which nothing\r\ncould rouse him except his desire to purify and preach morality to the\r\nstudents around him. To anyone who knows university life such a task\r\nwill seem superhuman. Sand, however, was not discouraged, and if he\r\ncould not gain an influence over everyone, he at least succeeded in\r\nforming around him a considerable circle of the most intelligent and the\r\nbest; nevertheless, in the midst of these apostolic labours strange\r\nlongings for death would overcome him; he seemed to recall heaven and\r\nwant to return to it; he called these temptations \"homesickness for the\r\nsoul’s country.\"\r\n\r\nHis favourite authors were Lessing, Schiller, Herder, and Goethe; after\r\nre-reading the two last for the twentieth time, this is what he wrote:\r\n\r\n\"Good and evil touch each other; the woes of the young Werther and\r\nWeisslingen’s seduction, are almost the same story; no matter, we must\r\nnot judge between what is good and what is evil in others; for that is\r\nwhat God will do. I have just been spending much time over this thought,\r\nand have become convinced that in no circumstances ought we to allow\r\nourselves to seek for the devil in others, and that we have no right to\r\njudge; the only creature over whom we have received the power to judge\r\nand condemn is ourself, and that gives us enough constant care,\r\nbusiness, and trouble.\r\n\r\n\"I have again to-day felt a profound desire to quit this world and enter\r\na higher world; but this desire is rather dejection than strength, a\r\nlassitude than an upsoaring.\"\r\n\r\nThe year 1816 was spent by Sand in these pious attempts upon his young\r\ncomrades, in this ceaseless self-examination, and in the perpetual\r\nbattle which he waged with the desire for death that pursued him; every\r\nday he had deeper doubts of himself; and on the 1st of January, 1817, he\r\nwrote this prayer in his diary:—\r\n\r\n\"Grant to me, O Lord, to me whom Thou halt endowed, in sending me on\r\nearth, with free will, the grace that in this year which we are now\r\nbeginning I may never relax this constant attention, and not shamefully\r\ngive up the examination of my conscience which I have hitherto made.\r\nGive me strength to increase the attention which I turn upon my own\r\nlife, and to diminish that which I turn upon the life of others;\r\nstrengthen my will that it may become powerful to command the desires of\r\nthe body and the waverings of the soul; give me a pious conscience\r\nentirely devoted to Thy celestial kingdom, that I may always belong to\r\nThee, or after failing, may be able to return to Thee.\"\r\n\r\nSand was right in praying to God for the year 1817, and his fears were a\r\npresentiment: the skies of Germany, lightened by Leipzig and Waterloo,\r\nwere once more darkened; to the colossal and universal despotism of\r\nNapoleon succeeded the individual oppression of those little princes who\r\nmade up the Germanic Diet, and all that the nations had gained by\r\noverthrowing the giant was to be governed by dwarfs. This was the time\r\nwhen secret societies were organised throughout Germany; let us say a\r\nfew words about them, for the history that we are writing is not only\r\nthat of individuals, but also that of nations, and every time that\r\noccasion presents itself we will give our little picture a wide horizon.\r\n\r\nThe secret societies of Germany, of which, without knowing them, we have\r\nall heard, seem, when we follow them up, like rivers, to originate in\r\nsome sort of affiliation to those famous clubs of the ’illumines’ and\r\nthe freemasons which made so much stir in France at the close of the\r\neighteenth century. At the time of the revolution of ’89 these different\r\nphilosophical, political, and religious sects enthusiastically accepted\r\nthe republican doctrines, and the successes of our first generals have\r\noften been attributed to the secret efforts of the members. When\r\nBonaparte, who was acquainted with these groups, and was even said to\r\nhave belonged to them, exchanged his general’s uniform for an emperor’s\r\ncloak, all of them, considering him as a renegade and traitor, not only\r\nrose against him at home, but tried to raise enemies against him abroad;\r\nas they addressed themselves to noble and generous passions, they found\r\na response, and princes to whom their results might be profitable seemed\r\nfor a moment to encourage them. Among others, Prince Louis of Prussia\r\nwas grandmaster of one of these societies.\r\n\r\nThe attempted murder by Stops, to which we have already referred, was\r\none of the thunderclaps of the storm; but its morrow brought the peace\r\nof Vienna, and the degradation of Austria was the death-blow of the old\r\nGermanic organisation. These societies, which had received a mortal\r\nwound in 1806 and were now controlled by the French police, instead of\r\ncontinuing to meet in public, were forced to seek new members in the\r\ndark. In 1811 several agents of these societies were arrested in Berlin,\r\nbut the Prussian authorities, following secret orders of Queen Louisa,\r\nactually protected them, so that they were easily able to deceive the\r\nFrench police about their intentions. About February 1815 the disasters\r\nof the French army revived the courage of these societies, for it was\r\nseen that God was helping their cause: the students in particular joined\r\nenthusiastically in the new attempts that were now begun; many colleges\r\nenrolled themselves almost entire, and chose their principals and\r\nprofessors as captains; the poet, Korner, killed on the 18th of October\r\nat Liegzig, was the hero of this campaign.\r\n\r\nThe triumph of this national movement, which twice carried the Prussian\r\narmy—largely composed of volunteers—to Paris, was followed, when the\r\ntreaties of 1815 and the new Germanic constitution were made known, by a\r\nterrible reaction in Germany. All these young men who, exiled by their\r\nprinces, had risen in the name of liberty, soon perceived that they had\r\nbeen used as tools to establish European despotism; they wished to claim\r\nthe promises that had been made, but the policy of Talleyrand and\r\nMetternich weighed on them, and repressing them at the first words they\r\nuttered, compelled them to shelter their discontent and their hopes in\r\nthe universities, which, enjoying a kind of constitution of their own,\r\nmore easily escaped the investigations made by the spies of the Holy\r\nAlliance; but, repressed as they were, these societies continued\r\nnevertheless to exist, and kept up communications by means of travelling\r\nstudents, who, bearing verbal messages, traversed Germany under the\r\npretence of botanising, and, passing from mountain to mountain, sowed\r\nbroadcast those luminous and hopeful words of which peoples are always\r\ngreedy and kings always fear.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that Sand, carried away by the general movement, had gone\r\nthrough the campaign of 1815 as a volunteer, although he was then only\r\nnineteen years old. On his return, he, like others, had found his golden\r\nhopes deceived, and it is from this period that we find his journal\r\nassuming the tone of mysticism and sadness which our readers must have\r\nremarked in it. He soon entered one of these associations, the Teutonia;\r\nand from that moment, regarding the great cause which he had taken up as\r\na religious one, he attempted to make the conspirators worthy of their\r\nenterprise, and thus arose his attempts to inculcate moral doctrines, in\r\nwhich he succeeded with some, but failed with the majority. Sand had\r\nsucceeded, however, in forming around him a certain circle of Puritans,\r\ncomposed of about sixty to eighty students, all belonging to the group\r\nof the ’Burschenschaft’ which continued its political and religious\r\ncourse despite all the jeers of the opposing group—the ’Landmannschaft’.\r\nOne of his friends called Dittmar and he were pretty much the chiefs,\r\nand although no election had given them their authority, they exercised\r\nso much influence upon what was decided that in any particular case\r\ntheir fellow-adepts were sure spontaneously to obey any impulse that\r\nthey might choose to impart. The meetings of the Burschen took place\r\nupon a little hill crowned by a ruined castle, which was situated at\r\nsome distance from Erlangen, and which Sand and Dittmar had called the\r\nRuttli, in memory of the spot where Walter Furst, Melchthal, and\r\nStauffacher had made their vow to deliver their country; there, under\r\nthe pretence of students’ games, while they built up a new house with\r\nthe ruined fragments, they passed alternately from symbol to action and\r\nfrom action to symbol.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the association was making such advances throughout Germany\r\nthat not only the princes and kings of the German confederation, but\r\nalso the great European powers, began to be uneasy. France sent agents\r\nto bring home reports, Russia paid agents on the spot, and the\r\npersecutions that touched a professor and exasperated a whole university\r\noften arose from a note sent by the Cabinet of the Tuileries or of St.\r\nPetersburg.\r\n\r\nIt was amid the events that began thus that Sand, after commending\r\nhimself to the protection of God, began the year 1817, in the sad mood\r\nin which we have just seen him, and in which he was kept rather by a\r\ndisgust for things as they were than by a disgust for life. On the 8th\r\nof May, preyed upon by this melancholy, which he cannot conquer, and\r\nwhich comes from the disappointment of all his political hopes, he\r\nwrites in his diary:\r\n\r\n\"I shall find it impossible to set seriously to work, and this idle\r\ntemper, this humour of hypochondria which casts its black veil over\r\neverything in life,—continues and grows in spite of the moral activity\r\nwhich I imposed on myself yesterday.\"\r\n\r\nIn the holidays, fearing to burden his parents with any additional\r\nexpense, he will not go home, and prefers to make a walking tour with\r\nhis friends. No doubt this tour, in addition to its recreative side, had\r\na political aim. Be that as it may, Sand’s diary, during the period of\r\nhis journey, shows nothing but the names of the towns through which he\r\npassed. That we may have a notion of Sand’s dutifulness to his parents,\r\nit should be said that he did not set out until he had obtained his\r\nmother’s permission. On their return, Sand, Dittmar, and their friends\r\nthe Burschen, found their Ruttli sacked by their enemies of the\r\nLandmannschaft; the house that they had built was demolished and its\r\nfragments dispersed. Sand took this event for an omen, and was greatly\r\ndepressed by it.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me, O my God!\" he says in his journal, \"that everything\r\nswims and turns around me. My soul grows darker and darker; my moral\r\nstrength grows less instead of greater; I work and cannot achieve; walk\r\ntowards my aim and do not reach it; exhaust myself, and do nothing\r\ngreat. The days of life flee one after another; cares and uneasiness\r\nincrease; I see no haven anywhere for our sacred German cause. The end\r\nwill be that we shall fall, for I myself waver. O Lord and Father!\r\nprotect me, save me, and lead me to that land from which we are for ever\r\ndriven back by the indifference of wavering spirits.\"\r\n\r\nAbout this time a terrible event struck Sand to the heart; his friend\r\nDittmar was drowned. This is what he wrote in his diary on the very\r\nmorning of the occurrence:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, almighty God! What is going to become of me? For the last fortnight\r\nI have been drawn into disorder, and have not been able to compel myself\r\nto look fixedly either backward or forward in my life, so that from the\r\n4th of June up to the present hour my journal has remained empty. Yet\r\nevery day I might have had occasion to praise Thee, O my God, but my\r\nsoul is in anguish. Lord, do not turn from me; the more are the\r\nobstacles the more need is there of strength.\"\r\n\r\nIn the evening he added these few words to the lines that he had written\r\nin the morning:—\r\n\r\n\"Desolation, despair, and death over my friend, over my very deeply\r\nloved Dittmar.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter which he wrote to his family contains the account of the\r\ntragic event:—\r\n\r\n\"You know that when my best friends, A., C., and Z., were gone, I became\r\nparticularly intimate with my well-beloved Dittmar of Anspach; Dittmar,\r\nthat is to say a true and worthy German, an evangelical Christian,\r\nsomething more, in short, than a man! An angelic soul, always turned\r\ntoward the good, serene, pious, and ready for action; he had come to\r\nlive in a room next to mine in Professor Grunler’s house; we loved each\r\nother, upheld each other in our efforts, and, well or ill, bore our good\r\nor evil fortune in common. On this last spring evening, after having\r\nworked in his room and having strengthened ourselves anew to resist all\r\nthe torments of life and to advance towards the aim that we desired to\r\nattain; we went, about seven in the evening, to the baths of Redwitz. A\r\nvery black storm was rising in the sky, but only as yet appeared on the\r\nhorizon. E., who was with us, proposed to go home, but Dittmar\r\npersisted, saying that the canal was but a few steps away. God permitted\r\nthat it should not be I who replied with these fatal words. So he went\r\non. The sunset was splendid: I see it still; its violet clouds all\r\nfringed with gold, for I remember the smallest details of that evening.\r\n\r\n\"Dittmar went down first; he was the only one of us who knew how to\r\nswim; so he walked before us to show us the depth. The water was about\r\nup to our chests, and he, who preceded us, was up to his shoulders, when\r\nhe warned us not to go farther, because he was ceasing to feel the\r\nbottom. He immediately gave up his footing and began to swim, but\r\nscarcely had he made ten strokes when, having reached the place where\r\nthe river separates into two branches, he uttered a cry, and as he was\r\ntrying to get a foothold, disappeared. We ran at once to the bank,\r\nhoping to be able to help him more easily; but we had neither poles nor\r\nropes within reach, and, as I have told you, neither of us could swim.\r\nThen we called for help with all our might. At that moment Dittmar\r\nreappeared, and by an unheard-of effort seized the end of a willow\r\nbranch that was hanging over the water; but the branch was not strong\r\nenough to resist, and our friend sank again, as though he had been\r\nstruck by apoplexy. Can you imagine the state in which we were, we his\r\nfriends, bending over the river, our fixed and haggard eyes trying to\r\npierce its depth? My God, my God! how was it we did not go mad?\r\n\r\n\"A great crowd, however, had run at our cries. For two hours they sought\r\nfar him with boats and drag-hooks; and at last they succeeded in drawing\r\nhis body from the gulf. Yesterday we bore it solemnly to the field of\r\nrest.\r\n\r\n\"Thus with the end of this spring has begun the serious summer of my\r\nlife. I greeted it in a grave and melancholy mood, and you behold me\r\nnow, if not consoled, at least strengthened by religion, which, thanks\r\nto the merits of Christ, gives me the assurance of meeting my friend in\r\nheaven, from the heights of which he will inspire me with strength to\r\nsupport the trials of this life; and now I do not desire anything more\r\nexcept to know you free from all anxiety in regard to me.\"\r\n\r\nInstead of serving to unite the two groups of students in a common\r\ngrief, this accident, on the contrary, did but intensify their hatred of\r\neach other. Among the first persons who ran up at the cries of Sand and\r\nhis companion was a member of the Landmannschaft who could swim, but\r\ninstead of going to Dittmar’s assistance he exclaimed, \"It seems that we\r\nshall get rid of one of these dogs of Burschen; thank God!\"\r\nNotwithstanding this manifestation of hatred, which, indeed, might be\r\nthat of an individual and not of the whole body, the Burschen invited\r\ntheir enemies to be present at Dittmar’s funeral. A brutal refusal, and\r\na threat to disturb the ceremony by insults to the corpse, formed their\r\nsole reply. The Burschen then warned the authorities, who took suitable\r\nmeasures, and all Dittmar’s friends followed his coffin sword in hand.\r\nBeholding this calm but resolute demonstration, the Landmannschaft did\r\nnot dare to carry out their threat, and contented themselves with\r\ninsulting the procession by laughs and songs.\r\n\r\nSand wrote in his journal:\r\n\r\n\"Dittmar is a great loss to all of us, and particularly to me; he gave\r\nme the overflow of his strength and life; he stopped, as it were, with\r\nan embankment, the part of my character that is irresolute and\r\nundecided. From him it is that I have learned not to dread the\r\napproaching storm, and to know how to fight and die.\"\r\n\r\nSome days after the funeral Sand had a quarrel about Dittmar with one of\r\nhis former friends, who had passed over from the Burschen to the\r\nLandmannschaft, and who had made himself conspicuous at the time of the\r\nfuneral by his indecent hilarity. It was decided that they should fight\r\nthe next day, and on the same day Sand wrote in his journal.\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow I am to fight with P. G.; yet Thou knowest, O my God, what\r\ngreat friends we formerly were, except for a certain mistrust with which\r\nhis coldness always inspired me; but on this occasion his odious conduct\r\nhas caused me to descend from the tenderest pity to the profoundest\r\nhatred.\r\n\r\n\"My God, do not withdraw Thy hand either from him or from me, since we\r\nare both fighting like men! Judge only by our two causes, and give the\r\nvictory to that which is the more just. If Thou shouldst call me before\r\nThy supreme tribunal, I know very well that I should appear burdened\r\nwith an eternal malediction; and indeed it is not upon myself that I\r\nreckon but upon the merits of our Saviour Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\n\"Come what may, be praised and blessed, O my God!\r\n\r\n\"My dear parents, brothers, and friends, I commend you to the protection\r\nof God.\"\r\n\r\nSand waited in vain for two hours next day: his adversary did not come\r\nto the meeting place.\r\n\r\nThe loss of Dittmar, however, by no means produced the result upon Sand\r\nthat might have been expected, and that he himself seems to indicate in\r\nthe regrets he expressed for him. Deprived of that strong soul upon\r\nwhich he rested, Sand understood that it was his task by redoubled\r\nenergy to make the death of Dittmar less fatal to his party. And indeed\r\nhe continued singly the work of drawing in recruits which they had been\r\ncarrying on together, and the patriotic conspiracy was not for a moment\r\nimpeded.\r\n\r\nThe holidays came, and Sand left Erlangen to return no more. From\r\nWonsiedel he was to proceed to Jena, in order to complete his\r\ntheological studies there. After some days spent with his family, and\r\nindicated in his journal as happy, Sand went to his new place of abode,\r\nwhere he arrived some time before the festival of the Wartburg. This\r\nfestival, established to celebrate the anniversary of the battle of\r\nLeipzig, was regarded as a solemnity throughout Germany, and although\r\nthe princes well knew that it was a centre for the annual renewal of\r\naffiliation to the various societies, they dared not forbid it. Indeed,\r\nthe manifesto of the Teutonic Association was exhibited at this festival\r\nand signed by more than two thousand deputies from different\r\nuniversities in Germany. This was a day of joy for Sand; for he found in\r\nthe midst of new friends a great number of old ones.\r\n\r\nThe Government, however, which had not ’dared to attack the Association\r\nby force, resolved to undermine it by opinion. M. de Stauren published a\r\nterrible document, attacking the societies, and founded, it was said,\r\nupon information furnished by Kotzebue. This publication made a great\r\nstir, not only at Jena, but throughout all Germany. Here is the trace of\r\nthis event that we find in Sand’s journal:—\r\n\r\n24th November \"Today, after working with much ease and assiduity, I went\r\nout about four with E. As we crossed the market-place we heard\r\nKotzebue’s new and venomous insult read. By what a fury that man is\r\npossessed against the Burschen and against all who love Germany!\"\r\n\r\nThus for the first time and in these terms Sand’s journal presents the\r\nname of the man who, eighteen months later, he was to slay.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th, in the evening, Sand writes again:\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow I shall set out courageously and joyfully from this place for\r\na pilgrimage to Wonsiedel; there I shall find my large-hearted mother\r\nand my tender sister Julia; there I shall cool my head and warm my\r\nheart. Probably I shall be present at my good Fritz’s marriage with\r\nLouisa, and at the baptism of my very dear Durchmith’s first-born. God,\r\nO my Father, as Thou hast been with me during my sad course, be with me\r\nstill on my happy road.\"\r\n\r\nThis journey did in fact greatly cheer Sand. Since Dittmar’s death his\r\nattacks of hypochondria had disappeared. While Dittmar lived he might\r\ndie; Dittmar being dead, it was his part to live.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of December he left Wonsiedel, to return to Jena, and on the\r\n31st of the same month he wrote this prayer in his journal.\r\n\r\n\"O merciful Saviour! I began this year with prayer, and in these last\r\ndays I have been subject to distraction and ill-disposed. When I look\r\nbackward, I find, alas! that I have not become better; but I have\r\nentered more profoundly into life, and, should occasion present, I now\r\nfeel strength to act.\r\n\r\n\"It is because Thou hast always been with me, Lord, even when I was not\r\nwith Thee.\"\r\n\r\nIf our readers have followed with some attention the different extracts\r\nfrom the journal that we have placed before them, they must have seen\r\nSand’s resolution gradually growing stronger and his brain becoming\r\nexcited. From the beginning of the year 1818, one feels his view, which\r\nlong was timid and wandering, taking in a wider horizon and fixing\r\nitself on a nobler aim. He is no longer ambitious of the pastor’s simple\r\nlife or of the narrow influence which he might gain in a little\r\ncommunity, and which, in his juvenile modesty, had seemed the height of\r\ngood fortune and happiness; it is now his native land, his German\r\npeople, nay, all humanity, which he embraces in his gigantic plans of\r\npolitical regeneration. Thus, on the flyleaf of his journal for the year\r\n1818, he writes:\r\n\r\n\"Lord, let me strengthen myself in the idea that I have conceived of the\r\ndeliverance of humanity by the holy sacrifice of Thy Son. Grant that I\r\nmay be a Christ of Germany, and that, like and through Jesus, I may be\r\nstrong and patient in suffering.\"\r\n\r\nBut the anti-republican pamphlets of Kotzebue increased in number and\r\ngained a fatal influence upon the minds of rulers. Nearly all the\r\npersons who were attacked in these pamphlets were known and esteemed at\r\nJena; and it may easily be comprehended what effects were produced by\r\nsuch insults upon these young heads and noble hearts, which carried\r\nconviction to the point of blindness and enthusiasm to that of\r\nfanaticism.\r\n\r\nThus, here is what Sand wrote in his diary on the 5th of May.\r\n\r\n\"Lord, what causes this melancholy anguish which has again taken\r\npossession of me? But a firm and constant will surmounts everything, and\r\nthe idea of the country gives joy and courage to the saddest and the\r\nweakest. When I think of that, I am always amazed that there is none\r\namong us found courageous enough to drive a knife into the breast of\r\nKotzebue or of any other traitor.\"\r\n\r\nStill dominated by the same thought, he continues thus on the 18th of\r\nMay:—\r\n\r\n\"A man is nothing in comparison with a nation; he is a unity compared\r\nwith millions, a minute compared with a century. A man, whom nothing\r\nprecedes and nothing follows, is born, lives, and dies in a longer or\r\nshorter time, which, relatively to eternity, hardly equals the duration\r\nof a lightning flash. A nation, on the contrary, is immortal.\"\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, however, amid these thoughts that bear the impress of\r\nthat political fatality which was driving him towards the deed of\r\nbloodshed, the kindly and joyous youth reappears. On the 24th of June he\r\nwrites to his mother:—\r\n\r\n\"I have received your long and beautiful letter, accompanied by the very\r\ncomplete and well-chosen outfit which you send me. The sight of this\r\nfine linen gave me back one of the joys of my childhood. These are fresh\r\nbenefits. My prayers never remain unfulfilled, and I have continual\r\ncause to thank you and God. I receive, all at once, shirts, two pairs of\r\nfine sheets, a present of your work, and of Julia’s and Caroline’s work,\r\ndainties and sweetmeats, so that I am still jumping with joy and I\r\nturned three times on my heels when I opened the little parcel. Receive\r\nthe thanks of my heart, and share, as giver, in the joy of him who has\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\n\"Today, however, is a very serious day, the last day of spring and the\r\nanniversary of that on which I lost my noble and good Dittmar. I am a\r\nprey to a thousand different and confused feelings; but I have only two\r\npassions left in me which remain upright and like two pillars of brass\r\nsupport this whole chaos—the thought of God and the love of my country.\"\r\n\r\nDuring all this time Sand’s life remains apparently calm and equal; the\r\ninward storm is calmed; he rejoices in his application to work and his\r\ncheerful temper. However, from time to time, he makes great complaints\r\nto himself of his propensity to love dainty food, which he does not\r\nalways find it possible to conquer. Then, in his self-contempt, he calls\r\nhimself \"fig-stomach\" or \"cake-stomach.\" But amid all this the religious\r\nand political exaltation and visits all the battlefields near to the\r\nroad that he follows. On the 18th of October he is back at Jena, where\r\nhe resumes his studies with more application than ever. It is among such\r\nuniversity studies that the year 1818 closes far him, and we should\r\nhardly suspect the terrible resolution which he has taken, were it not\r\nthat we find in his journal this last note, dated the 31st of December:\r\n\r\n\"I finish the last day of this year 1818, then, in a serious and solemn\r\nmood, and I have decided that the Christmas feast which has just gone by\r\nwill be the last Christmas feast that I shall celebrate. If anything is\r\nto come of our efforts, if the cause of humanity is to assume the upper\r\nhand in our country, if in this faithless epoch any noble feelings can\r\nspring up afresh and make way, it can only happen if the wretch, the\r\ntraitor, the seducer of youth, the infamous Kotzebue, falls! I am fully\r\nconvinced of this, and until I have accomplished the work upon which I\r\nhave resolved, I shall have no rest. Lord, Thou who knowest that I have\r\ndevoted my life to this great action, I only need, now that it is fixed\r\nin my mind, to beg of Thee true firmness and courage of soul.\"\r\n\r\nHere Sand’s diary ends; he had begun it to strengthen himself; he had\r\nreached his aim; he needed nothing more. From this moment he was\r\noccupied by nothing but this single idea, and he continued slowly to\r\nmature the plan in his head in order to familiarise himself with its\r\nexecution; but all the impressions arising from this thought remained in\r\nhis own mind, and none was manifested on the surface. To everyone else\r\nhe was the same; but for some little time past, a complete and unaltered\r\nserenity, accompanied by a visible and cheerful return of inclination\r\ntowards life, had been noticed in him. He had made no change in the\r\nhours or the duration of his studies; but he had begun to attend the\r\nanatomical classes very assiduously. One day he was seen to give even\r\nmore than his customary attention to a lesson in which the professor was\r\ndemonstrating the various functions of the heart; he examined with the\r\ngreatest care the place occupied by it in the chest, asking to have some\r\nof the demonstrations repeated two or three times, and when he went out,\r\nquestioning some of the young men who were following the medical\r\ncourses, about the susceptibility of the organ, which cannot receive\r\never so slight a blow without death ensuing from that blow: all this\r\nwith so perfect an indifference and calmness that no one about him\r\nconceived any suspicion.\r\n\r\nAnother day, A. S., one of his friends, came into his room. Sand, who\r\nhad heard him coming up, was standing by the table, with a paper-knife\r\nin his hand, waiting for him; directly the visitor came in, Sand flung\r\nhimself upon him, struck him lightly on the forehead; and then, as he\r\nput up his hands to ward off the blow, struck him rather more violently\r\nin the chest; then, satisfied with this experiment, said:—\r\n\r\n\"You see, when you want to kill a man, that is the way to do it; you\r\nthreaten the face, he puts up his hands, and while he does so you thrust\r\na dagger into his heart.\"\r\n\r\nThe two young men laughed heartily over this murderous demonstration,\r\nand A. S. related it that evening at the wine-shop as one of the\r\npeculiarities of character that were common in his friend. After the\r\nevent, the pantomime explained itself.\r\n\r\nThe month of March arrived. Sand became day by day calmer, more\r\naffectionate, and kinder; it might be thought that in the moment of\r\nleaving his friends for ever he wished to leave them an ineffaceable\r\nremembrance of him. At last he announced that on account of several\r\nfamily affairs he was about to undertake a little journey, and set about\r\nall his preparations with his usual care, but with a serenity never\r\npreviously seen in him. Up to that time he had continued to work as\r\nusual, not relaxing for an instant; for there was a possibility that\r\nKotzebue might die or be killed by somebody else before the term that\r\nSand had fixed to himself, and in that case he did not wish to have lost\r\ntime. On the 7th of March he invited all his friends to spend the\r\nevening with him, and announced his departure for the next day but one,\r\nthe 9th. All of them then proposed to him to escort him for some\r\nleagues, but Sand refused; he feared lest this demonstration, innocent\r\nthough it were, might compromise them later on. He set forth alone,\r\ntherefore, after having hired his lodgings for another half-year, in\r\norder to obviate any suspicion, and went by way of Erfurt and Eisenach,\r\nin order to visit the Wartburg. From that place he went to Frankfort,\r\nwhere he slept on the 17th, and on the morrow he continued his journey\r\nby way of Darmstadt. At last, on the 23rd, at nine in the morning, he\r\narrived at the top of the little hill where we found him at the\r\nbeginning of this narrative. Throughout the journey he had been the\r\namiable and happy young man whom no one could see without liking.\r\n\r\nHaving reached Mannheim, he took a room at the Weinberg, and wrote his\r\nname as \"Henry\" in the visitors’ list. He immediately inquired where\r\nKotzebue lived. The councillor dwelt near the church of the Jesuits; his\r\nhouse was at the corner of a street, and though Sand’s informants could\r\nnot tell him exactly the letter, they assured him it was not possible to\r\nmistake the house. [At Mannheim houses are marked by letters, not by\r\nnumbers.]\r\n\r\nSand went at once to Kotzebue’s house: it was about ten o’clock; he was\r\ntold that the councillor went to walk for an hour or two every morning\r\nin the park of Mannheim. Sand inquired about the path in which he\r\ngenerally walked, and about the clothes he wore, for never having seen\r\nhim he could only recognise him by the description. Kotzebue chanced to\r\ntake another path. Sand walked about the park for an hour, but seeing no\r\none who corresponded to the description given him, went back to the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nKotzebue had come in, but was at breakfast and could not see him.\r\n\r\nSand went back to the Weinberg, and sat down to the midday table d’hote,\r\nwhere he dined with an appearance of such calmness, and even of such\r\nhappiness, that his conversation, which was now lively, now simple, and\r\nnow dignified, was remarked by everybody. At five in the afternoon he\r\nreturned a third time to the house of Kotzebue, who was giving a great\r\ndinner that day; but orders had been given to admit Sand. He was shown\r\ninto a little room opening out of the anteroom, and a moment after,\r\nKotzebue came in.\r\n\r\nSand then performed the drama which he had rehearsed upon his friend A.\r\nS. Kotzebue, finding his face threatened, put his hands up to it, and\r\nleft his breast exposed; Sand at once stabbed him to the heart; Kotzebue\r\ngave one cry, staggered, and fell back into an arm-chair: he was dead.\r\n\r\nAt the cry a little girl of six years old ran in, one of those charming\r\nGerman children, with the faces of cherubs, blue-eyed, with long flowing\r\nhair. She flung herself upon the body of Kotzebue, calling her father\r\nwith piercing cries. Sand, standing at the door, could not endure this\r\nsight, and without going farther, he thrust the dagger, still covered\r\nwith Kotzebue’s blood, up to the hilt into his own breast. Then, seeing\r\nto his surprise that notwithstanding the terrible wound—he had just\r\ngiven himself he did not feel the approach of death, and not wishing to\r\nfall alive into the hands of the servants who were running in, he rushed\r\nto the staircase. The persons who were invited were just coming in;\r\nthey, seeing a young man, pale and bleeding with a knife in his breast,\r\nuttered loud cries, and stood aside, instead of stopping him. Sand\r\ntherefore passed down the staircase and reached the street below; ten\r\npaces off, a patrol was passing, on the way to relieve the sentinels at\r\nthe castle; Sand thought these men had been summoned by the cries that\r\nfollowed him; he threw himself on his knees in the middle of the street,\r\nand said, \"Father, receive my soul!\"\r\n\r\nThen, drawing the knife from the wound, he gave himself a second blow\r\nbelow the former, and fell insensible.\r\n\r\nSand was carried to the hospital and guarded with the utmost strictness;\r\nthe wounds were serious, but, thanks to the skill of the physicians who\r\nwere called in, were not mortal; one of them even healed eventually; but\r\nas to the second, the blade having gone between the costal pleura and\r\nthe pulmonary pleura, an effusion of blood occurred between the two\r\nlayers, so that, instead of closing the wound, it was kept carefully\r\nopen, in order that the blood extravasated during the night might be\r\ndrawn off every morning by means of a pump, as is done in the operation\r\nfor empyaemia.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these cares, Sand was for three months between life and\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the 26th of March, the news of Kotzebue’s assassination came\r\nfrom Mannheim to Jena, the academic senate caused Sand’s room to be\r\nopened, and found two letters—one addressed to his friends of the\r\nBurschenschaft, in which he declared that he no longer belonged to their\r\nsociety, since he did not wish that their brotherhood should include a\r\nman about to die on the scaffold. The other letter, which bore this\r\nsuperscription, \"To my nearest and dearest,\" was an exact account of\r\nwhat he meant to do, and the motives which had made him determine upon\r\nthis act. Though the letter is a little long, it is so solemn and so\r\nantique in spirit, that we do not hesitate to present it in its entirety\r\nto our readers:—\r\n\r\n\"To all my own \"Loyal and eternally cherished souls\r\n\r\n\"Why add still further to your sadness? I asked myself, and I hesitated\r\nto write to you; but my silence would have wounded the religion of the\r\nheart; and the deeper a grief the more it needs, before it can be\r\nblotted out, to drain to the dregs its cup of bitterness. Forth from my\r\nagonised breast, then; forth, long and cruel torment of a last\r\nconversation, which alone, however, when sincere, can alleviate the pain\r\nof parting.\r\n\r\n\"This letter brings you the last farewell of your son and your brother.\r\n\r\n\"The greatest misfortune of life for any generous heart is to see the\r\ncause of God stopped short in its developments by our fault; and the\r\nmost dishonouring infamy would be to suffer that the fine things\r\nacquired bravely by thousands of men, and for which thousands of men\r\nhave joyfully sacrificed themselves, should be no more than a transient\r\ndream, without real and positive consequences. The resurrection of our\r\nGerman life was begun in these last twenty years, and particularly in\r\nthe sacred year 1813, with a courage inspired by God. But now the house\r\nof our fathers is shaken from the summit to the base. Forward! let us\r\nraise it, new and fair, and such as the true temple of the true God\r\nshould be.\r\n\r\n\"Small is the number of those who resist, and who wish to oppose\r\nthemselves as a dyke against the torrent of the progress of higher\r\nhumanity among the German people. Why should vast whole masses bow\r\nbeneath the yoke of a perverse minority? And why, scarcely healed,\r\nshould we fall back into a worse disease than that which we are leaving\r\nbehind?\r\n\r\n\"Many of these seducers, and those are the most infamous, are playing\r\nthe game of corruption with us; among them is Kotzebue, the most cunning\r\nand the worst of all, a real talking machine emitting all sorts of\r\ndetestable speech and pernicious advice. His voice is skillful in\r\nremoving from us all anger and bitterness against the most unjust\r\nmeasures, and is just such as kings require to put us to sleep again in\r\nthat old hazy slumber which is the death of nations. Every day he\r\nodiously betrays his country, and nevertheless, despite his treason,\r\nremains an idol for half Germany, which, dazzled by him, accepts\r\nunresisting the poison poured out by him in his periodic pamphlets,\r\nwrapped up and protected as he is by the seductive mantle of a great\r\npoetic reputation. Incited by him, the princes of Germany, who have\r\nforgotten their promises, will allow nothing free or good to be\r\naccomplished; or if anything of the kind is accomplished in spite of\r\nthem, they will league themselves with the French to annihilate it. That\r\nthe history of our time may not be covered with eternal ignominy, it is\r\nnecessary that he should fall.\r\n\r\n\"I have always said that if we wish to find a great and supreme remedy\r\nfor the state of abasement in which we are, none must shrink from combat\r\nnor from suffering; and the real liberty of the German people will only\r\nbe assured when the good citizen sets himself or some other stake upon\r\nthe game, and when every true son of the country, prepared for the\r\nstruggle for justice, despises the good things of this world, and only\r\ndesires those celestial good things which death holds in charge.\r\n\r\n\"Who then will strike this miserable hireling, this venal traitor?\r\n\r\n\"I have long been waiting in fear, in prayer, and in tears—I who am not\r\nborn for murder—for some other to be beforehand with me, to set me free,\r\nand suffer me to continue my way along the sweet and peaceful path that\r\nI had chosen for myself. Well, despite my prayers and my tears, he who\r\nshould strike does not present himself; indeed, every man, like myself,\r\nhas a right to count upon some other, and everyone thus counting, every\r\nhour’s delay, but makes our state worse; for at any moment—and how deep\r\na shame would that be for us! Kotzebue may leave Germany, unpunished,\r\nand go to devour in Russia the treasures for which he has exchanged his\r\nhonour, his conscience, and his German name. Who can preserve us from\r\nthis shame, if every man, if I myself, do not feel strength to make\r\nmyself the chosen instrument of God’s justice? Therefore, forward! It\r\nshall be I who will courageously rush upon him (do not be alarmed), on\r\nhim, the loathsome seducer; it shall be I who will kill the traitor, so\r\nthat his misguiding voice, being extinguished, shall cease to lead us\r\nastray from the lessons of history and from the Spirit of God. An\r\nirresistible and solemn duty impels me to this deed, ever since I have\r\nrecognised to what high destinies the German; nation may attain during\r\nthis century, and ever since I have come to know the dastard and\r\nhypocrite who alone prevents it from reaching them; for me, as for every\r\nGerman who seeks the public good, this desire has became a strict and\r\nbinding necessity. May I, by this national vengeance, indicate to all\r\nupright and loyal consciences where the true danger lies, and save our\r\nvilified and calumniated societies from the imminent danger that\r\nthreatens them! May I, in short, spread terror among the cowardly and\r\nwicked, and courage and faith among the good! Speeches and writings lead\r\nto nothing; only actions work.\r\n\r\n\"I will act, therefore; and though driven violently away from my fair\r\ndreams of the future, I am none the less full of trust in God; I even\r\nexperience a celestial joy, now that, like the Hebrews when they sought\r\nthe promised land, I see traced before me, through darkness and death,\r\nthat road at the end of which I shall have paid my debt to my country.\r\n\r\n\"Farewell, then, faithful hearts: true, this early separation is hard;\r\ntrue, your hopes, like my wishes, are disappointed; but let us be\r\nconsoled by the primary thought that we have done what the voice of our\r\ncountry called upon us to do; that, you knew, is the principle according\r\nto which I have always lived. You will doubtless say among yourselves,\r\n’Yes, thanks to our sacrifices, he had learned to know life and to taste\r\nthe joys of earth, and he seemed: deeply to love his native country and\r\nthe humble estate to which he was called’. Alas, yes, that is true!\r\nUnder your protection, and amid your numberless sacrifices, my native\r\nland and life had become profoundly dear to me. Yes, thanks to you, I\r\nhave penetrated into the Eden of knowledge, and have lived the free life\r\nof thought; thanks to you, I have looked into history, and have then\r\nreturned to my own conscience to attach myself to the solid pillars of\r\nfaith in the Eternal.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I was to pass gently through this life as a preacher of the\r\ngospel; yes, in my constancy to my calling I was to be sheltered from\r\nthe storms of this existence. But would that suffice to avert the danger\r\nthat threatens Germany? And you yourselves, in your infinite love,\r\nshould you not rather push me on to risk my life for the good of all? So\r\nmany modern Greeks have fallen already to free their country from the\r\nyoke of the Turks, and have died almost without any result and without\r\nany hope; and yet thousands of fresh martyrs keep up their courage and\r\nare ready to fall in their turn; and should I, then, hesitate to die?\r\n\r\n\"That I do not recognise your love, or that your love is but a trifling\r\nconsideration with me, you will not believe. What else should impel me\r\nto die if not my devotion to you and to Germany, and the need of proving\r\nthis devotion to my family and my country?\r\n\r\n\"You, mother, will say, ’Why have I brought up a son whom I loved and\r\nwho loved me, for whom I have undergone a thousand cares and toils, who,\r\nthanks to my prayers and my example, was impressionable to good\r\ninfluences, and from whom, after my long and weary course, I hoped to\r\nreceive attentions like those which I have given him? Why does he now\r\nabandon me?’\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my kind and tender mother! Yes, you will perhaps say that; but\r\ncould not the mother of anyone else say the same, and everything go off\r\nthus in words when there is need to act for the country? And if no one\r\nwould act, what would become of that mother of us all who is called\r\nGermany?\r\n\r\n\"But no; such complaints are far from you, you noble woman! I understood\r\nyour appeal once before, and at this present hour, if no one came\r\nforward in the German cause, you yourself would urge me to the fight. I\r\nhave two brothers and two sisters before me, all noble and loyal. They\r\nwill remain to you, mother; and besides you will have for sons all the\r\nchildren of Germany who love their country.\r\n\r\n\"Every man has a destiny which he has to accomplish: mine is devoted to\r\nthe action that I am about to undertake; if I were to live another fifty\r\nyears, I could not live more happily than I have done lately. Farewell,\r\nmother: I commend you to the protection of God; may He raise you to that\r\njoy which misfortunes can no longer trouble! Take your grandchildren, to\r\nwhom I should so much have liked to be a loving friend, to the top of\r\nour beautiful mountains soon. There, on that altar raised by the Lord\r\nHimself in the midst of Germany, let them devote themselves, swearing to\r\ntake up the sword as soon as they have strength to lift it, and to lay\r\nit down only when our brethren are all united in liberty, when all\r\nGermans, having a liberal constitution; are great before the Lord,\r\npowerful against their neighbours, and united among themselves.\r\n\r\n\"May my country ever raise her happy gaze to Thee, Almighty Father! May\r\nThy blessing fall abundantly upon her harvests ready to be cut and her\r\narmies ready for battle, and recognising the blessings that Thou hast\r\nshowered upon us, may the German nation ever be first among nations to\r\nrise and uphold the cause of humanity, which is Thy image upon earth!\r\n\r\n\"Your eternally attached son, brother and friend, \"KARL-LUDWIG SAND.\r\n\"JENA, the beginning of March, 1819.\"\r\n\r\nSand, who, as we have said, had at first been taken to the hospital, was\r\nremoved at the end of three months to the prison at Mannheim, where the\r\ngovernor, Mr. G——, had caused a room to be prepared for him. There he\r\nremained two months longer in a state of extreme weakness: his left arm\r\nwas completely paralysed; his voice was very weak; every movement gave\r\nhim horrible pain, and thus it was not until the 11th of August—that is\r\nto say, five months after the event that we have narrated—that he was\r\nable to write to his family the following letter:—\r\n\r\n\"MY VERY DEAR PARENTS:—The grand-duke’s commission of inquiry informed\r\nme yesterday that it might be possible I should have the intense joy of\r\na visit from you, and that I might perhaps see you here and embrace\r\nyou—you, mother, and some of my brothers and sisters.\r\n\r\n\"Without being surprised at this fresh proof of your motherly love, I\r\nhave felt an ardent remembrance reawaken of the happy life that we spent\r\ngently together. Joy and grief, desire and sacrifice, agitate my heart\r\nviolently, and I have had to weigh these various impulses one against\r\nthe other, and with the force of reason, in order to resume mastery of\r\nmyself and to take a decision in regard to my wishes.\r\n\r\n\"The balance has inclined in the direction of sacrifice.\r\n\r\n\"You know, mother, how much joy and courage a look from your eyes, daily\r\nintercourse with you, and your pious and high-minded conversation, might\r\nbring me during my very short time. But you also know my position, and\r\nyou are too well acquainted with the natural course of all these painful\r\ninquiries, not to feel as I do, that such annoyance, continually\r\nrecurring, would greatly trouble the pleasure of our companionship, if\r\nit did not indeed succeed in entirely destroying it. Then, mother, after\r\nthe long and fatiguing journey that you would be obliged to make in\r\norder to see me, think of the terrible sorrow of the farewell when the\r\nmoment came to part in this world. Let us therefore abide by the\r\nsacrifice, according to God’s will, and let us yield ourselves only to\r\nthat sweet community of thought which distance cannot interrupt, in\r\nwhich I find my only joys, and which, in spite of men, will always be\r\ngranted us by the Lord, our Father.\r\n\r\n\"As for my physical state, I know nothing about it. You see, however,\r\nsince at last I am writing to you myself, that I have come past my first\r\nuncertainties. As for the rest, I know too little of the structure of my\r\nown body to give any opinion as to what my wounds may determine for it.\r\nExcept that a little strength has returned to me, its state is still the\r\nsame, and I endure it calmly and patiently; for God comes to my help,\r\nand gives me courage and firmness. He will help me, believe me, to find\r\nall the joys of the soul and to be strong in mind. Amen.\r\n\r\n\"May you live happy!—Your deeply respectful son, \"KARL-LUDWIG SAND.\"\r\n\r\nA month after this letter came tender answers from all the family. We\r\nwill quote only that of Sand’s mother, because it completes the idea\r\nwhich the reader may have formed already of this great-hearted woman, as\r\nher son always calls her.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR, INEXPRESSIBLY DEAR KARL,—How Sweet it was to me to see the\r\nwriting of your beloved hand after so long a time! No journey would have\r\nbeen so painful and no road so long as to prevent me from coming to you,\r\nand I would go, in deep and infinite love, to any end of the earth in\r\nthe mere hope of catching sight of you.\r\n\r\n\"But, as I well know both your tender affection and your profound\r\nanxiety for me, and as you give me, so firmly and upon such manly\r\nreflection, reasons against which I can say nothing, and which I can but\r\nhonour, it shall be, my well-beloved Karl, as you have wished and\r\ndecided. We will continue, without speech, to communicate our thoughts;\r\nbut be satisfied, nothing can separate us; I enfold you in my soul, and\r\nmy material thoughts watch over you.\r\n\r\n\"May this infinite love which upholds us, strengthens us, and leads us\r\nall to a better life, preserve, dear Karl, your courage and firmness.\r\n\r\n\"Farewell, and be invariably assured that I shall never cease to love\r\nyou strongly and deeply.\r\n\r\n\"Your faithful mother, who loves you to eternity.\"\r\n\r\nSand replied:—\r\n\r\nJanuary 1820, from my isle of Patmos. \"MY DEAR PARENTS, BROTHERS, AND\r\nSISTERS,—\r\n\r\n\"In the middle of the month of September last year I received, through\r\nthe grand-duke’s special commission of inquiry, whose humanity you have\r\nalready appreciated, your dear letters of the end of August and the\r\nbeginning of September, which had such magical influence that they\r\ninundated me with joy by transporting me into the inmost circle of your\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\n\"You, my tender father, you write to me on the sixty-seventh anniversary\r\nof your birth, and you bless me by the outpouring of your most tender\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n\"You, my well-beloved mother, you deign to promise the continuance of\r\nyour maternal affection, in which I have at all times constantly\r\nbelieved; and thus I have received the blessings of both of you, which,\r\nin my present position, will exercise a more beneficent influence upon\r\nme than any of the things that all the kings of the earth, united\r\ntogether, could grant me. Yes, you strengthen me abundantly by your\r\nblessed love, and I render thanks to you, my beloved parents, with that\r\nrespectful submission that my heart will always inculcate as the first\r\nduty of a son.\r\n\r\n\"But the greater your love and the more affectionate your letters, the\r\nmore do I suffer, I must acknowledge, from the voluntary sacrifice that\r\nwe have imposed upon ourselves in not seeing one another; and the only\r\nreason, my dear parents, why I have delayed to reply to you, was to give\r\nmyself time to recover the strength which I have lost.\r\n\r\n\"You too, dear brother-in-law and dear sister, assure me of your sincere\r\nand uninterrupted attachment. And yet, after the fright that I have\r\nspread among you all, you seem not to know exactly what to think of me;\r\nbut my heart, full of gratitude for your past kindness, comforts itself;\r\nfor your actions speak and tell me that, even if you wished no longer to\r\nlove me as I love you, you would not be able to do otherwise. These\r\nactions mean more to me at this hour than any possible protestations,\r\nnay, than even the tenderest words.\r\n\r\n\"And you also, my kind brother, you would have consented to hurry with\r\nour beloved mother to the shores of the Rhine, to this place where the\r\nreal links of the soul were welded between us, where we were doubly\r\nbrothers; but tell me, are you not really here, in thought and in\r\nspirit, when I consider the rich fountain of consolation brought me by\r\nyour cordial and tender letter?\r\n\r\n\"And, you, kind sister-in-law, as you showed yourself from the first, in\r\nyour delicate tenderness, a true sister, so I find you again at present.\r\nThere are still the same tender relations, still the same sisterly\r\naffection; your consolations, which emanate from a deep and submissive\r\npiety, have fallen refreshingly into the depths of my heart. But, dear\r\nsister-in-law, I must tell you, as well as the others, that you are too\r\nliberal towards me in dispensing your esteem and praises, and your\r\nexaggeration has cast me back face to face with my inmost judge, who has\r\nshown me in the mirror of my conscience the image of my every weakness.\r\n\r\n\"You, kind Julia, you desire nothing else but to save me from the fate\r\nthat awaits me; and you assure me in your own name and in that of you\r\nall, that you, like the others, would rejoice to endure it in my place;\r\nin that I recognise you fully, and I recognise, too, those sweet and\r\ntender relations in which we have been brought up from childhood. Oh, be\r\ncomforted, dear Julia; thanks to the protection of God, I promise you:\r\nthat it will be easy for me, much easier than I should have thought, to\r\nbear what falls to my lot. Receive, then, all of you, my warm and\r\nsincere thanks for having thus rejoiced my heart.\r\n\r\n\"Now that I know from these strengthening letters that, like the\r\nprodigal son, the love and goodness of my family are greater on my\r\nreturn than at my departure, I will, as carefully as possible, paint for\r\nyou my physical and moral state, and I pray God to supplement my words\r\nby His strength, so that my letter may contain an equivalent of what\r\nyours brought to me, and may help you to reach that state of calm and\r\nserenity to which I have myself attained.\r\n\r\n\"Hardened, by having gained power over myself, against the good and ill\r\nof this earth, you knew already that of late years I have lived only for\r\nmoral joys, and I must say that, touched by my efforts, doubtless, the\r\nLord, who is the sacred fount of all that is good, has rendered me apt\r\nin seeking them and in tasting them to the full. God is ever near me, as\r\nformerly, and I find in Him the sovereign principle of the creation of\r\nall things; in Him, our holy Father, not only consolation and strength,\r\nbut an unalterable Friend, full of the holiest love, who will accompany\r\nme in all places where I may need His consolations. Assuredly, if He had\r\nturned from me, or if I had turned away my eyes from Him, I should now\r\nfind myself very unfortunate and wretched; but by His grace, on the\r\ncontrary, lowly and weak creature as I am, He makes me strong and\r\npowerful against whatever can befall me.\r\n\r\n\"What I have hitherto revered as sacred, what I have desired as good\r\nwhat I have aspired to as heavenly, has in no respect changed now. And I\r\nthank God for it, for I should now be in great despair if I were\r\ncompelled to recognise that my heart had adored deceptive images and\r\nenwrapped itself in fugitive chimeras. Thus my faith in these ideas and\r\nmy pure love for them, guardian angels of my spirit as they are,\r\nincrease moment by moment, and will go on increasing to my end, and I\r\nhope that I may pass all the more easily from this world into eternity.\r\nI pass my silent life in Christian exaltation and humility, and I\r\nsometimes have those visions from above through which I have, from my\r\nbirth, adored heaven upon earth, and which give me power to raise myself\r\nto the Lord upon the eager wings of my prayers. My illness, though long,\r\npainful, and cruel, has always been sufficiently mastered by my will to\r\nlet me busy myself to some result with history, positive sciences, and\r\nthe finer parts of religious education, and when my suffering became\r\nmore violent and for a time interrupted these occupations, I struggled\r\nsuccessfully, nevertheless, against ennui; for the memories of the past,\r\nmy resignation to the present, and my faith in the future were rich\r\nenough and strong enough in me and round me to prevent my falling from\r\nmy terrestrial paradise. According to my principles, I would never, in\r\nthe position in which I am and in which I have placed myself, have been\r\nwilling to ask anything for my own comfort; but so much kindness and\r\ncare have been lavished upon me, with so much delicacy and\r\nhumanity,—which alas! I am unable to return—by every person with whom I\r\nhave been brought into contact, that wishes which I should not have\r\ndared to frame in the most private recesses of my heart have been more\r\nthan exceeded. I have never been so much overcome by bodily pains that I\r\ncould not say within myself, while I lifted my thoughts to heaven, ’Come\r\nwhat may of this ray.’ And great as these gains have been, I could not\r\ndream of comparing them with those sufferings of the soul that we feel\r\nso profoundly and poignantly in the recognition of our weaknesses and\r\nfaults.\r\n\r\n\"Moreover, these pains seldom now cause me to lose consciousness; the\r\nswelling and inflammation never made great headway, and the fever has\r\nalways been moderate, though for nearly ten months I have been forced to\r\nremain lying on my back, unable to raise myself, and although more than\r\nforty pints of matter have come from my chest at the place where the\r\nheart is. No, on the contrary, the wound, though still open, is in a\r\ngood state; and I owe that not only to the excellent nursing around me,\r\nbut also to the pure blood that I received from you, my mother. Thus I\r\nhave lacked neither earthly assistance nor heavenly encouragement. Thus,\r\non the anniversary of my birth, I had every reason—oh, not to curse the\r\nhour in which I was born, but, on the contrary, after serious\r\ncontemplation of the world, to thank God and you, my dear parents, for\r\nthe life that you have given me! I celebrated it, on the 18th of\r\nOctober, by a peaceful and ardent submission to the holy will of God. On\r\nChristmas Day I tried to put myself into the temper of children who are\r\ndevoted to the Lord; and with God’s help the new year will pass like its\r\npredecessor, in bodily pain, perhaps, but certainly in spiritual joy.\r\nAnd with this wish, the only one that I form, I address myself to you,\r\nmy dear parents, and to you and yours, my dear brothers and sisters.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot hope to see a twenty-fifth new year; so may the prayer that I\r\nhave just made be granted! May this picture of my present state afford\r\nyou some tranquillity, and may this letter that I write to you from the\r\ndepths of my heart not only prove to you that I am not unworthy of the\r\ninexpressible love that you all display, but, on the contrary, ensure\r\nthis love to me for eternity.\r\n\r\n\"Within the last few days I have also received your dear letter of the\r\n2nd of December, my kind mother, and the grand-duke’s commission has\r\ndeigned to let me also read my kind brother’s letter which accompanied\r\nyours. You give me the best of news in regard to the health of all of\r\nyou, and send me preserved fruits from our dear home. I thank you for\r\nthem from the bottom of my heart. What causes me most joy in the matter\r\nis that you have been solicitously busy about me in summer as in winter,\r\nand that you and my dear Julia gathered them and prepared them for me at\r\nhome, and I abandon my whole soul to that sweet enjoyment.\r\n\r\n\"I rejoice sincerely at my little cousin’s coming into the world; I\r\njoyfully congratulate the good parents and the grandparents; I transport\r\nmyself, for his baptism, into that beloved parish, where I offer him my\r\naffection as his Christian brother, and call down on him all the\r\nblessings of heaven.\r\n\r\n\"We shall be obliged, I think, to give up this correspondence, so as not\r\nto inconvenience the grand-duke’s commission. I finish, therefore, by\r\nassuring you, once more, but for the last time, perhaps, of my profound\r\nfilial submission and of my fraternal affection.—Your most tenderly\r\nattached \"KARL-LUDWIG SAND.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, from that moment all correspondence between Karl and his family\r\nceased, and he only wrote to them, when he knew his fate, one more\r\nletter, which we shall see later on.\r\n\r\nWe have seen by what attentions Sand was surrounded; their humanity\r\nnever flagged for an instant. It is the truth, too, that no one saw in\r\nhim an ordinary murderer, that many pitied him under their breath, and\r\nthat some excused him aloud. The very commission appointed by the\r\ngrand-duke prolonged the affair as much as possible; for the severity of\r\nSand’s wounds had at first given rise to the belief that there would be\r\nno need of calling in the executioner, and the commission was well\r\npleased that God should have undertaken the execution of the judgment.\r\nBut these expectations were deceived: the skill of the doctor defeated,\r\nnot indeed the wound, but death: Sand did not recover, but he remained\r\nalive; and it began to be evident that it would be needful to kill him.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the Emperor Alexander, who had appointed Kotzebue his\r\ncouncillor, and who was under no misapprehension as to the cause of the\r\nmurder, urgently demanded that justice should take its course. The\r\ncommission of inquiry was therefore obliged to set to work; but as its\r\nmembers were sincerely desirous of having some pretext to delay their\r\nproceedings, they ordered that a physician from Heidelberg should visit\r\nSand and make an exact report upon his case; as Sand was kept lying down\r\nand as he could not be executed in his bed, they hoped that the\r\nphysician’s report, by declaring it impossible for the prisoner to rise,\r\nwould come to their assistance and necessitate a further respite.\r\n\r\nThe chosen doctor came accordingly to Mannheim, and introducing himself\r\nto Sand as though attracted by the interest that he inspired, asked him\r\nwhether he did not feel somewhat better, and whether it would be\r\nimpossible to rise. Sand looked at him for an instant, and then said,\r\nwith a smile—\r\n\r\n\"I understand, sir; they wish to know whether I am strong enough to\r\nmount a scaffold: I know nothing about it myself, but we will make the\r\nexperiment together.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words he rose, and accomplishing, with superhuman courage,\r\nwhat he had not attempted for fourteen months, walked twice round the\r\nroom, came back to his bed, upon which he seated himself, and said:\r\n\r\n\"You see, sir, I am strong enough; it would therefore be wasting\r\nprecious time to keep my judges longer about my affair; so let them\r\ndeliver their judgment, for nothing now prevents its execution.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor made his report; there was no way of retreat; Russia was\r\nbecoming more and more pressing, and an the 5th of May 1820 the high\r\ncourt of justice delivered the following judgment, which was confirmed\r\non the 12th by His Royal Highness the Grand-Duke of Baden:\r\n\r\n\"In the matters under investigation and after administration of the\r\ninterrogatory and hearing the defences, and considering the united\r\nopinions of the court of justice at Mannheim and the further\r\nconsultations of the court of justice which declare the accused, Karl\r\nSand of Wonsiedel, guilty of murder, even on his own confession, upon\r\nthe person of the Russian imperial Councillor of State, Kotzebue; it is\r\nordered accordingly, for his just punishment and for an example that may\r\ndeter other people, that he is to be put from life to death by the\r\nsword.\r\n\r\n\"All the costs of these investigations, including these occasioned by\r\nhis public execution, will be defrayed from the funds of the law\r\ndepartment, on account of his want of means.\"\r\n\r\nWe see that, though it condemned the accused to death, which indeed\r\ncould hardly be avoided, the sentence was both in form and substance as\r\nmild as possible, since, though Sand was convicted, his poor family was\r\nnot reduced by the expenses of a long and costly trial to complete ruin.\r\n\r\nFive days were still allowed to elapse, and the verdict was not\r\nannounced until the 17th. When Sand was informed that two councillors of\r\njustice were at the door, he guessed that they were coming to read his\r\nsentence to him; he asked a moment to rise, which he had done but once\r\nbefore, in the instance already narrated, during fourteen months. And\r\nindeed he was so weak that he could not stand to hear the sentence, and\r\nafter having greeted the deputation that death sent to him, he asked to\r\nsit down, saying that he did so not from cowardice of soul but from\r\nweakness of body; then he added, \"You are welcome, gentlemen; for I have\r\nsuffered so much for fourteen months past that you come to me as angels\r\nof deliverance.\"\r\n\r\nHe heard the sentence quite unaffectedly and with a gentle smile upon\r\nhis lips; then, when the reading was finished, he said—\r\n\r\n\"I look for no better fate, gentlemen, and when, more than a year ago, I\r\npaused on the little hill that overlooks the town, I saw beforehand the\r\nplace where my grave would be; and so I ought to thank God and man for\r\nhaving prolonged my existence up to to-day.\"\r\n\r\nThe councillors withdrew; Sand stood up a second time to greet them on\r\ntheir departure, as he had done on their entrance; then he sat down\r\nagain pensively in his chair, by which Mr. G, the governor of the\r\nprison, was standing. After a moment of silence, a tear appeared at each\r\nof the condemned man’s eyelids, and ran down his cheeks; then, turning\r\nsuddenly to Mr. G——, whom he liked very much, he said, \"I hope that my\r\nparents would rather see me die by this violent death than of some slow\r\nand shameful disease. As for me, I am glad that I shall soon hear the\r\nhour strike in which my death will satisfy those who hate me, and those\r\nwhom, according to my principles, I ought to hate.\"\r\n\r\nThen he wrote to his family.\r\n\r\n\"MANNHEIM\r\n\r\n\"17th of the month of spring, 1820\r\n\r\n\"DEAR PARENTS, BROTHERS, AND SISTERS,—You should have received my last\r\nletters through the grand-duke’s commission; in them I answered yours,\r\nand tried to console you for my position by describing the state of my\r\nsoul as it is, the contempt to which I have attained for everything\r\nfragile and earthly, and by which one must necessarily be overcome when\r\nsuch matters are weighed against the fulfilment of an idea, or that\r\nintellectual liberty which alone can nourish the soul; in a word, I\r\ntried to console you by the assurance that the feelings, principles, and\r\nconvictions of which I formerly spoke are faithfully preserved in me and\r\nhave remained exactly the same; but I am sure all this was an\r\nunnecessary precaution on my part, for there was never a time when you\r\nasked anything else of me than to have God before my eyes and in my\r\nheart; and you have seen how, under your guidance, this precept so\r\npassed into my soul that it became my sole object of happiness for this\r\nworld and the next; no doubt, as He was in and near me, God will be in\r\nand near you at the moment when this letter brings you the news of my\r\nsentence. I die willingly, and the Lord will give me strength to die as\r\none ought to die.\r\n\r\n\"I write to you perfectly quiet and calm about all things, and I hope\r\nthat your lives too will pass calmly and tranquilly until the moment\r\nwhen our souls meet again full of fresh force to love one another and to\r\nshare eternal happiness together.\r\n\r\n\"As for me, such as I have lived as long as I have known myself—that is\r\nto say, in a serenity full of celestial desires and a courageous and\r\nindefatigable love of liberty, such I am about to die.\r\n\r\n\"May God be with you and with me!—Your son, brother, and friend,\r\n\"KARL-LUDWIG SAND.\"\r\n\r\nFrom that moment his serenity remained un troubled; during the whole day\r\nhe talked more gaily than usual, slept well, did not awake until\r\nhalf-past seven, said that he felt stronger, and thanked God for\r\nvisiting him thus.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the verdict had been known since the day before, and it\r\nhad been learned that the execution was fixed for the 20th of May—that\r\nis to say, three full days after the sentence had been read to the\r\naccused.\r\n\r\nHenceforward, with Sand’s permission, persons who wished to speak to him\r\nand whom he was not reluctant to see, were admitted: three among these\r\npaid him long and noteworthy visits.\r\n\r\nOne was Major Holzungen, of the Baden army, who was in command of the\r\npatrol that had arrested him, or rather picked him up, dying, and\r\ncarried him to the hospital. He asked him whether he recognised him, and\r\nSand’s head was so clear when he stabbed himself, that although he saw\r\nthe major only for a moment and had never seen him again since, he\r\nremembered the minutest details of the costume which he had been wearing\r\nfourteen months previously, and which was the full-dress uniform. When\r\nthe talk fell upon the death to which Sand was to submit at so early an\r\nage, the major pitied him; but Sand answered, with a smile, \"There is\r\nonly one difference between you and me, major; it is that I shall die\r\nfor my convictions, and you will die for someone else’s convictions.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the major came a young student from Jena whom Sand had known at\r\nthe university. He happened to be in the duchy of Baden and wished to\r\nvisit him. Their recognition was touching, and the student wept much;\r\nbut Sand consoled him with his usual calmness and serenity.\r\n\r\nThen a workman asked to be admitted to see Sand, on the plea that he had\r\nbeen his schoolfellow at Wonsiedel, and although he did not remember his\r\nname, he ordered him to be let in: the workman reminded him that he had\r\nbeen one of the little army that Sand had commanded on the day of the\r\nassault of St. Catherine’s tower. This indication guided Sand, who\r\nrecognised him perfectly, and then spoke with tender affection of his\r\nnative place and his dear mountains. He further charged him to greet his\r\nfamily, and to beg his mother, father, brothers, and sisters once more\r\nnot to be grieved on his account, since the messenger who undertook to\r\ndeliver his last wards could testify in how calm and joyful a temper he\r\nwas awaiting death.\r\n\r\nTo this workman succeeded one of the guests whom Sand had met on the\r\nstaircase directly after Kotzebue’s death. He asked him whether he\r\nacknowledged his crime and whether he felt any repentance. Sand replied,\r\n\"I had thought about it during a whole year. I have been thinking of it\r\nfor fourteen months, and my opinion has never varied in any respect: I\r\ndid what I should have done.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of this last visitor, Sand sent for Mr. G——, the\r\ngovernor of the prison, and told him that he should like to talk to the\r\nexecutioner before the execution, since he wished to ask for\r\ninstructions as to how he should hold himself so as to render the\r\noperation most certain and easy. Mr. G——made some objections, but Sand\r\ninsisted with his usual gentleness, and Mr. G——at last promised that the\r\nman in question should be asked to call at the prison as soon as he\r\narrived from Heidelberg, where he lived.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the day was spent in seeing more visitors and in\r\nphilosophical and moral talks, in which Sand developed his social and\r\nreligious theories with a lucidity of expression and an elevation of\r\nthought such as he had, perhaps, never before shown. The governor of the\r\nprison from whom I heard these details, told me that he should all his\r\nlife regret that he did not know shorthand, so that he might have noted\r\nall these thoughts, which would have formed a pendant to the Phaedo.\r\n\r\nNight came. Sand spent part of the evening writing; it is thought that\r\nhe was composing a poem; but no doubt he burned it, for no trace of it\r\nwas found. At eleven he went to bed, and slept until six in the morning.\r\nNext day he bore the dressing of his wound, which was always very\r\npainful, with extraordinary courage, without fainting, as he sometimes\r\ndid, and without suffering a single complaint to escape him: he had\r\nspoken the truth; in the presence of death God gave him the grace of\r\nallowing his strength to return. The operation was over; Sand was lying\r\ndown as usual, and Mr. G——was sitting on the foot of his bed, when the\r\ndoor opened and a man came in and bowed to Sand and to Mr. G——. The\r\ngovernor of the prison immediately stood up, and said to Sand in a voice\r\nthe emotion of which he could not conceal, \"The person who is bowing to\r\nyou is Mr. Widemann of Heidelberg, to whom you wished to speak.\"\r\n\r\nThen Sand’s face was lighted up by a strange joy; he sat up and said,\r\n\"Sir, you are welcome.\" Then, making his visitor sit down by his bed,\r\nand taking his hand, he began to thank him for being so obliging, and\r\nspoke in so intense a tone and so gentle a voice, that Mr. Widemann,\r\ndeeply moved, could not answer. Sand encouraged him to speak and to give\r\nhim the details for which he wished, and in order to reassure him, said,\r\n\"Be firm, sir; for I, on my part, will not fail you: I will not move;\r\nand even if you should need two or three strokes to separate my head\r\nfrom my body, as I am told is sometimes the case, do not be troubled on\r\nthat account.\"\r\n\r\nThen Sand rose, leaning on Mr. G——, to go through with the executioner\r\nthe strange and terrible rehearsal of the drama in which he was to play\r\nthe leading part on the morrow. Mr. Widemann made him sit in a chair and\r\ntake the required position, and went into all the details of the\r\nexecution with him. Then Sand, perfectly instructed, begged him not to\r\nhurry and to take his time. Then he thanked him beforehand; \"for,\" added\r\nhe, \"afterwards I shall not be able.\" Then Sand returned to his bed,\r\nleaving the executioner paler and more trembling than himself. All these\r\ndetails have been preserved by Mr. G——; for as to the executioner, his\r\nemotion was so great that he could remember nothing.\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Widemann, three clergymen were introduced, with whom Sand\r\nconversed upon religious matters: one of them stayed six hours with him,\r\nand on leaving him told him that he was commissioned to obtain from him\r\na promise of not speaking to the people at the place of execution. Sand\r\ngave the promise, and added, \"Even if I desired to do so, my voice has\r\nbecome so weak that people could not hear it.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the scaffold was being erected in the meadow that extends on\r\nthe left of the road to Heidelberg. It was a platform five to six feet\r\nhigh and ten feet wide each way. As it was expected that, thanks to the\r\ninterest inspired by the prisoner and to the nearness to Whitsuntide,\r\nthe crowd would be immense, and as some movement from the universities\r\nwas apprehended, the prison guards had been trebled, and General\r\nNeustein had been ordered to Mannheim from Carlsruhe, with twelve\r\nhundred infantry, three hundred and fifty cavalry, and a company of\r\nartillery with guns.\r\n\r\nOn, the afternoon of the 19th there arrived, as had been foreseen, so\r\nmany students, who took up their abode in the neighbouring villages,\r\nthat it was decided to put forward the hour of the execution, and to let\r\nit take place at five in the morning instead of at eleven, as had been\r\narranged. But Sand’s consent was necessary for this; for he could not be\r\nexecuted until three full days after the reading of his sentence, and as\r\nthe sentence had not been read to him till half-past ten Sand had a\r\nright to live till eleven o’clock.\r\n\r\nBefore four in the morning the officials went into the condemned man’s\r\nroom; he was sleeping so soundly that they were obliged to awaken him.\r\nHe opened his eyes with a smile, as was his custom, and guessing why\r\nthey came, asked, \"Can I have slept so well that it is already eleven in\r\nthe morning?\" They told him that it was not, but that they had come to\r\nask his permission to put forward the time; for, they told him, some\r\ncollision between the students and the soldiers was feared, and as the\r\nmilitary preparations were very thorough, such a collision could not be\r\notherwise than fatal to his friends. Sand answered that he was ready\r\nthat very moment, and only asked time enough to take a bath, as the\r\nancients were accustomed to do before going into battle. But as the\r\nverbal authorisation which he had given was not sufficient, a pen and\r\npaper were given to Sand, and he wrote, with a steady hand and in his\r\nusual writing:\r\n\r\n\"I thank the authorities of Mannheim for anticipating my most eager\r\nwishes by making my execution six hours earlier.\r\n\r\n\"Sit nomen Domini benedictum.\r\n\r\n\"From the prison room, May 20th, day of my deliverance. \"KARL-LUDWIG\r\nSAND.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Sand had given these two lines to the recorder, the physician came\r\nto him to dress his wound, as usual. Sand looked at him with a smile,\r\nand then asked, \"Is it really worth the trouble?\"\r\n\r\n\"You will be stronger for it,\" answered the physician.\r\n\r\n\"Then do it,\" said Sand.\r\n\r\nA bath was brought. Sand lay down in it, and had his long and beautiful\r\nhair arranged with the greatest care; then his toilet being completed,\r\nhe put on a frock-coat of the German shape—that is to say, short and\r\nwith the shirt collar turned back aver the shoulders, close white\r\ntrousers, and high boots. Then Sand seated himself on his bed and prayed\r\nsome time in a low voice with the clergy; then, when he had finished, he\r\nsaid these two lines of Korner’s:\r\n\r\n    \"All that is earthly is ended,\r\n     And the life of heaven begins.\"\r\n\r\nHe next took leave of the physician and the priests, saying to them, \"Do\r\nnot attribute the emotion of my voice to weakness but to gratitude.\"\r\nThen, upon these gentlemen offering to accompany him to the scaffold, he\r\nsaid, \"There is no need; I am perfectly prepared, at peace with God and\r\nwith my conscience. Besides, am I not almost a Churchman myself?\" And\r\nwhen one of them asked whether he was not going out of life in a spirit\r\nof hatred, he returned, \"Why, good heavens! have I ever felt any?\"\r\n\r\nAn increasing noise was audible from the street, and Sand said again\r\nthat he was at their disposal and that he was ready. At this moment the\r\nexecutioner came in with his two assistants; he was dressed in a long\r\nwadded black coat, beneath which he hid his sword. Sand offered him his\r\nhand affectionately; and as Mr. Widemann, embarrassed by the sword which\r\nhe wished to keep Sand from seeing, did not venture to come forward,\r\nSand said to him, \"Come along and show me your sword; I have never seen\r\none of the kind, and am curious to know what it is like.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Widemann, pale and trembling, presented the weapon to him; Sand\r\nexamined it attentively, and tried the edge with his finger.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" said he, \"the blade is good; do not tremble, and all will go\r\nwell.\" Then, turning to Mr. G——, who was weeping, he said to him, \"You\r\nwill be good enough, will you not, to do me the service of leading me to\r\nthe scaffold?\"\r\n\r\nMr. G——made a sign of assent with his head, for he could not answer.\r\nSand took his arm, and spoke for the third time, saying once more,\r\n\"Well, what are you waiting for, gentlemen? I am ready.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the courtyard, Sand saw all the prisoners weeping at\r\ntheir windows. Although he had never seen them, they were old friends of\r\nhis; for every time they passed his door, knowing that the student who\r\nhad killed Kotzebue lay within, they used to lift their chain, that he\r\nmight not be disturbed by the noise.\r\n\r\nAll Mannheim was in the streets that led to the place of execution, and\r\nmany patrols were passing up and down. On the day when the sentence was\r\nannounced the whole town had been sought through for a chaise in which\r\nto convey Sand to the scaffold, but no one, not even the coach-builders,\r\nwould either let one out or sell one; and it had been necessary,\r\ntherefore, to buy one at Heidelberg without saying for what purpose.\r\n\r\nSand found this chaise in the courtyard, and got into it with Mr. G——.\r\nTurning to him, he whispered in his ear, \"Sir, if you see me turn pale,\r\nspeak my name to me, my name only, do you hear? That will be enough.\"\r\n\r\nThe prison gate was opened, and Sand was seen; then every voice cried\r\nwith one impulse, \"Farewell, Sand, farewell!\"\r\n\r\nAnd at the same time flowers, some of which fell into the carriage, were\r\nthrown by the crowd that thronged the street, and from the windows. At\r\nthese friendly cries and at this spectacle, Sand, who until then had\r\nshown no moment of weakness, felt tears rising in spite of himself, and\r\nwhile he returned the greetings made to him on all sides, he murmured in\r\na low voice, \"O my God, give me courage!\"\r\n\r\nThis first outburst over, the procession set out amid deep silence; only\r\nnow and again some single voice would call out, \"Farewell, Sand!\" and a\r\nhandkerchief waved by some hand that rose out of the crowd would show\r\nfrom what point the last call came. On each side of the chaise walked\r\ntwo of the prison officials, and behind the chaise came a second\r\nconveyance with the municipal authorities.\r\n\r\nThe air was very cold: it had rained all night, and the dark and cloudy\r\nsky seemed to share in the general sadness. Sand, too weak to remain\r\nsitting up, was half lying upon the shoulder of Mr. G——-, his companion;\r\nhis face was gentle, calm and full of pain; his brow free and open, his\r\nfeatures, interesting though without regular beauty, seemed to have aged\r\nby several years during the fourteen months of suffering that had just\r\nelapsed. The chaise at last reached the place of execution, which was\r\nsurrounded by a battalion of infantry; Sand lowered his eyes from heaven\r\nto earth and saw the scaffold. At this sight he smiled gently, and as he\r\nleft the carriage he said, \"Well, God has given me strength so far.\"\r\n\r\nThe governor of the prison and the chief officials lifted him that he\r\nmight go up the steps. During that short ascent pain kept him bowed, but\r\nwhen he had reached the top he stood erect again, saying, \"Here then is\r\nthe place where I am to die!\"\r\n\r\nThen before he came to the chair on which he was to be seated for the\r\nexecution, he turned his eyes towards Mannheim, and his gaze travelled\r\nover all the throng that surrounded him; at that moment a ray of\r\nsunshine broke through the clouds. Sand greeted it with a smile and sat\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nThen, as, according to the orders given, his sentence was to be read to\r\nhim a second time, he was asked whether he felt strong enough to hear it\r\nstanding. Sand answered that he would try, and that if his physical\r\nstrength failed him, his moral strength would uphold him. He rose\r\nimmediately from the fatal chair, begging Mr. G——to stand near enough to\r\nsupport him if he should chance to stagger. The precaution was\r\nunnecessary, Sand did not stagger.\r\n\r\nAfter the judgment had been read, he sat down again and said in a loud\r\nvoice, \"I die trusting in God.\"\r\n\r\nBut at these words Mr. G———interrupted him.\r\n\r\n\"Sand,\" said he, \"what did you promise?\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" he answered; \"I had forgotten.\" He was silent, therefore, to the\r\ncrowd; but, raising his right hand and extending it solemnly in the air,\r\nhe said in a low voice, so that he might be heard only by those who were\r\naround him, \"I take God to witness that I die for the freedom of\r\nGermany.\"\r\n\r\nThen, with these words, he did as Conradin did with his glove; he threw\r\nhis rolled-up handkerchief over the line of soldiers around him, into\r\nthe midst of the people.\r\n\r\nThen the executioner came to cut off his hair; but Sand at first\r\nobjected.\r\n\r\n\"It is for your mother,\" said Mr. Widemann.\r\n\r\n\"On your honour, sir?\" asked Sand.\r\n\r\n\"On my honour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then do it,\" said Sand, offering his hair to the executioner.\r\n\r\nOnly a few curls were cut off, those only which fell at the back, the\r\nothers were tied with a ribbon on the top of the head. The executioner\r\nthen tied his hands on his breast, but as that position was oppressive\r\nto him and compelled him on account of his wound to bend his head, his\r\nhands were laid flat on his thighs and fixed in that position with\r\nropes. Then, when his eyes were about to be bound, he begged Mr.\r\nWidemann to place the bandage in such a manner that he could see the\r\nlight to his last moment. His wish was fulfilled.\r\n\r\nThen a profound and mortal stillness hovered over the whole crowd and\r\nsurrounded the scaffold. The executioner drew his sword, which flashed\r\nlike lightning and fell. Instantly a terrible cry rose at once from\r\ntwenty thousand bosoms; the head had not fallen, and though it had sunk\r\ntowards the breast still held to the neck. The executioner struck a\r\nsecond time, and struck off at the same blow the head and a part of the\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nIn the same moment, notwithstanding the efforts of the soldiers, their\r\nline was broken through; men and women rushed upon the scaffold, the\r\nblood was wiped up to the last drop with handkerchiefs; the chair upon\r\nwhich Sand had sat was broken and divided into pieces, and those who\r\ncould not obtain one, cut fragments of bloodstained wood from the\r\nscaffold itself.\r\n\r\nThe head and body were placed in a coffin draped with black, and carried\r\nback, with a large military escort, to the prison. At midnight the body\r\nwas borne silently, without torches or lights, to the Protestant\r\ncemetery, in which Kotzebue had been buried fourteen months previously.\r\nA grave had been mysteriously dug; the coffin was lowered into it, and\r\nthose who were present at the burial were sworn upon the New Testament\r\nnot to reveal the spot where Sand was buried until such time as they\r\nwere freed from their oath. Then the grave was covered again with the\r\nturf, that had been skilfully taken off, and that was relaid on the same\r\nspot, so that no new grave could be perceived; then the nocturnal\r\ngravediggers departed, leaving guards at the entrance.\r\n\r\nThere, twenty paces apart, Sand and Kotzebue rest: Kotzebue opposite the\r\ngate in the most conspicuous spot of the cemetery, and beneath a tomb\r\nupon which is engraved this inscription:\r\n\r\n\"The world persecuted him without pity, Calumny was his sad portion, He\r\nfound no happiness save in the arms of his wife, And no repose save in\r\nthe bosom of death. Envy dogged him to cover his path with thorns, Love\r\nbade his roses blossom; May Heaven pardon him As he pardons earth!\"\r\n\r\nIn contrast with this tall and showy monument, standing, as we have\r\nsaid, in the most conspicuous spot of the cemetery, Sand’s grave must be\r\nlooked for in the corner to the extreme left of the entrance gate; and a\r\nwild plum tree, some leaves of which every passing traveller carries\r\naway, rises alone upon the grave, which is devoid of any inscription.\r\n\r\nAs for the meadow in which Sand was executed, it is still called by the\r\npeople \"Sand’s Himmelsfartsweise,\" which signifies \"The manner of Sand’s\r\nascension.\"\r\n\r\nToward the end of September, 1838, we were at Mannheim, where I had\r\nstayed three days in order to collect all the details I could find about\r\nthe life and death of Karl-Ludwig Sand. But at the end of these three\r\ndays, in spite of my active investigations, these details still remained\r\nextremely incomplete, either because I applied in the wrong quarters, or\r\nbecause, being a foreigner, I inspired some distrust in those to whom I\r\napplied. I was leaving Mannheim, therefore, somewhat disappointed, and\r\nafter having visited the little Protestant cemetery where Sand and\r\nKotzebue are buried at twenty paces from each other, I had ordered my\r\ndriver to take the road to Heidelberg, when, after going a few yards,\r\nhe, who knew the object of my inquiries, stopped of himself and asked me\r\nwhether I should not like to see the place where Sand was executed. At\r\nthe same time he pointed to a little mound situated in the middle of a\r\nmeadow and a few steps from a brook. I assented eagerly, and although\r\nthe driver remained on the highroad with my travelling companions, I\r\nsoon recognised the spot indicated, by means of some relics of cypress\r\nbranches, immortelles, and forget-me-nots scattered upon the earth. It\r\nwill readily be understood that this sight, instead of diminishing my\r\ndesire for information, increased it. I was feeling, then, more than\r\never dissatisfied at going away, knowing so little, when I saw a man of\r\nsome five-and-forty to fifty years old, who was walking a little\r\ndistance from the place where I myself was, and who, guessing the cause\r\nthat drew me thither, was looking at me with curiosity. I determined to\r\nmake a last effort, and going up to him, I said, \"Oh, sir, I am a\r\nstranger; I am travelling to collect all the rich and poetic traditions\r\nof your Germany. By the way in which you look at me, I guess that you\r\nknow which of them attracts me to this meadow. Could you give me any\r\ninformation about the life and death of Sand?\"\r\n\r\n\"With what object, sir?\" the person to whom I spoke asked me in almost\r\nunintelligible French.\r\n\r\n\"With a very German object, be assured, sir,\" I replied. \"From the\r\nlittle I have learned, Sand seems to me to be one of those ghosts that\r\nappear only the greater and the more poetic for being wrapped in a\r\nshroud stained with blood. But he is not known in France; he might be\r\nput on the same level there with a Fieschi or a Meunier, and I wish, to\r\nthe best of my ability, to enlighten the minds of my countrymen about\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be a great pleasure to me, sir, to assist in such an\r\nundertaking; but you see that I can scarcely speak French; you do not\r\nspeak German at all; so that we shall find it difficult to understand\r\neach other.\"\r\n\r\n\"If that is all,\" I returned, \"I have in my carriage yonder an\r\ninterpreter, or rather an interpretress, with whom you will, I hope, be\r\nquite satisfied, who speaks German like Goethe, and to whom, when you\r\nhave once begun to speak to her, I defy you not to tell everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us go, then, sir,\" answered the pedestrian. \"I ask no better than\r\nto be agreeable to you.\"\r\n\r\nWe walked toward the carriage, which was still waiting on the highroad,\r\nand I presented to my travelling companion the new recruit whom I had\r\njust gained. The usual greetings were exchanged, and the dialogue began\r\nin the purest Saxon. Though I did not understand a word that was said,\r\nit was easy for me to see, by the rapidity of the questions and the\r\nlength of the answers, that the conversation was most interesting. At\r\nlast, at the end of half an hours growing desirous of knowing to what\r\npoint they had come, I said, \"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" answered my interpreter, \"you are in luck’s way, and you could\r\nnot have asked a better person.\"\r\n\r\n\"The gentleman knew Sand, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"The gentleman is the governor of the prison in which Sand was\r\nconfined.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed?\"\r\n\r\n\"For nine months—that is to say, from the day he left the hospital— this\r\ngentleman saw him every day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent!\"\r\n\r\n\"But that is not all: this gentleman was with him in the carriage that\r\ntook him to execution; this gentleman was with him on the scaffold;\r\nthere’s only one portrait of Sand in all Mannheim, and this gentleman\r\nhas it.\"\r\n\r\nI was devouring every word; a mental alchemist, I was opening my\r\ncrucible and finding gold in it.\r\n\r\n\"Just ask,\" I resumed eagerly, \"whether the gentleman will allow us to\r\ntake down in writing the particulars that he can give me.\"\r\n\r\nMy interpreter put another question, then, turning towards me, said,\r\n\"Granted.\"\r\n\r\nMr. G——got into the carriage with us, and instead of going on to\r\nHeidelberg, we returned to Mannheim, and alighted at the prison.\r\n\r\nMr. G—-did not once depart from the ready kindness that he had shown. In\r\nthe most obliging manner, patient over the minutest trifles, and\r\nremembering most happily, he went over every circumstance, putting\r\nhimself at my disposal like a professional guide. At last, when every\r\nparticular about Sand had been sucked dry, I began to ask him about the\r\nmanner in which executions were performed. \"As to that,\" said he, \"I can\r\noffer you an introduction to someone at Heidelberg who can give you all\r\nthe information you can wish for upon the subject.\"\r\n\r\nI accepted gratefully, and as I was taking leave of Mr. G——, after\r\nthanking him a thousand times, he handed me the offered letter. It bore\r\nthis superscription: \"To Herr-doctor Widemann, No. III High Street,\r\nHeidelberg.\"\r\n\r\nI turned to Mr. G——once more.\r\n\r\n\"Is he, by chance, a relation of the man who executed Sand?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"He is his son, and was standing by when the head fell.\".\r\n\r\n\"What is his calling, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"The same as that of his father, whom he succeeded.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you call him ’doctor’?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly; with us, executioners have that title.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, then, doctors of what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of surgery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really?\" said I. \"With us it is just the contrary; surgeons are called\r\nexecutioners.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will find him, moreover,\" added Mr. G——, \"a very distinguished\r\nyoung man, who, although he was very young at that time, has retained a\r\nvivid recollection of that event. As for his poor father, I think he\r\nwould as willingly have cut off his own right hand as have executed\r\nSand; but if he had refused, someone else would have been found. So he\r\nhad to do what he was ordered to do, and he did his best.\"\r\n\r\nI thanked Mr. G——, fully resolving to make use of his letter, and we\r\nleft for Heidelberg, where we arrived at eleven in the evening.\r\n\r\nMy first visit next day was to Dr. Widernann. It was not without some\r\nemotion, which, moreover, I saw reflected upon, the faces of my\r\ntravelling companions, that I rang at the door of the last judge, as the\r\nGermans call him. An old woman opened the door to us, and ushered us\r\ninto a pretty little study, on the left of a passage and at the foot of\r\na staircase, where we waited while Mr. Widemann finished dressing. This\r\nlittle room was full of curiosities, madrepores, shells, stuffed birds,\r\nand dried plants; a double-barrelled gun, a powder-flask, and a game-bag\r\nshowed that Mr. Widemann was a hunter.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment we heard his footstep, and the door opened. Mr. Widemann\r\nwas a very handsome young man, of thirty or thirty-two, with black\r\nwhiskers entirely surrounding his manly and expressive face; his morning\r\ndress showed a certain rural elegance. He seemed at first not only\r\nembarrassed but pained by our visit. The aimless curiosity of which he\r\nseemed to be the object was indeed odd. I hastened to give him Mr. G——’s\r\nletter and to tell him what reason brought me. Then he gradually\r\nrecovered himself, and at last showed himself no less hospitable and\r\nobliging towards us than he to whom we owed the introduction had been,\r\nthe day before.\r\n\r\nMr. Widemann then gathered together all his remembrances; he, too, had\r\nretained a vivid recollection of Sand, and he told us among other things\r\nthat his father, at the risk of bringing himself into ill odour, had\r\nasked leave to have a new scaffold made at his own expense, so that no\r\nother criminal might be executed upon the altar of the martyr’s death.\r\nPermission had been given, and Mr. Widemann had used the wood of the\r\nscaffold for the doors and windows of a little country house standing in\r\na vineyard. Then for three or four years this cottage became a shrine\r\nfor pilgrims; but after a time, little by little, the crowd grew less,\r\nand at the present day, when some of those who wiped the blood from the\r\nscaffold with their handkerchiefs have became public functionaries,\r\nreceiving salaries from Government, only foreigners ask, now and again,\r\nto see these strange relics.\r\n\r\nMr. Widemann gave me a guide; for, after hearing everything, I wanted to\r\nsee everything. The house stands half a league away from Heidelberg, on\r\nthe left of the road to Carlsruhe, and half-way up the mountain-side. It\r\nis perhaps the only monument of the kind that exists in the world.\r\n\r\nOur readers will judge better from this anecdote than from anything more\r\nwe could say, what sort of man he was who left such a memory in the\r\nhearts of his gaoler and his executioner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*URBAIN GRANDIER—1634*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the 26th of November, 1631, there was great excitement in the\r\nlittle town of Loudun, especially in the narrow streets which led to the\r\nchurch of Saint-Pierre in the marketplace, from the gate of which the\r\ntown was entered by anyone coming from the direction of the abbey of\r\nSaint-Jouin-les-Marmes. This excitement was caused by the expected\r\narrival of a personage who had been much in people’s mouths latterly in\r\nLoudun, and about whom there was such difference of opinion that\r\ndiscussion on the subject between those who were on his side and those\r\nwho were against him was carried on with true provincial acrimony. It\r\nwas easy to see, by the varied expressions on the faces of those who\r\nturned the doorsteps into improvised debating clubs, how varied were the\r\nfeelings with which the man would be welcomed who had himself formally\r\nannounced to friends and enemies alike the exact date of his return.\r\n\r\nAbout nine o’clock a kind of sympathetic vibration ran through the\r\ncrowd, and with the rapidity of a flash of lightning the words, \"There\r\nhe is! there he is!\" passed from group to group. At this cry some\r\nwithdrew into their houses and shut their doors and darkened their\r\nwindows, as if it were a day of public mourning, while others opened\r\nthem wide, as if to let joy enter. In a few moments the uproar and\r\nconfusion evoked by the news was succeeded by the deep silence of\r\nbreathless curiosity.\r\n\r\nThen, through the silence, a figure advanced, carrying a branch of\r\nlaurel in one hand as a token of triumph. It was that of a young man of\r\nfrom thirty-two to thirty-four years of age, with a graceful and\r\nwell-knit frame, an aristocratic air and faultlessly beautiful features\r\nof a somewhat haughty expression. Although he had walked three leagues\r\nto reach the town, the ecclesiastical garb which he wore was not only\r\nelegant but of dainty freshness. His eyes turned to heaven, and singing\r\nin a sweet voice praise to the Lord, he passed through the streets\r\nleading to the church in the market-place with a slow and solemn gait,\r\nwithout vouchsafing a look, a word, or a gesture to anyone. The entire\r\ncrowd, falling into step, marched behind him as he advanced, singing\r\nlike him, the singers being the prettiest girls in Loudun, for we have\r\nforgotten to say that the crowd consisted almost entirely of women.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the object of all this commotion arrived at length at the\r\nporch of the church of Saint-Pierre. Ascending the steps, he knelt at\r\nthe top and prayed in a low voice, then rising he touched the church\r\ndoors with his laurel branch, and they opened wide as if by magic,\r\nrevealing the choir decorated and illuminated as if for one of the four\r\ngreat feasts of the year, and with all its scholars, choir boys,\r\nsingers, beadles, and vergers in their places. Glancing around, he for\r\nwhom they were waiting came up the nave, passed through the choir, knelt\r\nfor a second time at the foot of the altar, upon which he laid the\r\nbranch of laurel, then putting on a robe as white as snow and passing\r\nthe stole around his neck, he began the celebration of the mass before a\r\ncongregation composed of all those who had followed him. At the end of\r\nthe mass a Te Deum was sung.\r\n\r\nHe who had just rendered thanks to God for his own victory with all the\r\nsolemn ceremonial usually reserved for the triumphs of kings was the\r\npriest Urbain Grandier. Two days before, he had been acquitted, in\r\nvirtue of a decision pronounced by M. d’Escoubleau de Sourdis,\r\nArchbishop of Bordeaux, of an accusation brought against him of which he\r\nhad been declared guilty by a magistrate, and in punishment of which he\r\nhad been condemned to fast on bread and water every Friday for three\r\nmonths, and forbidden to exercise his priestly functions in the diocese\r\nof Poitiers for five years and in the town of Loudun for ever.\r\n\r\nThese are the circumstances under which the sentence had been passed and\r\nthe judgment reversed.\r\n\r\nUrbain Grandier was born at Rovere, a village near Sable, a little town\r\nof Bas-Maine. Having studied the sciences with his father Pierre and his\r\nuncle Claude Grandier, who were learned astrologers and alchemists, he\r\nentered, at the age of twelve, the Jesuit college at Bordeaux, having\r\nalready received the ordinary education of a young man. The professors\r\nsoon found that besides his considerable attainments he had great\r\nnatural gifts for languages and oratory; they therefore made of him a\r\nthorough classical scholar, and in order to develop his oratorical\r\ntalent encouraged him to practise preaching. They soon grew very fond of\r\na pupil who was likely to bring them so much credit, and as soon as he\r\nwas old enough to take holy orders they gave him the cure of souls in\r\nthe parish of Saint-Pierre in Loudun, which was in the gift of the\r\ncollege. When he had been some months installed there as a\r\npriest-in-charge, he received a prebendal stall, thanks to the same\r\npatrons, in the collegiate church of Sainte-Croix.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand that the bestowal of these two positions on so\r\nyoung a man, who did not even belong to the province, made him seem in\r\nsome sort a usurper of rights and privileges belonging to the people of\r\nthe country, and drew upon him the envy of his brother-ecclesiastics.\r\nThere were, in fact, many other reasons why Urbain should be an object\r\nof jealousy to these: first, as we have already said, he was very\r\nhandsome, then the instruction which he had received from his father had\r\nopened the world of science to him and given him the key to a thousand\r\nthings which were mysteries to the ignorant, but which he fathomed with\r\nthe greatest ease. Furthermore, the comprehensive course of study which\r\nhe had followed at the Jesuit college had raised him above a crowd of\r\nprejudices, which are sacred to the vulgar, but for which he made no\r\nsecret of his contempt; and lastly, the eloquence of his sermons had\r\ndrawn to his church the greater part of the regular congregations of the\r\nother religious communities, especially of the mendicant orders, who had\r\ntill then, in what concerned preaching, borne away the palm at Loudun.\r\nAs we have said, all this was more than enough to excite, first\r\njealousy, and then hatred. And both were excited in no ordinary degree.\r\n\r\nWe all know how easily the ill-natured gossip of a small town can rouse\r\nthe angry contempt of the masses for everything which is beyond or above\r\nthem. In a wider sphere Urbain would have shone by his many gifts, but,\r\ncooped up as he was within the walls of a little town and deprived of\r\nair and space, all that might have conduced to his success in Paris led\r\nto his destruction at Loudun.\r\n\r\nIt was also unfortunate for Urbain that his character, far from winning\r\npardon for his genius, augmented the hatred which the latter inspired.\r\nUrbain, who in his intercourse with his friends was cordial and\r\nagreeable, was sarcastic, cold, and haughty to his enemies. When he had\r\nonce resolved on a course, he pursued it unflinchingly; he jealously\r\nexacted all the honour due to the rank at which he had arrived,\r\ndefending it as though it were a conquest; he also insisted on enforcing\r\nall his legal rights, and he resented the opposition and angry words of\r\ncasual opponents with a harshness which made them his lifelong enemies.\r\n\r\nThe first example which Urbain gave of this inflexibility was in 1620,\r\nwhen he gained a lawsuit against a priest named Meunier. He caused the\r\nsentence to be carried out with such rigour that he awoke an\r\ninextinguishable hatred in Meunier’s mind, which ever after burst forth\r\non the slightest provocation.\r\n\r\nA second lawsuit, which he likewise gained; was one which he undertook\r\nagainst the chapter of Sainte-Croix with regard to a house, his claim to\r\nwhich the chapter, disputed. Here again he displayed the same\r\ndetermination to exact his strict legal rights to the last iota, and\r\nunfortunately Mignon, the attorney of the unsuccessful chapter, was a\r\nrevengeful, vindictive, and ambitious man; too commonplace ever to\r\narrive at a high position, and yet too much above his surroundings to be\r\ncontent with the secondary position which he occupied. This man, who was\r\na canon of the collegiate church of Sainte-Croix and director of the\r\nUrsuline convent, will have an important part to play in the following\r\nnarrative. Being as hypocritical as Urbain was straightforward, his\r\nambition was to gain wherever his name was known a reputation for\r\nexalted piety; he therefore affected in his life the asceticism of an\r\nanchorite and the self-denial of a saint. As he had much experience in\r\necclesiastical lawsuits, he looked on the chapter’s loss of this one, of\r\nwhich he had in some sort guaranteed the success, as a personal\r\nhumiliation, so that when Urbain gave himself airs of triumph and\r\nexacted the last letter of his bond, as in the case of Meunier, he\r\nturned Mignon into an enemy who was not only more relentless but more\r\ndangerous than the former.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, and in consequence of this lawsuit, a certain Barot, an\r\nuncle of Mignon and his partner as well, got up a dispute with Urbain,\r\nbut as he was a man below mediocrity, Urbain required in order to crush\r\nhim only to let fall from the height of his superiority a few of those\r\ndisdainful words which brand as deeply as a red-hot iron. This man,\r\nthough totally wanting in parts, was very rich, and having no children\r\nwas always surrounded by a horde of relatives, every one of whom was\r\nabsorbed in the attempt to make himself so agreeable that his name would\r\nappear in Barot’s will. This being so, the mocking words which were\r\nrained down on Barot spattered not only himself but also all those who\r\nhad sided with him in the quarrel, and thus added considerably to the\r\ntale of Urbain’s enemies.\r\n\r\nAbout this epoch a still graver event took place. Amongst the most\r\nassiduous frequenters of the confessional in his church was a young and\r\npretty girl, Julie by name, the daughter of the king’s attorney,\r\nTrinquant—Trinquant being, as well as Barot, an uncle of Mignon. Now it\r\nhappened that this young girl fell into such a state of debility that\r\nshe was obliged to keep her room. One of her friends, named Marthe\r\nPelletier, giving up society, of which she was very fond, undertook to\r\nnurse the patient, and carried her devotion so far as to shut herself up\r\nin the same room with her. When Julie Trinquant had recovered and was\r\nable again to take her place in the world, it came out that Marthe\r\nPelletier, during her weeks of retirement, had given birth to a child,\r\nwhich had been baptized and then put out to nurse. Now, by one of those\r\nodd whims which so often take possession of the public mind, everyone in\r\nLoudun persisted in asserting that the real mother of the infant was not\r\nshe who had acknowledged herself as such—that, in short, Marthe\r\nPelletier had sold her good name to her friend Julie for a sum of money;\r\nand of course it followed as a matter about which there could be no\r\npossible doubt, that Urbain was the father.\r\n\r\nTrinquant hearing of the reports about his daughter, took upon himself\r\nas king’s attorney to have Marthe Pelletier arrested and imprisoned.\r\nBeing questioned about the child, she insisted that she was its mother,\r\nand would take its maintenance upon herself. To have brought a child\r\ninto the world under such circumstances was a sin, but not a crime;\r\nTrinquant was therefore obliged to set Marthe at liberty, and the abuse\r\nof justice of which he was guilty served only to spread the scandal\r\nfarther and to strengthen the public in the belief it had taken up.\r\n\r\nHitherto, whether through the intervention of the heavenly powers, or by\r\nmeans of his own cleverness, Urbain Grandier had come out victor in\r\nevery struggle in which he had engaged, but each victory had added to the\r\nnumber of his enemies, and these were now so numerous that any other\r\nthan he would have been alarmed, and have tried either to conciliate\r\nthem or to take precautions against their malice; but Urbain, wrapped in\r\nhis pride, and perhaps conscious of his innocence, paid no attention to\r\nthe counsels of his most faithful followers, but went on his way\r\nunheeding.\r\n\r\nAll the opponents whom till now Urbain had encountered had been entirely\r\nunconnected with each other, and had each struggled for his own\r\nindividual ends. Urbain’s enemies, believing that the cause of his\r\nsuccess was to be found in the want of cooperation among themselves, now\r\ndetermined to unite in order to crush him. In consequence, a conference\r\nwas held at Barot’s, at which, besides Barot himself, Meunier,\r\nTrinquant, and Mignon took part, and the latter had also brought with\r\nhim one Menuau, a king’s counsel and his own most intimate friend, who\r\nwas, however, influenced by other motives than friendship in joining the\r\nconspiracy. The fact was, that Menuau was in love with a woman who had\r\nsteadfastly refused to show him any favour, and he had got firmly fixed\r\nin his head that the reason for her else inexplicable indifference and\r\ndisdain was that Urbain had been beforehand with him in finding an\r\nentrance to her heart. The object of the meeting was to agree as to the\r\nbest means of driving the common enemy out of Loudon and its\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nUrbain’s life was so well ordered that it presented little which his\r\nenemies could use as a handle for their purpose. His only foible seemed\r\nto be a predilection for female society; while in return all the wives\r\nand daughters of the place, with the unerring instinct of their sex,\r\nseeing, that the new priest was young, handsome, and eloquent, chose\r\nhim, whenever it was possible, as their spiritual director. As this\r\npreference had already offended many husbands and fathers, the decision\r\nthe conspirators arrived at was that on this side alone was Grandier\r\nvulnerable, and that their only chance of success was to attack him\r\nwhere he was weakest. Almost at once, therefore, the vague reports which\r\nhad been floating about began to attain a certain definiteness: there\r\nwere allusions made, though no name was mentioned, to a young girl in\r\nLoudun; who in spite of Grandier’s frequent unfaithfulness yet remained\r\nhis mistress-in-chief; then it began to be whispered that the young\r\ngirl, having had conscientious scruples about her love for Urbain, he\r\nhad allayed them by an act of sacrilege—that is to say, he had, as\r\npriest, in the middle of the night, performed the service of marriage\r\nbetween himself and his mistress. The more absurd the reports, the more\r\ncredence did they gain, and it was not long till everyone in Loudun\r\nbelieved them true, although no one was able to name the mysterious\r\nheroine of the tale who had had the courage to contract a marriage with\r\na priest; and considering how small Loudun was, this was most\r\nextraordinary.\r\n\r\nResolute and full of courage as was Grandier, at length he could not\r\nconceal from himself that his path lay over quicksands: he felt that\r\nslander was secretly closing him round, and that as soon as he was well\r\nentangled in her shiny folds, she would reveal herself by raising her\r\nabhorred head, and that then a mortal combat between them would begin.\r\nBut it was one of his convictions that to draw back was to acknowledge\r\none’s guilt; besides, as far as he was concerned, it was probably too\r\nlate for him to retrace his steps. He therefore went on his way, as\r\nunyielding, as scornful, and as haughty as ever.\r\n\r\nAmong those who were supposed to be most active in spreading the\r\nslanders relative to Urbain was a man called Duthibaut, a person of\r\nimportance in the province, who was supposed by the townspeople to hold\r\nvery advanced views, and who was a \"Sir Oracle\" to whom the commonplace\r\nand vulgar turned for enlightenment. Some of this man’s strictures on\r\nGrandier were reported to the latter, especially some calumnies to which\r\nDuthibaut had given vent at the Marquis de Bellay’s; and one day,\r\nGrandier, arrayed in priestly garments, was about to enter the church of\r\nSainte-Croix to assist in the service, he encountered Duthibaut at the\r\nentrance, and with his usual haughty disdain accused him of slander.\r\nDuthibaut, who had got into the habit of saying and doing whatever came\r\ninto his head without fear of being called to account, partly because of\r\nhis wealth and partly because of the influence he had gained over the\r\nnarrow-minded, who are so numerous in a small provincial town, and who\r\nregarded him as being much above them, was so furious at this public\r\nreprimand, that he raised his cane and struck Urbain.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity which this affront afforded Grandier of being revenged\r\non all his enemies was too precious to be neglected, but, convinced,\r\nwith too much reason, that he would never obtain justice from the local\r\nauthorities, although the respect due to the Church had been infringed,\r\nin his person he decided to appeal to King Louis XIII, who deigned to\r\nreceive him, and deciding that the insult offered to a priest robed in\r\nthe sacred vestments should be expiated, sent the cause to the high\r\ncourt of Parliament, with instructions that the case against Duthibaut\r\nshould be tried and decided there.\r\n\r\nHereupon Urbain’s enemies saw they had no time to lose, and took\r\nadvantage of his absence to make counter accusations against him. Two\r\nworthies beings, named Cherbonneau and Bugrau, agreed to become\r\ninformers, and were brought before the ecclesiastical magistrate at\r\nPoitiers. They accused Grandier of having corrupted women and girls, of\r\nindulging in blasphemy and profanity, of neglecting to read his breviary\r\ndaily, and of turning God’s sanctuary into a place of debauchery and\r\nprostitution. The information was taken down, and Louis Chauvet, the\r\ncivil lieutenant, and the archpriest of Saint-Marcel and the Loudenois,\r\nwere appointed to investigate the matter, so that, while Urbain was\r\ninstituting proceedings against Duthibaut in Paris, information was laid\r\nagainst himself in Loudun. This matter thus set going was pushed forward\r\nwith all the acrimony so common in religious prosecutions; Trinquant\r\nappeared as a witness, and drew many others after him, and whatever\r\nomissions were found in the depositions were interpolated according to\r\nthe needs of the prosecution. The result was that the case when fully\r\ngot up appeared to be so serious that it was sent to the Bishop of\r\nPoitiers for trial. Now the bishop was not only surrounded by the\r\nfriends of those who were bringing the accusations against Grandier, but\r\nhad himself a grudge against him. It had happened some time before that\r\nUrbain, the case being urgent, had dispensed with the usual notice of a\r\nmarriage, and the bishop, knowing this, found in the papers laid before\r\nhim, superficial as they were, sufficient evidence against Urbain to\r\njustify him in issuing a warrant for his apprehension, which was drawn\r\nup in the following words:\r\n\r\n\"Henri-Louis, Chataignier de la Rochepezai, by divine mercy Bishop of\r\nPoitiers, in view of the charges and informations conveyed to us by the\r\narchpriest of Loudun against Urbain Grandier, priest-in-charge of the\r\nChurch of Saint-Pierre in the Market-Place at Loudun, in virtue of a\r\ncommission appointed by us directed to the said archpriest, or in his\r\nabsence to the Prior of Chassaignes, in view also of the opinion given\r\nby our attorney upon the said charges, have ordered and do hereby order\r\nthat Urbain Grandier, the accused, be quietly taken to the prison in our\r\npalace in Poitiers, if it so be that he be taken and apprehended, and if\r\nnot, that he be summoned to appear at his domicile within three days, by\r\nthe first apparitor-priest, or tonsured clerk, and also by the first\r\nroyal sergeant, upon this warrant, and we request the aid of the secular\r\nauthorities, and to them, or to any one of them, we hereby give power\r\nand authority to carry out this decree notwithstanding any opposition or\r\nappeal, and the said Grandier having been heard, such a decision will be\r\ngiven by our attorney as the facts may seem to warrant.\r\n\r\n\"Given at Dissay the 22nd day of October 1629, and signed in the\r\noriginal as follows:\r\n\r\n\"HENRI-LOUIS, Bishop of Poitiers.\"\r\n\r\nGrandier was, as we have said, at Paris when these proceedings were\r\ntaken against him, conducting before the Parliament his case against\r\nDuthibaut. The latter received a copy of the decision arrived at by the\r\nbishop, before Grandier knew of the charges that had been formulated\r\nagainst him, and having in the course of his defence drawn a terrible\r\npicture of the immorality of Grandier’s life, he produced as a proof of\r\nthe truth of his assertions the damning document which had been put into\r\nhis hands. The court, not knowing what to think of the turn affairs had\r\ntaken, decided that before considering the accusations brought by\r\nGrandier, he must appear before his bishop to clear himself of the\r\ncharges, brought against himself. Consequently he left Paris at once,\r\nand arrived at Loudun, where he only stayed long enough to learn what\r\nhad happened in his absence, and then went on to Poitiers in order to\r\ndraw up his defence. He had, however, no sooner set foot in the place\r\nthan he was arrested by a sheriff’s officer named Chatry, and confined\r\nin the prison of the episcopal palace.\r\n\r\nIt was the middle of November, and the prison was at all times cold and\r\ndamp, yet no attention was paid to Grandier’s request that he should be\r\ntransferred to some other place of confinement. Convinced by this that\r\nhis enemies had more influence than he had supposed, he resolved to\r\npossess his soul in patience, and remained a prisoner for two months,\r\nduring which even his warmest friends believed him lost, while Duthibaut\r\nopenly laughed at the proceedings instituted against himself, which he\r\nnow believed would never go any farther, and Barot had already selected\r\none of his heirs, a certain Ismael Boulieau, as successor to Urbain as\r\npriest and prebendary.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged that the costs of the lawsuit should be defrayed out of\r\na fund raised by the prosecutors, the rich paying for the poor; for as\r\nall the witnesses lived at Loudun and the trial was to take place at\r\nPoitiers, considerable expense would be incurred by the necessity of\r\nbringing so many people such a distance; but the lust of vengeance\r\nproved stronger than the lust of gold; the subscription expected from\r\neach being estimated according to his fortune, each paid without a\r\nmurmur, and at the end of two months the case was concluded.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the evident pains taken by the prosecution to strain the\r\nevidence against the defendant, the principal charge could not be\r\nsustained, which was that he had led astray many wives and daughters in\r\nLoudun. No one woman came forward to complain of her ruin by Grandier;\r\nthe name of no single victim of his alleged immorality was given. The\r\nconduct of the case was the most extraordinary ever seen; it was evident\r\nthat the accusations were founded on hearsay and not on fact, and yet a\r\ndecision and sentence against Grandier were pronounced on January 3rd,\r\n1630. The sentence was as follows: For three months to fast each Friday\r\non bread and water by way of penance; to be inhibited from the\r\nperformance of clerical functions in the diocese of Poitiers for five\r\nyears, and in the town of Loudun for ever.\r\n\r\nBoth parties appealed from this decision: Grandier to the Archbishop of\r\nBordeaux, and his adversaries, on the advice of the attorney to the\r\ndiocese, pleading a miscarriage of justice, to the Parliament of Paris;\r\nthis last appeal being made in order to overwhelm Grandier and break his\r\nspirit. But Grandier’s resolution enabled him to face this attack\r\nboldly: he engaged counsel to defend his case before the Parliament,\r\nwhile he himself conducted his appeal to the Archbishop of Bordeaux. But\r\nas there were many necessary witnesses, and it was almost impossible to\r\nbring them all such a great distance, the archiepiscopal court sent the\r\nappeal to the presidial court of Poitiers. The public prosecutor of\r\nPoitiers began a fresh investigation, which being conducted with\r\nimpartiality was not encouraging to Grandier’s accusers. There had been\r\nmany conflicting statements made by the witnesses, and these were now\r\nrepeated: other witnesses had declared quite openly that they had been\r\nbribed; others again stated that their depositions had been tampered\r\nwith; and amongst these latter was a certain priest named Mechin, and\r\nalso that Ishmael Boulieau whom Barot had been in such a hurry to select\r\nas candidate for the reversion of Grandier’s preferments. Boulieau’s\r\ndeposition has been lost, but we can lay Mechin’s before the reader, for\r\nthe original has been preserved, just as it issued from his pen:\r\n\r\n\"I, Gervais Mechin, curate-in-charge of the Church of Saint-Pierre in\r\nthe Market Place at Loudun, certify by these presents, signed by my\r\nhand, to relieve my conscience as to a certain report which is being\r\nspread abroad, that I had said in support of an accusation brought by\r\nGilles Robert, archpriest, against Urbain Grandier, priest-in-charge of\r\nSaint-Pierre, that I had found the said Grandier lying with women and\r\ngirls in the church of Saint Pierre, the doors being closed.\r\n\r\n\"ITEM. that on several different occasions, at unsuitable hours both day\r\nand night, I had seen women and girls disturb the said Grandier by going\r\ninto his bedroom, and that some of the said women remained with him from\r\none o’clock in the after noon till three o’clock the next morning, their\r\nmaids bringing them their suppers and going away again at once.\r\n\r\n\"ITEM. that I had seen the said Grandier in the church, the doors being\r\nopen, but that as soon as some women entered he closed them.\r\n\r\n\"As I earnestly desire that such reports should cease, I declare by\r\nthese presents that I have never seen the said Grandier with women or\r\ngirls in the church, the doors being closed; that I have never found him\r\nthere alone with women or girls; that when he spoke to either someone\r\nelse was always present, and the doors were open; and as to their\r\nposture, I think I made it sufficiently clear when in the witness-box\r\nthat Grandier was seated and the women scattered over the church;\r\nfurthermore, I have never seen either women or girls enter Grandier’s\r\nbedroom either by day or night, although it is true that I have heard\r\npeople in the corridor coming and going late in the evening, who they\r\nwere I cannot say, but a brother of the said Grandier sleeps close by;\r\nneither have I any knowledge that either women or girls, had their\r\nsuppers brought to the said room. I have also never said that he\r\nneglected the reading of his breviary, because that would be contrary to\r\nthe truth, seeing that on several occasions he borrowed mine and read\r\nhis hours in it. I also declare that I have never seen him close the\r\ndoors of the church, and that whenever I have seen him speaking to women\r\nI have never noticed any impropriety; I have not ever seen him touch\r\nthem in any way, they have only spoken together; and if anything is\r\nfound in my deposition contrary to the above, it is without my\r\nknowledge, and was never read to me, for I would not have signed it, and\r\nI say and affirm all this in homage to the truth.\r\n\r\n\"Done the last day of October 1630, \"(Signed) G. MECHIN.\"\r\n\r\nIn the face of such proofs of innocence none of the accusations could be\r\nconsidered as established and so, according to the decision of the\r\npresidial court of Poitiers, dated the 25th of May 1634, the decision of\r\nthe bishop’s court was reversed, and Grandier was acquitted of the\r\ncharges brought against him. However, he had still to appear before the\r\nArchbishop of Bordeaux, that his acquittal might be ratified. Grandier\r\ntook advantage of a visit which the archbishop paid to his abbey at\r\nSaint-Jouin-les-Marmes, which was only three leagues from Loudun, to\r\nmake this appearance; his adversaries, who were discouraged by the\r\nresult of the proceedings at Poitiers, scarcely made any defence, and\r\nthe archbishop, after an examination which brought clearly to light the\r\ninnocence of the accused, acquitted and absolved him.\r\n\r\nThe rehabilitation of Grandier before his bishop had two important\r\nresults: the first was that it clearly established his innocence, and\r\nthe second that it brought into prominence his high attainments and\r\neminent qualities. The archbishop seeing the persecutions to which he\r\nwas subjected, felt a kindly interest in him, and advised him to\r\nexchange into some other diocese, leaving a town the principal\r\ninhabitants of which appeared to have vowed him a relentless hate. But\r\nsuch an abandonment of his rights was foreign to the character of\r\nUrbain, and he declared to his superior that, strong in His Grace’s\r\napprobation and the testimony of his own conscience, he would remain in\r\nthe place to which God had called him. Monseigneur de Sourdis did not\r\nfeel it his duty to urge Urbain any further, but he had enough insight\r\ninto his character to perceive that if Urbain should one day fall, it\r\nwould be, like Satan, through pride; for he added another sentence to\r\nhis decision, recommending him to fulfil the duties of his office with\r\ndiscretion and modesty, according to the decrees of the Fathers and the\r\ncanonical constitutions. The triumphal entry of Urbain into Loudun with\r\nwhich we began our narrative shows the spirit in which he took his\r\nrecommendation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nUrbain Granadier was not satisfied with the arrogant demonstration by\r\nwhich he signalised his return, which even his friends had felt to be\r\nill advised; instead of allowing the hate he had aroused to die away or\r\nat least to fall asleep by letting the past be past, he continued with\r\nmore zeal than ever his proceedings against Duthibaut, and succeeded in\r\nobtaining a decree from the Parliament of La Tournelle, by which\r\nDuthibaut was summoned before it, and obliged to listen bareheaded to a\r\nreprimand, to offer apologies, and to pay damages and costs.\r\n\r\nHaving thus got the better of one enemy, Urbain turned on the others,\r\nand showed himself more indefatigable in the pursuit of justice than\r\nthey had been in the pursuit of vengeance. The decision of the\r\narchbishop had given him a right to a sum of money for compensation, and\r\ninterest thereon, as well as to the restitution of the revenues of his\r\nlivings, and there being some demur made, he announced publicly that he\r\nintended to exact this reparation to the uttermost farthing, and set\r\nabout collecting all the evidence which was necessary for the success of\r\na new lawsuit for libel and forgery which he intended to begin. It was\r\nin vain that his friends assured him that the vindication of his\r\ninnocence had been complete and brilliant, it was in vain that they\r\ntried to convince him of the danger of driving the vanquished to\r\ndespair, Urbain replied that he was ready to endure all the persecutions\r\nwhich his enemies might succeed in inflicting on him, but as long as he\r\nfelt that he had right upon his side he was incapable of drawing back.\r\n\r\nGrandier’s adversaries soon became conscious of the storm which was\r\ngathering above their heads, and feeling that the struggle between\r\nthemselves and this man would be one of life or death, Mignon, Barot,\r\nMeunier, Duthibaut, and Menuau met Trinquant at the village of\r\nPindadane, in a house belonging to the latter, in order to consult about\r\nthe dangers which threatened them. Mignon had, however, already begun to\r\nweave the threads of a new intrigue, which he explained in full to the\r\nothers; they lent a favourable ear, and his plan was adopted. We shall\r\nsee it unfold itself by degrees, for it is the basis of our narrative.\r\n\r\nWe have already said that Mignon was the director of the convent of\r\nUrsulines at Loudun: Now the Ursuline order was quite modern, for the\r\nhistoric controversies to which the slightest mention of the martyrdom\r\nof St. Ursula and her eleven thousand virgins gave rise, had long\r\nhindered the foundation of an order in the saint’s honour. However, in\r\n1560 Madame Angele de Bresse established such an order in Italy, with\r\nthe same rules as the Augustinian order. This gained the approbation of\r\nPope Gregory XIII in 1572. In 1614, Madeleine Lhuillier, with the\r\napproval of Pope Paul V, introduced this order into France, by founding\r\na convent at Paris, whence it rapidly spread over the whole kingdom,\r\nso-that in 1626, only six years before the time when the events just\r\nrelated took place, a sisterhood was founded in the little town of\r\nLoudun.\r\n\r\nAlthough this community at first consisted entirely of ladies of good\r\nfamily, daughters of nobles, officers, judges, and the better class of\r\ncitizens, and numbered amongst its founders Jeanne de Belfield, daughter\r\nof the late Marquis of Cose, and relative of M. de Laubardemont,\r\nMademoiselle de Fazili, cousin of the cardinal-duke, two ladies of the\r\nhouse of Barbenis de Nogaret, Madame de Lamothe, daughter of the Marquis\r\nLamothe-Barace of Anjou, and Madame d’Escoubleau de Sourdis, of the same\r\nfamily as the Archbishop of Bordeaux, yet as these nuns had almost all\r\nentered the convent because of their want of fortune, the community\r\nfound itself at the time of its establishment richer in blood than in\r\nmoney, and was obliged instead of building to purchase a private house.\r\nThe owner of this house was a certain Moussaut du Frene, whose brother\r\nwas a priest. This brother, therefore, naturally became the first\r\ndirector of these godly women. Less than a year after his appointment he\r\ndied, and the directorship became vacant.\r\n\r\nThe Ursulines had bought the house in which they lived much below its\r\nnormal value, for it was regarded as a haunted house by all the town.\r\nThe landlord had rightly thought that there was no better way of getting\r\nrid of the ghosts than to confront them with a religious sisterhood, the\r\nmembers of which, passing their days in fasting and prayer, would be\r\nhardly likely to have their nights disturbed by bad spirits; and in\r\ntruth, during the year which they had already passed in the house, no\r\nghost had ever put in an appearance—a fact which had greatly increased\r\nthe reputation of the nuns for sanctity.\r\n\r\nWhen their director died, it so happened that the boarders took\r\nadvantage of the occasion to indulge in some diversion at the expense of\r\nthe older nuns, who were held in general detestation by the youth of the\r\nestablishment on account of the rigour with which they enforced the\r\nrules of the order. Their plan was to raise once more those spirits\r\nwhich had been, as everyone supposed, permanently relegated to outer\r\ndarkness. So noises began to be heard on the roof of the house, which\r\nresolved themselves into cries and groans; then growing bolder, the\r\nspirits entered the attics and garrets, announcing their presence by\r\nclanking of chains; at last they became so familiar that they invaded\r\nthe dormitories, where they dragged the sheets off the sisters and\r\nabstracted their clothes.\r\n\r\nGreat was the terror in the convent, and great the talk in the town, so\r\nthat the mother superior called her wisest, nuns around her and asked\r\nthem what, in their opinion, would be the best course to take in the\r\ndelicate circumstances in which they found themselves. Without a\r\ndissentient voice, the conclusion arrived at was, that the late director\r\nshould be immediately replaced by a man still holier than he, if such a\r\nman could be found, and whether because he possessed a reputation for\r\nsanctity, or for some other reason, their choice fell on Urbain\r\nGrandier. When the offer of the post was brought to him, he answered\r\nthat he was already responsible for two important charges, and that he\r\ntherefore had not enough time to watch over the snow-white flock which\r\nthey wished to entrust to him, as a good shepherd should, and he\r\nrecommended the lady superior to seek out another more worthy and less\r\noccupied than himself.\r\n\r\nThis answer, as may be supposed, wounded the self-esteem of the sisters:\r\nthey next turned their eyes towards Mignon, priest and canon of the\r\ncollegiate church of Sainte-Croix, and he, although he felt deeply hurt\r\nthat they had not thought first of him, accepted the position eagerly;\r\nbut the recollection that Grandier had been preferred before himself\r\nkept awake in, him one of those bitter hatreds which time, instead of\r\nsoothing, intensifies. From the foregoing narrative the reader can see\r\nto what this hate led.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the new director was appointed, the mother superior confided\r\nto him the kind of foes which he would be expected to vanquish. Instead\r\nof comforting her by the assurance that no ghosts existing, it could not\r\nbe ghosts who ran riot in the house, Mignon saw that by pretending to\r\nlay these phantoms he could acquire the reputation for holiness he so\r\nmuch desired. So he answered that the Holy Scriptures recognised the\r\nexistence of ghosts by relating how the witch of Endor had made the\r\nshade of Samuel appear to Saul. He went on to say that the ritual of the\r\nChurch possessed means of driving away all evil spirits, no matter how\r\npersistent they were, provided that he who undertook the task were pure\r\nin thought and deed, and that he hoped soon, by the help of God, to rid\r\nthe convent of its nocturnal visitants, whereupon as a preparation for\r\ntheir expulsion he ordered a three days’ fast, to be followed by a\r\ngeneral confession.\r\n\r\nIt does not require any great cleverness to understand how easily Mignon\r\narrived at the truth by questioning the young penitents as they came\r\nbefore him. The boarders who had played at being ghosts confessed their\r\nfolly, saying that they had been helped by a young novice of sixteen\r\nyears of age, named Marie Aubin. She acknowledged that this was true; it\r\nwas she who used to get up in the middle of the night, and open the\r\ndormitory door, which her more timid room-mates locked most carefully\r\nfrom within every night, before going to bed—a fact which greatly\r\nincreased their terror when, despite their precautions, the ghosts still\r\ngot in. Under pretext of not exposing them to the anger of the superior,\r\nwhose suspicions would be sure to be awakened if the apparitions were to\r\ndisappear immediately after the general confession, Mignon directed them\r\nto renew their nightly frolics from time to time, but at longer and\r\nlonger intervals. He then sought an interview with the superior, and\r\nassured her that he had found the minds of all those under her charge so\r\nchaste and pure that he felt sure through his earnest prayers he would\r\nsoon clear the convent of the spirits which now pervaded it.\r\n\r\nEverything happened as the director had foretold, and the reputation for\r\nsanctity of the holy man, who by watching and praying had delivered the\r\nworthy Ursulines from their ghostly assailants, increased enormously in\r\nthe town of Loudun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nHardly had tranquillity been restored when Mignon, Duthibaut, Menuau,\r\nMeunier, and Barot, having lost their cause before the Archbishop of\r\nBordeaux, and finding themselves threatened by Grandier with a\r\nprosecution for libel and forgery, met together to consult as to the\r\nbest means of defending themselves before the unbending severity of this\r\nman, who would, they felt, destroy them if they did not destroy him.\r\n\r\nThe result of this consultation was that very shortly afterwards queer\r\nreports began to fly about; it was whispered that the ghosts whom the\r\npious director had expelled had again invaded the convent, under an\r\ninvisible and impalpable form, and that several of the nuns had given,\r\nby their words and acts, incontrovertible proofs of being possessed.\r\n\r\nWhen these reports were mentioned to Mignon, he, instead of denying\r\ntheir truth, cast up his eyes to heaven and said that God was certainly\r\na great and merciful God, but it was also certain that Satan was very\r\nclever, especially when he was barked by that false human science called\r\nmagic. However, as to the reports, though they were not entirely without\r\nfoundation, he would not go so far as to say that any of the sisters\r\nwere really possessed by devils, that being a question which time alone\r\ncould decide.\r\n\r\nThe effect of such an answer on minds already prepared to listen to the\r\nmost impossible things, may easily be guessed. Mignon let the gossip go\r\nits rounds for several months without giving it any fresh food, but at\r\nlength, when the time was ripe, he called on the priest of Saint-Jacques\r\nat Chinon, and told him that matters had now come to such a pass in the\r\nUrsuline convent that he felt it impossible to bear up alone under the\r\nresponsibility of caring for the salvation of the afflicted nuns, and he\r\nbegged him to accompany him to the convent. This priest, whose name was\r\nPierre Barre, was exactly the man whom Mignon needed in such a crisis.\r\nHe was of melancholy temperament, and dreamed dreams and saw visions;\r\nhis one ambition was to gain a reputation for asceticism and holiness.\r\nDesiring to surround his visit with the solemnity befitting such an\r\nimportant event, he set out for Loudun at the head of all his\r\nparishioners, the whole procession going on foot, in order to arouse\r\ninterest and curiosity; but this measure was quite needless it took less\r\nthan that to set the town agog.\r\n\r\nWhile the faithful filled the churches offering up prayers for the\r\nsuccess of the exorcisms, Mignon and Barre entered upon their task at\r\nthe convent, where they remained shut up with the nuns for six hours. At\r\nthe end of this time Barre appeared and announced to his parishioners\r\nthat they might go back to Chinon without him, for he had made up his\r\nmind to remain for the present at Loudun, in order to aid the venerable\r\ndirector of the Ursuline convent in the holy work he had undertaken; he\r\nenjoined on them to pray morning and evening, with all possible fervour,\r\nthat, in spite of the serious dangers by which it was surrounded, the\r\ngood cause might finally triumph. This advice, unaccompanied as it was\r\nby any explanation, redoubled the curiosity of the people, and the\r\nbelief gained ground that it was not merely one or two nuns who were\r\npossessed of devils, but the whole sisterhood. It was not very long\r\nbefore the name of the magician who had worked this wonder began to be\r\nmentioned quite openly: Satan, it was said, had drawn Urbain Grandier\r\ninto his power, through his pride. Urbain had entered into a pact with\r\nthe Evil Spirit by which he had sold him his soul in return for being\r\nmade the most learned man on earth. Now, as Urbain’s knowledge was much\r\ngreater than that of the inhabitants of Loudun, this story gained\r\ngeneral credence in the town, although here and there was to be found a\r\nman sufficiently enlightened to shrug his shoulders at these\r\nabsurdities, and to laugh at the mummeries, of which as yet he saw only\r\nthe ridiculous side.\r\n\r\nFor the next ten or twelve days Mignon and Barre spent the greater part\r\nof their time at the convent; sometimes remaining there for six hours at\r\na stretch, sometimes the entire day. At length, on Monday, the 11th of\r\nOctober, 1632, they wrote to the priest of Venier, to Messire Guillaume\r\nCerisay de la Gueriniere, bailiff of the Loudenois, and to Messire Louis\r\nChauvet, civil lieutenant, begging them to visit the Ursuline convent,\r\nin order to examine two nuns who were possessed by evil spirits, and to\r\nverify the strange and almost incredible manifestations of this\r\npossession. Being thus formally appealed to, the two magistrates could\r\nnot avoid compliance with the request. It must be confessed that they\r\nwere not free from curiosity, and felt far from sorry at being able to\r\nget to the bottom of the mystery of which for some time the whole town\r\nwas talking. They repaired, therefore, to the convent, intending to make\r\na thorough investigation as to the reality of the possession and as to\r\nthe efficacy of the exorcisms employed. Should they judge that the nuns\r\nwere really possessed, and that those who tried to deliver them were in\r\nearnest, they would authorise the continuation of the efforts at\r\nexorcism; but if they were not satisfied on these two points, they would\r\nsoon put an end to the whole thing as a comedy. When they reached the\r\ndoor, Mignon, wearing alb and stole, came to meet them. He told them\r\nthat the feelings of the nuns had for more than two weeks been harrowed\r\nby the apparition of spectres and other blood-curdling visions, that the\r\nmother superior and two nuns had evidently been possessed by evil\r\nspirits for over a week; that owing to the efforts of Barre and some\r\nCarmelite friars who were good enough to assist him against their common\r\nenemies, the devils had been temporarily driven out, but on the previous\r\nSunday night, the 10th of October, the mother superior, Jeanne de\r\nBelfield, whose conventual name was Jeanne des Anges, and a lay sister\r\ncalled Jeanne Dumagnoux, had again been entered into by the same\r\nspirits. It had, however, been discovered by means of exorcisms that a\r\nnew compact, of which the symbol and token was a bunch of roses, had\r\nbeen concluded, the symbol and token of the first having been three\r\nblack thorns. He added that during the time of the first possession the\r\ndemons had refused to give their names, but by the power of his\r\nexorcisms this reluctance had been overcome, the spirit which had\r\nresumed possession of the mother superior having at length revealed that\r\nits name was Ashtaroth, one of the greatest enemies of God, while the\r\ndevil which had entered into the lay sister was of a lower order, and\r\nwas called Sabulon. Unfortunately, continued Mignon, just now the two\r\nafflicted nuns were resting, and he requested the bailiff and the civil\r\nlieutenant to put off their inspection till a little later. The two\r\nmagistrates were just about to go away, when a nun appeared, saying that\r\nthe devils were again doing their worst with the two into whom they had\r\nentered. Consequently, they accompanied Mignon and the priest from\r\nVenier to an upper room, in which were seven narrow beds, of which two\r\nonly were occupied, one by the mother superior and the other by the lay\r\nsister. The superior, who was the more thoroughly possessed of the two,\r\nwas surrounded by the Carmelite monks, the sisters belonging to the\r\nconvent, Mathurin Rousseau, priest and canon of Sainte-Croix, and\r\nMannouri, a surgeon from the town.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did the two magistrates join the others than the superior was\r\nseized with violent convulsions, writhing and uttering squeals in exact\r\nimitation of a sucking pig. The two magistrates looked on in profound\r\nastonishment, which was greatly increased when they saw the patient now\r\nbury herself in her bed, now spring right out of it, the whole\r\nperformance being accompanied by such diabolical gestures and grimaces\r\nthat, if they were not quite convinced that the possession was genuine,\r\nthey were at least filled with admiration of the manner in which it was\r\nsimulated. Mignon next informed the bailiff and the civil lieutenant,\r\nthat although the superior had never learned Latin she would reply in\r\nthat language to all the questions addressed to her, if such were their\r\ndesire. The magistrates answered that as they were there in order to\r\nexamine thoroughly into the facts of the case, they begged the exorcists\r\nto give them every possible proof that the possession was real. Upon\r\nthis, Mignon approached the mother superior, and, having ordered\r\neveryone to be silent, placed two of his fingers in her mouth, and,\r\nhaving gone through the form of exorcism prescribed by the ritual, he\r\nasked the following questions word for word as they are given,\r\n\r\n  D. Why have you entered into the body of this young girl?\r\n\r\n  R. Causa animositatis. Out of enmity.\r\n\r\n  D. Per quod pactum? By what pact?\r\n\r\n  R. Per flores. By flowers.\r\n\r\n  D. Quales? What flowers?\r\n\r\n  R. Rosas. Roses.\r\n\r\n  D. Quis misfit? By whom wert thou sent?\r\n\r\nAt this question the magistrates remarked that the superior hesitated to\r\nreply; twice she opened her mouth in vain, but the third time she said\r\nin a weak voice—\r\n\r\n  D. Dic cognomen? What is his surname?\r\n\r\n  R. Urbanus. Urbain.\r\n\r\nHere there was again the same hesitation, but as if impelled by the will\r\nof the exorcist she answered:\r\n\r\n    R.  Grandier.                 Grandier.\r\n    D.  Dic qualitatem?           What is his profession?\r\n    R.  Sacerdos.                 A priest.\r\n    D.  Cujus ecclesiae?          Of what church?\r\n    R.  Sancti Petri.             Saint−Pierre.\r\n    D.  Quae persona attulit\r\n        flores?                   Who brought the flowers?\r\n    R.  Diabolica.                Someone sent by the devil.\r\n\r\nAs the patient pronounced the last word she recovered her senses, and\r\nhaving repeated a prayer, attempted to swallow a morsel of bread which\r\nwas offered her; she was, however, obliged to spit it out, saying it was\r\nso dry she could not get it down.\r\n\r\nSomething more liquid was then brought, but even of that she could\r\nswallow very little, as she fell into convulsions every few minutes.\r\n\r\nUpon this the two officials, seeing there was nothing more to be got out\r\nof the superior, withdrew to one of the window recesses and began to\r\nconverse in a low tone; whereupon Mignon, who feared that they had not\r\nbeen sufficiently impressed, followed them, and drew their attention to\r\nthe fact that there was much in what they had just seen to recall the\r\ncase of Gaufredi, who had been put to death a few years before in\r\nconsequence of a decree of the Parliament of Aix, in Provence. This\r\nill-judged remark of Mignon showed so clearly what his aim was that the\r\nmagistrates made no reply. The civil lieutenant remarked that he had\r\nbeen surprised that Mignon had not made any attempt to find out the\r\ncause of the enmity of which the superior had spoken, and which it was\r\nso important to find out; but Mignon excused himself by saying that he\r\nhad no right to put questions merely to gratify curiosity. The civil\r\nlieutenant was about to insist on the matter being investigated, when\r\nthe lay sister in her turn went into a fit, thus extricating Mignon from\r\nhis embarrassment. The magistrates approached the lay sister’s bed at\r\nonce, and directed Mignon to put the same questions to her as to the\r\nsuperior: he did so, but all in vain; all she would reply was, \"To the\r\nother! To the other!\"\r\n\r\nMignon explained this refusal to answer by saying that the evil spirit\r\nwhich was in her was of an inferior order, and referred all questioners\r\nto Ashtaroth, who was his superior. As this was the only explanation,\r\ngood or bad, offered them by Mignon, the magistrates went away, and drew\r\nup a report of all they had seen and heard without comment, merely\r\nappending their signatures.\r\n\r\nBut in the town very few people showed the same discretion and reticence\r\nas the magistrates. The bigoted believed, the hypocrites pretended to\r\nbelieve; and the worldly-minded, who were numerous, discussed the\r\ndoctrine of possession in all its phases, and made no secret of their\r\nown entire incredulity. They wondered, and not without reason it must be\r\nconfessed, what had induced the devils to go out of the nuns’ bodies for\r\ntwo days only, and then come back and resume possession, to the\r\nconfusion of the exorcists; further, they wanted to know why the mother\r\nsuperior’s devil spoke Latin, while the lay sister’s was ignorant of\r\nthat tongue; for a mere difference of rank in the hierarchy of hell did\r\nnot seem a sufficient explanation of such a difference in education;\r\nMignon’s refusal to go on with his interrogations as to the cause of the\r\nenmity made them, they said, suspect that, knowing he had reached the\r\nend of Ashtaroth’s classical knowledge, he felt it useless to try to\r\ncontinue the dialogue in the Ciceronian idiom. Moreover, it was well\r\nknown that only a few days before all Urbain’s worst enemies had met in\r\nconclave in the village of Puidardane; and besides, how stupidly Mignon\r\nhad shown his hand by mentioning Gaufredi, the priest who had been\r\nexecuted at Aix: lastly, why had not a desire for impartiality been\r\nshown by calling in other than Carmelite monks to be present at the\r\nexorcism, that order having a private quarrel with Grandier? It must be\r\nadmitted that this way of looking at the case was not wanting in\r\nshrewdness.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, October 12th, the bailiff and the civil\r\nlieutenant, having heard that exorcisms had been again tried without\r\ntheir having been informed beforehand, requested a certain Canon\r\nRousseau to accompany them, and set out with him and their clerk for the\r\nconvent. On arriving, they asked for Mignon, and on his appearance they\r\ntold him that this matter of exorcism was of such importance that no\r\nfurther steps were to be taken in it without the authorities being\r\npresent, and that in future they were to be given timely notice of every\r\nattempt to get rid of the evil spirits. They added that this was all the\r\nmore necessary as Mignon’s position as director of the sisterhood and\r\nhis well-known hate for Grandier would draw suspicions on him unworthy\r\nof his cloth, suspicions which he ought to be the first to wish to see\r\ndissipated, and that quickly; and that, therefore, the work which he had\r\nso piously begun would be completed by exorcists appointed by the court.\r\n\r\nMignon replied that, though he had not the slightest objection to the\r\nmagistrates being present at all the exorcisms, yet he could not promise\r\nthat the spirits would reply to anyone except himself and Barre. Just at\r\nthat moment Barre came on the scene, paler and more gloomy than ever,\r\nand speaking with the air of a man whose word no one could help\r\nbelieving, he announced that before their arrival some most\r\nextraordinary things had taken place. The magistrates asked what things,\r\nand Barre replied that he had learned from the mother superior that she\r\nwas possessed, not by one, but by seven devils, of whom Ashtaroth was\r\nthe chief; that Grandier had entrusted his pact with the devil, under\r\nthe symbol of a bunch of roses, to a certain Jean Pivart, to give to a\r\ngirl who had introduced it into the convent garden by throwing it over\r\nthe wall; that this took place in the night between Saturday and Sunday\r\n\"hora secunda nocturna\" (two hours after midnight); that those were the\r\nvery words the superior had used, but that while she readily named\r\nPivart, she absolutely refused to give the name of the girl; that on\r\nasking what Pivart was; she had replied, \"Pauper magus\" (a poor\r\nmagician); that he then had pressed her as to the word magus, and that\r\nshe had replied \"Magicianus et civis\" (magician and citizen); and that\r\njust as she said those words the magistrates had arrived, and he had\r\nasked no more questions.\r\n\r\nThe two officials listened to this information with the seriousness\r\nbefitting men entrusted with high judicial functions, and announced to\r\nthe two priests that they proposed to visit the possessed women and\r\nwitness for themselves the miracles that were taking place. The clerics\r\noffered no opposition, but said they feared that the devils were\r\nfatigued and would refuse to reply; and, in fact, when the officials\r\nreached the sickroom the two patients appeared to have regained some\r\ndegree of calm. Mignon took advantage of this quiet moment to say mass,\r\nto which the two magistrates listened devoutly and tranquilly, and while\r\nthe sacrifice was being offered the demons did not dare to move. It was\r\nexpected that they would offer some opposition at the elevation of the\r\nHost, but everything passed off without disturbance, only the lay\r\nsister’s hands and feet twitched a great deal; and this was the only\r\nfact which the magistrates thought worthy of mention in their report for\r\nthat morning. Barre assured them, however, that if they would return\r\nabout three o’clock the devils would probably have recovered\r\nsufficiently from their fatigue to give a second performance.\r\n\r\nAs the two gentlemen had determined to see the affair to the end, they\r\nreturned to the convent at the hour named, accompanied by Messire Irenee\r\nde Sainte-Marthe, sieur Deshurneaux; and found the room in which the\r\npossessed were lying full of curious spectators; for the exorcists had\r\nbeen true prophets—the devils were at work again.\r\n\r\nThe superior, as always, was the more tormented of the two, as was only\r\nto be expected, she having seven devils in her all at once; she was\r\nterribly convulsed, and was writhing and foaming at the mouth as if she\r\nwere mad. No one could long continue in such a condition without serious\r\ninjury to health; Barre therefore asked the devil-in-chief how soon he\r\nwould come out. \"Cras mane\" (To-morrow morning), he replied. The\r\nexorcist then tried to hurry him, asking him why he would not come out\r\nat once; whereupon the superior murmured the word \"Pactum\" (A pact); and\r\nthen \"Sacerdos\" (A priest), and finally \"Finis,\" or \"Finit,\" for even\r\nthose nearest could not catch the word distinctly, as the devil, afraid\r\ndoubtless of perpetrating a barbarism, spoke through the nun’s closely\r\nclenched teeth. This being all decidedly unsatisfying, the magistrates\r\ninsisted that the examination should continue, but the devils had again\r\nexhausted themselves, and refused to utter another word. The priest even\r\ntried touching the superior’s head with the pyx, while prayers and\r\nlitanies were recited, but it was all in vain, except that some of the\r\nspectators thought that the contortions of the patient became more\r\nviolent when the intercessions of certain saints were invoked, as for\r\ninstance Saints Augustine Jerome, Antony, and Mary Magdalene. Barre next\r\ndirected the mother superior to dedicate her heart and soul to God,\r\nwhich she did without difficulty; but when he commanded her to dedicate\r\nher body also, the chief devil indicated by fresh convulsions that he\r\nwas not going to allow himself to be deprived of a domicile without\r\nresistance, and made those who had heard him say that he would leave the\r\nnext morning feel that he had only said so under compulsion; and their\r\ncuriosity as to the result became heightened. At length, however,\r\ndespite the obstinate resistance of the demon, the superior succeeded in\r\ndedicating her body also to God, and thus victorious her features\r\nresumed their usual expression, and smiling as if nothing had happened,\r\nshe turned to Barre and said that there was no vestige of Satan left in\r\nher. The civil lieutenant then asked her if she remembered the questions\r\nshe had been asked and the answers she had given, but she replied that\r\nshe remembered nothing; but afterwards, having taken some refreshment,\r\nshe said to those around her that she recollected perfectly how the\r\nfirst possession, over which Mignon had triumphed, had taken place: one\r\nevening about ten o’clock, while several nuns were still in her room,\r\nalthough she was already in bed, it seemed to her that someone took her\r\nhand and laid something in it, closing her fingers; at that instant she\r\nfelt a sharp pain as if she had been pricked by three pins, and hearing\r\nher scream, the nuns came to her bedside to ask what ailed her. She held\r\nout her hand, and they found three black thorns sticking in it, each\r\nhaving made a tiny wound. Just as she had told this tale, the lay\r\nsister, as if to prevent all commentary, was seized with convulsions,\r\nand Barre recommenced his prayers and exorcisms, but was soon\r\ninterrupted by shrieks; for one of the persons present had seen a black\r\ncat come down the chimney and disappear. Instantly everyone concluded it\r\nmust be the devil, and began to seek it out. It was not without great\r\ndifficulty that it was caught; for, terrified at the sight of so many\r\npeople and at the noise, the poor animal had sought refuge under a\r\ncanopy; but at last it was secured and carried to the superior’s\r\nbedside, where Barre began his exorcisms once more, covering the cat\r\nwith signs of the cross, and adjuring the devil to take his true shape.\r\nSuddenly the ’touriere’, (the woman who received the tradespeople,) came\r\nforward, declaring the supposed devil to be only her cat, and she\r\nimmediately took possession of it, lest some harm should happen to it.\r\n\r\nThe gathering had been just about to separate, but Barre fearing that\r\nthe incident of the cat might throw a ridiculous light upon the evil\r\nspirits, resolved to awake once more a salutary terror by announcing\r\nthat he was going to burn the flowers through which the second spell had\r\nbeen made to work. Producing a bunch of white roses, already faded, he\r\nordered a lighted brazier to be brought. He then threw the flowers on\r\nthe glowing charcoal, and to the general astonishment they were consumed\r\nwithout any visible effect: the heavens still smiled, no peal of thunder\r\nwas heard, and no unpleasant odour diffused itself through the room.\r\nBarre feeling that the baldness of this act of destruction had had a bad\r\neffect, predicted that the morrow would bring forth wondrous things;\r\nthat the chief devil would speak more distinctly than hitherto; that he\r\nwould leave the body of the superior, giving such clear signs of his\r\npassage that no one would dare to doubt any longer that it was a case of\r\ngenuine possession. Thereupon the criminal lieutenant, Henri Herve, who\r\nhad been present during the exorcism, said they must seize upon the\r\nmoment of his exit to ask about Pivart, who was unknown at Loudun,\r\nalthough everyone who lived there knew everybody else. Barre replied in\r\nLatin, \"Et hoc dicet epuellam nominabit\" (He will not only tell about\r\nhim, but he will also name the young girl). The young girl whom the\r\ndevil was to name was, it may be recollected, she who had introduced the\r\nflowers into the convent, and whose name the demon until now had\r\nabsolutely refused to give. On the strength of these promises everyone\r\nwent home to await the morrow with impatience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nThat evening Grandier asked the bailiff for an audience. At first he had\r\nmade fun of the exorcisms, for the story had been so badly concocted,\r\nand the accusations were so glaringly improbable, that he had not felt\r\nthe least anxiety. But as the case went on it assumed such an important\r\naspect, and the hatred displayed by his enemies was so intense, that the\r\nfate of the priest Gaufredi, referred to by Mignon, occurred to Urbain’s\r\nmind, and in order to be beforehand with his enemies he determined to\r\nlodge a complaint against them. This complaint was founded on the fact\r\nthat Mignon had performed the rite of exorcism in the presence of the\r\ncivil lieutenant, the bailiff, and many other persons, and had caused\r\nthe nuns who were said to be possessed, in the hearing of all these\r\npeople, to name him, Urbain, as the author of their possession. This\r\nbeing a falsehood and an attack upon his honour, he begged the bailiff,\r\nin whose hands the conduct of the affair had been specially placed, to\r\norder the nuns to be sequestered, apart from the rest of the sisterhood\r\nand from each other, and then to have each separately examined. Should\r\nthere appear to be any evidence of possession, he hoped that the bailiff\r\nwould be pleased to appoint clerics of well-known rank and upright\r\ncharacter to perform whatever exorcisms were needful; such men having no\r\nbias against him would be more impartial than Mignon and his adherents.\r\nHe also called upon the bailiff to have an exact report drawn up of\r\neverything that took place at the exorcisms, in order that, if\r\nnecessary, he as petitioner might be able to lay it before anyone to\r\nwhose judgment he might appeal. The bailiff gave Grandier a statement of\r\nthe conclusions at which he had arrived, and told him that the exorcisms\r\nhad been performed that day by Barre, armed with the authority of the\r\nBishop of Poitiers himself. Being, as we have seen, a man of common\r\nsense and entirely unprejudiced in the matter, the bailiff advised\r\nGrandier to lay his complaint before his bishop; but unfortunately he\r\nwas under the authority of the Bishop of Poitiers, who was so prejudiced\r\nagainst him that he had done everything in his power to induce the\r\nArchbishop of Bordeaux to refuse to ratify the decision in favour of\r\nGrandier, pronounced by the presidial court. Urbain could not hide from\r\nthe magistrate that he had nothing to hope for from this quarter, and it\r\nwas decided that he should wait and see what the morrow would bring\r\nforth, before taking any further step.\r\n\r\nThe impatiently expected day dawned at last, and at eight o’clock in the\r\nmorning the bailiff, the king’s attorney, the civil lieutenant, the\r\ncriminal lieutenant, and the provost’s lieutenant, with their respective\r\nclerks, were already at the convent. They found the outer gate open, but\r\nthe inner door shut. In a few moments Mignon came to them and brought\r\nthem into a waiting-room. There he told them that the nuns were\r\npreparing for communion, and that he would be very much obliged to them\r\nif they would withdraw and wait in a house across the street, just\r\nopposite the convent, and that he would send them word when they could\r\ncome back. The magistrates, having first informed Mignon of Urbain’s\r\npetition, retired as requested.\r\n\r\nAn hour passed, and as Mignon did not summon them, in spite of his\r\npromise, they all went together to the convent chapel, where they were\r\ntold the exorcisms were already over. The nuns had quitted the choir,\r\nand Mignon and Barre came to the grating and told them that they had\r\njust completed the rite, and that, thanks to their conjurations, the two\r\nafflicted ones were now quite free from evil spirits. They went on to\r\nsay that they had been working together at the exorcism from seven\r\no’clock in the morning, and that great wonders, of which they had drawn\r\nup an account, had come to pass; but they had considered it would not be\r\nproper to allow any one else to be present during the ceremony besides\r\nthe exorcists and the possessed. The bailiff pointed out that their\r\nmanner of proceedings was not only illegal, but that it laid them under\r\nsuspicion of fraud and collusion, in the eyes of the impartial:\r\nMoreover, as the superior had accused Grandier publicly, she was bound\r\nto renew and prove her accusation also publicly, and not in secret;\r\nfurthermore, it was a great piece of insolence on the part of the\r\nexorcists to invite people of their standing and character to come to\r\nthe convent, and having kept them waiting an hour, to tell them that\r\nthey considered them unworthy to be admitted to the ceremony which they\r\nhad been requested to attend; and he wound up by saying that he would\r\ndraw up a report, as he had already done on each of the preceding days,\r\nsetting forth the extraordinary discrepancy between their promises and\r\ntheir performance. Mignon replied that he and Barre had had only one\r\nthing in view, viz. the expulsion of the, demons, and that in that they\r\nhad succeeded, and that their success would be of great benefit to the\r\nholy Catholic faith, for they had got the demons so thoroughly into\r\ntheir power that they had been able to command them to produce within a\r\nweek miraculous proofs of the spells cast on the nuns by Urbain Grandier\r\nand their wonderful deliverance therefrom; so that in future no one\r\nwould be able to doubt as to the reality of the possession. Thereupon\r\nthe magistrates drew up a report of all that had happened, and of what\r\nBarre and Mignon had said. This was signed by all the officials present,\r\nexcept the criminal lieutenant, who declared that, having perfect\r\nconfidence in the statements of the exorcists, he was anxious to do\r\nnothing to increase the doubting spirit which was unhappily so prevalent\r\namong the worldly.\r\n\r\nThe same day the bailiff secretly warned Urbain of the refusal of the\r\ncriminal lieutenant to join with the others in signing the report, and\r\nalmost at the same moment he learned that the cause of his adversaries\r\nwas strengthened by the adhesion of a certain Messire Rene Memin,\r\nseigneur de Silly, and prefect of the town. This gentleman was held in\r\ngreat esteem not only on account of his wealth and the many offices\r\nwhich he filled, but above all on account of his powerful friends, among\r\nwhom was the cardinal-duke himself, to whom he had formerly been of use\r\nwhen the cardinal was only a prior. The character of the conspiracy had\r\nnow become so alarming that Grandier felt it was time to oppose it with\r\nall his strength. Recalling his conversation with the bailiff the\r\npreceding day, during which he had advised him to lay his complaint\r\nbefore the Bishop of Poitiers, he set out, accompanied by a priest of\r\nLoudun, named Jean Buron, for the prelate’s country house at Dissay. The\r\nbishop, anticipating his visit, had already given his orders, and\r\nGrandier was met by Dupuis, the intendant of the palace, who, in reply\r\nto Grandier’s request to see the bishop, told him that his lordship was\r\nill. Urbain next addressed himself to the bishop’s chaplain, and begged\r\nhim to inform the prelate that his object in coming was to lay before\r\nhim the official reports which the magistrates had drawn up of the\r\nevents which had taken place at the Ursuline convent, and to lodge a\r\ncomplaint as to the slanders and accusations of which he was the victim.\r\nGrandier spoke so urgently that the chaplain could not refuse to carry\r\nhis message; he returned, however, in a few moments, and told Grandier,\r\nin the presence of Dupuis, Buron, and a certain sieur Labrasse, that the\r\nbishop advised him to take his case to the royal judges, and that he\r\nearnestly hoped he would obtain justice from them. Grandier perceived\r\nthat the bishop had been warned against him, and felt that he was\r\nbecoming more and more entangled in the net of conspiracy around him;\r\nbut he was not a man to flinch before any danger. He therefore returned\r\nimmediately to Loudun, and went once more to the bailiff, to whom he\r\nrelated all that had happened at Dissay; he then, a second time, made a\r\nformal complaint as to the slanders circulated with regard to him, and\r\nbegged the magistrates to have recourse to the king’s courts in the\r\nbusiness. He also said that he desired to be placed under the protection\r\nof the king and his justice, as the accusations made against him were\r\naimed at his honour and his life. The bailiff hastened to make out a\r\ncertificate of Urbain’s protest, which forbade at the same time the\r\nrepetition of the slanders or the infliction on Urbain of any injury.\r\n\r\nThanks to this document, a change of parts took place: Mignon, the\r\naccuser, became the accused. Feeling that he had powerful support behind\r\nhim, he had the audacity to appear before the bailiff the same day. He\r\nsaid that he did not acknowledge his jurisdiction, as in what concerned\r\nGrandier and himself, they being both priests, they could only be judged\r\nby their bishop; he nevertheless protested against the complaint lodged\r\nby Grandier, which characterised him as a slanderer, and declared that\r\nhe was ready to give himself up as a prisoner, in order to show everyone\r\nthat he did not fear the result of any inquiry. Furthermore, he had\r\ntaken an oath on the sacred elements the day before, in the presence of\r\nhis parishioners who had come to mass, that in all he had hitherto done\r\nhe had been moved, not by hatred of Grandier, but by love of the truth,\r\nand by his desire for the triumph of the Catholic faith; and he insisted\r\nthat the bailiff should give him a certificate of his declaration, and\r\nserved notice of the same on Grandier that very day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nSince October 13th, the day on which the demons had been expelled, life\r\nat the convent seemed to have returned to its usual quiet; but Grandier\r\ndid not let himself be lulled to sleep by the calm: he knew those with\r\nwhom he was contending too well to imagine for an instant that he would\r\nhear no more of them; and when the bailiff expressed pleasure at this\r\ninterval of repose, Grandier said that it would not last long, as the\r\nnuns were only conning new parts, in order to carry on the drama in a\r\nmore effective manner than ever. And in fact, on November 22nd, Rene\r\nMannouri, surgeon to the convent, was sent to one of his colleagues,\r\nnamed Gaspard Joubert, to beg him to come, bringing some of the\r\nphysicians of the town with him, to visit the two sisters, who were\r\nagain tormented by evil spirits. Mannouri, however, had gone to the\r\nwrong man, for Joubert had a frank and loyal character, and hated\r\neverything that was underhand. Being determined to take no part in the\r\nbusiness, except in a public and judicial manner, he applied at once to\r\nthe bailiff to know if it was by his orders that he was called in. The\r\nbailiff said it was not, and summoned Mannouri before him to ask him by\r\nwhose authority he had sent for Joubert. Mannouri declared that the\r\n’touriere’ had run in a fright to his house, saying that the nuns had\r\nnever been worse possessed than now, and that the director, Mignon,\r\nbegged him to come at once to the convent, bringing with him all the\r\ndoctors he could find.\r\n\r\nThe bailiff, seeing that fresh plots against Grandier were being formed,\r\nsent for him and warned him that Barre had come over from Chinon the day\r\nbefore, and had resumed his exorcisms at the convent, adding that it was\r\ncurrently reported in the town that the mother superior and Sister\r\nClaire were again tormented by devils. The news neither astonished nor\r\ndiscouraged Grandier, who replied, with his usual smile of disdain, that\r\nit was evident his enemies were hatching new plots against him, and that\r\nas he had instituted proceedings against them for the former ones, he\r\nwould take the same course with regard to these. At the same time,\r\nknowing how impartial the bailiff was, he begged him to accompany the\r\ndoctors and officials to the convent, and to be present at the\r\nexorcisms, and should any sign of real possession manifest itself, to\r\nsequester the afflicted nuns at once, and cause them to be examined by\r\nother persons than Mignon and Barre, whom he had such good cause to\r\ndistrust.\r\n\r\nThe bailiff wrote to the king’s attorney, who, notwithstanding his bias\r\nagainst Grandier, was forced to see that the conclusions arrived at were\r\ncorrect, and having certified this in writing, he at once sent his clerk\r\nto the convent to inquire if the superior were still possessed. In case\r\nof an affirmative reply being given, the clerk had instructions to warn\r\nMignon and Barre that they were not to undertake exorcisms unless in\r\npresence of the bailiff and of such officials and doctors as he might\r\nchoose to bring with him, and that they would disobey at their peril; he\r\nwas also to tell them that Grandier’s demands to have the nuns\r\nsequestered and other exorcists called in were granted.\r\n\r\nMignon and Barre listened while the clerk read his instructions, and\r\nthen said they refused to recognise the jurisdiction of the bailiff in\r\nthis case; that they had been summoned by the mother superior and Sister\r\nClaire when their strange illness returned, an illness which they were\r\nconvinced was nothing else than possession by evil spirits; that they\r\nhad hitherto carried out their exorcisms under the authority of a\r\ncommission given them by the Bishop of Poitiers; and as the time for\r\nwhich they had permission had not yet expired; they would continue to\r\nexorcise as often as might be necessary. They had, however, given notice\r\nto the worthy prelate of what was going on, in order that he might\r\neither come himself or send other exorcists as best suited him, so that\r\na valid opinion as to the reality, of the possession might be procured,\r\nfor up to the present the worldly and unbelieving had taken upon\r\nthemselves to declare in an off-hand manner that the whole affair was a\r\nmixture of fraud and delusion, in contempt of the glory of God and the\r\nCatholic religion. As to the rest of the message, they would not, in any\r\nway prevent the bailiff and the other officials, with as many medical\r\nmen as they chose to bring, from seeing the nuns, at least until they\r\nheard from the bishop, from whom they expected a letter next day. But it\r\nwas for the nuns themselves to say whether it was convenient for them to\r\nreceive visitors; as far as concerned themselves, they desired to renew\r\ntheir protest, and declared they could not accept the bailiff as their\r\njudge, and did not think that it could be legal for them to refuse to\r\nobey a command from their ecclesiastical superiors, whether with\r\nrelation to exorcism or any other thing of which the ecclesiastical\r\ncourts properly took cognisance. The clerk brought this answer to the\r\nbailiff, and he, thinking it was better to wait for the arrival of the\r\nbishop or of fresh orders from him, put off his visit to the convent\r\nuntil the next day. But the next day came without anything being heard\r\nof the prelate himself or of a messenger from him.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning the bailiff went to the convent, but was not\r\nadmitted; he then waited patiently until noon, and seeing that no news\r\nhad arrived from Dissay, and that the convent gates were still closed\r\nagainst him, he granted a second petition of Grandier’s, to the effect\r\nthat Barre and Mignon should be prohibited from questioning the superior\r\nand the other nuns in a manner tending to blacken the character of the\r\npetitioner or any other person. Notice of this prohibition was served\r\nthe same day on Barre and on one nun chosen to represent the community.\r\nBarre did not pay the slightest attention to this notice, but kept on\r\nasserting that the bailiff had no right to prevent his obeying the\r\ncommands of his bishop, and declaring that henceforward he would perform\r\nall exorcisms solely under ecclesiastical sanction, without any\r\nreference to lay persons, whose unbelief and impatience impaired the\r\nsolemnity with which such rites should be conducted.\r\n\r\nThe best part of the day having gone over without any sign of either\r\nbishop or messenger, Grandier presented a new petition to the bailiff.\r\nThe bailiff at once summoned all the officers of the bailiwick and the\r\nattorneys of the king, in order to lay it before them; but the king’s\r\nattorneys refused to consider the matter, declaring upon their honour\r\nthat although they did not accuse Grandier of being the cause, yet they\r\nbelieved that the nuns were veritably possessed, being convinced by the\r\ntestimony of the devout ecclesiastics in whose presence the evil spirits\r\nhad come out. This was only the ostensible reason for their refusal, the\r\nreal one being that the advocate was a relation of Mignon’s, and the\r\nattorney a son-in-law of Trinquant’s, to whose office he had succeeded.\r\nThus Grandier, against whom were all the ecclesiastical judges, began to\r\nfeel as if he were condemned beforehand by the judges of the royal\r\ncourts, for he knew how very short was the interval between the\r\nrecognition of the possession as a fact and the recognition of himself\r\nas its author.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in spite of the formal declarations of the king’s advocate\r\nand attorney, the bailiff ordered the superior and the lay sister to be\r\nremoved to houses in town, each to be accompanied by a nun as companion.\r\nDuring their absence from the convent they were to be looked after by\r\nexorcists, by women of high character and position, as well as by\r\nphysicians and attendants, all of whom he himself would appoint, all\r\nothers being forbidden access to the nuns without his permission.\r\n\r\nThe clerk was again sent to the convent with a copy of this decision,\r\nbut the superior having listened to the reading of the document,\r\nanswered that in her own name and that of the sisterhood she refused to\r\nrecognise the jurisdiction of the bailiff; that she had already received\r\ndirections from the Bishop of Poitiers, dated 18th November, explaining\r\nthe measures which were to be taken in the matter, and she would gladly\r\nsend a copy of these directions to the bailiff, to prevent his pleading\r\nignorance of them; furthermore, she demurred to the order for her\r\nremoval, having vowed to live always secluded in a convent, and that no\r\none could dispense her from this vow but the bishop. This protest having\r\nbeen made in the presence of Madame de Charnisay, aunt of two of the\r\nnuns, and Surgeon Mannouri, who was related to another, they both united\r\nin drawing up a protest against violence, in case the bailiff should\r\ninsist on having his orders carried out, declaring that, should he make\r\nthe attempt, they would resist him, as if he were a mere private\r\nindividual. This document being duly signed and witnessed was\r\nimmediately sent to the bailiff by the hand of his own clerk, whereupon\r\nthe bailiff ordered that preparations should be made with regard to the\r\nsequestration, and announced that the next day, the 24th November, he\r\nwould repair to the convent and be present at the exorcisms.\r\n\r\nThe next day accordingly, at the appointed hour, the bailiff summoned\r\nDaniel Roger, Vincent de Faux, Gaspard Joubert, and Matthieu Fanson, all\r\nfour physicians, to his presence, and acquainting them with his reasons\r\nfor having called them, asked them to accompany him to the convent to\r\nexamine, with the most scrupulous impartiality, two nuns whom he would\r\npoint out, in order to discover if their illness were feigned, or arose\r\nfrom natural or supernatural causes. Having thus instructed them as to\r\nhis wishes, they all set out for the convent.\r\n\r\nThey were shown into the chapel and placed close to the altar, being\r\nseparated by a grating from the choir, in which the nuns who sang\r\nusually sat. In a few moments the superior was carried in on a small\r\nbed, which was laid down before the grating. Barre then said mass,\r\nduring which the superior went into violent convulsions. She threw her\r\narms about, her fingers were clenched, her cheeks enormously inflated,\r\nand her eyes turned up so that only the whites could be seen.\r\n\r\nThe mass finished, Barre approached her to administer the holy communion\r\nand to commence the exorcism. Holding the holy wafer in his hand, he\r\nsaid—\r\n\r\n\"Adora Deum tuum, creatorem tuum\" (Adore God, thy Creator).\r\n\r\nThe superior hesitated, as if she found great difficulty in making this\r\nact of love, but at length she said—\r\n\r\n\"Adoro te\" (I adore Thee).\r\n\r\n\"Quem adoras?\" (Whom dost thou adore?)\r\n\r\n\"Jesus Christus\" (Jesus Christ), answered the nun, quite unconscious\r\nthat the verb adorn governs accusative.\r\n\r\nThis mistake, which no sixth-form boy would make, gave rise to bursts of\r\nlaughter in the church; and Daniel Douin, the provost’s assessor, was\r\nconstrained to say aloud—\r\n\r\n\"There’s a devil for you, who does not know much about transitive\r\nverbs.\"\r\n\r\nBarre perceiving the bad impression that the superior’s nominative had\r\nmade, hastened to ask her—\r\n\r\n\"Quis est iste quem adoras?\" (Who is it whom thou dost adore?)\r\n\r\nHis hope was that she would again reply \"Jesus Christus,\" but he was\r\ndisappointed.\r\n\r\n\"Jesu Christe,\" was her answer.\r\n\r\nRenewed shouts of laughter greeted this infraction of one of the most\r\nelementary rules of syntax, and several of those present exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, your reverence, what very poor Latin!\"\r\n\r\nBarre pretended not to hear, and next asked what was the name of the\r\ndemon who had taken possession of her. The poor superior, who was\r\ngreatly confused by the unexpected effect of her last two answers, could\r\nnot speak for a long time; but at length with great trouble she brought\r\nout the name Asmodee, without daring to latinise it. The exorcist then\r\ninquired how many devils the superior had in her body, and to this\r\nquestion she replied quite fluently:\r\n\r\n\"Sex\" (Six).\r\n\r\nThe bailiff upon this requested Barre to ask the chief devil how many\r\nevil spirits he had with him. But the need for this answer had been\r\nforeseen, and the nun unhesitatingly returned—\r\n\r\n\"Quinque\" (Five).\r\n\r\nThis answer raised Asmodee somewhat in the opinion of those present; but\r\nwhen the bailiff adjured the superior to repeat in Greek what she had\r\njust said in Latin she made no reply, and on the adjuration being\r\nrenewed she immediately recovered her senses.\r\n\r\nThe examination of the superior being thus cut short, a little nun who\r\nappeared for the first time in public was brought forward. She began by\r\ntwice pronouncing the name of Grandier with a loud laugh; then turning\r\nto the bystanders, called out—\r\n\r\n\"For all your number, you can do nothing worth while.\"\r\n\r\nAs it was easy to see that nothing of importance was to be expected from\r\nthis new patient, she was soon suppressed, and her place taken by the\r\nlay sister Claire who had already made her debut in the mother\r\nsuperior’s room.\r\n\r\nHardly had she entered the choir than she uttered a groan, but as soon\r\nas they placed her on the little bed on which the other nuns had lain,\r\nshe gave way to uncontrollable laughter, and cried out between the\r\nparoxysms—\r\n\r\n\"Grandier, Grandier, you must buy some at the market.\"\r\n\r\nBarre at once declared that these wild and whirling words were a proof\r\nof possession, and approached to exorcise the demon; but Sister Claire\r\nresisted, and pretending to spit in the face of the exorcist, put out\r\nher tongue at him, making indecent gestures, using a word in harmony\r\nwith her actions. This word being in the vernacular was understood by\r\neveryone and required no interpretation.\r\n\r\nThe exorcist then conjured her to give the name of the demon who was in\r\nher, and she replied—\r\n\r\n\"Grandier.\"\r\n\r\nBut Barre by repeating his question gave her to understand that she had\r\nmade a mistake, whereupon she corrected herself and said—\r\n\r\n\"Elimi.\"\r\n\r\nNothing in the world could induce her to reveal the number of evil\r\nspirits by whom Elimi was accompanied, so that Barre, seeing that it was\r\nuseless to press her on this point, passed on to the next question.\r\n\r\n\"Quo pacto ingressus est daemon\"(By what pact did the demon get in?).\r\n\r\n\"Duplex\" (Double), returned Sister Claire.\r\n\r\nThis horror of the ablative, when the ablative was absolutely necessary,\r\naroused once more the hilarity of the audience, and proved that Sister\r\nClaire’s devil was just as poor a Latin scholar as the superior’s, and\r\nBarre, fearing some new linguistic eccentricity on the part of the evil\r\nspirit, adjourned the meeting to another day.\r\n\r\nThe paucity of learning shown in the answers of the nuns being\r\nsufficient to convince any fairminded person that the whole affair was a\r\nridiculous comedy, the bailiff felt encouraged to persevere until he had\r\nunravelled the whole plot. Consequently, at three o’clock in the\r\nafternoon, he returned to the convent, accompanied by his clerk, by\r\nseveral magistrates, and by a considerable number of the best known\r\npeople of Loudun, and asked to see the superior. Being admitted, he\r\nannounced to Barre that he had come to insist on the superior being\r\nseparated from Sister Claire, so that each could be exorcised apart.\r\nBarre dared not refuse before such a great number of witnesses,\r\ntherefore the superior was isolated and the exorcisms begun all over\r\nagain. Instantly the convulsions returned, just as in the morning, only\r\nthat now she twisted her feet into the form of hooks, which was a new\r\naccomplishment.\r\n\r\nHaving adjured her several times, the exorcist succeeded in making her\r\nrepeat some prayers, and then sounded her as to the name and number of\r\nthe demons in possession, whereupon she said three times that there was\r\none called Achaos. The bailiff then directed Barre to ask if she were\r\npossessed ’ex pacto magi, aut ex Aura voluntate Dei’ (by a pact with a\r\nsorcerer or by the pure will of God), to which the superior answered\r\n\r\n\"Non est voluutas Dei\" (Not by the will of God).\r\n\r\nUpon this, Barre dreading more questions from the bystanders, hastily\r\nresumed his own catechism by asking who was the sorcerer.\r\n\r\n\"Urbanus,\" answered the superior.\r\n\r\n\"Est-ne Urbanus papa\" (Is it Pope Urban?), asked the exorcist.\r\n\r\n\"Grandier,\" replied the superior.\r\n\r\n\"Quare ingressus es in corpus hujus puellae\" (Why did you enter the body\r\nof this maiden?), said Barre.\r\n\r\n\"Propter praesentiam tuum\" (Because of your presence), answered the\r\nsuperior.\r\n\r\nAt this point the bailiff, seeing no reason why the dialogue between\r\nBarre and the superior should ever come to an end, interposed and\r\ndemanded that questions suggested by him and the other officials present\r\nshould be put to the superior, promising that if she answered three of\r\nfour such questions correctly, he, and those with him, would believe in\r\nthe reality of the possession, and would certify to that effect. Barre\r\naccepted the challenge, but unluckily just at that moment the superior\r\nregained consciousness, and as it was already late, everyone retired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, November 25th, the bailiff and the majority of the\r\nofficers of the two jurisdictions came to the convent once more, and\r\nwere all conducted to the choir. In a few moments the curtains behind\r\nthe grating were drawn back, and the superior, lying on her bed, came to\r\nview. Barre began, as usual, by the celebration of mass, during which\r\nthe superior was seized with convulsions, and exclaimed two or three\r\ntimes, \"Grandier! Grandier! false priest!\" When the mass was over, the\r\ncelebrant went behind the grating, carrying the pyx; then, placing it on\r\nhis head and holding it there, he protested that in all he was doing he\r\nwas actuated by the purest motives and the highest integrity; that he\r\nhad no desire to harm anyone on earth; and he adjured God to strike him\r\ndead if he had been guilty of any bad action or collusion, or had\r\ninstigated the nuns to any deceit during the investigation.\r\n\r\nThe prior of the Carmelites next advanced and made the same declaration,\r\ntaking the oath in the same manner, holding the pyx over his head; and\r\nfurther calling down on himself and his brethren the curse of Korah,\r\nDathan, and Abiram if they had sinned during this inquiry. These\r\nprotestations did not, however, produce the salutary effect intended,\r\nsome of those present saying aloud that such oaths smacked of sacrilege.\r\n\r\nBarre hearing the murmurs, hastened to begin the exorcisms, first\r\nadvancing to the superior to offer her the holy sacrament: but as soon\r\nas she caught sight of him she became terribly convulsed, and attempted\r\nto drag the pyx from his hands. Barre, however, by pronouncing the\r\nsacred words, overcame the repulsion of the superior, and succeeded in\r\nplacing the wafer in her mouth; she, however, pushed it out again with\r\nher tongue, as if it made her sick; Barge caught it in his fingers and\r\ngave it to her again, at the same time forbidding the demon to make her\r\nvomit, and this time she succeeded in partly swallowing the sacred\r\nmorsel, but complained that it stuck in her throat. At last, in order to\r\nget it down, Barge three times gave her water to drink; and then, as\r\nalways during his exorcisms, he began by interrogating the demon.\r\n\r\n\"Per quod pactum ingressus es in corpus hujus puellae?\" (By what pact\r\ndidst thou enter the body of this maiden?)\r\n\r\n\"Aqua\" ( By water), said the superior.\r\n\r\nOne of those who had accompanied the bailiff was a Scotchman called\r\nStracan, the head of the Reformed College of Loudun. Hearing this\r\nanswer, he called on the demon to translate aqua into Gaelic, saying if\r\nhe gave this proof of having those linguistic attainments which all bad\r\nspirits possess, he and those with him would be convinced that the\r\npossession was genuine and no deception. Barre, without being in the\r\nleast taken aback, replied that he would make the demon say it if God\r\npermitted, and ordered the spirit to answer in Gaelic. But though he\r\nrepeated his command twice, it was not obeyed; on the third repetition\r\nthe superior said—\r\n\r\n\"Nimia curiositas\" (Too much curiosity), and on being asked again, said—\r\n\r\n\"Deus non volo.\"\r\n\r\nThis time the poor devil went astray in his conjugation, and confusing\r\nthe first with the third person, said, \"God, I do not wish,\" which in\r\nthe context had no meaning. \"God does not wish,\" being the appointed\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nThe Scotchman laughed heartily at this nonsense, and proposed to Barre\r\nto let his devil enter into competition with the boys of his seventh\r\nform; but Barre, instead of frankly accepting the challenge in the\r\ndevil’s name, hemmed and hawed, and opined that the devil was justified\r\nin not satisfying idle curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"But, sir, you must be aware,\" said the civil lieutenant, \"and if you\r\nare not, the manual you hold in your hand will teach you, that the gift\r\nof tongues is one of the unfailing symptoms of true possession, and the\r\npower to tell what is happening at a distance another.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" returned Barre, \"the devil knows the language very well, but,\r\ndoes not wish to speak it; he also knows all your sins, in proof of\r\nwhich, if you so desire, I shall order him to give the list.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be delighted to hear it,\" said the civil lieutenant; \"be so\r\ngood as to try the experiment.\"\r\n\r\nBarre was about to approach the superior, when he was held back by the\r\nbailiff, who remonstrated with him on the impropriety of his conduct,\r\nwhereupon Barre assured the magistrate that he had never really intended\r\nto do as he threatened.\r\n\r\nHowever, in spite of all Barre’s attempts to distract the attention of\r\nthe bystanders from the subject, they still persisted in desiring to\r\ndiscover the extent of the devil’s knowledge of foreign languages, and\r\nat their suggestion the bailiff proposed to Barre to try him in Hebrew\r\ninstead of Gaelic. Hebrew being, according to Scripture, the most\r\nancient language of all, ought to be familiar to the demon, unless\r\nindeed he had forgotten it. This idea met with such general applause\r\nthat Barre was forced to command the possessed nun to say aqua in\r\nHebrew. The poor woman, who found it difficult enough to repeat\r\ncorrectly the few Latin words she had learned by rote, made an impatient\r\nmovement, and said—\r\n\r\n\"I can’t help it; I retract\" (Je renie).\r\n\r\nThese words being heard and repeated by those near her produced such an\r\nunfavourable impression that one of the Carmelite monks tried to explain\r\nthem away by declaring that the superior had not said \"Je renie,\" but\r\n\"Zaquay,\" a Hebrew word corresponding to the two Latin words, \"Effudi\r\naquam\" (I threw water about). But the words \"Je renie\" had been heard so\r\ndistinctly that the monk’s assertion was greeted with jeers, and the\r\nsub-prior reprimanded him publicly as a liar. Upon this, the superior\r\nhad a fresh attack of convulsions, and as all present knew that these\r\nattacks usually indicated that the performance was about to end, they\r\nwithdrew, making very merry over a devil who knew neither Hebrew nor\r\nGaelic, and whose smattering of Latin was so incorrect.\r\n\r\nHowever, as the bailiff and civil lieutenant were determined to clear up\r\nevery doubt so far as they still felt any, they went once again to the\r\nconvent at three o’clock the same afternoon. Barre came out to meet\r\nthem, and took them for a stroll in the convent grounds. During their\r\nwalk he said to the civil lieutenant that he felt very much surprised\r\nthat he, who had on a former occasion, by order of the Bishop of\r\nPoitiers, laid information against Grandier should be now on his side.\r\nThe civil lieutenant replied that he would be ready to inform against\r\nhim again if there were any justification, but at present his object was\r\nto arrive at the truth, and in this he felt sure he should be\r\nsuccessful. Such an answer was very unsatisfactory to Barre; so, drawing\r\nthe bailiff aside, he remarked to him that a man among whose ancestors\r\nwere many persons of condition, several of whom had held positions of\r\nmuch dignity in the Church, and who himself held such an important\r\njudicial position, ought to show less incredulity in regard to the\r\npossibility of a devil entering into a human body, since if it were\r\nproved it would redound to the glory of God and the good of the Church\r\nand of religion. The bailiff received this remonstrance with marked\r\ncoldness, and replied that he hoped always to take justice for his\r\nguide, as his duty commanded. Upon this, Barre pursued the subject no\r\nfarther, but led the way to the superior’s apartment.\r\n\r\nJust as they entered the room, where a large number of people were\r\nalready gathered, the superior, catching sight of the pyx which Barre\r\nhad brought with him, fell once more into convulsions. Barre went\r\ntowards her, and having asked the demon as usual by what pact he had\r\nentered the maiden’s body, and received the information that it was by\r\nwater, continued his examination as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Quis finis pacti\" (What is the object of this pact?)\r\n\r\n\"Impuritas\" (Unchastity).\r\n\r\nAt these words the bailiff interrupted the exorcist and ordered him to\r\nmake the demon say in Greek the three words, ’finis, pacti, impuritas’.\r\nBut the superior, who had once already got out of her difficulties by an\r\nevasive answer, had again recourse to the same convenient phrase, \"Nimia\r\ncuriositas,\" with which Barre agreed, saying that they were indeed too\r\nmuch given to curiosity. So the bailiff had to desist from his attempt\r\nto make the demon speak Greek, as he had before been obliged to give up\r\ntrying to make him speak Hebrew and Gaelic. Barre then continued his\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n\"Quis attulit pactum?\" (Who brought the pact?)\r\n\r\n\"Magus\" (The sorcerer).\r\n\r\n\"Quale nomen magi?\" (What is the sorcerer’s name?)\r\n\r\n\"Urbanus\" (Urban).\r\n\r\n\"Quis Urbanus? Est-ne Urbanus papa?\"\r\n\r\n(What Urban? Pope Urban?)\r\n\r\n\"Grandier.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cujus qualitatis?\" (What is his profession?)\r\n\r\n\"Curcatus.\"\r\n\r\nThe enriching of the Latin language by this new and unknown word\r\nproduced a great effect on the audience; however, Barre did not pause\r\nlong enough to allow it to be received with all the consideration it\r\ndeserved, but went on at once.\r\n\r\n\"Quis attulit aquam pacti?\" (Who brought the water of the pact?)\r\n\r\n\"Magus\" (The magician).\r\n\r\n\"Qua hora?\" (At what o’clock?)\r\n\r\n\"Septima\" (At seven o’clock).\r\n\r\n\"An matutina?\" (In the morning?)\r\n\r\n\"Sego\" (In the evening).\r\n\r\n\"Quomodo intravit?\" (How did he enter?)\r\n\r\n\"Janua\" (By the door).\r\n\r\n\"Quis vidit?\" (Who saw him?)\r\n\r\n\"Tres\" (Three persons).\r\n\r\nHere Barre stopped, in order to confirm the testimony of the devil,\r\nassuring his hearers that the Sunday after the superior’s deliverance\r\nfrom the second possession he along with Mignon and one of the sisters\r\nwas sitting with her at supper, it being about seven o’clock in the\r\nevening, when she showed them drops of water on her arm, and no one\r\ncould tell where they came from. He had instantly washed her arm in holy\r\nwater and repeated some prayers, and while he was saying them the\r\nbreviary of the superior was twice dragged from her hands and thrown at\r\nhis feet, and when he stooped to pick it up for the second time he got a\r\nbox on the ear without being able to see the hand that administered it.\r\nThen Mignon came up and confirmed what Barre had said in a long\r\ndiscourse, which he wound up by calling down upon his head the most\r\nterrible penalties if every word he said were not the exact truth. He\r\nthen dismissed the assembly, promising to drive out the evil spirit the\r\nnext day, and exhorting those present to prepare themselves, by\r\npenitence and receiving the holy communion, for the contemplation of the\r\nwonders which awaited them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last two exorcisms had been so much talked about in the town, that\r\nGrandier, although he had not been present, knew everything that had\r\nhappened, down to the smallest detail, so he once more laid a complaint\r\nbefore the bailiff, in which he represented that the nuns maliciously\r\ncontinued to name him during the exorcisms as the author of their\r\npretended possession, being evidently influenced thereto by his enemies,\r\nwhereas in fact not only had he had no communication with them, but had\r\nnever set eyes on them; that in order to prove that they acted under\r\ninfluence it was absolutely necessary that they should be sequestered,\r\nit being most unjust that Mignon and Barre, his mortal enemies, should\r\nhave constant access to them and be able to stay with them night and\r\nday, their doing so making the collusion evident and undeniable; that\r\nthe honour of God was involved, and also that of the petitioner, who had\r\nsome right to be respected, seeing that he was first in rank among the\r\necclesiastics of the town.\r\n\r\nTaking all this into consideration, he consequently prayed the bailiff\r\nto be pleased to order that the nuns suffering from the so-called\r\npossession should at once be separated from each other and from their\r\npresent associates, and placed under the control of clerics assisted by\r\nphysicians in whose impartiality the petitioner could have confidence;\r\nand he further prayed that all this should be performed in spite of any\r\nopposition or appeal whatsoever (but without prejudice to the right of\r\nappeal), because of the importance of the matter. And in case the\r\nbailiff were not pleased to order the sequestration, the petitioner\r\nwould enter a protest and complaint against his refusal as a withholding\r\nof justice.\r\n\r\nThe bailiff wrote at the bottom of the petition that it would be at once\r\ncomplied with.\r\n\r\nAfter Urbain Grandier had departed, the physicians who had been present\r\nat the exorcisms presented themselves before the bailiff, bringing their\r\nreport with them. In this report they said that they had recognised\r\nconvulsive movements of the mother superior’s body, but that one visit\r\nwas not sufficient to enable them to make a thorough diagnosis, as the\r\nmovements above mentioned might arise as well from a natural as from\r\nsupernatural causes; they therefore desired to be afforded opportunity\r\nfor a thorough examination before being called on to pronounce an\r\nopinion. To this end they required permission to spend several days and\r\nnights uninterruptedly in the same room with the patients, and to treat\r\nthem in the presence of other nuns and some of the magistrates. Further,\r\nthey required that all the food and medicine should pass through the\r\ndoctors’ hands, and that no one, should touch the patients except quite\r\nopenly, or speak to them except in an audible voice. Under these\r\nconditions they would undertake to find out the true cause of the\r\nconvulsions and to make a report of the same.\r\n\r\nIt being now nine o’clock in the morning, the hour when the exorcisms\r\nbegan, the bailiff went over at once to the convent, and found Barre\r\nhalf way through the mass, and the superior in convulsions. The\r\nmagistrate entered the church at the moment of the elevation of the\r\nHost, and noticed among the kneeling Catholics a young man called\r\nDessentier standing up with his hat on. He ordered him either to uncover\r\nor to go away. At this the convulsive movements of the superior became\r\nmore violent, and she cried out that there were Huguenots in the church,\r\nwhich gave the demon great power over her. Barre asked her how many\r\nthere were present, and she replied, \"Two,\" thus proving that the devil\r\nwas no stronger in arithmetic than in Latin; for besides Dessentier,\r\nCouncillor Abraham Gauthier, one of his brothers, four of his sisters,\r\nRene Fourneau, a deputy, and an attorney called Angevin, all of the\r\nReformed faith, were present.\r\n\r\nAs Barre saw that those present were greatly struck, by this numerical\r\ninaccuracy, he tried to turn their thoughts in another direction by\r\nasking the superior if it were true that she knew no Latin. On her\r\nreplying that she did not know a single word, he held the pyx before her\r\nand ordered her to swear by the holy sacrament. She resisted at first,\r\nsaying loud enough for those around her to hear—\r\n\r\n\"My father, you make me take such solemn oaths that I fear God will\r\npunish me.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Barre replied—\r\n\r\n\"My daughter, you must swear for the glory of God.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she took the oath.\r\n\r\nJust then one of the bystanders remarked that the mother superior was in\r\nthe habit of interpreting the Catechism to her scholars. This she\r\ndenied, but acknowledged that she used to translate the Paternoster and\r\nthe Creed for them. As the superior felt herself becoming somewhat\r\nconfused at this long series of embarrassing questions, she decided on\r\ngoing into convulsions again, but with only moderate success, for the\r\nbailiff insisted that the exorcists should ask her where Grandier was at\r\nthat very moment. Now, as the ritual teaches that one of the proofs of\r\npossession is the faculty of telling, when asked, where people are,\r\nwithout seeing them, and as the question was propounded in the\r\nprescribed terms, she was bound to answer, so she said that Grandier was\r\nin the great hall of the castle.\r\n\r\n\"That is not correct,\" said the bailiff, \"for before coming here I\r\npointed out a house to Grandier and asked him to stay in it till I came\r\nback. If anybody will go there, they will be sure to find him, for he\r\nwished to help me to discover the truth without my being obliged to\r\nresort to sequestration, which is a difficult measure to take with\r\nregard to nuns.\"\r\n\r\nBarre was now ordered to send some of the monks present to the castle,\r\naccompanied by a magistrate and a clerk. Barre chose the Carmelite\r\nprior, and the bailiff Charles Chauvet, assessor of the bailiwick,\r\nIsmael Boulieau a priest, and Pierre Thibaut, an articled clerk, who all\r\nset out at once to execute their commission, while the rest of those\r\npresent were to await their return.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the superior, who had not spoken a word since the bailiff’s\r\ndeclaration, remained, in spite of repeated exorcisms, dumb, so Barre\r\nsent for Sister Claire, saying that one devil would encourage the other.\r\nThe bailiff entered a formal protest against this step, insisting that\r\nthe only result of a double exorcism would be to cause confusion, during\r\nwhich suggestions might be conveyed to the superior, and that the proper\r\nthing to do was, before beginning new conjurations, to await the return\r\nof the messengers. Although the bailiff’s suggestion was most\r\nreasonable, Barre knew better than to adopt it, for he felt that no\r\nmatter what it cost he must either get rid of the bailiff and all the\r\nother officials who shared his doubts, or find means with the help of\r\nSister Claire to delude them into belief. The lay sister was therefore\r\nbrought in, in spite of the opposition of the bailiff and the other\r\nmagistrates, and as they did not wish to seem to countenance a fraud,\r\nthey all withdrew, declaring that they could no longer look on at such a\r\ndisgusting comedy. In the courtyard they met their messengers returning,\r\nwho told them they had gone first to the castle and had searched the\r\ngreat hall and all the other rooms without seeing anything of Grandier;\r\nthey had then gone to the house mentioned by the bailiff, where they\r\nfound him for whom they were looking, in the company of Pere Veret, the\r\nconfessor of the nuns, Mathurin Rousseau, and Nicolas Benoit, canons,\r\nand Conte, a doctor, from whom they learned that Grandier had not been\r\nan instant out of their sight for the last two hours. This being all the\r\nmagistrates wanted to know, they went home, while their envoys went\r\nupstairs and told their story, which produced the effect which might be\r\nexpected. Thereupon a Carmelite brother wishing to weaken the\r\nimpression, and thinking that the devil might be more lucky in his,\r\nsecond guess than the first, asked the superior where Grandier was just\r\nthen. She answered without the slightest hesitation that he was walking\r\nwith the bailiff in the church of Sainte-Croix. A new deputation was at\r\nonce sent off, which finding the church empty, went on to the palace,\r\nand saw the bailiff presiding at a court. He had gone direct from the\r\nconvent to the palace, and had not yet seen Grandier. The same day the\r\nnuns sent word that they would not consent to any more exorcisms being\r\nperformed in the presence of the bailiff and the officials who usually\r\naccompanied him, and that for the future they were determined to answer\r\nno questions before such witnesses.\r\n\r\nGrandier learning of this piece of insolence, which prevented the only\r\nman on whose impartiality he could reckon from being henceforward\r\npresent at the exorcisms, once more handed in a petition to the bailiff,\r\nbegging for the sequestration of the two nuns, no matter at what risk.\r\nThe bailiff, however, in the interests of the petitioner himself, did\r\nnot dare to grant this request, for he was afraid that the\r\necclesiastical authorities would nullify his procedure, on the ground\r\nthat the convent was not under his jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nHe, however, summoned a meeting of the principal inhabitants of the\r\ntown, in order to consult with them as to the best course to take for\r\nthe public good. The conclusion they arrived at was to write to the\r\nattorney-general and to the Bishop of Poitiers, enclosing copies of the\r\nreports which had been drawn up, and imploring them to use their\r\nauthority to put an end to these pernicious intrigues. This was done,\r\nbut the attorney-general replied that the matter being entirely\r\necclesiastical the Parliament was not competent to take cognisance of\r\nit. As for the bishop, he sent no answer at all.\r\n\r\nHe was not, however, so silent towards Grandier’s enemies; for the\r\nill-success of the exorcisms of November 26th having made increased\r\nprecautions necessary, they considered it would be well to apply to the\r\nbishop for a new commission, wherein he should appoint certain\r\necclesiastics to represent him during the exorcisms to come. Barre\r\nhimself went to Poitiers to make this request. It was immediately\r\ngranted, and the bishop appointed Bazile, senior-canon of Champigny, and\r\nDemorans, senior canon of Thouars, both of whom were related to some of\r\nGrandier’s adversaries. The following is a copy of the new commission:\r\n\r\n\"Henri-Louis le Chataignier de la Rochepezai, by the divine will Bishop\r\nof Poitiers, to the senior canons of the Chatelet de Saint-Pierre de\r\nThouars et de Champigny-sur-Vese, greeting:\r\n\r\n\"We by these presents command you to repair to the town of Loudun, to\r\nthe convent of the nuns of Sainte-Ursule, to be present at the exorcisms\r\nwhich will be undertaken by Sieur Barre upon some nuns of the said\r\nconvent who are tormented by evil spirits, we having thereto authorised\r\nthe said Barre. You are also to draw up a report of all that takes\r\nplace, and for this purpose are to take any clerk you may choose with\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n\"Given and done at Poitiers, November 28th, 1632.\r\n\r\n\"(Signed) HENRI LOUIS, Bishop of Poitiers. \"(Countersigned) By order of\r\nthe said Lord Bishop, \"MICHELET\"\r\n\r\nThese two commissioners having been notified beforehand, went to Loudun,\r\nwhere Marescot, one of the queen’s chaplains, arrived at the same time;\r\nfor the pious queen, Anne of Austria, had heard so many conflicting\r\naccounts of the possession of the Ursuline nuns, that she desired, for\r\nher own edification, to get to the bottom of the affair. We can judge\r\nwhat importance the case was beginning to assume by its being already\r\ndiscussed at court.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the notice which had been sent them that the nuns would not\r\nreceive them, the bailiff and the civil lieutenant fearing that the\r\nroyal envoy would allow himself to be imposed on, and would draw up an\r\naccount which would cast doubt on the facts contained in their reports,\r\nbetook themselves to the convent on December 1st, the day on which the\r\nexorcisms were to recommence, in the presence of the new commissioners.\r\nThey were accompanied by their assessor, by the provost’s lieutenant,\r\nand a clerk. They had to knock repeatedly before anyone seemed to hear\r\nthem, but at length a nun opened the door and told them they could not\r\nenter, being suspected of bad faith, as they had publicly declared that\r\nthe possession was a fraud and an imposture. The bailiff, without\r\nwasting his time arguing with the sister, asked to see Barre, who soon\r\nappeared arrayed in his priestly vestments, and surrounded by several\r\npersons, among whom was the queen’s chaplain. The bailiff complained\r\nthat admittance had been refused to him and those with him, although he\r\nhad been authorised to visit the convent by the Bishop of Poitiers.\r\nBarre’ replied that he would not hinder their coming in, as far as it\r\nconcerned him.\r\n\r\n\"We are here with the intention of entering,\" said the bailiff, \"and\r\nalso for the purpose of requesting you to put one or two questions to\r\nthe demon which we have drawn up in terms which are in accordance with\r\nwhat is prescribed in the ritual. I am sure you will not refuse,\" he\r\nadded, turning with a bow to Marescot, \"to make this experiment in the\r\npresence of the queen’s chaplain, since by that means all those\r\nsuspicions of imposture can be removed which are unfortunately so rife\r\nconcerning this business.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that respect I shall do as I please, and not as you order me,\" was\r\nthe insolent reply of the exorcist.\r\n\r\n\"It is, however, your duty to follow legal methods in your procedure,\"\r\nreturned the bailiff, \"if you sincerely desire the truth; for it would\r\nbe an affront to God to perform a spurious miracle in His honour, and a\r\nwrong to the Catholic faith, whose power is in its truth, to attempt to\r\ngive adventitious lustre to its doctrines by the aid of fraud and\r\ndeception.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said Barre, \"I am a man of honour, I know my duty and I shall\r\ndischarge it; but as to yourself, I must recall to your recollection\r\nthat the last time you were here you left the chapel in anger and\r\nexcitement, which is an attitude of mind most unbecoming in one whose\r\nduty it is to administer justice.\"\r\n\r\nSeeing that these recriminations would have no practical result, the\r\nmagistrates cut them short by reiterating their demand for admittance;\r\nand on this being refused, they reminded the exorcists that they were\r\nexpressly prohibited from asking any questions tending to cast a slur on\r\nthe character of any person or persons whatever, under pain of being\r\ntreated as disturbers of the public peace. At this warning Barre, saying\r\nthat he did not acknowledge the bailiff’s jurisdiction, shut the door in\r\nthe faces of the two magistrates.\r\n\r\nAs there was no time to lose if the machinations of his enemies were to\r\nbe brought to nought, the bailiff and the civil lieutenant advised\r\nGrandier to write to the Archbishop of Bordeaux, who had once already\r\nextricated him from imminent danger, setting forth at length his present\r\npredicament; this letter; accompanied by the reports drawn up by the\r\nbailiff and the civil lieutenant, were sent off at once by a trusty\r\nmessenger to His Grace of Escoubleau de Sourdis. As soon as he received\r\nthe despatches, the worthy prelate seeing how grave was the crisis, and\r\nthat the slightest delay might be fatal to Grandier, set out at once for\r\nhis abbey of Saint-Jouinles-Marmes, the place in which he had already\r\nvindicated in so striking a manner the upright character of the poor\r\npersecuted priest by a fearless act of justice.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to realise what a blow his arrival was to those who\r\nheld a brief for the evil spirits in possession; hardly had he reached\r\nSaint-Jouin than he sent his own physician to the convent with orders to\r\nsee the afflicted nuns and to test their condition, in order to judge if\r\nthe convulsions were real or simulated. The physician arrived, armed\r\nwith a letter from the archbishop, ordering Mignon to permit the bearer\r\nto make a thorough examination into the position of affairs. Mignon\r\nreceived the physician with all the respect due to him who sent him, but\r\nexpressed great regret that he had not come a little sooner, as, thanks\r\nto his (Mignon’s) exertions and those of Barre, the devils had been\r\nexorcised the preceding day. He nevertheless introduced the archbishop’s\r\nenvoy to the presence of the superior and Sister Claire, whose demeanour\r\nwas as calm as if they had never been disturbed by any agitating’\r\nexperiences. Mignon’s statement being thus confirmed, the doctor\r\nreturned to Saint-Jouin, the only thing to which he could bear testimony\r\nbeing the tranquillity which reigned at the moment in the convent.\r\n\r\nThe imposture being now laid so completely bare, the archbishop was\r\nconvinced that the infamous persecutions to which it had led would cease\r\nat once and for ever; but Grandier, better acquainted with the character\r\nof his adversaries, arrived on the 27th of December at the abbey and\r\nlaid a petition at the archbishop’s feet. In this document he set forth\r\nthat his enemies having formerly brought false and slanderous\r\naccusations, against him of which, through the justice of the\r\narchbishop, he had been able to clear himself, had employed themselves\r\nduring the last three months in inventing and publishing as a fact that\r\nthe petitioner had sent evil spirits into the bodies of nuns in the\r\nUrsuline convent of Loudun, although he had never spoken to any of the\r\nsisterhood there; that the guardianship of the sisters who, it was\r\nalleged, were possessed, and the task of exorcism, had been entrusted to\r\nJean Mignon and Pierre Barre, who had in the most unmistakable manner\r\nshown themselves to be the mortal enemies of the petitioner; that in the\r\nreports drawn up by the said Jean Mignon and Pierre Barre, which\r\ndiffered so widely from those made by the bailiff and the civil\r\nlieutenant, it was boastfully alleged that three or four times devils\r\nhad been driven out, but that they had succeeded in returning and taking\r\npossession of their victims again and again, in virtue of successive\r\npacts entered into between the prince of darkness and the petitioner;\r\nthat the aim of these reports and allegations was to destroy the\r\nreputation of the petitioner and excite public opinion against him; that\r\nalthough the demons had been put to flight by the arrival of His Grace,\r\nyet it was too probable that as soon as he was gone they would return to\r\nthe charge; that if, such being the case, the powerful support of the\r\narchbishop were not available, the innocence of the petitioner, no\r\nmatter how strongly established, would by the cunning tactics of his\r\ninveterate foes be obscured and denied: he, the petitioner, therefore\r\nprayed that, should the foregoing reasons prove on examination to be\r\ncogent, the archbishop would be pleased to prohibit Barre, Mignon, and\r\ntheir partisans, whether among the secular or the regular clergy, from\r\ntaking part in any future exorcisms, should such be necessary, or in the\r\ncontrol of any persons alleged to be possessed; furthermore, petitioner\r\nprayed that His Grace would be pleased to appoint as a precautionary\r\nmeasure such other clerics and lay persons as seemed to him suitable, to\r\nsuperintend the administration of food and medicine and the rite of\r\nexorcism to those alleged to be possessed, and that all the treatment\r\nshould be carried out in the presence of magistrates.\r\n\r\nThe archbishop accepted the petition, and wrote below it:\r\n\r\n\"The present petition having been seen by us and the opinion of our\r\nattorney having been taken in the matter, we have sent the petitioner in\r\nadvance of our said attorney back to Poitiers, that justice may be done\r\nhim, and in the meantime we have appointed Sieur Barre, Pere l’Escaye, a\r\nJesuit residing in Poitiers, Pere Gaut of the Oratory, residing at\r\nTours, to conduct the exorcisms, should such be necessary, and have\r\ngiven them an order to this effect.\r\n\r\n\"It is forbidden to all others to meddle with the said exorcisms, on\r\npain of being punished according to law.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the above that His Grace the Archbishop of\r\nBordeaux, in his enlightened and generous exercise of justice, had\r\nforeseen and provided for every possible contingency; so that as soon as\r\nhis orders were made known to the exorcists the possession ceased at\r\nonce and completely, and was no longer even talked of. Barre withdrew to\r\nChinon, the senior canons rejoined their chapters, and the nuns, happily\r\nrescued for the time, resumed their life of retirement and tranquillity.\r\nThe archbishop nevertheless urged on Grandier the prudence of effecting\r\nan exchange of benefices, but he replied that he would not at that\r\nmoment change his simple living of Loudun for a bishopric.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe exposure of the plot was most prejudicial to the prosperity of the\r\nUrsuline community: spurious possession, far from bringing to their\r\nconvent an increase of subscriptions and enhancing their reputation, as\r\nMignon had promised, had ended for them in open shame, while in private\r\nthey suffered from straitened circumstances, for the parents of their\r\nboarders hastened to withdraw their daughters from the convent, and the\r\nnuns in losing their pupils lost their sole source of income. Their,\r\nfall in the estimation of the public filled them with despair, and it\r\nleaked out that they had had several altercations with their director,\r\nduring which they reproached him for having, by making them commit such\r\na great sin, overwhelmed them with infamy and reduced them to misery,\r\ninstead of securing for them the great spiritual and temporal advantages\r\nhe had promised them. Mignon, although devoured by hate, was obliged to\r\nremain quiet, but he was none the less as determined as ever to have\r\nrevenge, and as he was one of those men who never give up while a gleam\r\nof hope remains, and whom no waiting can tire, he bided his time,\r\navoiding notice, apparently resigned to circumstances, but keeping his\r\neyes fixed on Grandier, ready to seize on the first chance of recovering\r\npossession of the prey that had escaped his hands. And unluckily the\r\nchance soon presented itself.\r\n\r\nIt was now 1633: Richelieu was at the height of his power, carrying out\r\nhis work of destruction, making castles fall before him where he could\r\nnot make heads fall, in the spirit of John Knox’s words, \"Destroy the\r\nnests and the crows will disappear.\" Now one of these nests was the\r\ncrenellated castle of Loudun, and Richelieu had therefore ordered its\r\ndemolition.\r\n\r\nThe person appointed to carry out this order was a man such as those\r\nwhom Louis XI. had employed fifty years earlier to destroy the feudal\r\nsystem, and Robespierre one hundred and fifty years later to destroy the\r\naristocracy. Every woodman needs an axe, every reaper a sickle, and\r\nRichelieu found the instrument he required in de Laubardemont,\r\nCouncillor of State.\r\n\r\nBut he was an instrument full of intelligence, detecting by the manner\r\nin which he was wielded the moving passion of the wielder, and adapting\r\nhis whole nature with marvellous dexterity to gratify that passion\r\naccording to the character of him whom it possessed; now by a rough and\r\nready impetuosity, now by a deliberate and hidden advance; equally\r\nwilling to strike with the sword or to poison by calumny, as the man who\r\nmoved him lusted for the blood or sought to accomplish the dishonour of\r\nhis victim.\r\n\r\n  M. de Laubardemont arrived at Loudun during the month of August 1633,\r\n     and in order to carry out his mission addressed himself to Sieur\r\n     Memin de Silly, prefect of the town, that old friend of the\r\n     cardinal’s whom Mignon and Barre, as we have said, had impressed so\r\n     favourably. Memin saw in the arrival of Laubardemont a special\r\n     intimation that it was the will of Heaven that the seemingly lost\r\n     cause of those in whom he took such a warm interest should\r\n     ultimately triumph. He presented Mignon and all his friends to M.\r\n     Laubardemont, who received them with much cordiality. They talked\r\n     of the mother superior, who was a relation, as we have seen, of M.\r\n     de Laubardemont, and exaggerated the insult offered her by the\r\n     decree of the archbishop, saying it was an affront to the whole\r\n     family; and before long the one thing alone which occupied the\r\n     thoughts of the conspirators and the councillor was how best to\r\n     draw down upon Grandier the anger of the cardinal-duke. A way soon\r\n     opened.\r\n\r\nThe Queen mother, Marie de Medici, had among her attendants a woman\r\ncalled Hammon, to whom, having once had occasion to speak, she had taken\r\na fancy, and given a post near her person. In consequence of this whim,\r\nHammon came to be regarded as a person of some importance in the queen’s\r\nhousehold. Hammon was a native of Loudun, and had passed the greater\r\npart of her youth there with her own people, who belonged to the lower\r\nclasses. Grandier had been her confessor, and she attended his church,\r\nand as she was lively and clever he enjoyed talking to her, so that at\r\nlength an intimacy sprang up between them. It so happened at a time when\r\nhe and the other ministers were in momentary disgrace, that a satire\r\nfull of biting wit and raillery appeared, directed especially against\r\nthe cardinal, and this satire had been attributed to Hammon, who was\r\nknown to share, as was natural, her mistress’s hatred of Richelieu.\r\nProtected as she was by the queen’s favour, the cardinal had found it\r\nimpossible to punish Hammon, but he still cherished a deep resentment\r\nagainst her.\r\n\r\nIt now occurred to the conspirators to accuse Grandier of being the real\r\nauthor of the satire; and it was asserted that he had learned from\r\nHammon all the details of the cardinal’s private life, the knowledge of\r\nwhich gave so much point to the attack on him; if they could once\r\nsucceed in making Richelieu believe this, Grandier was lost.\r\n\r\nThis plan being decided on, M. de Laubardemont was asked to visit the\r\nconvent, and the devils knowing what an important personage he was,\r\nflocked thither to give him a worthy welcome. Accordingly, the nuns had\r\nattacks of the most indescribably violent convulsions, and M. de\r\nLaubardemont returned to Paris convinced as to the reality of their\r\npossession.\r\n\r\nThe first word the councillor of state said to the cardinal about Urbain\r\nGrandier showed him that he had taken useless trouble in inventing the\r\nstory about the satire, for by the bare mention of his name he was able\r\nto arouse the cardinal’s anger to any height he wished. The fact was,\r\nthat when Richelieu had been Prior of Coussay he and Grandier had had a\r\nquarrel on a question of etiquette, the latter as priest of Loudun\r\nhaving claimed precedence over the prior, and carried his point. The\r\ncardinal had noted the affront in his bloodstained tablets, and at the\r\nfirst hint de Laubardemont found him as eager to bring about Grandier’s\r\nruin as was the councillor himself.\r\n\r\nDe Laubardemont was at once granted the following commission:\r\n\r\n\"Sieur de Laubardemont, Councillor of State and Privy Councillor, will\r\nbetake himself to Loudun, and to whatever other places may be necessary,\r\nto institute proceedings against Grandier on all the charges formerly\r\npreferred against him, and on other facts which have since come to\r\nlight, touching the possession by evil spirits of the Ursuline nuns of\r\nLoudun, and of other persons, who are said like wise to be tormented of\r\ndevils through the evil practices of the said Grandier; he will\r\ndiligently investigate everything from the beginning that has any\r\nbearing either on the said possession or on the exorcisms, and will\r\nforward to us his report thereon, and the reports and other documents\r\nsent in by former commissioners and delegates, and will be present at\r\nall future exorcisms, and take proper steps to obtain evidence of the\r\nsaid facts, that they may be clearly established; and, above all, will\r\ndirect, institute, and carry through the said proceedings against\r\nGrandier and all others who have been involved with him in the said\r\ncase, until definitive sentence be passed; and in spite of any appeal or\r\ncountercharge this cause will not be delayed (but without prejudice to\r\nthe right of appeal in other causes), on account of the nature of the\r\ncrimes, and no regard will be paid to any request for postponement made\r\nby the said Grandier. His majesty commands all governors, provincial\r\nlieutenant-generals, bailiffs, seneschals, and other municipal\r\nauthorities, and all subjects whom it may concern, to give every\r\nassistance in arresting and imprisoning all persons whom it may be\r\nnecessary to put under constraint, if they shall be required so to do.\"\r\n\r\nFurnished with this order, which was equivalent to a condemnation, de\r\nLaubardemont arrived at Laudun, the 5th of December, 1633, at nine\r\no’clock in the evening; and to avoid being seen he alighted in a suburb\r\nat the house of one maitre Paul Aubin, king’s usher, and son-in-law of\r\nMemin de Silly. His arrival was kept so secret that neither Grandier nor\r\nhis friends knew of it, but Memin, Herve Menuau, and Mignon were\r\nnotified, and immediately called on him. De Laubardemont received them,\r\ncommission in hand, but broad as it was, it did not seem to them\r\nsufficient, for it contained no order for Grandier’s arrest, and\r\nGrandier might fly. De Laubardemont, smiling at the idea that he could\r\nbe so much in fault, drew from his pocket an order in duplicate, in case\r\none copy should be lost, dated like the commission, November 30th,\r\nsigned LOUIS, and countersigned PHILIPPEAUX. It was conceived in the\r\nfollowing terms:\r\n\r\nLOUIS, etc. etc. \"We have entrusted these presents to Sieur de\r\nLaubardemont, Privy Councillor, to empower the said Sieur de\r\nLaubardemont to arrest Grandier and his accomplices and imprison them in\r\na secure place, with orders to all provosts, marshals, and other\r\nofficers, and to all our subjects in general, to lend whatever\r\nassistance is necessary to carry out above order; and they are commanded\r\nby these presents to obey all orders given by the said Sieur; and all\r\ngovernors and lieutenants-general are also hereby commanded to furnish\r\nthe said Sieur with whatever aid he may require at their hands.\"\r\n\r\nThis document being the completion of the other, it was immediately\r\nresolved, in order to show that they had the royal authority at their\r\nback, and as a preventive measure, to arrest Grandier at once, without\r\nany preliminary investigation. They hoped by this step to intimidate any\r\nofficial who might still be inclined to take Grandier’s part, and any\r\nwitness who might be disposed to testify in his favour. Accordingly,\r\nthey immediately sent for Guillaume Aubin, Sieur de Lagrange and\r\nprovost’s lieutenant. De Laubardemont communicated to him the commission\r\nof the cardinal and the order of the king, and requested him to arrest\r\nGrandier early next morning. M. de Lagrange could not deny the two\r\nsignatures, and answered that he would obey; but as he foresaw from\r\ntheir manner of going to work that the proceedings about to be\r\ninstituted would be an assassination and not a fair trial, he sent, in\r\nspite of being a distant connection of Memin, whose daughter was married\r\nto his (Lagrange’s) brother, to warn Grandier of the orders he had\r\nreceived. But Grandier with his usual intrepidity, while thanking\r\nLagrange for his generous message, sent back word that, secure in his\r\ninnocence and relying on the justice of God, he was determined to stand\r\nhis ground.\r\n\r\nSo Grandier remained, and his brother, who slept beside him, declared\r\nthat his sleep that night was as quiet as usual. The next morning he\r\nrose, as was his habit, at six o’clock, took his breviary in his hand,\r\nand went out with the intention of attending matins at the church of\r\nSainte-Croix. He had hardly put his foot over the threshold before\r\nLagrange, in the presence of Memin, Mignon, and the other conspirators,\r\nwho had come out to gloat over the sight, arrested him in the name of\r\nthe king. He was at once placed in the custody of Jean Pouguet, an\r\narcher in His Majesty’s guards, and of the archers of the provosts of\r\nLoudun and Chinon, to be taken to the castle at Angers. Meanwhile a\r\nsearch was instituted, and the royal seal affixed to the doors of his\r\napartments, to his presses, his other articles of furniture-in fact, to\r\nevery thing and place in the house; but nothing was found that tended to\r\ncompromise him, except an essay against the celibacy of priests, and two\r\nsheets of paper whereon were written in another hand than his, some\r\nlove-poems in the taste of that time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nFor four months Grandier languished in prison, and, according to the\r\nreport of Michelon, commandant of Angers, and of Pierre Bacher, his\r\nconfessor, he was, during the whole period, a model of patience and\r\nfirmness, passing his days in reading good books or in writing prayers\r\nand meditations, which were afterwards produced at his trial. Meanwhile,\r\nin spite of the urgent appeals of Jeanne Esteye, mother of the accused,\r\nwho, although seventy years of age, seemed to recover her youthful\r\nstrength and activity in the desire to save her son, Laubardemont\r\ncontinued the examination, which was finished on April 4th. Urbain was\r\nthen brought back from Angers to Loudun.\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary cell had been prepared for him in a house belonging to\r\nMignon, and which had formerly been occupied by a sergeant named\r\nBontems, once clerk to Trinquant, who had been a witness for the\r\nprosecution in the first trial. It was on the topmost story; the windows\r\nhad been walled up, leaving only one small slit open, and even this\r\nopening was secured by enormous iron bars; and by an exaggeration of\r\ncaution the mouth of the fireplace was furnished with a grating, lest\r\nthe devils should arrive through the chimney to free the sorcerer from\r\nhis chains. Furthermore, two holes in the corners of the room, so formed\r\nthat they were unnoticeable from within, allowed a constant watch to be\r\nkept over Grandier’s movements by Bontem’s wife, a precaution by which\r\nthey hoped to learn something that would help them in the coming\r\nexorcisms. In this room, lying on a little straw, and almost without\r\nlight, Grandier wrote the following letter to his mother:\r\n\r\n\"MY MOTHER,—I received your letter and everything you sent me except the\r\nwoollen stockings. I endure any affliction with patience, and feel more\r\npity for you than for myself. I am very much inconvenienced for want of\r\na bed; try and have mine brought to me, for my mind will give way if my\r\nbody has no rest: if you can, send me a breviary, a Bible, and a St.\r\nThomas for my consolation; and above all, do not grieve for me. I trust\r\nthat, God will bring my innocence to light. Commend me to my brother and\r\nsister, and all our good friends.—I am, mother, your dutiful son and\r\nservant, \"GRANDIER\"\r\n\r\nWhile Grandier had been in prison at Angers the cases of possession at\r\nthe convent had miraculously multiplied, for it was no longer only the\r\nsuperior and Sister Claire who had fallen a prey to the evil spirits,\r\nbut also several other sisters, who were divided into three groups as\r\nfollows, and separated:—\r\n\r\nThe superior, with Sisters Louise des Anges and Anne de Sainte-Agnes,\r\nwere sent to the house of Sieur Delaville, advocate, legal adviser to\r\nthe sisterhood; Sisters Claire and Catherine de la Presentation were\r\nplaced in the house of Canon Maurat; Sisters Elisabeth de la Croix,\r\nMonique de Sainte-Marthe, Jeanne du Sainte-Esprit, and Seraphique Archer\r\nwere in a third house.\r\n\r\nA general supervision was undertaken by Memin’s sister, the wife of\r\nMoussant, who was thus closely connected with two of the greatest\r\nenemies of the accused, and to her Bontems’ wife told all that the\r\nsuperior needed to know about Grandier. Such was the manner of the\r\nsequestration!\r\n\r\nThe choice of physicians was no less extraordinary. Instead of calling\r\nin the most skilled practitioners of Angers, Tours, Poitiers, or Saumur,\r\nall of them, except Daniel Roger of Loudun, came from the surrounding\r\nvillages, and were men of no education: one of them, indeed, had failed\r\nto obtain either degree or licence, and had been obliged to leave Saumur\r\nin consequence; another had been employed in a small shop to take goods\r\nhome, a position he had exchanged for the more lucrative one of quack.\r\n\r\nThere was just as little sense of fairness and propriety shown in the\r\nchoice of the apothecary and surgeon. The apothecary, whose name was\r\nAdam, was Mignon’s first cousin, and had been one of the witnesses for\r\nthe prosecution at Grandier’s first trial; and as on that occasion—he\r\nhad libelled a young girl of Loudun, he had been sentenced by a decree\r\nof Parliament to make a public apology. And yet, though his hatred of\r\nGrandier in consequence of this humiliation was so well known,—perhaps\r\nfor that very reason, it was to him the duty of dispensing and\r\nadministering the prescriptions was entrusted, no one supervising the\r\nwork even so far as to see that the proper doses were given, or taking\r\nnote whether for sedatives he did not sometimes substitute stimulating\r\nand exciting drugs, capable of producing real convulsions. The surgeon\r\nMannouri was still more unsuitable, for he was a nephew of Memin de\r\nSilly, and brother of the nun who had offered the most determined\r\nopposition to Grandier’s demand for sequestration of the possessed\r\nsisters, during the second series of exorcisms. In vain did the mother\r\nand brother of the accused present petitions setting forth the\r\nincapacity of the doctors and the hatred of Grandier professed by the\r\napothecary; they could not, even at their own expense, obtain certified\r\ncopies of any of these petitions, although they had witnesses ready to\r\nprove that Adam had once in his ignorance dispensed crocus metallorum\r\nfor crocus mantis—a mistake which had caused the death of the patient\r\nfor whom the prescription was made up. In short, so determined were the\r\nconspirators that this time Grandier should be done to death, that they\r\nhad not even the decency to conceal the infamous methods by which they\r\nhad arranged to attain this result.\r\n\r\nThe examination was carried on with vigour. As one of the first\r\nformalities would be the identification of the accused, Grandier\r\npublished a memorial in which he recalled the case of Saint-Anastasius\r\nat the Council of Tyre, who had been accused of immorality by a fallen\r\nwoman whom he had never seen before. When this woman entered the hall of\r\njustice in order to swear to her deposition, a priest named Timothy went\r\nup to her and began to talk to her as if he were Anastasius; falling\r\ninto the trap, she answered as if she recognised him, and thus the\r\ninnocence of the saint was shown forth. Grandier therefore demanded that\r\ntwo or three persons of his own height and complexion should be dressed\r\nexactly like himself, and with him should be allowed to confront the\r\nnuns. As he had never seen any of them, and was almost certain they had\r\nnever seen him, they would not be able, he felt sure, to point him out\r\nwith certainty, in spite of the allegations of undue intimacy with\r\nthemselves they brought against him. This demand showed such conscious\r\ninnocence that it was embarrassing to answer, so no notice was taken of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Bishop of Poitiers, who felt much elated at getting the\r\nbetter of the Archbishop of Bordeaux, who of course was powerless\r\nagainst an order issued by the cardinal-duke, took exception to Pere\r\nl’Escaye and Pere Gaut, the exorcists appointed by his superior, and\r\nnamed instead his own chaplain, who had been judge at Grandier’s first\r\ntrial, and had passed sentence on him, and Pere Lactance, a Franciscan\r\nmonk. These two, making no secret of the side with which they\r\nsympathised, put up on their arrival at Nicolas Moussant’s, one of\r\nGrandier’s most bitter enemies; on the following day they went to the\r\nsuperior’s apartments and began their exorcisms. The first time the\r\nsuperior opened her lips to reply, Pere Lactance perceived that she knew\r\nalmost no Latin, and consequently would not shine during the exorcism,\r\nso he ordered her to answer in French, although he still continued to\r\nexorcise her in Latin; and when someone was bold enough to object,\r\nsaying that the devil, according to the ritual, knew all languages\r\nliving and dead, and ought to reply in the same language in which he was\r\naddressed, the father declared that the incongruity was caused by the\r\npact, and that moreover some devils were more ignorant than peasants.\r\n\r\nFollowing these exorcists, and two Carmelite monks, named Pierre de\r\nSaint-Thomas and Pierre de Saint-Mathurin, who had, from the very\r\nbeginning, pushed their way in when anything was going on, came four\r\nCapuchins sent by Pere Joseph, head of the Franciscans, \"His grey\r\nEminence,\" as he was called, and whose names were Peres Luc, Tranquille,\r\nPotais, and Elisee; so that a much more rapid advance could be made than\r\nhitherto by carrying on the exorcisms in four different places at\r\nonce—viz., in the convent, and in the churches of Sainte-Croix,\r\nSaint-Pierre du Martroy, and Notre-Dame du Chateau. Very little of\r\nimportance took place, however, on the first two occasions, the 15th and\r\n16th of April; for the declarations of the doctors were most vague and\r\nindefinite, merely saying that the things they had seen were\r\nsupernatural, surpassing their knowledge and the rules of medicine.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of the 23rd April presented, however, some points of\r\ninterest. The superior, in reply to the interrogations of Pere Lactance,\r\nstated that the demon had entered her body under the forms of a cat, a\r\ndog, a stag, and a buck-goat.\r\n\r\n\"Quoties?\" (How often?), inquired the exorcist.\r\n\r\n\"I didn’t notice the day,\" replied the superior, mistaking the word\r\nquoties for quando (when).\r\n\r\nIt was probably to revenge herself for this error that the superior\r\ndeclared the same day that Grandier had on his body five marks made by\r\nthe devil, and that though his body was else insensible to pain, he was\r\nvulnerable at those spots. Mannouri, the surgeon, was therefore ordered\r\nto verify this assertion, and the day appointed for the verification was\r\nthe 26th.\r\n\r\nIn virtue of this mandate Mannouri presented himself early on that day\r\nat Grandier’s prison, caused him to be stripped naked and cleanly\r\nshaven, then ordered him to be laid on a table and his eyes bandaged.\r\nBut the devil was wrong again: Grandier had only two marks, instead of\r\nfive—one on the shoulder-blade, and the other on the thigh.\r\n\r\nThen took place one of the most abominable performances that can be\r\nimagined. Mannouri held in his hand a probe, with a hollow handle, into\r\nwhich the needle slipped when a spring was touched: when Mannouri\r\napplied the probe to those parts of Grandier’s body which, according to\r\nthe superior, were insensible, he touched the spring, and the needle,\r\nwhile seeming to bury itself in the flesh, really retreated into the\r\nhandle, thus causing no pain; but when he touched one of the marks said\r\nto be vulnerable, he left the needle fixed, and drove it in to the depth\r\nof several inches. The first time he did this it drew from poor\r\nGrandier, who was taken unprepared, such a piercing cry that it was\r\nheard in the street by the crowd which had gathered round the door. From\r\nthe mark on the shoulder-blade with which he had commenced, Mannouri\r\npassed to that on the thigh, but though he plunged the needle in to its\r\nfull depth Grandier uttered neither cry nor groan, but went on quietly\r\nrepeating a prayer, and notwithstanding that Mannouri stabbed him twice\r\nmore through each of the two marks, he could draw nothing from his\r\nvictim but prayers for his tormentors.\r\n\r\n  M. de Laubardemont was present at this scene.\r\n\r\nThe next day the devil was addressed in such forcible terms that an\r\nacknowledgment was wrung from him that Grandier’s body bore, not five,\r\nbut two marks only; and also, to the vast admiration of the spectators,\r\nhe was able this time to indicate their precise situation.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the demon, a joke in which he indulged on this\r\noccasion detracted from the effect of the above proof of cleverness.\r\nHaving been asked why he had refused to speak on the preceding Saturday,\r\nhe said he had not been at Loudun on that day, as the whole morning he\r\nhad been occupied in accompanying the soul of a certain Le Proust,\r\nattorney to the Parliament of Paris, to hell. This answer awoke such\r\ndoubts in the breasts of some of the laymen present that they took the\r\ntrouble to examine the register of deaths, and found that no one of the\r\nname of Le Proust, belonging to any profession whatever, had died on\r\nthat date. This discovery rendered the devil less terrible, and perhaps\r\nless amusing.\r\n\r\nMeantime the progress of the other exorcisms met with like\r\ninterruptions. Pere Pierre de Saint Thomas, who conducted the operations\r\nin the Carmelite church, asked one of the possessed sisters where\r\nGrandier’s books of magic were; she replied that they were kept at the\r\nhouse of a certain young girl, whose name she gave, and who was the same\r\nto whom Adam had been forced to apologise. De Laubardemont, Moussant,\r\nHerve, and Meunau hastened at once to the house indicated, searched the\r\nrooms and the presses, opened the chests and the wardrobes and all the\r\nsecret places in the house, but in vain. On their return to the church,\r\nthey reproached the devil for having deceived them, but he explained\r\nthat a niece of the young woman had removed the books. Upon this, they\r\nhurried to the niece’s dwelling, but unluckily she was not at home,\r\nhaving spent the whole day at a certain church making her devotions, and\r\nwhen they went thither, the priests and attendants averred that she had\r\nnot gone out all day; so notwithstanding the desire of the exorcists to\r\noblige Adam they were forced to let the matter drop.\r\n\r\nThese two false statements increased the number of unbelievers; but it\r\nwas announced that a most interesting performance would take place on\r\nMay 4th; indeed, the programme when issued was varied enough to arouse\r\ngeneral curiosity. Asmodeus was to raise the superior two feet from the\r\nground, and the fiends Eazas and Cerberus, in emulation of their leader,\r\nwould do as much for two other nuns; while a fourth devil, named\r\nBeherit, would go farther still, and, greatly daring, would attack M. de\r\nLaubardemont himself, and, having spirited his councillor’s cap from his\r\nhead, would hold it suspended in the air for the space of a Misereye.\r\nFurthermore, the exorcists announced that six of the strongest men in\r\nthe town would try to prevent the contortions of the, weakest of the\r\nconvulsed nuns, and would fail.\r\n\r\nIt need hardly be said that the prospect of such an entertainment filled\r\nthe church on the appointed day to overflowing. Pere Lactance began by\r\ncalling on Asmodeus to fulfil his promise of raising the superior from\r\nthe ground. She began, hereupon, to perform various evolutions on her\r\nmattress, and at one moment it seemed as if she were really suspended in\r\nthe air; but one of the spectators lifted her dress and showed that she\r\nwas only standing on tiptoe, which, though it might be clever, was not\r\nmiraculous. Shouts of laughter rent the air, which had such an\r\nintimidating effect on Eazas and Cerberus that not all the adjurations\r\nof the exorcists could extract the slightest response. Beherit was their\r\nlast hope, and he replied that he was prepared to lift up M. de\r\nLaubardemont’s cap, and would do so before the expiration of a quarter\r\nof an hour.\r\n\r\nWe must here remark that this time the exorcisms took place in the\r\nevening, instead of in the morning as hitherto; and it was now growing\r\ndark, and darkness is favourable to illusions. Several of the\r\nunbelieving ones present, therefore, began to call attention to the fact\r\nthat the quarter of an hour’s delay would necessitate the employment of\r\nartificial light during the next scene. They also noticed that M. de\r\nLaubardemont had seated himself apart and immediately beneath one of the\r\narches in the vaulted roof, through which a hole had been drilled for\r\nthe passage of the bell-rope. They therefore slipped out of the church,\r\nand up into the belfry, where they hid. In a few moments a man appeared\r\nwho began to work at something. They sprang on him and seized his\r\nwrists, and found in one of his hands a thin line of horsehair, to one\r\nend of which a hook was attached. The holder being frightened, dropped\r\nthe line and fled, and although M. de Laubardemont, the exorcists, and\r\nthe spectators waited, expecting every moment that the cap would rise\r\ninto the air, it remained quite firm on the owner’s head, to the no\r\nsmall confusion of Pere Lactance, who, all unwitting of the fiasco,\r\ncontinued to adjure Beherit to keep his word—of course without the least\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nAltogether, this performance of May 4th, went anything but smoothly.\r\nTill now no trick had succeeded; never before had the demons been such\r\nbunglers. But the exorcists were sure that the last trick would go off\r\nwithout a hitch. This was, that a nun, held by six men chosen for their\r\nstrength, would succeed in extricating herself from their grasp, despite\r\ntheir utmost efforts. Two Carmelites and two Capuchins went through the\r\naudience and selected six giants from among the porters and messengers\r\nof the town.\r\n\r\nThis time the devil answered expectations by showing that if he was not\r\nclever he was strong, for although the six men tried to hold her down\r\nupon her mattress, the superior was seized with such terrible\r\nconvulsions that she escaped from their hands, throwing down one of\r\nthose who tried to detain her. This experiment, thrice renewed,\r\nsucceeded thrice, and belief seemed about to return to the assembly,\r\nwhen a physician of Saumur named Duncan, suspecting trickery, entered\r\nthe choir, and, ordering the six men to retire, said he was going to try\r\nand hold the superior down unaided, and if she escaped from his hands he\r\nwould make a public apology for his unbelief. M. de Laubardemont tried\r\nto prevent this test, by objecting to Duncan as an atheist, but as\r\nDuncan was greatly respected on account of his skill and probity, there\r\nwas such an outcry at this interference from the entire audience that\r\nthe commissioner was forced to let him have his way. The six porters\r\nwere therefore dismissed, but instead of resuming their places among the\r\nspectators they left the church by the sacristy, while Duncan\r\napproaching the bed on which the superior had again lain down, seized\r\nher by the wrist, and making certain that he had a firm hold, he told\r\nthe exorcists to begin.\r\n\r\nNever up to that time had it been so clearly shown that the conflict\r\ngoing on was between public opinion and the private aims of a few. A\r\nhush fell on the church; everyone stood motionless in silent expectancy.\r\n\r\nThe moment Pere Lactance uttered the sacred words the convulsions of the\r\nsuperior recommenced; but it seemed as if Duncan had more strength than\r\nhis six predecessors together, for twist and writhe and struggle as she\r\nwould, the superior’s wrist remained none the less firmly clasped in\r\nDuncan’s hand. At length she fell back on her bed exhausted,\r\nexclaiming!\"\r\n\r\n\"It’s no use, it’s no use! He’s holding me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Release her arm!\" shouted Pere Lactance in a rage. \"How can the\r\nconvulsions take place if you hold her that way?\"\r\n\r\n\"If she is really possessed by a demon,\" answered Duncan aloud, \"he\r\nshould be stronger than I; for it is stated in the ritual that among the\r\nsymptoms of possession is strength beyond one’s years, beyond one’s\r\ncondition, and beyond what is natural.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is badly argued,\" said Lactance sharply: \"a demon outside the body\r\nis indeed stronger than you, but when enclosed in a weak frame such as\r\nthis it cannot show such strength, for its efforts are proportioned to\r\nthe strength of the body it possesses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough!\" said M. de Laubardemont; \"we did not come here to argue with\r\nphilosophers, but to build up the faith of Christians.\"\r\n\r\nWith that he rose up from his chair amidst a terrible uproar, and the\r\nassembly dispersed in the utmost disorder, as if they were leaving a\r\ntheatre rather than a church.\r\n\r\nThe ill success of this exhibition caused a cessation of events of\r\ninterest for some days. The result was that a great number of noblemen\r\nand other people of quality who had come to Loudun expecting to see\r\nwonders and had been shown only commonplace transparent tricks, began to\r\nthink it was not worth while remaining any longer, and went their\r\nseveral ways—a defection much bewailed by Pere Tranquille in a little\r\nwork which he published on this affair.\r\n\r\n\"Many,\" he says, \"came to see miracles at Loudun, but finding the devils\r\ndid not give them the signs they expected, they went away dissatisfied,\r\nand swelled the numbers of the unbelieving.\"\r\n\r\nIt was determined, therefore, in order to keep the town full, to predict\r\nsome great event which would revive curiosity and increase faith. Pere\r\nLactance therefore announced that on the 20th of May three of the seven\r\ndevils dwelling in the superior would come out, leaving three wounds in\r\nher left side, with corresponding holes in her chemise, bodice, and\r\ndress. The three parting devils were Asmodeus, Gresil des Trones, and\r\nAman des Puissances. He added that the superior’s hands would be bound\r\nbehind her back at the time the wounds were given.\r\n\r\nOn the appointed day the church of Sainte-Croix was filled to\r\noverflowing with sightseers curious to know if the devils would keep\r\ntheir promises better this time than the last. Physicians were invited\r\nto examine the superior’s side and her clothes; and amongst those who\r\ncame forward was Duncan, whose presence guaranteed the public against\r\ndeception; but none of the exorcists ventured to exclude him, despite\r\nthe hatred in which they held him—a hatred which they would have made\r\nhim feel if he had not been under the special protection of Marshal\r\nBreze. The physicians having completed their examination, gave the\r\nfollowing certificate:—\r\n\r\n\"We have found no wound in the patient’s side, no rent in her vestments,\r\nand our search revealed no sharp instrument hidden in the folds of her\r\ndress.\"\r\n\r\nThese preliminaries having been got through, Pere Lactance questioned\r\nher in French for nearly two hours, her answers being in the same\r\nlanguage. Then he passed from questions to adjurations: on this, Duncan\r\ncame forward, and said a promise had been given that the superior’s\r\nhands should be tied behind her back, in order that there might be no\r\nroom for suspicion of fraud, and that the moment had now arrived to keep\r\nthat promise. Pere Lactance admitted the justice of the demand, but said\r\nas there were many present who had never seen the superior in\r\nconvulsions such as afflicted the possessed, it would be only fair that\r\nshe should be exorcised for their satisfaction before binding her.\r\nAccordingly he began to repeat the form of exorcism, and the superior\r\nwas immediately attacked by frightful convulsions, which in a few\r\nminutes produced complete exhaustion, so that she fell on her face to\r\nthe ground, and turning on her left arm and side, remained motionless\r\nsome instants, after which she uttered a low cry, followed by a groan.\r\nThe physicians approached her, and Duncan seeing her take away her hand\r\nfrom her left side, seized her arm, and found that the tips of her\r\nfingers were stained with blood. They then examined her clothing and\r\nbody, and found her dress, bodice, and chemise cut through in three\r\nplaces, the cuts being less than an inch long. There were also three\r\nscratches beneath the left breast, so slight as to be scarcely more than\r\nskin deep, the middle one being a barleycorn in length; still, from all\r\nthree a sufficient quantity of blood had oozed to stain the chemise\r\nabove them.\r\n\r\nThis time the fraud was so glaring that even de Laubardemont exhibited\r\nsome signs of confusion because of the number and quality of the\r\nspectators. He would not, however, allow the doctors to include in their\r\nreport their opinion as to the manner in which the wounds were\r\ninflicted; but Grandier protested against this in a Statement of Facts,\r\nwhich he drew up during the night, and which was distributed next day.\r\n\r\nIt was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"That if the superior had not groaned the physicians would not have\r\nremoved her clothes, and would have suffered her to be bound, without\r\nhaving the least idea that the wounds were already made; that then the\r\nexorcists would have commanded the devils to come forth, leaving the\r\ntraces they had promised; that the superior would then have gone through\r\nthe most extraordinary contortions of which she was capable, and have\r\nhad a long fit of, convulsions, at the end of which she would have been\r\ndelivered from the three demons, and the wounds would have been found in\r\nher body; that her groans, which had betrayed her, had by God’s will\r\nthwarted the best-laid plans of men and devils. Why do you suppose,\" he\r\nwent on to ask, \"that clean incised wounds, such as a sharp blade would\r\nmake, ’were chosen for a token, seeing that the wounds left by devils\r\nresemble burns? Was it not because it was easier for the superior to\r\nconceal a lancet with which to wound herself slightly, than to conceal\r\nany instrument sufficiently heated to burn her? Why do you think the\r\nleft side was chosen rather than the forehead and nose, if not because\r\nshe could not give herself a wound in either of those places without\r\nbeing seen by all the spectators? Why was the left side rather than the\r\nright chosen, if it were not that it was easier for the superior to\r\nwound herself with her right hand, which she habitually used, in the\r\nleft side than in the right? Why did she turn on her left side and arm\r\nand remain so long in that position, if it were not to hide from the\r\nbystanders the instrument with which she wounded herself? What do you\r\nthink caused her to groan, in spite of all her resolution, if it were\r\nnot the pain of the wound she gave herself? for the most courageous\r\ncannot repress a shudder when the surgeon opens a vein. Why were her\r\nfinger-tips stained with blood, if it were not that the secreted blade\r\nwas so small that the fingers which held it could not escape being\r\nreddened by the blood it caused to flow? How came it that the wounds\r\nwere so superficial that they barely went deeper than the cuticle, while\r\ndevils are known to rend and tear demoniacs when leaving them, if it\r\nwere not that the superior did not hate herself enough to inflict deep\r\nand dangerous wounds?\"\r\n\r\nDespite this logical protest from Grandier and the barefaced knavery of\r\nthe exorcist, M. de Laubardemont prepared a report of the expulsion of\r\nthe three devils, Asmodeus, Gresil, and Aman, from the body of sister\r\nJeanne des Anges, through three wounds below the region of the heart; a\r\nreport which was afterwards shamelessly used against Grandier, and of\r\nwhich the memorandum still exists, a monument, not so much of credulity\r\nand superstition, as of hatred and revenge. Pere Lactance, in order to\r\nallay the suspicions which the pretended miracle had aroused among the\r\neye-wittnesses, asked Balaam, one of the four demons who still remained\r\nin the superior’s body, the following day, why Asmodeus and his two\r\ncompanions had gone out against their promise, while the superior’s face\r\nand hands were hidden from the people.\r\n\r\n\"To lengthen the incredulity of certain people,\" answered Balaam.\r\n\r\nAs for Pere Tranquille, he published a little volume describing the\r\nwhole affair, in which, with the irresponsible frivolity of a true\r\nCapuchin, he poked fun at those who could not swallow the miracles\r\nwholesale.\r\n\r\n\"They had every reason to feel vexed,\" he said, \"at the small courtesy\r\nor civility shown by the demons to persons of their merit and station;\r\nbut if they had examined their consciences, perhaps they would have\r\nfound the real reason of their discontent, and, turning their anger\r\nagainst themselves, would have done penance for having come to the\r\nexorcisms led by a depraved moral sense and a prying spirit.\"\r\n\r\nNothing remarkable happened from the 20th May till the 13th June, a day\r\nwhich became noteworthy by reason of the superior’s vomiting a quill a\r\nfinger long. It was doubtless this last miracle which brought the Bishop\r\nof Poitiers to Loudun, \"not,\" as he said to those who came to pay their\r\nrespects to him, \"to examine into the genuineness of the possession, but\r\nto force those to believe who still doubted, and to discover the classes\r\nwhich Urbain had founded to teach the black art to pupils of both\r\nsexes.\"\r\n\r\nThereupon the opinion began to prevail among the people that it would be\r\nprudent to believe in the possession, since the king, the cardinal-duke,\r\nand the bishop believed in it, and that continued doubt would lay them\r\nopen to the charges of disloyalty to their king and their Church, and of\r\ncomplicity in the crimes of Grandier, and thus draw down upon them the\r\nruthless punishment of Laubardemont.\r\n\r\n\"The reason we feel so certain that our work is pleasing to God is that\r\nit is also pleasing to the king,\" wrote Pere Lactance.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the bishop was followed by a new exorcism; and of this an\r\neye-witness, who was a good Catholic and a firm believer in possession,\r\nhas left us a written description, more interesting than any we could\r\ngive. We shall present it to our readers, word for word, as it stands:—\r\n\r\n\"On Friday, 23rd June 1634, on the Eve of Saint John, about 3 p.m., the\r\nLord Bishop of Poitiers and M. de Laubardemont being present in the\r\nchurch of Sainte-Croix of Loudun, to continue the exorcisms of the\r\nUrsuline nuns, by order of M. de Laubardemont, commissioner, Urbain\r\nGrandier, priest-in-charge, accused and denounced as a magician by the\r\nsaid possessed nuns, was brought from his prison to the said church.\r\n\r\n\"There were produced by the said commissioner to the said Urbain\r\nGrandier four pacts mentioned several times by the said possessed nuns\r\nat the preceding exorcisms, which the devils who possessed the nuns\r\ndeclared they had made with the said Grandier on several occasions:\r\nthere was one in especial which Leviathan gave up on Saturday the 17th\r\ninst., composed of an infant’s heart procured at a witches’ sabbath,\r\nheld in Orleans in 1631; the ashes of a consecrated wafer, blood, etc.,\r\nof the said Grandier, whereby Leviathan asserted he had entered the body\r\nof the sister, Jeanne des Anges, the superior of the said nuns, and took\r\npossession of her with his coadjutors Beherit, Eazas, and Balaam, on\r\nDecember 8th, 1632. Another such pact was composed of the pips of\r\nGrenada oranges, and was given up by Asmodeus and a number of other\r\ndevils. It had been made to hinder Beherit from keeping his promise to\r\nlift the commissioner’s hat two inches from his head and to hold it\r\nthere the length of a Miseyere, as a sign that he had come out of the\r\nnun. On all these pacts being shown to the said Grandier, he said,\r\nwithout astonishment, but with much firmness and resolution, that he had\r\nno knowledge of them whatever, that he had never made them, and had not\r\nthe skill by which to make them, that he had held no communication with\r\ndevils, and knew nothing of what they were talking about. A report of\r\nall this being made and shown to him, he signed it.\r\n\r\n\"This done, they brought all the possessed nuns, to the number of eleven\r\nor twelve, including three lay sisters, also possessed, into the choir\r\nof the said church, accompanied by a great many monks, Carmelites,\r\nCapuchins, and Franciscans; and by three physicians and a surgeon. The\r\nsisters on entering made some wanton remarks, calling Grandier their\r\nmaster, and exhibiting great delight at seeing him.\r\n\r\n\"Thereupon Pere Lactance and Gabriel, a Franciscan brother, and one of\r\nthe exorcists, exhorted all present with great fervour to lift up their\r\nhearts to God and to make an act of contrition for the offences\r\ncommitted against His divine majesty, and to pray that the number of\r\ntheir sins might not be an obstacle to the fulfilment of the plans which\r\nHe in His providence had formed for the promotion of His glory on that\r\noccasion, and to give outward proof of their heartfelt grief by\r\nrepeating the Confiteor as a preparation for the blessing of the Lord\r\nBishop of Poitiers. This having been done, he went on to say that the\r\nmatter in question was of such moment and so important in its relation\r\nto the great truths of the Roman Catholic Church, that this\r\nconsideration alone ought to be sufficient to excite their devotion; and\r\nfurthermore, that the affliction of these poor sisters was so peculiar\r\nand had lasted so long, that charity impelled all those who had the\r\nright to work for their deliverance and the expulsion of the devils, to\r\nemploy the power entrusted to them with their office in accomplishing so\r\nworthy a task by the forms of exorcism prescribed by the Church to its\r\nministers; then addressing Grandier, he said that he having been\r\nanointed as a priest belonged to this number, and that he ought to help\r\nwith all his power and with all his energy, if the bishop were pleased\r\nto allow him to do so, and to remit his suspension from authority. The\r\nbishop having granted permission, the Franciscan friar offered a stole\r\nto Grandier, who, turning towards the prelate, asked him if he might\r\ntake it. On receiving a reply in the affirmative, he passed it round his\r\nneck, and on being offered a copy of the ritual, he asked permission to\r\naccept it as before, and received the bishop’s blessing, prostrating\r\nhimself at his feet to kiss them; whereupon the Veni Creator Spiritus\r\nhaving been sung, he rose, and addressing the bishop, asked—\r\n\r\n\"’My lord, whom am I to exorcise?’\"\r\n\r\nThe said bishop having replied—\r\n\r\n\"’These maidens.’\r\n\r\n\"Grandier again asked—\r\n\r\n\"’What maidens?’\r\n\r\n\"’The possessed maidens,’ was the answer.\r\n\r\n\"’That is to say, my lord,’ said he; ’that I am obliged to believe in\r\nthe fact of possession. The Church believes in it, therefore I too\r\nbelieve; but I cannot believe that a sorcerer can cause a Christian to\r\nbe possessed unless the Christian consent.’\r\n\r\n\"Upon this, some of those present exclaimed that it was heretical to\r\nprofess such a belief; that the contrary was indubitable, believed by\r\nthe whole Church and approved by the Sorbonne. To which he replied that\r\nhis mind on that point was not yet irrevocably made up, that what he had\r\nsaid was simply his own idea, and that in any case he submitted to the\r\nopinion of the whole body of which he was only a member; that nobody was\r\ndeclared a heretic for having doubts, but only for persisting in them,\r\nand that what he had advanced was only for the purpose of drawing an\r\nassurance from the bishop that in doing what he was about to do he would\r\nnot be abusing the authority of the Church. Sister Catherine having been\r\nbrought to him by the Franciscan as the most ignorant of all the nuns,\r\nand the least open to the suspicion of being acquainted with Latin, he\r\nbegan the exorcism in the form prescribed by the ritual. But as soon as\r\nhe began to question her he was interrupted, for all the other nuns were\r\nattacked by devils, and uttered strange and terrible noises. Amongst the\r\nrest, Sister Claire came near, and reproached him for his blindness and\r\nobstinacy, so that he was forced to leave the nun with whom he had\r\nbegun, and address his words to the said Sister Claire, who during the\r\nentire duration of the exorcism continued to talk at random, without\r\npaying any heed to Grandier’s words, which were also interrupted by the\r\nmother superior, to whom he of last gave attention, leaving Sister\r\nClaire. But it is to be noted that before beginning to exorcise the\r\nsuperior, he said, speaking in Latin as heretofore, that knowing she\r\nunderstood Latin, he would question her in Greek. To which the devil\r\nreplied by the mouth of the possessed:\r\n\r\n\"’Ah! how clever you are! You know it was one of the first conditions of\r\nour pact that I was not to answer in Greek.’\r\n\r\n\"Upon this, he cried, ’O pulchra illusio, egregica evasio!’ ( O superb\r\nfraud, outrageous evasion!)\r\n\r\n\"He was then told that he was permitted to exorcise in Greek, provided\r\nhe first wrote down what he wished to say, and the superior hereupon\r\nsaid that he should be answered in what language he pleased; but it was\r\nimpossible, for as soon as he opened his mouth all the nuns recommenced\r\ntheir shrieks and paroxysms, showing unexampled despair, and giving way\r\nto convulsions, which in each patient assumed a new form, and persisting\r\nin accusing Grandier of using magic and the black art to torment them;\r\noffering to wring his neck if they were allowed, and trying to outrage\r\nhis feelings in every possible way. But this being against the\r\nprohibitions of the Church, the priests and monks present worked with\r\nthe utmost zeal to calm the frenzy which had seized on the nuns.\r\nGrandier meanwhile remained calm and unmoved, gazing fixedly at the\r\nmaniacs, protesting his innocence, and praying to God for protection.\r\nThen addressing himself to the bishop and M. de Laubardemont, he\r\nimplored them by the ecclesiastical and royal authority of which they\r\nwere the ministers to command these demons to wring his neck, or at\r\nleast to put a mark in his forehead, if he were guilty of the crime of\r\nwhich they accused him, that the glory of God might be shown forth, the\r\nauthority of the Church vindicated, and himself brought to confusion,\r\nprovided that the nuns did not touch him with their hands. But to this\r\nthe bishop and the commissioner would not consent, because they did not\r\nwant to be responsible for what might happen to him, neither would they\r\nexpose the authority of the Church to the wiles of the devils, who might\r\nhave made some pact on that point with Grandier. Then the exorcists, to\r\nthe number of eight, having commanded the devils to be silent and to\r\ncease their tumult, ordered a brazier to be brought, and into this they\r\nthrew the pacts one by one, whereupon the convulsions returned with such\r\nawful violence and confused cries, rising into frenzied shrieks, and\r\naccompanied by such horrible contortions, that the scene might have been\r\ntaken for an orgy of witches, were it not for the sanctity of the place\r\nand the character of those present, of whom Grandier, in outward seeming\r\nat least, was the least amazed of any, although he had the most reason.\r\nThe devils continued their accusations, citing the places, the days, and\r\nthe hours of their intercourse with him; the first spell he cast on\r\nthem, his scandalous behaviour, his insensibility, his abjurations of\r\nGod and the faith. To all this he calmly returned that these accusations\r\nwere calumnies, and all the more unjust considering his profession; that\r\nhe renounced Satan and all his fiends, having neither knowledge nor\r\ncomprehension of them; that in spite of all he was a Christian, and what\r\nwas more, an anointed priest; that though he knew himself to be a sinful\r\nman, yet his trust was in God and in His Christ; that he had never\r\nindulged in such abominations, and that it would be impossible to\r\nfurnish any pertinent and convincing proof of his guilt.\r\n\r\n\"At this point no words could express what the senses perceived; eyes\r\nand ears received an impression of being surrounded by furies such as\r\nhad never been gathered together before; and unless accustomed to such\r\nghastly scenes as those who sacrifice to demons, no one could keep his\r\nmind free from astonishment and horror in the midst of such a spectacle.\r\nGrandier alone remained unchanged through it all, seemingly insensible\r\nto the monstrous exhibitions, singing hymns to the Lord with the rest of\r\nthe people, as confident as if he were guarded by legions of angels. One\r\nof the demons cried out that Beelzebub was standing between him and Pere\r\nTranquille the Capuchin, upon which Grandier said to the demon—\r\n\r\n\"’Obmutescas!’ (Hold thy peace).\r\n\r\n\"Upon this the demon began to curse, and said that was their watchword;\r\nbut they could not hold their peace, because God was infinitely\r\npowerful, and the powers of hell could not prevail against Him.\r\nThereupon they all struggled to get at Grandier, threatening to tear him\r\nlimb from limb, to point out his marks, to strangle him although he was\r\ntheir master; whereupon he seized a chance to say he was neither their\r\nmaster nor their servant, and that it was incredible that they should in\r\nthe same breath acknowledge him for their master and express a desire to\r\nstrangle him: on hearing this, the frenzy of the nuns reached its\r\nheight, and they kicked their slippers into his face.\r\n\r\n\"’Just look!’ said he; ’the shoes drop from the hoofs of their own\r\naccord.’\r\n\r\n\"At length, had it not been for the help and interposition of people in\r\nthe choir, the nuns in their frenzy would have taken the life of the\r\nchief personage in this spectacle; so there was no choice but to take\r\nhim away from the church and the furies who threatened his life. He was\r\ntherefore brought back to prison about six o’clock in the evening, and\r\nthe rest of the day the exorcists were employed in calming the poor\r\nsisters—a task of no small difficulty.\"\r\n\r\nEveryone did not regard the possessed sisters with the indulgent eye of\r\nthe author of the above narrative, and many saw in this terrible\r\nexhibition of hysteria and convulsions an infamous and sacrilegious\r\norgy, at which revenge ran riot. There was such difference of opinion\r\nabout it that it was considered necessary to publish the following\r\nproclamation by means of placards on July 2nd:\r\n\r\n\"All persons, of whatever rank or profession, are hereby expressly\r\nforbidden to traduce, or in any way malign, the nuns and other persons\r\nat Loudun possessed by evil spirits; or their exorcists; or those who\r\naccompany them either to the places appointed for exorcism or elsewhere;\r\nin any form or manner whatever, on pain of a fine of ten thousand\r\nlivres, or a larger sum and corporal punishment should the case so\r\nrequire; and in order that no one may plead ignorance hereof, this\r\nproclamation will be read and published to-day from the pulpits of all\r\nthe churches, and copies affixed to the church doors and in other\r\nsuitable public places.\r\n\r\n\"Done at Loudun, July 2nd, 1634.\"\r\n\r\nThis order had great influence with worldly folk, and from that moment,\r\nwhether their belief was strengthened or not, they no longer dared to\r\nexpress any incredulity. But in spite of that, the judges were put to\r\nshame, for the nuns themselves began to repent; and on the day following\r\nthe impious scene above described, just as Pere Lactanee began to\r\nexorcise Sister Claire in the castle chapel, she rose, and turning\r\ntowards the congregation, while tears ran down her cheeks, said in a\r\nvoice that could be heard by all present, that she was going to speak\r\nthe truth at last in the sight of Heaven. Thereupon she confessed that\r\nall that she had said during the last fortnight against Grandier was\r\ncalumnious and false, and that all her actions had been done at the\r\ninstigation of the Franciscan Pere Lactance, the director, Mignon, and\r\nthe Carmelite brothers. Pere Lactance, not in the least taken aback,\r\ndeclared that her confession was a fresh wile of the devil to save her\r\nmaster Grandier. She then made an urgent appeal to the bishop and to M.\r\nde Laubardemont, asking to be sequestered and placed in charge of other\r\npriests than those who had destroyed her soul, by making her bear false\r\nwitness against an innocent man; but they only laughed at the pranks the\r\ndevil was playing, and ordered her to be at once taken back to the house\r\nin which she was then living. When she heard this order, she darted out\r\nof the choir, trying to escape through the church door, imploring those\r\npresent to come to her assistance and save her from everlasting\r\ndamnation. But such terrible fruit had the proclamation borne that no-one\r\ndared respond, so she was recaptured and taken back to the house in\r\nwhich she was sequestered, never to leave it again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day a still more extraordinary scene took place. While M. de\r\nLaubardemont was questioning one of the nuns, the superior came down\r\ninto the court, barefooted; in her chemise, and a cord round her neck;\r\nand there she remained for two hours, in the midst of a fearful storm,\r\nnot shrinking before lightning, thunder, or rain, but waiting till M. de\r\nLaubardemont and the other exorcists should come out. At length the door\r\nopened and the royal commissioner appeared, whereupon Sister Jeanne des\r\nAnges, throwing herself at his feet, declared she had not sufficient\r\nstrength to play the horrible part they had made her learn any longer,\r\nand that before God and man she declared Urbain Grandier innocent,\r\nsaying that all the hatred which she and her companions had felt against\r\nhim arose from the baffled desires which his comeliness awoke—desires\r\nwhich the seclusion of conventional life made still more ardent. M. de\r\nLaubardemont threatened her with the full weight of his displeasure, but\r\nshe answered, weeping bitterly, that all she now dreaded was her sin,\r\nfor though the mercy of the Saviour was great, she felt that the crime\r\nshe had committed could never be pardoned. M. de Laubardemont exclaimed\r\nthat it was the demon who dwelt in her who was speaking, but she replied\r\nthat the only demon by whom she had even been possessed was the spirit\r\nof vengeance, and that it was indulgence in her own evil thoughts, and\r\nnot a pact with the devil, which had admitted him into her heart.\r\n\r\nWith these words she withdrew slowly, still weeping, and going into the\r\ngarden, attached one end of the cord round her neck to the branch of a\r\ntree, and hanged herself. But some of the sisters who had followed her\r\ncut her down before life was extinct.\r\n\r\nThe same day an order for her strict seclusion was issued for her as for\r\nSister Claire, and the circumstances that she was a relation of M. de\r\nLaubardemont did not avail to lessen her punishment in view of the\r\ngravity of her fault.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to continue the exorcisms other nuns might be tempted\r\nto follow the example, of the superior and Sister Claire, and in that\r\ncase all would be lost. And besides, was not Urbain Grandier well and\r\nduly convicted? It was announced, therefore, that the examination had\r\nproceeded far enough, and that the judges would consider the evidence\r\nand deliver judgment.\r\n\r\nThis long succession of violent and irregular breaches of law procedure,\r\nthe repeated denials of his claim to justice, the refusal to let his\r\nwitnesses appear, or to listen to his defence, all combined to convince\r\nGrandier that his ruin was determined on; for the case had gone so far\r\nand had attained such publicity that it was necessary either to punish\r\nhim as a sorcerer and magician or to render a royal commissioner, a\r\nbishop, an entire community of nuns, several monks of various orders,\r\nmany judges of high reputation, and laymen of birth and standing, liable\r\nto the penalties incurred by calumniators. But although, as this\r\nconviction grew, he confronted it with resignation, his courage did not\r\nfail,—and holding it to be his duty as a man and a Christian to defend\r\nhis life and honour to the end, he drew up and published another\r\nmemorandum, headed Reasons for Acquittal, and had copies laid before his\r\njudges. It was a weighty and, impartial summing up of the whole case,\r\nsuch as a stranger might have written, and began, with these words.\r\n\r\n\"I entreat you in all humility to consider deliberately and with\r\nattention what the Psalmist says in Psalm 82, where he exhorts judges to\r\nfulfil their charge with absolute rectitude; they being themselves mere\r\nmortals who will one day have to appear before God, the sovereign judge\r\nof the universe, to give an account of their administration. The Lord’s\r\nAnointed speaks to you to-day who are sitting in judgment, and says—\r\n\r\n\"’God standeth in the congregation of the mighty: He judgeth among the\r\ngods.\r\n\r\n\"’How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked?\r\n\r\n\"’Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.\r\n\r\n\"’Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.\r\n\r\n\"’I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the Most\r\nHigh.\r\n\r\n\"’But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.’\"\r\n\r\nBut this appeal, although convincing and dignified, had no influence\r\nupon the commission; and on the 18th of August the following verdict and\r\nsentence was pronounced:—\r\n\r\n\"We have declared, and do hereby declare, Urbain Grandier duly accused\r\nand convicted of the crimes of magic and witchcraft, and of causing the\r\npersons of certain Ursuline nuns of this town and of other females to\r\nbecome possessed of evil spirits, wherefrom other crimes and offences\r\nhave resulted. By way of reparation therefor, we have sentenced, and do\r\nhereby sentence, the said Grandier to make public apology, bareheaded,\r\nwith a cord around his neck, holding a lighted torch of two pounds\r\nweight in his hand, before the west door of the church of Saint-Pierre\r\nin the Market Place and before—that of Sainte-Ursule, both of this town,\r\nand there on bended knee to ask pardon of God and the king and the law,\r\nand this done, to be taken to the public square of Sainte-Croix and\r\nthere to be attached to a stake, set in the midst of a pile of wood,\r\nboth of which to be prepared there for this purpose, and to be burnt\r\nalive, along with the pacts and spells which remain in the hands of the\r\nclerk and the manuscript of the book written by the said Grandier\r\nagainst a celibate priesthood, and his ashes, to be scattered to the\r\nfour winds of heaven. And we have declared, and do hereby declare, all\r\nand every part of his property confiscate to the king, the sum of one\r\nhundred and fifty livres being first taken therefrom to be employed in\r\nthe purchase of a copper plate whereon the substance of the present\r\ndecree shall be engraved, the same to be exposed in a conspicuous place\r\nin the said church of Sainte-Ursule, there to remain in perpetuity; and\r\nbefore this sentence is carried out, we order the said Grandier to be\r\nput to the question ordinary and extraordinary, so that his accomplices\r\nmay become known.\r\n\r\n\"Pronounced at Loudun against the said Grandier this 18th day of August\r\n1634.\"\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the day on which this sentence was passed, M. de\r\nLaubardemont ordered the surgeon Francois Fourneau to be arrested at his\r\nown house and taken to Grandier’s cell, although he was ready to go\r\nthere of his own free will. In passing through the adjoining room he\r\nheard the voice of the accused saying:—\r\n\r\n\"What do you want with me, wretched executioner? Have you come to kill\r\nme? You know how cruelly you have already tortured my body. Well I am\r\nready to die.\"\r\n\r\nOn entering the room, Fourneau saw that these words had been addressed\r\nto the surgeon Mannouri.\r\n\r\nOne of the officers of the ’grand privot de l’hotel’, to whom M. de\r\nLaubardemont lent for the occasion the title of officer of the king’s\r\nguard, ordered the new arrival to shave Grandier, and not leave a single\r\nhair on his whole body. This was a formality employed in cases of\r\nwitchcraft, so that the devil should have no place to hide in; for it\r\nwas the common belief that if a single hair were left, the devil could\r\nrender the accused insensible to the pains of torture. From this Urbain\r\nunderstood that the verdict had gone against him and that he was\r\ncondemned to death.\r\n\r\nFourneau having saluted Grandier, proceeded to carry out his orders,\r\nwhereupon a judge said it was not sufficient to shave the body of the\r\nprisoner, but that his nails must also be torn out, lest the devil\r\nshould hide beneath them. Grandier looked at the speaker with an\r\nexpression of unutterable pity, and held out his hands to Fourneau; but\r\nForneau put them gently aside, and said he would do nothing of the kind,\r\neven were the order given by the cardinal-duke himself, and at the same\r\ntime begged Grandier’s pardon for shaving him. At, these words Grandier,\r\nwho had for so long met with nothing but barbarous treatment from those\r\nwith whom he came in contact, turned towards the surgeon with tears in\r\nhis eyes, saying—\r\n\r\n\"So you are the only one who has any pity for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, sir,\" replied Fourneau, \"you don’t see everybody.\"\r\n\r\nGrandier was then shaved, but only two marks found on him, one as we\r\nhave said on the shoulder blade, and the other on the thigh. Both marks\r\nwere very sensitive, the wounds which Mannouri had made not having yet\r\nhealed. This point having been certified by Fourneau, Grandier was\r\nhanded, not his own clothes, but some wretched garments which had\r\nprobably belonged to some other condemned man.\r\n\r\nThen, although his sentence had been pronounced at the Carmelite\r\nconvent, he was taken by the grand provost’s officer, with two of his\r\narchers, accompanied by the provosts of Loudun and Chinon, to the town\r\nhall, where several ladies of quality, among them Madame de\r\nLaubardemont, led by curiosity, were sitting beside the judges, waiting\r\nto hear the sentence read. M. de Laubardemont was in the seat usually\r\noccupied by the clerk, and the clerk was standing before him. All the\r\napproaches were lined with soldiers.\r\n\r\nBefore the accused was brought in, Pere Lactance and another Franciscan\r\nwho had come with him exorcised him to oblige the devils to leave him;\r\nthen entering the judgment hall, they exorcised the earth, the air, \"and\r\nthe other elements.\" Not till that was done was Grandier led in.\r\n\r\nAt first he was kept at the far end of the hall, to allow time for the\r\nexorcisms to have their full effect, then he was brought forward to the\r\nbar and ordered to kneel down. Grandier obeyed, but could remove neither\r\nhis hat nor his skull-cap, as his hands were bound behind his back,\r\nwhereupon the clerk seized on the one and the provost’s officer on the\r\nother, and flung them at de Laubardemont’s feet. Seeing that the accused\r\nfixed his eyes on the commissioner as if waiting to see what he was\r\nabout to do, the clerk said:\r\n\r\n\"Turn your head, unhappy man, and adore the crucifix above the bench.\"\r\n\r\nGrandier obeyed without a murmur and with great humility, and remained\r\nsunk in silent prayer for about ten minutes; he then resumed his former\r\nattitude.\r\n\r\nThe clerk then began to read the sentence in a trembling voice, while\r\nGrandier listened with unshaken firmness and wonderful tranquillity,\r\nalthough it was the most terrible sentence that could be passed,\r\ncondemning the accused to be burnt alive the same day, after the\r\ninfliction of ordinary and extraordinary torture. When the clerk had\r\nended, Grandier said, with a voice unmoved from its usual calm—\r\n\r\n\"Messeigneurs, I aver in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy\r\nGhost, and the Blessed Virgin, my only hope, that I have never been a\r\nmagician, that I have never committed sacrilege, that I know no other\r\nmagic than that of the Holy Scriptures, which I have always preached,\r\nand that I have never held any other belief than that of our Holy Mother\r\nthe Catholic Apostolic Church of Rome; I renounce the devil and all his\r\nworks; I confess my Redeemer, and I pray to be saved through the blood\r\nof the Cross; and I beseech you, messeigneurs, to mitigate the rigour of\r\nmy sentence, and not to drive my soul to despair.\"\r\n\r\nThe concluding words led de Laubardemont to believe that he could obtain\r\nsome admission from Grandier through fear of suffering, so he ordered\r\nthe court to be cleared, and, being left alone with Maitre Houmain,\r\ncriminal lieutenant of Orleans, and the Franciscans, he addressed\r\nGrandier in a stern voice, saying there was only one way to obtain any\r\nmitigation of his sentence, and that was to confess the names of his\r\naccomplices and to sign the confession. Grandier replied that having\r\ncommitted no crime he could have no accomplices, whereupon Laubardemont\r\nordered the prisoner to be taken to the torture chamber, which adjoined\r\nthe judgment hall—an order which was instantly obeyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mode of torture employed at Loudun was a variety of the boot, and\r\none of the most painful of all. Each of the victim’s legs below the knee\r\nwas placed between two boards, the two pairs were then laid one above\r\nthe other and bound together firmly at the ends; wedges were then driven\r\nin with a mallet between the two middle boards; four such wedges\r\nconstituted ordinary and eight extraordinary torture; and this latter\r\nwas seldom inflicted, except on those condemned to death, as almost no\r\none ever survived it, the sufferer’s legs being crushed to a pulp before\r\nhe left the torturer’s bands. In this case M. de Laubardemont on his own\r\ninitiative, for it had never been done before, added two wedges to those\r\nof the extraordinary torture, so that instead of eight, ten were to be\r\ndriven in.\r\n\r\nNor was this all: the commissioner royal and the two Franciscans\r\nundertook to inflict the torture themselves.\r\n\r\nLaubardemont ordered Grandier to be bound in the usual manner, and\r\nthen saw his legs placed between the boards. He then dismissed the\r\nexecutioner and his assistants, and directed the keeper of the\r\ninstruments to bring the wedges, which he complained of as being too\r\nsmall. Unluckily, there were no larger ones in stock, and in spite of\r\nthreats the keeper persisted in saying he did not know where to procure\r\nothers. M. de Laubardemont then asked how long it would take to make\r\nsome, and was told two hours; finding that too long to wait, he was\r\nobliged to put up with those he had.\r\n\r\nThereupon the torture began. Pere Lactance having exorcised the\r\ninstruments, drove in the first wedge, but could not draw a murmur from\r\nGrandier, who was reciting a prayer in a low voice; a second was driven\r\nhome, and this time the victim, despite his resolution, could not avoid\r\ninterrupting his devotions by two groans, at each of which Pere Lactance\r\nstruck harder, crying, \"Dicas! dicas!\" (Confess, confess!), a word which\r\nhe repeated so often and so furiously, till all was over, that he was\r\never after popularly called \"Pere Dicas.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the second wedge was in, de Laubardemont showed Grandier his\r\nmanuscript against the celibacy of the priests, and asked if he\r\nacknowledged it to be in his own handwriting. Grandier answered in the\r\naffirmative. Asked what motive he had in writing it, he said it was an\r\nattempt to restore peace of mind to a poor girl whom he had loved, as\r\nwas proved by the two lines written at the end:\r\n\r\n    \"Si ton gentil esprit prend bien cette science,\r\n     Tu mettras en repos ta bonne conscience.\"\r\n\r\n     [If thy sensitive mind imbibe this teaching,\r\n     It will give ease to thy tender conscience]\r\n\r\nUpon this, M. de Laubardemont demanded the girl’s name; but Grandier\r\nassured him it should never pass his lips, none knowing it but himself\r\nand God. Thereupon M. de Laubardemont ordered Pere Lactance to insert\r\nthe third wedge. While it was being driven in by the monk’s lusty arm,\r\neach blow being accompanied by the word \"’Dicas’!\" Grandier exclaimed—\r\n\r\n\"My God! they are killing me, and yet I am neither a sorcerer nor\r\nsacrilegious!\"\r\n\r\nAt the fourth wedge Grandier fainted, muttering—\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Pere Lactance, is this charity?\"\r\n\r\nAlthough his victim was unconscious, Pere Lactance continued to strike;\r\nso that, having lost consciousness through pain, pain soon brought him\r\nback to life.\r\n\r\nDe Laubardemont took advantage of this revival to take his turn at\r\ndemanding a confession of his crimes; but Grandier said—\r\n\r\n\"I have committed no crimes, sir, only errors. Being a man, I have often\r\ngone astray; but I have confessed and done penance, and believe that my\r\nprayers for pardon have been heard; but if not, I trust that God will\r\ngrant me pardon now, for the sake of my sufferings.\"\r\n\r\nAt the fifth wedge Grandier fainted once more, but they restored him to\r\nconsciousness by dashing cold water in his face, whereupon he moaned,\r\nturning to M. de Laubardemont—\r\n\r\n\"In pity, sir, put me to death at once! I am only a man, and I cannot\r\nanswer for myself that if you continue to torture me so I shall not give\r\nway to despair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then sign this, and the torture shall cease,\" answered the commissioner\r\nroyal, offering him a paper.\r\n\r\n\"My father,\" said Urbain, turning towards the Franciscan, \"can you\r\nassure me on your conscience that it is permissible for a man, in order\r\nto escape suffering, to confess a crime he has never committed?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied the monk; \"for if he die with a lie on his lips he dies in\r\nmortal sin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on, then,\" said Grandier; \"for having suffered so much in my body, I\r\ndesire to save my soul.\"\r\n\r\nAs Pere Lactance drove in the sixth wedge Grandier fainted anew.\r\n\r\nWhen he had been revived, Laubardemont called upon him to confess that a\r\ncertain Elisabeth Blanchard had been his mistress, as well as the girl\r\nfor whom he had written the treatise against celibacy; but Grandier\r\nreplied that not only had no improper relations ever existed between\r\nthem, but that the day he had been confronted with her at his trial was\r\nthe first time he had ever seen her.\r\n\r\nAt the seventh wedge Grandier’s legs burst open, and the blood spurted\r\ninto Pere Lactance’s face; but he wiped it away with the sleeve of his\r\ngown.\r\n\r\n\"O Lord my God, have mercy on me! I die!\" cried Grandier, and fainted\r\nfor the fourth time. Pere Lactance seized the opportunity to take a\r\nshort rest, and sat down.\r\n\r\nWhen Grandier had once more come to himself, he began slowly to utter a\r\nprayer, so beautiful and so moving that the provost’s lieutenant wrote\r\nit down; but de Laubardemont noticing this, forbade him ever to show it\r\nto anyone.\r\n\r\nAt the eighth wedge the bones gave way, and the marrow oozed out of the\r\nwounds, and it became useless to drive in any more wedges, the legs\r\nbeing now as flat as the boards that compressed them, and moreover Pere\r\nLactance was quite worn out.\r\n\r\nGrandier was unbound and laid upon the flagged floor, and while his eyes\r\nshone with fever and agony he prayed again a second prayer—a veritable\r\nmartyr’s prayer, overflowing with faith and enthusiasm; but as he ended\r\nhis strength failed, and he again became unconscious. The provost’s\r\nlieutenant forced a little wine between his lips, which brought him to;\r\nthen he made an act of contrition, renounced Satan and all his works\r\nonce again, and commended his soul to God.\r\n\r\nFour men entered, his legs were freed from the boards, and the crushed\r\nparts were found to be a mere inert mass, only attached to the knees by\r\nthe sinews. He was then carried to the council chamber, and laid on a\r\nlittle straw before the fire.\r\n\r\nIn a corner of the fireplace an Augustinian monk was seated. Urbain\r\nasked leave to confess to him, which de Laubardemont refused, holding\r\nout the paper he desired to have signed once more, at which Grandier\r\nsaid—\r\n\r\n\"If I would not sign to spare myself before, am I likely to give way now\r\nthat only death remains?\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" replied Laubardemont; \"but the mode of your death is in our\r\nhands: it rests with us to make it slow or quick, painless or agonising;\r\nso take this paper and sign?\"\r\n\r\nGrandier pushed the paper gently away, shaking his head in sign of\r\nrefusal, whereupon de Laubardemont left the room in a fury, and ordered\r\nPeres Tranquille and Claude to be admitted, they being the confessors he\r\nhad chosen for Urbain. When they came near to fulfil their office,\r\nUrbain recognised in them two of his torturers, so he said that, as it\r\nwas only four days since he had confessed to Pere Grillau, and he did\r\nnot believe he had committed any mortal sin since then, he would not\r\ntrouble them, upon which they cried out at him as a heretic and infidel,\r\nbut without any effect.\r\n\r\nAt four o’clock the executioner’s assistants came to fetch him; he was\r\nplaced lying on a bier and carried out in that position. On the way he\r\nmet the criminal lieutenant of Orleans, who once more exhorted him to\r\nconfess his crimes openly; but Grandier replied—\r\n\r\n\"Alas, sir, I have avowed them all; I have kept nothing back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you desire me to have masses said for you?\" continued the\r\nlieutenant.\r\n\r\n\"I not only desire it, but I beg for it as a great favour,\" said Urbain.\r\n\r\nA lighted torch was then placed in his hand: as the procession started\r\nhe pressed the torch to his lips; he looked on all whom he met with\r\nmodest confidence, and begged those whom he knew to intercede with God\r\nfor him. On the threshold of the door his sentence was read to him, and\r\nhe was then placed in a small cart and driven to the church of St.\r\nPierre in the market-place. There he was awaited by M. de Laubardemont,\r\nwho ordered him to alight. As he could not stand on his mangled limbs,\r\nhe was pushed out, and fell first on his knees and then on his face. In\r\nthis position he remained patiently waiting to be lifted. He was carried\r\nto the top of the steps and laid down, while his sentence was read to\r\nhim once more, and just as it was finished, his confessor, who had not\r\nbeen allowed to see him for four days, forced a way through the crowd\r\nand threw himself into Grandier’s arms. At first tears choked Pere\r\nGrillau’s voice, but at last he said, \"Remember, sir, that our Saviour\r\nJesus Christ ascended to His Father through the agony of the Cross: you\r\nare a wise man, do not give way now and lose everything. I bring you\r\nyour mother’s blessing; she and I never cease to pray that God may have\r\nmercy on you and receive you into Paradise.\"\r\n\r\nThese words seemed to inspire Grandier with new strength; he lifted his\r\nhead, which pain had bowed, and raising his eyes to heaven, murmured a\r\nshort prayer. Then turning towards the worthy, friar, he said—\r\n\r\n\"Be a son to my mother; pray to God for me constantly; ask all our good\r\nfriars to pray for my soul; my one consolation is that I die innocent. I\r\ntrust that God in His mercy may receive me into Paradise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there nothing else I can do for you?\" asked Pere Grillau.\r\n\r\n\"Alas, my father!\" replied Grandier, \"I am condemned to die a most cruel\r\ndeath; ask the executioner if there is no way of shortening what I must\r\nundergo.\"\r\n\r\n\"I go at once,\" said the friar; and giving him absolution in ’articulo\r\nmortis’, he went down the steps, and while Grandier was making his\r\nconfession aloud the good monk drew the executioner aside and asked if\r\nthere were no possibility of alleviating the death-agony by means of a\r\nshirt dipped in brimstone. The executioner answered that as the sentence\r\nexpressly stated that Grandier was to be burnt alive, he could not\r\nemploy an expedient so sure to be discovered as that; but that if the\r\nfriar would give him thirty crowns he would undertake to strangle\r\nGrandier while he was kindling the pile. Pere Grillau gave him the\r\nmoney, and the executioner provided himself with a rope. The Franciscan\r\nthen placed himself where he could speak to his penitent as he passed,\r\nand as he embraced him for the last time, whispered to him what he had\r\narranged with the executioner, whereupon Grandier turned towards the\r\nlatter and said in a tone of deep gratitude—\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, my brother.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment, the archers having driven away Pere Grillau, by order of\r\nM. de Laubardemont, by beating him with their halberts, the procession\r\nresumed its march, to go through the same ceremony at the Ursuline\r\nchurch, and from there to proceed to the square of Sainte-Croix. On the\r\nway Urbain met and recognised Moussant, who was accompanied by his wife,\r\nand turning towards him, said—\r\n\r\n\"I die your debtor, and if I have ever said a word that could offend you\r\nI ask you to forgive me.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the place of execution was reached, the provost’s lieutenant\r\napproached Grandier and asked his forgiveness.\r\n\r\n\"You have not offended me,\" was the reply; \"you have only done what your\r\nduty obliged you to do.\"\r\n\r\nThe executioner then came forward and removed the back board of the\r\ncart, and ordered his assistants to carry Grandier to where the pile was\r\nprepared. As he was unable to stand, he was attached to the stake by an\r\niron hoop passed round his body. At that moment a flock of pigeons\r\nseemed to fall from the sky, and, fearless of the crowd, which was so\r\ngreat that the archers could not succeed even by blows of their weapons\r\nin clearing a way for the magistrates, began to fly around Grandier,\r\nwhile one, as white as the driven snow, alighted on the summit of the\r\nstake, just above his head. Those who believed in possession exclaimed\r\nthat they were only a band of devils come to seek their master, but\r\nthere were many who muttered that devils were not wont to assume such a\r\nform, and who persisted in believing that the doves had come in default\r\nof men to bear witness to Grandier’s innocence.\r\n\r\nIn trying next day to combat this impression, a monk asserted that he\r\nhad seen a huge fly buzzing round Grandier’s head, and as Beelzebub\r\nmeant in Hebrew, as he said, the god of flies, it was quite evident that\r\nit was that demon himself who, taking upon him the form of one of his\r\nsubjects, had come to carry off the magician’s soul.\r\n\r\nWhen everything was prepared, the executioner passed the rope by which\r\nhe meant to strangle him round Grandier’s neck; then the priests\r\nexorcised the earth, air, and wood, and again demanded of their victim\r\nif he would not publicly confess his crimes. Urbain replied that he had\r\nnothing to say, but that he hoped through the martyr’s death he was\r\nabout to die to be that day with Christ in Paradise.\r\n\r\nThe clerk then read his sentence to him for the fourth time, and asked\r\nif he persisted in what he said under torture.\r\n\r\n\"Most certainly I do,\" said Urbain; \"for it was the exact truth.\"\r\n\r\nUpon this, the clerk withdrew, first informing Grandier that if he had\r\nanything to say to the people he was at liberty to speak.\r\n\r\nBut this was just what the exorcists did not want: they knew Grandier’s\r\neloquence and courage, and a firm, unshaken denial at the moment of\r\ndeath would be most prejudicial to their interests. As soon, therefore,\r\nas Grandier opened his lips to speak, they dashed such a quantity of\r\nholy water in his face that it took away his breath. It was but for a\r\nmoment, however, and he recovered himself, and again endeavoured to\r\nspeak, a monk stooped down and stifled the words by kissing him on the\r\nlips. Grandier, guessing his intention, said loud enough for those next\r\nthe pile to hear, \"That was the kiss of Judas!\"\r\n\r\nAt these words the monks become so enraged that one of them struck\r\nGrandier three times in the face with a crucifix, while he appeared to\r\nbe giving it him to kiss; but by the blood that flowed from his nose and\r\nlips at the third blow those standing near perceived the truth: all\r\nGrandier could do was to call out that he asked for a Salve Regina and\r\nan Ave Maria, which many began at once to repeat, whilst he with clasped\r\nhands and eyes raised to heaven commended himself to God and the Virgin.\r\nThe exorcists then made one more effort to get him to confess publicly,\r\nbut he exclaimed—\r\n\r\n\"My fathers, I have said all I had to say; I hope in God and in His\r\nmercy.\"\r\n\r\nAt this refusal the anger of the exorcists surpassed all bounds, and\r\nPere Lactance, taking a twist of straw, dipped it in a bucket of pitch\r\nwhich was standing beside the pile, and lighting it at a torch, thrust\r\nit into his face, crying—\r\n\r\n\"Miserable wretch! will nothing force you to confess your crimes and\r\nrenounce the devil?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not belong to the devil,\" said Grandier, pushing away the straw\r\nwith his hands; \"I have renounced the devil, I now renounce him and all\r\nhis works again, and I pray that God may have mercy on me.\"\r\n\r\nAt this, without waiting for the signal from the provost’s lieutenant,\r\nPere Lactance poured the bucket of pitch on one corner of the pile of\r\nwood and set fire to it, upon which Grandier called the executioner to\r\nhis aid, who, hastening up, tried in vain to strangle him, while the\r\nflames spread apace.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! my brother,\" said the sufferer, \"is this the way you keep your\r\npromise?\"\r\n\r\n\"It’s not my fault,\" answered the executioner; \"the monks have knotted\r\nthe cord, so that the noose cannot slip.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Father Lactance! Father Lactance! have you no charity?\" cried\r\nGrandier.\r\n\r\nThe executioner by this time was forced by the increasing heat to jump\r\ndown from the pile, being indeed almost overcome; and seeing this,\r\nGrandier stretched forth a hand into the flames, and said—\r\n\r\n\"Pere Lactance, God in heaven will judge between thee and me; I summon\r\nthee to appear before Him in thirty days.\"\r\n\r\nGrandier was then seen to make attempts to strangle himself, but either\r\nbecause it was impossible, or because he felt it would be wrong to end\r\nhis life by his own hands, he desisted, and clasping his hands, prayed\r\naloud—\r\n\r\n\"Deus meus, ad te vigilo, miserere me.\"\r\n\r\nA Capuchin fearing that he would have time to say more, approached the\r\npile from the side which had not yet caught fire, and dashed the\r\nremainder of the holy water in his face. This caused such smoke that\r\nGrandier was hidden for a moment from the eyes of the spectators; when\r\nit cleared away, it was seen that his clothes were now alight; his voice\r\ncould still be heard from the midst of the flames raised in prayer; then\r\nthree times, each time in a weaker voice, he pronounced the name of\r\nJesus, and giving one cry, his head fell forward on his breast.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the pigeons which had till then never ceased to circle\r\nround the stake, flew away, and were lost in the clouds.\r\n\r\nUrbain Grandier had given up the ghost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nThis time it was not the man who was executed who was guilty, but the\r\nexecutioners; consequently we feel sure that our readers will be anxious\r\nto learn something of their fate.\r\n\r\nPere Lactance died in the most terrible agony on September 18th, 1634,\r\nexactly a month from the date of Grandier’s death. His brother-monks\r\nconsidered that this was due to the vengeance of Satan; but others were\r\nnot wanting who said, remembering the summons uttered by Grandier, that\r\nit was rather due to the justice of God. Several attendant circumstances\r\nseemed to favour the latter opinion. The author of the History of the\r\nDevils of Loudzin gives an account of one of these circumstances, for\r\nthe authenticity of which he vouches, and from which we extract the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n\"Some days after the execution of Grandier, Pere Lactance fell ill of\r\nthe disease of which he died. Feeling that it was of supernatural\r\norigin, he determined to take a pilgrimage to Notre Dame des Andilliers\r\nde Saumur, where many miracles were wrought, and which was held in high\r\nestimation in the neighbourhood. A place in the carriage of the Sieur de\r\nCanaye was offered him for the journey; for this gentleman, accompanied\r\nby a large party on pleasure bent, was just then setting out for his\r\nestate of Grand Fonds, which lay in the same direction. The reason for\r\nthe offer was that Canaye and his friends, having heard that the last\r\nwords of Grandier had affected Pere Lactance’s mind, expected to find a\r\ngreat deal of amusement in exciting the terrors of their\r\ntravelling-companion. And in truth, for a day or two, the boon\r\ncompanions sharpened their wits at the expense of the worthy monk, when\r\nall at once, on a good road and without apparent cause, the carriage\r\noverturned. Though no one was hurt, the accident appeared so strange to\r\nthe pleasure-seekers that it put an end to the jokes of even the boldest\r\namong them. Pere Lactance himself appeared melancholy and preoccupied,\r\nand that evening at supper refused to eat, repeating over and over\r\nagain—\r\n\r\n\"’It was wrong of me to deny Grandier the confessor he asked for; God is\r\npunishing me, God is punishing me!’\r\n\r\n\"On the following morning the journey was resumed, but the evident\r\ndistress of mind under which Pere Lactance laboured had so damped the\r\nspirits of the party that all their gaiety had disappeared. Suddenly,\r\njust outside Fenet, where the road was in excellent condition and no\r\nobstacle to their progress apparent, the carriage upset for the second\r\ntime. Although again no one was hurt, the travellers felt that there was\r\namong them someone against whom God’s anger was turned, and their\r\nsuspicions pointing to Pere Lactance, they went on their way, leaving\r\nhim behind, and feeling very uncomfortable at the thought that they had\r\nspent two or three days in his society.\r\n\r\n\"Pere Lactance at last reached Notre-Dame des Andilliers; but however\r\nnumerous were the miracles there performed, the remission of the doom\r\npronounced by the martyr on Pere Lactance was not added to their number;\r\nand at a quarter-past six on September 18th, exactly a month to the very\r\nminute after Grandier’s death, Pere Lactance expired in excruciating\r\nagony.\"\r\n\r\nPere Tranquille’s turn came four years later. The malady which attacked\r\nhim was so extraordinary that the physicians were quite at a loss, and\r\nforced to declare their ignorance of any remedy. His shrieks and\r\nblasphemies were so distinctly heard in the streets, that his brother\r\nFranciscans, fearing the effect they would have on his after-reputation,\r\nespecially in the minds of those who had seen Grandier die with words of\r\nprayer on his lips, spread abroad the report that the devils whom he had\r\nexpelled from the bodies of the nuns had entered into the body of the\r\nexorcist. He died shrieking—\r\n\r\n\"My God! how I suffer! Not all the devils and all the damned together\r\nendure what I endure!\" His panegyrist, in whose book we find all the\r\nhorrible details of his death employed to much purpose to illustrate the\r\nadvantages of belonging to the true faith, remarks—\r\n\r\n\"Truly big generous heart must have been a hot hell for those fiends who\r\nentered his body to torment it.\"\r\n\r\nThe following epitaph which was placed over his grave was interpreted,\r\naccording to the prepossessions of those who read it, either as a\r\ntestimony to his sanctity or as a proof of his punishment:—\r\n\r\n\"Here lies Pere Tranquille, of Saint-Remi; a humble Capuchin preacher.\r\nThe demons no longer able to endure his fearlessly exercised power as an\r\nexorcist, and encouraged by sorcerers, tortured him to death, on May\r\n31st, 1638.\"\r\n\r\nBut a death about which there could be no doubt as to the cause was that\r\nof the surgeon Mannouri, the same who had, as the reader may recollect,\r\nbeen the first to torture Grandier. One evening about ten o’clock he was\r\nreturning from a visit to a patient who lived on the outskirts of the\r\ntown, accompanied by a colleague and preceded by his surgery attendant\r\ncarrying a lantern. When they reached the centre of the town in the rue\r\nGrand-Pave, which passes between the walls of the castle grounds and the\r\ngardens of the Franciscan monastery, Mannouri suddenly stopped, and,\r\nstaring fixedly at some object which was invisible to his companions,\r\nexclaimed with a start—\r\n\r\n\"Oh! there is Grandier!\r\n\r\n\"Where? where?\" cried the others.\r\n\r\nHe pointed in the direction towards which his eyes were turned, and\r\nbeginning to tremble violently, asked—\r\n\r\n\"What do you want with me, Grandier? What do you want?\"\r\n\r\nA moment later he added\r\n\r\n\"Yes-yes, I am coming.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately it seemed as if the vision vanished from before his eyes,\r\nbut the effect remained. His brother-surgeon and the servant brought him\r\nhome, but neither candles nor the light of day could allay his fears;\r\nhis disordered brain showed him Grandier ever standing at the foot of\r\nhis bed. A whole week he continued, as was known all over the town, in\r\nthis condition of abject terror; then the spectre seemed to move from\r\nits place and gradually to draw nearer, for he kept on repeating, \"He is\r\ncoming! he is coming!\" and at length, towards evening, at about the same\r\nhour at which Grandier expired, Surgeon Mannouri drew his last breath.\r\n\r\nWe have still to tell of M. de Laubardemont. All we know is thus related\r\nin the letters of M. de Patin:—\r\n\r\n\"On the 9th inst., at nine o’clock in the evening, a carriage was\r\nattacked by robbers; on hearing the noise the townspeople ran to the\r\nspot, drawn thither as much by curiosity as by humanity. A few shots\r\nwere exchanged and the robbers put to flight, with the exception of one\r\nman belonging to their band who was taken prisoner, and another who lay\r\nwounded on the paving-stones. This latter died next day without having\r\nspoken, and left no clue behind as to who he was. His identity was,\r\nhowever, at length made clear. He was the son of a high dignitary named\r\nde Laubardemont, who in 1634, as royal commissioner, condemned Urbain\r\nGrandier, a poor, priest of Loudun, to be burnt alive, under the\r\npretence that he had caused several nuns of Loudun to be possessed by\r\ndevils. These nuns he had so tutored as to their behaviour that many\r\npeople foolishly believed them to be demoniacs. May we not regard the\r\nfate of his son as a chastisement inflicted by Heaven on this unjust\r\njudge—an expiation exacted for the pitilessly cruel death inflicted on\r\nhis victim, whose blood still cries unto the Lord from the ground?\"\r\n\r\nNaturally the persecution of Urbain Grandier attracted the attention not\r\nonly of journalists but of poets. Among the many poems which were\r\ninspired by it, the following is one of the best. Urbain speaks:\r\n\r\n    \"From hell came the tidings that by horrible sanctions\r\n     I had made a pact with the devil to have power over women:\r\n     Though not one could be found to accuse me.\r\n     In the trial which delivered me to torture and the stake,\r\n     The demon who accused me invented and suggested the crime,\r\n     And his testimony was the only proof against me.\r\n\r\n     The English in their rage burnt the Maid alive;\r\n     Like her, I too fell a victim to revenge;\r\n     We were both accused falsely of the same crime;\r\n     In Paris she is adored, in London abhorred;\r\n     In Loudun some hold me guilty of witchcraft,\r\n     Some believe me innocent; some halt between two minds.\r\n\r\n     Like Hercules, I loved passionately;\r\n     Like him, I was consumed by fire;\r\n     But he by death became a god.\r\n     The injustice of my death was so well concealed\r\n     That no one can judge whether the flames saved or destroyed me;\r\n     Whether they blackened me for hell, or purified me for heaven.\r\n\r\n     In vain did I suffer torments with unshaken resolution;\r\n     They said that I felt no pain, being a sorcerer died unrepentant;\r\n     That the prayers I uttered were impious words;\r\n     That in kissing the image on the cross I spat in its face;\r\n     That casting my eyes to heaven I mocked the saints;\r\n     That when I seemed to call on God, I invoked the devil\r\n\r\n     Others, more charitable, say, in spite of their hatred of my crime,\r\n     That my death may be admired although my life was not blameless;\r\n     That my resignation showed that I died in hope and faith;\r\n     That to forgive, to suffer without complaint or murmur,\r\n     Is perfect love; and that the soul is purified\r\n     From the sins of life by a death like mine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*NISIDA—1825*\r\n\r\n\r\nIf our readers, tempted by the Italian proverb about seeing Naples and\r\nthen dying, were to ask us what is the most favourable moment for\r\nvisiting the enchanted city, we should advise them to land at the mole,\r\nor at Mergellina, on a fine summer day and at the hour when some solemn\r\nprocession is moving out of the cathedral. Nothing can give an idea of\r\nthe profound and simple-hearted emotion of this populace, which has\r\nenough poetry in its soul to believe in its own happiness. The whole\r\ntown adorns herself and attires herself like a bride for her wedding;\r\nthe dark facades of marble and granite disappear beneath hangings of\r\nsilk and festoons of flowers; the wealthy display their dazzling luxury,\r\nthe poor drape themselves proudly in their rags. Everything is light,\r\nharmony, and perfume; the sound is like the hum of an immense hive,\r\ninterrupted by a thousandfold outcry of joy impossible to describe. The\r\nbells repeat their sonorous sequences in every key; the arcades echo\r\nafar with the triumphal marches of military bands; the sellers of\r\nsherbet and water-melons sing out their deafening flourish from throats\r\nof copper. People form into groups; they meet, question, gesticulate;\r\nthere are gleaming looks, eloquent gestures, picturesque attitudes;\r\nthere is a general animation, an unknown charm, an indefinable\r\nintoxication. Earth is very near to heaven, and it is easy to understand\r\nthat, if God were to banish death from this delightful spot, the\r\nNeapolitans would desire no other paradise.\r\n\r\nThe story that we are about to tell opens with one of these magical\r\npictures. It was the Day of the Assumption in the year 1825; the sun had\r\nbeen up some four or five hours, and the long Via da Forcella, lighted\r\nfrom end to end by its slanting rays, cut the town in two, like a ribbon\r\nof watered silk. The lava pavement, carefully cleaned, shone like any\r\nmosaic, and the royal troops, with their proudly waving plumes, made a\r\ndouble living hedge on each side of the street. The balconies, windows,\r\nand terraces, the stands with their unsubstantial balustrades, and the\r\nwooden galleries set up during the night, were loaded with spectators,\r\nand looked not unlike the boxes of a theatre. An immense crowd, forming\r\na medley of the brightest colours, invaded the reserved space and broke\r\nthrough the military barriers, here and there, like an overflowing\r\ntorrent. These intrepid sightseers, nailed to their places, would have\r\nwaited half their lives without giving the least sign of impatience.\r\n\r\nAt last, about noon, a cannon-shot was heard, and a cry of general\r\nsatisfaction followed it. It was the signal that the procession had\r\ncrossed the threshold of the church. In the same moment a charge of\r\ncarabineers swept off the people who were obstructing the middle of the\r\nstreet, the regiments of the line opened floodgates for the overflowing\r\ncrowd, and soon nothing remained on the causeway but some scared dog,\r\nshouted at by the people, hunted off by the soldiers, and fleeing at\r\nfull speed. The procession came out through the Via di Vescovato. First\r\ncame the guilds of merchants and craftsmen, the hatters, weavers,\r\nbakers, butchers, cutlers, and goldsmiths. They wore the prescribed\r\ndress: black coats, knee breeches, low shoes and silver buckles. As the\r\ncountenances of these gentlemen offered nothing very interesting to the\r\nmultitude, whisperings arose, little by little, among the spectators,\r\nthen some bold spirits ventured a jest or two upon the fattest or the\r\nbaldest of the townsmen, and at last the boldest of the lazzaroni\r\nslipped between the soldiers’ legs to collect the wax that was running\r\ndown from the lighted tapers.\r\n\r\nAfter the craftsmen, the religious orders marched past, from the\r\nDominicans to the Carthusians, from the Carmelites to the Capuchins.\r\nThey advanced slowly, their eyes cast down, their step austere, their\r\nhands on their hearts; some faces were rubicund and shining, with large\r\ncheek-hones and rounded chins, herculean heads upon bullnecks; some,\r\nthin and livid, with cheeks hollowed by suffering and penitence, and\r\nwith the look of living ghosts; in short, here were the two sides of\r\nmonastic life.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Nunziata and Gelsomina, two charming damsels, taking\r\nadvantage of an old corporal’s politeness, pushed forward their pretty\r\nheads into the first rank. The break in the line was conspicuous; but\r\nthe sly warrior seemed just a little lax in the matter of discipline.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there is Father Bruno!\" said Gelsomina suddenly. \"Good-day, Father\r\nBruno.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, cousin! People do not talk to the procession.\"\r\n\r\n\"How absurd! He is my confessor. May I not say good-morning to my\r\nconfessor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Silence, chatterboxes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was that spoke?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my dear, it was Brother Cucuzza, the begging friar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is he? Where is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"There he is, along there, laughing into his beard. How bold he is!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, God in heaven! If we were to dream of him—-\"\r\n\r\nWhile the two cousins were pouring out endless comments upon the\r\nCapuchins and their beards, the capes of the canons and the surplices of\r\nthe seminarists, the ’feroci’ came running across from the other side to\r\nre-establish order with the help of their gun-stocks.\r\n\r\n\"By the blood of my patron saint,\" cried a stentorian voice, \"if I catch\r\nyou between my finger and thumb, I will straighten your back for the\r\nrest of your days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are you falling out with, Gennaro?\"\r\n\r\n\"With this accursed hunchback, who has been worrying my back for the\r\nlast hour, as though he could see through it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a shame,\" returned the hunchback in a tone of lamentation; \"I\r\nhave been here since last night, I slept out of doors to keep my place,\r\nand here is this abominable giant comes to stick himself in front of me\r\nlike an obelisk.\"\r\n\r\nThe hunchback was lying like a Jew, but the crowd rose unanimously\r\nagainst the obelisk. He was, in one way, their superior, and majorities\r\nare always made up of pigmies.\r\n\r\n\"Hi! Come down from your stand!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hi! get off your pedestal!\"\r\n\r\n\"Off with your hat!\"\r\n\r\n\"Down with your head!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sit down!\"\r\n\r\n\"Lie down!\"\r\n\r\nThis revival of curiosity expressing itself in invectives evidently\r\nbetokened the crisis of the show. And indeed the chapters of canons, the\r\nclergy and bishops, the pages and chamberlains, the representatives of\r\nthe city, and the gentlemen of the king’s chamber now appeared, and\r\nfinally the king himself, who, bare-headed and carrying a taper,\r\nfollowed the magnificent statue of the Virgin. The contrast was\r\nstriking: after the grey-headed monks and pale novices came brilliant\r\nyoung captains, affronting heaven with the points of their moustaches,\r\nriddling the latticed windows with killing glances, following the\r\nprocession in an absent-minded way, and interrupting the holy hymns with\r\nscraps of most unorthodox conversation.\r\n\r\n\"Did you notice, my dear Doria, how like a monkey the old Marchesa\r\nd’Acquasparta takes her raspberry ice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Her nose takes the colour of the ice. What fine bird is showing off to\r\nher?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the Cyrenian.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon! I have not seen that name in the Golden Book.\"\r\n\r\n\"He helps the poor marquis to bear his cross.\"\r\n\r\nThe officer’s profane allusion was lost in the prolonged murmur of\r\nadmiration that suddenly rose from the crowd, and every gaze was turned\r\nupon one of the young girls who was strewing flowers before the holy\r\nMadonna. She was an exquisite creature. Her head glowing in the sun\r\nshine, her feet hidden amid roses and broom-blossom, she rose, tall and\r\nfair, from a pale cloud of incense, like some seraphic apparition. Her\r\nhair, of velvet blackness, fell in curls half-way down her shoulders;\r\nher brow, white as alabaster and polished as a mirror, reflected the\r\nrays of the sun; her beautiful and finely arched black eye-brows melted\r\ninto the opal of her temples; her eyelids were fast down, and the curled\r\nblack fringe of lashes veiled a glowing and liquid glance of divine\r\nemotion; the nose, straight, slender, and cut by two easy nostrils, gave\r\nto her profile that character of antique beauty which is vanishing day\r\nby day from the earth. A calm and serene smile, one of those smiles that\r\nhave already left the soul and not yet reached the lips, lifted the\r\ncorners of her mouth with a pure expression of infinite beatitude and\r\ngentleness. Nothing could be more perfect than the chin that completed\r\nthe faultless oval of this radiant countenance; her neck of a dead\r\nwhite, joined her bosom in a delicious curve, and supported her head\r\ngracefully like the stalk of a flower moved by a gentle breeze. A bodice\r\nof crimson velvet spotted with gold outlined her delicate and finely\r\ncurved figure, and held in by means of a handsome gold lace the\r\ncountless folds of a full and flowing skirt, that fell to her feet like\r\nthose severe robes in which the Byzantine painters preferred to drape\r\ntheir angels. She was indeed a marvel, and so rare and modest of beauty\r\nhad not been seen within the memory of man.\r\n\r\nAmong those who had gazed most persistently at her was observed the\r\nyoung Prince of Brancaleone, one of the foremost nobles of the kingdom.\r\nHandsome, rich, and brave, he had, at five-and-twenty, outdone the lists\r\nof all known Don Juans. Fashionable young women spoke very ill of him\r\nand adored him in secret; the most virtuous made it their rule to fly\r\nfrom him, so impossible did resistance appear. All the young madcaps had\r\nchosen him for their model; for his triumphs robbed many a Miltiades of\r\nsleep, and with better cause. In short, to get an idea of this lucky\r\nindividual, it will be enough to know that as a seducer he was the most\r\nperfect thing that the devil had succeeded in inventing in this\r\nprogressive century. The prince was dressed out for the occasion in a\r\nsufficiently grotesque costume, which he wore with ironic gravity and\r\ncavalier ease. A black satin doublet, knee breeches, embroidered\r\nstockings, and shoes with gold buckles, formed the main portions of his\r\ndress, over which trailed a long brocaded open-sleeved robe lined with\r\nermine, and a magnificent diamond-hilted sword. On account of his rank\r\nhe enjoyed the rare distinction of carrying one of the six gilded staves\r\nthat supported the plumed and embroidered canopy.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the procession moved on again, Eligi of Brancaleone gave a\r\nside glance to a little man as red as a lobster, who was walking almost\r\nat his side, and carrying in his right hand, with all the solemnity that\r\nhe could muster, his excellency’s hat. He was a footman in gold-laced\r\nlivery, and we beg leave to give a brief sketch of his history. Trespolo\r\nwas the child of poor but thieving parents, and on that account was\r\nearly left an orphan. Being at leisure, he studied life from an\r\neminently social aspect. If we are to believe a certain ancient sage, we\r\nare all in the world to solve a problem: as to Trespolo, he desired to\r\nlive without doing anything; that was his problem. He was, in turn, a\r\nsacristan, a juggler, an apothecary’s assistant, and a cicerone, and he\r\ngot tired of all these callings. Begging was, to his mind, too hard\r\nwork, and it was more trouble to be a thief than to be an honest man.\r\nFinally he decided in favour of contemplative philosophy. He had a\r\npassionate preference for the horizontal position, and found the\r\ngreatest pleasure in the world in watching the shooting of stars.\r\nUnfortunately, in the course of his meditations this deserving man came\r\nnear to dying of hunger; which would have been a great pity, for he was\r\nbeginning to accustom himself not to eat anything. But as he was\r\npredestined by nature to play a small part in our story, God showed him\r\ngrace for that time, and sent to his assistance—not one of His angels,\r\nthe rogue was not worthy of that, but—one of Brancaleone’s hunting dogs.\r\nThe noble animal sniffed round the philosopher, and uttered a little\r\ncharitable growl that would have done credit to one of the brethren of\r\nMount St. Bernard. The prince, who was returning in triumph from\r\nhunting, and who, by good luck, had that day killed a bear and ruined a\r\ncountess, had an odd inclination to do a good deed. He approached the\r\nplebeian who was about to pass into the condition of a corpse, stirred\r\nthe thing with his foot, and seeing that there was still a little hope,\r\nbade his people bring him along.\r\n\r\nFrom that day onward, Trespolo saw the dream of his life nearly\r\nrealised. Something rather above a footman and rather below a house\r\nsteward, he became the confidant of his master, who found his talents\r\nmost useful; for this Trespolo was as sharp as a demon and almost as\r\nartful as a woman. The prince, who, like an intelligent man as he was,\r\nhad divined that genius is naturally indolent, asked nothing of him but\r\nadvice; when tiresome people wanted thrashing, he saw to that matter\r\nhimself, and, indeed, he was the equal of any two at such work. As\r\nnothing in this lower world, however, is complete, Trespolo had strange\r\nmoments amid this life of delights; from time to time his happiness was\r\ndisturbed by panics that greatly diverted his master; he would mutter\r\nincoherent words, stifle violent sighs, and lose his appetite. The root\r\nof the matter was that the poor fellow was afraid of going to hell. The\r\nmatter was very simple: he was afraid of everything; and, besides, it\r\nhad often been preached to him that the Devil never allowed a moment’s\r\nrest to those who were ill-advised enough to fall into his clutches.\r\nTrespolo was in one of his good moods of repentance, when the prince,\r\nafter gazing on the young girl with the fierce eagerness of a vulture\r\nabout to swoop upon its prey, turned to speak to his intimate adviser.\r\nThe poor servant understood his master’s abominable design, and not\r\nwishing to share the guilt of a sacrilegious conversation, opened his\r\neyes very wide and turned them up to heaven in ecstatic contemplation.\r\nThe prince coughed, stamped his foot, moved his sword so as to hit\r\nTrespolo’s legs, but could not get from him any sign of attention, so\r\nabsorbed did he appear in celestial thoughts. Brancaleone would have\r\nliked to wring his neck, but both his hands were occupied by the staff\r\nof the canopy; and besides, the king was present.\r\n\r\nAt last they were drawing nearer to the church of St. Clara, where the\r\nNeapolitan kings were buried, and where several princesses of the blood,\r\nexchanging the crown for the veil, have gone to bury themselves alive.\r\nThe nuns, novices, and abbess, hidden behind shutters, were throwing\r\nflowers upon the procession. A bunch fell at the feet of the Prince of\r\nBrancaleone.\r\n\r\n\"Trespolo, pick up that nosegay,\" said the prince, so audibly that his\r\nservant had no further excuse. \"It is from Sister Theresa,\" he added, in\r\na low voice; \"constancy is only to be found, nowadays, in a convent.\"\r\n\r\nTrespolo picked up the nosegay and came towards his master, looking like\r\na man who was being strangled.\r\n\r\n\"Who is that girl?\" the latter asked him shortly.\r\n\r\n\"Which one?\" stammered the servant.\r\n\r\n\"Forsooth! The one walking in front of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don’t know her, my lord.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must find out something about her before this evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall have to go rather far afield.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you do know her, you intolerable rascal! I have half a mind to\r\nhave you hanged like a dog.\"\r\n\r\n\"For pity’s sake, my lord, think of the salvation of your soul, of your\r\neternal life.\"\r\n\r\n\"I advise you to think of your temporal life. What is her name?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is called Nisida, and is the prettiest girl in the island that she\r\nis named after. She is innocence itself. Her father is only a poor\r\nfisherman, but I can assure your excellency that in his island he is\r\nrespected like a king.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\" replied the prince, with an ironical smile. \"I must own, to my\r\ngreat shame, that I have never visited the little island of Nisida. You\r\nwill have a boat ready for me to-morrow, and then we will see.\"\r\n\r\nHe interrupted himself suddenly, for the king was looking at him; and\r\ncalling up the most sonorous bass notes that he could find in the depths\r\nof his throat, he continued with an inspired air, \"Genitori genitoque\r\nlaus et jubilatio.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amen,\" replied the serving-man in a ringing voice.\r\n\r\nNisida, the beloved daughter of Solomon, the fisherman, was, as we have\r\nsaid, the loveliest flower of the island from which she derived her\r\nname. That island is the most charming spot, the most delicious nook\r\nwith which we are acquainted; it is a basket of greenery set delicately\r\namid the pure and transparent waters of the gulf, a hill wooded with\r\norange trees and oleanders, and crowned at the summit by a marble\r\ncastle. All around extends the fairy-like prospect of that immense\r\namphitheatre, one of the mightiest wonders of creation. There lies\r\nNaples, the voluptuous syren, reclining carelessly on the seashore;\r\nthere, Portici, Castellamare, and Sorrento, the very names of which\r\nawaken in the imagination a thousand thoughts of poetry and love; there\r\nare Pausilippo, Baiae, Puozzoli, and those vast plains, where the\r\nancients fancied their Elysium, sacred solitudes which one might suppose\r\npeopled by the men of former days, where the earth echoes under foot\r\nlike an empty grave, and the air has unknown sounds and strange\r\nmelodies.\r\n\r\nSolomon’s hut stood in that part of the island which, turning its back\r\nto the capital, beholds afar the blue crests of Capri. Nothing could be\r\nsimpler or brighter. The brick walls were hung with ivy greener than\r\nemeralds, and enamelled with white bell-flowers; on the ground floor was\r\na fairly spacious apartment, in which the men slept and the family took\r\ntheir meals; on the floor above was Nisida’s little maidenly room, full\r\nof coolness, shadows, and mystery, and lighted by a single casement that\r\nlooked over the gulf; above this room was a terrace of the Italian kind,\r\nthe four pillars of which were wreathed with vine branches, while its\r\nvine-clad arbour and wide parapet were overgrown with moss and wild\r\nflowers. A little hedge of hawthorn, which had been respected for ages,\r\nmade a kind of rampart around the fisherman’s premises, and defended his\r\nhouse better than deep moats and castellated walls could have done. The\r\nboldest roisterers of the place would have preferred to fight before the\r\nparsonage and in the precincts of the church rather than in front of\r\nSolomon’s little enclosure. Otherwise, this was the meeting place of the\r\nwhole island. Every evening, precisely at the same hour, the good women\r\nof the neighbourhood came to knit their woollen caps and tell the news.\r\nGroups of little children, naked, brown, and as mischievous as little\r\nimps, sported about, rolling on the grass and throwing handfuls of sand\r\ninto the other’s eyes, heedless of the risk of blinding, while their\r\nmothers were engrossed in that grave gossip which marks the dwellers in\r\nvillages. These gatherings occurred daily before the fisherman’s house;\r\nthey formed a tacit and almost involuntary homage, consecrated by\r\ncustom, and of which no one had ever taken special account; the envy\r\nthat rules in small communities would soon have suppressed them. The\r\ninfluence which old Solomon had over his equals had grown so simply and\r\nnaturally, that no one found any fault with it, and it had only\r\nattracted notice when everyone was benefiting by it, like those fine\r\ntrees whose growth is only observed when we profit by their shade. If\r\nany dispute arose in the island, the two opponents preferred to abide by\r\nthe judgment of the fisherman instead of going before the court; he was\r\nfortunate enough or clever enough to send away both parties satisfied.\r\nHe knew what remedies to prescribe better than any physician, for it\r\nseldom happened that he or his had not felt the same ailments, and his\r\nknowledge, founded on personal experience, produced the most excellent\r\nresults. Moreover, he had no interest, as ordinary doctors have, in\r\nprolonging illnesses. For many years past the only formality recognised\r\nas a guarantee for the inviolability of a contract had been the\r\nintervention of the fisherman. Each party shook hands with Solomon, and\r\nthe thing was done. They would rather have thrown themselves into\r\nVesuvius at the moment of its most violent eruption than have broken so\r\nsolemn an agreement. At the period when our story opens, it was\r\nimpossible to find any person in the island who had not felt the effects\r\nof the fisherman’s generosity, and that without needing to confess to\r\nhim any necessities. As it was the custom for the little populace of\r\nNisida to spend its leisure hours before Solomon’s cottage, the old man,\r\nwhile he walked slowly among the different groups, humming his favourite\r\nsong, discovered moral and physical weaknesses as he passed; and the\r\nsame evening he or his daughter would certainly be seen coming\r\nmysteriously to bestow a benefit upon every sufferer, to lay a balm upon\r\nevery wound. In short, he united in his person all those occupations\r\nwhose business is to help mankind. Lawyers, doctors, and the notary, all\r\nthe vultures of civilisation, had beaten a retreat before the\r\npatriarchal benevolence of the fisherman. Even the priest had\r\ncapitulated.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow of the Feast of the Assumption, Solomon was sitting, as\r\nhis habit was, on a stone bench in front of his house, his legs crossed\r\nand his arms carelessly stretched out. At the first glance you would\r\nhave taken him for sixty at the outside, though he was really over\r\neighty. He had all his teeth, which were as white as pearls, and showed\r\nthem proudly. His brow, calm and restful beneath its crown of abundant\r\nwhite hair, was as firm and polished as marble; not a wrinkle ruffled\r\nthe corner of his eye, and the gem-like lustre of his blue orbs revealed\r\na freshness of soul and an eternal youth such as fable grants to the\r\nsea-gods. He displayed his bare arms and muscular neck with an old man’s\r\nvanity. Never had a gloomy idea, an evil prepossession, or a keen\r\nremorse, arisen to disturb his long and peaceful life. He had never seen\r\na tear flow near him without hurrying to wipe it; poor though he was, he\r\nhad succeeded in pouring out benefits that all the kings of the earth\r\ncould not have bought with their gold; ignorant though he was, he had\r\nspoken to his fellows the only language that they could understand, the\r\nlanguage of the heart. One single drop of bitterness had mingled with\r\nhis inexhaustible stream of happiness; one grief only had clouded his\r\nsunny life—the death of his wife—and moreover he had forgotten that.\r\n\r\nAll the affections of his soul were turned upon Nisida, whose birth had\r\ncaused her mother’s death; he loved her with that immoderate love that\r\nold people have for the youngest of their children. At the present\r\nmoment he was gazing upon her with an air of profound rapture, and\r\nwatching her come and go, as she now joined the groups of children and\r\nscolded them for games too dangerous or too noisy; now seated herself on\r\nthe grass beside their mothers and took part with grave and thoughtful\r\ninterest in their talk. Nisida was more beautiful thus than she had been\r\nthe day before; with the vaporous cloud of perfume that had folded her\r\nround from head to foot had disappeared all that mystic poetry which put\r\na sort of constraint upon her admirers and obliged them to lower their\r\nglances. She had become a daughter of Eve again without losing anything\r\nof her charm. Simply dressed, as she usually was on work-days, she was\r\ndistinguishable among her companions only by her amazing beauty and by\r\nthe dazzling whiteness of her skin. Her beautiful black hair was twisted\r\nin plaits around the little dagger of chased silver, that has lately\r\nbeen imported into Paris by that right of conquest which the pretty\r\nwomen of Paris have over the fashions of all countries, like the English\r\nover the sea.\r\n\r\nNisida was adored by her young friends, all the mothers had adopted her\r\nwith pride; she was the glory of the island. The opinion of her\r\nsuperiority was shared by everyone to such a degree, that if some bold\r\nyoung man, forgetting the distance which divided him from the maiden,\r\ndared speak a little too loudly of his pretensions, he became the\r\nlaughing-stock of his companions. Even the past masters of tarentella\r\ndancing were out of countenance before the daughter of Solomon, and did\r\nnot dare to seek her as a partner. Only a few singers from Amalfi or\r\nSorrento, attracted by the rare beauty of this angelic creature,\r\nventured to sigh out their passion, carefully veiled beneath the most\r\ndelicate allusions. But they seldom reached the last verse of their\r\nsong; at every sound they stopped short, threw down their triangles and\r\ntheir mandolines, and took flight like scared nightingales.\r\n\r\nOne only had courage enough or passion enough to brave the mockery; this\r\nwas Bastiano, the most formidable diver of that coast. He also sang, but\r\nwith a deep and hollow voice; his chant was mournful and his melodies\r\nfull of sadness. He never accompanied himself upon any instrument, and\r\nnever retired without concluding his song. That day he was gloomier than\r\nusual; he was standing upright, as though by enchantment, upon a bare\r\nand slippery rock, and he cast scornful glances upon the women who were\r\nlooking at him and laughing. The sun, which was plunging into the sea\r\nlike a globe of fire, shed its light full upon his stern features, and\r\nthe evening breeze, as it lightly rippled the billows, set the\r\nfluttering reeds waving at his feet. Absorbed by dark thoughts, he sang,\r\nin the musical language of his country, these sad words:—\r\n\r\n\"O window, that wert used to shine in the night like an open eye, how\r\ndark thou art! Alas, alas! my poor sister is ill.\r\n\r\n\"Her mother, all in tears, stoops towards me and says, ’Thy poor sister\r\nis dead and buried.’\r\n\r\n\"Jesus! Jesus! Have pity on me! You stab me to the heart.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, good neighbours, how it happened; repeat to me her last words.\r\n\r\n\"She had a burning thirst, and refused to drink because thou wast not\r\nthere to give her water from thy hand.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my sister! Oh, my sister!\r\n\r\n\"She refused her mother’s kiss, because thou wast not there to embrace\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my sister! Oh, my sister!\r\n\r\n\"She wept until her last breath, because thou wast not there to dry her\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my sister! Oh, my sister!\r\n\r\n\"We placed on her brow her wreath of orangeflowers, we covered her with\r\na veil as white as snow; we laid her gently in her coffin.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, good neighbours. I will go and be with her.\r\n\r\n\"Two angels came down from heaven and bore her away on their wings. Mary\r\nMagdalene came to meet her at the gate of heaven.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, good neighbours. I will go and be with her.\r\n\r\n\"There, she was seated in a place of glory, a chaplet of rubies was\r\ngiven to her, and she is singing her rosary with the Virgin.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, good neighbours. I will go and be with her.\"\r\n\r\nAs he finished the last words of his melancholy refrain, he flung\r\nhimself from the top of his rock into the sea, as though he really\r\ndesired to engulf himself. Nisida and the other women gave a cry of\r\nterror, for during some minutes the diver failed to reappear upon the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n\"Are you out of your senses?\" cried a young man who had suddenly\r\nappeared, unobserved among the women. \"Why, what are you afraid of? You\r\nknow very well that Bastiano is always doing things of this sort. But do\r\nnot be alarmed: all the fishes in the Mediterranean will be drowned\r\nbefore any harm comes to him. Water is his natural element. Good-day,\r\nsister; good-day, father.\"\r\n\r\nThe young fisherman kissed Nisida on the forehead, drew near to his\r\nfather, and, bowing his handsome head before him, took off his red cap\r\nand respectfully kissed the old man’s hand. He came thus to ask his\r\nblessing every evening before putting out to sea, where he often spent\r\nthe night fishing from his boat.\r\n\r\n\"May God bless thee, my Gabriel!\" said the old man in a tone of emotion,\r\nas he slowly passed his hand over his son’s black curls, and a tear came\r\ninto his eye. Then, rising solemnly and addressing the groups around\r\nhim, he added in a voice full of dignity and of gentleness. \"Come, my\r\nchildren, it is time to separate. The young to work, the old to rest.\r\nThere is the angelus ringing.\"\r\n\r\nEverybody knelt, and after a short prayer each went on his way. Nisida,\r\nafter having given her father the last daily attentions, went up to her\r\nroom, replenished the oil in the lamp that burned day and night before\r\nthe Virgin, and, leaning her elbow on the window ledge, divided the\r\nbranches of jasmine which hung like perfumed curtains, began to gaze out\r\nat the sea, and seemed lost in a deep, sweet reverie.\r\n\r\nAt this very time, a little boat, rowed silently by two oarsmen, touched\r\nshore on the other side of the island. It had become quite dark. A\r\nlittle man first landed cautiously, and respectfully offered his hand to\r\nanother individual, who, scorning that feeble support, leapt easily\r\nashore.\r\n\r\n\"Well, knave,\" he cried, \"are my looks to your taste?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your lordship is perfect.\"\r\n\r\n\"I flatter myself I am. It is true that, in order to make the\r\ntransformation complete, I chose the very oldest coat that displayed its\r\nrags in a Jew’s shop.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your lordship looks like a heathen god engaged in a love affair.\r\nJupiter has sheathed his thunderbolts and Apollo has pocketed his rays.\"\r\n\r\n\"A truce to your mythology. And, to begin with, I forbid you to call me\r\n’your lordship.’\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your lordship.\"\r\n\r\n\"If my information that I have procured during the day is correct, the\r\nhouse must be on the other side of the island, in a most remote and\r\nlonely spot. Walk at a certain distance, and do not trouble yourself\r\nabout me, for I know my part by heart.\"\r\n\r\nThe young Prince of Brancaleone, whom, in spite of the darkness of the\r\nnight, our readers will already have recognised, advanced towards the\r\nfisherman’s house, with as little noise as possible, walked up and down\r\nseveral times upon the shore, and, after having briefly reconnoitred the\r\nplace that he wished to attack, waited quietly for the moon to rise and\r\nlight up the scene that he had prepared. He was not obliged to exercise\r\nhis patience very long, for the darkness gradually disappeared, and\r\nSolomon’s little house was bathed in silvery light. Then he approached\r\nwith timid steps, lifted towards the casement a look of entreaty, and\r\nbegan to sigh with all the power of his lungs. The young girl, called\r\nsuddenly from her meditations by the appearance of this strange person,\r\nraised herself sharply and prepared to close the shutters.\r\n\r\n\"Stay, charming Nisida!\" cried the prince, in the manner of a man\r\novercome by irresistible passion.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want with me, signor?\" answered the maiden, amazed to hear\r\nherself called by name.\r\n\r\n\"To adore you as a Madonna is adored, and to make you aware of my\r\nsighs.\"\r\n\r\nNisida looked at him steadily, and, after a moment or two of reflection,\r\nasked suddenly, as though in response to some secret thought, \"Do you\r\nbelong to this country, or are you a foreigner?\"\r\n\r\n\"I arrived in this island,\" replied the prince without hesitation, \"at\r\nthe moment when the sun was writing his farewell to the earth and\r\ndipping the rays that serves as his pen into the shadow that serves as\r\nhis inkstand.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who are you?\" returned the young girl, not at all understanding\r\nthese strange words.\r\n\r\n\"Alas! I am but a poor student, but I may become a great poet like\r\nTasso, whose verses you often hear sung by a departing fisherman who\r\nsends his thrilling music as a last farewell that returns to die on the\r\nbeach.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know whether I am doing wrong to speak to you, but at least I\r\nwill be frank with you,\" said Nisida, blushing; \"I have the misfortune\r\nto be the richest girl on the island.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your father will not be inexorable,\" returned the prince ardently; \"one\r\nword from you, light of my eyes, goddess of my heart, and I will work\r\nnight and day, never pausing nor slackening, and will render myself\r\nworthy to possess the treasure that God has revealed to my dazzled eyes,\r\nand, from being poor and obscure as you see me, I will become rich and\r\npowerful.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have stayed too long listening to talk that a maiden should not hear;\r\npermit me, signor, to withdraw.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have pity on me, my cruel enemy! What have I done to you that you\r\nshould thus leave me with death in my soul? You do not know that, for\r\nmonths past, I have been following you everywhere like a shadow, that I\r\nprowl round your home at night, stifling my sighs lest they should\r\ndisturb your peaceful slumber. You are afraid, perhaps, to let yourself\r\nbe touched, at a first meeting, by a poor wretch who adores you. Alas!\r\nJuliet was young and beautiful like you, and she did not need many\r\nentreaties to take pity on Romeo.\"\r\n\r\nNisida suffered a sad and thoughtful look to fall upon this handsome\r\nyoung man who spoke to her in so gentle a voice, and withdrew without\r\nfurther reply, that she might not humiliate his poverty.\r\n\r\nThe prince made great efforts to suppress a strong inclination towards\r\nlaughter, and, very well satisfied with this opening, turned his steps\r\ntowards the spot where he had left his servant. Trespolo, after having\r\nemptied a bottle of lacryma with which he had provided himself for any\r\nemergency, had looked long around him to choose a spot where the grass\r\nwas especially high and thick, and had laid himself down to a sound\r\nsleep, murmuring as he did so, this sublime observation, \"O laziness,\r\nbut for the sin of Adam you would be a virtue!\"\r\n\r\nThe young girl could not close her eyes during the whole night after the\r\nconversation that she had held with the stranger. His sudden appearance,\r\nhis strange dress and odd speech, had awakened in her an uncertain\r\nfeeling that had been lying asleep in the bottom of her heart. She was\r\nat this time in all the vigour of her youth and of her resplendent\r\nbeauty. Nisida was not one of the weak and timid natures that are broken\r\nby suffering or domineered over by tyranny. Far otherwise: everything\r\naround her had contributed towards shaping for her a calm and serene\r\ndestiny; her simple, tender soul had unfolded in an atmosphere of peace\r\nand happiness. If she had not hitherto loved, it was the fault, not of\r\nher coldness but of the extreme timidity shown by the inhabitants of her\r\nisland. The blind depth of respect that surrounded the old fisherman had\r\ndrawn around his daughter a barrier of esteem and submission that no one\r\ndared to cross. By means of thrift and labour Solomon had succeeded in\r\ncreating for himself a prosperity that put the poverty of the other\r\nfishermen to the blush. No one had asked for Nisida because no one\r\nthought he deserved her. The only admirer who had dared to show his\r\npassion openly was Bastiano, the most devoted and dearest friend of\r\nGabriel; but Bastiano did not please her. So, trusting in her beauty,\r\nupheld by the mysterious hope that never deserts youth, she had resigned\r\nherself to wait, like some princess who knows that her betrothed will\r\ncome from a far country.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the Assumption she had left her island for the first time\r\nin her life, chance having chosen her among the maidens of the kingdom\r\nvowed by their mothers to the special protection of the Virgin. But,\r\noverwhelmed by the weight of a position so new to her, blushing and\r\nconfused under the eyes of an immense crowd, she had scarcely dared to\r\nraise her wondering looks, and the splendours of the town had passed\r\nbefore her like a dream, leaving but a vague remembrance.\r\n\r\nWhen she perceived the presence of this handsome young man, so slenderly\r\nand elegantly built, whose noble and calm demeanour contrasted with the\r\ntimidity and awkwardness of her other admirers, she felt herself\r\ninwardly disturbed, and no doubt she would have believed that her prince\r\nhad come, if she had been unpleasantly struck by the poverty of his\r\ndress. She had, nevertheless, allowed herself to listen to him longer\r\nthan she ought to have done, and she drew back with her bosom heavy, her\r\ncheek on fire, and her heart rent by an ache that was both dull and\r\nsharp.\r\n\r\n\"If my father does not wish me to marry him,\" she said to herself,\r\ntormented by the first remorseful feeling of her life. \"I shall have\r\ndone wrong to speak to him. And yet he is so handsome!\"\r\n\r\nThen she knelt before the Virgin, who was her only confidante, the poor\r\nchild having never known her mother, and tried to tell her the torments\r\nof her soul; but she could not achieve her prayer. The thoughts became\r\nentangled within her brain, and she surprised herself uttering strange\r\nwords. But, assuredly, the Holy Virgin must have taken pity upon her\r\nlovely devotee, for she rose with the impression of a consoling thought,\r\nresolved to confide everything to her father.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot have a moment’s doubt,\" she said to herself, as she unlaced\r\nher bodice, \"of my father’s affection. Well, then, if he forbids me to\r\nspeak to him, it will be for my good. And indeed, I have seen him but\r\nthis once,\" she added, as she threw herself upon the bed, \"and now I\r\nthink of it, I consider him very bold to dare to speak to me. I am\r\nalmost inclined to laugh at him. How confidently he brought out his\r\nnonsense, how absurdly he rolled his eyes! They are really very fine,\r\nthose eyes of his, and so is his mouth, and his forehead and his hair.\r\nHe does not suspect that I noticed his hands, which are really very\r\nwhite, when he raised them to heaven, like a madman, as he walked up and\r\ndown by the sea. Come, come, is he going to prevent my sleeping? I will\r\nnot see him again!\" she cried, drawing the sheet over her head like an\r\nangry child. Then she began to laugh to herself over her lover’s dress,\r\nand meditated long upon what her companions would say to it. Suddenly\r\nher brow contracted painfully, a frightful thought had stolen into her\r\nmind, she shuddered from head to foot. \"Suppose he were to think someone\r\nelse prettier than me? Men are so foolish! Certainly, it is too hot, and\r\nI shall not sleep to-night.\"\r\n\r\nThen she sat up in her bed, and continued her monologue—which we will\r\nspare the reader—till the morning. Scarcely had the first rays of light\r\nfiltered through the interlacing branches of jasmine and wavered into\r\nthe room, when Nisida dressed herself hurriedly, and went as usual to\r\npresent her forehead to her father’s kiss. The old man at once observed\r\nthe depression and weariness left by a sleepless night upon his\r\ndaughter’s face, and parting with an eager and anxious hand the\r\nbeautiful black hair that fell over her cheeks, he asked her, \"What is\r\nthe matter, my child? Thou hast not slept well?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not slept at all,\" answered Nisida, smiling, to reassure her\r\nfather; \"I am perfectly well, but I have something to confess to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak quickly, child; I am dying with impatience.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I have done wrong; but I want you to promise beforehand not to\r\nscold me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know very well that I spoil you,\" said the old man, with a caress;\r\n\"I shall not begin to be stern to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"A young man who does not belong to this island, and whose name I do not\r\nknow, spoke to me yesterday evening when I was taking the air at my\r\nwindow.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what was he so eager to say to you, my dear Nisida?\"\r\n\r\n\"He begged me to speak to you in his favour.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am listening. What can I do for him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Order me to marry him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And should you obey willingly?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so, father,\" the girl candidly replied. \"As to other things,\r\nyou yourself must judge in your wisdom; for I wanted to speak to you\r\nbefore coming to know him, so as not to go on with a conversation that\r\nyou might not approve. But there is a hindrance.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know that I do not recognise any when it is a question of making my\r\ndaughter happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is poor, father.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, all the more reason for me to like him. There is work here for\r\neverybody, and my table can spare a place for another son. He is young,\r\nhe has arms; no doubt he has some calling.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a poet.\"\r\n\r\n\"No matter; tell him to come and speak to me, and if he is an honest\r\nlad, I promise you, my child, that I will do anything in the world to\r\npromote your happiness.\"\r\n\r\nNisida embraced her father effusively, and was beside herself with joy\r\nall day, waiting impatiently for the evening in order to give the young\r\nman such splendid news. Eligi Brancaleone was but moderately flattered,\r\nas you will easily believe, by the fisherman’s magnanimous intentions\r\ntowards him; but like the finished seducer that he was, he appeared\r\nenchanted at them. Recollecting his character as a fantastical student\r\nand an out-at-elbows poet, he fell upon his knees and shouted a\r\nthanksgiving to the planet Venus; then, addressing the young girl, he\r\nadded, in a calmer voice, that he was going to write immediately to his\r\nown father, who in a week’s time would come to make his formal proposal;\r\nuntil then, he begged, as a favour, that he might not present himself to\r\nSolomon nor to any person at all in the island, and assigned as a\r\npretext a certain degree of shame which he felt on account of his old\r\nclothes, assuring his beloved that his father would bring him a complete\r\noutfit for the wedding-day.\r\n\r\nWhile the ill-starred girl was thus walking in terrifying security at\r\nthe edge of the precipice, Trespolo, following his master’s wishes, had\r\nestablished himself in the island as a pilgrim from Jerusalem. Playing\r\nhis part and sprinkling his conversation with biblical phrases, which\r\ncame to him readily, in his character of ex-sacristan, he distributed\r\nabundance of charms, wood of the true Cross and milk of the Blessed\r\nVirgin, and all those other inexhaustible treasures on which the eager\r\ndevotion of worthy people daily feeds. His relics were the more\r\nevidently authentic in that he did not sell any of them, and, bearing\r\nhis poverty in a holy manner, thanked the faithful and declined their\r\nalms. Only, out of regard for the established virtue of Solomon, he had\r\nconsented to break bread with the fisherman, and went to take meals with\r\nhim with the regularity of a cenobite. His abstinence aroused universal\r\nsurprise: a crust dipped in water, a few nuts or figs sufficed to keep\r\nthis holy man alive—to prevent him, that is to say, from dying.\r\nFurthermore, he entertained Nisida by his tales of his travels and by\r\nhis mysterious predictions. Unfortunately, he only appeared towards\r\nevening; for he spent the rest of the day in austerities and in\r\nprayers—in other words, in drinking like a Turk and snoring like a\r\nbuffalo.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the seventh day, after the promise given by the prince\r\nto the fisherman’s daughter, Brancaleone came into his servant’s room,\r\nand, shaking him roughly, cried in his ear, \"Up, odious marmot!\"\r\n\r\nTrespolo, awakened suddenly, rubbed his eyes in alarm. The dead,\r\nsleeping peacefully at the bottom of their coffins, will be less annoyed\r\nat the last day when the trump of Judgment comes to drag them from their\r\nslumbers. Fear having, however, immediately dispersed the dark clouds\r\nthat overspread his countenance, he sat up, and asked with an appearance\r\nof bewilderment—\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter, your excellency?\"\r\n\r\n\"The matter is that I will have you flayed alive a little if you do not\r\nleave off that execrable habit of sleeping twenty hours in the day.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was not asleep, prince!\" cried the servant boldly, as he sprang out\r\nof bed; \"I was reflecting—-\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen to me,\" said the prince in a severe tone; \"you were once\r\nemployed, I believe, in a chemist’s shop?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my lord, and I left because my employer had the scandalous\r\nbarbarity to make me pound drugs, which tired my arms horribly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here is a phial containing a solution of opium.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mercy!\" cried Trespolo, falling on his knees.\r\n\r\n\"Get up, idiot, and pay great attention to what I am going to say to\r\nyou. This little fool of a Nisida persists in wanting me to speak to her\r\nfather. I made her believe that I was going away this evening to fetch\r\nmy papers. There is no time to lose. They know you very well at the\r\nfisherman’s. You will pour this liquid into their wine; your life will\r\nanswer for your not giving them a larger dose than enough to produce a\r\ndeep sleep. You will take care to prepare me a good ladder for to-night;\r\nafter which you will go and wait for me in my boat, where you will find\r\nNuma and Bonaroux. They have my orders. I shall not want you in scaling\r\nthe fortress; I have my Campo Basso dagger.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my lord—-\" stammered Trespolo, astounded.\r\n\r\n\"No difficulties!\" cried the prince, stamping his foot furiously, \"or,\r\nby my father’s death, I will cure you, once for all, of your scruples.\"\r\nAnd he turned on his heel with the air of a man who is certain that\r\npeople will be very careful not to disobey his orders.\r\n\r\nThe unhappy Trespolo fulfilled his master’s injunctions punctually. With\r\nhim fear was the guiding principle. That evening the fisherman’s supper\r\ntable was hopelessly dull, and the sham pilgrim tried in vain to enliven\r\nit by factitious cheerfulness. Nisida was preoccupied by her lover’s\r\ndeparture, and Solomon, sharing unconsciously in his daughter’s grief,\r\nswallowed but a drop or two of wine, to avoid resisting the repeated\r\nurgency of his guest. Gabriel had set out in the morning for Sorrento\r\nand was not to return for two or three days; his absence tended to\r\nincrease the old man’s melancholy. As soon as Trespolo had retired, the\r\nfisherman yielded to his fatigue. Nisida, with her arms hanging by her\r\nsides, her head heavy and her heart oppressed by a sad presentiment, had\r\nscarcely strength to go up to her room, and after having mechanically\r\ntrimmed the lamp, sank on her bed as pale and stiff as a corpse.\r\n\r\nThe storm was breaking out with violence; one of those terrible storms\r\nseen only in the South, when the congregated clouds, parting suddenly,\r\nshed torrents of rain and of hail, and threaten another deluge. The roar\r\nof the thunder drew nearer and was like the noise of a cannonade. The\r\ngulf, lately so calm and smooth that the island was reflected as in a\r\nmirror, had suddenly darkened; the furiously leaping waves flung\r\nthemselves together like wild horses; the island quaked, shaken by\r\nterrible shocks. Even the boldest fishermen had drawn their boats\r\nashore, and, shut within their cabins, encouraged as best they could\r\ntheir frightened wives and children.\r\n\r\nAmid the deep darkness that overspread the sea Nisida’s lamp could be\r\nseen gleaming clear and limpid, as it burned before the Madonna. Two\r\nboats, without rudders, sails, or oars, tossed by the waves, beaten by\r\nthe winds, were whirling above the abyss; two men were in these two\r\nboats, their muscles tense, their breasts bare, their hair flying. They\r\ngazed haughtily on the sea, and braved the tempest.\r\n\r\n\"Once more, I beg you,\" cried one of these men, \"fear not for me,\r\nGabriel; I promise you that with my two broken oars and a little\r\nperseverance I shall get to Torre before daybreak.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are mad, Bastiano; we have not been able ever since the morning to\r\nget near Vico, and have been obliged to keep tacking about; your skill\r\nand strength have been able to do nothing against this frightful\r\nhurricane which has driven us back to this point.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the first time you have ever refused to go with me,\" remarked the\r\nyoung man.\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes, my dear Bastiano, I do not know how it is, but to-night I\r\nfeel drawn to the island by an irresistible power. The winds have been\r\nunchained to bring me back to it in spite of myself, and I will own to\r\nyou, even though it should make me seem like a madman in your eyes, that\r\nthis simple and ordinary event appears to me like an order from heaven.\r\nDo you see that lamp shining over there?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it,\" answered Bastiano, suppressing a sigh.\r\n\r\n\"It was lighted before the Virgin on the day when my sister was born,\r\nand for eighteen year it has never ceased to burn, night and day. It was\r\nmy mother’s vow. You do not know, my dear Bastiano, you cannot know how\r\nmany torturing thoughts that vow recalls to me. My poor mother called me\r\nto her deathbed and told me a frightful tale, a horrible secret, which\r\nweighs on my soul like a cloak of lead, and of which I can only relieve\r\nmyself by confiding it to a friend. When her painful story was ended she\r\nasked to see and to embrace my sister, who was just born; then with her\r\ntrembling hand, already chilled by the approach of death, she desired to\r\nlight the lamp herself. ’Remember,’ these were her last words,\r\n’remember, Gabriel, that your sister is vowed to the Madonna. As long as\r\nthis light shines before the blessed image of the Virgin, your sister\r\nwill be in no danger.’ You can understand now why, at night, when we are\r\ncrossing the gulf, my eyes are always fixed on that lamp. I have a\r\nbelief that nothing could shake, which is that on the day that light\r\ngoes out my sister’s soul will have taken flight to heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" cried Bastiano in an abrupt tone that betrayed the emotion of\r\nhis heart, \"if you prefer to stay, I will go alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Farewell,\" said Gabriel, without turning aside his eyes from the window\r\ntowards which he felt himself drawn by a fascination for which he could\r\nnot account. Bastiano disappeared, and Nisida’s brother, assisted by the\r\nwaves, was drawing nearer and nearer to the shore, when, at all once, he\r\nuttered a terrible cry which sounded above the noise of the tempest.\r\n\r\nThe star had just been extinguished; the lamp had been blown out.\r\n\r\n\"My sister is dead!\" cried Gabriel and, leaping into the sea, he cleft\r\nthe waves with the rapidity of lightning.\r\n\r\nThe storm had redoubled its intensity; long lines of lightning, rending\r\nthe sides of the clouds, bathed everything in their tawny and\r\nintermittent light. The fisherman perceived a ladder leaning against the\r\nfront of his home, seized it with a convulsive hand, and in three bounds\r\nflung himself into the room. The prince felt himself strangely moved on\r\nmaking his way into this pure and silent retreat. The calm and gentle\r\ngaze of the Virgin who seemed to be protecting the rest of the sleeping\r\ngirl, that perfume of innocence shed around the maidenly couch, that\r\nlamp, open-eyed amid the shadows, like a soul in prayer, had inspired\r\nthe seducer with an unknown distress. Irritated by what he called an\r\nabsurd cowardice, he had extinguished the obtrusive light, and was\r\nadvancing towards the bed, and addressing unspoken reproaches to\r\nhimself, when Gabriel swooped upon him with a wounded tiger’s fierce\r\ngnashing of the teeth.\r\n\r\nBrancaleone, by a bold and rapid movement that showed no common degree\r\nof skill and bravery, while struggling in the grasp of his powerful\r\nadversary, drew forth in his right hand a long dagger with a fine barbed\r\nblade. Gabriel smiled scornfully, snatched the weapon from him, and even\r\nas he stooped to break it across his knee, gave the prince a furious\r\nblow with his head that made him stagger and sent him rolling on the\r\nfloor, three paces away; then, leaning over his poor sister and gazing\r\non her with hungry eyes, by the passing gleam of a flash, \"Dead!\" he\r\nrepeated, wringing his arms in despair,—\"dead!\"\r\n\r\nIn the fearful paroxysm that compressed his throat he could find no\r\nother words to assuage his rage or to pour forth his woe. His hair,\r\nwhich the storm had flattened, rose on his head, the marrow of his bones\r\nwas chilled, and he felt his tears rush back upon his heart. It was a\r\nterrible moment; he forgot that the murderer still lived.\r\n\r\nThe prince, however, whose admirable composure did not for a moment\r\ndesert him, had risen, bruised and bleeding. Pale and trembling with\r\nrage, he sought everywhere for a weapon with which to avenge himself.\r\nGabriel returned towards him gloomier and more ominous than ever, and\r\ngrasping his neck with an iron hand, dragged him into the room where the\r\nold man was sleeping.\r\n\r\n\"Father! father! father!\" he cried in a piercing voice, \"here is the\r\nBastard who Has just murdered Nisida!\"\r\n\r\nThe old man, who had drunk but a few drops of the narcotic potion, was\r\nawakened by this cry which echoed through his soul; he arose as though\r\nmoved by a spring, flung off his coverings, and with that promptitude of\r\naction that God has bestowed upon mothers in moments of danger, even up\r\nto his daughter’s room, found a light, knelt on the edge of the bed, and\r\nbegan to test his child’s pulse and watch her breathing with mortal\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\nAll this had passed in less time than we have taken in telling it.\r\nBrancaleone by an unheard-of effort had freed himself from the hands of\r\nthe young fisherman, and suddenly resuming his princely pride, said in a\r\nloud voice, \"You shall not kill me without listening to me.\"\r\n\r\nGabriel would have overwhelmed him with Bitter reproaches, but, unable\r\nto utter a single word, he burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\"Your sister is not dead,\" said the prince, with cold dignity; \"she is\r\nmerely asleep. You can assure yourself of it, and meanwhile I undertake,\r\nupon my Honour, not to move a single step away.\"\r\n\r\nThese words were pronounced with such an accent of truth that the\r\nfisherman was struck by them. An unexpected gleam of hope suddenly\r\ndawned in his thoughts; he cast upon the stranger a glance of hate and\r\ndistrust, and muttered in a muffled voice, \"Do not flatter yourself, in\r\nany case, that you will be able to escape me.\"\r\n\r\nThen he went up to his sister’s room, and approaching the old man, asked\r\ntremblingly, \"Well, father?\"\r\n\r\nSolomon thrust him gently aside with the solicitude of a mother removing\r\nsome buzzing insect from her child’s cradle, and, making a sign to\r\nenjoin silence, added in a low voice, \"She is neither dead nor poisoned.\r\nSome philtre has been given to her for a bad purpose. Her breathing is\r\neven, and she cannot fail to recover from her lethargy.\"\r\n\r\nGabriel, reassured about Nisida’s life, returned silently to the ground\r\nfloor where he had left the seducer. His manner was grave and gloomy; he\r\nwas coming now not to rend the murderer of his sister with his hands,\r\nbut to elucidate a treacherous and infamous mystery, and to avenge his\r\nhonour which had been basely attacked. He opened wide the double\r\nentrance door that admitted daylight to the apartment in which, on the\r\nfew nights that he spent at home, he was accustomed to sleep with his\r\nfather. The rain had just stopped, a ray of moonlight pierced the\r\nclouds, and all at once made its way into the room. The fisherman\r\nadjusted his dripping garments, walked towards the stranger, who awaited\r\nhim without stirring, and after having gazed upon him haughtily, said,\r\n\"Now you are going to explain your presence in our house.\"\r\n\r\n\"I confess,\" said the prince, in an easy tone and with the most insolent\r\nassurance, \"that appearances are against me. It is the fate of lovers to\r\nbe treated as thieves. But although I have not the advantage of being\r\nknown to you, I am betrothed to the fair Nisida—with your father’s\r\napproval, of course. Now, as I have the misfortune to possess very\r\nhardhearted parents, they have had the cruelty to refuse me their\r\nconsent. Love led me astray, and I was about to be guilty of a fault for\r\nwhich a young man like you ought to have some indulgence. Furthermore,\r\nit was nothing but a mere attempt at an abduction, with the best\r\nintentions in the world, I swear, and I am ready to atone for everything\r\nif you will agree to give me your hand and call me your brother.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will agree to call you a coward and a betrayer!\" replied Gabriel,\r\nwhose face had begun to glow, as he heard his sister spoken of with such\r\nimpudent levity. \"If it is thus that insults are avenged in towns, we\r\nfishers have a different plan. Ah! so you flattered yourself with the\r\nthought of bringing desolation and disgrace into our home, and of paying\r\ninfamous assassins to come and share an old man’s bread so as to poison\r\nhis daughter, of stealing by night, like a brigand, armed with a dagger,\r\ninto my sister’s room, and of being let off by marrying the most\r\nbeautiful woman in the kingdom!\"\r\n\r\nThe prince made a movement.\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" continued Gabriel: \"I could break you as I broke your dagger\r\njust now; but I have pity on you. I see that you can do nothing with\r\nyour hands, neither defend yourself nor work. Go, I begin to understand;\r\nyou are a braggart, my fine sir; your poverty is usurped; you have\r\ndecked yourself in these poor clothes, but you are unworthy of them.\"\r\n\r\nHe suffered a glance of crushing contempt to fall upon the prince, then\r\ngoing to a cupboard hidden in the wall, he drew out a rifle and an axe.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" said he, \"are all the weapons in the house; choose.\"\r\n\r\nA flash of joy illuminated the countenance of the prince, who had\r\nhitherto suppressed his rage. He seized the rifle eagerly, drew three\r\nsteps backward, and drawing himself up to his full height, said, \"You\r\nwould have done better to lend me this weapon at the beginning; for then\r\nI would have been spared from witnessing your silly vapourings and\r\nfrantic convulsions. Thanks, young-man; one of my servants will bring\r\nyou back your gun. Farewell.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he threw him his purse, which fell heavily at the fisherman’s feet.\r\n\r\n\"I lent you that rifle to fight with me,\" cried Gabriel, whom surprise\r\nhad rooted to the spot.\r\n\r\n\"Move aside, my lad; you are out of your senses,\" said the prince,\r\ntaking a step towards the door.\r\n\r\n\"So you refuse to defend yourself?\" asked Gabriel in a determined voice.\r\n\r\n\"I have told you already that I cannot fight with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because such is the will of God; because you were born to crawl and I\r\nto trample you under my feet; because all the blood that I could shed in\r\nthis island would not purchase one drop of my blood; because a thousand\r\nlives of wretches like you are not equal to one hour of mine; because\r\nyou will kneel at my name that I, am now going to utter; because, in\r\nshort, you are but a poor fisherman and my name is Prince of\r\nBrancaleone.\"\r\n\r\nAt this dreaded name, which the young nobleman flung, like a\r\nthunderbolt, at his head, the fisherman bounded like a lion. He drew a\r\ndeep breath, as though he had lifted a weight that had long rested on\r\nhis heart.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" he cried, \"you have given yourself into my hands, my lord! Between\r\nthe poor fisherman and the all-powerful prince there is a debt of blood.\r\nYou shall pay for yourself and for your father. We are going to settle\r\nour accounts, your excellency,\" he added, rising his axe over the head\r\nof the prince, who was aiming at him. \"Oh! you were in too great haste\r\nto choose: the rifle is not loaded.\" The prince turned pale.\r\n\r\n\"Between our two families,\" Gabriel continued, \"there exists a horrible\r\nsecret which my mother confided to me on the brink of the grave, of\r\nwhich my father himself is unaware, and that no man in the world must\r\nlearn. You are different, you are going to die.\"\r\n\r\nHe dragged him into the space outside the house.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know why my sister, whom you wished to dishonour, was vowed to\r\nthe Madonna? Because your father, like you, wished to dishonour my\r\nmother. In your accursed house there is a tradition of infamy. You do\r\nnot know what slow and terrible torments my poor mother endured-torments\r\nthat broke her strength and caused her to die in early youth, and that\r\nher angelic soul dared confide to none but her son in that supreme hour\r\nand in order to bid me watch over my sister.\"\r\n\r\nThe fisherman wiped away a burning tear. \"One day, before we were born,\r\na fine lady, richly dressed, landed in our island from a splendid boat;\r\nshe asked to see my mother, who was as young and beautiful as my Nisida\r\nis to-day. She could not cease from admiring her; she blamed the\r\nblindness of fate which had buried this lovely jewel in the bosom of an\r\nobscure island; she showered praises, caresses, and gifts upon my\r\nmother, and after many indirect speeches, finally asked her parents for\r\nher, that she might make her her lady-in-waiting. The poor people,\r\nforeseeing in the protection of so great a lady a brilliant future for\r\ntheir daughter, were weak enough to yield. That lady was your mother;\r\nand do you know why she came thus to seek that poor innocent maiden?\r\nBecause your mother had a lover, and because she wished to make sure, in\r\nthis infamous manner, of the prince’s indulgence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Silence, wretch!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, your excellency will hear me out. At the beginning, my poor mother\r\nfound herself surrounded by the tenderest care: the princess could not\r\nbe parted from her for a moment; the most flattering words, the finest\r\nclothes, the richest ornaments were hers; the servants paid her as much\r\nrespect as though she were a daughter of the house. When her parents\r\nwent to see her and to inquire whether she did not at all regret having\r\nleft them, they found her so lovely and so happy, that they blessed the\r\nprincess as a good angel sent them from God. Then the prince conceived a\r\nremarkable affection for my mother; little by little his manners became\r\nmore familiar and affectionate. At last the princess went away for a few\r\ndays, regretting that she could not take with her her dear child, as she\r\ncalled her. Then the prince’s brutality knew no further barriers; he no\r\nlonger concealed his shameful plans of seduction; he spread before the\r\npoor girl’s eyes pearl necklaces and caskets of diamonds; he passed from\r\nthe most glowing passion to the blackest fury, from the humblest prayers\r\nto the most horrible threats. The poor child was shut up in a cellar\r\nwhere there was hardly a gleam of daylight, and every morning a\r\nfrightful gaoler came and threw her a bit of black bread, repeating with\r\noaths that it only depended upon herself to alter all this by becoming\r\nthe prince’s mistress. This cruelty continued for two years. The\r\nprincess had gone on a long journey, and my mother’s poor parents\r\nbelieved that their daughter was still happy with her protectress. On\r\nher return, having; no doubt fresh sins for which she needed\r\nforgiveness, she took my mother from her dungeon, assumed the liveliest\r\nindignation at this horrible treatment, about which she appeared to have\r\nknown nothing, wiped her tears, and by an abominable refinement of\r\nperfidy received the thanks of the victim whom she was about to\r\nsacrifice.\r\n\r\n\"One evening—I have just finished, my lord—the princess chose to sup\r\nalone with her lady-in-waiting: the rarest fruits, the most exquisite\r\ndishes, and the most delicate wines were served to my poor mother, whose\r\nprolonged privations had injured her health and weakened her reason; she\r\ngave way to a morbid gaiety. Diabolical philtres were poured into her\r\ncup; that is another tradition in your family. My mother felt uplifted,\r\nher eyes shone with feverish brilliance, her cheeks were on fire. Then\r\nthe prince came in—oh! your excellency will see that God protects the\r\npoor. My darling mother, like a frightened dove, sheltered herself in\r\nthe bosom of the princess, who pushed her away, laughing. The poor\r\ndistraught girl, trembling, weeping, knelt down in the midst of that\r\ninfamous room. It was St. Anne’s Day; all at once the house shook, the\r\nwalls cracked, cries of distress rang out in the streets. My mother was\r\nsaved. It was the earthquake that destroyed half Naples. You know all\r\nabout it, my lord, since your old palace is no longer habitable.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you driving at?\" cried Brancaleone in terrible agitation.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I merely wish to persuade you that you must fight with me,\"\r\nanswered the fisherman coldly, as he offered him a cartridge. \"And now,\"\r\nhe added, in an excited tone, \"say your prayers, my lord; for I warn\r\nyou, you will die by my hand; justice must be done.\"\r\n\r\nThe prince carefully examined the powder and shot, made sure that his\r\nrifle was in good condition; loaded it, and, eager to make an end, took\r\naim at the fisherman; but, either because he had been so much disturbed\r\nby his opponent’s terrible tale, or, because the grass was wet from the\r\nstorm, at the moment when he put forward his left foot to steady his\r\nshot, he slipped, lost his balance and fell on one knee. He fired into\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\n\"That does not count, my lord,\" cried Gabriel instantly, and handed him\r\na second charge.\r\n\r\nAt the noise of the report Solomon had appeared at the window, and,\r\nunderstanding what was going on, had lifted his hands to heaven, in\r\norder to address to God a dumb and fervent prayer. Eligi uttered a\r\nfrightful imprecation, and hastily reloaded his rifle; but, struck by\r\nthe calm confidence of the young man, who stood motionless before him,\r\nand by the old man, who, impassive and undisturbed, seemed to be\r\nconjuring God in the name of a father’s authority, disconcerted by his\r\nfall, his knees shaking and his arm jarred, he felt the chills of death\r\nrunning in his veins. Attempting, nevertheless, to master his emotion,\r\nhe took aim a second time; the bullet whistled by the fisherman’s ear\r\nand buried itself in the stem of a poplar.\r\n\r\nThe prince, with the energy of despair, seized the barrel of his weapon\r\nin both hands; but Gabriel was coming forward with his axe, a terrible\r\nfoe, and his first stroke carried away the butt of the rifle. He was\r\nstill hesitating, however, to kill a defenceless man, when two armed\r\nservants appeared at the end of the pathway. Gabriel did not see them\r\ncoming; but at the moment when they would have seized him by the\r\nshoulders, Solomon uttered a cry and rushed to his son’s assistance.\r\n\r\n\"Help, Numa! help, Bonaroux! Death to the ruffians! They want to murder\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"You lie, Prince of Brancaleone!\" cried Gabriel, and with one blow of\r\nthe axe he cleft his skull.\r\n\r\nThe two bravoes who were coming to their master’s assistance, when they\r\nsaw him fall, took flight; Solomon and his son went up to Nisida’s room.\r\nThe young girl had just shaken off her heavy slumber; a slight\r\nperspiration moistened her brow, and she opened her eyes slowly to the\r\ndawning day.\r\n\r\n\"Why are you looking at me in that way, father?\" she said, her mind\r\nstill wandering a little and she passed her hand over her forehead.\r\n\r\nThe old man embraced her tenderly.\r\n\r\n\"You have just passed through a great danger, my poor Nisida,\" said he;\r\n\"arise, and let us give thanks to the Madonna.\"\r\n\r\nThen all three, kneeling before the sacred image of the Virgin, began to\r\nrecite litanies. But at that very instant a noise of arms sounded in the\r\nenclosure, the house was surrounded by soldiers, and a lieutenant of\r\ngendarmes, seizing Gabriel, said in a loud voice, \"In the name of the\r\nlaw, I arrest you for the murder that you have just committed upon the\r\nperson of his excellency and illustrious lordship, the Prince of\r\nBrancaleone.\"\r\n\r\nNisida, struck by these words, remained pale and motionless like a\r\nmarble statue kneeling on a tomb; Gabriel was already preparing to make\r\nan unreasoning resistance, when a gesture from his father stopped him.\r\n\r\n\"Signor tenente,\" said the old man, addressing himself to the officer,\r\n\"my son killed the prince in lawful defence, for the latter had scaled\r\nour house and made his way in at night and with arms in his hand. The\r\nproofs are before your eyes. Here is a ladder set up against the window;\r\nand here,\" he proceeded, picking up the two pieces of the broken blade,\r\n\"is a dagger with the Brancaleone arms. However, we do not refuse to\r\nfollow you.\"\r\n\r\nThe last words of the fisherman were drowned by cries of \"Down with the\r\nsbirri! down with the gendarmes!\" which were repeated in every\r\ndirection. The whole island was up in arms, and the fisher-folk would\r\nhave suffered themselves to be cut up to the last man before allowing a\r\nsingle hair of Solomon or of his son to be touched; but the old man\r\nappeared upon his threshold, and, stretching out his arm with a calm and\r\ngrave movement that quieted the anger of the crowd, he said, \"Thanks, my\r\nchildren; the law must be respected. I shall be able, alone, to defend\r\nthe innocence of my son before the judges.\"\r\n\r\nHardly three months have elapsed since the day upon which we first\r\nbeheld the old fisherman of Nisida sitting before the door of his\r\ndwelling, irradiated by all the happiness that he had succeeded in\r\ncreating around him, reigning like a king, on his throne of rock, and\r\nblessing his two children, the most beautiful creatures in the island.\r\nNow the whole existence of this man, who was once so happy and so much\r\nenvied, is changed. The smiling cottage, that hung over the gulf like a\r\nswan over a transparent lake, is sad and desolate; the little enclosure,\r\nwith its hedges of lilac and hawthorn, where joyous groups used to come\r\nand sit at the close of day, is silent and deserted. No human sound\r\ndares to trouble the mourning of this saddened solitude. Only towards\r\nevening the waves of the sea, compassionating such great misfortunes,\r\ncome to murmur plaintive notes upon the beach.\r\n\r\nGabriel has been condemned. The news of the high-born Prince of\r\nBrancaleone’s death, so young, so handsome, and so universally adored,\r\nnot only fluttered the aristocracy of Naples, but excited profound\r\nindignation in all classes of people. He was mourned by everybody, and a\r\nunanimous cry for vengeance was raised against the murderer.\r\n\r\nThe authorities opened the inquiry with alarming promptness. The\r\nmagistrates whom their office called to judge this deplorable affair\r\ndisplayed, however, the most irreproachable integrity. No consideration\r\noutside their duty, no deference due to so noble and powerful a family,\r\ncould shake the convictions of their conscience. History has kept a\r\nrecord of this memorable trial; and has, no reproach to make to men\r\nwhich does not apply equally to the imperfection of human laws. The\r\nappearance of things, that fatal contradiction which the genius of evil\r\nso often here on earth gives to truth, overwhelmed the poor fisherman\r\nwith the most evident proofs.\r\n\r\nTrespolo, in whom fear had destroyed all scruples, being first examined,\r\nas having been the young prince’s confidant, declared with cool\r\nimpudence that, his master having shown a wish to escape for a few days\r\nfrom the importunities of a young married lady whose passion was\r\nbeginning to tire him, had followed him to the island with three or four\r\nof his most faithful servants, and that he himself had adopted the\r\ndisguise of a pilgrim, not wishing to betray his excellency’s incognito\r\nto the fisher-people, who would certainly have tormented so powerful a\r\nperson by all sorts of petitions. Two local watch men, who had happened\r\nto be on the hillside at the moment of the crime, gave evidence that\r\nconfirmed the valet’s lengthy statement; hidden by some under wood, they\r\nhad seen Gabriel rush upon the prince, and had distinctly heard the last\r\nwords of the dying man; calling \"Murder!\" All the witnesses, even those\r\nsummoned at the request of the prisoner, made his case worse by their\r\nstatements, which they tried to make favourable. Thus the court, with\r\nits usual perspicacity and its infallible certainty, succeeded in\r\nestablishing the fact that Prince Eligi of Brancaleone, having taken a\r\ntemporary dislike to town life, had retired to the little island of\r\nNisida, there to give himself up peaceably to the pleasure of fishing,\r\nfor which he had at all times had a particular predilection (a proof\r\nappeared among the documents of the case that the prince had regularly\r\nbeen present every other year at the tunny-fishing on his property at\r\nPalermo); that when once he was thus hidden in the island, Gabriel might\r\nhave recognised him, having gone with his sister to the procession, a\r\nfew days before, and had, no doubt, planned to murder him. On the day\r\nbefore the night of the crime, the absence of Gabriel and the\r\ndiscomposure of his father and sister had been remarked. Towards evening\r\nthe prince had dismissed his servant, and gone out alone, as his custom\r\nwas, to walk by the seashore. Surprised by the storm and not knowing the\r\nbyways of the island, he had wandered round the fisherman’s house,\r\nseeking a shelter; then Gabriel, encouraged by the darkness and by the\r\nnoise of the tempest, which seemed likely to cover the cries of his\r\nvictim, had, after prolonged hesitation, resolved to commit his crime,\r\nand having fired two shots at the unfortunate young man without\r\nsucceeding in wounding him, had put an end to him by blows of the axe;\r\nlastly, at the moment when, with Solomon’s assistance, he was about to\r\nthrow the body into the sea, the prince’s servants having appeared, they\r\nhad gone up to the girl’s room, and, inventing their absurd tale, had\r\ncast themselves on their knees before the Virgin, in order to mislead\r\nthe authorities. All the circumstances that poor Solomon cited in his\r\nson’s favour turned against him: the ladder at Nisida’s window belonged\r\nto the fisherman; the dagger which young Brancaleone always carried upon\r\nhim to defend himself had evidently been taken from him after his death,\r\nand Gabriel had hastened to break it, so as to destroy, to the best of\r\nhis power, the traces of his crime. Bastiano’s evidence did not receive\r\na minute’s consideration: he, to destroy the idea of premeditation,\r\ndeclared that the young fisherman had left him only at the moment when\r\nthe storm broke over the island; but, in the first place, the young\r\ndiver was known to be Gabriel’s most devoted friend and his sister’s\r\nwarmest admirer, and, in the second, he had been seen to land at Torre\r\nduring the same hour in which he had affirmed that he was near to\r\nNisida. As for the prince’s passion for the poor peasant girl, the\r\nmagistrates simply shrugged their shoulders at the ridiculous assertion\r\nof that, and especially at the young girl’s alleged resistance and the\r\nextreme measures to which the prince was supposed to have resorted to\r\nconquer the virtue of Nisida. Eligi of Brancaleone was so young, so\r\nhandsome, so seductive, and at the same time so cool amid his successes,\r\nthat he had never been suspected of violence, except in getting rid of\r\nhis mistresses. Finally, an overwhelming and unanswerable proof\r\noverthrew all the arguments for the defence: under the fisherman’s bed\r\nhad been found a purse with the Brancaleone arms, full of gold, the\r\npurse which, if our readers remember, the prince had flung as a last\r\ninsult at Gabriel’s feet.\r\n\r\nThe old man did not lose heart at this fabric of lies; after the\r\npleadings of the advocates whose ruinous eloquence he had bought with\r\nheavy gold, he defended his son himself, and put so much truth, so much\r\npassion, and so many tears into his speech, that the whole audience was\r\nmoved, and three of the judges voted for an acquittal; but the majority\r\nwas against it, and the fatal verdict was pronounced.\r\n\r\nThe news at once spread throughout the little island, and caused the\r\ndeepest dejection there. The fishers who, at the first irruption of\r\nforce, had risen as one man to defend their comrade’s cause, bowed their\r\nheads without a murmur before the unquestioned authority of a legal\r\njudgment. Solomon received unflinchingly the stab that pierced his\r\nheart. No sigh escaped his breast; no tear came to his eyes; his wound\r\ndid not bleed. Since his son’s arrest he had sold all he possessed in\r\nthe world, even the little silver cross left by his wife at her death,\r\neven the pearl necklace that flattered his fatherly pride by losing its\r\nwhiteness against his dear Nisida’s throat; the pieces of gold gained by\r\nthe sale of these things he had sewn into his coarse woollen cap, and\r\nhad established himself in the city. He ate nothing but the bread thrown\r\nto him by the pity of passers-by, and slept on the steps of churches or\r\nat the magistrates’ door.\r\n\r\nTo estimate at its full value the heroic courage of this unhappy father,\r\none must take a general view of the whole extent of his misfortune.\r\nOverwhelmed by age and grief, he looked forward with solemn calmness to\r\nthe terrible moment which would bear his son, a few days before him, to\r\nthe grave. His sharpest agony was the thought of the shame that would\r\nenvelop his family. The first scaffold erected in that gently mannered\r\nisland would arise for Gabriel, and that ignominious punishment tarnish\r\nthe whole population and imprint upon it the first brand of disgrace. By\r\na sad transition, which yet comes so easily in the destiny of man, the\r\npoor father grew to long for those moments of danger at which he had\r\nformerly trembled, those moments in which his son might have died nobly.\r\nAnd now all was lost: a long life of work, of abnegation, and of good\r\ndeeds, a pure and stainless reputation that had extended beyond the gulf\r\ninto distant countries, and the traditional admiration, rising almost to\r\nworship, of several generations; all these things only served to deepen\r\nthe pit into which the fisherman had fallen, at one blow, from his\r\nkingly height. Good fame, that divine halo without which nothing here on\r\nearth is sacred, had disappeared. Men no longer dared to defend the poor\r\nwretch, they pitied him. His name would soon carry horror with it, and\r\nNisida, poor orphan, would be nothing to anyone but the sister of a man\r\nwho had been condemned to death. Even Bastiano turned away his face and\r\nwept. Thus, when every respite was over, when poor Solomon’s every\r\nattempt had failed, people in the town who saw him smile strangely, as\r\nthough under the obsession of some fixed idea, said to one another that\r\nthe old man had lost his reason.\r\n\r\nGabriel saw his last day dawn, serenely and calmly. His sleep had been\r\ndeep; he awoke full of unknown joy; a cheerful ray of sunlight, falling\r\nthrough the loophole, wavered over the fine golden straw in his cell; an\r\nautumn breeze playing around him, brought an agreeable coolness to his\r\nbrow, and stirred in his long hair. The gaoler, who while he had had him\r\nin his charge had always behaved humanely, struck by his happy looks,\r\nhesitated to announce the priest’s visit, in fear of calling the poor\r\nprisoner from his dream. Gabriel received the news with pleasure; he\r\nconversed for two hours with the good priest, and shed sweet tears on\r\nreceiving the last absolution. The priest left the prison with tears in\r\nhis eyes, declaring aloud that he had never in his life met with a more\r\nbeautiful, pure, resigned, and courageous spirit.\r\n\r\nThe fisherman was still under the influence of this consoling emotion\r\nwhen his sister entered. Since the day when she had been carried,\r\nfainting, from the room where her brother had just been arrested, the\r\npoor girl, sheltered under the roof of an aunt, and accusing herself of\r\nall the evil that had befallen, had done nothing but weep at the feet of\r\nher holy protectress. Bowed by grief like a young lily before the storm,\r\nshe would spend whole hours, pale, motionless, detached from earthly\r\nthings, her tears flowing silently upon her beautiful clasped hands.\r\nWhen the moment came to go and embrace her brother for the last time,\r\nNisida arose with the courage of a saint. She wiped away the traces of\r\nher tears, smoothed her beautiful black hair, and put on her best white\r\ndress. Poor child, she tried to hide her grief by an angelic deception.\r\nShe had the strength to smile! At the sight of her alarming pallor\r\nGabriel felt his heart wrung, a cloud passed over his eyes; he would\r\nhave run to meet her, but, held back by the chain which fettered him to\r\na pillar of his prison, stepped back sharply and stumbled. Nisida flew\r\nto her brother and upheld him in her arms. The young girl had understood\r\nhim; she assured him that she was well. Fearing to remind him of his\r\nterrible position, she spoke volubly of all manner of things—her aunt,\r\nthe weather, the Madonna. Then she stopped suddenly, frightened at her\r\nown words, frightened at her own silence; she fixed her burning gaze\r\nupon her brother’s brow as though to fascinate him. Little by little\r\nanimation returned to her; a faint colour tinted her hollowed cheeks,\r\nand Gabriel, deceived by the maiden’s super human efforts, thought her\r\nstill beautiful, and thanked God in his heart for having spared this\r\ntender creature. Nisida, as though she had followed her brother’s secret\r\nthoughts, came close to him, pressed his hand with an air of\r\nunderstanding, and murmured low in his ear, \"Fortunately our father has\r\nbeen away for two days; he sent me word that he would be detained in\r\ntown. For us, it is different; we are young, we have courage!\"\r\n\r\nThe poor young girl was trembling like a leaf.\r\n\r\n\"What will become of you, my poor Nisida?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! I will pray to the Madonna. Does she not watch over us?\" The girl\r\nstopped, struck by the sound of her own words, which the circumstances\r\nso cruelly contradicted. But looking at her brother, she went on in a\r\nlow tone: \"Assuredly she does watch over us. She appeared to me last\r\nnight in a dream. She held her child Jesus on her arm, and looked at me\r\nwith a mother’s tenderness. She wishes to make saints of us, for she\r\nloves us; and to be a saint, you see, Gabriel, one must suffer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, go and pray for me, my kind sister; go away from the view of this\r\nsad place, which will eventually shake your firmness, and perhaps mine.\r\nGo; we shall see each other again in heaven above, where our mother is\r\nwaiting for us—our mother whom you have not known, and to whom I shall\r\noften speak of you. Farewell, my sister, until we meet again!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he kissed her on the forehead.\r\n\r\nThe young girl called up all her strength into her heart for this\r\nsupreme moment; she walked with a firm step; having reached the\r\nthreshold, she turned round and waved him a farewell, preventing herself\r\nby a nervous contraction from bursting into tears, but as soon as she\r\nwas in the corridor, a sob broke from her bosom, and Gabriel, who heard\r\nit echo from the vaulted roof, thought that his heart would break.\r\n\r\nThen he threw himself on his knees, and, lifting his hands to heaven,\r\ncried, \"I have finished suffering; I have nothing more that holds me to\r\nlife. I thank Thee, my God! Thou hast kept my father away, and hast been\r\nwilling to spare the poor old man a grief that would have been beyond\r\nhis strength.\"\r\n\r\nIt was at the hour of noon, after having exhausted every possible means,\r\npoured out his gold to the last piece, and embraced the knees of the\r\nlowest serving man, that Solomon the fisherman took his way to his son’s\r\nprison. His brow was so woebegone that the guards drew back, seized with\r\npity, and the gaoler wept as he closed the door of the cell upon him.\r\nThe old man remained some moments without advancing a step, absorbed in\r\ncontemplation of his son. By the tawny gleam of his eye might be divined\r\nthat the soul of the man was moved at that instant by some dark project.\r\nHe seemed nevertheless struck by the-beauty of Gabriel’s face. Three\r\nmonths in prison had restored to his skin the whiteness that the sun had\r\nturned brown; his fine dark hair fell in curls around his neck, his eyes\r\nrested on his father with a liquid and brilliant gaze. Never had this\r\nhead been so beautiful as now, when it was to fall.\r\n\r\n\"Alas, my poor son!\" said the old man, \"there is no hope left; you must\r\ndie.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it,\" answered Gabriel in a tone of tender reproach, \"and it is\r\nnot that which most afflicts me at this moment. But you, too, why do you\r\nwish to give me pain, at your age? Why did you not stay in the town?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the town,\" the old man returned, \"they have no pity; I cast myself\r\nat the king’s feet, at everybody’s feet; there is no pardon, no mercy\r\nfor us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, in God’s name, what is death to me? I meet it daily on the sea.\r\nMy greatest, my only torment is the pain that they are causing you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I, do you think, my Gabriel, that I only suffer in seeing you die?\r\nOh, it is but a parting for a few days; I shall soon go to join you. But\r\na darker sorrow weighs upon me. I am strong, I am a man\". He stopped,\r\nfearing that he had said too much; then drawing near to his son, he said\r\nin a tearful voice, \"Forgive me, my Gabriel; I am the cause of your\r\ndeath. I ought to have killed the prince with my own hand. In our\r\ncountry, children and old men are not condemned to death. I am over\r\neighty years old; I should have been pardoned; they told me that when,\r\nwith tears, I asked pardon for you; once more, forgive me, Gabriel; I\r\nthought my daughter was dead; I thought of nothing else; and besides, I\r\ndid not know the law.\"\r\n\r\n\"Father, father!\" cried Gabriel, touched, \"what are you saying? I would\r\nhave given my life a thousand times over to purchase one day of yours.\r\nSince you are strong enough to be present at my last hour, fear not; you\r\nwill not see me turn pale; your son will be worthy of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he is to die, to die!\" cried Solomon, striking his forehead in\r\ndespair, and casting on the walls of the dungeon a look of fire that\r\nwould fain have pierced them.\r\n\r\n\"I am resigned, father,\" said Gabriel gently; did not Christ ascend the\r\ncross?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" murmured the old man in a muffled voice, \"but He did not leave\r\nbehind a sister dishonoured by His death.\"\r\n\r\nThese words, which escaped the old fisherman in spite of himself, threw\r\na sudden and terrible light into the soul of Gabriel. For the first time\r\nhe perceived all the infamous manner of his death: the shameless\r\npopulace crowding round the scaffold, the hateful hand of the\r\nexecutioner taking him by the Hair, and the drops of his blood\r\nbesprinkling the white raiment of his sister and covering her with\r\nshame.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if I could get a weapon!\" cried Gabriel, his haggard eyes roaming\r\naround.\r\n\r\n\"It is not the weapon that is lacking,\" answered Solomon, carrying his\r\nhand to the hilt of a dagger that he had hidden in his breast.\r\n\r\n\"Then kill me, father,\" said Gabriel in a low tone, but with an\r\nirresistible accent of persuasion and entreaty; \"oh yes, I confess it\r\nnow, the executioner’s hand frightens me. My Nisida, my poor Nisida, I\r\nhave seen her; she was here just now, as beautiful and as pale as the\r\nMadonna Dolorosa; she smiled to hide from me her sufferings. She was\r\nhappy, poor girl, because she believed you away. Oh, how sweet it will\r\nbe to me to die by your hand! You gave me life; take it back, father,\r\nsince God will have it so. And Nisida will be saved. Oh, do not\r\nhesitate! It would be a cowardice on the part of both of us; she is my\r\nsister, she is your daughter.\"\r\n\r\nAnd seeing that his powerful will had subjugated the old man, he said,\r\n\"Help! help, father!\" and offered his breast to the blow. The poor\r\nfather lifted his hand to strike; but a mortal convulsion ran through\r\nall his limbs; he fell into his son’s arms, and both burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\"Poor father!\" said Gabriel. \"I ought to have foreseen that. Give me\r\nthat dagger and turn away; I am young and my arm will not tremble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no!\" returned Solomon solemnly, \"no, my son, for then you would be a\r\nsuicide! Let your soul ascend to heaven pure! God will give me His\r\nstrength. Moreover, we have time yet.\"\r\n\r\nAnd a last ray of hope shone in the eyes of the fisherman.\r\n\r\nThen there passed in that dungeon one of those scenes that words can\r\nnever reproduce. The poor father sat down on the straw at his son’s side\r\nand laid his head gently upon his knees. He smiled to him through his\r\ntears, as one smiles to a sick child; he passed his hand slowly through\r\nthe silky curls of his hair, and asked him countless questions,\r\nintermingled with caresses. In order to give him a distaste for this\r\nworld he kept on talking to him of the other. Then, with a sudden\r\nchange, he questioned him minutely about all sorts of past matters.\r\nSometimes he stopped in alarm, and counted the beatings of his heart,\r\nwhich were hurriedly marking the passage of time.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me everything, my child; have you any desire, any wish that could\r\nbe satisfied before you die? Are you leaving any woman whom you loved\r\nsecretly? Everything we have left shall be hers.\"\r\n\r\n\"I regret nothing on earth but you and my sister. You are the only\r\npersons whom I have loved since my mother’s death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, be comforted. Your sister will be saved.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes! I shall die happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you forgive our enemies?\"\r\n\r\n\"With all the strength of my heart. I pray God to have mercy on the\r\nwitnesses who accused me. May He forgive me my sins!\"\r\n\r\n\"How old is it that you will soon be?\" the old man asked suddenly, for\r\nhis reason was beginning to totter, and his memory had failed him.\r\n\r\n\"I was twenty-five on All Hallows’ Day.\"\r\n\r\n\"True; it was a sad day, this year; you were in prison.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you remember how, five years ago, on that same day I got the prize\r\nin the regatta at Venice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me about that, my child.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he listened, his neck stretched forward, his mouth half open, his\r\nhands in his son’s. A sound of steps came in from the corridor, and a\r\ndull knock was struck upon the door. It was the fatal hour. The poor\r\nfather had forgotten it.\r\n\r\nThe priests had already begun to sing the death hymn; the executioner\r\nwas ready, the procession had set out, when Solomon the fisherman\r\nappeared suddenly on the threshold of the prison, his eyes aflame and\r\nhis brow radiant with the halo of the patriarchs. The old man drew\r\nhimself up to his full height, and raising in one hand the reddened\r\nknife, said in a sublime voice, \"The sacrifice is fulfilled. God did not\r\nsend His angel to stay the hand of Abraham.\"\r\n\r\nThe crowd carried him in triumph!\r\n\r\n[The details of this case are recorded in the archives of the Criminal\r\nCourt at Naples. We have changed nothing in the age or position of the\r\npersons who appear in this narrative. One of the most celebrated\r\nadvocates at the Neapolitan bar secured the acquittal of the old man.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*DERUES*\r\n\r\n\r\nOne September afternoon in 1751, towards half-past five, about a score\r\nof small boys, chattering, pushing, and tumbling over one another like a\r\ncovey of partridges, issued from one of the religious schools of\r\nChartres. The joy of the little troop just escaped from a long and\r\nwearisome captivity was doubly great: a slight accident to one of the\r\nteachers had caused the class to be dismissed half an hour earlier than\r\nusual, and in consequence of the extra work thrown on the teaching staff\r\nthe brother whose duty it was to see all the scholars safe home was\r\ncompelled to omit that part of his daily task. Therefore not only thirty\r\nor forty minutes were stolen from work, but there was also unexpected,\r\nuncontrolled liberty, free from the surveillance of that black-cassocked\r\noverseer who kept order in their ranks. Thirty minutes! at that age it\r\nis a century, of laughter and prospective games! Each had promised\r\nsolemnly, under pain of severe punishment, to return straight to his\r\npaternal nest without delay, but the air was so fresh and pure, the\r\ncountry smiled all around! The school, or preferably the cage, which had\r\njust opened, lay at the extreme edge of one of the suburbs, and it only\r\nrequired a few steps to slip under a cluster of trees by a sparkling\r\nbrook beyond which rose undulating ground, breaking the monotony of a\r\nvast and fertile plain. Was it possible to be obedient, to refrain from\r\nthe desire to spread one’s wings? The scent of the meadows mounted to\r\nthe heads of the steadiest among them, and intoxicated even the most\r\ntimid. It was resolved to betray the confidence of the reverend fathers,\r\neven at the risk of disgrace and punishment next morning, supposing the\r\nescapade were discovered.\r\n\r\nA flock of sparrows suddenly released from a cage could not have flown\r\nmore wildly into the little wood. They were all about the same age, the\r\neldest might be nine. They flung off coats and waistcoats, and the grass\r\nbecame strewn with baskets, copy-books, dictionaries, and catechisms.\r\nWhile the crowd of fair-haired heads, of fresh and smiling faces,\r\nnoisily consulted as to which game should be chosen, a boy who had taken\r\nno part in the general gaiety, and who had been carried away by the rush\r\nwithout being able to escape sooner, glided slyly away among the trees,\r\nand, thinking himself unseen, was beating a hasty retreat, when one of\r\nhis comrades cried out—\r\n\r\n\"Antoine is running away!\"\r\n\r\nTwo of the best runners immediately started in pursuit, and the\r\nfugitive, notwithstanding his start, was speedily overtaken, seized by\r\nhis collar, and brought back as a deserter.\r\n\r\n\"Where were you going?\" the others demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Home to my cousins,\" replied the boy; \"there is no harm in that.\"\r\n\r\n\"You canting sneak!\" said another boy, putting his fist under the\r\ncaptive’s chin; \"you were going to the master to tell of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pierre,\" responded Antoine, \"you know quite well I never tell lies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!—only this morning you pretended I had taken a book you had\r\nlost, and you did it because I kicked you yesterday, and you didn’t dare\r\nto kick me back again.\"\r\n\r\nAntoine lifted his eyes to heaven, and folding his arms on his breast—\r\n\r\n\"Dear Buttel,\" he said, \"you are mistaken; I have always been taught to\r\nforgive injuries.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen, listen! he might be saying his prayers!\" cried the other boys;\r\nand a volley of offensive epithets, enforced by cuffs, was hurled at the\r\nculprit.\r\n\r\nPierre Buttel, whose influence was great, put a stop to this onslaught.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Antoine, you are a bad lot, that we all know; you are a\r\nsneak and a hypocrite. It’s time we put a stop to it. Take off your coat\r\nand fight it out. If you like, we will fight every morning and evening\r\ntill the end of the month.\"\r\n\r\nThe proposition was loudly applauded, and Pierre, turning up his sleeves\r\nas far as his elbows, prepared to suit actions to words.\r\n\r\nThe challenger assuredly did not realise the full meaning, of his words;\r\nhad he done so, this chivalrous defiance would simply have been an act\r\nof cowardice on his part, for there could be no doubt as to the victor\r\nin such a conflict. The one was a boy of alert and gallant bearing,\r\nstrong upon his legs, supple and muscular, a vigorous man in embryo;\r\nwhile the other, not quite so old, small, thin, of a sickly leaden\r\ncomplexion, seemed as if he might be blown away by a strong puff of\r\nwind. His skinny arms and legs hung on to his body like the claws of a\r\nspider, his fair hair inclined to red, his white skin appeared nearly\r\nbloodless, and the consciousness of weakness made him timid, and gave a\r\nshifty, uneasy look to his eyes. His whole expression was uncertain, and\r\nlooking only at his face it was difficult at first sight to decide to\r\nwhich sex he belonged. This confusion of two natures, this indefinable\r\nmixture of feminine weakness without grace, and of abortive boyhood,\r\nseemed to stamp him as something exceptional, unclassable, and once\r\nobserved, it was difficult to take one’s eyes from him. Had he been\r\nendowed with physical strength he would have been a terror to his\r\ncomrades, exercising by fear the ascendancy which Pierre owed to his\r\njoyous temper and unwearied gaiety, for this mean exterior concealed\r\nextraordinary powers of will and dissimulation. Guided by instinct, the\r\nother children hung about Pierre and willingly accepted his leadership;\r\nby instinct also they avoided Antoine, repelled by a feeling of chill,\r\nas if from the neighbourhood of a reptile, and shunning him unless to\r\nprofit in some way by their superior strength. Never would he join their\r\ngames without compulsion; his thin, colourless lips seldom parted for a\r\nlaugh, and even at that tender age his smile had an unpleasantly\r\nsinister expression.\r\n\r\n\"Will you fight?\" again demanded Pierre.\r\n\r\nAntoine glanced hastily round; there was no chance of escape, a double\r\nring enclosed him. To accept or refuse seemed about equally risky; he\r\nran a good chance of a thrashing whichever way he decided. Although his\r\nheart beat loudly, no trace of emotion appeared on his pallid cheek; an\r\nunforeseen danger would have made him shriek, but he had had time to\r\ncollect himself, time to shelter behind hypocrisy. As soon as he could\r\nlie and cheat he recovered courage, and the instinct of cunning, once\r\nroused, prevailed over everything else. Instead of answering this second\r\nchallenge, he knelt down and said to Pierre—\r\n\r\n\"You are much stronger than I am.\"\r\n\r\nThis submission disarmed his antagonist. \"Get up,\" he replied; \"I won’t\r\ntouch you, if you can’t defend yourself.\r\n\r\n\"Pierre,\" continued Antoine, still on his knees, \"I assure you, by God\r\nand the Holy Virgin, I was not going to tell. I was going home to my\r\ncousins to learn my lessons for to-morrow; you know how slow I am. If\r\nyou think I have done you any harm, I ask your forgiveness.\"\r\n\r\nPierre held out his hand and made him get up.\r\n\r\n\"Will you be a good fellow, Antoine, and play with us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I will.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, then; let us forget all about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are we to play at?\" asked Antoine, taking off his coat.\r\n\r\n\"Thieves and archers,\" cried one of the boys....\r\n\r\n\"Splendid!\" said Pierre; and using his acknowledged authority, he\r\ndivided them into two sides—ten highwaymen, whom he was to command, and\r\nten archers of the guard, who were to pursue them; Antoine was among the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nThe highwaymen, armed with swords and guns obtained from the willows\r\nwhich grew along the brook, moved off first, and gained the valleys\r\nbetween the little hills beyond the wood. The fight was to be serious,\r\nand any prisoner on either side was to be tried immediately. The robbers\r\ndivided into twos and threes, and hid themselves in the ravines.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later the archers started in pursuit. There were\r\nencounters, surprises, skirmishes; but whenever it came to close\r\nquarters, Pierre’s men, skilfully distributed, united on hearing his\r\nwhistle, and the Army of justice had to retreat. But there came a time\r\nwhen this magic signal was no longer heard, and the robbers became\r\nuneasy, and remained crouching in their hiding-places. Pierre,\r\nover-daring, had undertaken to defend alone the entrance of a dangerous\r\npassage and to stop the whole hostile troop there. Whilst he kept them\r\nengaged, half of his men, concealed on the left, were to come round the\r\nfoot of the hill and make a rush on hearing his whistle; the other half,\r\nalso stationed at some, little distance, were to execute the same\r\nmanoeuvre from above. The archers would be caught in a trap, and\r\nattacked both in front and rear, would be obliged to surrender at\r\ndiscretion. Chance, which not unfrequently decides the fate of a battle,\r\ndefeated this excellent stratagem. Watching intently; Pierre failed to\r\nperceive that while his whole attention was given to the ground in\r\nfront, the archers had taken an entirely different road from the one\r\nthey ought to have followed if his combination were to succeed. They\r\nsuddenly fell upon him from behind, and before he could blow his\r\nwhistle, they gagged him with a handkerchief and tied his hands. Six\r\nremained to keep the field of battle and disperse the hostile band, now\r\ndeprived of its chief; the remaining four conveyed Pierre to the little\r\nwood, while the robbers, hearing no signal, did not venture to stir.\r\nAccording to agreement, Pierre Buttel was tried by the archers, who\r\npromptly transformed themselves into a court of justice, and as he had\r\nbeen taken red-handed, and did not condescend to defend himself, the\r\ntrial was not a long affair. He was unanimously sentenced to be hung,\r\nand the execution was then and there carried out, at the request of the\r\ncriminal himself, who wanted the game to be properly played to the end,\r\nand who actually selected a suitable tree for his own execution.\r\n\r\n\"But, Pierre,\" said one of the judges, \"how can you be held up there?\"\r\n\r\n\"How stupid you are!\" returned the captive. \"I shall only pretend to be\r\nhung, of course. See here!\" and he fastened together several pieces\r\nstrong string which had tied some of the other boys’ books, piled the\r\nlatter together, and standing on tiptoe on this very insecure basis,\r\nfastened one end of the cord to a horizontal bough, and put his neck\r\ninto a running knot at the other end, endeavouring to imitate the\r\ncontortions of an actual sufferer. Shouts of laughter greeted him, and\r\nthe victim laughed loudest of all. Three archers went to call the rest\r\nto behold this amusing spectacle; one, tired out, remained with the\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Hangman,\" said Pierre, putting out his tongue at him, \"are the\r\nbooks firm? I thought I felt them give way.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Antoine; it was he who remained. \"Don’t be afraid,\r\nPierre.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a good thing; for if they fell I don’t think the cord is long\r\nenough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don’t you really think so?\"\r\n\r\nA horrible thought showed itself like a flash on the child’s face. He\r\nresembled a young hyena scenting blood for the first time. He glanced at\r\nthe pile of books Pierre was standing on, and compared it with the\r\nlength of the cord between the branch and his neck. It was already\r\nnearly dark, the shadows were deepening in the wood, gleams of pale\r\nlight penetrated between the trees, the leaves had become black and\r\nrustled in the wind. Antoine stood silent and motionless, listening if\r\nany sound could be heard near them.\r\n\r\nIt would be a curious study for the moralist to observe how the first\r\nthought of crime develops itself in the recesses of the human heart, and\r\nhow this poisoned germ grows and stifles all other sentiments; an\r\nimpressive lesson might be gathered from this struggle of two opposing\r\nprinciples, however weak it may be, in perverted natures. In cases where\r\njudgment can discern, where there is power to choose between good and\r\nevil, the guilty person has only himself to blame, and the most heinous\r\ncrime is only the action of its perpetrator. It is a human action, the\r\nresult of passions which might have been controlled, and one’s mind is\r\nnot uncertain, nor one’s conscience doubtful, as to the guilt. But how\r\ncan one conceive this taste for murder in a young child, how imagine it,\r\nwithout being tempted to exchange the idea of eternal sovereign justice\r\nfor that of blind-fatality? How can one judge without hesitation between\r\nthe moral sense which has given way and the instinct which displays\r\nitself? how not exclaim that the designs of a Creator who retains the\r\none and impels the other are sometimes mysterious and inexplicable, and\r\nthat one must submit without understanding?\r\n\r\n\"Do you hear them coming?\" asked Pierre.\r\n\r\n\"I hear nothing,\" replied Antoine, and a nervous shiver ran through all\r\nhis members.\r\n\r\n\"So much the worse. I am tired of being dead; I shall come to life and\r\nrun after them. Hold the books, and I will undo the noose.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you move, the books will separate; wait, I will hold them.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he knelt down, and collecting all his strength, gave the pile a\r\nviolent push.\r\n\r\nPierre endeavoured to raise his hands to his throat. \"What are you\r\ndoing?\" he cried in a suffocating voice.\r\n\r\n\"I am paying you out;\" replied Antoine, folding his arms.\r\n\r\nPierre’s feet were only a few inches from the ground, and the weight of\r\nhis body at first bent the bough for a moment; but it rose again, and\r\nthe unfortunate boy exhausted himself in useless efforts. At every\r\nmovement the knot grew tighter, his legs struggled, his arms sought\r\nvainly something to lay hold of; then his movements slackened, his limbs\r\nstiffened, and his hands sank down. Of so much life and vigour nothing\r\nremained but the movement of an inert mass turning round and round upon\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nNot till then did Antoine cry for help, and when the other boys hastened\r\nup they found him crying and tearing his hair. So violent indeed were\r\nhis sobs and his despair that he could hardly be understood as he tried\r\nto explain how the books had given way under Pierre, and how he had\r\nvainly endeavoured to support him in his arms.\r\n\r\nThis boy, left an orphan at three years old, had been brought up at\r\nfirst by a relation who turned him out for theft; afterwards by two\r\nsisters, his cousins, who were already beginning to take alarm at his\r\nabnormal perversity. This pale and fragile being, an incorrigible thief,\r\na consummate hypocrite, and a cold-blooded assassin, was predestined to\r\nan immortality of crime, and was to find a place among the most\r\nexecrable monsters for whom humanity has ever had to blush; his name was\r\nAntoine-Francois Derues.\r\n\r\nTwenty years had gone by since this horrible and mysterious event, which\r\nno one sought to unravel at the time it occurred. One June evening,\r\n1771, four persons were sitting in one of the rooms of a modestly\r\nfurnished, dwelling on the third floor of a house in the rue\r\nSaint-Victor. The party consisted of three women and an ecclesiastic,\r\nwho boarded, for meals only, with the woman who tenanted the dwelling;\r\nthe other two were near neighbours. They were all friends, and often met\r\nthus in the evening to play cards. They were sitting round the\r\ncard-table, but although it was nearly ten o’clock the cards had not yet\r\nbeen touched. They spoke in low tones, and a half-interrupted confidence\r\nhad, this evening, put a check on the usual gaiety.\r\n\r\nSomeone knocked gently at the door, although no sound of steps on the\r\ncreaking wooden staircase had been heard, and a wheedling voice asked\r\nfor admittance. The occupier of the room, Madame Legrand, rose, and\r\nadmitted a man of about six-and-twenty, at whose appearance the four\r\nfriends exchanged glances, at once observed by the new-comer, who\r\naffected, however, not to see them. He bowed successively to the three\r\nwomen, and several times with the utmost respect to the abbe, making\r\nsigns of apology for the interruption caused by his appearance; then,\r\ncoughing several times, he turned to Madame Legrand, and said in a\r\nfeeble voice, which seemed to betoken much suffering—\r\n\r\n\"My kind mistress, will you and these other ladies excuse my presenting\r\nmyself at such an hour and in such a costume? I am ill, and I was\r\nobliged to get up.\"\r\n\r\nHis costume was certainly singular enough: he was wrapped in a large\r\ndressing-gown of flowered chintz; his head was adorned by a nightcap\r\ndrawn up at the top and surmounted by a muslin frill. His appearance did\r\nnot contradict his complaint of illness; he was barely four feet six in\r\nheight, his limbs were bony, his face sharp, thin, and pale. Thus\r\nattired, coughing incessantly, dragging his feet as if he had no\r\nstrength to lift them, holding a lighted candle in one hand and an egg\r\nin the other, he suggested a caricature-some imaginary invalid just\r\nescaped from M. Purgon. Nevertheless, no one ventured to smile,\r\nnotwithstanding his valetudinarian appearance and his air of affected\r\nhumility. The perpetual blinking of the yellow eyelids which fell over\r\nthe round and hollow eyes, shining with a sombre fire which he could\r\nnever entirely suppress, reminded one of a bird of prey unable to face\r\nthe light, and the lines of his face, the hooked nose, and the thin,\r\nconstantly quivering, drawn-in lips suggested a mixture of boldness and\r\nbaseness, of cunning and sincerity. But there is no book which can\r\ninstruct one to read the human countenance correctly; and some special\r\ncircumstance must have roused the suspicions of these four persons so\r\nmuch as to cause them to make these observations, and they were not as\r\nusual deceived by the humbug of this skilled actor, a past master in the\r\nart of deception.\r\n\r\nHe continued after a moment’s silence, as if he did not wish to\r\ninterrupt their mute observation—\r\n\r\n\"Will you oblige me by a neighbourly kindness?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Derues?\" asked Madame Legrand. A violent cough, which\r\nappeared to rend his chest, prevented him from answering immediately.\r\nWhen it ceased, he looked at the abbe, and said, with a melancholy\r\nsmile—\r\n\r\n\"What I ought to ask in my present state of health is your blessing, my\r\nfather, and your intercession for the pardon of my sins. But everyone\r\nclings to the life which God has given him. We do not easily abandon\r\nhope; moreover, I have always considered it wrong to neglect such means\r\nof preserving our lives as are in our power, since life is for us only a\r\ntime of trial, and the longer and harder the trial the greater our\r\nrecompense in a better world. Whatever befalls us, our answer should be\r\nthat of the Virgin Mary to the angel who announced the mystery of the\r\nIncarnation: ’Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according\r\nto Thy word.’\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" said the abbe, with a severe and inquisitorial look,\r\nunder which Derues remained quite untroubled; \"it is an attribute of God\r\nto reward and to punish, and the Almighty is not deceived by him who\r\ndeceives men. The Psalmist has said, ’Righteous art Thou, O Lord, and\r\nupright are Thy judgments.’\"\r\n\r\n\"He has said also, ’The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous\r\naltogether,’\" Derues promptly replied. This exchange of quotations from\r\nScripture might have lasted for hours without his being at a loss, had\r\nthe abbe thought fit to continue in this strain; but such a style of\r\nconversation, garnished with grave and solemn words, seemed almost\r\nsacrilegious in the mouth of a man of such ridiculous appearance—a\r\nprofanation at once sad and grotesque. Derues seemed to comprehend the\r\nimpression it produced, and tuning again to Madame Legrand, he said—\r\n\r\n\"We have got a long way from what I came to ask you, my kind friend. I\r\nwas so ill that I went early to bed, but I cannot sleep, and I have no\r\nfire. Would you have the kindness to have this egg mulled for me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cannot your servant do that for you?\" asked Madame Legrand.\r\n\r\n\"I gave her leave to go out this evening, and though it is late she has\r\nnot yet returned. If I had a fire, I would not give you so much trouble,\r\nbut I do not care to light one at this hour. You know I am always afraid\r\nof accidents, and they so easily happen!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then,\" replied Madame Legrand; \"go back to your room, and my\r\nservant will bring it to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Derues, bowing,—\"many thanks.\"\r\n\r\nAs he turned to depart, Madame Legrand spoke again.\r\n\r\n\"This day week, Derues, you have to pay me half the twelve hundred\r\nlivres due for the purchase of my business.\"\r\n\r\n\"So soon as that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, and I want the money. Have you forgotten the date, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh dear, I have never looked at the agreement since it was drawn up. I\r\ndid not think the time was so near, it is the fault of my bad memory;\r\nbut I will contrive to pay you, although trade is very bad, and in three\r\ndays I shall have to pay more than fifteen thousand livres to different\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\nHe bowed again and departed, apparently exhausted by the effort of\r\nsustaining so long a conversation.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were alone, the abbe exclaimed—\r\n\r\n\"That man is assuredly an utter rascal! May God forgive him his\r\nhypocrisy! How is it possible we could allow him to deceive us for so\r\nlong?\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my father,\" interposed one of the visitors, \"are you really sure\r\nof what you have just said?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not now speaking of the seventy-nine Louis d’or which have been\r\nstolen from me, although I never mentioned to anyone but you, and he was\r\nthen present, that I possessed such a sum, and although that very day he\r\nmade a false excuse for coming to my rooms when I was out. Theft is\r\nindeed infamous, but slander is not less so, and he has slandered you\r\ndisgracefully. Yes, he has spread a report that you, Madame Legrand,\r\nyou, his former mistress and benefactress, have put temptation in his\r\nway, and desired to commit carnal sin with him. This is now whispered\r\nthe neighbourhood all round us, it will soon be said aloud, and we have\r\nbeen so completely his dupes, we have helped him so much to acquire a\r\nreputation for uprightness, that it would now be impossible to destroy\r\nour own work; if I were to accuse him of theft, and you charged him with\r\nlying, probably neither of us would be believed. Beware, these odious\r\ntales have not been spread without a reason. Now that your eyes are\r\nopen, beware of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Madame Legrand, \"my brother-in-law warned me three years\r\nago. One day Derues said to my sister-in-law,—I remember the words\r\nperfectly,—’I should like to be a druggist, because one would always be\r\nable to punish an enemy; and if one has a quarrel with anyone it would\r\nbe easy to get rid of him by means of a poisoned draught.’ I neglected\r\nthese warnings. I surmounted the feeling of repugnance I first felt at\r\nthe sight of him; I have responded to his advances, and I greatly fear I\r\nmay have cause to repent it. But you know him as well as I do, who would\r\nnot have thought his piety sincere?—who would not still think so? And\r\nnotwithstanding all you have said, I still hesitate to feel serious\r\nalarm; I am unwilling to believe in such utter depravity.\"\r\n\r\nThe conversation continued in this strain for some time, and then, as it\r\nwas getting late, the party separated.\r\n\r\nNext morning early, a large and noisy crowd was assembled in the rue\r\nSaint-Victor before Derues’ shop of drugs and groceries. There was a\r\nconfusion of cross questions, of inquiries which obtained no answer, of\r\nanswers not addressed to the inquiry, a medley of sound, a pell-mell of\r\nunconnected words, of affirmations, contradictions, and interrupted\r\nnarrations. Here, a group listened to an orator who held forth in his\r\nshirt sleeves, a little farther there were disputes, quarrels,\r\nexclamations of \"Poor man!\" \"Such a good fellow!\" \"My poor gossip\r\nDerues!\" \"Good heavens! what will he do now?\" \"Alas! he is quite done\r\nfor; it is to be hoped his creditors will give him time!\" Above all this\r\nuproar was heard a voice, sharp and piercing like a cat’s, lamenting,\r\nand relating with sobs the terrible misfortune of last night. At about\r\nthree in the morning the inhabitants of the rue St. Victor had been\r\nstartled out of their sleep by the cry of \"Fire, fire!\" A conflagration\r\nhad burst forth in Derues’ cellar, and though its progress had been\r\narrested and the house saved from destruction, all the goods stored\r\ntherein had perished. It apparently meant a considerable loss in barrels\r\nof oil, casks of brandy, boxes of soap, etc., which Derues estimated at\r\nnot less than nine thousand livres.\r\n\r\nBy what unlucky chance the fire had been caused he had no idea. He\r\nrecounted his visit to Madame Legrand, and pale, trembling, hardly able\r\nto sustain himself, he cried—\r\n\r\n\"I shall die of grief! A poor man as ill as I am! I am lost! I am\r\nruined!\"\r\n\r\nA harsh voice interrupted his lamentations, and drew the attention of\r\nthe crowd to a woman carrying printed broadsides, and who forced a\r\npassage through the crowd up to the shop door. She unfolded one of her\r\nsheets, and cried as loudly and distinctly as her husky voice permitted—\r\n\r\n\"Sentence pronounced by the Parliament of Paris against John Robert\r\nCassel, accused and convicted of Fraudulent Bankruptcy!\"\r\n\r\nDerues looked up and saw a street-hawker who used to come to his shop\r\nfor a drink, and with whom he had had a violent quarrel about a month\r\npreviously, she having detected him in a piece of knavery, and abused\r\nhim roundly in her own style, which was not lacking in energy. He had\r\nnot seen her since. The crowd generally, and all the gossips of the\r\nquarter, who held Derues in great veneration, thought that the woman’s\r\ncry was intended as an indirect insult, and threatened to punish her for\r\nthis irreverence. But, placing one hand on her hip, and with the other\r\nwarning off the most pressing by a significant gesture—\r\n\r\n\"Are you still befooled by his tricks, fools that you are? Yes, no doubt\r\nthere was a fire in the cellar last night, no doubt his creditors will\r\nbe geese enough to let him off paying his debts! But what you don’t know\r\nis, that he didn’t really lose by it at all!\"\r\n\r\n\"He lost all his goods!\" the crowd cried on all sides. \"More than nine\r\nthousand livres! Oil and brandy, do you think those won’t burn? The old\r\nwitch, she drinks enough to know! If one put a candle near her she would\r\ntake fire, fast enough!\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" replied the woman, with renewed gesticulations, \"perhaps; but\r\nI don’t advise any of you to try. Anyhow, this fellow here is a rogue;\r\nhe has been emptying his cellar for the last three nights; there were\r\nonly old empty casks in it and empty packing-cases! Oh yes! I have\r\nswallowed his daily lies like everybody else, but I know the truth by\r\nnow. He got his liquor taken away by Michael Lambourne’s son, the\r\ncobbler in the rue de la Parcheminerie. How do I know? Why, because the\r\nyoung man came and told me!\"\r\n\r\n\"I turned that woman out of my shop a month ago, for stealing,\" said\r\nDerues.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this retaliatory accusation, the woman’s bold assertion\r\nmight have changed the attitude of the crowd and chilled the enthusiasm,\r\nbut at that moment a stout man pressed forward, and seizing the hawker\r\nby the arm, said—\r\n\r\n\"Go, and hold your tongue, backbiting woman!\"\r\n\r\nTo this man, the honour of Derues was an article of faith; he had not\r\nyet ceased to wonder at the probity of this sainted person, and to doubt\r\nit in the least was as good as suspecting his own.\r\n\r\n\"My dear friend,\" he said, \"we all know what to think of you. I know you\r\nwell. Send to me tomorrow, and you shall have what goods you want, on\r\ncredit, for as long as is necessary. Now, evil tongue, what do you say\r\nto that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I say that you are as great a fool as the rest. Adieu, friend Derues;\r\ngo on as you have begun, and I shall be selling your ’sentence’ some\r\nday\"; and dispersing the crowd with a few twirls of her right arm, she\r\npassed on, crying—\r\n\r\n\"Sentence pronounced by the Parliament of Paris against John Robert\r\nCassel, accused and convicted of Fraudulent Bankruptcy!\"\r\n\r\nThis accusation emanated from too insignificant a quarter to have any\r\neffect on Derues’ reputation. However resentful he may have been at the\r\ntime, he got over it in consequence of the reiterated marks of interest\r\nshown by his neighbours and all the quarter on account of his supposed\r\nruin, and the hawker’s attack passed out of his mind, or probably she\r\nmight have paid for her boldness with her life.\r\n\r\nBut this drunken woman had none the less uttered a prophetic word; it\r\nwas the grain of sand on which, later, he was to be shipwrecked.\r\n\r\n\"All passions,\" says La Bruyere,—\"all passions are deceitful; they\r\ndisguise themselves as much as possible from the public eye; they hide\r\nfrom themselves. There is no vice which has not a counterfeit\r\nresemblance to some virtue, and which does not profit by it.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole life of Derues bears testimony to the truth of this\r\nobservation. An avaricious poisoner, he attracted his victims by the\r\npretence of fervent and devoted piety, and drew them into the snare\r\nwhere he silently destroyed them. His terrible celebrity only began in\r\n1777, caused by the double murder of Madame de Lamotte and her son, and\r\nhis name, unlike those of some other great criminals, does not at first\r\nrecall a long series of crimes, but when one examines this low, crooked,\r\nand obscure life, one finds a fresh stain at every step, and perhaps no\r\none has ever surpassed him in dissimulation, in profound hypocrisy, in\r\nindefatigable depravity. Derues was executed at thirty-two, and his\r\nwhole life was steeped in vice; though happily so short, it is full of\r\nhorror, and is only a tissue of criminal thoughts and deeds, a very\r\nessence of evil. He had no hesitation, no remorse, no repose, no\r\nrelaxation; he seemed compelled to lie, to steal, to poison!\r\nOccasionally suspicion is aroused, the public has its doubts, and vague\r\nrumours hover round him; but he burrows under new impostures, and\r\npunishment passes by. When he falls into the hands of human justice his\r\nreputation protects him, and for a few days more the legal sword is\r\nturned aside. Hypocrisy is so completely a part of his nature, that even\r\nwhen there is no longer any hope, when he is irrevocably sentenced, and\r\nhe knows that he can no longer deceive anyone, neither mankind nor Him\r\nwhose name he profanes by this last sacrilege, he yet exclaims, \"O\r\nChrist! I shall suffer even as Thou.\" It is only by the light of his\r\nfuneral pyre that the dark places of his life can be examined, that this\r\nbloody plot is unravelled, and that other victims, forgotten and lost in\r\nthe shadows, arise like spectres at the foot of the scaffold, and escort\r\nthe assassin to his doom.\r\n\r\nLet us trace rapidly the history of Derues’ early years, effaced and\r\nforgotten in the notoriety of his death. These few pages are not written\r\nfor the glorification of crime, and if in our own days, as a result of\r\nthe corruption of our manners, and of a deplorable confusion of all\r\nnotions of right and wrong, it has been sought to make him an object; of\r\npublic interest, we, on our part, only wish to bring him into notice,\r\nand place him momentarily on a pedestal, in order to cast him still\r\nlower, that his fall may be yet greater. What has been permitted by God\r\nmay be related by man. Decaying and satiated communities need not be\r\ntreated as children; they require neither diplomatic handling nor\r\nprecaution, and it may be good that they should see and touch the\r\nputrescent sores which canker them. Why fear to mention that which\r\neveryone knows? Why dread to sound the abyss which can be measured by\r\neveryone? Why fear to bring into the light of day unmasked wickedness,\r\neven though it confronts the public gaze unblushingly? Extreme turpitude\r\nand extreme excellence are both in the schemes of Providence; and the\r\npoet has summed up eternal morality for all ages and nations in this\r\nsublime exclamation:\r\n\r\n    \"Abstulit hunc tandem Rufini poem tumultum.\"\r\n\r\nBesides, and we cannot insist too earnestly that our intention must not\r\nbe mistaken, if we had wished to inspire any other sentiment than that\r\nof horror, we should have chosen a more imposing personage from the\r\nannals of crime. There have been deeds which required audacity, a sort\r\nof grandeur, a false heroism; there have been criminals who held in\r\ncheck all the regular and legitimate forces of society, and whom one\r\nregarded with a mixture of terror and pity. There is nothing of that in\r\nDerues, not even a trace of courage; nothing but a shameless cupidity,\r\nexercising itself at first in the theft of a few pence filched from the\r\npoor; nothing but the illicit gains and rascalities of a cheating\r\nshopkeeper and vile money-lender, a depraved cowardice which dared not\r\nstrike openly, but slew in the dark. It is the story of an unclean\r\nreptile which drags itself underground, leaving everywhere the trail of\r\nits poisonous saliva.\r\n\r\nSuch was the man whose life we have undertaken to narrate, a man who\r\nrepresents a complete type of wickedness, and who corresponds to the\r\nmost hideous sketch ever devised by poet or romance-writer: Facts\r\nwithout importance of their own, which would be childish if recorded of\r\nanyone else, obtain a sombre reflection from other facts which precede\r\nthem, and thenceforth cannot be passed over in silence. The historian is\r\nobliged to collect and note them, as showing the logical development of\r\nthis degraded being: he unites them in sequence, and counts the\r\nsuccessive steps of the ladder mounted by the criminal.\r\n\r\nWe have seen the early exploit of this assassin by instinct; we find\r\nhim, twenty years later, an incendiary and a fraudulent bankrupt. What\r\nhad happened in the interval? With how much treachery and crime had he\r\nfilled this space of twenty years? Let us return to his infancy.\r\n\r\nHis unconquerable taste for theft caused him to be expelled by the\r\nrelations who had taken charge of him. An anecdote is told which shows\r\nhis impudence and incurable perversity. One day he was caught taking\r\nsome money, and was soundly whipped by his cousins. When this was over,\r\nthe child, instead of showing any sorrow or asking forgiveness, ran away\r\nwith a sneer, and seeing they were out of breath, exclaimed—\r\n\r\n\"You are tired, are you? Well, I am not!\"\r\n\r\nDespairing of any control over this evil disposition, the relations\r\nrefused to keep him, and sent him to Chartres, where two other cousins\r\nagreed to have him, out of charity. They were simpleminded women, of\r\ngreat and sincere piety, who imagined that good example and religious\r\nteaching might have a happy influence on their young relation. The\r\nresult was contrary to their expectation: the sole fruit of their\r\nteaching was that Derues learnt to be a cheat and a hypocrite, and to\r\nassume the mask of respectability.\r\n\r\nHere also repeated thefts insured him sound corrections. Knowing his\r\ncousins’ extreme economy, not to say avarice, he mocked them when they\r\nbroke a lath over his shoulders: \"There now, I am so glad; that will\r\ncost you two farthings!\"\r\n\r\nHis benefactresses’ patience becoming exhausted, he left their house,\r\nand was apprenticed to a tinman at Chartres. His master died, and an\r\nironmonger of the same town took him as shop-boy, and from this he\r\npassed on to a druggist and grocer. Until now, although fifteen years\r\nold, he had shown no preference for one trade more than another, but it\r\nwas now necessary he should choose some profession, and his share in the\r\nfamily property amounted to the modest sum of three thousand five\r\nhundred livres. His residence with this last master revealed a decided\r\ntaste, but it was only another evil instinct developing itself: the\r\npoisoner had scented poison, being always surrounded with drugs which\r\nwere health-giving or hurtful, according to the use made of them. Derues\r\nwould probably have settled at Chartres, but repeated thefts obliged him\r\nto leave the town. The profession of druggist and grocer being one which\r\npresented most chances of fortune, and being, moreover, adapted to his\r\ntastes, his family apprenticed him to a grocer in the rue Comtesse\r\nd’Artois, paying a specified premium for him.\r\n\r\nDerues arrived in Paris in 1760. It was a new horizon, where he was\r\nunknown; no suspicion attached to him, and he felt much at his ease.\r\nLost in the noise and the crowd of this immense receptacle for every\r\nvice, he had time to found on hypocrisy his reputation as an honest man.\r\nWhen his apprenticeship expired, his master proposed to place him with\r\nhis sister-in-law, who kept a similar establishment in the rue St.\r\nVictor, and who had been a widow for several years. He recommended\r\nDerues as a young man whose zeal and intelligence might be useful in her\r\nbusiness, being ignorant of various embezzlements committed by his late\r\napprentice, who was always clever enough to cast suspicion on others.\r\nBut the negotiation nearly fell through, because, one day, Derues so far\r\nforgot his usual prudence and dissimulation as to allow himself to make\r\nthe observation recorded above to his mistress. She, horrified, ordered\r\nhim to be silent, and threatened to ask her husband to dismiss him. It\r\nrequired a double amount of hypocrisy to remove this unfavourable\r\nimpression; but he spared no pains to obtain the confidence of the\r\nsister-in-law, who was much influenced in his favour. Every day he\r\ninquired what could be done for her, every evening he took a basket-load\r\nof the goods she required from the rue Comtesse d’Artois; and it excited\r\nthe pity of all beholders to see this weakly young man, panting and\r\nsweating under his heavy burden, refusing any reward, and labouring\r\nmerely for the pleasure of obliging, and from natural kindness of heart!\r\nThe poor widow, whose spoils he was already coveting, was completely\r\nduped. She rejected the advice of her brother-in-law, and only listened\r\nto the concert of praises sung by neighbours much edified by Derues’\r\nconduct, and touched by the interest he appeared to show her. Often he\r\nfound occasion to speak of her, always with the liveliest expressions of\r\nboundless devotion. These remarks were repeated to the good woman, and\r\nseemed all the more sincere to her as they appeared to have been made\r\nquite casually, and she never suspected they were carefully calculated\r\nand thought out long before.\r\n\r\nDerues carried dishonesty as far as possible, but he knew how to stop\r\nwhen suspicion was likely to be aroused, and though always planning\r\neither to deceive or to hurt, he was never taken by surprise. Like the\r\nspider which spreads the threads of her web all round her, he concealed\r\nhimself in a net of falsehood which one had to traverse before arriving\r\nat his real nature. The evil destiny of this poor woman, mother of four\r\nchildren, caused her to engage him as her shopman in the year 1767,\r\nthereby signing the warrant for her own ruin.\r\n\r\nDerues began life under his new mistress with a master-stroke. His\r\nexemplary piety was the talk of the whole quarter, and his first care\r\nhad been to request Madame Legrand to recommend him a confessor. She\r\nsent him to the director of her late husband, Pere Cartault, of the\r\nCarmelite order, who, astonished at the devotion of his penitent, never\r\nfailed, if he passed the shop, to enter and congratulate Madame Legrand\r\non the excellent acquisition she had made in securing this young man,\r\nwho would certainly bring her a blessing along with him. Derues affected\r\nthe greatest modesty, and blushed at these praises, and often, when he\r\nsaw the good father approaching, appeared not to see him, and found\r\nsomething to do elsewhere; whereby the field was left clear for his too\r\ncredulous panegyrists.\r\n\r\nBut Pere Cartault appeared too indulgent, and Derues feared that his\r\nsins were too easily pardoned; and he dared not find peace in an\r\nabsolution which was never refused. Therefore, before the year was out,\r\nhe chose a second confessor, Pere Denys, a Franciscan, consulting both\r\nalternately, and confiding his conscientious scruples to them. Every\r\npenance appeared too easy, and he added to those enjoined by his\r\ndirectors continual mortifications of his own devising, so that even\r\nTartufe himself would have owned his superiority.\r\n\r\nHe wore about him two shrouds, to which were fastened relics of Madame\r\nde Chantal, also a medal of St. Francois de Saps, and occasionally\r\nscourged himself. His mistress related that he had begged her to take a\r\nsitting at the church of St. Nicholas, in order that he might more\r\neasily attend service when he had a day out, and had brought her a small\r\nsum which he had saved, to pay half the expense.\r\n\r\nMoreover, he had slept upon straw during the whole of Lent, and took\r\ncare that Madame Legrand heard of this through the servant, pretending\r\nat first to hide it as if it were something wrong. He tried to prevent\r\nthe maid from going into his room, and when she found out the straw he\r\nforbade her to mention it—which naturally made her more anxious to\r\nrelate her discovery. Such a piece of piety, combined with such\r\nmeritorious humility, such dread of publicity, could only increase the\r\nexcellent opinion which everyone already had of him.\r\n\r\nEvery day was marked by some fresh hypocrisy. One of his sisters, a\r\nnovice in the convent of the Ladies of the Visitation of the Virgin, was\r\nto take the veil at Easter. Derues obtained permission to be present at\r\nthe ceremony, and was to start on foot on Good Friday. When he departed,\r\nthe shop happened to be full of people, and the gossips of the\r\nneighbourhood inquired where he was going. Madame Legrand desired him to\r\nhave a glass of liqueur (wine he never touched) and something to eat\r\nbefore starting.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, madame!\" he exclaimed, \"do you think I could eat on a day like\r\nthis, the day on which Christ was crucified! I will take a piece of\r\nbread with me, but I shall only eat it at the inn where I intend to\r\nsleep: I mean to fast the whole way.\"\r\n\r\nBut this kind of thing was not sufficient. He wanted an opportunity to\r\nestablish a reputation for honesty on a firm basis. Chance provided one,\r\nand he seized it immediately, although at the expense of a member of his\r\nown family.\r\n\r\nOne of his brothers, who kept a public-house at Chartres, came to see\r\nhim. Derues, under pretence of showing him the sights of Paris, which he\r\ndid not know, asked his mistress to allow him to take in the brother for\r\na few days, which she granted. The last evening of his stay, Derues went\r\nup to his room, broke open the box which contained his clothes, turned\r\nover everything it contained, examined the clothes, and discovering two\r\nnew cotton nightcaps, raised a cry which brought up the household. His\r\nbrother just then returned, and Derues called him an infamous thief,\r\ndeclaring that he had stolen the money for these new articles out of the\r\nshop the evening before. His brother defended himself, protesting his\r\ninnocence, and, indignant at such incomprehensible treachery,\r\nendeavoured to turn the tables by relating some of Antoine’s early\r\nmisdeeds. The latter, however, stopped him, by declaring on his honour\r\nthat he had seen his brother the evening before go to the till, slip his\r\nhand in, and take out some money. The brother was confounded and\r\nsilenced by so audacious a lie; he hesitated, stammered, and was turned\r\nout of the house. Derues worthily crowned this piece of iniquity by\r\nobliging his mistress to accept the restitution of the stolen money. It\r\ncost him three livres, twelve sous, but the interest it brought him was\r\nthe power of stealing unsuspected. That evening he spent in prayer for\r\nthe pardon of his brother’s supposed guilt.\r\n\r\nAll these schemes had succeeded, and brought him nearer to the desired\r\ngoal, for not a soul in the quarter ventured to doubt the word of this\r\nsaintly individual. His fawning manners and insinuating language varied\r\naccording to the people addressed. He adapted himself to all,\r\ncontradicting no one, and, while austere himself, he flattered the\r\ntastes of others. In the various houses where he visited his\r\nconversation was serious, grave, and sententious; and, as we have seen,\r\nhe could quote Scripture with the readiness of a theologian. In the\r\nshop, when he had to deal with the lower classes, he showed himself\r\nacquainted with their modes of expression, and spoke the Billingsgate of\r\nthe market-women, which he had acquired in the rue Comtesse d’Artois,\r\ntreating them familiarly, and they generally addressed him as \"gossip\r\nDerues.\" By his own account he easily judged the characters of the\r\nvarious people with whom he came in contact.\r\n\r\nHowever, Pere Cartault’s prophecy was not fulfilled: the blessing of\r\nHeaven did not descend on the Legrand establishment. There seemed to be\r\na succession of misfortunes which all Derues’ zeal and care as shopman\r\ncould neither prevent nor repair. He by no means contented himself with\r\nparading an idle and fruitless hypocrisy, and his most abominable\r\ndeceptions were not those displayed in the light of day. He watched by\r\nnight: his singular organisation, outside the ordinary laws of nature,\r\nappeared able to dispense with sleep. Gliding about on tiptoe, opening\r\ndoors noiselessly, with all the skill of an accomplished thief, he\r\npillaged shop and cellar, and sold his plunder in remote parts of the\r\ntown under assumed names. It is difficult to understand how his strength\r\nsupported the fatigue of this double existence; he had barely arrived at\r\npuberty, and art had been obliged to assist the retarded development of\r\nnature. But he lived only for evil, and the Spirit of Evil supplied the\r\nphysical vigour which was wanting. An insane love of money (the only\r\npassion he knew) brought him by degrees back to his starting-point of\r\ncrime; he concealed it in hiding-places wrought in the thick walls, in\r\nholes dug out by his nails. As soon as he got any, he brought it exactly\r\nas a wild beast brings a piece of bleeding flesh to his lair; and often,\r\nby the glimmer of a dark lantern, kneeling in adoration before this\r\nshameful idol, his eyes sparkling with ferocious joy, with a smile which\r\nsuggested a hyena’s delight over its prey, he would contemplate his\r\nmoney, counting and kissing it.\r\n\r\nThese continual thefts brought trouble into the Legrand affairs,\r\ncancelled all profits, and slowly brought on ruin. The widow had no\r\nsuspicion of Derues’ disgraceful dealings, and he carefully referred the\r\ndamage to other causes, quite worthy of himself. Sometimes it was a\r\nbottle of oil, or of brandy, or some other commodity, which was found\r\nspilt, broken, or damaged, which accidents he attributed to the enormous\r\nquantity of rats which infested the cellar and the house. At length,\r\nunable to meet her engagements, Madame Legrand made the business over to\r\nhim in February, 1770. He was then twenty-five years and six months old,\r\nand was accepted as a merchant grocer in August the same year. By an\r\nagreement drawn up between them, Derues undertook to pay twelve hundred\r\nlivres for the goodwill, and to lodge her rent free during the remainder\r\nof her lease, which had still nine years to run. Being thus obliged to\r\ngive up business to escape bankruptcy, Madame Legrand surrendered to her\r\ncreditors any goods remaining in her warehouse; and Derues easily made\r\narrangements to take them over very cheaply. The first step thus made,\r\nhe was now able to enrich himself safely and to defraud with impunity\r\nunder the cover of his stolen reputation.\r\n\r\nOne of his uncles, a flour merchant at Chartres, came habitually twice a\r\nyear to Paris to settle accounts with his correspondents. A sum of\r\ntwelve hundred francs, locked up in a drawer, was stolen from him, and,\r\naccompanied by his nephew, he went to inform the police. On\r\ninvestigation being made, it was found that the chest of drawers had\r\nbeen broken at the top. As at the time of the theft of the seventy-nine\r\nLouis from the abbe, Derues was the only person known to have entered\r\nhis uncle’s room. The innkeeper swore to this, but the uncle took pains\r\nto justify his nephew, and showed his confidence shortly after by\r\nbecoming surety for him to the extent of five thousand livres. Derues\r\nfailed to pay when the time expired, and the holder of the note was\r\nobliged to sue the surety for it.\r\n\r\nHe made use of any means, even the most impudent, which enabled him to\r\nappropriate other people’s property. A provincial grocer on one occasion\r\nsent him a thousand-weight of honey in barrels to be sold on commission.\r\nTwo or three months passed, and he asked for an account of the sale.\r\nDerues replied that he had not yet been able to dispose of it\r\nadvantageously, and there ensued a fresh delay, followed by the same\r\nquestion and the same reply. At length, when more than a year had\r\npassed, the grocer came to Paris, examined his barrels, and found that\r\nfive hundred pounds were missing. He claimed damages from Derues, who\r\ndeclared he had never received any more, and as the honey had been sent\r\nin confidence, and there was no contract and no receipt to show, the\r\nprovincial tradesman could not obtain compensation.\r\n\r\nAs though having risen by the ruin of Madame Legrand and her four\r\nchildren was not enough, Derues grudged even the morsel of bread he had\r\nbeen obliged to leave her. A few days after the fire in the cellar,\r\nwhich enabled him to go through a second bankruptcy, Madame Legrand, now\r\nundeceived and not believing his lamentations, demanded the money due to\r\nher, according to their agreement. Derues pretended to look for his copy\r\nof the contract, and could not find it. \"Give me yours, madame,\" said\r\nhe; \"we will write the receipt upon it. Here is the money.\"\r\n\r\nThe widow opened her purse and took out her copy; Derues snatched it,\r\nand tore it up. \"Now,\" he exclaimed, \"you are paid; I owe you nothing\r\nnow. If you like, I will declare it on oath in court, and no one will\r\ndisbelieve my word.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wretched man,\" said the unfortunate widow, \"may God forgive your soul;\r\nbut your body will assuredly end on the gallows!\"\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that she complained, and told of this abominable swindle;\r\nDerues had been beforehand with her, and the slander he had disseminated\r\nbore its fruits. It was said that his old mistress was endeavouring by\r\nan odious falsehood to destroy the reputation of a man who had refused\r\nto be her lover. Although reduced to poverty, she left the house where\r\nshe had a right to remain rent free, preferring the hardest and\r\ndreariest life to the torture of remaining under the same roof with the\r\nman who had caused her ruin.\r\n\r\nWe might relate a hundred other pieces of knavery, but it must not be\r\nsupposed that having begun by murder, Derues would draw back and remain\r\ncontented with theft. Two fraudulent bankruptcies would have sufficed\r\nfor most people; for him they were merely a harmless pastime. Here we\r\nmust place two dark and obscure stories, two crimes of which he is\r\naccused, two victims whose death groans no one heard.\r\n\r\nThe hypocrite’s excellent reputation had crossed the Parisian bounds. A\r\nyoung man from the country, intending to start as a grocer in the\r\ncapital, applied to Derues for the necessary information and begged for\r\nadvice. He arrived at the latter’s house with a sum of eight thousand\r\nlivres, which he placed in Derues’ hands, asking him for assistance in\r\nfinding a business. The sight of gold was enough to rouse the instinct\r\nof crime in Derues, and the witches who hailed Macbeth with the promise\r\nof royalty did not rouse the latter’s ambitious desires to a greater\r\nheight than the chance of wealth did the greed of the assassin; whose\r\nhands, once closed over the eight thousand livres, were never again\r\nrelaxed. He received them as a deposit, and hid them along with his\r\nprevious plunder, vowing never to return them. Several days had elapsed,\r\nwhen one afternoon Derues returned home with an air of such unusual\r\ncheerfulness that the young man questioned him. \"Have you heard some\r\ngood news for me?\" he asked, \"or have you had some luck yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"My young friend,\" answered Derues, \"as for me, success depends on my\r\nown efforts, and fortune smiles on me. But I have promised to be useful\r\nto you, your parents have trusted me, and I must prove that their\r\nconfidence is well founded. I have heard to-day of a business for\r\ndisposal in one of the best parts of Paris. You can have it for twelve\r\nthousand livres, and I wish I could lend you the amount you want. But\r\nyou must write to your father, persuade him, reason with him; do not\r\nlose so good a chance. He must make a little sacrifice, and he will be\r\ngrateful to me later.\"\r\n\r\nIn accordance with their son’s request, the young man’s parents\r\ndespatched a sum of four thousand livres, requesting Derues to lose no\r\ntime in concluding the purchase.\r\n\r\nThree weeks later, the father, very uneasy, arrived in Paris. He came to\r\ninquire about his son, having heard nothing from him. Derues received\r\nhim with the utmost astonishment, appearing convinced that the young man\r\nhad returned home. One day, he said, the youth informed him that he had\r\nheard from his father, who had given up all idea of establishing him in\r\nParis, having arranged an advantageous marriage for him near home; and\r\nhe had taken his twelve thousand livres, for which Derues produced a\r\nreceipt, and started on his return journey.\r\n\r\nOne evening, when nearly dark, Derues had gone out with his guest, who\r\ncomplained of headache and internal pains. Where did they go? No one\r\nknew; but Denies only returned at daybreak, alone, weary and exhausted,\r\nand the young man was never again heard of.\r\n\r\nOne of his apprentices was the constant object of reproof. The boy was\r\naccused of negligence, wasting his time, of spending three hours over a\r\ntask which might have been done in less than one. When Derues had\r\nconvinced the father, a Parisian bourgeois, that his son was a bad boy\r\nand a good-for-nothing, he came to this man one day in a state of wild\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n\"Your son,\" he said, \"ran away yesterday with six hundred livres, with\r\nwhich I had to meet a bill to-day. He knew where I kept this money, and\r\nhas taken it.\"\r\n\r\nHe threatened to go before a magistrate and denounce the thief, and was\r\nonly appeased by being paid the sum he claimed to have lost. But he had\r\ngone out with the lad the evening before, and returned alone in the\r\nearly hours of the morning.\r\n\r\nHowever, the veil which concealed the truth was becoming more and more\r\ntransparent every day. Three bankruptcies had diminished the\r\nconsideration he enjoyed, and people began to listen to complaints and\r\naccusations which till now had been considered mere inventions designed\r\nto injure him. Another attempt at trickery made him feel it desirable to\r\nleave the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nHe had rented a house close to his own, the shop of which had been\r\ntenanted for seven or eight years by a wine merchant. He required from\r\nthis man, if he wished to remain where he was, a sum of six hundred\r\nlivres as a payment for goodwill. Although the wine merchant considered\r\nit an exorbitant charge, yet on reflection he decided to pay it rather\r\nthan go, having established a good business on these premises, as was\r\nwell known. Before long a still more arrant piece of dishonesty gave him\r\nan opportunity for revenge. A young man of good family, who was boarding\r\nwith him in order to gain some business experience, having gone into\r\nDerues’ shop to make some purchases, amused himself while waiting by\r\nidly writing his name on a piece of blank paper lying on the counter;\r\nwhich he left there without thinking more about it. Derues, knowing the\r\nyoung man had means, as soon as he had gone, converted the signed paper\r\ninto a promissory note for two thousand livres, to his order, payable at\r\nthe majority of the signer. The bill, negotiated in trade, arrived when\r\ndue at the wine merchant’s, who, much surprised, called his young\r\nboarder and showed him the paper adorned with his signature. The youth\r\nwas utterly confounded, having no knowledge of the bill whatever, but\r\nnevertheless could not deny his signature. On examining the paper\r\ncarefully, the handwriting was recognised as Derues’. The wine merchant\r\nsent for him, and when he arrived, made him enter a room, and having\r\nlocked the door, produced the promissory note. Derues acknowledged\r\nhaving written it, and tried various falsehoods to excuse himself. No\r\none listened to him, and the merchant threatened to place the matter in\r\nthe hands of the police. Then Derues wept, implored, fell on his knees,\r\nacknowledged his guilt, and begged for mercy. He agreed to restore the\r\nsix hundred livres exacted from the wine merchant, on condition that he\r\nshould see the note destroyed and that the matter should end there. He\r\nwas then about to be married, and dreaded a scandal.\r\n\r\nShortly after, he married Marie-Louise Nicolais; daughter of a\r\nharness-maker at Melun.\r\n\r\nOne’s first impression in considering this marriage is one of profound\r\nsorrow and utmost pity for the young girl whose destiny was linked with\r\nthat of this monster. One thinks of the horrible future; of youth and\r\ninnocence blighted by the tainting breath of the homicide; of candour\r\nunited to hypocrisy; of virtue to wickedness; of legitimate desires\r\nlinked to disgraceful passions; of purity mixed with corruption. The\r\nthought of these contrasts is revolting, and one pities such a dreadful\r\nfate. But we must not decide hastily. Madame Derues has not been\r\nconvicted of any active part in her husband’s later crimes, but her\r\nhistory, combined with his, shows no trace of suffering, nor of any\r\nrevolt against a terrible complicity. In her case the evidence is\r\ndoubtful, and public opinion must decide later.\r\n\r\nIn 1773, Derues relinquished retail business, and left the Saint Victor\r\nneighbourhood, having taken an apartment in the rue des Deux Boules,\r\nnear the rue Bertin-Poiree, in the parish of St. Germain l’Auxerrois,\r\nwhere he had been married. He first acted on commission for the\r\nBenedictine-Camalduian fathers of the forest of Senart, who had heard of\r\nhim as a man wholly given to piety; then, giving himself up to usury, he\r\nundertook what is known as \"business affairs,\" a profession which, in\r\nsuch hands, could not fail to be lucrative, being aided by his exemplary\r\nmorals and honest appearance. It was the more easy for him to impose on\r\nothers, as he could not be accused of any of the deadly vices which so\r\noften end in ruin—gaming, wine, and women. Until now he had displayed\r\nonly one passion, that of avarice, but now another developed itself,\r\nthat of ambition. He bought houses and land, and when the money was due,\r\nallowed himself to be sued for it; he bought even lawsuits, which he\r\nmuddled with all the skill of a rascally attorney. Experienced in\r\nbankruptcy, he undertook the management of failures, contriving to make\r\ndishonesty appear in the light of unfortunate virtue. When this demon\r\nwas not occupied with poison, his hands were busy with every social\r\niniquity; he could only live and breathe in an atmosphere of corruption.\r\n\r\nHis wife, who had already presented him with a daughter, gave birth to a\r\nson in February 1774. Derues, in order to better support the airs of\r\ngrandeur and the territorial title which he had assumed, invited persons\r\nof distinction to act as sponsors. The child was baptized Tuesday,\r\nFebruary 15th. We give the text of the baptismal register, as a\r\ncuriosity:—\r\n\r\n\"Antoine-Maximilian-Joseph, son of Antoine-Francois Derues, gentleman,\r\nseigneur of Gendeville, Herchies, Viquemont, and other places, formerly\r\nmerchant grocer; and of Madame Marie-Louise Nicolais, his wife.\r\nGodfathers, T. H. and T. P., lords of, etc. etc. Godmothers, Madame M.\r\nFr. C. D. V., etc. etc.\r\n\r\n\"(Signed)\r\n\r\n  A. F. DERUES, Senior.\"\r\n\r\nBut all this dignity did not exclude the sheriff’s officers, whom, as\r\nbefitted so great a man, he treated with the utmost insolence,\r\noverwhelming them with abuse when they came to enforce an execution.\r\nSuch scandals had several times aroused the curiosity of his neighbours,\r\nand did not redound to his credit. His landlord, wearied of all this\r\nclamour, and most especially weary of never getting any rent without a\r\nfight for it, gave him notice to quit. Derues removed to the rue\r\nBeaubourg, where he continued to act as commission agent under the name\r\nof Cyrano Derues de Bury.\r\n\r\nAnd now we will concern ourselves no more with the unravelling of this\r\ntissue of imposition; we will wander no longer in this labyrinth of\r\nfraud, of low and vile intrigue, of dark crime of which the clue\r\ndisappears in the night, and of which the trace is lost in a doubtful\r\nmixture of blood and mire; we will listen no longer to the cry of the\r\nwidow and her four children reduced to beggary, to the groans of obscure\r\nvictims, to the cries of terror and the death-groan which echoed one\r\nnight through the vaults of a country house near Beauvais. Behold other\r\nvictims whose cries are yet louder, behold yet other crimes and a\r\npunishment which equals them in terror! Let these nameless ghosts, these\r\nsilent spectres, lose themselves in the clear daylight which now\r\nappears, and make room for other phantoms which rend their shrouds and\r\nissue from the tomb demanding vengeance.\r\n\r\nDerues was now soon to have a chance of obtaining immortality. Hitherto\r\nhis blows had been struck by chance, henceforth he uses all the\r\nresources of his infernal imagination; he concentrates all his strength\r\non one point—conceives and executes his crowning piece of wickedness. He\r\nemploys for two years all his science as cheat, forger, and poisoner in\r\nextending the net which was to entangle a whole family; and, taken in\r\nhis own snare, he struggles in vain; in vain does he seek to gnaw\r\nthrough the meshes which confine him. The foot placed on the last rung\r\nof this ladder of crime, stands also on the first step by which he\r\nmounts the scaffold.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile from Villeneuve-le-Roi-les-Sens, there stood in 1775 a\r\nhandsome house, overlooking the windings of the Yonne on one side, and\r\non the other a garden and park belonging to the estate of Buisson-Souef.\r\nIt was a large property, admirably situated, and containing productive\r\nfields, wood, and water; but not everywhere kept in good order, and\r\nshowing something of the embarrassed fortune of its owner. During some\r\nyears the only repairs had been those necessary in the house itself and\r\nits immediate vicinity. Here and there pieces of dilapidated wall\r\nthreatened to fall altogether, and enormous stems of ivy had invaded and\r\nstifled vigorous trees; in the remoter portions of the park briers\r\nbarred the road and made walking almost impossible. This disorder was\r\nnot destitute of charm, and at an epoch when landscape gardening\r\nconsisted chiefly in straight alleys, and in giving to nature a cold and\r\nmonotonous symmetry, one’s eye rested with pleasure on these neglected\r\nclumps, on these waters which had taken a different course to that which\r\nart had assigned to them, on these unexpected and picturesque scenes.\r\n\r\nA wide terrace, overlooking the winding river, extended along the front\r\nof the house. Three men were walking on it-two priests, and the owner of\r\nBuisson-Souef, Monsieur de Saint-Faust de Lamotte. One priest was the\r\ncure of Villeneuve-le-Roi-lez-Sens, the other was a Camaldulian monk,\r\nwho had come to see the cure about a clerical matter, and who was\r\nspending some days at the presbytery. The conversation did not appear to\r\nbe lively. Every now and then Monsieur de Lamotte stood still, and,\r\nshading his eyes with his hand from the brilliant sunlight which flooded\r\nthe plain, and was strongly reflected from the water, endeavoured to see\r\nif some new object had not appeared on the horizon, then slowly resumed\r\nhis walk with a movement of uneasy impatience. The tower clock struck\r\nwith a noisy resonance.\r\n\r\n\"Six o’clock already!\" he exclaimed. \"They will assuredly not arrive\r\nto-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why despair?\" said the cure. \"Your servant has gone to meet them; we\r\nmight see their boat any moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my father,\" returned Monsieur de Lamotte, \"the long days are\r\nalready past. In another hour the mist will rise, and then they would\r\nnot venture on the river.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if that happens, we shall have to be patient; they will stay all\r\nnight at some little distance, and you will see them to-morrow morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"My brother is right,\" said the other priest. \"Come, monsieur; do not be\r\nanxious.\"\r\n\r\n\"You both speak with the indifference of persons to whom family troubles\r\nare unknown.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" said the cure, \"do you really think that because our sacred\r\nprofession condemns us both to celibacy, we are therefore unable to\r\ncomprehend an affection such as yours, on which I myself pronounced the\r\nhallowing benediction of the Church—if you remember—nearly fifteen years\r\nago?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it perhaps intentionally, my father, that you recall the date of my\r\nmarriage? I readily admit that the love of one’s neighbour may enlighten\r\nyou as to another love to which you have yourself been a stranger. I\r\ndaresay it seems odd to you that a man of my age should be anxious about\r\nso little, as though he were a love-sick youth; but for some time past I\r\nhave had presentiments of evil, and I am really becoming superstitious!\"\r\n\r\nHe again stood still, gazing up the river, and, seeing nothing, resumed\r\nhis place between the two priests, who had continued their walk.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he continued, \"I have presentiments which refuse to be shaken\r\noff. I am not so old that age can have weakened my powers and reduced me\r\nto childishness, I cannot even say what I am afraid of, but separation\r\nis painful and causes an involuntary terror. Strange, is it not?\r\nFormerly, I used to leave my wife for months together, when she was\r\nyoung and my son only, an infant; I loved her passionately, yet I could\r\ngo with pleasure. Why, I wonder, is it so different now? Why should a\r\njourney to Paris on business, and a few hours’ delay, make, me so\r\nterribly uneasy? Do you remember, my father,\" he resumed, after a pause,\r\nturning to the cure, \"do you remember how lovely Marie looked on our\r\nwedding-day? Do you remember her dazzling complexion and the innocent\r\ncandour of her expression?—the sure token of the most truthful and\r\npurest of minds! That is why I love her so much now; we do not now sigh\r\nfor one another, but the second love is stronger than the first, for it\r\nis founded on recollection, and is tranquil and confident in friendship\r\n. . . . It is strange that they have not returned; something must have\r\nhappened! If they do not return this evening, and I do not now think it\r\npossible, I shall go to Paris myself to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think;\" said the other priest, \"that at twenty you must indeed have\r\nbeen excitable, a veritable tinder-box, to have retained so much energy!\r\nCome, monsieur, try to calm yourself and have patience: you yourself\r\nadmit it can only be a few hours’ delay.\"\r\n\r\n\"But my son accompanied his mother, and he is our only one, and so\r\ndelicate! He alone remains of our three children, and you do not realise\r\nhow the affection of parents who feel age approaching is concentrated on\r\nan only child! If I lost Edouard I should die!\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose, then, as you let him go, his presence at Paris was\r\nnecessary?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; his mother went to obtain a loan which is needed for the\r\nimprovements required on the estate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, then, did you let him go?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would willingly have kept him here, but his mother wished to take\r\nhim. A separation is as trying to her as to me, and we all but\r\nquarrelled over it. I gave way.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was one way of satisfying all three—you might have gone also.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but Monsieur le cure will tell you that a fortnight ago I was\r\nchained to my arm-chair, swearing under my breath like a pagan, and\r\ncursing the follies of my youth!—Forgive me, my father; I mean that I\r\nhad the gout, and I forgot that I am not the only sufferer, and that it\r\nracks the old age of the philosopher quite as much as that of the\r\ncourtier.\"\r\n\r\nThe fresh wind which often rises just at sunset was already rustling in\r\nthe leaves; long shadows darkened the course of the Yonne and stretched\r\nacross the plain; the water, slightly troubled, reflected a confused\r\noutline of its banks and the clouded blue of the sky. The three\r\ngentlemen stopped at the end of the terrace and gazed into the already\r\nfading distance. A black spot, which they had just observed in the\r\nmiddle of the river, caught a gleam of light in passing a low meadow\r\nbetween two hills, and for a moment took shape as a barge, then was lost\r\nagain, and could not be distinguished from the water. Another moment,\r\nand it reappeared more distinctly; it was indeed a barge, and now the\r\nhorse could be seen towing it against the current. Again it was lost at\r\na bend of the river shaded by willows, and they had to resign themselves\r\nto incertitude for several minutes. Then a white handkerchief was waved\r\non the prow of the boat, and Monsieur de Lamotte uttered a joyful\r\nexclamation.\r\n\r\n\"It is indeed they!\" he cried. \"Do you see them, Monsieur le cure? I see\r\nmy boy; he is waving the handkerchief, and his mother is with him. But I\r\nthink there is a third person—yes, there is a man, is there not? Look\r\nwell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" said the cure, \"if my bad sight does not deceive me, I should\r\nsay there was someone seated near the rudder; but it looks like a\r\nchild.\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably someone from the neighbourhood, who has profited by the chance\r\nof a lift home.\"\r\n\r\nThe boat was advancing rapidly; they could now hear the cracking of the\r\nwhip with which the servant urged on the tow-horse. And now it stopped,\r\nat an easy landing-place, barely fifty paces from the terrace. Madame de\r\nLamotte landed with her son and the stranger, and her husband descended\r\nfrom the terrace to meet her. Long before he arrived at the garden gate,\r\nhis son’s arms were around his neck.\r\n\r\n\"Are you quite well, Edouard ?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, perfectly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite well too. She is behind, in as great a hurry to meet you as I am.\r\nBut she can’t run as I do, and you must go half-way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whom have you brought with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"A gentleman from Paris.\"\r\n\r\n\"From Paris?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, a Monsieur Derues. But mamma will tell you all about that. Here\r\nshe is.\"\r\n\r\nThe cure and the monk arrived just as Monsieur de Lamotte folded his\r\nwife in his arms. Although she had passed her fortieth year, she was\r\nstill beautiful enough to justify her husband’s eulogism. A moderate\r\nplumpness had preserved the freshness and softness of her skin; her\r\nsmile was charming, and her large blue eyes expressed both gentleness\r\nand goodness. Seen beside this smiling and serene countenance, the\r\nappearance of the stranger was downright repulsive, and Monsieur de\r\nLamotte could hardly repress a start of disagreeable surprise at the\r\npitiful and sordid aspect of this diminutive person, who stood apart,\r\nlooking overwhelmed by conscious inferiority. He was still more\r\nastonished when he saw his son take him by the hand with friendly\r\nkindness, and heard him say—\r\n\r\n\"Will you come with me, my friend? We will follow my father and mother.\"\r\n\r\nMadame de Lamotte, having greeted the cure, looked at the monk, who was\r\na stranger to her. A word or two explained matters, and she took her\r\nhusband’s arm, declining to answer any questions until she reached the\r\nlouse, and laughing at his curiosity.\r\n\r\nPierre-Etienne de Saint-Faust de Lamotte, one of the king’s equerries,\r\nseigneur of Grange-Flandre, Valperfond, etc., had married\r\nMarie-Francoise Perier in 1760. Their fortune resembled many others of\r\nthat period: it was more nominal than actual, more showy than solid. Not\r\nthat the husband and wife had any cause for self-reproach, or that their\r\nestates had suffered from dissipation; unstained by the corrupt manners\r\nof the period, their union had been a model of sincere affection, of\r\ndomestic virtue and mutual confidence. Marie-Francoise was quite\r\nbeautiful enough to have made a sensation in society, but she renounced\r\nit of her own accord, in order to devote herself to the duties of a wife\r\nand mother. The only serious grief she and her husband had experienced\r\nwas the loss of two young children. Edouard, though delicate from his\r\nbirth, had nevertheless passed the trying years of infancy and early\r\nadolescence; he was then nearly fourteen. With a sweet and rather\r\neffeminate expression, blue eyes and a pleasant smile, he was a striking\r\nlikeness of his mother. His father’s affection exaggerated the dangers\r\nwhich threatened the boy, and in his eyes the slightest indisposition\r\nbecame a serious malady; his mother shared these fears, and in\r\nconsequence of this anxiety Edouard’s education had been much neglected.\r\nHe had been brought up at Buisson-Souef, and allowed to run wild from\r\nmorning till night, like a young fawn, exercising the vigour and\r\nactivity of its limbs. He had still the simplicity and general ignorance\r\nof a child of nine or ten.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of appearing at court and suitably defraying the expenses\r\nof his office had made great inroads on Monsieur de Lamotte’s fortune.\r\nHe had of late lived at Buisson-Souef in the most complete retirement;\r\nbut notwithstanding this too long deferred attention to his affairs, his\r\nproperty was ruining him, for the place required a large expenditure,\r\nand absorbed a large amount of his income without making any tangible\r\nreturn. He had always hesitated to dispose of the estate on account of\r\nits associations; it was there he had met, courted, and married his\r\nbeloved wife; there that the happy days of their youth had been spent;\r\nthere that they both wished to grow old together.\r\n\r\nSuch was the family to which accident had now introduced Derues. The\r\nunfavourable impression made on Monsieur de Lamotte had not passed\r\nunperceived by him; but, being quite accustomed to the instinctive\r\nrepugnance which his first appearance generally inspired, Derues had\r\nmade a successful study of how to combat and efface this antagonistic\r\nfeeling, and replace it by confidence, using different means according\r\nto the persons he had to deal with. He understood at once that vulgar\r\nmethods would be useless with Monsieur de Lamotte, whose appearance and\r\nmanners indicated both the man of the world and the man of intelligence,\r\nand also he had to consider the two priests, who were both observing him\r\nattentively. Fearing a false step, he assumed the most simple and\r\ninsignificant deportment he could, knowing that sooner or later a third\r\nperson would rehabilitate him in the opinion of those present. Nor did\r\nhe wait long.\r\n\r\nArrived at the drawing-room, Monsieur de Lamotte requested the company\r\nto be seated. Derues acknowledged the courtesy by a bow, and there was a\r\nmoment of silence, while Edouard and his mother looked at each other and\r\nsmiled. The silence was broken by Madame de Lamotte.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Pierre,\" she said, \"you are surprised to see us accompanied by a\r\nstranger, but when you hear what he has done for us you will thank me\r\nfor having induced him to return here with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Allow me,\" interrupted Derues, \"allow me to tell you what happened. The\r\ngratitude which madame imagines she owes me causes her to exaggerate a\r\nsmall service which anybody would have been delighted to render.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, monsieur; let me tell it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let mamma tell the story,\" said Edouard.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, then? What happened?\" said Monsieur de Lamotte.\r\n\r\n\"I am quite ashamed,\" answered Derues; \"but I obey your wishes, madame.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Madame de Lamotte, \"keep your seat, I wish it. Imagine,\r\nPierre, just six days ago, an accident happened to Edouard and me which\r\nmight have had serious consequences.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you never wrote to me, Marie?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should only have made you anxious, and to no purpose. I had some\r\nbusiness in one of the most crowded parts of Paris; I took a chair, and\r\nEdouard walked beside me. In the rue Beaubourg we were suddenly\r\nsurrounded by a mob of low people, who were quarrelling. Carriages\r\nstopped the way, and the horses of one of these took fright in the\r\nconfusion and uproar, and bolted, in spite of the coachman’s endeavours\r\nto keep them in hand. It was a horrible tumult, and I tried to get out\r\nof the chair, but at that moment the chairmen were both knocked down,\r\nand I fell. It is a miracle I was not crushed. I was dragged insensible\r\nfrom under the horses’ feet and carried into the house before which all\r\nthis took place. There, sheltered in a shop and safe from the crowd\r\nwhich encumbered the doorway, I recovered my senses, thanks to the\r\nassistance of Monsieur Derues, who lives there. But that is not all:\r\nwhen I recovered I could not walk, I had been so shaken by the fright,\r\nthe fall, and the danger I had incurred, and I had to accept his offer\r\nof finding me another chair when the crowd should disperse, and\r\nmeanwhile to take shelter in his rooms with his wife, who showed me the\r\nkindest attention.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur—\" said Monsieur de Lamotte, rising. But his wife stopped him.\r\n\r\n\"Wait a moment; I have not finished yet. Monsieur Derues came back in an\r\nhour, and I was then feeling better; but before, I left I was stupid\r\nenough to say that I had been robbed in the confusion; my diamond\r\nearrings, which had belonged to my mother, were gone. You cannot imagine\r\nthe trouble Monsieur Derues took to discover the thief, and all the\r\nappeals he made to the police—I was really ashamed!\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Monsieur de Lamotte did not yet understand what motive, other\r\nthan gratitude, had induced his wife to bring this stranger home with\r\nher, he again rose from his seat, and going to Derues, held out his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\"I understand now the attachment my son shows for you. You are wrong in\r\ntrying to lessen your good deed in order to escape from our gratitude,\r\nMonsieur Derues.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Derues?\" inquired the monk.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know the name, my father?\" asked Madame de Lamotte eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Edouard had already told me,\" said the monk, approaching Derues.\r\n\r\n\"You live in the, rue Beaubourg, and you are Monsieur Derues, formerly a\r\nretail grocer?\"\r\n\r\n\"The same, my brother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Should you require a reference, I can give it. Chance, madame, has made\r\nyou acquainted with a man whose, reputation for piety and honour is well\r\nestablished; he will permit me to add my praises to yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, I do not know how I deserve so much honour.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am, Brother Marchois, of the Camaldulian order. You see that I know\r\nyou well.\"\r\n\r\nThe monk then proceeded to explain that his community had confided their\r\naffairs to Derues’ honesty, he undertaking to dispose of the articles\r\nmanufactured by the monks in their retreat. He then recounted a number\r\nof good actions and of marks of piety, which were heard with pleasure\r\nand admiration by those present. Derues received this cloud of incense\r\nwith an appearance of sincere modesty and humility, which would have\r\ndeceived the most skilful physiognomist.\r\n\r\nWhen the eulogistic warmth of the good brother began to slacken it was\r\nalready nearly dark, and the two priests had barely time to regain the\r\npresbytery without incurring the risk of breaking their necks in the\r\nrough road which led to it. They departed at once, and a room was got\r\nready for Derues.\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow,\" said Madame de Lamotte as they separated, \"you can discuss\r\nwith my husband the business on which you came: to-morrow, or another\r\nday, for I beg that you will make yourself at home here, and the longer\r\nyou will stay the better it will please us.\"\r\n\r\nThe night was a sleepless one for Derues, whose brain was occupied by a\r\nconfusion of criminal plans. The chance which had caused his\r\nacquaintance with Madame de Lamotte, and even more the accident of\r\nBrother Marchois appearing in the nick of time, to enlarge upon the\r\npraises which gave him so excellent a character, seemed like favourable\r\nomens not to be neglected. He began to imagine fresh villanies, to\r\noutline an unheard-of crime, which as yet he could not definitely trace\r\nout; but anyhow there would be plunder to seize and blood to spill, and\r\nthe spirit of murder excited and kept him awake, just as remorse might\r\nhave troubled the repose of another.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Madame de Lamotte, having retired with her husband, was saying\r\nto the latter—\r\n\r\n\"Well, now! what do you think of my protege, or rather, of the protector\r\nwhich Heaven sent me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that physiognomy is often very deceptive, for I should have\r\nbeen quite willing to hang him on the strength of his.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true that his appearance is not attractive, and it led me into a\r\nfoolish mistake which I quickly regretted. When I recovered\r\nconsciousness, and saw him attending on me, much worse and more\r\ncarelessly dressed than he is to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were frightened?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not exactly; but I thought I must be indebted to a man of the\r\nlowest class, to some poor fellow who was really starving, and my first\r\neffort at gratitude was to offer him a piece of gold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he refuse it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; he accepted it for the poor of the parish. Then he told me his\r\nname, Cyrano Derues de Bury, and told me that the shop and the goods it\r\ncontained were his own property, and that he occupied an apartment in\r\nthe house. I floundered in excuses, but he replied that he blessed the\r\nmistake, inasmuch as it would enable him to relieve some unfortunate\r\npeople. I was so touched with his goodness that I offered him a second\r\npiece of gold.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were quite right, my dear; but what induced you to bring him to\r\nBuisson? I should have gone to see and thank him the first time I went\r\nto Paris, and meanwhile a letter would have been sufficient. Did he\r\ncarry his complaisance and interest so far as to offer you his escort?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! I see you cannot get over your first impression—honestly, is it not\r\nso?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" exclaimed Monsieur de Lamotte, laughing heartily, \"it is truly\r\nunlucky for a decent man to have such a face as that! He ought to give\r\nProvidence no rest until he obtains the gift of another countenance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Always these prejudices! It is not the poor man’s fault that he was\r\nborn like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you said something about business we were to discuss together\r\n—what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe he can help us to obtain the money we are in want of.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who told him that we wanted any?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"You! Come, it certainly seems that this gentleman is to be a family\r\nfriend. And pray what induced you to confide in him to this extent?\"\r\n\r\n\"You would have known by now, if you did not interrupt. Let me tell you\r\nall in order. The day after my accident I went out with Edouard about\r\nmidday, and I went to again express my gratitude for his kindness. I was\r\nreceived by Madame Derues, who told me her husband was out, and that he\r\nhad gone to my hotel to inquire after me and my son, and also to see if\r\nanything had been heard of my stolen earrings. She appeared a simple and\r\nvery ordinary sort of person, and she begged me to sit down and wait for\r\nher husband. I thought it would be uncivil not to do so, and Monsieur\r\nDerues appeared in about two hours. The first thing he did, after having\r\nsaluted me and inquired most particularly after my health, was to ask\r\nfor his children, two charming little things, fresh and rosy, whom he\r\ncovered with kisses. We talked about indifferent matters, then he\r\noffered me his services, placed himself at my disposal, and begged me to\r\nspare neither his time nor his trouble. I then told him what had brought\r\nme to Paris, and also the disappointments I had encountered, for of all\r\nthe people I had seen not one had given me a favourable answer. He said\r\nthat he might possibly be of some use to me, and the very next day told\r\n’me that he had seen a capitalist, but could do nothing without more\r\nprecise information. Then I thought it might be better to bring him\r\nhere, so that he might talk matters over with you. When I first asked\r\nhim, he refused altogether, and only yielded to my earnest entreaties\r\nand Edouard’s. This is the history, dear, of the circumstances under\r\nwhich I made Monsieur Derues’ acquaintance. I hope you do not think I\r\nhave acted foolishly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Monsieur de Lamotte, \"I will talk to him to-morrow,\r\nand in any case I promise you I will be civil to him. I will not forget\r\nthat he has been useful to you.\" With which promise the conversation\r\ncame to a close.\r\n\r\nSkilled in assuming any kind of mask and in playing every sort of part,\r\nDerues did not find it difficult to overcome Monsieur de Lamotte’s\r\nprejudices, and in order to obtain the goodwill of the father he made a\r\nskilful use of the friendship which the, son had formed with him. One\r\ncan hardly think that he already meditated the crime which he carried\r\nout later; one prefers to believe that these atrocious plots were not\r\ninvented so long beforehand. But he was already a prey to the idea, and\r\nnothing henceforth could turn him from it. By what route he should\r\narrive at the distant goal which his greed foresaw, he knew not as yet,\r\nbut he had said to himself, \"One day this property shall be mine.\" It\r\nwas the death-warrant of those who owned it.\r\n\r\nWe have no details, no information as to Derues’ first visit to\r\nBuisson-Souef, but when he departed he had obtained the complete\r\nconfidence of the family, and a regular correspondence was carried on\r\nbetween him and the Lamottes. It was thus that he was able to exercise\r\nhis talent of forgery, and succeeded in imitating the writing of this\r\nunfortunate lady so as to be able even to deceive her husband. Several\r\nmonths passed, and none of the hopes which Derues had inspired were\r\nrealised; a loan was always on the point of being arranged, and\r\nregularly failed because of some unforeseen circumstance. These\r\npretended negotiations were managed by Derues with so much skill and\r\ncunning that instead of being suspected, he was pitied for having so\r\nmuch useless trouble. Meanwhile, Monsieur de Lamotte’s money\r\ndifficulties increased, and the sale of Buisson-Souef became inevitable.\r\nDerues offered himself as a purchaser, and actually acquired the\r\nproperty by private contract, dated December, 1775. It was agreed\r\nbetween the parties that the purchase-money of one hundred and thirty\r\nthousand livres should not be paid until 1776, in order to allow Derues\r\nto collect the various sums at his disposal. It was an important\r\npurchase, which, he said, he only made on account of his interest in\r\nMonsieur de Lamotte, and his wish to put an end to the latter’s\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\nBut when the period agreed on arrived, towards the middle of 1776,\r\nDerues found it impossible to pay. It is certain that he never meant to\r\ndo so; and a special peculiarity of this dismal story is the avarice of\r\nthe man, the passion for money which overruled all his actions, and\r\noccasionally caused him to neglect necessary prudence. Enriched by three\r\nbankruptcies, by continual thefts, by usury, the gold he acquired\r\npromptly seemed to disappear. He stuck at nothing to obtain it, and once\r\nin his grasp, he never let it go again. Frequently he risked the loss of\r\nhis character for honest dealing rather than relinquish a fraction of\r\nhis wealth. According to many credible people, it was generally believed\r\nby his contemporaries that this monster possessed treasures which he had\r\nburied in the ground, the hiding-place of which no one knew, not even\r\nhis wife. Perhaps it is only a vague and unfounded rumour, which should\r\nbe rejected; or is it; perhaps, a truth which failed to reveal itself?\r\nIt would be strange if after the lapse of half a century the\r\nhiding-place were to open and give up the fruit of his rapine. Who knows\r\nwhether some of this treasure, accidentally discovered, may not have\r\nfounded fortunes whose origin is unknown, even to their possessors?\r\n\r\nAlthough it was of the utmost importance not to arouse Monsieur de\r\nLamotte’s suspicions just at the moment when he ought to be paying him\r\nso large a sum, Derues was actually at this time being sued by his\r\ncreditors. But in those days ordinary lawsuits had no publicity; they\r\nstruggled and died between the magistrates and advocates without causing\r\nany sound. In order to escape the arrest and detention with which he was\r\nthreatened, he took refuge at Buisson-Souef with his family, and\r\nremained there from Whitsuntide till the end of November. After being\r\ntreated all this time as a friend, Derues departed for Paris, in order,\r\nhe said, to receive an inheritance which would enable him to pay the\r\nrequired purchase-money.\r\n\r\nThis pretended inheritance was that of one of his wife’s relations,\r\nMonsieur Despeignes-Duplessis, who had been murdered in his country\r\nhouse, near Beauvais. It has been strongly suspected that Derues was\r\nguilty of this crime. There are, however, no positive proofs, and we\r\nprefer only to class it as a simple possibility.\r\n\r\nDerues had made formal promises to Monsieur de Lamotte, and it was no\r\nlonger possible for him to elude them. Either the payment must now be\r\nmade, or the contract annulled. A new correspondence began between the\r\ncreditors and the debtor; friendly letters were exchanged, full of\r\nprotestations on one side and confidence on the other. But all Derues’\r\nskill could only obtain a delay of a few months. At length Monsieur de\r\nLamotte, unable to leave Buisson-Souef himself, on account of important\r\nbusiness which required his presence, gave his wife a power of attorney,\r\nconsented to another separation, and sent her to Paris, accompanied by\r\nEdouard, and as if to hasten their misfortunes, sent notice of their\r\ncoming to the expectant murderer.\r\n\r\nWe have passed quickly over the interval between the first meeting of\r\nMonsieur de Lamotte and Derues, and the moment when the victims fell\r\ninto the trap: we might easily have invented long conversations, and\r\nepisodes which would have brought Derues’ profound hypocrisy into\r\ngreater relief; but the reader now knows all that we care to show him.\r\nWe have purposely lingered in our narration in the endeavour to explain\r\nthe perversities of this mysterious organisation; we have over-loaded it\r\nwith all the facts which seem to throw any light upon this sombre\r\ncharacter. But now, after these long preparations, the drama opens, the\r\nscenes become rapid and lifelike; events, long impeded, accumulate and\r\npass quickly before us, the action is connected and hastens to an end.\r\nWe shall see Derues like an unwearied Proteus, changing names, costumes,\r\nlanguage, multiplying himself in many forms, scattering deceptions and\r\nlies from one end of France to the other; and finally, after so many\r\nefforts, such prodigies of calculation and activity, end by wrecking\r\nhimself against a corpse.\r\n\r\nThe letter written at Buisson-Souef arrived at Paris the morning of the\r\n14th of December. In the course of the day an unknown man presented\r\nhimself at the hotel where Madame de Lamotte and her son had stayed\r\nbefore, and inquired what rooms were vacant. There were four, and he\r\nengaged them for a certain Dumoulin, who had arrived that morning from\r\nBordeaux, and who had passed through Paris in order to meet, at some\r\nlittle distance, relations who would return with him. A part of the rent\r\nwas paid in advance, and it was expressly stipulated that until his\r\nreturn the rooms should not be let to anyone, as the aforesaid Dumoulin\r\nmight return with his family and require them at any moment. The same\r\nperson went to other hotels in the neighbourhood and engaged vacant\r\nrooms, sometimes for a stranger he expected, sometimes for friends whom\r\nhe could not accommodate himself.\r\n\r\nAt about three o’clock, the Place de Greve was full of people, thousands\r\nof heads crowded the windows of the surrounding houses. A parricide was\r\nto pay the penalty of his crime—a crime committed under atrocious\r\ncircumstances, with an unheard-of refinement of barbarity. The\r\npunishment corresponded to the crime: the wretched man was broken on the\r\nwheel. The most complete and terrible silence prevailed in the multitude\r\neager for ghastly emotions. Three times already had been heard the heavy\r\nthud of the instrument which broke the victim’s limbs, and a loud cry\r\nescaped the sufferer which made all who heard it shudder with horror,\r\nOne man only, who, in spite of all his efforts, could not get through\r\nthe crowd and cross the square, remained unmoved, and looking\r\ncontemptuously towards the criminal, muttered, \"Idiot! he was unable to\r\ndeceive anyone!\"\r\n\r\nA few moments later the flames began to rise from the funeral pile, the\r\ncrowd began to move, and he than was able to make his way through and\r\nreach one of the streets leading out of the square.\r\n\r\nThe sky was overcast, and the grey daylight hardly penetrated the narrow\r\nlane, hideous and gloomy as the name it bore, and which; only a few\r\nyears ago, still wound like a long serpent through the mire of this\r\nquarter. Just then it was deserted, owing to the attraction of the\r\nexecution close by. The man who had just left the square proceeded\r\nslowly, attentively reading all the inscriptions on the doors. He\r\nstopped at Number 75, where on the threshold of a shop sat a stout woman\r\nbusily knitting, over whom one read in big yellow letters, \"Widow\r\nMasson.\" He saluted the woman, and asked—\r\n\r\n\"Is there not a cellar to let in this house?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is, master,\" answered the widow.\r\n\r\n\"Can I speak to the owner?\"\r\n\r\n\"And that is myself, by your leave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you show me the cellar? I am a provincial wine merchant, my\r\nbusiness often brings me to Paris, and I want a cellar where I could\r\ndeposit wine which I sell on commission.\"\r\n\r\nThey went down together. After examining the place, and ascertaining\r\nthat it was not too damp for the expensive wine which he wished to leave\r\nthere, the man agreed about the rent, paid the first term in advance,\r\nand was entered on the widow Masson’s books under the name of Ducoudray.\r\nIt is hardly necessary to remark that it should have been Derues.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned home in the evening, his wife told him that a large box\r\nhad arrived.\r\n\r\n\"It is all right,\" he said, \"the carpenter from whom I ordered it is a\r\nman of his word.\" Then he supped, and caressed his children. The next\r\nday being Sunday, he received the communion, to the great edification of\r\nthe devout people of the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nOn Monday the 16th Madame de Lamotte and Edouard, descending from the\r\nMontereau stagecoach, were met by Derues and his wife.\r\n\r\n\"Did my husband write to you, Monsieur Derues?\" inquired Madame de\r\nLamotte.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madame, two days ago; and I have arranged our dwelling for your\r\nreception.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! but did not Monsieur de Lamotte ask you to engage the rooms I\r\nhave had before at the Hotel de France?\"\r\n\r\n\"He did not say so, and if that was your idea I trust you will change\r\nit. Do not deprive me of the pleasure of offering you the hospitality\r\nwhich for so long I have accepted from you. Your room is quite ready,\r\nalso one for this dear boy,\" and so saying he took Edouard’s hand; \"and\r\nI am sure if you ask his opinion, he will say you had better be content\r\nto stay with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly,\" said the boy; \"and I do not see why there need be any\r\nhesitation between friends.\"\r\n\r\nWhether by accident, or secret presentiment, or because she foresaw a\r\npossibility of business discussions between them, Madame de Lamotte\r\nobjected to this arrangement. Derues having a business appointment which\r\nhe was bound to keep, desired his wife to accompany the Lamottes to the\r\nHotel de France, and in case of their not being able to find rooms\r\nthere, mentioned three others as the only ones in the quarter where they\r\ncould be comfortably accommodated. Two hours later Madame de Lamotte and\r\nher son returned to his house in the rue Beaubourg.\r\n\r\nThe house which Derues occupied stood opposite the rue des Menoriers,\r\nand was pulled down quite lately to make way for the rue Rambuteau. In\r\n1776 it was one of the finest houses of the rue Beaubourg, and it\r\nrequired a certain income to be able to live there, the rents being\r\ntolerably high. A large arched doorway gave admittance to a passage,\r\nlighted at the other end by a small court, on the far side of which was\r\nthe shop into which Madame de Lamotte had been taken on the occasion of\r\nthe accident. The house staircase was to the right of the passage; and\r\nthe Derues’ dwelling on the entresol. The first room, lighted by a\r\nwindow looking into the court, was used as a dining room, and led into a\r\nsimply furnished sitting-room, such as was generally found among the\r\nbourgeois and tradespeople of this period. To the right of the\r\nsitting-room was a large closet, which could serve as a small study or\r\ncould hold a bed; to the left was a door opening into the Derues’\r\nbedroom, which had been prepared for Madame de Lamotte. Madame Derues\r\nwould occupy one of the two beds which stood in the alcove. Derues had a\r\nbed made up in the sitting-room, and Edouard was accommodated in the\r\nlittle study.\r\n\r\nNothing particular happened during the first few days which followed the\r\nLamottes’ arrival. They had not come to Paris only on account of the\r\nBuisson-Souef affairs. Edouard was nearly sixteen, and after much\r\nhesitation his parents had decided on placing him in some school where\r\nhis hitherto neglected education might receive more attention. Derues\r\nundertook to find a capable tutor, in whose house the boy would be\r\nbrought up in the religious feeling which the cure of Buisson and his\r\nown exhortations had already tended to develop. These proceedings, added\r\nto Madame de Lamotte’s endeavours to collect various sums due to her\r\nhusband, took some time. Perhaps, when on the point of executing a\r\nterrible crime, Derues tried to postpone the fatal moment, although,\r\nconsidering his character, this seems unlikely, for one cannot do him\r\nthe honour of crediting him with a single moment of remorse, doubt, or\r\npity. Far from it, it appears from all the information which can be\r\ngathered, that Derues, faithful to his own traditions, was simply\r\nexperimenting on his unfortunate guests, for no sooner were they in his\r\nhouse than both began to complain of constant nausea, which they had\r\nnever suffered from before. While he thus ascertained the strength of\r\ntheir constitution, he was able, knowing the cause of the malady, to\r\ngive them relief, so that Madame de Lamotte, although she grew daily\r\nweaker, had so much confidence in him as to think it unnecessary to call\r\nin a doctor. Fearing to alarm her husband, she never mentioned her\r\nsufferings, and her letters only spoke of the care and kind attention\r\nwhich she received.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of January, 1777, Edouard was placed in a school in the rue\r\nde l’Homme Arme. His mother never saw him again. She went out once more\r\nto place her husband’s power of attorney with a lawyer in the rue de\r\nPaon. On her return she felt so weak and broken-down that she was\r\nobliged to go to bed and remain there for several days. On January 29th\r\nthe unfortunate lady had risen, and was sitting near the window which\r\noverlooked the deserted rue des Menetriers, where clouds of snow were\r\ndrifting before the wind. Who can guess the sad thoughts which may have\r\npossessed her?—all around dark, cold, and silent, tending to produce\r\npainful depression and involuntary dread. To escape the gloomy ideas\r\nwhich besieged her, her mind went back to the smiling times of her youth\r\nand marriage. She recalled the time when, alone at Buisson during her\r\nhusband’s enforced absences, she wandered with her child in the cool and\r\nshaded walks of the park, and sat out in the evening, inhaling the scent\r\nof the flowers, and listening to the murmur of the water, or the sound\r\nof the whispering breeze in the leaves. Then, coming back from these\r\nsweet recollections to reality, she shed tears, and called on her\r\nhusband and son. So deep was her reverie that she did not hear the room\r\ndoor open, did not perceive that darkness had come on. The light of a\r\ncandle, dispersing the shadows, made her start; she turned her head, and\r\nsaw Derues coming towards her. He smiled, and she made an effort to keep\r\nback the tears which were shining in her eyes, and to appear calm.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid I disturb you,\" he said. \"I came to ask a favour, madame.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Monsieur Derues?\" she inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Will you allow me to have a large chest brought into this room? I ought\r\nto pack some valuable things in it which are in my charge, and are now\r\nin this cupboard. I am afraid it will be in your way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it not your own house, and is it not rather I who am in the way and\r\na cause of trouble? Pray have it brought in, and try to forget that I am\r\nhere. You are most kind to me, but I wish I could spare you all this\r\ntrouble and that I were fit to go back to Buisson. I had a letter from\r\nmy husband yesterday——\"\r\n\r\n\"We will talk about that presently, if you wish it,\" said Derues. \"I\r\nwill go and fetch the servant to help me to carry in this chest. I have\r\nput it off hitherto, but it really must be sent in three days.\"\r\n\r\nHe went away, and returned in a few minutes. The chest was carried in,\r\nand placed before the cupboard at the foot of the bed. Alas! the poor\r\nlady little thought it was her own coffin which stood before her!\r\n\r\nThe maid withdrew, and Derues assisted Madame de Lamotte to a seat near\r\nthe fire, which he revived with more fuel. He sat down opposite to her,\r\nand by the feeble light of the candle placed on a small table between\r\nthem could contemplate at leisure the ravages wrought by poison on her\r\nwasted features.\r\n\r\n\"I saw your son to-day,\" he said: \"he complains that you neglect him,\r\nand have not seen him for twelve days. He does not know you have been\r\nill, nor did I tell him. The dear boy! he loves you so tenderly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I also long to see him. My friend, I cannot tell you what terrible\r\npresentiments beset me; it seems as if I were threatened with some great\r\nmisfortune; and just now, when you came in, I could think only of death.\r\nWhat is the cause of this languor and weakness? It is surely no\r\ntemporary ailment. Tell me the truth: am I not dreadfully altered? and\r\ndo you not think my husband will be shocked when he sees me like this?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are unnecessarily anxious,\" replied Derues; \"it is rather a failing\r\nof yours. Did I not see you last year tormenting yourself about\r\nEdouard’s health, when he was not even thinking of being ill? I am not\r\nso soon alarmed. My own old profession, and that of chemistry, which I\r\nstudied in my youth, have given me some acquaintance with medicine. I\r\nhave frequently been consulted, and have prescribed for patients whose\r\ncondition was supposed to be desperate, and I can assure you I have\r\nnever seen a better and stronger constitution than yours. Try to calm\r\nyourself, and do not call up chimeras; because a mind at ease is the\r\ngreatest enemy of illness. This depression will pass, and then you will\r\nregain your strength.\"\r\n\r\n\"May God grant it! for I feel weaker every day.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have still some business to transact together. The notary at\r\nBeauvais writes that the difficulties which prevented his paying over\r\nthe inheritance of my wife’s relation, Monsieur Duplessis, have mostly\r\ndisappeared. I have a hundred thousand livres at my disposal,—that is to\r\nsay, at yours,—and in a month at latest I shall be able to pay off my\r\ndebt. You ask me to be sincere,\" he continued, with a tinge of\r\nreproachful irony; \"be sincere in your turn, madame, and acknowledge\r\nthat you and your husband have both felt uneasy, and that the delays I\r\nhave been obliged to ask for have not seemed very encouraging to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true,\" she replied; \"but we never questioned your good faith.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you were right. One is not always able to carry out one’s\r\nintentions; events can always upset our calculations; but what really is\r\nin our power is the desire to do right—to be honest; and I can say that\r\nI never intentionally wronged anyone. And now. I am happy in being able\r\nto fulfil my promises to you. I trust when I am the owner of\r\nBuisson-Souef you will not feel obliged to leave it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you; I should like to come occasionally, for all my happy\r\nrecollections are connected with it. Is it necessary for me to accompany\r\nyou to Beauvais?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should you not? The change would do you good.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him and smiled sadly. \"I am not in a fit state to\r\nundertake it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if you imagine that you are unable, certainly. Come, have you any\r\nconfidence in me?\"\r\n\r\n\"The most complete confidence, as you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then: trust to my care. This very evening I will prepare a\r\ndraught for you to take to-morrow morning, and I will even now fix the\r\nduration of this terrible malady which frightens you so much. In two\r\ndays I shall fetch Edouard from his school to celebrate the beginning of\r\nyour convalescence, and we will start, at latest, on February 1st. You\r\nare astonished at what I say, but you shall see if I am not a good\r\ndoctor, and much cleverer than many who pass for such merely because the\r\nhave obtained a diploma.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, doctor, I will place myself in your hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"Remember what I say. You will leave this on February 1st.\"\r\n\r\n\"To begin this cure, can you ensure my sleeping to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. I will go now, and send my wife to you. She will bring a\r\ndraught, which you must promise to take.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will exactly follow your prescriptions. Goodnight, my friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-night, madame; and take courage\"; and bowing low, he left the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the evening was spent in preparing the fatal medicine. The\r\nnext morning, an hour or two after Madame de Lamotte had swallowed it,\r\nthe maid who had given it to her came and told Derues the invalid was\r\nsleeping very heavily and snoring, and asked if she ought to be awoke.\r\nHe went into the room, and, opening the curtains, approached the bed. He\r\nlistened for some time, and recognised that the supposed snoring was\r\nreally the death-rattle. He sent the servant off into the country with a\r\nletter to one of his friends, telling her not to return until the Monday\r\nfollowing, February 3rd. He also sent away his wife, on some unknown\r\npretext, and remained alone with his victim.\r\n\r\nSo terrible a situation ought to have troubled the mind of the most\r\nhardened criminal. A man familiar with murder and accustomed to shed\r\nblood might have felt his heart sink, and, in the absence of pity, might\r\nhave experienced disgust at the sight of this prolonged and useless\r\ntorture; but Derues, calm and easy, as if unconscious of evil, sat\r\ncoolly beside the bed, as any doctor might have done. From time to time\r\nhe felt the slackening pulse, and looked at the glassy and sightless\r\neyes which turned in their orbits, and he saw without terror the\r\napproach of night, which rendered this awful ’tete-a-tete’ even more\r\nhorrible. The most profound silence reigned in the house, the street was\r\ndeserted, and the only sound heard was caused by an icy rain mixed with\r\nsnow driven against the glass, and occasionally the howl of the wind,\r\nwhich penetrated the chimney and scattered the ashes. A single candle\r\nplaced behind the curtains lighted this dismal scene, and the irregular\r\nflicker of its flame cast weird reflections and dancing shadows an the\r\nwalls of the alcove. There came a lull in the wind, the rain ceased, and\r\nduring this instant of calm someone knocked, at first gently, and then\r\nsharply, at the outer door. Derues dropped the dying woman’s hand and\r\nbent forward to listen. The knock was repeated, and he grew pale. He\r\nthrew the sheet, as if it were a shroud, over his victim’s head drew the\r\ncurtains of the alcove, and went to the door. \"Who is there?\" he\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n\"Open, Monsieur Derues,\" said a voice which he recognised as that of a\r\nwoman of Chartres whose affairs he managed, and who had entrusted him\r\nwith sundry deeds in order that he might receive the money due to her.\r\nThis woman had begun to entertain doubts as to Derues’ honesty, and as\r\nshe was leaving Paris the next day, had resolved to get the papers out\r\nof his hands.\r\n\r\n\"Open the door,\" she repeated. \"Don’t you know my voice?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry I cannot let you in. My servant is out: she has taken the\r\nkey and locked the door outside.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must let me in,\" the woman continued; \"it is absolutely necessary I\r\nshould speak to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I leave Paris to-morrow, and I must have those papers to-night.\"\r\n\r\nHe again refused, but she spoke firmly and decidedly. \"I must come in.\r\nThe porter said you were all out, but, from the rue des Menetriers I\r\ncould see the light in your room. My brother is with me, and I left him\r\nbelow. I shall call him if you don’t open the door.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come in, then,\" said Derues; \"your papers are in the sitting-room. Wait\r\nhere, and I will fetch them.\" The woman looked at him and took his hand.\r\n\"Heavens! how pale you are! What is the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing is the matter: will you wait here? \"But she would not release\r\nhis arm, and followed him into the sitting-room, where Derues began to\r\nseek hurriedly among the various papers which covered a table. \"Here\r\nthey are,\" he said; \"now you can go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really,\" said the woman, examining her deeds carefully, \"never yet did\r\nI see you in such a hurry to give up things which don’t belong to you.\r\nBut do hold that candle steadily; your hand is shaking so that I cannot\r\nsee to read.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment the silence which prevailed all round was broken by a cry\r\nof anguish, a long groan proceeding from the chamber to the right of the\r\nsitting-room.\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\" cried the woman. \"Surely it is a dying person!\"\r\n\r\nThe sense of the danger which threatened made Derues pull himself\r\ntogether. \"Do not be alarmed,\" he said. \"My wife has been seized with a\r\nviolent fever; she is quite delirious now, and that is why I told the\r\nporter to let no one come up.\"\r\n\r\nBut the groans in the next room continued, and the unwelcome visitor,\r\novercome by terror which she could neither surmount nor explain, took a\r\nhasty leave, and descended the staircase with all possible rapidity. As\r\nsoon as he could close the door, Derues returned to the bedroom.\r\n\r\nNature frequently collects all her expiring strength at the last moment\r\nof existence. The unhappy lady struggled beneath her coverings; the\r\nagony she suffered had given her a convulsive energy, and inarticulate\r\nsounds proceeded from her mouth. Derues approached and held her on the\r\nbed. She sank back on the pillow, shuddering convulsively, her hands\r\nplucking and twisting the sheets, her teeth chattering and biting the\r\nloose hair which fell over her face and shoulders. \"Water! water!\" she\r\ncried; and then, \"Edouard,—my husband!—Edouard!—is it you?\" Then rising\r\nwith a last effort, she seized her murderer by the arm, repeating,\r\n\"Edouard!—oh!\" and then fell heavily, dragging Derues down with her. His\r\nface was against hers; he raised his head, but the dying hand, clenched\r\nin agony, had closed upon him like a vise. The icy fingers seemed made\r\nof iron and could not be opened, as though the victim had seized on her\r\nassassin as a prey, and clung to the proof of his crime.\r\n\r\nDerues at last freed himself, and putting his hand on her heart, \"It is\r\nover,\" he remarked; \"she has been a long time about it. What o’clock is\r\nit? Nine! She has struggled against death for twelve hours!\"\r\n\r\nWhile the limbs still retained a little warmth, he drew the feet\r\ntogether, crossed the hands on the breast, and placed the body in the\r\nchest. When he had locked it up, he remade the bed, undressed himself,\r\nand slept comfortably in the other one.\r\n\r\nThe next day, February 1st, the day he had fixed for the \"going out\" of\r\nMadame de Lamotte, he caused the chest to be placed on a hand-cart and\r\ncarried at about ten o’clock in the morning to the workshop of a\r\ncarpenter of his acquaintance called Mouchy, who dwelt near the Louvre.\r\nThe two commissionaires employed had been selected in distant quarters,\r\nand did not know each other. They were well paid, and each presented\r\nwith a bottle of wine. These men could never be traced. Derues requested\r\nthe carpenter’s wife to allow the chest to remain in the large workshop,\r\nsaying he had forgotten something at his own house, and would return to\r\nfetch it in three hours. But, instead of a few hours, he left it for two\r\nwhole days—why, one does not know, but it may be supposed that he wanted\r\nthe time to dig a trench in a sort of vault under the staircase leading\r\nto the cellar in the rue de la Mortellerie. Whatever the cause, the\r\ndelay might have been fatal, and did occasion an unforeseen encounter\r\nwhich nearly betrayed him. But of all the actors in this scene he alone\r\nknew the real danger he incurred, and his coolness never deserted him\r\nfor a moment.\r\n\r\nThe third day, as he walked alongside the handcart on which the chest\r\nwas being conveyed, he was accosted at Saint Germain l’Auxerrois by a\r\ncreditor who had obtained a writ of execution against him, and at the\r\nimperative sign made by this man the porter stopped. The creditor\r\nattacked Derues violently, reproaching him for his bad faith in language\r\nwhich was both energetic and uncomplimentary; to which the latter\r\nreplied in as conciliatory a manner as he could assume. But it was\r\nimpossible to silence the enemy, and an increasing crowd of idlers began\r\nto assemble round them.\r\n\r\n\"When will you pay me?\" demanded the creditor. \"I have an execution\r\nagainst you. What is there in that box? Valuables which you cart away\r\nsecretly, in order to laugh at my just claims, as you did two years\r\nago?\"\r\n\r\nDerues shuddered all over; he exhausted himself in protestations; but\r\nthe other, almost beside himself, continued to shout.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" he said, turning to the crowd, \"all these tricks and grimaces and\r\nsigns of the cross are no good. I must have my money, and as I know what\r\nhis promises are worth, I will pay myself! Come, you knave, make haste.\r\nTell me what there is in that box; open it, or I will fetch the police.\"\r\n\r\nThe crowd was divided between the creditor and debtor, and possibly a\r\nfree fight would have begun, but the general attention was distracted by\r\nthe arrival of another spectator. A voice heard above all the tumult\r\ncaused a score of heads to turn, it was the voice of a woman crying:\r\n\r\n\"The abominable history of Leroi de Valine, condemned to death at the\r\nage of sixteen for having poisoned his entire family!\"\r\n\r\nContinually crying her wares, the drunken, staggering woman approached\r\nthe crowd, and striking out right and left with fists and elbows, forced\r\nher way to Derues.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! ah!\" said she, after looking him well over, \"is it you, my gossip\r\nDerues! Have you again a little affair on hand like the one when you set\r\nfire to your shop in the rue Saint-Victor?\"\r\n\r\nDerues recognised the hawker who had abused him on the threshold of his\r\nshop some years previously, and whom he had never seen since. \"Yes,\r\nyes,\" she continued, \"you had better look at me with your little round\r\ncat’s eyes. Are you going to say you don’t know me?\"\r\n\r\nDerues appealed to his creditor. \"You see,\" he said, \"to what insults\r\nyou are exposing me. I do not know this woman who abuses me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!—you don’t know me! You who accused me of being a thief! But\r\nluckily the Maniffets have been known in Paris as honest people for\r\ngenerations, while as for you——\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said Derues, \"this case contains valuable wine which I am\r\ncommissioned to sell. To-morrow I shall receive the money for it;\r\nto-morrow, in the course of the day, I will pay what I owe you. But I am\r\nwaited for now, do not in Heaven’s name detain me longer, and thus\r\ndeprive me of the means of paying at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don’t believe him, my good man,\" said the hawker; \"lying comes natural\r\nto him always.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir, I promise on my oath you shall be paid tomorrow; you had better\r\ntrust the word of an honest man rather than the ravings of a drunken\r\nwoman.\"\r\n\r\nThe creditor still hesitated, but, another person now spoke in Derues’\r\nfavour; it was the carpenter Mouchy, who had inquired the cause of the\r\nquarrel.\r\n\r\n\"For God’s sake,\" he exclaimed, \"let the gentleman go on. That chest\r\ncame from my workshop, and I know there is wine inside it; he told my\r\nwife so two days ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you be surety for me, my friend?\" asked Derues.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly I will; I have not known you for ten years in order to leave\r\nyou in trouble and refuse to answer for you. What the devil are\r\nrespectable people to be stopped like this in a public place? Come, sir,\r\nbelieve his word, as I do.\"\r\n\r\nAfter some more discussion, the porter was at last allowed to proceed\r\nwith his hand-cart. The hawker wanted to interfere, but Mouchy warned\r\nher off and ordered her to be silent. \"Ah! ah!\" she cried, \"what does it\r\nmatter to me? Let him sell his wine if he can; I shall not drink any on\r\nhis premises. This is the second time he has found a surety to my\r\nknowledge; the beggar must have some special secret for encouraging the\r\ngrowth of fools. Good-bye, gossip Derues; you know I shall be selling\r\nyour history some day. Meanwhile——\r\n\r\n\"The abominable history of Leroi de Valine, condemned to death at the\r\nage of sixteen for having poisoned his entire family!\"\r\n\r\nWhilst she amused the people by her grimaces and grotesque gestures, and\r\nwhile Mouchy held forth to some of them, Derues made his escape. Several\r\ntimes between Saint-Germain l’Auxerrois and the rue de la Mortellerie he\r\nnearly fainted, and was obliged to stop. While the danger lasted, he had\r\nhad sufficient self-control to confront it coolly, but now that he\r\ncalculated the depth of the abyss which for a moment had opened beneath\r\nhis feet, dizziness laid hold on him.\r\n\r\nOther precautions now became necessary. His real name had been mentioned\r\nbefore the commissionaire, and the widow Masson, who owned the cellar,\r\nonly knew him as Ducoudray. He went on in front, asked for the keys,\r\nwhich till then had been left with her, and the chest was got downstairs\r\nwithout any awkward questions. Only the porter seemed astonished that\r\nthis supposed wine, which was to be sold immediately, should be put in\r\nsuch a place, and asked if he might come the next day and move it again.\r\nDerues replied that someone was coming for it that very day. This\r\nquestion, and the disgraceful scene which the man had witnessed, made it\r\nnecessary to get rid of him without letting him see the pit dug under\r\nthe staircase. Derues tried to drag the chest towards the hole, but all\r\nhis strength was insufficient to move it. He uttered terrible\r\nimprecations when he recognised his own weakness, and saw that he would\r\nbe obliged to bring another stranger, an informer perhaps, into this\r\ncharnel-house, where; as yet, nothing betrayed his crimes. No sooner\r\nescaped from one peril than he encountered another, and already he had\r\nto struggle against his own deeds. He measured the length of the trench,\r\nit was too short. Derues went out and repaired to the place where he had\r\nhired the labourer who had dug it out, but he could not find the man,\r\nwhom he had only seen once, and whose name he did not know. Two whole\r\ndays were spent in this fruitless search, but on the third, as he was\r\nwandering on one of the quays at the time labourers were to be found\r\nthere, a mason, thinking he was looking for someone, inquired what he\r\nwanted. Derues looked well at the man, and concluding from his\r\nappearance that he was probably rather simpleminded, asked—\r\n\r\n\"Would you like to earn a crown of three livres by an easy job?\"\r\n\r\n\"What a question, master!\" answered the mason. \"Work is so scarce that I\r\nam going back into the country this very evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well! Bring your tools, spade, and pickaxe, and follow me.\"\r\n\r\nThey both went down to the cellar, and the mason was ordered to dig out\r\nthe pit till it was five and a half feet deep. While the man worked,\r\nDerues sat beside the chest and read. When it was half done, the mason\r\nstopped for breath, and leaning on his spade, inquired why he wanted a\r\ntrench of such a depth. Derues, who had probably foreseen the question,\r\nanswered at once, without being disconcerted—\r\n\r\n\"I want to bury some bottled wine which is contained in this case.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wine!\" said the other. \"Ah! you are laughing at me, because you think I\r\nlook a fool! I never yet heard of such a recipe for improving wine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do you come from?\"\r\n\r\n\"D’Alencon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cider drinker! You were brought up in Normandy, that is clear. Well,\r\nyou can learn from me, Jean-Baptiste Ducoudray, a wine grower of Tours,\r\nand a wine merchant for the last ten years, that new wine thus buried\r\nfor a year acquires the quality and characteristics of the oldest\r\nbrands.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is possible,\" said the mason, again taking his spade, \"but all the\r\nsame it seems a little odd to me.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished, Derues asked him to help to drag the chest\r\nalongside the trench, so that it might be easier to take out the bottles\r\nand arrange them: The mason agreed, but when he moved the chest the\r\nfoetid odour which proceeded from it made him draw back, declaring that\r\na smell such as that could not possibly proceed from wine. Derues tried\r\nto persuade him that the smell came from drains under the cellar, the\r\npipe of which could be seen. It appeared to satisfy him, and he again\r\ntook hold of the chest, but immediately let it go again, and said\r\npositively that he could not execute Derues’ orders, being convinced\r\nthat the chest must contain a decomposing corpse. Then Derues threw\r\nhimself at the man’s feet and acknowledged that it was the dead body of\r\na woman who had unfortunately lodged in his house, and who had died\r\nthere suddenly from an unknown malady, and that, dreading lest he should\r\nbe accused of having murdered her, he had decided to conceal the death\r\nand bury her here.\r\n\r\nThe mason listened, alarmed at this confidence, and not knowing whether\r\nto believe it or not. Derues sobbed and wept at his feet, beat his\r\nbreast and tore out his hair, calling on God and the saints as witnesses\r\nof his good faith and his innocence. He showed the book he was reading\r\nwhile the mason excavated: it was the Seven Penitential Psalms. \"How\r\nunfortunate I am!\" he cried. \"This woman died in my house, I assure\r\nyou—died suddenly, before I could call a doctor. I was alone; I might\r\nhave been accused, imprisoned, perhaps condemned for a crime I did not\r\ncommit. Do not ruin me! You leave Paris to-night, you need not be\r\nuneasy; no one would know that I employed you, if this unhappy affair\r\nshould ever be discovered. I do not know your name, I do not wish to\r\nknow it, and I tell you mine, it is Ducoudray. I give myself up to you,\r\nbut have some pity!—if not for me, yet for my wife and my two little\r\nchildren—for these poor creatures whose only support I am!\"\r\n\r\nSeeing that the mason was touched, Derues opened the chest.\r\n\r\n\"Look,\" he said, \"examine the body of this woman, does it show any mark\r\nof violent death? My God!\" he continued, joining his hands and in tones\r\nof despairing agony,—\"my God, Thou who readest all hearts, and who\r\nknowest my innocence, canst Thou not ordain a miracle to save an honest\r\nman? Wilt Thou not command this dead body to bear witness for me?\"\r\n\r\nThe mason was stupefied by this flow of language. Unable to restrain his\r\ntears, he promised to keep silence, persuaded that Derues was innocent,\r\nand that appearances only were against him. The latter, moreover, did\r\nnot neglect other means of persuasion; he handed the mason two gold\r\npieces, and between them they buried the body of Madame de Lamotte.\r\n\r\nHowever extraordinary this fact, which might easily be supposed\r\nimaginary, may appear, it certainly happened. In the examination at his\r\ntrial. Derues himself revealed it, repeating the story which had\r\nsatisfied the mason. He believed that this man had denounced him: he was\r\nmistaken, for this confidant of his crime, who might have been the first\r\nto put justice on his track, never reappeared, and but for Derues’\r\nacknowledgment his existence would have remained unknown.\r\n\r\nThis first deed accomplished, another victim was already appointed.\r\nTrembling at first as to the consequences of his forced confession,\r\nDerues waited some days, paying, however, his creditor as promised. He\r\nredoubles his demonstrations of piety, he casts a furtive glance on\r\neveryone he meets, seeking for some expression of distrust. But no one\r\navoids him, or points him out with a raised finger, or whispers on\r\nseeing him; everywhere he encounters the customary expression of\r\ngoodwill. Nothing has changed; suspicion passes over his head without\r\nalighting there. He is reassured, and resumes his work. Moreover, had he\r\nwished to remain passive, he could not have done so; he was now\r\ncompelled to follow that fatal law of crime which demands that blood\r\nmust be effaced with blood, and which is compelled to appeal again to\r\ndeath in order to stifle the accusing voice already issuing from the\r\ntomb.\r\n\r\nEdouard de Lamotte, loving his mother as much as she loved him, became\r\nuneasy at receiving no visits, and was astonished at this sudden\r\nindifference. Derues wrote to him as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I have at length some good news for you, my dear boy, but you must not\r\ntell your mother I have betrayed her secret; she would scold me, because\r\nshe is planning a surprise for you, and the various steps and care\r\nnecessary in arranging this important matter have caused her absence.\r\nYou were to know nothing until the 11th or 12th of this month, but now\r\nthat all is settled, I should blame myself if I prolonged the\r\nuncertainty in which you have been left, only you must promise me to\r\nlook as much astonished as possible. Your mother, who only lives for\r\nyou, is going to present you with the greatest gift a youth of your age\r\ncan receive—that of liberty. Yes, dear boy, we thought we had discovered\r\nthat you have no very keen taste for study, and that a secluded life\r\nwill suit neither your character nor your health. In saying this I utter\r\nno reproach, for every man is born with his own decided tastes, and the\r\nway to success and happiness is-often-to allow him to follow these\r\ninstincts. We have had long discussions on this subject—your mother and\r\nI—and we have thought much about your future; she has at last come to a\r\ndecision, and for the last ten days has been at Versailles, endeavouring\r\nto obtain your admission as a royal page. Here is the mystery, this is\r\nthe reason which has kept her from you, and as she knew you would hear\r\nit with delight, she wished to have the pleasure of telling you herself.\r\nTherefore, once again, when you see her, which will be very soon, do not\r\nlet her see I have told you; appear to be greatly surprised. It is true\r\nthat I am asking you to tell a lie, but it is a very innocent one, and\r\nits good intention will counteract its sinfulness—may God grant we never\r\nhave worse upon our consciences! Thus, instead of lessons and the solemn\r\nprecepts of your tutors, instead of a monotonous school-life, you are\r\ngoing to enjoy your liberty; also the pleasures of the court and the\r\nworld. All that rather alarms me, and I ought to confess that I at first\r\nopposed this plan. I begged your mother to reflect, to consider that in\r\nthis new existence you would run great risk of losing the religious\r\nfeeling which inspires you, and which I have had the happiness, during\r\nmy sojourn at Buisson-Souef, of further developing in your mind. I still\r\nrecall with emotion your fervid and sincere aspirations towards the\r\nCreator when you approached the Sacred Table for the first time, and\r\nwhen, kneeling beside you, and envying the purity of heart and innocence\r\nof soul which appeared to animate your countenance as with a divine\r\nradiance, I besought God that, in default of my own virtue, the love for\r\nheavenly Truth with which I have inspired you might be reckoned to my\r\naccount. Your piety is my work, Edouard, and I defended it against your\r\nmother’s plans; but she replied that in every career a man is master of\r\nhis own good or evil actions; and as I have no authority over you, and\r\nfriendship only gives me the right to advise, I must give way. If this\r\nbe your vocation, then follow it.\r\n\r\n\"My occupations are so numerous (I have to collect from different\r\nsources this hundred thousand livres intended to defray the greater part\r\nof the Buisson purchase) that I have not a moment in which to come and\r\nsee you this week. Spend the time in reflection, and write to me fully\r\nwhat you think about this plan. If, like me, you feel any scruples, you\r\nmust tell them to your mother, who decidedly wants only to make you\r\nhappy. Speak to me freely, openly. It is arranged that I am to fetch you\r\non the 11th of this month, and escort you to Versailles, where Madame de\r\nLamotte will be waiting to receive you with the utmost tenderness.\r\nAdieu, dear boy; write to me. Your father knows nothing as yet; his\r\nconsent will be asked after your decision.\"\r\n\r\nThe answer to this letter did not have to be waited for: it was such as\r\nDerues expected; the lad accepted joyfully. The answer was, for the\r\nmurderer, an arranged plea of defence, a proof which, in a given case,\r\nmight link the present with the past.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of February 11th, Shrove Tuesday, he went to fetch the\r\nyoung de Lamotte from his school, telling the master that he was desired\r\nby the youth’s mother to conduct him to Versailles. But, instead, he\r\ntook him to his own house, saying that he had a letter from Madame de\r\nLamotte asking them not to come till the next day; so they started on\r\nAsh Wednesday, Edouard having breakfasted on chocolate. Arrived at\r\nVersailles, they stopped at the Fleur-de-lys inn, but there the sickness\r\nwhich the boy had complained of during the journey became very serious,\r\nand the innkeeper, having young children, and believing that he\r\nrecognised symptoms of smallpox, which just then was ravaging\r\nVersailles, refused to receive them, saying he had no vacant room. This\r\nmight have disconcerted anyone but Derues, but his audacity, activity,\r\nand resource seemed to increase with each fresh obstacle. Leaving\r\nEdouard in a room on the ground floor which had no communication with\r\nthe rest of the inn, he went at once to look for lodgings, and hastily\r\nexplored the town. After a fruitless search, he found at last, at the\r\njunction of the rue Saint-Honore with that of the Orangerie, a cooper\r\nnamed Martin, who had a furnished room to spare. This he hired at thirty\r\nsous per day for himself and his nephew, who had been taken suddenly\r\nill, under the name of Beaupre. To avoid being questioned later, he\r\ninformed the cooper in a few words that he was a doctor; that he had\r\ncome to Versailles in order to place his nephew in one of the offices of\r\nthe town; that in a few days the latter’s mother would arrive to join\r\nhim in seeing and making application to influential persons about the\r\ncourt, to whom he had letters of introduction. As soon as he had\r\ndelivered this fable with all the appearance of truth with which he knew\r\nso well how to disguise his falsehoods, he went back to the young de\r\nLamotte, who was already so exhausted that he was hardly able to drag\r\nhimself as far as the cooper’s house. He fainted on arrival, and was\r\ncarried into the hired room, where Derues begged to be left alone with\r\nhim, and only asked for certain beverages which he told the people how\r\nto prepare.\r\n\r\nWhether it was that the strength of youth fought against the poison, or\r\nthat Derues took pleasure in watching the sufferings of his victim, the\r\nagony of the poor lad was prolonged until the fourth day. The sickness\r\ncontinuing incessantly, he sent the cooper’s wife for a medicine which\r\nhe prepared and administered himself. It produced terrible pain, and\r\nEdouard’s cries brought the cooper and his wife upstairs. They\r\nrepresented to Derues that he ought to call in a doctor and consult with\r\nhim, but he refused decidedly, saying that a doctor hastily fetched\r\nmight prove to be an ignorant person with whom he could not agree, and\r\nthat he could not allow one so dear to him to be prescribed for and\r\nnursed by anyone but himself.\r\n\r\n\"I know what the malady is,\" he continued, raising his eyes to heaven;\r\n\"it is one that has to be concealed rather than acknowledged. Poor\r\nyouth! whom I love as my own son, if God, touched by my tears and thy\r\nsuffering, permits me to save thee, thy whole life will be too short for\r\nthy blessings and thy gratitude!\" And as Madame Martin asked what this\r\nmalady might be, he answered with hypocritical blushes—\r\n\r\n\"Do not ask, madame; there are things of which you do not know even the\r\nname.\"\r\n\r\nAt another time, Martin expressed his surprise that the young man’s\r\nmother had not yet appeared, who, according to Derues, was to have met\r\nhim at Versailles. He asked how she could know that they were lodging in\r\nhis house, and if he should send to meet her at any place where she was\r\nlikely to arrive.\r\n\r\n\"His mother,\" said Derues, looking compassionately at Edouard, who lay\r\npale, motionless, and as if insensible,—\"his mother! He calls for her\r\nincessantly. Ah! monsieur, some families are greatly to be pitied! My\r\nentreaties prevailed on her to decide on coming hither, but will she\r\nkeep her promise? Do not ask me to tell you more; it is too painful to\r\nhave to accuse a mother of having forgotten her duties in the presence\r\nof her son . . . there are secrets which ought not to be told—unhappy\r\nwoman!\"\r\n\r\nEdouard moved, extended his arms, and repeated, \"Mother! . . . mother!\"\r\n\r\nDerues hastened to his side and took his hands in his, as if to warm\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"My mother!\" the youth repeated. \"Why have I not seen her? She was to\r\nhave met me.\"\r\n\r\nYou shall soon see her, dear boy; only keep quiet.\"\r\n\r\n\"But just now I thought she was dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dead!\" cried Derues. \"Drive away these sad thoughts. They are caused by\r\nthe fever only.\"\r\n\r\n\"No! oh no! . . . I heard a secret voice which said, ’Thy mother is\r\ndead!’ . . . And then I beheld a livid corpse before me . . . It was\r\nshe! . . . I knew her well! and she seemed to have suffered so much——\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear boy, your mother is not dead . . . . My God! what terrible\r\nchimeras you conjure up! You will see her again, I assure you; she has\r\narrived already. Is it not so, madame?\" he asked, turning towards the\r\nMartins, who were both leaning against the foot of the bed, and signing\r\nto them to support this pious falsehood, in order to calm the young man.\r\n\"Did she not arrive and come to his bedside and kiss him while he slept,\r\nand she will soon come again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Madame Martin, wiping her eyes; \"and she begged my\r\nhusband and me to help your uncle to take great care of you—\"\r\n\r\nThe youth moved again, and looking round him with a dazed expression,\r\nsaid, \"My uncle—?\"\r\n\r\n\"You had better go,\" said Derues in a whisper to the Martins. \"I am\r\nafraid he is delirious again; I will prepare a draught, which will give\r\nhim a little rest and sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Adieu, then, adieu,\" answered Madame Martin; \"and may Heaven bless you\r\nfor the care you bestow on this poor young man!\"\r\n\r\nOn Friday evening violent vomiting appeared to have benefited the\r\nsufferer. He had rejected most of the poison, and had a fairly quiet\r\nnight. But on the Saturday morning Derues sent the cooper’s little girl\r\nto buy more medicine, which he prepared, himself, like the first. The\r\nday was horrible, and about six in the evening, seeing his victim was at\r\nthe last gasp, he opened a little window overlooking the shop and\r\nsummoned the cooper, requesting him to go at once for a priest. When the\r\nlatter arrived he found Derues in tears, kneeling at the dying boy’s\r\nbedside. And now, by the light of two tapers placed on a table, flanking\r\nthe holy water-stoup, there began what on one side was an abominable and\r\nsacrilegious comedy, a disgraceful parody of that which Christians\r\nconsider most sacred and most dear; on the other, a pious and consoling\r\nceremony. The cooper and his wife, their eyes bathed in tears, knelt in\r\nthe middle of the room, murmuring such prayers as they could remember.\r\n\r\nDerues gave up his place to the priest, but as Edouard did not answer\r\nthe latter’s questions, he approached the bed, and bending over the\r\nsufferer, exhorted him to confession.\r\n\r\n\"Dear boy,\" he said, \"take courage; your sufferings here will be counted\r\nto you above: God will weigh them in the scales of His infinite mercy.\r\nListen to the words of His holy minister, cast your sins into His bosom,\r\nand obtain from Him forgiveness for your faults.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am in such terrible pain!\" cried Edouard. \"Water! water! Extinguish\r\nthe fire which consumes me!\"\r\n\r\nA violent fit came on, succeeded by exhaustion and the death-rattle.\r\nDerues fell on his knees, and the priest administered extreme unction.\r\nThere was then a moment of absolute silence, more impressive than cries\r\nand sobs. The priest collected himself for a moment, crossed himself,\r\nand began to pray. Derues also crossed himself, and repeated in a low\r\nvoice, apparently choked by grief\r\n\r\n\"Go forth, O Christian soul, from this world, in the name of God the\r\nFather Almighty, who created thee; in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son\r\nof the living God, who suffered for thee; in the name of the Holy Ghost,\r\nwho was poured out upon thee.\"\r\n\r\nThe youth struggled in his bed, and a convulsive movement agitated his\r\nlimbs. Derues continued—\r\n\r\n\"When thy soul departs from this body may it be admitted to the holy\r\nMountain of Sion, to the Heavenly Jerusalem, to the numerous company of\r\nAngels, and to the Church of the First-born, whose names are written in\r\nHeaven——\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother! . . . My mother!\" cried Edouard. Derues resumed—\r\n\r\n\"Let God arise, and let the Powers of Darkness be dispersed! let the\r\nSpirits of Evil, who reign over the air, be put to flight; let them not\r\ndare to attack a soul redeemed by the precious blood of Jesus Christ.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amen,\" responded the priest and the Martins.\r\n\r\nThere was another silence, broken only by the stifled sobs of Derues.\r\nThe priest again crossed himself and took up the prayer.\r\n\r\n\"We beseech Thee, O beloved and only Son of God, by the merits of Thy\r\nsacred Passion, Thy Cross and Thy Death, to deliver this Thy servant\r\nfrom the pains of Hell, and to lead him to that happy place whither Thou\r\ndidst vouchsafe to lead the thief, who, with Thee, was bound upon the\r\nCross: Thou, who art God, living and reigning with the Father and the\r\nHoly Ghost.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amen,\" repeated those present. Derues now took up the prayer, and his\r\nvoice mingled with the dying gasps of the sufferer.\r\n\r\n\"And there was a darkness over all the earth——\r\n\r\n\"To Thee, O Lord, we commend the soul of this Thy servant, that, being\r\ndead to the world, he may, live to Thee: and the sins he hath committed\r\nthrough the frailty of his mortal nature, do Thou in Thy most merciful\r\ngoodness, forgive and wash away. Amen.\"\r\n\r\nAfter which all present sprinkled holy water on the body....\r\n\r\nWhen the priest had retired, shown out by Madame Martin, Derues said to\r\nher husband—\r\n\r\n\"This unfortunate young man has died without the consolation of\r\nbeholding his mother.... His last thought was for her.... There now\r\nremains the last duty, a very painful one to accomplish, but my poor\r\nnephew imposed it on me. A few hours ago, feeling that his end was near,\r\nhe asked me, as a last mark of friendship, not to entrust these final\r\nduties to the hands of strangers.\"\r\n\r\nWhile he applied himself to the necessary work in presence of the\r\ncooper, who was much affected by the sight of such sincere and profound\r\naffliction, Derues added, sighing—\r\n\r\n\"I shall always grieve for this dear boy. Alas! that evil living should\r\nhave caused his early death!\"\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished laying out the body, he threw some little packets\r\ninto the fire which he professed to have found in the youth’s pockets,\r\ntelling Martin, in order to support this assertion, that they contained\r\ndrugs suitable to this disgraceful malady.\r\n\r\nHe spent the night in the room with the corpse, as he had done in the\r\ncase of Madame de Lamotte, and the next day, Sunday, he sent Martin to\r\nthe parish church of St. Louis, to arrange for a funeral of the simplest\r\nkind; telling him to fill up the certificate in the name of Beaupre,\r\nborn at Commercy, in Lorraine. He declined himself either to go to the\r\nchurch or to appear at the funeral, saying that his grief was too great.\r\nMartin, returning from the funeral, found him engaged in prayer. Derues\r\ngave him the dead youth’s clothes and departed, leaving some money to be\r\ngiven to the poor of the parish, and for masses to be said for the\r\nrepose of the soul of the dead.\r\n\r\nHe arrived at home in the evening, found his wife entertaining some\r\nfriends; and told them he had just come from Chartres, where he had been\r\nsummoned on business. Everyone noticed his unusual air of satisfaction,\r\nand he sang several songs during supper.\r\n\r\nHaving accomplished these two crimes, Derues did not remain idle. When\r\nthe murderer’s part of his nature was at rest, the thief reappeared. His\r\nextreme avarice now made him regret the expense’ caused by the deaths of\r\nMadame de Lamotte and her son, and he wished to recoup himself. Two days\r\nafter his return from Versailles, he ventured to present himself at\r\nEdouard’s school. He told the master that he had received a letter from\r\nMadame de Lamotte, saying that she wished to keep her son, and asking\r\nhim to obtain Edouard’s belongings. The schoolmaster’s wife, who was\r\npresent, replied that that could not be; that Monsieur de Lamotte would\r\nhave known of his wife’s intention; that she would not have taken such a\r\nstep without consulting him; and that only the evening before, they had\r\nreceived a present of game from Buisson-Souef, with a letter in which\r\nMonsieur de Lamotte entreated them to take great, care of his son.\r\n\r\n\"If what you say is true,\" she continued, \"Madame de Lamotte is no doubt\r\nacting on your advice in taking away her son. But I will write to\r\nBuisson.\"\r\n\r\n\"You had better not do anything in the matter;\" said Derues, turning to\r\nthe schoolmaster. \"It is quite possible that Monsieur de Lamotte does\r\nnot know. I am aware that his wife does not always consult him. She is\r\nat Versailles, where I took Edouard to her, and I will inform her of\r\nyour objection.\"\r\n\r\nTo insure impunity for these murders, Derues had resolved on the death\r\nof Monsieur de Lamotte; but before executing this last crime, he wished\r\nfor some proof of the recent pretended agreements between himself and\r\nMadame de Lamotte. He would not wait for the disappearance of the whole\r\nfamily before presenting himself as the lawful proprietor, of\r\nBuisson-Souef. Prudence required him to shelter himself behind a deed\r\nwhich should have been executed by that lady. On February 27th he\r\nappeared at the office of Madame de Lamotte’s lawyer in the rue du Paon,\r\nand, with all the persuasion of an artful tongue, demanded the power of\r\nattorney on that lady’s behalf, saying that he had, by private contract,\r\njust paid a hundred thousand livres on the total amount of purchase,\r\nwhich money was now deposited with a notary. The lawyer, much astonished\r\nthat an affair of such importance should have been arranged without any\r\nreference to himself, refused to give up the deed to anyone but Monsieur\r\nor Madame de Lamotte, and inquired why the latter did not appear\r\nherself. Derues replied that she was at Versailles, and that he was to\r\nsend the deed to her there. He repeated his request and the lawyer his\r\nrefusal, until Derues retired, saying he would find means to compel him\r\nto give up the deed. He actually did, the same day, present a petition\r\nto the civil authority, in which Cyrano Derues de Bury sets forth\r\narrangements, made with Madame de Lamotte, founded on the deed given by\r\nher husband, and requires permission to seize and withdraw said deed\r\nfrom the custody in which it remains at present. The petition is\r\ngranted. The lawyer objects that he can only give up the deed to either\r\nMonsieur or Madame de Lamotte, unless he be otherwise ordered. Derues\r\nhas the effrontery to again appeal to the civil authority, but, for the\r\nreasons given by that public officer, the affair is adjourned.\r\n\r\nThese two futile efforts might have compromised Derues had they been\r\nheard of at Buisson-Souef; but everything seemed to conspire in the\r\ncriminal’s favour: neither the schoolmaster’s wife nor the lawyer\r\nthought of writing to Monsieur de Lamotte. The latter, as yet\r\nunsuspecting, was tormented by other anxieties, and kept at home by\r\nillness.\r\n\r\nIn these days, distance is shortened, and one can travel from\r\nVilleneuve-le-Roi-les-Sens to Paris in a few hours. This was not the\r\ncase in 1777, when private industry and activity, stifled by routine and\r\nprivilege, had not yet experienced the need of providing the means for\r\nrapid communication. Half a day was required to go from the capital to\r\nVersailles; a journey of twenty leagues required at least two days and a\r\nnight, and bristled with obstacles and delays of all kinds. These\r\ndifficulties of transport, still greater during bad weather, and a long\r\nand serious attack of gout, explain why Monsieur de Lamotte, who was so\r\nready to take alarm, had remained separated from his wife from the\r\nmiddle of December to the end of February. He had received reassuring\r\nletters from her, written at first with freedom and simplicity; but he\r\nthought he noticed a gradual change in the later ones, which appeared to\r\nproceed more from the mind than the heart. A style which aimed at being\r\nnatural was interspersed with unnecessary expressions of affection,\r\nunusual between married people well assured of their mutual love.\r\nMonsieur de Lamotte observed and exaggerated these peculiarities, and\r\nthough endeavouring to persuade himself that he was mistaken, he could\r\nnot forget them, or regain his usual tranquility. Being somewhat ashamed\r\nof his anxiety, he kept his fears to himself.\r\n\r\nOne morning, as he was sunk in a large armchair by the fire, his\r\nsitting-room door opened, and the cure entered, who was surprised by his\r\ndespondent, sad, and pale appearance. \"What is the matter?\" he inquired,\r\n\"Have you had an extra bad night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Monsieur de Lamotte.\r\n\r\n\"Well, have you any news from Paris?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing for a whole week: it is odd, is it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am always hoping that this sale may fall through; it drags on for so\r\nvery long; and I believe that Monsieur Derues, in spite of what your\r\nwife wrote a month ago, has not as much money as he pretends to have. Do\r\nyou know that it is said that Monsieur Despeignes-Duplessis, Madame\r\nDerues’ relative, whose money they inherited, was assassinated?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did you hear that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a common report in the country, and was brought here by a man who\r\ncame recently from Beauvais.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have the murderers been discovered?\"\r\n\r\n\"Apparently not; justice seems unable to discover anything at all.\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur de Lamotte hung his head, and his countenance assumed an\r\nexpression of painful thought, as though this news affected him\r\npersonally.\r\n\r\n\"Frankly,\" resumed the cure, \"I believe you will remain Seigneur du\r\nBuisson-Souef, and that I shall be spared the pain of writing another\r\nname over your seat in the church of Villeneuve.\"\r\n\r\n\"The affair must be settled in a few days, for I can wait no longer; if\r\nthe purchaser be not Monsieur Derues, it will have to be someone else.\r\nWhat makes you think he is short of money?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! oh!\" said the cure, \"a man who has money either pays his debts, or\r\nis a cheat. Now Heaven preserve me from suspecting Monsieur Derues’\r\nhonesty!\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you know about him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you remember Brother Marchois of the Camaldulians, who came to see\r\nme last spring, and who was here the day Monsieur Derues arrived, with\r\nyour wife and Edouard?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly. Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I happened to tell him in one of my letters that Monsieur Derues\r\nhad become the purchaser of Buisson-Souef, and that I believed the\r\narrangements were concluded. Thereupon Brother Marchois wrote asking me\r\nto remind him that he owes them a sum of eight hundred livres, and that,\r\nso far, they have not seen a penny of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Monsieur de Lamotte, \"perhaps I should have done better not\r\nto let myself be deluded by his fine promises. He certainly has money on\r\nhis tongue, and when once one begins to listen to him, one can’t help\r\ndoing what he wants. All the same, I had rather have had to deal with\r\nsomeone else.\"\r\n\r\n\"And is it this which worries you, and makes you seem so anxious?\"\r\n\r\n\"This and other things.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am really ashamed to own it, but I am a credulous and timid as any\r\nold woman. Now do not laugh at me too much. Do you believe in dreams?\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur,\" said the cure, smiling, \"you should never ask a coward\r\nwhether he is afraid, you only risk his telling a lie. He will say ’No,’\r\nbut he means ’Yes.’\"\r\n\r\n\"And are you a coward, my father?\"\r\n\r\n\"A little. I don’t precisely believe all the nursery, tales, or in the\r\nfavourable or unfavourable meaning of some object seen during our sleep,\r\nbut—\"\r\n\r\nA sound of steps interrupted them, a servant entered, announcing\r\nMonsieur Derues.\r\n\r\nOn hearing the name, Monsieur de Lamotte felt troubled in spite of\r\nhimself, but, overcoming the impression, he rose to meet the visitor.\r\n\r\n\"You had better stay,\" he said to the cure, who was also rising to take\r\nleave. \"Stay; we have probably nothing to say which cannot be said\r\nbefore you.\"\r\n\r\nDerues entered the room, and, after the usual compliments, sat down by\r\nthe fire, opposite Monsieur de Lamotte.\r\n\r\n\"You did not expect me,\" he said, \"and I ought to apologise for\r\nsurprising you thus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me some news of my wife,\" asked Monsieur de Lamotte anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"She has never been better. Your son is also to perfect health.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why are you alone? Why does not Marie accompany you? It is ten\r\nweeks since she went to Paris.\"\r\n\r\n\"She has not yet quite finished the business with which you entrusted\r\nher. Perhaps I am partly the cause of this long absence, but one cannot\r\ntransact business as quickly as one would wish. But, you have no doubt\r\nheard from her, that all is finished, or nearly so, between us. We have\r\ndrawn up a second private contract, which annuls the former agreement,\r\nand I have paid over a sum of one hundred thousand livres.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not comprehend,\" said Monsieur de Lamotte. \"What can induce my\r\nwife not to inform me of this?\"\r\n\r\n\"You did not know?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know nothing. I was wondering just now with Monsieur le cure why I\r\ndid not hear from her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame de Lamotte was going to write to you, and I do not know what can\r\nhave hindered her.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did you leave her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Several days ago. I have not been at Paris; I am returning from\r\nChartres. I believed you were informed of everything.\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur de Lamotte remained silent for some moments. Then, fixing his\r\neyes upon Derues’ immovable countenance, he said, with some emotion—\r\n\r\n\"You are a husband and father, sir; in the name of this double and\r\nsacred affection which is, not unknown to you, do not hide anything from\r\nme: I fear some misfortune has happened to my wife which you are\r\nconcealing.\"\r\n\r\nDerues’ physiognomy expressed nothing but a perfectly natural\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n\"What can have suggested such ideas to you; dear sir?\" In saying this he\r\nglanced at the cure; wishing to ascertain if this distrust was Monsieur\r\nde Lamotte’s own idea, or had been suggested to him. The movement was so\r\nrapid that neither of the others observed it. Like all knaves, obliged\r\nby their actions to be continually on the watch, Derues possessed to a\r\nremarkable extent the art of seeing all round him without appearing to\r\nobserve anything in particular. He decided that as yet he had only to\r\ncombat a suspicion unfounded on proof, and he waited till he should be\r\nattacked more seriously.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know,\" he said, \"what may have happened during my absence;\r\npray explain yourself, for you are making me share your disquietude.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am exceedingly anxious; I entreat you, tell me the whole truth.\r\nExplain this silence, and this absence prolonged beyond all expectation.\r\nYou finished your business with Madame de Lamotte several days ago: once\r\nagain, why did she not write? There is no letter, either from her or my\r\nson! To-morrow I shall send someone to Paris.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens!\" answered Derues, \"is there nothing but an accident which\r\ncould cause this delay? . . . Well, then,\" he continued, with the\r\nembarrassed look of a man compelled to betray a confidence,—\"well, then,\r\nI see that in order to reassure you, I shall have to give up a secret\r\nentrusted to me.\"\r\n\r\nHe then told Monsieur de Lamotte that his wife was no longer at Paris,\r\nbut at Versailles, where she was endeavouring to obtain an important and\r\nlucrative appointment, and that, if she had left him in ignorance of her\r\nefforts in this direction; it was only to give him an agreeable\r\nsurprise. He added that she had removed her son from the school, and\r\nhoped to place him either in the riding school or amongst the royal\r\npages. To prove his words, he opened his paper-case, and produced the\r\nletter written by Edouard in answer to the one quoted above.\r\n\r\nAll this was related so simply, and with such an appearance of good\r\nfaith, that the cure was quite convinced. And to Monsieur de Lamotte the\r\nplans attributed to his wife were not entirely improbably. Derues had\r\nlearnt indirectly that such a career for Edouard had been actually under\r\nconsideration. However, though Monsieur de Lamotte’s entire ignorance\r\nprevented him from making any serious objection, his fears were not\r\nentirely at rest, but for the present he appeared satisfied with the\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nThe cure resumed the conversation. \"What you tell us ought to drive away\r\ngloomy ideas. Just now, when you were announced, Monsieur de Lamotte was\r\nconfiding his troubles to me. I was as concerned as he was, and I could\r\nsay nothing to help him; never did visitor arrive more apropos. Well, my\r\nfriend, what now remains of your vain terrors? What was it you were\r\nsaying just as Monsieur Derues arrived? . . . Ah! we were discussing\r\ndreams, you asked if I believed in them.\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur, de Lamotte, who had sunk back in his easy-chair and seemed\r\nlost in his reflections, started on hearing these words. He raised his\r\nhead and looked again at Derues. But the latter had had time to note the\r\nimpression produced by the cure’s remark, and this renewed examination\r\ndid not disturb him.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Monsieur de Lamotte, \"I had asked that question.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I was going to answer that there are certain secret warnings which\r\ncan be received by the soul long before they are intelligible to the\r\nbodily senses-revelations not understood at first, but which later\r\nconnect themselves with realities of which they are in some way the\r\nprecursors. Do you agree with me, Monsieur Derues?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no opinion on such a subject, and must leave the discussion to\r\nmore learned people than myself. I do not know whether such apparitions\r\nreally mean anything or not, and I have not sought to fathom these\r\nmysteries, thinking them outside the realm of human intelligence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless,\" said the cure, \"we are obliged to recognise their\r\nexistence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but without either understanding or explaining them, like many\r\nother eternal truths. I follow the rule given in the Imitation o f Jesus\r\nChrist: ’Beware, my son, of considering too curiously the things beyond\r\nthine intelligence.’\"\r\n\r\n\"And I also submit, and avoid too curious consideration. But has not the\r\nsoul knowledge of many wondrous things which we can yet neither see nor\r\ntouch? I repeat, there are things which cannot be denied.\"\r\n\r\nDerues listened attentively, continually on his guard; and afraid, he\r\nknew not why, of becoming entangled in this conversation, as in a trap.\r\nHe carefully watched Monsieur de Lamotte, whose eyes never left him. The\r\ncure resumed—\r\n\r\n\"Here is an instance which I was bound to accept, seeing it happened to\r\nmyself. I was then twenty, and my mother lived in the neighbourhood of\r\nTours, whilst I was at the seminary of Montpellier. After several years\r\nof separation, I had obtained permission to go and see her. I wrote,\r\ntelling her of this good news, and I received her answer—full of joy and\r\ntenderness. My brother and sister were to be informed, it was to be a\r\nfamily meeting, a real festivity; and I started with a light and joyous\r\nheart. My impatience was so great, that, having stopped for supper at a\r\nvillage inn some ten leagues from Tours, I would not wait till the next\r\nmorning for the coach which went that way, but continued the journey on\r\nfoot and walked all night. It was a long and difficult road, but\r\nhappiness redoubled my strength. About an hour after sunrise I saw\r\ndistinctly the smoke and the village roofs, and I hurried on to surprise\r\nmy family a little sooner. I never felt more active, more light-hearted\r\nand gay; everything seemed to smile before and around me. Turning a\r\ncorner of the hedge, I met a peasant whom I recognised. All at once it\r\nseemed as if a veil spread over my sight, all my hopes and joy suddenly\r\nvanished, a funereal idea took possession of me, and I said, taking the\r\nhand of the man, who had not yet spoken—\r\n\r\n\"’My mother is dead, I am convinced my mother is dead!’\r\n\r\n\"He hung down his head and answered—\r\n\r\n\"’She is to be buried this morning!’\r\n\r\n\"Now whence came this revelation? I had seen no one, spoken to no one; a\r\nmoment before I had no idea of it!\"\r\n\r\nDerues made a gesture of surprise. Monsieur de Lamotte put his hand to\r\nhis eyes, and said to the cure—\r\n\r\n\"Your presentiments were true; mine, happily, are unfounded. But listen,\r\nand tell me if in the state of anxiety which oppressed me I had not good\r\nreason for alarm and for fearing some fatal misfortune.\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes again sought Derues. \"Towards the middle of last night I at\r\nlength fell asleep, but, interrupted every moment, this sleep was more a\r\nfatigue than a rest; I seemed to hear confused noises all round me. I\r\nsaw brilliant lights which dazzled me, and then sank back into silence\r\nand darkness. Sometimes I heard someone weeping near my bed; again\r\nplaintive voices called to me out of the darkness. I stretched out my\r\narms, but nothing met them, I fought with phantoms; at length a cold\r\nhand grasped mine and led me rapidly forward. Under a dark and damp\r\nvault a woman lay on the ground, bleeding, inanimate—it was my wife! At\r\nthe same moment, a groan made me look round, and I beheld a man striking\r\nmy son with a dagger. I cried out and awoke, bathed in cold\r\nperspiration, panting under this terrible vision. I was obliged to get\r\nup, walk about, and speak aloud, in order to convince myself it was only\r\na dream. I tried to go to sleep again, but the same visions still\r\npursued me. I saw always the same man armed with two daggers streaming\r\nwith blood; I heard always the cries of his two victims. When day came,\r\nI felt utterly broken, worn-out; and this morning, you, my father, could\r\nsee by my despondency what an impression this awful night had made upon\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this recital Derues’ calmness never gave way for a single moment,\r\nand the most skilful physiognomist could only have discovered an\r\nexpression of incredulous curiosity on his countenance.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur le cure’s story,\" said he, \"impressed me much; yours only\r\nbrings back my uncertainty. It is less possible than ever to deliver any\r\nopinion on this serious question of dreams, since the second instance\r\ncontradicts the first.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true,\" answered the cure, \"no possible conclusion can be drawn\r\nfrom two facts which contradict each other, and the best thing we can do\r\nis to choose a less dismal subject of conversation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Derues;\" asked Monsieur de Lamotte, \"if you are not too tired\r\nwith your journey, shall we go and look at the last improvements I have\r\nmade? It is now your affair to decide upon them, since I shall shortly\r\nbe only your guest here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just as I have been yours for long enough, and I trust you will often\r\ngive me the opportunity of exercising hospitality in my turn. But you\r\nare ill, the day is cold and damp; if you do not care to go out, do not\r\nlet me disturb you. Had you not better stay by the fire with Monsieur le\r\ncure? For me, Heaven be thanked! I require no assistance. I will look\r\nround the park, and come back presently to tell you what I think.\r\nBesides, we shall have plenty of time to talk about it. With your\r\npermission, I should like to stay two or three days.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be pleased if you will do so.\"\r\n\r\nDerues went out, sufficiently uneasy in his mind, both on account of his\r\nreception of Monsieur de Lamotte’s fears and of the manner in which the\r\nlatter had watched him during the conversation. He walked quickly up and\r\ndown the park—\r\n\r\n\"I have been foolish, perhaps; I have lost twelve or fifteen days, and\r\ndelayed stupidly from fear of not foreseeing everything. But then, how\r\nwas I to imagine that this simple, easily deceived man would all at once\r\nbecome suspicious? What a strange dream! If I had not been on my guard,\r\nI might have been disconcerted. Come, come, I must try to disperse these\r\nideas and give him something else to think about.\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped, and after a few minutes consideration turned back towards\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had left the room, Monsieur de Lamotte had bent over\r\ntowards the cure, and had said—\r\n\r\n\"He did not show any emotion, did—he?\"\r\n\r\n\"None whatever.\"\r\n\r\n\"He did not start when I spoke of the man armed with those two daggers?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. But put aside these ideas; you must see they are mistaken.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not tell everything, my father: this murderer whom I saw in my\r\ndream—was Derues himself! I know as well as you that it must be a\r\ndelusion, I saw as well as you did that he remained quite calm, but, in\r\nspite of myself, this terrible dream haunts me . . . .There, do not\r\nlisten to me, do not let me talk about it; it only makes me blush for\r\nmyself.\"\r\n\r\nWhilst Derues remained at Buisson-Souef, Monsieur de Lamotte received\r\nseveral letters from his wife, some from Paris, some from Versailles.\r\nShe remarked that her son and herself were perfectly well.... The\r\nwriting was so well imitated that no one could doubt their genuineness.\r\nHowever, Monsieur de Lamotte’s suspicions continually increased and he\r\nended by making the cure share his fears. He also refused to go with\r\nDerues to Paris, in spite of the latter’s entreaties. Derues, alarmed at\r\nthe coldness shown him, left Buisson-Souef, saying that he intended to\r\ntake possession about the middle of spring.\r\n\r\nMonsieur de Lamotte was, in spite of himself, still detained by\r\nill-health. But a new and inexplicable circumstance made him resolve to\r\ngo to Paris and endeavour to clear up the mystery which appeared to\r\nsurround his wife and son. He received an unsigned letter in unknown\r\nhandwriting, and in which Madame de Lamotte’s reputation was attacked\r\nwith a kind of would-be reticence, which hinted that she was an\r\nunfaithful wife and that in this lay the cause of her long absence. Her\r\nhusband did not believe this anonymous denunciation, but the fate of the\r\ntwo beings dearest to him seemed shrouded in so much obscurity that he\r\ncould delay no longer, and started for Paris.\r\n\r\nHis resolution not to accompany Derues had saved his life. The latter\r\ncould not carry out his culminating crime at Buisson-Souef; it was only\r\nin Paris that his victims would disappear without his being called to\r\naccount. Obliged to leave hold of his prey, he endeavoured to bewilder\r\nhim in a labyrinth where all trace of truth might be lost. Already, as\r\nhe had arranged beforehand, he had called calumny to his help, and\r\nprepared the audacious lie which was to vindicate himself should an\r\naccusation fall upon his head. He had hoped that Monsieur de Lamotte\r\nwould fall defenceless into his hands; but now a careful examination of\r\nhis position, showing the impossibility of avoiding an explanation had\r\nbecome inevitable, made him change all his plans, and compelled him to\r\ndevise an infernal plot, so skilfully laid that it bid fair to defeat\r\nall human sagacity.\r\n\r\nMonsieur de Lamotte arrived in Paris early in March. Chance decided that\r\nhe should lodge in the rue de la Mortellerie, in a house not far from\r\nthe one where his wife’s body lay buried. He went to see Derues, hoping\r\nto surprise him, and determined to make him speak, but found he was not\r\nat home. Madame Derues, whether acting with the discretion of an\r\naccomplice or really ignorant of her husband’s proceedings, could not\r\nsay where he was likely to be found. She said that he told her nothing\r\nabout his actions, and that Monsieur de Lamotte must have observed\r\nduring their stay at Buisson (which was true) that she never questioned\r\nhim, but obeyed his wishes in everything; and that he had now gone away\r\nwithout saying where he was going. She acknowledged that Madame de\r\nLamotte had lodged with them for six weeks, and that she knew that lady\r\nhad been at Versailles, but since then she had heard nothing. All\r\nMonsieur de Lamotte’s questions, his entreaties, prayers, or threats,\r\nobtained no other answer. He went to the lawyer in the rue de Paon, to\r\nthe schoolmaster, and found the same uncertainty, the same ignorance.\r\nHis wife and his son had gone to Versailles, there the clue ended which\r\nought to guide his investigations. He went to this town; no one could\r\ngive him any information, the very name of Lamotte was unknown. He\r\nreturned to Paris, questioned and examined the people of the quarter,\r\nthe proprietor of the Hotel de France, where his wife had stayed on her\r\nformer visit; at length, wearied with useless efforts, he implored help\r\nfrom justice. Then his complaints ceased; he was advised to maintain a\r\nprudent silence, and to await Derues’ return.\r\n\r\nThe latter thoroughly understood that, having failed to dissipate\r\nMonsieur de Lamotte’s fears, there was no longer an instant to lose, and\r\nthat the pretended private contract of February 12th would not of itself\r\nprove the existence of Madame de Lamotte. This is how he employed the\r\ntime spent by the unhappy husband in fruitless investigation.\r\n\r\nOn March 12th, a woman, her face hidden in the hood of her cloak, or\r\n\"Therese,\" as it was then called, appeared in the office of Maitre N——-,\r\na notary at Lyons. She gave her name as Marie Francoise Perffier, wife\r\nof Monsieur Saint-Faust de Lamotte, but separated, as to goods and\r\nestate, from him. She caused a deed to be drawn up, authorising her\r\nhusband to receive the arrears of thirty thousand livres remaining from\r\nthe price of the estate of Buisson-Souef, situated near\r\nVilleneuve-le-Roi-lez-Sens. The deed was drawn up and signed by Madame\r\nde Lamotte, by the notary, and one of his colleagues.\r\n\r\nThis woman was Derues. If we remember that he only arrived at Buisson\r\nFebruary 28th, and remained there for some days, it becomes difficult to\r\nunderstand how at that period so long a journey as that from Paris to\r\nLyons could have been accomplished with such rapidity. Fear must have\r\ngiven him wings. We will now explain what use he intended to make of it,\r\nand what fable, a masterpiece of cunning and of lies, he had invented.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival in Paris he found a summons to appear before the\r\nmagistrate of police. He expected this, and appeared quite tranquil,\r\nready to answer any questions. Monsieur de Lamotte was present. It was a\r\nformal examination, and the magistrate first asked why he had left\r\nParis.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur,\" replied Derues, \"I have nothing to hide, and none of my\r\nactions need fear the daylight, but before replying, I should like to\r\nunderstand my position. As a domiciled citizen I have a right to require\r\nthis. Will you kindly inform me why I have been summoned to appear\r\nbefore you, whether on account of anything personal to myself, or simply\r\nto give information as to something which may be within my knowledge?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are acquainted with this gentleman, and cannot therefore be\r\nignorant of the cause of the present inquiry.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am, nevertheless, quite in ignorance of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be good enough to answer my question. Why did you leave Paris? And\r\nwhere have you been?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was absent for business reasons.\"\r\n\r\n\"What business?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall say no more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take care! you have incurred serious suspicions, and silence will not\r\ntend to clear you.\"\r\n\r\nDerues hung down his head with an air of resignation; and Monsieur de\r\nLamotte, seeing in this attitude a silent confession of crime,\r\nexclaimed, \"Wretched man! what have you done with my wife and my son?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your son!—\" said Derues slowly and with peculiar emphasis. He again\r\ncast down his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe magistrate conducting the inquiry was struck by the expression of\r\nDerues’ countenance and by this half answer, which appeared to hide a\r\nmystery and to aim at diverting attention by offering a bait to\r\ncuriosity. He might have stopped Derues at the moment when he sought to\r\nplunge into a tortuous argument, and compelled him to answer with the\r\nsame clearness and decision which distinguished Monsieur de Lamotte’s\r\nquestion; but he reflected that the latter’s inquiries, unforeseen,\r\nhasty, and passionate, were perhaps more likely to disconcert a prepared\r\ndefence than cooler and more skilful tactics. He therefore changed his\r\nplans, contenting \"himself for the moment with the part of an observer\r\nonly, and watching a duel between two fairly matched antagonists.\r\n\r\n\"I require: you to tell me what has become of them,\" repeated Monsieur\r\nde Lamotte. \"I have been to Versailles, you assured me they were there.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I told you the truth, monsieur.\"\r\n\r\n\"No one has seen them, no one knows them; every trace is lost. Your\r\nHonour, this man must be compelled to answer, he must say what has\r\nbecome of my wife and son!\"\r\n\r\n\"I excuse your anxiety, I understand your trouble, but why appeal to me?\r\nWhy am I supposed to know what may have happened to them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I confided them to your care.\"\r\n\r\n\"As a friend, yes, I agree. Yes, it is quite true that last December I\r\nreceived a letter from you informing me of the impending arrival of your\r\nwife and son. I received them in my own house, and showed them the same\r\nhospitality which I had received from you. I saw them both, your son\r\noften, your wife every day, until the day she left me to go to\r\nVersailles. Yes, I also took Edouard to his mother, who was negotiating\r\nan appointment for him. I have already told you all this, and I repeat\r\nit because it is the truth. You believed me then: why do you not believe\r\nme now? Why has what I say become strange and incredible? If your wife\r\nand your son have disappeared, am I responsible? Did you transmit your\r\nauthority to me? And now, in what manner are you thus calling me to\r\naccount? Is it to the friend who might have pitied, who might have aided\r\nyour search, that you thus address yourself? Have you come to confide in\r\nme, to ask for advice, for consolation? No, you accuse me; very well!\r\nthen I refuse to speak, because, having no proofs, you yet accuse an\r\nhonest man; because your fears, whether real or imaginary, do not excuse\r\nyou for casting, I know not what odious suspicions, on a blameless\r\nreputation, because I have the right to be offended. Monsieur\" he\r\ncontinued, turning to the magistrate, \"I believe you will appreciate my\r\nmoderation, and will allow me to retire. If charges are brought against\r\nme, I am quite ready to meet them, and to show what they are really\r\nworth. I shall remain in Paris, I have now no business which requires my\r\npresence elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\nHe emphasised these last words, evidently intending to draw attention to\r\nthem. It did not escape the magistrate, who inquired—\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing beyond my words, your Honour, Have I your permission to\r\nretire?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, remain; you are pretending not to understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not understand these insinuations so covertly made.\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur de Lamotte rose, exclaiming—\r\n\r\n\"Insinuations! What more can I say to compel you to answer? My wife and\r\nson have disappeared. It is untrue that, as you pretend, they have been\r\nat Versailles. You deceived me at Buisson-Souef, just as you are\r\ndeceiving me now, as you are endeavouring to deceive justice by\r\ninventing fresh lies. Where are they? What has become of them? I am\r\ntormented by all the fears possible to a husband and father; I imagine\r\nall the most terrible misfortunes, and I accuse you to your face of\r\nhaving caused their death! Is this sufficient, or do you still accuse me\r\nof covert insinuations?\"\r\n\r\nDerues turned to the magistrate. \"Is this charge enough to place me in\r\nthe position of a criminal if I do not give a satisfactory explanation?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly; you should have thought of that sooner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" he continued, addressing Monsieur de Lamotte, \"I understand you\r\npersist in this odious accusation?\"\r\n\r\n\"I certainly persist in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have forgotten our friendship, broken all bonds between us: I am in\r\nyour eyes only a miserable assassin? You consider my silence as guilty,\r\nyou will ruin me if I do not speak?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is still time for reflection; consider what you are doing; I will\r\nforget your insults and your anger. Your trouble is great enough without\r\nmy reproaches being added to it. But you desire that I should speak, you\r\ndesire it absolutely?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do desire it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then; it shall be as you wish.\"\r\n\r\nDerues surveyed Monsieur de Lamotte with a look which seemed to say, \"I\r\npity you.\" He then added, with a sigh—\r\n\r\n\"I am now ready to answer. Your Honour, will you have the kindness to\r\nresume my examination?\"\r\n\r\nDerues had succeeded in taking up an advantageous position. If he had\r\nbegun narrating the extraordinary romance he had invented, the least\r\npenetrating eye must have perceived its improbability, and one would\r\nhave felt it required some support at every turn. But since he had\r\nresisted being forced to tell it, and apparently only ceded to Monsieur\r\nde Lamotte’s violent persistency, the situation was changed; and this\r\nrefusal to speak, coming from a man who thereby compromised his personal\r\nsafety, took the semblance of generosity, and was likely to arouse the\r\nmagistrate’s curiosity and prepare his mind for unusual and mysterious\r\nrevelations. This was exactly what Derues wanted, and he awaited the\r\ninterrogation with calm and tranquillity.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you leave Paris?\" the magistrate demanded a second time.\r\n\r\n\"I have already had the honour to inform you that important business\r\nnecessitated my absence.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you refused to explain the nature of this business. Do you still\r\npersist in this refusal?\"\r\n\r\n\"For the moment, yes. I will explain it later.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where have you been? Whence do you return?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have been to Lyons, and have returned thence.\"\r\n\r\n\"What took you there?\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you later.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the month of December last, Madame de Lamotte and her son came to\r\nParis?\r\n\r\n\"That is so.\"\r\n\r\n\"They both lodged in your house?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no reason to deny it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But neither she herself, nor Monsieur de Lamotte, had at first intended\r\nthat she should accept a lodging in the house which you occupied.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is quite true. We had important accounts to settle, and Madame de\r\nLamotte told me afterwards that she feared some dispute on the question\r\nof money might arise between us—at least, that is the reason she gave\r\nme. She was mistaken, as the event proved, since I always intended to\r\npay, and I have paid. But she may have had another reason which she\r\npreferred not to give.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was the distrust of this man which she felt,\" exclaimed Monsieur de\r\nLamotte. Derues answered only with a melancholy smile.\r\n\r\n\"Silence, monsieur,\" said the magistrate, \"silence; do not interrupt.\"\r\nThen addressing Derues—\r\n\r\n\"Another motive? What motive do you suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly she preferred to be more free, and able to receive any visitor\r\nshe wished.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is only supposition on my part, I do not insist upon it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the supposition appears to contain a hint injurious to Madame de\r\nLamotte’s reputation?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, oh no!\" replied Derues, after a moment’s silence.\r\n\r\nThis sort of insinuation appeared strange to the magistrate, who\r\nresolved to try and force Derues to abandon these treacherous reticences\r\nbehind which he sheltered himself. Again recommending silence to\r\nMonsieur de Lamotte, he continued to question Derues, not perceiving\r\nthat he was only following the lead skilfully given by the latter, who\r\ndrew him gradually on by withdrawing himself, and that all the time thus\r\ngained was an advantage to the accused.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the magistrate, \"whatever Madame de Lamotte’s motives may\r\nhave been, it ended in her coming to stay with you. How did you persuade\r\nher to take this step?\"\r\n\r\n\"My wife accompanied her first to the Hotel de France, and then to other\r\nhotels. I said no more than might be deemed allowable in a friend; I\r\ncould not presume to persuade her against her will. When I returned\r\nhome, I was surprised to find her there with her son. She could not find\r\na disengaged room in any of the hotels she tried, and she then accepted\r\nmy offer.\"\r\n\r\n\"What date was this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Monday, the 16th of last December.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when did she leave your house?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the 1st of February.\"\r\n\r\n\"The porter cannot remember having seen her go out on that day.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is possible. Madame de Lamotte went and came as her affairs\r\nrequired. She was known, and no more attention would be paid to her than\r\nto any other inmate.\"\r\n\r\n\"The porter also says that for several days before this date she was\r\nill, and obliged to keep her room?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it was a slight indisposition, which had no results, so slight\r\nthat it seemed unnecessary to call in a doctor. Madame de Lamotte\r\nappeared preoccupied and anxious. I think her mental attitude influenced\r\nher health.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you escort her to Versailles?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I went there to see her later.\"\r\n\r\n\"What proof can you give of her having actually stayed there?\"\r\n\r\n\"None whatever, unless it be a letter which I received from her.\"\r\n\r\n\"You told Monsieur de, Lamotte that she was exerting herself to procure\r\nher son’s admission either as a king’s page or into the riding school.\r\nNow, no one at Versailles has seen this lady, or even heard of her.\"\r\n\r\n\"I only repeated what she told me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where was she staying?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! she wrote to you, you went to see her, and yet you do not know\r\nwhere she was lodging?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is so.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is impossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are many things which would appear impossible if I were to relate\r\nthem, but which are true, nevertheless.\"\r\n\r\n\"Explain yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I only received one letter from Madame de Lamotte, in which she spoke\r\nof her plans for Edouard, requesting me to send her her son on a day she\r\nfixed, and I told Edouard of her projects. Not being able to go to the\r\nschool to see him, I wrote, asking if he would like to give up his\r\nstudies and become a royal page. When I was last at Buisson-Souef, I\r\nshowed his answer to Monsieur de Lamotte; it is here.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he handed over a letter to the magistrate, who read it, and passing\r\nit on to Monsieur de Lamotte, inquired—\r\n\r\n\"Did you then, and do you now, recognise your son’s handwriting?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly, monsieur.\"\r\n\r\n\"You took Edouard to Versailles?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"On what day?\"\r\n\r\n\"February 11th, Shrove Tuesday. It is the only time I have been to\r\nVersailles. The contrary might be supposed; for I have allowed it to be\r\nunderstood that I have often seen Madame de Lamotte since she left my\r\nhouse, and was acquainted with all her actions, and that the former\r\nconfidence and friendship still existed between us. In allowing this, I\r\nhave acted a lie, and transgressed the habitual sincerity of my whole\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\nThis assertion produced a bad impression on the magistrate. Derues\r\nperceived it, and to avert evil consequences, hastened to add—\r\n\r\n\"My conduct can only be appreciated when it is known in entirety. I\r\nmisunderstood the meaning of Madame de Lamotte’s letter. She asked me to\r\nsend her her son, I thought to oblige her by accompanying him, and not\r\nleaving him to go alone. So we travelled together, and arrived at\r\nVersailles about midday. As I got down from the coach I saw Madame de\r\nLamotte at the palace gate, and observed, to my astonishment, that my\r\npresence displeased her. She was not alone.\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped, although he had evidently reached the most interesting point\r\nof his story.\r\n\r\n\"Go on,\" said the magistrate; \"why do you stop now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because what I have to say is so painful—not to me, who have to justify\r\nmyself, but for others, that I hesitate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you then interrogate me, please?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what happened in this interview?\"\r\n\r\nDerues appeared to collect himself for a moment, and then said with the\r\nair of a man who has decide on speaking out at last—\r\n\r\n\"Madame de Lamotte was not alone; she was attended by a gentleman whom I\r\ndid not know, whom I never saw either at Buisson-Souef or in Paris, and\r\nwhom I have never seen again since. I will ask you to allow me to\r\nrecount everything; even to the smallest details. This man’s face struck\r\nme at once, on account of a singular resemblance; he paid no attention\r\nto me at first, and I was able to examine him at leisure. His manners\r\nwere those of a man belonging to the highest classes of society, and his\r\ndress indicated wealth. On seeing Edouard, he said to Madame de Lamotte—\r\n\r\n\"’So this is he?’ and he then kissed him tenderly. This and the marks of\r\nundisguised pleasure which he evinced surprised me, and I looked at\r\nMadame de Lamotte, who then remarked with some asperity—\r\n\r\n\"’I did not expect to see you, Monsieur Derues. I had not asked you to\r\naccompany my son.’\r\n\r\n\"Edouard seemed quite as much surprised as I was. The stranger gave me a\r\nlook of haughty annoyance, but seeing I did not avoid his glance his\r\ncountenance assumed a more gentle expression, and Madame de Lamotte\r\nintroduced him as a person who took great interest in Edouard.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a whole tissue of imposture!\" exclaimed Monsieur de Lamotte.\r\n\r\n\"Allow me to finish,\" answered Derues. \"I understand your doubts, and\r\nthat you are not anxious to believe what I say, but I have been brought\r\nhere by legal summons to tell the truth, and I am going to tell it. You\r\ncan then weigh the two accusations in the balance, and choose between\r\nthem. The reputation of an honourable man is as sacred, as important, as\r\nworthy of credit as the reputation of a woman, and I never heard that\r\nthe virtue of the one was more fragile than that of the other.\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur de Lamotte, thunderstruck by such a revelation, could not\r\ncontain his impatience and indignation.\r\n\r\n\"This, then,\" he said, \"is the explanation of an anonymous letter which\r\nI received, and of the injurious suggestions’ concerning my wife’s\r\nhonour which it contained; it was written to give an appearance of\r\nprobability to this infamous legend. The whole thing is a disgraceful\r\nplot, and no doubt Monsieur Derues wrote the letter himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know nothing about it,\" said Derues unconcernedly, \"and the\r\nexplanation which you profess to find in it I should rather refer to\r\nsomething else I am going to mention. I did not know a secret warning\r\nhad been sent to you: I now learn it from you, and I understand\r\nperfectly that such a letter, may have been written. But that you have\r\nreceived such a warning ought surely to be a reason for listening\r\npatiently and not denouncing all I say as imposture.\"\r\n\r\nWhile saying this Derues mentally constructed the fresh falsehood\r\nnecessitated by the interruption, but no variation of countenance\r\nbetrayed his thought. He had an air of dignity natural to his position.\r\nHe saw that, in spite of clear-headedness and long practice in studying\r\nthe most deceptive countenances, the magistrate so far had not scented\r\nany of his falsehoods, and was getting bewildered in the windings of\r\nthis long narrative, through which Derues led him as he chose; and he\r\nresumed with confidence—\r\n\r\n\"You know that I made Monsieur de Lamotte’s acquaintance more than a\r\nyear ago, and I had reason to believe his friendship as sincere as my\r\nown. As a friend, I could not calmly accept the suspicion which then\r\nentered my mind, nor could I conceal my surprise. Madame de Lamotte saw\r\nthis, and understood from my looks that I was not satisfied with the\r\nexplanation she wished me to accept. A glance of intelligence passed\r\nbetween her and her friend, who was still holding Edouard’s hand. The\r\nday, though cold, was fine, and she proposed a walk in the park. I\r\noffered her my arm, and the stranger walked in front with Edouard. We\r\nhad a short conversation, which has remained indelibly fixed in my\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\n\"’Why did you come?’ she inquired.\r\n\r\n\"I did not answer, but looked sternly at her, in order to discompose\r\nher. At length I said—\r\n\r\n\"’You should have written, madame, and warned me that my coming would be\r\nindiscreet.’\r\n\r\n\"She seemed much disconcerted, and exclaimed—\r\n\r\n\"’I am lost! I see you guess everything, and will tell my husband. I am\r\nan unhappy woman, and a sin once committed can never be erased from the\r\npages of a woman’s life! Listen, Monsieur Derues, listen, I implore you!\r\nYou see this man, I shall not tell you who he is, I shall not give his\r\nname . . . but I loved him long ago; I should have been his wife, and\r\nhad he not been compelled to leave France, I should have married no one\r\nelse.’\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur de Lamotte started, and grew pale.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" the magistrate inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! this dastardly wretch is profiting by his knowledge of secrets\r\nwhich a long intimacy has enabled him to discover. Do not believe him, I\r\nentreat you, do not believe him!\"\r\n\r\nDerues resumed. \"Madame de Lamotte continued: ’I saw him again sixteen\r\nyears ago, always in hiding, always proscribed. To-day he reappears\r\nunder a name which is not his own: he wishes to link my fate with his;\r\nhe has insisted on seeing Edouard. But I shall escape him. I have\r\ninvented this fiction of placing my son among the, royal pages to\r\naccount for my stay here. Do not contradict me, but help me; for a\r\nlittle time ago I met one of Monsieur de Lamotte’s friends, I am afraid\r\nhe suspected something. Say you have seen me several times; as you have\r\ncome, let it be known that you brought Edouard here. I shall return to\r\nBuisson as soon as possible, but will you go first, see my husband,\r\nsatisfy him if he is anxious? I am in your hands; my honour, my\r\nreputation, my very life, are at your mercy; you can either ruin or help\r\nto save me. I may be guilty, but I am not corrupt. I have wept for my\r\nsin day after day, and I have already cruelly expiated it.’\"\r\n\r\nThis execrable calumny was not related without frequent interruptions on\r\nthe part of Monsieur de Lamotte. He was, however, obliged to own to\r\nhimself that it was quite true that Marie Perier had really been\r\npromised to a man whom an unlucky affair had driven into exile, and whom\r\nhe had supposed to be dead. This revelation, coming from Derues, who had\r\nthe strongest interest in lying, by no means convinced him of his wife’s\r\ndishonour, nor destroyed the feelings of a husband and father; but\r\nDerues was not speaking for him lone, and what appeared incredible to\r\nMonsieur de Lamotte might easily seem less improbable to the colder and\r\nless interested judgment of the magistrate.\r\n\r\n\"I was wrong,\" Derues continued, \"in allowing myself to be touched by\r\nher tears, wrong in believing in her repentance, more wrong still in\r\ngoing to Buisson to satisfy her husband. But I only consented on\r\nconditions: Madame de Lamotte promised me to return shortly to Paris,\r\nvowing that her son should never know the truth, and that the rest of\r\nher life should be devoted to atoning for her sin by a boundless\r\ndevotion. She then begged me to leave her, and told me she would write\r\nto me at Paris to fix the day of her return. This is what happened, and\r\nthis is why I went to Buissan and gave my support to a lying fiction.\r\nWith one word I might have destroyed the happiness of seventeen years. I\r\ndid not wish to do so. I believed in the remorse; I believe in it still,\r\nin spite of all appearances; I have refused to speak this very day, and\r\nmade every effort to prolong an illusion which I know it will be\r\nterrible to lose.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of silence. This fable, so atrociously ingenious, was\r\nsimply and impressively narrated, and with an air of candour well\r\ncontrived to impose on the magistrate, or, at least, to suggest grave\r\ndoubts to his mind. Derues, with his usual cunning, had conformed his\r\nlanguage to the quality of his listener. Any tricks, profession of\r\npiety, quotations from sacred books, so largely indulged in when he\r\nwished to bamboozle people of a lower class, would here have told\r\nagainst him. He knew when to abstain, and carried the art of deception\r\nfar enough to be able to lay aside the appearance of hypocrisy. He had\r\ndescribed all the circumstances without affectation, and if this\r\nunexpected accusation was wholly unproved, it yet rested on a possible\r\nfact, and did not appear absolutely incredible. The magistrate went\r\nthrough it all again, and made him repeat every detail, without being\r\nable to make him contradict himself or show the smallest embarrassment.\r\nWhile interrogating Derues, he kept his eyes fixed upon him; and this\r\ndouble examination being quite fruitless, only increased his perplexity.\r\nHowever, he never relaxed the incredulous severity of his demeanour, nor\r\nthe imperative and threatening tone of his voice.\r\n\r\n\"You acknowledge having been at Lyons?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I have been there.\"\r\n\r\n\"At the beginning of this examination you said you would explain the\r\nreason of this journey later.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am ready to do so, for the journey is connected with the facts I have\r\njust narrated; it was caused by them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Explain it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I again ask permission to relate fully. I did not hear from Versailles:\r\nI began to fear Monsieur de Lamotte’s anxiety would bring him to Paris.\r\nBound by the promise I had made to his wife to avert all suspicion and\r\nto satisfy any doubts he might conceive, and, must I add, also\r\nremembering that it was important for me to inform him of our new\r\narrangements, and of this payment of a hundred thousand livres.\"\r\n\r\n\"That payment is assuredly fictitious,\" interrupted Monsieur de Lamotte;\r\n\"we must have some proof of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will prove it presently,\" answered Derues. \"So I went to Buisson, as\r\nI have already told you. On my return I found a letter from Madame de\r\nLamotte, a letter with a Paris stamp, which had arrived that morning. I\r\nwas surprised that she should write, when actually in Paris; I opened\r\nthe letter, and was still more surprised. I have not the letter with me,\r\nbut I recollect the sense of it perfectly, if not the wording, and I can\r\nproduce it if necessary. Madame de Lamotte was at Lyons with her son and\r\nthis person whose name I do not know, and whom I do not care to mention\r\nbefore her husband. She had confided this letter to a person who was\r\ncoming to Paris, and who was to bring it me; but this individual, whose\r\nname was Marquis, regretted that having to start again immediately, he\r\nwas obliged to entrust it to the post. This is the sense of its\r\ncontents. Madame de Lamotte wrote that she found herself obliged to\r\nfollow this nameless person to Lyons; and she begged me to send her news\r\nof her husband and of the state of his affairs, but said not one single\r\nword of any probable return. I became very uneasy at the news of this\r\nclandestine departure. I had no security except a private contract\r\nannulling our first agreement on the payment of one hundred thousand\r\nlivres, and that this was not a sufficient and regular receipt I knew,\r\nbecause the lawyer had already refused to surrender Monsieur de\r\nLamotte’s power of attorney. I thought over all the difficulties which\r\nthis flight, which would have to be kept secret, was likely to produce,\r\nand I started for Lyons without writing or giving any notice of my\r\nintention. I had no information, I did not even know whether Madame de\r\nLamotte was passing by another name, as at Versailles, but chance\r\ndecreed that I met her the very day of my arrival. She was alone, and\r\ncomplained bitterly of her fate, saying she had been compelled to follow\r\nthis individual to Lyons, but that very soon she would be free and would\r\nreturn to Paris. But I was struck by the uncertainty of her manner, and\r\nsaid I should not leave her without obtaining a deed in proof of our\r\nrecent arrangements. She refused at first, saying it was unnecessary, as\r\nshe would so soon return; but I insisted strongly. I told her I had\r\nalready com promised myself by telling Monsieur de Lamotte that she was\r\nat Versailles, endeavouring to procure an appointment for her son; that\r\nsince she had been compelled to come to Lyons, the same person might\r\ntake her elsewhere, so that she might disappear any day, might leave\r\nFrance without leaving any trace, without any written acknowledgment of\r\nher own dishonour; and that when all these falsehoods were discovered, I\r\nshould appear in the light of an accomplice. I said also that, as she\r\nhad unfortunately lodged in my house in Paris, and had requested me to\r\nremove her son from his school, explanations would be required from me,\r\nand perhaps I should be accused of this double disappearance. Finally, I\r\ndeclared that if she did not give me some proofs of her existence,\r\nwillingly or unwillingly, I would go at once to a magistrate. My\r\nfirmness made her reflect. ’My good Monsieur Derues,’ she said, ’I ask\r\nyour forgiveness for all the trouble I have caused you. I will give you\r\nthis deed to-morrow, to-day it is too late; but come to this same place\r\nto-morrow, and you shall see me again.’ I hesitated, I confess, to let\r\nher go. ’Ah,’ she said, grasping my hands, ’do not suspect me of\r\nintending to deceive you! I swear that I will meet you here at four\r\no’clock. It is enough that I have ruined myself, and perhaps my son,\r\nwithout also entangling you in my unhappy fate. Yes, you are right; this\r\ndeed is important, necessary for you, and you shall have it. But do not\r\nshow yourself here; if you were seen, I might not be able to do what I\r\nought to do. To-morrow you shall see me again, I swear it.’ She then\r\nleft me. The next day, the 12th, of March, I was exact at the\r\nrendezvous, and Madame de Lamotte arrived a moment later. She gave me a\r\ndeed, authorising her husband to receive the arrears of thirty thousand\r\nlivres remaining from the purchase-money of Buisson-Souef. I endeavoured\r\nagain to express my opinion of her conduct; she listened in silence, as\r\nif my words affected her deeply. We were walking together, when she told\r\nme she had some business in a house we were passing, and asked me to\r\nwait for her. I waited more than an hour, and then discovered that this\r\nhouse, like many others in Lyons, had an exit in another street; and I\r\nunderstood that Madame de Lamotte had escaped by this passage, and that\r\nI might wait in vain. Concluding that trying to follow her would be\r\nuseless, and seeing also that any remonstrance would be made in vain, I\r\nreturned to Paris, deciding to say nothing as yet, and to conceal the\r\ntruth as long as possible. I still had hopes, and I did not count on\r\nbeing so soon called on to defend myself: I thought that when I had to\r\nspeak, it would be as a friend, and not as an accused person. This, sir,\r\nis the explanation of my conduct, and I regret that this justification,\r\nso easy for myself, should be so cruelly painful for another. You have\r\nseen the efforts which I made to defer it.\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur de Lamotte had heard this second part of Derues’ recital with a\r\nmore silent indignation, not that he admitted its probability, but he\r\nwas confounded by this monstrous imposture, and, as it were,\r\nterror-stricken by such profound hypocrisy. His mind revolted at the\r\nidea of his wife being accused of adultery; but while he repelled this\r\ncharge with decision, he saw the confirmation of his secret terrors and\r\npresentiments, and his heart sank within him at the prospect of\r\nexploring this abyss of iniquity. He was pale, gasping for breath, as\r\nthough he himself had been the criminal, while scorching tears furrowed\r\nhis cheeks. He tried to speak, but his voice failed; he wanted to fling\r\nback at Derues the names of traitor and assassin, and he was obliged to\r\nbear in silence the look of mingled grief and pity which the latter\r\nbestowed upon him.\r\n\r\nThe magistrate, calmer, and master of his emotions, but tolerably\r\nbewildered in this labyrinth of cleverly connected lies, thought it\r\ndesirable to ask some further questions.\r\n\r\n\"How,\" said he, \"did you obtain this sum of a hundred thousand livres\r\nwhich you say you paid over to Madame de Lamotte?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have been engaged in business for several years, and have acquired\r\nsome fortune.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, you have postponed the obligation of making this payment\r\nseveral times, so that Monsieur de Lamotte had begun to feel uneasiness\r\non the subject. This was the chief reason of his wife’s coming to\r\nParis.\"\r\n\r\n\"One sometimes experiences momentary difficulties, which presently\r\ndisappear.\"\r\n\r\n\"You say you have a deed given you at Lyons by Madame de Lamotte, which\r\nyou were to give to her husband?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is here.\"\r\n\r\nThe magistrate examined the deed carefully, and noted the name of the\r\nlawyer in whose office it had been drawn up.\r\n\r\n\"You may go,\" he said at last.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed Monsieur de Lamotte.\r\n\r\nDerues stopped, but the magistrate signed to him to go, intimating,\r\nhowever, that he was on no account to leave Paris.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Monsieur de Lamotte, when they were alone, \"this man is\r\nindeed guilty. My wife has not betrayed me! She!—forget her duties as a\r\nwife! she was virtue incarnate! Ah! I assure you these terrible\r\ncalumnies are invented to conceal double crime! I throw myself at your\r\nfeet,—I implore your justice!\"\r\n\r\n\"Rise, monsieur. This is only a preliminary examination, and I confess\r\nthat, so far, he comes well out of it, for imagination can hardly\r\nunderstand such a depth of deceit. I watched him closely the whole time,\r\nand I could discover no sign of alarm, no contradiction, in either face\r\nor language; if guilty, he must be the greatest hypocrite that ever\r\nexisted. But I shall neglect nothing: if a criminal is allowed to\r\nflatter himself with impunity, he frequently forgets to be prudent, and\r\nI have seen many betray themselves when they thought they had nothing to\r\nfear. Patience, and trust to the justice of both God and man.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral days passed, and Derues flattered him self the danger was over:\r\nhis every action mean while was most carefully watched, but so that he\r\nremained unaware of the surveillance. A police officer named Mutel,\r\ndistinguished for activity and intelligence beyond his fellows, was\r\ncharged with collecting information and following any trail. All his\r\nbloodhounds were in action, and hunted Paris thoroughly, but could trace\r\nnothing bearing on the fate of Madame de Lamotte and her son. Mutel,\r\nhowever, soon discovered that in the rue Saint Victor, Derues had\r\nfailed—three successive times, that he had been pursued by numerous\r\ncreditors, and been often near imprisonment for debt, and that in 1771\r\nhe had been publicly accused of incendiarism. He reported on these\r\nvarious circumstances, and then went himself to Derues’ abode, where he\r\nobtained no results. Madame Derues declared that she knew nothing\r\nwhatever, and the police, having vainly searched the whole house, had to\r\nretire. Derues himself was absent; when he returned he found another\r\norder to appear before the magistrate.\r\n\r\nHis first success had encouraged him. He appeared before the magistrate\r\naccompanied by a lawyer and full of confidence, complaining loudly that\r\nthe police, in searching during his absence, had offended against the\r\nrights of a domiciled burgess, and ought to have awaited his return.\r\nAffecting a just indignation at Monsieur de Lamotte’s conduct towards\r\nhim, he presented a demand that the latter should be declared a\r\ncalumniator, and should pay damages for the injury caused to his\r\nreputation. But this time his effrontery and audacity were of little\r\navail, the magistrate easily detected him in flagrant lies. He declared\r\nat first that he had paid the hundred thousand livres with his own money\r\nbut when reminded of his various bankruptcies, the claims of his\r\ncreditors, and the judgments obtained against him as an insolvent\r\ndebtor, he made a complete volte-face, and declared he had borrowed the\r\nmoney from an advocate named Duclos, to whom he had given a bond in\r\npresence of a notary. In spite of all his protestations, the magistrate\r\ncommitted him to solitary confinement at Fort l’Eveque.\r\n\r\nAs yet, nothing was publicly known; but vague reports and gossip,\r\ncarried from shop to shop, circulated among the people, and began to\r\nreach the higher classes of society. The infallible instinct which is\r\naroused among the masses is truly marvellous; a great crime is\r\ncommitted, which seems at first likely to defeat justice, and the public\r\nconscience is aroused. Long before the tortuous folds which envelop the\r\nmystery can be penetrated, while it is still sunk in profound obscurity,\r\nthe voice of the nation, like an excited hive, buzzes around the secret;\r\nthough the magistrates doubt, the public curiosity fixes itself, and\r\nnever leaves go; if the criminal’s hiding-place is changed, it follows\r\nthe track, points it out, descries it in the gloom. This is what\r\nhappened on the news of Derues’ arrest. The affair was everywhere\r\ndiscussed, although the information was incomplete, reports inexact, and\r\nno real publicity to be obtained. The romance which Derues had invented\r\nby way of defence, and which became known as well as Monsieur de\r\nLamotte’s accusation, obtained no credence whatever; on the contrary,\r\nall the reports to his discredit were eagerly adopted. As yet, no crime\r\ncould be traced, but the public presentiment divined an atrocious one.\r\nHave we not often seen similar agitations? The names of Bastide, of\r\nCastaing, of Papavoine, had hardly been pronounced before they\r\ncompletely absorbed all the public attention, and this had to be\r\nsatisfied, light had to be thrown on the darkness: society demanded\r\nvengeance.\r\n\r\nDerues felt some alarm in his dungeon, but his presence of mind and his\r\ndissimulation in no wise deserted him, and he swore afresh every day to\r\nthe truth of his statements. But his last false assertion turned against\r\nhim: the bond for a hundred thousand livres which he professed to have\r\ngiven to Duclos was a counterfeit which Duclos had annulled by a sort of\r\ncounter declaration made the same day. Another circumstance, intended to\r\nensure his safety, only redoubled suspicion. On April 8th, notes payable\r\nto order to the amount of seventy-eight thousand livres, were received\r\nby Monsieur de Lamotte’s lawyer, as if coming from Madame de Lamotte. It\r\nappeared extraordinary that these notes, which arrived in an ordinary\r\nstamped envelope, should not be accompanied by any letter of advice, and\r\nsuspicion attached to Madame Derues, who hitherto had remained\r\nunnoticed. An inquiry as to where the packet had been posted soon\r\nrevealed the office, distinguished by a letter of the alphabet, and the\r\npostmaster described a servant-maid who had brought the letter and paid\r\nfor it. The description resembled the Derues’ servant; and this girl,\r\nmuch alarmed, acknowledged, after a great deal of hesitation, that she\r\nhad posted the letter in obedience to her mistress’s orders. Whereupon\r\nMadame Derues was sent as a prisoner to Fort l’Eveque, and her husband\r\ntransferred to the Grand-Chatelet. On being interrogated, she at length\r\nowned that she had sent these notes to Monsieur de Lamotte’s lawyer, and\r\nthat her husband had given them her in an envelope hidden in the soiled\r\nlinen for which she had brought him clean in exchange.\r\n\r\nAll this certainly amounted to serious presumptive evidence of guilt,\r\nand if Derues had shown himself to the multitude, which followed every\r\nphase of the investigation with increasing anxiety, a thousand arms\r\nwould have willingly usurped the office of the executioner; but the\r\ndistance thence to actual proof of murder was enormous for the\r\nmagistracy. Derues maintained his tranquillity, always asserting that\r\nMadame de Lamotte and her son were alive, and would clear him by their\r\nreappearance. Neither threats nor stratagems succeeded in making him\r\ncontradict himself, and his assurance shook the strongest conviction. A\r\nnew difficulty was added to so much uncertainty.\r\n\r\nA messenger had been sent off secretly with all haste to Lyons; his\r\nreturn was awaited for a test which it was thought would be decisive.\r\n\r\nOne morning Derues was fetched from his prison and taken to a lower hall\r\nof the Conciergerie. He received no answers to the questions addressed\r\nto his escort, and this silence showed him the necessity of being on his\r\nguard and preserving his imperturbable demeanour whatever might happen.\r\nOn arriving, he found the commissioner of police, Mutel, and some other\r\npersons. The hall being very dark, had been illuminated with several\r\ntorches, and Derues was so placed that the light fell strongly on his\r\nface, and was then ordered to look towards a particular part of the\r\nhall. As he did so, a door opened, and a man entered. Derues beheld him\r\nwith indifference, and seeing that the stranger was observing him\r\nattentively, he bowed to him as one might bow to an unknown person whose\r\ncuriosity seems rather unusual.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to detect the slightest trace of emotion, a hand\r\nplaced on his heart would not have felt an increased pulsation, yet this\r\nstranger’s recognition would be fatal!\r\n\r\nMutel approached the new-comer and whispered—\r\n\r\n\"Do you recognise him?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I do not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have the kindness to leave the room for a moment; we will ask you to\r\nreturn immediately.\"\r\n\r\nThis individual was the lawyer in whose office at Lyons the deed had\r\nbeen drawn up which Derues had signed, disguised as a woman, and under\r\nthe name of Marie-Francoise Perier, wife of the Sieur de Lamotte.\r\n\r\nA woman’s garments were brought in, and Derues was ordered to put them\r\non, which he did readily, affecting much amusement. As he was assisted\r\nto disguise himself, he laughed, stroked his chin and assumed mincing\r\nairs, carrying effrontery so far as to ask for a mirror.\r\n\r\n\"I should like to see if it is becoming,\" he said; \"perhaps I might make\r\nsome conquests.\"\r\n\r\nThe lawyer returned: Derues was made to pass before him, to sit at a\r\ntable, sign a paper, in fact to repeat everything it was imagined he\r\nmight have said or done in the lawyer’s office. This second attempt at\r\nidentification succeeded no better than the first. The lawyer hesitated;\r\nthen, understanding all the importance of his deposition, he refused to\r\nswear to anything, and finally declared that this was not the person who\r\nhad come to him at Lyons.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry, sir,\" said Derues, as they removed him, \"that you should\r\nhave been troubled by having to witness this absurd comedy. Do not blame\r\nme for it; but ask Heaven to enlighten those who do not fear to accuse\r\nme. As for me, knowing that my innocence will shortly be made clear, I\r\npardon them henceforth.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough justice at this period was generally expeditious, and the lives\r\nof accused persons were by no means safe-guarded as they now are, it was\r\nimpossible to condemn Derues in the absence of any positive proofs of\r\nguilt. He knew this, and waited patiently in his prison for the moment\r\nwhen he should triumph over the capital accusation which weighed against\r\nhim. The storm no longer thundered over his head, the most terrible\r\ntrials were passed, the examinations became less frequent, and there\r\nwere no more surprises to dread. The lamentations of Monsieur de Lamotte\r\nwent to the hearts of the magistrates, but his certainty could not\r\nestablish theirs, and they pitied, but could not avenge him. In certain\r\nminds a sort of reaction favourable to the prisoner began to set in.\r\nAmong the dupes of Derues’ seeming piety, many who at first held their\r\npeace under these crushing accusations returned to their former opinion.\r\nThe bigots and devotees, all who made a profession of kneeling in the\r\nchurches, of publicly crossing themselves and dipping their fingers in\r\nthe holy water, and who lived on cant and repetitions of \"Amen\" and\r\n\"Alleluia,\" talked of persecution, of martyrdom, until Derues nearly\r\nbecame a saint destined by the Almighty to find canonisation in a\r\ndungeon. Hence arose quarrels and arguments; and this abortive trial,\r\nthis unproved accusation, kept the public imagination in a constant\r\nferment.\r\n\r\nTo the greater part of those who talk of the \"Supreme Being,\" and who\r\nexpect His intervention in human affairs, \"Providence\" is only a word,\r\nsolemn and sonorous, a sort of theatrical machine which sets all right\r\nin the end, and which they glorify with a few banalities proceeding from\r\nthe lips, but not from the heart. It is true that this unknown and\r\nmysterious Cause which we call \"God\" or \"Chance\" often appears so\r\nexceedingly blind and deaf that one may be permitted to wonder whether\r\ncertain crimes are really set apart for punishment, when so many others\r\napparently go scot-free. How many murders remain buried in the night of\r\nthe tomb! how many outrageous and avowed crimes have slept peacefully in\r\nan insolent and audacious prosperity! We know the names of many\r\ncriminals, but who can tell the number of unknown and forgotten victims?\r\nThe history of humanity is twofold, and like that of the invisible\r\nworld, which contains marvels unexplored by the science of the visible\r\none, the history recounted in books is by no means the most curious and\r\nstrange. But without delaying over questions such as these, without\r\nprotesting here against sophistries which cloud the conscience and hide\r\nthe presence of an avenging Deity, we leave the facts to the general\r\njudgment, and have now to relate the last episode in this long and\r\nterrible drama.\r\n\r\nOf all the populous quarters of Paris which commented on the \"affaire\r\nDerues,\" none showed more excitement than that of the Greve, and amongst\r\nall the surrounding streets none could boast more numerous crowds than\r\nthe rue de la Mortellerie. Not that a secret instinct magnetised the\r\ncrowd in the very place where the proof lay buried, but that each day\r\nits attention was aroused by a painful spectacle. A pale and\r\ngrief-stricken man, whose eyes seemed quenched in tears, passed often\r\ndown the street, hardly able to drag himself along; it was Monsieur de\r\nLamotte, who lodged, as we have said, in the rue de la Mortellerie, and\r\nwho seemed like a spectre wandering round a tomb. The crowd made way and\r\nuncovered before him, everybody respected such terrible misfortune, and\r\nwhen he had passed, the groups formed up again, and continued discussing\r\nthe mystery until nightfall.\r\n\r\nOn April 17th, about four in the afternoon, a score of workmen and\r\ngossiping women had collected in front of a shop. A stout woman,\r\nstanding on the lowest step, like an orator in the tribune, held forth\r\nand related for the twentieth time what she knew, or rather, did not\r\nknow. There were listening ears and gaping mouths, even a slight shudder\r\nran through the group; for the widow Masson, discovering a gift of\r\neloquence at the age of sixty, contrived to mingle great warmth and much\r\nindignation in her recital. All at once silence fell on the crowd, and a\r\npassage was made for Monsieur de Lamotte. One man ventured to ask—\r\n\r\n\"Is there anything fresh to-day?\"\r\n\r\nA sad shake of the head was the only answer, and the unhappy man\r\ncontinued his way.\r\n\r\n\"Is that Monsieur de Lamotte?\" inquired a particularly dirty woman,\r\nwhose cap, stuck on the side of her, head, allowed locks of grey hair to\r\nstraggle from under it. \"Ah! is that Monsieur de Lamotte?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me!\" said a neighbour, \"don’t you know him by this time? He passes\r\nevery day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me! I don’t belong to this quarter, and—no offence—but it is not\r\nso beautiful as to bring one out of curiosity! Nothing personal—but it\r\nis rather dirty.\"\r\n\r\nMadame is probably accustomed to use a carriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would suit you better than me, my dear, and would save your having\r\nto buy shoes to keep your feet off the ground!\"\r\n\r\nThe crowd seemed inclined to hustle the speaker,—\r\n\r\n\"Wait a moment!\" she continued, \"I didn’t mean to offend anyone. I am a\r\npoor woman, but there’s no disgrace in that, and I can afford a glass of\r\nliqueur. Eh, good gossip, you understand, don’t you? A drop of the best\r\nfor Mother Maniffret, and if my fine friend there will drink with me to\r\nsettle our difference, I will stand her a glass.\"\r\n\r\nThe example set by the old hawker was contagious, and instead of filling\r\ntwo little glasses only, widow Masson dispensed a bottleful.\r\n\r\n\"Come, you have done well,\" cried Mother Maniffret; \"my idea has brought\r\nyou luck.\"\r\n\r\n\"Faith! not before it was wanted, either!\"\r\n\r\n\"What! are you complaining of trade too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! don’t mention it; it is miserable!\"\r\n\r\n\"There’s no trade at all. I scream myself hoarse all day, and choke\r\nmyself for twopence halfpenny. I don’t know what’s to come of it all.\r\nBut you seem to have a nice little custom.\"\r\n\r\n\"What’s the good of that, with a whole house on one’s hands? It’s just\r\nmy luck; the old tenants go, and the new ones don’t come.\"\r\n\r\n\"What’s the matter, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think the devil’s in it. There was a nice man on the first\r\nfloor-gone; a decent family on the third, all right except that the man\r\nbeat his wife every night, and made such a row that no one could\r\nsleep—gone also. I put up notices—no one even looks at them! A few\r\nmonths ago—it was the middle of December, the day of the last\r\nexecution—\"\r\n\r\n\"The 15th, then,\" said the hawker. \"I cried it, so I know; it’s my\r\ntrade, that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then, the 15th,\" resumed widow Masson. \"On that day, then, I\r\nlet the cellar to a man who said he was a wine merchant, and who paid a\r\nterm in advance, seeing that I didn’t know him, and wouldn’t have lent\r\nhim a farthing on the strength of his good looks. He was a little bit of\r\na man, no taller than that,\"—contemptuously holding out her hand,—\"and\r\nhe had two round eyes which I didn’t like at, all. He certainly paid, he\r\ndid that, but we are more than half through the second term and I have\r\nno news of my tenant.\"\r\n\r\n\"And have you never seen him since?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, once—no, twice. Let’s see—three times, I am sure. He came with a\r\nhand-cart and a commissionaire, and had a big chest taken downstairs—a\r\ncase which he said contained wine in bottles....\r\n\r\n\"No, he came before that, with a workman I think.\r\n\r\n\"Really, I don’t know if it was before or after—doesn’t matter. Anyhow,\r\nit was bottled wine. The third time he brought a mason, and I am sure\r\nthey quarreled. I heard their voices. He carried off the key, and I have\r\nseen neither him nor his wine again. I have another key, and I went down\r\none day; perhaps the rats have drunk the wine and eaten the chest, for\r\nthere certainly is nothing there any more than there is in my hand now.\r\nNevertheless, I saw what I saw. A big chest, very big, quite new, and\r\ncorded all round with strong rope.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, what day was that?\" asked the hawker.\r\n\r\n\"What day? Well, it was—no, I can’t remember.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor I either; I am getting stupid. Let’s have another little\r\nglass-shall we? just to clear our memories!\"\r\n\r\nThe expedient was not crowned with success, the memories failed to\r\nrecover themselves. The crowd waited, attentive, as may be supposed.\r\nSuddenly the hawker exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"What a fool I am! I am going to find that, if only I have still got\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nShe felt eagerly in the pocket of her underskirt, and produced several\r\npieces of dirty, crumpled paper. As she unfolded one after another, she\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n\"A big chest, wasn’t it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, very big.\"\r\n\r\n\"And quite new?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite new.\"\r\n\r\n\"And corded?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I can see it now.\"\r\n\r\n\"So can I, good gracious! It was the day when I sold the history of\r\nLeroi de Valines, the 1st of February.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it was a Saturday; the next day was Sunday.\"\r\n\r\n\"That’s it, that’s it!—Saturday, February 1st. Well, I know that chest\r\ntoo! I met your wine merchant on the Place du Louvre, and he wasn’t\r\nprecisely enjoying himself: one of his creditors wanted to seize the\r\nchest, the wine, the whole kettle of fish! A little man, isn’t he?—a\r\nscarecrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just SO.\"\r\n\r\n\"And has red hair?\"\r\n\r\n\"That’s the man.\"\r\n\r\n\"And looks a hypocrite?\"\r\n\r\n\"You’ve hit it exactly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he is a hypocrite! enough to make one shudder! No doubt he can’t\r\npay his rent! A thief, my dears, a beggarly thief, who set fire to his\r\nown cellar, and who accused me of trying to steal from him, while it was\r\nhe who cheated me, the villain, out of a piece of twenty-four sous. It’s\r\nlucky I turned up here! Well, well, we shall have some fun! Here’s\r\nanother little business on your hands, and you will have to say where\r\nthat wine has got to, my dear gossip Derues.\"\r\n\r\n\"Derues!\" cried twenty voices all at once.\r\n\r\n\"What! Derues who is in Prison?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, that’s Monsieur de Lamotte’s man.\"\r\n\r\n\"The man who killed Madame de Lamotte?\"\r\n\r\n\"The man who made away with her son?\"\r\n\r\n\"A scoundrel, my dears, who accused me of stealing, an absolute\r\nmonster!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is just a little unfortunate,\" said widow Masson, \"that it isn’t the\r\nman. My tenant calls himself Ducoudray. There’s his name on the\r\nregister.\"\r\n\r\n\"Confound it, that doesn’t look like it at all,\" said the hawker: \"now\r\nthat’s a bore! Oh yes, I have a grudge against that thief, who accused\r\nme of stealing. I told him I should sell his history some day. When that\r\nhappens, I’ll treat you all round.\"\r\n\r\nAs a foretaste of the fulfilment of this promise, the company disposed\r\nof a second bottle of liqueur, and, becoming excited, they chattered at\r\nrandom for some time, but at length slowly dispersed, and the street\r\nrelapsed into the silence of night. But, a few hours later, the\r\ninhabitants were surprised to see the two ends occupied by unknown\r\npeople, while other sinister-looking persons patrolled it all night, as\r\nif keeping guard. The next morning a carriage escorted by police stopped\r\nat the widow Masson’s door. An officer of police got out and entered a\r\nneighbouring house, whence he emerged a quarter of an hour later with\r\nMonsieur de Lamotte leaning on his arm. The officer demanded the key of\r\nthe cellar which last December had been hired from the widow Masson by a\r\nperson named Ducoudray, and went down to it with Monsieur de Lamotte and\r\none of his subordinates.\r\n\r\nThe carriage standing at the door, the presence of the commissioner\r\nMutel, the chatter of the previous evening, had naturally roused\r\neverybody’s imagination. But this excitement had to be kept for home\r\nuse: the whole street was under arrest, and its inhabitants were\r\nforbidden to leave their houses. The windows, crammed with anxious\r\nfaces, questioning each other, in the expectation of something\r\nwonderful, were a curious sight; and the ignorance in which they\r\nremained, these mysterious preparations, these orders silently executed,\r\ndoubled the curiosity, and added a sort of terror: no one could see the\r\npersons who had accompanied the police officer; three men remained in\r\nthe carriage, one guarded by the two others. When the heavy coach turned\r\ninto the rue de la Mortellerie, this man had bent towards the closed\r\nwindow and asked—\r\n\r\n\"Where are we?\"\r\n\r\nAnd when they answered him, he said—\r\n\r\n\"I do not know this street; I was never in it.\"\r\n\r\nAfter saying this quite quietly, he asked—\r\n\r\n\"Why am I brought here?\"\r\n\r\nAs no one replied, he resumed his look of indifference, and betrayed no\r\nemotion, neither when the carriage stopped nor when he saw Monsieur de\r\nLamotte enter the widow Masson’s house.\r\n\r\nThe officer reappeared on the threshold, and ordered Derues to be\r\nbrought in.\r\n\r\nThe previous evening, detectives, mingling with the crowd, had listened\r\nto the hawker’s story of having met Derues near the Louvre escorting a\r\nlarge chest. The police magistrate was informed in the course of the\r\nevening. It was an indication, a ray of light, perhaps the actual truth,\r\ndetached from obscurity by chance gossip; and measures were instantly\r\ntaken to prevent anyone either entering or leaving the street without\r\nbeing followed and examined. Mutel thought he was on the track, but the\r\ncriminal might have accomplices also on the watch, who, warned in time,\r\nmight be able to remove the proofs of the crime, if any existed.\r\n\r\nDerues was placed between two men who each held an arm. A third went\r\nbefore, holding a torch. The commissioner, followed by men also carrying\r\ntorches, and provided with spades and pickaxes, came behind, and in this\r\norder they descended to the vault. It was a dismal and terrifying\r\nprocession; anyone beholding these dark and sad countenances, this pale\r\nand resigned man, passing thus into these damp vaults illuminated by the\r\nflickering glare of torches, might well have thought himself the victim\r\nof illusion and watching some gloomy execution in a dream. But all was\r\nreal and when light penetrated this dismal charnel-house it seemed at\r\nonce to illuminate its secret depths, so that the light of truth might\r\nat length penetrate these dark shadows, and that the voice of the dead\r\nwould speak from the earth and the walls.\r\n\r\n\"Wretch!\" exclaimed Monsieur de Lamotte, when he saw Derues appear, \"is\r\nit here that you murdered my wife and my son?\"\r\n\r\nDerues looked calmly at him, and replied—\r\n\r\n\"I beg you, sir, not to add insult to the misfortunes you have already\r\ncaused. If you stood in my place and I were in yours, I should feel some\r\npity and respect for so terrible a position. What do you want me? and\r\nwhy am I brought here?\"\r\n\r\nHe did not know the events of last evening, and could only mentally\r\naccuse the mason who had helped to bury the chest. He felt that he was\r\nlost, but his audacity never forsook him.\r\n\r\n\"You are here, in the first place, to be confronted with this woman,\"\r\nsaid the officer, causing the widow Masson to stand opposite to him.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know her.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I know you, and know you well. It was you who hired this cellar\r\nunder the name of Ducoudray.\"\r\n\r\nDerues shrugged his shoulders and answered bitterly—\r\n\r\n\"I can understand a man being condemned to the torture if he is guilty,\r\nbut that in order to accomplish one’s mission as accuser, and to\r\ndiscover a criminal, false witnesses who can give no evidence should be\r\nbrought a hundred leagues, that the rabble should be roused up, that\r\ndivers faces and imaginary names should be bestowed on an innocent man,\r\nin order to turn a movement of surprise or an indignant gesture to his\r\ndisadvantage, all this is iniquitous, and goes beyond the right of\r\njudgment bestowed upon men by God. I do not know this woman, and no\r\nmatter what she says or does, I shall say no more.\"\r\n\r\nNeither the skill nor threats of the police officer could shake this\r\nresolution. It was to no purpose that the widow Masson repeated and\r\nasseverated that she recognised him as her tenant Ducoudray, and that he\r\nhad had a large case of wine taken down into the cellar; Derues folded\r\nhis arms, and remained as motionless as if he had been blind and deaf.\r\n\r\nThe walls were sounded, the stones composing them carefully examined,\r\nthe floor pierced in several places, but nothing unusual was discovered.\r\n\r\nWould they have to give it up? Already the officer was making signs to\r\nthis effect, when the man who had remained at first below with Monsieur\r\nde Lamotte, and who, standing in shadow, had carefully watched Derues\r\nwhen he was brought down, came forward, and pointing to the recess under\r\nthe stairs, said—\r\n\r\n\"Examine this corner. The prisoner glanced involuntarily in this\r\ndirection when he came down; I have watched him, and it is the only sign\r\nhe has given. I was the only person who could see him, and he did not\r\nsee me. He is very clever, but one can’t be for ever on one’s guard, and\r\nmay the devil take me if I haven’t scented the hiding-place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wretch!\" said Derues to himself, \"then you have had your hand on me for\r\na whole hour, and amused yourself by prolonging my agony! Oh! I ought to\r\nhave known it; I have found my master. Never mind, you shall learn\r\nnothing from my face, nor yet from the decaying body you will find;\r\nworms and poison can only have left an unrecognisable corpse.\"\r\n\r\nAn iron rod sunk into the ground, encountered a hard substance some four\r\nfeet below. Two men set to work, and dug with energy. Every eye was\r\nfixed upon this trench increasing in depth with every shovelful of earth\r\nwhich the two labourers cast aside. Monsieur de Lamotte was nearly\r\nfainting, and his emotion impressed everyone except Derues. At length\r\nthe silence was broken by the spades striking heavily on wood, and the\r\nnoise made everyone shudder. The chest was uncovered and hoisted out of\r\nthe trench; it was opened, and the body of a woman was seen, clad only\r\nin a chemise, with a red and white headband, face downwards. The body\r\nwas turned over, and Monsieur de Lamotte recognised his wife, not yet\r\ndisfigured.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of horror was so great that no one spoke or uttered a sound.\r\nDerues, occupied in considering the few chances which remained to him,\r\nhad not observed that, by the officer’s order, one of the guards had\r\nleft the cellar before the men began to dig. Everybody had drawn back\r\nboth from the corpse and the murderer, who alone had not moved, and who\r\nwas repeating prayers. The flame of the torches placed on the ground\r\ncast a reddish light on this silent and terrible scene.\r\n\r\nDerues started and turned round on hearing a terrified cry behind him.\r\nHis wife had just been brought to the cellar. The commissioner seized\r\nher with one hand, and taking a torch in the other, compelled her to\r\nlook down on the body.\r\n\r\n\"It is Madame de Lamotte!\" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" she answered, overwhelmed with terror,—\"yes, I recognise\r\nher!\"\r\n\r\nUnable to support the sight any longer, she grew pale and fainted away.\r\nShe and her husband were removed separately. One would have supposed the\r\ndiscovery was already known outside, for the people showered curses and\r\ncries of \"Assassin!\" and \"Poisoner!\" on the carriage which conveyed\r\nDerues. He remained silent during the drive, but before re-entering his\r\ndungeon, he said—\r\n\r\n\"I must have been mad when I sought to hide the death and burial of\r\nMadame de Lamotte from public knowledge. It is the only sin I have\r\ncommitted, and, innocent of aught else, I resign myself as a Christian\r\nto the judgment of God.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the only line of defence which remained open to him, and he clung\r\nto it, with the hope of imposing on the magistrates by redoubled\r\nhypocrisy and pious observances. But all this laboriously constructed\r\nscaffolding of lies was shaken to its base and fell away piece by piece.\r\nEvery moment brought fresh and overwhelming revelations. He professed\r\nthat Madame de Lamotte had died suddenly in his house, and that, fearing\r\nsuspicion, he had buried her secretly. But the doctors called on to\r\nexamine the body declared that she had been poisoned with corrosive\r\nsublimate and opium. The pretended payment was clearly an odious\r\nimposture, the receipt a forgery! Then, like a threatening spectre,\r\narose another question, to which he found no reply, and his own\r\ninvention turned against him.\r\n\r\nWhy, knowing his mother was no more, had he taken young de Lamotte to\r\nVersailles? What had become of the youth? What had befallen, him? Once\r\non the track, the cooper with whom he had lodged on the 12th of February\r\nwas soon discovered, and an Act of Parliament ordered the exhumation of\r\nthe corpse buried under the name of Beaupre, which the cooper identified\r\nby a shirt which he had given for the burial. Derues, confounded by the\r\nevidence, asserted that the youth died of indigestion and venereal\r\ndisease. But the doctors again declared the presence of corrosive\r\nsublimate and opium. All this evidence of guilt he met with assumed\r\nresignation, lamenting incessantly for Edouard, whom he declared he had\r\nloved as his own son. \"Alas!\" he said, \"I see that poor boy every night!\r\nBut it softens my grief to know that he was not deprived of the last\r\nconsolations of religion! God, who sees me, and who knows my innocence,\r\nwill enlighten the magistrates, and my honour will be vindicated.\"\r\n\r\nThe evidence being complete, Derues was condemned by sentence of the\r\nChatelet, pronounced April 30th, and confirmed by Parliament, May 5th.\r\nWe give the decree as it is found in the archives:\r\n\r\n\"This Court having considered the trial held before the Provost of\r\nParis, or his Deputy-Lieutenant at the Chatelet, for the satisfaction of\r\nthe aforesaid Deputy at the aforesaid Chatelet, at the request of the\r\nDeputy of the King’s Attorney General at the aforesaid Court, summoner\r\nand plaintiff, against Antoine-Francois Derues, and Marie-Louise\r\nNicolais, his wife, defendants and accused, prisoners in the prisons of\r\nthe Conciergerie of the Palace at Paris, who have appealed from the\r\nsentence given at the aforesaid trial, the thirtieth day of April 1777,\r\nby which the aforesaid Antoine-Francois Derues has been declared duly\r\nattainted and convicted of attempting unlawfully to appropriate without\r\npayment, the estate of Buissony Souef, belonging to the Sieur and Dame\r\nde Saint Faust de Lamotte, from whom he had bought the said estate by\r\nprivate contract on the twenty-second day of December 1775, and also of\r\nhaving unworthily abused the hospitality shown by him since the\r\nsixteenth day of December last towards the aforesaid Dame de Lamotte,\r\nwho arrived in Paris on the aforesaid day in order to conclude with him\r\nthe bargain agreed on in December 1775, and who, for this purpose, and\r\nat his request, lodged with her son in the house of the said Derues, who\r\nof premeditated design poisoned the said Dame de Lamotte, whether by a\r\nmedicine composed and prepared by him on the thirtieth day of January\r\nlast, or by the beverages and drinks administered by him after the\r\naforesaid medicine (he having taken the precaution to send his servant\r\ninto the country for two or three days), and to keep away strangers from\r\nthe room where the said Dame de Lamotte was lying), from the effects of\r\nwhich poison the said Dame de Lamotte died on the night of the said\r\nthirty-first day of January last; also of having kept her demise secret,\r\nand of having himself enclosed in a chest the body of the said Dame de\r\nLamotte, which he then caused to be secretly transported to a cellar in\r\nthe rue de la Mortellerie hired by him for this purpose, under the\r\nassumed name of Ducoudray, wherein he buried it himself, or caused it to\r\nbe buried; also of having persuaded the son of the above Dame de Lamotte\r\n(who, with his mother, had lodged in his house from the time of their\r\narrival in Paris until the fifteenth day of January, last,—and who had\r\nthen been placed in a school that the aforesaid Dame de Lamotte was at\r\nVersailles and desired him to join her there, and, under this pretence,\r\nof having conducted the said younger Sieur de Lamotte, the twelfth day\r\nof February (after having given him some chocolate), to the aforesaid\r\ntown of Versailles, to a lodging hired at a cooper’s, and of having\r\nthere wilfully poisoned him, either in the chocolate taken by the said\r\nyounger Sieur de Lamotte before starting, or in beverages and\r\nmedicaments which the said Derues himself prepared, mixed, and\r\nadministered to the aforesaid Sieur de Lamotte the younger, during the\r\neleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth days of February last,\r\nhaving kept him lying ill in the aforesaid hired room, and having\r\nrefused to call in physicians or surgeons, notwithstanding the progress\r\nof the malady, and the representations made to him on the subject,\r\nsaying that he himself was a physician and surgeon; from which poison\r\nthe said Sieur de Lamotte the younger died on the fifteenth day of\r\nFebruary last, at nine o’clock in the evening, in the arms of the\r\naforesaid Derues, who, affecting the deepest grief, and shedding tears,\r\nactually exhorted the aforesaid Sieur de Lamotte to confession, and\r\nrepeated the prayers for the dying; after which he himself laid out the\r\nbody for burial, saying that the deceased had begged him to do so, and\r\ntelling the people of the house that he had died of venereal disease;\r\nalso of having caused him to be buried the next day in the churchyard of\r\nthe parish church of Saint Louis at the aforesaid Versailles, and of\r\nhaving entered the deceased in the register of the said parish under a\r\nfalse birthplace, and the false name of Beaupre, which name the said\r\nDerues had himself assumed on arriving at the said lodging, and had\r\ngiven to the said Sieur de Lamotte the younger, whom he declared to be\r\nhis nephew. Also, to cover these atrocities, and in order to appropriate\r\nto himself the aforesaid estate of Buisson-Souef, he is convicted of\r\nhaving calumniated the aforesaid Dame de Lamotte, and of having used\r\nvarious manoeuvres and practised several deceptions, to wit—\r\n\r\n\"First, in signing, or causing to be signed, the names of the above Dame\r\nde Lamotte to a deed of private contract between the said Derues and his\r\nwife on one side and the aforesaid Dame de Lamotte by right of a power\r\nof attorney given by her husband on the other (the which deed is dated\r\nthe twelfth day of February, and was therefore written after the decease\r\nof the said Dame de Lamotte); by which deed the said Dame de Lamotte\r\nappears to change the previous conventions agreed on in the first deed\r\nof the twenty-second of December in the year 1775, and acknowledges\r\nreceipt from the said Derues of a sum of one hundred thousand livres, as\r\nbeing the price of the estate of Buisson;\r\n\r\n\"Secondly, in signing before a notary, the ninth day of February last, a\r\nfeigned acknowledgment for a third part of a hundred thousand livres, in\r\norder to give credence to the pretended payment made by him;\r\n\r\n\"Thirdly, in announcing and publishing, and attesting even by oath at\r\nthe time of an examination before the commissioner Mutel, that he had\r\nreally paid in cash to the aforesaid Dame de Lamotte the aforesaid\r\nhundred thousand livres, and that she, being provided with this money,\r\nhad fled with her son and a certain person unknown;\r\n\r\n\"Fourthly, in depositing with a notary the deed of private contract\r\nbearing the pretended receipt for the above sum of one hundred thousand\r\nlivres, and pursuing at law the execution of this deed and of his claim\r\nto the possession of the said estate;\r\n\r\n\"Fifthly, in signing or causing to be signed by another person, before\r\nthe notaries of the town of Lyons, whither he had gone for this purpose,\r\na deed dated the twelfth day of March, by which the supposed Dame de\r\nLamotte appeared to accept the payment of the hundred thousand livres,\r\nand to give authority to the Sieur de Lamotte, her husband, to receive\r\nthe arrears of the remainder of the price of the said estate, the which\r\ndeed he produced as a proof of the existence of the said Dame de\r\nLamotte;\r\n\r\n\"Sixthly, in causing to be sent, by other hands, under the name of the\r\naforesaid Dame de Lamotte, to a lawyer, on the eighth day o f April 1777\r\n(at a time when he was in prison, and had been compelled to abandon the\r\nfable that he had paid the aforesaid sum of one hundred thousand livres\r\nin hard cash, and had substituted a pretended payment made in notes),\r\nthe notes pretended to have been given by him in payment to the said\r\nDame de Lamotte;\r\n\r\n\"Seventh, and finally, in maintaining constantly, until the discovery of\r\nthe body of the aforesaid Dame de Lamotte, that the said Dame was still\r\nalive, and that he had seen her at the town of Lyons, as has been stated\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n\"In atonement has been condemned, etc. etc. etc.\r\n\r\n\"His goods are hereby declared acquired and confiscated to the King, or\r\nto whomsoever His Majesty shall appoint, first deducting the sum of two\r\nhundred livres as fine for the King, in case the confiscation is not to\r\nthe sole profit of His Majesty; and also the sum of six hundred livres\r\nfor masses to be said for the repose of the souls of the aforesaid Dame\r\nde Lamotte and her son.

For\r\nthree-quarters of an hour he harangued the Parliament, and his defence\r\nwas remarkable both for its presence of mind and the art with which he\r\nmade the most of any circumstances likely to suggest doubts to the\r\nmagistrates and soften the severity of the first sentence. Found guilty\r\non every point, he yet protested that he was innocent of poisoning.\r\nRemorse, which often merely means fear of punishment, had no place in\r\nhis soul, and torture he seemed not to dread. As strong in will as he\r\nwas weak in body, he desired to die like a martyr in the faith of his\r\nreligion, which was hypocrisy, and the God whom he gloried on the\r\nscaffold was the god of lies.\r\n\r\nOn May 6th, at seven in the morning, the sentence of execution was read\r\nto him. He listened calmly, and when it was finished, remarked:\r\n\r\n\"I had not anticipated so severe a sentence.\"\r\n\r\nA few hours later the instruments of torture were got ready. He was told\r\nthat this part of his punishment would be remitted if he would confess\r\nhis crimes and the names of his accomplices. He replied:\r\n\r\n\"I have no more to say. I know what terrible torture awaits me, I know I\r\nmust die to-day, but I have nothing to confess.\"\r\n\r\nHe made no resistance when his knees and legs were bound, and endured\r\nthe torture courageously. Only, in a moment of agony, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Accursed money! has thou reduced me to this?\"\r\n\r\nThinking that pain would overcome his resolution, the presiding\r\nmagistrate bent towards him, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Unhappy man! confess thy crime, since death is near at hand.\"\r\n\r\nHe recovered his firmness, and, looking at the magistrate, replied:\r\n\r\n\"I know it, monseigneur; I have perhaps not three hours to live.\"\r\n\r\nThinking that his apparently feeble frame could not endure the last\r\nwedges, the executioner was ordered to stop. He was unbound and laid on\r\na mattress, and a glass of wine was brought, of which he only drank a\r\nfew drops; after this, he made his confession to the priest. For,\r\ndinner, they brought him soup and stew, which he ate eagerly, and\r\ninquiring of the gaoler if he could have something more, an entree was\r\nbrought in addition. One might have thought that this final repast\r\nheralded, not death but deliverance. At length three o’clock struck the\r\nhour appointed for leaving the prison.\r\n\r\nAccording to the report of credible persons whom we have consulted,\r\nParis on this occasion presented a remarkable appearance, which those\r\nwho saw it were never able to forget. The great anthill was troubled to\r\nits very lowest depth. Whether by accident or design, the same day had\r\nbeen fixed for a function which ought to have proved a considerable\r\ncounter attraction. A great festival in honour of a German prince was\r\ngiven on the Plaine de Grenelle, at which all the court was present; and\r\nprobably more than one great lady regretted missing the emotions of the\r\nPlace de Greve, abandoned to the rabble and the bourgeoisie. The rest of\r\nthe city was deserted, the streets silent, the houses closed. A stranger\r\ntransported suddenly into such a solitude might have reasonably thought\r\nthat during the night the town had been smitten by the Angel of Death,\r\nand that only a labyrinth of vacant buildings remained, testifying to\r\nthe life and turmoil of the preceding day. A dark and dense atmosphere\r\nhung over the abandoned town; lightning furrowed the heavy motionless\r\nclouds; in the distance the occasional rumble of thunder was heard,\r\nanswered by the cannon of the royal fete. The crowd was divided between\r\nthe powers of heaven and earth: the terrible majesty of the Eternal on\r\none side, on the other the frivolous pomp of royalty—eternal punishment\r\nand transient grandeur in opposition. Like the waters of a flood leaving\r\ndry the fields which they have covered, so the waves of the multitude\r\nforsook their usual course. Thousands of men and women crowded together\r\nalong the route which the death-cart would take; an ocean of heads\r\nundulated like the ears in a wheatfield. The old houses, hired at high\r\nrates, quivered under the weight of eager spectators, and the window\r\nsashes had been removed to afford a better view.\r\n\r\nAttired in the shirt worn by condemned criminals, and bearing a placard\r\nboth in front and behind, with the words \"Wilful Poisoner,\" Derues\r\ndescended the great staircase of the Chatelet with a firm step. It was\r\nat this moment, on seeing the crucifix, that he exclaimed, \"O Christ, I\r\nshall suffer like Thee!\" He mounted the tumbril, looking right and left\r\namongst the crowd. During the progress he recognised and bowed to\r\nseveral of his old associates, and bade adieu in a clear voice to the\r\nformer mistress of his ’prentice days, who has recorded that she never\r\nsaw him look so pleasant. Arrived at the door of Notre Dame, where the\r\nclerk was awaiting him, he descended from the tumbril without\r\nassistance, took a lighted wax taper weighing two pounds in his hand,\r\nand did penance, kneeling, bareheaded and barefooted, a rope round his\r\nneck, repeating the words of the death-warrant. He then reascended the\r\ncart in the midst of the cries and execrations of the populace, to which\r\nhe appeared quite insensible. One voice only, endeavouring to dominate\r\nthe tumult, caused him to turn his head: it was that of the hawker who\r\nwas crying his sentence, and who broke off now and then to say—\r\n\r\n\"Well! my poor gossip Derues, how do you like that fine carriage you’re\r\nin? Oh yes, mutter your prayers and look up to heaven as much as you\r\nlike, you won’t take us in now. Ah! thief who said I stole from you!\r\nWasn’t I right when I said I should be selling your sentence some day?\"\r\n\r\nThen, adding her own wrongs to the list of crimes, she declared that the\r\nParliament had condemned him as much for having falsely accused her of\r\ntheft as for having poisoned Madame de Lamotte and her son!\r\n\r\nWhen arrived at the scaffold, he gazed around him, and a sort of shiver\r\nof impatience ran through the crowd. He smiled, and as if anxious to\r\ntrick mankind for the last time, asked to be taken to the Hotel de\r\nVille, which was granted, in the hope that he would at last make some\r\nconfession; but he only persisted in saying that he was guiltless of\r\npoisoning. He had an interview with his wife, who nearly fainted on\r\nseeing him, and remained for more than a quarter of an hour unable to\r\nsay a word. He lavished tender names upon her, and professed much\r\naffliction at seeing her in so miserable a condition.\r\n\r\nWhen she was taken away, he asked permission to embrace her, and took a\r\nmost touching farewell. His last words have been preserved.\r\n\r\n\"My dear wife,\" he said, \"I recommend our beloved children to your care:\r\nbring them up in the fear of God. You must go to Chartres, you will\r\nthere see the bishop, on whom I had the honour of waiting when I was\r\nthere last, and who has always been kind to me; I believe he has thought\r\nwell of me, and that I may hope he will take pity on you and on our\r\nchildren.\"\r\n\r\nIt was now seven in the evening, and the crowd began to murmur at the\r\nlong delay. At length the criminal reappeared. An onlooker who saw him\r\ngo to the Hotel de Ville, and who was carried by the movement of the\r\ncrowd to the foot of the scaffold, says that when handed over to the\r\nexecutioner he took off his clothes himself. He kissed the instrument of\r\npunishment with devotion, then extended himself on the St. Andrew’s\r\ncross, asking with a resigned smile that they would make his sufferings\r\nas short as possible. As soon as his head was covered, the executioner\r\ngave the signal. One would have thought a very few blows would have\r\nfinished so frail a being, but he seemed as hard to kill as the venomous\r\nreptiles which must be crushed and cut to pieces before life is extinct,\r\nand the coup de grace was found necessary. The executioner uncovered his\r\nhead and showed the confessor that the eyes were closed and that the\r\nheart had ceased to beat. The body was then removed from the cross, the\r\nhands and feet fastened together, and it was thrown on the funeral pile.\r\n\r\nWhile the execution was proceeding the people applauded. On the morrow\r\nthey bought up the fragments of bone, and hastened to buy lottery\r\ntickets, in the firm conviction that these precious relics would bring\r\nluck to the fortunate possessors!\r\n\r\nIn 1777, Madame Derues was sentenced to perpetual imprisonment, and\r\nconfined at the Salpetriere. She was one of the first victims who\r\nperished in the prison massacres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*LA CONSTANTIN—1660*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore beginning our story, we must warn the reader that it will not be\r\nworth his while to make researches among contemporary or other records\r\nas to the personage whose name it bears. For in truth neither Marie\r\nLeroux, widow of Jacques Constantin, nor her accomplice, Claude\r\nPerregaud, was of sufficient importance to find a place on any list of\r\ngreat criminals, although it is certain that they were guilty of the\r\ncrimes with which they were charged. It may seem strange that what\r\nfollows is more a history of the retribution which overtook the\r\ncriminals than a circumstantial description of the deeds for which they\r\nwere punished; but the crimes were so revolting, and so unsuitable for\r\ndiscussion, that it was impossible for us to enter into any details on\r\nthe subject, so that what we offer in these pages is, we confess quite\r\nopenly, not a full, true, and particular account of a certain series of\r\nevents leading up to a certain result; it is not even a picture wherein\r\nthat result is depicted with artistic completeness, it is only an\r\nimperfect narrative imperfectly rounded off. We feel sure, however, that\r\nthe healthy-minded reader will be grateful for our reticence and total\r\ndisregard of proportion. In spite of the disadvantage which such a theme\r\nimposes on any writer with a deep sense of responsibility, we have\r\nresolved to let in some light on these obscure figures; for we can\r\nimagine no more effective way of throwing into high relief the low\r\nmorals and deep corruption into which all classes of society had sunk at\r\nthe termination of the factious dissensions of the Fronde, which formed\r\nsuch a fitting prelude to the licence of the reign of the grand roi.\r\n\r\nAfter this explanation, we shall, without further preamble, introduce\r\nthe reader to a little tavern in Paris, situated in the rue\r\nSaint-Andre-des-Arts, on an evening in November 1658.\r\n\r\nIt was about seven o’clock. Three gentlemen were seated at one of the\r\ntables in a low, smoky room. They had already emptied several bottles,\r\nand one of them seemed to have just suggested some madcap scheme to the\r\nothers, the thought of which sent them off into shouts of laughter.\r\n\r\n\"Pardu!\" said one of them, who was the first to recover his breath, \"I\r\nmust say it would be an excellent trick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Splendid!\" said another; \"and if you like, Commander de Jars, we can\r\ntry it this very evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, my worthy king’s treasurer, provided my pretty nephew here\r\nwon’t be too much shocked,\" and as he spoke de Jars gave to the youngest\r\nof the three a caressing touch on the cheek with the back of his hand.\r\n\r\n\"That reminds me, de Jars!\" said the treasurer, \"that word you have just\r\nsaid piques my curiosity. For some months now this little fellow here,\r\nChevalier de Moranges, follows you about everywhere like your shadow.\r\nYou never told us you had a nephew. Where the devil did you get him?\"\r\n\r\nThe commander touched the chevalier’s knee under the table, and he, as\r\nif to avoid speaking, slowly filled and emptied his glass.\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" said the treasurer, \"do you want to hear a few plain words,\r\nsuch as I shall rap out when God takes me to task about the peccadilloes\r\nof my past life? I don’t believe a word about the relationship. A nephew\r\nmust be the son of either a brother or a sister. Now, your only sister\r\nis an abbess, and your late brother’s marriage was childless. There is\r\nonly one way of proving the relationship, and that is to confess that\r\nwhen your brother was young and wild he and Love met, or else Madame\r\nl’Abbesse——.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take care, Treasurer Jeannin! no slander against my sister!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, explain; you can’t fool me! May I be hanged if I leave this\r\nplace before I have dragged the secret out of you! Either we are friends\r\nor we are not. What you tell no one else you ought to tell me. What!\r\nwould you make use of my purse and my sword on occasion and yet have\r\nsecrets from me? It’s too bad: speak, or our friendship is at an end! I\r\ngive you fair warning that I shall find out everything and publish it\r\nabroad to court and city: when I strike a trail there’s no turning me\r\naside. It will be best for you to whisper your secret voluntarily into\r\nmy ear, where it will be as safe as in the grave.\"\r\n\r\n\"How full of curiosity you are, my good friend!\" said de Jars, leaning\r\none elbow on the table, and twirling the points of his moustache with\r\nhis hand; \"but if I were to wrap my secret round the point of a dagger\r\nwould you not be too much afraid of pricking your fingers to pull it\r\noff?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not I,\" said the king’s treasurer, beginning to twirl his moustache\r\nalso: \"the doctors have always told me that I am of too full a\r\ncomplexion and that it would do me all the good in the world to be bled\r\nnow and then. But what would be an advantage to me would be dangerous to\r\nyou. It’s easy to see from your jaundiced phiz that for you\r\nblood-letting is no cure.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you would really go that length? You would risk a duel if I refused\r\nto let you get to the bottom of my mystery?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, on my honour! Well, how is it to be?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear boy,\" said de Jars to the youth, \"we are caught, and may as\r\nwell yield gracefully. You don’t know this big fellow as well as I do.\r\nHe’s obstinacy itself. You can make the most obstinate donkey go on by\r\npulling its tail hard enough, but when Jeannin gets a notion into his\r\npate, not all the legions of hell can get it out again. Besides that,\r\nhe’s a skilful fencer, so there’s nothing for it but to trust him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just as you like,\" said the young man; \"you know all my circumstances\r\nand how important it is that my secret should be kept.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! among Jeannin’s many vices there are a few virtues, and of these\r\ndiscretion is the greatest, so that his curiosity is harmless. A quarter\r\nof an hour hence he will let himself be killed rather than reveal what\r\njust now he is ready to risk his skin to find out, whether we will or\r\nno.\"\r\n\r\nJeannin nodded approvingly, refilled the glasses, and raising his to his\r\nlips, said in a tone of triumph—\r\n\r\n\"I am listening, commander.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if it must be, it must. First of all, learn that my nephew is not\r\nmy nephew at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"That his name is not Moranges.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the next?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not going to reveal his real name to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I don’t know it myself, and no more does the chevalier.\"\r\n\r\n\"What’ nonsense!\"\r\n\r\n\"No nonsense at all, but the sober truth. A few months ago the chevalier\r\ncame to Paris, bringing me a letter of introduction from a German whom I\r\nused to know years ago. This letter requested me to look after the\r\nbearer and help him in his investigations. As you said just now, Love\r\nand someone once met somewhere, and that was about all was known as to\r\nhis origin. Naturally the young man wants to cut a figure in the world,\r\nand would like to discover the author of his existence, that he may have\r\nsomeone at hand to pay the debts he is going to incur. We have brought\r\ntogether every scrap of information we could collect as to this person,\r\nhoping to find therein a clue that we could follow up. To be quite open\r\nwith you, and convince you at the same time how extremely prudent and\r\ndiscreet we must be, I must tell you that we think we have found one,\r\nand that it leads to no less a dignitary than a Prince of the Church.\r\nBut if he should get wind of our researches too soon everything would be\r\nat an end, don’t you see? So keep your tongue between your teeth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never fear,\" said Jeannin.\r\n\r\n\"Now, that’s what I call speaking out as a friend should. I wish you\r\nluck, my gallant Chevalier de Moranges, and until you unearth your\r\nfather, if you want a little money, my purse is at your service. On my\r\nword, de Jars, you must have been born with a caul. There never was your\r\nequal for wonderful adventures. This one promises well-spicy intrigues,\r\nscandalous revelations, and you’ll be in the thick of it all. You’re a\r\nlucky fellow! It’s only a few months since you had the most splendid\r\npiece of good fortune sent you straight from heaven. A fair lady falls\r\nin love with you and makes you carry her off from the convent of La\r\nRaquette. But why do you never let anyone catch a glimpse of her? Are\r\nyou jealous? Or is it that she is no such beauty, after all, but old and\r\nwrinkled, like that knave of a Mazarin?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know what I’m about,\" answered de Jars, smiling; \"I have my very good\r\nreasons. The elopement caused a great deal of indignation, and it’s not\r\neasy to get fanatics to listen to common sense. No, I am not in the\r\nleast jealous; she is madly in love with me. Ask my nephew.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does he know her?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have no secrets from each other; the confidence between us is\r\nwithout a flaw. The fair one, believe me, is good to look on, and is\r\nworth all the ogling, fan-flirting baggages put together that one sees\r\nat court or on the balconies of the Palais Roy: ah! I’ll answer for\r\nthat. Isn’t she, Moranges?\"\r\n\r\n\"I’m quite of your opinion,\" said the youth; exchanging with de jars a\r\nsingularly significant look; \"and you had better treat her well, uncle,\r\nor I shall play you some trick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! ah!\" cried Jeannin. \"You poor fellow! I very much fear that you are\r\nwarming a little serpent in your bosom. Have an eye to this dandy with\r\nthe beardless chin! But joking apart, my boy, are you really on good\r\nterms with the fair lady?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you are not uneasy, commander?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not the least little bit.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is quite right. I answer for her as for my self, you know; as long\r\nas he loves her she will love him; as long as he is faithful she will be\r\nfaithful. Do you imagine that a woman who insists on her lover carrying\r\nher off can so easily turn away from the man of her choice? I know her\r\nwell; I have had long talks with her, she and I alone: she is\r\nfeather-brained, given to pleasure, entirely without prejudices and\r\nthose stupid scruples which spoil the lives of other women; but a good\r\nsort on the whole; devoted to my uncle, with no deception about her; but\r\nat the same time extremely jealous, and has no notion of letting herself\r\nbe sacrificed to a rival. If ever she finds herself deceived, good-bye\r\nto prudence and reserve, and then—\"\r\n\r\nA look and a touch of the commander’s knee cut this panegyric short, to\r\nwhich the treasurer was listening with open-eyed astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"What enthusiasm!\" he exclaimed. \"Well, and then——\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, then,\" went on the young man, with a laugh, \"if my uncle behaves\r\nbadly, I, his nephew, will try to make up for his wrong-doing: he can’t\r\nblame me then. But until then he may be quite easy, as he well knows.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, and in proof of that I am going to take Moranges with me\r\nto-night. He is young and inexperienced, and it will be a good lesson\r\nfor him to see how a gallant whose amorous intrigues did not begin\r\nyesterday sets about getting even with a coquette. He can turn it to\r\naccount later on.\r\n\r\n\"On my word,\" said Jeannin, \"my notion is that he is in no great need of\r\na teacher; however, that’s your business, not mine. Let us return to\r\nwhat we were talking about just now. Are we agreed; and shall we amuse\r\nourselves by paying out the lady in, her own coin?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which of us is to begin?\"\r\n\r\nDe Jars struck the table with the handle of his dagger.\r\n\r\n\"More wine, gentlemen?\" said the drawer, running up.\r\n\r\n\"No, dice; and be quick about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Three casts each and the highest wins,\" said Jeannin. \"You begin.\"\r\n\r\n\"I throw for myself and nephew.\" The dice rolled on the table.\r\n\r\n\"Ace and three.\"\r\n\r\n\"It’s my turn now. Six and five.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pass it over. Five and two.\"\r\n\r\n\"We’re equal. Four and two.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now let me. Ace and blank.\"\r\n\r\n\"Double six.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have won.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I’m off at once,\" said Jeannin, rising, and muffling himself in his\r\nmantle, \"It’s now half-past seven. We shall see each other again at\r\neight, so I won’t say good-bye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good luck to you!\"\r\n\r\nLeaving the tavern and turning into the rue Pavee, he took the direction\r\nof the river.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1658, at the corner of the streets Git-le-Coeur and Le Hurepoix (the\r\nsite of the latter being now occupied by the Quai des Augustins as far\r\nas Pont Saint-Michel), stood the great mansion which Francis I had\r\nbought and fitted up for the Duchesse d’Etampes. It was at this period\r\nif not in ruins at least beginning to show the ravages of time. Its rich\r\ninterior decorations had lost their splendour and become antiquated.\r\nFashion had taken up its abode in the Marais, near the Place Royale, and\r\nit was thither that profligate women and celebrated beauties now enticed\r\nthe humming swarm of old rakes and young libertines. Not one of them all\r\nwould have thought of residing in the mansion, or even in the quarter,\r\nwherein the king’s mistress had once dwelt. It would have been a step\r\ndownward in the social scale, and equivalent to a confession that their\r\ncharms were falling in the public estimation. Still, the old palace was\r\nnot empty; it had, on the contrary, several tenants. Like the provinces\r\nof Alexander’s empire, its vast suites of rooms had been subdivided; and\r\nso neglected was it by the gay world that people of the commonest\r\ndescription strutted about with impunity where once the proudest nobles\r\nhad been glad to gain admittance. There in semi-isolation and despoiled\r\nof her greatness lived Angelique-Louise de Guerchi, formerly companion\r\nto Mademoiselle de Pons and then maid of honour to Anne of Austria. Her\r\nlove intrigues and the scandals they gave rise to had led to her\r\ndismissal from court. Not that she was a greater sinner than many who\r\nremained behind, only she was unlucky enough or stupid enough to be\r\nfound out. Her admirers were so indiscreet that they had not left her a\r\nshred of reputation, and in a court where a cardinal is the lover of a\r\nqueen, a hypocritical appearance of decorum is indispensable to success.\r\nSo Angelique had to suffer for the faults she was not clever enough to\r\nhide. Unfortunately for her, her income went up and down with the number\r\nand wealth of her admirers, so when she left the court all her\r\npossessions consisted of a few articles she had gathered together out of\r\nthe wreck of her former luxury, and these she was now selling one by one\r\nto procure the necessaries of life, while she looked back from afar with\r\nan envious eye at the brilliant world from which she had been exiled,\r\nand longed for better days. All hope was not at an end for her. By a\r\nstrange law which does not speak well for human nature, vice finds\r\nsuccess easier to attain than virtue. There is no courtesan, no matter\r\nhow low she has fallen, who cannot find a dupe ready to defend against\r\nthe world an honour of which no vestige remains. A man who doubts the\r\nvirtue of the most virtuous woman, who shows himself inexorably severe\r\nwhen he discovers the lightest inclination to falter in one whose\r\nconduct has hitherto been above reproach, will stoop and pick up out of\r\nthe gutter a blighted and tarnished reputation and protect and defend it\r\nagainst all slights, and devote his life to the attempt to restore\r\nlustre to the unclean thing dulled by the touch of many fingers. In her\r\ndays of prosperity Commander de Jars and the king’s treasurer had both\r\nfluttered round Mademoiselle de Guerchi, and neither had fluttered in\r\nvain. Short as was the period necessary to overcome her scruples, in as\r\nshort a period it dawned on the two candidates for her favour that each\r\nhad a successful rival in the other, and that however potent as a reason\r\nfor surrender the doubloons of the treasurer had been, the personal\r\nappearance of the commander had proved equally cogent. As both had felt\r\nfor her only a passing fancy and not a serious passion, their\r\nexplanations with each other led to no quarrel between them; silently\r\nand simultaneously they withdrew from her circle, without even letting\r\nher know they had found her out, but quite determined to revenge,\r\nthemselves on her should a chance ever offer. However, other affairs of\r\na similar nature had intervened to prevent their carrying out this\r\nlaudable intention; Jeannin had laid siege to a more inaccessible\r\nbeauty, who had refused to listen to his sighs for less than 30 crowns,\r\npaid in advance, and de Jars had become quite absorbed by his adventure\r\nwith the convent boarder at La Raquette, and the business of that young\r\nstranger whom he passed off as his nephew. Mademoiselle de Guerchi had\r\nnever seen them again; and with her it was out of sight out of mind. At\r\nthe moment when she comes into our story she was weaving her toils round\r\na certain Duc de Vitry, whom she had seen at court, but whose\r\nacquaintance she had never made, and who had been absent when the\r\nscandalous occurrence which led to her disgrace came to light. He was a\r\nman of from twenty-five to twenty-six years of age, who idled his life\r\naway: his courage was undoubted, and being as credulous as an old\r\nlibertine, he was ready to draw his sword at any moment to defend the\r\nlady whose cause he had espoused, should any insolent slanderer dare to\r\nhint there was a smirch on her virtue. Being deaf to all reports, he\r\nseemed one of those men expressly framed by heaven to be the consolation\r\nof fallen women; such a man as in our times a retired opera-dancer or a\r\nsuperannuated professional beauty would welcome with open arms. He had\r\nonly one fault—he was married. It is true he neglected his wife,\r\naccording to the custom of the time, and it is probably also true that\r\nhis wife cared very little about his infidelities. But still she was an\r\ninsurmountable obstacle to the fulfilment of Mademoiselle de Guerchi’s\r\nhopes, who but for her might have looked forward to one day becoming a\r\nduchess.\r\n\r\nFor about three weeks, however, at the time we are speaking of, the duke\r\nhad neither crossed her threshold nor written. He had told her he was\r\ngoing for a few days to Normandy, where he had large estates, but had\r\nremained absent so long after the date he had fixed for his return that\r\nshe began to feel uneasy. What could be keeping him? Some new flame,\r\nperhaps. The anxiety of the lady was all the more keen, that until now\r\nnothing had passed between them but looks of languor and words of love.\r\nThe duke had laid himself and all he possessed at the feet of Angelique,\r\nand Angelique had refused his offer. A too prompt surrender would have\r\njustified the reports so wickedly spread against her; and, made wise by\r\nexperience, she was resolved not to compromise her future as she had\r\ncompromised her past. But while playing at virtue she had also to play\r\nat disinterestedness, and her pecuniary resources were consequently\r\nalmost exhausted. She had proportioned the length of her resistance to\r\nthe length of her purse, and now the prolonged absence of her lover\r\nthreatened to disturb the equilibrium which she had established between\r\nher virtue and her money. So it happened that the cause of the lovelorn\r\nDuc de Vitry was in great peril just at the moment when de Jars and\r\nJeannin resolved to approach the fair one anew. She was sitting lost in\r\nthought, pondering in all good faith on the small profit it was to a\r\nwoman to be virtuous, when she heard voices in the antechamber. Then her\r\ndoor opened, and the king’s treasurer walked in.\r\n\r\nAs this interview and those which follow took place in the presence of\r\nwitnesses, we are obliged to ask the reader to accompany us for a time\r\nto another part of the same house.\r\n\r\nWe have said there were several tenants: now the person who occupied the\r\nrooms next to those in which Mademoiselle de Guerchi lived was a\r\nshopkeeper’s widow called Rapally, who was owner of one of the\r\nthirty-two houses which then occupied the bridge Saint-Michel. They had\r\nall been constructed at the owner’s cost, in return for a lease for\r\never. The widow Rapally’s avowed age was forty, but those who knew her\r\nlongest added another ten years to that: so, to avoid error, let us say\r\nshe was forty-five. She was a solid little body, rather stouter than was\r\nnecessary for beauty; her hair was black, her complexion brown, her eyes\r\nprominent and always moving; lively, active, and if one once yielded to\r\nher whims, exacting beyond measure; but until then buxom and soft, and\r\ninclined to pet and spoil whoever, for the moment, had arrested her\r\nvolatile fancy. Just as we make her acquaintance this happy individual\r\nwas a certain Maitre Quennebert, a notary of Saint Denis, and the comedy\r\nplayed between him and the widow was an exact counterpart of the one\r\ngoing on in the rooms of Mademoiselle de Guerchi, except that the roles\r\nwere inverted; for while the lady was as much in love as the Duc de\r\nVitry, the answering devotion professed by the notary was as insincere\r\nas the disinterested attachment to her lover displayed by the whilom\r\nmaid of honour.\r\n\r\nMaitre Quennebert was still young and of attractive appearance, but his\r\nbusiness affairs were in a bad way. For long he had been pretending not\r\nto understand the marked advances of the widow, and he treated her with\r\na reserve and respect she would fain have dispensed with, and which\r\nsometimes made her doubt of his love. But it was impossible for her as a\r\nwoman to complain, so she was forced to accept with resignation the\r\npersistent and unwelcome consideration with which he surrounded her.\r\nMaitre Quennebert was a man of common sense and much experience, and had\r\nformed a scheme which he was prevented from carrying out by an obstacle\r\nwhich he had no power to remove. He wanted, therefore, to gain time, for\r\nhe knew that the day he gave the susceptible widow a legal right over\r\nhim he would lose his independence. A lover to whose prayers the adored\r\none remains deaf too long is apt to draw back in discouragement, but a\r\nwoman whose part is restricted to awaiting those prayers, and answering\r\nwith a yes or no, necessarily learns patience. Maitre Quennebert would\r\ntherefore have felt no anxiety as to the effect of his dilatoriness on\r\nthe widow, were it not for the existence of a distant cousin of the late\r\nMonsieur Rapally, who was also paying court to her, and that with a\r\nwarmth much greater than had hitherto been displayed by himself. This\r\nfact, in view of the state of the notary’s affairs, forced him at last\r\nto display more energy. To make up lost ground and to outdistance his\r\nrival once more, he now began to dazzle the widow with fine phrases and\r\ndelight her with compliments; but to tell the truth all this trouble was\r\nsuperfluous; he was beloved, and with one fond look he might have won\r\npardon for far greater neglect.\r\n\r\nAn hour before the treasurer’s arrival there had been a knock at the\r\ndoor of the old house, and Maitre Quennebert, curled, pomaded, and\r\nprepared for conquest, had presented himself at the widow’s. She\r\nreceived him with a more languishing air than usual, and shot such\r\narrows at him from her eyes that to escape a fatal wound he pretended\r\nto give way by degrees to deep sadness. The widow, becoming alarmed,\r\nasked with tenderness—\r\n\r\n\"What ails you this evening?\"\r\n\r\nHe rose, feeling he had nothing to fear from his rival, and, being\r\nmaster of the field, might henceforth advance or recede as seemed best\r\nfor his interests.\r\n\r\n\"What ails me?\" he repeated, with a deep sigh. \"I might deceive you,\r\nmight give you a misleading answer, but to you I cannot lie. I am in\r\ngreat trouble, and how to get out of it I don’t know.\"\r\n\r\n\"But tell me what it is,\" said the widow, standing up in her turn.\r\n\r\nMaitre Quennebert took three long strides, which brought him to the far\r\nend of the room, and asked—\r\n\r\n\"Why do you want to know? You can’t help me. My trouble is of a kind a\r\nman does not generally confide to women.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it? An affair of honour?\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good God! You are going to fight!\" she exclaimed, trying to seize him\r\nby the arm. \"You are going to fight!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! if it were nothing worse than that!\" said Quennebert, pacing up and\r\ndown the room: \"but you need not be alarmed; it is only a money trouble.\r\nI lent a large sum, a few months ago, to a friend, but the knave has run\r\naway and left me in the lurch. It was trust money, and must be replaced\r\nwithin three days. But where am I to get two thousand francs?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is a large sum, and not easy to raise at such short notice.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be obliged to have recourse to some Jew, who will drain me dry.\r\nBut I must save my good name at all costs.\"\r\n\r\nMadame Rapally gazed at him in consternation. Maitre Quennebert,\r\ndivining her thought, hastened to add—\r\n\r\n\"I have just one-third of what is needed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only one-third?\"\r\n\r\n\"With great care, and by scraping together all I possess, I can make up\r\neight hundred livres. But may I be damned in the next world, or punished\r\nas a swindler in this, and one’s as bad as the other to me, if I can\r\nraise one farthing more.\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose someone should lend you the twelve hundred francs, what\r\nthen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardieu! I should accept them,\" cried the notary as if he had not the\r\nleast suspicion whom she could mean. \"Do you happen to know anyone, my\r\ndear Madame Rapally?\"\r\n\r\nThe widow nodded affirmatively, at the same time giving him a passionate\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me quick the name of this delightful person, and I shall go to him\r\nto-morrow morning. You don’t know what a service you are rendering me.\r\nAnd I was so near not telling you of the fix I was in, lest you should\r\ntorment yourself uselessly. Tell me his name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you not guess it?\"\r\n\r\n\"How should I guess it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Think well. Does no one occur to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no one,\" said Quennebert, with the utmost innocence.\r\n\r\n\"Have you no friends?\"\r\n\r\n\"One or two.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would they not be glad to help you?\"\r\n\r\n\"They might. But I have mentioned the matter to no one.\"\r\n\r\n\"To no one?\"\r\n\r\n\"Except you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Madame Rapally—I hope I don’t understand you; it’s not possible;\r\nyou would not humiliate me. Come, come, it’s a riddle, and I am too\r\nstupid to solve it. I give it up. Don’t tantalise me any longer; tell me\r\nthe name.\"\r\n\r\nThe widow, somewhat abashed by this exhibition of delicacy on the part\r\nof Maitre Quennebert, blushed, cast down her eyes, and did not venture\r\nto speak.\r\n\r\nAs the silence lasted some time, it occurred to the notary that he had\r\nbeen perhaps too hasty in his supposition, and he began to cast round\r\nfor the best means of retrieving his blunder.\r\n\r\n\"You do not speak,\" he said; \"I see it was all a joke.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the widow at last in a timid voice, \"it was no joke; I was\r\nquite in earnest. But the way you take things is not very encouraging.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray, do you imagine that I can go on while you glare at me with that\r\nangry frown puckering your forehead, as if you had someone before you\r\nwho had tried to insult you?\"\r\n\r\nA sweet smile chased the frown from the notary’s brow. Encouraged by the\r\nsuspension of hostilities, Madame Rapally with sudden boldness\r\napproached him, and, pressing one of his hands in both her own,\r\nwhispered—\r\n\r\n\"It is I who am going to lend you the money.\"\r\n\r\nHe repulsed her gently, but with an air of great dignity, and said—\r\n\r\n\"Madame, I thank you, but I cannot accept.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why can’t you?\"\r\n\r\nAt this he began to walk round and round the room, while the widow, who\r\nstood in the middle, turned as upon a pivot, keeping him always in view.\r\nThis circus-ring performance lasted some minutes before Quennebert stood\r\nstill and said—\r\n\r\n\"I cannot be angry with you, Madame Rapally, I know your offer was made\r\nout of the kindness of your heart,—but I must repeat that it is\r\nimpossible for me to accept it.\"\r\n\r\n\"There you go again! I don’t understand you at all! Why can’t you\r\naccept? What harm would it do?\"\r\n\r\n\"If there were no other reason, because people might suspect that I\r\nconfided my difficulties to you in the hope of help.\"\r\n\r\n\"And supposing you did, what then? People speak hoping to be understood.\r\nYou wouldn’t have minded asking anyone else.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you really think I did come in that hope?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mon Dieu! I don’t think anything at all that you don’t want. It was I\r\nwho dragged the confidence from you by my questions, I know that very\r\nwell. But now that you have told me your secret, how can you hinder me\r\nfrom sympathising with you, from desiring to aid you? When I learned\r\nyour difficulty, ought I to have been amused, and gone into fits of\r\nlaughter? What! it’s an insult to be in a position to render you a\r\nservice! That’s a strange kind of delicacy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you astonished that I should feel so strongly about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense! Do you still think I meant to offend you? I look on you as\r\nthe most honourable man in the world. If anyone were to tell me that he\r\nhad seen you commit a base action, I should reply that it was a lie.\r\nDoes that satisfy you?\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose they got hold of it in the city, suppose it were reported\r\nthat Maitre Quennebert had taken money from Madame de Rapally, would it\r\nbe the same as if they said Maitre Quennebert had borrowed twelve\r\nhundred livres from Monsieur Robert or some other business man?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don’t see what difference it could make.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"What then?\"\r\n\r\n\"It’s not easy to express, but——\"\r\n\r\n\"But you exaggerate both the service and the gratitude you ought to\r\nfeel. I think I know why you refuse. You’re ashamed to take it as a\r\ngift, aren’t you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I’m not going to make you a gift. Borrow twelve hundred livres\r\nfrom me. For how long do you want the money?\"\r\n\r\n\"I really don’t know how soon I can repay you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let’s say a year, and reckon the interest. Sit down there, you baby,\r\nand write out a promissory note.\"\r\n\r\nMaitre Quennebert made some further show of resistance, but at last\r\nyielded to the widow’s importunity. It is needless to say that the whole\r\nthing was a comedy on his part, except that he really needed the money.\r\nBut he did not need it to replace a sum of which a faithless friend had\r\nrobbed him, but to satisfy his own creditors, who, out of all patience\r\nwith him, were threatening to sue him, and his only reason for seeking\r\nout Madame de Rapally was to take advantage of her generous disposition\r\ntowards himself. His feigned delicacy was intended to induce her to\r\ninsist so urgently, that in accepting he should not fall too much in her\r\nesteem, but should seem to yield to force. And his plan met with\r\ncomplete success, for at the end of the transaction he stood higher than\r\never in the opinion of his fair creditor, on account of the noble\r\nsentiments he had expressed. The note was written out in legal form and\r\nthe money counted down on the spot.\r\n\r\n\"How glad I am!\" said she then, while Quennebert still kept up some\r\npretence of delicate embarrassment, although he could not resist casting\r\na stolen look at the bag of crowns lying on the table beside his cloak.\r\n\"Do you intend to go back to Saint Denis to-night?\"\r\n\r\nEven had such been his intention, the notary would have taken very good\r\ncare not to say so; for he foresaw the accusations of imprudence that\r\nwould follow, the enumeration of the dangers by the way; and it was\r\nquite on the cards even that, having thus aroused his fears, his fair\r\nhostess should in deference to them offer him hospitality for the night,\r\nand he did not feel inclined for an indefinitely prolonged tete-a-tete.\r\n\r\n\"No;\" he said, \"I am going to sleep at Maitre Terrasson’s, rue des\r\nPoitevins; I have sent him word to expect me. But although his house is\r\nonly a few yards distant, I must leave you earlier than I could have\r\nwished, on account of this money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you think of me?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can you ask?\" replied Quennebert, with a sentimental expression.\r\n\"You have compelled me to accept the money, but—I shall not be happy\r\ntill I have repaid you. Suppose this loan should make us fall out?\"\r\n\r\n\"You may be quite sure that if you don’t pay when the bill falls due, I\r\nshall have recourse to the law.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I know that very well.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall enforce all my rights as a creditor.\"\r\n\r\n\"I expect nothing else.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall show no pity.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the widow gave a saucy laugh and shook her finger at him.\r\n\r\n\"Madame Rapally,\" said the notary, who was most anxious to bring this\r\nconversation to an end, dreading every moment that it would take a\r\nlanguishing tone,-\"Madame Rapally, will you add to your goodness by\r\ngranting me one more favour?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"The gratitude that is simulated is not difficult to bear, but genuine,\r\nsincere gratitude, such as I feel, is a heavy burden, as I can assure\r\nyou. It is much easier to give than to receive. Promise me, then, that\r\nfrom now till the year is up there shall be no more reference between us\r\nto this money, and that we shall go on being good friends as before.\r\nLeave it to me to make arrangements to acquit myself honourably of my\r\nobligations towards you. I need say no more; till a year’s up, mum’s the\r\nword.\"\r\n\r\n\"It shall be as you desire, Maitre Quennebert,\" answered Madame Rapally,\r\nher eyes shining with delight. \"It was never my intention to lay you\r\nunder embarrassing obligations, and I leave it all to you. Do you know\r\nthat I am beginning to believe in presentiments?\"\r\n\r\n\"You becoming superstitious! Why, may I ask?\"\r\n\r\n\"I refused to do a nice little piece of ready-money business this\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, because I had a sort of feeling that made me resist all temptation\r\nto leave myself without cash. Imagine! I received a visit to-day from a\r\ngreat lady who lives in this house—in the suite of apartments next to\r\nmine.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is her name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mademoiselle de Guerchi.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what did she want with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"She called in order to ask me to buy, for four hundred livres, some of\r\nher jewels which are well worth six hundred, for I understand such\r\nthings; or should I prefer it to lend her that sum and keep the jewels\r\nas security? It appears that mademoiselle is in great straits. De\r\nGuerchi—do you know the name?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I have heard it.\"\r\n\r\n\"They say she has had a stormy past, and has been greatly talked of; but\r\nthen half of what one hears is lies. Since she came to live here she has\r\nbeen very quiet. No visitors except one—a nobleman, a duke—wait a\r\nmoment! What’s his name? The Duc-Duc de Vitry; and for over three weeks\r\neven he hasn’t been near her. I imagine from this absence that they have\r\nfallen out, and that she is beginning to feel the want of money.\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem to be intimately acquainted with this young woman’s affairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed I am, and yet I never spoke to her till this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you get your information, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"By chance. The room adjoining this and one of those she occupies were\r\nformerly one large room, which is now divided into two by a partition\r\nwall covered with tapestry; but in the two corners the plaster has\r\ncrumbled away with time, and one can see into the room through slits in\r\nthe tapestry without being seen oneself. Are you inquisitive?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not more than you, Madame Rapally.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come with me. Someone knocked at the street door a few moments ago;\r\nthere’s no one else in the house likely to have visitors at this hour.\r\nPerhaps her admirer has come back.\"\r\n\r\n\"If so, we are going to witness a scene of recrimination or\r\nreconciliation. How delightful!\"\r\n\r\nAlthough he was not leaving the widow’s lodgings, Maitre Quennebert took\r\nup his hat and cloak and the blessed bag of crown pieces, and followed\r\nMadame Rapally on tiptoe, who on her side moved as slowly as a tortoise\r\nand as lightly as she could. They succeeded in turning the handle of the\r\ndoor into the next room without making much noise.\r\n\r\n\"’Sh!\" breathed the widow softly; \"listen, they are speaking.\"\r\n\r\nShe pointed to the place where he would find a peep-hole in one corner\r\nof the room, and crept herself towards the corresponding corner.\r\nQuennebert, who was by no means anxious to have her at his side,\r\nmotioned to her to blow out the light. This being done, he felt secure,\r\nfor he knew that in the intense darkness which now enveloped them she\r\ncould not move from her place without knocking against the furniture\r\nbetween them, so he glued his face to the partition. An opening just\r\nlarge enough for one eye allowed him to see everything that was going on\r\nin the next room. Just as he began his observations, the treasurer at\r\nMademoiselle de Guerchi’s invitation was about to take a seat near her,\r\nbut not too near for perfect respect. Both of them were silent, and\r\nappeared to labour under great embarrassment at finding themselves\r\ntogether, and explanations did not readily begin. The lady had not an\r\nidea of the motive of the visit, and her quondam lover feigned the\r\nemotion necessary to the success of his undertaking. Thus Maitre\r\nQuennebert had full time to examine both, and especially Angelique. The\r\nreader will doubtless desire to know what was the result of the notary’s\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nANGELIQUE-LOUISE DE GUERCHI was a woman of about twenty-eight years of\r\nage, tall, dark, and well made. The loose life she had led had, it is\r\ntrue, somewhat staled her beauty, marred the delicacy of her complexion,\r\nand coarsened the naturally elegant curves of her figure; but it is such\r\nwomen who from time immemorial have had the strongest attraction for\r\nprofligate men. It seems as if dissipation destroyed the power to\r\nperceive true beauty, and the man of pleasure must be aroused to\r\nadmiration by a bold glance and a meaning smile, and will only seek\r\nsatisfaction along the trail left by vice. Louise-Angelique was\r\nadmirably adapted for her way of life; not that her features wore an\r\nexpression of shameless effrontery, or that the words that passed her\r\nlips bore habitual testimony to the disorders of her existence, but that\r\nunder a calm and sedate demeanour there lurked a secret and indefinable\r\ncharm. Many other women possessed more regular features, but none of\r\nthem had a greater power of seduction. We must add that she owed that\r\npower entirely to her physical perfections, for except in regard to the\r\ndevices necessary to her calling, she showed no cleverness, being\r\nignorant, dull and without inner resources of any kind. As her\r\ntemperament led her to share the desires she excited, she was really\r\nincapable of resisting an attack conducted with skill and ardour, and if\r\nthe Duc de Vitry had not been so madly in love, which is the same as\r\nsaying that he was hopelessly blind, silly, and dense to everything\r\naround him, he might have found a score of opportunities to overcome her\r\nresistance. We have already seen that she was so straitened in money\r\nmatters that she had been driven to try to sell her jewels that very,\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nJeannin was the first to ’break silence.\r\n\r\n\"You are astonished at my visit, I know, my charming Angelique. But you\r\nmust excuse my thus appearing so unexpectedly before you. The truth is,\r\nI found it impossible to leave Paris without seeing you once more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you for your kind remembrance,\" said she, \"but I did not at all\r\nexpect it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, come, you are offended with me.\"\r\n\r\nShe gave him a glance of mingled disdain and resentment; but he went on,\r\nin a timid, wistful tone—\r\n\r\n\"I know that my conduct must have seemed strange to you, and I\r\nacknowledge that nothing can justify a man for suddenly leaving the\r\nwoman he loves—I do not dare to say the woman who loves him—without a\r\nword of explanation. But, dear Angelique, I was jealous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jealous!\" she repeated incredulously.\r\n\r\n\"I tried my best to overcome the feeling, and I hid my suspicions from\r\nyou. Twenty times I came to see you bursting with anger and determined\r\nto overwhelm you with reproaches, but at the sight of your beauty I\r\nforgot everything but that I loved you. My suspicions dissolved before a\r\nsmile; one word from your lips charmed me into happiness. But when I was\r\nagain alone my terrors revived, I saw my rivals at your feet, and rage\r\npossessed me once more. Ah! you never knew how devotedly I loved you.\"\r\n\r\nShe let him speak without interruption; perhaps the same thought was in\r\nher mind as in Quennebert’s, who, himself a past master in the art of\r\nlying; was thinking—\r\n\r\n\"The man does not believe a word of what he is saying.\"\r\n\r\nBut the treasurer went on—\r\n\r\n\"I can see that even now you doubt my sincerity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does my lord desire that his handmaiden should be blunt? Well, I know\r\nthat there is no truth in what you say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! I can see that you imagine that among the distractions of the world\r\nI have kept no memory of you, and have found consolation in the love of\r\nless obdurate fair ones. I have not broken in on your retirement; I have\r\nnot shadowed your steps; I have not kept watch on your actions; I have\r\nnot surrounded you with spies who would perhaps have brought me the\r\nassurance, ’If she quitted the world which outraged her, she was not\r\ndriven forth by an impulse of wounded pride or noble indignation; she\r\ndid not even seek to punish those who misunderstood her by her absence;\r\nshe buried herself where she was unknown, that she might indulge in\r\nstolen loves.’ Such were the thoughts that came to me, and yet I\r\nrespected your hiding-place; and to-day I am ready to believe you true,\r\nif you will merely say, ’I love no one else!’\"\r\n\r\nJeannin, who was as fat as a stage financier, paused here to gasp; for\r\nthe utterance of this string of banalities, this rigmarole of\r\ncommonplaces, had left him breathless. He was very much dissatisfied\r\nwith his performance; and ready to curse his barren imagination. He\r\nlonged to hit upon swelling phrases and natural and touching gestures,\r\nbut in vain. He could only look at Mademoiselle de Guerchi with a\r\nmiserable, heart-broken air. She remained quietly seated, with the same\r\nexpression of incredulity on her features.\r\n\r\nSo there was nothing for it but to go on once more.\r\n\r\n\"But this one assurance that I ask you will not give. So what I\r\nhave—been told is true: you have given your love to him.\"\r\n\r\nShe could not check a startled movement.\r\n\r\n\"You see it is only when I speak of him that I can overcome in you the\r\ninsensibility which is killing me. My suspicions were true after all:\r\nyou deceived me for his sake. Oh! the instinctive feeling of jealousy\r\nwas right which forced me to quarrel with that man, to reject the\r\nperfidious friendship which he tried to force upon me. He has returned\r\nto town, and we shall meet! But why do I say ’returned’? Perhaps he only\r\npretended to go away, and safe in this retreat has flouted with\r\nimpunity, my despair and braved my vengeance!\"\r\n\r\nUp to this the lady had played a waiting game, but now she grew quite\r\nconfused, trying to discover the thread of the treasurer’s thoughts. To\r\nwhom did he refer? The Duc de Vitry? That had been her first impression.\r\nBut the duke had only been acquainted with her for a few months—since\r\nshe had—left Court. He could not therefore have excited the jealousy of\r\nher whilom lover; and if it were not he, to whom did the words about\r\nrejecting \"perfidious friendship,\" and \"returned to town,\" and so on,\r\napply? Jeannin divined her embarrassment, and was not a little proud of\r\nthe tactics which would, he was almost sure; force her to expose\r\nherself. For there are certain women who can be thrown into cruel\r\nperplexity by speaking to them of their love-passages without affixing a\r\nproper name label to each. They are placed as it were on the edge of an\r\nabyss, and forced to feel their way in darkness. To say \"You have loved\"\r\nalmost obliges them to ask \"Whom?\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this was not the word uttered by Mademoiselle de Guerchi\r\nwhile she ran through in her head a list of possibilities. Her answer\r\nwas—\r\n\r\n\"Your language astonishes me; I don’t understand what you mean.\"\r\n\r\nThe ice was broken, and the treasurer made a plunge. Seizing one of\r\nAngelique’s hands, he asked—\r\n\r\n\"Have you never seen Commander de Jars since then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Commander de Jars!\" exclaimed Angelique.\r\n\r\n\"Can you swear to me, Angelique, that you love him not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mon Dieu! What put it into your head that I ever cared for him? It’s\r\nover four months since I saw him last, and I hadn’t an idea whether he\r\nwas alive or dead. So he has been out of town? That’s the first I heard\r\nof it.\"\r\n\r\n\"My fortune is yours, Angelique! Oh! assure me once again that you do\r\nnot love him—that you never loved him!\" he pleaded in a faltering voice,\r\nfixing a look of painful anxiety upon her.\r\n\r\nHe had no intention of putting her out of countenance by the course he\r\ntook; he knew quite well that a woman like Angelique is never more at\r\nher ease than when she has a chance of telling an untruth of this\r\nnature. Besides, he had prefaced this appeal by the magic words, \"My\r\nfortune’ is yours!\" and the hope thus aroused was well worth a perjury.\r\nSo she answered boldly and in a steady voice, while she looked straight\r\ninto his eyes—\r\n\r\n\"Never!\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe you!\" exclaimed Jeannin, going down on his knees and covering\r\nwith his kisses the hand he still held. \"I can taste happiness again.\r\nListen, Angelique. I am leaving Paris; my mother is dead, and I am going\r\nback to Spain. Will you follow me thither?\"\r\n\r\n\"I—-follow you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hesitated long before finding you out, so much did I fear a repulse.\r\nI set out to-morrow. Quit Paris, leave the world which has slandered\r\nyou, and come with me. In a fortnight we shall be man and wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not in earnest!\"\r\n\r\n\"May I expire at your feet if I am not! Do you want me to sign the oath\r\nwith my blood?\"\r\n\r\n\"Rise,\" she said in a broken voice. \"Have I at last found a man to love\r\nme and compensate me for all the abuse that has been showered on my\r\nhead? A thousand times I thank you, not for what you are doing for me,\r\nbut for the balm you pour on my wounded spirit. Even if you were to say\r\nto me now, ’After all, I am obliged to give you up’ the pleasure of\r\nknowing you esteem me would make up for all the rest. It would be\r\nanother happy memory to treasure along with my memory of our love, which\r\nwas ineffaceable, although you so ungratefully suspected me of having\r\ndeceived you.\"\r\n\r\nThe treasurer appeared fairly intoxicated with joy. He indulged in a\r\nthousand ridiculous extravagances and exaggerations, and declared\r\nhimself the happiest of men. Mademoiselle de Guerchi, who was desirous\r\nof being prepared for every peril, asked him in a coaxing tone—\r\n\r\n\"Who can have put it into your head to be jealous of the commander? Has\r\nhe been base enough to boast that I ever gave him my love?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, he never said anything about you; but someway I was afraid.\"\r\n\r\nShe renewed her assurances. The conversation continued some time in a\r\nsentimental tone. A thousand oaths, a thousand protestations of love\r\nwere, exchanged. Jeannin feared that the suddenness of their journey\r\nwould inconvenience his mistress, and offered to put it off for some\r\ndays; but to this she would not consent, and it was arranged that the\r\nnext day at noon a carriage should call at the house and take Angelique\r\nout of town to an appointed place at which the treasurer was to join\r\nher.\r\n\r\nMaitre Quennebert, eye and ear on the alert, had not lost a word of this\r\nconversation, and the last proposition of the treasurer changed his\r\nideas.\r\n\r\n\"Pardieu!\" he said to himself, \"it looks as if this good man were really\r\ngoing to let himself be taken in and done for. It is singular how very\r\nclear-sighted we can be about things that don’t touch us. This poor fly\r\nis going to let himself be caught by a very clever spider, or I’m much\r\nmistaken. Very likely my widow is quite of my opinion, and yet in what\r\nconcerns herself she will remain stone-blind. Well, such is life! We\r\nhave only two parts to choose between: we must be either knave or fool.\r\nWhat’s Madame Rapally doing, I wonder?\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment he heard a stifled whisper from the opposite corner of\r\nthe room, but, protected by the distance and the darkness, he let the\r\nwidow murmur on, and applied his eye once more to his peephole. What he\r\nsaw confirmed his opinion. The damsel was springing up and down,\r\nlaughing, gesticulating, and congratulating herself on her unexpected\r\ngood fortune.\r\n\r\n\"Just imagine! He loves me like that!\" she was saying to herself. \"Poor\r\nJeannin! When I remember how I used to hesitate. How fortunate that\r\nCommander de Jars, one of the most vain and indiscreet of men, never\r\nbabbled about me! Yes, we must leave town to-morrow without fail. I must\r\nnot give him time to be enlightened by a chance word. But the Duc de\r\nVitry? I am really sorry for him. However, why did he go away, and send\r\nno word? And then, he’s a married man. Ah! if I could only get back\r\nagain to court some day!... Who would ever have expected such a thing?\r\nGood God! I must keep talking to myself, to be sure I’m not dreaming.\r\nYes, he was there, just now, at my feet, saying to me, ’Angelique, you\r\nare going to become my wife.’ One thing is sure, he may safely entrust\r\nhis honour to my care. It would be infamous to betray a man who loves me\r\nas he does, who will give me his name. Never, no, never will I give him\r\ncause to reproach me! I would rather——\"\r\n\r\nA loud and confused noise on the stairs interrupted this soliloquy. At\r\none moment bursts of laughter were heard, and the next angry voices.\r\nThen a loud exclamation, followed by a short silence. Being alarmed at\r\nthis disturbance in a house which was usually so quiet, Mademoiselle de\r\nGuerchi approached the door of her room, intending either to call for\r\nprotection or to lock herself in, when suddenly it was violently pushed\r\nopen. She recoiled with fright, exclaiming—\r\n\r\n\"Commander de Jars!\"\r\n\r\n\"On my word!\" said Quennebert behind the arras, \"’tis as amusing as a\r\nplay! Is the commander also going to offer to make an honest woman of\r\nher? But what do I see?\"\r\n\r\nHe had just caught sight of the young man on whom de Jars had bestowed\r\nthe title and name of Chevalier de Moranges, and whose acquaintance the\r\nreader has already made at the tavern in the rue Saint-Andre-des-Arts.\r\nHis appearance had as great an effect on the notary as a thunderbolt. He\r\nstood motionless, trembling, breathless; his knees ready to give way\r\nbeneath him; everything black before his eyes. However, he soon pulled\r\nhimself together, and succeeded in overcoming the effects of his\r\nsurprise and terror. He looked once more through the hole in the\r\npartition, and became so absorbed that no one in the whole world could\r\nhave got a word from him just then; the devil himself might have\r\nshrieked into his ears unheeded, and a naked sword suspended over his\r\nhead would not have induced him to change his place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore Mademoiselle de Guerchi had recovered from her fright the\r\ncommander spoke.\r\n\r\n\"As I am a gentleman, my beauty, if you were the Abbess of Montmartre,\r\nyou could not be more difficult of access. I met a blackguard on the\r\nstairs who tried to stop me, and whom I was obliged to thrash soundly.\r\nIs what they told me on my return true? Are you really doing penance,\r\nand do you intend to take the veil?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" answered Angelique, with great dignity, \"whatever may be my\r\nplans, I have a right to be surprised at your violence and at your\r\nintrusion at such an hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Before we go any farther,\" said de Jars, twirling round on his heels,\r\n\"allow me to present to you my nephew, the Chevalier de Moranges.\"\r\n\r\n\"Chevalier de Moranges!\" muttered Quennebert, on whose memory in that\r\ninstant the name became indelibly engraven.\r\n\r\n\"A young man,\" continued the commander, \"who has come back with me from\r\nabroad. Good style, as you see, charming appearance. Now, you young\r\ninnocent, lift up your great black eyes and kiss madame’s hand; I allow\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur le commandeur, leave my room; begone, or I shall call——\"\r\n\r\n\"Whom, then? Your lackeys? But I have beaten the only one you keep, as I\r\ntold you, and it will be some time before he’ll be in a condition to\r\nlight me downstairs: ’Begone,’ indeed! Is that the way you receive an\r\nold friend? Pray be seated, chevalier.\"\r\n\r\nHe approached Mademoiselle de Guerchi, and, despite her resistance,\r\nseized hold of one of her hands, and forcing her to sit down, seated\r\nhimself beside her.\r\n\r\n\"That’s right, my girl,\" said he; \"now let us talk sense. I understand\r\nthat before a stranger you consider yourself obliged to appear\r\nastonished at my ways of going on. But he knows all about us, and\r\nnothing he may see or hear will surprise him. So a truce to prudery! I\r\ncame back yesterday, but I could not make out your hiding-place till\r\nto-day. Now I’m not going to ask you to tell me how you have gone on in\r\nmy absence. God and you alone know, and while He will tell me nothing,\r\nyou would only tell me fibs, and I want to save you from that venial sin\r\nat least. But here I am, in as good spirits as ever, more in love than\r\never, and quite ready to resume my old habits.\"\r\n\r\nMeantime the lady, quite subdued by his noisy entrance and ruffianly\r\nconduct, and seeing that an assumption of dignity would only draw down\r\non her some fresh impertinence, appeared to resign herself to her\r\nposition. All this time Quennebert never took his eyes from the\r\nchevalier, who sat with his face towards the partition. His elegantly\r\ncut costume accentuated his personal advantages. His jet black hair\r\nbrought into relief the whiteness of his forehead; his large dark eyes\r\nwith their veined lids and silky lashes had a penetrating and peculiar\r\nexpression—a mixture of audacity and weakness; his thin and somewhat\r\npale lips were apt to curl in an ironical smile; his hands were of\r\nperfect beauty, his feet of dainty smallness, and he showed with an\r\naffectation of complaisance a well-turned leg above his ample boots, the\r\nturned down tops of which, garnished with lace, fell in irregular folds\r\nover his ankles in the latest fashion. He did not appear to be more than\r\neighteen years of age, and nature had denied his charming face the\r\ndistinctive sign of his sex for not the slightest down was visible on\r\nhis chin, though a little delicate pencilling darkened his upper lip:\r\nHis slightly effeminate style of beauty, the graceful curves of his\r\nfigure, his expression, sometimes coaxing, sometimes saucy, reminding\r\none of a page, gave him the appearance of a charming young scapegrace\r\ndestined to inspire sudden passions and wayward fancies. While his\r\npretended uncle was making himself at home most unceremoniously,\r\nQuennebert remarked that the chevalier at once began to lay siege to his\r\nfair hostess, bestowing tender and love-laden glances on her behind that\r\nuncle’s back. This redoubled his curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"My dear girl,\" said the commander, \"since I saw you last I have come\r\ninto a fortune of one hundred thousand livres, neither more nor less.\r\nOne of my dear aunts took it into her head to depart this life, and her\r\ntemper being crotchety and spiteful she made me her sole heir, in order\r\nto enrage those of her relatives who had nursed her in her illness. One\r\nhundred thousand livres! It’s a round sum—enough to cut a great figure\r\nwith for two years. If you like, we shall squander it together, capital\r\nand interest. Why do you not speak? Has anyone else robbed me by any\r\nchance of your heart? If that were so, I should be in despair, upon my\r\nword-for the sake of the fortunate individual who had won your favour;\r\nfor I will brook no rivals, I give you fair warning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur le commandeur,\" answered Angelique, \"you forget, in speaking\r\nto me in that manner, I have never given you any right to control my\r\nactions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have we severed our connection?\"\r\n\r\nAt this singular question Angelique started, but de Jars continued—\r\n\r\n\"When last we parted we were on the best of terms, were we not? I know\r\nthat some months have elapsed since then, but I have explained to you\r\nthe reason of my absence. Before filling up the blank left by the\r\ndeparted we must give ourselves space to mourn. Well, was I right in my\r\nguess? Have you given me a successor?\"\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Guerchi had hitherto succeeded in controlling her\r\nindignation, and had tried to force herself to drink the bitter cup of\r\nhumiliation to the dregs; but now she could bear it no longer. Having\r\nthrown a look expressive of her suffering at the young chevalier, who\r\ncontinued to ogle her with great pertinacity, she decided on bursting\r\ninto tears, and in a voice broken by sobs she exclaimed that she was\r\nmiserable at being treated in this manner, that she did not deserve it,\r\nand that Heaven was punishing her for her error in yielding to the\r\nentreaties of the commander. One would have sworn she was sincere and\r\nthat the words came from her heart. If Maitre Quennebert had not\r\nwitnessed the scene with Jeannin, if he had not known how frail was the\r\nvirtue of the weeping damsel, he might have been affected by her\r\ntouching plaint. The chevalier appeared to be deeply moved by\r\nAngelique’s grief, and while his, uncle was striding up and down the\r\nroom and swearing like a trooper, he gradually approached her and\r\nexpressed by signs the compassion he felt.\r\n\r\nMeantime the notary was in a strange state of mind. He had not yet made\r\nup his mind whether the whole thing was a joke arranged between de Jars\r\nand Jeannin or not, but of one thing he was quite convinced, the\r\nsympathy which Chevalier de Moranges was expressing by passionate sighs\r\nand glances was the merest hypocrisy. Had he been alone, nothing would\r\nhave prevented his dashing head foremost into this imbroglio, in scorn\r\nof consequence, convinced that his appearance would be as terrible in\r\nits effect as the head of Medusa. But the presence of the widow\r\nrestrained him. Why ruin his future and dry up the golden spring which\r\nhad just begun to gush before his eyes, for the sake of taking part in a\r\nmelodrama? Prudence and self-interest kept him in the side scenes.\r\n\r\nThe tears of the fair one and the glances of the chevalier awoke no\r\nrepentance in the breast of the commander; on the contrary, he began to\r\nvent his anger in terms still more energetic. He strode up and down the\r\noaken floor till it shook under his spurred heels; he stuck his plumed\r\nhat on the side of his head, and displayed the manners of a bully in a\r\nSpanish comedy. Suddenly he seemed to have come to a swift resolution:\r\nthe expression of his face changed from rage to icy coldness, and\r\nwalking up to Angelique, he said, with a composure more terrible than\r\nthe wildest fury—\r\n\r\n\"My rival’s name?\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall never learn it from me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame, his name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never! I have borne your insults too long. I am not responsible to you\r\nfor my actions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I shall learn it, in spite of you, and I know to whom to apply.\r\nDo you think you can play fast and loose with me and my love? No, no! I\r\nused to believe in you; I turned, a deaf ear to your traducers. My mad\r\npassion for you became known; I was the jest and the butt of the town.\r\nBut you have opened my eyes, and at last I see clearly on whom my\r\nvengeance ought to fall. He was formerly my friend, and I would believe\r\nnothing against him; although I was often warned, I took no notice. But\r\nnow I will seek him out, and say to him, ’You have stolen what was mine;\r\nyou are a scoundrel! It must be your life, or mine!’ And if, there is\r\njustice in heaven, I shall kill him! Well, madame, you don’t ask me the\r\nname of this man! You well know whom I mean!\"\r\n\r\nThis threat brought home to Mademoiselle de Guerchi how imminent was her\r\ndanger. At first she had thought the commander’s visit might be a snare\r\nlaid to test her, but the coarseness of his expressions, the cynicism of\r\nhis overtures in the presence of a third person, had convinced her she\r\nwas wrong. No man could have imagined that the revolting method of\r\nseduction employed could meet with success, and if the commander had\r\ndesired to convict her of perfidy he would have come alone and made use\r\nof more persuasive weapons. No, he believed he still had claims on her,\r\nbut even if he had, by his manner of enforcing them he had rendered them\r\nvoid. However, the moment he threatened to seek out a rival whose\r\nidentity he designated quite clearly, and reveal to him the secret it\r\nwas so necessary to her interests to keep hidden, the poor girl lost her\r\nhead. She looked at de Jars with a frightened expression, and said in a\r\ntrembling voice—\r\n\r\n\"I don’t know whom you mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don’t know? Well, I shall commission the king’s treasurer, Jeannin\r\nde Castille, to come here to-morrow and tell you, an hour before our\r\nduel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no! no! Promise me you will not do that!\" cried she, clasping her\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\"Adieu, madame.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not leave me thus! I cannot let you go till you give me your\r\npromise!\"\r\n\r\nShe threw herself on her knees and clung with both her hands to de Jars’\r\ncloak, and appealing to Chevalier de Moranges, said—\r\n\r\n\"You are young, monsieur; I have never done you any harm; protect me,\r\nhave pity on me, help me to soften him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Uncle,\" said the chevalier in a pleading tone, \"be generous, and don’t\r\ndrive this woman to despair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prayers are useless!\" answered the commander.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want me to do?\" said Angelique. \"Shall I go into a convent\r\nto atone? I am ready to go. Shall I promise never to see him again? For\r\nGod’s sake, give me a little time; put off your vengeance for one single\r\nday! To-morrow evening, I swear to you, you will have nothing more to\r\nfear from me. I thought myself forgotten by you and abandoned; and how\r\nshould I think otherwise? You left me without a word of farewell, you\r\nstayed away and never sent me a line! And how do you know that I did not\r\nweep when you deserted me, leaving me to pass my days in monotonous\r\nsolitude? How do you know that I did not make every effort to find out\r\nwhy you were so long absent from my side? You say you had left town but\r\nhow was I to know that? Oh! promise me, if you love me, to give up this\r\nduel! Promise me not to seek that man out to-morrow!\"\r\n\r\nThe poor creature hoped to work wonders with her eloquence, her tears,\r\nher pleading glances. On hearing her prayer for a reprieve of\r\ntwenty-four hours, swearing that after that she would never see Jeannin\r\nagain, the commander and the chevalier were obliged to bite their lips\r\nto keep from laughing outright. But the former soon regained his\r\nself-possession, and while Angelique, still on her knees before him,\r\npressed his hands to her bosom, he forced her to raise her head, and\r\nlooking straight into her eyes, said—\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow, madame, if not this evening, he shall know everything, and a\r\nmeeting shall take place.\"\r\n\r\nThen pushing her away, he strode towards the door.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! how unhappy I am!\" exclaimed Angelique.\r\n\r\nShe tried to rise and rush after him, but whether she was really\r\novercome by her feelings, or whether she felt the one chance of\r\nprevailing left her was to faint, she uttered a heartrending cry, and\r\nthe chevalier had no choice but to support her sinking form.\r\n\r\nDe Jars, on seeing his nephew staggering under this burden, gave a loud\r\nlaugh, and hurried away. Two minutes later he was once more at the\r\ntavern in the rue Saint-Andre-des-Arts.\r\n\r\n\"How’s this? Alone?\" said Jeannin.\r\n\r\n\"Alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have you done with the chevalier?\"\r\n\r\n\"I left him with our charmer, who was unconscious, overcome with grief,\r\nexhausted Ha! ha! ha! She fell fainting into his arms! Ha! ha! ha!\"\r\n\r\n\"It’s quite possible that the young rogue, being left with her in such a\r\ncondition, may cut me out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think so?—Ha! ha! ha!\"\r\n\r\nAnd de Jars laughed so heartily and so infectiously that his worthy\r\nfriend was obliged to join in, and laughed till he choked.\r\n\r\nIn the short silence which followed the departure of the commander,\r\nMaitre Quennebert could hear the widow still murmuring something, but he\r\nwas less disposed than ever to attend to her.\r\n\r\n\"On my word,\" said he, \"the scene now going on is more curious than all\r\nthat went before. I don’t think that a man has ever found himself in\r\nsuch a position as mine. Although my interests demand that I remain here\r\nand listen, yet my fingers are itching to box the ears of that Chevalier\r\nde Moranges. If there were only some way of getting at a proof of all\r\nthis! Ah! now we shall hear something; the hussy is coming to herself.\"\r\n\r\nAnd indeed Angelique had opened her eyes and was casting wild looks\r\naround her; she put her hand to her brow several times, as if trying to\r\nrecall clearly what had happened.\r\n\r\n\"Is he gone?\" she exclaimed at last. \"Oh, why did you let him go? You\r\nshould not have minded me, but kept him here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be calm,\" answered the chevalier, \"be calm, for heaven’s sake. I shall\r\nspeak to my uncle and prevent his ruining your prospects. Only don’t\r\nweep any more, your tears break my heart. Ah, my God! how cruel it is to\r\ndistress you so! I should never be able to withstand your tears; no\r\nmatter what reason I had for anger, a look from you would make me\r\nforgive you everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Noble young man!\" said Angelique.\r\n\r\n\"Idiot!\" muttered Maitre Quennebert; \"swallow the honey of his words, do\r\nBut how the deuce is it going to end? Not Satan himself ever invented\r\nsuch a situation.\"\r\n\r\n\"But then I could never believe you guilty without proof, irrefutable\r\nproof; and even then a word from you would fill my mind with doubt and\r\nuncertainty again. Yes, were the whole world to accuse you and swear to\r\nyour guilt, I should still believe your simple word. I am young, madam,\r\nI have never known love as yet—until an instant ago I had no idea that\r\nmore quickly than an image can excite the admiration of the eye, a\r\nthought can enter the heart and stir it to its depths, and features that\r\none may never again behold leave a lifelong memory behind. But even if a\r\nwoman of whom I knew absolutely nothing were to appeal to me,\r\nexclaiming, ’I implore your help, your protection!’ I should, without\r\nstopping to consider, place my sword and my arm at her disposal, and\r\ndevote myself to her service. How much more eagerly would I die for you,\r\nmadam, whose beauty has ravished my heart! What do you demand of me?\r\nTell me what you desire me to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prevent this duel; don’t allow an interview to take place between your\r\nuncle and the man whom he mentioned. Tell me you will do this, and I\r\nshall be safe; for you have never learned to lie; I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course he hasn’t, you may be sure of that, you simpleton!\" muttered\r\nMaitre Quennebert in his corner. \"If you only knew what a mere novice\r\nyou are at that game compared with the chevalier! If you only knew whom\r\nyou had before you!\"\r\n\r\n\"At your age,\" went on Angelique, \"one cannot feign—the heart is not yet\r\nhardened, and is capable of compassion. But a dreadful idea occurs to\r\nme—a horrible suspicion! Is it all a devilish trick—a snare arranged in\r\njoke? Tell me that it is not all a pretence! A poor woman encounters so\r\nmuch perfidy. Men amuse themselves by troubling her heart and confusing\r\nher mind; they excite her vanity, they compass her round with homage,\r\nwith flattery, with temptation, and when they grow tired of fooling her,\r\nthey despise and insult her. Tell me, was this all a preconcerted plan?\r\nThis love, this jealousy, were they only acted?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, madame,\" broke in the chevalier, with an expression of the deepest\r\nindignation, \"how can you for an instant imagine that a human heart\r\ncould be so perverted? I am not acquainted with the man whom the\r\ncommander accused you of loving, but whoever he may be I feel sure that\r\nhe is worthy of your love, and that he would never have consented to\r\nsuch a dastardly joke. Neither would my uncle; his jealousy mastered him\r\nand drove him mad—\r\n\r\n\"But I am not dependent on him; I am my own master, and can do as I\r\nplease. I will hinder this duel; I will not allow the illusion and\r\nignorance of him who loves you and, alas that I must say it, whom you\r\nlove, to be dispelled, for it is in them he finds his happiness. Be\r\nhappy with him! As for me, I shall never see you again; but the\r\nrecollection of this meeting, the joy of having served you, will be my\r\nconsolation.\"\r\n\r\nAngelique raised her beautiful eyes, and gave the chevalier a long look\r\nwhich expressed her gratitude more eloquently than words.\r\n\r\n\"May I be hanged!\" thought Maitre Quennebert, \"if the baggage isn’t\r\nmaking eyes at him already! But one who is drowning clutches at a\r\nstraw.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough, madam,\" said the chevalier; \"I understand all you would say.\r\nYou thank me in his name, and ask me to leave you: I obey-yes, madame, I\r\nam going; at the risk of my life I will prevent this meeting, I will\r\nstifle this fatal revelation. But grant me one last prayer-permit me to\r\nlook forward to seeing you once more before I leave this city, to which\r\nI wish I had never come. But I shall quit it in a day or two, to-morrow\r\nperhaps—as soon as I know that your happiness is assured. Oh! do not\r\nrefuse my last request; let the light of your eyes shine on me for the\r\nlast time; after that I shall depart—I shall fly far away for ever. But\r\nif perchance, in spite of every effort, I fail, if the commander’s\r\njealousy should make him impervious to my entreaties—to my tears, if he\r\nwhom you love should come and overwhelm you with reproaches and then\r\nabandon you, would you drive me from your presence if I should then say,\r\n’I love you’? Answer me, I beseech you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go!\" said she, \"and prove worthy of my gratitude—or my love.\"\r\n\r\nSeizing one of her hands, the chevalier covered it with passionate\r\nkisses.\r\n\r\n\"Such barefaced impudence surpasses everything I could have imagined!\"\r\nmurmured Quennebert: \"fortunately, the play is over for to-night; if it\r\nhad gone on any longer, I should have done something foolish. The lady\r\nhardly imagines what the end of the comedy will be.\"\r\n\r\nNeither did Quennebert. It was an evening of adventures. It was written\r\nthat in the space of two hours Angelique was to run the gamut of all the\r\nemotions, experience all the vicissitudes to which a life such as she\r\nled is exposed: hope, fear, happiness, mortification, falsehood, love\r\nthat was no love, intrigue within intrigue, and, to crown all, a totally\r\nunexpected conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chevalier was still holding Angelique’s hand when a step resounded\r\noutside, and a voice was heard.\r\n\r\n\"Can it be that he has come back?\" exclaimed the damsel, hastily freeing\r\nherself from the passionate embrace of the chevalier. \"It’s not\r\npossible! Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! it’s his voice!\"\r\n\r\nShe grew pale to the lips, and stood staring at the door with\r\noutstretched arms, unable to advance or recede.\r\n\r\nThe chevalier listened, but felt sure the approaching voice belonged\r\nneither to the commander nor to the treasurer.\r\n\r\n\"’His voice’?\" thought Quennebert to himself. \"Can this be yet another\r\naspirant to her favour?\"\r\n\r\nThe sound came nearer.\r\n\r\n\"Hide yourself!\" said Angelique, pointing to a door opposite to the\r\npartition behind which the widow and the notary were ensconced. \"Hide\r\nyourself there!—there’s a secret staircase—you can get out that way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hide myself!\" exclaimed Moranges, with a swaggering air. \"What are\r\nyou thinking of? I remain.\"\r\n\r\nIt would have been better for him to have followed her advice, as may\r\nvery well have occurred to the youth two minutes later, as a tall,\r\nmuscular young man entered in a state of intense excitement. Angelique\r\nrushed to meet him, crying—\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Monsieur le duc, is it you?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is this I hear, Angelique?\" said the Duc de Vitry. \"I was told\r\nbelow that three men had visited you this evening; but only two have\r\ngone out—where is the third? Ha! I do not need long to find him,\" he\r\nadded, as he caught sight of the chevalier, who stood his ground bravely\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n\"In Heaven’s name!\" cried Angelique,—\"in Heaven’s name, listen to me!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, not a word. Just now I am not questioning you. Who are you,\r\nsir?\"\r\n\r\nThe chevalier’s teasing and bantering disposition made him even at that\r\ncritical moment insensible to fear, so he retorted insolently—\r\n\r\n\"Whoever I please to be, sir; and on my word I find the tone in which\r\nyou put your question delightfully amusing.\"\r\n\r\nThe duke sprang forward in a rage, laying his hand on his sword.\r\nAngelique tried in vain to restrain him.\r\n\r\n\"You want to screen him from my vengeance, you false one!\" said he,\r\nretreating a few steps, so as to guard the door. \"Defend your life,\r\nsir!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you defend yours!\"\r\n\r\nBoth drew at the same moment.\r\n\r\nTwo shrieks followed, one in the room, the other behind the tapestry,\r\nfor neither Angelique nor the widow had been able to restrain her alarm\r\nas the two swords flashed in air. In fact the latter had been so\r\nfrightened that she fell heavily to the floor in a faint.\r\n\r\nThis incident probably saved the young man’s life; his blood had already\r\nbegun to run cold at the sight of his adversary foaming with rage and\r\nstanding between him and the door, when the noise of the fall distracted\r\nthe duke’s attention.\r\n\r\n\"What was that?\" he cried. \"Are there other enemies concealed here too?\"\r\nAnd forgetting that he was leaving a way of escape free, he rushed in\r\nthe direction from which the sound came, and lunged at the\r\ntapestry-covered partition with his sword. Meantime the chevalier,\r\ndropping all his airs of bravado, sprang from one end of the room to the\r\nother like a cat pursued by a dog; but rapid as were his movements, the\r\nduke perceived his flight, and dashed after him at the risk of breaking\r\nboth his own neck and the chevalier’s by a chase through unfamiliar\r\nrooms and down stairs which were plunged in darkness.\r\n\r\nAll this took place in a few seconds, like a flash of lightning. Twice,\r\nwith hardly any interval, the street door opened and shut noisily, and\r\nthe two enemies were in the street, one pursued and the other pursuing.\r\n\r\n\"My God! Just to think of all that has happened is enough to make one\r\ndie of fright!\" said Mademoiselle de Guerchi. \"What will come next, I\r\nshould like to know? And what shall I say to the duke when he comes\r\nback?\"\r\n\r\nJust at this instant a loud cracking sound was heard in the room.\r\nAngelique stood still, once more struck with terror, and recollecting\r\nthe cry she had heard. Her hair, which was already loosened, escaped\r\nentirely from its bonds, and she felt it rise on her head as the figures\r\non the tapestry moved and bent towards her. Falling on her knees and\r\nclosing her eyes, she began to invoke the aid of God and all the saints.\r\nBut she soon felt herself raised by strong arms, and looking round, she\r\nfound herself in the presence of an unknown man, who seemed to have\r\nissued from the ground or the walls, and who, seizing the only light\r\nleft unextinguished in the scuffle, dragged her more dead than alive\r\ninto the next room.\r\n\r\nThis man was, as the reader will have already guessed, Maitre\r\nQuennebert. As soon as the chevalier and the duke had disappeared, the\r\nnotary had run towards the corner where the widow lay, and having made\r\nsure that she was really unconscious, and unable to see or hear\r\nanything, so that it would be quite safe to tell her any story he\r\npleased next day, he returned to his former position, and applying his\r\nshoulder to the partition, easily succeeded in freeing the ends of the\r\nrotten laths from the nails which held there, and, pushing them before\r\nhim, made an aperture large enough to allow of his passing through into\r\nthe next apartment. He applied himself to this task with such vigour,\r\nand became so absorbed in its accomplishment, that he entirely forgot\r\nthe bag of twelve hundred livres which the widow had given him.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you? What do you want with me?\" cried Mademoiselle de Guerchi,\r\nstruggling to free herself.\r\n\r\n\"Silence!\" was Quennebert’s answer.\r\n\r\n\"Don’t kill me, for pity’s sake!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who wants to kill you? But be silent; I don’t want your shrieks to call\r\npeople here. I must be alone with you for a few moments. Once more I\r\ntell you to be quiet, unless you want me to use violence. If you do what\r\nI tell you, no harm shall happen to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But who are you, monsieur?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am neither a burglar nor a murderer; that’s all you need to know; the\r\nrest is no concern of yours. Have you writing materials at hand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, monsieur; there they are, on that table.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well. Now sit down at the table.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sit down, and answer my questions.\"\r\n\r\n\"The first man who visited you this evening was M. Jeannin, was he not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, M. Jeannin de Castille.\"\r\n\r\n\"The king’s treasurer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. The second was Commander de Jars, and the young man he\r\nbrought with him was his nephew, the Chevalier de Moranges. The last\r\ncomer was a duke; am I not right?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Duc de Vitry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now write from my dictation.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke very slowly, and Mademoiselle de Guerchi, obeying his commands,\r\ntook up her pen.\r\n\r\n\"’To-day,’\" dictated Quennebert,—\"’to-day, this twentieth day of the\r\nmonth of November, in the year of the Lord 1658, I—\r\n\r\n\"What is your full name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Angelique-Louise de Guerchi.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on! ’I, Angelique-Louise de Guerchi, was visited, in the rooms\r\nwhich—I occupy, in the mansion of the Duchesse d’Etampes, corner of the\r\nstreets Git-le-Coeur and du Hurepoix, about half-past seven o’clock in\r\nthe evening, in the first place, by Messire Jeannin de Castille, King’s\r\nTreasurer; in the second place, by Commander de Jars, who was\r\naccompanied by a young man, his nephew, the Chevalier de Moranges; in\r\nthe third place, after the departure of Commander de Jars, and while I\r\nwas alone with the Chevalier de Moranges, by the Duc de Vitry, who drew\r\nhis sword upon the said chevalier and forced him to take flight.’\r\n\r\n\"Now put in a line by itself, and use capitals \"’DESCRIPTION OF THE\r\nCHEVALIER DE MORANGES.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I only saw him for an instant,\" said Angelique, \"and I can’t\r\nrecall——\r\n\r\n\"Write, and don’t talk. I can recall everything, and that is all that is\r\nwanted.\"\r\n\r\n\"’Height about five feet.’ The chevalier,\" said Quennebert, interrupting\r\nhimself, \"is four feet eleven inches three lines and a half, but I don’t\r\nneed absolute exactness.\" Angelique gazed at him in utter stupefaction.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know him, then?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"I saw him this evening for the first time, but my eye is very accurate.\r\n\r\n\"’Height about five feet; hair black, eyes ditto, nose aquiline, mouth\r\nlarge, lips compressed, forehead high, face oval, complexion pale, no\r\nbeard.’\r\n\r\n\"Now another line, and in capitals: \"’SPECIAL MARKS.’\r\n\r\n\"’A small mole on the neck behind the right ear, a smaller mole on the\r\nleft hand.’\r\n\r\n\"Have you written that? Now sign it with your full name.\"\r\n\r\n\"What use are you going to make of this paper?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should have told you before, if I had desired you to know. Any\r\nquestions are quite useless. I don’t enjoin secrecy on you, however,\"\r\nadded the notary, as he folded the paper and put it into his doublet\r\npocket. \"You are quite free to tell anyone you like that you have\r\nwritten the description of the Chevalier de Moranges at the dictation of\r\nan unknown man, who got into your room you don’t know how, by the\r\nchimney or through the ceiling perhaps, but who was determined to leave\r\nit by a more convenient road. Is there not a secret staircase? Show me\r\nwhere it is. I don’t want to meet anyone on my way out.\"\r\n\r\nAngelique pointed out a door to him hidden by a damask curtain, and\r\nQuennebert saluting her, opened it and disappeared, leaving Angelique\r\nconvinced that she had seen the devil in person. Not until the next day\r\ndid the sight of the displaced partition explain the apparition, but\r\neven then so great was her fright, so deep was the terror which the\r\nrecollection of the mysterious man inspired, that despite the permission\r\nto tell what had happened she mentioned her adventure to no one, and did\r\nnot even complain to her neighbour, Madame Rapally, of the\r\ninquisitiveness which had led the widow to spy on her actions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nWe left de Jars and Jeannin, roaring with laughter, in the tavern in the\r\nrue Saint Andre-des-Arts.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" said the treasurer, \"do you really think that Angelique thought\r\nI was in earnest in my offer?—that she believes in all good faith I\r\nintend to marry her?\"\r\n\r\n\"You may take my word for it. If it were not so, do you imagine she\r\nwould have been in such desperation? Would she have fainted at my threat\r\nto tell you that I had claims on her as well as you? To get married!\r\nWhy, that is the goal of all such creatures, and there is not one of\r\nthem who can understand why a man of honour should blush to give her his\r\nname. If you had only seen her terror, her tears! They would have either\r\nbroken your heart or killed you with laughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Jeannin, \"it is getting late. Are we going to wait for the\r\nchevalier?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us call, for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well. Perhaps he has made up his mind to stay. If so, we shall\r\nmake a horrible scene, cry treachery and perjury, and trounce your\r\nnephew well. Let’s settle our score and be off.\"\r\n\r\nThey left the wine-shop, both rather the worse for the wine they had so\r\nlargely indulged in. They felt the need of the cool night air, so\r\ninstead of going down the rue Pavee they resolved to follow the rue\r\nSaint-Andre-des-Arts as far as the Pont Saint-Michel, so as to reach the\r\nmansion by a longer route.\r\n\r\nAt the very moment the commander got up to leave the tavern the\r\nchevalier had run out of the mansion at the top of his speed. It was not\r\nthat he had entirely lost his courage, for had he found it impossible to\r\navoid his assailant it is probable that he would have regained the\r\naudacity which had led him to draw his sword. But he was a novice in the\r\nuse of arms, had not reached full physical development, and felt that\r\nthe chances were so much against him that he would only have faced the\r\nencounter if there were no possible way of escape. On leaving the house\r\nhe had turned quickly into the rue Git-le-Coeur; but on hearing the door\r\nclose behind his pursuer he disappeared down the narrow and crooked rue\r\nde l’Hirondelle, hoping to throw the Duc de Vitry off the scent. The\r\nduke, however, though for a moment in doubt, was guided by the sound of\r\nthe flying footsteps. The chevalier, still trying to send him off on a\r\nfalse trail, turned to the right, and so regained the upper end of the\r\nrue Saint-Andre, and ran along it as far as the church, the site of\r\nwhich is occupied by the square of the same name to-day. Here he thought\r\nhe would be safe, for, as the church was being restored and enlarged,\r\nheaps of stone stood all round the old pile. He glided in among these,\r\nand twice heard Vitry searching quite close to him, and each time stood\r\non guard expecting an onslaught. This marching and counter-marching\r\nlasted for some minutes; the chevalier began to hope he had escaped the\r\ndanger, and eagerly waited for the moment when the moon which had broken\r\nthrough the clouds should again withdraw behind them, in order to steal\r\ninto some of the adjacent streets under cover of the darkness. Suddenly\r\na shadow rose before him and a threatening voice cried—\r\n\r\n\"Have I caught you at last, you coward?\"\r\n\r\nThe danger in which the chevalier stood awoke in him a flickering\r\nenergy, a feverish courage, and he crossed blades with his assailant. A\r\nstrange combat ensued, of which the result was quite uncertain,\r\ndepending entirely on chance; for no science was of any avail on a\r\nground so rough that the combatants stumbled at every step, or struck\r\nagainst immovable masses, which were one moment clearly lit up, and the\r\nnext in shadow. Steel clashed on steel, the feet of the adversaries\r\ntouched each other, several times the cloak of one was pierced by the\r\nsword of the other, more than once the words \"Die then!\" rang out. But\r\neach time the seemingly vanquished combatant sprang up unwounded, as\r\nagile and as lithe and as quick as ever, while he in his turn pressed\r\nthe enemy home. There was neither truce nor pause, no clever feints nor\r\nfencer’s tricks could be employed on either side; it was a mortal\r\ncombat, but chance, not skill, would deal the death-blow. Sometimes a\r\nrapid pass encountered only empty air; sometimes blade crossed blade\r\nabove the wielders’ heads; sometimes the fencers lunged at each other’s\r\nbreast, and yet the blows glanced aside at the last moment and the\r\nblades met in air once more. At last, however, one of the two, making a\r\npass to the right which left his breast unguarded, received a deep\r\nwound. Uttering a loud cry, he recoiled a step or two, but, exhausted by\r\nthe effort, tripped and fell backward over a large stone, and lay there\r\nmotionless, his arms extended in the form of a cross.\r\n\r\nThe other turned and fled.\r\n\r\n\"Hark, de Jars!\" said Jeannin, stopping, \"There’s fighting going on\r\nhereabouts; I hear the clash of swords.\"\r\n\r\nBoth listened intently.\r\n\r\n\"I hear nothing now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush! there it goes again. It’s by the church.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a dreadful cry!\"\r\n\r\nThey ran at full speed towards the place whence it seemed to come, but\r\nfound only solitude, darkness, and silence. They looked in every\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n\"I can’t see a living soul,\" said Jeannin, \"and I very much fear that\r\nthe poor devil who gave that yell has mumbled his last prayer.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don’t know why I tremble so,\" replied de Jars; \"that heart-rending\r\ncry made me shiver from head to foot. Was it not something like the\r\nchevalier’s voice?\"\r\n\r\n\"The chevalier is with La Guerchi, and even if he had left her this\r\nwould not have been his way to rejoin us. Let us go on and leave the\r\ndead in peace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look, Jeannin! what is that in front of us?\"\r\n\r\n\"On that stone? A man who has fallen!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and bathed in blood,\" exclaimed de Jars, who had darted to his\r\nside. \"Ah! it’s he! it’s he! Look, his eyes are closed, his hands cold!\r\nMy child he does not hear me! Oh, who has murdered him?\"\r\n\r\nHe fell on his knees, and threw himself on the body with every mark of\r\nthe most violent despair.\r\n\r\n\"Come, come,\" said Jeannin, surprised at such an explosion of grief from\r\na man accustomed to duels, and who on several similar occasions had been\r\nfar from displaying much tenderness of heart, \"collect yourself, and\r\ndon’t give way like a woman. Perhaps the wound is not mortal. Let us try\r\nto stop the bleeding and call for help.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no—\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you mad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don’t call, for Heaven’s sake! The wound is here, near the heart. Your\r\nhandkerchief, Jeannin, to arrest the flow of blood. There—now help me to\r\nlift him.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does that mean?\" cried Jeannin, who had just laid his hand on the\r\nchevalier. \"I don’t know whether I’m awake or asleep! Why, it’s a—-\"\r\n\r\n\"Be silent, on your life! I shall explain everything—but now be silent;\r\nthere is someone looking at us.\"\r\n\r\nThere was indeed a man wrapped in a mantle standing motionless some\r\nsteps away.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" asked de Jars.\r\n\r\n\"May I ask what you are doing, gentlemen?\" retorted Maitre Quennebert,\r\nin a calm and steady voice.\r\n\r\n\"Your curiosity may cost you dear, monsieur; we are not in the habit of\r\nallowing our actions to be spied on.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I am not in the habit of running useless risks, most noble\r\ncavaliers. You are, it is true, two against one; but,\" he added,\r\nthrowing back his cloak and grasping the hilts of a pair of pistols\r\ntucked in his belt, \"these will make us equal. You are mistaken as to my\r\nintentions. I had no thought of playing the spy; it was chance alone\r\nthat led me here; and you must acknowledge that finding you in this\r\nlonely spot, engaged as you are at this hour of the night, was quite\r\nenough to awake the curiosity of a man as little disposed to provoke a\r\nquarrel as to submit to threats.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was chance also that brought us here. We were crossing the square,\r\nmy friend and I, when we heard groans. We followed the sound, and found\r\nthis young gallant, who is a stranger to us, lying here, with a wound in\r\nhis breast.\"\r\n\r\nAs the moon at that moment gleamed doubtfully forth, Maitre Quennebert\r\nbent for an instant over the body of the wounded man, and said:\r\n\r\n\"I know him more than you. But supposing someone were to come upon us\r\nhere, we might easily be taken for three assassins holding a\r\nconsultation over the corpse of our victim. What were you going to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Take him to a doctor. It would be inhuman to leave him here, and while\r\nwe are talking precious time is being lost.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you belong to this neighbourhood?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the treasurer.\r\n\r\n\"Neither do I,\" said Quennebert. \"but I believe I have heard the name of\r\na surgeon who lives close by, in the rue Hauteville.\"\r\n\r\n\"I also know of one,\" interposed de Jars, \"a very skilful man.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may command me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gladly, monsieur; for he lives some distance from here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am at your service.\"\r\n\r\nDe Jars and Jeannin raised the chevalier’s shoulders, and the stranger\r\nsupported his legs, and carrying their burden in this order, they set\r\noff.\r\n\r\nThey walked slowly, looking about them carefully, a precaution rendered\r\nnecessary by the fact that the moon now rode in a cloudless sky. They\r\nglided over the Pont Saint-Michel between the houses that lined both\r\nsides, and, turning to the right, entered one of the narrow streets of\r\nthe Cite, and after many turnings, during which they met no one, they\r\nstopped at the door of a house situated behind the Hotel-de-Ville.\r\n\r\n\"Many thanks, monsieur,\" said de Jars,—\"many thanks; we need no further\r\nhelp.\"\r\n\r\nAs the commander spoke, Maitre Quennebert let the feet of the chevalier\r\nfall abruptly on the pavement, while de Jars and the treasurer still\r\nsupported his body, and, stepping back two paces, he drew his pistols\r\nfrom his belt, and placing a finger on each trigger, said—\r\n\r\n\"Do not stir, messieurs, or you are dead men.\" Both, although encumbered\r\nby their burden, laid their hands upon their swords.\r\n\r\n\"Not a movement, not a sound, or I shoot.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no reply to this argument, it being a convincing one even for\r\ntwo duellists. The bravest man turns pale when he finds himself face to\r\nface with sudden inevitable death, and he who threatened seemed to be\r\none who would, without hesitation, carry out his threats. There was\r\nnothing for it but obedience, or a ball through them as they stood.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want with us, sir?\" asked Jeannin.\r\n\r\nQuennebert, without changing his attitude, replied—\r\n\r\n\"Commander de Jars, and you, Messire Jeannin de Castille, king’s\r\ntreasurer,—you see, my gentles, that besides the advantage of arms which\r\nstrike swiftly and surely, I have the further advantage of knowing who\r\nyou are, whilst I am myself unknown,—you will carry the wounded man into\r\nthis house, into which I will not enter, for I have nothing to do\r\nwithin; but I shall remain here; to await your return. After you have\r\nhanded over the patient to the doctor, you will procure paper and\r\nwrite—-now pay great attention—that on November 20th, 1658, about\r\nmidnight, you, aided by an unknown man, carried to this house, the\r\naddress of which you will give, a young man whom you call the Chevalier\r\nde Moranges, and pass off as your nephew—\"\r\n\r\n\"As he really is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well.\"\r\n\r\n\"But who told you—?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me go on: who had been wounded in a fight with swords on the same\r\nnight behind the church of Saint-Andre-des-Arts by the Duc de Vitry.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Duc de Vitry!—How do you know that?\"\r\n\r\n\"No matter how, I know it for a fact. Having made this declaration, you\r\nwill add that the said Chevalier de Moranges is no other than\r\nJosephine-Charlotte Boullenois, whom you, commander, abducted four\r\nmonths ago from the convent of La Raquette, whom you have made your\r\nmistress, and whom you conceal disguised as a man; then you will add\r\nyour signature. Is my information correct?\"\r\n\r\nDe Jars and Jeannin were speechless with surprise for a few instants;\r\nthen the former stammered—\r\n\r\n\"Will you tell us who you are?\"\r\n\r\n\"The devil in person, if you like. Well, will you do as I order?\r\nSupposing that I am awkward enough not to kill you at two paces, do you\r\nwant me to ask you in broad daylight and aloud what I now ask at night\r\nand in a whisper? And don’t think to put me off with a false\r\ndeclaration, relying on my not being able to read it by the light of the\r\nmoon; don’t think either that you can take me by surprise when you hand\r\nit me: you will bring it to me with your swords sheathed as now. If this\r\ncondition is not observed, I shall fire, and the noise will bring a\r\ncrowd about us. To-morrow I shall speak differently from to-day: I shall\r\nproclaim the truth at all the street corners, in the squares, and under\r\nthe windows of the Louvre. It is hard, I know, for men of spirit to\r\nyield to threats, but recollect that you are in my power and that there\r\nis no disgrace in paying a ransom for a life that one cannot defend.\r\nWhat do you say?\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of his natural courage, Jeannin, who found himself involved in\r\nan affair from which he had nothing to gain, and who was not at all\r\ndesirous of being suspected of having helped in an abduction, whispered\r\nto the commander—\r\n\r\n\"Faith! I think our wisest course is to consent.\"\r\n\r\nDe Jars, however, before replying, wished to try if he could by any\r\nchance throw his enemy off his guard for an instant, so as to take him\r\nunawares. His hand still rested on the hilt of his sword, motionless,\r\nbut ready to draw.\r\n\r\n\"There is someone coming over yonder,\" he cried,—\"do you hear?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can’t catch me in that way,\" said Quennebert. \"Even were there\r\nanyone coming, I should not look round, and if you move your hand all is\r\nover with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Jeannin, \"I surrender at discretion—not on my own account,\r\nbut out of regard for my friend and this woman. However, we are entitled\r\nto some pledge of your silence. This statement that you demand, once\r\nwritten,—you can ruin us tomorrow by its means.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don’t yet know what use I shall make of it, gentlemen. Make up your\r\nminds, or you will have nothing but a dead body to place—in the doctor’s\r\nhands. There is no escape for you.\"\r\n\r\nFor the first time the wounded man faintly groaned.\r\n\r\n\"I must save her!\" cried de Jars,—\"I yield.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I swear upon my honour that I will never try to get this woman out\r\nof your hands, and that I will never interfere with your conquest.\r\nKnock, gentlemen, and remain as long as may be necessary. I am patient.\r\nPray to God, if you will, that she may recover; my one desire is that\r\nshe may die.\"\r\n\r\nThey entered the house, and Quennebert, wrapping himself once more in\r\nhis mantle, walked up and down before it, stopping to listen from time\r\nto time. In about two hours the commander and the treasurer came out\r\nagain, and handed him a written paper in the manner agreed on.\r\n\r\n\"I greatly fear that it will be a certificate of death,\" said de Jars.\r\n\r\n\"Heaven grant it, commander! Adieu, messieurs.\"\r\n\r\nHe then withdrew, walking backwards, keeping the two friends covered\r\nwith his pistols until he had placed a sufficient distance between\r\nhimself and them to be out of danger of an attack.\r\n\r\nThe two gentlemen on their part walked rapidly away, looking round from\r\ntime to time, and keeping their ears open. They were very much mortified\r\nat having been forced to let a mere boor dictate to them, and anxious,\r\nespecially de Jars, as to the result of the wound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day following this extraordinary series of adventures,\r\nexplanations between those who were mixed up in them, whether as actors\r\nor spectators, were the order of the day. It was not till Maitre\r\nQuennebert reached the house of the friend who had offered to put him up\r\nfor the night that it first dawned on him, that the interest which the\r\nChevalier de Moranges had awakened in his mind had made him utterly\r\nforget the bag containing the twelve hundred livres which he owed to the\r\ngenerosity of the widow. This money being necessary to him, he went back\r\nto her early next morning. He found her hardly recovered from her\r\nterrible fright. Her swoon had lasted far beyond the time when the\r\nnotary had left the house; and as Angelique, not daring to enter the\r\nbewitched room, had taken refuge in the most distant corner of her\r\napartments, the feeble call of the widow was heard by no one. Receiving\r\nno answer, Madame Rapally groped her way into the next room, and finding\r\nthat empty, buried herself beneath the bedclothes, and passed the rest\r\nof the night dreaming of drawn swords, duels, and murders. As soon as it\r\nwas light she ventured into the mysterious room once more; without\r\ncalling her servants, and found the bag of crowns lying open on the\r\nfloor, with the coins scattered all around, the partition broken, and\r\nthe tapestry hanging from it in shreds. The widow was near fainting\r\nagain: she imagined at first she saw stains of blood everywhere, but a\r\ncloser inspection having somewhat reassured her, she began to pick up\r\nthe coins that had rolled to right and left, and was agreeably surprised\r\nto find the tale complete. But how and why had Maitre Quennebert\r\nabandoned them? What had become of him? She had got lost in the most\r\nabsurd suppositions and conjectures when the notary appeared.\r\nDiscovering from the first words she uttered that she was in complete\r\nignorance of all that had taken place, he explained to her that when the\r\ninterview between the chevalier and Mademoiselle de Guerchi had just at\r\nthe most interesting moment been so unceremoniously interrupted by the\r\narrival of the duke, he had become so absorbed in watching them that he\r\nhad not noticed that the partition was bending before the pressure of\r\nhis body, and that just as the duke drew his sword it suddenly gave way,\r\nand he, Quennebert, being thus left without support, tumbled head\r\nforemost into the next room, among a perfect chaos of overturned\r\nfurniture and lamps; that almost before he could rise he was forced to\r\ndraw in self-defence, and had to make his escape, defending himself\r\nagainst both the duke and the chevalier; that they had pursued him so\r\nhotly, that when he found himself free he was too far from the house and\r\nthe hour was too advanced to admit of his returning, Quennebert added\r\ninnumerable protestations of friendship, devotion, and gratitude, and,\r\nfurnished with his twelve hundred crowns, went away, leaving the widow\r\nreassured as to his safety, but still shaken from her fright.\r\n\r\nWhile the notary was thus soothing the widow, Angelique was exhausting\r\nall the expedients her trade had taught her in the attempt to remove the\r\nduke’s suspicions. She asserted she was the victim of an unforeseen\r\nattack which nothing in her conduct had ever authorised. The young\r\nChevalier de Moranges had, gained admittance, she declared, under the\r\npretext that he brought her news from the duke, the one man who occupied\r\nher thoughts, the sole object of her love. The chevalier had seen her\r\nlover, he said, a few days before, and by cleverly appealing to things\r\nback, he had led her to fear that the duke had grown tired of her, and\r\nthat a new conquest was the cause of his absence. She had not believed\r\nthese insinuations, although his long silence would have justified the\r\nmost mortifying suppositions, the most cruel doubts. At length the\r\nchevalier had grown bolder, and had declared his passion for her;\r\nwhereupon she had risen and ordered him to leave her. Just at that\r\nmoment the duke had entered, and had taken the natural agitation and\r\nconfusion of the chevalier as signs of her guilt. Some explanation was\r\nalso necessary to account for the presence of the two other visitors of\r\nwhom he had been told below stairs. As he knew nothing at all about\r\nthem, the servant who admitted them never having seen either of them\r\nbefore, she acknowledged that two gentlemen had called earlier in the\r\nevening; that they had refused to send in their names, but as they had\r\nsaid they had come to inquire about the duke, she suspected them of\r\nhaving been in league with the chevalier in the attempt to ruin her\r\nreputation, perhaps they had even promised to help him to carry her off,\r\nbut she knew nothing positive about them or their plans. The duke,\r\ncontrary to his wont, did not allow himself to be easily convinced by\r\nthese lame explanations, but unfortunately for him the lady knew how to\r\nassume an attitude favourable to her purpose. She had been induced, she\r\nsaid, with the simple confidence born of love, to listen to people who\r\nhad led her to suppose they could give her news of one so dear to her as\r\nthe duke. From this falsehood she proceeded to bitter reproaches:\r\ninstead of defending herself, she accused him of having left her a prey\r\nto anxiety; she went so far as to imply that there must be some\r\nfoundation for the hints of the chevalier, until at last the duke,\r\nalthough he was not guilty of the slightest infidelity, and had\r\nexcellent reasons to give in justification of his silence, was soon\r\nreduced to a penitent mood, and changed his threats into entreaties for\r\nforgiveness. As to the shriek he had heard, and which he was sure had\r\nbeen uttered by the stranger who had forced his way into her room after\r\nthe departure of the others, she asserted that his ears must have\r\ndeceived him. Feeling that therein lay her best chance of making things\r\nsmooth, she exerted herself to convince him that there was no need for\r\nother information than she could give, and did all she could to blot the\r\nwhole affair from his memory; and her success was such that at the end\r\nof the interview the duke was more enamoured and more credulous than\r\never, and believing he had done her wrong, he delivered himself up to\r\nher, bound hand and foot. Two days later he installed his mistress in\r\nanother dwelling....\r\n\r\nMadame Rapally also resolved to give up her rooms, and removed to a\r\nhouse that belonged to her, on the Pont Saint-Michel.\r\n\r\nThe commander took the condition of Charlotte Boullenois very much to\r\nheart. The physician under whose care he had placed her, after examining\r\nher wounds, had not given much hope of her recovery. It was not that de\r\nJars was capable of a lasting love, but Charlotte was young and\r\npossessed great beauty, and the romance and mystery surrounding their\r\nconnection gave it piquancy. Charlotte’s disguise, too, which enabled de\r\nJars to conceal his success and yet flaunt it in the face, as it were,\r\nof public morality and curiosity, charmed him by its audacity, and above\r\nall he was carried away by the bold and uncommon character of the girl,\r\nwho, not content with a prosaic intrigue, had trampled underfoot all\r\nsocial prejudices and proprieties, and plunged at once into unmeasured\r\nand unrestrained dissipation; the singular mingling in her nature of the\r\nvices of both sexes; the unbridled licentiousness of the courtesan\r\ncoupled with the devotion of a man for horses, wine, and fencing; in\r\nshort, her eccentric character, as it would now be called, kept a\r\npassion alive which would else have quickly died away in his blase\r\nheart. Nothing would induce him to follow Jeannin’s advice to leave\r\nParis for at least a few weeks, although he shared Jeannin’s fear that\r\nthe statement they had been forced to give the stranger would bring them\r\ninto trouble. The treasurer, who had no love affair on hand, went off;\r\nbut the commander bravely held his ground, and at the end of five or six\r\ndays, during which no one disturbed him, began to think the only result\r\nof the incident would be the anxiety it had caused him.\r\n\r\nEvery evening as soon as it was dark he betook himself to the doctor’s,\r\nwrapped in his cloak, armed to the teeth, and his hat pulled down over\r\nhis eyes. For two days and nights, Charlotte, whom to avoid confusion we\r\nshall continue to call the Chevalier de Moranges, hovered between life\r\nand death. Her youth and the strength of her constitution enabled her at\r\nlast to overcome the fever, in spite of the want of skill of the surgeon\r\nPerregaud.\r\n\r\nAlthough de Jars was the only person who visited the chevalier, he was\r\nnot the only one who was anxious about the patient’s health. Maitre\r\nQuennebert, or men engaged by him to watch, for he did not want to\r\nattract attention, were always prowling about the neighbourhood, so that\r\nhe was kept well informed of everything that went on: The instructions\r\nhe gave to these agents were, that if a funeral should leave the house,\r\nthey were to find out the name of the deceased, and then to let him know\r\nwithout delay. But all these precautions seemed quite useless: he always\r\nreceived the same answer to all his questions, \"We know nothing.\" So at\r\nlast he determined to address himself directly to the man who could give\r\nhim information on which he could rely.\r\n\r\nOne night the commander left the surgeon’s feeling more cheerful than\r\nusual, for the chevalier had passed a good day, and there was every hope\r\nthat he was on the road to complete recovery. Hardly had de Jars gone\r\ntwenty paces when someone laid a hand on his shoulder. He turned and saw\r\na man whom, in the darkness, he did not recognise.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me for detaining you, Commander de Jars,\" said Quennebert, \"but\r\nI have a word to say to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ali! so it’s you, sir,\" replied the commander. \"Are you going at last\r\nto give me the opportunity I was so anxious for?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don’t understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are on more equal terms this time; to-day you don’t catch me\r\nunprepared, almost without weapons, and if you are a man of honour you\r\nwill measure swords with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fight a duel with you! why, may I ask? You have never insulted me.\"\r\n\r\n\"A truce to pleasantry, sir; don’t make me regret that I have shown\r\nmyself more generous than you. I might have killed you just now had I\r\nwished. I could have put my pistol to your breast and fired, or said to\r\nyou, ’Surrender at discretion!’ as you so lately said to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what use would that have been?\"\r\n\r\n\"It would have made a secret safe that you ought never to have known.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would have been the most unfortunate thing for you that could have\r\nhappened, for if you had killed me the paper would have spoken. So! you\r\nthink that if you were to assassinate me you would only have to stoop\r\nover my dead body and search my pockets, and, having found the\r\nincriminating document, destroy it. You seem to have formed no very high\r\nopinion of my intelligence and common sense. You of the upper classes\r\ndon’t need these qualities, the law is on, your side. But when a humble\r\nindividual like myself, a mere nobody, undertakes to investigate a piece\r\nof business about which those in authority are not anxious to be\r\nenlightened, precautions are necessary. It’s not enough for him to have\r\nright on his side, he must, in order to secure his own safety, make good\r\nuse of his skill, courage, and knowledge. I have no desire to humiliate\r\nyou a second time, so I will say no more. The paper is in the hands of\r\nmy notary, and if a single day passes without his seeing me he has\r\norders to break the seal and make the contents public. So you see chance\r\nis still on my side. But now that you are warned there is no need for me\r\nto bluster. I am quite prepared to acknowledge your superior rank, and\r\nif you insist upon it, to speak to you uncovered.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you desire to know, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"How is the Chevalier de Moranges getting on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very badly, very badly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take care, commander; don’t deceive me. One is so easily tempted to\r\nbelieve what one hopes, and I hope so strongly that I dare not believe\r\nwhat you say. I saw you coming out of the house, not at all with the air\r\nof a man who had just heard bad news, (quite the contrary) you looked at\r\nthe sky, and rubbed your hands, and walked with a light, quick step,\r\nthat did not speak of grief.\"\r\n\r\n\"You’re a sharp observer, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have already explained to you, sir, that when one of us belonging to\r\na class hardly better than serfs succeeds by chance or force of\r\ncharacter in getting out of the narrow bounds in which he was born, he\r\nmust keep both eyes and ears open. If I had doubted your word as you\r\nhave doubted mine on the merest suspicion, you would have said to your\r\nservants, ’Chastise this rascal.’ But I am obliged to prove to you that\r\nyou did not tell me the truth. Now I am sure that the chevalier is out\r\nof danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you were so well informed why did you ask me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I only knew it by your asserting the contrary.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" cried de Jars, who was growing restive under this\r\ncold, satirical politeness.\r\n\r\n\"Do me justice, commander. The bit chafes, but yet you must acknowledge\r\nthat I have a light hand. For a full week you have been in my power.\r\nHave I disturbed your quiet? Have I betrayed your secret? You know I\r\nhave not. And I shall continue to act in the same manner. I hope with\r\nall my heart, however great would be your grief; that the chevalier may\r\ndie of his wound. I have not the same reasons for loving him that you\r\nhave, so much you can readily understand, even if I do not explain the\r\ncause of my interest in his fate. But in such a matter hopes count for\r\nnothing; they cannot make his temperature either rise or fall. I have\r\ntold you I have no wish to force the chevalier to resume his real name.\r\nI may make use of the document and I may not, but if I am obliged to use\r\nit I shall give you warning. Will you, in return, swear to me upon your\r\nhonour that you will keep me informed as to the fate of the chevalier,\r\nwhether you remain in Paris or whether you leave? But let this agreement\r\nbe a secret between us, and do not mention it to the so-called\r\nMoranges.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have your oath, monsieur, that you will give me notice before you use\r\nthe document I have given you against me, have I? But what guarantee\r\nhave I that you will keep your word?\"\r\n\r\n\"My course of action till to-day, and the fact that I have pledged you\r\nmy word of my own free will.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see, you hope not to have long to wait for the end.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope not; but meantime a premature disclosure would do me as much\r\nharm as you. I have not the slightest rancour against you, commander;\r\nyou have robbed me of no treasure; I have therefore no compensation to\r\ndemand. What you place such value on would be only a burden to me, as it\r\nwill be to you later on. All I want is, to know as soon as it is no\r\nlonger in your possession, whether it has been removed by the will of\r\nGod or by your own, I am right in thinking that to-day there is some\r\nhope of the chevalier’s recovery, am I not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you give me your promise that if ever he leave this house safe and\r\nsound you will let me know?\"\r\n\r\n\"I give you my promise.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if the result should be different, you will also send me word?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. But to whom shall I address my message?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should have thought that since our first meeting you would have found\r\nout all about me, and that to tell you my name would be superfluous. But\r\nI have no reason to hide it: Maitre Quennebert, notary, Saint-Denis. I\r\nwill not detain you any longer now, commander; excuse a simple citizen\r\nfor dictating conditions to a noble such as you. For once chance has\r\nbeen on my side although a score of times it has gone against me.\"\r\n\r\nDe Jars made no reply except a nod, and walked away quickly, muttering\r\nwords of suppressed anger between his teeth at all the—humiliations to\r\nwhich he had been obliged to submit so meekly.\r\n\r\n\"He’s as insolent as a varlet who has no fear of a larruping before his\r\neyes: how the rapscallion gloried in taking advantage of his position!\r\nTaking-off his hat while putting his foot on my neck! If ever I can be\r\neven with you, my worthy scrivener, you’ll pass a very bad quarter of an\r\nhour, I can tell you.\"\r\n\r\nEveryone has his own idea of what constitutes perfect honour. De Jars,\r\nfor instance, would have allowed himself to be cut up into little pieces\r\nrather than have broken the promise he had given Quennebert a week ago,\r\nbecause it was given in exchange for his life, and the slightest\r\npaltering with his word under those circumstances would have been\r\ndastardly. But the engagement into which he had just entered had in his\r\neyes no such moral sanction; he had not been forced into it by threats,\r\nhe had escaped by its means no serious danger, and therefore in regard\r\nto it his conscience was much more accommodating. What he should best\r\nhave liked to do, would have been to have sought out the notary and\r\nprovoked him by insults to send him a challenge.\r\n\r\nThat a clown such as that could have any chance of leaving the ground\r\nalive never entered his head. But willingly as he would have encompassed\r\nhis death in this manner, the knowledge that his secret would not die\r\nwith Quennebert restrained him, for when everything came out he felt\r\nthat the notary’s death would be regarded as an aggravation of his\r\noriginal offence, and in spite of his rank he was not at all certain\r\nthat if he were put on his trial even now he would escape scot free,\r\nmuch less if a new offence were added to the indictment. So, however\r\nmuch he might chafe against the bit, he felt he must submit to the\r\nbridle.\r\n\r\n\"By God!\" said he, \"I know what the clodhopper is after; and even if I\r\nmust suffer in consequence, I shall take good care that he cannot shake\r\noff his bonds. Wait a bit! I can play the detective too, and be down on\r\nhim without letting him see the hand that deals the blows. It’ll be a\r\nwonder if I can’t find a naked sword to suspend above his head.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, while thus brooding over projects of vengeance, Commander de\r\nJars kept his word, and about a month after the interview above related\r\nhe sent word to Quennebert that the Chevalier de Moranges had left\r\nPerregaud’s completely recovered from his wound. But the nearly fatal\r\nresult of the chevalier’s last prank seemed to have subdued his\r\nadventurous spirit; he was no longer seen in public, and was soon\r\nforgotten by all his acquaintances with the exception of Mademoiselle de\r\nGuerchi. She faithfully treasured up the memory of his words of passion,\r\nhis looks of love, the warmth of his caresses, although at first she\r\nstruggled hard to chase his image from her heart. But as the Due de\r\nVitry assured her that he had killed him on the spot, she considered it\r\nno breach of faith to think lovingly of the dead, and while she took the\r\ngoods so bounteously provided by her living lover, her gentlest\r\nthoughts, her most enduring regrets, were given to one whom she never\r\nhoped to see again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the reader’s permission, we must now jump over an interval of\r\nrather more than a year, and bring upon the stage a person who, though\r\nonly of secondary importance, can no longer be left behind the scenes.\r\n\r\nWe have already said that the loves of Quennebert and Madame Rapally\r\nwere regarded with a jealous eye by a distant cousin of the lady’s late\r\nhusband. The love of this rejected suitor, whose name was Trumeau, was\r\nno more sincere than the notary’s, nor were his motives more honourable.\r\nAlthough his personal appearance was not such as to lead him to expect\r\nthat his path would be strewn with conquests, he considered that his\r\ncharms at least equalled those of his defunct relative; and it may be\r\nsaid that in thus estimating them he did not lay himself—open to the\r\ncharge of overweening vanity. But however persistently he preened him\r\nself before the widow, she vouchsafed him not one glance. Her heart was\r\nfilled with the love of his rival, and it is no easy thing to tear a\r\nrooted passion out of a widow’s heart when that widow’s age is\r\nforty-six, and she is silly enough to believe that the admiration she\r\nfeels is equalled by the admiration she inspires, as the unfortunate\r\nTrumeau found to his cost. All his carefully prepared declarations of\r\nlove, all his skilful insinuations against Quennebert, brought him\r\nnothing but scornful rebuffs. But Trumeau was nothing if not\r\npersevering, and he could not habituate himself to the idea of seeing\r\nthe widow’s fortune pass into other hands than his own, so that every\r\nbaffled move only increased his determination to spoil his competitor’s\r\ngame. He was always on the watch for a chance to carry tales to the\r\nwidow, and so absorbed did he become in this fruitless pursuit, that he\r\ngrew yellower and more dried up from day to day, and to his jaundiced\r\neye the man who was at first simply his rival became his mortal enemy\r\nand the object of his implacable hate, so that at length merely to get\r\nthe better of him, to outwit him, would, after so long-continued and\r\nobstinate a struggle and so many defeats, have seemed to him too mild a\r\nvengeance, too incomplete a victory.\r\n\r\nQuennebert was well aware of the zeal with which the indefatigable\r\nTrumeau sought to injure him. But he regarded the manoeuvres of his\r\nrival with supreme unconcern, for he knew that he could at any time\r\nsweep away the network of cunning machinations, underhand insinuations,\r\nand malicious hints, which was spread around him, by allowing the widow\r\nto confer on him the advantages she was so anxious to bestow. The goal,\r\nhe knew, was within his reach, but the problem he had to solve was how\r\nto linger on the way thither, how to defer the triumphal moment, how to\r\nkeep hope alive in the fair one’s breast and yet delay its fruition. His\r\naffairs were in a bad way. Day by day full possession of the fortune\r\nthus dangled before his eyes, and fragments of which came to him\r\noccasionally by way of loan, was becoming more and more indispensable,\r\nand tantalising though it was, yet he dared not put out his hand to\r\nseize it. His creditors dunned him relentlessly: one final reprieve had\r\nbeen granted him, but that at an end, if he could not meet their\r\ndemands, it was all up with his career and reputation.\r\n\r\nOne morning in the beginning of February 1660, Trumeau called to see his\r\ncousin. He had not been there for nearly a month, and Quennebert and the\r\nwidow had begun to think that, hopeless of success, he had retired from\r\nthe contest. But, far from that, his hatred had grown more intense than\r\never, and having come upon the traces of an event in the past life of\r\nhis rival which if proved would be the ruin of that rival’s hopes, he\r\nset himself to gather evidence. He now made his appearance with beaming\r\nlooks, which expressed a joy too great for words. He held in one hand a\r\nsmall scroll tied with a ribbon. He found the widow alone, sitting in a\r\nlarge easy-chair before the fire. She was reading for the twentieth time\r\na letter which Quenriebert had written her the evening before. To judge\r\nby the happy and contented expression of the widow’s face, it must have\r\nbeen couched in glowing terms. Trumeau guessed at once from whom the\r\nmissive came, but the sight of it, instead of irritating him, called\r\nforth a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! so it’s you, cousin?\" said the widow, folding the precious paper\r\nand slipping it into the bosom of her dress. \"How do you do? It’s a long\r\ntime since I saw you, more than a fortnight, I think. Have you been\r\nill?\"\r\n\r\n\"So you remarked my absence! That is very flattering, my dear cousin;\r\nyou do not often spoil me by such attentions. No, I have not been ill,\r\nthank God, but I thought it better not to intrude upon you so often. A\r\nfriendly call now and then such as to-day’s is what you like, is it not?\r\nBy the way, tell me about your handsome suitor, Maitre Quennebert; how\r\nis he getting along?\"\r\n\r\n\"You look very knowing, Trumeau: have you heard of anything happening to\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, and I should be exceedingly sorry to hear that anything unpleasant\r\nhad happened to him.\"\r\n\r\nNow you are not saying what you think, you know you can’t bear him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, to speak the truth, I have no great reason to like him. If it\r\nwere not for him, I should perhaps have been happy to-day; my love might\r\nhave moved your heart. However, I have become resigned to my loss, and\r\nsince your choice has fallen on him,\"—and here he sighed,—\"well, all I\r\ncan say is, I hope you may never regret it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Many thanks for your goodwill, cousin; I am delighted to find you in\r\nsuch a benevolent mood. You must not be vexed because I could not give\r\nyou the kind of love you wanted; the heart, you know, is not amenable to\r\nreason.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is only one thing I should like to ask.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mention it for your good more than for my own. If you want to be\r\nhappy, don’t let this handsome quill-driver get you entirely into his\r\nhands. You are saying to yourself that because of my ill-success with\r\nyou I am trying to injure him; but what if I could prove that he does\r\nnot love you as much as he pretends—?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, come, control your naughty tongue! Are you going to begin\r\nbackbiting again? You are playing a mean part, Trumeau. I have never\r\nhinted to Maitre Quennebert all the nasty little ways in which you have\r\ntried to put a spoke in his wheel, for if he knew he would ask you to\r\nprove your words, and then you would look very foolish.\".\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, I swear to you. On the contrary, if I were to tell all I\r\nknow in his presence, it is not I who would be disconcerted. Oh! I am\r\nweary of meeting with nothing from you but snubs, scorn, and abuse. You\r\nthink me a slanderer when I say, ’This gallant wooer of widows does not\r\nlove you for yourself but for your money-bags. He fools you by fine\r\npromises, but as to marrying you—never, never!’\"\r\n\r\n\"May I ask you to repeat that?\" broke in Madame Rapally\r\n\r\n\"Oh! I know what I am saying. You will never be Madame Quennebert.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really?\"\r\n\r\n\"Really.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jealousy has eaten away whatever brains you used to possess, Trumeau.\r\nSince I saw you last, cousin, important changes have taken place: I was\r\njust going to send you to-day an invitation to my wedding.\"\r\n\r\n\"To your wedding?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I am to be married to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow? To Quennebert?\" stammered Trumeau.\r\n\r\n\"To Quennebert,\" repeated the widow in a tone of triumph.\r\n\r\n\"It’s not possible!\" exclaimed Trumeau.\r\n\r\n\"It is so possible that you will see us united tomorrow. And for the\r\nfuture I must beg of you to regard Quennebert no longer as a rival but\r\nas my husband, whom to offend will be to offend me.\"\r\n\r\nThe tone in which these words were spoken no longer left room for doubt\r\nas to the truth of the news. Trumeau looked down for a few moments, as\r\nif reflecting deeply before definitely making up his mind. He twisted\r\nthe little roll of papers between his fingers, and seemed to be in doubt\r\nwhether to open it and give it to Madame Rapally to read or not. In the\r\nend, however, he put it in his pocket, rose, and approaching his cousin,\r\nsaid—\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, this news completely changes my opinion. From the\r\nmoment Maitre Quennebert becomes your husband I shall not have a word to\r\nsay against him. My suspicions were unjust, I confess it frankly, and I\r\nhope that in consideration of the motives which prompted me you will\r\nforget the warmth of my attacks. I shall make no protestations, but\r\nshall let the future show how sincere is my devotion to your interests.\"\r\n\r\nMadame Rapally was too happy, too certain of being loved, not to pardon\r\neasily. With the self-complacency and factitious generosity of a woman\r\nwho feels herself the object of two violent passions, she was so good as\r\nto feel pity for the lover who was left out in the cold, and offered him\r\nher hand. Trumeau kissed it with every outward mark of respect, while\r\nhis lips curled unseen in a smile of mockery. The cousins parted,\r\napparently the best of friends, and on the understanding that Trumeau\r\nwould be present at the nuptial benediction, which was to be given in a\r\nchurch beyond the town hall, near the house in which the newly-married\r\ncouple were to live; the house on the Pont Saint-Michel having lately\r\nbeen sold to great advantage.\r\n\r\n\"On my word,\" said Trumeau, as he went off, \"it would have been a great\r\nmistake to have spoken. I have got that wretch of a Quennebert into my\r\nclutches at last; and there is nobody but himself to blame. He is taking\r\nthe plunge of his own free will, there is no need for me to shove him\r\noff the precipice.\"\r\n\r\nThe ceremony took place next day. Quennebert conducted his interesting\r\nbride to the altar, she hung with ornaments like the shrine of a saint,\r\nand, beaming all over with smiles, looked so ridiculous that the\r\nhandsome bridegroom reddened to the roots of his hair with shame. Just\r\nas they entered the church, a coffin, on which lay a sword, and which\r\nwas followed by a single mourner, who from his manners and dress seemed\r\nto belong to the class of nobles, was carried in by the same door. The\r\nwedding guests drew back to let the funeral pass on, the living giving\r\nprecedence to the dead. The solitary mourner glanced by chance at\r\nQuennebert, and started as if the sight of him was painful.\r\n\r\n\"What an unlucky meeting!\" murmured Madame Rapally; \"it is sure to be a\r\nbad omen.\"\r\n\r\n\"It’s sure to be the exact opposite,\" said Quennebert smiling.\r\n\r\nThe two ceremonies took place simultaneously in two adjoining chapels;\r\nthe funeral dirges which fell on the widow’s ear full of sinister\r\nprediction seemed to have quite another meaning for Quennebert, for his\r\nfeatures lost their look of care, his wrinkles smoothed themselves out,\r\ntill the guests, among whom was Trumeau, who did not suspect the secret\r\nof his relief from suspense, began to believe, despite their surprise,\r\nthat he was really rejoiced at obtaining legal possession of the\r\ncharming Madame Rapally.\r\n\r\nAs for her, she fleeted the daylight hours by anticipating the joyful\r\nmoment when she would have her husband all to herself. When night came,\r\nhardly had she entered the nuptial chamber than she uttered a piercing\r\nshriek. She had just found and read a paper left on the bed by Trumeau,\r\nwho before leaving had contrived to glide into the room unseen. Its\r\ncontents were of terrible import, so terrible that the new-made wife\r\nfell unconscious to the ground.\r\n\r\nQuennebert, who, without a smile, was absorbed in reflections on the\r\nhappiness at last within his grasp, heard the noise from the next room,\r\nand rushing in, picked up his wife. Catching sight of the paper, he also\r\nuttered a cry of anger and astonishment, but in whatever circumstances\r\nhe found himself he was never long uncertain how to act. Placing Madame\r\nQuennebert, still unconscious, on the bed, he called her maid, and,\r\nhaving impressed on her that she was to take every care of her mistress,\r\nand above all to tell her from him as soon as she came to herself that\r\nthere was no cause for alarm, he left the house at once. An hour later,\r\nin spite of the efforts of the servants, he forced his way into the\r\npresence of Commander de Jars. Holding out the fateful document to him,\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n\"Speak openly, commander! Is it you who in revenge for your long\r\nconstraint have done this? I can hardly think so, for after what has\r\nhappened you know that I have nothing to fear any longer. Still, knowing\r\nmy secret and unable to do it in any other way, have you perchance taken\r\nyour revenge by an attempt to destroy my future happiness by sowing\r\ndissension and disunion between me and my wife?\"\r\n\r\nThe commander solemnly assured him that he had had no hand in bringing\r\nabout the discovery.\r\n\r\n’Then if it’s not you, it must be a worthless being called Trumeau, who,\r\nwith the unerring instinct of jealousy, has run the truth to earth. But\r\nhe knows only half: I have never been either so much in love or so\r\nstupid as to allow myself to be trapped. I have given you my promise to\r\nbe discreet and not to misuse my power, and as long as was compatible\r\nwith my own safety I have kept my word. But now you must see that I am\r\nbound to defend myself, and to do that I shall be obliged to summon you\r\nas a witness. So leave Paris tonight and seek out some safe retreat\r\nwhere no one can find you, for to-morrow I shall speak. Of course if I\r\nam quit for a woman’s tears, if no more difficult task lies before me\r\nthan to soothe a weeping wife, you can return immediately; but if, as is\r\ntoo probable, the blow has been struck by the hand of a rival furious at\r\nhaving been defeated, the matter will not so easily be cut short; the\r\narm of the law will be invoked, and then I must get my head out of the\r\nnoose which some fingers I know of are itching to draw tight.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are quite right, sir,\" answered the commander; \"I fear that my\r\ninfluence at court is not strong enough to enable me to brave the matter\r\nout. Well, my success has cost me dear, but it has cured me for ever of\r\nseeking out similar adventures. My preparations will not take long, and\r\nto-morrow’s dawn will find me far from Paris.\"\r\n\r\nQuennebert bowed and withdrew, returning home to console his Ariadne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accusation hanging over the head of Maitre Quennebert was a very\r\nserious one, threatening his life, if proved. But he was not uneasy; he\r\nknew himself in possession of facts which would enable him to refute it\r\ntriumphantly.\r\n\r\nThe platonic love of Angelique de Guerchi for the handsome Chevalier de\r\nMoranges had resulted, as we have seen, in no practical wrong to the Duc\r\nde Vitry. After her reconciliation with her lover, brought about by the\r\neminently satisfactory explanations she was able to give of her conduct,\r\nwhich we have already laid before our readers, she did not consider it\r\nadvisable to shut her heart to his pleadings much longer, and the\r\nconsequence was that at the end of a year she found herself in a\r\ncondition which it was necessary to conceal from everyone. To Angelique\r\nherself, it is true, the position was not new, and she felt neither\r\ngrief nor shame, regarding the coming event as a means of making her\r\nfuture more secure by forging a new link in the chain which bound the\r\nduke to her. But he, sure that but for himself Angelique would never\r\nhave strayed from virtue’s path, could not endure the thought of her\r\nlosing her reputation and becoming an object for scandal to point her\r\nfinger at; so that Angelique, who could not well seem less careful of\r\nher good name than he, was obliged to turn his song of woe into a duet,\r\nand consent to certain measures being taken.\r\n\r\nOne evening, therefore, shortly before Maitre Quennebert’s marriage, the\r\nfair lady set out, ostensibly on a journey which was to last a fortnight\r\nor three weeks. In reality she only made a circle in a post-chaise round\r\nParis, which she re-entered at one of the barriers, where the duke\r\nawaited her with a sedan-chair. In this she was carried to the very\r\nhouse to which de Jars had brought his pretended nephew after the duel.\r\nAngelique, who had to pay dearly for her errors, remained there only\r\ntwenty-four hours, and then left in her coffin, which was hidden in a\r\ncellar under the palace of the Prince de Conde, the body being covered\r\nwith quicklime. Two days after this dreadful death, Commander de Jars\r\npresented himself at the fatal house, and engaged a room in which he\r\ninstalled the chevalier.\r\n\r\nThis house, which we are about to ask the reader to enter with us, stood\r\nat the corner of the rue de la Tixeranderie and the rue Deux-Portes.\r\nThere was nothing in the exterior of it to distinguish it from any\r\nother, unless perhaps two brass plates, one of which bore the words\r\nMARIE LEROUX-CONSTANTIN, WIDOW, CERTIFIED MIDWIFE, and the other CLAUDE\r\nPERREGAUD, SURGEON. These plates were affixed to the blank wall in the\r\nrue de la Tixeranderie, the windows of the rooms on that side looking\r\ninto the courtyard. The house door, which opened directly on the first\r\nsteps of a narrow winding stair, was on the other side, just beyond the\r\nlow arcade under whose vaulted roof access was gained to that end of the\r\nrue des Deux-Portes. This house, though dirty, mean, and out of repair,\r\nreceived many wealthy visitors, whose brilliant equipages waited for\r\nthem in the neighbouring streets. Often in the night great ladies\r\ncrossed its threshold under assumed names and remained there for several\r\ndays, during which La Constantin and Claude Perregaud, by an infamous\r\nuse of their professional knowledge, restored their clients to an\r\noutward appearance of honour, and enabled them to maintain their\r\nreputation for virtue. The first and second floors contained a dozen\r\nrooms in which these abominable mysteries were practised. The large\r\napartment, which served as waiting and consultation room, was oddly\r\nfurnished, being crowded with objects of strange and unfamiliar form. It\r\nresembled at once the operating-room of a surgeon, the laboratory of a\r\nchemist and alchemist, and the den of a sorcerer. There, mixed up\r\ntogether in the greatest confusion, lay instruments of all sorts,\r\ncaldrons and retorts, as well as books containing the most absurd\r\nravings of the human mind. There were the twenty folio volumes of\r\nAlbertus Magnus; the works of his disciple, Thomas de Cantopre, of\r\nAlchindus, of Averroes, of Avicenna, of Alchabitius, of David de\r\nPlaine-Campy, called L’Edelphe, surgeon to Louis XIII and author of the\r\ncelebrated book The Morbific Hydra Exterminated by the Chemical\r\nHercules. Beside a bronze head, such as the monk Roger Bacon possessed,\r\nwhich answered all the questions that were addressed to it and foretold\r\nthe future by means of a magic mirror and the combination of the rules\r\nof perspective, lay an eggshell, the same which had been used by Caret,\r\nas d’Aubigne tells us, when making men out of germs, mandrakes, and\r\ncrimson silk, over a slow fire. In the presses, which had sliding-doors\r\nfastening with secret springs, stood Jars filled with noxious drugs, the\r\npower of which was but too efficacious; in prominent positions, facing\r\neach other, hung two portraits, one representing Hierophilos, a Greek\r\nphysician, and the other Agnodice his pupil, the first Athenian midwife.\r\n\r\nFor several years already La Constantin and Claude Perregaud had carried\r\non their criminal practices without interference. A number of persons\r\nwere of course in the secret, but their interests kept them silent, and\r\nthe two accomplices had at last persuaded themselves that they were\r\nperfectly safe. One evening, however, Perregaud came home, his face\r\ndistorted by terror and trembling in every limb. He had been warned\r\nwhile out that the suspicions of the authorities had been aroused in\r\nregard to him and La Constantin. It seemed that some little time ago,\r\nthe Vicars-General had sent a deputation to the president of the chief\r\ncourt of justice, having heard from their priests that in one year alone\r\nsix hundred women had avowed in the confessional that they had taken\r\ndrugs to prevent their having children. This had been sufficient to\r\narouse the vigilance of the police, who had set a watch on Perregaud’s\r\nhouse, with the result that that very night a raid was to be made on it.\r\nThe two criminals took hasty counsel together, but, as usual under such\r\ncircumstances, arrived at no practical conclusions. It was only when the\r\ndanger was upon them that they recovered their presence of mind. In the\r\ndead of night loud knocking at the street door was heard, followed by\r\nthe command to open in the name of the king.\r\n\r\n\"We can yet save ourselves!\" exclaimed surgeon, with a sudden flash of\r\ninspiration.\r\n\r\nRushing into the room where the pretended chevalier was lying, he called\r\nout—\r\n\r\n\"The police are coming up! If they discover your sex you are lost, and\r\nso am I. Do as I tell you.\"\r\n\r\nAt a sign from him, La Constantin went down and opened the door. While\r\nthe rooms on the first floor were being searched, Perregaud made with a\r\nlancet a superficial incision in the chevalier’s right arm, which gave\r\nvery little pain, and bore a close resemblance to a sword-cut. Surgery\r\nand medicine were at that time so inextricably involved, required such\r\napparatus, and bristled with such scientific absurdities, that no\r\nastonishment was excited by the extraordinary collection of instruments\r\nwhich loaded the tables and covered the floors below: even the titles of\r\ncertain treatises which there had been no time to destroy, awoke no\r\nsuspicion.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the surgeon and his accomplice, they had only one\r\npatient—the chevalier—in their house when the descent was made. When the\r\nchevalier’s room was reached, the first thing which the officers of the\r\nlaw remarked were the hat, spurred boots, and sword of the patient.\r\nClaude Perregaud hardly looked up as the room was invaded; he only made\r\na sign to those—who came in to be quiet, and went on dressing the wound.\r\nCompletely taken in, the officer in command merely asked the name of the\r\npatient and the cause of the wound. La Constantin replied that it’ was\r\nthe young Chevalier de Moranges, nephew of Commander de Jars, who had\r\nhad an affair of honour that same night, and being sightly wounded had\r\nbeen brought thither by his uncle hardly an hour before. These questions\r\nand the apparently trustworthy replies elicited by them being duly taken\r\ndown, the uninvited visitors retired, having discovered nothing to\r\njustify their visit.\r\n\r\nAll might have been well had there been nothing the matter but the wound\r\non the chevalier’s sword-arm. But at the moment when Perregaud gave it\r\nto him the poisonous nostrums employed by La Constantin were already\r\nworking in his blood. Violent fever ensued, and in three days the\r\nchevalier was dead. It was his funeral which had met Quennebert’s\r\nwedding party at the church door.\r\n\r\nEverything turned out as Quennebert had anticipated. Madame Quennebert,\r\nfurious at the deceit which had been practised on her, refused to listen\r\nto her husband’s justification, and Trumeau, not letting the grass grow\r\nunder his feet, hastened the next day to launch an accusation of bigamy\r\nagainst the notary; for the paper which had been found in the nuptial\r\ncamber was nothing less than an attested copy of a contract of marriage\r\nconcluded between Quennebert and Josephine-Charlotte Boullenois. It was\r\nby the merest chance that Trumeau had come on the record of the\r\nmarriage, and he now challenged his rival to produce a certificate of\r\nthe death of his first wife. Charlotte Boullenois, after two years of\r\nmarriage, had demanded a deed of separation, which demand Quennebert had\r\nopposed. While the case was going on she had retired to the convent of\r\nLa Raquette, where her intrigue with de Jars began. The commander easily\r\ninduced her to let herself be carried off by force. He then concealed\r\nhis conquest by causing her to adopt male attire, a mode of dress which\r\naccorded marvellously well with her peculiar tastes and rather masculine\r\nframe. At first Quennebert had instituted an active but fruitless search\r\nfor his missing wife, but soon became habituated to his state of\r\nenforced single blessedness, enjoying to the full the liberty it brought\r\nwith it. But his business had thereby suffered, and once having made the\r\nacquaintance of Madame Rapally, he cultivated it assiduously, knowing\r\nher fortune would be sufficient to set him straight again with the\r\nworld, though he was obliged to exercise the utmost caution and reserve\r\nin has intercourse with her, as she on her side displayed none of these\r\nqualities. At last, however, matters came to such a pass that he must\r\neither go to prison or run the risk of a second marriage. So he\r\nreluctantly named a day for the ceremony, resolving to leave Paris with\r\nMadame Rapally as soon as he had settled with his creditors.\r\n\r\nIn the short interval which ensued, and while Trumeau was hugging the\r\nknowledge of the discovery he had made, a stroke of luck had brought the\r\npretended chevalier to La Constantin. As Quennebert had kept an eye on\r\nde Jars and was acquainted with all his movements, he was aware of\r\neverything that happened at Perregaud’s, and as Charlotte’s death\r\npreceded his second marriage by one day, he knew that no serious\r\nconsequences would ensue from the legal proceedings taken against him.\r\nHe produced the declarations made by Mademoiselle de Guerchi and the\r\ncommander, and had the body exhumed. Extraordinary and improbable as his\r\ndefence appeared at first to be, the exhumation proved the truth of his\r\nassertions. These revelations, however, drew the eye of justice again on\r\nPerregaud and his partner in crime, and this time their guilt was\r\nbrought home to them. They were condemned by parliamentary decree to \"be\r\nhanged by the neck till they were dead, on a gallows erected for that\r\npurpose at the cross roads of the Croix-du-Trahoir; their bodies to\r\nremain there for twenty-four hours, then to be cut down and brought back\r\nto Paris, where they were to be exposed on a gibbet,\" etc., etc.\r\n\r\nIt was proved that they had amassed immense fortunes in the exercise of\r\ntheir infamous calling. The entries in the books seized at their house,\r\nthough sparse, would have led, if made public, to scandals, involving\r\nmany in high places; it was therefore judged best to limit the\r\naccusation to the two deaths by blood-poisoning of Angelique de Querchi\r\nand Charlotte Boullenois.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*JOAN OF NAPLES—1343-1382*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the night of the 15th of January 1343, while the inhabitants of\r\nNaples lay wrapped in peaceful slumber, they were suddenly awakened by\r\nthe bells of the three hundred churches that this thrice blessed capital\r\ncontains. In the midst of the disturbance caused by so rude a call the\r\nfirst thought in the mind of all was that the town was on fire, or that\r\nthe army of some enemy had mysteriously landed under cover of night and\r\ncould put the citizens to the edge of the sword. But the doleful,\r\nintermittent sounds of all these fills, which disturbed the silence at\r\nregular and distant intervals, were an invitation to the faithful to\r\npray for a passing soul, and it was soon evident that no disaster\r\nthreatened the town, but that the king alone was in danger.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it had been plain for several days past that the greatest\r\nuneasiness prevailed in Castel Nuovo; the officers of the crown were\r\nassembled regularly twice a day, and persons of importance, whose right\r\nit was to make their way into the king’s apartments, came out evidently\r\nbowed down with grief. But although the king’s death was regarded as a\r\nmisfortune that nothing could avert, yet the whole town, on learning for\r\ncertain of the approach of his last hour, was affected with a sincere\r\ngrief, easily understood when one learns that the man about to die,\r\nafter a reign of thirty-three years, eight months, and a few days, was\r\nRobert of Anjou, the most wise, just, and glorious king who had ever sat\r\non the throne of Sicily. And so he carried with him to the tomb the\r\neulogies and regrets of all his subjects.\r\n\r\nSoldiers would speak with enthusiasm of the long wars he had waged with\r\nFrederic and Peter of Aragon, against Henry VII and Louis of Bavaria;\r\nand felt their hearts beat high, remembering the glories of campaigns in\r\nLombardy and Tuscany; priests would gratefully extol his constant\r\ndefence of the papacy against Ghibelline attacks, and the founding of\r\nconvents, hospitals, and churches throughout his kingdom; in the world\r\nof letters he was regarded as the most learned king in Christendom;\r\nPetrarch, indeed, would receive the poet’s crown from no other hand, and\r\nhad spent three consecutive days answering all the questions that Robert\r\nhad deigned to ask him on every topic of human knowledge. The men of\r\nlaw, astonished by the wisdom of those laws which now enriched the\r\nNeapolitan code, had dubbed him the Solomon of their day; the nobles\r\napplauded him for protecting their ancient privileges, and the people\r\nwere eloquent of his clemency, piety, and mildness. In a word, priests\r\nand soldiers, philosophers and poets, nobles and peasants, trembled when\r\nthey thought that the government was to fall into the hands of a\r\nforeigner and of a young girl, recalling those words of Robert, who, as\r\nhe followed in the funeral train of Charles, his only son, turned as he\r\nreached the threshold of the church and sobbingly exclaimed to his\r\nbarons about him, \"This day the crown has fallen from my head: alas for\r\nme! alas for you!\"\r\n\r\nNow that the bells were ringing for the dying moments of the good king,\r\nevery mind was full of these prophetic words: women prayed fervently to\r\nGod; men from all parts of the town bent their steps towards the royal\r\npalace to get the earliest and most authentic news, and after waiting\r\nsome moments, passed in exchanging sad reflections, were obliged to\r\nreturn as they had come, since nothing that went on in the privacy of\r\nthe family found its way outside—the castle was plunged in complete\r\ndarkness, the drawbridge was raised as usual, and the guards were at\r\ntheir post.\r\n\r\nYet if our readers care to be present at the death of the nephew of\r\nSaint Louis and the grandson of Charles of Anjou, we may conduct them\r\ninto the chamber of the dying man. An alabaster lamp suspended from the\r\nceiling serves to light the vast and sombre room, with walls draped in\r\nblack velvet sewn with golden fleur-de-lys. Near the wall which faces\r\nthe two entrance doors that at this moment are both shut close, there\r\nstands beneath a brocaded canopy an ebony bed, supported on four twisted\r\ncolumns carved with symbolic figures. The king, after a struggle with a\r\nviolent paroxysm, has fallen swooning in the arms of his confessor and\r\nhis doctor, who each hold one of his dying hands, feeling his pulse\r\nanxiously and exchanging looks of intelligence. At the foot of the bed\r\nstands a woman about fifty years of age, her hands clasped, her eyes\r\nraised to heaven, in an attitude of resigned grief: this woman is the\r\nqueen, No tears dim her eyes: her sunken cheek has that waxen yellow\r\ntinge that one sees on the bodies of saints preserved by miracle. In her\r\nlook is that mingling of calm and suffering that points to a soul at\r\nonce tried by sorrow and imbued with religion. After the lapse of an\r\nhour, while no movement had disturbed the profound silence which reigned\r\nabout the bed of death, the king trembled slightly; opened his eyes, and\r\nendeavoured feebly to raise his head. Then thanking the physician and\r\npriest with a smile, who had both hastened to arrange his pillows, he\r\nbegged the queen to come near, and told her in a low voice that he would\r\nspeak with her a moment alone. The doctor and confessor retired, deeply\r\nbowing, and the king followed them with his eyes up to the moment when\r\none of the doors closed behind them. He passed his hand across his brow,\r\nas though seeking to collect his thoughts, and rallying all his forces\r\nfor the supreme effort, pronounced these words:\r\n\r\n\"What I must say to you, Sancha, has no concern with those two good\r\npersons who were here a moment ago: their task is ended. One has done\r\nall for my body that human science could teach him, and all that has\r\ncome of it is that my death is yet a little deferred; the other has now\r\nabsolved me of all my sins, and assured me of God’s forgiveness, yet\r\ncannot keep from me those dread apparitions which in this terrible hour\r\narise before me. Twice have you seen me battling with a superhuman\r\nhorror. My brow has been bathed in sweat, my limbs rigid, my cries have\r\nbeen stifled by a hand of iron. Has God permitted the Evil Spirit to\r\ntempt me? Is this remorse in phantom shape? These two conflicts I have\r\nsuffered have so subdued my strength that I can never endure a third.\r\nListen then, my Sancha, for I have instructions to give you on which\r\nperhaps the safety of my soul depends.\"\r\n\r\n\"My lord and my master,\" said the queen in the most gentle accents of\r\nsubmission, \"I am ready to listen to your orders; and should it be that\r\nGod, in the hidden designs of His providence, has willed to call you to\r\nHis glory while we are plunged in grief, your last wishes shall be\r\nfulfilled here on earth most scrupulously and exactly. But,\" she added,\r\nwith all the solicitude of a timid soul, \"pray suffer me to sprinkle\r\ndrops of holy water and banish the accursed one from this chamber, and\r\nlet me offer up some part of that service of prayer that you composed in\r\nhonour of your sainted brother to implore God’s protection in this hour\r\nwhen we can ill afford to lose it.\"\r\n\r\nThen opening a richly bound book, she read with fervent devotion certain\r\nverses of the office that Robert had written in a very pure Latin for\r\nhis brother Louis, Bishop of Toulouse, which was in use in the Church as\r\nlate as the time of the Council of Trent.\r\n\r\nSoothed by the charm of the prayers he had himself composed, the king\r\nwas near forgetting the object of the interview he had so solemnly and\r\neagerly demanded and letting himself lapse into a state of vague\r\nmelancholy, he murmured in a subdued voice, \"Yes, yes, you are right;\r\npray for me, for you too are a saint, and I am but a poor sinful man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say not so, my lord,\" interrupted Dona Sancha; \"you are the greatest,\r\nwisest, and most just king who has ever sat upon the throne of Naples.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the throne is usurped,\" replied Robert in a voice of gloom; \"you\r\nknow that the kingdom belonged to my elder brother, Charles Martel; and\r\nsince Charles was on the throne of Hungary, which he inherited from his\r\nmother, the kingdom of Naples devolved by right upon his eldest son,\r\nCarobert, and not on me, who am the third in rank of the family. And I\r\nhave suffered myself to be crowned in my nephew’s stead, though he was\r\nthe only lawful-king; I have put the younger branch in the place of the\r\nelder, and for thirty-three years I have stifled the reproaches of my\r\nconscience. True, I have won battles, made laws, founded churches; but a\r\nsingle word serves to give the lie to all the pompous titles showered\r\nupon me by the people’s admiration, and this one word rings out clearer\r\nin my ears than all the flattery of courtiers, all the songs of poets,\r\nall the orations of the crowd:—I am an usurper!\"\r\n\r\n\"Be not unjust towards yourself, my lord, and bear in mind that if you\r\ndid not abdicate in favour of the rightful heir, it was because you\r\nwished to save the people from the worst misfortunes. Moreover,\"\r\ncontinued the queen, with that air of profound conviction that an\r\nunanswerable argument inspires, \"you have remained king by the consent\r\nand authority of our Holy Father the sovereign pontiff, who disposes of\r\nthe throne as a fief belonging to the Church.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have long quieted my scruples thus,\" replied the dying man, \"and the\r\npope’s authority has kept me silent; but whatever security one may\r\npretend to feel in one’s lifetime, there yet comes a dreadful solemn\r\nhour when all illusions needs must vanish: this hour for me has come,\r\nand now I must appear before God, the one unfailing judge.\"\r\n\r\n\"If His justice cannot fail, is not His mercy infinite?\" pursued the\r\nqueen, with the glow of sacred inspiration. \"Even if there were good\r\nreason for the fear that has shaken your soul, what fault could not be\r\neffaced by a repentance so noble? Have you not repaired the wrong you\r\nmay have done your nephew Carobert, by bringing his younger son Andre to\r\nyour kingdom and marrying him to Joan, your poor Charles’s elder\r\ndaughter? Will not they inherit your crown?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" cried Robert, with a deep sigh, \"God is punishing me perhaps for\r\nthinking too late of this just reparation. O my good and noble Sandra,\r\nyou touch a chord which vibrates sadly in my heart, and you anticipate\r\nthe unhappy confidence I was about to make. I feel a gloomy\r\npresentiment—and in the hour of death presentiment is prophecy—that the\r\ntwo sons of my nephew, Louis, who has been King of Hungary since his\r\nfather died, and Andre, whom I desired to make King of Naples, will\r\nprove the scourge of my family. Ever since Andre set foot in our castle,\r\na strange fatality has pursued and overturned my projects. I had hoped\r\nthat if Andre and Joan were brought up together a tender intimacy would\r\narise between the two children; and that the beauty of our skies, our\r\ncivilisation, and the attractions of our court would end by softening\r\nwhatever rudeness there might be in the young Hungarian’s character; but\r\nin spite of my efforts all has tended to cause coldness, and even\r\naversion, between the bridal pair. Joan, scarcely fifteen, is far ahead\r\nof her age. Gifted with a brilliant and mobile mind, a noble and lofty\r\ncharacter, a lively and glowing fancy, now free and frolicsome as a\r\nchild, now grave and proud as a queen, trustful and simple as a young\r\ngirl, passionate and sensitive as a woman, she presents the most\r\nstriking contrast to Andre, who, after a stay of ten years at our court,\r\nis wilder, more gloomy, more intractable than ever. His cold, regular\r\nfeatures, impassive countenance, and indifference to every pleasure that\r\nhis wife appears to love, all this has raised between him and Joan a\r\nbarrier of indifference, even of antipathy. To the tenderest effusion\r\nhis reply is no more than a scornful smile or a frown, and he never\r\nseems happier than when on a pretext of the chase he can escape from the\r\ncourt. These, then, are the two, man and wife, on whose heads my crown\r\nshall rest, who in a short space will find themselves exposed to every\r\npassion whose dull growl is now heard below a deceptive calm, but which\r\nonly awaits the moment when I breathe my last, to burst forth upon\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"O my God, my God!\" the queen kept repeating in her grief: her arms fell\r\nby her side, like the arms of a statue weeping by a tomb.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Dona Sandra. I know that your heart has never clung to earthly\r\nvanities, and that you only wait till God has called me to Himself to\r\nwithdraw to the convent of Santa Maria delta Croce, founded by yourself\r\nin the hope that you might there end your days. Far be it from me to\r\ndissuade you from your sacred vocation, when I am myself descending into\r\nthe tomb and am conscious of the nothingness of all human greatness.\r\nOnly grant me one year of widowhood before you pass on to your bridal\r\nwith the Lord, one year in which you will watch over Joan and her\r\nhusband, to keep from them all the dangers that threaten. Already the\r\nwoman who was the seneschal’s wife and her son have too much influence\r\nover our grand-daughter; be specially careful, and amid the many\r\ninterests, intrigues, and temptations that will surround the young\r\nqueen, distrust particularly the affection of Bertrand d’Artois, the\r\nbeauty of Louis of Tarentum; and the ambition of Charles of Durazzo.\"\r\n\r\nThe king paused, exhausted by the effort of speaking; then turning on\r\nhis wife a supplicating glance and extending his thin wasted hand, he\r\nadded in a scarcely audible voice:\r\n\r\n\"Once again I entreat you, leave not the court before a year has passed.\r\nDo you promise me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I promise, my lord.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said Robert, whose face at these words took on a new\r\nanimation, \"call my confessor and the physician and summon the family,\r\nfor the hour is at hand, and soon I shall not have the strength to speak\r\nmy last words.\"\r\n\r\nA few moments later the priest and the doctor re-entered the room, their\r\nfaces bathed, in tears. The king thanked them warmly for their care of\r\nhim in his last illness, and begged them help to dress him in the coarse\r\ngarb of a Franciscan monk, that God, as he said, seeing him die in\r\npoverty, humility, and penitence, might the more easily grant him\r\npardon. The confessor and doctor placed upon his naked feet the sandals\r\nworn by mendicant friars, robed him in a Franciscan frock, and tied the\r\nrope about his waist. Stretched thus upon his bed, his brow surmounted\r\nby his scanty locks, with his long white beard, and his hands crossed\r\nupon his breast, the King of Naples looked like one of those aged\r\nanchorites who spend their lives in mortifying the flesh, and whose\r\nsouls, absorbed in heavenly contemplation, glide insensibly from out\r\ntheir last ecstasy into eternal bliss. Some time he lay thus with closed\r\neyes, putting up a silent prayer to God; then he bade them light the\r\nspacious room as for a great solemnity, and gave a sign to the two\r\npersons who stood, one at the head, the other at the foot of the bed.\r\nThe two folding doors opened, and the whole of the royal family, with\r\nthe queen at their head and the chief barons following, took their\r\nplaces in silence around the dying king to hear his last wishes.\r\n\r\nHis eyes turned toward Joan, who stood next him on his right hand, with\r\nan indescribable look of tenderness and grief. She was of a beauty so\r\nunusual and so marvellous, that her grandfather was fascinated by the\r\ndazzling sight, and mistook her for an angel that God had sent to\r\nconsole him on his deathbed. The pure lines of her fine profile, her\r\ngreat black liquid eyes, her noble brow uncovered, her hair shining like\r\nthe raven’s wing, her delicate mouth, the whole effect of this beautiful\r\nface on the mind of those who beheld her was that of a deep melancholy\r\nand sweetness, impressing itself once and for ever. Tall and slender,\r\nbut without the excessive thinness of some young girls, her movements\r\nhad that careless supple grace that recall the waving of a flower stalk\r\nin the breeze. But in spite of all these smiling and innocent graces one\r\ncould yet discern in Robert’s heiress a will firm and resolute to brave\r\nevery obstacle, and the dark rings that circled her fine eyes plainly\r\nshowed that her heart was already agitated by passions beyond her years.\r\n\r\nBeside Joan stood her younger sister, Marie, who was twelve or thirteen\r\nyears of age, the second daughter of Charles, Duke of Calabria, who had\r\ndied before her birth, and whose mother, Marie of Valois, had unhappily\r\nbeen lost to her from her cradle. Exceedingly pretty and shy, she seemed\r\ndistressed by such an assembly of great personages, and quietly drew\r\nnear to the widow of the grand seneschal, Philippa, surnamed the\r\nCatanese, the princesses’ governess, whom they honoured as a mother.\r\nBehind the princesses and beside this lady stood her son, Robert of\r\nCabane, a handsome young man, proud and upright, who with his left hand\r\nplayed with his slight moustache while he secretly cast on Joan a glance\r\nof audacious boldness. The group was completed by Dona Cancha, the young\r\nchamberwoman to the princesses, and by the Count of Terlizzi, who\r\nexchanged with her many a furtive look and many an open smile. The\r\nsecond group was composed of Andre, Joan’s husband, and Friar Robert,\r\ntutor to the young prince, who had come with him from Budapesth, and\r\nnever left him for a minute. Andre was at this time perhaps eighteen\r\nyears old: at first sight one was struck by the extreme regularity of\r\nhis features, his handsome, noble face, and abundant fair hair; but\r\namong all these Italian faces, with their vivid animation, his\r\ncountenance lacked expression, his eyes seemed dull, and something hard\r\nand icy in his looks revealed his wild character and foreign extraction.\r\nHis tutor’s portrait Petrarch has drawn for us: crimson face, hair and\r\nbeard red, figure short and crooked; proud in poverty, rich and miserly;\r\nlike a second Diogenes, with hideous and deformed limbs barely concealed\r\nbeneath his friar’s frock.\r\n\r\nIn the third group stood the widow of Philip, Prince of Tarentum, the\r\nking’s brother, honoured at the court of Naples with the title of\r\nEmpress of Constantinople, a style inherited by her as the granddaughter\r\nof Baldwin II. Anyone accustomed to sound the depths of the human heart\r\nwould at one glance have perceived that this woman under her ghastly\r\npallor concealed an implacable hatred, a venomous jealousy, and an\r\nall-devouring ambition. She had her three sons about her—Robert, Philip,\r\nand Louis, the youngest. Had the king chosen out from among his nephews\r\nthe handsomest, bravest, and most generous, there can be no doubt that\r\nLouis of Tarentum would have obtained the crown. At the age of\r\ntwenty-three he had already excelled the cavaliers of most renown in\r\nfeats of arms; honest, loyal, and brave, he no sooner conceived a\r\nproject than he promptly carried it out. His brow shone in that clear\r\nlight which seems to serve as a halo of success to natures so privileged\r\nas his; his fine eyes, of a soft and velvety black, subdued the hearts\r\nof men who could not resist their charm, and his caressing smile made\r\nconquest sweet. A child of destiny, he had but to use his will; some\r\npower unknown, some beneficent fairy had watched over his birth, and\r\nundertaken to smooth away all obstacles, gratify all desires.\r\n\r\nNear to him, but in the fourth group, his cousin Charles of Duras stood\r\nand scowled. His mother, Agnes, the widow of the Duke of Durazzo and\r\nAlbania, another of the king’s brothers, looked upon him affrighted,\r\nclutching to her breast her two younger sons, Ludovico, Count of\r\nGravina, and Robert, Prince of Morea. Charles, pale-faced, with short\r\nhair and thick beard, was glancing with suspicion first at his dying\r\nuncle and then at Joan and the little Marie, then again at his cousins,\r\napparently so excited by tumultuous thoughts that he could not stand\r\nstill. His feverish uneasiness presented a marked contrast with the\r\ncalm, dreamy face of Bertrand d’Artois, who, giving precedence to his\r\nfather Charles, approached the queen at the foot of the bed, and so\r\nfound himself face to face with Joan. The young man was so absorbed by\r\nthe beauty of the princess that he seemed to see nothing else in the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Joan and Andre, the Princes of Tarentum and Durazzo, the\r\nCounts of Artois, and Queen Sancha had taken their places round the bed\r\nof death, forming a semicircle, as we have just described, the\r\nvice-chancellor passed through the rows of barons, who according to\r\ntheir rank were following closely after the princes of the blood; and\r\nbowing low before the king, unfolded a parchment sealed with the royal\r\nseal, and read in a solemn voice, amid a profound silence:\r\n\r\n\"Robert, by the grace of God King of Sicily and Jerusalem, Count of\r\nProvence, Forcalquier, and Piedmont, Vicar of the Holy Roman Church,\r\nhereby nominates and declares his sole heiress in the kingdom of Sicily\r\non this side and the other side of the strait, as also in the counties\r\nof Provence, Forcalquier, and Piedmont, and in all his other\r\nterritories, Joan, Duchess of Calabria, elder daughter of the excellent\r\nlord Charles, Duke of Calabria, of illustrious memory.\r\n\r\n\"Moreover, he nominates and declares the honourable lady Marie, younger\r\ndaughter of the late Duke of Calabria, his heiress in the county of Alba\r\nand in the jurisdiction of the valley of Grati and the territory of\r\nGiordano, with all their castles and dependencies; and orders that the\r\nlady thus named receive them in fief direct from the aforesaid duchess\r\nand her heirs; on this condition, however, that if the duchess give and\r\ngrant to her illustrious sister or to her assigns the sum of 10,000\r\nounces of gold by way of compensation, the county and jurisdiction\r\naforesaid—shall remain in the possession of the duchess and her heirs.\r\n\r\n\"Moreover, he wills and commands, for private and secret reasons, that\r\nthe aforesaid lady Marie shall contract a marriage with the very\r\nillustrious prince, Louis, reigning King of Hungary. And in case any\r\nimpediment should appear to this marriage by reason of the union said to\r\nbe already arranged and signed between the King of Hungary and the King\r\nof Bohemia and his daughter, our lord the king commands that the\r\nillustrious lady Marie shall contract a marriage with the elder son of\r\nthe mighty lord Don Juan, Duke of Normandy, himself the elder son of the\r\nreigning King of France.\"\r\n\r\nAt this point Charles of Durazzo gave Marie a singularly meaning look,\r\nwhich escaped the notice of all present, their attention being absorbed\r\nby the reading of Robert’s will. The young girl herself, from the moment\r\nwhen she first heard her own name, had stood confused and thunderstruck,\r\nwith scarlet cheeks, not daring to raise her eyes.\r\n\r\nThe vice-chancellor continued:\r\n\r\n\"Moreover, he has willed and commanded that the counties of Forcalquier\r\nand Provence shall in all perpetuity be united to his kingdom, and shall\r\nform one sole and inseparable dominion, whether or not there be several\r\nsons or daughters or any other reason of any kind for its partition,\r\nseeing that this union is of the utmost importance for the security and\r\ncommon prosperity of the kingdom and counties aforesaid.\r\n\r\n\"Moreover, he has decided and commanded that in case of the death of the\r\nDuchess Joan—which God avert!—without lawful issue of her body, the most\r\nillustrious lord Andre, Duke of Calabria, her husband, shall have the\r\nprincipality of Salerno, with the title, fruits, revenues, and all the\r\nrights thereof, together with the revenue of 2000 ounces of gold for\r\nmaintenance.\r\n\r\n\"Moreover, he has decided and ordered that the Queen above all, and also\r\nthe venerable father Don Philip of Cabassole, Bishop of Cavaillon,\r\nvice-chancellor of the kingdom of Sicily, and the magnificent lords\r\nPhilip of Sanguineto, seneschal of Provence, Godfrey of Marsan, Count of\r\nSquillace, admiral of the kingdom, and Charles of Artois, Count of Aire,\r\nshall be governors, regents, and administrators of the aforesaid lord\r\nAndre and the aforesaid ladies Joan and Marie, until such time as the\r\nduke, the duchess, and the very illustrious lady Marie shall have\r\nattained their twenty-fifth year,\" etc. etc.\r\n\r\nWhen the vice-chancellor had finished reading, the king sat up, and\r\nglancing round upon his fair and numerous family, thus spoke:\r\n\r\n\"My children, you have heard my last wishes. I have bidden you all to my\r\ndeathbed, that you may see how the glory of the world passes away. Those\r\nwhom men name the great ones of the earth have more duties to perform,\r\nand after death more accounts to render: it is in this that their\r\ngreatness lies. I have reigned thirty-three years, and God before whom I\r\nam about to appear, God to whom my sighs have often arisen during my\r\nlong and painful life, God alone knows the thoughts that rend my heart\r\nin the hour of death. Soon shall I be lying in the tomb, and all that\r\nremains of me in this world will live in the memory of those who pray\r\nfor me. But before I leave you for ever, you, oh, you who are twice my\r\ndaughters, whom I have loved with a double love, and you my nephews who\r\nhave had from me all the care and affection of a father, promise me to\r\nbe ever united in heart and in wish, as indeed you are in my love. I\r\nhave lived longer than your fathers, I the eldest of all, and thus no\r\ndoubt God has wished to tighten the bonds of your affection, to accustom\r\nyou to live in one family and to pay honour to one head. I have loved\r\nyou all alike, as a father should, without exception or preference. I\r\nhave disposed of my throne according to the law of nature and the\r\ninspiration of my conscience: Here are the heirs of the crown of Naples;\r\nyou, Joan, and you, Andre, will never forget the love and respect that\r\nare due between husband and wife, and mutually sworn by you at the foot\r\nof the altar; and you, my nephews all; my barons, my officers, render\r\nhomage to your lawful sovereigns; Andre of Hungary, Louis of Tarentum,\r\nCharles of Durazzo, remember that you are brothers; woe to him who shall\r\nimitate the perfidy of Cain! May his blood fall upon his own head, and\r\nmay he be accursed by Heaven as he is by the mouth of a dying man; and\r\nmay the blessing of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit descend\r\nupon that man whose heart is good, when the Lord of mercy shall call to\r\nmy soul Himself!\"\r\n\r\nThe king remained motionless, his arms raised, his eyes fixed on heaven,\r\nhis cheeks extraordinarily bright, while the princes, barons, and\r\nofficers of the court proffered to Joan and her husband the oath of\r\nfidelity and allegiance. When it was the turn of the Princes of Duras to\r\nadvance, Charles disdainfully stalked past Andre, and bending his knee\r\nbefore the princess, said in a loud voice, as he kissed her hand—\r\n\r\n\"To you, my queen, I pay my homage.\"\r\n\r\nAll looks were turned fearfully towards the dying man, but the good king\r\nno longer heard. Seeing him fall back rigid and motionless, Dona Sancha\r\nburst into sobs, and cried in a voice choked with tears—\r\n\r\n\"The king is dead; let us pray for his soul.\"\r\n\r\nAt the very same moment all the princes hurried from the room, and every\r\npassion hitherto suppressed in the presence of the king now found its\r\nvent like a mighty torrent breaking through its banks.\r\n\r\n\"Long live Joan!\" Robert of Cabane, Louis of Tarentum, and Bertrand of\r\nArtois were the first to exclaim, while the prince’s tutor, furiously\r\nbreaking through the crowd and apostrophising the various members of the\r\ncouncil of regency, cried aloud in varying tones of passion, \"Gentlemen,\r\nyou have forgotten the king’s wish already; you must cry, ’Long live\r\nAndre!’ too;\" then, wedding example to precept, and himself making more\r\nnoise than all the barons together, he cried in a voice of thunder—\r\n\r\n\"Long live the King of Naples!\"\r\n\r\nBut there was no echo to his cry, and Charles of Durazzo, measuring the\r\nDominican with a terrible look, approached the queen, and taking her by\r\nthe hand, slid back the curtains of the balcony, from which was seen the\r\nsquare and the town of Naples. So far as the eye could reach there\r\nstretched an immense crowd, illuminated by streams of light, and\r\nthousands of heads were turned upward towards Castel Nuovo to gather any\r\nnews that might be announced. Charles respectfully drawing back and\r\nindicating his fair cousin with his hand, cried out—\r\n\r\n\"People of Naples, the King is dead: long live the Queen!\"\r\n\r\n\"Long live Joan, Queen of Naples!\" replied the people, with a single\r\nmighty cry that resounded through every quarter of the town.\r\n\r\nThe events that on this night had followed each other with the rapidity\r\nof a dream had produced so deep an impression on Joan’s mind, that,\r\nagitated by a thousand different feelings, she retired to her own rooms,\r\nand shutting herself up in her chamber, gave free vent to her grief. So\r\nlong as the conflict of so many ambitions waged about the tomb, the\r\nyoung queen, refusing every consolation that was offered her, wept\r\nbitterly for the death of her grandfather, who had loved her to the\r\npoint of weakness. The king was buried with all solemnity in the church\r\nof Santa Chiara, which he had himself founded and dedicated to the Holy\r\nSacrament, enriching it with magnificent frescoes by Giotto and other\r\nprecious relics, among which is shown still, behind the tribune of the\r\nhigh altar, two columns of white marble taken from Solomon’s temple.\r\nThere still lies Robert, represented on his tomb in the dress of a king\r\nand in a monk’s frock, on the right of the monument to his son Charles,\r\nthe Duke of Calabria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as the obsequies were over, Andre’s tutor hastily assembled the\r\nchief Hungarian lords, and it was decided in a council held in the\r\npresence of the prince and with his consent, to send letters to his\r\nmother, Elizabeth of Poland, and his brother, Louis of Hungary, to make\r\nknown to them the purport of Robert’s will, and at the same time to\r\nlodge a complaint at the court of Avignon against the conduct of the\r\nprinces and people of Naples in that they had proclaimed Joan alone\r\nQueen of Naples, thus overlooking the rights of her husband, and further\r\nto demand for him the pope’s order for Andre’s coronation. Friar Robert,\r\nwho had not only a profound knowledge of the court intrigues, but also\r\nthe experience of a philosopher and all a monk’s cunning, told his pupil\r\nthat he ought to profit by the depression of spirit the king’s death had\r\nproduced in Joan, and ought not to suffer her favourites to use this\r\ntime in influencing her by their seductive counsels.\r\n\r\nBut Joan’s ability to receive consolation was quite as ready as her\r\ngrief had at first been impetuous; the sobs which seemed to be breaking\r\nher heart ceased all at once; new thoughts, more gentle, less\r\nlugubrious, took possession of the young queen’s mind; the trace of\r\ntears vanished, and a smile lit up her liquid eyes like the sun’s ray\r\nfollowing on rain. This change, anxiously awaited, was soon observed by\r\nJoan’s chamberwoman: she stole to the queen’s room, and falling on her\r\nknees, in accents of flattery and affection, she offered her first\r\ncongratulations to her lovely mistress. Joan opened her arms and held\r\nher in a long embrace, for Dona Cancha was far more to her than a\r\nlady-in-waiting; she was the companion of infancy, the depositary of all\r\nher secrets, the confidante of her most private thoughts. One had but to\r\nglance at this young girl to understand the fascination she could\r\nscarcely fail to exercise over the queen’s mind. She had a frank and\r\nsmiling countenance, such as inspires confidence and captivates the mind\r\nat first sight. Her face had an irresistible charm, with clear blue\r\neyes, warm golden hair, mouth bewitchingly turned up at the corners, and\r\ndelicate little chin. Wild, happy, light of heart, pleasure and love\r\nwere the breath of her being; her dainty refinement, her charming\r\ninconstancies, all made her at sixteen as lovely as an angel, though at\r\nheart she was corrupt. The whole court was at her feet, and Joan felt\r\nmore affection for her than for her own sister.\r\n\r\n\"Well, my dear Cancha,\" she murmured, with a sigh, \"you find me very sad\r\nand very unhappy!\"\r\n\r\n\"And you find me, fair queen,\" replied the confidante, fixing an\r\nadmiring look on Joan,—\"you find me just the opposite, very happy that I\r\ncan lay at your feet before anyone else the proof of the joy that the\r\npeople of Naples are at this moment feeling. Others perhaps may envy you\r\nthe crown that shines upon your brow, the throne which is one of the\r\nnoblest in the world, the shouts of this entire town that sound rather\r\nlike worship than homage; but I, madam, I envy you your lovely black\r\nhair, your dazzling eyes, your more than mortal grace, which make every\r\nman adore you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet you know, my Cancha, I am much to be pitied both as a queen and\r\nas a woman: when one is fifteen a crown is heavy to wear, and I have not\r\nthe liberty of the meanest of my subjects—I mean in my affections; for\r\nbefore I reached an age when I could think I was sacrificed to a man\r\nwhom I can never love.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet, madam,\" replied Cancha in a more insinuating voice, \"in this court\r\nthere is a young cavalier who might by virtue of respect, love, and\r\ndevotion have made you forget the claims of this foreigner, alike\r\nunworthy to be our king and to be your husband.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen heaved a heavy sigh.\r\n\r\n\"When did you lose your skill to read my heart?\" she cried. \"Must I\r\nactually tell you that this love is making me wretched? True, at the\r\nvery first this unsanctioned love was a keen joy: a new life seemed to\r\nwake within my heart; I was drawn on, fascinated by the prayers, the\r\ntears, and the despair of this man, by the opportunities that his mother\r\nso easily granted, she whom I had always looked upon as my own mother; I\r\nhave loved him.... O my God, I am still so young, and my past is so\r\nunhappy. At times strange thoughts come into my mind: I fancy he no\r\nlonger loves me, that he never did love me; I fancy he has been led on\r\nby ambition, by self-interest, by some ignoble motive, and has only\r\nfeigned a feeling that he has never really felt. I feel myself a\r\ncoldness I cannot account for; in his presence I am constrained, I am\r\ntroubled by his look, his voice makes me tremble: I fear him; I would\r\nsacrifice a year of my life could I never have listened to him.\"\r\n\r\nThese words seemed to touch the young confidante to the very depths of\r\nher soul; a shade of sadness crossed her brow, her eyelids dropped, and\r\nfor some time she answered nothing, showing sorrow rather than surprise.\r\nThen, lifting her head gently, she said, with visible embarrassment—\r\n\r\n\"I should never have dared to pass so severe a judgment upon a man whom\r\nmy sovereign lady has raised above other men by casting upon him a look\r\nof kindness; but if Robert of Cabane has deserved the reproach of\r\ninconstancy and ingratitude, if he has perjured himself like a coward,\r\nhe must indeed be the basest of all miserable beings, despising a\r\nhappiness which other men might have entreated of God the whole time of\r\ntheir life and paid for through eternity. One man I know, who weeps both\r\nnight and day without hope or consolation, consumed by a slow and\r\npainful malady, when one word might yet avail to save him, did it come\r\nfrom the lips of my noble mistress.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not hear another word,\" cried Joan, suddenly rising; \"there\r\nshall be no new cause for remorse in my life. Trouble has come upon me\r\nthrough my loves, both lawful and criminal; alas! no longer will I try\r\nto control my awful fate, I will bow my head without a murmur. I am the\r\nqueen, and I must yield myself up for the good of my subjects.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you forbid me, madam,\" replied Dona Cancha in a kind, affectionate\r\ntone—\"will you forbid me to name Bertrand of Artois in your presence,\r\nthat unhappy man, with the beauty of an angel and the modesty of a girl?\r\nNow that you are queen and have the life and death of your subjects in\r\nyour own keeping, will you feel no kindness towards an unfortunate one\r\nwhose only fault is to adore you, who strives with all his mind and\r\nstrength to bear a chance look of yours without dying of his joy?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have struggled hard never to look on him,\" cried the queen, urged by\r\nan impulse she was not strong enough to conquer: then, to efface the\r\nimpression that might well have been made on her friend’s mind, she\r\nadded severely, \"I forbid you to pronounce his name before me; and if he\r\nshould ever venture to complain, I bid you tell him from me that the\r\nfirst time I even suspect the cause of his distress he will be banished\r\nfor ever from my presence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, madam, dismiss me also; for I shall never be strong enough to do so\r\nhard a bidding: the unhappy man who cannot awake in your heart so much\r\nas a feeling of pity may now be struck down by yourself in your wrath,\r\nfor here he stands; he has heard your sentence, and come to die at your\r\nfeet.\"\r\n\r\nThe last words were spoken in a louder voice, so that they might be\r\nheard from outside, and Bertrand of Artois came hurriedly into the room\r\nand fell on his knees before the queen. For a long time past the young\r\nlady-in-waiting had perceived that Robert of Cabane had, through his own\r\nfault, lost the love of Joan; for his tyranny had indeed become more\r\nunendurable to her than her husband’s.\r\n\r\nDona Cancha had been quick enough to perceive that the eyes of her young\r\nmistress were wont to rest with a kind of melancholy gentleness on\r\nBertrand, a young man of handsome appearance but with a sad and dreamy\r\nexpression; so when she made up her mind to speak in his interests, she\r\nwas persuaded that the queen already loved him. Still, a bright colour\r\noverspread Joan’s face, and her anger would have fallen on both culprits\r\nalike, when in the next room a sound of steps was heard, and the voice\r\nof the grand seneschal’s widow in conversation with her son fell on the\r\nears of the three young people like a clap of thunder. Dona Cancha, pale\r\nas death, stood trembling; Bertrand felt that he was lost—all the more\r\nbecause his presence compromised the queen; Joan only, with that\r\nwonderful presence of mind she was destined to preserve in the most\r\ndifficult crises of her future life, thrust the young man against the\r\ncarved back of her bed, and concealed him completely beneath the ample\r\ncurtain: she then signed to Cancha to go forward and meet the governess\r\nand her son.\r\n\r\nBut before we conduct into the queen’s room these two persons, whom our\r\nreaders may remember in Joan’s train about the bed of King Robert, we\r\nmust relate the circumstances which had caused the family of the\r\nCatanese to rise with incredible rapidity from the lowest class of the\r\npeople to the highest rank at court. When Dona Violante of Aragon, first\r\nwife of Robert of Anjou, became the mother of Charles, who was later on\r\nthe Duke of Calabria, a nurse was sought for the infant among the most\r\nhandsome women of the people. After inspecting many women of equal merit\r\nas regards beauty, youth and health, the princess’s choice lighted on\r\nPhilippa, a young Catanese woman, the wife of a fisherman of Trapani,\r\nand by condition a laundress. This young woman, as she washed her linen\r\non the bank of a stream, had dreamed strange dreams: she had fancied\r\nherself summoned to court, wedded to a great personage, and receiving\r\nthe honours of a great lady. Thus when she was called to Castel Nuovo\r\nher joy was great, for she felt that her dreams now began to be\r\nrealised. Philippa was installed at the court, and a few months after\r\nshe began to nurse the child the fisherman was dead and she was a widow.\r\nMeanwhile Raymond of Cabane, the major-domo of King Charles II’s house,\r\nhad bought a negro from some corsairs, and having had him baptized by\r\nhis own name, had given him his liberty; afterwards observing that he\r\nwas able and intelligent, he had appointed him head cook in the king’s\r\nkitchen; and then he had gone away to the war. During the absence of his\r\npatron the negro managed his own affairs at the court so cleverly, that\r\nin a short time he was able to buy land, houses, farms, silver plate,\r\nand horses, and could vie in riches with the best in the kingdom; and as\r\nhe constantly won higher favour in the royal family, he passed on from\r\nthe kitchen to the wardrobe. The Catanese had also deserved very well of\r\nher employers, and as a reward for the care she had bestowed on the\r\nchild, the princess married her to the negro, and he, as a wedding gift,\r\nwas granted the title of knight.\r\n\r\nFrom this day forward, Raymond of Cabane and Philippa the laundress rose\r\nin the world so rapidly that they had no equal in influence at court.\r\nAfter the death of Dona Violante, the Catanese became the intimate\r\nfriend of Dona Sandra, Robert’s second wife, whom we introduced to our\r\nreaders at the beginning of this narrative. Charles, her foster son,\r\nloved her as a mother, and she was the confidante of his two wives in\r\nturn, especially of the second wife, Marie of Valois. And as the quondam\r\nlaundress had in the end learned all the manners and customs of the\r\ncourt, she was chosen at the birth of Joan and her sister to be\r\ngoverness and mistress over the young girls, and at this juncture\r\nRaymond was created major-domo. Finally, Marie of Valois on her deathbed\r\ncommended the two young princesses to her care, begging her to look on\r\nthem as her own-daughters. Thus Philippa the Catanese, honoured in\r\nfuture as foster mother of the heiress to the throne of Naples, had\r\npower to nominate her husband grand seneschal, one of the seven most\r\nimportant offices in the kingdom, and to obtain knighthood for her sons.\r\nRaymond of Cabane was buried like a king in a marble tomb in the church\r\nof the Holy Sacrament, and there was speedily joined by two of his sons.\r\nThe third, Robert, a youth of extraordinary strength and beauty, gave up\r\nan ecclesiastical career, and was himself made major-domo, his two\r\nsisters being married to the Count of Merlizzi and the Count of Morcone\r\nrespectively. This was now the state of affairs, and the influence of\r\nthe grand seneschal’s widow seemed for ever established, when an\r\nunexpected event suddenly occurred, causing such injury as might well\r\nsuffice to upset the edifice of her fortunes that had been raised stone\r\nby stone patiently and slowly: this edifice was now undermined and\r\nthreatened to fall in a single day. It was the sudden apparition of\r\nFriar Robert, who followed to the court of Rome his young pupil, who\r\nfrom infancy had been Joan’s destined husband, which thus shattered all\r\nthe designs of the Catanese and seriously menaced her future. The monk\r\nhad not been slow to understand that so long as she remained at the\r\ncourt, Andre would be no more than the slave, possibly even the victim,\r\nof his wife. Thus all Friar Robert’s thoughts were obstinately\r\nconcentrated on a single end, that of getting rid of the Catanese or\r\nneutralising her influence. The prince’s tutor and the governess of the\r\nheiress had but to exchange one glance, icy, penetrating, plain to read:\r\ntheir looks met like lightning flashes of hatred and of vengeance. The\r\nCatanese, who felt she was detected, lacked courage to fight this man in\r\nthe open, and so conceived the hope of strengthening her tottering\r\nempire by the arts of corruption and debauchery. She instilled by\r\ndegrees into her pupil’s mind the poison of vice, inflamed her youthful\r\nimagination with precocious desires, sowed in her heart the seeds of an\r\nunconquerable aversion for her husband, surrounded the poor child with\r\nabandoned women, and especially attached to her the beautiful and\r\nattractive Dona Cancha, who is branded by contemporary authors with the\r\nname of a courtesan; then summed up all these lessons in infamy by\r\nprostituting Joan to her own son. The poor girl, polluted by sin before\r\nshe knew what life was, threw her whole self into this first passion\r\nwith all the ardour of youth, and loved Robert of Cabane so violently,\r\nso madly, that the Catanese congratulated herself on the success of her\r\ninfamy, believing that she held her prey so fast in her toils that her\r\nvictim would never attempt to escape them.\r\n\r\nA year passed by before Joan, conquered by her infatuation, conceived\r\nthe smallest suspicion of her lover’s sincerity. He, more ambitious than\r\naffectionate, found it easy to conceal his coldness under the cloak of a\r\nbrotherly intimacy, of blind submission, and of unswerving devotion;\r\nperhaps he would have deceived his mistress for a longer time had not\r\nBertrand of Artois fallen madly in love with Joan. Suddenly the bandage\r\nfell from the young girl’s eyes; comparing the two with the natural\r\ninstinct of a woman beloved which never goes astray, she perceived that\r\nRobert of Cabane loved her for his own sake, while Bertrand of Artois\r\nwould give his life to make her happy. A light fell upon her past: she\r\nmentally recalled the circumstances that preceded and accompanied her\r\nearliest love; and a shudder went through her at the thought that she\r\nhad been sacrificed to a cowardly seducer by the very woman she had\r\nloved most in the world, whom she had called by the name of mother.\r\n\r\nJoan drew back into herself, and wept bitterly. Wounded by a single blow\r\nin all her affections, at first her grief absorbed her; then, roused to\r\nsudden anger, she proudly raised her head, for now her love was changed\r\nto scorn. Robert, amazed at her cold and haughty reception of him,\r\nfollowing on so great a love, was stung by jealousy and wounded pride.\r\nHe broke out into bitter reproach and violent recrimination, and,\r\nletting fall the mask, once for all lost his place in Joan’s heart.\r\n\r\nHis mother at last saw that it was time to interfere: she rebuked her\r\nson, accusing him of upsetting all her plans by his clumsiness.\r\n\r\n\"As you have failed to conquer her by love,\" she said, \"you must now\r\nsubdue her by fear. The secret of her honour is in our hands, and she\r\nwill never dare to rebel. She plainly loves Bertrand of Artois, whose\r\nlanguishing eyes and humble sighs contrast in a striking manner with\r\nyour haughty indifference and your masterful ways. The mother of the\r\nPrinces of Tarentum, the Empress of Constantinople, will easily seize an\r\noccasion of helping on the princess’s love so as to alienate her more\r\nand more from her husband: Cancha will be the go between, and sooner or\r\nlater we shall find Bertrand at Joan’s feet. Then she will be able to\r\nrefuse us nothing.\"\r\n\r\nWhile all this was going on, the old king died, and the Catanese, who\r\nhad unceasingly kept on the watch for the moment she had so plainly\r\nforeseen, loudly called to her son, when she saw Bertrand slip into\r\nJoan’s apartment, saying as she drew him after her—\r\n\r\n\"Follow me, the queen is ours.\"\r\n\r\nIt was thus that she and her son came to be there. Joan, standing in the\r\nmiddle of the chamber, pallid, her eyes fixed on the curtains of the\r\nbed, concealed her agitation with a smile, and took one step forward\r\ntowards her governess, stooping to receive the kiss which the latter\r\nbestowed upon her every morning. The Catanese embraced her with affected\r\ncordiality, and turning, to her son, who had knelt upon one knee, said,\r\npointing to Robert—\r\n\r\n\"My fair queen, allow the humblest of your subjects to offer his sincere\r\ncongratulations and to lay his homage at your feet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rise, Robert,\" said Joan, extending her hand kindly, and with no show\r\nof bitterness. \"We were brought up together, and I shall never forget\r\nthat in our childhood—I mean those happy days when we were both\r\ninnocent—I called you my brother.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you allow me, madam,\" said Robert, with an ironical smile, \"I too\r\nshall always remember the names you formerly gave me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" said the Catanese, \"shall forget that I speak to the Queen of\r\nNaples, in embracing once more my beloved daughter. Come, madam, away\r\nwith care: you have wept long enough; we have long respected your grief.\r\nIt is now time to show yourself to these good Neapolitans who bless\r\nHeaven continually for granting them a queen so beautiful and good; it\r\nis time that your favours fall upon the heads of your faithful subjects,\r\nand my son, who surpasses all in his fidelity, comes first to ask a\r\nfavour of you, in order that he may serve you yet more zealously.\"\r\n\r\nJoan cast on Robert a withering look, and, speaking to the Catanese,\r\nsaid with a scornful air—\r\n\r\n\"You know, madam, I can refuse your son nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"All he asks,\" continued the lady, \"is a title which is his due, and\r\nwhich he inherited from his father—the title of Grand Seneschal of the\r\nTwo Sicilies: I trust, my daughter, you will have no difficulty in\r\ngranting this.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I must consult the council of regency.\"\r\n\r\n\"The council will hasten to ratify the queen’s wishes,\" replied Robert,\r\nhanding her the parchment with an imperious gesture: \"you need only\r\nspeak to the Count of Artois.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he cast a threatening glance at the curtain, which had slightly\r\nmoved.\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" said the queen at once; and going up to a table she\r\nsigned the parchment with a trembling hand.\r\n\r\n\"Now, my daughter, I have come in the name of all the care I bestowed on\r\nyour infancy, of all the maternal love I have lavished on you, to\r\nimplore a favour that my family will remember for evermore.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen recoiled one step, crimson with astonishment and rage; but\r\nbefore she could find words to reply, the lady continued in a voice that\r\nbetrayed no feeling—\r\n\r\n\"I request you to make my son Count of Eboli.\"\r\n\r\n\"That has nothing to do with me, madam; the barons of this kingdom would\r\nrevolt to a man if I were on my own authority to exalt to one of the\r\nfirst dignities the son of a—-\"\r\n\r\n\"A laundress and a negro; you would say, madam?\" said Robert, with a\r\nsneer. \"Bertrand of Artois would be annoyed perhaps if I had a title\r\nlike his.\"\r\n\r\nHe advanced a step towards the bed, his hand upon the hilt of his sword.\r\n\r\n\"Have mercy, Robert!\" cried the queen, checking him: \"I will do all you\r\nask.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she signed the parchment naming him Count of Eboli.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" Robert went on impudently, \"to show that my new title is not\r\nillusory, while you are busy about signing documents, let me have the\r\nprivilege of taking part in the councils of the crown: make a\r\ndeclaration that, subject to your good pleasure, my mother and I are to\r\nhave a deliberative voice in the council whenever an important matter is\r\nunder discussion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" cried Joan, turning pale. \"Philippa and Robert, you abuse my\r\nweakness and treat your queen shamefully. In the last few days I have\r\nwept and suffered continually, overcome by a terrible grief; I have no\r\nstrength to turn to business now. Leave me, I beg: I feel my strength\r\ngives way.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, my daughter,\" cried the Catanese hypocritically, \"are you feeling\r\nunwell? Come and lie down at once.\" And hurrying to the bed, she took\r\nhold of the curtain that concealed the Count of Artois.\r\n\r\nThe queen uttered a piercing cry, and threw herself before Philippa with\r\nthe fury of a lioness. \"Stop!\" she cried in a choking voice; \"take the\r\nprivilege you ask, and now, if you value your own life, leave me.\"\r\n\r\nThe Catanese and her son departed instantly, not even waiting to reply,\r\nfor they had got all they wanted; while Joan, trembling, ran desperately\r\nup to Bertrand, who had angrily drawn his dagger, and would have fallen\r\nupon the two favourites to take vengeance for the insults they had\r\noffered to the queen; but he was very soon disarmed by the lovely\r\nshining eyes raised to him in supplication, the two arms cast about him,\r\nand the tears shed by Joan: he fell at her feet and kissed them\r\nrapturously, with no thought of seeking excuse for his presence, with no\r\nword of love, for it was as if they had loved always: he lavished the\r\ntenderest caresses on her, dried her tears, and pressed his trembling\r\nlips upon her lovely head. Joan began to forget her anger, her vows, and\r\nher repentance: soothed by the music of her lover’s speech, she returned\r\nuncomprehending monosyllables: her heart beat till it felt like\r\nbreaking, and once more she was falling beneath love’s resistless spell,\r\nwhen a new interruption occurred, shaking her roughly out of her\r\necstasy; but this time the young count was able to pass quietly and\r\ncalmly into a room adjoining, and Joan prepared to receive her\r\nimportunate visitor with severe and frigid dignity.\r\n\r\nThe individual who arrived at so inopportune a moment was little\r\ncalculated to smooth Joan’s ruffled brow, being Charles, the eldest son\r\nof the Durazzo family. After he had introduced his fair cousin to the\r\npeople as their only legitimate sovereign, he had sought on various\r\noccasions to obtain an interview with her, which in all probability\r\nwould be decisive. Charles was one of those men who to gain their end\r\nrecoil at nothing; devoured by raging ambition and accustomed from his\r\nearliest years to conceal his most ardent desires beneath a mask of\r\ncareless indifference, he marched ever onward, plot succeeding plot,\r\ntowards the object he was bent upon securing, and never deviated one\r\nhair’s-breadth from the path he had marked out, but only acted with\r\ndouble prudence after each victory, and with double courage after each\r\ndefeat. His cheek grew pale with joy; when he hated most, he smiled; in\r\nall the emotions of his life, however strong, he was inscrutable. He had\r\nsworn to sit on the throne of Naples, and long had believed himself the\r\nrightful heir, as being nearest of kin to Robert of all his nephews. To\r\nhim the hand of Joan would have been given, had not the old king in his\r\nlatter days conceived the plan of bringing Andre from Hungary and\r\nre-establishing the elder branch in his person, though that had long\r\nsince been forgotten. But his resolution had never for a moment been\r\nweakened by the arrival of Andre in the kingdom, or by the profound\r\nindifference wherewith Joan, preoccupied with other passion, had always\r\nreceived the advances of her cousin Charles of Durazzo. Neither the love\r\nof a woman nor the life of a man was of any account to him when a crown\r\nwas weighed in the other scale of the balance.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole time that the queen had remained invisible, Charles had\r\nhung about her apartments, and now came into her presence with\r\nrespectful eagerness to inquire for his cousin’s health. The young duke\r\nhad been at pains to set off his noble features and elegant figure by a\r\nmagnificent dress covered with golden fleur-de-lys and glittering with\r\nprecious stones. His doublet of scarlet velvet and cap of the same\r\nshowed up, by their own splendour, the warm colouring of his skin, while\r\nhis face seemed illumined by his black eyes that shone keen as an\r\neagle’s.\r\n\r\nCharles spoke long with his cousin of the people’s enthusiasm on her\r\naccession and of the brilliant destiny before her; he drew a hasty but\r\ntruthful sketch of the state of the kingdom; and while he lavished\r\npraises on the queen’s wisdom, he cleverly pointed out what reforms were\r\nmost urgently needed by the country; he contrived to put so much warmth,\r\nyet so much reserve, into his speech that he destroyed the disagreeable\r\nimpression his arrival had produced. In spite of the irregularities of\r\nher youth and the depravity brought about by her wretched education,\r\nJoan’s nature impelled her to noble action: when the welfare of her\r\nsubjects was concerned, she rose above the limitations of her age and\r\nsex, and, forgetting her strange position, listened to the Duke of\r\nDurazzo with the liveliest interest and the kindliest attention. He then\r\nhazarded allusions to the dangers that beset a young queen, spoke\r\nvaguely of the difficulty in distinguishing between true devotion and\r\ncowardly complaisance or interested attachment; he spoke of the\r\ningratitude of many who had been loaded with benefits, and had been most\r\ncompletely trusted. Joan, who had just learned the truth of his words by\r\nsad experience, replied with a sigh, and after a moment’s silence added—\r\n\r\n\"May God, whom I call to witness for the loyalty and uprightness of my\r\nintentions, may God unmask all traitors and show me my true friends! I\r\nknow that the burden laid upon me is heavy, and I presume not on my\r\nstrength, but I trust that the tried experience of those counsellors to\r\nwhom my uncle entrusted me, the support of my family, and your warm and\r\nsincere friendship above all, my dear cousin, will help me to accomplish\r\nmy duty.\"\r\n\r\n\"My sincerest prayer is that you may succeed, my fair cousin, and I will\r\nnot darken with doubts and fears a time that ought to be given up to\r\njoy; I will not mingle with the shouts of gladness that rise on all\r\nsides to proclaim you queen, any vain regrets over that blind fortune\r\nwhich has placed beside the woman whom we all alike adore, whose single\r\nglance would make a man more blest than the angels, a foreigner unworthy\r\nof your love and unworthy of your throne.\"\r\n\r\n\"You forget, Charles,\" said the queen, putting out her hand as though to\r\ncheck his words, \"Andre is my husband, and it was my grandfather’s will\r\nthat he should reign with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" cried the duke indignantly; \"he King of Naples! Nay, dream that\r\nthe town is shaken to its very foundations, that the people rise as one\r\nman, that our church bells sound a new Sicilian vespers, before the\r\npeople of Naples will endure the rule of a handful of wild Hungarian\r\ndrunkards, a deformed canting monk, a prince detested by them even as\r\nyou are beloved!\"\r\n\r\n\"But why is Andre blamed? What has he done?\"\r\n\r\n\"What has he done? Why is he blamed, madam? The people blame him as\r\nstupid, coarse, a savage; the nobles blame him for ignoring their\r\nprivileges and openly supporting men of obscure birth; and I,\r\nmadam,\"—here he lowered his voice, \"I blame him for making you unhappy.\"\r\n\r\nJoan shuddered as though a wound had been touched by an unkind hand; but\r\nhiding her emotion beneath an appearance of calm, she replied in a voice\r\nof perfect indifference—\r\n\r\n\"You must be dreaming, Charles; who has given you leave to suppose I am\r\nunhappy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not try to excuse him, my dear cousin,\" replied Charles eagerly;\r\n\"you will injure yourself without saving him.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen looked fixedly at her cousin, as though she would read him\r\nthrough and through and find out the meaning of his words; but as she\r\ncould not give credence to the horrible thought that crossed her mind,\r\nshe assumed a complete confidence in her cousin’s friendship, with a\r\nview to discovering his plans, and said carelessly—\r\n\r\n\"Well, Charles, suppose I am not happy, what remedy could you offer me\r\nthat I might escape my lot?\"\r\n\r\n\"You ask me that, my dear cousin? Are not all remedies good when you\r\nsuffer, and when you wish for revenge?\"\r\n\r\n\"One must fly to those means that are possible. Andre will not readily\r\ngive up his pretensions: he has a party of his own, and in case of open\r\nrupture his brother the King of Hungary may declare war upon us, and\r\nbring ruin and desolation upon our kingdom.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Duras faintly smiled, and his countenance assumed a sinister\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n\"You do not understand me,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Then explain without circumlocution,\" said the queen, trying to conceal\r\nthe convulsive shudder that ran through her limbs.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Joan,\" said Charles, taking his cousin’s hand and laying it\r\nupon his heart: \"can you feel that dagger?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can,\" said Joan, and she turned pale.\r\n\r\n\"One word from you—and—\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow you will be free.\"\r\n\r\n\"A murder!\" cried Joan, recoiling in horror: \"then I was not deceived;\r\nit is a murder that you have proposed.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a necessity,\" said the duke calmly: \"today I advise; later on you\r\nwill give your orders.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough, wretch! I cannot tell if you are more cowardly or more rash:\r\ncowardly, because you reveal a criminal plot feeling sure that I shall\r\nnever denounce you; rash, because in revealing it to me you cannot tell\r\nwhat witnesses are near to hear it all.\"\r\n\r\n\"In any case, madam, since I have put myself in your hands, you must\r\nperceive that I cannot leave you till I know if I must look upon myself\r\nas your friend or as your enemy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Leave me,\" cried Joan, with a disdainful gesture; \"you insult your\r\nqueen.\"\r\n\r\n\"You forget, my dear cousin, that some day I may very likely have a\r\nclaim to your kingdom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not force me to have you turned out of this room,\" said Joan,\r\nadvancing towards the door.\r\n\r\n\"Now do not get excited, my fair cousin; I am going: but at least\r\nremember that I offered you my hand and you refused it. Remember what I\r\nsay at this solemn moment: to-day I am the guilty man; some day perhaps\r\nI may be the judge.\"\r\n\r\nHe went away slowly, twice turning his head, repeating in the language\r\nof signs his menacing prophecy. Joan hid her face in her hands, and for\r\na long time remained plunged in dismal reflections; then anger got the\r\nbetter of all her other feelings, and she summoned Dona Cancha, bidding\r\nher not to allow anybody to enter, on any pretext whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThis prohibition was not for the Count of Artois, for the reader will\r\nremember that he was in the adjoining room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nNight fell, and from the Molo to the Mergellina, from the Capuano Castle\r\nto the hill of St. Elmo, deep silence had succeeded the myriad sounds\r\nthat go up from the noisiest city in the world. Charles of Durazzo,\r\nquickly walking away from the square of the Correggi, first casting one\r\nlast look of vengeance at the Castel Nuovo, plunged into the labyrinth\r\nof dark streets that twist and turn, cross and recross one another, in\r\nthis ancient city, and after a quarter of an hour’s walking, that was\r\nfirst slow, then very rapid, arrived at his ducal palace near the church\r\nof San Giovanni al Mare. He gave certain instructions in a harsh,\r\nperemptory tone to a page who took his sword and cloak. Then Charles\r\nshut himself into his room, without going up to see his poor mother, who\r\nwas weeping, sad and solitary over her son’s ingratitude, and like every\r\nother mother taking her revenge by praying God to bless him.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Durazzo walked up and down his room several times like a\r\nlion in a cage, counting the minutes in a fever of impatience, and was\r\non the point of summoning a servant and renewing his commands, when two\r\ndull raps on the door informed him that the person he was waiting for\r\nhad arrived. He opened at once, and a man of about fifty, dressed in\r\nblack from head to foot, entered, humbly bowing, and carefully shut the\r\ndoor behind him. Charles threw himself into an easy-chair, and gazing\r\nfixedly at the man who stood before him, his eyes on the ground and his\r\narms crossed upon his breast in an attitude of the deepest respect and\r\nblind obedience, he said slowly, as though weighing each word—\r\n\r\n\"Master Nicholas of Melazzo, have you any remembrance left of the\r\nservices I once rendered you?\"\r\n\r\nThe man to whom these words were addressed trembled in every limb, as if\r\nhe heard the voice of Satan come to claim his soul; then lifting a look\r\nof terror to his questioner’s face, he asked in a voice of gloom—\r\n\r\n\"What have I done, my lord, to deserve this reproach?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not a reproach: I ask a simple question.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can my lord doubt for a moment of my eternal gratitude? Can I forget\r\nthe favours your Excellency showed me? Even if I could so lose my reason\r\nand my memory, are not my wife and son ever here to remind me that to\r\nyou we owe all our life, our honour, and our fortune? I was guilty of an\r\ninfamous act,\" said the notary, lowering his voice, \"a crime that would\r\nnot only have brought upon my head the penalty of death, but which meant\r\nthe confiscation of my goods, the ruin of my family, poverty and shame\r\nfor my only son—that very son, sire, for whom I, miserable wretch, had\r\nwished to ensure a brilliant future by means of my frightful crime: you\r\nhad in your hands the proofs of this!\r\n\r\n\"I have them still.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you will not ruin me, my lord,\" resumed the notary, trembling; \"I\r\nam at your feet, your Excellency; take my life and I will die in torment\r\nwithout a murmur, but save my son since you have been so merciful as to\r\nspare him till now; have pity on his mother; my lord, have pity!\"\r\n\r\n\"Be assured,\" said Charles, signing to him to rise; \"it is nothing to do\r\nwith your life; that will come later, perhaps. What I wish to ask of you\r\nnow is a much simpler, easier matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"My lord, I await your command.\"\r\n\r\n\"First,\" said the duke, in a voice of playful irony, \"you must draw up a\r\nformal contract of my marriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"At once, your Excellency.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are to write in the first article that my wife brings me as dowry\r\nthe county of Alba, the jurisdiction of Grati and Giordano, with all\r\ncastles, fiefs, and lands dependent thereto.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my lord—\" replied the poor notary, greatly embarrassed.\r\n\r\n\"Do you find any difficulty, Master Nicholas?\"\r\n\r\n\"God forbid, your Excellency, but—\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because, if my lord will permit, because there is only one person in\r\nNaples who possesses that dowry your Excellency mentions.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so?\"\r\n\r\n\"And she,\" stammered the notary, embarrassed more and more, \"—she is the\r\nqueen’s sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"And in the contract you will write the name of Marie of Anjou.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the young maiden,\" replied Nicholas timidly, \"whom your Excellency\r\nwould marry is destined, I thought, under the will of our late king of\r\nblessed memory, to become the wife of the King of Hungary or else of the\r\ngrandson of the King of France.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I understand your surprise: you may learn from this that an uncle’s\r\nintentions are not always the same as his nephew’s.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case, sire, if I dared—if my lord would deign to give me\r\nleave—if I had an opinion I might give, I would humbly entreat your\r\nExcellency to reflect that this would mean the abduction of a minor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Since when did you learn to be scrupulous, Master Nicholas?\"\r\n\r\nThese words were uttered with a glance so terrible that the poor notary\r\nwas crushed, and had hardly the strength to reply—\r\n\r\n\"In an hour the contract will be ready.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good: we agree as to the first point,\" continued Charles, resuming his\r\nnatural tone of voice. \"You now will hear my second charge. You have\r\nknown the Duke of Calabria’s valet for the last two years pretty\r\nintimately?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tommaso Pace; why, he is my best friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent. Listen, and remember that on your discretion the safety or\r\nruin of your family depends. A plot will soon be on foot against the\r\nqueen’s husband; the conspirators no doubt will gain over Andre’s valet,\r\nthe man you call your best friend; never leave him for an instant, try\r\nto be his shadow; day by day and hour by hour come to me and report the\r\nprogress of the plot, the names of the plotters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is this all your Excellency’s command?\"\r\n\r\n\"All.\"\r\n\r\nThe notary respectfully bowed, and withdrew to put the orders at once\r\ninto execution. Charles spent the rest of that night writing to his\r\nuncle the Cardinal de Perigord, one of the most influential prelates at\r\nthe court of Avignon. He begged him before all things to use his\r\nauthority so as to prevent Pope Clement from signing the bull that would\r\nsanction Andre’s coronation, and he ended his letter by earnestly\r\nentreating his uncle to win the pope’s consent to his marriage with the\r\nqueen’s sister.\r\n\r\n\"We shall see, fair cousin,\" he said as he sealed his letter, \"which of\r\nus is best at understanding where our interest lies. You would not have\r\nme as a friend, so you shall have me as an enemy. Sleep on in the arms\r\nof your lover: I will wake you when the time comes. I shall be Duke of\r\nCalabria perhaps some day, and that title, as you well know, belongs to\r\nthe heir to the throne.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day and on the following days a remarkable change took place in\r\nthe behaviour of Charles towards Andre: he showed him signs of great\r\nfriendliness, cleverly flattering his inclinations, and even persuading\r\nFriar Robert that, far from feeling any hostility in the matter of\r\nAndre’s coronation, his most earnest desire was that his uncle’s wishes\r\nshould be respected; and that, though he might have given the impression\r\nof acting contrary to them, it had only been done with a view to\r\nappeasing the populace, who in their first excitement might have been\r\nstirred up to insurrection against the Hungarians. He declared with much\r\nwarmth that he heartily detested the people about the queen, whose\r\ncounsels tended to lead her astray, and he promised to join Friar Robert\r\nin the endeavour to get rid of Joan’s favourites by all such means as\r\nfortune might put at his disposal. Although the Dominican did not\r\nbelieve in the least in the sincerity of his ally’s protestations, he\r\nyet gladly welcomed the aid which might prove so useful to the prince’s\r\ncause, and attributed the sudden change of front to some recent rupture\r\nbetween Charles and his cousin, promising himself that he would make\r\ncapital out of his resentment. Be that as it might, Charles wormed\r\nhimself into Andre’s heart, and after a few days one of them could\r\nhardly be seen without the other. If Andre went out hunting, his\r\ngreatest pleasure in life, Charles was eager to put his pack or his\r\nfalcons at his disposal; if Andre rode through the town, Charles was\r\nalways ambling by his side. He gave way to his whims, urged him to\r\nextravagances, and inflamed his angry passions: in a word, he was the\r\ngood angel—or the bad one—who inspired his every thought and guided his\r\nevery action.\r\n\r\nJoan soon understood this business, and as a fact had expected it. She\r\ncould have ruined Charles with a single word; but she scorned so base a\r\nrevenge, and treated him with utter contempt. Thus the court was split\r\ninto two factions: the Hungarians with Friar Robert at their head and\r\nsupported by Charles of Durazzo; on the other side all the nobility of\r\nNaples, led by the Princes of Tarentum. Joan, influenced by the grand\r\nseneschal’s widow and her two daughters, the Countesses of Terlizzi and\r\nMorcone, and also by Dona Cancha and the Empress of Constantinople, took\r\nthe side of the Neapolitan party against the pretensions of her husband.\r\nThe partisans of the queen made it their first care to have her name\r\ninscribed upon all public acts without adding Andre’s; but Joan, led by\r\nan instinct of right and justice amid all the corruption of her court,\r\nhad only consented to this last after she had taken counsel with Andre\r\nd’Isernia, a very learned lawyer of the day, respected as much for his\r\nlofty character as for his great learning. The prince, annoyed at being\r\nshut out in this way, began to act in a violent and despotic manner. On\r\nhis own authority he released prisoners; he showered favours upon\r\nHungarians, and gave especial honours and rich gifts to Giovanni Pipino,\r\nCount of Altanuera, the enemy of all others most dreaded and detested by\r\nthe Neapolitan barons. Then the Counts of San Severino, Mileto, Terlizzi\r\nand Balzo, Calanzaro and Sant’ Angelo, and most of the grandees,\r\nexasperated by the haughty insolence of Andre’s favourite, which grew\r\nevery day more outrageous, decided that he must perish, and his master\r\nwith him, should he persist in attacking their privileges and defying\r\ntheir anger.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the women who were about Joan at the court egged her on, each\r\none urged by a private interest, in the pursuit of her fresh passion.\r\nPoor Joan,—neglected by her husband and betrayed by Robert of Cabane—\r\ngave way beneath the burden of duties beyond her strength to bear, and\r\nfled for refuge to the arms of Bertrand of Artois, whose love she did\r\nnot even attempt to resist; for every feeling for religion and virtue\r\nhad been destroyed in her own set purpose, and her young inclinations\r\nhad been early bent towards vice, just as the bodies of wretched\r\nchildren are bent and their bones broken by jugglers when they train\r\nthem. Bertrand himself felt an adoration for her surpassing ordinary\r\nhuman passion. When he reached the summit of a happiness to which in his\r\nwildest dreams he had never dared to aspire, the young count nearly lost\r\nhis reason. In vain had his father, Charles of Artois (who was Count of\r\nAire, a direct descendant of Philip the Bold, and one of the regents of\r\nthe kingdom), attempted by severe admonitions to stop him while yet on\r\nthe brink of the precipice: Bertrand would listen to nothing but his\r\nlove for Joan and his implacable hatred for all the queen’s enemies.\r\nMany a time, at the close of day, as the breeze from Posilippo or\r\nSorrento coming from far away was playing in his hair, might Bertrand be\r\nseen leaning from one of the casements of Castel Nuovo, pale and\r\nmotionless, gazing fixedly from his side of the square to where the Duke\r\nof Calabria and the Duke of Durazzo came galloping home from their\r\nevening ride side by side in a cloud of dust. Then the brows of the\r\nyoung count were violently contracted, a savage, sinister look shone in\r\nhis blue eyes once so innocent, like lightning a thought of death and\r\nvengeance flashed into his mind; he would all at once begin to tremble,\r\nas a light hand was laid upon his shoulder; he would turn softly,\r\nfearing lest the divine apparition should vanish to the skies; but there\r\nbeside him stood a young girl, with cheeks aflame and heaving breast,\r\nwith brilliant liquid eyes: she had come to tell how her past day had\r\nbeen spent, and to offer her forehead for the kiss that should reward\r\nher labours and unwilling absence. This woman, dictator of laws and\r\nadministrator of justice among grave magistrates and stern ministers,\r\nwas but fifteen years old; this man; who knew her griefs, and to avenge\r\nthem was meditating regicide, was not yet twenty: two children of earth,\r\nthe playthings of an awful destiny!\r\n\r\nTwo months and a few days after the old king’s death, on the morning of\r\nFriday the 28th of March of the same year, 1343, the widow of the grand\r\nseneschal, Philippa, who, had already contrived to get forgiven for the\r\nshameful trick she had used to secure all her son’s wishes, entered the\r\nqueen’s apartments, excited by a genuine fear, pale and distracted, the\r\nbearer of news that spread terror and lamentation throughout the court:\r\nMarie, the queen’s younger sister, had disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe gardens and outside courts had been searched for any trace of her;\r\nevery corner of the castle had been examined; the guards had been\r\nthreatened with torture, so as to drag the truth from them; no one had\r\nseen anything of the princess, and nothing could be found that suggested\r\neither flight or abduction. Joan, struck down by this new blow in the\r\nmidst of other troubles, was for a time utterly prostrated; then, when\r\nshe had recovered from her first surprise, she behaved as all people do\r\nif despair takes the place of reason: she gave orders for what was\r\nalready done to be done again, she asked the same questions that could\r\nonly bring the same answers, and poured forth vain regrets and unjust\r\nreproaches. The news spread through the town, causing the greatest\r\nastonishment: there arose a great commotion in the castle, and the\r\nmembers of the regency hastily assembled, while couriers were sent out\r\nin every direction, charged to promise 12,000 ducats to whomsoever\r\nshould discover the place where the princess was concealed. Proceedings\r\nwere at once taken against the soldiers who were on guard at the\r\nfortress at the time of the disappearance.\r\n\r\nBertrand of Artois drew the queen apart, telling her his suspicions,\r\nwhich fell directly upon Charles of Durazzo; but Joan lost no time in\r\npersuading him of the improbability of his hypothesis: first of all,\r\nCharles had never once set his foot in Castel Nuovo since the day of his\r\nstormy interview with the queen, but had made a point of always leaving\r\nAndre by the bridge when he came to the town with him; besides, it had\r\nnever been noticed, even in the past, that the young duke had spoken to\r\nMarie or exchanged looks with her: the result of all attainable evidence\r\nwas that no stranger had entered the castle the evening before except a\r\nnotary named Master Nicholas of Melazzo, an old person, half silly, half\r\nfanatical, for whom Tommaso Pace, valet de chambre to the Duke of\r\nCalabria, was ready to answer with his life. Bertrand yielded to the\r\nqueen’s reasoning, and day by day advanced new suggestions, each less\r\nprobable than the last, to draw his mistress on to feel a hope that he\r\nwas far from feeling himself.\r\n\r\nBut a month later, and precisely on the morning of Monday the 30th of\r\nApril, a strange and unexpected scene took place, an exhibition of\r\nboldness transcending all calculations. The Neapolitan people were\r\nstupefied in astonishment, and the grief of Joan and her friends was\r\nchanged to indignation. Just as the clock of San Giovanni struck twelve,\r\nthe gate of the magnificent palace of the Durazzo flung open its folding\r\ndoors, and there came forth to the sound of trumpets a double file of\r\ncavaliers on richly caparisoned horses, with the duke’s arms on their\r\nshields. They took up their station round the house to prevent the\r\npeople outside from disturbing a ceremony which was to take place before\r\nthe eyes of an immense crowd, assembled suddenly, as by a miracle, upon\r\nthe square. At the back of the court stood an altar, and upon the steps\r\nlay two crimson velvet cushions embroidered with the fleur-de-lys of\r\nFrance and the ducal crown. Charles came forward, clad in a dazzling\r\ndress, and holding by the hand the queen’s sister, the Princess Marie,\r\nat that time almost thirteen years of age. She knelt down timidly on one\r\nof the cushions, and when Charles had done the same, the grand almoner\r\nof the Duras house asked the young duke solemnly what was his intention\r\nin appearing thus humbly before a minister of the Church. At these words\r\nMaster Nicholas of Melazzo took his place on the left of the altar, and\r\nread in a firm, clear voice, first, the contract of marriage between\r\nCharles and Marie, and then the apostolic letters from His Holiness the\r\nsovereign pontiff, Clement VI, who in his own name removing all\r\nobstacles that might impede the union, such as the age of the young\r\nbride and the degrees of affinity between the two parties, authorised\r\nhis dearly beloved son Charles, Duke of Durazzo and Albania, to take in\r\nmarriage the most illustrious Marie of Anjou, sister of Joan, Queen of\r\nNaples and Jerusalem, and bestowed his benediction on the pair.\r\n\r\nThe almoner then took the young girl’s hand, and placing it in that of\r\nCharles, pronounced the prayers of the Church. Charles, turning half\r\nround to the people, said in a loud voice—\r\n\r\n\"Before God and man, this woman is my wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"And this man is my husband,\" said Marie, trembling.\r\n\r\n\"Long live the Duke and Duchess of Durazzo!\" cried the crowd, clapping\r\ntheir hands. And the young pair, at once mounting two beautiful horses\r\nand followed by their cavaliers and pages, solemnly paraded through the\r\ntown, and re-entered their palace to the sound of trumpets and cheering.\r\n\r\nWhen this incredible news was brought to the queen, her first feeling\r\nwas joy at the recovery of her sister; and when Bertrand of Artois was\r\neager to head a band of barons and cavaliers and bent on falling upon\r\nthe cortege to punish the traitor, Joan put up her hand to stop him with\r\na very mournful look.\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" she said sadly, \"it is too late. They are legally married, for\r\nthe head of the Church—who is moreover by my grandfather’s will the head\r\nof our family—has granted his permission. I only pity my poor sister; I\r\npity her for becoming so young the prey of a wretched man who sacrifices\r\nher to his own ambition, hoping by this marriage to establish a claim to\r\nthe throne. O God! what a strange fate oppresses the royal house of\r\nAnjou! My father’s early death in the midst of his triumphs; my mother’s\r\nso quickly after; my sister and I, the sole offspring of Charles I, both\r\nbefore we are women grown fallen into the hands of cowardly men, who use\r\nus but as the stepping-stones of their ambition!\" Joan fell back\r\nexhausted on her chair, a burning tear trembling on her eyelid.\r\n\r\n\"This is the second time,\" said Bertrand reproachfully, \"that I have\r\ndrawn my sword to avenge an insult offered to you, the second time I\r\nreturn it by your orders to the scabbard. But remember, Joan, the third\r\ntime will not find me so docile, and then it will not be Robert of\r\nCabane or Charles of Durazzo that I shall strike, but him who is the\r\ncause of all your misfortunes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have mercy, Bertrand! do not you also speak these words; whenever this\r\nhorrible thought takes hold of me, let me come to you: this threat of\r\nbloodshed that is drummed into my ears, this sinister vision that haunts\r\nmy sight; let me come to you, beloved, and weep upon your bosom, beneath\r\nyour breath cool my burning fancies, from your eyes draw some little\r\ncourage to revive my perishing soul. Come, I am quite unhappy enough\r\nwithout needing to poison the future by an endless remorse. Tell me\r\nrather to forgive and to forget, speak not of hatred and revenge; show\r\nme one ray of hope amid the darkness that surrounds me; hold up my\r\nwavering feet, and push me not into the abyss.\"\r\n\r\nSuch altercations as this were repeated as often as any fresh wrong\r\narose from the side of Andre or his party; and in proportion as the\r\nattacks made by Bertrand and his friends gained in vehemence—and we must\r\nadd, in justice—so did Joan’s objections weaken. The Hungarian rule, as\r\nit became more and more arbitrary and unbearable, irritated men’s minds\r\nto such a point that the people murmured in secret and the nobles\r\nproclaimed aloud their discontent. Andre’s soldiers indulged in a\r\nlibertinage which would have been intolerable in a conquered city: they\r\nwere found everywhere brawling in the taverns or rolling about\r\ndisgustingly drunk in the gutters; and the prince, far from rebuking\r\nsuch orgies, was accused of sharing them himself. His former tutor, who\r\nought to have felt bound to drag him away from so ignoble a mode of\r\nlife, rather strove to immerse him in degrading pleasures, so as to keep\r\nhim out of business matters; without suspecting it, he was hurrying on\r\nthe denouement of the terrible drama that was being acted behind the\r\nscenes at Castel Nuovo. Robert’s widow, Dona Sancha of Aragon, the good\r\nand sainted lady whom our readers may possibly have forgotten, as her\r\nfamily had done, seeing that God’s anger was hanging over her house, and\r\nthat no counsels, no tears or prayers of hers could avail to arrest it,\r\nafter wearing mourning for her husband one whole year, according to her\r\npromise, had taken the veil at the convent of Santa Maria delta Croce,\r\nand deserted the court and its follies and passions, just as the\r\nprophets of old, turning their back on some accursed city, would shake\r\nthe dust from off their sandals and depart. Sandra’s retreat was a sad\r\nomen, and soon the family dissensions, long with difficulty suppressed,\r\nsprang forth to open view; the storm that had been threatening from afar\r\nbroke suddenly over the town, and the thunderbolt was shortly to follow.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of August 1344, Joan rendered homage to Americ, Cardinal\r\nof Saint Martin and legate of Clement VI, who looked upon the kingdom of\r\nNaples as being a fief of the Church ever since the time when his\r\npredecessors had presented it to Charles of Anjou, and overthrown and\r\nexcommunicated the house of Suabia. For this solemn ceremony the church\r\nof Saint Clara was chosen, the burial-place of Neapolitan kings, and but\r\nlately the tomb of the grandfather and father of the young queen, who\r\nreposed to right and left of the high altar. Joan, clad in the royal\r\nrobe, with the crown upon her head, uttered her oath of fidelity between\r\nthe hands of the apostolic legate in the presence of her husband, who\r\nstood behind her simply as a witness, just like the other princes of the\r\nblood. Among the prelates with their pontifical insignia who formed the\r\nbrilliant following of the envoy, there stood the Archbishops of Pisa,\r\nBari, Capua, and Brindisi, and the reverend fathers Ugolino, Bishop of\r\nCastella, and Philip, Bishop of Cavaillon, chancellor to the queen. All\r\nthe nobility of Naples and Hungary were present at this ceremony, which\r\ndebarred Andre from the throne in a fashion at once formal and striking.\r\nThus, when they left the church the excited feelings of both parties\r\nmade a crisis imminent, and such hostile glances, such threatening words\r\nwere exchanged, that the prince, finding himself too weak to contend\r\nagainst his enemies, wrote the same evening to his mother, telling her\r\nthat he was about to leave a country where from his infancy upwards he\r\nhad experienced nothing but deceit and disaster.\r\n\r\nThose who know a mother’s heart will easily guess that Elizabeth of\r\nPoland was no sooner aware of the danger that threatened her son than\r\nshe travelled to Naples, arriving there before her coming was suspected.\r\nRumour spread abroad that the Queen of Hungary had come to take her son\r\naway with her, and the unexpected event gave rise to strange comments:\r\nthe fever of excitement now blazed up in another direction. The Empress\r\nof Constantinople, the Catanese, her two daughters, and all the\r\ncourtiers, whose calculations were upset by Andre’s departure, hurried\r\nto honour the arrival of the Queen of Hungary by offering a very cordial\r\nand respectful reception, with a view to showing her that, in the midst\r\nof a court so attentive and devoted, any isolation or bitterness of\r\nfeeling on the young prince’s part must spring from his pride, from an\r\nunwarrantable mistrust, and his naturally savage and untrained\r\ncharacter. Joan received her husband’s mother with so much proper\r\ndignity in her behaviour that, in spite of preconceived notions,\r\nElizabeth could not help admiring the noble seriousness and earnest\r\nfeeling she saw in her daughter-in-law. To make the visit more pleasant\r\nto an honoured guest, fetes and tournaments were given, the barons vying\r\nwith one another in display of wealth and luxury. The Empress of\r\nConstantinople, the Catanese, Charles of Duras and his young wife, all\r\npaid the utmost attention to the mother of the prince. Marie, who by\r\nreason of her extreme youth and gentleness of character had no share in\r\nany intrigues, was guided quite as much by her natural feeling as by her\r\nhusband’s orders when she offered to the Queen of Hungary those marks of\r\nregard and affection that she might have felt for her own mother. In\r\nspite, however, of these protestations of respect and love, Elizabeth of\r\nPoland trembled for her son, and, obeying a maternal instinct, chose to\r\nabide by her original intention, believing that she should never feel\r\nsafe until Andre was far away from a court in appearance so friendly but\r\nin reality so treacherous. The person who seemed most disturbed by the\r\ndeparture, and tried to hinder it by every means in his power, was Friar\r\nRobert. Immersed in his political schemes, bending over his mysterious\r\nplans with all the eagerness of a gambler who is on the point of\r\ngaining, the Dominican, who thought himself on the eve of a tremendous\r\nevent, who by cunning, patience, and labour hoped to scatter his enemies\r\nand to reign as absolute autocrat, now falling suddenly from the edifice\r\nof his dream, stiffened himself by a mighty effort to stand and resist\r\nthe mother of his pupil. But fear cried too loud in the heart of\r\nElizabeth for all the reasonings of the monk to lull it to rest: to\r\nevery argument he advanced she simply said that while her son was not\r\nking and had not entire unlimited power, it was imprudent to leave him\r\nexposed to his enemies. The monk, seeing that all was indeed lost and\r\nthat he could not contend against the fears of this woman, asked only\r\nthe boon of three days’ grace, at the end of which time, should a reply\r\nhe was expecting have not arrived, he said he would not only give up his\r\nopposition to Andre’s departure, but would follow himself, renouncing\r\nfor ever a scheme to which he had sacrificed everything.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the third day, as Elizabeth was definitely making her\r\npreparations for departure, the monk entered radiant. Showing her a\r\nletter which he had just hastily broken open, he cried triumphantly—\r\n\r\n\"God be praised, madam! I can at last give you incontestable proofs of\r\nmy active zeal and accurate foresight.\"\r\n\r\nAndre’s mother, after rapidly running through the document, turned her\r\neyes on the monk with yet some traces of mistrust in her manner, not\r\nventuring to give way to her sudden joy.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madam,\" said the monk, raising his head, his plain features\r\nlighted up by his glance of intelligence—\"yes, madam, you will believe\r\nyour eyes, perhaps, though you would never believe my words: this is not\r\nthe dream of an active imagination, the hallucination of a credulous\r\nmind, the prejudice of a limited intellect; it is a plan slowly\r\nconceived, painfully worked out, my daily thought and my whole life’s\r\nwork. I have never ignored the fact that at the court of Avignon your\r\nson had powerful enemies; but I knew also that on the very day I\r\nundertook a certain solemn engagement in the prince’s name, an\r\nengagement to withdraw those laws that had caused coldness between the\r\npope and Robert; who was in general so devoted to the Church, I knew\r\nvery well that my offer would never be rejected, and this argument of\r\nmine I kept back for the last. See, madam, my calculations are correct;\r\nyour enemies are put to shame and your son is triumphant.\"\r\n\r\nThen turning to Andre, who was just corning in and stood dumbfounded at\r\nthe threshold on hearing the last words, he added—\r\n\r\n\"Come, my son, our prayers are at last fulfilled: you are king.\"\r\n\r\n\"King!\" repeated Andre, transfixed with joy, doubt, and amazement.\r\n\r\n\"King of Sicily and Jerusalem: yes, my lord; there is no need for you to\r\nread this document that brings the joyful, unexpected news. You can see\r\nit in your mother’s tears; she holds out her arms to press you to her\r\nbosom; you can see it in the happiness of your old teacher; he falls on\r\nhis knees at your feet to salute you by this title, which he would have\r\npaid for with his own blood had it been denied to you much longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet,\" said Elizabeth, after a moment’s mournful reflection, \"if I\r\nobey my presentiments, your news will make no difference to our plans\r\nfor departure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, mother,\" said Andre firmly, \"you would not force me to quit the\r\ncountry to the detriment of my honour. If I have made you feel some of\r\nthe bitterness and sorrow that have spoiled my own young days because of\r\nmy cowardly enemies, it is not from a poor spirit, but because I was\r\npowerless, and knew it, to take any sort of striking vengeance for their\r\nsecret insults, their crafty injuries, their underhand intrigues. It was\r\nnot because my arm wanted strength, but because my head wanted a crown.\r\nI might have put an end to some of these wretched beings, the least\r\ndangerous maybe; but it would have been striking in the dark; the\r\nringleaders would have escaped, and I should never have really got to\r\nthe bottom of their infernal plots. So I have silently eaten out my own\r\nheart in shame and indignation. Now that my sacred rights are recognised\r\nby the Church, you will see, my mother, how these terrible barons, the\r\nqueen’s counsellors, the governors of the kingdom, will lower their\r\nheads in the dust: for they are threatened with no sword and no\r\nstruggle; no peer of their own is he who speaks, but the king; it is by\r\nhim they are accused, by the law they shall be condemned, and shall\r\nsuffer on the scaffold.\"\r\n\r\n\"O my beloved son,\" cried the queen in tears, \"I never doubted your\r\nnoble feelings or the justice of your claims; but when your life is in\r\ndanger, to what voice can I listen but the voice of fear? what can move\r\nmy counsels but the promptings of love?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother, believe me, if the hands and hearts alike of these cowards had\r\nnot trembled, you would have lost your son long ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not violence that I fear, my son, it is treachery.\"\r\n\r\n\"My life, like every man’s, belongs to God, and the lowest of sbirri may\r\ntake it as I turn the corner of the street; but a king owes something to\r\nhis people.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor mother long tried to bend the resolution of Andre by reason and\r\nentreaties; but when she had spoken her last word and shed her last\r\ntear, she summoned Bertram de Baux, chief-justice of the kingdom, and\r\nMarie, Duchess of Durazzo. Trusting in the old man’s wisdom and the\r\ngirl’s innocence, she commended her son to them in the tenderest and\r\nmost affecting words; then drawing from her own hand a ring richly\r\nwrought, and taking the prince aside, she slipped it upon his finger,\r\nsaying in a voice that trembled with emotion as she pressed him to her\r\nheart—\r\n\r\n\"My son, as you refuse to come with me, here is a wonderful talisman,\r\nwhich I would not use before the last extremity. So long as you wear\r\nthis ring on your finger, neither sword nor poison will have power\r\nagainst you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see then, mother,\" said the prince, smiling, \"with this protection\r\nthere is no reason at all to fear for my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are other dangers than sword or poison,\" sighed the queen.\r\n\r\n\"Be calm, mother: the best of all talismans is your prayer to God for\r\nme: it is the tender thought of you that will keep me for ever in the\r\npath of duty and justice; your maternal love will watch over me from\r\nafar, and cover me like the wings of a guardian angel.\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth sobbed as she embraced her son, and when she left him she felt\r\nher heart was breaking. At last she made up her mind to go, and was\r\nescorted by the whole court, who had never changed towards her for a\r\nmoment in their chivalrous and respectful devotion. The poor mother,\r\npale, trembling, and faint, leaned heavily upon Andre’s arm, lest she\r\nshould fall. On the ship that was to take her for ever from her son, she\r\ncast her arms for the last time about his neck, and there hung a long\r\ntime, speechless, tearless, and motionless; when the signal for\r\ndeparture was given, her women took her in their arms half swooning.\r\nAndre stood on the shore with the feeling of death at his heart: his\r\neyes were fixed upon the sail that carried ever farther from him the\r\nonly being he loved in the world. Suddenly he fancied he beheld\r\nsomething white moving a long way off: his mother had recovered her\r\nsenses by a great effort, and had dragged herself up to the bridge to\r\ngive a last signal of farewell: the unhappy lady knew too well that she\r\nwould never see her son again.\r\n\r\nAt almost the same moment that Andre’s mother left the kingdom, the\r\nformer queen of Naples, Robert’s widow, Dona Sancha, breathed her last\r\nsigh. She was buried in the convent of Santa Maria delta Croce, under\r\nthe name of Clara, which she had assumed on taking her vows as a nun, as\r\nher epitaph tells us, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Here lies, an example of great humility, the body of the sainted sister\r\nClara, of illustrious memory, otherwise Sancha, Queen of Sicily and\r\nJerusalem, widow of the most serene Robert, King of Jerusalem and\r\nSicily, who, after the death of the king her husband, when she had\r\ncompleted a year of widowhood, exchanged goods temporary for goods\r\neternal. Adopting for the love of God a voluntary poverty, and\r\ndistributing her goods to the poor, she took upon her the rule of\r\nobedience in this celebrated convent of Santa Croce, the work of her own\r\nhands, in the year 1344, on the gist of January of the twelfth\r\nindiction, where, living a life of holiness under the rule of the\r\nblessed Francis, father of the poor, she ended her days religiously in\r\nthe year of our Lord 1345, on the 28th of July of the thirteenth\r\nindiction. On the day following she was buried in this tomb.\"\r\n\r\nThe death of Dona Sancha served to hasten on the catastrophe which was\r\nto stain the throne of Naples with blood: one might almost fancy that\r\nGod wished to spare this angel of love and resignation the sight of so\r\nterrible a spectacle, that she offered herself as a propitiatory\r\nsacrifice to redeem the crimes of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nEight days after the funeral of the old queen, Bertrand of Artois came\r\nto Joan, distraught, dishevelled, in a state of agitation and confusion\r\nimpossible to describe.\r\n\r\nJoan went quickly up to her lover, asking him with a look of fear to\r\nexplain the cause of his distress.\r\n\r\n\"I told you, madam,\" cried the young baron excitedly, \"you will end by\r\nruining us all, as you will never take any advice from me.\"\r\n\r\n\"For God’s sake, Bertrand, speak plainly: what has happened? What advice\r\nhave I neglected?\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam, your noble husband, Andre of Hungary, has just been made King of\r\nJerusalem and Sicily, and acknowledged by the court of Avignon, so\r\nhenceforth you will be no better than his slave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Count of Artois, you are dreaming.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, madam, I am not dreaming: I have this fact to prove the truth of my\r\nwords, that the pope’s ambassadors are arrived at Capua with the bull\r\nfor his coronation, and if they do not enter Castel Nuovo this very\r\nevening, the delay is only to give the new king time to make his\r\npreparations.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen bent her head as if a thunderbolt had fallen at her feet.\r\n\r\n\"When I told you before,\" said the count, with growing fury, \"that we\r\nought to use force to make a stand against him, that we ought to break\r\nthe yoke of this infamous tyranny and get rid of the man before he had\r\nthe means of hurting you, you always drew back in childish fear, with a\r\nwoman’s cowardly hesitation.\"\r\n\r\nJoan turned a tearful look upon her lover.\r\n\r\n\"God, my God!\" she cried, clasping her hands in desperation, \"am I to\r\nhear for ever this awful cry of death! You too, Bertrand, you too say\r\nthe word, like Robert of Cabane, like Charles of Duras? Wretched man,\r\nwhy would you raise this bloody spectre between us, to check with icy\r\nhand our adulterous kisses? Enough of such crimes; if his wretched\r\nambition makes him long to reign, let him be king: what matters his\r\npower to me, if he leaves me with your love?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not so sure that our love will last much longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is this, Bertrand? You rejoice in this merciless torture.\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you, madam, that the King of Naples has a black flag ready, and\r\non the day of his coronation it will be carried before him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you believe,\" said Joan, pale as a corpse in its shroud, \"—you\r\nbelieve that this flag is a threat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, and the threat begins to be put in execution.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen staggered, and leaned against a table to save herself from\r\nfalling.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me all,\" she cried in a choking voice; \"fear not to shock me; see,\r\nI am not trembling. O Bertrand, I entreat you!\"\r\n\r\n\"The traitors have begun with the man you most esteemed, the wisest\r\ncounsellor of the crown, the best of magistrates, the noblest-hearted,\r\nmost rigidly virtuous——\"\r\n\r\n\"Andrea of Isernia!\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam, he is no more.\"\r\n\r\nJoan uttered a cry, as though the noble old man had been slain before\r\nher eyes: she respected him as a father; then, sinking back, she\r\nremained profoundly silent.\r\n\r\n\"How did they kill him?\" she asked at last, fixing her great eyes in\r\nterror on the count.\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday evening, as he left this castle, on the way to his own home,\r\na man suddenly sprang out upon him before the Porta Petruccia: it was\r\none of Andre’s favourites, Conrad of Gottis chosen no doubt because he\r\nhad a grievance against the incorruptible magistrate on account of some\r\nsentence passed against him, and the murder would therefore be put down\r\nto motives of private revenge. The cowardly wretch gave a sign to two or\r\nthree companions, who surrounded the victim and robbed him of all means\r\nof escape. The poor old man looked fixedly at his assassin, and asked\r\nhim what he wanted. ’I want you to lose your life at my hands, as I lost\r\nmy case at yours!’ cried the murderer, and leaving him no time to\r\nanswer, he ran him through with his sword. Then the rest fell upon the\r\npoor man, who did not even try to call for help, and his body was\r\nriddled with wounds and horribly mutilated, and then left bathed in its\r\nblood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Terrible!\" murmured the queen, covering her face.\r\n\r\n\"It was only their first effort; the proscription lists are already\r\nfull: Andre must needs have blood to celebrate his accession to the\r\nthrone of Naples. And do you know, Joan, whose name stands first in the\r\ndoomed list?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whose?\" cried the queen, shuddering from head to foot.\r\n\r\n\"Mine,\" said the count calmly.\r\n\r\n\"Yours!\" cried Joan, drawing herself up to her full height; \"are you to\r\nbe killed next! Oh, be careful, Andre; you have pronounced your own\r\ndeath-sentence. Long have I turned aside the dagger pointing to your\r\nbreast, but you put an end to all my patience. Woe to you, Prince of\r\nHungary! the blood which you have spilt shall fall on your own head.\"\r\n\r\nAs she spoke she had lost her pallor; her lovely face was fired with\r\nrevenge, her eyes flashed lightning. This child of sixteen was terrible\r\nto behold; she pressed her lover’s hand with convulsive tenderness, and\r\nclung to him as if she would screen him with her own body.\r\n\r\n\"Your anger is awakened too late,\" said he gently and sadly; for at this\r\nmoment Joan seemed so lovely that he could reproach her with nothing.\r\n\"You do not know that his mother has left him a talisman preserving him\r\nfrom sword and poison?\"\r\n\r\n\"He will die,\" said Joan firmly; the smile that lighted up her face was\r\nso unnatural that the count was dismayed, and dropped his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe next day the young Queen of Naples, lovelier, more smiling than\r\never, sitting carelessly in a graceful attitude beside a window which\r\nlooked out on the magnificent view of the bay, was busy weaving a cord\r\nof silk and gold. The sun had run nearly two-thirds of his fiery course,\r\nand was gradually sinking his rays in the clear blue waters where\r\nPosilippo’s head is reflected with its green and flowery crown. A warm,\r\nbalmy breeze that had passed over the orange trees of Sorrento and\r\nAmalfi felt deliciously refreshing to the inhabitants of the capital,\r\nwho had succumbed to torpor in the enervating softness of the day. The\r\nwhole town was waking from a long siesta, breathing freely after a\r\nsleepy interval; the Molo was covered with a crowd of eager people\r\ndressed out in the brightest colours; the many cries of a festival,\r\njoyous songs, love ditties sounded from all quarters of the vast\r\namphitheatre, which is one of the chief marvels of creation; they came\r\nto the ears of Joan, and she listened as she bent over her work,\r\nabsorbed in deep thought. Suddenly, when she seemed most busily\r\noccupied, the indefinable feeling of someone near at hand, and the touch\r\nof something on her shoulder, made her start: she turned as though waked\r\nfrom a dream by contact with a serpent, and perceived her husband,\r\nmagnificently dressed, carelessly leaning against the back of her chair.\r\nFor a long time past the prince had not come to his wife in this\r\nfamiliar fashion, and to the queen the pretence of affection and\r\ncareless behaviour augured ill. Andre did not appear to notice the look\r\nof hatred and terror that had escaped Joan in spite of herself, and\r\nassuming the best expression of gentleness as that his straight hard\r\nfeatures could contrive to put on in such circumstances as these, he\r\nsmilingly asked—\r\n\r\n\"Why are you making this pretty cord, dear dutiful wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"To hang you with, my lord,\" replied the queen, with a smile.\r\n\r\nAndre shrugged his shoulders, seeing in the threat so incredibly rash\r\nnothing more than a pleasantry in rather bad taste. But when he saw that\r\nJoan resumed her work, he tried to renew the conversation.\r\n\r\n\"I admit,\" he said, in a perfectly calm voice, \"that my question is\r\nquite unnecessary: from your eagerness to finish this handsome piece of\r\nwork, I ought to suspect that it is destined for some fine knight of\r\nyours whom you propose to send on a dangerous enterprise wearing your\r\ncolours. If so, my fair queen, I claim to receive my orders from your\r\nlips: appoint the time and place for the trial, and I am sure beforehand\r\nof carrying off a prize that I shall dispute with all your adorers.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not so certain,\" said Joan, \"if you are as valiant in war as in\r\nlove.\" And she cast on her husband a look at once seductive and\r\nscornful, beneath which the young man blushed up to his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I hope,\" said Andre, repressing his feelings, \"I hope soon to give you\r\nsuch proofs of my affection that you will never doubt it again.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what makes you fancy that, my lord?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would tell you, if you would listen seriously.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am listening.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is a dream I had last night that gives me such confidence in\r\nthe future.\"\r\n\r\n\"A dream! You surely ought to explain that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dreamed that there was a grand fete in the town: an immense crowd\r\nfilled the streets like an overflowing torrent, and the heavens were\r\nringing with their shouts of joy; the gloomy granite facades were hidden\r\nby hangings of silk and festoons of flowers; the churches were decorated\r\nas though for some grand ceremony. I was riding side by side with you.\"\r\nJoan made a haughty movement: \"Forgive me, madam, it was only a dream: I\r\nwas on your right, riding a fine white horse, magnificently caparisoned,\r\nand the chief-justice of the kingdom carried before me a flag unfolded\r\nin sign of honour. After riding in triumph through the main\r\nthoroughfares of the city, we arrived, to the sound of trumpets and\r\nclarions, at the royal church of Saint Clara, where your grandfather and\r\nmy uncle are buried, and there, before the high altar, the pope’s\r\nambassador laid your hand in mine and pronounced a long discourse, and\r\nthen on our two heads in turn placed the crown of Jerusalem and Sicily;\r\nafter which the nobles and the people shouted in one voice, ’Long live\r\nthe King and Queen of Naples!’ And I, wishing to perpetuate the memory\r\nof so glorious a day, proceeded to create knights among the most zealous\r\nin our court.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you not remember the names of the chosen persons whom you judged\r\nworthy of your royal favours?\"\r\n\r\n\"Assuredly, madam: Bertrand, Count of Artois.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough, my lord; I excuse you from naming the rest: I always supposed\r\nyou were loyal and generous, but you give me fresh proof of it by\r\nshowing favour to men whom I most honour and trust. I cannot tell if\r\nyour wishes are likely soon to be realised, but in any case feel sure of\r\nmy perpetual gratitude.\"\r\n\r\nJoan’s voice did not betray the slightest emotion; her look had became\r\nkind, and the sweetest smile was on her lips. But in her heart Andre’s\r\ndeath was from that moment decided upon. The prince, too much\r\npreoccupied with his own projects of vengeance, and too confident in his\r\nall-powerful talisman and his personal valour, had no suspicion that his\r\nplans could be anticipated. He conversed a long time with his wife in a\r\nchatting, friendly way, trying to spy out her secret, and exposing his\r\nown by his interrupted phrases and mysterious reserves. When he fancied\r\nthat every cloud of former resentment, even the lightest, had\r\ndisappeared from Joan’s brow, he begged her to go with her suite on a\r\nmagnificent hunting expedition that he was organising for the 20th of\r\nAugust, adding that such a kindness on her part would be for him a sure\r\npledge of their reconciliation and complete forgetfulness of the past.\r\nJoan promised with a charming grace, and the prince retired fully\r\nsatisfied with the interview, carrying with him the conviction that he\r\nhad only to threaten to strike a blow at the queen’s favourite to ensure\r\nher obedience, perhaps even her love.\r\n\r\nBut on the eve of the 20th of August a strange and terrible scene was\r\nbeing enacted in the basement storey of one of the lateral towers of\r\nCastel Nuovo. Charles of Durazzo, who had never ceased to brood secretly\r\nover his infernal plans, had been informed by the notary whom he had\r\ncharged to spy upon the conspirators, that on that particular evening\r\nthey were about to hold a decisive meeting, and therefore, wrapped in a\r\nblack cloak, he glided into the underground corridor and hid himself\r\nbehind a pillar, there to await the issue of the conference. After two\r\ndreadful hours of suspense, every second marked out by the beating of\r\nhis heart, Charles fancied he heard the sound of a door very carefully\r\nopened; the feeble ray of a lantern in the vault scarcely served to\r\ndispel the darkness, but a man coming away from the wall approached him\r\nwalking like a living statue. Charles gave a slight cough, the sign\r\nagreed upon. The man put out his light and hid away the dagger he had\r\ndrawn in case of a surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Is it you, Master Nicholas?\" asked the duke in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\"It is I, my lord.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"They have just fixed the prince’s death for tomorrow, on his way to the\r\nhunt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you recognise every conspirator?\"\r\n\r\n\"Every one, though their faces were masked; when they gave their vote\r\nfor death, I knew them by their voices.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could you point out to me who they are?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, this very minute; they are going to pass along at the end of this\r\ncorridor. And see, here is Tommaso Pace walking in front of them to\r\nlight their way.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, a tall spectral figure, black from head to foot, his face\r\ncarefully hidden under a velvet mask, walked at the end of the corridor,\r\nlamp in hand, and stopped at the first step of a staircase which led to\r\nthe upper floors. The conspirators advanced slowly, two by two, like a\r\nprocession of ghosts, appeared for one moment in the circle of light\r\nmade by the torch, and again disappeared into shadow.\r\n\r\n\"See, there are Charles and Bertrand of Artois,\" said the notary; \"there\r\nare the Counts of Terlizzi and Catanzaro; the grand admiral and grand\r\nseneschal, Godfrey of Marsan, Count of Squillace, and Robert of Cabane,\r\nCount of Eboli; the two women talking in a low voice with the eager\r\ngesticulations are Catherine of Tarentum, Empress of Constantinople, and\r\nPhilippa the Catanese, the queen’s governess and chief lady; there is\r\nDona Cancha, chamberwoman and confidante of Joan; and there is the\r\nCountess of Morcone.\"\r\n\r\nThe notary stopped on beholding a shadow alone, its head bowed, with\r\narms hanging loosely, choking back her sobs beneath a hood of black.\r\n\r\n\"Who is the woman who seems to drag herself so painfully along in their\r\ntrain?\" asked the duke, pressing his companion’s arm.\r\n\r\n\"That woman,\" said the notary, \"is the queen.\" \"Ah, now I see,\" thought\r\nCharles, breathing freely, with the same sort of satisfaction that Satan\r\nno doubt feels when a long coveted soul falls at length into his power.\r\n\r\n\"And now, my lord,\" continued Master Nicholas, when all had returned\r\nonce more into silence and darkness, \"if you have bidden me spy on these\r\nconspirators with a view to saving the young prince you are protecting\r\nwith love and vigilance, you must hurry forward, for to-morrow maybe it\r\nwill be too late.\"\r\n\r\n\"Follow me,\" cried the duke imperiously; \"it is time you should know my\r\nreal intention, and then carry out my orders with scrupulous exactness.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words he drew him aside to a place opposite to where the\r\nconspirators had just disappeared. The notary mechanically followed\r\nthrough a labyrinth of dark corridors and secret staircases, quite at a\r\nloss how to account for the sudden change that had come over his\r\nmaster—crossing one of the ante-chambers in the castle, they came upon\r\nAndre, who joyfully accosted them; grasping the hand of his cousin Duras\r\nin his affectionate manner, he asked him in a pressing way that would\r\nbrook no refusal, \"Will you be of our hunting party to-morrow, duke?\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, my lord,\" said Charles, bowing down to the ground; \"it will\r\nbe impossible for me to go to-morrow, for my wife is very unwell; but I\r\nentreat you to accept the best falcon I have.\"\r\n\r\nAnd here he cast upon the notary a petrifying glance.\r\n\r\nThe morning of the 20th of August was fine and calm—the irony of nature\r\ncontrasting cruelly with the fate of mankind. From break of day masters\r\nand valets, pages and knights, princes and courtiers, all were on foot;\r\ncries of joy were heard on every side when the queen arrived on a\r\nsnow-white horse, at the head of the young and brilliant throng. Joan\r\nwas perhaps paler than usual, but that might be because she had been\r\nobliged to rise very early. Andre, mounted on one of the most fiery of\r\nall the steeds he had tamed, galloped beside his wife, noble and proud,\r\nhappy in his own powers, his youth, and the thousand gilded hopes that a\r\nbrilliant future seemed to offer. Never had the court of Naples shown so\r\nbrave an aspect: every feeling of distrust and hatred seemed entirely\r\nforgotten; Friar Robert himself, suspicious as he was by nature, when he\r\nsaw the joyous cavalcade go by under his window, looked out with pride,\r\nand stroking his beard, laughed at his own seriousness.\r\n\r\nAndre’s intention was to spend several days hunting between Capua and\r\nAversa, and only to return to Naples when all was in readiness for his\r\ncoronation. Thus the first day they hunted round about Melito, and went\r\nthrough two or three villages in the land of Labore. Towards evening the\r\ncourt stopped at Aversa, with a view to passing the night there, and\r\nsince at that period there was no castle in the place worthy of\r\nentertaining the queen with her husband and numerous court, the convent\r\nof St. Peter’s at Majella was converted into a royal residence: this\r\nconvent had been built by Charles II in the year of our Lord 1309.\r\n\r\nWhile the grand seneschal was giving orders for supper and the\r\npreparation of a room for Andre and his wife, the prince, who during the\r\nwhole day had abandoned himself entirely to his favourite amusement,\r\nwent up on the terrace to enjoy the evening air, accompanied by the good\r\nIsolda, his beloved nurse, who loved him more even than his mother, and\r\nwould not leave his side for a moment. Never had the prince appeared so\r\nanimated and happy: he was in ecstasies over the beauty of the country,\r\nthe clear air, the scent of the trees around; he besieged his nurse with\r\na thousand queries, never waiting for an answer; and they were indeed\r\nlong in coming, for poor Isolda was gazing upon him with that appearance\r\nof fascination which makes a mother absent-minded when her child is\r\ntalking: Andre was eagerly telling her about a terrible boar he had\r\nchased that morning across the woods, how it had lain foaming at his\r\nfeet, and Isolda interrupted him to say he had a grain of dust in his\r\neye. Then Andre was full of his plans for the future, and Isolda stroked\r\nhis fair hair, remarking that he must be feeling very tired. Then,\r\nheeding nothing but his own joy and excitement, the young prince hurled\r\ndefiance at destiny, calling by all his gods on dangers to come forward,\r\nso that he might have the chance of quelling them, and the poor nurse\r\nexclaimed, in a flood of tears, \"My child, you love me no longer.\"\r\n\r\nOut of all patience with these constant interruptions, Andre scolded her\r\nkindly enough, and mocked at her childish fears. Then, paying no\r\nattention to a sort of melancholy that was coming over him, he bade her\r\ntell him old tales of his childhood, and had a long talk about his\r\nbrother Louis, his absent mother, and tears were in his eyes when he\r\nrecalled her last farewell. Isolda listened joyfully, and answered all\r\nhe asked; but no fell presentiment shook her heart: the poor woman loved\r\nAndre with all the strength of her soul; for him she would have given up\r\nher life in this world and in the world to come; yet she was not his\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nWhen all was ready, Robert of Cabane came to tell the prince that the\r\nqueen awaited him; Andre cast one last look at the smiling fields\r\nbeneath the starry heavens, pressed his nurse’s hand to his lips and to\r\nhis heart, and followed the grand seneschal slowly and, it seemed, with\r\nsome regret. But soon the brilliant lights of the room, the wine that\r\ncirculated freely, the gay talk, the eager recitals of that day’s\r\nexploits served to disperse the cloud of gloom that had for a moment\r\noverspread the countenance of the prince. The queen alone, leaning on\r\nthe table with fixed eyes and lips that never moved, sat at this strange\r\nfeast pale and cold as a baleful ghost summoned from the tomb to disturb\r\nthe joy of the party. Andre, whose brain began to be affected by the\r\ndraughts of wine from Capri and Syracuse, was annoyed at his wife’s\r\nlook, and attributing it to contempt, filled a goblet to the brim and\r\npresented it to the queen. Joan visibly trembled, her lips moved\r\nconvulsively; but the conspirators drowned in their noisy talk the\r\ninvoluntary groan that escaped her. In the midst of a general uproar,\r\nRobert of Cabane proposed that they should serve generous supplies of\r\nthe same wine drunk at the royal table to the Hungarian guards who were\r\nkeeping watch at the approaches to the convent, and this liberality\r\nevoked frenzied applause. The shouting of the soldiers soon gave witness\r\nto their gratitude for the unexpected gift, and mingled with the\r\nhilarious toasts of the banqueters. To put the finishing touch to\r\nAndre’s excitement, there were cries on every side of \"Long live the\r\nQueen! Long live His Majesty the King of Naples!\"\r\n\r\nThe orgy lasted far into the night: the pleasures of the next day were\r\ndiscussed with enthusiasm, and Bertrand of Artois protested in a loud\r\nvoice that if they were so late now some would not rise early on the\r\nmorrow. Andre declared that, for his part, an hour or two’s rest would\r\nbe enough to get over his fatigue, and he eagerly protested that it\r\nwould be well for others to follow his example. The Count of Terlizzi\r\nseemed to express some doubt as to the prince’s punctuality. Andre\r\ninsisted, and challenging all the barons present to see who would be up\r\nfirst, he retired with the queen to the room that had been reserved for\r\nthem, where he very soon fell into a deep and heavy sleep. About two\r\no’clock in the morning, Tommaso Pace, the prince’s valet and first usher\r\nof the royal apartments, knocked at his master’s door to rouse him for\r\nthe chase. At the first knock, all was silence; at the second, Joan, who\r\nhad not closed her eyes all night, moved as if to rouse her husband and\r\nwarn him of the threatened danger; but at the third knock the\r\nunfortunate young man suddenly awoke, and hearing in the next room\r\nsounds of laughter and whispering, fancied that they were making a joke\r\nof his laziness, and jumped out of bed bareheaded, in nothing but his\r\nshirt, his shoes half on and half off. He opened the door; and at this\r\npoint we translate literally the account of Domenico Gravina, a\r\nhistorian of much esteem. As soon as the prince appeared, the\r\nconspirators all at once fell upon him, to strangle him with their\r\nhands; believing he could not die by poison or sword, because of the\r\ncharmed ring given him by his poor mother. But Andre was so strong and\r\nactive, that when he perceived the infamous treason he defended himself\r\nwith more than human strength, and with dreadful cries got free from his\r\nmurderers, his face all bloody, his fair hair pulled out in handfuls.\r\nThe unhappy young man tried to gain his own bedroom, so as to get some\r\nweapon and valiantly resist the assassins; but as he reached the door,\r\nNicholas of Melazzo, putting his dagger like a bolt into the lock,\r\nstopped his entrance. The prince, calling aloud the whole time and\r\nimploring the protection of his friends, returned to the hall; but all\r\nthe doors were shut, and no one held out a helping hand; for the queen\r\nwas silent, showing no uneasiness about her husband’s death.\r\n\r\nBut the nurse Isolda, terrified by the shouting of her beloved son and\r\nlord, leapt from her bed and went to the window, filling the house with\r\ndreadful cries. The traitors, alarmed by the mighty uproar, although the\r\nplace was lonely and so far from the centre of the town that nobody\r\ncould have come to see what the noise was, were on the point of letting\r\ntheir victim go, when Bertrand of Artois, who felt he was more guilty\r\nthan the others, seized the prince with hellish fury round the waist,\r\nand after a desperate struggle got him down; then dragging him by the\r\nhair of his head to a balcony which gave upon the garden, and pressing\r\none knee upon his chest, cried out to the others—\r\n\r\n\"Come here, barons: I have what we want to strangle him with.\"\r\n\r\nAnd round his neck he passed a long cord of silk and gold, while the\r\nwretched man struggled all he could. Bertrand quickly drew up the knot,\r\nand the others threw the body over the parapet of the balcony, leaving\r\nit hanging between earth and sky until death ensued. When the Count of\r\nTerlizzi averted his eyes from the horrid spectacle, Robert of Cabane\r\ncried out imperiously—\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing there? The cord is long enough for us all to hold:\r\nwe want not witnesses, we want accomplices!\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the last convulsive movements of the dying man had ceased,\r\nthey let the corpse drop the whole height of the three storeys, and\r\nopening the doors of the hall, departed as though nothing had happened.\r\n\r\nIsolda, when at last she contrived to get a light, rapidly ran to the\r\nqueen’s chamber, and finding the door shut on the inside, began to call\r\nloudly on her Andre. There was no answer, though the queen was in the\r\nroom. The poor nurse, distracted, trembling, desperate, ran down all the\r\ncorridors, knocked at all the cells and woke the monks one by one,\r\nbegging them to help her look for the prince. The monks said that they\r\nhad indeed heard a noise, but thinking it was a quarrel between soldiers\r\ndrunken perhaps or mutinous, they had not thought it their business to\r\ninterfere. Isolda eagerly, entreated: the alarm spread through the\r\nconvent; the monks followed the nurse, who went on before with a torch.\r\nShe entered the garden, saw something white upon the grass, advanced\r\ntrembling, gave one piercing cry, and fell backward.\r\n\r\nThe wretched Andre was lying in his blood, a cord round his neck as\r\nthough he were a thief, his head crushed in by the height from which he\r\nfell. Then two monks went upstairs to the queen’s room, and respectfully\r\nknocking at the door, asked in sepulchral tones—\r\n\r\n\"Madam, what would you have us do with your husband’s corpse?\"\r\n\r\nAnd when the queen made no answer, they went down again slowly to the\r\ngarden, and kneeling one at the head, the other at the foot of the dead\r\nman, they began to recite penitential psalms in a low voice. When they\r\nhad spent an hour in prayer, two other monks went up in the same way to\r\nJoan’s chamber, repeating the same question and getting no answer,\r\nwhereupon they relieved the first two, and began themselves to pray.\r\nNext a third couple went to the door of this inexorable room, and coming\r\naway perturbed by their want of success, perceived that there was a\r\ndisturbance of people outside the convent, while vengeful cries were\r\nheard amongst the indignant crowd. The groups became more and more\r\nthronged, threatening voices were raised, a torrent of invaders\r\nthreatened the royal dwelling, when the queen’s guard appeared, lance in\r\nreadiness, and a litter closely shut, surrounded by the principal barons\r\nof the court, passed through the crowd, which stood stupidly gazing.\r\nJoan, wrapped in a black veil, went back to Castel Nuovo, amid her\r\nescort; and nobody, say the historians, had the courage to say a word\r\nabout this terrible deed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nThe terrible part that Charles of Durazzo was to play began as soon as\r\nthis crime was accomplished. The duke left the corpse two whole days\r\nexposed to the wind and the rain, unburied and dishonoured, the corpse\r\nof a man whom the pope had made King of Sicily and Jerusalem, so that\r\nthe indignation of the mob might be increased by the dreadful sight. On\r\nthe third he ordered it to be conveyed with the utmost pomp to the\r\ncathedral of Naples, and assembling all the Hungarians around the\r\ncatafalque, he thus addressed them, in a voice of thunder:—\r\n\r\n\"Nobles and commoners, behold our king hanged like a dog by infamous\r\ntraitors. God will soon make known to us the names of all the guilty:\r\nlet those who desire that justice may be done hold up their hands and\r\nswear against murderers bloody persecution, implacable hatred,\r\neverlasting vengeance.\"\r\n\r\nIt was this one man’s cry that brought death and desolation to the\r\nmurderers’ hearts, and the people dispersed about the town, shrieking,\r\n\"Vengeance, vengeance!\"\r\n\r\nDivine justice, which knows naught of privilege and respects no crown,\r\nstruck Joan first of all in her love. When the two lovers first met,\r\nboth were seized alike with terror and disgust; they recoiled trembling,\r\nthe queen seeing in Bertrand her husband’s executioner, and he in her\r\nthe cause of his crime, possibly of his speedy punishment. Bertrand’s\r\nlooks were disordered, his cheeks hollow, his eyes encircled with black\r\nrings, his mouth horribly distorted; his arm and forefinger extended\r\ntowards his accomplice, he seemed to behold a frightful vision rising\r\nbefore him. The same cord he had used when he strangled Andre, he now\r\nsaw round the queen’s neck, so tight that it made its way into her\r\nflesh: an invisible force, a Satanic impulse, urged him to strangle with\r\nhis own hands the woman he had loved so dearly, had at one time adored\r\non his knees. The count rushed out of the room with gestures of\r\ndesperation, muttering incoherent words; and as he shewed plain signs of\r\nmental aberration, his father, Charles of Artois, took him away, and\r\nthey went that same evening to their palace of St. Agatha, and there\r\nprepared a defence in case they should be attacked.\r\n\r\nBut Joan’s punishment, which was destined to be slow as well as\r\ndreadful, to last thirty-seven years and end in a ghastly death, was now\r\nonly beginning. All the wretched beings who were stained with Andre’s\r\ndeath came in turn to her to demand the price of blood. The Catanese and\r\nher son, who held in their hands not only the queen’s honour but her\r\nlife, now became doubly greedy and exacting. Dona Cancha no longer put\r\nany bridle on her licentiousness, and the Empress of Constantinople\r\nordered her niece to marry her eldest son, Robert, Prince of Tarentum.\r\nJoan, consumed by remorse, full of indignation and shame at the arrogant\r\nconduct of her subjects, dared scarcely lift her head, and stooped to\r\nentreaties, only stipulating for a few days’ delay before giving her\r\nanswer: the empress consented, on condition that her son should come to\r\nreside at Castel Nuovo, with permission to see the queen once a day.\r\nJoan bowed her head in silence, and Robert of Tarentum was installed at\r\nthe castle.\r\n\r\nCharles of Durazzo, who by the death of Andre had practically become the\r\nhead of the family, and, would, by the terms of his grandfather’s will,\r\ninherit the kingdom by right of his wife Marie in the case of Joan’s\r\ndying without lawful issue, sent to the queen two commands: first, that\r\nshe should not dream of contracting a new marriage without first\r\nconsulting him in the choice of a husband; secondly, that she should\r\ninvest him at once with the title of Duke of Calabria. To compel his\r\ncousin to make these two concessions, he added that if she should be so\r\nill advised as to refuse either of them, he should hand over to justice\r\nthe proofs of the crime and the names of the murderers. Joan, bending\r\nbeneath the weight of this new difficulty, could think of no way to\r\navoid it; but Catherine, who alone was stout enough to fight this nephew\r\nof hers, insisted that they must strike at the Duke of Durazzo in his\r\nambition and hopes, and tell him, to begin with—what was the fact—that\r\nthe queen was pregnant. If, in spite of this news, he persisted in his\r\nplans, she would find some means or other, she said, of causing trouble\r\nand discord in her nephew’s family, and wounding him in his most\r\nintimate affections or closest interests, by publicly dishonouring him\r\nthrough his wife or his mother.\r\n\r\nCharles smiled coldly when his aunt came to tell him from the queen that\r\nshe was about to bring into the world an infant, Andre’s posthumous\r\nchild. What importance could a babe yet unborn possibly have—as a fact,\r\nit lived only a few months—in the eyes of a man who with such admirable\r\ncoolness got rid of people who stood in his way, and that moreover by\r\nthe hand of his own enemies? He told the empress that the happy news she\r\nhad condescended to bring him in person, far from diminishing his\r\nkindness towards his cousin, inspired him rather with more interest and\r\ngoodwill; that consequently he reiterated his suggestion, and renewed\r\nhis promise not to seek vengeance for his dear Andre, since in a certain\r\nsense the crime was not complete should a child be destined to survive;\r\nbut in case of a refusal he declared himself inexorable. He cleverly\r\ngave Catherine to understand that, as she had some interest herself in\r\nthe prince’s death, she ought for her own sake to persuade the queen to\r\nstop legal proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe empress seemed to be deeply impressed by her nephew’s threatening\r\nattitude, and promised to do her best to persuade the queen to grant all\r\nhe asked, on condition, however, that Charles should allow the necessary\r\ntime for carrying through so delicate a business. But Catherine profited\r\nby this delay to think out her own plan of revenge, and ensure the means\r\nof certain success. After starting several projects eagerly and then\r\nregretfully abandoning them, she fixed upon an infernal and unheard-of\r\nscheme, which the mind would refuse to believe but for the unanimous\r\ntestimony of historians. Poor Agnes of Duras, Charles’s mother, had for\r\nsome few days been suffering with an inexplicable weariness, a slow\r\npainful malady with which her son’s restlessness and violence may have\r\nhad not a little to do. The empress resolved that the first effect of\r\nher hatred was to fall upon this unhappy mother. She summoned the Count\r\nof Terlizzi and Dona Cancha, his mistress, who by the queen’s orders had\r\nbeen attending Agnes since her illness began. Catherine suggested to the\r\nyoung chamberwoman, who was at that time with child, that she should\r\ndeceive the doctor by representing that certain signs of her own\r\ncondition really belonged to the sick woman, so that he, deceived by the\r\nfalse indications, should be compelled to admit to Charles of Durazzo\r\nthat his mother was guilty and dishonoured. The Count of Terlizzi, who\r\never since he had taken part in the regicide trembled in fear of\r\ndiscovery, had nothing to oppose to the empress’s desire, and Dona\r\nCancha, whose head was as light as her heart was corrupt, seized with a\r\nfoolish gaiety on any chance of taking her revenge on the prudery of the\r\nonly princess of the blood who led a pure life at a court that was\r\nrenowned for its depravity. Once assured that her accomplices would be\r\nprudent and obedient, Catherine began to spread abroad certain vague and\r\ndubious but terribly serious rumours, only needing proof, and soon after\r\nthe cruel accusation was started it was repeated again and again in\r\nconfidence, until it reached the ears of Charles.\r\n\r\nAt this amazing revelation the duke was seized with a fit of trembling.\r\nHe sent instantly for the doctor, and asked imperiously what was the\r\ncause of his mother’s malady. The doctor turned pale and stammered; but\r\nwhen Charles grew threatening he admitted that he had certain grounds\r\nfor suspecting that the duchess was enceinte, but as he might easily\r\nhave been deceived the first time, he would make a second investigation\r\nbefore pronouncing his opinion in so serious a matter. The next day, as\r\nthe doctor came out of the bedroom, the duke met him, and interrogating\r\nhim with an agonised gesture, could only judge by the silence that his\r\nfears were too well confirmed. But the doctor, with excess of caution,\r\ndeclared that he would make a third trial. Condemned criminals can\r\nsuffer no worse than Charles in the long hours that passed before that\r\nfatal moment when he learned that his mother was indeed guilty. On the\r\nthird day the doctor stated on his soul and conscience that Agnes of\r\nDurazzo was pregnant.\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" said Charles, dismissing the doctor with no sign of\r\nemotion.\r\n\r\nThat evening the duchess took a medicine ordered by the doctor; and\r\nwhen, half an hour later, she was assailed with violent pains, the duke\r\nwas warned that perhaps other physicians ought to be consulted, as the\r\nprescription of the ordinary doctor, instead of bringing about an\r\nimprovement in her state, had only made her worse.\r\n\r\nCharles slowly went up to the duchess’s room, and sending away all the\r\npeople who were standing round her bed, on the pretext that they were\r\nclumsy and made his mother worse, he shut the door, and they were alone.\r\nThen poor Agnes, forgetting her internal agony when she saw her son,\r\npressed his hand tenderly and smiled through her tears.\r\n\r\nCharles, pale beneath his bronzed complexion, his forehead moist with a\r\ncold sweat, and his eyes horribly dilated, bent over the sick woman and\r\nasked her gloomily—\r\n\r\n\"Are you a little better, mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I am in pain, in frightful pain, my poor Charles. I feel as though\r\nI have molten lead in my veins. O my son, call your brothers, so that I\r\nmay give you all my blessing for the last time, for I cannot hold out\r\nlong against this pain. I am burning. Mercy! Call a doctor: I know I\r\nhave been poisoned.\"\r\n\r\nCharles did not stir from the bedside.\r\n\r\n\"Water!\" cried the dying woman in a broken voice,—\"water! A doctor, a\r\nconfessor! My children—I want my children!\"\r\n\r\nAnd as the duke paid no heed, but stood moodily silent, the poor mother,\r\nprostrated by pain, fancied that grief had robbed her son of all power\r\nof speech or movement, and so, by a desperate effort, sat up, and\r\nseizing him by the arm, cried with all the strength she could muster—\r\n\r\n\"Charles, my son, what is it? My poor boy, courage; it is nothing, I\r\nhope. But quick, call for help, call a doctor. Ah, you have no idea of\r\nwhat I suffer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your doctor,\" said Charles slowly and coldly, each word piercing his\r\nmother’s heart like a dagger,—\"your doctor cannot come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh why?\" asked Agnes, stupefied.\r\n\r\n\"Because no one ought to live who knows the secret of our shame.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unhappy man!\" she cried, overwhelmed with, pain and terror, \"you have\r\nmurdered him! Perhaps you have poisoned your mother too! Charles,\r\nCharles, have mercy on your own soul!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is your doing,\" said Charles, without show of emotion: \"you have\r\ndriven me into crime and despair; you have caused my dishonour in this\r\nworld and my damnation in the next.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you saying? My own Charles, have mercy! Do not let me die in\r\nthis horrible uncertainty; what fatal delusion is blinding you? Speak,\r\nmy son, speak: I am not feeling the poison now. What have I done? Of\r\nwhat have I been accused?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked with haggard eyes at her son: her maternal love still\r\nstruggled against the awful thought of matricide; at last, seeing that\r\nCharles remained speechless in spite of her entreaties, she repeated,\r\nwith a piercing cry—\r\n\r\n\"Speak, in God’s name, speak before I die!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother, you are with child.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" cried Agnes, with a loud cry, which broke her very heart. \"O\r\nGod, forgive him! Charles, your mother forgives and blesses you in\r\ndeath.\"\r\n\r\nCharles fell upon her neck, desperately crying for help: he would now\r\nhave gladly saved her at the cost of his life, but it was too late. He\r\nuttered one cry that came from his heart, and was found stretched out\r\nupon his mother’s corpse.\r\n\r\nStrange comments were made at the court on the death of the Duchess of\r\nDurazzo and her doctor’s disappearance; but there was no doubt at all\r\nthat grief and gloom were furrowing wrinkles on Charles’s brow, which\r\nwas already sad enough. Catherine alone knew the terrible cause of her\r\nnephew’s depression, for to her it was very plain that the duke at one\r\nblow had killed his mother and her physician. But she had never expected\r\na reaction so sudden and violent in a man who shrank before no crime.\r\nShe had thought Charles capable of everything except remorse. His\r\ngloomy, self absorbed silence seemed a bad augury for her plans. She had\r\ndesired to cause trouble for him in his own family, so that he might\r\nhave no time to oppose the marriage of her son with the queen; but she\r\nhad shot beyond her mark, and Charles, started thus on the terrible path\r\nof crime, had now broken through the bonds of his holiest affections,\r\nand gave himself up to his bad passions with feverish ardour and a\r\nsavage desire for revenge. Then Catherine had recourse to gentleness and\r\nsubmission. She gave her son to understand that there was only one way\r\nof obtaining the queen’s hand, and that was by flattering the ambition\r\nof Charles and in some sort submitting himself to his patronage. Robert\r\nof Tarentum understood this, and ceased making court to Joan, who\r\nreceived his devotion with cool kindness, and attached himself closely\r\nto Charles, paying him much the same sort of respect and deference that\r\nhe himself had affected for Andre, when the thought was first in his\r\nmind of causing his ruin. But the Duke of Durazzo was by no means\r\ndeceived as to the devoted friendship shown towards him by the heir of\r\nthe house of Tarentum, and pretending to be deeply touched by the\r\nunexpected change of feeling, he all the time kept a strict guard on\r\nRobert’s actions.\r\n\r\nAn event outside all human foresight occurred to upset the calculations\r\nof the two cousins. One day while they were out together on horseback,\r\nas they often were since their pretended reconciliation, Louis of\r\nTarentum, Robert’s youngest brother, who had always felt for Joan a\r\nchivalrous, innocent love,—a love which a young man of twenty is apt to\r\nlock up in his heart as a secret treasure,—Louis, we say, who had held\r\naloof from the infamous family conspiracy and had not soiled his hands\r\nwith Andre’s blood, drawn on by an irrepressible passion, all at once\r\nappeared at the gates of Castel Nuovo; and while his brother was wasting\r\nprecious hours in asking for a promise of marriage, had the bridge\r\nraised and gave the soldiers strict orders to admit no one. Then, never\r\ntroubling himself about Charles’s anger or Robert’s jealousy, he hurried\r\nto the queen’s room, and there, says Domenico Gravina, without any\r\npreamble, the union was consummated.\r\n\r\nOn returning from his ride, Robert, astonished that the bridge was not\r\nat once lowered for him, at first loudly called upon the soldiers on\r\nguard at the fortress, threatening severe punishment for their\r\nunpardonable negligence; but as the gates did not open and the soldiers\r\nmade no sign of fear or regret, he fell into a violent fit of rage, and\r\nswore he would hang the wretches like dogs for hindering his return\r\nhome. But the Empress of Constantinople, terrified at the bloody quarrel\r\nbeginning between the two brothers, went alone and on foot to her son,\r\nand making use of her maternal authority to beg him to master his\r\nfeelings, there in the presence of the crowd that had come up hastily to\r\nwitness the strange scene, she related in a low voice all that had\r\npassed in his absence.\r\n\r\nA roar as of a wounded tiger escaped from Robert’s breast: all but blind\r\nwith rage, he nearly trampled his mother under the feet of his horse,\r\nwhich seemed to feel his master’s anger, and plunging violently,\r\nbreathed blood from his nostrils. When the prince had poured every\r\npossible execration on his brother’s head, he turned and galloped away\r\nfrom the accursed castle, flying to the Duke of Durazzo, whom he had\r\nonly just left, to tell him of this outrage and stir him to revenge.\r\nCharles was talking carelessly with his young wife, who was but little\r\nused to such tranquil conversation and expansiveness, when the Prince of\r\nTarentum, exhausted, out of breath, bathed in perspiration, came up with\r\nhis incredible tale. Charles made him say it twice over, so impossible\r\ndid Louis’s audacious enterprise appear to him. Then quickly changing\r\nfrom doubt to fury, he struck his brow with his iron glove, saying that\r\nas the queen defied him he would make her tremble even in her castle and\r\nin her lover’s arms. He threw one withering look on Marie, who\r\ninterceded tearfully for her sister, and pressing Robert’s hand with\r\nwarmth, vowed that so long as he lived Louis should never be Joan’s\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\nThat same evening he shut himself up in his study, and wrote letters\r\nwhose effect soon appeared. A bull, dated June 2, 1346, was addressed to\r\nBertram de Baux, chief-justice of the kingdom of Sicily and Count of\r\nMonte Scaglioso, with orders to make the most strict inquiries\r\nconcerning Andre’s murderers, whom the pope likewise laid under his\r\nanathema, and to punish them with the utmost rigour of the law. But a\r\nsecret note was appended to the bull which was quite at variance with\r\nthe designs of Charles: the sovereign pontiff expressly bade the\r\nchief-justice not to implicate the queen in the proceedings or the\r\nprinces of the blood, so as to avoid worse disturbances, reserving, as\r\nsupreme head of the Church and lord of the kingdom, the right of judging\r\nthem later on, as his wisdom might dictate.\r\n\r\nFor this imposing trial Bertram de Baux made great preparations. A\r\nplatform was erected in the great hall of tribunal, and all the officers\r\nof the crown and great state dignitaries, and all the chief barons, had\r\na place behind the enclosure where the magistrates sat. Three days after\r\nClement VI’s bull had been published in the capital, the chief-justice\r\nwas ready for a public examination of two accused persons. The two\r\nculprits who had first fallen into the hands of justice were, as one may\r\neasily suppose, those whose condition was least exalted, whose lives\r\nwere least valuable, Tommaso Pace and Nicholas of Melazzo. They were led\r\nbefore the tribunal to be first of all tortured, as the custom was. As\r\nthey approached the judges, the notary passing by Charles in the street\r\nhad time to say in a low voice—\r\n\r\n\"My lord, the time has come to give my life for you: I will do my duty;\r\nI commend my wife and children to you.\"\r\n\r\nEncouraged by a nod from his patron, he walked on firmly and\r\ndeliberately. The chief-justice, after establishing the identity of the\r\naccused, gave them over to the executioner and his men to be tortured in\r\nthe public square, so that their sufferings might serve as a show and an\r\nexample to the crowd. But no sooner was Tommaso Pace tied to the rope,\r\nwhen to the great disappointment of all he declared that he would\r\nconfess everything, and asked accordingly to be taken back before his\r\njudges. At these words, the Count of Terlizzi, who was following every\r\nmovement of the two men with mortal anxiety, thought it was all over now\r\nwith him and his accomplices; and so, when Tommaso Pace was turning his\r\nsteps towards the great hall, led by two guards, his hands tied behind\r\nhis back, and followed by the notary, he contrived to take him into a\r\nsecluded house, and squeezing his throat with great force, made him thus\r\nput his tongue out, whereupon he cut it off with a sharp razor.\r\n\r\nThe yells of the poor wretch so cruelly mutilated fell on the ears of\r\nthe Duke of Durazzo: he found his way into the room where the barbarous\r\nact had been committed just as the Count of Terlizzi was coming out, and\r\napproached the notary, who had been present at the dreadful spectacle\r\nand had not given the least sign of fear or emotion. Master Nicholas,\r\nthinking the same fate was in store for him, turned calmly to the duke,\r\nsaying with a sad smile—\r\n\r\n\"My lord, the precaution is useless; there is no need for you to cut out\r\nmy tongue, as the noble count has done to my poor companion. The last\r\nscrap of my flesh may be torn off without one word being dragged from my\r\nmouth. I have promised, my lord, and you have the life of my wife and\r\nthe future of my children as guarantee for my word.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not ask for silence,\" said the duke solemnly; \"you can free me\r\nfrom all my enemies at once, and I order you to denounce them at the\r\ntribunal.\"\r\n\r\nThe notary bowed his head with mournful resignation; then raising it in\r\naffright, made one step up to the duke and murmured in a choking voice—\r\n\r\n\"And the queen?\"\r\n\r\n\"No one would believe you if you ventured to denounce her; but when the\r\nCatanese and her son, the Count of Terlizzi and his wife and her most\r\nintimate friends, have been accused by you, when they fail to endure the\r\ntorture, and when they denounce her unanimously—\"\r\n\r\n\"I see, my lord. You do not only want my life; you would have my soul\r\ntoo. Very well; once more I commend to you my children.\"\r\n\r\nWith a deep sigh he walked up to the tribunal. The chief-justice asked\r\nTommaso Pace the usual questions, and a shudder of horror passed through\r\nthe assembly when they saw the poor wretch in desperation opening his\r\nmouth, which streamed with blood. But surprise and terror reached their\r\nheight when Nicholas of Melazzo slowly and firmly gave a list of Andre’s\r\nmurderers, all except the queen and the princes of the blood, and went\r\non to give all details of the assassination.\r\n\r\nProceedings were at once taken for the arrest of the grand seneschal,\r\nRobert of Cabane, and the Counts of Terlizzi and Morcone, who were\r\npresent and had not ventured to make any movement in self-defence. An\r\nhour later, Philippa, her two daughters, and Dona Cancha joined them in\r\nprison, after vainly imploring the queen’s protection. Charles and\r\nBertrand of Artois, shut up in their fortress of Saint Agatha, bade\r\ndefiance to justice, and several others, among them the Counts of Meleto\r\nand Catanzaro, escaped by flight.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Master Nicholas said he had nothing further to confess, and\r\nthat he had spoken the whole truth and nothing but the truth, the\r\nchief-justice pronounced sentence amid a profound silence; and without\r\ndelay Tommaso Pace and the notary were tied to the tails of two horses,\r\ndragged through the chief streets of the town, and hanged in the market\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe other prisoners were thrown into a subterranean vault, to be\r\nquestioned and put to the torture on the following day. In the evening,\r\nfinding themselves in the same dungeon, they reproached one another,\r\neach pretending he had been dragged into the crime by someone else. Then\r\nDona Cancha, whose strange character knew no inconsistencies, even face\r\nto face with death and torture, drowned with a great burst of laughter\r\nthe lamentations of her companions, and joyously exclaimed—\r\n\r\n\"Look here, friends, why these bitter recriminations—this ill-mannered\r\nraving? We have no excuses to make, and we are all equally guilty. I am\r\nthe youngest of all, and not the ugliest, by your leave, ladies, but if\r\nI am condemned, at least I will die cheerfully. For I have never denied\r\nmyself any pleasure I could get in this world, and I can boast that much\r\nwill be forgiven me, for I have loved much: of that you, gentlemen, know\r\nsomething. You, bad old man,\" she continued to the Count of Terlizzi,\r\n\"do you not remember lying by my side in the queen’s ante-chamber? Come,\r\nno blushes before your noble family; confess, my lord, that I am with\r\nchild by your Excellency; and you know how we managed to make up the\r\nstory of poor Agnes of Durazzo and her pregnancy—God rest her soul! For\r\nmy part, I never supposed the joke would take such a serious turn all at\r\nonce. You know all this and much more; spare your lamentations, for, by\r\nmy word, they are getting very tiresome: let us prepare to die joyously,\r\nas we have lived.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words she yawned slightly, and, lying down on the straw, fell\r\ninto a deep sleep, and dreamed as happy dreams as she had ever dreamed\r\nin her life.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow from break of day there was an immense crowd on the sea\r\nfront. During the night an enormous palisade had been put up to keep the\r\npeople away far enough for them to see the accused without hearing\r\nanything. Charles of Durazzo, at the head of a brilliant cortege of\r\nknights and pages, mounted on a magnificent horse, all in black, as a\r\nsign of mourning, waited near the enclosure. Ferocious joy shone in his\r\neyes as the accused made their way through the crowd, two by two, their\r\nwrists tied with ropes; for the duke every minute expected to hear the\r\nqueen’s name spoken. But the chief-justice, a man of experience, had\r\nprevented indiscretion of any kind by fixing a hook in the tongue of\r\neach one. The poor creatures were tortured on a ship, so that nobody\r\nshould hear the terrible confessions their sufferings dragged from them.\r\n\r\nBut Joan, in spite of the wrongs that most of the conspirators had done\r\nher, felt a renewal of pity for the woman she had once respected as a\r\nmother, for her childish companions and her friends, and possibly also\r\nsome remains of love for Robert of Cabane, and sent two messengers to\r\nbeg Bertram de Baux to show mercy to the culprits. But the chief-justice\r\nseized these men and had them tortured; and on their confession that\r\nthey also were implicated in Andre’s murder, he condemned them to the\r\nsame punishment as the others. Dona Cancha alone, by reason of her\r\nsituation, escaped the torture, and her sentence was deferred till the\r\nday of her confinement.\r\n\r\nAs this beautiful girl was returning to prison, with many a smile for\r\nall the handsomest cavaliers she could see in the crowd, she gave a sign\r\nto Charles of Durazzo as she neared him to come forward, and since her\r\ntongue had not been pierced (for the same reason) with an iron\r\ninstrument, she said some words to him a while in a low voice.\r\n\r\nCharles turned fearfully pale, and putting his hand to his sword, cried—\r\n\r\n\"Wretched woman!\"\r\n\r\n\"You forget, my lord, I am under the protection of the law.\"\r\n\r\n\"My mother!—oh, my poor mother!\" murmured Charles in a choked voice, and\r\nhe fell backward.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the people were beforehand with the executioner, loudly\r\ndemanding their prey. All the national troops and mercenaries that the\r\njudicial authorities could command were echelonned in the streets,\r\nopposing a sort of dam to the torrent of the raging crowd. The sudden\r\ninsatiable cruelty that too often degrades human nature had awaked in\r\nthe populace: all heads were turned with hatred and frenzy; all\r\nimaginations inflamed with the passion for revenge; groups of men and\r\nwomen, roaring like wild beasts, threatened to knock down the walls of\r\nthe prison, if the condemned were not handed over to them to take to the\r\nplace of punishment: a great murmur arose, continuous, ever the same,\r\nlike the growling of thunder: the queen’s heart was petrified with\r\nterror.\r\n\r\nBut, in spite of the desire of Bertram de Baux to satisfy the popular\r\nwish, the preparations for the solemn execution were not completed till\r\nmidday, when the sun’s rays fell scorchingly upon the town. There went\r\nup a mighty cry from ten thousand palpitating breasts when a report\r\nfirst ran through the crowd that the prisoners were about to appear.\r\nThere was a moment of silence, and the prison doors rolled slowly back\r\non their hinges with a rusty, grating noise. A triple row of horsemen,\r\nwith lowered visor and lance in rest, started the procession, and amid\r\nyells and curses the condemned prisoners came out one by one, each tied\r\nupon a cart, gagged and naked to the waist, in charge of two\r\nexecutioners, whose orders were to torture them the whole length of\r\ntheir way. On the first cart was the former laundress of Catana,\r\nafterwards wife of the grand seneschal and governess to the queen,\r\nPhilippa of Cabane: the two executioners at right and left of her\r\nscourged her with such fury that the blood spurting up from the wounds\r\nleft a long track in all the streets passed by the cortege.\r\n\r\nImmediately following their mother on separate carts came the Countesses\r\nof Terlizzi and Morcone, the elder no more than eighteen years of age.\r\nThe two sisters were so marvellously beautiful that in the crowd a\r\nmurmur of surprise was heard, and greedy eyes were fixed upon their\r\nnaked trembling shoulders. But the men charged to torture them gazed\r\nwith ferocious smiles upon their forms of seductive beauty, and, armed\r\nwith sharp knives, cut off pieces of their flesh with a deliberate\r\nenjoyment and threw them out to the crowd, who eagerly struggled to get\r\nthem, signing to the executioners to show which part of the victims’\r\nbodies they preferred.\r\n\r\nRobert of Cabane, the grand seneschal, the Counts of Terlizzi and\r\nMorcone, Raymond Pace, brother of the old valet who had been executed\r\nthe day before, and many more, were dragged on similar carts, and both\r\nscourged with ropes and slashed with knives; their flesh was torn out\r\nwith red-hot pincers, and flung upon brazen chafing-dishes. No cry of\r\npain was heard from the grand seneschal, he never stirred once in his\r\nfrightful agony; yet the torturers put such fury into their work that\r\nthe poor wretch was dead before the goal was reached.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the square of Saint Eligius an immense stake was set\r\nup: there the prisoners were taken, and what was left of their mutilated\r\nbodies was thrown into the flames. The Count of Terlizzi and the grand\r\nseneschal’s widow were still alive, and two tears of blood ran down the\r\ncheeks of the miserable mother as she saw her son’s corpse and the\r\npalpitating remains of her two daughters cast upon the fire—they by\r\ntheir stifled cries showed that they had not ceased to suffer. But\r\nsuddenly a fearful noise overpowered the groans of the victims; the\r\nenclosure was broken and overturned by the mob. Like madmen, they rushed\r\nat the burning pile,—armed with sabres, axes, and knives, and snatching\r\nthe bodies dead or alive from the flames, tore them to pieces, carrying\r\noff the bones to make whistles or handles for their daggers as a\r\nsouvenir of this horrible day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spectacle of this frightful punishment did not satisfy the revenge\r\nof Charles of Durazzo. Seconded by the chief-justice, he daily brought\r\nabout fresh executions, till Andre’s death came to be no more than a\r\npretext for the legal murder of all who opposed his projects. But Louis\r\nof Tarentum, who had won Joan’s heart, and was eagerly trying to get the\r\nnecessary dispensation for legalising the marriage, from this time\r\nforward took as a personal insult every act of the high court of justice\r\nwhich was performed against his will and against the queen’s\r\nprerogative: he armed all his adherents, increasing their number by all\r\nthe adventurers he could get together, and so put on foot a strong\r\nenough force to support his own party and resist his cousin. Naples was\r\nthus split up into hostile camps, ready to come to blows on the smallest\r\npretext, whose daily skirmishes, moreover, were always followed by some\r\nscene of pillage or death.\r\n\r\nBut Louis had need of money both to pay his mercenaries and to hold his\r\nown against the Duke of Durazzo and his own brother Robert, and one day\r\nhe discovered that the queen’s coffers were empty. Joan was wretched and\r\ndesperate, and her lover, though generous and brave and anxious to\r\nreassure her so far as he could, did not very clearly see how to\r\nextricate himself from such a difficult situation. But his mother\r\nCatherine, whose ambition was satisfied in seeing one of her sons, no\r\nmatter which, attain to the throne of Naples, came unexpectedly to their\r\naid, promising solemnly that it would only take her a few days to be\r\nable to lay at her niece’s feet a treasure richer than anything she had\r\never dreamed of, queen as she was.\r\n\r\nThe empress then took half her son’s troops, made for Saint Agatha, and\r\nbesieged the fortress where Charles and Bertrand of Artois had taken\r\nrefuge when they fled from justice. The old count, astonished at the\r\nsight of this woman, who had been the very soul of the conspiracy, and\r\nnot in the least understanding her arrival as an enemy, sent out to ask\r\nthe intention of this display of military force. To which Catherine\r\nreplied in words which we translate literally:\r\n\r\n\"My friends, tell Charles, our faithful friend, that we desire to speak\r\nwith him privately and alone concerning a matter equally interesting to\r\nus both, and he is not to be alarmed at our arriving in the guise of an\r\nenemy, for this we have done designedly, as we shall explain in the\r\ncourse of our interview. We know he is confined to bed by the gout, and\r\ntherefore feel no surprise at his not coming out to meet us. Have the\r\ngoodness to salute him on our part and reassure him, telling him that we\r\ndesire to come in, if such is his good pleasure, with our intimate\r\ncounsellor, Nicholas Acciajuoli, and ten soldiers only, to speak with\r\nhim concerning an important matter that cannot be entrusted to\r\ngo-betweens.\"\r\n\r\nEntirely reassured by these frank, friendly explanations, Charles of\r\nArtois sent out his son Bertrand to the empress to receive her with the\r\nrespect due to her rank and high position at the court of Naples.\r\nCatherine went promptly to the castle with many signs of joy, and\r\ninquiring after the count’s health and expressing her affection, as soon\r\nas they were alone, she mysteriously lowered her voice and explained\r\nthat the object of her visit was to consult a man of tried experience on\r\nthe affairs of Naples, and to beg his active cooperation in the queen’s\r\nfavour. As, however, she was not pressed for time, she could wait at\r\nSaint Agatha for the count’s recovery to hear his views and tell him of\r\nthe march of events since he left the court. She succeeded so well in\r\ngaining the old man’s confidence and banishing his suspicions, that he\r\nbegged her to honour them with her presence as long as she was able, and\r\nlittle by little received all her men within the walls. This was what\r\nCatherine was waiting for: on the very day when her army was installed\r\nat Saint Agatha, she suddenly entered the count’s room, followed by four\r\nsoldiers, and seizing the old man by the throat, exclaimed wrathfully—\r\n\r\n\"Miserable traitor, you will not escape from our hands before you have\r\nreceived the punishment you deserve. In the meanwhile, show me where\r\nyour treasure is hidden, if you would not have me throw your body out to\r\nfeed the crows that are swooping around these dungeons.\"\r\n\r\nThe count, half choking, the dagger at his breast, did not even attempt\r\nto call for help; he fell on his knees, begging the empress to save at\r\nleast the life of his son, who was not yet well from the terrible attack\r\nof melancholia that had shaken his reason ever since the catastrophe.\r\nThen he painfully dragged himself to the place where he had hidden his\r\ntreasure, and pointing with his finger, cried—\r\n\r\n\"Take all; take my life; but spare my son.\"\r\n\r\nCatherine could not contain herself for joy when she saw spread out at\r\nher feet exquisite and incredibly valuable cups, caskets of pearls,\r\ndiamonds and rubies of marvellous value, coffers full of gold ingots,\r\nand all the wonders of Asia that surpass the wildest imagination. But\r\nwhen the old man, trembling, begged for the liberty of his son as the\r\nprice of his fortune and his own life, the empress resumed her cold,\r\npitiless manner, and harshly replied—\r\n\r\n\"I have already given orders for your son to be brought here; but\r\nprepare for an eternal farewell, for he is to be taken to the fortress\r\nof Melfi, and you in all probability will end your days beneath the\r\ncastle of Saint Agatha.\"\r\n\r\nThe grief of the poor count at this violent separation was so great,\r\nthat a few days later he was found dead in his dungeon, his lips covered\r\nwith a bloody froth, his hands gnawed in despair. Bertrand did not long\r\nsurvive him. He actually lost his reason when he heard of his father’s\r\ndeath, and hanged himself on the prison grating. Thus did the murderers\r\nof Andre destroy one another, like venomous animals shut up in the same\r\ncage.\r\n\r\nCatherine of Tarentum, carrying off the treasure she had so gained,\r\narrived at the court of Naples, proud of her triumph and contemplating\r\nvast schemes. But new troubles had come about in her absence. Charles of\r\nDurazzo, for the last time desiring the queen to give him the duchy of\r\nCalabria, a title which had always belonged to the heir presumptive, and\r\nangered by her refusal, had written to Louis of Hungary, inviting him to\r\ntake possession of the kingdom, and promising to help in the enterprise\r\nwith all his own forces, and to give up the principal authors of his\r\nbrother’s death, who till now had escaped justice.\r\n\r\nThe King of Hungary eagerly accepted these offers, and got ready an army\r\nto avenge Andre’s death and proceed to the conquest of Naples. The tears\r\nof his mother Elizabeth and the advice of Friar Robert, the old\r\nminister, who had fled to Buda, confirmed him in his projects of\r\nvengeance. He had already lodged a bitter complaint at the court of\r\nAvignon that, while the inferior assassins had been punished, she who\r\nwas above all others guilty had been shamefully let off scot free, and\r\nthough still stained with her husband’s blood, continued to live a life\r\nof debauchery and adultery. The pope replied soothingly that, so far as\r\nit depended upon him, he would not be found slow to give satisfaction to\r\na lawful grievance; but the accusation ought to be properly formulated\r\nand supported by proof; that no doubt Joan’s conduct during and after\r\nher husband’s death was blamable; but His Majesty must consider that the\r\nChurch of Rome, which before all things seeks truth and justice, always\r\nproceeds with the utmost circumspection, and in so grave a matter more\r\nespecially must not judge by appearances only.\r\n\r\nJoan, frightened by the preparations for war, sent ambassadors to the\r\nFlorentine Republic, to assert her innocence of the crime imputed to her\r\nby public opinion, and did not hesitate to send excuses even to the\r\nHungarian court; but Andre’s brother replied in a letter laconic and\r\nthreatening:—\r\n\r\n\"Your former disorderly life, the arrogation to yourself of exclusive\r\npower, your neglect to punish your husband’s murderers, your marriage to\r\nanother husband, moreover your own excuses, are all sufficient proofs\r\nthat you were an accomplice in the murder.\"\r\n\r\nCatherine would not be put out of heart by the King of Hungary’s\r\nthreats, and looking at the position of the queen and her son with a\r\ncoolness that was never deceived, she was convinced that there was no\r\nother means of safety except a reconciliation with Charles, their mortal\r\nfoe, which could only be brought about by giving him all he wanted. It\r\nwas one of two things: either he would help them to repulse the King of\r\nHungary, and later on they would pay the cost when the dangers were less\r\npressing, or he would be beaten himself, and thus they would at least\r\nhave the pleasure of drawing him down with them in their own\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nThe agreement was made in the gardens of Castel Nuovo, whither Charles\r\nhad repaired on the invitation of the queen and her aunt. To her cousin\r\nof Durazzo Joan accorded the title so much desired of Duke of Calabria,\r\nand Charles, feeling that he was hereby made heir to the kingdom,\r\nmarched at once on Aquila, which town already was flying the Hungarian\r\ncolours. The wretched man did not foresee that he was going straight to\r\nhis destruction.\r\n\r\nWhen the Empress of Constantinople saw this man, whom she hated above\r\nall others, depart in joy, she looked contemptuously upon him, divining\r\nby a woman’s instinct that mischief would befall him; then, having no\r\nfurther mischief to do, no further treachery on earth, no further\r\nrevenge to satisfy, she all at once succumbed to some unknown malady,\r\nand died suddenly, without uttering a cry or exciting a single regret.\r\n\r\nBut the King of Hungary, who had crossed Italy with a formidable army,\r\nnow entered the kingdom from the side of Aquila: on his way he had\r\neverywhere received marks of interest and sympathy; and Alberto and\r\nMertino delta Scala, lords of Verona, had given him three hundred horse\r\nto prove that all their goodwill was with him in his enterprise. The\r\nnews of the arrival of the Hungarians threw the court into a state of\r\nconfusion impossible to describe. They had hoped that the king would be\r\nstopped by the pope’s legate, who had come to Foligno to forbid him, in\r\nthe name of the Holy Father, and on pain of excommunication to proceed\r\nany further without his consent; but Louis of Hungary replied to the\r\npope’s legate that, once master of Naples, he should consider himself a\r\nfeudatory of the Church, but till then he had no obligations except to\r\nGod and his own conscience. Thus the avenging army fell like a\r\nthunderbolt upon the heart of the kingdom, before there was any thought\r\nof taking serious measures for defence. There was only one plan\r\npossible: the queen assembled the barons who were most strongly attached\r\nto her, made them swear homage and fidelity to Louis of Tarentum, whom\r\nshe presented to them as her husband, and then leaving with many tears\r\nher most faithful subjects, she embarked secretly, in the middle of the\r\nnight, on a ship of Provence, and made for Marseilles. Louis of\r\nTarentum, following the prompting of his adventure-loving character,\r\nleft Naples at the head of three thousand horse and a considerable\r\nnumber of foot, and took up his post on the banks of the Voltorno, there\r\nto contest the enemy’s passage; but the King of Hungary foresaw the\r\nstratagem, and while his adversary was waiting for him at Capua, he\r\narrived at Beneventum by the mountains of Alife and Morcone, and on the\r\nsame day received Neapolitan envoys: they in a magnificent display of\r\neloquence congratulated him on his entrance, offered the keys of the\r\ntown, and swore obedience to him as being the legitimate successor of\r\nCharles of Anjou. The news of the surrender of Naples soon reached the\r\nqueen’s camp, and all the princes of the blood and the generals left\r\nLouis of Tarentum and took refuge in the capital. Resistance was\r\nimpossible. Louis, accompanied by his counsellor, Nicholas Acciajuoli,\r\nwent to Naples on the same evening on which his relatives quitted the\r\ntown to get away from the enemy. Every hope of safety was vanishing as\r\nthe hours passed by; his brothers and cousins begged him to go at once,\r\nso as not to draw down upon the town the king’s vengeance, but unluckily\r\nthere was no ship in the harbour that was ready to set sail. The terror\r\nof the princes was at its height; but Louis, trusting in his luck,\r\nstarted with the brave Acciajuoli in an unseaworthy boat, and ordering\r\nfour sailors to row with all their might, in a few minutes disappeared,\r\nleaving his family in a great state of anxiety till they learned that he\r\nhad reached Pisa, whither he had gone to join the queen in Provence.\r\nCharles of Durazzo and Robert of Tarentum, who were the eldest\r\nrespectively of the two branches of the royal family, after hastily\r\nconsulting, decided to soften the Hungarian monarch’s wrath by a\r\ncomplete submission. Leaving their young brothers at Naples, they\r\naccordingly set off for Aversa, where the king was. Louis received them\r\nwith every mark of friendship, and asked with much interest why their\r\nbrothers were not with them. The princes replied that their young\r\nbrothers had stayed at Naples to prepare a worthy reception for His\r\nMajesty. Louis thanked them for their kind intentions, but begged them\r\nto invite the young princes now, saying that it would be infinitely more\r\npleasant to enter Naples with all his family, and that he was most\r\nanxious to see his cousins. Charles and Robert, to please the king, sent\r\nequerries to bid their brothers come to Aversa; but Louis of Durazzo,\r\nthe eldest of the boys, with many tears begged the others not to obey,\r\nand sent a message that he was prevented by a violent headache from\r\nleaving Naples. So puerile an excuse could not fail to annoy Charles,\r\nand the same day he compelled the unfortunate boys to appear before the\r\nking, sending a formal order which admitted of no delay. Louis of\r\nHungary embraced them warmly one after the other, asked them several\r\nquestions in an affectionate way, kept them to supper, and only let them\r\ngo quite late at night.\r\n\r\nWhen the Duke of Durazzo reached his room, Lello of Aquila and the Count\r\nof Fondi slipped mysteriously to the side of his bed, and making sure\r\nthat no one could hear, told him that the king in a council held that\r\nmorning had decided to kill him and to imprison the other princes.\r\nCharles heard them out, but incredulously: suspecting treachery, he\r\ndryly replied that he had too much confidence in his cousin’s loyalty to\r\nbelieve such a black calumny. Lello insisted, begging him in the name of\r\nhis dearest friends to listen; but the duke was impatient, and harshly\r\nordered him to depart.\r\n\r\nThe next day there was the same kindness on the king’s part, the same\r\naffection shown to the children, the same invitation to supper. The\r\nbanquet was magnificent; the room was brilliantly lighted, and the\r\nreflections were dazzling: vessels of gold shone on the table; the\r\nintoxicating perfume of flowers filled the air; wine foamed in the\r\ngoblets and flowed from the flagons in ruby streams; conversation,\r\nexcited and discursive, was heard on every side; all faces beamed with\r\njoy.\r\n\r\nCharles of Durazzo sat opposite the king, at a separate table among his\r\nbrothers. Little by little his look grew fixed, his brow pensive. He was\r\nfancying that Andre might have supped in this very hall on the eve of\r\nhis tragic end, and he thought how all concerned in that death had\r\neither died in torment or were now languishing in prison; the queen, an\r\nexile and a fugitive, was begging pity from strangers: he alone was\r\nfree. The thought made him tremble; but admiring his own cleverness in\r\npursuing his infernal schemes, and putting away his sad looks, he smiled\r\nagain with an expression of indefinable pride. The madman at this moment\r\nwas scoffing at the justice of God. But Lello of Aquila, who was waiting\r\nat the table, bent down, whispering gloomily—\r\n\r\n\"Unhappy duke, why did you refuse to believe me? Fly, while there is yet\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nCharles, angered by the man’s obstinacy, threatened that if he were such\r\na fool as to say any more, he would repeat every word aloud.\r\n\r\n\"I have done my duty,\" murmured Lello, bowing his head; \"now it must\r\nhappen as God wills.\"\r\n\r\nAs he left off speaking, the king rose, and as the duke went up to take\r\nhis leave, his face suddenly changed, and he cried in an awful voice—\r\n\r\n\"Traitor! At length you are in my hands, and you shall die as you\r\ndeserve; but before you are handed over to the executioner, confess with\r\nyour own lips your deeds of treachery towards our royal majesty: so\r\nshall we need no other witness to condemn you to a punishment\r\nproportioned to your crimes. Between our two selves, Duke of Durazzo,\r\ntell me first why, by your infamous manoeuvring, you aided your uncle,\r\nthe Cardinal of Perigord, to hinder the coronation of my brother, and so\r\nled him on, since he had no royal prerogative of his own, to his\r\nmiserable end? Oh, make no attempt to deny it. Here is the letter sealed\r\nwith your seal; in secret you wrote it, but it accuses you in public.\r\nThen why, after bringing us hither to avenge our brother’s death, of\r\nwhich you beyond all doubt were the cause,—why did you suddenly turn to\r\nthe queen’s party and march against our town of Aquila, daring to raise\r\nan army against our faithful subjects? You hoped, traitor, to make use\r\nof us as a footstool to mount the throne withal, as soon as you were\r\nfree from every other rival. Then you would but have awaited our\r\ndeparture to kill the viceroy we should have left in our place, and so\r\nseize the kingdom. But this time your foresight has been at fault. There\r\nis yet another crime worse than all the rest, a crime of high treason,\r\nwhich I shall remorselessly punish. You carried off the bride that our\r\nancestor King Robert designed for me, as you knew, by his will. Answer,\r\nwretch what excuse can you make for the rape of the Princess Marie?\"\r\n\r\nAnger had so changed Louis’s voice that the last words sounded like the\r\nroar of a wild beast: his eyes glittered with a feverish light, his lips\r\nwere pale and trembling. Charles and his brothers fell upon their knees,\r\nfrozen by mortal terror, and the unhappy duke twice tried to speak, but\r\nhis teeth were chattering so violently that he could not articulate a\r\nsingle word. At last, casting his eyes about him and seeing his poor\r\nbrothers, innocent and ruined by his fault, he regained some sort of\r\ncourage, and said—\r\n\r\n\"My lord, you look upon me with a terrible countenance that makes me\r\ntremble. But on my knees I entreat you, have mercy on me if I have done\r\nwrong, for God is my witness that I did not call you to this kingdom\r\nwith any criminal intention: I have always desired, and still desire,\r\nyour supremacy in all the sincerity of my soul. Some treacherous\r\ncounsellors, I am certain, have contrived to draw down your hatred upon\r\nme. If it is true, as you say, that I went with an armed force to Aquila\r\nI was compelled by Queen Joan, and I could not do otherwise; but as soon\r\nas I heard of your arrival at Fermo I took my troops away again. I hope\r\nfor the love of Christ I may obtain your mercy and pardon, by reason of\r\nmy former services and constant loyalty. But as I see you are now angry\r\nwith me, I say no more waiting for your fury to pass over. Once again,\r\nmy lord, have pity upon us, since we are in the hands of your Majesty.\"\r\n\r\nThe king turned away his head, and retired slowly, confiding the\r\nprisoners to the care of Stephen Vayvoda and the Count of Zornic, who\r\nguarded them during the night in a room adjoining the king’s chamber.\r\nThe next day Louis held another meeting of his council, and ordered that\r\nCharles should have his throat cut on the very spot where poor Andre had\r\nbeen hanged. He then sent the other princes of the blood, loaded with\r\nchains, to Hungary, where they were long kept prisoners. Charles, quite\r\nthunderstruck by such an unexpected blow, overwhelmed by the thought of\r\nhis past crimes, trembled like a coward face to face with death, and\r\nseemed completely crushed. Bowed, upon his knees, his face half hidden\r\nin his hands, from time to time convulsive sobs escaped him, as he tried\r\nto fix the thoughts that chased each other through his mind like the\r\nshapes of a monstrous dream. Night was in his soul, but every now and\r\nthen light flashed across the darkness, and over the gloomy background\r\nof his despair passed gilded figures fleeing from him with smiles of\r\nmockery. In his ears buzzed voices from the other world; he saw a long\r\nprocession of ghosts, like the conspirators whom Nicholas of Melazzo had\r\npointed out in the vaults of Castel Nuovo. But these phantoms each held\r\nhis head in his hand, and shaking it by the hair, bespattered him with\r\ndrops of blood. Some brandished whips, some knives: each threatened\r\nCharles with his instrument of torture. Pursued by the nocturnal train,\r\nthe hapless man opened his mouth for one mighty cry, but his breath was\r\ngone, and it died upon his lips. Then he beheld his mother stretching\r\nout her arms from afar, and he fancied that if he could but reach her he\r\nwould be safe. But at each step the path grew more and more narrow,\r\npieces of his flesh were torn off by the approaching walls; at last,\r\nbreathless, naked and bleeding, he reached his goal; but his mother\r\nglided farther away, and it was all to begin over again. The phantoms\r\npursued him, grinning and screaming in his ears:—\r\n\r\n\"Cursed be he who slayeth his mother!\"\r\n\r\nCharles was roused from these horrors by the cries of his brothers, who\r\nhad come to embrace him for the last time before embarking. The duke in\r\na low voice asked their pardon, and then fell back into his state of\r\ndespair. The children were dragged away, begging to be allowed to share\r\ntheir brother’s fate, and crying for death as an alleviation of their\r\nwoes. At length they were separated, but the sound of their lamentation\r\nsounded long in the heart of the condemned man. After a few moments, two\r\nsoldiers and two equerries came to tell the duke that his hour had come.\r\n\r\nCharles followed them, unresisting, to the fatal balcony where Andre had\r\nbeen hanged. He was there asked if he desired to confess, and when he\r\nsaid yes, they brought a monk from the sane convent where the terrible\r\nscene had been enacted: he listened to the confession of all his sins,\r\nand granted him absolution. The duke at once rose and walked to the\r\nplace where Andre had been thrown down for the cord to be put round his\r\nneck, and there, kneeling again, he asked his executioners—\r\n\r\n\"Friends, in pity tell me, is there any hope for my life?\"\r\n\r\nAnd when they answered no, Charles exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Then carry out your instructions.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words, one of the equerries plunged his sword into his breast,\r\nand the other cut his head off with a knife, and his corpse was thrown\r\nover the balcony into the garden where Andre’s body had lain for three\r\ndays unburied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe King of Hungary, his black flag ever borne before him, started for\r\nNaples, refusing all offered honours, and rejecting the canopy beneath\r\nwhich he was to make his entry, not even stopping to give audience to\r\nthe chief citizens or to receive the acclamations of the crowd. Armed at\r\nall points, he made for Castel Nuovo, leaving behind him dismay and\r\nfear. His first act on entering the city was to order Dona Cancha to be\r\nburnt, her punishment having been deferred by reason of her pregnancy.\r\nLike the others, she was drawn on a cart to the square of St. Eligius,\r\nand there consigned to the flames. The young creature, whose suffering\r\nhad not impaired her beauty, was dressed as for a festival, and laughing\r\nlike a mad thing up to the last moment, mocked at her executioners and\r\nthrew kisses to the crowd.\r\n\r\nA few days later, Godfrey of Marsana, Count of Squillace and grand\r\nadmiral of the kingdom, was arrested by the king’s orders. His life was\r\npromised him on condition of his delivering up Conrad of Catanzaro, one\r\nof his relatives, accused of conspiring against Andre. The grand admiral\r\ncommitted this act of shameless treachery, and did not shrink from\r\nsending his own son to persuade Conrad to come to the town. The poor\r\nwretch was given over to the king, and tortured alive on a wheel made\r\nwith sharp knives. The sight of these barbarities, far from calming the\r\nking’s rage, seemed to inflame it the more. Every day there were new\r\naccusations and new sentences. The prisons were crowded: Louis’s\r\npunishments were redoubled in severity. A fear arose that the town, and\r\nindeed the whole kingdom, were to be treated as having taken part in\r\nAndre’s death. Murmurs arose against this barbarous rule, and all men’s\r\nthoughts turned towards their fugitive queen. The Neapolitan barons had\r\ntaken the oath of fidelity with no willing hearts; and when it came to\r\nthe turn of the Counts of San Severino, they feared a trick of some\r\nkind, and refused to appear all together before the Hungarian, but took\r\nrefuge in the town of Salerno, and sent Archbishop Roger, their brother,\r\nto make sure of the king’s intentions beforehand. Louis received him\r\nmagnificently, and appointed him privy councillor and grand proto\r\nnotary. Then, and not till then, did Robert of San Severino and Roger,\r\nCount of Chiaramonte, venture into the king’s presence; after doing\r\nhomage, they retired to their homes. The other barons followed their\r\nexample of caution, and hiding their discontent under a show of respect,\r\nawaited a favourable moment for shaking off the foreign yoke. But the\r\nqueen had encountered no obstacle in her flight, and arrived at Nice\r\nfive days later. Her passage through Provence was like a triumph. Her\r\nbeauty, youth, and misfortunes, even certain mysterious reports as to\r\nher adventures, all contributed to arouse the interest of the Provencal\r\npeople. Games and fetes were improvised to soften the hardship of exile\r\nfor the proscribed princess; but amid the outbursts of joy from every\r\ntown, castle, and city, Joan, always sad, lived ever in her silent grief\r\nand glowing memories.\r\n\r\nAt the gates of Aix she found the clergy, the nobility, and the chief\r\nmagistrates, who received her respectfully but with no signs of\r\nenthusiasm. As the queen advanced, her astonishment increased as she saw\r\nthe coldness of the people and the solemn, constrained air of the great\r\nmen who escorted her. Many anxious thoughts alarmed her, and she even\r\nwent so far as to fear some intrigue of the King of Hungary. Scarcely\r\nhad her cortege arrived at Castle Arnaud, when the nobles, dividing into\r\ntwo ranks, let the queen pass with her counsellor Spinelli and two\r\nwomen; then closing up, they cut her off from the rest of her suite.\r\nAfter this, each in turn took up his station as guardian of the\r\nfortress.\r\n\r\nThere was no room for doubt: the queen was a prisoner; but the cause of\r\nthe manoeuvre it was impossible to guess. She asked the high\r\ndignitaries, and they, protesting respectful devotion, refused to\r\nexplain till they had news from Avignon. Meanwhile all honours that a\r\nqueen could receive were lavished on Joan; but she was kept in sight and\r\nforbidden to go out. This new trouble increased her depression: she did\r\nnot know what had happened to Louis of Tarentum, and her imagination,\r\nalways apt at creating disasters, instantly suggested that she would\r\nsoon be weeping for his loss.\r\n\r\nBut Louis, always with his faithful Acciajuoli, had after many fatiguing\r\nadventures been shipwrecked at the port of Pisa; thence he had taken\r\nroute for Florence, to beg men and money; but the Florentines decided to\r\nkeep an absolute neutrality, and refused to receive him. The prince,\r\nlosing his last hope, was pondering gloomy plans, when Nicholas\r\nAcciajuoli thus resolutely addressed him:\r\n\r\n\"My lord, it is not given to mankind to enjoy prosperity for ever: there\r\nare misfortunes beyond all human foresight. You were once rich and\r\npowerful, and you are now a fugitive in disguise, begging the help of\r\nothers. You must reserve your strength for better days. I still have a\r\nconsiderable fortune, and also have relations and friends whose wealth\r\nis at my disposal: let us try to make our way to the queen, and at once\r\ndecide what we can do. I myself shall always defend you and obey you as\r\nmy lord and master.\"\r\n\r\nThe prince received these generous offers with the utmost gratitude, and\r\ntold his counsellor that he placed his person in his hands and all that\r\nremained of his future. Acciajuoli, not content with serving his master\r\nas a devoted servant, persuaded his brother Angelo, Archbishop of\r\nFlorence, who was in great favour at Clement VI’s court, to join with\r\nthem in persuading the pope to interest himself in the cause of Louis of\r\nTarentum. So, without further delay, the prince, his counsellor, and the\r\ngood prelate made their way to the port of Marseilles, but learning that\r\nthe queen was a prisoner at Aix, they embarked at Acque-Morte, and went\r\nstraight to Avignon. It soon appeared that the pope had a real affection\r\nand esteem for the character of the Archbishop of Florence, for Louis\r\nwas received with paternal kindness at the court of Avignon; which was\r\nfar more than he had expected: when he kneeled before the sovereign\r\npontiff, His Holiness bent affectionately towards him and helped him to\r\nrise, saluting him by the title of king.\r\n\r\nTwo days later, another prelate, the Archbishop of Aix, came into the\r\nqueen’s presence,—\r\n\r\n\"Most gracious and dearly beloved sovereign, permit the most humble and\r\ndevoted of your servants to ask pardon, in the name of your subjects,\r\nfor the painful but necessary measure they have thought fit to take\r\nconcerning your Majesty. When you arrived on our coast, your loyal town\r\nof Aix had learned from a trustworthy source that the King of France was\r\nproposing to give our country to one of his own sons, making good this\r\nloss to you by the cession of another domain, also that the Duke of\r\nNormandy had come to Avignon to request this exchange in person. We were\r\nquite decided, madam, and had made a vow to God that we would give up\r\neverything rather than suffer the hateful tyranny of the French. But\r\nbefore spilling blood we thought it best to secure your august person as\r\na sacred hostage, a sacred ark which no man dared touch but was smitten\r\nto the ground, which indeed must keep away from our walls the scourge of\r\nwar. We have now read the formal annulment of this hateful plan, in a\r\nbrief sent by the sovereign pontiff from Avignon; and in this brief he\r\nhimself guarantees your good faith.\r\n\r\n\"We give you your full and entire liberty, and henceforth we shall only\r\nendeavour to keep you among us by prayers and protestations. Go then,\r\nmadam, if that is your pleasure, but before you leave these lands, which\r\nwill be plunged into mourning by your withdrawal, leave with us some\r\nhope that you forgive the apparent violence to which we have subjected\r\nyou, only in the fear that we might lose you; and remember that on the\r\nday when you cease to be our queen you sign the death-warrant of all\r\nyour subjects.\"\r\n\r\nJoan reassured the archbishop and the deputation from her good town of\r\nAix with a melancholy smile, and promised that she would always cherish\r\nthe memory of their affection. For this time she could not be deceived\r\nas to the real sentiments of the nobles and people; and a fidelity so\r\nuncommon, revealed with sincere tears, touched her heart and made her\r\nreflect bitterly upon her past. But a league’s distance from Avignon a\r\nmagnificent triumphal reception awaited her. Louis of Tarentum and all\r\nthe cardinals present at the court had come out to meet her. Pages in\r\ndazzling dress carried above Joan’s head a canopy of scarlet velvet,\r\nornamented with fleur-de-lys in gold and plumes. Handsome youths and\r\nlovely girls, their heads crowned with flowers, went before her singing\r\nher praise. The streets were bordered with a living hedge of people; the\r\nhouses were decked out; the bells rang a triple peal, as at the great\r\nChurch festivals. Clement VI first received the queen at the castle of\r\nAvignon with all the pomp he knew so well how to employ on solemn\r\noccasions, then she was lodged in the palace of Cardinal Napoleon of the\r\nOrsini, who on his return from the Conclave at Perugia had built this\r\nregal dwelling at Villeneuve, inhabited later by the popes.\r\n\r\nNo words could give an idea of the strangely disturbed condition of\r\nAvignon at this period. Since Clement V had transported the seat of the\r\npapacy to Provence, there had sprung up, in this rival to Rome, squares,\r\nchurches, cardinals’ palaces, of unparalleled splendour. All the\r\nbusiness of nations and kings was transacted at the castle of Avignon.\r\nAmbassadors from every court, merchants of every nation, adventurers of\r\nall kinds, Italians, Spaniards, Hungarians, Arabs, Jews, soldiers,\r\nBohemians, jesters, poets, monks, courtesans, swarmed and clustered\r\nhere, and hustled one another in the streets. There was confusion of\r\ntongues, customs, and costumes, an inextricable mixture of splendour and\r\nrags, riches and misery, debasement and grandeur. The austere poets of\r\nthe Middle Ages stigmatised the accursed city in their writings under\r\nthe name of the New Babylon.\r\n\r\nThere is one curious monument of Joan’s sojourn at Avignon and the\r\nexercise of her authority as sovereign. She was indignant at the\r\neffrontery of the women of the town, who elbowed everybody shamelessly\r\nin the streets, and published a notable edict, the first of its kind,\r\nwhich has since served as a model in like cases, to compel all\r\nunfortunate women who trafficked in their honour to live shut up\r\ntogether in a house, that was bound to be open every day in the year\r\nexcept the last three days of Holy Week, the entrance to be barred to\r\nJews at all times. An abbess, chosen once a year, had the supreme\r\ncontrol over this strange convent. Rules were established for the\r\nmaintenance of order, and severe penalties inflicted for any\r\ninfringement of discipline. The lawyers of the period gained a great\r\nreputation by this salutary institution; the fair ladies of Avignon were\r\neager in their defence of the queen in spite of the calumnious reports\r\nthat strove to tarnish her reputation: with one voice the wisdom of\r\nAndre’s widow was extolled. The concert of praises was disturbed,\r\nhowever, by murmurs from the recluses themselves, who, in their own\r\nbrutal language, declared that Joan of Naples was impeding their\r\ncommerce so as to get a monopoly for herself.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Marie of Durazzo had joined her sister. After her husband’s\r\ndeath she had found means to take refuge in the convent of Santa Croce\r\nwith her two little daughters; and while Louis of Hungary was busy\r\nburning his victims, the unhappy Marie had contrived to make her escape\r\nin the frock of an old monk, and as by a miracle to get on board a ship\r\nthat was setting sail for Provence. She related to her sister the\r\nfrightful details of the king’s cruelty. And soon a new proof of his\r\nimplacable hatred confirmed the tales of the poor princess.\r\n\r\nLouis’s ambassadors appeared at the court of Avignon to demand formally\r\nthe queen’s condemnation.\r\n\r\nIt was a great day when Joan of Naples pleaded her own cause before the\r\npope, in the presence of all the cardinals then at Avignon, all the\r\nambassadors of foreign powers, and all the eminent persons come from\r\nevery quarter of Europe to be present at this trial, unique in the\r\nannals of history. We must imagine a vast enclosure, in whose midst upon\r\na raised throne, as president of the august tribunal, sat God’s vicar on\r\nearth, absolute and supreme judge, emblem of temporal and spiritual\r\npower, of authority human and divine. To right and left of the sovereign\r\npontiff, the cardinals in their red robes sat in chairs set round in a\r\ncircle, and behind these princes of the Sacred College stretched rows of\r\nbishops extending to the end of the hall, with vicars, canons, deacons,\r\narchdeacons, and the whole immense hierarchy of the Church. Facing the\r\npontifical throne was a platform reserved for the Queen of Naples and\r\nher suite. At the pope’s feet stood the ambassadors from the King of\r\nHungary, who played the part of accusers without speaking a word, the\r\ncircumstances of the crime and all the proofs having been discussed\r\nbeforehand by a committee appointed for the purpose. The rest of the\r\nhall was filled by a brilliant crowd of high dignitaries, illustrious\r\ncaptains, and noble envoys, all vying with one another in proud display.\r\nEveryone ceased to breathe, all eyes were fixed on the dais whence Joan\r\nwas to speak her own defence. A movement of uneasy curiosity made this\r\ncompact mass of humanity surge towards the centre, the cardinals above\r\nraised like proud peacocks over a golden harvest-field shaken in the\r\nbreeze.\r\n\r\nThe queen appeared, hand in hand with her uncle, the old Cardinal of\r\nPerigord, and her aunt, the Countess Agnes. Her gait was so modest and\r\nproud, her countenance so melancholy and pure, her looks so open and\r\nconfident, that even before she spoke every heart was hers. Joan was now\r\ntwenty years of age; her magnificent beauty was fully developed, but an\r\nextreme pallor concealed the brilliance of her transparent satin skin,\r\nand her hollow cheek told the tale of expiation and suffering. Among the\r\nspectators who looked on most eagerly there was a certain young man with\r\nstrongly marked features, glowing eyes, and brown hair, whom we shall\r\nmeet again later on in our narrative; but we will not divert our\r\nreaders’ attention, but only tell them that his name was James of\r\nAragon, that he was Prince of Majorca, and would have been ready to shed\r\nevery drop of his blood only to check one single tear that hung on\r\nJoan’s eyelids. The queen spoke in an agitated, trembling voice,\r\nstopping from time to time to dry her moist and shining eyes, or to\r\nbreathe one of those deep sighs that go straight to the heart. She told\r\nthe tale of her husband’s death painfully and vividly, painted\r\ntruthfully the mad terror that had seized upon her and struck her down\r\nat that frightful time, raised her hands to her brow with the gesture of\r\ndespair, as though she would wrest the madness from her brain—and a\r\nshudder of pity and awe passed through the assembled crowd. It is a fact\r\nthat at this moment, if her words were false, her anguish was both\r\nsincere and terrible. An angel soiled by crime, she lied like Satan\r\nhimself, but like him too she suffered all the agony of remorse and\r\npride. Thus, when at the end of her speech she burst into tears and\r\nimplored help and protection against the usurper of her kingdom, a cry\r\nof general assent drowned her closing words, several hands flew to their\r\nsword-hilts, and the Hungarian ambassadors retired covered with shame\r\nand confusion.\r\n\r\nThat same evening the sentence, to the great joy of all, was proclaimed,\r\nthat Joan was innocent and acquitted of all concern in the assassination\r\nof her husband. But as her conduct after the event and the indifference\r\nshe had shown about pursuing the authors of the crime admitted of no\r\nvalid excuse, the pope declared that there were plain traces of magic,\r\nand that the wrong-doing attributed to Joan was the result of some\r\nbaneful charm cast upon her, which she could by no possible means\r\nresist. At the same time, His Holiness confirmed her marriage with Louis\r\nof Tarentum, and bestowed on him the order of the Rose of Gold and the\r\ntitle of King of Sicily and Jerusalem. Joan, it is true, had on the eve\r\nof her acquittal sold the town of Avignon to the pope for the sum of\r\n80,000 florins.\r\n\r\nWhile the queen was pleading her cause at the court of Clement VI, a\r\ndreadful epidemic, called the Black Plague—the same that Boccaccio has\r\ndescribed so wonderfully—was ravaging the kingdom of Naples, and indeed\r\nthe whole of Italy. According to the calculation of Matteo Villani,\r\nFlorence lost three-fifths of her population, Bologna two-thirds, and\r\nnearly all Europe was reduced in some such frightful proportion. The\r\nNeapolitans were already weary of the cruelties and greed of the\r\nHungarians, they were only awaiting some opportunity to revolt against\r\nthe stranger’s oppression, and to recall their lawful sovereign, whom,\r\nfor all her ill deeds, they had never ceased to love. The attraction of\r\nyouth and beauty was deeply felt by this pleasure-loving people.\r\nScarcely had the pestilence thrown confusion into the army and town,\r\nwhen loud cursing arose against the tyrant and his executioners. Louis\r\nof Hungary, suddenly threatened by the wrath of Heaven and the people’s\r\nvengeance, was terrified both by the plague and by the riots, and\r\ndisappeared in the middle of the night. Leaving the government of Naples\r\nin the hands of Conrad Lupo, one of his captains, he embarked hastily at\r\nBerletta, and left the kingdom in very much the same way as Louis of\r\nTarentum, fleeing from him, had left it a few months before.\r\n\r\nThis news arrived at Avignon just when the pope was about to send the\r\nqueen his bull of absolution. It was at once decided to take away the\r\nkingdom from Louis’s viceroy. Nicholas Acciajuoli left for Naples with\r\nthe marvellous bull that was to prove to all men the innocence of the\r\nqueen, to banish all scruples and stir up a new enthusiasm. The\r\ncounsellor first went to the castle of Melzi, commanded by his son\r\nLorenzo: this was the only fortress that had always held out. The father\r\nand son embraced with the honourable pride that near relatives may\r\njustly feel when they meet after they have united in the performance of\r\na heroic duty. From the governor of Melzi Louis of Tarentum’s counsellor\r\nlearned that all men were wearied of the arrogance and vexatious conduct\r\nof the queen’s enemies, and that a conspiracy was in train, started in\r\nthe University of Naples, but with vast ramifications all over the\r\nkingdom, and moreover that there was dissension in the enemy’s army. The\r\nindefatigable counsellor went from Apulia to Naples, traversing towns\r\nand villages, collecting men everywhere, proclaiming loudly the\r\nacquittal of the queen and her marriage with Louis of Tarentum, also\r\nthat the pope was offering indulgences to such as would receive with joy\r\ntheir lawful sovereigns. Then seeing that the people shouted as he went\r\nby, \"Long live Joan! Death to the Hungarians!\" he returned and told his\r\nsovereigns in what frame of mind he had left their subjects.\r\n\r\nJoan borrowed money wherever she could, armed galleys, and left\r\nMarseilles with her husband, her sister, and two faithful advisers,\r\nAcciajuoli and Spinelli, on the 10th of September 1348. The king and\r\nqueen not being able to enter at the harbour, which was in the enemy’s\r\npower, disembarked at Santa Maria del Carmine, near the river Sebeto,\r\namid the frenzied applause of an immense crowd, and accompanied by all\r\nthe Neapolitan nobles. They made their way to the palace of Messire\r\nAjutorio, near Porta Capuana, the Hungarians having fortified themselves\r\nin all the castles; but Acciajuoli, at the head of the queen’s\r\npartisans, blockaded the fortresses so ably that half of the enemy were\r\nobliged to surrender, and the other half took to flight and were\r\nscattered about the interior of the kingdom. We shall now follow Louis\r\nof Tarentum in his arduous adventures in Apulia, the Calabrias, and the\r\nAbruzzi, where he recovered one by one the fortresses that the\r\nHungarians had taken. By dint of unexampled valour and patience, he at\r\nlast mastered nearly all the more considerable places, when suddenly\r\neverything changed, and fortune turned her back upon him for the second\r\ntime. A German captain called Warner, who had deserted the Hungarian\r\narmy to sell himself to the queen, had again played the traitor and sold\r\nhimself once more, allowed himself to be surprised at Corneto by Conrad\r\nLupo, the King of Hungary’s vicar-general, and openly joined him, taking\r\nalong with him a great party of the adventurers who fought under his\r\norders. This unexpected defection forced Louis of Tarentum to retire to\r\nNaples. The King of Hungary soon learning that the troops had rallied\r\nround his banner, and only awaited his return to march upon the capital,\r\ndisembarked with a strong reinforcement of cavalry at the port of\r\nManfredonia, and taking Trani, Canosa, and Salerno, went forward to lay\r\nsiege to Aversa.\r\n\r\nThe news fell like a thunder-clap on Joan and her husband. The Hungarian\r\narmy consisted of 10,000 horse and more than 7000 infantry, and Aversa\r\nhad only 500 soldiers under Giacomo Pignatelli. In spite of the immense\r\ndisproportion of the numbers, the Neapolitan general vigorously repelled\r\nthe attack; and the King of Hungary, fighting in the front, was wounded\r\nin his foot by an arrow. Then Louis, seeing that it would be difficult\r\nto take the place by storm, determined to starve them out. For three\r\nmonths the besieged performed prodigies of valour, and further\r\nassistance was impossible. Their capitulation was expected at any\r\nmoment, unless indeed they decided to perish every man. Renaud des Baux,\r\nwho was to come from Marseilles with a squadron of ten ships to defend\r\nthe ports of the capital and secure the queen’s flight, should the\r\nHungarian army get possession of Naples, had been delayed by adverse\r\nwinds and obliged to stop on the way. All things seemed to conspire in\r\nfavour of the enemy. Louis of Tarentum, whose generous soul refused to\r\nshed the blood of his brave men in an unequal and desperate struggle,\r\nnobly sacrificed himself, and made an offer to the King of Hungary to\r\nsettle their quarrel in single combat. We append the authentic letters\r\nthat passed between Joan’s husband and Andre’s brother.\r\n\r\n\"Illustrious King of Hungary, who has come to invade our kingdom, we, by\r\nthe grace of God King of Jerusalem and Sicily, invite you to single\r\ncombat. We know that you are in no wise disturbed by the death of your\r\nlancers or the other pagans in your suite, no more indeed than if they\r\nwere dogs; but we, fearing harm to our own soldiers and men-at-arms,\r\ndesire to fight with you personally, to put an end to the present war\r\nand restore peace to our kingdom. He who survives shall be king. And\r\ntherefore, to ensure that this duel shall take place, we definitely\r\npropose as a site either Paris, in the presence of the King of France,\r\nor one of the towns of Perugia, Avignon, or Naples. Choose one of these\r\nfour places, and send us your reply.\"\r\n\r\nThe King of Hungary first consulted with his council, and then replied:—\r\n\r\n\"Great King, we have read and considered your letter sent to us by the\r\nbearer of these presents, and by your invitation to a duel we are most\r\nsupremely pleased; but we do not approve of any of the places you\r\npropose, since they are all suspect, and for several reasons. The King\r\nof France is your maternal grandfather, and although we are also\r\nconnected by blood with him, the relationship is not so near. The town\r\nof Avignon, although nominally belonging to the sovereign pontiff, is\r\nthe capital of Provence, and has always been subject to your rule.\r\nNeither have we any more confidence in Perugia, for that town is devoted\r\nto your cause.\r\n\r\n\"As to the city of Naples, there is no need to say that we refuse that\r\nrendezvous, since it is in revolt against us and you are there as king.\r\nBut if you wish to fight with us, let it be in the presence of the\r\nEmperor of Germany, who is lord supreme, or the King of England, who is\r\nour common friend, or the Patriarch of Aquilea, a good Catholic. If you\r\ndo not approve of any of the places we propose, we shall soon be near\r\nyou with our army, and so remove all difficulties and delays. Then you\r\ncan come forth, and our duel can take place in the presence of both\r\narmies.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the interchange of these two letters, Louis of Tarentum proposed\r\nnothing further. The garrison at Aversa had capitulated after a heroic\r\nresistance, and it was known only too well that if the King of Hungary\r\ncould get so far as the walls of Naples, he would not have to endanger\r\nhis life in order to seize that city. Happily the Provencal galleys had\r\nreached port at last. The king and the queen had only just time to\r\nembark and take refuge at Gaeta. The Hungarian army arrived at Naples.\r\nThe town was on the point of yielding, and had sent messengers to the\r\nking humbly demanding peace; but the speeches of the Hungarians showed\r\nsuch insolence that the people, irritated past endurance, took up arms,\r\nand resolved to defend their household gods with all the energy of\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the Neapolitans were holding out against their enemy at the Porta\r\nCapuana, a strange scene was being enacted at the other side of the\r\ntown, a scene that shows us in lively colours the violence and treachery\r\nof this barbarous age. The widow of Charles of Durazzo was shut up in\r\nthe castle of Ovo, and awaiting in feverish anxiety the arrival of the\r\nship that was to take her to the queen. The poor Princess Marie,\r\npressing her weeping children to her heart, pale, with dishevelled\r\nlocks, fixed eyes, and drawn lips, was listening for every sound,\r\ndistracted between hope and fear. Suddenly steps resounded along the\r\ncorridor; a friendly voice was heard; Marie fell upon her knees with a\r\ncry of joy: her liberator had come.\r\n\r\nRenaud des Baux, admiral of the Provencal squadron, respectfully\r\nadvanced, followed by his eldest son Robert and his chaplain.\r\n\r\n\"God, I thank Thee!\" exclaimed Marie, rising to her feet; \"we are\r\nsaved.\"\r\n\r\n\"One moment, madam,\" said Renaud, stopping her: \"you are indeed saved,\r\nbut upon one condition.\"\r\n\r\n\"A condition?\" murmured the princess in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, madam. The King of Hungary, the avenger of Andre’s murderers,\r\nthe slayer of your husband, is at the gates of Naples; the people and\r\nsoldiers will succumb, as soon as their last gallant effort is spent—the\r\narmy of the conqueror is about to spread desolation and death throughout\r\nthe city by fire and the sword. This time the Hungarian butcher will\r\nspare no victims: he will kill the mother before her children’s eyes,\r\nthe children in their mother’s arms. The drawbridge of this castle is up\r\nand there are none on guard; every man who can wield a sword is now at\r\nthe other end of the town. Woe to you, Marie of Durazzo, if the King of\r\nHungary shall remember that you preferred his rival to him!\"\r\n\r\n\"But have you not come here to save me?\" cried Marie in a voice of\r\nanguish. \"Joan, my sister, did she not command you to take me to her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your sister is no longer in the position to give orders,\" replied\r\nRenaud, with a disdainful smile. \"She had nothing for me but thanks\r\nbecause I saved her life, and her husband’s too, when he fled like a\r\ncoward before the man whom he had dared to challenge to a duel.\"\r\n\r\nMarie looked fixedly at the admiral to assure herself that it was really\r\nhe who thus arrogantly talked about his masters. But she was terrified\r\nat his imperturbable expression, and said gently—\r\n\r\n\"As I owe my life and my children’s lives solely to your generosity, I\r\nam grateful to you beyond all measure. But we must hurry, my lord: every\r\nmoment I fancy I hear cries of vengeance, and you would not leave me now\r\na prey to my brutal enemy?\"\r\n\r\n\"God forbid, madam; I will save you at the risk of my life; but I have\r\nsaid already, I impose a condition.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" said Marie, with forced calm.\r\n\r\n\"That you marry my son on the instant, in the presence of our reverend\r\nchaplain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rash man!\" cried Marie, recoiling, her face scarlet with indignation\r\nand shame; \"you dare to speak thus to the sister of your legitimate\r\nsovereign? Give thanks to God that I will pardon an insult offered, as I\r\nknow, in a moment of madness; try by your devotion to make me forget\r\nwhat you have said.\"\r\n\r\nThe count, without one word, signed to his son and a priest to follow,\r\nand prepared to depart. As he crossed the threshold Marie ran to him,\r\nand clasping her hands, prayed him in God’s name never to forsake her.\r\nRenaud stopped.\r\n\r\n\"I might easily take my revenge,\" he said, \"for your affront when you\r\nrefuse my son in your pride; but that business I leave to Louis of\r\nHungary, who will acquit himself, no doubt, with credit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have mercy on my poor daughters!\" cried the princess; \"mercy at least\r\nfor my poor babes, if my own tears cannot move you.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you loved your children,\" said the admiral, frowning, \"you would\r\nhave done your duty at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I do not love your son!\" cried Marie, proud but trembling. \"O God,\r\nmust a wretched woman’s heart be thus trampled? You, father, a minister\r\nof truth and justice, tell this man that God must not be called on to\r\nwitness an oath dragged from the weak and helpless!\"\r\n\r\nShe turned to the admiral’s son; and added, sobbing—\r\n\r\n\"You are young, perhaps you have loved: one day no doubt you will love.\r\nI appeal to your loyalty as a young man, to your courtesy as a knight,\r\nto all your noblest impulses; join me, and turn your father away from\r\nhis fatal project. You have never seen me before: you do not know but\r\nthat in my secret heart I love another. Your pride should be revolted at\r\nthe sight of an unhappy woman casting herself at your feet and imploring\r\nyour favour and protection. One word from you, Robert, and I shall bless\r\nyou every moment of my life: the memory of you will be graven in my\r\nheart like the memory of a guardian angel, and my children shall name\r\nyou nightly in their prayers, asking God to grant your wishes. Oh, say,\r\nwill you not save me? Who knows, later on I may love you—with real\r\nlove.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must obey my father,\" Robert replied, never lifting his eyes to the\r\nlovely suppliant.\r\n\r\nThe priest was silent. Two minutes passed, and these four persons, each\r\nabsorbed in his own thoughts, stood motionless as statues carved at the\r\nfour corners of a tomb. Marie was thrice tempted to throw herself into\r\nthe sea. But a confused distant sound suddenly struck upon her ears:\r\nlittle by little it drew nearer, voices were more distinctly heard;\r\nwomen in the street were uttering cries of distress—\r\n\r\n\"Fly, fly! God has forsaken us; the Hungarians are in the town!\"\r\n\r\nThe tears of Marie’s children were the answer to these cries; and little\r\nMargaret, raising her hands to her mother, expressed her fear in speech\r\nthat was far beyond her years. Renaud, without one look at this touching\r\npicture, drew his son towards the door.\r\n\r\n\"Stay,\" said the princess, extending her hand with a solemn gesture: \"as\r\nGod sends no other aid to my children, it is His will that the sacrifice\r\nbe accomplished.\"\r\n\r\nShe fell on her knees before the priest, bending her head like a victim\r\nwho offers her neck to the executioner. Robert des Baux took his place\r\nbeside her, and the priest pronounced the formula that united them for\r\never, consecrating the infamous deed by a sacrilegious blessing.\r\n\r\n\"All is over!\" murmured Marie of Durazzo, looking tearfully on her\r\nlittle daughters.\r\n\r\n\"No, all is not yet over,\" said the admiral harshly, pushing her towards\r\nanother room; \"before we leave, the marriage must be consummated.\"\r\n\r\n\"O just God!\" cried the princess, in a voice torn with anguish, and she\r\nfell swooning to the floor.\r\n\r\nRenaud des Baux directed his ships towards Marseilles, where he hoped to\r\nget his son crowned Count of Provence, thanks to his strange marriage\r\nwith Marie of Durazzo. But this cowardly act of treason was not to go\r\nunpunished. The wind rose with fury, and drove him towards Gaeta, where\r\nthe queen and her husband had just arrived. Renaud bade his sailors keep\r\nin the open, threatening to throw any man into the sea who dared to\r\ndisobey him. The crew at first murmured; soon cries of mutiny rose on\r\nevery side. The admiral, seeing he was lost, passed from threats to\r\nprayers. But the princess, who had recovered her senses at the first\r\nthunder-clap, dragged herself up to the bridge and screamed for help,\r\n\r\n\"Come to me, Louis! Come, my barons! Death to the cowardly wretches who\r\nhave outraged my honour!\"\r\n\r\nLouis of Tarentum jumped into a boat, followed by some ten of his\r\nbravest men, and, rowing rapidly, reached the ship. Then Marie told him\r\nher story in a word, and he turned upon the admiral a lightning glance,\r\nas though defying him to make any defence.\r\n\r\n\"Wretch!\" cried the king, transfixing the traitor with his sword.\r\n\r\nThen he had the son loaded with chains, and also the unworthy priest who\r\nhad served as accomplice to the admiral, who now expiated his odious\r\ncrime by death. He took the princess and her children in his boat, and\r\nre-entered the harbour.\r\n\r\nThe Hungarians, however, forcing one of the gates of Naples, marched\r\ntriumphant to Castel Nuovo. But as they were crossing the Piazza delle\r\nCorreggie, the Neapolitans perceived that the horses were so weak and\r\nthe men so reduced by all they had undergone during the siege of Aversa\r\nthat a mere puff of wind would dispense this phantom-like army. Changing\r\nfrom a state of panic to real daring, the people rushed upon their\r\nconquerors, and drove them outside the walls by which they had just\r\nentered. The sudden violent reaction broke the pride of the King of\r\nHungary, and made him more tractable when Clement VI decided that he\r\nought at last to interfere. A truce was concluded first from the month\r\nof February 1350 to the beginning of April 1351, and the next year this\r\nwas converted into a real peace, Joan paying to the King of Hungary the\r\nsum of 300,000 florins for the expenses of the war.\r\n\r\nAfter the Hungarians had gone, the pope sent a legate to crown Joan and\r\nLouis of Tarentum, and the 25th of May, the day of Pentecost, was chosen\r\nfor the ceremony. All contemporary historians speak enthusiastically of\r\nthis magnificent fete. Its details have been immortalised by Giotto in\r\nthe frescoes of the church which from this day bore the name of\r\nL’Incoronata. A general amnesty was declared for all who had taken part\r\nin the late wars on either side, and the king and queen were greeted\r\nwith shouts of joy as they solemnly paraded beneath the canopy, with all\r\nthe barons of the kingdom in their train.\r\n\r\nBut the day’s joy was impaired by an accident which to a superstitious\r\npeople seemed of evil augury. Louis of Tarentum, riding a richly\r\ncaparisoned horse, had just passed the Porta Petruccia, when some ladies\r\nlooking out from a high window threw such a quantity of flowers at the\r\nking that his frightened steed reared and broke his rein. Louis could\r\nnot hold him, so jumped lightly to the ground; but the crown fell at his\r\nfeet and was broken into three pieces. On that very day the only\r\ndaughter of Joan and Louis died.\r\n\r\nBut the king not wishing to sadden the brilliant ceremony with show of\r\nmourning, kept up the jousts and tournaments for three days, and in\r\nmemory of his coronation instituted the order of ’Chevaliers du Noeud’.\r\nBut from that day begun with an omen so sad, his life was nothing but a\r\nseries of disillusions. After sustaining wars in Sicily and Apulia, and\r\nquelling the insurrection of Louis of Durazzo, who ended his days in the\r\ncastle of Ovo, Louis of Tarentum, worn out by a life of pleasure, his\r\nhealth undermined by slow disease, overwhelmed with domestic trouble,\r\nsuccumbed to an acute fever on the 5th of June 1362, at the age of\r\nforty-two. His body had not been laid in its royal tomb at Saint\r\nDomenico before several aspirants appeared to the hand of the queen.\r\n\r\nOne was the Prince of Majorca, the handsome youth we have already spoken\r\nof: he bore her off triumphant over all rivals, including the son of the\r\nKing of France. James of Aragon had one of those faces of melancholy\r\nsweetness which no woman can resist. Great troubles nobly borne had\r\nthrown as it were a funereal veil over his youthful days: more than\r\nthirteen years he had spent shut in an iron cage; when by the aid of a\r\nfalse key he had escaped from his dreadful prison, he wandered from one\r\ncourt to another seeking aid; it is even said that he was reduced to the\r\nlowest degree of poverty and forced to beg his bread. The young\r\nstranger’s beauty and his adventures combined had impressed both Joan\r\nand Marie at the court of Avignon. Marie especially had conceived a\r\nviolent passion for him, all the more so for the efforts she made to\r\nconceal it in her own bosom. Ever since James of Aragon came to Naples,\r\nthe unhappy princess, married with a dagger at her throat, had desired\r\nto purchase her liberty at the expense of crime. Followed by four armed\r\nmen, she entered the prison where Robert des Baux was still suffering\r\nfor a fault more his father’s than his own. Marie stood before the\r\nprisoner, her arms crossed, her cheeks livid, her lips trembling. It was\r\na terrible interview. This time it was she who threatened, the man who\r\nentreated pardon. Marie was deaf to his prayers, and the head of the\r\nluckless man fell bleeding at her feet, and her men threw the body into\r\nthe sea. But God never allows a murder to go unpunished: James preferred\r\nthe queen to her sister, and the widow of Charles of Durazzo gained\r\nnothing by her crime but the contempt of the man she loved, and a bitter\r\nremorse which brought her while yet young to the tomb.\r\n\r\nJoan was married in turn to James of Aragon, son of the King of Majorca,\r\nand to Otho of Brunswick, of the imperial family of Saxony. We will pass\r\nrapidly over these years, and come to the denouement of this history of\r\ncrime and expiation. James, parted from his wife, continued his stormy\r\ncareer, after a long contest in Spain with Peter the Cruel, who had\r\nusurped his kingdom: about the end of the year 1375 he died near\r\nNavarre. Otho also could not escape the Divine vengeance which hung over\r\nthe court of Naples, but to the end he valiantly shared the queen’s\r\nfortunes. Joan, since she had no lawful heir, adopted her nephew,\r\nCharles de la Paix (so called after the peace of Trevisa). He was the\r\nson of Louis Duras, who after rebelling against Louis of Tarentum, had\r\ndied miserably in the castle of Ovo. The child would have shared his\r\nfather’s fate had not Joan interceded to spare his life, loaded him with\r\nkindness, and married him to Margaret, the daughter of her sister Marie\r\nand her cousin Charles, who was put to death by the King of Hungary.\r\n\r\nSerious differences arose between the queen and one of her former\r\nsubjects, Bartolommeo Prigiani, who had become pope under the name of\r\nUrban VI. Annoyed by the queen’s opposition, the pope one day angrily\r\nsaid he would shut her up in a convent. Joan, to avenge the insult,\r\nopenly favoured Clement VII, the anti-pope, and offered him a home in\r\nher own castle, when, pursued by Pope Urban’s army, he had taken refuge\r\nat Fondi. But the people rebelled against Clement, and killed the\r\nArchbishop of Naples, who had helped to elect him: they broke the cross\r\nthat was carried in procession before the anti-pope, and hardly allowed\r\nhim time to make his escape on shipboard to Provence. Urban declared\r\nthat Joan was now dethroned, and released her subjects from their oath\r\nof fidelity to her, bestowing the crown of Sicily and Jerusalem upon\r\nCharles de la Paix, who marched on Naples with 8000 Hungarians. Joan,\r\nwho could not believe in such base ingratitude, sent out his wife\r\nMargaret to meet her adopted son, though she might have kept her as a\r\nhostage, and his two children, Ladislaus and Joan, who became later the\r\nsecond queen of that name. But the victorious army soon arrived at the\r\ngates of Naples, and Charles blockaded the queen in her castle,\r\nforgetting in his ingratitude that she had saved his life and loved him\r\nlike a mother.\r\n\r\nJoan during the siege endured all the worst fatigues of war that any\r\nsoldier has to bear. She saw her faithful friends fall around her wasted\r\nby hunger or decimated by sickness. When all food was exhausted, dead\r\nand decomposed bodies were thrown into the castle that they might\r\npollute the air she breathed. Otho with his troops was kept at Aversa;\r\nLouis of Anjou, the brother of the King of France whom she had named as\r\nher successor when she disinherited her nephew, never appeared to help\r\nher, and the Provencal ships from Clement VII were not due to arrive\r\nuntil all hope must be over. Joan asked for a truce of five days,\r\npromising that, if Otho had not come to relieve her in that time, she\r\nwould surrender the fortress.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth day Otho’s army appeared on the side of Piedigrotta. The\r\nfight was sharp on both sides, and Joan from the top of a tower could\r\nfollow with her eyes the cloud of dust raised by her husband’s horse in\r\nthe thickest of the battle. The victory was long uncertain: at length\r\nthe prince made so bold an onset upon the royal standard, in his\r\neagerness to meet his enemy hand to hand, that he plunged into the very\r\nmiddle of the army, and found himself pressed on every side. Covered\r\nwith blood and sweat, his sword broken in his hand, he was forced to\r\nsurrender. An hour later Charles was writing to his uncle, the King of\r\nHungary, that Joan had fallen into his power, and he only awaited His\r\nMajesty’s orders to decide her fate.\r\n\r\nIt was a fine May morning: the queen was under guard in the castle of\r\nAversa: Otho had obtained his liberty on condition of his quitting\r\nNaples, and Louis of Anjou had at last got together an army of 50,000\r\nmen and was marching in hot haste to the conquest of the kingdom. None\r\nof this news had reached the ears of Joan, who for some days had lived\r\nin complete isolation. The spring lavished all her glory on these\r\nenchanted plains, which have earned the name of the blessed and happy\r\ncountry, campagna felite. The orange trees were covered with sweet white\r\nblossoms, the cherries laden with ruby fruit, the olives with young\r\nemerald leaves, the pomegranate feathery with red bells; the wild\r\nmulberry, the evergreen laurel, all the strong budding vegetation,\r\nneeding no help from man to flourish in this spot privileged by Nature,\r\nmade one great garden, here and there interrupted by little hidden\r\nrunlets. It was a forgotten Eden in this corner of the world. Joan at\r\nher window was breathing in the perfumes of spring, and her eyes misty\r\nwith tears rested on a bed of flowery verdure; a light breeze, keen and\r\nbalmy, blew upon her burning brow and offered a grateful coolness to her\r\ndamp and fevered cheeks. Distant melodious voices, refrains of\r\nwell-known songs, were all that disturbed the silence of the poor little\r\nroom, the solitary nest where a life was passing away in tears and\r\nrepentance, a life the most brilliant and eventful of a century of\r\nsplendour and unrest.\r\n\r\nThe queen was slowly reviewing in her mind all her life since she ceased\r\nto be a child—fifty years of disillusionment and suffering. She thought\r\nfirst of her happy, peaceful childhood, her grandfather’s blind\r\naffection, the pure joys of her days of innocence, the exciting games\r\nwith her little sister and tall cousins. Then she shuddered at the\r\nearliest thought of marriage, the constraint, the loss of liberty, the\r\nbitter regrets; she remembered with horror the deceitful words murmured\r\nin her ear, designed to sow the seeds of corruption and vice that were\r\nto poison her whole life. Then came the burning memories of her first\r\nlove, the treachery and desertion of Robert of Cabane, the moments of\r\nmadness passed like a dream in the arms of Bertrand of Artois—the whole\r\ndrama up to its tragic denouement showed as in letters of fire on the\r\ndark background of her sombre thoughts. Then arose cries of anguish in\r\nher soul, even as on that terrible fatal night she heard the voice of\r\nAndre asking mercy from his murderers. A long deadly silence followed\r\nhis awful struggle, and the queen saw before her eyes the carts of\r\ninfamy and the torture of her accomplices. All the rest of this vision\r\nwas persecution, flight, exile, remorse, punishments from God and curses\r\nfrom the world. Around her was a frightful solitude: husbands, lovers,\r\nkindred, friends, all were dead; all she had loved or hated in the world\r\nwere now no more; her joy, pain, desire, and hope had vanished for ever.\r\nThe poor queen, unable to free herself from these visions of woe,\r\nviolently tore herself away from the awful reverie, and kneeling at a\r\nprie-dieu, prayed with fervour. She was still beautiful, in spite of her\r\nextreme pallor; the noble lines of her face kept their pure oval; the\r\nfire of repentance in her great black eyes lit them up with superhuman\r\nbrilliance, and the hope of pardon played in a heavenly smile upon her\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the door of the room where Joan was so earnestly praying opened\r\nwith a dull sound: two Hungarian barons in armour entered and signed to\r\nthe queen to follow them. Joan arose silently and obeyed; but a cry of\r\npain went up from her heart when she recognised the place where both\r\nAndre and Charles of Durazzo had died a violent death. But she collected\r\nher forces, and asked calmly why she was brought hither. For all answer,\r\none of the men showed her a cord of silk and gold....\r\n\r\n\"May the will of a just God be done!\" cried Joan, and fell upon her\r\nknees. Some minutes later she had ceased to suffer.\r\n\r\nThis was the third corpse that was thrown over the balcony at Aversa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK [An Essay]*\r\n\r\n\r\n    (This is the essay entitled The Man in the Iron Mask, not the\r\n    novel\r\n    \"The Man in the Iron Mask\" [The Novel] Dumas\r\n    #28[nmaskxxx.xxx]2759])\r\n\r\nFor nearly one hundred years this curious problem has exercised the\r\nimagination of writers of fiction—and of drama, and the patience of the\r\nlearned in history. No subject is more obscure and elusive, and none\r\nmore attractive to the general mind. It is a legend to the meaning of\r\nwhich none can find the key and yet in which everyone believes.\r\nInvoluntarily we feel pity at the thought of that long captivity\r\nsurrounded by so many extraordinary precautions, and when we dwell on\r\nthe mystery which enveloped the captive, that pity is not only deepened\r\nbut a kind of terror takes possession of us. It is very likely that if\r\nthe name of the hero of this gloomy tale had been known at the time, he\r\nwould now be forgotten. To give him a name would be to relegate him at\r\nonce to the ranks of those commonplace offenders who quickly exhaust our\r\ninterest and our tears. But this being, cut off from the world without\r\nleaving any discoverable trace, and whose disappearance apparently\r\ncaused no void—this captive, distinguished among captives by the\r\nunexampled nature of his punishment, a prison within a prison, as if the\r\nwalls of a mere cell were not narrow enough, has come to typify for us\r\nthe sum of all the human misery and suffering ever inflicted by unjust\r\ntyranny.\r\n\r\nWho was the Man in the Mask? Was he rapt away into this silent seclusion\r\nfrom the luxury of a court, from the intrigues of diplomacy, from the\r\nscaffold of a traitor, from the clash of battle? What did he leave\r\nbehind? Love, glory, or a throne? What did he regret when hope had fled?\r\nDid he pour forth imprecations and curses on his tortures and blaspheme\r\nagainst high Heaven, or did he with a sigh possess his soul in patience?\r\n\r\nThe blows of fortune are differently received according to the different\r\ncharacters of those on whom they fall; and each one of us who in\r\nimagination threads the subterranean passages leading to the cells of\r\nPignerol and Exilles, and incarcerates himself in the Iles\r\nSainte-Marguerite and in the Bastille, the successive scenes of that\r\nlong-protracted agony will give the prisoner a form shaped by his own\r\nfancy and a grief proportioned to his own power of suffering. How we\r\nlong to pierce the thoughts and feel the heart-beats and watch the\r\ntrickling tears behind that machine-like exterior, that impossible mask!\r\nOur imagination is powerfully excited by the dumbness of that fate borne\r\nby one whose words never reached the outward air, whose thoughts could\r\nnever be read on the hidden features; by the isolation of forty years\r\nsecured by two-fold barriers of stone and iron, and she clothes the\r\nobject of her contemplation in majestic splendour, connects the mystery\r\nwhich enveloped his existence with mighty interests, and persists in\r\nregarding the prisoner as sacrificed for the preservation of some\r\ndynastic secret involving the peace of the world and the stability of a\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\nAnd when we calmly reflect on the whole case, do we feel that our first\r\nimpulsively adopted opinion was wrong? Do we regard our belief as a\r\npoetical illusion? I do not think so; on the contrary, it seems to me\r\nthat our good sense approves our fancy’s flight. For what can be more\r\nnatural than the conviction that the secret of the name, age, and\r\nfeatures of the captive, which was so perseveringly kept through long\r\nyears at the cost of so much care, was of vital importance to the\r\nGovernment? No ordinary human passion, such as anger, hate, or\r\nvengeance, has so dogged and enduring a character; we feel that the\r\nmeasures taken were not the expression of a love of cruelty, for even\r\nsupposing that Louis XIV were the most cruel of princes, would he not\r\nhave chosen one of the thousand methods of torture ready to his hand\r\nbefore inventing a new and strange one? Moreover, why did he voluntarily\r\nburden himself with the obligation of surrounding a prisoner with such\r\nnumberless precautions and such sleepless vigilance? Must he not have\r\nfeared that in spite of it all the walls behind which he concealed the\r\ndread mystery would one day let in the light? Was it not through his\r\nentire reign a source of unceasing anxiety? And yet he respected the\r\nlife of the captive whom it was so difficult to hide, and the discovery\r\nof whose identity would have been so dangerous. It would have been so\r\neasy to bury the secret in an obscure grave, and yet the order was never\r\ngiven. Was this an expression of hate, anger, or any other passion?\r\nCertainly not; the conclusion we must come to in regard to the conduct\r\nof the king is that all the measures he took against the prisoner were\r\ndictated by purely political motives; that his conscience, while\r\nallowing him to do everything necessary to guard the secret, did not\r\npermit him to take the further step of putting an end to the days of an\r\nunfortunate man, who in all probability was guilty of no crime.\r\n\r\nCourtiers are seldom obsequious to the enemies of their master, so that\r\nwe may regard the respect and consideration shown to the Man in the Mask\r\nby the governor Saint-Mars, and the minister Louvois, as a testimony,\r\nnot only to his high rank, but also to his innocence.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I make no pretensions to the erudition of the bookworm, and\r\nI cannot read the history of the Man in the Iron Mask without feeling my\r\nblood boil at the abominable abuse of power—the heinous crime of which\r\nhe was the victim.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, M. Fournier and I, thinking the subject suitable for\r\nrepresentation on the stage, undertook to read, before dramatising it,\r\nall the different versions of the affair which had been published up to\r\nthat time. Since our piece was successfully performed at the Odeon two\r\nother versions have appeared: one was in the form of a letter addressed\r\nto the Historical Institute by M. Billiard, who upheld the conclusions\r\narrived at by Soulavie, on whose narrative our play was founded; the\r\nother was a work by the bibliophile Jacob, who followed a new system of\r\ninquiry, and whose book displayed the results of deep research and\r\nextensive reading. It did not, however, cause me to change my opinion.\r\nEven had it been published before I had written my drama, I should still\r\nhave adhered to the idea as to the most probable solution of the problem\r\nwhich I had arrived at in 1831, not only because it was incontestably\r\nthe most dramatic, but also because it is supported by those moral\r\npresumptions which have such weight with us when considering a dark and\r\ndoubtful question like the one before us. It will, be objected, perhaps,\r\nthat dramatic writers, in their love of the marvellous and the pathetic,\r\nneglect logic and strain after effect, their aim being to obtain the\r\napplause of the gallery rather than the approbation of the learned. But\r\nto this it may be replied that the learned on their part sacrifice a\r\ngreat deal to their love of dates, more or less exact; to their desire\r\nto elucidate some point which had hitherto been considered obscure, and\r\nwhich their explanations do not always clear up; to the temptation to\r\ndisplay their proficiency in the ingenious art of manipulating facts and\r\nfigures culled from a dozen musty volumes into one consistent whole.\r\n\r\nOur interest in this strange case of imprisonment arises, not alone from\r\nits completeness and duration, but also from our uncertainty as to the\r\nmotives from which it was inflicted. Where erudition alone cannot\r\nsuffice; where bookworm after bookworm, disdaining the conjectures of\r\nhis predecessors, comes forward with a new theory founded on some\r\nforgotten document he has hunted out, only to find himself in his turn\r\npushed into oblivion by some follower in his track, we must turn for\r\nguidance to some other light than that of scholarship; especially if, on\r\nstrict investigation, we find that not one learned solution rests on a\r\nsound basis of fact.\r\n\r\nIn the question before us, which, as we said before, is a double one,\r\nasking not only who was the Man in the Iron Mask, but why he was\r\nrelentlessly subjected to this torture till the moment of his death,\r\nwhat we need in order to restrain our fancy is mathematical\r\ndemonstration, and not philosophical induction.\r\n\r\nWhile I do not go so far as to assert positively that Abbe Soulavie has\r\nonce for all lifted the veil which hid the truth, I am yet persuaded\r\nthat no other system of research is superior to his, and that no other\r\nsuggested solution has so many presumptions in its favour. I have not\r\nreached this firm conviction on account of the great and prolonged\r\nsuccess of our drama, but because of the ease with which all the\r\nopinions adverse to those of the abbe may be annihilated by pitting them\r\none against the other.\r\n\r\nThe qualities that make for success being quite different in a novel and\r\nin a drama, I could easily have founded a romance on the fictitious\r\nloves of Buckingham and the queen, or on a supposed secret marriage\r\nbetween her and Cardinal Mazarin, calling to my aid a work by\r\nSaint-Mihiel which the bibliophile declares he has never read, although\r\nit is assuredly neither rare nor difficult of access. I might also have\r\nmerely expanded my drama, restoring to the personages therein their true\r\nnames and relative positions, both of which the exigencies of the stage\r\nhad sometimes obliged me to alter, and while allowing them to fill the\r\nsame parts, making them act more in accordance with historical fact. No\r\nfable however far-fetched, no grouping of characters however improbable,\r\ncan, however, destroy the interest which the innumerable writings about\r\nthe Iron Mask excite, although no two agree in details, and although\r\neach author and each witness declares himself in possession of complete\r\nknowledge. No work, however mediocre, however worthless even, which has\r\nappeared on this subject has ever failed of success, not even, for\r\nexample, the strange jumble of Chevalier de Mouhy, a kind of literary\r\nbraggart, who was in the pay of Voltaire, and whose work was published\r\nanonymously in 1746 by Pierre de Hondt of The Hague. It is divided into\r\nsix short parts, and bears the title, ’Le Masque de Fer, ou les\r\nAventures admirables du Prre et du Fils’. An absurd romance by Regnault\r\nWarin, and one at least equally absurd by Madame Guenard, met with a\r\nlike favourable reception. In writing for the theatre, an author must\r\nchoose one view of a dramatic situation to the exclusion of all others,\r\nand in following out this central idea is obliged by the inexorable laws\r\nof logic to push aside everything that interferes with its development.\r\nA book, on the contrary, is written to be discussed; it brings under the\r\nnotice of the reader all the evidence produced at a trial which has as\r\nyet not reached a definite conclusion, and which in the case before us\r\nwill never reach it, unless, which is most improbable, some lucky chance\r\nshould lead to some new discovery.\r\n\r\nThe first mention of the prisoner is to be found in the ’Memoires\r\nsecrets pour servir a l’Histoire de Perse’ in one 12mo volume, by an\r\nanonymous author, published by the ’Compagnie des Libraires Associes\r\nd’Amsterdam’ in 1745.\r\n\r\n\"Not having any other purpose,\" says the author (page 20, 2nd edit.),\r\n\"than to relate facts which are not known, or about which no one has\r\nwritten, or about which it is impossible to be silent, we refer at once\r\nto a fact which has hitherto almost escaped notice concerning Prince\r\nGiafer (Louis de Bourbon, Comte de Vermandois, son of Louis XIV and\r\nMademoiselle de la Valliere), who was visited by Ali-Momajou (the Duc\r\nd’Orleans, the regent) in the fortress of Ispahan (the Bastille), in\r\nwhich he had been imprisoned for several years. This visit had probably\r\nno other motive than to make sure that this prince was really alive, he\r\nhaving been reputed dead of the plague for over thirty years, and his\r\nobsequies having been celebrated in presence of an entire army.\r\n\r\n\"Cha-Abas (Louis XIV) had a legitimate son, Sephi-Mirza (Louis, Dauphin\r\nof France), and a natural son, Giafer. These two princes, as dissimilar\r\nin character as in birth, were always rivals and always at enmity with\r\neach other. One day Giafer so far forgot himself as to strike\r\nSephi-Mirza. Cha-Abas having heard of the insult offered to the heir to\r\nthe throne, assembled his most trusted councillors, and laid the conduct\r\nof the culprit before them—conduct which, according to the law of the\r\ncountry, was punishable with death, an opinion in which they all agreed.\r\nOne of the councillors, however, sympathising more than the others with\r\nthe distress of Cha-Abas, suggested that Giafer should be sent to the\r\narmy, which was then on the frontiers of Feidrun (Flanders), and that\r\nhis death from plague should be given out a few days after his arrival.\r\nThen, while the whole army was celebrating his obsequies, he should be\r\ncarried off by night, in the greatest secrecy, to the stronghold on the\r\nisle of Ormus (Sainte-Marguerite), and there imprisoned for life.\r\n\r\n\"This course was adopted, and carried out by faithful and discreet\r\nagents. The prince, whose premature death was mourned by the army, being\r\ncarried by unfrequented roads to the isle of Ormus, was placed in the\r\ncustody of the commandant of the island, who, had received orders\r\nbeforehand not to allow any person whatever to see the prisoner. A\r\nsingle servant who was in possession of the secret was killed by the\r\nescort on the journey, and his face so disfigured by dagger thrusts that\r\nhe could not be recognised.\r\n\r\n\"The commandant treated his prisoner with the most profound respect; he\r\nwaited on him at meals himself, taking the dishes from the cooks at the\r\ndoor of the apartment, none of whom ever looked on the face of Giafer.\r\nOne day it occurred to the prince to scratch, his name on the back of a\r\nplate with his knife. One of the servants into whose hands the plate\r\nfell ran with it at once to the commandant, hoping he would be pleased\r\nand reward the bearer; but the unfortunate man was greatly mistaken, for\r\nhe was at once made away with, that his knowledge of such an important\r\nsecret might be buried with himself.\r\n\r\n\"Giafer remained several years in the castle Ormus, and was then\r\ntransported to the fortress of Ispahan; the commandant of Ormus having\r\nreceived the governorship of Ispahan as a reward for faithful service.\r\n\r\n\"At Ispahan, as at Ormus, whenever it was necessary on account of\r\nillness or any other cause to allow anyone to approach the prince, he\r\nwas always masked; and several trustworthy persons have asserted that\r\nthey had seen the masked prisoner often, and had noticed that he used\r\nthe familiar ’tu’ when addressing the governor, while the latter showed\r\nhis charge the greatest respect. As Giafer survived Cha-Abas and\r\nSephi-Mirza by many years, it may be asked why he was never set at\r\nliberty; but it must be remembered it would have been impossible to\r\nrestore a prince to his rank and dignities whose tomb actually existed,\r\nand of whose burial there were not only living witnesses but documentary\r\nproofs, the authenticity of which it would have been useless to deny, so\r\nfirm was the belief, which has lasted down to the present day, that\r\nGiafer died of the plague in camp when with the army on the frontiers of\r\nFlanders. Ali-Homajou died shortly after the visit he paid to Giafer.\"\r\n\r\nThis version of the story, which is the original source of all the\r\ncontroversy on the subject, was at first generally received as true. On\r\na critical examination it fitted in very well with certain events which\r\ntook place in the reign of Louis XIV.\r\n\r\nThe Comte de Vermandois had in fact left the court for the camp very\r\nsoon after his reappearance there, for he had been banished by the king\r\nfrom his presence some time before for having, in company with several\r\nyoung nobles, indulged in the most reprehensible excesses.\r\n\r\n\"The king,\" says Mademoiselle de Montpensier (’Memoires de Mademoiselle\r\nde Montpensier’, vol. xliii. p. 474., of ’Memoires Relatifs d’Histoire\r\nde France’, Second Series, published by Petitot), \"had not been\r\nsatisfied with his conduct and refused to see him. The young prince had\r\ncaused his mother much sorrow, but had been so well lectured that it was\r\nbelieved that he had at last turned over a new leaf.\" He only remained\r\nfour days at court, reached the camp before Courtrai early in November\r\n1683, was taken ill on the evening of the 12th, and died on the 19th of\r\nthe same month of a malignant fever. Mademoiselle de Montpensier says\r\nthat the Comte de Vermandois \"fell ill from drink.\"\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, objections of all kinds to this theory.\r\n\r\nFor if, during the four days the comte was at court, he had struck the\r\ndauphin, everyone would have heard of the monstrous crime, and yet it is\r\nnowhere spoken of, except in the ’Memoires de Perse’. What renders the\r\nstory of the blow still more improbable is the difference in age between\r\nthe two princes. The dauphin, who already had a son, the Duc de\r\nBourgogne, more than a year old, was born the 1st November 1661, and was\r\ntherefore six years older than the Comte de Vermandois. But the most\r\ncomplete answer to the tale is to be found in a letter written by\r\nBarbezieux to Saint-Mars, dated the 13th August 1691:—\r\n\r\n\"When you have any information to send me relative to the prisoner who\r\nhas been in your charge for twenty years, I most earnestly enjoin on you\r\nto take the same precautions as when you write to M. de Louvois.\"\r\n\r\nThe Comte de Vermandois, the official registration of whose death bears\r\nthe date 1685, cannot have been twenty years a prisoner in 1691.\r\n\r\nSix years after the Man in the Mask had been thus delivered over to the\r\ncuriosity of the public, the ’Siecle de Louis XIV’ (2 vols. octavo,\r\nBerlin, 1751) was published by Voltaire under the pseudonym of M. de\r\nFrancheville. Everyone turned to this work, which had been long\r\nexpected, for details relating to the mysterious prisoner about whom\r\neveryone was talking.\r\n\r\nVoltaire ventured at length to speak more openly of the prisoner than\r\nanyone had hitherto done, and to treat as a matter of history \"an event\r\nlong ignored by all historians.\" (vol. ii. p. 11, 1st edition, chap.\r\nxxv.). He assigned an approximate date to the beginning of this\r\ncaptivity, \"some months after the death of Cardinal Mazarin\" (1661); he\r\ngave a description of the prisoner, who according to him was \"young and\r\ndark-complexioned; his figure was above the middle height and well\r\nproportioned; his features were exceedingly handsome, and his bearing\r\nwas noble. When he spoke his voice inspired interest; he never\r\ncomplained of his lot, and gave no hint as to his rank.\" Nor was the\r\nmask forgotten: \"The part which covered the chin was furnished with\r\nsteel springs, which allowed the prisoner to eat without uncovering his\r\nface.\" And, lastly, he fixed the date of the death of the nameless\r\ncaptive; who \"was buried,\" he says, \"in 1704., by night, in the parish\r\nchurch of Saint-Paul.\"\r\n\r\nVoltaire’s narrative coincided with the account given in the ’Memoires\r\nde Peyse’, save for the omission of the incident which, according to the\r\n’Memoires’, led in the first instance to the imprisonment of Giafer.\r\n\"The prisoner,\" says Voltaire, \"was sent to the Iles Sainte-Marguerite,\r\nand afterwards to the Bastille, in charge of a trusty official; he wore\r\nhis mask on the journey, and his escort had orders to shoot him if he\r\ntook it off. The Marquis de Louvois visited him while he was on the\r\nislands, and when speaking to him stood all the time in a respectful\r\nattitude. The prisoner was removed to the Bastille in 1690, where he was\r\nlodged as comfortably as could be managed in that building; he was\r\nsupplied with everything he asked for, especially with the finest linen\r\nand the costliest lace, in both of which his taste was perfect; he had a\r\nguitar to play on, his table was excellent, and the governor rarely sat\r\nin his presence.\"\r\n\r\nVoltaire added a few further details which had been given him by M. de\r\nBernaville, the successor of M. de Saint-Mars, and by an old physician\r\nof the Bastille who had attended the prisoner whenever his health\r\nrequired a doctor, but who had never seen his face, although he had\r\n\"often seen his tongue and his body.\" He also asserted that M. de\r\nChamillart was the last minister who was in the secret, and that when\r\nhis son-in-law, Marshal de la Feuillade, besought him on his knees, de\r\nChamillart being on his deathbed, to tell him the name of the Man in the\r\nIron Mask, the minister replied that he was under a solemn oath never to\r\nreveal the secret, it being an affair of state. To all these details,\r\nwhich the marshal acknowledges to be correct, Voltaire adds a remarkable\r\nnote: \"What increases our wonder is, that when the unknown captive was\r\nsent to the Iles Sainte-Marguerite no personage of note disappeared from\r\nthe European stage.\"\r\n\r\nThe story of the Comte de Vermandois and the blow was treated as an\r\nabsurd and romantic invention, which does not even attempt to keep\r\nwithin the bounds of the possible, by Baron C. (according to P.\r\nMarchand, Baron Crunyngen) in a letter inserted in the ’Bibliotheque\r\nraisonnee des Ouvrages des Savants de d’Europe’, June 1745. The\r\ndiscussion was revived somewhat later, however, and a few Dutch scholars\r\nwere supposed to be responsible for a new theory founded on history; the\r\nfoundations proving somewhat shaky, however,—a quality which it shares,\r\nwe must say, with all the other theories which have ever been advanced.\r\n\r\nAccording to this new theory, the masked prisoner was a young foreign\r\nnobleman, groom of the chambers to Anne of Austria, and the real father\r\nof Louis XIV. This anecdote appears first in a duodecimo volume printed\r\nby Pierre Marteau at Cologne in 1692, and which bears the title, ’The\r\nLoves of Anne of Austria, Consort of Louis XIII, with M. le C. D. R.,\r\nthe Real Father of Louis XIV, King of France; being a Minute Account of\r\nthe Measures taken to give an Heir to the Throne of France, the\r\nInfluences at Work to bring this to pass, and the Denoument of the\r\nComedy’.\r\n\r\nThis libel ran through five editions, bearing date successively, 1692,\r\n1693, 1696, 1722, and 1738. In the title of the edition of 1696 the\r\nwords \"Cardinal de Richelieu\" are inserted in place of the initials \"C.\r\nD. R.,\" but that this is only a printer’s error everyone who reads the\r\nwork will perceive. Some have thought the three letters stood for Comte\r\nde Riviere, others for Comte de Rochefort, whose ’Memoires’ compiled by\r\nSandras de Courtilz supply these initials. The author of the book was an\r\nOrange writer in the pay of William III, and its object was, he says,\r\n\"to unveil the great mystery of iniquity which hid the true origin of\r\nLouis XIV.\" He goes on to remark that \"the knowledge of this fraud,\r\nalthough comparatively rare outside France, was widely spread within her\r\nborders. The well-known coldness of Louis XIII; the extraordinary birth\r\nof Louis-Dieudonne, so called because he was born in the twenty-third\r\nyear of a childless marriage, and several other remarkable circumstances\r\nconnected with the birth, all point clearly to a father other than the\r\nprince, who with great effrontery is passed off by his adherents as\r\nsuch. The famous barricades of Paris, and the organised revolt led by\r\ndistinguished men against Louis XIV on his accession to the throne,\r\nproclaimed aloud the king’s illegitimacy, so that it rang through the\r\ncountry; and as the accusation had reason on its side, hardly anyone\r\ndoubted its truth.\"\r\n\r\nWe give below a short abstract of the narrative, the plot of which is\r\nrather skilfully constructed:—\r\n\r\n\"Cardinal Richelieu, looking with satisfied pride at the love of Gaston,\r\nDuc d’Orleans, brother of the king, for his niece Parisiatis (Madame de\r\nCombalet), formed the plan of uniting the young couple in marriage.\r\nGaston taking the suggestion as an insult, struck the cardinal. Pere\r\nJoseph then tried to gain the cardinal’s consent and that of his niece\r\nto an attempt to deprive Gaston of the throne, which the childless\r\nmarriage of Louis XIII seemed to assure him. A young man, the C. D. R.\r\nof the book, was introduced into Anne of Austria’s room, who though a\r\nwife in name had long been a widow in reality. She defended herself but\r\nfeebly, and on seeing the cardinal next day said to him, ’Well, you have\r\nhad your wicked will; but take good care, sir cardinal, that I may find\r\nabove the mercy and goodness which you have tried by many pious\r\nsophistries to convince me is awaiting me. Watch over my soul, I charge\r\nyou, for I have yielded!’ The queen having given herself up to love for\r\nsome time, the joyful news that she would soon become a mother began to\r\nspread over the kingdom. In this manner was born Louis XIV, the putative\r\nson of Louis XIII. If this instalment of the tale be favourably\r\nreceived, says the pamphleteer, the sequel will soon follow, in which\r\nthe sad fate of C. D. R. will be related, who was made to pay dearly for\r\nhis short-lived pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the first part was a great success, the promised sequel never\r\nappeared. It must be admitted that such a story, though it never\r\nconvinced a single person of the illegitimacy of Louis XIV, was an\r\nexcellent prologue to the tale of the unfortunate lot of the Man in the\r\nIron Mask, and increased the interest and curiosity with which that\r\nsingular historical mystery was regarded. But the views of the Dutch\r\nscholars thus set forth met with little credence, and were soon\r\nforgotten in a new solution.\r\n\r\nThe third historian to write about the prisoner of the Iles\r\nSainte-Marguerite was Lagrange-Chancel. He was just twenty-nine years of\r\nage when, excited by Freron’s hatred of Voltaire, he addressed a letter\r\nfrom his country place, Antoniat, in Perigord, to the ’Annee Litteraire’\r\n(vol. iii. p. 188), demolishing the theory advanced in the ’Siecle de\r\nLouis XIV’, and giving facts which he had collected whilst himself\r\nimprisoned in the same place as the unknown prisoner twenty years later.\r\n\r\n\"My detention in the Iles-Saint-Marguerite,\" says Lagrange-Chancel,\"\r\nbrought many things to my knowledge which a more painstaking historian\r\nthan M. de Voltaire would have taken the trouble to find out; for at the\r\ntime when I was taken to the islands the imprisonment of the Man in the\r\nIron Mask was no longer regarded as a state secret. This extraordinary\r\nevent, which M. de Voltaire places in 1662, a few months after the death\r\nof Cardinal Mazarin, did not take place till 1669, eight years after the\r\ndeath of His Eminence. M. de La Motte-Guerin, commandant of the islands\r\nin my time, assured me that the prisoner was the Duc de Beaufort, who\r\nwas reported killed at the siege of Candia, but whose body had never\r\nbeen recovered, as all the narratives of that event agree in stating. He\r\nalso told me that M. de Saint-Mars, who succeeded Pignerol as governor\r\nof the islands, showed great consideration for the prisoner, that he\r\nwaited on him at table, that the service was of silver, and that the\r\nclothes supplied to the prisoner were as costly as he desired; that when\r\nhe was ill and in need of a physician or surgeon, he was obliged under\r\npain of death to wear his mask in their presence, but that when he was\r\nalone he was permitted to pull out the hairs of his beard with steel\r\ntweezers, which were kept bright and polished. I saw a pair of these\r\nwhich had been actually used for this purpose in the possession of M. de\r\nFormanoir, nephew of Saint-Mars, and lieutenant of a Free Company raised\r\nfor the purpose of guarding the prisoners. Several persons told me that\r\nwhen Saint-Mars, who had been placed over the Bastille, conducted his\r\ncharge thither, the latter was heard to say behind his iron mask, ’Has\r\nthe king designs on my life?’ To which Saint-Mars replied, ’No, my\r\nprince; your life is safe: you must only let yourself be guided.’\r\n\r\n\"I also learned from a man called Dubuisson, cashier to the well-known\r\nSamuel Bernard, who, having been imprisoned for some years in the\r\nBastile, was removed to the Iles Sainte-Marguerite, where he was\r\nconfined along with some others in a room exactly over the one occupied\r\nby the unknown prisoner. He told me that they were able to communicate\r\nwith him by means of the flue of the chimney, but on asking him why he\r\npersisted in not revealing his name and the cause of his imprisonment,\r\nhe replied that such an avowal would be fatal not only to him but to\r\nthose to whom he made it.\r\n\r\n\"Whether it were so or not, to-day the name and rank of this political\r\nvictim are secrets the preservation of which is no longer necessary to\r\nthe State; and I have thought that to tell the public what I know would\r\ncut short the long chain of circumstances which everyone was forging\r\naccording to his fancy, instigated thereto by an author whose gift of\r\nrelating the most impossible events in such a manner as to make them\r\nseem true has won for all his writings such success—even for his Vie de\r\nCharles XII\"\r\n\r\nThis theory, according to Jacob, is more probable than any of the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\"Beginning with the year 1664.,\" he says, \"the Duc de Beaufort had by\r\nhis insubordination and levity endangered the success of several\r\nmaritime expeditions. In October 1666 Louis XIV remonstrated with him\r\nwith much tact, begging him to try to make himself more and more capable\r\nin the service of his king by cultivating the talents with which he was\r\nendowed, and ridding himself of the faults which spoilt his conduct. ’I\r\ndo not doubt,’ he concludes, ’that you will be all the more grateful to\r\nme for this mark of my benevolence towards you, when you reflect how few\r\nkings have ever shown their goodwill in a similar manner.’\" ( ’Oeuvres\r\nde Louis XIV’, vol. v. p. 388). Several calamities in the royal navy are\r\nknown to have been brought about by the Duc de Beaufort. M. Eugene Sue,\r\nin his ’Histoire de la Marine’, which is full of new and curious\r\ninformation, has drawn a very good picture of the position of the \"roi\r\ndes halles,\" the \"king of the markets,\" in regard to Colbert and Louis\r\nXIV. Colbert wished to direct all the manoeuvres of the fleet from his\r\nstudy, while it was commanded by the naval grandmaster in the capricious\r\nmanner which might be expected from his factious character and love of\r\nbluster (Eugene Sue, vol. i., ’Pieces Justificatives’). In 1699 Louis\r\nXIV sent the Duc de Beaufort to the relief of Candia, which the Turks\r\nwere besieging. Seven hours after his arrival Beaufort was killed in a\r\nsortie. The Duc de Navailles, who shared with him the command of the\r\nFrench squadron, simply reported his death as follows: \"He met a body of\r\nTurks who were pressing our troops hard: placing himself at the head of\r\nthe latter, he fought valiantly, but at length his soldiers abandoned\r\nhim, and we have not been able to learn his fate\" (’Memoires du Duc de\r\nNavailles’, book iv. P. 243)\r\n\r\nThe report of his death spread rapidly through France and Italy;\r\nmagnificent funeral services were held in Paris, Rome, and Venice, and\r\nfuneral orations delivered. Nevertheless, many believed that he would\r\none day reappear, as his body had never been recovered.\r\n\r\nGuy Patin mentions this belief, which he did not share, in two of his\r\nletters:—\r\n\r\n\"Several wagers have been laid that M. de Beaufort is not dead! ’O\r\nutinam’!\" (Guy Patin, September 26, 1669).\r\n\r\n\"It is said that M. de Vivonne has been granted by commission the post\r\nof vice-admiral of France for twenty years; but there are many who\r\nbelieve that the Duc de Beaufort is not dead, but imprisoned in some\r\nTurkish island. Believe this who may, I don’t; he is really dead, and\r\nthe last thing I should desire would be to be as dead as he\",(Ibid.,\r\nJanuary 14, 1670).\r\n\r\nThe following are the objections to this theory:\r\n\r\n\"In several narratives written by eye-witnesses of the siege of Candia,\"\r\nsays Jacob, \"it is related that the Turks, according to their custom,\r\ndespoiled the body and cut off the head of the Duc de Beaufort on the\r\nfield of battle, and that the latter was afterwards exhibited at\r\nConstantinople; and this may account for some of the details given by\r\nSandras de Courtilz in his ’Memoires du Marquis de Montbrun’ and his\r\n’Memoires d’Artagnan’, for one can easily imagine that the naked,\r\nheadless body might escape recognition. M. Eugene Sue, in his ’Histoire\r\nde la Marine’ (vol. ii, chap. 6), had adopted this view, which coincides\r\nwith the accounts left by Philibert de Jarry and the Marquis de Ville,\r\nthe MSS. of whose letters and ’Memoires’ are to be found in the\r\nBibliotheque du Roi.\r\n\r\n\"In the first volume of the ’Histoire de la Detention des Philosophes et\r\ndes Gens de Lettres a la Bastille, etc.’, we find the following\r\npassage:—\r\n\r\n\"Without dwelling on the difficulty and danger of an abduction, which an\r\nOttoman scimitar might any day during this memorable siege render\r\nunnecessary, we shall restrict ourselves to declaring positively that\r\nthe correspondence of Saint-Mars from 1669 to 1680 gives us no ground\r\nfor supposing that the governor of Pignerol had any great prisoner of\r\nstate in his charge during that period of time, except Fouquet and\r\nLauzun.’\"\r\n\r\nWhile we profess no blind faith in the conclusions arrived at by the\r\nlearned critic, we would yet add to the considerations on which he\r\nrelies another, viz. that it is most improbable that Louis XIV should\r\never have considered it necessary to take such rigorous measures against\r\nthe Duc de Beaufort. Truculent and self-confident as he was, he never\r\nacted against the royal authority in such a manner as to oblige the king\r\nto strike him down in secret; and it is difficult to believe that Louis\r\nXIV, peaceably seated on his throne, with all the enemies of his\r\nminority under his feet, should have revenged himself on the duke as an\r\nold Frondeur.\r\n\r\nThe critic calls our attention to another fact also adverse to the\r\ntheory under consideration. The Man in the Iron Mask loved fine linen\r\nand rich lace, he was reserved in character and possessed of extreme\r\nrefinement, and none of this suits the portraits of the ’roi des halles’\r\nwhich contemporary historians have drawn.\r\n\r\nRegarding the anagram of the name Marchiali (the name under which the\r\ndeath of the prisoner was registered), ’hic amiral’, as a proof, we\r\ncannot think that the gaolers of Pignerol amused themselves in\r\npropounding conundrums to exercise the keen intellect of their\r\ncontemporaries; and moreover the same anagram would apply equally well\r\nto the Count of Vermandois, who was made admiral when only twenty-two\r\nmonths old. Abbe Papon, in his roamings through Provence, paid a visit\r\nto the prison in which the Iron Mask was confined, and thus speaks:—\r\n\r\n\"It was to the Iles Sainte-Marguerite that the famous prisoner with the\r\niron mask whose name has never been discovered, was transported at the\r\nend of the last century; very few of those attached to his service were\r\nallowed to speak to him. One day, as M. de Saint-Mars was conversing\r\nwith him, standing outside his door, in a kind of corridor, so as to be\r\nable to see from a distance everyone who approached, the son of one of\r\nthe governor’s friends, hearing the voices, came up; Saint-Mars quickly\r\nclosed the door of the room, and, rushing to meet the young man, asked\r\nhim with an air of great anxiety if he had overheard anything that was\r\nsaid. Having convinced himself that he had heard nothing, the governor\r\nsent the young man away the same day, and wrote to the father that the\r\nadventure was like to have cost the son dear, and that he had sent him\r\nback to his home to prevent any further imprudence.\r\n\r\n\"I was curious enough to visit the room in which the unfortunate man was\r\nimprisoned, on the 2nd of February 1778. It is lighted by one window to\r\nthe north, overlooking the sea, about fifteen feet above the terrace\r\nwhere the sentries paced to and fro. This window was pierced through a\r\nvery thick wall and the embrasure barricaded by three iron bars, thus\r\nseparating the prisoner from the sentries by a distance of over two\r\nfathoms. I found an officer of the Free Company in the fortress who was\r\nnigh on fourscore years old; he told me that his father, who had\r\nbelonged to the same Company, had often related to him how a friar had\r\nseen something white floating on the water under the prisoner’s window.\r\nOn being fished out and carried to M. de Saint-Mars, it proved to be a\r\nshirt of very fine material, loosely folded together, and covered with\r\nwriting from end to end. M. de Saint-Mars spread it out and read a few\r\nwords, then turning to the friar who had brought it he asked him in an\r\nembarrassed manner if he had been led by curiosity to read any of the,\r\nwriting. The friar protested repeatedly that he had not read a line, but\r\nnevertheless he was found dead in bed two days later. This incident was\r\ntold so often to my informant by his father and by the chaplain of the\r\nfort of that time that he regarded it as incontestably true. The\r\nfollowing fact also appears to me to be equally well established by the\r\ntestimony of many witnesses. I collected all the evidence I could on the\r\nspot, and also in the Lerins monastery, where the tradition is\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\n\"A female attendant being wanted for the prisoner, a woman of the\r\nvillage of Mongin offered herself for the place, being under the\r\nimpression that she would thus be able to make her children’s fortune;\r\nbut on being told that she would not only never be allowed to see her\r\nchildren again, but would be cut off from the rest of the world as well,\r\nshe refused to be shut up with a prisoner whom it cost so much to serve.\r\nI may mention here that at the two outer angles of the wall of the fort\r\nwhich faced the sea two sentries were placed, with orders to fire on any\r\nboat which approached within a certain distance.\r\n\r\n\"The prisoner’s personal attendant died in the Iles Sainte-Marguerite.\r\nThe brother of the officer whom I mentioned above was partly in the\r\nconfidence of M. de Saint-Mars, and he often told how he was summoned to\r\nthe prison once at midnight and ordered to remove a corpse, and that he\r\ncarried it on his shoulders to the burial-place, feeling certain it was\r\nthe prisoner who was dead; but it was only his servant, and it was then\r\nthat an effort was made to supply his place by a female attendant.\"\r\n\r\nAbbe Papon gives some curious details, hitherto unknown to the public,\r\nbut as he mentions no names his narrative cannot be considered as\r\nevidence. Voltaire never replied to Lagrange-Chancel, who died the same\r\nyear in which his letter was published. Freron desiring to revenge\r\nhimself for the scathing portrait which Voltaire had drawn of him in the\r\n’Ecossaise’, called to his assistance a more redoubtable adversary than\r\nLagrange-Chancel. Sainte-Foix had brought to the front a brand new\r\ntheory, founded on a passage by Hume in an article in the ’Annee\r\nLitteraire (1768, vol. iv.), in which he maintained that the Man in the\r\nIron Mask was the Duke of Monmouth, a natural son of Charles II, who was\r\nfound guilty of high treason and beheaded in London on the 15th July\r\n1685.\r\n\r\nThis is what the English historian says:\r\n\r\n\"It was commonly reported in London that the Duke of Monmouth’s life had\r\nbeen saved, one of his adherents who bore a striking resemblance to the\r\nduke having consented to die in his stead, while the real culprit was\r\nsecretly carried off to France, there to undergo a lifelong\r\nimprisonment.\"\r\n\r\nThe great affection which the English felt for the Duke of Monmouth, and\r\nhis own conviction that the people only needed a leader to induce them\r\nto shake off the yoke of James II, led him to undertake an enterprise\r\nwhich might possibly have succeeded had it been carried out with\r\nprudence. He landed at Lyme, in Dorset, with only one hundred and twenty\r\nmen; six thousand soon gathered round his standard; a few towns declared\r\nin his favour; he caused himself to be proclaimed king, affirming that\r\nhe was born in wedlock, and that he possessed the proofs of the secret\r\nmarriage of Charles II and Lucy Waiters, his mother. He met the\r\nRoyalists on the battlefield, and victory seemed to be on his side, when\r\njust at the decisive moment his ammunition ran short. Lord Gray, who\r\ncommanded the cavalry, beat a cowardly retreat, the unfortunate Monmouth\r\nwas taken prisoner, brought to London, and beheaded.\r\n\r\nThe details published in the ’Siecle de Louis XIV’ as to the personal\r\nappearance of the masked prisoner might have been taken as a description\r\nof Monmouth, who possessed great physical beauty. Sainte-Foix had\r\ncollected every scrap of evidence in favour of his solution of the\r\nmystery, making use even of the following passage from an anonymous\r\nromance called ’The Loves of Charles II and James II, Kings of\r\nEngland’:—\r\n\r\n\"The night of the pretended execution of the Duke of Monmouth, the king,\r\nattended by three men, came to the Tower and summoned the duke to his\r\npresence. A kind of loose cowl was thrown over his head, and he was put\r\ninto a carriage, into which the king and his attendants also got, and\r\nwas driven away.\"\r\n\r\nSainte-Foix also referred to the alleged visit of Saunders, confessor to\r\nJames II, paid to the Duchess of Portsmouth after the death of that\r\nmonarch, when the duchess took occasion to say that she could never\r\nforgive King James for consenting to Monmouth’s execution, in spite of\r\nthe oath he had taken on the sacred elements at the deathbed of Charles\r\nII that he would never take his natural brother’s life, even in case of\r\nrebellion. To this the priest replied quickly, \"The king kept his oath.\"\r\n\r\nHume also records this solemn oath, but we cannot say that all the\r\nhistorians agree on this point. ’The Universal History’ by Guthrie and\r\nGray, and the ’Histoire d’Angleterre’ by Rapin, Thoyras and de Barrow,\r\ndo not mention it.\r\n\r\n\"Further,\" wrote Sainte-Foix, \"an English surgeon called Nelaton, who\r\nfrequented the Cafe Procope, much affected by men of letters, often\r\nrelated that during the time he was senior apprentice to a surgeon who\r\nlived near the Porte Saint-Antoine, he was once taken to the Bastille to\r\nbleed a prisoner. He was conducted to this prisoner’s room by the\r\ngovernor himself, and found the patient suffering from violent headache.\r\nHe spoke with an English accent, wore a gold-flowered dressing-gown of\r\nblack and orange, and had his face covered by a napkin knotted behind\r\nhis head.\"\r\n\r\nThis story does not hold water: it would be difficult to form a mask out\r\nof a napkin; the Bastille had a resident surgeon of its own as well as a\r\nphysician and apothecary; no one could gain access to a prisoner without\r\na written order from a minister, even the Viaticum could only be\r\nintroduced by the express permission of the lieutenant of police.\r\n\r\nThis theory met at first with no objections, and seemed to be going to\r\noust all the others, thanks, perhaps, to the combative and restive\r\ncharacter of its promulgator, who bore criticism badly, and whom no one\r\ncared to incense, his sword being even more redoubtable than his pen.\r\n\r\nIt was known that when Saint-Mars journeyed with his prisoner to the\r\nBastille, they had put up on the way at Palteau, in Champagne, a\r\nproperty belonging to the governor. Freron therefore addressed himself\r\nto a grand-nephew of Saint-Mars, who had inherited this estate, asking\r\nif he could give him any information about this visit. The following\r\nreply appeared in the ’Annee Litteraire (June 1768):—\r\n\r\n\"As it appears from the letter of M. de Sainte-Foix from which you quote\r\nthat the Man in the Iron Mask still exercises the fancy of your\r\njournalists, I am willing to tell you all I know about the prisoner. He\r\nwas known in the islands of Sainte-Marguerite and at the Bastille as ’La\r\nTour.’ The governor and all the other officials showed him great\r\nrespect, and supplied him with everything he asked for that could be\r\ngranted to a prisoner. He often took exercise in the yard of the prison,\r\nbut never without his mask on. It was not till the ’Siecle’ of M. de\r\nVoltaire appeared that I learned that the mask was of iron and furnished\r\nwith springs; it may be that the circumstance was overlooked, but he\r\nnever wore it except when taking the air, or when he had to appear\r\nbefore a stranger.\r\n\r\n\"M. de Blainvilliers, an infantry officer who was acquainted with M. de\r\nSaint-Mars both at Pignerol and Sainte-Marguerite, has often told me\r\nthat the lot of ’La Tour’ greatly excited his curiosity, and that he had\r\nonce borrowed the clothes and arms of a soldier whose turn it was to be\r\nsentry on the terrace under the prisoner’s window at Sainte-Marguerite,\r\nand undertaken the duty himself; that he had seen the prisoner\r\ndistinctly, without his mask; that his face was white, that he was tall\r\nand well proportioned, except that his ankles were too thick, and that\r\nhis hair was white, although he appeared to be still in the prime of\r\nlife. He passed the whole of the night in question pacing to and fro in\r\nhis room. Blainvilliers added that he was always dressed in brown, that\r\nhe had plenty of fine linen and books, that the governor and the other\r\nofficers always stood uncovered in his presence till he gave them leave\r\nto cover and sit down, and that they often bore him company at table.\r\n\r\n\"In 1698 M. de Saint-Mars was promoted from the governorship of the Iles\r\nSainte-Marguerite to that of the Bastille. In moving thither,\r\naccompanied by his prisoner, he made his estate of Palteau a\r\nhalting-place. The masked man arrived in a litter which preceded that of\r\nM. de Saint-Mars, and several mounted men rode beside it. The peasants\r\nwere assembled to greet their liege lord. M. de Saint-Mars dined with\r\nhis prisoner, who sat with his back to the dining-room windows, which\r\nlooked out on the court. None of the peasants whom I have questioned\r\nwere able to see whether the man kept his mask on while eating, but they\r\nall noticed that M. de Saint-Mars, who sat opposite to his charge, laid\r\ntwo pistols beside his plate; that only one footman waited at table, who\r\nwent into the antechamber to change the plates and dishes, always\r\ncarefully closing the dining-room door behind him. When the prisoner\r\ncrossed the courtyard his face was covered with a black mask, but the\r\npeasants could see his lips and teeth, and remarked that he was tall,\r\nand had white hair. M. de Saint-Mars slept in a bed placed beside the\r\nprisoner’s. M. de Blainvilliers told me also that ’as soon as he was\r\ndead, which happened in 1704, he was buried at Saint-Paul’s,’ and that\r\n’the coffin was filled with substances which would rapidly consume the\r\nbody.’ He added, ’I never heard that the masked man spoke with an\r\nEnglish accent.’\"\r\n\r\nSainte-Foix proved the story related by M. de Blainvilliers to be little\r\nworthy of belief, showing by a circumstance mentioned in the letter that\r\nthe imprisoned man could not be the Duc de Beaufort; witness the epigram\r\nof Madame de Choisy, \"M. de Beaufort longs to bite and can’t,\" whereas\r\nthe peasants had seen the prisoner’s teeth through his mask. It appeared\r\nas if the theory of Sainte-Foix were going to stand, when a Jesuit\r\nfather, named Griffet, who was confessor at the Bastille, devoted\r\nchapter xiii, of his ’Traite des differentes Sortes de Preuves qui\r\nservent a etablir la Verite dans l’Histoire’ (12mo, Liege, 1769) to the\r\nconsideration of the Iron Mask. He was the first to quote an authentic\r\ndocument which certifies that the Man in the Iron Mask about whom there\r\nwas so much disputing really existed. This was the written journal of M.\r\ndu Jonca, King’s Lieutenant in the Bastille in 1698, from which Pere\r\nGriffet took the following passage:—\r\n\r\n\"On Thursday, September the 8th, 1698, at three o’clock in the\r\nafternoon, M. de Saint-Mars, the new governor of the Bastille, entered\r\nupon his duties. He arrived from the islands of Sainte-Marguerite,\r\nbringing with him in a litter a prisoner whose name is a secret, and\r\nwhom he had had under his charge there, and at Pignerol. This prisoner,\r\nwho was always masked, was at first placed in the Bassiniere tower,\r\nwhere he remained until the evening. At nine o’clock p.m. I took him to\r\nthe third room of the Bertaudiere tower, which I had had already\r\nfurnished before his arrival with all needful articles, having received\r\norders to do so from M. de Saint-Mars. While I was showing him the way\r\nto his room, I was accompanied by M. Rosarges, who had also arrived\r\nalong with M. de Saint-Mars, and whose office it was to wait on the said\r\nprisoner, whose table is to be supplied by the governor.\"\r\n\r\nDu Jonca’s diary records the death of the prisoner in the following\r\nterms:—\r\n\r\n\"Monday, 19th November 1703. The unknown prisoner, who always wore a\r\nblack velvet mask, and whom M. de Saint-Mars brought with him from the\r\nIles Sainte-Marguerite, and whom he had so long in charge, felt slightly\r\nunwell yesterday on coming back from mass. He died to-day at 10 p.m.\r\nwithout having a serious illness, indeed it could not have been\r\nslighter. M. Guiraut, our chaplain, confessed him yesterday, but as his\r\ndeath was quite unexpected he did not receive the last sacraments,\r\nalthough the chaplain was able to exhort him up to the moment of his\r\ndeath. He was buried on Tuesday the 20th November at 4 P.M. in the\r\nburial-ground of St. Paul’s, our parish church. The funeral expenses\r\namounted to 40 livres.\"\r\n\r\nHis name and age were withheld from the priests of the parish. The entry\r\nmade in the parish register, which Pere Griffet also gives, is in the\r\nfollowing words:—\r\n\r\n\"On the 19th November 1703, Marchiali, aged about forty-five, died in\r\nthe Bastille, whose body was buried in the graveyard of Saint-Paul’s,\r\nhis parish, on the 20th instant, in the presence of M. Rosarges and of\r\nM. Reilh, Surgeon-Major of the Bastille.\r\n\r\n\"(Signed) ROSARGES.\r\n\r\n\"REILH.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was dead everything belonging to him, without exception,\r\nwas burned; such as his linen, clothes, bed and bedding, rugs, chairs,\r\nand even the doors of the room he occupied. His service of plate was\r\nmelted down, the walls of his room were scoured and whitewashed, the\r\nvery floor was renewed, from fear of his having hidden a note under it,\r\nor left some mark by which he could be recognised.\r\n\r\nPere Griffet did not agree with the opinions of either Lagrange-Chancel\r\nor Sainte-Foix, but seemed to incline towards the theory set forth in\r\nthe ’Memoires de Perse’, against which no irrefutable objections had\r\nbeen advanced. He concluded by saying that before arriving at any\r\ndecision as to who the prisoner really was, it would be necessary to\r\nascertain the exact date of his arrival at Pignerol.\r\n\r\nSainte-Foix hastened to reply, upholding the soundness of the views he\r\nhad advanced. He procured from Arras a copy of an entry in the registers\r\nof the Cathedral Chapter, stating that Louis XIV had written with his\r\nown hand to the said Chapter that they were to admit to burial the body\r\nof the Comte de Vermandois, who had died in the city of Courtrai; that\r\nhe desired that the deceased should be interred in the centre of the\r\nchoir, in the vault in which lay the remains of Elisabeth, Comtesse de\r\nVermandois, wife of Philip of Alsace, Comte de Flanders, who had died in\r\n1182. It is not to be supposed that Louis XIV would have chosen a family\r\nvault in which to bury a log of wood.\r\n\r\nSainte-Foix was, however, not acquainted with the letter of Barbezieux,\r\ndated the 13th August 1691, to which we have already referred, as a\r\nproof that the prisoner was not the Comte de Vermandois; it is equally a\r\nproof that he was not the Duke of Monmouth, as Sainte-Foix maintained;\r\nfor sentence was passed on the Duke of Monmouth in 1685, so that it\r\ncould not be of him either that Barbezieux wrote in 1691, \"The prisoner\r\nwhom you have had in charge for twenty years.\"\r\n\r\nIn the very year in which Sainte-Foix began to flatter himself that his\r\ntheory was successfully established, Baron Heiss brought a new one\r\nforward, in a letter dated \"Phalsburg, 28th June 1770,\" and addressed to\r\nthe ’Journal Enclycopedique’. It was accompanied by a letter translated\r\nfrom the Italian which appeared in the ’Histoire Abregee de l’Europe’ by\r\nJacques Bernard, published by Claude Jordan, Leyden, 1685-87, in\r\ndetached sheets. This letter stated (August 1687, article ’Mantoue’)\r\nthat the Duke of Mantua being desirous to sell his capital, Casale, to\r\nthe King of France, had been dissuaded therefrom by his secretary, and\r\ninduced to join the other princes of Italy in their endeavours to thwart\r\nthe ambitious schemes of Louis XVI. The Marquis d’Arcy, French\r\nambassador to the court of Savoy, having been informed of the\r\nsecretary’s influence, distinguished him by all kinds of civilities,\r\nasked him frequently to table, and at last invited him to join a large\r\nhunting party two or three leagues outside Turin. They set out together,\r\nbut at a short distance from the city were surrounded by a dozen\r\nhorsemen, who carried off the secretary, ’disguised him, put a mask on\r\nhim, and took him to Pignerol.’ He was not kept long in this fortress,\r\nas it was ’too near the Italian frontier, and although he was carefully\r\nguarded it was feared that the walls would speak’; so he was transferred\r\nto the Iles Sainte-Marguerite, where he is at present in the custody of\r\nM. de Saint-Mars.\r\n\r\nThis theory, of which much was heard later, did not at first excite much\r\nattention. What is certain is that the Duke of Mantua’s secretary, by\r\nname Matthioli, was arrested in 1679 through the agency of Abbe\r\nd’Estrade and M. de Catinat, and taken with the utmost secrecy to\r\nPignerol, where he was imprisoned and placed in charge of M. de\r\nSaint-Mars. He must not, however, be confounded with the Man in the Iron\r\nMask.\r\n\r\nCatinat says of Matthioli in a letter to Louvois \"No one knows the name\r\nof this knave.\"\r\n\r\nLouvois writes to Saint-Mars: \"I admire your patience in waiting for an\r\norder to treat such a rogue as he deserves, when he treats you with\r\ndisrespect.\"\r\n\r\nSaint-Mars replies to the minister: \"I have charged Blainvilliers to\r\nshow him a cudgel and tell him that with its aid we can make the froward\r\nmeek.\"\r\n\r\nAgain Louvois writes: \"The clothes of such people must be made to last\r\nthree or four years.\"\r\n\r\nThis cannot have been the nameless prisoner who was treated with such\r\nconsideration, before whom Louvois stood bare-headed, who was supplied\r\nwith fine linen and lace, and so on.\r\n\r\nAltogether, we gather from the correspondence of Saint-Mars that the\r\nunhappy man alluded to above was confined along with a mad Jacobin, and\r\nat last became mad himself, and succumbed to his misery in 1686.\r\n\r\nVoltaire, who was probably the first to supply such inexhaustible food\r\nfor controversy, kept silence and took no part in the discussions. But\r\nwhen all the theories had been presented to the public, he set about\r\nrefuting them. He made himself very merry, in the seventh edition of\r\n’Questions sur l’Encyclopedie distibuees en forme de Dictionnaire\r\n(Geneva, 1791), over the complaisance attributed to Louis XIV in acting\r\nas police-sergeant and gaoler for James II, William III, and Anne, with\r\nall of whom he was at war. Persisting still in taking 1661 or 1662 as\r\nthe date when the incarceration of the masked prisoner began, he attacks\r\nthe opinions advanced by Lagrange-Chancel and Pere Griffet, which they\r\nhad drawn from the anonymous ’Memoires secrets pour servir a l’Histoire\r\nde Perse’. \"Having thus dissipated all these illusions,\" he says, \"let\r\nus now consider who the masked prisoner was, and how old he was when he\r\ndied. It is evident that if he was never allowed to walk in the\r\ncourtyard of the Bastille or to see a physician without his mask, it\r\nmust have been lest his too striking resemblance to someone should be\r\nremarked; he could show his tongue but not his face. As regards his age,\r\nhe himself told the apothecary at the Bastille, a few days before his\r\ndeath, that he thought he was about sixty; this I have often heard from\r\na son-in-law to this apothecary, M. Marsoban, surgeon to Marshal\r\nRichelieu, and afterwards to the regent, the Duc d’Orleans. The writer\r\nof this article knows perhaps more on this subject than Pere Griffet.\r\nBut he has said his say.\"\r\n\r\nThis article in the ’Questions on the Encyclopaedia’ was followed by\r\nsome remarks from the pen of the publisher, which are also, however,\r\nattributed by the publishers of Kelh to Voltaire himself. The publisher,\r\nwho sometimes calls himself the author, puts aside without refutation\r\nall the theories advanced, including that of Baron Heiss, and says he\r\nhas come to the conclusion that the Iron Mask was, without doubt, a\r\nbrother and an elder brother of Louis XIV, by a lover of the queen. Anne\r\nof Austria had come to persuade herself that hers alone was the fault\r\nwhich had deprived Louis XIII [the publisher of this edition overlooked\r\nthe obvious typographical error of \"XIV\" here when he meant, and it only\r\nmakes sense, that it was XIII. D.W.] of an heir, but the birth of the\r\nIron Mask undeceived her. The cardinal, to whom she confided her secret,\r\ncleverly arranged to bring the king and queen, who had long lived apart,\r\ntogether again. A second son was the result of this reconciliation; and\r\nthe first child being removed in secret, Louis XIV remained in ignorance\r\nof the existence of his half-brother till after his majority. It was the\r\npolicy of Louis XIV to affect a great respect for the royal house, so he\r\navoided much embarrassment to himself and a scandal affecting the memory\r\nof Anne of Austria by adopting the wise and just measure of burying\r\nalive the pledge of an adulterous love. He was thus enabled to avoid\r\ncommitting an act of cruelty, which a sovereign less conscientious and\r\nless magnanimous would have considered a necessity.\r\n\r\nAfter this declaration Voltaire made no further reference to the Iron\r\nMask. This last version of the story upset that of Sainte-Foix. Voltaire\r\nhaving been initiated into the state secret by the Marquis de Richelieu,\r\nwe may be permitted to suspect that being naturally indiscreet he\r\npublished the truth from behind the shelter of a pseudonym, or at least\r\ngave a version which approached the truth, but later on realising the\r\ndangerous significance of his words, he preserved for the future\r\ncomplete silence.\r\n\r\nWe now approach the question whether the prince who thus became the Iron\r\nMask was an illegitimate brother or a twin-brother of Louis XIV. The\r\nfirst was maintained by M. Quentin-Crawfurd; the second by Abbe Soulavie\r\nin his ’Memoires du Marechal Duc de Richelieu’ (London, 1790). In 1783\r\nthe Marquis de Luchet, in the ’Journal des Gens du Monde’ (vol. iv. No.\r\n23, p. 282, et seq.), awarded to Buckingham the honour of the paternity\r\nin dispute. In support of this, he quoted the testimony of a lady of the\r\nhouse of Saint-Quentin who had been a mistress of the minister\r\nBarbezieux, and who died at Chartres about the middle of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. She had declared publicly that Louis XIV had consigned his\r\nelder brother to perpetual imprisonment, and that the mask was\r\nnecessitated by the close resemblance of the two brothers to each other.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Buckingham, who came to France in 1625, in order to escort\r\nHenrietta Maria, sister of Louis XIII, to England, where she was to\r\nmarry the Prince of Wales, made no secret of his ardent love for the\r\nqueen, and it is almost certain that she was not insensible to his\r\npassion. An anonymous pamphlet, ’La Conference du Cardinal Mazarin avec\r\nle Gazetier’ (Brussels, 1649), says that she was infatuated about him,\r\nand allowed him to visit her in her room. She even permitted him to take\r\noff and keep one of her gloves, and his vanity leading him to show his\r\nspoil, the king heard of it, and was vastly offended. An anecdote, the\r\ntruth of which no one has ever denied, relates that one day Buckingham\r\nspoke to the queen with such passion in the presence of her\r\nlady-in-waiting, the Marquise de Senecey, that the latter exclaimed, \"Be\r\nsilent, sir, you cannot speak thus to the Queen of France!\" According to\r\nthis version, the Man in the Iron Mask must have been born at latest in\r\n1637, but the mention of any such date would destroy the possibility of\r\nBuckingham’s paternity; for he was assassinated at Portsmouth on\r\nSeptember 2nd, 1628.\r\n\r\nAfter the taking of the Bastille the masked prisoner became the\r\nfashionable topic of discussion, and one heard of nothing else. On the\r\n13th of August 1789 it was announced in an article in a journal called\r\n’Loisirs d’un Patriote francais’, which was afterwards published\r\nanonymously as a pamphlet, that the publisher had seen, among other\r\ndocuments found in the Bastille, a card bearing the unintelligible\r\nnumber \"64389000,\" and the following note: \"Fouquet, arriving from Les\r\nIles Sainte-Marguerite in an iron mask.\" To this there was, it was said,\r\na double signature, viz. \"XXX,\" superimposed on the name \"Kersadion.\"\r\nThe journalist was of opinion that Fouquet had succeeded in making his\r\nescape, but had been retaken and condemned to pass for dead, and to wear\r\na mask henceforward, as a punishment for his attempted evasion. This\r\ntale made some impression, for it was remembered that in the Supplement\r\nto the ’Siecle de Louis XIV’ it was stated that Chamillart had said that\r\n\"the Iron Mask was a man who knew all the secrets of M. Fouquet.\" But\r\nthe existence of this card was never proved, and we cannot accept the\r\nstory on the unsupported word of an anonymous writer.\r\n\r\nFrom the time that restrictions on the press were removed, hardly a day\r\npassed without the appearance of some new pamphlet on the Iron Mask.\r\nLouis Dutens, in ’Correspondence interceptee’ (12mo, 1789), revived the\r\ntheory of Baron Heiss, supporting it by new and curious facts. He proved\r\nthat Louis XIV had really ordered one of the Duke of Mantua’s ministers\r\nto be carried off and imprisoned in Pignerol. Dutens gave the name of\r\nthe victim as Girolamo Magni. He also quoted from a memorandum which by\r\nthe wish of the Marquis de Castellane was drawn up by a certain Souchon,\r\nprobably the man whom Papon questioned in 1778. This Souchon was the son\r\nof a man who had belonged to the Free Company maintained in the islands\r\nin the time of Saint-Mars, and was seventy-nine years old. This\r\nmemorandum gives a detailed account of the abduction of a minister in\r\n1679, who is styled a \"minister of the Empire,\" and his arrival as a\r\nmasked prisoner at the islands, and states that he died there in\r\ncaptivity nine years after he was carried off.\r\n\r\nDutens thus divests the episode of the element of the marvellous with\r\nwhich Voltaire had surrounded it. He called to his aid the testimony of\r\nthe Duc de Choiseul, who, having in vain attempted to worm the secret of\r\nthe Iron Mask out of Louis XV, begged Madame de Pompadour to try her\r\nhand, and was told by her that the prisoner was the minister of an\r\nItalian prince. At the same time that Dutens wrote, \"There is no fact in\r\nhistory better established than the fact that the Man in the Iron Mask\r\nwas a minister of the Duke of Mantua who was carried off from Turin,\" M.\r\nQuentin-Crawfurd was maintaining that the prisoner was a son of Anne of\r\nAustria; while a few years earlier Bouche, a lawyer, in his ’Essai sur\r\nl’Histoire de Provence’ (2 vols. 4to, 1785), had regarded this story as\r\na fable invented by Voltaire, and had convinced himself that the\r\nprisoner was a woman. As we see, discussion threw no light on the\r\nsubject, and instead of being dissipated, the confusion became ever\r\n\"worse confounded.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1790 the ’Memoires du Marechal de Richelieu’ appeared. He had left\r\nhis note-books, his library, and his correspondence to Soulavie. The\r\n’Memoires’ are undoubtedly authentic, and have, if not certainty, at\r\nleast a strong moral presumption in their favour, and gained the belief\r\nof men holding diverse opinions. But before placing under the eyes of\r\nour readers extracts from them relating to the Iron Mask, let us refresh\r\nour memory by recalling two theories which had not stood the test of\r\nthorough investigation.\r\n\r\nAccording to some MS. notes left by M. de Bonac, French ambassador at\r\nConstantinople in 1724, the Armenian Patriarch Arwedicks, a mortal enemy\r\nof our Church and the instigator of the terrible persecutions to which\r\nthe Roman Catholics were subjected, was carried off into exile at the\r\nrequest of the Jesuits by a French vessel, and confined in a prison\r\nwhence there was no escape. This prison was the fortress of\r\nSainte-Marguerite, and from there he was taken to the Bastille, where he\r\ndied. The Turkish Government continually clamoured for his release till\r\n1723, but the French Government persistently denied having taken any\r\npart in the abduction.\r\n\r\nEven if it were not a matter of history that Arwedicks went over to the\r\nRoman Catholic Church and died a free man in Paris, as may be seen by an\r\ninspection of the certificate of his death preserved among the archives\r\nin the Foreign Office, one sentence from the note-book of M. de Bonac\r\nwould be sufficient to annihilate this theory. M. de Bonac says that the\r\nPatriarch was carried off, while M. de Feriol, who succeeded M. de\r\nChateauneuf in 1699, was ambassador at Constantinople. Now it was in\r\n1698 that Saint-Mars arrived at the Bastille with his masked prisoner.\r\n\r\nSeveral English scholars have sided with Gibbon in thinking that the Man\r\nin the Iron Mask might possibly have been Henry, the second son of\r\nOliver Cromwell, who was held as a hostage by Louis XIV.\r\n\r\nBy an odd coincidence the second son of the Lord Protector does entirely\r\ndisappear from the page of history in 1659; we know nothing of where he\r\nafterwards lived nor when he died. But why should he be a prisoner of\r\nstate in France, while his elder brother Richard was permitted to live\r\nthere quite openly? In the absence of all proof, we cannot attach the\r\nleast importance to this explanation of the mystery.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the promised extracts from the ’Memoires du Marechal de\r\nRichelieu’:\r\n\r\n\"Under the late king there was a time when every class of society was\r\nasking who the famous personage really was who went by the name of the\r\nIron Mask, but I noticed that this curiosity abated somewhat after his\r\narrival at the Bastille with Saint-Mars, when it began to be reported\r\nthat orders had been given to kill him should he let his name be known.\r\nSaint-Mars also let it be understood that whoever found out the secret\r\nwould share the same fate. This threat to murder both the prisoner and\r\nthose who showed too much curiosity about him made such an impression,\r\nthat during the lifetime of the late king people only spoke of the\r\nmystery below their breath. The anonymous author of ’Les Memoires de\r\nPerse’, which were published in Holland fifteen years after the death of\r\nLouis XIV, was the first who dared to speak publicly of the prisoner and\r\nrelate some anecdotes about him.\r\n\r\n\"Since the publication of that work, liberty of speech and the freedom\r\nof the press have made great strides, and the shade of Louis XIV having\r\nlost its terrors, the case of the Iron Mask is freely discussed, and yet\r\neven now, at the end of my life and seventy years after the death of the\r\nking, people are still asking who the Man in the Iron Mask really was.\r\n\r\n\"This question was one I put to the adorable princess, beloved of the\r\nregent, who inspired in return only aversion and respect, all her love\r\nbeing given to me. As everyone was persuaded that the regent knew the\r\nname, the course of life, and the cause of the imprisonment of the\r\nmasked prisoner, I, being more venturesome in my curiosity than others,\r\ntried through my princess to fathom the secret. She had hitherto\r\nconstantly repulsed the advances of the Duc d’ Orleans, but as the\r\nardour of his passion was thereby in no wise abated, the least glimpse\r\nof hope would be sufficient to induce him to grant her everything she\r\nasked; I persuaded her, therefore, to let him understand that if he\r\nwould allow her to read the ’Memoires du Masque’ which were in his\r\npossession his dearest desires would be fulfilled.\r\n\r\n\"The Duc d’Orleans had never been known to reveal any secret of state,\r\nbeing unspeakably circumspect, and having been trained to keep every\r\nconfidence inviolable by his preceptor Dubois, so I felt quite certain\r\nthat even the princess would fail in her efforts to get a sight of the\r\nmemoranda in his possession relative to the birth and rank of the masked\r\nprisoner; but what cannot love, and such an ardent love, induce a man to\r\ndo?\r\n\r\n\"To reward her goodness the regent gave the documents into her hands,\r\nand she forwarded them to me next day, enclosed in a note written in\r\ncipher, which, according to the laws of historical writing, I reproduce\r\nin its entirety, vouching for its authenticity; for the princess always\r\nemployed a cipher when she used the language of gallantry, and this note\r\ntold me what treaty she had had to sign in order that she might obtain\r\nthe documents, and the duke the desire of his heart. The details are not\r\nadmissible in serious history, but, borrowing the modest language of the\r\npatriarchal time, I may say that if Jacob, before he obtained possession\r\nof the best beloved of Laban’s daughters, was obliged to pay the price\r\ntwice over, the regent drove a better bargain than the patriarch.

His brother, who is now on\r\nthe throne, was born at noon while the king was at dinner, but whereas\r\nhis birth was splendid and public, that of his brother was sad and\r\nsecret; for the king being informed by the midwife that the queen was\r\nabout to give birth to a second child, ordered the chancellor, the\r\nmidwife, the chief almoner, the queen’s confessor, and myself to stay in\r\nher room to be witnesses of whatever happened, and of his course of\r\naction should a second child be born.\r\n\r\n\"’For a long time already it had been foretold to the king that his wife\r\nwould give birth to two sons, and some days before, certain shepherds\r\nhad arrived in Paris, saying they were divinely inspired, so that it was\r\nsaid in Paris that if two dauphins were born it would be the greatest\r\nmisfortune which could happen to the State. The Archbishop of Paris\r\nsummoned these soothsayers before him, and ordered them to be imprisoned\r\nin Saint-Lazare, because the populace was becoming excited about them—a\r\ncircumstance which filled the king with care, as he foresaw much trouble\r\nto his kingdom. What had been predicted by the soothsayers happened,\r\nwhether they had really been warned by the constellations, or whether\r\nProvidence by whom His Majesty had been warned of the calamities which\r\nmight happen to France interposed. The king had sent a messenger to the\r\ncardinal to tell him of this prophecy, and the cardinal had replied that\r\nthe matter, must be considered, that the birth of two dauphins was not\r\nimpossible, and should such a case arrive, the second must be carefully\r\nhidden away, lest in the future desiring to be king he should fight\r\nagainst his brother in support of a new branch of the royal house, and\r\ncome at last to reign.\r\n\r\n\"’The king in his suspense felt very uncomfortable, and as the queen\r\nbegan to utter cries we feared a second confinement. We sent to inform\r\nthe king, who was almost overcome by the thought that he was about to\r\nbecome the father of two dauphins. He said to the Bishop of Meaux, whom\r\nhe had sent for to minister to the queen, \"Do not quit my wife till she\r\nis safe; I am in mortal terror.\" Immediately after he summoned us all,\r\nthe Bishop of Meaux, the chancellor M. Honorat, Dame Peronete the\r\nmidwife, and myself, and said to us in presence of the queen, so that\r\nshe could hear, that we would answer to him with our heads if we made\r\nknown the birth of a second dauphin; that it was his will that the fact\r\nshould remain a state secret, to prevent the misfortunes which would\r\nelse happen, the Salic Law not having declared to whom the inheritance\r\nof the kingdom should come in case two eldest sons were born to any of\r\nthe kings.\r\n\r\n\"’What had been foretold happened: the queen, while the king was at\r\nsupper, gave birth to a second dauphin, more dainty and more beautiful\r\nthan the first, but who wept and wailed unceasingly, as if he regretted\r\nto take up that life in which he was afterwards to endure such\r\nsuffering. The chancellor drew up the report of this wonderful birth,\r\nwithout parallel in our history; but His Majesty not being pleased with\r\nits form, burned it in our presence, and the chancellor had to write and\r\nrewrite till His Majesty was satisfied. The almoner remonstrated, saying\r\nit would be impossible to hide the birth of a prince, but the king\r\nreturned that he had reasons of state for all he did.\r\n\r\n\"’Afterwards the king made us register our oath, the chancellor signing\r\nit first, then the queen’s confessor, and I last. The oath was also\r\nsigned by the surgeon and midwife who attended on the queen, and the\r\nking attached this document to the report, taking both away with him,\r\nand I never heard any more of either. I remember that His Majesty\r\nconsulted with the chancellor as to the form of the oath, and that he\r\nspoke for a long time in an undertone to the cardinal: after which the\r\nlast-born child was given into the charge of the midwife, and as they\r\nwere always afraid she would babble about his birth, she has told me\r\nthat they often threatened her with death should she ever mention it: we\r\nwere also forbidden to speak, even to each other, of the child whose\r\nbirth we had witnessed.\r\n\r\n\"’Not one of us has as yet violated his oath; for His Majesty dreaded\r\nnothing so much as a civil war brought about by the two children born\r\ntogether, and the cardinal, who afterwards got the care of the second\r\nchild into his hands, kept that fear alive. The king also commanded us\r\nto examine the unfortunate prince minutely; he had a wart above the left\r\nelbow, a mole on the right side of his neck, and a tiny wart on his\r\nright thigh; for His Majesty was determined, and rightly so, that in\r\ncase of the decease of the first-born, the royal infant whom he was\r\nentrusting to our care should take his place; wherefore he required our\r\nsignmanual to the report of the birth, to which a small royal seal was\r\nattached in our presence, and we all signed it after His Majesty,\r\naccording as he commanded. As to the shepherds who had foretold the\r\ndouble birth, never did I hear another word of them, but neither did I\r\ninquire. The cardinal who took the mysterious infant in charge probably\r\ngot them out of the country.\r\n\r\n\"’All through the infancy of the second prince Dame Peronete treated him\r\nas if he were her own child, giving out that his father was a great\r\nnobleman; for everyone saw by the care she lavished on him and the\r\nexpense she went to, that although unacknowledged he was the cherished\r\nson of rich parents, and well cared for.\r\n\r\n\"’When the prince began to grow up, Cardinal Mazarin, who succeeded\r\nCardinal Richelieu in the charge of the prince’s education, gave him\r\ninto my hands to bring up in a manner worthy of a king’s son, but in\r\nsecret. Dame Peronete continued in his service till her death, and was\r\nvery much attached to him, and he still more to her. The prince was\r\ninstructed in my house in Burgundy, with all the care due to the son and\r\nbrother of a king.\r\n\r\n\"’I had several conversations with the queen mother during the troubles\r\nin France, and Her Majesty always seemed to fear that if the existence\r\nof the prince should be discovered during the lifetime of his brother,\r\nthe young king, malcontents would make it a pretext for rebellion,\r\nbecause many medical men hold that the last-born of twins is in reality\r\nthe elder, and if so, he was king by right, while many others have a\r\ndifferent opinion.\r\n\r\n\"’In spite of this dread, the queen could never bring herself to destroy\r\nthe written evidence of his birth, because in case of the death of the\r\nyoung king she intended to have his twin-brother proclaimed. She told me\r\noften that the written proofs were in her strong box.\r\n\r\n\"’I gave the ill-starred prince such an education as I should have liked\r\nto receive myself, and no acknowledged son of a king ever had a better.\r\nThe only thing for which I have to reproach myself is that, without\r\nintending it, I caused him great unhappiness; for when he was nineteen\r\nyears old he had a burning desire to know who he was, and as he saw that\r\nI was determined to be silent, growing more firm the more he tormented\r\nme with questions, he made up his mind henceforward to disguise his\r\ncuriosity and to make me think that he believed himself a love-child of\r\nmy own. He began to call me ’father,’ although when we were alone I\r\noften assured him that he was mistaken; but at length I gave up\r\ncombating this belief, which he perhaps only feigned to make me speak,\r\nand allowed him to think he was my son, contradicting him no more; but\r\nwhile he continued to dwell on this subject he was meantime making every\r\neffort to find out who he really was. Two years passed thus, when,\r\nthrough an unfortunate piece of forgetfulness on my part, for which I\r\ngreatly blame myself, he became acquainted with the truth. He knew that\r\nthe king had lately sent me several messengers, and once having\r\ncarelessly forgotten to lock up a casket containing letters from the\r\nqueen and the cardinals, he read part and divined the rest through his\r\nnatural intelligence; and later confessed to me that he had carried off\r\nthe letter which told most explicitly of his birth.\r\n\r\n\"’I can recall that from this time on, his manner to me showed no longer\r\nthat respect for me in which I had brought him up, but became hectoring\r\nand rude, and that I could not imagine the reason of the change, for I\r\nnever found out that he had searched my papers, and he never revealed to\r\nme how he got at the casket, whether he was aided by some workmen whom\r\nhe did not wish to betray, or had employed other means.\r\n\r\n\"’One day, however, he unguardedly asked me to show him the portraits of\r\nthe late and the present king. I answered that those that existed were\r\nso poor that I was waiting till better ones were taken before having\r\nthem in my house.\r\n\r\n\"’This answer, which did not satisfy him, called forth the request to be\r\nallowed to go to Dijon. I found out afterwards that he wanted to see a\r\nportrait of the king which was there, and to get to the court, which was\r\njust then at Saint-Jean-de-Luz, because of the approaching marriage with\r\nthe infanta; so that he might compare himself with his brother and see\r\nif there were any resemblance between them. Having knowledge of his\r\nplan, I never let him out of my sight.\r\n\r\n\"’The young prince was at this time as beautiful as Cupid, and through\r\nthe intervention of Cupid himself he succeeded in getting hold of a\r\nportrait of his brother. One of the upper servants of the house, a young\r\ngirl, had taken his fancy, and he lavished such caresses on her and\r\ninspired her with so much love, that although the whole household was\r\nstrictly forbidden to give him anything without my permission, she\r\nprocured him a portrait of the king. The unhappy prince saw the likeness\r\nat once, indeed no one could help seeing it, for the one portrait would\r\nserve equally well for either brother, and the sight produced such a fit\r\nof fury that he came to me crying out, \"There is my brother, and this\r\ntells me who I am!\" holding out a letter from Cardinal Mazarin which he\r\nhad stolen from me, and making a great commotion in my house.\r\n\r\n\"’The dread lest the prince should escape and succeed in appearing at\r\nthe marriage of his brother made me so uneasy, that I sent off a\r\nmessenger to the king to tell him that my casket had been opened, and\r\nasking for instructions. The king sent back word through the cardinal\r\nthat we were both to be shut up till further orders, and that the prince\r\nwas to be made to understand that the cause of our common misfortune was\r\nhis absurd claim. I have since shared his prison, but I believe that a\r\ndecree of release has arrived from my heavenly judge, and for my soul’s\r\nhealth and for my ward’s sake I make this declaration, that he may know\r\nwhat measures to take in order to put an end to his ignominious estate\r\nshould the king die without children. Can any oath imposed under threats\r\noblige one to be silent about such incredible events, which it is\r\nnevertheless necessary that posterity should know?’\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the contents of the historical document given by the regent to\r\nthe princess, and it suggests a crowd of questions. Who was the prince’s\r\ngovernor? Was he a Burgundian? Was he simply a landed proprietor, with\r\nsome property and a country house in Burgundy? How far was his estate\r\nfrom Dijon? He must have been a man of note, for he enjoyed the most\r\nintimate confidence at the court of Louis XIII, either by virtue of his\r\noffice or because he was a favourite of the king, the queen, and\r\nCardinal Richelieu. Can we learn from the list of the nobles of Burgundy\r\nwhat member of their body disappeared from public life along with a\r\nyoung ward whom he had brought up in his own house just after the\r\nmarriage of Louis XIV? Why did he not attach his signature to the\r\ndeclaration, which appears to be a hundred years old? Did he dictate it\r\nwhen so near death that he had not strength to sign it? How did it find\r\nits way out of prison? And so forth.\r\n\r\nThere is no answer to all these questions, and I, for my part, cannot\r\nundertake to affirm that the document is genuine. Abbe Soulavie relates\r\nthat he one day \"pressed the marshal for an answer to some questions on\r\nthe matter, asking, amongst other things, if it were not true that the\r\nprisoner was an elder brother of Louis XIV born without the knowledge of\r\nLouis XIII. The marshal appeared very much embarrassed, and although he\r\ndid not entirely refuse to answer, what he said was not very\r\nexplanatory. He averred that this important personage was neither the\r\nillegitimate brother of Louis XIV, nor the Duke of Monmouth, nor the\r\nComte de Vermandois, nor the Duc de Beaufort, and so on, as so many\r\nwriters had asserted.\" He called all their writings mere inventions, but\r\nadded that almost every one of them had got hold of some true incidents,\r\nas for instance the order to kill the prisoner should he make himself\r\nknown. Finally he acknowledged that he knew the state secret, and used\r\nthe following words: \"All that I can tell you, abbe, is, that when the\r\nprisoner died at the beginning of the century, at a very advanced age,\r\nhe had ceased to be of such importance as when, at the beginning of his\r\nreign, Louis XIV shut him up for weighty reasons of state.\"\r\n\r\nThe above was written down under the eyes of the marshal, and when Abbe\r\nSoulavie entreated him to say something further which, while not\r\nactually revealing the secret, would yet satisfy his questioner’s\r\ncuriosity, the marshal answered, \"Read M. de Voltaire’s latest writings\r\non the subject, especially his concluding words, and reflect on them.\"\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Dulaure, all the critics have treated Soulavie’s\r\nnarrative with the most profound contempt, and we must confess that if\r\nit was an invention it was a monstrous one, and that the concoction of\r\nthe famous note in cipher was abominable. \"Such was the great secret; in\r\norder to find it out, I had to allow myself 5, 12, 17, 15, 14, 1, three\r\ntimes by 8, 3.\" But unfortunately for those who would defend the morals\r\nof Mademoiselle de Valois, it would be difficult to traduce the\r\ncharacter of herself, her lover, and her father, for what one knows of\r\nthe trio justifies one in believing that the more infamous the conduct\r\nimputed to them, the more likely it is to be true. We cannot see the\r\nforce of the objection that Louvois would not have written in the\r\nfollowing terms to Saint-Mars in 1687 about a bastard son of Anne of\r\nAustria: \"I see no objection to your removing Chevalier de Thezut from\r\nthe prison in which he is confined, and putting your prisoner there till\r\nthe one you are preparing for him is ready to receive him.\" And we\r\ncannot understand those who ask if Saint-Mars, following the example of\r\nthe minister, would have said of a prince \"Until he is installed in the\r\nprison which is being prepared for him here, which has a chapel\r\nadjoining\"? Why should he have expressed himself otherwise? Does it\r\nevidence an abatement of consideration to call a prisoner a prisoner,\r\nand his prison a prison?\r\n\r\nA certain M. de Saint-Mihiel published an 8vo volume in 1791, at\r\nStrasbourg and Paris, entitled ’Le veritable homme, dit au MASQUE DE\r\nFER, ouvrage dans lequel on fait connaitre, sur preuves incontestables,\r\na qui le celebre infortune dut le jour, quand et ou il naquit’. The\r\nwording of the title will give an idea of the bizarre and barbarous\r\njargon in which the whole book is written. It would be difficult to\r\nimagine the vanity and self-satisfaction which inspire this new reader\r\nof riddles. If he had found the philosopher’s stone, or made a discovery\r\nwhich would transform the world, he could not exhibit more pride and\r\npleasure. All things considered, the \"incontestable proofs\" of his\r\ntheory do not decide the question definitely, or place it above all\r\nattempts at refutation, any more than does the evidence on which the\r\nother theories which preceded and followed his rest. But what he lacks\r\nbefore all other things is the talent for arranging and using his\r\nmaterials. With the most ordinary skill he might have evolved a theory\r\nwhich would have defied criticism at least as successfully, as the\r\nothers, and he might have supported it by proofs, which if not\r\nincontestable (for no one has produced such), had at least moral\r\npresumption in their favour, which has great weight in such a mysterious\r\nand obscure affair, in trying to explain, which one can never leave on\r\none side, the respect shown by Louvois to the prisoner, to whom he\r\nalways spoke standing and with uncovered head.\r\n\r\nAccording to M. de Saint-Mihiel, the ’Man in the Iron Mask was a\r\nlegitimate son of Anne of Austria and Mazarin’.\r\n\r\nHe avers that Mazarin was only a deacon, and not a priest, when he\r\nbecame cardinal, having never taken priest’s orders, according to the\r\ntestimony of the Princess Palatine, consort of Philip I, Duc d’Orleans,\r\nand that it was therefore possible for him to marry, and that he did\r\nmarry, Anne of Austria in secret.\r\n\r\n\"Old Madame Beauvais, principal woman of the bed-chamber to the queen\r\nmother, knew of this ridiculous marriage, and as the price of her\r\nsecrecy obliged the queen to comply with all her whims. To this\r\ncircumstance the principal bed-chamber women owe the extensive\r\nprivileges accorded them ever since in this country\" (Letter of the\r\nDuchesse d’Orleans, 13th September 1713).\r\n\r\n\"The queen mother, consort of Louis XIII, had done worse than simply to\r\nfall in love with Mazarin, she had married him, for he had never been an\r\nordained priest, he had only taken deacon’s orders. If he had been a\r\npriest his marriage would have been impossible. He grew terribly tired\r\nof the good queen mother, and did not live happily with her, which was\r\nonly what he deserved for making such a marriage\" (Letter of the\r\nDuchesse d’Orleans, 2nd November 1717).\r\n\r\n\"She (the queen mother) was quite easy in her conscience about Cardinal\r\nMazarin; he was not in priest’s orders, and so could marry. The secret\r\npassage by which he reached the queen’s rooms every evening still exists\r\nin the Palais Royal\" (Letter of the Duchesse d’Orleans, 2nd July 1719)\r\n\r\n\"The queen’s, manner of conducting affairs is influenced by the passion\r\nwhich dominates her. When she and the cardinal converse together, their\r\nardent love for each other is betrayed by their looks and gestures; it\r\nis plain to see that when obliged to part for a time they do it with\r\ngreat reluctance. If what people say is true, that they are properly\r\nmarried, and that their union has been blessed by Pere Vincent the\r\nmissioner, there is no harm in all that goes on between them, either in\r\npublic or in private\" (’Requete civile contre la Conclusion de la Paix,\r\n1649).\r\n\r\nThe Man in the Iron Mask told the apothecary in the Bastille that he\r\nthought he was about sixty years of age (’Questions sur\r\nd’Encyclopedie’). Thus he must have been born in 1644, just at the time\r\nwhen Anne of Austria was invested with the royal power, though it was\r\nreally exercised by Mazarin.\r\n\r\nCan we find any incident recorded in history which lends support to the\r\nsupposition that Anne of Austria had a son whose birth was kept as\r\nsecret as her marriage to Mazarin?\r\n\r\n\"In 1644, Anne of Austria being dissatisfied with her apartments in the\r\nLouvre, moved to the Palais Royal, which had been left to the king by\r\nRichelieu. Shortly after taking up residence there she was very ill with\r\na severe attack of jaundice, which was caused, in the opinion of the\r\ndoctors, by worry, anxiety, and overwork, and which pulled her down\r\ngreatly\" (’Memoire de Madame de Motteville, 4 vols. 12mo, Vol i. p.\r\n194).\r\n\r\n\"This anxiety, caused by the pressure of public business, was most\r\nprobably only dwelt on as a pretext for a pretended attack of illness.\r\nAnne of Austria had no cause for worry and anxiety till 1649. She did\r\nnot begin to complain of the despotism of Mazarin till towards the end\r\nof 1645\" (Ibid., viol. i. pp. 272, 273).\r\n\r\n\"She went frequently to the theatre during her first year of widowhood,\r\nbut took care to hide herself from view in her box.\" (Ibid., vol. i. p.\r\n342).\r\n\r\nAbbe Soulavie, in vol. vi. of the ’Memoires de Richelieu’, published in\r\n1793, controverted the opinions of M. de Saint-Mihiel, and again\r\nadvanced those which he had published some time before, supporting them\r\nby a new array of reasons.\r\n\r\nThe fruitlessness of research in the archives of the Bastille, and the\r\nimportance of the political events which were happening, diverted the\r\nattention of the public for some years from this subject. In the year\r\n1800, however, the ’Magazin encyclopedique’ published (vol. vi. p. 472)\r\nan article entitled ’Memoires sur les Problemes historiques, et la\r\nmethode de les resoudre appliquee a celui qui concerne l’Homme au Masque\r\nde Fer’, signed C. D. O., in which the author maintained that the\r\nprisoner was the first minister of the Duke of Mantua, and says his name\r\nwas Girolamo Magni.\r\n\r\nIn the same year an octavo volume of 142 pages was produced by M.\r\nRoux-Fazillac. It bore the title ’Recherches historiques et critiques\r\nsur l’Homme au Masque de Fer, d’ou resultent des Notions certaines sur\r\nce prisonnier’. These researches brought to light a secret\r\ncorrespondence relative to certain negotiations and intrigues, and to\r\nthe abduction of a secretary of the Duke of Mantua whose name was\r\nMatthioli, and not Girolamo Magni.\r\n\r\nIn 1802 an octavo pamphlet containing 11 pages, of which the author was\r\nperhaps Baron Lerviere, but which was signed Reth, was published. It\r\ntook the form of a letter to General Jourdan, and was dated from Turin,\r\nand gave many details about Matthioli and his family. It was entitled\r\n’Veritable Clef de l’Histoire de l’Homme au Masque de Fer’. It proved\r\nthat the secretary of the Duke of Mantua was carried off, masked, and\r\nimprisoned, by order of Louis XIV in 1679, but it did not succeed in\r\nestablishing as an undoubted fact that the secretary and the Man in the\r\nIron Mask were one and the same person.\r\n\r\nIt may be remembered that M. Crawfurd writing in 1798 had said in his\r\n’Histoire de la Bastille’ (8vo, 474 pages), \"I cannot doubt that the Man\r\nin the Iron Mask was the son of Anne of Austria, but am unable to decide\r\nwhether he was a twin-brother of Louis XIV or was born while the king\r\nand queen lived apart, or during her widowhood.\" M. Crawfurd, in his\r\n’Melanges d’Histoire et de Litterature tires dun Portefeuille’ (quarto\r\n1809, octavo 1817), demolished the theory advanced by Roux-Fazillac.\r\n\r\nIn 1825, M. Delort discovered in the archives several letters relating\r\nto Matthioli, and published his Histoire de l’Homme au Masque de Fer\r\n(8vo). This work was translated into English by George Agar-Ellis, and\r\nretranslated into French in 1830, under the title ’Histoire authentique\r\ndu Prisonnier d’Etat, connu sons le Nom de Masque de Fer’. It is in this\r\nwork that the suggestion is made that the captive was the second son of\r\nOliver Cromwell.\r\n\r\nIn 1826, M. de Taules wrote that, in his opinion, the masked prisoner\r\nwas none other than the Armenian Patriarch. But six years later the\r\ngreat success of my drama at the Odeon converted nearly everyone to the\r\nversion of which Soulavie was the chief exponent. The bibliophile Jacob\r\nis mistaken in asserting that I followed a tradition preserved in the\r\nfamily of the Duc de Choiseul; M. le Duc de Bassano sent me a copy made\r\nunder his personal supervision of a document drawn up for Napoleon,\r\ncontaining the results of some researches made by his orders on the\r\nsubject of the Man in the Iron Mask. The original MS., as well as that\r\nof the Memoires du Duc de Richelieu, were, the duke told me, kept at the\r\nForeign Office. In 1834 the journal of the Institut historique published\r\na letter from M. Auguste Billiard, who stated that he had also made a\r\ncopy of this document for the late Comte de Montalivet, Home Secretary\r\nunder the Empire.\r\n\r\n  M. Dufey (de l’Yonne) gave his ’Histoire de la Bastille’ to the world\r\n     in the same year, and was inclined to believe that the prisoner was\r\n     a son of Buckingham.\r\n\r\nBesides the many important personages on whom the famous mask had been\r\nplaced, there was one whom everyone had forgotten, although his name had\r\nbeen put forward by the minister Chamillart: this was the celebrated\r\nSuperintendent of Finance, Nicolas Fouquet. In 1837, Jacob, armed with\r\ndocuments and extracts, once more occupied himself with this Chinese\r\npuzzle on which so much ingenuity had been lavished, but of which no one\r\nhad as yet got all the pieces into their places. Let us see if he\r\nsucceeded better than his forerunners.\r\n\r\nThe first feeling he awakes is one of surprise. It seems odd that he\r\nshould again bring up the case of Fouquet, who was condemned to\r\nimprisonment for life in 1664, confined in Pignerol under the care of\r\nSaint-Mars, and whose death was announced (falsely according to Jacob)\r\non March 23rd, 1680. The first thing to look for in trying to get at the\r\ntrue history of the Mask is a sufficient reason of state to account for\r\nthe persistent concealment of the prisoner’s features till his death;\r\nand next, an explanation of the respect shown him by Louvois, whose\r\nattitude towards him would have been extraordinary in any age, but was\r\ndoubly so during the reign of Louis XIV, whose courtiers would have been\r\nthe last persons in the world to render homage to the misfortunes of a\r\nman in disgrace with their master. Whatever the real motive of the\r\nking’s anger against Fouquet may have been, whether Louis thought he\r\narrogated to himself too much power, or aspired to rival his master in\r\nthe hearts of some of the king’s mistresses, or even presumed to raise\r\nhis eyes higher still, was not the utter ruin, the lifelong captivity,\r\nof his enemy enough to satiate the vengeance of the king? What could he\r\ndesire more? Why should his anger, which seemed slaked in 1664, burst\r\nforth into hotter flames seventeen years later, and lead him to inflict\r\na new punishment? According to the bibliophile, the king being wearied\r\nby the continual petitions for pardon addressed to him by the\r\nsuperintendent’s family, ordered them to be told that he was dead, to\r\nrid himself of their supplications. Colbert’s hatred, says he, was the\r\nimmediate cause of Fouquet’s fall; but even if this hatred hastened the\r\ncatastrophe, are we to suppose that it pursued the delinquent beyond the\r\nsentence, through the long years of captivity, and, renewing its energy,\r\ninfected the minds of the king and his councillors? If that were so, how\r\nshall we explain the respect shown by Louvois? Colbert would not have\r\nstood uncovered before Fouquet in prison. Why should Colbert’s colleague\r\nhave done so?\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be confessed that of all existing theories, this one,\r\nthanks to the unlimited learning and research of the bibliophile, has\r\nthe greatest number of documents with the various interpretations\r\nthereof, the greatest profusion of dates, on its side.\r\n\r\nFor it is certain—\r\n\r\n1st, that the precautions taken when Fouquet was sent to Pignerol\r\nresembled in every respect those employed later by the custodians of the\r\nIron Mask, both at the Iles Sainte-Marguerite and at the Bastille;\r\n\r\n2nd, that the majority of the traditions relative to the masked prisoner\r\nmight apply to Fouquet;\r\n\r\n3rd, that the Iron Mask was first heard of immediately after the\r\nannouncement of the death of Fouquet in 1680;\r\n\r\n4th, that there exists no irrefragable proof that Fouquet’s death really\r\noccurred in the above year.\r\n\r\nThe decree of the Court of justice, dated 20th December 1664, banished\r\nFouquet from the kingdom for life. \"But the king was of the opinion that\r\nit would be dangerous to let the said Fouquet leave the country, in\r\nconsideration of his intimate knowledge of the most important matters of\r\nstate. Consequently the sentence of perpetual banishment was commuted\r\ninto that of perpetual imprisonment.\" (’Receuil des defenses de M.\r\nFouquet’). The instructions signed by the king and remitted to\r\nSaint-Mars forbid him to permit Fouquet to hold any spoken or written\r\ncommunication with anyone whatsoever, or to leave his apartments for any\r\ncause, not even for exercise. The great mistrust felt by Louvois\r\npervades all his letters to Saint-Mars. The precautions which he ordered\r\nto be kept up were quite as stringent as in the case of the Iron Mask.\r\n\r\nThe report of the discovery of a shirt covered with writing, by a friar,\r\nwhich Abbe Papon mentions, may perhaps be traced to the following\r\nextracts from two letters written by Louvois to Saint-Mars: \"Your letter\r\nhas come to hand with the new handkerchief on which M. Fouquet has\r\nwritten\" (18th Dec. 1665 ); \"You can tell him that if he continues too\r\nemploy his table-linen as note-paper he must not be surprised if you\r\nrefuse to supply him with any more\" ( 21st Nov. 1667).\r\n\r\nPere Papon asserts that a valet who served the masked prisoner died in\r\nhis master’s room. Now the man who waited on Fouquet, and who like him\r\nwas sentenced to lifelong imprisonment, died in February 1680 (see\r\nletter of Louvois to Saint-Mars, 12th March 1680). Echoes of incidents\r\nwhich took place at Pignerol might have reached the Iles\r\nSainte-Marguerite when Saint-Mars transferred his \"former prisoner\" from\r\none fortress to the other. The fine clothes and linen, the books, all\r\nthose luxuries in fact that were lavished on the masked prisoner, were\r\nnot withheld from Fouquet. The furniture of a second room at Pignerol\r\ncost over 1200 livres (see letters of Louvois, 12th Dec. 1665, and 22nd\r\nFeb, 1666).\r\n\r\nIt is also known that until the year 1680 Saint-Mars had only two\r\nimportant prisoners at Pignerol, Fouquet and Lauzun. However, his\r\n\"former prisoner of Pignerol,\" according to Du Junca’s diary, must have\r\nreached the latter fortress before the end of August 1681, when\r\nSaint-Mars went to Exilles as governor. So that it was in the interval\r\nbetween the 23rd March 1680, the alleged date of Fouquet’s death, and\r\nthe 1st September 1681, that the Iron Mask appeared at Pignerol, and yet\r\nSaint-Mars took only two prisoners to Exilles. One of these was probably\r\nthe Man in the Iron Mask; the other, who must have been Matthioli, died\r\nbefore the year 1687, for when Saint-Mars took over the governorship in\r\nthe month of January of that year of the Iles Sainte-Marguerite he\r\nbrought only ONE prisoner thither with him. \"I have taken such good\r\nmeasures to guard my prisoner that I can answer to you for his safety\"\r\n(’Lettres de Saint-Mars a Louvois’, 20th January 1687).\r\n\r\nIn the correspondence of Louvois with Saint-Mars we find, it is true,\r\nmention of the death of Fouquet on March 23rd, 1680, but in his later\r\ncorrespondence Louvois never says \"the late M. Fouquet,\" but speaks of\r\nhim, as usual, as \"M. Fouquet\" simply. Most historians have given as a\r\nfact that Fouquet was interred in the same vault as his father in the\r\nchapel of Saint-Francois de Sales in the convent church belonging to the\r\nSisters of the Order of the Visitation-Sainte-Marie, founded in the\r\nbeginning of the seventeenth century by Madame de Chantal. But proof to\r\nthe contrary exists; for the subterranean portion of St. Francis’s\r\nchapel was closed in 1786, the last person interred there being Adelaide\r\nFelicite Brulard, with whom ended the house of Sillery. The convent was\r\nshut up in 1790, and the church given over to the Protestants in 1802;\r\nwho continued to respect the tombs. In 1836 the Cathedral chapter of\r\nBourges claimed the remains of one of their archbishops buried there in\r\nthe time of the Sisters of Sainte-Marie. On this occasion all the\r\ncoffins were examined and all the inscriptions carefully copied, but the\r\nname of Nicolas Fouquet is absent.\r\n\r\nVoltaire says in his ’Dictionnaire philosophique’, article \"Ana,\" \"It is\r\nmost remarkable that no one knows where the celebrated Fouquet was\r\nburied.\"\r\n\r\nBut in spite of all these coincidences, this carefully constructed\r\ntheory was wrecked on the same point on which the theory that the\r\nprisoner was either the Duke of Monmouth or the Comte de Vermandois came\r\nto grief, viz. a letter from Barbezieux, dated 13th August 1691, in\r\nwhich occur the words, \"THE PRISONER WHOM YOU HAVE HAD IN CHARGE FOR\r\nTWENTY YEARS.\" According to this testimony, which Jacob had successfully\r\nused against his predecessors, the prisoner referred to could not have\r\nbeen Fouquet, who completed his twenty-seventh year of captivity in\r\n1691, if still alive.\r\n\r\nWe have now impartially set before our readers all the opinions which\r\nhave been held in regard to the solution of this formidable enigma. For\r\nourselves, we hold the belief that the Man in the Iron Mask stood on the\r\nsteps of the throne. Although the mystery cannot be said to be\r\ndefinitely cleared up, one thing stands out firmly established among the\r\nmass of conjecture we have collected together, and that is, that\r\nwherever the prisoner appeared he was ordered to wear a mask on pain of\r\ndeath. His features, therefore, might during half a century have brought\r\nabout his recognition from one end of France to the other; consequently,\r\nduring the same space of time there existed in France a face resembling\r\nthe prisoner’s known through all her provinces, even to her most\r\nsecluded isle.\r\n\r\nWhose face could this be, if not that of Louis XVI, twin-brother of the\r\nMan in the Iron Mask?\r\n\r\nTo nullify this simple and natural conclusion strong evidence will be\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nOur task has been limited to that of an examining judge at a trial, and\r\nwe feel sure that our readers will not be sorry that we have left them\r\nto choose amid all the conflicting explanations of the puzzle. No\r\nconsistent narrative that we might have concocted would, it seems to us,\r\nhave been half as interesting to them as to allow them to follow the\r\ndevious paths opened up by those who entered on the search for the heart\r\nof the mystery. Everything connected with the masked prisoner arouses\r\nthe most vivid curiosity. And what end had we in view? Was it not to\r\ndenounce a crime and to brand the perpetrator thereof? The facts as they\r\nstand are sufficient for our object, and speak more eloquently than if\r\nused to adorn a tale or to prove an ingenious theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*MARTIN GUERRE*\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are sometimes astonished at the striking resemblance existing between\r\ntwo persons who are absolute strangers to each other, but in fact it is\r\nthe opposite which ought to surprise us. Indeed, why should we not\r\nrather admire a Creative Power so infinite in its variety that it never\r\nceases to produce entirely different combinations with precisely the\r\nsame elements? The more one considers this prodigious versatility of\r\nform, the more overwhelming it appears.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, each nation has its own distinct and characteristic type,\r\nseparating it from other races of men. Thus there are the English,\r\nSpanish, German, or Slavonic types; again, in each nation we find\r\nfamilies distinguished from each other by less general but still\r\nwell-pronounced features; and lastly, the individuals of each family,\r\ndiffering again in more or less marked gradations. What a multitude of\r\nphysiognomies! What variety of impression from the innumerable stamps of\r\nthe human countenance! What millions of models and no copies!\r\nConsidering this ever changing spectacle, which ought to inspire us with\r\nmost astonishment—the perpetual difference of faces or the accidental\r\nresemblance of a few individuals? Is it impossible that in the whole\r\nwide world there should be found by chance two people whose features are\r\ncast in one and the same mould? Certainly not; therefore that which\r\nought to surprise us is not that these duplicates exist here and there\r\nupon the earth, but that they are to be met with in the same place, and\r\nappear together before our eyes, little accustomed to see such\r\nresemblances. From Amphitryon down to our own days, many fables have\r\nowed their origin to this fact, and history also has provided a few\r\nexamples, such as the false Demetrius in Russia, the English Perkin\r\nWarbeck, and several other celebrated impostors, whilst the story we now\r\npresent to our readers is no less curious and strange.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of, August 1557, an inauspicious day in the history of\r\nFrance, the roar of cannon was still heard at six in the evening in the\r\nplains of St. Quentin; where the French army had just been destroyed by\r\nthe united troops of England and Spain, commanded by the famous Captain\r\nEmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy. An utterly beaten infantry, the\r\nConstable Montmorency and several generals taken prisoner, the Duke\r\nd’Enghien mortally wounded, the flower of the nobility cut down like\r\ngrass,—such were the terrible results of a battle which plunged France\r\ninto mourning, and which would have been a blot on the reign of Henry\r\nII, had not the Duke of Guise obtained a brilliant revenge the following\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nIn a little village less than a mile from the field of battle were to be\r\nheard the groans of the wounded and dying, who had been carried thither\r\nfrom the field of battle. The inhabitants had given up their houses to\r\nbe used as hospitals, and two or three barber surgeons went hither and\r\nthither, hastily ordering operations which they left to their\r\nassistants, and driving out fugitives who had contrived to accompany the\r\nwounded under pretence of assisting friends or near relations. They had\r\nalready expelled a good number of these poor fellows, when, opening the\r\ndoor of a small room, they found a soldier soaked in blood lying on a\r\nrough mat, and another soldier apparently attending on him with the\r\nutmost care.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" said one of the surgeons to the sufferer. \"I don’t think\r\nyou belong to our French troops.\"\r\n\r\n\"Help!\" cried the soldier, \"only help me! and may God bless you for it!\"\r\n\r\n\"From the colour of that tunic,\" remarked the other surgeon, \"I should\r\nwager the rascal belongs to some Spanish gentleman. By what blunder was\r\nhe brought here?\"\r\n\r\n\"For pity’s sake!\" murmured the poor fellow, \"I am in such pain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Die, wretch!\" responded the last speaker, pushing him with his foot.\r\n\"Die, like the dog you are!\"\r\n\r\nBut this brutality, answered as it was by an agonised groan, disgusted\r\nthe other surgeon.\r\n\r\n\"After all, he is a man, and a wounded man who implores help. Leave him\r\nto me, Rene.\"\r\n\r\nRene went out grumbling, and the one who remained proceeded to examine\r\nthe wound. A terrible arquebus-shot had passed through the leg,\r\nshattering the bone: amputation was absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to the operation, the surgeon turned to the other\r\nsoldier, who had retired into the darkest corner of the room.\r\n\r\n\"And you, who may you be?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nThe man replied by coming forward into the light: no other answer was\r\nneeded. He resembled his companion so closely that no one could doubt\r\nthey were brothers-twin brothers, probably. Both were above middle\r\nheight; both had olive-brown complexions, black eyes, hooked noses,\r\npointed chins, a slightly projecting lower lip; both were\r\nround-shouldered, though this defect did not amount to disfigurement:\r\nthe whole personality suggested strength, and was not destitute of\r\nmasculine beauty. So strong a likeness is hardly ever seen; even their\r\nages appeared to agree, for one would not have supposed either to be\r\nmore than thirty-two; and the only difference noticeable, besides the\r\npale countenance of the wounded man, was that he was thin as compared\r\nwith the moderate fleshiness of the other, also that he had a large scar\r\nover the right eyebrow.\r\n\r\n\"Look well after your brother’s soul,\" said the surgeon to the soldier,\r\nwho remained standing; \"if it is in no better case than his body, it is\r\nmuch to be pitied.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there no hope?\" inquired the Sosia of the wounded man.\r\n\r\n\"The wound is too large and too deep,\" replied the man of science, \"to\r\nbe cauterised with boiling oil, according to the ancient method.\r\n’Delenda est causa mali,’ the source of evil must be destroyed, as says\r\nthe learned Ambrose Pare; I ought therefore ’secareferro,’—that is to\r\nsay, take off the leg. May God grant that he survive the operation!\"\r\n\r\nWhile seeking his instruments, he looked the supposed brother full in\r\nthe face, and added—\r\n\r\n\"But how is it that you are carrying muskets in opposing armies, for I\r\nsee that you belong to us, while this poor fellow wears Spanish\r\nuniform?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that would be a long story to tell,\" replied the soldier, shaking\r\nhis head. \"As for me, I followed the career which was open to me, and\r\ntook service of my own free will under the banner of our lord king,\r\nHenry II. This man, whom you rightly suppose to be my brother, was born\r\nin Biscay, and became attached to the household of the Cardinal of\r\nBurgos, and afterwards to the cardinal’s brother, whom he was obliged to\r\nfollow to the war. I recognised him on the battle-field just as he fell;\r\nI dragged him out of a heap of dead, and brought him here.\"\r\n\r\nDuring his recital this individual’s features betrayed considerable\r\nagitation, but the surgeon did not heed it. Not finding some necessary\r\ninstruments, \"My colleague,\" he exclaimed, \"must have carried them off.\r\nHe constantly does this, out of jealousy of my reputation; but I will be\r\neven with him yet! Such splendid instruments! They will almost work of\r\nthemselves, and are capable of imparting some skill even to him, dunce\r\nas he is!... I shall be back in an hour or two; he must rest, sleep,\r\nhave nothing to excite him, nothing to inflame the wound; and when the\r\noperation is well over, we shall see! May the Lord be gracious to him!\"\r\n\r\nThen he went to the door, leaving the poor wretch to the care of his\r\nsupposed brother.\r\n\r\n\"My God!\" he added, shaking his head, \"if he survive, it will be by the\r\nhelp of a miracle.\"\r\n\r\nScarcely had he left the room, when the unwounded soldier carefully\r\nexamined the features of the wounded one.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he murmured between his teeth, \"they were right in saying that my\r\nexact double was to be found in the hostile army . . . . Truly one would\r\nnot know us apart! . . . I might be surveying myself in a mirror. I did\r\nwell to look for him in the rear of the Spanish army, and, thanks to the\r\nfellow who rolled him over so conveniently with that arquebus-shot; I\r\nwas able to escape the dangers of the melee by carrying him out of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that’s not all,\" he thought, still carefully studying the tortured\r\nface of the unhappy sufferer; \"it is not enough to have got out of that.\r\nI have absolutely nothing in the world, no home, no resources. Beggar by\r\nbirth, adventurer by fortune, I have enlisted, and have consumed my pay;\r\nI hoped for plunder, and here we are in full flight! What am I to do? Go\r\nand drown myself? No, certainly a cannon-ball would be as good as that.\r\nBut can’t I profit by this chance, and obtain a decent position by\r\nturning to my own advantage this curious resemblance, and making some\r\nuse of this man whom Fate has thrown in my way, and who has but a short\r\ntime to live?\"\r\n\r\nArguing thus, he bent over the prostrate man with a cynical laugh: one\r\nmight have thought he was Satan watching the departure of a soul too\r\nutterly lost to escape him.\r\n\r\n\"Alas! alas!\" cried the sufferer; \"may God have mercy on me! I feel my\r\nend is near.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! comrade, drive away these dismal thoughts. Your leg pains you—well\r\nthey will cut it off! Think only of the other one, and trust in\r\nProvidence!\"\r\n\r\n\"Water, a drop of water, for Heaven’s sake!\" The sufferer was in a high\r\nfever. The would-be nurse looked round and saw a jug of water, towards\r\nwhich the dying man extended a trembling hand. A truly infernal idea\r\nentered his mind. He poured some water into a gourd which hung from his\r\nbelt, held it to the lips of the wounded man, and then withdrew it.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! I thirst-that water! . . . For pity’s sake, give me some!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but on one condition you must tell me your whole history.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes . . . but give me water!\"\r\n\r\nHis tormentor allowed him to swallow a mouthful, then overwhelmed him\r\nwith questions as to his family, his friends and fortune, and compelled\r\nhim to answer by keeping before his eyes the water which alone could\r\nrelieve the fever which devoured him. After this often interrupted\r\ninterrogation, the sufferer sank back exhausted, and almost insensible.\r\nBut, not yet satisfied, his companion conceived the idea of reviving him\r\nwith a few drops of brandy, which quickly brought back the fever, and\r\nexcited his brain sufficiently to enable him to answer fresh questions.\r\nThe doses of spirit were doubled several times, at the risk of ending\r\nthe unhappy man’s days then and there: Almost delirious, his head\r\nfeeling as if on fire, his sufferings gave way to a feverish excitement,\r\nwhich took him back to other places and other times: he began to recall\r\nthe days of his youth and the country where he lived. But his tongue was\r\nstill fettered by a kind of reserve: his secret thoughts, the private\r\ndetails of his past life were not yet told, and it seemed as though he\r\nmight die at any moment. Time was passing, night already coming on, and\r\nit occurred to the merciless questioner to profit by the gathering\r\ndarkness. By a few solemn words he aroused the religious feelings of the\r\nsufferer, terrified him by speaking of the punishments of another life\r\nand the flames of hell, until to the delirious fancy of the sick man he\r\ntook the form of a judge who could either deliver him to eternal\r\ndamnation or open the gates of heaven to him. At length, overwhelmed by\r\na voice which resounded in his ear like that of a minister of God, the\r\ndying man laid bare his inmost soul before his tormentor, and made his\r\nlast confession to him.\r\n\r\nYet a few moments, and the executioner—he deserves no other name—hangs\r\nover his victim, opens his tunic, seizes some papers and a few coins,\r\nhalf draws his dagger, but thinks better of it; then, contemptuously\r\nspurning the victim, as the other surgeon had done—\r\n\r\n\"I might kill you,\" he says, \"but it would be a useless murder; it would\r\nonly be hastening your last Sigh by an hour or two, and advancing my\r\nclaims to your inheritance by the same space of time.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he adds mockingly:—\r\n\r\n\"Farewell, my brother!\"\r\n\r\nThe wounded soldier utters a feeble groan; the adventurer leaves the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nFour months later, a woman sat at the door of a house at one end of the\r\nvillage of Artigues, near Rieux, and played with a child about nine or\r\nten years of age. Still young, she had the brown complexion of Southern\r\nwomen, and her beautiful black hair fell in curls about her face. Her\r\nflashing eyes occasionally betrayed hidden passions, concealed, however,\r\nbeneath an apparent indifference and lassitude, and her wasted form\r\nseemed to acknowledge the existence of some secret grief. An observer\r\nwould have divined a shattered life, a withered happiness, a soul\r\ngrievously wounded.\r\n\r\nHer dress was that of a wealthy peasant; and she wore one of the long\r\ngowns with hanging sleeves which were in fashion in the sixteenth\r\ncentury. The house in front of which she sat belonged to her, so also\r\nthe immense field which adjoined the garden. Her attention was divided\r\nbetween the play of her son and the orders she was giving to an old\r\nservant, when an exclamation from the child startled her.\r\n\r\n\"Mother!\" he cried, \"mother, there he is!\"\r\n\r\nShe looked where the child pointed, and saw a young boy turning the\r\ncorner of the street.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" continued the child, \"that is the lad who, when I was playing\r\nwith the other boys yesterday, called me all sorts of bad names.\"\r\n\r\n\"What sort of names, my child?\"\r\n\r\n\"There was one I did not understand, but it must have been a very bad\r\none, for the other boys all pointed at me, and left me alone. He called\r\nme—and he said it was only what his mother had told him—he called me a\r\nwicked bastard!\"\r\n\r\nHis mother’s face became purple with indignation. \"What!\" she cried,\r\n\"they dared! . . . What an insult!\"\r\n\r\n\"What does this bad word mean, mother?\" asked the child, half frightened\r\nby her anger. \"Is that what they call poor children who have no father?\"\r\n\r\nHis mother folded him in her arms. \"Oh!\" she continued, \"it is an\r\ninfamous slander! These people never saw your father, they have only\r\nbeen here six years, and this is the eighth since he went away, but this\r\nis abominable! We were married in that church, we came at once to live\r\nin this house, which was my marriage portion, and my poor Martin has\r\nrelations and friends here who will not allow his wife to be insulted—\"\r\n\r\n\"Say rather, his widow,\" interrupted a solemn voice.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! uncle!\" exclaimed the woman, turning towards an old man who had\r\njust emerged from the house.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Bertrande,\" continued the new-comer, \"you must get reconciled to\r\nthe idea that my nephew has ceased to exist. I am sure he was not such a\r\nfool as to have remained all this time without letting us hear from him.\r\nHe was not the fellow to go off at a tangent, on account of a domestic\r\nquarrel which you have never vouchsafed to explain to me, and to retain\r\nhis anger during all these eight years! Where did he go? What did he do?\r\nWe none of us know, neither you nor I, nor anybody else. He is assuredly\r\ndead, and lies in some graveyard far enough from here. May God have\r\nmercy on his soul!\"\r\n\r\nBertrande, weeping, made the sign of the cross, and bowed her head upon\r\nher hands.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, Sanxi,\" said the uncle, tapping the child’s,’ cheek. Sanxi\r\nturned sulkily away.\r\n\r\nThere was certainly nothing specially attractive about the uncle: he\r\nbelonged to a type which children instinctively dislike, false, crafty,\r\nwith squinting eyes which continually appeared to contradict his honeyed\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\n\"Bertrande,\" he said, \"your boy is like his father before him, and only\r\nanswers my kindness with rudeness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Forgive him,\" answered the mother; \"he is very young, and does not\r\nunderstand the respect due to his father’s uncle. I will teach him\r\nbetter things; he will soon learn that he ought to be grateful for the\r\ncare you have taken of his little property.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt, no doubt,\" said the uncle, trying hard to smile. \"I will give\r\nyou a good account of it, for I shall only have to reckon with you two\r\nin future. Come, my dear, believe me, your husband is really dead, and\r\nyou have sorrowed quite enough for a good-for-nothing fellow. Think no\r\nmore of him.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he departed, leaving the poor young woman a prey to the\r\nsaddest thoughts.\r\n\r\nBertrande de Rolls, naturally gifted with extreme sensibility, on which\r\na careful education had imposed due restraint, had barely completed her\r\ntwelfth year when she was married to Martin Guerre, a boy of about the\r\nsame age, such precocious unions being then not uncommon, especially in\r\nthe Southern provinces. They were generally settled by considerations of\r\nfamily interest, assisted by the extremely early development habitual to\r\nthe climate. The young couple lived for a long time as brother and\r\nsister, and Bertrande, thus early familiar with the idea of domestic\r\nhappiness, bestowed her whole affection on the youth whom she had been\r\ntaught to regard as her life’s companion. He was the Alpha and Omega of\r\nher existence; all her love, all her thoughts, were given to him, and\r\nwhen their marriage was at length completed, the birth of a son seemed\r\nonly another link in the already long existing bond of union. But, as\r\nmany wise men have remarked, a uniform happiness, which only attaches\r\nwomen more and more, has often upon men a precisely contrary effect, and\r\nso it was with Martin Guerre. Of a lively and excitable temperament, he\r\nwearied of a yoke which had been imposed so early, and, anxious to see\r\nthe world and enjoy some freedom, he one day took advantage of a\r\ndomestic difference, in which Bertrande owned herself to have been\r\nwrong, and left his house and family. He was sought and awaited in vain.\r\nBertrande spent the first month in vainly expecting his return, then she\r\nbetook herself to prayer; but Heaven appeared deaf to her supplications,\r\nthe truant returned not. She wished to go in search of him, but the\r\nworld is wide, and no single trace remained to guide her. What torture\r\nfor a tender heart! What suffering for a soul thirsting for love! What\r\nsleepless nights! What restless vigils! Years passed thus; her son was\r\ngrowing up, yet not a word reached her from the man she loved so much.\r\nShe spoke often of him to the uncomprehending child, she sought to\r\ndiscover his features in those of her boy, but though she endeavoured to\r\nconcentrate her whole affection on her son, she realised that there is\r\nsuffering which maternal love cannot console, and tears which it cannot\r\ndry. Consumed by the strength of the sorrow which ever dwelt in her\r\nheart, the poor woman was slowly wasting, worn out by the regrets of the\r\npast, the vain desires of the present, and the dreary prospect of the\r\nfuture. And now she had been openly insulted, her feelings as a mother\r\nwounded to the quirk; and her husband’s uncle, instead of defending and\r\nconsoling her, could give only cold counsel and unsympathetic words!\r\n\r\nPierre Guerre, indeed, was simply a thorough egotist. In his youth he\r\nhad been charged with usury; no one knew by what means he had become\r\nrich, for the little drapery trade which he called his profession did\r\nnot appear to be very profitable.\r\n\r\nAfter his nephew’s departure it seemed only natural that he should pose\r\nas the family guardian, and he applied himself to the task of increasing\r\nthe little income, but without considering himself bound to give any\r\naccount to Bertrande. So, once persuaded that Martin was no more, he was\r\napparently not unwilling to prolong a situation so much to his own\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nNight was fast coming on; in the dim twilight distant objects became\r\nconfused and indistinct. It was the end of autumn, that melancholy\r\nseason which suggests so many gloomy thoughts and recalls so many\r\nblighted hopes. The child had gone into the house. Bertrande, still\r\nsitting at the door, resting her forehead on her hand, thought sadly of\r\nher uncle’s words; recalling in imagination the past scenes which they\r\nsuggested, the time of their childhood, when, married so young, they\r\nwere as yet only playmates, prefacing the graver duties of life by\r\ninnocent pleasures; then of the love which grew with their increasing\r\nage; then of how this love became altered, changing on her side into\r\npassion, on his into indifference. She tried to recollect him as he had\r\nbeen on the eve of his departure, young and handsome, carrying his head\r\nhigh, coming home from a fatiguing hunt and sitting by his son’s cradle;\r\nand then also she remembered bitterly the jealous suspicions she had\r\nconceived, the anger with which she had allowed them to escape her, the\r\nconsequent quarrel, followed by the disappearance of her offended\r\nhusband, and the eight succeeding years of solitude and mourning. She\r\nwept over his desertion; over the desolation of her life, seeing around\r\nher only indifferent or selfish people, and caring only to live for her\r\nchild’s sake, who gave her at least a shadowy reflection of the husband\r\nshe had lost. \"Lost—yes, lost for ever!\" she said to herself, sighing,\r\nand looking again at the fields whence she had so often seen him coming\r\nat this same twilight hour, returning to his home for the evening meal.\r\nShe cast a wandering eye on the distant hills, which showed a black\r\noutline against a yet fiery western sky, then let it fall on a little\r\ngrove of olive trees planted on the farther side of the brook which\r\nskirted her dwelling. Everything was calm; approaching night brought\r\nsilence along with darkness: it was exactly what she saw every evening,\r\nbut to leave which required always an effort.\r\n\r\nShe rose to re-enter the house, when her attention was caught by a\r\nmovement amongst the trees. For a moment she thought she was mistaken,\r\nbut the branches again rustled, then parted asunder, and the form of a\r\nman appeared on the other side of the brook. Terrified, Bertrande tried\r\nto scream, but not a sound escaped her lips; her voice seemed paralyzed\r\nby terror, as in an evil dream. And she almost thought it was a dream,\r\nfor notwithstanding the dark shadows cast around this indistinct\r\nsemblance, she seemed to recognise features once dear to her. Had her\r\nbitter reveries ended by making her the victim of a hallucination? She\r\nthought her brain was giving way, and sank on her knees to pray for\r\nhelp. But the figure remained; it stood motionless, with folded arms,\r\nsilently gazing at her! Then she thought of witchcraft, of evil demons,\r\nand superstitious as every one was in those days, she kissed a crucifix\r\nwhich hung from her neck, and fell fainting on the ground. With one\r\nspring the phantom crossed the brook and stood beside her.\r\n\r\n\"Bertrande!\" it said in a voice of emotion. She raised her head, uttered\r\na piercing cry, and was clasped in her husband’s arms.\r\n\r\nThe whole village became aware of this event that same evening. The\r\nneighbours crowded round Bertrande’s door, Martin’s friends and\r\nrelations naturally wishing to see him after this miraculous\r\nreappearance, while those who had never known him desired no less to\r\ngratify their curiosity; so that the hero of the little drama, instead\r\nof remaining quietly at home with his wife, was obliged to exhibit\r\nhimself publicly in a neighbouring barn. His four sisters burst through\r\nthe crowd and fell on his neck weeping; his uncle examined him\r\ndoubtfully at first, then extended his arms. Everybody recognised him,\r\nbeginning with the old servant Margherite, who had been with the young\r\ncouple ever since their wedding-day. People observed only that a riper\r\nage had strengthened his features, and given more character to his\r\ncountenance and more development to his powerful figure; also that he\r\nhad a scar over the right eyebrow, and that he limped slightly. These\r\nwere the marks of wounds he had received, he said; which now no longer\r\ntroubled him. He appeared anxious to return to his wife and child, but\r\nthe crowd insisted on hearing the story of his adventures during his\r\nvoluntary absence, and he was obliged to satisfy them. Eight years ago,\r\nhe said, the desire to see more of the world had gained an irresistible\r\nmastery over him; he yielded to it, and departed secretly. A natural\r\nlonging took him to his birthplace in Biscay, where he had seen his\r\nsurviving relatives. There he met the Cardinal of Burgos, who took him\r\ninto his service, promising him profit, hard knocks to give and take,\r\nand plenty of adventure. Some time after, he left the cardinal’s\r\nhousehold for that of his brother, who, much against his will, compelled\r\nhim to follow him to the war and bear arms against the French. Thus he\r\nfound himself on the Spanish side on the day of St. Quentin, and\r\nreceived a terrible gun-shot wound in the leg. Being carried into a\r\nhouse a an adjoining village, he fell into the hands of a surgeon, who\r\ninsisted that the leg must be amputated immediately, but who left him\r\nfor a moment, and never returned. Then he encountered a good old woman,\r\nwho dressed his wound and nursed him night and day. So that in a few\r\nweeks he recovered, and was able to set out for Artigues, too thankful\r\nto return to his house and land, still more to his wife and child, and\r\nfully resolved never to leave them again.\r\n\r\nHaving ended his story, he shook hands with his still wondering\r\nneighbours, addressing by name some who had been very young when he\r\nleft, and who, hearing their names, came forward now as grown men,\r\nhardly recognisable, but much pleased at being remembered. He returned\r\nhis sisters’ carresses, begged his uncle’s forgiveness for the trouble\r\nhe had given in his boyhood, recalling with mirth the various\r\ncorrections received. He mentioned also an Augustinian monk who had\r\ntaught him to read, and another reverend father, a Capuchin, whose\r\nirregular conduct had caused much scandal in the neighbourhood. In\r\nshort, notwithstanding his prolonged absence, he seemed to have a\r\nperfect recollection of places, persons, and things. The good people\r\noverwhelmed him with congratulations, vying with one another in praising\r\nhim for having the good sense to come home, and in describing the grief\r\nand the perfect virtue of his Bertrande. Emotion was excited, many wept,\r\nand several bottles from Martin Guerre’s cellar were emptied. At length\r\nthe assembly dispersed, uttering many exclamations about the\r\nextraordinary chances of Fate, and retired to their own homes, excited,\r\nastonished, and gratified, with the one exception of old Pierre Guerre,\r\nwho had been struck by an unsatisfactory remark made by his nephew, and\r\nwho dreamed all night about the chances of pecuniary loss augured by the\r\nlatter’s return.\r\n\r\nIt was midnight before the husband and wife were alone and able to give\r\nvent to their feelings. Bertrande still felt half stupefied; she could\r\nnot believe her own eyes and ears, nor realise that she saw again in her\r\nmarriage chamber her husband of eight years ago, him for whom she had\r\nwept; whose death she had deplored only a few hours previously. In the\r\nsudden shock caused by so much joy succeeding so much grief, she had not\r\nbeen able to express what she felt; her confused ideas were difficult to\r\nexplain, and she seemed deprived of the powers of speech and reflection.\r\nWhen she became calmer and more capable of analysing her feelings, she\r\nwas astonished not to feel towards her husband the same affection which\r\nhad moved her so strongly a few hours before. It was certainly himself,\r\nthose were the same features, that was the man to whom she had willingly\r\ngiven her hand, her heart, herself, and yet now that she saw him again a\r\ncold barrier of shyness, of modesty, seemed to have risen between them.\r\nHis first kiss, even, had not made her happy: she blushed and felt\r\nsaddened—a curious result of the long absence! She could not define the\r\nchanges wrought by years in his appearance: his countenance seemed\r\nharsher, yet the lines of his face, his outer man, his whole\r\npersonality, did not seem altered, but his soul had changed its nature,\r\na different mind looked forth from those eyes. Bertrande knew him for\r\nher husband, and yet she hesitated. Even so Penelope, on the, return of\r\nUlysses, required a certain proof to confirm the evidence of her eyes,\r\nand her long absent husband had to remind her of secrets known only to\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nMartin, however, as if he understood Bertrande’s feeling and divined\r\nsome secret mistrust, used the most tender and affectionate phrases, and\r\neven the very pet names which close intimacy had formerly endeared to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"My queen,\" he said, \"my beautiful dove, can you not lay aside your\r\nresentment? Is it still so strong that no submission can soften it?\r\nCannot my repentance find grace in your eyes? My Bertrande, my Bertha,\r\nmy Bertranilla, as I used to call you.\"\r\n\r\nShe tried to smile, but stopped short, puzzled; the names were the very\r\nsame, but the inflexion of voice quite different.\r\n\r\nMartin took her hands in his. \"What pretty hands! Do you still wear my\r\nring? Yes, here it is, and with it the sapphire ring I gave you the day\r\nSanxi was born.\"\r\n\r\nBertrande did not answer, but she took the child and placed him in his\r\nfather’s arms.\r\n\r\nMartin showered caresses on his son, and spoke of the time when he\r\ncarried him as a baby in the garden, lifting him up to the fruit trees,\r\nso that he could reach and try to bite the fruit. He recollected one day\r\nwhen the poor child got his leg terribly torn by thorns, and convinced\r\nhimself, not without emotion, that the scar could still be seen.\r\n\r\nBertrande was touched by this display of affectionate recollections, and\r\nfelt vexed at her own coldness. She came up to Martin and laid her hand\r\nin his. He said gently—\r\n\r\n\"My departure caused you great grief: I now repent what I did. But I was\r\nyoung, I was proud, and your reproaches were unjust.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said she, \"you have not forgotten the cause of our quarrel?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was little Rose, our neighbour, whom you said I was making love to,\r\nbecause you found us together at the spring in the little wood. I\r\nexplained that we met only by chance,—besides, she was only a child,—but\r\nyou would not listen, and in your anger—\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! forgive me, Martin, forgive me!\" she interrupted, in confusion.\r\n\r\n\"In your blind anger you took up, I know not what, something which lay\r\nhandy, and flung it at me. And here is the mark,\" he continued, smiling,\r\n\"this scar, which is still to be seen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Martin!\" Bertrande exclaimed, \"can you ever forgive me?\"\r\n\r\n\"As you see,\" Martin replied, kissing her tenderly.\r\n\r\nMuch moved, Bertrande swept aside his hair, and looked at the scar\r\nvisible on his forehead.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" she said, with surprise not free from alarm, \"this scar seems to\r\nme like a fresh one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" Martin explained, with a, little embarrassment; \"it reopened\r\nlately. But I had thought no more about it. Let us forget it, Bertrande;\r\nI should not like a recollection which might make you think yourself\r\nless dear to me than you once were.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he drew her upon his knee. She repelled him gently.\r\n\r\n\"Send the child to bed,\" said Martin. \"Tomorrow shall be for him;\r\nto-night you have the first place, Bertrande, you only.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy kissed his father and went.\r\n\r\nBertrande came and knelt beside her husband, regarding him attentively\r\nwith an uneasy smile, which did not appear to please him by any means.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" said he. \"Why do you examine me thus?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know—forgive me, oh! forgive me! . . . But the happiness of\r\nseeing you was so great and unexpected, it is all like a dream. I must\r\ntry to become accustomed to it; give me some time to collect myself; let\r\nme spend this night in prayer. I ought to offer my joy and my\r\nthanksgiving to Almighty God—\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so,\" interrupted her husband, passing his arms round her neck and\r\nstroking her beautiful hair. \"No; ’tis to me that your first thoughts\r\nare due. After so much weariness, my rest is in again beholding you, and\r\nmy happiness after so many trials will be found in your love. That hope\r\nhas supported me throughout, and I long to be assured that it is no\r\nillusion.\" So saying, he endeavoured to raise her.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" she murmured, \"I pray you leave me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" he exclaimed angrily. \"Bertrande, is this your love? Is it thus\r\nyou keep faith with me? You will make me doubt the evidence of your\r\nfriends; you will make me think that indifference, or even another\r\nlove——\"\r\n\r\n\"You insult me,\" said Bertrande, rising to her feet.\r\n\r\nHe caught her in his arms. \"No, no; I think nothing which could wound\r\nyou, my queen, and I believe your fidelity, even as before, you know, on\r\nthat first journey, when you wrote me these loving letters which I have\r\ntreasured ever since. Here they are.\" And he drew forth some papers, on\r\nwhich Bertrande recognised her own handwriting. \"Yes,\" he continued, \"I\r\nhave read and—re-read them.... See, you spoke then of your love and the\r\nsorrows of absence. But why all this trouble and terror? You tremble,\r\njust as you did when I first received you from your father’s hands....\r\nIt was here, in this very room.... You begged me then to leave you, to\r\nlet you spend the night in prayer; but I insisted, do you remember? and\r\npressed you to my heart, as I do now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" she murmured weakly, \"have pity!\"\r\n\r\nBut the words were intercepted by a kiss, and the remembrance of the\r\npast, the happiness of the present, resumed their sway; the imaginary\r\nterrors were forgotten, and the curtains closed around the marriage-bed.\r\n\r\nThe next day was a festival in the village of Artigues. Martin returned\r\nthe visits of all who had come to welcome him the previous night, and\r\nthere were endless recognitions and embracings. The young men remembered\r\nthat he had played with them when they were little; the old men, that\r\nthey had been at his wedding when he was only twelve.\r\n\r\nThe women remembered having envied Bertrande, especially the pretty\r\nRose, daughter of Marcel, the apothecary, she who had roused the demon\r\nof jealousy in, the poor wife’s heart. And Rose knew quite well that the\r\njealousy was not without some cause; for Martin had indeed shown her\r\nattention, and she was unable to see him again without emotion. She was\r\nnow the wife of a rich peasant, ugly, old, and jealous, and she\r\ncompared, sighing, her unhappy lot with that of her more fortunate\r\nneighbour. Martin’s sisters detained him amongst them, and spoke of\r\ntheir childish games and of their parents, both dead in Biscay. Martin\r\ndried the tears which flowed at these recollections of the past, and\r\nturned their thoughts to rejoicing. Banquets were given and received.\r\nMartin invited all his relations and former friends; an easy gaiety\r\nprevailed. It was remarked that the hero of the feast refrained from\r\nwine; he was thereupon reproached, but answered that on account of the\r\nwounds he had received he was obliged to avoid excess. The excuse was\r\nadmitted, the result of Martin’s precautions being that he kept a clear\r\nhead on his shoulders, while all the rest had their tongues loosed by\r\ndrunkenness.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed one of the guests, who had studied a little medicine,\r\n\"Martin is quite right to be afraid of drink. Wounds which have\r\nthoroughly healed may be reopened and inflamed by intemperance, and wine\r\nin the case of recent wounds is deadly poison. Men have died on the\r\nfield of battle in an hour or two merely because they had swallowed a\r\nlittle brandy.\"\r\n\r\nMartin Guerre grew pale, and began a conversation with the pretty Rose,\r\nhis neighbour. Bertrande observed this, but without uneasiness; she had\r\nsuffered too much from her former suspicions, besides her husband showed\r\nher so much affection that she was now quite happy.\r\n\r\nWhen the first few days were over, Martin began to look into his\r\naffairs. His property had suffered by his long absence, and he was\r\nobliged to go to Biscay to claim his little estate there, the law having\r\nalready laid hands upon it. It was several months before, by dint of\r\nmaking judicious sacrifices, he could regain possession of the house and\r\nfields which had belonged to his father. This at last accomplished, he\r\nreturned to Artigues, in order to resume the management of his wife’s\r\nproperty, and with this end in view, about eleven months after his\r\nreturn, he paid a visit to his uncle Pierre.\r\n\r\nPierre was expecting him; he was extremely polite, desired Martin, to\r\nsit down, overwhelmed him with compliments, knitting his brows as he\r\ndiscovered that his nephew decidedly meant business. Martin broke\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle,\" he said, \"I come to thank you for the care you have taken of my\r\nwife’s property; she could never have managed it alone. You have\r\nreceived the income in the family interest: as a good guardian, I\r\nexpected no less from your affection. But now that I have returned, and\r\nam free from other cares, we will go over the accounts, if you please.\"\r\n\r\nHis uncle coughed and cleared his voice before replying, then said\r\nslowly, as if counting his words—\r\n\r\n\"It is all accounted for, my dear nephew; Heaven be praised! I don’t owe\r\nyou anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed the astonished Martin, \"but the whole income?\"\r\n\r\n\"Was well and properly employed in the maintenance of your wife and\r\nchild.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! a thousand livres for that? And Bertrande lived alone, so quietly\r\nand simply! Nonsense! it is impossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any surplus,\" resumed the old man, quite unmoved,—\"any surplus went to\r\npay the expenses of seed-time and harvest.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! at a time when labour costs next to nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here is the account,\" said Pierre.\r\n\r\n\"Then the account is a false one,\" returned his nephew.\r\n\r\nPierre thought it advisable to appear extremely offended and angry, and\r\nMartin, exasperated at his evident dishonesty, took still higher ground,\r\nand threatened to bring an action against him. Pierre ordered him to\r\nleave the house, and suiting actions to words, took hold of his arm to\r\nenforce his departure. Martin, furious, turned and raised his fist to\r\nstrike.\r\n\r\n\"What! strike your uncle, wretched boy!\" exclaimed the old man.\r\n\r\nMartin’s hand dropped, but he left the house uttering reproaches and\r\ninsults, among which Pierre distinguished—\r\n\r\n\"Cheat that you are!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a word I shall remember,\" cried the angry old man, slamming his\r\ndoor violently.\r\n\r\nMartin brought an action before the judge at Rieux, and in course of\r\ntime obtained a decree, which, reviewing the accounts presented by\r\nPierre, disallowed them, and condemned the dishonest guardian to pay his\r\nnephew four hundred livres for each year of his administration. The day\r\non which this sum had to be disbursed from his strong box the old usurer\r\nvowed vengeance, but until he could gratify his hatred he was forced to\r\nconceal it, and to receive attempts at reconciliation with a friendly\r\nsmile. It was not until six months later, on the occasion of a joyous\r\nfestivity, that Martin again set foot in his uncle’s house. The bells\r\nwere ringing for the birth of a child, there was great gaiety at\r\nBertrande’s house, where all the guests were waiting on the threshold\r\nfor the godfather in order to take the infant to church, and when Martin\r\nappeared, escorting his uncle, who was adorned with a huge bouquet for\r\nthe occasion, and who now came forward and took the hand of Rose, the\r\npretty godmother, there were cries of joy on all sides. Bertrande was\r\ndelighted at this reconciliation, and dreamed only of happiness. She was\r\nso happy now, her long sorrow was atoned for, her regret was at an end,\r\nher prayers seemed to have been heard, the long interval between the\r\nformer delights and the present seemed wiped out as if the bond of union\r\nhad never been broken, and if she remembered her grief at all, it was\r\nonly to intensify the new joys by comparison. She loved her husband more\r\nthan ever; he was full of affection for her, and she was grateful for\r\nhis love. The past had now no shadow, the future no cloud, and the birth\r\nof a daughter, drawing still closer the links which united them, seemed\r\na new pledge of felicity. Alas! the horizon which appeared so bright and\r\nclear to the poor woman was doomed soon again to be overcast.\r\n\r\nThe very evening of the christening party, a band of musicians and\r\njugglers happened to pass through the village, and the inhabitants\r\nshowed themselves liberal. Pierre asked questions, and found that the\r\nleader of the band was a Spaniard. He invited the man to his own house,\r\nand remained closeted with him for nearly an hour, dismissing him at\r\nlength with a refilled purse. Two days later the old man announced to\r\nthe family that he was going to Picardy to see a former partner on a\r\nmatter of business, and he departed accordingly, saying he should return\r\nbefore long.\r\n\r\nThe day on which Bertrande again saw her uncle was, indeed, a terrible\r\none. She was sitting by the cradle of the lately-born infant, watching\r\nfor its awakening, when the door opened, and Pierre Guerre strode in.\r\nBertrande drew back with an instinct of terror as soon as she saw him,\r\nfor his expression was at once wicked and joyful—an expression of\r\ngratified hate, of mingled rage and triumph, and his smile was terrible\r\nto behold. She did not venture to speak, but motioned him to a seat. He\r\ncame straight up to her, and raising his head, said loudly—\r\n\r\n\"Kneel down at once, madame—kneel down, and ask pardon from Almighty\r\nGod!\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you mad, Pierre?\" she replied, gazing at him in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"You, at least, ought to know that I am not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray for forgiveness—I—! and what for, in Heaven’s name?\"\r\n\r\n\"For the crime in which you are an accomplice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please explain yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said Pierre, with bitter irony, \"a woman always thinks herself\r\ninnocent as long as her sin is hidden; she thinks the truth will never\r\nbe known, and her conscience goes quietly to sleep, forgetting her\r\nfaults. Here is a woman who thought her sins nicely concealed; chance\r\nfavoured her: an absent husband, probably no more; another man so\r\nexactly like him in height, face, and manner that everyone else is\r\ndeceived! Is it strange that a weak, sensitive woman, wearied of\r\nwidowhood, should willingly allow herself to be imposed on?\"\r\n\r\nBertrande listened without understanding; she tried to interrupt, but\r\nPierre went on—\r\n\r\n\"It was easy to accept this stranger without having to blush for it,\r\neasy to give him the name and the rights of a husband! She could even\r\nappear faithful while really guilty; she could seem constant, though\r\nreally fickle; and she could, under a veil of mystery, at once reconcile\r\nher honour, her duty—perhaps even her love.\"\r\n\r\n\"What on earth do you mean?\" cried Bertrande, wringing her hands in\r\nterror.\r\n\r\n\"That you are countenancing an impostor who is not your husband.\"\r\n\r\nFeeling as if the ground were passing from beneath her, Bertrande\r\nstaggered, and caught at the nearest piece of furniture to save herself\r\nfrom falling; then, collecting all her strength to meet this\r\nextraordinary attack, she faced the old man.\r\n\r\n\"What! my husband, your nephew, an impostor!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don’t you know it?\" \"I!!\"\r\n\r\nThis cry, which came from her heart, convinced Pierre that she did not\r\nknow, and that she had sustained a terrible shock. He continued more\r\nquietly—\r\n\r\n\"What, Bertrande, is it possible you were really deceived?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pierre, you are killing me; your words are torture. No more mystery, I\r\nentreat. What do you know? What do you suspect? Tell me plainly at\r\nonce.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you courage to hear it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I must,\" said the trembling woman.\r\n\r\n\"God is my witness that I would willingly have kept it from you, but you\r\nmust know; if only for the safety of your soul entangled in so deadly a\r\nsnare,... there is yet time, if you follow my advice. Listen: the man\r\nwith whom you are living, who dares to call himself Martin Guerre, is a\r\ncheat, an impostor——\"\r\n\r\n\"How dare you say so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I have discovered it. Yes, I had always a vague suspicion, an\r\nuneasy feeling, and in spite of the marvellous resemblance I could never\r\nfeel as if he were really my sister’s child. The day he raised his hand\r\nto strike me—yes, that day I condemned him utterly.... Chance has\r\njustified me! A wandering Spaniard, an old soldier, who spent a night in\r\nthe village here, was also present at the battle of St. Quentin, and saw\r\nMartin Guerre receive a terrible gunshot wound in the leg. After the\r\nbattle, being wounded, he betook himself to the neighbouring village,\r\nand distinctly heard a surgeon in the next room say that a wounded man\r\nmust have his leg amputated, and would very likely not survive the\r\noperation. The door opened, he saw the sufferer, and knew him for Martin\r\nGuerre. So much the Spaniard told me. Acting on this information, I went\r\non pretence of business to the village he named, I questioned the\r\ninhabitants, and this is what I learned.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" said Bertrande, pale, and gasping with emotion.\r\n\r\n\"I learned that the wounded man had his leg taken off, and, as the\r\nsurgeon predicted, he must have died in a few hours, for he was never\r\nseen again.\"\r\n\r\nBertrande remained a few moments as if annihilated by this appalling\r\nrevelation; then, endeavoring to repel the horrible thought—\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she cried, \"no, it is impossible! It is a lie intended to ruin\r\nhim-to ruin us all.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! you do not believe me?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, never, never!\"\r\n\r\n\"Say rather you pretend to disbelieve me: the truth has pierced your\r\nheart, but you wish to deny it. Think, however, of the danger to your\r\nimmortal soul.\"\r\n\r\n\"Silence, wretched man!... No, God would not send me so terrible a\r\ntrial. What proof can you show of the truth of your words?\"\r\n\r\n\"The witnesses I have mentioned.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing more?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not as yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine proofs indeed! The story of a vagabond who flattered your hatred\r\nin hope of a reward, the gossip of a distant village, the recollections\r\nof ten years back, and finally, your own word, the word of a man who\r\nseeks only revenge, the word of a man who swore to make Martin pay\r\ndearly for the results of his own avarice, a man of furious passions\r\nsuch as yours! No, Pierre, no, I do not believe you, and I never will!\"\r\n\r\n\"Other people may perhaps be less incredulous, and if I accuse him\r\npublicly——\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I shall contradict you publicly!\" And coming quickly forward, her\r\neyes shining with virtuous anger—\r\n\r\n\"Leave this house, go,\" she said; \"it is you yourself who are the\r\nimpostor—go!\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall yet know how to convince everyone, and will make you\r\nacknowledge it,\" cried the furious old man.\r\n\r\nHe went out, and Bertrande sank exhausted into a chair. All the strength\r\nwhich had supported her against Pierre vanished as soon as she was\r\nalone, and in spite of her resistance to suspicion, the terrible light\r\nof doubt penetrated her heart, and extinguished the pure torch of\r\ntrustfulness which had guided her hitherto—a doubt, alas! which attacked\r\nat once her honour and her love, for she loved with all a woman’s tender\r\naffection. Just as actual poison gradually penetrates and circulates\r\nthrough the whole system, corrupting the blood and affecting the very\r\nsources of life until it causes the destruction of the whole body, so\r\ndoes that mental poison, suspicion, extend its ravages in the soul which\r\nhas received it. Bertrande remembered with terror her first feelings at\r\nthe sight of the returned Martin Guerre, her involuntary repugnance, her\r\nastonishment at not feeling more in touch with the husband whom she had\r\nso sincerely regretted. She remembered also, as if she saw it for the\r\nfirst time, that Martin, formerly quick, lively, and hasty tempered, now\r\nseemed thoughtful, and fully master of himself.\r\n\r\nThis change of character she had supposed due to the natural development\r\nof age, she now trembled at the idea of another possible cause. Some\r\nother little details began to occur to her mind—the forgetfulness or\r\nabstraction of her husband as to a few insignificant things; thus it\r\nsometimes happened that he did not answer to his name of Martin, also\r\nthat he mistook the road to a hermitage, formerly well known to them\r\nboth, and again that he could not answer when addressed in Basque,\r\nalthough he him self had taught her the little she knew of this\r\nlanguage. Besides, since his return, he would never write in her\r\npresence, did he fear that she would notice some difference? She had\r\npaid little or no attention to these trifles; now, pieced together, they\r\nassumed an alarming importance. An appalling terror seized Bertrande:\r\nwas she to remain in this uncertainty, or should she seek an explanation\r\nwhich might prove her destruction? And how discover the truth—by\r\nquestioning the guilty man, by noting his confusion, his change of\r\ncolour, by forcing a confession from him? But she had lived with him for\r\ntwo years, he was the father of her child, she could not ruin him\r\nwithout ruining herself, and, an explanation once sought, she could\r\nneither punish him and escape disgrace, nor pardon him without sharing\r\nhis guilt. To reproach him with his conduct and then keep silence would\r\ndestroy her peace for ever; to cause a scandal by denouncing him would\r\nbring dishonour upon herself and her child. Night found her involved in\r\nthese hideous perplexities, too weak to surmount them; an icy chill came\r\nover her, she went to bed, and awoke in a high fever. For several days\r\nshe hovered between life and death, and Martin Guerre bestowed the most\r\ntender care upon her. She was greatly moved thereby, having one of those\r\nimpressionable minds which recognise kindness fully as much as injury.\r\nWhen she was a little recovered and her mental power began to return,\r\nshe had only a vague recollection of what had occurred, and thought she\r\nhad had a frightful dream. She asked if Pierre Guerre had been to see\r\nher, and found he had not been near the house. This could only be\r\nexplained by the scene which had taken place, and she then recollected\r\nall the accusation Pierre had made, her own observations which had\r\nconfirmed it, all her grief and trouble. She inquired about the village\r\nnews. Pierre, evidently, had kept silence why? Had he seen that his\r\nsuspicions were unjust, or was he only seeking further evidence? She\r\nsank back into her cruel uncertainty, and resolved to watch Martin\r\nclosely, before deciding as to his guilt or innocence.\r\n\r\nHow was she to suppose that God had created two faces so exactly alike,\r\ntwo beings precisely similar, and then sent them together into the\r\nworld, and on the same track, merely to compass the ruin of an unhappy\r\nwoman! A terrible idea took possession of her mind, an idea not uncommon\r\nin an age of superstition, namely, that the Enemy himself could assume\r\nhuman form, and could borrow the semblance of a dead man in order to\r\ncapture another soul for his infernal kingdom. Acting on this idea, she\r\nhastened to the church, paid for masses to be said, and prayed\r\nfervently. She expected every day to see the demon forsake the body he\r\nhad animated, but her vows, offerings, and prayers had no result. But\r\nHeaven sent her an idea which she wondered had not occurred to her\r\nsooner. \"If the Tempter,\" she said to herself, \"has taken the form of my\r\nbeloved husband, his power being supreme for evil, the resemblance would\r\nbe exact, and no difference, however slight, would exist. If, however,\r\nit is only another man who resembles him, God must have made them with\r\nsome slight distinguishing marks.\"\r\n\r\nShe then remembered, what she had not thought of before, having been\r\nquite unsuspicious before her uncle’s accusation, and nearly out of her\r\nmind between mental and bodily suffering since. She remembered that on\r\nher husband’s left shoulder, almost on the neck, there used to be one of\r\nthose small, almost imperceptible, but ineffaceable birthmarks. Martin\r\nwore his hair very long, it was difficult to see if the mark were there\r\nor not. One night, while he slept, Bertrande cut away a lock of hair\r\nfrom the place where this sign ought to be—it was not there!\r\n\r\nConvinced at length of the deception, Bertrande suffered inexpressible\r\nanguish. This man whom she had loved and respected for two whole years,\r\nwhom she had taken to her heart as a husband bitterly mourned for—this\r\nman was a cheat, an infamous impostor, and she, all unknowing, was yet a\r\nguilty woman! Her child was illegitimate, and the curse of Heaven was\r\ndue to this sacrilegious union. To complete the misfortune, she was\r\nalready expecting another infant. She would have killed herself, but her\r\nreligion and the love of her children forbade it. Kneeling before her\r\nchild’s cradle, she entreated pardon from the father of the one for the\r\nfather of the other. She would not bring herself to proclaim aloud their\r\ninfamy.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" she said, \"thou whom I loved, thou who art no more, thou knowest\r\nno guilty thought ever entered my mind! When I saw this man, I thought I\r\nbeheld thee; when I was happy, I thought I owed it to thee; it was thee\r\nwhom I loved in him. Surely thou dost not desire that by a public avowal\r\nI should bring shame and disgrace on these children and on myself.\"\r\n\r\nShe rose calm and strengthened: it seemed as if a heavenly inspiration\r\nhad marked out her duty. To suffer in silence, such was the course she\r\nadopted,—a life of sacrifice and self-denial which she offered to God as\r\nan expiation for her involuntary sin. But who can understand the\r\nworkings of the human heart? This man whom she ought to have loathed,\r\nthis man who had made her an innocent partner in his crime, this\r\nunmasked impostor whom she should have beheld only with disgust,\r\nshe-loved him! The force of habit, the ascendancy he had obtained over\r\nher, the love he had shown her, a thousand sympathies felt in her inmost\r\nheart, all these had so much influence, that, instead of accusing and\r\ncursing him, she sought to excuse him on the plea of a passion to which,\r\ndoubtless, he had yielded when usurping the name and place of another.\r\nShe feared punishment for him yet more than disgrace for herself, and\r\nthough resolved to no longer allow him the rights purchased by crime,\r\nshe yet trembled at the idea of losing his love. It was this above all\r\nwhich decided her to keep eternal silence about her discovery; one\r\nsingle word which proved that his imposture was known would raise an\r\ninsurmountable barrier between them.\r\n\r\nTo conceal her trouble entirely was, however, beyond her power; her eyes\r\nfrequently showed traces of her secret tears. Martin several times asked\r\nthe cause of her sorrow; she tried to smile and excuse herself, only\r\nimmediately sinking back into her gloomy thoughts. Martin thought it\r\nmere caprice; he observed her loss of colour, her hollow cheeks, and\r\nconcluded that age was impairing her beauty, and became less attentive\r\nto her. His absences became longer and more frequent, and he did not\r\nconceal his impatience and annoyance at being watched; for her looks\r\nhung upon his, and she observed his coldness and change with much grief.\r\nHaving sacrificed all in order to retain his love, she now saw it slowly\r\nslipping away from her.\r\n\r\nAnother person also observed attentively. Pierre Guerre since his\r\nexplanation with Bertrande had apparently discovered no more evidence,\r\nand did not dare to bring an accusation without some positive proofs.\r\nConsequently he lost no chance of watching the proceedings of his\r\nsupposed nephew, silently hoping that chance might put him on the track\r\nof a discovery. He also concluded from Bertrande’s state of melancholy\r\nthat she had convinced herself of the fraud, but had resolved to conceal\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMartin was then endeavoring to sell a part of his property, and this\r\nnecessitated frequent interviews with the lawyers of the neighbouring\r\ntown. Twice in the week he went to Rieux, and to make the journey\r\neasier, used to start horseback about seven in the evening, sleep at\r\nRieux, and return the following afternoon. This arrangement did not\r\nescape his enemy’s notice, who was not long in convincing himself that\r\npart of the time ostensibly spent on this journey was otherwise\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nTowards ten o’clock on the evening of a dark night, the door of a small\r\nhouse lying about half a gunshot from the village opened gently for the\r\nexit of a man wrapped in a large cloak, followed by a young woman, who\r\naccompanied him some distance. Arrived at the parting point, they\r\nseparated with a tender kiss and a few murmured words of adieu; the\r\nlover took his horse, which was fastened to a tree, mounted, and rode\r\noff towards Rieux. When the sounds died away, the woman turned slowly\r\nand sadly towards her home, but as she approached the door a man\r\nsuddenly turned the corner of the house and barred her away. Terrified,\r\nshe was on the point of crying for help, when he seized her arm and\r\nordered her to be silent.\r\n\r\n\"Rose,\" he whispered, \"I know everything: that man is your lover. In\r\norder to receive him safely, you send your old husband to sleep by means\r\nof a drug stolen from your father’s shop. This intrigue has been going\r\non for a month; twice a week, at seven o’clock, your door is opened to\r\nthis man, who does not proceed on his way to the town until ten. I know\r\nyour lover: he is my nephew.\"\r\n\r\nPetrified with terror, Rose fell on her knees and implored mercy.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Pierre, \"you may well be frightened: I have your secret.\r\nI have only to publish it and you are ruined for ever:\"\r\n\r\nYou will not do it! \"entreated the guilty woman, clasping her hands.\r\n\r\n\"I have only to tell your husband,\" continued Pierre, \"that his wife has\r\ndishonoured him, and to explain the reason of his unnaturally heavy\r\nsleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will kill me!\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt: he is jealous, he is an Italian, he will know how to avenge\r\nhimself—even as I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I never did you any harm,\" Rose cried in despair. \"Oh! have pity,\r\nhave mercy, and spare me!\"\r\n\r\n\"On one condition.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come with me.\"\r\n\r\nTerrified almost out of her mind, Rose allowed him to lead her away.\r\n\r\nBertrande had just finished her evening prayer, and was preparing for\r\nbed, when she was startled by several knocks at her door. Thinking that\r\nperhaps some neighbour was in need of help, she opened it immediately,\r\nand to her astonishment beheld a dishevelled woman whom Pierre grasped\r\nby the arm. He exclaimed vehemently—\r\n\r\n\"Here is thy judge! Now, confess all to Bertrande!\"\r\n\r\nBertrande did not at once recognise the woman, who fell at her feet,\r\novercome by Pierre’s threats.\r\n\r\n\"Tell the truth here,\" he continued, \"or I go and tell it to your\r\nhusband, at your own home!\"—\"Ah! madame, kill me,\" said the unhappy\r\ncreature, hiding her face; \"let me rather die by your hand than his!\"\r\n\r\nBertrande, bewildered, did not understand the position in the least, but\r\nshe recognised Rose—\r\n\r\n\"But what is the matter, madame? Why are you here at this hour, pale and\r\nweeping? Why has my uncle dragged you hither? I am to judge you, does he\r\nsay? Of what crime are you guilty?\"\r\n\r\n\"Martin might answer that, if he were here,\" remarked Pierre.\r\n\r\nA lightning flash of jealousy shot through Bertrande’s soul at these\r\nwords, all her former suspicions revived.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" she said, \"my husband! What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"That he left this woman’s house only a little while ago, that for a\r\nmonth they have been meeting secretly. You are betrayed: I have seen\r\nthem and she does not dare to deny it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have mercy!\" cried Rose, still kneeling.\r\n\r\nThe cry was a confession. Bertrande became pale as death. \"O God!\" she\r\nmurmured, \"deceived, betrayed—and by him!\"\r\n\r\n\"For a month past,\" repeated the old man.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! the wretch,\" she continued, with increasing passion; \"then his\r\nwhole life is a lie! He has abused my credulity, he now abuses my love!\r\nHe does not know me! He thinks he can trample on me—me, in whose power\r\nare his fortune, his honour, his very life itself!\"\r\n\r\nThen, turning to Rose—\r\n\r\n\"And you, miserable woman! by what unworthy artifice did you gain his\r\nlove? Was it by witchcraft? or some poisonous philtre learned from your\r\nworthy father?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! no, madame; my weakness is my only crime, and also my only\r\nexcuse. I loved him, long ago, when I was only a young girl, and these\r\nmemories have been my ruin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Memories? What! did you also think you were loving the same man? Are\r\nyou also his dupe? Or are you only pretending, in order to find a rag of\r\nexcuse to cover your wickedness?\"\r\n\r\nIt was now Rose who failed to understand; Bertrande continued, with\r\ngrowing excitement—\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it was not enough to usurp the rights of a husband and father, he\r\nthought to play his part still better by deceiving the mistress also . .\r\n. . Ah! it is amusing, is it not? You also, Rose, you thought he was\r\nyour old lover! Well, I at least am excusable, I the wife, who only\r\nthought she was faithful to her husband!\"\r\n\r\n\"What does it all mean?\" asked the terrified Rose.\r\n\r\n\"It means that this man is an impostor and that I will unmask him.\r\nRevenge! revenge!\"\r\n\r\nPierre came forward. \"Bertrande,\" he said, \"so long as I thought you\r\nwere happy, when I feared to disturb your peace, I was silent, I\r\nrepressed my just indignation, and I spared the usurper of the name and\r\nrights of my nephew. Do you now give me leave to speak?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she replied in a hollow voice.\r\n\r\n\"You will not contradict me?\"\r\n\r\nBy way of answer she sat down by the table and wrote a few hasty lines\r\nwith a trembling hand, then gave them to Pierre, whose eyes sparkled\r\nwith joy.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"vengeance for him, but for her pity. Let this\r\nhumiliation be her only punishment. I promised silence in return for\r\nconfession, will you grant it?\"\r\n\r\nBertrande assented with a contemptuous gesture.\r\n\r\n\"Go, fear not,\" said the old man, and Rose went out. Pierre also left\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nLeft to herself, Bertrande felt utterly worn out by so much emotion;\r\nindignation gave way to depression. She began to realise what she had\r\ndone, and the scandal which would fall on her own head. Just then her\r\nbaby awoke, and held out its arms, smiling, and calling for its father.\r\nIts father, was he not a criminal? Yes! but was it for her to ruin him,\r\nto invoke the law, to send him to death, after having taken him to her\r\nheart, to deliver him to infamy which would recoil on her own head and\r\nher child’s and on the infant which was yet unborn? If he had sinned\r\nbefore God, was it not for God to punish him? If against herself, ought\r\nshe not rather to overwhelm him with contempt? But to invoke the help,\r\nof strangers to expiate this offence; to lay bare the troubles of her\r\nlife, to unveil the sanctuary of the nuptial couch—in short, to summon\r\nthe whole world to behold this fatal scandal, was not that what in her\r\nimprudent anger she had really done? She repented bitterly of her haste,\r\nshe sought to avert the consequences, and notwithstanding the night and\r\nthe bad weather, she hurried at once to Pierre’s dwelling, hoping at all\r\ncosts to withdraw her denunciation. He was not there: he had at once\r\ntaken a horse and started for Rieux. Her accusation was already on its\r\nway to the magistrates!\r\n\r\nAt break of day the house where Martin Guerre lodged when at Rieux was\r\nsurrounded by soldiers. He came forward with confidence and inquired\r\nwhat was wanted. On hearing the accusation, he changed colour slightly,\r\nthen collected himself, and made no resistance. When he came before the\r\njudge, Bertrande’s petition was read to him, declaring him to be \"an\r\nimpostor, who falsely, audaciously, and treacherously had deceived her\r\nby taking the name and assuming the person of Martin Guerre,\" and\r\ndemanding that he should be required to entreat pardon from God, the\r\nking, and herself.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner listened calmly to the charge, and met it courageously,\r\nonly evincing profound surprise at such a step being taken by a wife who\r\nhad lived with him for two years since his return, and who only now\r\nthought of disputing the rights he had so long enjoyed. As he was\r\nignorant both of Bertrande’s suspicions and their confirmation, and also\r\nof the jealousy which had inspired her accusation, his astonishment was\r\nperfectly natural, and did not at all appear to be assumed. He\r\nattributed the whole charge to the machinations of his uncle, Pierre\r\nGuerre; an old man, he said, who, being governed entirely by avarice and\r\nthe desire of revenge, now disputed his name and rights, in order the\r\nbetter to deprive him of his property, which might be worth from sixteen\r\nto eighteen hundred livres. In order to attain his end, this wicked man\r\nhad not hesitated to pervert his wife’s mind, and at the risk of her own\r\ndishonour had instigated this calumnious charge—a horrible and\r\nunheard-of thing in the mouth of a lawful wife. \"Ah! I do not blame\r\nher,\" he cried; \"she must suffer more than I do, if she really\r\nentertains doubts such as these; but I deplore her readiness to listen\r\nto these extraordinary calumnies originated by my enemy.\"\r\n\r\nThe judge was a good deal impressed by so much assurance. The accused\r\nwas relegated to prison, whence he was brought two days later to\r\nencounter a formal examination.\r\n\r\nHe began by explaining the cause of his long absence, originating, he\r\nsaid, in a domestic quarrel, as his wife well remembered. He there\r\nrelated his life during these eight years. At first he wandered over the\r\ncountry, wherever his curiosity and the love of travel led him. He then\r\nhad crossed the frontier, revisited Biscay, where he was born, and\r\nhaving entered the service of the Cardinal of Burgos, he passed thence\r\ninto the army of the King of Spain. He was wounded at the battle of St.\r\nQuentin, conveyed to a neighbouring village, where he recovered,\r\nalthough threatened with amputation. Anxious to again behold his wife\r\nand child, his other relations and the land of his adoption, he returned\r\nto Artigues, where he was immediately recognised by everyone, including\r\nthe identical Pierre Guerre, his uncle, who now had the cruelty to\r\ndisavow him. In fact, the latter had shown him special affection up to\r\nthe day when Martin required an account of his stewardship. Had he only\r\nhad the cowardice to sacrifice his money and thereby defraud his\r\nchildren, he would not to-day be charged as an impostor. \"But,\"\r\ncontinued Martin, \"I resisted, and a violent quarrel ensued, in which\r\nanger perhaps carried me too far; Pierre Guerre, cunning and revengeful,\r\nhas waited in silence. He has taken his time and his measures to\r\norganise this plot, hoping thereby to obtain his ends, to bring justice\r\nto the help of his avarice, and to acquire the spoils he coveted, and\r\nrevenge for his defeat, by means of a sentence obtained from the\r\nscruples of the judges.\" Besides these explanations, which did not\r\nappear wanting in probability, Martin vehemently protested his\r\ninnocence, demanding that his wife should be confronted with him, and\r\ndeclaring that in his presence she would not sustain the charge of\r\npersonation brought against him, and that her mind not being animated by\r\nthe blind hatred which dominated his persecutor, the truth would\r\nundoubtedly prevail.\r\n\r\nHe now, in his turn, demanded that the judge should acknowledge his\r\ninnocence, and prove it by condemning his calumniators to the punishment\r\ninvoked against himself; that his wife, Bertrande de Rolls, should be\r\nsecluded in some house where her mind could no longer be perverted, and,\r\nfinally, that his innocence should be declared, and expenses and\r\ncompensations awarded him.\r\n\r\nAfter this speech, delivered with warmth, and with every token of\r\nsincerity, he answered without difficulty all the interrogations of the\r\njudge. The following are some of the questions and answers, just as they\r\nhave come down to us:—\r\n\r\n\"In what part of Biscay were you born?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the village of Aymes, province of Guipuscoa.\"\r\n\r\n\"What were the names of your parents?\"\r\n\r\n\"Antonio Guerre and Marie Toreada.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are they still living?\"\r\n\r\n\"My father died June 15th, 1530; my mother survived him three years and\r\ntwelve days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you any brothers and sisters?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had one brother, who only lived three months. My four sisters, Inez,\r\nDorothea, Marietta, and Pedrina, all came to live at Artigues when I\r\ndid; they are there still, and they all recognised me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the date of your marriage?\"\r\n\r\n\"January 10, 1539.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who were present at the ceremony?\"\r\n\r\n\"My father-in-law, my mother-in-law, my uncle, my two sisters, Maitre\r\nMarcel and his daughter Rose; a neighbour called Claude Perrin, who got\r\ndrunk at the wedding feast; also Giraud, the poet, who composed verses\r\nin our honour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was the priest who married you?\"\r\n\r\n\"The old cure, Pascal Guerin, whom I did not find alive when I\r\nreturned.\"\r\n\r\n\"What special circumstances occurred on the wedding-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"At midnight exactly, our neighbour, Catherine Boere, brought us the\r\nrepast which is known as ’medianoche.’ This woman has recognised me, as\r\nalso our old Marguerite, who has remained with us ever since the\r\nwedding.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the date of your son’s birth?\"\r\n\r\n\"February 10, 1548, nine years after our marriage. I was only twelve\r\nwhen the ceremony took place, and did not arrive at manhood till several\r\nyears later.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give the date of your leaving Artigues.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was in August 1549. As I left the village, I met Claude Perrin and\r\nthe cure Pascal, and took leave of them. I went towards Beauvais, and I\r\npassed through Orleans, Bourges, Limoges, Bordeaux, and Toulouse. If you\r\nwant the names of people whom I saw and to whom I spoke, you can have\r\nthem. What more can I say?\"\r\n\r\nNever, indeed, was there a more apparently veracious statement! All the\r\ndoings of Martin Guerre seemed to be most faithfully described, and\r\nsurely only himself could thus narrate his own actions. As the historian\r\nremarks, alluding to the story of Amphitryon, Mercury himself could not\r\nbetter reproduce all Sosia’s actions, gestures, and words, than did the\r\nfalse Martin Guerre those of the real one.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the demand of the accused, Bertrande de Rolls was\r\ndetained in seclusion, in order to remove her from the influence of\r\nPierre Guerre. The latter, however, did not waste time, and during the\r\nmonth spent in examining the witnesses cited by Martin, his diligent\r\nenemy, guided by some vague traces, departed on a journey, from which he\r\ndid not return alone.\r\n\r\nAll the witnesses bore out the statement of the accused; the latter\r\nheard this in prison, and rejoiced, hoping for a speedy release. Before\r\nlong he was again brought before the judge, who told him that his\r\ndeposition had been confirmed by all the witnesses examined.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know of no others?\" continued the magistrate. \"Have you no\r\nrelatives except those you have mentioned?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no others,\" answered the prisoner.\r\n\r\n\"Then what do you say to this man?\" said the judge, opening a door.\r\n\r\nAn old man issued forth, who fell on the prisoner’s neck, exclaiming,\r\n\"My nephew!\"\r\n\r\nMartin trembled in every limb, but only for a moment. Promptly\r\nrecovering himself, and gazing calmly at the newcomer, he asked coolly—\r\n\r\n\"And who may you be?\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" said the old man, \"do you not know me? Dare you deny me?—me,\r\nyour mother’s brother, Carbon Barreau, the old soldier! Me, who dandled\r\nyou on my knee in your infancy; me, who taught you later to carry a\r\nmusket; me, who met you during the war at an inn in Picardy, when you\r\nfled secretly. Since then I have sought you everywhere; I have spoken of\r\nyou, and described your face and person, until a worthy inhabitant of\r\nthis country offered to bring me hither, where indeed I did not expect\r\nto find my sister’s son imprisoned and fettered as a malefactor. What is\r\nhis crime, may it please your honour?\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall hear,\" replied the magistrate. \"Then you identify the\r\nprisoner as your nephew? You affirm his name to be—-?\"\r\n\r\n\"Arnauld du Thill, also called ’Pansette,’ after his father, Jacques\r\nPansa. His mother was Therese Barreau, my sister, and he was born in the\r\nvillage of Sagias.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have you to say?\" demanded the judge, turning to the accused.\r\n\r\n\"Three things,\" replied the latter, unabashed, \"this man is either mad,\r\nor he has been suborned to tell lies, or he is simply mistaken.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man was struck dumb with astonishment. But his supposed nephew’s\r\nstart of terror had not been lost upon the judge, also much impressed by\r\nthe straightforward frankness of Carbon Barreau. He caused fresh\r\ninvestigations to be made, and other inhabitants of Sagias were summoned\r\nto Rieux, who one and all agreed in identifying the accused as the same\r\nArnauld du Thill who had been born and had grown up under their very\r\neyes. Several deposed that as he grew up he had taken to evil courses,\r\nand become an adept in theft and lying, not fearing even to take the\r\nsacred name of God in vain, in order to cover the untruth of his daring\r\nassertions. From such testimony the judge naturally concluded that\r\nArnauld du Thill was quite capable of carrying on, an imposture, and\r\nthat the impudence which he displayed was natural to his character.\r\nMoreover, he noted that the prisoner, who averred that he was born in\r\nBiscay, knew only a few words of the Basque language, and used these\r\nquite wrongly. He heard later another witness who deposed that the\r\noriginal Martin Guerre was a good wrestler and skilled in the art of\r\nfence, whereas the prisoner, having wished to try what he could do,\r\nshowed no skill whatever. Finally, a shoemaker was interrogated, and his\r\nevidence was not the least damning. Martin Guerre, he declared, required\r\ntwelve holes to lace his boots, and his surprise had been great when he\r\nfound those of the prisoner had only nine. Considering all these points,\r\nand the cumulative evidence, the judge of Rieux set aside the favourable\r\ntestimony, which he concluded had been the outcome of general credulity,\r\nimposed on by an extraordinary resemblance. He gave due weight also to\r\nBertrande’s accusation, although she had never confirmed it, and now\r\nmaintained an obstinate silence; and he pronounced a judgment by which\r\nArnauld du Thill was declared \"attainted and convicted of imposture, and\r\nwas therefore condemned to be beheaded; after which his body should be\r\ndivided into four quarters, and exposed at the four corners of the\r\ntown.\"\r\n\r\nThis sentence, as soon as it was known, caused much diversity of opinion\r\nin the town. The prisoner’s enemies praised the wisdom of the judge, and\r\nthose less prejudiced condemned his decision; as such conflicting\r\ntestimony left room for doubt. Besides, it was thought that the\r\npossession of property and the future of the children required much\r\nconsideration, also that the most absolute certainty was demanded before\r\nannulling a past of two whole years, untroubled by any counter claim\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nThe condemned man appealed from this sentence to the Parliament of\r\nToulouse. This court decided that the case required more careful\r\nconsideration than had yet been given to it, and began by ordering\r\nArnauld du Thill to be confronted with Pierre Guerre and Bertrande de\r\nRolls.\r\n\r\nWho can say what feelings animate a man who, already once condemned,\r\nfinds himself subjected to a second trial? The torture scarcely ended\r\nbegins again, and Hope, though reduced to a shadow, regains her sway\r\nover his imagination, which clings to her skirts, as it were, with\r\ndesperation. The exhausting efforts must be recommenced; it is the last\r\nstruggle—a struggle which is more desperate in proportion as there is\r\nless strength to maintain it. In this case the defendant was not one of\r\nthose who are easily cast down; he collected all his energy, all his\r\ncourage, hoping to come victoriously out of the new combat which lay\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\nThe magistrates assembled in the great hall of the Parliament, and the\r\nprisoner appeared before them. He had first to deal with Pierre, and\r\nconfronted him calmly, letting him speak, without showing any emotion.\r\nHe then replied with indignant reproaches, dwelling on Pierre’s greed\r\nand avarice, his vows of vengeance, the means employed to work upon\r\nBertrande, his secret manoeuvres in order to gain his ends, and the\r\nunheard-of animosity displayed in hunting up accusers, witnesses, and\r\ncalumniators. He defied Pierre to prove that he was not Martin Guerre,\r\nhis nephew, inasmuch as Pierre had publicly acknowledged and embraced\r\nhim, and his tardy suspicions only dated from the time of their violent\r\nquarrel. His language was so strong and vehement, that Pierre became\r\nconfused and was unable to answer, and the encounter turned entirely in\r\nArnauld’s favour, who seemed to overawe his adversary from a height of\r\ninjured innocence, while the latter appeared as a disconcerted\r\nslanderer.\r\n\r\nThe scene of his confrontation with Bertrande took a wholly different\r\ncharacter. The poor woman, pale, cast down, worn by sorrow, came\r\nstaggering before the tribunal, in an almost fainting condition. She\r\nendeavoured to collect herself, but as soon as she saw the prisoner she\r\nhung her head and covered her face with her hands. He approached her and\r\nbesought her in the gentlest accents not to persist in an accusation\r\nwhich might send him to the scaffold, not thus to avenge any sins he\r\nmight have committed against her, although he could not reproach himself\r\nwith any really serious fault.\r\n\r\nBertrande started, and murmured in a whisper, \"And Rose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" Arnauld exclaimed, astonished at this revelation.\r\n\r\nHis part was instantly taken. Turning to the judges—\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"my wife is a jealous woman! Ten years ago, when I\r\nleft her, she had formed these suspicions; they were the cause of my\r\nvoluntary exile. To-day she again accuses me of, guilty relations with\r\nthe same person; I neither deny nor acknowledge them, but I affirm that\r\nit is the blind passion of jealousy which, aided by my uncle’s\r\nsuggestions, guided my wife’s hand when she signed this denunciation.\"\r\n\r\nBertrande remained silent.\r\n\r\n\"Do you dare,\" he continued, turning towards her,—\"do you dare to swear\r\nbefore God that jealousy did not inspire you with the wish to ruin me?\"\r\n\r\n\"And you,\" she replied, \"dare you swear that I was deceived in my\r\nsuspicions?\"\r\n\r\n\"You see, gentlemen,\" exclaimed the prisoner triumphantly, \"her jealousy\r\nbreaks forth before your eyes. Whether I am, or am not, guilty of the\r\nsin she attributes to me, is not the question for you to decide. Can you\r\nconscientiously admit the testimony of a woman who, after publicly\r\nacknowledging me, after receiving me in her house, after living two\r\nyears in perfect amity with me, has, in a fit of angry vengeance,\r\nthought she could give the lie to all her words and actions? Ah!\r\nBertrande,\" he continued, \"if it only concerned my life I think I could\r\nforgive a madness of which your love is both the cause and the excuse,\r\nbut you are a mother, think of that! My punishment will recoil on the\r\nhead of my daughter, who is unhappy enough to have been born since our\r\nreunion, and also on our unborn child, which you condemn beforehand to\r\ncurse the union which gave it being. Think of this, Bertrande, you will\r\nhave to answer before God for what you are now doing!\"\r\n\r\nThe unhappy woman fell on her knees, weeping.\r\n\r\n\"I adjure you,\" he continued solemnly, \"you, my wife, Bertrande de\r\nRolls, to swear now, here, on the crucifix, that I am an impostor and a\r\ncheat.\"\r\n\r\nA crucifix was placed before Bertrande; she made a sign as if to push it\r\naway, endeavoured to speak, and feebly exclaimed, \"No,\" then fell to the\r\nground, and was carried out insensible.\r\n\r\nThis scene considerably shook the opinion of the magistrates. They could\r\nnot believe that an impostor, whatever he might be, would have\r\nsufficient daring and presence of mind thus to turn into mockery all\r\nthat was most sacred. They set a new inquiry on foot, which, instead of\r\nproducing enlightenment, only plunged them into still greater obscurity.\r\nOut of thirty witnesses heard, more than three-quarters agreed in\r\nidentifying as Martin Guerre the man who claimed his name. Never was\r\ngreater perplexity caused by more extraordinary appearances. The\r\nremarkable resemblance upset all reasoning: some recognised him as\r\nArnauld du Thill, and others asserted the exact contrary. He could\r\nhardly understand Basque, some said, though born in Biscay, was that\r\nastonishing, seeing he was only three when he left the country? He could\r\nneither wrestle nor fence well, but having no occasion to practise these\r\nexercises he might well have forgotten them. The shoemaker—who made his\r\nshoes afore-time, thought he took another measure, but he might have\r\nmade a mistake before or be mistaken now. The prisoner further defended\r\nhimself by recapitulating the circumstances of his first meeting with\r\nBertrande, on his return, the thousand and one little details he had\r\nmentioned which he only could have known, also the letters in his\r\npossession, all of which could only be explained by the assumption that\r\nhe was the veritable Martin Guerre. Was it likely that he would be\r\nwounded over the left eye and leg as the missing man was supposed to be?\r\nWas it likely that the old servant, that the four sisters, his uncle\r\nPierre, many persons to whom he had related facts known only to himself,\r\nthat all the community in short, would have recognised him? And even the\r\nvery intrigue suspected by Bertrande, which had aroused her jealous\r\nanger, this very intrigue, if it really existed, was it not another\r\nproof of the verity of his claim, since the person concerned, as\r\ninterested and as penetrating as the legitimate wife; had also accepted\r\nhim as her former lover? Surely here was a mass of evidence sufficient\r\nto cast light on the case. Imagine an impostor arriving for the first\r\ntime in a place where all the inhabitants are unknown to him, and\r\nattempting to personate a man who had dwelt there, who would have\r\nconnections of all kinds, who would have played his part in a thousand\r\ndifferent scenes, who would have confided his secrets, his opinions, to\r\nrelations, friends, acquaintances, to all sorts of people; who had also\r\na wife—that is to say, a person under whose eyes nearly his whole life\r\nwould be passed, a person would study him perpetually, with whom he\r\nwould be continually conversing on every sort of subject. Could such an\r\nimpostor sustain his impersonation for a single day, without his memory\r\nplaying him false? From the physical and moral impossibility of playing\r\nsuch a part, was it not reasonable to conclude that the accused, who had\r\nmaintained it for more than two years, was the true Martin Guerre?\r\n\r\nThere seemed, in fact, to be nothing which could account for such an\r\nattempt being successfully made unless recourse was had to an accusation\r\nof sorcery. The idea of handing him over to the ecclesiastical\r\nauthorities was briefly discussed, but proofs were necessary, and the\r\njudges hesitated. It is a principle of justice, which has become a\r\nprecept in law, that in cases of uncertainty the accused has the benefit\r\nof the doubt; but at the period of which we are writing, these truths\r\nwere far from being acknowledged; guilt was presumed rather than\r\ninnocence; and torture, instituted to force confession from those who\r\ncould not otherwise be convicted, is only explicable by supposing the\r\njudges convinced of the actual guilt of the accused; for no one would\r\nhave thought of subjecting a possibly innocent person to this suffering.\r\nHowever, notwithstanding this prejudice, which has been handed down to\r\nus by some organs of the public ministry always disposed to assume the\r\nguilt of a suspected person,—notwithstanding this prejudice, the judges\r\nin this case neither ventured to condemn Martin Guerre themselves as an\r\nimpostor, nor to demand the intervention of the Church. In this conflict\r\nof contrary testimony, which seemed to reveal the truth only to\r\nimmediately obscure it again, in this chaos of arguments and conjectures\r\nwhich showed flashes of light only to extinguish them in greater\r\ndarkness, consideration for the family prevailed. The sincerity of\r\nBertrande, the future of the children, seemed reasons for proceeding\r\nwith extreme caution, and this once admitted, could only yield to\r\nconclusive evidence. Consequently the Parliament adjourned the case,\r\nmatters remaining in ’statu quo’, pending a more exhaustive inquiry.\r\nMeanwhile, the accused, for whom several relations and friends gave\r\nsurety, was allowed to be at liberty at Artigues, though remaining under\r\ncareful surveillance.\r\n\r\nBertrande therefore again saw him an inmate of the house, as if no\r\ndoubts had ever been cast on the legitimacy of their union. What\r\nthoughts passed through her mind during the long ’tete-a-tete’? She had\r\naccused this man of imposture, and now, notwithstanding her secret\r\nconviction, she was obliged to appear as if she had no suspicion, as if\r\nshe had been mistaken, to humiliate herself before the impostor, and ask\r\nforgiveness for the insanity of her conduct; for, having publicly\r\nrenounced her accusation by refusing to swear to it, she had no\r\nalternative left. In order to sustain her part and to save the honour of\r\nher children, she must treat this man as her husband and appear\r\nsubmissive and repentant; she must show him entire confidence, as the\r\nonly means of rehabilitating him and lulling the vigilance of justice.\r\nWhat the widow of Martin Guerre must have suffered in this life of\r\neffort was a secret between God and herself, but she looked at her\r\nlittle daughter, she thought of her fast approaching confinement, and\r\ntook courage.\r\n\r\nOne evening, towards nightfall, she was sitting near him in the most\r\nprivate corner of the garden, with her little child on her knee, whilst\r\nthe adventurer, sunk in gloomy thoughts, absently stroked Sanxi’s fair\r\nhead. Both were silent, for at the bottom of their hearts each knew the\r\nother’s thoughts, and, no longer able to talk familiarly, nor daring to\r\nappear estranged, they spent, when alone together, long hours of silent\r\ndreariness.\r\n\r\nAll at once a loud uproar broke the silence of their retreat; they heard\r\nthe exclamations of many persons, cries of surprise mixed with angry\r\ntones, hasty footsteps, then the garden gate was flung violently open,\r\nand old Marguerite appeared, pale, gasping, almost breathless. Bertrande\r\nhastened towards her in astonishment, followed by her husband, but when\r\nnear enough to speak she could only answer with inarticulate sounds,\r\npointing with terror to the courtyard of the house. They looked in this\r\ndirection, and saw a man standing at the threshold; they approached him.\r\nHe stepped forward, as if to place himself between them. He was tall,\r\ndark; his clothes were torn; he had a wooden leg; his countenance was\r\nstern. He surveyed Bertrande with a gloomy look: she cried aloud, and\r\nfell back insensible; . . . she recognised her real husband!\r\n\r\nArnauld du Thill stood petrified. While Marguerite, distracted herself,\r\nendeavoured to revive her mistress, the neighbours, attracted by the\r\nnoise, invaded the house, and stopped, gazing with stupefaction at this\r\nastonishing resemblance. The two men had the same features, the same\r\nheight, the same bearing, and suggested one being in two persons. They\r\ngazed at each other in terror, and in that superstitious age the idea of\r\nsorcery and of infernal intervention naturally occurred to those\r\npresent. All crossed themselves, expecting every moment to see fire from\r\nheaven strike one or other of the two men, or that the earth would\r\nengulf one of them. Nothing happened, however, except that both were\r\npromptly arrested, in order that the strange mystery might be cleared\r\nup.\r\n\r\nThe wearer of the wooden leg, interrogated by the judges, related that\r\nhe came from Spain, where first the healing of his wound, and then the\r\nwant of money, had detained him hitherto. He had travelled on foot,\r\nalmost a beggar. He gave exactly the same reasons for leaving Artigues\r\nas had been given by the other Martin Guerre, namely, a domestic quarrel\r\ncaused by jealous suspicion, the desire of seeing other countries, and\r\nan adventurous disposition. He had gone back to his birthplace, in\r\nBiscay; thence he entered the service of the Cardinal of Burgos; then\r\nthe cardinal’s brother had taken him to the war, and he had served with\r\nthe Spanish troops; at the battle of St. Quentiny—his leg had been\r\nshattered by an arquebus ball. So far his recital was the counterpart of\r\nthe one already heard by the judges from the other man. Now, they began\r\nto differ. Martin Guerre stated that he had been conveyed to a house by\r\na man whose features he did not distinguish, that he thought he was\r\ndying, and that several hours elapsed of which he could give no account,\r\nbeing probably delirious; that he suffered later intolerable pain, and\r\non coming to himself, found that his leg had been amputated. He remained\r\nlong between life and death, but he was cared for by peasants who\r\nprobably saved his life; his recovery was very slow. He discovered that\r\nin the interval between being struck down in the battle and recovering\r\nhis senses, his papers had disappeared, but it was impossible to suspect\r\nthe people who had nursed him with such generous kindness of theft.\r\nAfter his recovery, being absolutely destitute, he sought to return to\r\nFrance and again see his wife and child: he had endured all sorts of\r\nprivations and fatigues, and at length, exhausted, but rejoicing at\r\nbeing near the end of his troubles, he arrived, suspecting nothing, at\r\nhis own door. Then the terror of the old servant, a few broken words,\r\nmade him guess at some misfortune, and the appearance of his wife and of\r\na man so exactly like himself stupefied him. Matters had now been\r\nexplained, and he only regretted that his wound had not at once ended\r\nhis existence.\r\n\r\nThe whole story bore the impress of truth, but when the other prisoner\r\nwas asked what he had to say he adhered to his first answers,\r\nmaintaining their correctness, and again asserted that he was the real\r\nMartin Guerre, and that the new claimant could only be Arnauld du Thill,\r\nthe clever impostor, who was said to resemble himself so much that the\r\ninhabitants of Sagias had agreed in mistaking him for the said Arnauld.\r\n\r\nThe two Martin Guerres were then confronted without changing the\r\nsituation in the least; the first showing the same assurance, the same\r\nbold and confident bearing; while the second, calling on God and men to\r\nbear witness to his sincerity, deplored his misfortune in the most\r\npathetic terms.\r\n\r\nThe judge’s perplexity was great: the affair became more and more\r\ncomplicated, the question remained as difficult, as uncertain as ever.\r\nAll the appearances and evidences were at variance; probability seemed\r\nto incline towards one, sympathy was more in favour of the other, but\r\nactual proof was still wanting.\r\n\r\nAt length a member of the Parliament, M. de Coras, proposed as a last\r\nchance before resorting to torture, that final means of examination in a\r\nbarbarous age, that Bertrande should be placed between the two rivals,\r\ntrusting, he said, that in such a case a woman’s instinct would divine\r\nthe truth. Consequently the two Martin Guerres were brought before the\r\nParliament, and a few moments after Bertrande was led in, weak, pale,\r\nhardly able to stand, being worn out by suffering and advanced\r\npregnancy. Her appearance excited compassion, and all watched anxiously\r\nto see what she would do. She looked at the two men, who had been placed\r\nat different ends of the hall, and turning from him who was nearest to\r\nher, went and knelt silently before the man with the wooden leg; then,\r\njoining her hands as if praying for mercy, she wept bitterly. So simple\r\nand touching an action roused the sympathy of all present; Arnauld du\r\nThill grew pale, and everyone expected that Martin Guerre, rejoiced at\r\nbeing vindicated by this public acknowledgment, would raise his wife and\r\nembrace her. But he remained cold and stern, and in a contemptuous tone—\r\n\r\n\"Your tears, madame,\" he said; \"they do not move me in the least,\r\nneither can you seek to excuse your credulity by the examples of my\r\nsisters and my uncle. A wife knows her husband more intimately than his\r\nother relations, as you prove by your present action, and if she is\r\ndeceived it is because she consents to the deception. You are the sole\r\ncause of the misfortunes of my house, and to you only shall I ever\r\nimpute them.\"\r\n\r\nThunderstruck by this reproach, the poor woman had no strength to reply,\r\nand was taken home more dead than alive.\r\n\r\nThe dignified language of this injured husband made another point in his\r\nfavour. Much pity was felt for Bertrande, as being the victim of an\r\naudacious deception; but everybody agreed that thus it beseemed the real\r\nMartin Guerre to have spoken. After the ordeal gone through by the wife\r\nhad been also essayed by the sisters and other relatives, who one and\r\nall followed Bertrande’s example and accepted the new-comer, the court,\r\nhaving fully deliberated, passed the following sentence, which we\r\ntranscribe literally:\r\n\r\n\"Having reviewed the trial of Arnauld du Thill or Pansette, calling\r\nhimself Martin Guerre, a prisoner in the Conciergerie, who appeals from\r\nthe decision of the judge of Rieux, etc.\r\n\r\n\"We declare that this court negatives the appeal and defence of the said\r\nArnauld du Thill; and as punishment and amends for the imposture,\r\ndeception, assumption of name and of person, adultery, rape, sacrilege,\r\ntheft, larceny, and other deeds committed by the aforesaid du Thill, and\r\ncausing the above-mentioned trial; this court has condemned and condemns\r\nhim to do penance before the church of Artigue, kneeling, clad in his\r\nshirt only, bareheaded and barefoot, a halter on his neck, and a burning\r\ntorch in his hand, and there he shall ask pardon from God, from the\r\nKing, and from justice, from the said Martin Guerre and Bertrande de\r\nRolls, husband and wife: and this done, the aforesaid du Thill shall be\r\ndelivered into the hands of the executioners of the King’s justice, who\r\nshall lead him through the customary streets and crossroads of the\r\naforesaid place of Artigues, and, the halter on his neck, shall bring\r\nhim before the house of the aforesaid Martin Guerre, where he shall be\r\nhung and strangled upon a gibbet erected for this purpose, after which\r\nhis body shall be burnt: and for various reasons and considerations\r\nthereunto moving the court, it has awarded and awards the goods of the\r\naforesaid Arnauld du Thill, apart from the expenses of justice, to the\r\ndaughter born unto him by the aforesaid Bertrande de Rolls, under\r\npretence of marriage falsely asserted by him, having thereto assumed the\r\nname and person of the aforesaid Martin Guerre, by this means deceiving\r\nthe aforesaid de Rolls; and moreover the court has exempted and exempts\r\nfrom this trial the aforesaid Martin Guerre and Bertrande de Rolls, also\r\nthe said Pierre Guerre, uncle of the aforesaid Martin, and has remitted\r\nand remits the aforesaid Arnauld du Thill to the aforesaid judge of\r\nRieux, in order that the present sentence may be executed according to\r\nits form and tenor. Pronounced judicially this 12th day of September\r\n1560.\"\r\n\r\nThis sentence substituted the gallows for the decapitation decreed by\r\nthe first judge, inasmuch as the latter punishment was reserved for\r\ncriminals of noble birth, while hanging was inflicted on meaner persons.\r\n\r\nWhen once his fate was decided, Arnauld du Thill lost all his audacity.\r\nSent back to Artigues, he was interrogated in prison by the judge of\r\nRieux, and confessed his imposture at great length. He said the idea\r\nfirst occurred to him when, having returned from the camp in Picardy, he\r\nwas addressed as Martin Guerre by several intimate friends of the\r\nlatter. He then inquired as to the sort of life, the habits and\r\nrelations of, this man, and having contrived to be near him, had watched\r\nhim closely during the battle. He saw him fall, carried him away, and\r\nthen, as the reader has already seen, excited his delirium to the utmost\r\nin order to obtain possession of his secrets. Having thus explained his\r\nsuccessful imposture by natural causes, which excluded any idea of magic\r\nor sorcery, he protested his penitence, implored the mercy of God, and\r\nprepared himself for execution as became a Christian.\r\n\r\nThe next day, while the populace, collecting from the whole\r\nneighbourhood, had assembled before the parish church of Artigues in\r\norder to behold the penance of the criminal, who, barefoot, attired in a\r\nshirt, and holding a lighted torch in his hand, knelt at the entrance of\r\nthe church, another scene, no less painful, took place in the house of\r\nMartin Guerre. Exhausted by her suffering, which had caused a premature\r\nconfinement, Bertrande lay on her couch of pain, and besought pardon\r\nfrom him whom she had innocently wronged, entreating him also to pray\r\nfor her soul. Martin Guerre, sitting at her bedside, extended his hand\r\nand blessed her. She took his hand and held it to her lips; she could no\r\nlonger speak. All at once a loud noise was heard outside: the guilty man\r\nhad just been executed in front of the house. When finally attached to\r\nthe gallows, he uttered a terrible cry, which was answered by another\r\nfrom inside the house. The same evening, while the body of the\r\nmalefactor was being consumed by fire, the remains of a mother and child\r\nwere laid to rest in consecrated ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*ALI PACHA*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the nineteenth century was a time of audacious\r\nenterprises and strange vicissitudes of fortune. Whilst Western Europe\r\nin turn submitted and struggled against a sub-lieutenant who made\r\nhimself an emperor, who at his pleasure made kings and destroyed\r\nkingdoms, the ancient eastern part of the Continent; like mummies which\r\npreserve but the semblance of life, was gradually tumbling to pieces,\r\nand getting parcelled out amongst bold adventurers who skirmished over\r\nits ruins. Without mentioning local revolts which produced only\r\nshort-lived struggles and trifling changes, of administration, such as\r\nthat of Djezzar Pacha, who refused to pay tribute because he thought\r\nhimself impregnable in his citadel of Saint-Jean-d’Acre, or that of\r\nPassevend-Oglou Pacha, who planted himself on the walls of Widdin as\r\ndefender of the Janissaries against the institution of the regular\r\nmilitia decreed by Sultan Selim at Stamboul, there were wider spread\r\nrebellions which attacked the constitution of the Turkish Empire and\r\ndiminished its extent; amongst them that of Czerni-Georges, which raised\r\nServia to the position of a free state; of Mahomet Ali, who made his\r\npachalik of Egypt into a kingdom; and finally that of the man whose,\r\nhistory we are about to narrate, Ali Tepeleni, Pacha of Janina, whose\r\nlong resistance to the suzerain power preceded and brought about the\r\nregeneration of Greece.\r\n\r\nAli’s own will counted for nothing in this important movement. He\r\nforesaw it, but without ever seeking to aid it, and was powerless to\r\narrest it. He was not one of those men who place their lives and\r\nservices at the disposal of any cause indiscriminately; and his sole aim\r\nwas to acquire and increase a power of which he was both the guiding\r\ninfluence, and the end and object. His nature contained the seeds of\r\nevery human passion, and he devoted all his long life to their\r\ndevelopment and gratification. This explains his whole temperament; his\r\nactions were merely the natural outcome of his character confronted with\r\ncircumstances. Few men have understood themselves better or been on\r\nbetter terms with the orbit of their existence, and as the personality\r\nof an individual is all the more striking, in proportion as it reflects\r\nthe manners and ideas of the time and country in which he has lived, so\r\nthe figure of Ali Pacha stands out, if not one of the most brilliant, at\r\nleast one of the most singular in contemporary history.\r\n\r\nFrom the middle of the eighteenth century Turkey had been a prey to the\r\npolitical gangrene of which she is vainly trying to cure herself to-day,\r\nand which, before long, will dismember her in the sight of all Europe.\r\nAnarchy and disorder reigned from one end of the empire to the other.\r\nThe Osmanli race, bred on conquest alone, proved good for nothing when\r\nconquest failed. It naturally therefore came to pass when Sobieski, who\r\nsaved Christianity under the walls of Vienna, as before his time Charles\r\nMartel had saved it on the plains of Poitiers, had set bounds to the\r\nwave of Mussulman westward invasion, and definitely fixed a limit which\r\nit should not pass, that the Osmanli warlike instincts recoiled upon\r\nthemselves. The haughty descendants of Ortogrul, who considered\r\nthemselves born to command, seeing victory forsake them, fell back upon\r\ntyranny. Vainly did reason expostulate that oppression could not long be\r\nexercised by hands which had lost their strength, and that peace imposed\r\nnew and different labours on those who no longer triumphed in war; they\r\nwould listen to nothing; and, as fatalistic when condemned to a state of\r\npeace as when they marched forth conquering and to conquer, they cowered\r\ndown in magnificent listlessness, leaving the whole burden of their\r\nsupport on conquered peoples. Like ignorant farmers, who exhaust fertile\r\nfields by forcing crops; they rapidly ruined their vast and rich empire\r\nby exorbitant exactions. Inexorable conquerors and insatiable masters,\r\nwith one hand they flogged their slaves and with the other plundered\r\nthem. Nothing was superior to their insolence, nothing on a level with\r\ntheir greed. They were never glutted, and never relaxed their\r\nextortions. But in proportion as their needs increased on the one hand,\r\nso did their resources diminish on the other. Their oppressed subjects\r\nsoon found that they must escape at any cost from oppressors whom they\r\ncould neither appease nor satisfy. Each population took the steps best\r\nsuited to its position and character; some chose inertia, others\r\nviolence. The inhabitants of the plains, powerless and shelterless, bent\r\nlike reeds before the storm and evaded the shock against which they were\r\nunable to stand. The mountaineers planted themselves like rocks in a\r\ntorrent, and dammed its course with all their might. On both sides arose\r\na determined resistance, different in method, similar in result. In the\r\ncase of the peasants labour came to a stand-still; in that of the hill\r\nfolk open war broke out. The grasping exactions of the tyrant dominant\r\nbody produced nothing from waste lands and armed mountaineers;\r\ndestitution and revolt were equally beyond their power to cope with; and\r\nall that was left for tyranny to govern was a desert enclosed by a wall.\r\n\r\nBut, all the same, the wants of a magnificent sultan, descendant of the\r\nProphet and distributor of crowns, must be supplied; and to do this, the\r\nSublime Porte needed money. Unconsciously imitating the Roman Senate,\r\nthe Turkish Divan put up the empire for sale by public auction. All\r\nemployments were sold to the highest bidder; pachas, beys, cadis,\r\nministers of every rank, and clerks of every class had to buy their\r\nposts from their sovereign and get the money back out of his subjects.\r\nThey spent their money in the capital, and recuperated themselves in the\r\nprovinces. And as there was no other law than their master’s pleasure,\r\nso there, was no other guarantee than his caprice. They had therefore to\r\nset quickly to work; the post might be lost before its cost had been\r\nrecovered. Thus all the science of administration resolved itself into\r\nplundering as much and as quickly as possible. To this end, the delegate\r\nof imperial power delegated in his turn, on similar conditions, other\r\nagents to seize for him and for themselves all they could lay their\r\nhands on; so that the inhabitants of the empire might be divided into\r\nthree classes—those who were striving to seize everything; those who\r\nwere trying to save a little; and those who, having nothing and hoping\r\nfor nothing, took no interest in affairs at all.\r\n\r\nAlbania was one of the most difficult provinces to manage. Its\r\ninhabitants were poor, brave, and, the nature of the country was\r\nmountainous and inaccessible. The pashas had great difficulty in\r\ncollecting tribute, because the people were given to fighting for their\r\nbread. Whether Mahomedans or Christians, the Albanians were above all\r\nsoldiers. Descended on the one side from the unconquerable Scythians, on\r\nthe other from the ancient Macedonians, not long since masters of the\r\nworld; crossed with Norman adventurers brought eastwards by the great\r\nmovement of the Crusades; they felt the blood of warriors flow in their\r\nveins, and that war was their element. Sometimes at feud with one\r\nanother, canton against canton, village against village, often even\r\nhouse against house; sometimes rebelling against the government their\r\nsanjaks; sometimes in league with these against the sultan; they never\r\nrested from combat except in an armed peace. Each tribe had its military\r\norganisation, each family its fortified stronghold, each man his gun on\r\nhis shoulder. When they had nothing better to do, they tilled their\r\nfields, or mowed their neighbours’, carrying off, it should be noted,\r\nthe crop; or pastured their, flocks, watching the opportunity to\r\ntrespass over pasture limits. This was the normal and regular life of\r\nthe population of Epirus, Thesprotia, Thessaly, and Upper Albania. Lower\r\nAlbania, less strong, was also less active and bold; and there, as in\r\nmany other parts of Turkey, the dalesman was often the prey of the\r\nmountaineer. It was in the mountain districts where were preserved the\r\nrecollections of Scander Beg, and where the manners of ancient Laconia\r\nprevailed; the deeds of the brave soldier were sung on the lyre, and the\r\nskilful robber quoted as an example to the children by the father of the\r\nfamily. Village feasts were held on the booty taken from strangers; and\r\nthe favourite dish was always a stolen sheep. Every man was esteemed in\r\nproportion to his skill and courage, and a man’s chances of making a\r\ngood match were greatly enhanced when he acquired the reputation of\r\nbeing an agile mountaineer and a good bandit.\r\n\r\nThe Albanians proudly called this anarchy liberty, and religiously\r\nguarded a state of disorder bequeathed by their ancestors, which always\r\nassured the first place to the most valiant.\r\n\r\nIt was amidst men and manners such as these that Ali Tepeleni was born.\r\nHe boasted that he belonged to the conquering race, and that he\r\ndescended from an ancient Anatolian family which had crossed into\r\nAlbania with the troops of Bajazet Ilderim. But it is made certain by\r\nthe learned researches of M. de Pouqueville that he sprang from a native\r\nstock, and not an Asiatic one, as he pretended. His ancestors were\r\nChristian Skipetars, who became Mussulmans after the Turkish invasion,\r\nand his ancestry certainly cannot be traced farther back than the end of\r\nthe sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nMouktar Tepeleni, his grandfather, perished in the Turkish expedition\r\nagainst Corfu, in 1716. Marshal Schullemburg, who defended the island,\r\nhaving repulsed the enemy with loss, took Mouktar prisoner on Mount San\r\nSalvador, where he was in charge of a signalling party, and with a\r\nbarbarity worthy of his adversaries, hung him without trial. It must be\r\nadmitted that the memory of this murder must have had the effect of\r\nrendering Ali badly disposed towards Christians.\r\n\r\nMouktar left three sons, two of whom, Salik and Mahomet, were born of\r\nthe same mother, a lawful wife, but the mother of the youngest, Veli,\r\nwas a slave. His origin was no legal bar to his succeeding like his\r\nbrothers. The family was one of the richest in the town of Tepelen,\r\nwhose name it bore, it enjoyed an income of six thousand piastres, equal\r\nto twenty thousand francs. This was a large fortune in a poor country,\r\nwhere, all commodities were cheap. But the Tepeleni family, holding the\r\nrank of beys, had to maintain a state like that of the great financiers\r\nof feudal Europe. They had to keep a large stud of horses, with a great\r\nretinue of servants and men-at-arms, and consequently to incur heavy\r\nexpenses; thus they constantly found their revenue inadequate. The most\r\nnatural means of raising it which occurred to them was to diminish the\r\nnumber of those who shared it; therefore the two elder brothers, sons of\r\nthe wife, combined against Veli, the son of the slave, and drove him out\r\nof the house. The latter, forced to leave home, bore his fate like a\r\nbrave man, and determined to levy exactions on others to compensate him\r\nfor the losses incurred through his brothers. He became a freebooter,\r\npatrolling highroads and lanes, with his gun on his shoulder and his\r\nyataghan in his belt, attacking, holding for ransom, or plundering all\r\nwhom he encountered.\r\n\r\nAfter some years of this profitable business, he found himself a wealthy\r\nman and chief of a warlike band. Judging that the moment for vengeance\r\nhad arrived, he marched for Tepelen, which he reached unsuspected,\r\ncrossed the river Vojutza, the ancient Aous, penetrated the streets\r\nunresisted, and presented himself before the paternal house, in which\r\nhis brothers, forewarned, had barricaded themselves. He at once besieged\r\nthem, soon forced the gates, and pursued them to a tent, in which they\r\ntook a final refuge. He surrounded this tent, waited till they were\r\ninside it, and then set fire to the four corners. \"See,\" said he to\r\nthose around him, \"they cannot accuse me of vindictive reprisals; my\r\nbrothers drove me out of doors, and I retaliate by keeping them at home\r\nfor ever.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few moments he was his father’s sole heir and master of Tepelen.\r\nArrived at the summit of his ambition, he gave up free-booting, and\r\nestablished himself in the town, of which he became chief ago. He had\r\nalready a son by a slave, who soon presented him with another son, and\r\nafterwards with a daughter, so that he had no reason to fear dying\r\nwithout an heir. But finding himself rich enough to maintain more wives\r\nand bring up many children, he desired to increase his credit by allying\r\nhimself to some great family of the country. He therefore solicited and\r\nobtained the hand of Kamco, daughter of a bey of Conitza. This marriage\r\nattached him by the ties of relationship to the principal families of\r\nthe province, among others to Kourd Pacha, Vizier of Serat, who was\r\ndescended from the illustrious race of Scander Beg. After a few years,\r\nVeli had by his new wife a son named Ali, the subject of this history,\r\nand a daughter named Chainitza.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his intentions to reform, Veli could not entirely give up\r\nhis old habits. Although his fortune placed him altogether above small\r\ngains and losses, he continued to amuse himself by raiding from time to\r\ntime sheep, goats, and other perquisites, probably to keep his hand in.\r\nThis innocent exercise of his taste was not to the fancy of his\r\nneighbours, and brawls and fights recommenced in fine style. Fortune did\r\nnot always favour him, and the old mountaineer lost in the town part of\r\nwhat he had made on the hills. Vexations soured his temper and injured\r\nhis health. Notwithstanding the injunctions of Mahomet, he sought\r\nconsolation in wine, which soon closed his career. He died in 1754.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nAli thus at thirteen years of age was free to indulge in the impetuosity\r\nof his character. From his early youth he had manifested a mettle and\r\nactivity rare in young Turks, haughty by nature and self-restrained by\r\neducation. Scarcely out of the nursery, he spent his time in climbing\r\nmountains, wandering through forests, scaling precipices, rolling in\r\nsnow, inhaling the wind, defying the tempests, breathing out his nervous\r\nenergy through every pore. Possibly he learnt in the midst of every kind\r\nof danger to brave everything and subdue everything; possibly in\r\nsympathy with the majesty of nature, he felt aroused in him a need of\r\npersonal grandeur which nothing could satiate. In vain his father sought\r\nto calm his savage temper; and restrain his vagabond spirit; nothing was\r\nof, any use. As obstinate as intractable, he set at defiance all efforts\r\nand all precautions. If they shut him up, he broke the door or jumped\r\nout of the window; if they threatened him, he pretended to comply,\r\nconquered by fear, and promised everything that was required, but only\r\nto break his word the first opportunity. He had a tutor specially\r\nattached to his person and charged to supervise all his actions. He\r\nconstantly deluded him by fresh tricks, and when he thought himself free\r\nfrom the consequences, he maltreated him with gross violence. It was\r\nonly in his youth, after his father’s death, that he became more\r\nmanageable; he even consented to learn to read, to please his mother,\r\nwhose idol he was, and to whom in return he gave all his affection.\r\n\r\nIf Kamco had so strong a liking for Ali, it was because she found in\r\nhim, not only her blood, but also her character. During the lifetime of\r\nher husband, whom she feared, she seemed only an ordinary woman; but as\r\nsoon as his eyes were closed, she gave free scope to the violent\r\npassions which agitated her bosom. Ambitious, bold, vindictive; she\r\nassiduously cultivated the germs of ambition, hardihood, and vengeance\r\nwhich already strongly showed themselves in the young Ali. \"My son,\" she\r\nwas never tired of telling him, \"he who cannot defend his patrimony\r\nrichly deserves to lose it. Remember that the property of others is only\r\ntheirs so long as they are strong enough to keep it, and that when you\r\nfind yourself strong enough to take it from them, it is yours. Success\r\njustifies everything, and everything is permissible to him who has the\r\npower to do it.\"\r\n\r\nAli, when he reached the zenith of his greatness, used to declare that\r\nhis success was entirely his mother’s work. \"I owe everything to my\r\nmother,\" he said one day to the French Consul; \"for my father, when he\r\ndied, left me nothing but a den of wild beasts and a few fields. My\r\nimagination, inflamed by the counsels of her who has given me life twice\r\nover, since she has made me both a man and a vizier, revealed to me the\r\nsecret of my destiny. Thenceforward I saw nothing in Tepelen but the\r\nnatal air from which I was to spring on the prey which I devoured\r\nmentally. I dreamt of nothing else but power, treasures, palaces, in\r\nshort what time has realised and still promises; for the point I have\r\nnow reached is not the limit of my hopes.\"\r\n\r\nKamco did not confine herself to words; she employed every means to\r\nincrease the fortune of her beloved son and to make him a power. Her\r\nfirst care was to poison the children of Veli’s favourite slave, who had\r\ndied before him. Then, at ease about the interior of her family, she\r\ndirected her attention to the exterior. Renouncing all the habit of her\r\nsex, she abandoned the veil and the distaff, and took up arms, under\r\npretext of maintaining the rights of her children. She collected round\r\nher her husband’s old partisans, whom she attached to her, service, some\r\nby presents, others by various favours, and she gradually enlisted all\r\nthe lawless and adventurous men in Toscaria. With their aid, she made\r\nherself all powerful in Tepelen, and inflicted the most rigorous\r\npersecutions on such as remained hostile to her.\r\n\r\nBut the inhabitants of the two adjacent villages of Kormovo and Kardiki,\r\nfearing lest this terrible woman, aided by her son, now grown into a\r\nman, should strike a blow against their independence; made a secret\r\nalliance against her, with the object of putting her out of the way the\r\nfirst convenient opportunity. Learning one day that Ali had started on a\r\ndistant expedition with his best soldiers; they surprised Tepelen under\r\ncover of night, and carried off Kamco and her daughter Chainitza\r\ncaptives to Kardiki. It was proposed to put them to death; and\r\nsufficient evidence to justify their execution was not wanting; but\r\ntheir beauty saved their lives; their captors preferred to revenge\r\nthemselves by licentiousness rather than by murder. Shut up all day in\r\nprison, they only emerged at night to pass into the arms of the men who\r\nhad won them by lot the previous morning. This state of things lasted\r\nfor a month, at the end of which a Greek of Argyro-Castron, named G.\r\nMalicovo, moved by compassion for their horrible fate, ransomed them for\r\ntwenty thousand piastres, and took them back to Tepelen.\r\n\r\nAli had just returned. He was accosted by his mother and sister, pale\r\nwith fatigue, shame, and rage. They told him what had taken place, with\r\ncries and tears, and Kamco added, fixing her distracted eyes upon him,\r\n\"My son! my son! my soul will enjoy no peace till Kormovo and Kardikil\r\ndestroyed by thy scimitar, will no longer exist to bear witness to my\r\ndishonour.\"\r\n\r\nAli, in whom this sight and this story had aroused, sanguinary passions,\r\npromised a vengeance proportioned to the outrage, and worked with all\r\nhis might to place himself in a position to keep his word. A worthy son\r\nof his father, he had commenced life in the fashion of the heroes of\r\nancient Greece, stealing sheep and goats, and from the age of fourteen\r\nyears he had acquired an equal reputation to that earned by the son of\r\nJupiter and Maia. When he grew to manhood, he extended his operations.\r\nAt the time of which we are speaking, he had long practised open\r\npillage. His plundering expeditions added to his mother’s savings, who\r\nsince her return from Kardiki had altogether withdrawn from public life,\r\nand devoted herself to household duties, enabled him to collect a\r\nconsiderable force for an expedition against Kormovo, one of the two\r\ntowns he had sworn to destroy. He marched against it at the head of his\r\nbanditti, but found himself vigorously opposed, lost part of his force,\r\nand was obliged to save himself and the rest by flight. He did not stop\r\ntill he reached Tepelen, where he had a warm reception from Kamco, whose\r\nthirst for vengeance had been disappointed by his defeat. \"Go!\" said\r\nshe, \"go, coward! go spin with the women in the harem! The distaff is a\r\nbetter weapon for you than the scimitar!\" The young man answered not a\r\nword, but, deeply wounded by these reproaches, retired to hide his\r\nhumiliation in the bosom of his old friend the mountain. The popular\r\nlegend, always thirsting for the marvellous in the adventures of heroes,\r\nhas it that he found in the ruins of a church a treasure which enabled\r\nhim to reconstitute his party. But he himself has contradicted this\r\nstory, stating that it was by the ordinary methods of rapine and plunder\r\nthat he replenished his finances. He selected from his old band of\r\nbrigands thirty palikars, and entered, as their bouloubachi, or leader\r\nof the group, into the service of the Pacha of Negropont. But he soon\r\ntired of the methodical life he was obliged to lead, and passed into\r\nThessaly, where, following the example of his father Veli, he employed\r\nhis time in brigandage on the highways. Thence he raided the Pindus\r\nchain of mountains, plundered a great number of villages, and returned\r\nto Tepelen, richer and consequently more esteemed than ever.\r\n\r\nHe employed his fortune and influence in collecting a formidable\r\nguerilla force, and resumed his plundering operations. Kurd Pacha soon\r\nfound himself compelled, by the universal outcry of the province, to\r\ntake active measures against this young brigand. He sent against him a\r\ndivision of troops, which defeated him and brought him prisoner with his\r\nmen to Berat, the capital of Central Albania and residence of the\r\ngovernor. The country flattered itself that at length it was freed from\r\nits scourge. The whole body of bandits was condemned to death; but Ali\r\nwas not the man to surrender his life so easily. Whilst they were\r\nhanging his comrades, he threw himself at the feet of the pacha and\r\nbegged for mercy in the name of his parents, excusing himself on account\r\nof his youth, and promising a lasting reform. The pacha, seeing at his\r\nfeet a comely youth, with fair hair and blue eyes, a persuasive voice,\r\nand eloquent tongue, and in whose veins flowed the same blood as his\r\nown, was moved with pity and pardoned him. Ali got off with a mild\r\ncaptivity in the palace of his powerful relative, who heaped benefits\r\nupon him, and did all he could to lead him into the paths of probity. He\r\nappeared amenable to these good influences, and bitterly to repent his\r\npast errors. After some years, believing in his reformation, and moved\r\nby the prayers of Kamco, who incessantly implored the restitution of her\r\ndear son, the generous pacha restored him his liberty, only giving him\r\nto under stand that he had no more mercy to expect if he again disturbed\r\nthe public peace. Ali taking the threat seriously; did not run the risk\r\nof braving it, and, on the contrary, did all he could to conciliate the\r\nman whose anger he dared not kindle. Not only did he keep the promise he\r\nhad made to live quietly, but by his good conduct he caused his, former\r\nescapades to be forgotten, putting under obligation all his neighbours,\r\nand attaching to himself, through the services he rendered them, a great\r\nnumber of friendly disposed persons. In this manner he soon assumed a\r\ndistinguished and honourable rank among the beys of the country, and\r\nbeing of marriageable age, he sought and formed an alliance with the\r\ndaughter of Capelan Tigre, Pacha of Delvino, who resided at\r\nArgyro-Castron. This union, happy on both sides, gave him, with one of\r\nthe most accomplished women in Epirus, a high position and great\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if this marriage were destined to wean Ali forever from his\r\nformer turbulent habits and wild adventures. But the family into which\r\nhe had married afforded violent contrasts and equal elements of good and\r\nmischief. If Emineh, his wife, was a model of virtue, his father-in-law,\r\nCapelan, was a composition of every vice—selfish, ambitious, turbulent,\r\nfierce. Confident in his courage, and further emboldened by his\r\nremoteness from the capital, the Pacha of Delvino gloried in setting law\r\nand authority at defiance.\r\n\r\nAli’s disposition was too much like that of his father-in-law to prevent\r\nhim from taking his measure very quickly. He soon got on good terms with\r\nhim, and entered into his schemes, waiting for an opportunity to\r\ndenounce him and become his successor. For this opportunity he had not\r\nlong to wait.\r\n\r\nCapelan’s object in giving his daughter to Tepeleni was to enlist him\r\namong the beys of the province to gain independence, the ruling passion\r\nof viziers. The cunning young man pretended to enter into the views of\r\nhis father-in-law, and did all he could to urge him into the path of\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\nAn adventurer named Stephano Piccolo, an emissary of Russia, had just\r\nraised in Albania the standard of the Cross and called to arms all the\r\nChristians of the Acroceraunian Mountains. The Divan sent orders to all\r\nthe pachas of Northern Turkey in Europe to instantly march against the\r\ninsurgents and quell the rising in blood.\r\n\r\nInstead of obeying the orders of the Divan and joining Kurd Pacha, who\r\nhad summoned him, Capelan, at the instigation of his son-in-law, did all\r\nhe could to embarrass the movement of the imperial troops, and without\r\nopenly making common cause with the insurgents, he rendered them\r\nsubstantial aid in their resistance. They were, notwithstanding,\r\nconquered and dispersed; and their chief, Stephano Piccolo, had to take\r\nrefuge in the unexplored caves of Montenegro.\r\n\r\nWhen the struggle was over, Capelan, as Ali had foreseen, was summoned\r\nto give an account of his conduct before the roumeli-valicy, supreme\r\njudge over Turkey in Europe. He was not only accused of the gravest\r\noffences, but proofs of them were forwarded to the Divan by the very man\r\nwho had instigated them. There could be no doubt as to the result of the\r\ninquiry; therefore, the pacha, who had no suspicions of his son-in-law’s\r\nduplicity, determined not to leave his pachalik. That was not in\r\naccordance with the plans of Ali, who wished to succeed to both the\r\ngovernment and the wealth of his father-in-law. He accordingly made the\r\nmost plausible remonstrances against the inefficacy and danger of such a\r\nresistance. To refuse to plead was tantamount to a confession of guilt,\r\nand was certain to bring on his head a storm against which he was\r\npowerless to cope, whilst if he obeyed the orders of the roumeli-valicy\r\nhe would find it easy to excuse himself. To give more effect to his\r\nperfidious advice, Ali further employed the innocent Emineh, who was\r\neasily alarmed on her father’s account. Overcome by the reasoning of his\r\nson-in-law and the tears of his daughter, the unfortunate pacha\r\nconsented to go to Monastir, where he had been summoned to appear, and\r\nwhere he was immediately arrested and beheaded.\r\n\r\nAli’s schemes had succeeded, but both his ambition and his cupidity were\r\nfrustrated. Ali, Bey of Argyro-Castron, who had throughout shown himself\r\ndevoted to the sultan, was nominated Pacha of Delvino in place of\r\nCapelan. He sequestered all the property of his predecessor, as\r\nconfiscated to the sultan, and thus deprived Ali Tepeleni of all the\r\nfruits of his crime.\r\n\r\nThis disappointment kindled the wrath of the ambitious Ali. He swore\r\nvengeance for the spoliation of which he considered himself the victim.\r\nBut the moment was not favourable for putting his projects in train. The\r\nmurder of Capelan, which its perpetrator intended for a mere crime,\r\nproved a huge blunder. The numerous enemies of Tepeleni, silent under\r\nthe administration of the late pacha, whose resentment they had cause to\r\nfear, soon made common cause under the new one, for whose support they\r\nhad hopes. Ali saw the danger, sought and found the means to obviate it.\r\nHe succeeded in making a match between Ali of Argyro-Castron, who was\r\nunmarried, and Chainitza, his own sister. This alliance secured to him\r\nthe government of Tigre, which he held under Capelan. But that was not\r\nsufficient. He must put himself in a state of security against the\r\ndangers he had lately, experienced, and establish himself on a firm\r\nfooting’ against possible accidents. He soon formed a plan, which he\r\nhimself described to the French Consul in the following words:—\r\n\r\n\"Years were elapsing,\" said he, \"and brought no important change in my\r\nposition. I was an important partisan, it is true, and strongly\r\nsupported, but I held no title or Government employment of my own. I\r\nrecognised the necessity of establishing myself firmly in my birthplace.\r\nI had devoted friends, and formidable foes, bent on my destruction, whom\r\nI must put out of the way, for my own safety. I set about a plan for\r\ndestroying them at one blow, and ended by devising one with which I\r\nought to have commenced my career. Had I done so, I should have saved\r\nmuch time and pains.\r\n\r\n\"I was in the habit of going every day, after hunting, for a siesta in a\r\nneighbouring wood. A confidential servant of mine suggested to my\r\nenemies the idea of surprising me and assassinating one there. I myself\r\nsupplied the plan of the conspiracy, which was adopted. On the day\r\nagreed upon, I preceded my adversaries to the place where I was\r\naccustomed to repose, and caused a goat to be pinioned and muzzled, and\r\nfastened under the tree, covered with my cape; I then returned home by a\r\nroundabout path. Soon after I had left, the conspirators arrived, and\r\nfired a volley at the goat.\r\n\r\n\"They ran up to make certain of my death, but were interrupted by a\r\npiquet of my men, who unexpectedly emerged from a copse where I had\r\nposted them, and they were obliged to return to Tepelen, which they\r\nentered, riotous with joy, crying ’Ali Bey is dead, now we are free!’\r\nThis news reached my harem, and I heard the cries of my mother and my\r\nwife mingled with the shouts of my enemies. I allowed the commotion to\r\nrun its course and reach its height, so as to indicate which were my\r\nfriends and which my foes. But when the former were at the depth of\r\ntheir distress and the latter at the height of their joy, and, exulting\r\nin their supposed victory, had drowned their prudence and their courage\r\nin floods of wine, then, strong in the justice of my cause, I appeared\r\nupon the scene. Now was the time for my friends to triumph and for my\r\nfoes to tremble. I set to work at the head of my partisans, and before\r\nsunrise had exterminated the last of my enemies. I distributed their\r\nlands, their houses, and their goods amongst my followers, and from that\r\nmoment I could call the town of Tepelen my own.\"\r\n\r\nA less ambitious man might perhaps have remained satisfied with such a\r\nresult. But Ali did not look upon the suzerainty of a canton as a final\r\nobject, but only as a means to an end; and he had not made himself\r\nmaster of Tepelen to limit himself to a petty state, but to employ it as\r\na base of operations.\r\n\r\nHe had allied himself to Ali of Argyro-Castron to get rid of his\r\nenemies; once free from them, he began to plot against his supplanter.\r\nHe forgot neither his vindictive projects nor his ambitious schemes. As\r\nprudent in execution as bold in design, he took good care not to openly\r\nattack a man stronger than himself, and gained by stratagem what he\r\ncould not obtain by violence. The honest and straightforward character\r\nof his brother-in-law afforded an easy success to his perfidy. He began\r\nby endeavouring to suborn his sister Chainitza, and several times\r\nproposed to her to poison her husband; but she, who dearly loved the\r\npacha, who was a kind husband and to whom she had borne two children,\r\nrepulsed his suggestions with horror, and threatened, if he persisted,\r\nto denounce him. Ali, fearing the consequences if she carried out her\r\nthreat, begged forgiveness for his wicked plans, pretended deep\r\nrepentance, and spoke of his brother-in-law in terms of the warmest\r\naffection. His acting was so consummate that even Chainitza, who well\r\nknew her brother’s subtle character, was deceived by it. When he saw\r\nthat she was his dupe, knowing that he had nothing more either to fear\r\nor to hope for from that side, he directed his attention to another.\r\n\r\nThe pacha had a brother named Soliman, whose character nearly resembled\r\nthat of Tepeleni. The latter, after having for some time quietly studied\r\nhim, thought he discerned in him the man he wanted; he tempted him to\r\nkill the pacha, offering him, as the price of this crime, his whole\r\ninheritance and the hand of Chainitza, only reserving for himself the\r\nlong coveted sanjak. Soliman accepted the proposals, and the fratricidal\r\nbargain was concluded. The two conspirators, sole masters of the secret,\r\nthe horrible nature of which guaranteed their mutual fidelity, and\r\nhaving free access to the person of their victim; could not fail in\r\ntheir object.\r\n\r\nOne day, when they were both received by the pacha in private audience,\r\nSoliman, taking advantage of a moment when he was unobserved, drew a\r\npistol from his belt and blew out his brother’s brains. Chainitza ran at\r\nthe sound, and saw her husband lying dead between her brother and her\r\nbrother-in-law. Her cries for help were stopped by threats of death if\r\nshe moved or uttered a sound. As she lay, fainting with grief and\r\nterror, Ali made, a sign to Soliman, who covered her with his cloak, and\r\ndeclared her his wife. Ali pronounced the marriage concluded, and\r\nretired for it to be consummated. Thus was celebrated this frightful\r\nwedding, in the scene of an awful crime; beside the corpse of a man who\r\na moment before had been the husband of the bride and the brother of the\r\nbridegroom.\r\n\r\nThe assassins published the death of the pacha, attributing it, as is\r\nusual in Turkey, to a fit of cerebral apoplexy. But the truth soon\r\nleaked out from the lying shrouds in which it had been wrapped. Reports\r\neven exceeded the truth, and public opinion implicated Chainitza in a\r\ncrime of which she had been but the witness. Appearances certainly\r\njustified these suspicions. The young wife had soon consoled herself in\r\nthe arms of her second husband for the loss of the first, and her son by\r\nhim presently died suddenly, thus leaving Soliman in lawful and peaceful\r\npossession of all his brother’s wealth. As for the little girl, as she\r\nhad no rights and could hurt no one, her life was spared; and she was\r\neventually married to a bey of Cleisoura, destined in the sequel to cut\r\na tragic figure in the history of the Tepeleni family.\r\n\r\nBut Ali was once more deprived of the fruit of his bloody schemes.\r\nNotwithstanding all his intrigues, the sanjak of Delvino was conferred,\r\nnot upon him, but upon a bey of one of the first families of Zapouria.\r\nBut, far from being discouraged, he recommenced with new boldness and\r\nstill greater confidence the work of his elevation, so often begun and\r\nso often interrupted. He took advantage of his increasing influence to\r\ningratiate himself with the new pasha, and was so successful in\r\ninsinuating himself into his confidence, that he was received into the\r\npalace and treated like the pacha’s son. There he acquired complete\r\nknowledge of the details of the pachalik and the affairs of the pacha,\r\npreparing himself to govern the one when he had got rid of the other.\r\n\r\nThe sanjak of Delvino was bounded from Venetian territory by the\r\ndistrict of Buthrotum. Selim, a better neighbour and an abler politician\r\nthan his predecessors, sought to renew and preserve friendly commercial\r\nrelations with the purveyors of the Magnificent Republic. This wise\r\nconduct, equally advantageous for both the bordering provinces, instead\r\nof gaining for the pacha the praise and favours which he deserved,\r\nrendered him suspected at a court whose sole political idea was hatred\r\nof the name of Christian, and whose sole means of government was terror.\r\nAli immediately perceived the pacha’s error, and the advantage which he\r\nhimself could derive from it. Selim, as one of his commercial\r\ntransactions with the Venetians, had sold them, for a number of years,\r\nthe right of felling timber in a forest near Lake Reloda. Ali\r\nimmediately took advantage of this to denounce the pasha as guilty of\r\nhaving alienated the territory of the Sublime Porte, and of a desire to\r\ndeliver to the infidels all the province of Delvino. Masking his\r\nambitious designs under the veil of religion and patriotism, he\r\nlamented, in his denunciatory report, the necessity under which he found\r\nhimself, as a loyal subject and faithful Mussulman, of accusing a man\r\nwho had been his benefactor, and thus at the same time gained the\r\nbenefit of crime and the credit of virtue.\r\n\r\nUnder the gloomy despotism of the Turks, a man in any position of\r\nresponsibility is condemned almost as soon as accused; and if he is not\r\nstrong enough to inspire terror, his ruin is certain. Ali received at\r\nTepelen, where he had retired to more conveniently weave his perfidious\r\nplots, an order to get rid of the pacha. At the receipt of the firman of\r\nexecution he leaped with joy, and flew to Delvino to seize the prey\r\nwhich was abandoned to him.\r\n\r\nThe noble Selim, little suspecting that his protege had become his\r\naccuser and was preparing to become his executioner, received him with\r\nmore tenderness than ever, and lodged him, as heretofore, in his palace.\r\nUnder the shadow of this hospitable roof, Ali skilfully prepared the\r\nconsummation of the crime which was for ever to draw him out of\r\nobscurity. He went every morning to pay his court to the pacha, whose\r\nconfidence he doubted; then, one day, feigning illness, he sent excuses\r\nfor inability to pay his respects to a man whom he was accustomed to\r\nregard as his father, and begged him to come for a moment into his\r\napartment. The invitation being accepted, he concealed assassins in one\r\nof the cupboards without shelves, so common in the East, which contain\r\nby day the mattresses spread by night on the floor for the slaves to\r\nsleep upon. At the hour fixed, the old man arrived. Ali rose from his\r\nsofa with a depressed air, met him, kissed the hem of his robe, and,\r\nafter seating him in his place, himself offered him a pipe-and coffee,\r\nwhich were accepted. But instead of putting the cup in the hand\r\nstretched to receive it, he let it fall on the floor, where it broke\r\ninto a thousand pieces. This was the signal. The assassins sprang from\r\ntheir retreat and darted upon Selim, who fell, exclaiming, like Caesar,\r\n\"And it is thou, my son, who takest my life!\"\r\n\r\nAt the sound of the tumult which followed the assassination, Selim’s\r\nbodyguard, running up, found Ali erect, covered with blood, surrounded\r\nby assassins, holding in his hand the firman displayed, and crying with\r\na menacing voice, \"I have killed the traitor Selim by the order of our\r\nglorious sultan; here is his imperial command.\" At these words, and the\r\nsight of the fatal diploma, all prostrated themselves terror-stricken.\r\nAli, after ordering the decapitation of Selim, whose head he seized as a\r\ntrophy, ordered the cadi, the beys, and the Greek archons to meet at the\r\npalace, to prepare the official account of the execution of the\r\nsentence. They assembled, trembling; the sacred hymn of the Fatahat was\r\nsung, and the murder declared legal, in the name of the merciful and\r\ncompassionate God, Lord of the world.\r\n\r\nWhen they had sealed up the effects of the victim, the murderer left the\r\npalace, taking with him, as a hostage, Mustapha, son of Selim, destined\r\nto be even more unfortunate than his father.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards, the Divan awarded to Ali Tepeleni, as a reward\r\nfor his zeal for the State and religion, the sanjak of Thessaly, with\r\nthe title of Dervendgi-pacha, or Provost Marshal of the roads. This\r\nlatter dignity was conferred on the condition of his levying a body of\r\nfour thousand men to clear the valley of the Peneus of a multitude of\r\nChristian chiefs who exercised more power than the officers of the Grand\r\nSeigneur. The new pacha took advantage of this to enlist a numerous body\r\nof Albanians ready for any enterprise, and completely devoted to him.\r\nWith two important commands, and with this strong force at his back, he\r\nrepaired to Trikala, the seat of his government, where he speedily\r\nacquired great influence.\r\n\r\nHis first act of authority was to exterminate the bands of Armatolis, or\r\nChristian militia, which infested the plain. He laid violent hands on\r\nall whom he caught, and drove the rest back into their mountains,\r\nsplitting them up into small bands whom he could deal with at his\r\npleasure. At the same time he sent a few heads to Constantinople, to\r\namuse the sultan and the mob, and some money to the ministers to gain\r\ntheir support. \"For,\" said he, \"water sleeps, but envy never does.\"\r\nThese steps were prudent, and whilst his credit increased at court,\r\norder was reestablished from the defiles of the Perrebia of Pindus to\r\nthe vale of Tempe and to the pass of Thermopylae.\r\n\r\nThese exploits of the provost-marshal, amplified by Oriental\r\nexaggeration, justified the ideas which were entertained of the capacity\r\nof Ali Pacha. Impatient of celebrity, he took good care himself to\r\nspread his fame, relating his prowess to all comers, making presents to\r\nthe sultan’s officers who came into his government, and showing\r\ntravellers his palace courtyard festooned with decapitated heads. But\r\nwhat chiefly tended to consolidate his power was the treasure which he\r\nceaselessly amassed by every means. He never struck for the mere\r\npleasure of striking, and the numerous victims of his proscriptions only\r\nperished to enrich him. His death sentences always fell on beys and\r\nwealthy persons whom he wished to plunder. In his eyes the axe was but\r\nan instrument of fortune, and the executioner a tax-gatherer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving governed Thessaly in this manner during several years, Ali found\r\nhimself in a position to acquire the province of Janina, the possession\r\nof which, by making him master of Epirus, would enable him to crush all\r\nhis enemies and to reign supreme over the three divisions of Albania.\r\n\r\nBut before he could succeed in this, it was necessary to dispose of the\r\npacha already in possession. Fortunately for Ali, the latter was a weak\r\nand indolent man, quite incapable of struggling against so formidable a\r\nrival; and his enemy speedily conceived and put into execution a plan\r\nintended to bring about the fulfilment of his desires. He came to terms\r\nwith the same Armatolians whom he had formerly treated so harshly, and\r\nlet them loose, provided with arms and ammunition, on the country which\r\nhe wished to obtain. Soon the whole region echoed with stories of\r\ndevastation and pillage. The pacha, unable to repel the incursions of\r\nthese mountaineers, employed the few troops he had in oppressing the\r\ninhabitants of the plains, who, groaning under both extortion and\r\nrapine, vainly filled the air with their despairing cries. Ali hoped\r\nthat the Divan, which usually judged only after the event, seeing that\r\nEpirus lay desolate, while Thessaly flourished under his own\r\nadministration, would, before long, entrust himself with the government\r\nof both provinces, when a family incident occurred, which for a time\r\ndiverted the course of his political manoeuvres.\r\n\r\nFor a long time his mother Kamco had suffered from an internal cancer,\r\nthe result of a life of depravity. Feeling that her end drew near, she\r\ndespatched messenger after messenger, summoning her son to her bedside.\r\nHe started, but arrived too late, and found only his sister Chainitza\r\nmourning over the body of their mother, who had expired in her arms an\r\nhour previously. Breathing unutterable rage and pronouncing horrible\r\nimprecations against Heaven, Kamco had commanded her children, under\r\npain of her dying curse, to carry out her last wishes faithfully. After\r\nhaving long given way to their grief, Ali and Chainitza read together\r\nthe document which contained these commands. It ordained some special\r\nassassinations, mentioned sundry villages which, some day; were to be\r\ngiven to the flames, but ordered them most especially, as soon as\r\npossible, to exterminate the inhabitants of Kormovo and Kardiki, from\r\nwhom she had endured the last horrors of slavery.\r\n\r\nThen, after advising her children to remain united, to enrich their\r\nsoldiers, and to count as nothing people who were useless to them, Kamco\r\nended by commanding them to send in her name a pilgrim to Mecca, who\r\nshould deposit an offering on the tomb of the Prophet for the repose of\r\nher soul. Having perused these last injunctions, Ali and Chainitza\r\njoined hands, and over the inanimate remains of their departed mother\r\nswore to accomplish her dying behests.\r\n\r\nThe pilgrimage came first under consideration. Now a pilgrim can only be\r\nsent as proxy to Mecca, or offerings be made at the tomb of Medina, at\r\nthe expense of legitimately acquired property duly sold for the purpose.\r\nThe brother and sister made a careful examination of the family estates,\r\nand after long hunting, thought they had found the correct thing in a\r\nsmall property of about fifteen hundred francs income, inherited from\r\ntheir great-grandfather, founder of the Tepel-Enian dynasty. But further\r\ninvestigations disclosed that even this last resource had been forcibly\r\ntaken from a Christian, and the idea of a pious pilgrimage and a sacred\r\noffering had to be given up. They then agreed to atone for the\r\nimpossibility of expiation by the grandeur of their vengeance, and swore\r\nto pursue without ceasing and to destroy without mercy all enemies of\r\ntheir family.\r\n\r\nThe best mode of carrying out this terrible and self-given pledge was\r\nthat Ali should resume his plans of aggrandizement exactly where he had\r\nleft them. He succeeded in acquiring the pachalik of Janina, which was\r\ngranted him by the Porte under the title of \"arpalik,\" or conquest. It\r\nwas an old custom, natural to the warlike habits of the Turks, to bestow\r\nthe Government provinces or towns affecting to despise the authority of\r\nthe Grand Seigneur on whomsoever succeeded in controlling them, and\r\nJanina occupied this position. It was principally inhabited by\r\nAlbanians, who had an enthusiastic admiration for anarchy, dignified by\r\nthem with the name of \"Liberty,\" and who thought themselves independent\r\nin proportion to the disturbance they succeeded in making. Each lived\r\nretired as if in a mountain castle, and only went out in order to\r\nparticipate in the quarrels of his faction in the forum. As for the\r\npachas, they were relegated to the old castle on the lake, and there was\r\nno difficulty in obtaining their recall.\r\n\r\nConsequently there was a general outcry at the news of Ali Pacha’s\r\nnomination, and it was unanimously agreed that a man whose character and\r\npower were alike dreaded must not be admitted within the walls of\r\nJanina. Ali, not choosing to risk his forces in an open battle with a\r\nwarlike population, and preferring a slower and safer way to a short and\r\ndangerous one, began by pillaging the villages and farms belonging to\r\nhis most powerful opponents. His tactics succeeded, and the very persons\r\nwho had been foremost in vowing hatred to the son of Kamco and who had\r\nsworn most loudly that they would die rather than submit to the tyrant,\r\nseeing their property daily ravaged, and impending ruin if hostilities\r\ncontinued, applied themselves to procure peace. Messengers were sent\r\nsecretly to Ali, offering to admit him into Janina if he would undertake\r\nto respect the lives and property of his new allies. Ali promised\r\nwhatever they asked, and entered the town by night. His first proceeding\r\nwas to appear before the cadi, whom he compelled to register and\r\nproclaim his firmans of investiture.\r\n\r\nIn the same year in which he arrived at this dignity, really the desire\r\nand object of Ali’s whole life, occurred also the death of the Sultan\r\nAbdul Hamid, whose two sons, Mustapha and Mahmoud, were confined in the\r\nOld Seraglio. This change of rulers, however, made no difference to Ali;\r\nthe peaceful Selim, exchanging the prison to which his nephews were now\r\nrelegated, for the throne of their father, confirmed the Pacha of Janina\r\nin the titles, offices, and privileges which had been conferred on him.\r\n\r\nEstablished in his position by this double investiture, Ali applied\r\nhimself to the definite settlement of his claims. He was now fifty years\r\nof age, and was at the height of his intellectual development:\r\nexperience had been his teacher, and the lesson of no single event had\r\nbeen lost upon him. An uncultivated but just and penetrating mind\r\nenabled him to comprehend facts, analyse causes, and anticipate results;\r\nand as his heart never interfered with the deductions of his rough\r\nintelligence, he had by a sort of logical sequence formulated an\r\ninflexible plan of action. This man, wholly ignorant, not only of the\r\nideas of history but also of the great names of Europe, had succeeded in\r\ndivining, and as a natural consequence of his active and practical\r\ncharacter, in also realising Macchiavelli, as is amply shown in the\r\nexpansion of his greatness and the exercise of his power. Without faith\r\nin God, despising men, loving and thinking only of himself, distrusting\r\nall around him, audacious in design, immovable in resolution, inexorable\r\nin execution, merciless in vengeance, by turns insolent, humble,\r\nviolent, or supple according to circumstances, always and entirely\r\nlogical in his egotism, he is Cesar Borgia reborn as a Mussulman; he is\r\nthe incarnate ideal of Florentine policy, the Italian prince converted\r\ninto a satrap.\r\n\r\nAge had as yet in no way impaired Ali’s strength and activity, and\r\nnothing prevented his profiting by the advantages of his position.\r\nAlready possessing great riches, which every day saw increasing under\r\nhis management, he maintained a large body of warlike and devoted\r\ntroops, he united the offices of Pacha of two tails of Janina, of\r\nToparch of Thessaly, and of Provost Marshal of the Highway. As\r\ninfluential aids both to his reputation for general ability and the\r\nterror of his’ arms, and his authority as ruler, there stood by his side\r\ntwo sons, Mouktar and Veli, offspring of his wife Emineh, both fully\r\ngrown and carefully educated in the principles of their father.\r\n\r\nAli’s first care, once master of Janina, was to annihilate the beys\r\nforming the aristocracy of the place, whose hatred he was well aware of,\r\nand whose plots he dreaded. He ruined them all, banishing many and\r\nputting others to death. Knowing that he must make friends to supply the\r\nvacancy caused by the destruction of his foes, he enriched with the\r\nspoil the Albanian mountaineers in his pay, known by the name of\r\nSkipetars, on whom he conferred most of the vacant employments. But much\r\ntoo prudent to allow all the power to fall into the hands of a single\r\ncaste, although a foreign one to the capital, he, by a singular\r\ninnovation, added to and mixed with them an infusion of Orthodox Greeks,\r\na skilful but despised race, whose talents he could use without having\r\nto dread their influence. While thus endeavouring on one side to destroy\r\nthe power of his enemies by depriving them of both authority and wealth,\r\nand on the other to consolidate his own by establishing a firm\r\nadministration, he neglected no means of acquiring popularity. A fervent\r\ndisciple of Mahomet when among fanatic Mussulmans, a materialist with\r\nthe Bektagis who professed a rude pantheism, a Christian among the\r\nGreeks, with whom he drank to the health of the Holy Virgin, he made\r\neverywhere partisans by flattering the idea most in vogue. But if he\r\nconstantly changed both opinions and language when dealing with\r\nsubordinates whom it was desirable to win over, Ali towards his\r\nsuperiors had one only line of conduct which he never transgressed.\r\nObsequious towards the Sublime Porte, so long as it did not interfere\r\nwith his private authority, he not only paid with exactitude all dues to\r\nthe sultan, to whom he even often advanced money, but he also pensioned\r\nthe most influential ministers. He was bent on having no enemies who\r\ncould really injure his power, and he knew that in an absolute\r\ngovernment no conviction can hold its own against the power of gold.\r\n\r\nHaving thus annihilated the nobles, deceived the multitude with\r\nplausible words and lulled to sleep the watchfulness of the Divan, Ali\r\nresolved to turn his arms against Kormovo. At the foot of its rocks he\r\nhad, in youth, experienced the disgrace of defeat, and during thirty\r\nnights Kamco and Chainitza had endured all horrors of outrage at the\r\nhands of its warriors. Thus the implacable pacha had a twofold wrong to\r\npunish, a double vengeance to exact.\r\n\r\nThis time, profiting by experience, he called in the aid of treachery.\r\nArrived at the citadel, he negotiated, promised an amnesty, forgiveness\r\nfor all, actual rewards for some. The inhabitants, only too happy to\r\nmake peace with so formidable an adversary, demanded and obtained a\r\ntruce to settle the conditions. This was exactly what Ali expected, and\r\nKormovo, sleeping on the faith of the treaty, was suddenly attacked and\r\ntaken. All who did not escape by flight perished by the sword in the\r\ndarkness, or by the hand of the executioner the next morning. Those who\r\nhad offered violence aforetime to Ali’s mother and sister were carefully\r\nsought for, and whether convicted or merely accused, were impaled on\r\nspits, torn with redhot pincers, and slowly roasted between two fires;\r\nthe women were shaved and publicly scourged, and then sold as slaves.\r\n\r\nThis vengeance, in which all the nobles of the province not yet entirely\r\nruined were compelled to assist, was worth a decisive victory to Ali.\r\nTowns, cantons, whole districts, overwhelmed with terror, submitted\r\nwithout striking a blow, and his name, joined to the recital of a\r\nmassacre which ranked as a glorious exploit in the eyes of this savage\r\npeople, echoed like thunder from valley to valley and mountain to\r\nmountain. In order that all surrounding him might participate in the joy\r\nof his success Ali gave his army a splendid festival. Of unrivalled\r\nactivity, and, Mohammedan only in name, he himself led the chorus in the\r\nPyrrhic and Klephtic dances, the ceremonials of warriors and of robbers.\r\nThere was no lack of wine, of sheep, goats, and lambs roasted before\r\nenormous fires; made of the debris of the ruined city; antique games of\r\narchery and wrestling were celebrated, and the victors received their\r\nprizes from the hand of their chief. The plunder, slaves, and cattle\r\nwere then shared, and the Tapygae, considered as the lowest of the four\r\ntribes composing the race of Skipetars, and ranking as the refuse of the\r\narmy, carried off into the mountains of Acroceraunia, doors, windows,\r\nnails, and even the tiles of the houses, which were then all surrendered\r\nto the flames.\r\n\r\nHowever, Ibrahim, the successor and son-in-law of Kurd Pacha, could not\r\nsee with indifference part of his province invaded by his ambitious\r\nneighbour. He complained and negotiated, but obtaining no satisfaction,\r\ncalled out an army composed of Skipetars of Toxid, all Islamites, and\r\ngave the command to his brother Sepher, Bey of Avlone. Ali, who had\r\nadopted the policy of opposing alternately the Cross to the Crescent and\r\nthe Crescent to the Cross, summoned to his aid the Christian chiefs of\r\nthe mountains, who descended into the plains at the head of their\r\nunconquered troops. As is generally the case in Albania, where war is\r\nmerely an excuse for brigandage, instead of deciding matters by a\r\npitched battle, both sides contented themselves with burning villages,\r\nhanging peasants, and carrying off cattle.\r\n\r\nAlso, in accordance with the custom of the country, the women interposed\r\nbetween the combatants, and the good and gentle Emineh laid proposals of\r\npeace before Ibrahim Pacha, to whose apathetic disposition a state of\r\nwar was disagreeable, and who was only too happy to conclude a fairly\r\nsatisfactory negotiation. A family alliance was arranged, in virtue of\r\nwhich Ali retained his conquests, which were considered as the marriage\r\nportion of Ibrahim’s eldest daughter, who became the wife of Ali’s\r\neldest son, Mouktar.\r\n\r\nIt was hoped that this peace might prove permanent, but the marriage\r\nwhich sealed the treaty was barely concluded before a fresh quarrel\r\nbroke out between the pachas. Ali, having wrung such important\r\nconcessions from the weakness of his neighbour, desired to obtain yet\r\nmore. But closely allied to Ibrahim were two persons gifted with great\r\nfirmness of character and unusual ability, whose position gave them\r\ngreat influence. They were his wife Zaidee, and his brother Sepher, who\r\nhad been in command during the war just terminated. As both were\r\ninimical to Ali, who could not hope to corrupt them, the latter resolved\r\nto get rid of them.\r\n\r\nHaving in the days of his youth been intimate with Kurd Pacha, Ali had\r\nendeavoured to seduce his daughter, already the wife of Ibrahim. Being\r\ndiscovered by the latter in the act of scaling the wall of his harem, he\r\nhad been obliged to fly the country. Wishing now to ruin the woman whom\r\nhe had formerly tried to corrupt, Ali sought to turn his former crime to\r\nthe success of a new one. Anonymous letters, secretly sent to Ibrahim,\r\nwarned him that his wife intended to poison him, in order to be able\r\nlater to marry Ali Pacha, whom she had always loved. In a country like\r\nTurkey, where to suspect a woman is to accuse her, and accusation is\r\nsynonymous with condemnation, such a calumny might easily cause the\r\ndeath of the innocent Zaidee. But if Ibrahim was weak and indolent, he\r\nwas also confiding and generous. He took the letters; to his wife, who\r\nhad no difficulty in clearing herself, and who warned him against the\r\nwriter, whose object and plots she easily divined, so that this odious\r\nconspiracy turned only to Ali’s discredit. But the latter was not likely\r\neither to concern himself as to what others said or thought about him or\r\nto be disconcerted by a failure. He simply turned his machinations\r\nagainst his other enemy, and arranged matters this time so as to avoid a\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nHe sent to Zagori, a district noted for its doctors, for a quack who\r\nundertook to poison Sepher Bey on condition of receiving forty purses.\r\nWhen all was settled, the miscreant set out for Berat, and was\r\nimmediately accused by Ali of evasion, and his wife and children were\r\narrested as accomplices and detained, apparently as hostages for the\r\ngood behaviour of their husband and father, but really as pledges for\r\nhis silence when the crime should have been accomplished. Sepher Bey,\r\ninformed of this by letters which Ali wrote to the Pacha of Berat\r\ndemanding the fugitive, thought that a man persecuted by his enemy would\r\nbe faithful to himself, and took the supposed runaway into his service.\r\nThe traitor made skilful use of the kindness of his too credulous\r\nprotector, insinuated himself into his confidence, became his trusted\r\nphysician and apothecary, and gave him poison instead of medicine on the\r\nvery first appearance of indisposition. As soon as symptoms of death\r\nappeared, the poisoner fled, aided by the emissaries of Ali, with whom\r\nthe court of Berat was packed, and presented himself at Janina to\r\nreceive the reward of his crime. Ali thanked him for his zeal, commended\r\nhis skill, and referred him to the treasurer. But the instant the wretch\r\nleft the seraglio in order to receive his recompense, he was seized by\r\nthe executioners and hurried to the gallows. In thus punishing the\r\nassassin, Ali at one blow discharged the debt he owed him, disposed of\r\nthe single witness to be dreaded, and displayed his own friendship for\r\nthe victim! Not content with this, he endeavoured to again throw\r\nsuspicion on the wife of Ibrahim Pacha, whom he accused of being jealous\r\nof the influence which Sepher Pacha had exercised in the family. This he\r\nmentioned regularly in conversation, writing in the same style to his\r\nagents at Constantinople, and everywhere where there was any profit in\r\nslandering a family whose ruin he desired for the sake of their\r\npossessions. Before long he made a pretext out of the scandal started by\r\nhimself, and prepared to take up arms in order, he said, to avenge his\r\nfriend Sepher Bey, when he was anticipated by Ibrahim Pacha, who roused\r\nagainst him the allied Christians of Thesprotia, foremost among whom\r\nranked the Suliots famed through Albania for their courage and their\r\nlove of independence.\r\n\r\nAfter several battles, in which his enemies had the a vantage, Ali began\r\nnegotiations with Ibrahim, and finally concluded a treaty offensive and\r\ndefensive. This fresh alliance was, like the first, to be cemented by a\r\nmarriage. The virtuous Emineh, seeing her son Veli united to the second\r\ndaughter of Ibrahim, trusted that the feud between the two families was\r\nnow quenched, and thought herself at the summit of happiness. But her\r\njoy was not of long duration; the death-groan was again to be heard\r\namidst the songs of the marriage-feast.\r\n\r\nThe daughter of Chainitza, by her first husband, Ali, had married a\r\ncertain Murad, the Bey of Clerisoura. This nobleman, attached to Ibrahim\r\nPacha by both blood and affection, since the death of Sepher Bey, had,\r\nbecome the special object of Ali’s hatred, caused by the devotion of\r\nMurad to his patron, over whom he had great influence, and from whom\r\nnothing could detach him. Skilful in concealing truth under special\r\npretexts, Ali gave out that the cause of his known dislike to this young\r\nman was that the latter, although his nephew by marriage, had several\r\ntimes fought in hostile ranks against him. Therefore the amiable Ibrahim\r\nmade use of the marriage treaty to arrange an honourable reconciliation\r\nbetween Murad Bey and his uncle, and appointed the former \"Ruler a the\r\nMarriage Feast,\" in which capacity he was charged to conduct the bride\r\nto Janina and deliver her to her husband, the young Veli Bey. He had\r\naccomplished his mission satisfactorily, and was received by Ali with\r\nall apparent hospitality. The festival began on his arrival towards the\r\nend of November 1791, and had already continued several days, when\r\nsuddenly it was announced that a shot had been fired upon Ali, who had\r\nonly escaped by a miracle, and that the assassin was still at large.\r\nThis news spread terror through the city and the palace, and everyone\r\ndreaded being seized as the guilty person. Spies were everywhere\r\nemployed, but they declared search was useless, and that there must be an\r\nextensive conspiracy against Ali’s life. The latter complained of being\r\nsurrounded by enemies, and announced that henceforth he would receive\r\nonly one person at a time, who should lay down his arms before entering\r\nthe hall now set apart for public audience. It was a chamber built over\r\na vault, and entered by a sort of trap-door, only reached by a ladder.\r\n\r\nAfter having for several days received his couriers in this sort of\r\ndovecot, Ali summoned his nephew in order to entrust with him the\r\nwedding gifts. Murad took this as a sign of favour, and joyfully\r\nacknowledged the congratulations of his friends. He presented himself at\r\nthe time arranged, the guards at the foot of the ladder demanded his\r\narms, which he gave up readily, and ascended the ladder full of hope.\r\nScarcely had the trap-door closed behind him when a pistol ball, fired\r\nfrom a dark corner, broke his shoulder blade, and he fell, but sprang up\r\nand attempted to fly. Ali issued from his hiding place and sprang upon\r\nhim, but notwithstanding his wound the young bey defended himself\r\nvigorously, uttering terrible cries. The pacha, eager to finish, and\r\nfinding his hands insufficient, caught a burning log from the hearth,\r\nstruck his nephew in the face with it, felled him to the ground, and\r\ncompleted his bloody task. This accomplished, Ali called for help with\r\nloud cries, and when his guards entered he showed the bruises he had\r\nreceived and the blood with which he was covered, declaring that he had\r\nkilled in self-defence a villain who endeavoured to assassinate him. He\r\nordered the body to be searched, and a letter was found in a pocket\r\nwhich Ali had himself just placed there, which purported to give the\r\ndetails of the pretended conspiracy.\r\n\r\nAs Murad’s brother was seriously compromised by this letter, he also was\r\nimmediately seized, and strangled without any pretence of trial. The\r\nwhole palace rejoiced, thanks were rendered to Heaven by one of those\r\nsacrifices of animals still occasionally made in the East to celebrate\r\nan escape from great danger, and Ali released some prisoners in order to\r\nshow his gratitude to Providence for having protected him from so\r\nhorrible a crime. He received congratulatory visits, and composed an\r\napology attested by a judicial declaration by the cadi, in which the\r\nmemory of Murad and his brother was declared accursed. Finally,\r\ncommissioners, escorted by a strong body of soldiers, were sent to seize\r\nthe property of the two brothers, because, said the decree, it was just\r\nthat the injured should inherit the possessions of his would-be\r\nassassins.\r\n\r\nThus was exterminated the only family capable of opposing the Pacha of\r\nJanina, or which could counterbalance his influence over the weak\r\nIbrahim of Berat. The latter, abandoned by his brave defenders, and\r\nfinding himself at the mercy of his enemy, was compelled to submit to\r\nwhat he could not prevent, and protested only by tears against these\r\ncrimes, which seemed to herald a terrible future for himself.\r\n\r\nAs for Emineh, it is said that from the date of this catastrophe she\r\nseparated herself almost entirely from her blood-stained husband, and\r\nspent her life in the recesses of the harem, praying as a Christian both\r\nfor the murderer and his victims. It is a relief, in the midst of this\r\natrocious saturnalia to encounter this noble and gentle character, which\r\nlike a desert oasis, affords a rest to eyes wearied with the\r\ncontemplation of so much wickedness and treachery.\r\n\r\nAli lost in her the guardian angel who alone could in any way restrain\r\nhis violent passions. Grieved at first by the withdrawal of the wife\r\nwhom hitherto he had loved exclusively, he endeavoured in vain to regain\r\nher affection; and then sought in new vices compensation for the\r\nhappiness he had lost, and gave himself up to sensuality. Ardent in\r\neverything, he carried debauchery to a monstrous extent, and as if his\r\npalaces were not large enough for his desires, he assumed various\r\ndisguises; sometimes in order to traverse the streets by night in search\r\nof the lowest pleasures; sometimes penetrating by day into churches and\r\nprivate houses seeking for young men and maidens remarkable for their\r\nbeauty, who were then carried off to his harem.\r\n\r\nHis sons, following in his footsteps, kept also scandalous households,\r\nand seemed to dispute preeminence in evil with their father, each in his\r\nown manner. Drunkenness was the speciality of the eldest, Mouktar, who\r\nwas without rival among the hard drinkers of Albania, and who was\r\nreputed to have emptied a whole wine-skin in one evening after a\r\nplentiful meal. Gifted with the hereditary violence of his family, he\r\nhad, in his drunken fury, slain several persons, among others his\r\nsword-bearer, the companion of his childhood and confidential friend of\r\nhis whole life. Veli chose a different course. Realising the Marquis de\r\nSade as his father had realised Macchiavelli, he delighted in mingling\r\ntogether debauchery and cruelty, and his amusement consisted in biting\r\nthe lips he had kissed, and tearing with his nails the forms he had\r\ncaressed. The people of Janina saw with horror more than one woman in\r\ntheir midst whose nose and ears he had caused to be cut off, and had\r\nthen turned into the streets.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a reign of terror; neither fortune, life, honour, nor\r\nfamily were safe. Mothers cursed their fruitfulness, and women their\r\nbeauty. Fear soon engenders corruption, and subjects are speedily\r\ntainted by the depravity of their masters. Ali, considering a\r\ndemoralised race as easier to govern, looked on with satisfaction.\r\n\r\nWhile he strengthened by every means his authority from within, he\r\nmissed no opportunity of extending his rule without. In 1803 he declared\r\nwar against the Suliots, whose independence he had frequently\r\nendeavoured either to purchase or to overthrow. The army sent against\r\nthem, although ten thousand strong, was at first beaten everywhere. Ali\r\nthen, as usual, brought treason to his aid, and regained the advantage.\r\nIt became evident that, sooner or later, the unhappy Suliots must\r\nsuccumb.\r\n\r\nForeseeing the horrors which their defeat would entail, Emineh, touched\r\nwith compassion, issued from her seclusion and cast herself at Ali’s\r\nfeet. He raised her, seated her beside him, and inquired as to her\r\nwishes. She spoke of, generosity, of mercy; he listened as if touched\r\nand wavering, until she named the Suliots. Then, filled with fury, he\r\nseized a pistol and fired at her. She was not hurt, but fell to the\r\nground overcome with terror, and her women hastily intervened and\r\ncarried her away. For the first time in his life, perhaps, Ali shuddered\r\nbefore the dread of a murder.\r\n\r\nIt was his wife, the mother of his children, whom he saw lying at his\r\nfeet, and the recollection afflicted and tormented him. He rose in the\r\nnight and went to Emineh’s apartment; he knocked and called, but being\r\nrefused admittance, in his anger he broke open the door. Terrified by\r\nthe noise; and at the sight of her infuriated husband, Emineh fell into\r\nviolent convulsions, and shortly expired. Thus perished the daughter of\r\nCapelan Pacha, wife of Ali Tepeleni, and mother of Mouktar and Veli,\r\nwho, doomed to live surrounded by evil, yet remained virtuous and good.\r\n\r\nHer death caused universal mourning throughout Albania, and produced a\r\nnot less deep impression on the mind of her murderer. Emineh’s spectre\r\npursued him in his pleasures, in the council chamber, in the hours of\r\nnight. He saw her, he heard her, and would awake, exclaiming, \"my wife!\r\nmy wife!—It is my wife!—Her eyes are angry; she threatens me!—Save me!\r\nMercy!\" For more than ten years Ali never dared to sleep alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nIn December, the Suliots, decimated by battle, worn by famine,\r\ndiscouraged by treachery, were obliged to capitulate. The treaty gave\r\nthem leave to go where they would, their own mountains excepted. The\r\nunfortunate tribe divided into two parts, the one going towards Parga,\r\nthe other towards Prevesa. Ali gave orders for the destruction of both,\r\nnotwithstanding the treaty.\r\n\r\nThe Parga division was attacked in its march, and charged by a numerous\r\nbody of Skipetars. Its destruction seemed imminent, but instinct\r\nsuddenly revealed to the ignorant mountaineers the one manoeuvre which\r\nmight save them. They formed a square, placing old men, women, children,\r\nand cattle in the midst, and, protected by this military formation,\r\nentered Parga in full view of the cut-throats sent to pursue them.\r\n\r\nLess fortunate was the Prevesa division, which, terrified by a sudden\r\nand unexpected attack, fled in disorder to a Greek convent called\r\nZalongos. But the gate was soon broken down, and the unhappy Suliots\r\nmassacred to the last man.\r\n\r\nThe women, whose tents had been pitched on the summit of a lofty rock,\r\nbeheld the terrible carnage which destroyed their defenders. Henceforth\r\ntheir only prospect was that of becoming the slaves of those who had\r\njust slaughtered their husbands and brothers. An heroic resolution\r\nspared them this infamy; they joined hands, and chanting their national\r\nsongs, moved in a solemn dance round the rocky platform. As the song\r\nended, they uttered a prolonged and piercing cry, and cast themselves\r\nand their children down into the profound abyss beneath.\r\n\r\nThere were still some Suliots left in their country when Ali Pacha took\r\npossession of it. These were all taken and brought to Janina, and their\r\nsufferings were the first adornments of the festival made for the army.\r\nEvery soldier’s imagination was racked for the discovery of new\r\ntortures, and the most original among them had the privilege of\r\nthemselves carrying out their inventions.\r\n\r\nThere were some who, having had their noses and ears cut off, were\r\ncompelled to eat them raw, dressed as a salad. One young man was scalped\r\nuntil the skin fell back upon his shoulders, then beaten round the court\r\nof the seraglio for the pacha’s entertainment, until at length a lance\r\nwas run through his body and he was cast on the funeral pile. Many were\r\nboiled alive and their flesh then thrown to the dogs.\r\n\r\nFrom this time the Cross has disappeared from the Selleid mountains, and\r\nthe gentle prayer of Christ no longer wakes the echoes of Suli.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of this war, and shortly after the death of Emineh,\r\nanother dismal drama was enacted in the pacha’s family, whose active\r\nwickedness nothing seemed to weary. The scandalous libertinism of both\r\nfather and sons had corrupted all around as well as themselves. This\r\ndemoralisation brought bitter fruits for all alike: the subjects endured\r\na terrible tyranny; the masters sowed among themselves distrust,\r\ndiscord, and hatred. The father wounded his two sons by turns in their\r\ntenderest affections, and the sons avenged themselves by abandoning\r\ntheir father in the hour of danger.\r\n\r\nThere was in Janina a woman named Euphrosyne, a niece of the archbishop,\r\nmarried to one of the richest Greek merchants, and noted for wit and\r\nbeauty. She was already the mother of two children, when Mouktar became\r\nenamoured of her, and ordered her to come to his palace. The unhappy\r\nEuphrosyne, at once guessing his object, summoned a family council to\r\ndecide what should be done. All agreed that there was no escape, and\r\nthat her husband’s life was in danger, on account of the jealousy of his\r\nterrible rival. He fled the city that same night, and his wife\r\nsurrendered herself to Mouktar, who, softened by her charms, soon\r\nsincerely loved her, and overwhelmed her with presents and favours.\r\nThings were in this position when Mouktar was obliged to depart on an\r\nimportant expedition.\r\n\r\nScarcely had he started before his wives complained to Ali that\r\nEuphrosyne usurped their rights and caused their husband to neglect\r\nthem. Ali, who complained greatly of his sons’ extravagance, and\r\nregretted the money they squandered, at once struck a blow which was\r\nboth to enrich himself and increase the terror of his name.\r\n\r\nOne night he appeared by torchlight, accompanied by his guards, at\r\nEuphrosyne’s house. Knowing his cruelty and avarice, she sought to\r\ndisarm one by gratifying the other: she collected her money and jewels\r\nand laid them at Ali’s feet with a look of supplication.\r\n\r\n\"These things are only my own property, which you restore,\" said he,\r\ntaking possession of the rich offering. \"Can you give back the heart of\r\nMouktar, which you have stolen?\"\r\n\r\nEuphrosyne besought him by his paternal feelings, for the sake of his\r\nson whose love had been her misfortune and was now her only crime, to\r\nspare a mother whose conduct had been otherwise irreproachable. But her\r\ntears and pleadings produced no effect on Ali, who ordered her to be\r\ntaken, loaded with fetters and covered with a piece of sackcloth, to the\r\nprison of the seraglio.\r\n\r\nIf it were certain that there was no hope for the unhappy Euphrosyne,\r\none trusted that she might at least be the only victim. But Ali,\r\nprofessing to follow the advice of some severe reformers who wished to\r\nrestore decent morality, arrested at the same time fifteen ladies\r\nbelonging to the best Christian families in Janina. A Wallachian, named\r\nNicholas Janco, took the opportunity to denounce his own wife, who was\r\non the point of becoming a mother, as guilty of adultery, and handed her\r\nalso over to the pacha. These unfortunate women were brought before Ali\r\nto undergo a trial of which a sentence of death was the foregone\r\nconclusion. They were then confined in a dungeon, where they spent two\r\ndays of misery. The third night, the executioners appeared to conduct\r\nthem to the lake where they were to perish. Euphrosyne, too exhausted to\r\nendure to the end, expired by the way, and when she was flung with the\r\nrest into the dark waters, her soul had already escaped from its earthly\r\ntenement. Her body was found the next day, and was buried in the\r\ncemetery of the monastery of Saints-Anargyres, where her tomb, covered\r\nwith white iris and sheltered by a wild olive tree, is yet shown.\r\n\r\nMouktar was returning from his expedition when a courier from his\r\nbrother Veli brought him a letter informing him of these events. He\r\nopened it. \"Euphrosyne!\" he cried, and, seizing one of his pistols,\r\nfired it at the messenger, who fell dead at his feet,—\"Euphrosyne,\r\nbehold thy first victim!\" Springing on his horse, he galloped towards\r\nJanina. His guards followed at a distance, and the inhabitants of all\r\nthe villages he passed fled at his approach. He paid no attention to\r\nthem, but rode till his horse fell dead by the lake which had engulfed\r\nEuphrosyne, and then, taking a boat, he went to hide his grief and rage\r\nin his own palace.\r\n\r\nAli, caring little for passion which evaporated in tears and cries, sent\r\nan order to Mouktar to appear before him at once. \"He will not kill\r\nyou,\" he remarked to his messenger, with a bitter smile. And, in fact,\r\nthe man who a moment before was furiously raging and storming against\r\nhis father, as if overwhelmed by this imperious message, calmed down,\r\nand obeyed.\r\n\r\n\"Come hither, Mouktar,\" said the pacha, extending his murderous hand to\r\nbe kissed as soon as his son appeared. \"I shall take no notice of your\r\nanger, but in future never forget that a man who braves public opinion\r\nas I do fears nothing in the world. You can go now; when your troops\r\nhave rested from their march, you can come and ask for orders. Go,\r\nremember what I have said.\"\r\n\r\nMouktar retired as submissively as if he had just received pardon for\r\nsome serious crime, and found no better consolation than to spend the\r\nnight with Veli in drinking and debauchery. But a day was to come when\r\nthe brothers, alike outraged by their father, would plot and carry out a\r\nterrible vengeance.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Porte began to take umbrage at the continual aggrandisement\r\nof the Pacha of Janina. Not daring openly to attack so formidable a\r\nvassal, the sultan sought by underhand means to diminish his power, and\r\nunder the pretext that Ali was becoming too old for the labour of so\r\nmany offices, the government of Thessaly was withdrawn from him, but, to\r\nshow that this was not done in enmity, the province was entrusted to his\r\nnephew, Elmas Bey, son of Suleiman and Chainitza.\r\n\r\nChainitza, fully as ambitious as her brother, could not contain her\r\ndelight at the idea of governing in the name of her son, who was weak\r\nand gentle in character and accustomed to obey her implicitly. She asked\r\nher brother’s permission to go to Trikala to be present at the\r\ninstallation, and obtained it, to everybody’s astonishment; for no one\r\ncould imagine that Ali would peacefully renounce so important a\r\ngovernment as that of Thessaly. However, he dissembled so skilfully that\r\neveryone was deceived by his apparent resignation, and applauded his\r\nmagnanimity, when he provided his sister with a brilliant escort to\r\nconduct her to the capital of the province of which he had just been\r\ndeprived in favour of his nephew. He sent letters of congratulation to\r\nthe latter as well as magnificent presents, among them a splendid\r\npelisse of black fox, which had cost more than a hundred thousand francs\r\nof Western money. He requested Elmas Bey to honour him by wearing this\r\nrobe on the day when the sultan’s envoy should present him with the\r\nfirman of investiture, and Chainitza herself was charged to deliver both\r\ngifts and messages.\r\n\r\nChainitza arrived safely at Trikala, and faithfully delivered the\r\nmessages with which she had been entrusted. When the ceremony she so\r\nardently desired took place, she herself took charge of all the\r\narrangements. Elmas, wearing the black fox pelisse, was proclaimed, and\r\nacknowledged as Governor of Thessaly in her presence. \"My son is pacha!\"\r\nshe cried in the delirium of joy. \"My son is pacha! and my nephews will\r\ndie of envy!\" But her triumph was not to be of long duration. A few days\r\nafter his installation, Elmas began to feel strangely languid. Continual\r\nlethargy, convulsive sneezing, feverish eyes, soon betokened a serious\r\nillness. Ali’s gift had accomplished its purpose. The pelisse, carefully\r\nimpregnated with smallpox germs taken from a young girl suffering from\r\nthis malady, had conveyed the dreaded disease to the new pacha, who, not\r\nhaving been inoculated, died in a few days.\r\n\r\nThe grief of Chainitza at her son’s death displayed itself in sobs,\r\nthreats, and curses, but, not knowing whom to blame for her misfortune,\r\nshe hastened to leave the scene of it, and returned to Janina, to mingle\r\nher tears with those of her brother. She found Ali apparently in such\r\ndepths of grief, that instead of suspecting, she was actually tempted to\r\npity him, and this seeming sympathy soothed her distress, aided by the\r\ncaresses of her second son, Aden Bey. Ali, thoughtful of his own\r\ninterests, took care to send one of his own officers to Trikala, to\r\nadminister justice in the place of his deceased nephew, and the Porte,\r\nseeing that all attempts against him only caused misfortune, consented\r\nto his resuming the government of Thessaly.\r\n\r\nThis climax roused the suspicions of many persons. But the public voice,\r\nalready discussing the causes of the death of Elinas, was stifled by the\r\nthunder of the cannon, which, from the ramparts of Janina, announced to\r\nEpirus the birth of another son to Ali, Salik Bey, whose mother was a\r\nGeorgian slave.\r\n\r\nFortune, seemingly always ready both to crown Ali’s crimes with success\r\nand to fulfil his wishes, had yet in reserve a more precious gift than\r\nany of the others, that of a good and beautiful wife; who should\r\nreplace, and even efface the memory of the beloved Emineh.\r\n\r\nThe Porte, while sending to Ali the firman which restored to him the\r\ngovernment of Thessaly, ordered him to seek out and destroy a society of\r\ncoiners who dwelt within his jurisdiction. Ali, delighted to, prove his\r\nzeal by a service which cost nothing but bloodshed; at once set his\r\nspies to work, and having discovered the abode of the gang, set out for\r\nthe place attended by a strong escort. It was a village called\r\nPlikivitza.\r\n\r\nHaving arrived in the evening, he spent the night in taking measures to\r\nprevent escape, and at break of day attacked the village suddenly with\r\nhis whole force. The coiners were seized in the act. Ali immediately\r\nordered the chief to be hung at his own door and the whole population to\r\nbe massacred. Suddenly a young girl of great beauty made her way through\r\nthe tumult and sought refuge at his feet. Ali, astonished, asked who she\r\nwas. She answered with a look of mingled innocence and terror, kissing\r\nhis hands, which she bathed with tears, and said:\r\n\r\n\"O my lord! I implore thee to intercede with the terrible vizier Ali for\r\nmy mother and brothers. My father is dead, behold where he hangs at the\r\ndoor of our cottage! But we have done nothing to rouse the anger of our\r\ndreadful master. My mother is a poor woman who never offended anyone,\r\nand we are only weak children. Save us from him!\"\r\n\r\nTouched in spite of himself, the pacha took the girl in his arms, and\r\nanswered her with a gentle smile.\r\n\r\n\"Thou hast come to the wrong man, child: I am this terrible vizier.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, no! you are good, you will be our good lord.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, be comforted, my child, and show me thy mother and thy brothers;\r\nthey shall be spared. Thou hast saved their lives.\"\r\n\r\nAnd as she knelt at his feet, overcome with joy, he raised her and asked\r\nher name.\r\n\r\n\"Basilessa,\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\"Basilessa, Queen! it is a name of good augury. Basilessa, thou shalt\r\ndwell with me henceforth.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he collected the members of her family, and gave orders for them to\r\nbe sent to Janina in company with the maiden, who repaid his mercy with\r\nboundless love and devotion.\r\n\r\nLet us mention one trait of gratitude shown by Ali at the end of this\r\nexpedition, and his record of good deeds is then closed. Compelled by a\r\nstorm to take refuge in a miserable hamlet, he inquired its name, and on\r\nhearing it appeared surprised and thoughtful, as if trying to recall\r\nlost memories. Suddenly he asked if a woman named Nouza dwelt in the\r\nvillage, and was told there was an old infirm woman of that name in\r\ngreat poverty. He ordered her to be brought before him. She came and\r\nprostrated herself in terror. Ali raised her kindly.\r\n\r\n\"Dost thou not know me?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Have mercy, great Vizier,\" answered the poor woman, who, having nothing\r\nto lose but her life, imagined that even that would be taken from her.\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said the pacha, \"that if thou knowest me, thou dost not really\r\nrecognise me.\"\r\n\r\nThe woman looked at him wonderingly, not understanding his words in the\r\nleast.\r\n\r\n\"Dost thou remember,\" continued Ali, \"that forty years ago a young man\r\nasked for shelter from the foes who pursued him? Without inquiring his\r\nname or standing, thou didst hide him in thy humble house, and dressed\r\nhis wounds, and shared thy scanty food with him, and when he was able to\r\ngo forward thou didst stand on thy threshold to wish him good luck and\r\nsuccess. Thy wishes were heard, for the young man was Ali Tepeleni, and\r\nI who speak am he!\"\r\n\r\nThe old woman stood overwhelmed with astonishment. She departed calling\r\ndown blessings on the pasha, who assured her a pension of fifteen\r\nhundred francs for the rest of her days.\r\n\r\nBut these two good actions are only flashes of light illuminating the\r\ndark horizon of Ali’s life for a brief moment. Returned to Janina, he\r\nresumed his tyranny, his intrigues, and cruelty. Not content with the\r\nvast territory which owned his sway, he again invaded that of his\r\nneighbours on every pretext. Phocis, Mtolia, Acarnania, were by turns\r\noccupied by his troops, the country ravaged, and the inhabitants\r\ndecimated. At the same time he compelled Ibrahim Pacha to surrender his\r\nlast remaining daughter, and give her in marriage to his nephew, Aden\r\nBey, the son of Chainitza. This new alliance with a family he had so\r\noften attacked and despoiled gave him fresh arms against it, whether by\r\nbeing enabled better to watch the pasha’s sons, or to entice them into\r\nsome snare with greater ease.\r\n\r\nWhilst he thus married his nephew, he did not neglect the advancement of\r\nhis sons. By the aid of the French Ambassador, whom he had convinced of\r\nhis devotion to the Emperor Napoleon, he succeeded in getting the\r\npachalik of Morea bestowed on Veli, and that of Lepanto on Mouktar. But\r\nas in placing his sons in these exalted positions his only aim was to\r\naggrandise and consolidate his own power, he himself ordered their\r\nretinues, giving them officers of his own choosing. When they departed\r\nto their governments, he kept their wives, their children, and even\r\ntheir furniture as pledges, saying that they ought not to be encumbered\r\nwith domestic establishments in time of war, Turkey just then being at\r\nopen war with England. He also made use of this opportunity to get rid\r\nof people who displeased him, among others, of a certain Ismail Pacho\r\nBey, who had been alternately both tool and enemy, whom he made\r\nsecretary to his son Veli, professedly as a pledge of reconciliation and\r\nfavour, but really in order to despoil him more easily of the\r\nconsiderable property which he possessed at Janina. Pacho was not\r\ndeceived, and showed his resentment openly. \"The wretch banishes me,\" he\r\ncried, pointing out Ali, who was sitting at a window in the palace, \"he\r\nsends me away in order to rob me; but I will avenge myself whatever\r\nhappens, and I shall die content if I can procure his destruction at the\r\nprice of my own.\"\r\n\r\nContinually increasing his power, Ali endeavoured to consolidate it\r\npermanently. He had entered by degrees into secret negotiations with all\r\nthe great powers of Europe, hoping in the end to make himself\r\nindependent, and to obtain recognition as Prince of Greece. A mysterious\r\nand unforeseen incident betrayed this to the Porte, and furnished actual\r\nproofs of his treason in letters confirmed by Ali’s own seal. The Sultan\r\nSelim immediately, sent to Janina a \"kapidgi-bachi,\" or plenipotentiary,\r\nto examine into the case and try the delinquent.\r\n\r\nArrived at Janina, this officer placed before Ali the proofs of his\r\nunderstanding with the enemies of the State. Ali was not strong enough\r\nto throw off the mask, and yet could not deny such overwhelming\r\nevidence. He determined to obtain time.\r\n\r\n\"No wonder,\" said he, \"that I appear guilty in the eyes of His Highness.\r\nThis seal is, certainly mine, I cannot deny it; but the writing is not\r\nthat of my secretaries, and the seal must have been obtained and used to\r\nsign these guilty letters in order to ruin me. I pray you to grant me a\r\nfew days in order to clear up this iniquitous mystery, which compromises\r\nme in the eyes of my master the sultan and of all good Mahommedans. May\r\nAllah grant me the means of proving my innocence, which is as pure as\r\nthe rays of the sun, although everything seems against me!\"\r\n\r\nAfter this conference, Ali, pretending to be engaged in a secret\r\ninquiry, considered how he could legally escape from this predicament.\r\nHe spent some days in making plans which were given up as soon as\r\nformed, until his fertile genius at length suggested a means of getting\r\nclear of one of the greatest difficulties in which he had ever found\r\nhimself. Sending for a Greek whom he had often employed, he addressed\r\nhim thus:\r\n\r\n\"Thou knowest I have always shown thee favour, and the day is arrived\r\nwhen thy fortune shall be made. Henceforth thou shalt be as my son, thy\r\nchildren shall be as mine, my house shall be thy home, and in return for\r\nmy benefits I require one small service. This accursed kapidgi-bachi has\r\ncome hither bringing certain papers signed with my seal, intending to\r\nuse them to my discredit, and thus to extort money from me. Of money I\r\nhave already given too much, and I intend this time to escape without\r\nbeing plundered except for the sake of a good servant like thee.\r\nTherefore, my son, thou shalt go before the tribunal when I tell thee,\r\nand declare before this kapidgi-bachi and the cadi that thou hast\r\nwritten these letters attributed to me, and that thou didst seal them\r\nwith my seal, in order to give them due weight and importance.\"\r\n\r\nThe unhappy Greek grew pale and strove to answer.\r\n\r\n\"What fearest thou, my son?\" resumed Ali. \"Speak, am I not thy good\r\nmaster? Thou wilt be sure of my lasting favour, and who is there to\r\ndread when I protect thee? Is it the kapidgi-bachi? he has no authority\r\nhere. I have thrown twenty as good as he into the lake! If more is\r\nrequired to reassure thee, I swear by the Prophet, by my own and my\r\nsons’ heads, that no harm shall come to thee from him. Be ready, then,\r\nto do as I tell thee, and beware of mentioning this matter to anyone, in\r\norder that all may be accomplished according to our mutual wishes.\"\r\n\r\nMore terrified by dread of the pacha, from whose wrath in case of\r\nrefusal there was no chance of escape, than tempted by his promises, the\r\nGreek undertook the false swearing required. Ali, delighted, dismissed\r\nhim with a thousand assurances of protection, and then requested the\r\npresence of the sultan’s envoy, to whom he said, with much emotion:\r\n\r\n\"I have at length unravelled the infernal plot laid against me; it is\r\nthe work of a man in the pay of the implacable enemies of the Sublime\r\nPorte, and who is a Russian agent. He is in my power, and I have given\r\nhim hopes of pardon on condition of full confession. Will you then\r\nsummon the cadi, the judges and ecclesiastics of the town, in order that\r\nthey may hear the guilty man’s deposition, and that the light of truth\r\nmay purify their minds?\"\r\n\r\nThe tribunal was soon assembled, and the trembling Greek appeared in the\r\nmidst of a solemn silence. \"Knowest thou this writing?\" demanded the\r\ncadi.—\"It is mine.\"—\"And this seal?\"—\"It is that of my master, Ali\r\nPacha.\"—\"How does it come to be placed at the foot of these letters?\"—\"I\r\ndid this by order of my chief, abusing the confidence of my master, who\r\noccasionally allowed me to use it to sign his orders.\"—\"It is enough:\r\nthou canst withdraw.\"\r\n\r\nUneasy as to the success of his intrigue, Ali was approaching the Hall\r\nof Justice. As he entered the court, the Greek, who had just finished\r\nhis examination, threw himself at his feet, assuring him that all had\r\ngone well. \"It is good,\" said Ali; \"thou shalt have thy reward.\" Turning\r\nround, he made a sign to his guards, who had their orders, and who\r\ninstantly seized the unhappy Greek, and, drowning his voice with their\r\nshouts, hung him in the courtyard. This execution finished, the pacha\r\npresented himself before the judges and inquired the result of their\r\ninvestigation. He was answered by a burst of congratulation. \"Well,\"\r\nsaid he, \"the guilty author of this plot aimed at me is no more; I\r\nordered him to be hung without waiting to hear your decision. May all\r\nenemies of our glorious sultan perish even as he!\"\r\n\r\nA report of what had occurred was immediately drawn up, and, to assist\r\nmatters still further, Ali sent the kapidgi-bachi a gift of fifty\r\npurses, which he accepted without difficulty, and also secured the\r\nfavour of the Divan by considerable presents. The sultan, yielding to\r\nthe advice of his councillors, appeared to have again received him into\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\nBut Ali knew well that this appearance of sunshine was entirely\r\ndeceptive, and that Selim only professed to believe in his innocence\r\nuntil the day should arrive when the sultan could safely punish his\r\ntreason. He sought therefore to compass the latter’s downfall, and made\r\ncommon cause with his enemies, both internal and external. A conspiracy,\r\nhatched between the discontented pachas and the English agents, shortly\r\nbroke out, and one day, when Ali was presiding at the artillery practice\r\nof some French gunners sent to Albania by the Governor of Illyria, a\r\nTartar brought him news of the deposition of Selim, who was succeeded by\r\nhis nephew Mustapha. Ali sprang up in delight, and publicly thanked\r\nAllah for this great good fortune. He really did profit by this change\r\nof rulers, but he profited yet more by a second revolution which caused\r\nthe deaths both of Selim, whom the promoters wished to reestablish on\r\nthe throne, and of Mustapha whose downfall they intended. Mahmoud II,\r\nwho was next invested with the scimitar of Othman, came to the throne in\r\ntroublous times, after much bloodshed, in the midst of great political\r\nupheavals, and had neither the will nor the power to attack one of his\r\nmost powerful vassals. He received with evident satisfaction the million\r\npiastres which, at, his installation, Ali hastened to send as a proof of\r\nhis devotion, assured the pacha of his favour, and confirmed both him\r\nand his sons in their offices and dignities. This fortunate change in\r\nhis position brought Ali’s pride and audacity to a climax. Free from\r\npressing anxiety, he determined to carry out a project which had been\r\nthe dream of his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter taking possession of Argyro-Castron, which he had long coveted,\r\nAli led his victorious army against the town of Kardiki, whose\r\ninhabitants had formerly joined with those of Kormovo in the outrage\r\ninflicted on his mother and sister. The besieged, knowing they had no\r\nmercy to hope for, defended themselves bravely, but were obliged to\r\nyield to famine. After a month’s blockade, the common people, having no\r\nfood for themselves or their cattle, began to cry for mercy in the open\r\nstreets, and their chiefs, intimidated by the general misery and unable\r\nto stand alone, consented to capitulate. Ali, whose intentions as to the\r\nfate of this unhappy town were irrevocably decided, agreed to all that\r\nthey asked. A treaty was signed by both parties, and solemnly sworn to\r\non the Koran, in virtue of which seventy-two beys, heads of the\r\nprincipal Albanian families, were to go to Janina as free men, and fully\r\narmed. They were to be received with the honours due to their rank as\r\nfree tenants of the sultan, their lives and their families were to be\r\nspared, and also their possessions. The other inhabitants of Kardiki,\r\nbeing Mohammedans, and therefore brothers of Ali, were to be treated as\r\nfriends and retain their lives and property. On these conditions a\r\nquarter of the town; was to be occupied by the victorious troops.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal chiefs, Saleh Bey, and his wife, foreseeing the\r\nfate which awaited their friends, committed suicide at the moment when,\r\nin pursuance of the treaty, Ali’s soldiers took possession of the\r\nquarter assigned to them.\r\n\r\nAli received the seventy-two beys with all marks of friendship when they\r\narrived at Janina. He lodged them in a palace on the lake, and treated\r\nthem magnificently for some days. But soon, having contrived on some\r\npretext to disarm them, he had them conveyed, loaded with chains, to a\r\nGreek convent on an island in the lake, which was converted into a\r\nprison. The day of vengeance not having fully arrived, he explained this\r\nbreach of faith by declaring that the hostages had attempted to escape.\r\n\r\nThe popular credulity was satisfied by this explanation, and no one\r\ndoubted the good faith of the pacha when he announced that he was going\r\nto Kardiki to establish a police and fulfil the promises he had made to\r\nthe inhabitants. Even the number of soldiers he took excited no\r\nsurprise, as Ali was accustomed to travel with a very numerous suite.\r\n\r\nAfter three days’ journey, he stopped at Libokhovo, where his sister had\r\nresided since the death of Aden Bey, her second son, cut off recently by\r\nwickness. What passed in the long interview they had no one knew, but it\r\nwas observed that Chainitza’s tears, which till then had flowed\r\nincessantly, stopped as if by magic, and her women, who were wearing\r\nmourning, received an order to attire themselves as for a festival.\r\nFeasting and dancing, begun in Ali’s honour, did not cease after his\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nHe spent the night at Chenderia, a castle built on a rock, whence the\r\ntown of Kardiki was plainly visible. Next day at daybreak Ali despatched\r\nan usher to summon all the male inhabitants of Kardiki to appear before\r\nChenderia, in order to receive assurances of the pacha’s pardon and\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\nThe Kardikiotes at once divined that this injunction was the precursor\r\nof a terrible vengeance: the whole town echoed with cries and groans,\r\nthe mosques were filled with people praying for deliverance. The\r\nappointed time arrived, they embraced each other as if parting for ever,\r\nand then the men, unarmed, in number six hundred and seventy, started\r\nfor Chenderia. At the gate of the town they encountered a troop of\r\nAlbanians, who followed as if to escort them, and which increased in\r\nnumber as they proceeded. Soon they arrived in the dread presence of Ali\r\nPacha. Grouped in formidable masses around him stood several thousand of\r\nhis fierce soldiery.\r\n\r\nThe unhappy Kardikiotes realised their utter helplessness, and saw that\r\nthey, their wives and children, were completely at the mercy of their\r\nimplacable enemy. They fell prostrate before the pacha, and with all the\r\nfervour which the utmost terror could inspire, implored him to grant\r\nthem a generous pardon.\r\n\r\nAli for some time silently enjoyed the pleasure of seeing his ancient\r\nenemies lying before him prostrate in the dust. He then desired them to\r\nrise, reassured them, called them brothers, sons, friends of his heart.\r\nDistinguishing some of his old acquaintances, he called them to him,\r\nspoke familiarly of the days of their youth, of their games, their early\r\nfriendships, and pointing to the young men, said, with tears in his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\"The discord which has divided us for so many years has allowed children\r\nnot born at the time of our dissension to grow into men. I have lost the\r\npleasure of watching the development of the off-spring of my neighbours\r\nand the early friends of my youth, and of bestowing benefits on them,\r\nbut I hope shortly to repair the natural results of our melancholy\r\ndivisions.\"\r\n\r\nHe then made them splendid promises, and ordered them to assemble in a\r\nneighbouring caravanserai, where he wished to give them a banquet in\r\nproof of reconciliation. Passing from the depths of despair to\r\ntransports of joy, the Kardikiotes repaired gaily to the caravanserai,\r\nheaping blessings on the pacha, and blaming each other for having ever\r\ndoubted his good faith.\r\n\r\nAli was carried down from Chenderia in a litter, attended by his\r\ncourtiers, who celebrated his clemency in pompous speeches, to which he\r\nreplied with gracious smiles. At the foot of the steep descent he\r\nmounted his horse, and, followed by his troops, rode towards the\r\ncaravanserai. Alone, and in silence, he rode twice round it, then,\r\nreturning to the gate, which had just been closed by his order, he\r\npulled up his horse, and, signing to his own bodyguard to attack the\r\nbuilding, \"Slay them!\" he cried in a voice of thunder.\r\n\r\nThe guards remained motionless in surprise and horror, then as the\r\npacha, with a roar, repeated his order, they indignantly flung down\r\ntheir arms. In vain he harangued, flattered, or threatened them; some\r\npreserved a sullen silence, others ventured to demand mercy. Then he\r\nordered them away, and, calling on the Christian Mirdites who served\r\nunder his banner.\r\n\r\n\"To you, brave Latins,\" he cried, \"I will now entrust the duty of\r\nexterminating the foes of my race. Avenge me, and I will reward you\r\nmagnificently.\"\r\n\r\nA confused murmur rose from the ranks. Ali imagined they were consulting\r\nas to what recompense should be required as the price of such deed.\r\n\r\n\"Speak,\" said he; \"I am ready to listen to your demands and to satisfy\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nThen the Mirdite leader came forward and threw back the hood of his\r\nblack cloak.\r\n\r\n\"O Pacha!\" said he, looking Ali boldly in the face, \"thy words are an\r\ninsult; the Mirdites do not slaughter unarmed prisoners in cold blood.\r\nRelease the Kardikiotes, give them arms, and we will fight them to the\r\ndeath; but we serve thee as soldiers and not as executioners.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words; which the black-cloaked battalion received with\r\napplause, Ali thought himself betrayed, and looked around with doubt and\r\nmistrust. Fear was nearly taking the place of mercy, words of pardon\r\nwere on his lips, when a certain Athanasius Vaya, a Greek schismatic,\r\nand a favourite of the pacha’s, whose illegitimate son he was supposed\r\nto be, advanced at the head of the scum of the army, and offered to\r\ncarry out the death sentence. Ali applauded his zeal, gave him full\r\nauthority to act, and spurred his horse to the top of a neighbouring\r\nhill, the better to enjoy the spectacle. The Christian Mirdites and the\r\nMohammedan guards knelt together to pray for the miserable Kardikiotes,\r\nwhose last hour had come.\r\n\r\nThe caravanserai where they were shut in was square enclosure, open to\r\nthe sky, and intended to shelter herds of buffaloes. The prisoners\r\nhaving heard nothing of what passed outside, were astonished to behold\r\nAthanasius Vaya and his troop appearing on the top of the wall. They did\r\nnot long remain in doubt. Ali gave the signal by a pistol-shot, and a\r\ngeneral fusillade followed. Terrible cries echoed from the court; the\r\nprisoners, terrified, wounded, crowded one upon another for shelter.\r\nSome ran frantically hither and thither in this enclosure with no\r\nshelter and no exit, until they fell, struck down by bullets. Some tried\r\nto climb the walls, in hope of either escape or vengeance, only to be\r\nflung back by either scimitars or muskets. It was a terrible scene of\r\ndespair and death.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour of firing, a gloomy silence descended on the place, now\r\noccupied solely by a heap of corpses. Ali forbade any burial rites on\r\npain of death, and placed over the gate an inscription in letters of\r\ngold, informing posterity that six hundred Kardikiotes had there been\r\nsacrificed to the memory of his mother Kamco.\r\n\r\nWhen the shrieks of death ceased in the enclosure, they began to be\r\nheard in the town. The assassins spread themselves through it, and\r\nhaving violated the women and children, gathered them into a crowd to be\r\ndriven to Libokovo. At every halt in this frightful journey fresh\r\nmarauders fell on the wretched victims, claiming their share in cruelty\r\nand debauchery. At length they arrived at their destination, where the\r\ntriumphant and implacable Chainitza awaited them. As after the taking of\r\nKormovo, she compelled the women to cut off their hair and to stuff with\r\nit a mattress on which she lay. She then stripped them, and joyfully\r\nnarrated to them the massacre of their husbands, fathers, brothers and\r\nsons, and when she had sufficiently enjoyed their misery they were again\r\nhanded over to the insults of the soldiery. Chainitza finally published\r\nan edict forbidding either clothes, shelter, or food to be given to the\r\nwomen and children of Kardiki, who were then driven forth into the woods\r\neither to die of hunger or to be devoured by wild beasts. As to the\r\nseventy-two hostages, Ali put them all to death when he returned to\r\nJanina. His vengeance was indeed complete.\r\n\r\nBut as, filled with a horrible satisfaction, the pacha was enjoying the\r\nrepose of a satiated tiger, an indignant and threatening voice reached\r\nhim even in the recesses of his palace. The Sheik Yussuf, governor of\r\nthe castle of Janina, venerated as a saint by the Mohammedans on account\r\nof his piety, and universally beloved and respected for his many\r\nvirtues, entered Ali’s sumptuous dwelling for the first time. The guards\r\non beholding him remained stupefied and motionless, then the most devout\r\nprostrated themselves, while others went to inform the pacha; but no one\r\ndared hinder the venerable man, who walked calmly and solemnly through\r\nthe astonished attendants. For him there existed no antechamber, no\r\ndelay; disdaining the ordinary forms of etiquette, he paced slowly\r\nthrough the various apartments, until, with no usher to announce him, he\r\nreached that of Ali. The latter, whose impiety by no means saved him\r\nfrom superstitious terrors, rose hastily from the divan and advanced to\r\nmeet the holy sheik, who was followed by a crowd of silent courtiers.\r\nAli addressed him with the utmost respect, and endeavoured even to kiss\r\nhis right hand. Yussuf hastily withdrew it, covered it with his mantle,\r\nand signed to the pacha to seat himself. Ali mechanically obeyed, and\r\nwaited in solemn silence to hear the reason of this unexpected visit.\r\n\r\nYussuf desired him to listen with all attention, and then reproached him\r\nfor his injustice and rapine, his treachery and cruelty, with such vivid\r\neloquence that his hearers dissolved in tears. Ali, though much\r\ndejected, alone preserved his equanimity, until at length the sheik\r\naccused him of having caused the death of Emineh. He then grew pale, and\r\nrising, cried with terror:\r\n\r\n\"Alas! my father, whose name do you now pronounce? Pray for me, or at\r\nleast do not sink me to Gehenna with your curses!\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no need to curse thee,\" answered Yussuf. \"Thine own crimes\r\nbear witness against thee. Allah has heard their cry. He will summon\r\nthee, judge thee, and punish thee eternally. Tremble, for the time is at\r\nhand! Thine hour is coming—is coming—is coming!\"\r\n\r\nCasting a terrible glance at the pacha, the holy man turned his back on\r\nhim, and stalked out of the apartment without another word.\r\n\r\nAli, in terror, demanded a thousand pieces of gold, put them in a white\r\nsatin purse, and himself hastened with them to overtake the sheik,\r\nimploring him to recall his threats. But Yussuf deigned no answer, and\r\narrived at the threshold of the palace, shook off the dust of his feet\r\nagainst it.\r\n\r\nAli returned to his apartment sad and downcast, and many days elapsed\r\nbefore he could shake off the depression caused by this scene. But soon\r\nhe felt more ashamed of his inaction than of the reproaches which had\r\ncaused it, and on the first opportunity resumed his usual mode of life.\r\n\r\nThe occasion was the marriage of Moustai, Pacha of Scodra, with the\r\neldest daughter of Veli Pacha, called the Princess of Aulis, because she\r\nhad for dowry whole villages in that district. Immediately after the\r\nannouncement of this marriage Ali set on foot a sort of saturnalia,\r\nabout the details of which there seemed to be as much mystery as if he\r\nhad been preparing an assassination.\r\n\r\nAll at once, as if by a sudden inundation, the very scum of the earth\r\nappeared to spread over Janina. The populace, as if trying to drown\r\ntheir misery, plunged into a drunkenness which simulated pleasure.\r\nDisorderly bands of mountebanks from the depths of Roumelia traversed\r\nthe streets, the bazaars and public places; flocks and herds, with\r\nfleeces dyed scarlet, and gilded horns, were seen on all the roads\r\ndriven to the court by peasants under the guidance of their priests.\r\nBishops, abbots, ecclesiastics generally, were compelled to drink, and\r\nto take part in ridiculous and indecent dances, Ali apparently thinking\r\nto raise himself by degrading his more respectable subjects. Day and\r\nnight these spectacles succeeded each other with increasing rapidity,\r\nthe air resounded with firing, songs, cries, music, and the roaring of\r\nwild beasts in shows. Enormous spits, loaded with meat, smoked before\r\nhuge braziers, and wine ran in floods at tables prepared in the palace\r\ncourts. Troops of brutal soldiers drove workmen from their labour with\r\nwhips, and compelled them to join in the entertainments; dirty and\r\nimpudent jugglers invaded private houses, and pretending that they had\r\norders from the pacha to display their skill, carried boldly off\r\nwhatever they could lay their hands upon. Ali saw the general\r\ndemoralization with pleasure, especially as it tended to the\r\ngratification of his avarice, Every guest was expected to bring to the\r\npalace gate a gift in proportion to his means, and foot officers watched\r\nto see that no one forgot this obligation. At length, on the nineteenth\r\nday, Ali resolved to crown the feast by an orgy worthy of himself. He\r\ncaused the galleries and halls of his castle by the lake to be decorated\r\nwith unheard-of splendour, and fifteen hundred guests assembled for a\r\nsolemn banquet. The pacha appeared in all his glory, surrounded by his\r\nnoble attendants and courtiers, and seating himself on a dais raised\r\nabove this base crowd which trembled at his glance, gave the signal to\r\nbegin. At his voice, vice plunged into its most shameless diversions,\r\nand the wine-steeped wings of debauchery outspread themselves over the\r\nfeast. All tongues were at their freest, all imaginations ran wild, all\r\nevil passions were at their height, when suddenly the noise ceased, and\r\nthe guests clung together in terror. A man stood at the entrance of the\r\nhall, pale, disordered, and wild-eyed, clothed in torn and blood-stained\r\ngarments. As everyone made way at his approach, he easily reached the\r\npacha, and prostrating himself at his feet, presented a letter. Ali\r\nopened and rapidly perused it; his lips trembled, his eyebrows met in a\r\nterrible frown, the muscles of his forehead contracted alarmingly. He\r\nvainly endeavoured to smile and to look as if nothing had happened, his\r\nagitation betrayed him, and he was obliged to retire, after desiring a\r\nherald to announce that he wished the banquet to continue.\r\n\r\nNow for the subject of the message, and the cause of the dismay it\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nAli had long cherished a violent passion for Zobeide, the wife of his\r\nson Veli Pacha: Having vainly attempted to gratify it after his son’s\r\ndeparture, and being indignantly repulsed, he had recourse to drugs, and\r\nthe unhappy Zobeide remained in ignorance of her misfortune until she\r\nfound she was pregnant. Then, half-avowals from her women, compelled to\r\nobey the pacha from fear of death, mixed with confused memories of her\r\nown, revealed the whole terrible truth. Not knowing in her despair which\r\nway to turn, she wrote to Ali, entreating him to visit the harem. As\r\nhead of the family, he had a right to enter, being supposed responsible\r\nfor the conduct of his sons’ families, no-law-giver having hitherto\r\ncontemplated the possibility of so disgraceful a crime. When he\r\nappeared, Zobeide flung herself at his feet, speechless with grief. Ali\r\nacknowledged his guilt, pleaded the violence of his passion, wept with\r\nhis victim, and entreating her to control herself and keep silence,\r\npromised that all should be made right. Neither the prayers nor tears of\r\nZobeide could induce him to give up the intention of effacing the traces\r\nof his first crime by a second even more horrible.\r\n\r\nBut the story was already whispered abroad, and Pacho Bey learnt all its\r\ndetails from the spies he kept in Janina. Delighted at the prospect of\r\navenging himself on the father, he hastened with his news to the son.\r\nVeli Pacha, furious, vowed vengeance, and demanded Pacho Bey’s help,\r\nwhich was readily promised. But Ali had been warned, and was not a man\r\nto be taken unawares. Pacho Bey, whom Veli had just promoted to the\r\noffice of sword-bearer, was attacked in broad daylight by six emissaries\r\nsent from Janina. He obtained timely help, however, and five of the\r\nassassins, taken red-handed, were at once hung without ceremony in the\r\nmarket-place. The sixth was the messenger whose arrival with the news\r\nhad caused such dismay at Ali’s banquet.\r\n\r\nAs Ali reflected how the storm he had raised could best be laid, he was\r\ninformed that the ruler of the marriage feast sent by Moustai, Pacha of\r\nScodra, to receive the young bride who should reign in his harem, had\r\njust arrived in the plain of Janina. He was Yussuf Bey of the Delres, an\r\nold enemy of Ali’s, and had encamped with his escort of eight hundred\r\nwarriors at the foot of Tomoros of Dodona. Dreading some treachery, he\r\nabsolutely refused all entreaties to enter the town, and Ali seeing that\r\nit was useless to insist, and that his adversary for the present was\r\nsafe, at once sent his grand-daughter, the Princess of Aulis, out to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThis matter disposed of, Ali was able to attend to his hideous family\r\ntragedy. He began by effecting the disappearance of the women whom he\r\nhad been compelled to make his accomplices; they were simply sewn up in\r\nsacks by gipsies and thrown into the lake. This done, he himself led the\r\nexecutioners into a subterranean part of the castle, where they were\r\nbeheaded by black mutes as a reward for their obedience. He then sent a\r\ndoctor to Zobeide; who succeeded in causing a miscarriage, and who, his\r\nwork done, was seized and strangled by the black mutes who had just\r\nbeheaded the gipsies. Having thus got rid of all who could bear witness\r\nto his crime, he wrote to Veli that he might now send for his wife and\r\ntwo of his children, hitherto detained as hostages, and that the\r\ninnocence of Zobeide would confound a calumniator who had dared to\r\nassail him with such injurious suspicions.\r\n\r\nWhen this letter arrived, Pacho Bey, distrusting equally the treachery\r\nof the father and the weakness of the son, and content with having sown\r\nthe seeds of dissension in his enemy’s family, had sufficient wisdom to\r\nseek safety in flight. Ali, furious, vowed, on hearing this, that his\r\nvengeance should overtake him even at the ends of the earth. Meanwhile\r\nhe fell back on Yussuf Bey of the Debres, whose escape when lately at\r\nJanina still rankled in his mind. As Yussuf was dangerous both from\r\ncharacter and influence, Ali feared to attack him openly, and sought to\r\nassassinate him. This was not precisely easy; for, exposed to a thousand\r\ndangers of this kind, the nobles of that day were on their guard. Steel\r\nand poison were used up, and another way had to be sought. Ali found it.\r\n\r\nOne of the many adventurers with whom Janina was filled penetrated to\r\nthe pacha’s presence, and offered to sell the secret of a powder whereof\r\nthree grains would suffice to kill a man with a terrible\r\nexplosion—explosive powder, in short. Ali heard with delight, but\r\nreplied that he must see it in action before purchasing.\r\n\r\nIn the dungeons of the castle by the lake, a poor monk of the order of\r\nSt. Basil was slowly dying, for having boldly refused a sacrilegious\r\nsimony proposed to him by Ali. He was a fit subject for the experiment,\r\nand was successfully blown to pieces, to the great satisfaction of Ali,\r\nwho concluded his bargain, and hastened to make use of it. He prepared a\r\nfalse firman, which, according to custom, was enclosed and sealed in a\r\ncylindrical case, and sent to Yussuf Bey by a Greek, wholly ignorant of\r\nthe real object of his mission. Opening it without suspicion, Yussuf had\r\nhis arm blown off, and died in consequence, but found time to despatch a\r\nmessage to Moustai Pacha of Scodra, informing him of the catastrophe,\r\nand warning him to keep good guard.\r\n\r\nYussuf’s letter was received by Moustai just as a similar infernal\r\nmachine was placed in his hands under cover to his young wife. The\r\npacket was seized, and a careful examination disclosed its nature. The\r\nmother of Moustai, a jealous and cruel woman, accused her\r\ndaughter-in-law of complicity, and the unfortunate Ayesha, though\r\nshortly to become a mother, expired in agony from the effects of poison,\r\nonly guilty of being the innocent instrument of her grandfather’s\r\ntreachery.\r\n\r\nFortune having frustrated Ali’s schemes concerning Moustai Pacha,\r\noffered him as consolation a chance of invading the territory of Parga,\r\nthe only place in Epirus which had hitherto escaped his rule, and which\r\nhe greedily coveted. Agia, a small Christian town on the coast, had\r\nrebelled against him and allied itself to Parga. It provided an excuse\r\nfor hostilities, and Ali’s troops, under his son Mouktar, first seized\r\nAgia, where they only found a few old men to massacre, and then marched\r\non Parga, where the rebels had taken refuge. After a few skirmishes,\r\nMouktar entered the town, and though the Parganiotes fought bravely,\r\nthey must inevitably have surrendered had they been left to themselves.\r\nBut they had sought protection from the French, who had garrisoned the\r\ncitadel, and the French grenadiers descending rapidly from the height,\r\ncharged the Turks with so much fury that they fled in all directions,\r\nleaving on the field four \"bimbashis,\" or captains of a thousand, and a\r\nconsiderable number of killed and wounded.\r\n\r\nThe pacha’s fleet succeeded no better than his army. Issuing from the\r\nGulf of Ambracia, it was intended to attack Parga from the sea, joining\r\nin the massacre, and cutting off all hope of escape from that side, Ali\r\nmeaning to spare neither the garrison nor any male inhabitants over\r\ntwelve years of age. But a few shots fired from a small fort dispersed\r\nthe ships, and a barque manned by sailors from Paxos pursued them, a\r\nshot from which killed Ali’s admiral on his quarter-deck. He was a Greek\r\nof Galaxidi, Athanasius Macrys by name.\r\n\r\nFilled with anxiety, Ali awaited news at Prevesa, where a courier, sent\r\noff at the beginning of the action, had brought him oranges gathered in\r\nthe orchards of Parga. Ali gave him a purse of gold, and publicly\r\nproclaimed his success. His joy was redoubled when a second messenger\r\npresented two heads of French soldiers, and announced that his troops\r\nwere in possession of the lower part of Parga. Without further delay he\r\nordered his attendants to mount, entered his carriage, and started\r\ntriumphantly on the Roman road to Nicopolis. He sent messengers to his\r\ngenerals, ordering them to spare the women and children of Parga,\r\nintended for his harem, and above all to take strict charge of the\r\nplunder. He was approaching the arena of Nicopolis when a third Tartar\r\nmessenger informed him of the defeat of his army. Ali changed\r\ncountenance, and could scarcely articulate the order to return to\r\nPrevesa. Once in his palace, he gave way to such fury that all around\r\nhim trembled, demanding frequently if it could be true that his troops\r\nwere beaten. \"May your misfortune be upon us!\" his attendants answered,\r\nprostrating themselves. All at once, looking out on the calm blue sea\r\nwhich lay before his windows, he perceived his fleet doubling Cape\r\nPancrator and re-entering the Ambracian Gulf under full sail; it\r\nanchored close by the palace, and on hailing the leading ship a speaking\r\ntrumpet announced to Ali the death of his admiral, Athanasius Macrys.\r\n\r\n\"But Parga, Parga!\" cried Ali.\r\n\r\n\"May Allah grant the pacha long life! The Parganiotes have escaped the\r\nsword of His Highness.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the will of Allah!\" murmured the pacha; whose head sank upon his\r\nbreast in dejection.\r\n\r\nArms having failed, Ali, as usual, took refuge in plots and treachery,\r\nbut this time, instead of corrupting his enemies with gold, he sought to\r\nweaken them by division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe French commander Nicole, surnamed the \"Pilgrim,\" on account of a\r\njourney he had once made to Mecca, had spent six months at Janina with a\r\nbrigade of artillery which General Marmont, then commanding in the\r\nIllyrian provinces, had for a time placed at Ali’s disposal. The old\r\nofficer had acquired the esteem and friendship of the pacha, whose\r\nleisure he had often amused by stories of his campaigns and various\r\nadventures, and although it was now long since they had met, he still\r\nhad the reputation of being Ali’s friend. Ali prepared his plans\r\naccordingly. He wrote a letter to Colonel Nicole, apparently in\r\ncontinuation of a regular correspondence between them, in which he\r\nthanked the colonel for his continued affection, and besought him by\r\nvarious powerful motives to surrender Parga, of which he promised him\r\nthe governorship during the rest of his life. He took good care to\r\ncomplete his treason by allowing the letter to fall into the hands of\r\nthe chief ecclesiastics of Parga, who fell head-foremost into the trap.\r\nSeeing that the tone of the letter was in perfect accordance with the\r\nformer friendly relations between their French governor and the pacha,\r\nthey were convinced of the former’s treachery. But the result was not as\r\nAli had hoped: the Parganiotes resumed their former negotiations with\r\nthe English, preferring to place their freedom in the hands of a\r\nChristian nation rather than to fall under the rule of a Mohammedan\r\nsatrap.... The English immediately sent a messenger to Colonel Nicole,\r\noffering honourable conditions of capitulation. The colonel returned a\r\ndecided refusal, and threatened to blow up the place if the inhabitants,\r\nwhose intentions he guessed, made the slightest hostile movement.\r\nHowever, a few days later, the citadel was taken at night, owing to the\r\ntreachery of a woman who admitted an English detachment; and the next\r\nday, to the general astonishment, the British standard floated over the\r\nAcropolis of Parga.\r\n\r\nAll Greece was then profoundly stirred by a faint gleam of the dawn of\r\nliberty, and shaken by a suppressed agitation. The Bourbons again\r\nreigned in France, and the Greeks built a thousand hopes on an event\r\nwhich changed the basis of the whole European policy. Above all, they\r\nreckoned on powerful assistance from Russia. But England had already\r\nbegun to dread anything which could increase either the possessions or\r\nthe influence of this formidable power. Above all, she was determined\r\nthat the Ottoman Empire should remain intact, and that the Greek navy,\r\nbeginning to be formidable, must be destroyed. With these objects in\r\nview, negotiations with Ali Pacha were resumed. The latter was still\r\nsmarting under his recent disappointment, and to all overtures answered\r\nonly, \"Parga! I must have Parga.\"—And the English were compelled to\r\nyield it!\r\n\r\nTrusting to the word of General Campbell, who had formally promised, on\r\nits surrender, that Parga should be classed along with the seven Ionian\r\nIsles; its grateful inhabitants were enjoying a delicious rest after the\r\nstorm, when a letter from the Lord High Commissioner, addressed to\r\nLieutenant-Colonel de Bosset, undeceived them, and gave warning of the\r\nevils which were to burst on the unhappy town.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of March, 1817, notwithstanding the solemn promise made to\r\nthe Parganiotes, when they admitted the British troops, that they should\r\nalways be on the same footing as the Ionian Isles, a treaty was signed\r\nat Constantinople by the British Plenipotentiary, which stipulated the\r\ncomplete and stipulated cession of Parga and all its territory to, the\r\nOttoman Empire. Soon there arrived at Janine Sir John Cartwright, the\r\nEnglish Consul at Patras, to arrange for the sale of the lands of the\r\nParganiotes and discuss the conditions of their emigration. Never before\r\nhad any such compact disgraced European diplomacy, accustomed hitherto\r\nto regard Turkish encroachments as simple sacrilege. But Ali Pacha\r\nfascinated the English agents, overwhelming them with favours, honours,\r\nand feasts, carefully watching them all the while. Their correspondence\r\nwas intercepted, and he endeavoured by means of his agents to rouse the\r\nParganiotes against them. The latter lamented bitterly, and appealed to\r\nChristian Europe, which remained deaf to their cries. In the name of\r\ntheir ancestors, they demanded the rights which had been guaranteed\r\nthem. \"They will buy our lands,\" they said; \"have we asked to sell them?\r\nAnd even if we received their value, can gold give us a country and the\r\ntombs of our ancestors?\"\r\n\r\nAli Pacha invited the Lord High Commissioner of Great Britain, Sir\r\nThomas Maitland, to a conference at Prevesa, and complained of the\r\nexorbitant price of 1,500,000, at which the commissioners had estimated\r\nParga and its territory, including private property and church\r\nfurniture. It had been hoped that Ali’s avarice would hesitate at this\r\nhigh price, but he was not so easily discouraged. He give a banquet for\r\nthe Lord High Commissioner, which degenerated into a shameless orgy. In\r\nthe midst of this drunken hilarity the Turk and the Englishman disposed\r\nof the territory of Parga; agreeing that a fresh estimate should be made\r\non the spot by experts chosen by both English and Turks. The result of\r\nthis valuation was that the indemnity granted to the Christians was\r\nreduced by the English to the sum of 276,075 sterling, instead of the\r\noriginal 500,000. And as Ali’s agents only arrived at the sum of 56,750,\r\na final conference was held at Buthrotum between Ali and the Lord High\r\nCommissioner. The latter then informed the Parganiotes that the\r\nindemnity allowed them was irrevocably fixed at 150,000! The transaction\r\nis a disgrace to the egotistical and venal nation which thus allowed the\r\nlife and liberty of a people to be trifled with, a lasting blot on the\r\nhonour of England!\r\n\r\nThe Parganiotes at first could believe neither in the infamy of their\r\nprotectors nor in their own misfortune; but both were soon confirmed by\r\na proclamation of the Lord High Commissioner, informing them that the\r\npacha’s army was marching to take possession of the territory which, by\r\nMay 10th, must be abandoned for ever.\r\n\r\nThe fields were then in full bearing. In the midst of plains ripening\r\nfor a rich harvest were 80,000 square feet of olive trees, alone\r\nestimated at two hundred thousand guineas. The sun shone in cloudless\r\nazure, the air was balmy with the scent of orange trees, of pomegranates\r\nand citrons. But the lovely country might have been inhabited by\r\nphantoms; only hands raised to heaven and brows bent to the dust met\r\none’s eye. Even the very dust belonged no more to the wretched\r\ninhabitants; they were forbidden to take a fruit or a flower, the\r\npriests might not remove either relics or sacred images. Church,\r\nornaments, torches, tapers, pyxes, had by this treaty all become\r\nMahommedan property. The English had sold everything, even to the Host!\r\nTwo days more, and all must be left. Each was silently marking the door\r\nof the dwelling destined so soon to shelter an enemy, with a red cross,\r\nwhen suddenly a terrible cry echoed from street to street, for the Turks\r\nhad been perceived on the heights overlooking the town. Terrified and\r\ndespairing, the whole population hastened to fall prostrate before the\r\nVirgin of Parga, the ancient guardian of their citadel. A mysterious\r\nvoice, proceeding from the sanctuary, reminded them that the English\r\nhad, in their iniquitous treaty, forgotten to include the ashes of those\r\nwhom a happier fate had spared the sight of the ruin of Parga. Instantly\r\nthey rushed to the graveyards, tore open the tombs, and collected the\r\nbones and putrefying corpses. The beautiful olive trees were felled, an\r\nenormous funeral pyre arose, and in the general excitement the orders of\r\nthe English chief were defied. With naked daggers in their hands,\r\nstanding in the crimson light of the flames which were consuming the\r\nbones of their ancestors, the people of Parga vowed to slay their wives\r\nand children, and to kill themselves to the last man, if the infidels\r\ndared to set foot in the town before the appointed hour. Xenocles, the\r\nlast of the Greek poets, inspired by this sublime manifestation of\r\ndespair, even as Jeremiah by the fall of Jerusalem, improvised a hymn\r\nwhich expresses all the grief of the exiles, and which the exiles\r\ninterrupted by their tears and sobs.\r\n\r\nA messenger, crossing the sea in all haste, informed the Lord High\r\nCommissioner of the terrible threat of the Parganiotes. He started at\r\nonce, accompanied by General Sir Frederic Adams, and landed at Parga by\r\nthe light of the funeral pyre. He was received with ill-concealed\r\nindignation, and with assurances that the sacrifice would be at once\r\nconsummated unless Ali’s troops were held back. The general endeavoured\r\nto console and to reassure the unhappy people, and then proceeded to the\r\noutposts, traversing silent streets in which armed men stood at each\r\ndoor only waiting a signal before slaying their families, and then\r\nturning their weapons against the English and themselves. He implored\r\nthem to have patience, and they answered by pointing to the approaching\r\nTurkish army and bidding him hasten. He arrived at last and commenced\r\nnegotiations, and the Turkish officers, no less uneasy than the English\r\ngarrison, promised to wait till the appointed hour. The next day passed\r\nin mournful silence, quiet as death, At sunset on the following day, May\r\n9, 1819, the English standard on the castle of Parga was hauled down,\r\nand after a night spent in prayer and weeping, the Christians demanded\r\nthe signal of departure.\r\n\r\nThey had left their dwellings at break of day, and scattering on the\r\nshore, endeavoured to collect some relics of their country. Some filled\r\nlittle bags with ashes withdrawn from the funeral pile; others took\r\nhandfuls of earth, while the women and children picked up pebbles which\r\nthey hid in their clothing and pressed to their bosoms, as if fearing to\r\nbe deprived of them. Meanwhile, the ships intended to transport them\r\narrived, and armed English soldiers superintended the embarkation, which\r\nthe Turks hailed from afar with, ferocious cries. The Parganiotes were\r\nlanded in Corfu, where they suffered yet more injustice. Under various\r\npretexts the money promised them was reduced and withheld, until\r\ndestitution compelled them to accept the little that was offered. Thus\r\nclosed one of the most odious transactions which modern history has been\r\ncompelled to record.\r\n\r\nThe satrap of Janina had arrived at the fulfilment of his wishes. In the\r\nretirement of his fairy-like palace by the lake he could enjoy\r\nvoluptuous pleasures to the full. But already seventy-eight years had\r\npassed over his head, and old age had laid the burden of infirmity upon\r\nhim. His dreams were dreams of blood, and vainly he sought refuge in\r\nchambers glittering with gold, adorned with arabesques, decorated with\r\ncostly armour and covered with the richest of Oriental carpets, remorse\r\nstood ever beside him. Through the magnificence which surrounded him\r\nthere constantly passed the gale spectre of Emineh, leading onwards a\r\nvast procession of mournful phantoms, and the guilty pasha buried his\r\nface in his hands and shrieked aloud for help. Sometimes, ashamed of his\r\nweakness, he endeavoured to defy both the reproaches of his conscience\r\nand the opinion of the multitude, and sought to encounter criticism with\r\nbravado. If, by chance, he overheard some blind singer chanting in the\r\nstreets the satirical verses which, faithful to the poetical and mocking\r\ngenius of their ancestors, the Greeks frequently composed about him, he\r\nwould order the singer to be brought, would bid him repeat his verses,\r\nand, applauding him, would relate some fresh anecdote of cruelty,\r\nsaying, \"Go, add that to thy tale; let thy hearers know what I can do;\r\nlet them understand that I stop at nothing in order to overcome my foes!\r\nIf I reproach myself with anything, it is only with the deeds I have\r\nsometimes failed to carry out.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes it was the terrors of the life after death which assailed him.\r\nThe thought of eternity brought terrible visions in its train, and Ali\r\nshuddered at the prospect of Al-Sirat, that awful bridge, narrow as a\r\nspider’s thread and hanging over the furnaces of Hell; which a Mussulman\r\nmust cross in order to arrive at the gate of Paradise. He ceased to joke\r\nabout Eblis, the Prince of Evil, and sank by degrees into profound\r\nsuperstition. He was surrounded by magicians and soothsayers; he\r\nconsulted omens, and demanded talismans and charms from the dervishes,\r\nwhich he had either sewn into his garments, or suspended in the most\r\nsecret parts of his palace, in order to avert evil influences. A Koran\r\nwas hung about his neck as a defence against the evil eye, and\r\nfrequently he removed it and knelt before it, as did Louis XI before the\r\nleaden figures of saints which adorned his hat. He ordered a complete\r\nchemical laboratory from Venice, and engaged alchemists to distill the\r\nwater of immortality, by the help of which he hoped to ascend to the\r\nplanets and discover the Philosopher’s Stone. Not perceiving any\r\npractical result of their labours, he ordered, the laboratory to be\r\nburnt and the alchemists to be hung.\r\n\r\nAli hated his fellow-men. He would have liked to leave no survivors, and\r\noften regretted his inability to destroy all those who would have cause\r\nto rejoice at his death, Consequently he sought to accomplish as much\r\nharm as he could during the time which remained to him, and for no\r\npossible reason but that of hatred, he caused the arrest of both Ibrahim\r\nPasha, who had already suffered so much at his hands, and his son, and\r\nconfined them both in a dungeon purposely constructed under the grand\r\nstaircase of the castle by the lake, in order that he might have the\r\npleasure of passing over their heads each time he left his apartments or\r\nreturned to them.\r\n\r\nIt was not enough for Ali merely to put to death those who displeased\r\nhim, the form of punishment must be constantly varied in order to\r\nproduce a fresh mode of suffering, therefore new tortures had to be\r\nconstantly invented. Now it was a servant, guilty of absence without\r\nleave, who was bound to a stake in the presence of his sister, and\r\ndestroyed by a cannon placed six paces off, but only loaded with powder,\r\nin order to prolong the agony; now, a Christian accused of having tried\r\nto blow up Janina by introducing mice with tinder fastened to their\r\ntails into the powder magazine, who was shut up in the cage of Ali’s\r\nfavourite tiger and devoured by it.\r\n\r\nThe pasha despised the human race as much as he hated it. A European\r\nhaving reproached him with the cruelty shown to his subjects, Ali\r\nreplied:—\r\n\r\n\"You do not understand the race with which I have to deal. Were I to\r\nhang a criminal on yonder tree, the sight would not deter even his own\r\nbrother from stealing in the crowd at its foot. If I had an old man\r\nburnt alive, his son would steal the ashes and sell them. The rabble can\r\nbe governed by fear only, and I am the one man who does it\r\nsuccessfully.\"\r\n\r\nHis conduct perfectly corresponded to his ideas. One great feast-day,\r\ntwo gipsies devoted their lives in order to avert the evil destiny of\r\nthe pasha; and, solemnly convoking on their own heads all misfortunes\r\nwhich might possibly befall him, cast themselves down from the palace\r\nroof. One arose with difficulty, stunned and suffering, the other\r\nremained on the ground with a broken leg. Ali gave them each forty\r\nfrancs and an annuity of two pounds of maize daily, and considering this\r\nsufficient, took no further trouble about them.\r\n\r\nEvery year, at Ramadan, a large sum was distributed in alms among poor\r\nwomen without distinction of sect. But Ali contrived to change this act\r\nof benevolence into a barbarous form of amusement.\r\n\r\nAs he possessed several palaces in Janina at a considerable distance\r\nfrom each other, the one at which a distribution was to take place was\r\neach day publicly announced, and when the women had waited there for an\r\nhour or two, exposed to sun, rain or cold, as the case might be, they\r\nwere suddenly informed that they must go to some other palace, at the\r\nopposite end of the town. When they got there, they usually had to wait\r\nfor another hour, fortunate if they were not sent off to a third place\r\nof meeting. When the time at length arrived, an eunuch appeared,\r\nfollowed by Albanian soldiers armed with staves, carrying a bag of\r\nmoney, which he threw by handfuls right into the midst of the assembly.\r\nThen began a terrible uproar. The women rushed to catch it, upsetting\r\neach other, quarreling, fighting, and uttering cries of terror and pain,\r\nwhile the Albanians, pretending to enforce order, pushed into the crowd,\r\nstriking right and left with their batons. The pacha meanwhile sat at a\r\nwindow enjoying the spectacle, and impartially applauding all well\r\ndelivered blows, no matter whence they came. During these distributions,\r\nwhich really benefitted no one, many women were always severely hurt,\r\nand some died from the blows they had received.\r\n\r\nAli maintained several carriages for himself and his family, but allowed\r\nno one else to share in this prerogative. To avoid being jolted, he\r\nsimply took up the pavement in Janina and the neighbouring towns, with\r\nthe result that in summer one was choked by dust, and in winter could\r\nhardly get through the mud. He rejoiced in the public inconvenience, and\r\none day having to go out in heavy rain, he remarked to one of the\r\nofficers of his escort, \"How delightful to be driven through this in a\r\ncarriage, while you will have the pleasure of following on horseback!\r\nYou will be wet and dirty, whilst I smoke my pipe and laugh at your\r\ncondition.\"\r\n\r\nHe could not understand why Western sovereigns should permit their\r\nsubjects to enjoy the same conveniences and amusements as themselves.\r\n\"If I had a theatre,\" he said, \"I would allow no one to be present at\r\nperformances except my own children; but these idiotic Christians do not\r\nknow how to uphold their own dignity.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no end to the mystifications which it amused the pacha to\r\ncarry out with those who approached him.\r\n\r\nOne day he chose to speak Turkish to a Maltese merchant who came to\r\ndisplay some jewels. He was informed that the merchant understood only\r\nGreek and Italian. He none the less continued his discourse without\r\nallowing anyone to translate what he said into Greek. The Maltese at\r\nlength lost patience, shut up his cases, and departed. Ali watched him\r\nwith the utmost calm, and as he went out told him, still in Turkish, to\r\ncome again the next day.\r\n\r\nAn unexpected occurrence seemed, like the warning finger of Destiny, to\r\nindicate an evil omen for the pacha’s future. \"Misfortunes arrive in\r\ntroops,\" says the forcible Turkish proverb, and a forerunner of\r\ndisasters came to Ali Pacha.\r\n\r\nOne morning he was suddenly roused by the Sheik Yussuf, who had forced\r\nhis way in, in spite of the guards. \"Behold!\" said he, handing Ali a\r\nletter, \"Allah, who punishes the guilty, has permitted thy seraglio of\r\nTepelen to be burnt. Thy splendid palace, thy beautiful furniture,\r\ncostly stuffs, cashmeers, furs, arms, all are destroyed! And it is thy\r\nyoungest and best beloved son, Salik Bey himself, whose hand kindled the\r\nflames!\" So saying; Yussuf turned and departed, crying with a triumphant\r\nvoice, \"Fire! fire! fire!\"\r\n\r\nAli instantly ordered his horse, and, followed by his guards, rode\r\nwithout drawing rein to Tepelen. As soon as he arrived at the place\r\nwhere his palace had formerly insulted the public misery, he hastened to\r\nexamine the cellars where his treasures were deposited. All was intact,\r\nsilver plate, jewels, and fifty millions of francs in gold, enclosed in\r\na well over which he had caused a tower to be built. After this\r\nexamination he ordered all the ashes to be carefully sifted in hopes of\r\nrecovering the gold in the tassels and fringes of the sofas, and the\r\nsilver from the plate and the armour. He next proclaimed through the\r\nlength and breadth of the land, that, being by the hand of Allah\r\ndeprived of his house, and no longer possessing anything in his native\r\ntown, he requested all who loved him to prove their affection by\r\nbringing help in proportion. He fixed the day of reception for each\r\ncommune, and for almost each individual of any rank, however small,\r\naccording to their distance from Tepelen, whither these evidences of\r\nloyalty were to be brought.\r\n\r\nDuring five days Ali received these forced benevolences from all parts.\r\nHe sat, covered with rags, on a shabby palm-leaf mat placed at the outer\r\ngate of his ruined palace, holding in his left hand a villainous pipe of\r\nthe kind used by the lowest people, and in his right an old red cap,\r\nwhich he extended for the donations of the passers-by. Behind stood a\r\nJew from Janina, charged with the office of testing each piece of gold\r\nand valuing jewels which were offered instead of money; for, in terror,\r\neach endeavoured to appear generous. No means of obtaining a rich\r\nharvest were neglected; for instance, Ali distributed secretly large\r\nsums among poor and obscure people, such as servants, mechanics, and\r\nsoldiers, in order that by returning them in public they might appear to\r\nbe making great sacrifices, so that richer and more distinguished\r\npersons could not, without appearing ill-disposed towards the pacha,\r\noffer only the same amount as did the poor, but were obliged to present\r\ngifts of enormous value.\r\n\r\nAfter this charity extorted from their fears, the pacha’s subjects hoped\r\nto be at peace. But a new decree proclaimed throughout Albania required\r\nthem to rebuild and refurnish the formidable palace of Tepelen entirely\r\nat the public expense. Ali then returned to Janina, followed by his\r\ntreasure and a few women who had escaped from the flames, and whom he\r\ndisposed of amongst his friends, saying that he was no longer\r\nsufficiently wealthy to maintain so many slaves.\r\n\r\nFate soon provided him with a second opportunity for amassing wealth.\r\nArta, a wealthy town with a Christian population, was ravaged by the\r\nplague, and out of eight thousand inhabitants, seven thousand were swept\r\naway. Hearing this, Ali hastened to send commissioners to prepare an\r\naccount of furniture and lands which the pacha claimed as being heir to\r\nhis subjects. A few livid and emaciated spectres were yet to be found in\r\nthe streets of Arta. In order that the inventory might be more complete,\r\nthese unhappy beings were compelled to wash in the Inachus blankets,\r\nsheets, and clothes steeped in bubonic infection, while the collectors\r\nwere hunting everywhere for imaginary hidden treasure. Hollow trees were\r\nsounded, walls pulled down, the most unlikely corners examined, and a\r\nskeleton which was discovered still girt with a belt containing Venetian\r\nsequins was gathered up with the utmost care. The archons of the town\r\nwere arrested and tortured in the hope of discovering buried treasure,\r\nthe clue to which had disappeared along with the owners. One of these\r\nmagistrates, accused of having hidden some valuable objects, was plunged\r\nup to his shoulders in a boiler full of melted lead and boiling oil. Old\r\nmen, women, children, rich and poor alike, were interrogated, beaten,\r\nand compelled to abandon the last remains of their property in order to\r\nsave their lives.\r\n\r\nHaving thus decimated the few inhabitants remaining to the town, it\r\nbecame necessary to repeople it. With this object in view, Ali’s\r\nemissaries overran the villages of Thessaly, driving before them all the\r\npeople they met in flocks, and compelling them to settle in Arta. These\r\nunfortunate colonists were also obliged to find money to pay the pacha\r\nfor the houses they were forced to occupy.\r\n\r\nThis business being settled, Ali turned to another which had long been\r\non his mind. We have seen how Ismail Pacho Bey escaped the assassins\r\nsent to murder him. A ship, despatched secretly from Prevesa, arrived at\r\nthe place of his retreat. The captain, posing as a merchant, invited\r\nIsmail to come on board and inspect his goods. But the latter, guessing\r\na trap, fled promptly, and for some time all trace of him was lost. Ali,\r\nin revenge, turned his wife out of the palace at Janina which she still\r\noccupied, and placed her in a cottage, where she was obliged to earn a\r\nliving by spinning. But he did not stop there, and learning after some\r\ntime that Pacho Bey had sought refuge with the Nazir of Drama, who had\r\ntaken him into favour, he resolved to strike a last blow, more sure and\r\nmore terrible than the others. Again Ismail’s lucky star saved him from\r\nthe plots of his enemy. During a hunting party he encountered a\r\nkapidgi-bachi, or messenger from the sultan, who asked him where he\r\ncould find the Nazir, to whom he was charged with an important\r\ncommunication. As kapidgi-bachis are frequently bearers of evil tidings,\r\nwhich it is well to ascertain at once, and as the Nazir was at some\r\ndistance, Pacho Bey assumed the latter’s part, and the sultan’s\r\nconfidential messenger informed him that he was the bearer of a firman\r\ngranted at the request of Ali Pacha of Janina.\r\n\r\n\"Ali of Tepelenir. He is my friend. How can I serve him?\"\r\n\r\n\"By executing the present order, sent you by the Divan, desiring you to\r\nbehead a traitor, named Pacho Bey, who crept into your service a short\r\ntime ago.\r\n\r\n\"Willingly! but he is not an easy man to seize being brave, vigorous,\r\nclever, and cunning. Craft will be necessary in this case. He may appear\r\nat any moment, and it is advisable that he should not see you. Let no\r\none suspect who you are, but go to Drama, which is only two hours\r\ndistant, and await me there. I shall return this evening, and you can\r\nconsider your errand as accomplished.\"\r\n\r\nThe kapidgi-bachi made a sign of comprehension, and directed his course\r\ntowards Drama; while Ismail, fearing that the Nazir, who had only known\r\nhim a short time, would sacrifice him with the usual Turkish\r\nindifference, fled in the opposite direction. At the end of an hour he\r\nencountered a Bulgarian monk, with whom he exchanged clothes—a disguise\r\nwhich enabled him to traverse Upper Macedonia in safety. Arriving at the\r\ngreat Servian convent in the mountains whence the Axius takes its rise,\r\nhe obtained admission under an assumed name. But feeling sure of the\r\ndiscretion of the monks, after a few days he explained his situation to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAli, learning the ill-success of his latest stratagem, accused the Nazir\r\nof conniving at Pacho Bey’s escape. But the latter easily justified\r\nhimself with the Divan by giving precise information of what had really\r\noccurred. This was what Ali wanted, who profited thereby in having the\r\nfugitive’s track followed up, and soon got wind of his retreat. As Pacho\r\nBey’s innocence had been proved in the explanations given to the Porte,\r\nthe death firman obtained against him became useless, and Ali affected\r\nto abandon him to his fate, in order the better to conceal the new plot\r\nhe was conceiving against him.\r\n\r\nAthanasius Vaya, chief assassin of the Kardikiotes, to whom Ali imparted\r\nhis present plan for the destruction of Ismail, begged for the honour of\r\nputting it into execution, swearing that this time Ismail should not\r\nescape. The master and the instrument disguised their scheme under the\r\nappearance of a quarrel, which astonished the whole town. At the end of\r\na terrible scene which took place in public, Ali drove the confidant of\r\nhis crimes from the palace, overwhelming him with insults, and declaring\r\nthat were Athanasius not the son of his children’s foster-mother, he\r\nwould have sent him to the gibbet. He enforced his words by the\r\napplication of a stick, and Vaya, apparently overwhelmed by terror and\r\naffliction, went round to all the nobles of the town, vainly entreating\r\nthem to intercede for him. The only favour which Mouktar Pacha could\r\nobtain for him was a sentence of exile allowing him to retreat to\r\nMacedonia.\r\n\r\nAthanasius departed from Janina with all the demonstrations of utter\r\ndespair, and continued his route with the haste of one who fears\r\npursuit. Arrived in Macedonia, he assumed the habit of a monk, and\r\nundertook a pilgrimage to Mount Athos, saying that both the disguise and\r\nthe journey were necessary to his safety. On the way he encountered one\r\nof the itinerant friars of the great Servian convent, to whom he\r\ndescribed his disgrace in energetic terms, begging him to obtain his\r\nadmission among the lay brethren of his monastery.\r\n\r\nDelighted at the prospect of bringing back to the fold of the Church a\r\nman so notorious for his crimes, the friar hastened to inform his\r\nsuperior, who in his turn lost no time in announcing to Pacho Bey that\r\nhis compatriot and companion in misfortune was to be received among the\r\nlay brethren, and in relating the history of Athanasius as he himself\r\nhad heard it. Pacho Bey, however, was not easily deceived, and at once\r\nguessing that Vaya’s real object was his own assassination, told his\r\ndoubts to the superior, who had already received him as a friend. The\r\nlatter retarded the reception of Vaya so as to give Pacho time to escape\r\nand take the road to Constantinople. Once arrived there, he determined\r\nto brave the storm and encounter Ali openly.\r\n\r\nEndowed by nature with a noble presence and with masculine firmness,\r\nPacho Bey possessed also the valuable gift of speaking all the various\r\ntongues of the Ottoman Empire. He could not fail to distinguish himself\r\nin the capital and to find an opening for his great talents. But his\r\ninclination drove him at first to seek his fellow-exiles from Epirus,\r\nwho were either his old companions in arms, friends, or relations, for\r\nhe was allied to all the principal families, and was even, through his\r\nwife, nearly connected with his enemy, Ali Pacha himself.\r\n\r\nHe had learnt what this unfortunate lady had already endured on his\r\naccount, and feared that she would suffer yet more if he took active\r\nmeasures against the pacha. While he yet hesitated between affection and\r\nrevenge, he heard that she had died of grief and misery. Now that\r\ndespair had put an end to uncertainty, he set his hand to the work.\r\n\r\nAt this precise moment Heaven sent him a friend to console and aid him\r\nin his vengeance, a Christian from OEtolia, Paleopoulo by name. This man\r\nwas on the point of establishing himself in Russian Bessarabia, when he\r\nmet Pacho Bey and joined with him in the singular coalition which was to\r\nchange the fate of the Tepelenian dynasty.\r\n\r\nPaleopoulo reminded his companion in misfortune of a memorial presented\r\nto the Divan in 1812, which had brought upon Ali a disgrace from which\r\nhe only escaped in consequence of the overwhelming political events\r\nwhich just then absorbed the attention of the Ottoman Government. The\r\nGrand Seigneur had sworn by the tombs of his ancestors to attend to the\r\nmatter as soon as he was able, and it was only requisite to remind him\r\nof his vow. Pacho Bey and his friend drew up a new memorial, and knowing\r\nthe sultan’s avarice, took care to dwell on the immense wealth possessed\r\nby Ali, on his scandalous exactions, and on the enormous sums diverted\r\nfrom the Imperial Treasury. By overhauling the accounts of his\r\nadministration, millions might be recovered. To these financial\r\nconsiderations Pacho Bey added some practical ones. Speaking as a man\r\nsure of his facts and well acquainted with the ground, he pledged his\r\nhead that with twenty thousand men he would, in spite of Ali’s troops\r\nand strongholds, arrive before Janina without firing a musket.\r\n\r\nHowever good these plans appeared, they were by no means to the taste of\r\nthe sultan’s ministers, who were each and all in receipt of large\r\npensions from the man at whom they struck. Besides, as in Turkey it is\r\ncustomary for the great fortunes of Government officials to be absorbed\r\non their death by the Imperial Treasury, it of course appeared easier to\r\nawait the natural inheritance of Ali’s treasures than to attempt to\r\nseize them by a war which would certainly absorb part of them.\r\nTherefore, while Pacho Bey’s zeal was commended, he obtained only\r\ndilatory answers, followed at length by a formal refusal.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the old OEtolian, Paleopoulo, died, having prophesied the\r\napproaching Greek insurrection among his friends, and pledged Pacho Bey\r\nto persevere in his plans of vengeance, assuring him that before long\r\nAli would certainly fall a victim to them. Thus left alone, Pacho,\r\nbefore taking any active steps in his work of vengeance, affected to\r\ngive himself up to the strictest observances of the Mohammedan religion.\r\nAli, who had established a most minute surveillance over his actions,\r\nfinding that his time was spent with ulemas and dervishes, imagined that\r\nhe had ceased to be dangerous, and took no further trouble about him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nA career of successful crime had established Ali’s rule over a\r\npopulation equal to that of the two kingdoms of Sweden and Norway. But\r\nhis ambition was not yet satisfied. The occupation of Parga did not\r\ncrown his desires, and the delight which it caused him was much tempered\r\nby the escape of the Parganiotes, who found in exile a safe refuge from\r\nhis persecution. Scarcely had he finished the conquest of Middle Albania\r\nbefore he was exciting a faction against the young Moustai Pacha in\r\nScodra, a new object of greed. He also kept an army of spies in\r\nWallachia, Moldavia, Thrace, and Macedonia, and, thanks to them, he\r\nappeared to be everywhere present, and was mixed up in every intrigue,\r\nprivate or political, throughout the empire. He had paid the English\r\nagents the price agreed on for Parga, but he repaid himself five times\r\nover, by gifts extorted from his vassals, and by the value of the Parga\r\nlands, now become his property. His palace of Tepelen had been rebuilt\r\nat the public expense, and was larger and more magnificent than before;\r\nJanina was embellished with new buildings; elegant pavilions rose on the\r\nshores of the lake; in short, Ali’s luxury was on a level with his vast\r\nriches. His sons and grandsons were provided for by important positions,\r\nand Ali himself was sovereign prince in everything but the name.\r\n\r\nThere was no lack of flattery, even from literary persons. At Vienna a\r\npoem was pointed in his honour, and a French-Greek Grammar was dedicated\r\nto him, and such titles as \"Most Illustrious,\" \"Most Powerful,\" and\r\n\"Most Clement,\" were showered upon him, as upon a man whose lofty\r\nvirtues and great exploits echoed through the world. A native of\r\nBergamo, learned in heraldry, provided him with a coat of arms,\r\nrepresenting, on a field gules, a lion, embracing three cubs, emblematic\r\nof the Tepelenian dynasty. Already he had a consul at Leucadia accepted\r\nby the English, who, it is said, encouraged him to declare himself\r\nhereditary Prince of Greece, under the nominal suzerainty of the sultan;\r\ntheir real intention being to use him as a tool in return for their\r\nprotection, and to employ him as a political counter-balance to the\r\nhospodars of Moldavia and Wallachia, who for the last twenty years had\r\nbeen simply Russian agents in disguise, This was not all; many of the\r\nadventurers with whom the Levant swarms, outlaws from every country, had\r\nfound a refuge in Albania, and helped not a little to excite Ali’s\r\nambition by their suggestions. Some of these men frequently saluted him\r\nas King, a title which he affected to reject with indignation; and he\r\ndisdained to imitate other states by raising a private standard of his\r\nown, preferring not to compromise his real power by puerile displays of\r\ndignity; and he lamented the foolish ambition of his children, who would\r\nruin him, he said, by aiming, each, at becoming a vizier. Therefore he\r\ndid not place his hope or confidence in them, but in the adventurers of\r\nevery sort and kind, pirates, coiners, renegades, assassins, whom he\r\nkept in his pay and regarded as his best support. These he sought to\r\nattach to his person as men who might some day be found useful, for he\r\ndid not allow the many favours of fortune to blind him to the real\r\ndanger of his position. A vizier,\" he was answered, \"resembles a man\r\nwrapped in costly furs, but he sits on a barrel of powder, which only\r\nrequires a spark to explode it.\" The Divan granted all the concessions\r\nwhich Ali demanded, affecting ignorance of his projects of revolt and\r\nhis intelligence with the enemies of the State; but then apparent\r\nweakness was merely prudent temporising. It was considered that Ali,\r\nalready advanced in years, could not live much longer, and it was hoped\r\nthat, at his death, Continental Greece, now in some measure detached\r\nfrom the Ottoman rule, would again fall under the sultan’s sway.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Pacho Bey, bent on silently undermining Ali’s influence; had\r\nestablished himself as an intermediary for all those who came to demand\r\njustice on account of the pacha’s exactions, and he contrived that both\r\nhis own complaints and those of his clients, should penetrate to the\r\nears of the sultan; who, pitying his misfortunes, made him a\r\nkapidgi-bachi, as a commencement of better things. About this time the\r\nsultan also admitted to the Council a certain Abdi Effendi of Larissa,\r\none of the richest nobles of Thessaly, who had been compelled by the\r\ntyranny of Veli Pacha to fly from his country. The two new dignitaries,\r\nhaving secured Khalid Effendi as a partisan, resolved to profit by his\r\ninfluence to carry out their plans of vengeance on the Tepelenian\r\nfamily. The news of Pacho Bey’s promotion roused Ali from the security\r\nin which he was plunged, and he fell a prey to the most lively anxiety.\r\nComprehending at once the evil which this man,—trained in his own\r\nschool, might cause him, he exclaimed, \"Ah! if Heaven would only restore\r\nme the strength of my youth, I would plunge my sword into his heart even\r\nin the midst of the Divan.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not long before Ali’s enemies found an extremely suitable\r\nopportunity for opening their attack. Veli Pacha, who had for his own\r\nprofit increased the Thessalian taxation fivefold, had in doing so\r\ncaused so much oppression that many of the inhabitants preferred the\r\ngriefs and dangers of emigration rather than remain under so tyrannical\r\na rule. A great number of Greeks sought refuge at Odessa, and the great\r\nTurkish families assembled round Pacho Bey and Abdi Effendi at\r\nConstantinople, who lost no opportunity of interceding in their favour.\r\nThe sultan, who as yet did not dare to act openly against the Tepelenian\r\nfamily, was at least able to relegate Veli to the obscure post of\r\nLepanto, and Veli, much disgusted, was obliged to obey. He quitted the\r\nnew palace he had just built at Rapehani, and betook himself to the\r\nplace of exile, accompanied by actors, Bohemian dancers, bear leaders,\r\nand a crowd of prostitutes.\r\n\r\nThus attacked in the person of his most powerful son, Ali thought to\r\nterrify his enemies by a daring blow. He sent three Albanians to\r\nConstantinople to assassinate Pacho Bey. They fell upon him as he was\r\nproceeding to the Mosque of Saint-Sophia, on the day on which the sultan\r\nalso went in order to be present at the Friday ceremonial prayer, and\r\nfired several shots at him. He was wounded, but not mortally.\r\n\r\nThe assassins, caught red-handed, were hung at the gate of the Imperial\r\nSeraglio, but not before confessing that they were sent by the Pacha of\r\nJanina. The Divan, comprehending at last that so dangerous a man must be\r\ndealt with at any cost, recapitulated all Ali’s crimes, and pronounced a\r\nsentence against him which was confirmed by a decree of the Grand Mufti.\r\nIt set forth that Ali Tepelen, having many times obtained pardon for his\r\ncrimes, was now guilty of high treason in the first degree, and that he\r\nwould, as recalcitrant, be placed under the ban of the Empire if he did\r\nnot within forty days appear at the Gilded Threshold of the Felicitous\r\nGate of the Monarch who dispenses crowns to the princes who reign in\r\nthis world, in order to justify himself. As may be supposed, submission\r\nto such an order was about the last thing Ali contemplated. As he failed\r\nto appear, the Divan caused the Grand Mufti to launch the thunder of\r\nexcommunication against him.\r\n\r\nAli had just arrived at Parga, which he now saw for the third time since\r\nhe had obtained it, when his secretaries informed him that only the rod\r\nof Moses could save him from the anger of Pharaoh—a figurative mode of\r\nwarning him that he had nothing to hope for. But Ali, counting on his\r\nusual luck, persisted in imagining that he could, once again, escape\r\nfrom his difficulty by the help of gold and intrigue. Without\r\ndiscontinuing the pleasures in which he was immersed, he contented\r\nhimself with sending presents and humble petitions to Constantinople.\r\nBut both were alike useless, for no one even ventured to transmit them\r\nto the sultan, who had sworn to cut off the head of anyone who dared\r\nmention the name of Ali Tepelen in his presence.\r\n\r\nReceiving no answer to his overtures, Ali became a prey to terrible\r\nanxiety. As he one day opened the Koran to consult it as to his future,\r\nhis divining rod stopped at verse 82, chap. xix., which says, \"He doth\r\nflatter himself in vain. He shall appear before our tribunal naked and\r\nbare.\" Ali closed the book and spat three times into his bosom. He was\r\nyielding to the most dire presentiments, when a courier, arriving from\r\nthe capital, informed him that all hope of pardon was lost.\r\n\r\nHe ordered his galley to be immediately prepared, and left his seraglio,\r\ncasting a look of sadness on the beautiful gardens where only yesterday\r\nhe had received the homage of his prostrate slaves. He bade farewell to\r\nhis wives, saying that he hoped soon to return, and descended to the\r\nshore, where the rowers received him with acclamations. The sail was set\r\nto a favourable breeze, and Ali, leaving the shore he was never to see\r\nagain, sailed towards Erevesa, where he hoped to meet the Lord High\r\nCommissioner Maitland. But the time of prosperity had gone by, and the\r\nregard which had once been shown him changed with his fortunes. The\r\ninterview he sought was not granted.\r\n\r\nThe sultan now ordered a fleet to be equipped, which, after Ramadan, was\r\nto disembark troops on the coast of Epirus, while all the neighbouring\r\npashas received orders to hold themselves in readiness to march with all\r\nthe troops of their respective Governments against Ali, whose name was\r\nstruck out of the list of viziers. Pacho Bey was named Pasha of Janina\r\nand Delvino on condition of subduing them, and was placed in command of\r\nthe whole expedition.\r\n\r\nHowever, notwithstanding these orders, there was not at the beginning of\r\nApril, two months after the attempted assassination of Pacho Bey, a\r\nsingle soldier ready to march on Albania. Ramadan, that year, did not\r\nclose until the new moon of July. Had Ali put himself boldly at the head\r\nof the movement which was beginning to stir throughout Greece, he might\r\nhave baffled these vacillating projects, and possibly dealt a fatal blow\r\nto the Ottoman Empire. As far back as 1808, the Hydriotes had offered to\r\nrecognise his son Veli, then Vizier of the Morea, as their Prince, and\r\nto support him in every way, if he would proclaim the independence of\r\nthe Archipelago. The Moreans bore him no enmity until he refused to help\r\nthem to freedom, and would have returned to him had he consented.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, the sultan, though anxious for war, would not spend a\r\npenny in order to wage it; and it was not easy to corrupt some of the\r\ngreat vassals ordered to march at their own expense against a man in\r\nwhose downfall they had no special interest. Nor were the means of\r\nseduction wanting to Ali, whose wealth was enormous; but he preferred to\r\nkeep it in order to carry on the war which he thought he could no longer\r\nescape. He made, therefore, a general appeal to all Albanian warriors,\r\nwhatever their religion. Mussulmans and Christians, alike attracted by\r\nthe prospect of booty and good pay, flocked to his standard in crowds.\r\n\r\nHe organised all these adventurers on the plan of the Armatous, by\r\ncompanies, placing a captain of his own choice at the head of each, and\r\ngiving each company a special post to defend. Of all possible plans this\r\nwas the best adapted to his country, where only a guerilla warfare can\r\nbe carried on, and where a large army could not subsist.\r\n\r\nIn repairing to the posts assigned to them, these troops committed such\r\nterrible depredations that the provinces sent to Constantinople\r\ndemanding their suppression. The Divan answered the petitioners that it\r\nwas their own business to suppress these disorders, and to induce the\r\nKlephotes to turn their arms against Ali, who had nothing to hope from\r\nthe clemency of the Grand Seigneur. At the same time circular letters\r\nwere addressed to the Epirotes, warning them to abandon the cause of a\r\nrebel, and to consider the best means of freeing themselves from a\r\ntraitor, who, having long oppressed them, now sought to draw down on\r\ntheir country all the terrors of war. Ali, who every where maintained\r\nnumerous and active spies, now redoubled his watchfulness, and not a\r\nsingle letter entered Epirus without being opened and read by his\r\nagents. As an extra precaution, the guardians of the passes were\r\nenjoined to slay without mercy any despatch-bearer not provided with an\r\norder signed by Ali himself; and to send to Janina under escort any\r\ntravellers wishing to enter Epirus. These measures were specially aimed\r\nagainst Suleyman Pacha, who had succeeded Veli in the government of\r\nThessaly, and replaced Ali himself in the office of Grand Provost of the\r\nHighways. Suleyman’s secretary was a Greek called Anagnorto, a native of\r\nMacedonia, whose estates Ali had seized, and who had fled with his\r\nfamily to escape further persecution. He had become attached to the\r\ncourt party, less for the sake of vengeance on Ali than to aid the cause\r\nof the Greeks, for whose freedom he worked by underhand methods. He\r\npersuaded Suleyman Pacha that the Greeks would help him to dethrone Ali,\r\nfor whom they cherished the deepest hatred, and he was determined that\r\nthey should learn the sentence of deprivation and excommunication\r\nfulminated against the rebel pacha. He introduced into the Greek\r\ntranslation which he was commissioned to make, ambiguous phrases which\r\nwere read by the Christians as a call to take up arms in the cause of\r\nliberty. In an instant, all Hellas was up in arms. The Mohammedans were\r\nalarmed, but the Greeks gave out that it was in order to protect\r\nthemselves and their property against the bands of brigands which had\r\nappeared on all sides. This was the beginning of the Greek insurrection,\r\nand occurred in May 1820, extending from Mount Pindus to Thermopylae.\r\nHowever, the Greeks, satisfied with having vindicated their right to\r\nbear arms in their own defence, continued to pay their taxes, and\r\nabstained from all hostility.\r\n\r\nAt the news of this great movement, Ali’s friends advised him to turn it\r\nto his own advantage. \"The Greeks in arms,\" said they, \"want a chief:\r\noffer yourself as their leader. They hate you, it is true, but this\r\nfeeling may change. It is only necessary to make them believe, which is\r\neasily done, that if they will support your cause you will embrace\r\nChristianity and give them freedom.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no time to lose, for matters became daily more serious. Ali\r\nhastened to summon what he called a Grand Divan, composed of the chiefs\r\nof both sects, Mussulmans and Christians. There were assembled men of\r\nwidely different types, much astonished at finding themselves in\r\ncompany: the venerable Gabriel, Archbishop of Janina, and uncle of the\r\nunfortunate Euphrosyne, who had been dragged thither by force; Abbas,\r\nthe old head of the police, who had presided at the execution of the\r\nChristian martyr; the holy bishop of Velas, still bearing the marks of\r\nthe chains with which Ali had loaded him; and Porphyro, Archbishop of\r\nArta, to whom the turban would have been more becoming than the mitre.\r\n\r\nAshamed of the part he was obliged to play, Ali, after long hesitation,\r\ndecided on speaking, and, addressing the Christians, \"O Greeks!\" he\r\nsaid, \"examine my conduct with unprejudiced minds, and you will see\r\nmanifest proofs of the confidence and consideration which I have ever\r\nshown you. What pacha has ever treated you as I have done? Who would\r\nhave treated your priests and the objects of your worship with as much\r\nrespect? Who else would have conceded the privileges which you enjoy?\r\nfor you hold rank in my councils, and both the police and the\r\nadministration of my States are in your hands. I do not, however, seek\r\nto deny the evils with which I have afflicted you; but, alas! these\r\nevils have been the result of my enforced obedience to the cruel and\r\nperfidious orders of the Sublime Porte. It is to the Porte that these\r\nwrongs must be attributed, for if my actions be attentively regarded it\r\nwill be seen that I only did harm when compelled thereto by the course\r\nof events. Interrogate my actions, they will speak more fully than a\r\ndetailed apology.\r\n\r\n\"My position with regard to the Suliotes allowed no half-and-half\r\nmeasures. Having once broken with them, I was obliged either to drive\r\nthem from my country or to exterminate them. I understood the political\r\nhatred of the Ottoman Cabinet too well not to know that it would declare\r\nwar against me sooner or later, and I knew that resistance would be\r\nimpossible, if on one side I had to repel the Ottoman aggression, and on\r\nthe other to fight against the formidable Suliotes.\r\n\r\n\"I might say the same of the Parganiotes. You know that their town was\r\nthe haunt of my enemies, and each time that I appealed to them to change\r\ntheir ways they answered only with insults and threats. They constantly\r\naided the Suliotes with whom I was at war; and if at this moment they\r\nstill were occupying Parga, you would see them throw open the gates of\r\nEpirus to the forces of the sultan. But all this does not prevent my\r\nbeing aware that my enemies blame me severely, and indeed I also blame\r\nmyself, and deplore the faults which the difficulty of my position has\r\nentailed upon me. Strong in my repentance, I do not hesitate to address\r\nmyself to those whom I have most grievously wounded. Thus I have long\r\nsince recalled to my service a great number of Suliotes, and those who\r\nhave responded to my invitation are occupying important posts near my\r\nperson. To complete the reconciliation, I have written to those who are\r\nstill in exile, desiring them to return fearlessly to their country, and\r\nI have certain information that this proposal has been everywhere\r\naccepted with enthusiasm. The Suliotes will soon return to their\r\nancestral houses, and, reunited under my standard, will join me in\r\ncombating the Osmanlis, our common enemies.\r\n\r\n\"As to the avarice of which I am accused, it seems easily justified by\r\nthe constant necessity I was under of satisfying the inordinate cupidity\r\nof the Ottoman ministry, which incessantly made me pay dearly for\r\ntranquillity. This was a personal affair, I acknowledge, and so also is\r\nthe accumulation of treasure made in order to support the war, which the\r\nDivan has at length declared.\"\r\n\r\nHere Ali ceased, then having caused a barrel full of gold pieces to be\r\nemptied on the floor, he continued:\r\n\r\n\"Behold a part of the treasure I have preserved with so much care, and\r\nwhich has been specially obtained from the Turks, our common enemies: it\r\nis yours. I am now more than ever delighted at being the friend of the\r\nGreeks. Their bravery is a sure earnest of victory, and we will shortly\r\nre-establish the Greek Empire, and drive the Osmanlis across the\r\nBosphorus. O bishops and priests of Issa the prophet! bless the arms of\r\nthe Christians, your children. O primates! I call upon you to defend\r\nyour rights, and to rule justly the brave nation associated with my\r\ninterests.\"\r\n\r\nThis discourse produced very different impressions on the Christian\r\npriests and archons. Some replied only by raising looks of despair to\r\nHeaven, others murmured their adhesion. A great number remained\r\nuncertain, not knowing what to decide. The Mirdite chief, he who had\r\nrefused to slaughter the Kardikiotes, declared that neither he nor any\r\nSkipetar of the Latin communion would bear arms against their legitimate\r\nsovereign the sultan. But his words were drowned by cries of \"Long live\r\nAli Pasha! Long live the restorer of liberty!\" uttered by some chiefs of\r\nadventurers and brigands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nYet next day, May 24th, 1820, Ali addressed a circular letter to his\r\nbrothers the Christians, announcing that in future he would consider\r\nthem as his most faithful subjects, and that henceforth he remitted the\r\ntaxes paid to his own family. He wound up by asking for soldiers, but\r\nthe Greeks having learnt the instability of his promises, remained deaf\r\nto his invitations. At the same time he sent messengers to the\r\nMontenegrins and the Servians, inciting them to revolt, and organised\r\ninsurrections in Wallachia and Moldavia to the very environs of\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\nWhilst the Ottoman vassals assembled only in small numbers and very\r\nslowly under their respective standards, every day there collected round\r\nthe castle of Janina whole companies of Toxidae, of Tapazetae, and of\r\nChamidae; so that Ali, knowing that Ismail Pacho Bey had boasted that he\r\ncould arrive in sight of Janina without firing a gun, said in his turn\r\nthat he would not treat with the Porte until he and his troops should be\r\nwithin eight leagues of Constantinople.\r\n\r\nHe had fortified and supplied with munitions of war Ochrida, Avlone,\r\nCannia, Berat, Cleisoura, Premiti, the port of Panormus, Santi-Quaranta,\r\nButhrotum, Delvino, Argyro-Castron, Tepelen, Parga, Prevesa, Sderli,\r\nParamythia, Arta, the post of the Five Wells, Janina and its castles.\r\nThese places contained four hundred and twenty cannons of all sizes, for\r\nthe most part in bronze, mounted on siege-carriages, and seventy\r\nmortars. Besides these, there were in the castle by the lake,\r\nindependently of the guns in position, forty field-pieces, sixty\r\nmountain guns, a number of Congreve rockets, formerly given him by the\r\nEnglish, and an enormous quantity of munitions of war. Finally, he\r\nendeavoured to establish a line of semaphores between Janina and\r\nPrevesa, in order to have prompt news of the Turkish fleet, which was\r\nexpected to appear on this coast.\r\n\r\nAli, whose strength seemed to increase with age, saw to everything and\r\nappeared everywhere; sometimes in a litter borne by his Albanians,\r\nsometimes in a carriage raised into a kind of platform, but it was more\r\nfrequently on horseback that he appeared among his labourers. Often he\r\nsat on the bastions in the midst of the batteries, and conversed\r\nfamiliarly with those who surrounded him. He narrated the successes\r\nformerly obtained against the sultan by Kara Bazaklia, Vizier of Scodra,\r\nwho, like himself, had been attained with the sentence of deprivation\r\nand excommunication; recounting how the rebel pacha, shut up in his\r\ncitadel with seventy-two warriors, had seen collapse at his feet the\r\nunited forces of four great provinces of the Ottoman Empire, commanded\r\nby twenty-two pachas, who were almost entirely annihilated in one day by\r\nthe Guegues. He reminded them also, of the brilliant victory gained by\r\nPassevend Oglon, Pacha of Widdin, of quite recent memory, which is\r\ncelebrated in the warlike songs of the Klephts of Roumelia.\r\n\r\nAlmost simultaneously, Ali’s sons, Mouktar and Veli, arrived at Janina.\r\nVeli had been obliged, or thought himself obliged, to evacuate Lepanto\r\nby superior forces, and brought only discouraging news, especially as to\r\nthe wavering fidelity of the Turks. Mouktar, on the contrary, who had\r\njust made a tour of inspection in the Musache, had only noticed\r\nfavourable dispositions, and deluded himself with the idea that the\r\nChaonians, who had taken up arms, had done so in order to aid his\r\nfather. He was curiously mistaken, for these tribes hated Ali with a\r\nhatred all the deeper for being compelled to conceal it, and were only\r\nin arms in order to repel aggression.\r\n\r\nThe advice given by the sons to their father as to the manner of\r\ntreating the Mohammedans differed widely in accordance with their\r\nrespective opinions. Consequently a violent quarrel arose between them,\r\nostensibly on account of this dispute, but in reality on the subject of\r\ntheir father’s inheritance, which both equally coveted. Ali had brought\r\nall his treasure to Janina, and thenceforth neither son would leave the\r\nneighbourhood of so excellent a father. They overwhelmed him with marks\r\nof affection, and vowed that the one had left Lepanto, and the other\r\nBerat, only in order to share his danger. Ali was by no means duped by\r\nthese protestations, of which he divined the motive only too well, and\r\nthough he had never loved his sons, he suffered cruelly in discovering\r\nthat he was not beloved by them.\r\n\r\nSoon he had other troubles to endure. One of his gunners assassinated a\r\nservant of Vela’s, and Ali ordered the murderer to be punished, but when\r\nthe sentence was to be carried out the whole corps of artillery\r\nmutinied. In order to save appearances, the pacha was compelled to allow\r\nthem to ask for the pardon of the criminal whom he dared not punish.\r\nThis incident showed him that his authority was no longer paramount, and\r\nhe began to doubt the fidelity of his soldiers. The arrival of the\r\nOttoman fleet further enlightened him to his true position. Mussulman\r\nand Christian alike, all the inhabitants of Northern Albania, who had\r\nhitherto concealed their disaffection under an exaggerated semblance of\r\ndevotion, now hastened to make their submission to the sultan. The\r\nTurks, continuing their success, laid siege to Parga, which was held by\r\nMehemet, Veli’s eldest son. He was prepared to make a good defence, but\r\nwas betrayed by his troops, who opened the gates of the town, and he was\r\ncompelled to surrender at discretion. He was handed over to the\r\ncommander of the naval forces, by whom he was well treated, being\r\nassigned the best cabin in the admiral’s ship and given a brilliant\r\nsuite. He was assured that the sultan, whose only quarrel was with his\r\ngrandfather, would show him favour, and would even deal mercifully with\r\nAli, who, with his treasures, would merely be sent to an important\r\nprovince in Asia Minor. He was induced to write in this strain to his\r\nfamily and friends in order to induce them to lay down their arms.\r\n\r\nThe fall of Parga made a great impression on the Epirotes, who valued\r\nits possession far above its real importance. Ali rent his garments and\r\ncursed the days of his former good fortune, during which he had neither\r\nknown how to moderate his resentment nor to foresee the possibility of\r\nany change of fortune.\r\n\r\nThe fall of Parga was succeeded by that of Arta of Mongliana, where was\r\nsituated Ali’s country house, and of the post of the Five Wells. Then\r\ncame a yet more overwhelming piece of news Omar Brionis, whom Ali,\r\nhaving formerly despoiled of its wealth, had none the less, recently\r\nappointed general-in-chief, had gone over to the enemy with all his\r\ntroops!\r\n\r\nAli then decided on carrying out a project he had formed in case of\r\nnecessity, namely, on destroying the town of Janina, which would afford\r\nshelter to the enemy and a point of attack against the fortresses in\r\nwhich he was entrenched. When this resolution was known, the inhabitants\r\nthought only of saving themselves and their property from the ruin from\r\nwhich nothing could save their country. But most of them were only\r\npreparing to depart, when Ali gave leave to the Albanian soldiers yet\r\nfaithful to him to sack the town.\r\n\r\nThe place was immediately invaded by an unbridled soldiery. The\r\nMetropolitan church, where Greeks and Turks alike deposited their gold,\r\njewels, and merchandise, even as did the Greeks of old in the temples of\r\nthe gods, became the first object of pillage. Nothing was respected. The\r\ncupboards containing sacred vestments were broken open, so were the\r\ntombs of the archbishops, in which were interred reliquaries adorned\r\nwith precious stones; and the altar itself was defiled with the blood of\r\nruffians who fought for chalices and silver crosses.\r\n\r\nThe town presented an equally terrible spectacle; neither Christians nor\r\nMussulmans were spared, and the women’s apartments, forcibly entered,\r\nwere given up to violence. Some of the more courageous citizens\r\nendeavoured to defend their houses and families against these bandits,\r\nand the clash of arms mingled with cries and groans. All at once the\r\nroar of a terrible explosion rose above the other sounds, and a hail of\r\nbombs, shells, grenade’s, and rockets carried devastation and fire into\r\nthe different quarters of the town, which soon presented the spectacle\r\nof an immense conflagration. Ali, seated on the great platform of the\r\ncastle by the lake, which seemed to vomit fire like a volcano, directed\r\nthe bombardment, pointing out the places which must be burnt. Churches,\r\nmosques, libraries, bazaars, houses, all were destroyed, and the only\r\nthing spared by the flames was the gallows, which remained standing in\r\nthe midst of the ruins.\r\n\r\nOf the thirty thousand persons who inhabited Janina a few hours\r\npreviously, perhaps one half had escaped. But these had not fled many\r\nleagues before they encountered the outposts of the Ottoman army,\r\nwhich, instead of helping or protecting them, fell upon them, plundered\r\nthem, and drove them towards the camp, where slavery awaited them. The\r\nunhappy fugitives, taken thus between fire and sword, death behind and\r\nslavery before, uttered a terrible cry, and fled in all directions.\r\nThose who escaped the Turks were stopped in the hill passes by the\r\nmountaineers rushing down to the rey; only large numbers who held\r\ntogether could force a passage.\r\n\r\nIn some cases terror bestows extraordinary strength, there were mothers\r\nwho, with infants at the breast, covered on foot in one day the fourteen\r\nleagues which separate Janina from Arta. But others, seized with the\r\npangs of travail in the midst of their flight, expired in the woods,\r\nafter giving birth to babes, who, destitute of succour, did not survive\r\ntheir mothers. And young girls, having disfigured themselves by gashes,\r\nhid themselves in caves, where they died of terror and hunger.\r\n\r\nThe Albanians, intoxicated with plunder and debauchery, refused to\r\nreturn to the castle, and only thought of regaining their country and\r\nenjoying the fruit of their rapine. But they were assailed on the way by\r\npeasants covetous of their booty, and by those of Janina who had sought\r\nrefuge with them. The roads and passes were strewn with corpses, and the\r\ntrees by the roadside converted into gibbets. The murderers did not long\r\nsurvive their victims.\r\n\r\nThe ruins of Janina were still smoking when, on the 19th August, Pacho\r\nBey made his entry. Having pitched his tent out of range of Ali’s\r\ncannon, he proclaimed aloud the firman which inaugurated him as Pacha of\r\nJanina and Delvino, and then raised the tails, emblem of his dignity.\r\nAli heard on the summit of his keep the acclamations of the Turks who\r\nsaluted Pacho Bey, his former servant with the titles of Vali of Epirus,\r\nand Ghazi, of Victorius. After this ceremony, the cadi read the\r\nsentence, confirmed by the Mufti, which declared Tepelen Veli-Zade to\r\nhave forfeited his dignities and to be excommunicated, adding an\r\ninjunction to all the faithful that henceforth his name was not to be\r\npronounced except with the addition of \"Kara,\" or \"black,\" which is\r\nbestowed on those cut off from the congregation of Sunnites, or Orthodox\r\nMohammedans. A Marabout then cast a stone towards the castle, and the\r\nanathema upon \"Kara Ali\" was repeated by the whole Turkish army, ending\r\nwith the cry of \"Long live the sultan! So be it!\"\r\n\r\nBut it was not by ecclesiastical thunders that three fortresses could be\r\nreduced, which were defended by artillerymen drawn from different\r\nEuropean armies, who had established an excellent school for gunners and\r\nbombardiers. The besieged, having replied with hootings of contempt to\r\nthe acclamations of the besiegers, proceeded to enforce their scorn with\r\nwell-aimed cannon shots, while the rebel flotilla, dressed as if for a\r\nfete-day, passed slowly before the Turks, saluting them with cannon-shot\r\nif they ventured near the edge of the lake.\r\n\r\nThis noisy rhodomontade did not prevent Ali from being consumed with\r\ngrief and anxiety. The sight of his own troops, now in the camp of Pacho\r\nBey, the fear of being for ever separated from his sons, the thought of\r\nhis grandson in the enemy’s hands, all threw him into the deepest\r\nmelancholy, and his sleepless eyes were constantly drowned in tears. He\r\nrefused his food, and sat for seven days with untrimmed beard, clad in\r\nmourning, on a mat at the door of his antechamber, extending his hands\r\nto his soldiers, and imploring them to slay him rather than abandon him.\r\nHis wives, seeing him in this state, and concluding all was lost, filled\r\nthe air with their lamentations. All began to think that grief would\r\nbring Ali to the grave; but his soldiers, to whose protestations he at\r\nfirst refused any credit, represented to him that their fate was\r\nindissolubly linked with his. Pacho Bey having proclaimed that all taken\r\nin arms for Ali would be shot as sharers in rebellion, it was therefore\r\ntheir interest to support his resistance with all their power. They also\r\npointed out that the campaign was already advanced, and that the Turkish\r\narmy, which had forgotten its siege artillery at Constantinople, could\r\nnot possibly procure any before the end of October, by which time the\r\nrains would begin, and the enemy would probably be short of food.\r\nMoreover, in any case, it being impossible to winter in a ruined town,\r\nthe foe would be driven to seek shelter at a distance.\r\n\r\nThese representations, made with warmth, conviction, and supported by\r\nevidence, began to soothe the restless fever which was wasting Ali, and\r\nthe gentle caresses and persuasions of Basillisa, the beautiful\r\nChristian captive, who had now been his wife for some time, completed\r\nthe cure.\r\n\r\nAt the same time his sister Chainitza gave him an astonishing example of\r\ncourage. She had persisted, in spite of all that could be said, in\r\nresiding in her castle of Libokovo. The population, whom she had cruelly\r\noppressed, demanded her death, but no one dared attack her. Superstition\r\ndeclared that the spirit of her mother, with whom she kept up a\r\nmysterious communication even beyond the portals of the grave, watched\r\nover her safety. The menacing form of Kamco had, it was said, appeared\r\nto several inhabitants of Tepelen, brandishing bones of the wretched\r\nKardikiotes, and demanding fresh victims with loud cries. The desire of\r\nvengeance had urged some to brave these unknown dangers, and twice, a\r\nwarrior, clothed in black, had warned them back, forbidding them to lay\r\nhands on a sacrilegious woman; whose punishment Heaven reserved to\r\nitself, and twice they had returned upon their footsteps.\r\n\r\nBut soon, ashamed of their terror, they attempted another attack, and\r\ncame attired in the colour of the Prophet. This time no mysterious\r\nstranger speared to forbid their passage and with a cry they climbed the\r\nmountain, listening for any supernatural warning. Nothing disturbed the\r\nsilence and solitude save the bleating of flocks and the cries of birds\r\nof prey. Arrived on the platform of Libokovo, they prepared in silence\r\nto surprise the guards, believing the castle full of them. They\r\napproached crawling, like hunters who stalk a deer, already they had\r\nreached the gate of the enclosure, and prepared to burst it open, when\r\nlo! it opened of itself, and they beheld Chainitza standing before them,\r\na carabine in her hand, pistols in her belt, and, for all guard, two\r\nlarge dogs.\r\n\r\n\"Halt! ye daring ones,\" she cried; \"neither my life nor my treasure will\r\never be at your mercy. Let one of you move a step without my permission,\r\nand this place and the ground beneath your feet’ will engulf you. Ten\r\nthousand pounds of powder are in these cellars. I will, however, grant\r\nyour pardon, unworthy though you are. I will even allow you to take\r\nthese sacks filled with gold; they may recompense you for the losses\r\nwhich my brother’s enemies have recently inflicted on you. But depart\r\nthis instant without a word, and dare not to trouble me again; I have\r\nother means of destruction at command besides gunpowder. Life is nothing\r\nto me, remember that; but your mountains may yet at my command become\r\nthe tomb of your wives and children. Go!\"\r\n\r\nShe ceased, and her would-be murderers fled terror.\r\n\r\nShortly after the plague broke out in these mountains, Chainitza had\r\ndistributed infected garments among gipsies, who scattered contagion\r\nwherever they went.\r\n\r\n\"We are indeed of the same blood!\" cried Ali with pride, when he heard\r\nof his sister’s conduct; and from that hour he appeared to regain all\r\nthe fire and audacity of his youth. When, a few days later, he was\r\ninformed that Mouktar and Veli, seduced by the brilliant promises of\r\nDacha Bey, had surrendered Prevesa and Argyro-Castron, \"It does not\r\nsurprise me,\" he observed coldly. \"I have long known them to be unworthy\r\nof being my sons, and henceforth my only children and heirs are those\r\nwho defend my cause.\" And on hearing a report that both had been\r\nbeheaded by Dacha Bey’s order, he contented himself with saying, \"They\r\nbetrayed their father, and have only received their deserts; speak no\r\nmore of them.\" And to show how little it discouraged him, he redoubled\r\nhis fire upon the Turks.\r\n\r\nBut the latter, who had at length obtained some artillery, answered his\r\nfire with vigour, and began to rally to discrown the old pacha’s\r\nfortress. Feeling that the danger was pressing, Ali redoubled both his\r\nprudence and activity. His immense treasures were the real reason of the\r\nwar waged against him, and these might induce his own soldiers to rebel,\r\nin order to become masters of them. He resolved to protect them from\r\neither surprise or conquest. The sum necessary for present use was\r\ndeposited in the powder magazine, so that, if driven to extremity, it\r\nmight be destroyed in a moment; the remainder was enclosed in\r\nstrong-boxes, and sunk in different parts of the lake. This labour\r\nlasted a fortnight, when, finally, Ali put to death the gipsies who had\r\nbeen employed about it, in order that the secret might remain with\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nWhile he thus set his own affairs in order, he applied himself to the\r\ntroubling those of his adversary. A great number of Suliots had joined\r\nthe Ottoman army in order to assist in the destruction of him who\r\nformerly had ruined their country. Their camp, which for a long time had\r\nenjoyed immunity from the guns of Janina, was one day overwhelmed with\r\nbombs. The Suliots were terrified, until they remarked that the bombs\r\ndid not burst. They then, much astonished, proceeded to pick up and\r\nexamine these projectiles. Instead of a match, they found rolls of paper\r\nenclosed in a wooden cylinder, on which was engraved these words, \"Open\r\ncarefully.\" The paper contained a truly Macchiavellian letter from Ali,\r\nwhich began by saying that they were quite justified in having taken up\r\narms against him, and added that he now sent them a part of the pay of\r\nwhich the traitorous Ismail was defrauding them, and that the bombs\r\nthrown into their cantonment contained six thousand sequins in gold. He\r\nbegged them to amuse Ismail by complaints and recriminations, while his\r\ngondola should by night fetch one of them, to whom he would communicate\r\nwhat more he had to say. If they accepted his proposition, they were to\r\nlight three fires as a signal.\r\n\r\nThe signal was not long in appearing. Ali despatched his barge, which\r\ntook on board a monk, the spiritual chief of the Suliots. He was clothed\r\nin sackcloth, and repeated the prayers for the dying, as one going to\r\nexecution. Ali, however, received him with the utmost cordiality: He\r\nassured the priest of his repentance, his good intentions, his esteem\r\nfor the Greek captains, and then gave him a paper which startled him\r\nconsiderably. It was a despatch, intercepted by Ali, from Khalid Effendi\r\nto the Seraskier Ismail, ordering the latter to exterminate all\r\nChristians capable of bearing arms. All male children were to be\r\ncircumcised, and brought up to form a legion drilled in European\r\nfashion; and the letter went on to explain how the Suliots, the\r\nArmatolis, the Greek races of the mainland and those of the Archipelago\r\nshould be disposed of. Seeing the effect produced on the monk by the\r\nperusal of this paper, Ali hastened to make him the most advantageous\r\noffers, declaring that his own wish was to give Greece a political\r\nexistence, and only requiring that the Suliot captains should send him a\r\ncertain number of their children as hostages. He then had cloaks and\r\narms brought which he presented to the monk, dismissing him in haste, in\r\norder that darkness might favour his return.\r\n\r\nThe next day Ali was resting, with his head on Basilissa’s lap, when he\r\nwas informed that the enemy was advancing upon the intrenchments which\r\nhad been raised in the midst of the ruins of Janina. Already the\r\noutposts had been forced, and the fury of the assailants threatened to\r\ntriumph over all obstacles. Ali immediately ordered a sortie of all his\r\ntroops, announcing that he himself would conduct it. His master of the\r\nhorse brought him the famous Arab charger called the Dervish, his chief\r\nhuntsman presented him with his guns, weapons still famous in Epirus,\r\nwhere they figure in the ballads of the Skipetars. The first was an\r\nenormous gun, of Versailles manufacture, formerly presented by the\r\nconqueror of the Pyramids to Djezzar, the Pacha of St. Jean-d’Arc, who\r\namused himself by enclosing living victims in the walls of his palace,\r\nin order that he might hear their groans in the midst of his\r\nfestivities. Next came a carabine given to the Pacha of Janina in the\r\nname of Napoleon in 1806; then the battle musket of Charles XII of\r\nSweden, and finally— the much revered sabre of Krim-Guerai. The signal\r\nwas given; the draw bridge crossed; the Guegues and other adventurers\r\nuttered a terrific shout; to which the cries of the assailants replied.\r\nAli placed himself on a height, whence his eagle eye sought to discern\r\nthe hostile chiefs; but he called and defied Pacho Bey in vain.\r\nPerceiving Hassan-Stamboul, colonel of the Imperial bombardiers outside\r\nhis battery, Ali demanded the gun of Djezzar, and laid him dead on the\r\nspot. He then took the carabine of Napoleon, and shot with it Kekriman,\r\nBey of Sponga, whom he had formerly appointed Pacha of Lepanto. The\r\nenemy now became aware of his presence, and sent a lively fusillade in\r\nhis direction; but the balls seemed to diverge from his person. As soon\r\nas the smoke cleared, he perceived Capelan, Pacha of Croie, who had been\r\nhis guest, and wounded him mortally in the chest. Capelan uttered a\r\nsharp cry, and his terrified horse caused disorder in the ranks. Ali\r\npicked off a large number of officers, one after another; every shot was\r\nmortal, and his enemies began to regard him in, the light of a\r\ndestroying angel. Disorder spread through the forces of the Seraskier,\r\nwho retreated hastily to his intrenchments.\r\n\r\nThe Suliots meanwhile sent a deputation to Ismail offering their\r\nsubmission, and seeking to regain their country in a peaceful manner;\r\nbut, being received by him with the most humiliating contempt, they\r\nresolved to make common cause with Ali. They hesitated over the demand\r\nfor hostages, and at length required Ali’s grandson, Hussien Pacha, in\r\nexchange. After many difficulties, Ali at length consented, and the\r\nagreement was concluded. The Suliots received five hundred thousand\r\npiastres and a hundred and fifty charges of ammunition, Hussien Pacha\r\nwas given up to them, and they left the Ottoman camp at dead of night.\r\nMorco Botzaris remained with three hundred and twenty men, threw down\r\nthe palisades, and then ascending Mount Paktoras with his troops, waited\r\nfor dawn in order to announce his defection to the Turkish army. As soon\r\nas the sun appeared he ordered a general salvo of artillery and shouted\r\nhis war-cry. A few Turks in charge of an outpost were slain, the rest\r\nfled. A cry of \"To arms\" was raised, and the standard of the Cross\r\nfloated before the camp of the infidels.\r\n\r\nSigns and omens of a coming general insurrection appeared on all sides;\r\nthere was no lack of prodigies, visions, or popular rumours, and the\r\nMohammedans became possessed with the idea that the last hour of their\r\nrule in Greece had struck. Ali Pacha favoured the general\r\ndemoralisation; and his agents, scattered throughout the land, fanned\r\nthe flame of revolt. Ismail Pacha was deprived of his title of\r\nSeraskier, and superseded by Kursheed Pacha. As soon as Ali heard this,\r\nhe sent a messenger to Kursheed, hoping to influence him in his favour.\r\nIsmail, distrusting the Skipetars, who formed part of his troops,\r\ndemanded hostages from them. The Skipetars were indignant, and Ali\r\nhearing of their discontent, wrote inviting them to return to him, and\r\nendeavouring to dazzle them by the most brilliant promises. These\r\novertures were received by the offended troops with enthusiasm, and\r\nAlexis Noutza, Ali’s former general, who had forsaken him for Ismail,\r\nbut who had secretly returned to his allegiance and acted as a spy on\r\nthe Imperial army, was deputed to treat with him. As soon as he arrived,\r\nAli began to enact a comedy in the intention of rebutting the accusation\r\nof incest with his daughter-in-law Zobeide; for this charge, which,\r\nsince Veli himself had revealed the secret of their common shame, could\r\nonly be met by vague denials, had never ceased to produce a most\r\nunfavourable impression on Noutza’s mind. Scarcely had he entered the\r\ncastle by the lake, when Ali rushed to meet him, and flung himself into\r\nhis arms. In presence of his officers and the garrison, he loaded him\r\nwith the most tender names, calling him his son, his beloved Alexis, his\r\nown legitimate child, even as Salik Pacha. He burst into tears, and,\r\nwith terrible oaths, called Heaven to witness that Mouktar and Veli,\r\nwhom he disavowed on account of their cowardice, were the adulterous\r\noffspring of Emineh’s amours. Then, raising his hand against the tomb of\r\nher whom he had loved so much, he drew the stupefied Noutza into the\r\nrecess of a casemate, and sending for Basilissa, presented him to her as\r\na beloved son, whom only political considerations had compelled him to\r\nkeep at a distance, because, being born of a Christian mother, he had\r\nbeen brought up in the faith of Jesus.\r\n\r\nHaving thus softened the suspicions of his soldiers, Ali resumed his\r\nunderground intrigues. The Suliots had informed him that the sultan had\r\nmade them extremely advantageous offers if they would return to his\r\nservice, and they demanded pressingly that Ali should give up to them\r\nthe citadel of Kiapha, which was still in his possession, and which\r\ncommanded Suli. He replied with the information that he intended,\r\nJanuary 26, to attack the camp of Pacho Bey early in the morning, and\r\nrequested their assistance. In order to cause a diversion, they were to\r\ndescend into the valley of Janina at night, and occupy a position which\r\nhe pointed out to them, and he gave them the word \"flouri\" as password\r\nfor the night. If successful, he undertook to grant their request.\r\n\r\nAli’s letter was intercepted, and fell into Ismail’s hands, who\r\nimmediately conceived a plan for snaring his enemy in his own toils.\r\nWhen the night fixed by Ali arrived, the Seraskier marched out a strong\r\ndivision under the command of Omar Brionis, who had been recently\r\nappointed Pacha, and who was instructed to proceed along the western\r\nslope of Mount Paktoras as far as the village of Besdoune, where he was\r\nto place an outpost, and then to retire along the other side of the\r\nmountain, so that, being visible in the starlight, the sentinels placed\r\nto watch on the hostile towers might take his men for the Suliots and\r\nreport to Ali that the position of Saint-Nicolas, assigned to them, had\r\nbeen occupied as arranged. All preparations for battle were made, and\r\nthe two mortal enemies, Ismail and Ali, retired to rest, each cherishing\r\nthe darling hope of shortly annihilating his rival.\r\n\r\nAt break of day a lively cannonade, proceeding from the castle of the\r\nlake and from Lithoritza, announced that the besieged intended a sortie.\r\nSoon Ali’s Skipetars, preceded by a detachment of French, Italians, and\r\nSwiss, rushed through the Ottoman fire and carried the first redoubt,\r\nheld by Ibrahim-Aga-Stamboul. They found six pieces of cannon, which the\r\nTurks, notwithstanding their terror, had had time to spike. This\r\nmisadventure, for they had hoped to turn the artillery against the\r\nintrenched camp, decided Ali’s men on attacking the second redoubt,\r\ncommanded by the chief bombardier. The Asiatic troops of Baltadgi Pacha\r\nrushed to its defence. At their head appeared the chief Imaun of the\r\narmy, mounted on a richly caparisoned mule and repeating the curse\r\nfulminated by the mufti against Ali, his adherents, his castles, and\r\neven his cannons, which it was supposed might be rendered harmless by\r\nthese adjurations. Ali’s Mohammedan Skipetars averted their eyes, and\r\nspat into their bosoms, hoping thus to escape the evil influence. A\r\nsuperstitious terror was beginning to spread among them, when a French\r\nadventurer took aim at the Imaun and brought him down, amid the\r\nacclamations of the soldiers; whereupon the Asiatics, imagining that\r\nEblis himself fought against them, retired within the intrenchments,\r\nwhither the Skipetars, no longer fearing the curse, pursued them\r\nvigorously.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, however, a very different action was proceeding at the\r\nnorthern end of the besiegers’ intrenchments. Ali left his castle of the\r\nlake, preceded by twelve torch-bearers carrying braziers filled with\r\nlighted pitch-wood, and advanced towards the shore of Saint-Nicolas,\r\nexpecting to unite with the Suliots. He stopped in the middle of the\r\nruins to wait for sunrise, and while there heard that his troops had\r\ncarried the battery of Ibrahim-Aga-Stamboul. Overjoyed, he ordered them\r\nto press on to the second intrenchment, promising that in an hour, when\r\nhe should have been joined by the Suliots, he would support them, and he\r\nthen pushed forward, preceded by two field-pieces with their waggons,\r\nand followed by fifteen hundred men, as far as a large plateau on which\r\nhe perceived at a little distance an encampment which he supposed to be\r\nthat of the Suliots. He then ordered the Mirdite prince, Kyr Lekos, to\r\nadvance with an escort of twenty-five men, and when within hearing\r\ndistance to wave a blue flag and call out the password. An Imperial\r\nofficer replied with the countersign \"flouri,\" and Lekos immediately\r\nsent back word to Ali to advance. His orderly hastened back, and the\r\nprince entered the camp, where he and his escort were immediately\r\nsurrounded and slain.\r\n\r\nOn receiving the message, Ali began to advance, but cautiously, being\r\nuneasy at seeing no signs of the Mirdite troop. Suddenly, furious cries,\r\nand a lively fusillade, proceeding from the vineyards and thickets,\r\nannounced that he had fallen into a trap, and at the same moment Omar\r\nPacha fell upon his advance guard, which broke, crying \"Treason!\".\r\n\r\nAli sabred the fugitives mercilessly, but fear carried them away, and,\r\nforced to follow the crowd, he perceived the Kersales and Baltadgi Pacha\r\ndescending the side of Mount Paktoras, intending to cut off his retreat.\r\nHe attempted another route, hastening towards the road to Dgeleva, but\r\nfound it held by the Tapagetae under the Bimbashi Aslon of\r\nArgyro-Castron. He was surrounded, all seemed lost, and feeling that his\r\nlast hour had come, he thought only of selling his life as dearly as\r\npossible. Collecting his bravest soldiers round him, he prepared for a\r\nlast rush on Omar Pacha; when, suddenly, with an inspiration born of\r\ndespair, he ordered his ammunition waggons to be blown up. The Kersales,\r\nwho were about to seize them, vanished in the explosion, which scattered\r\na hail of stones and debris far and wide. Under cover of the smoke and\r\ngeneral confusion, Ali succeeded in withdrawing his men to the shelter\r\nof the guns of his castle of Litharitza, where he continued the fight in\r\norder to give time to the fugitives to rally, and to give the support he\r\nhad promised to those fighting on the other slope; who, in the meantime,\r\nhad carried the second battery and were attacking the fortified camp.\r\nHere the Seraskier Ismail met them with a resistance so well managed,\r\nthat he was able to conceal the attack he was preparing to make on their\r\nrear. Ali, guessing that the object of Ismail’s manoeuvres was to crush\r\nthose whom he had promised to help, and unable, on account of the\r\ndistance, either to support or to warn them, endeavoured to impede Omar\r\nPasha, hoping still that his Skipetars might either see or hear him. He\r\nencouraged the fugitives, who recognised him from afar by his scarlet\r\ndolman, by the dazzling whiteness of his horse, and by the terrible\r\ncries which he uttered; for, in the heat of battle, this extraordinary\r\nman appeared to have regained the vigour and audacity, of his youth.\r\nTwenty times he led his soldiers to the charge, and as often was forced\r\nto recoil towards his castles. He brought up his reserves, but in vain.\r\nFate had declared against him. His troops which were attacking the\r\nintrenched camp found themselves taken between two fires, and he could\r\nnot help them. Foaming with passion, he threatened to rush singly into\r\nthe midst of his enemies. His officers besought him to calm himself,\r\nand, receiving only refusals, at last threatened to lay hands upon him\r\nif he persisted in exposing himself like a private soldier. Subdued by\r\nthis unaccustomed opposition, Ali allowed himself to be forced back into\r\nthe castle by the lake, while his soldiers dispersed in various\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nBut even this defeat did not discourage the fierce pasha. Reduced to\r\nextremity, he yet entertained the hope of shaking the Ottoman Empire,\r\nand from the recesses of his fortress he agitated the whole of Greece.\r\nThe insurrection which he had stirred up, without foreseeing what the\r\nresults might be, was spreading with the rapidity of a lighted train of\r\npowder, and the Mohammedans were beginning to tremble, when at length\r\nKursheed Pasha, having crossed the Pindus at the head of an army of\r\neighty thousand men, arrived before Janina.\r\n\r\nHis tent had hardly been pitched, when Ali caused a salute of twenty-one\r\nguns to be fired in his honour, and sent a messenger, bearing a letter\r\nof congratulation on his safe arrival. This letter, artful and\r\ninsinuating, was calculated to make a deep impression on Kursheed. Ali\r\nwrote that, being driven by the infamous lies of a former servant,\r\ncalled Pacho Bey, into resisting, not indeed the authority of the\r\nsultan, before whom he humbly bent his head weighed down with years and\r\ngrief, but the perfidious plots of His Highness’s advisers, he\r\nconsidered himself happy in his misfortunes to have dealings with a\r\nvizier noted for his lofty qualities. He then added that these rare\r\nmerits had doubtless been very far from being estimated at their proper\r\nvalue by a Divan in which men were only classed in accordance with the\r\nsums they laid out in gratifying the rapacity of the ministers.\r\nOtherwise, how came it about that Kursheed Pasha, Viceroy of Egypt—after\r\nthe departure of the French, the conqueror of the Mamelukes, was only\r\nrewarded for these services by being recalled without a reason? Having\r\nbeen twice Romili-Valicy, why, when he should have enjoyed the reward of\r\nhis labours, was he relegated to the obscure post of Salonica? And, when\r\nappointed Grand Vizier and sent to pacify Servia, instead of being\r\nentrusted with the government of this kingdom which he had reconquered\r\nfor the sultan, why was he hastily despatched to Aleppo to repress a\r\ntrifling sedition of emirs and janissaries? Now, scarcely arrived in the\r\nMorea, his powerful arm was to be employed against an aged man.\r\n\r\nAli then plunged into details, related the pillaging, avarice, and\r\nimperious dealing of Pacho Bey, as well as of the pachas subordinate to\r\nhim; how they had alienated the public mind, how they had succeeded in\r\noffending the Armatolis, and especially the Suliots, who might be\r\nbrought back to their duty with less trouble than these imprudent chiefs\r\nhad taken to estrange them. He gave a mass of special information on\r\nthis subject, and explained that in advising the Suliots to retire to\r\ntheir mountains he had really only put them in a false position as long\r\nas he retained possession of the fort of Kiapha, which is the key of the\r\nSelleide.\r\n\r\nThe Seraskier replied in a friendly manner, ordered the military salute\r\nto be returned in Ali’s honour, shot for shot, and forbade that\r\nhenceforth a person of the valour and intrepidity of the Lion of Tepelen\r\nshould be described by the epithet of \"excommunicated.\" He also spoke of\r\nhim by his title of \"vizier,\" which he declared he had never forfeited\r\nthe right to use; and he also stated that he had only entered Epirus as\r\na peace-maker. Kursheed’s emissaries had just seized some letters sent\r\nby Prince Alexander Ypsilanti to the Greek captains at Epirus. Without\r\ngoing into details of the events which led to the Greek insurrection,\r\nthe prince advised the Polemarchs, chiefs of the Selleid, to aid Ali\r\nPacha in his revolt against the Porte, but to so arrange matters that\r\nthey could easily detach themselves again, their only aim being to seize\r\nhis treasures, which might be used to procure the freedom of Greece.\r\n\r\nThese letters a messenger from Kursheed delivered to Ali. They produced\r\nsuch an impression upon his mind that he secretly resolved only to make\r\nuse of the Greeks, and to sacrifice them to his own designs, if he could\r\nnot inflict a terrible vengeance on their perfidy. He heard from the\r\nmessenger at the same time of the agitation in European Turkey, the\r\nhopes of the Christians, and the apprehension of a rupture between the\r\nPorte and Russia. It was necessary to lay aside vain resentment and to\r\nunite against these threatening dangers. Kursheed Pacha was, said his\r\nmessenger, ready to consider favourably any propositions likely to lead\r\nto a prompt pacification, and would value such a result far more highly\r\nthan the glory of subduing by means of the imposing force at his\r\ncommand, a valiant prince whom he had always regarded as one of the\r\nstrongest bulwarks of the Ottoman Empire. This information produced a\r\ndifferent effect upon Ali to that intended by the Seraskier. Passing\r\nsuddenly from the depth of despondency to the height of pride, he\r\nimagined that these overtures of reconciliation were only a proof of the\r\ninability of his foes to subdue him, and he sent the following\r\npropositions to Kursheed Pacha:\r\n\r\n\"If the first duty of a prince is to do justice, that of his subjects is\r\nto remain faithful, and obey him in all things. From this principle we\r\nderive that of rewards and punishments, and although my services might\r\nsufficiently justify my conduct to all time, I nevertheless acknowledge\r\nthat I have deserved the wrath of the sultan, since he has raised the\r\narm of his anger against the head of his slave. Having humbly implored\r\nhis pardon, I fear not to invoke his severity towards those who have\r\nabused his confidence. With this object I offer—First, to pay the\r\nexpenses of the war and the tribute in arrears due from my Government\r\nwithout delay. Secondly, as it is important for the sake of example that\r\nthe treason of an inferior towards his superior should receive fitting\r\nchastisement, I demand that Pacho Bey, formerly in my service, should be\r\nbeheaded, he being the real rebel, and the cause of the public\r\ncalamities which are afflicting the faithful of Islam. Thirdly, I\r\nrequire that for the rest of my life I shall retain, without annual\r\nre-investiture, my pachalik of Janina, the coast of Epirus, Acarnania\r\nand its dependencies, subject to the rights, charges and tribute due now\r\nand hereafter to the sultan. Fourthly, I demand amnesty and oblivion of\r\nthe past for all those who have served me until now. And if these\r\nconditions are not accepted without modifications, I am prepared to\r\ndefend myself to the last.\r\n\r\n\"Given at the castle of Janina, March 7, 1821.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mixture of arrogance and submission only merited indignation, but\r\nit suited Kursheed to dissemble. He replied that, assenting to such\r\npropositions being beyond his powers, he would transmit them to\r\nConstantinople, and that hostilities might be suspended, if Ali wished,\r\nuntil the courier, could return.\r\n\r\nBeing quite as cunning as Ali himself, Kursheed profited by the truce to\r\ncarry on intrigues against him. He corrupted one of the chiefs of the\r\ngarrison, Metzo-Abbas by name, who obtained pardon for himself and fifty\r\nfollowers, with permission to return to their homes. But this clemency\r\nappeared to have seduced also four hundred Skipetars who made use of the\r\namnesty and the money with which Ali provided them, to raise Toxis and\r\nthe Tapygetae in the latter’s favour. Thus the Seraskier’s scheme turned\r\nagainst himself, and he perceived he had been deceived by Ali’s seeming\r\napathy, which certainly did not mean dread of defection. In fact, no man\r\nworth anything could have abandoned him, supported as he seemed to be by\r\nalmost supernatural courage. Suffering from a violent attack of gout, a\r\nmalady he had never before experienced, the pacha, at the age of\r\neighty-one, was daily carried to the most exposed place on the ramparts\r\nof his castle. There, facing the hostile batteries, he gave audience to\r\nwhoever wished to see him. On this exposed platform he held his\r\ncouncils, despatched orders, and indicated to what points his guns\r\nshould be directed. Illumined by the flashes of fire, his figure assumed\r\nfantastic and weird shapes. The balls sung in the air, the bullets\r\nhailed around him, the noise drew blood from the ears of those with him.\r\nCalm and immovable, he gave signals to the soldiers who were still\r\noccupying part of the ruins of Janina, and encouraged them by voice and\r\ngesture. Observing the enemy’s movements by the help of a telescope, he\r\nimprovised means of counteracting them. Sometimes he amused himself by,\r\ngreeting curious persons and new-comers after a fashion of his own. Thus\r\nthe chancellor of the French Consul at Prevesa, sent as an envoy to\r\nKursheed Pacha, had scarcely entered the lodging assigned to him, when\r\nhe was visited by a bomb which caused him to leave it again with all\r\nhaste. This greeting was due to Ali’s chief engineer, Caretto, who next\r\nday sent a whole shower of balls and shells into the midst of a group of\r\nFrenchmen, whose curiosity had brought them to Tika, where Kursheed was\r\nforming a battery. \"It is time,\" said Ali, \"that these contemptible\r\ngossip-mongers should find listening at doors may become uncomfortable.\r\nI have furnished matter enough for them to talk about. Frangistan\r\n(Christendom) shall henceforth hear only of my triumph or my fall, which\r\nwill leave it considerable trouble to pacify.\" Then, after a moment’s\r\nsilence, he ordered the public criers to inform his soldiers of the\r\ninsurrections in Wallachia and the Morea, which news, proclaimed from\r\nthe ramparts, and spreading immediately in the Imperial camp, caused\r\nthere much dejection.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks were now everywhere proclaiming their independence, and\r\nKursheed found himself unexpectedly surrounded by enemies. His position\r\nthreatened to become worse if the siege of Janina dragged on much\r\nlonger. He seized the island in the middle of the lake, and threw up\r\nredoubts upon it, whence he kept up an incessant fire on the southern\r\nfront of the castle of Litharitza, and a practicable trench of nearly\r\nforty feet having been made, an assault was decided on. The troops\r\nmarched out boldly, and performed prodigies of valour; but at the end of\r\nan hour, Ali, carried on a litter because of his gout, having led a\r\nsortie, the besiegers were compelled to give way and retire to their\r\nintrenchments, leaving three hundred dead at the foot of the rampart.\r\n\"The Pindian bear is yet alive,\" said Ali in a message to Kursheed;\r\n\"thou mayest take thy dead and bury them; I give them up without ransom,\r\nand as I shall always do when thou attackest me as a brave man ought.\"\r\nThen, having entered his fortress amid the acclamations of his soldiers,\r\nhe remarked on hearing of the general rising of Greece and the\r\nArchipelago, \"It is enough! two men have ruined Turkey!\" He then\r\nremained silent, and vouchsafed no explanation of this prophetic\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\nAli did not on this occasion manifest his usual delight on having gained\r\na success. As soon as he was alone with Basilissa, he informed her with\r\ntears of the death of Chainitza. A sudden apoplexy had stricken this\r\nbeloved sister, the life of his councils, in her palace of Libokovo,\r\nwhere she remained undisturbed until her death. She owed this special\r\nfavour to her riches and to the intercession of her nephew, Djiladin\r\nPacha of Ochcrida, who was reserved by fate to perform the funeral\r\nobsequies of the guilty race of Tepelen.\r\n\r\nA few months afterwards, Ibrahim Pacha of Berat died of poison, being\r\nthe last victim whom Chainitza had demanded from her brother.\r\n\r\nAli’s position was becoming daily more difficult, when the time of\r\nRamadan arrived, during which the Turks relax hostilities, and a species\r\nof truce ensued. Ali himself appeared to respect the old popular\r\ncustoms, and allowed his Mohammedan soldiers to visit the enemy’s\r\noutposts and confer on the subject of various religious ceremonies.\r\nDiscipline was relaxed in Kursheed’s camp, and Ali profited thereby to\r\nascertain the smallest details of all that passed.\r\n\r\nHe learned from his spies that the general’s staff, counting on the\r\n\"Truce of God,\" a tacit suspension of all hostilities during the feast\r\nof Bairam, the Mohammedan Easter, intended to repair to the chief\r\nmosque, in the quarter of Loutcha. This building, spared by the bombs,\r\nhad until now been respected by both sides. Ali, according to reports\r\nspread by himself, was supposed to be ill, weakened by fasting, and\r\nterrified into a renewal of devotion, and not likely to give trouble on\r\nso sacred a day. Nevertheless he ordered Caretto to turn thirty guns\r\nagainst the mosque, cannon, mortars and howitzers, intending, he said,\r\nto solemnise Bairam by discharges of artillery. As soon as he was sure\r\nthat the whole of the staff had entered the mosque, he gave the signal.\r\n\r\nInstantly, from the assembled thirty pieces, there issued a storm of\r\nshells, grenades and cannon-balls. With a terrific noise, the mosque\r\ncrumbled together, amid the cries of pain and rage of the crowd inside\r\ncrushed in the ruins. At the end of a quarter of an hour the wind\r\ndispersed the smoke, and disclosed a burning crater, with the large\r\ncypresses which surrounded the building blazing as if they had been\r\ntorches lighted for the funeral ceremonies of sixty captains and two\r\nhundred soldiers.\r\n\r\n\"Ali Pacha is yet alive!\" cried the old Homeric hero of Janina, leaping\r\nwith joy; and his words, passing from mouth to mouth, spread yet more\r\nterror amid Kursheed’s soldiers, already overwhelmed by the horrible\r\nspectacle passing before their eyes.\r\n\r\nAlmost on the same day, Ali from the height of his keep beheld the\r\nstandard of the Cross waving in the distance. The rebellious Greeks were\r\nbent on attacking Kursheed. The insurrection promoted by the Vizier of\r\nJanina had passed far beyond the point he intended, and the rising had\r\nbecome a revolution. The delight which Ali first evinced cooled rapidly\r\nbefore this consideration, and was extinguished in grief when he found\r\nthat a conflagration, caused by the besiegers’ fire, had consumed part\r\nof his store in the castle by the lake. Kursheed, thinking that this\r\nevent must have shaken the old lion’s resolution, recommenced\r\nnegotiations, choosing the Kiaia of Moustai Pacha: as an envoy, who gave\r\nAli a remarkable warning. \"Reflect,\" said he, \"that these rebels bear\r\nthe sign of the Cross on their standards. You are now only an instrument\r\nin their hands. Beware lest you become the victim of their policy.\" Ali\r\nunderstood the danger, and had the sultan been better advised, he would\r\nhave pardoned Ali on condition of again bringing Hellos under his iron\r\nyoke. It is possible that the Greeks might not have prevailed against an\r\nenemy so formidable and a brain so fertile in intrigue. But so simple an\r\nidea was far beyond the united intellect of the Divan, which never rose\r\nabove idle display. As soon as these negotiations, had commenced,\r\nKursheed filled the roads with his couriers, sending often two in a day\r\nto Constantinople, from whence as many were sent to him. This state of\r\nthings lasted more than three weeks, when it became known that Ali, who\r\nhad made good use of his time in replacing the stores lost in the\r\nconflagration, buying actually from the Kiaia himself a part of the\r\nprovisions brought by him for the Imperial camp, refused to accept the\r\nOttoman ultimatum. Troubles which broke, out at the moment of the\r\nrupture of the negotiations proved that he foresaw the probable result.\r\n\r\nKursheed was recompensed for the deception by which he had been duped by\r\nthe reduction of the fortress of Litharitza. The Guegue Skipetars, who\r\ncomposed the garrison, badly paid, wearied out by the long siege, and\r\nwon by the Seraskier’s bribes, took advantage of the fact that the time\r\nof their engagement with Ali had elapsed some months previously, and\r\ndelivering up the fortress they defended, passed over to the enemy.\r\nHenceforth Ali’s force consisted of only six hundred men.\r\n\r\nIt was to be feared that this handful of men might also become a prey to\r\ndiscouragement, and might surrender their chief to an enemy who had\r\nreceived all fugitives with kindness. The Greek insurgents dreaded such\r\nan event, which would have turned all Kursheed’s army, hitherto detained\r\nbefore the castle, of Janina, loose upon themselves. Therefore they\r\nhastened to send to their former enemy, now their ally, assistance which\r\nhe declined to accept. Ali saw himself surrounded by enemies thirsting\r\nfor his wealth, and his avarice increasing with the danger, he had for\r\nsome months past refused to pay his defenders. He contented himself with\r\ninforming his captains of the insurgents’ offer, and telling them that\r\nhe was confident that bravery such as theirs required no reinforcement.\r\nAnd when some of them besought him to at least receive two or three\r\nhundred Palikars into the castle, \"No,\" said he; \"old serpents always\r\nremain old serpents: I distrust the Suliots and their friendship.\"\r\n\r\nIgnorant of Ali’s decision, the Greeks of the Selleid were advancing, as\r\nwell as the Toxidae, towards Janina, when they received the following\r\nletter from Ali Pacha:\r\n\r\n\"My well-beloved children, I have just learned that you are preparing to\r\ndespatch a party of your Palikars against our common enemy, Kursheed. I\r\ndesire to inform you that this my fortress is impregnable, and that I\r\ncan hold out against him for several years. The only, service I require\r\nof your courage is, that you should reduce Arta, and take alive Ismail\r\nPacho Bey, my former servant, the mortal enemy of my family, and the\r\nauthor of the evils and frightful calamities which have so long\r\noppressed our unhappy country, which he has laid waste before our eyes.\r\nUse your best efforts to accomplish this, it will strike at the root of\r\nthe evil, and my treasures shall reward your Palikars, whose courage\r\nevery day gains a higher value in my eyes.\"\r\n\r\nFurious at this mystification, the Suliots retired to their mountains,\r\nand Kursheed profited by the discontent Ali’s conduct had caused, to win\r\nover the Toxide Skipetars, with their commanders Tahir Abbas and Hagi\r\nBessiaris, who only made two conditions: one, that Ismail Pacho Bey,\r\ntheir personal enemy, should be deposed; the other, that the life of\r\ntheir old vizier should be respected.\r\n\r\nThe first condition was faithfully adhered to by Kursheed, actuated by\r\nprivate motives different from those which he gave publicly, and Ismail\r\nPacho Bey was solemnly deposed. The tails, emblems of his authority,\r\nwere removed; he resigned the plumes of office; his soldiers forsook\r\nhim, his servants followed suit. Fallen to the lowest rank, he was soon\r\nthrown into prison, where he only blamed Fate for his misfortunes. All\r\nthe Skipetar Agas hastened to place themselves under Kursheeds’\r\nstandard, and enormous forces now threatened Janina. All Epirus awaited\r\nthe denoument with anxiety.\r\n\r\nHad he been less avaricious, Ali might have enlisted all the adventurers\r\nwith whom the East was swarming, and made the sultan tremble in his\r\ncapital. But the aged pacha clung passionately to his treasures. He\r\nfeared also, perhaps not unreasonably, that those by whose aid he might\r\ntriumph would some day become his master. He long deceived himself with\r\nthe idea that the English, who had sold Parga to him, would never allow\r\na Turkish fleet to enter the Ionian Sea. Mistaken on this point, his\r\nforesight was equally at fault with regard to the cowardice of his sons.\r\nThe defection of his troops was not less fatal, and he only understood\r\nthe bearing of the Greek insurrection which he himself had provoked, so\r\nfar as to see that in this struggle he was merely an instrument in\r\nprocuring the freedom of a country which he had too cruelly oppressed to\r\nbe able to hold even an inferior rank in it. His last letter to the\r\nSuliots opened the eyes of his followers, but under the influence of a\r\nsort of polite modesty these were at least anxious to stipulate for the\r\nlife of their vizier. Kursheed was obliged to produce firmans from the\r\nPorte, declaring that if Ali Tepelen submitted, the royal promise given\r\nto his sons should be kept, and that he should, with them, be\r\ntransferred to Asia Minor, as also his harem, his servants; and his\r\ntreasures, and allowed to finish his days in peace. Letters from Ali’s\r\nsons were shown to the Agas, testifying to the good treatment they had\r\nexperienced in their exile; and whether the latter believed all this, or\r\nwhether they merely sought to satisfy their own consciences, they\r\nhenceforth thought only of inducing their rebellious chief to submit.\r\nFinally, eight months’ pay, given them in advance, proved decisive, and\r\nthey frankly embraced the cause of the sultan.\r\n\r\nThe garrison of the castle on the lake, whom Ali seemed anxious to\r\noffend as much as possible, by refusing their pay, he thinking them so\r\ncompromised that they would not venture even to accept an amnesty\r\nguaranteed by the mufti, began to desert as soon as they knew the\r\nToxidae had arrived at the Imperial camp. Every night these Skipetars\r\nwho could cross the moat betook themselves to Kursheed’s quarters. One\r\nsingle man yet baffled all the efforts of the besiegers. The chief\r\nengineer, Caretto, like another Archimedes, still carried terror into\r\nthe midst of their camp.\r\n\r\nAlthough reduced to the direst misery, Caretto could not forget that he\r\nowed his life to the master who now only repaid his services with the\r\nmost sordid ingratitude. When he had first come to Epirus, Ali,\r\nrecognising his ability, became anxious to retain him, but without\r\nincurring any expense. He ascertained that the Neapolitan was\r\npassionately in love with a Mohammedan girl named Nekibi, who returned\r\nhis affection. Acting under Ali’s orders, Tahir Abbas accused the woman\r\nbefore the cadi of sacrilegious intercourse with an infidel. She could\r\nonly escape death by the apostasy of her lover; if he refused to deny\r\nhis God, he shared her fate, and both would perish at the stake. Caretto\r\nrefused to renounce his religion, but only Nekibi suffered death.\r\nCaretto was withdrawn from execution, and Ali kept him concealed in a\r\nplace of safety, whence he produced him in the time of need. No one had\r\nserved him with greater zeal; it is even possible that a man of this\r\ntype would have died at his post, had his cup not been filled with\r\nmortification and insult.\r\n\r\nEluding the vigilance of Athanasius Vaya, whose charge it was to keep\r\nguard over him, Caretto let himself down by a cord fastened to the end\r\nof a cannon: He fell at the foot of the rampart, and thence dragged\r\nhimself, with a broken arm, to the opposite camp. He had become nearly\r\nblind through the explosion of a cartridge which had burnt his face. He\r\nwas received as well as a Christian from whom there was now nothing to\r\nfear, could expect. He received the bread of charity, and as a refugee\r\nis only valued in proportion to the use which can be made of him, he was\r\ndespised and forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe desertion of Caretto was soon followed by a defection which\r\nannihilated Ali’s last hopes. The garrison which had given him so many\r\nproofs of devotion, discouraged by his avarice, suffering from a\r\ndisastrous epidemic, and no longer equal to the necessary labour in\r\ndefence of the place, opened all, the gates simultaneously to the enemy.\r\nBut the besiegers, fearing a trap, advanced very slowly; so that Ali,\r\nwho had long prepared against every sort of surprise, had time to gain a\r\nplace which he called his \"refuge.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a sort of fortified enclosure, of solid masonry, bristling with\r\ncannon, which surrounded the private apartments of his seraglio, called\r\nthe \"Women’s Tower.\" He had taken care to demolish everything which\r\ncould be set on fire, reserving only a mosque and the tomb of his wife\r\nEmineh, whose phantom, after announcing an eternal repose, had ceased to\r\nhaunt him. Beneath was an immense natural cave, in which he had stored\r\nammunition, precious articles, provisions, and the treasures which had\r\nnot been sunk in the lake. In this cave an apartment had been made for\r\nBasilissa and his harem, also a shelter in which he retired to sleep\r\nwhen exhausted with fatigue. This place was his last resort, a kind of\r\nmausoleum; and he did not seem distressed at beholding the castle in the\r\nhands of his enemies. He calmly allowed them to occupy the entrance,\r\ndeliver their hostages, overrun the ramparts, count the cannon which\r\nwere on the platforms, crumbling from the hostile shells; but when they\r\ncame within hearing, he demanded by one of his servants that Kursheed\r\nshould send him an envoy of distinction; meanwhile he forbade anyone to\r\npass beyond a certain place which he pointed out.\r\n\r\nKursheed, imagining that, being in the last extremity, he would\r\ncapitulate, sent out Tahir Abbas and Hagi Bessiaris. Ali listened\r\nwithout reproaching them for their treachery, but simply observed that\r\nhe wished to meet some of the chief officers.\r\n\r\nThe Seraskier then deputed his keeper of the wardrobe, accompanied by\r\nhis keeper of the seals and other persons of quality. Ali received them\r\nwith all ceremony, and, after the usual compliments had been exchanged,\r\ninvited them to descend with him into the cavern. There he showed them\r\nmore than two thousand barrels of powder carefully arranged beneath his\r\ntreasures, his remaining provisions, and a number of valuable objects\r\nwhich adorned this slumbering volcano. He showed them also his bedroom,\r\na sort of cell richly furnished, and close to the powder. It could be\r\nreached only by means of three doors, the secret of which was known to\r\nno one but himself. Alongside of this was the harem, and in the\r\nneighbouring mosque was quartered his garrison, consisting of fifty men,\r\nall ready to bury themselves under the ruins of this fortification, the\r\nonly spot remaining to him of all Greece, which had formerly bent\r\nbeneath his authority.\r\n\r\nAfter this exhibition, Ali presented one of his most devoted followers\r\nto the envoys. Selim, who watched over the fire, was a youth in\r\nappearance as gentle as his heart was intrepid, and his special duty was\r\nto be in readiness to blow up the whole place at any moment. The pacha\r\ngave him his hand to kiss, inquiring if he were ready to die, to which\r\nhe only responded by pressing his master’s hand fervently to his lips.\r\nHe never took his eyes off Ali, and the lantern, near which a match was\r\nconstantly smoking, was entrusted only to him and to Ali, who took turns\r\nwith him in watching it. Ali drew a pistol from his belt, making as if\r\nto turn it towards the powder magazine, and the envoys fell at his feet,\r\nuttering involuntary cries of terror. He smiled at their fears, and\r\nassured them that, being wearied of the weight of his weapons, he had\r\nonly intended to relieve himself of some of them. He then begged them to\r\nseat themselves, and added that he should like even a more terrible\r\nfuneral than that which they had just ascribed to him. \"I do not wish to\r\ndrag down with me,\" he exclaimed, \"those who have come to visit me as\r\nfriends; it is Kursheed, whom I have long regarded as my brother, his\r\nchiefs, those who have betrayed me, his whole army in short, whom I\r\ndesire to follow me to the tomb—a sacrifice which will be worthy of my\r\nrenown, and of the brilliant end to which I aspire.\"\r\n\r\nThe envoys gazed at him with stupefaction, which did not diminish when\r\nAli further informed them that they were not only sitting over the arch\r\nof a casemate filled with two hundred thousand pounds of powder, but\r\nthat the whole castle, which they had so rashly occupied, was\r\nundermined. \"The rest you have seen,\" he said, \"but of this you could\r\nnot be aware. My riches are the sole cause of the war which has been\r\nmade against me, and in one moment I can destroy them. Life is nothing\r\nto me, I might have ended it among the Greeks, but could I, a powerless\r\nold man, resolve to live on terms of equality among those whose absolute\r\nmaster I have been? Thus, whichever way I look, my career is ended.\r\nHowever, I am attached to those who still surround me, so hear my last\r\nresolve. Let a pardon, sealed by the sultan’s hands, be given me, and I\r\nwill submit. I will go to Constantinople, to Asia Minor, or wherever I\r\nam sent. The things I should see here would no longer be fitting for me\r\nto behold.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Kursheed’s envoys made answer that without doubt these terms\r\nwould be conceded. Ali then touched his breast and forehead, and,\r\ndrawing forth his watch, presented it to the keeper of the wardrobe. \"I\r\nmean what I say, my friend,\" he observed; \"my word will be kept. If\r\nwithin an hour thy soldiers are not withdrawn from this castle which has\r\nbeen treacherously yielded to them, I will blow it up. Return to the\r\nSeraskier, warn him that if he allows one minute more to elapse than the\r\ntime specified, his army, his garrison, I myself and my family, will all\r\nperish together: two hundred thousand pounds of powder can destroy all\r\nthat surrounds us. Take this watch, I give it thee, and forget not that\r\nI am a man of my word.\" Then, dismissing the messengers, he saluted them\r\ngraciously, observing that he did not expect an answer until the\r\nsoldiers should have evacuated the castle.\r\n\r\nThe envoys had barely returned to the camp when Kursheed sent orders to\r\nabandon the fortress. As the reason for this step could not be\r\nconcealed, everyone, exaggerating the danger, imagined deadly mines\r\nready to be fired everywhere, and the whole army clamoured to break up\r\nthe camp. Thus Ali and his fifty followers cast terror into the hearts\r\nof nearly thirty thousand men, crowded together on the slopes of Janina.\r\nEvery sound, every whiff of smoke, ascending from near the castle,\r\nbecame a subject of alarm for the besiegers. And as the besieged had\r\nprovisions for a long time, Kursheed saw little chance of successfully\r\nending his enterprise; when Ali’s demand for pardon occurred to him.\r\nWithout stating his real plans, he proposed to his Council to unite in\r\nsigning a petition to the Divan for Ali’s pardon.\r\n\r\nThis deed, formally executed, and bearing more than sixty signatures,\r\nwas then shown to Ali, who was greatly delighted. He was described in it\r\nas Vizier, as Aulic Councillor, and also as the most distinguished\r\nveteran among His Highness the Sultan’s slaves. He sent rich presents to\r\nKursheed and the principal officers, whom he hoped to corrupt, and\r\nbreathed as though the storm had passed away. The following night,\r\nhowever, he heard the voice of Emineh, calling him several times, and\r\nconcluded that his end drew nigh.\r\n\r\nDuring the two next nights he again thought he heard Emineh’s voice, and\r\nsleep forsook his pillow, his countenance altered, and his endurance\r\nappeared to be giving way. Leaning on a long Malacca cane, he repaired\r\nat early dawn to Emineh’s tomb, on which he offered a sacrifice of two\r\nspotted lambs, sent him by Tahir Abbas, whom in return he consented to\r\npardon, and the letters he received appeared to mitigate his trouble.\r\nSome days later, he saw the keeper of the wardrobe, who encouraged him,\r\nsaying that before long there would be good news from Constantinople.\r\nAli learned from him the disgrace of Pacho Bey, and of Ismail Pliaga,\r\nwhom he detested equally, and this exercise of authority, which was made\r\nto appear as a beginning of satisfaction offered him, completely\r\nreassured him, and he made fresh presents to this officer, who had\r\nsucceeded in inspiring him with confidence.\r\n\r\nWhilst awaiting the arrival of the firman of pardon which Ali was\r\nreassured must arrive from Constantinople without fail, the keeper of\r\nthe wardrobe advised him to seek an interview with Kursheed. It was\r\nclear that such a meeting could not take place in the undermined castle,\r\nand Ali was therefore invited to repair to the island in the lake. The\r\nmagnificent pavilion, which he had constructed there in happier days,\r\nhad been entirely refurnished, and it was proposed that the conference\r\nshould take place in this kiosk.\r\n\r\nAli appeared to hesitate at this proposal, and the keeper of the\r\nwardrobe, wishing to anticipate his objections, added that the object of\r\nthis arrangement was, to prove to the army, already aware of it, that\r\nthere was no longer any quarrel between himself and the\r\ncommander-in-chief. He added that Kursheed would go to the conference\r\nattended only by members of his Divan, but that as it was natural an\r\noutlawed man should be on his guard, Ali might, if he liked, send to\r\nexamine the place, might take with him such guards as he thought\r\nnecessary, and might even arrange things on the same footing as in his\r\ncitadel, even to his guardian with the lighted match, as the surest\r\nguarantee which could be given him.\r\n\r\nThe proposition was accepted, and when Ali, having crossed over with a\r\nscore of soldiers, found himself more at large than he did in his\r\ncasemate, he congratulated himself on having come. He had Basilissa\r\nbrought over, also his diamonds; and several chests of money. Two days\r\npassed without his thinking of anything but procuring various\r\nnecessaries, and he then began to inquire what caused the Seraskier to\r\ndelay his visit. The latter excused himself on the plea of illness, and\r\noffered meanwhile to send anyone Ali might wish to see, to visit him:\r\nThe pacha immediately mentioned several of his former followers, now\r\nemployed in the Imperial army, and as no difficulty was made in allowing\r\nthem to go, he profited by the permission to interview a large number of\r\nhis old acquaintances, who united in reassuring him and in giving him\r\ngreat hopes of success.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, time passed on, and neither the Seraskier nor the firman\r\nappeared. Ali, at first uneasy, ended by rarely mentioning either the\r\none or the other, and never was deceiver more completely deceived. His\r\nsecurity was so great that he loudly congratulated himself on having\r\ncome to the island. He had begun to form a net of intrigue to cause\r\nhimself to be intercepted on the road when he should be sent to\r\nConstantinople, and he did not despair of soon finding numerous\r\npartisans in the Imperial army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a whole week all seemed going well, when, on the morning of February\r\n5th, Kursheed sent Hassan Pacha to convey his compliments to Ali, and\r\nannounce that the sultan’s firman, so long desired, had at length\r\narrived. Their mutual wishes had been heard, but it was desirable, for\r\nthe dignity of their sovereign, that Ali, in order to show his gratitude\r\nand submission, should order Selim to extinguish the fatal match and to\r\nleave the cave, and that the rest of the garrison should first display\r\nthe Imperial standard and then evacuate the enclosure. Only on this\r\ncondition could Kursheed deliver into Ali’s hands the sultan’s decree of\r\nclemency.\r\n\r\nAli was alarmed, and his eyes were at length opened. He replied\r\nhesitatingly, that on leaving the citadel he had charged Selim to obey\r\nonly his own verbal order, that no written command, even though signed\r\nand sealed by himself, would produce any effect, and therefore he\r\ndesired to repair himself to the castle, in order to fulfil what was\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nThereupon a long argument ensued, in which Ali’s sagacity, skill, and\r\nartifice struggled vainly against a decided line of action. New\r\nprotestations were made to deceive him, oaths were even taken on the\r\nKoran that no evil designs, no mental reservations, were entertained. At\r\nlength, yielding to the prayers of those who surrounded him, perhaps\r\nconcluding that all his skill could no longer fight against Destiny, he\r\nfinally gave way.\r\n\r\nDrawing a secret token from his bosom, he handed it to Kursheed’s envoy,\r\nsaying, \"Go, show this to Selim, and you will convert a dragon into a\r\nlamb.\" And in fact, at sight of the talisman, Selim prostrated himself,\r\nextinguished the match, and fell, stabbed to the heart. At the same time\r\nthe garrison withdrew, the Imperial standard displayed its blazonry, and\r\nthe lake castle was occupied by the troops of the Seraskier, who rent\r\nthe air with their acclamations.\r\n\r\nIt was then noon. Ali, in the island, had lost all illusions. His pulse\r\nbeat violently, but his countenance did not betray his mental trouble.\r\nIt was noticed that he appeared at intervals to be lost in profound\r\nthought, that he yawned frequently, and continually drew his fingers\r\nthrough his beard. He drank coffee and iced water several times,\r\nincessantly looked at his watch, and taking his field-glass, surveyed by\r\nturns the camp, the castles of Janina, the Pindus range, and the\r\npeaceful waters of the lake. Occasionally he glanced at his weapons, and\r\nthen his eyes sparkled with the fire of youth and of courage. Stationed\r\nbeside him, his guards prepared their cartridges, their eyes fixed on\r\nthe landing-place.\r\n\r\nThe kiosk which he occupied was connected with a wooden structure raised\r\nupon pillars, like the open-air theatres constructed for a public\r\nfestival, and the women occupied the most remote apartments. Everything\r\nseemed sad and silent. The vizier, according to custom, sat facing the\r\ndoorway, so as to be the first to perceive any who might wish to enter.\r\nAt five o’clock boats were seen approaching the island, and soon Hassan\r\nPacha, Omar Brionis, Kursheed’s sword-bearer, Mehemet, the keeper of the\r\nwardrobe, and several officers of the army, attended by a numerous\r\nsuite, drew near with gloomy countenances.\r\n\r\nSeeing them approach, Ali sprang up impetuously, his hand upon the\r\npistols in his belt. \"Stand! . . . what is it you bring me?\" he cried to\r\nHassan in a voice of thunder. \"I bring the commands of His Highness the\r\nSultan,—knowest thou not these august characters?\" And Hassan exhibited\r\nthe brilliantly gilded frontispiece which decorated the firman. \"I know\r\nthem and revere them.\" \"Then bow before thy destiny; make thy ablutions;\r\naddress thy prayer to Allah and to His Prophet; for thy, head is\r\ndemanded. . . .\" Ali did not allow him to finish. \"My head,\" he cried\r\nwith fury, \"will not be surrendered like the head of a slave.\"\r\n\r\nThese rapidly pronounced words were instantly followed by a pistol-shot\r\nwhich wounded Hassan in the thigh. Swift as lightning, a second killed\r\nthe keeper of the wardrobe, and the guards, firing at the same time,\r\nbrought down several officers. Terrified, the Osmanlis forsook the\r\npavilion. Ali, perceiving blood flowing from a wound in his chest,\r\nroared like a bull with rage. No one dared to face his wrath, but shots\r\nwere fired at the kiosk from all sides, and four of his guards fell dead\r\nbeside him. He no longer knew which way to turn, hearing the noise made\r\nby the assailants under the platform, who were firing through the boards\r\non which he stood. A ball wounded him in the side, another from below\r\nlodged in his spine; he staggered, clung to a window, then fell on the\r\nsofa. \"Hasten,\" he cried to one of his officers, \"run, my friend, and\r\nstrangle my poor Basilissa; let her not fall a prey to these infamous\r\nwretches.\"\r\n\r\nThe door opened, all resistance ceased, the guards hastened to escape by\r\nthe windows. Kursheed’s sword-bearer entered, followed by the\r\nexecutioners. \"Let the justice of Allah be accomplished!\" said a cadi.\r\nAt these words the executioners seized Ali, who was still alive, by the\r\nbeard, and dragged him out into the porch, where, placing his head on\r\none of the steps, they separated it from the body with many blows of a\r\njagged cutlass. Thus ended the career of the dreaded Ali Pacha.\r\n\r\nHis head still preserved so terrible and imposing an aspect that those\r\npresent beheld it with a sort of stupor. Kursheed, to whom it was\r\npresented on a large dish of silver plate, rose to receive it, bowed\r\nthree times before it, and respectfully kissed the beard, expressing\r\naloud his wish that he himself might deserve a similar end. To such an\r\nextent did the admiration with which Ali’s bravery inspired these\r\nbarbarians efface the memory of his crimes. Kursheed ordered the head to\r\nbe perfumed with the most costly essences, and despatched to\r\nConstantinople, and he allowed the Skipetars to render the last honours\r\nto their former master.\r\n\r\nNever was seen greater mourning than that of the warlike Epirotes.\r\nDuring the whole night, the various Albanian tribes watched by turns\r\naround the corpse, improvising the most eloquent funeral songs in its\r\nhonour. At daybreak, the body, washed and prepared according to the\r\nMohammedan ritual, was deposited in a coffin draped with a splendid\r\nIndian Cashmere shawl, on which was placed a magnificent turban, adorned\r\nwith the plumes Ali had worn in battle. The mane of his charger was cut\r\noff, and the animal covered with purple housings, while Ali’s shield,\r\nhis sword, his numerous weapons, and various insignia, were borne on the\r\nsaddles of several led horses. The cortege proceeded towards the castle,\r\naccompanied by hearty imprecations uttered by the soldiers against the\r\n\"Son of a Slave,\" the epithet bestowed on their sultan by the Turks in\r\nseasons of popular excitement.\r\n\r\nThe Selaon-Aga, an officer appointed to render the proper salutes, acted\r\nas chief mourner, surrounded by weeping mourners, who made the ruins of\r\nJanina echo with their lamentations. The guns were fired at long\r\nintervals. The portcullis was raised to admit the procession, and the\r\nwhole garrison, drawn up to receive it, rendered a military salute. The\r\nbody, covered with matting, was laid in a grave beside that of Amina.\r\nWhen the grave had been filled in, a priest approached to listen to the\r\nsupposed conflict between the good and bad angels, who dispute the\r\npossession of the soul of the deceased. When he at length announced that\r\nAli Tepelen Zadi would repose in peace amid celestial houris, the\r\nSkipetars, murmuring like the waves of the sea after a tempest,\r\ndispersed to their quarters:\r\n\r\nKursheed, profiting by the night spent by the Epirotes in mourning,\r\ncaused Ali’s head to be en closed in a silver casket, and despatched it\r\nsecretly to Constantinople. His sword-bearer Mehemet, who, having\r\npresided at the execution, was entrusted with the further duty of\r\npresenting it to the sultan, was escorted by three hundred Turkish\r\nsoldiers. He was warned to be expeditious, and before dawn was well out\r\nof reach of the Arnaouts, from whom a surprise might have been feared.\r\n\r\nThe Seraskier then ordered the unfortunate Basilissa, whose life had\r\nbeen spared, to be brought before him. She threw herself at his feet,\r\nimploring him to spare, not her life, but her honour; and he consoled\r\nher, and assured her of the sultan’s protection. She burst into tears\r\nwhen she beheld Ali’s secretaries, treasurers, and steward loaded with\r\nirons. Only sixty thousand purses (about twenty-five million piastres)\r\nof Ali’s treasure could be found, and already his officers had been\r\ntortured, in order to compel them to disclose where the rest might be\r\nconcealed. Fearing a similar fate, Basilissa fell insensible into the\r\narms of her attendants, and she was removed to the farm of Bouila, until\r\nthe Supreme Porte should decide on her fate.\r\n\r\nThe couriers sent in all directions to announce the death of Ali, having\r\npreceded the sword-bearer Mehemet’s triumphal procession, the latter, on\r\narriving at Greveno, found the whole population of that town and the\r\nneighbouring hamlets assembled to meet him, eager to behold the head of\r\nthe terrible Ali Pacha. Unable to comprehend how he could possibly have\r\nsuccumbed, they could hardly believe their eyes when the head was\r\nwithdrawn from its casket and displayed before them. It remained exposed\r\nto view in the house of the Mussulman Veli Aga whilst the escort partook\r\nof refreshment and changed horses, and as the public curiosity continued\r\nto increase throughout the journey, a fixed charge was at length made\r\nfor its gratification, and the head of the renowned vizier was degraded\r\ninto becoming an article of traffic exhibited at every post-house, until\r\nit arrived at Constantinople.\r\n\r\nThe sight of this dreaded relic, exposed on the 23rd of February at the\r\ngate of the seraglio, and the birth of an heir-presumptive to the sword\r\nof Othman—which news was announced simultaneously with that of the death\r\nof Ali, by the firing of the guns of the seraglio—roused the enthusiasm\r\nof the military inhabitants of Constantinople to a state of frenzy, and\r\ntriumphant shouts greeted the appearance of a document affixed to the\r\nhead which narrated Ali’s crimes and the circumstances of his death,\r\nending with these words: \"This is the Head of the above-named Ali Pacha,\r\na Traitor to the Faith of Islam.\"\r\n\r\nHaving sent magnificent presents to Kursheed, and a hyperbolical\r\ndespatch to his army, Mahmoud II turned his attention to Asia Minor;\r\nwhere Ali’s sons would probably have been forgotten in their banishment,\r\nhad it not been supposed that their riches were great. A sultan does not\r\ncondescend to mince matters with his slaves, when he can despoil them\r\nwith impunity; His Supreme Highness simply sent them his commands to\r\ndie. Veli Pacha, a greater coward than a woman-slave born in the harem,\r\nheard his sentence kneeling. The wretch who had, in his palace at Arta,\r\ndanced to the strains of a lively orchestra, while innocent victims were\r\nbeing tortured around him, received the due reward of his crimes. He\r\nvainly embraced the knees of his executioners, imploring at least the\r\nfavour of dying in privacy; and he must have endured the full bitterness\r\nof death in seeing his sons strangled before his eyes, Mehemet the\r\nelder, remarkable, for his beauty, and the gentle Selim, whose merits\r\nmight have procured the pardon of his family had not Fate ordained\r\notherwise. After next beholding the execution of his brother, Salik\r\nPacha, Ali’s best loved son, whom a Georgian slave had borne to him in\r\nhis old age, Veli, weeping, yielded his guilty head to the executioners.\r\n\r\nHis women were then seized, and the unhappy Zobeide, whose scandalous\r\nstory had even reached Constantinople, sewn up in a leather sack, was\r\nflung into the Pursak—a river whose waters mingle with those of the\r\nSagaris. Katherin, Veli’s other wife, and his daughters by various\r\nmothers, were dragged to the bazaar and sold ignominiously to Turcoman\r\nshepherds, after which the executioners at once proceeded to make an\r\ninventory of the spoils of their victims.\r\n\r\nBut the inheritance of Mouktar Pacha was not quite such an easy prey.\r\nThe kapidgi-bachi who dared to present him with the bowstring was\r\ninstantly laid dead at his feet by a pistol-shot. \"Wretch!\" cried\r\nMouktar, roaring like a bull escaped from the butcher, \"dost thou think\r\nan Arnaout dies like an eunuch? I also am a Tepelenian! To arms,\r\ncomrades! they would slay us!\" As he spoke, he rushed, sword in hand,\r\nupon the Turks, and driving them back, succeeded in barricading himself\r\nin his apartments.\r\n\r\nPresently a troop of janissaries from Koutaieh, ordered to be in\r\nreadiness, advanced, hauling up cannon, and a stubborn combat began.\r\nMouktar’s frail defences were soon in splinters. The venerable\r\nMetche-Bono, father of Elmas Bey, faithful to the end, was killed by a\r\nbullet; and Mouktar, having slain a host of enemies with his own hand\r\nand seen all his friends perish, himself riddled with wounds, set fire\r\nto the powder magazine, and died, leaving as inheritance for the sultan\r\nonly a heap of smoking ruins. An enviable fate, if compared with that of\r\nhis father and brothers, who died by the hand of the executioner.\r\n\r\nThe heads of Ali’s children, sent to Constantinople and exposed at the\r\ngate of the seraglio, astonished the gaping multitude. The sultan\r\nhimself, struck with the beauty of Mehemet and Selim, whose long\r\neyelashes and closed eyelids gave them the appearance of beautiful\r\nyouths sunk in peaceful slumber, experienced a feeling of emotion. \"I\r\nhad imagined them,\" he said stupidly, \"to be quite as old as their\r\nfather;\" and he expressed sorrow for the fate to which he had condemned\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*THE COUNTESS DE SAINT-GERAN—1639*\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the end of the year 1639, a troop of horsemen arrived, towards\r\nmidday, in a little village at the northern extremity of the province of\r\nAuvergne, from the direction of Paris. The country folk assembled at the\r\nnoise, and found it to proceed from the provost of the mounted police\r\nand his men. The heat was excessive, the horses were bathed in sweat,\r\nthe horsemen covered with dust, and the party seemed on its return from\r\nan important expedition. A man left the escort, and asked an old woman\r\nwho was spinning at her door if there was not an inn in the place. The\r\nwoman and her children showed him a bush hanging over a door at the end\r\nof the only street in the village, and the escort recommenced its march\r\nat a walk. There was noticed, among the mounted men, a young man of\r\ndistinguished appearance and richly dressed, who appeared to be a\r\nprisoner. This discovery redoubled the curiosity of the villagers, who\r\nfollowed the cavalcade as far as the door of the wine-shop. The host\r\ncame out, cap in hand, and the provost enquired of him with a swaggering\r\nair if his pothouse was large enough to accommodate his troop, men and\r\nhorses. The host replied that he had the best wine in the country to\r\ngive to the king’s servants, and that it would be easy to collect in the\r\nneighbourhood litter and forage enough for their horses. The provost\r\nlistened contemptuously to these fine promises, gave the necessary\r\norders as to what was to be done, and slid off his horse, uttering an\r\noath proceeding from heat and fatigue. The horsemen clustered round the\r\nyoung man: one held his stirrup, and the provost deferentially gave way\r\nto him to enter the inn first. No, more doubt could be entertained that\r\nhe was a prisoner of importance, and all kinds of conjectures were made.\r\nThe men maintained that he must be charged with a great crime, otherwise\r\na young nobleman of his rank would never have been arrested; the women\r\nargued, on the contrary, that it was impossible for such a pretty youth\r\nnot to be innocent.\r\n\r\nInside the inn all was bustle: the serving-lads ran from cellar to\r\ngarret; the host swore and despatched his servant-girls to the\r\nneighbours, and the hostess scolded her daughter, flattening her nose\r\nagainst the panes of a downstairs window to admire the handsome youth.\r\n\r\nThere were two tables in the principal eating-room. The provost took\r\npossession of one, leaving the other to the soldiers, who went in turn\r\nto tether their horses under a shed in the back yard; then he pointed to\r\na stool for the prisoner, and seated himself opposite to him, rapping\r\nthe table with his thick cane.\r\n\r\n\"Ouf!\" he cried, with a fresh groan of weariness, \"I heartily beg your\r\npardon, marquis, for the bad wine I am giving you!\"\r\n\r\nThe young man smiled gaily.\r\n\r\n\"The wine is all very well, monsieur provost,\" said he, \"but I cannot\r\nconceal from you that however agreeable your company is to me, this halt\r\nis very inconvenient; I am in a hurry to get through my ridiculous\r\nsituation, and I should have liked to arrive in time to stop this affair\r\nat once.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl of the house was standing before the table with a pewter pot\r\nwhich she had just brought, and at these words she raised her eyes on\r\nthe prisoner, with a reassured look which seemed to say, \"I was sure\r\nthat he was innocent.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" continued the marquis, carrying the glass to his lips, \"this wine\r\nis not so bad as you say, monsieur provost.\"\r\n\r\nThen turning to the girl, who was eyeing his gloves and his ruff—\r\n\r\n\"To your health, pretty child.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said the provost, amazed at this free and easy air, \"perhaps I\r\nshall have to beg you to excuse your sleeping quarters.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed the marquis, \"do we sleep here?\"\r\n\r\n\"My lord;\" said the provost, \"we have sixteen long leagues to make, our\r\nhorses are done up, and so far as I am concerned I declare that I am no\r\nbetter than my horse.\"\r\n\r\nThe marquis knocked on the table, and gave every indication of being\r\ngreatly annoyed. The provost meanwhile puffed and blowed, stretched out\r\nhis big boots, and mopped his forehead with his handkerchief. He was a\r\nportly man, with a puffy face, whom fatigue rendered singularly\r\nuncomfortable.\r\n\r\n\"Marquis,\" said he, \"although your company, which affords me the\r\nopportunity of showing you some attention, is very precious to me, you\r\ncannot doubt that I had much rather enjoy it on another footing. If it\r\nbe within your power, as you say, to release yourself from the hands of\r\njustice, the sooner you do so the better I shall be pleased. But I beg\r\nyou to consider the state we are in. For my part, I am unfit to keep the\r\nsaddle another hour, and are you not yourself knocked up by this forced\r\nmarch in the great heat?\"\r\n\r\n\"True, so I am,\" said the marquis, letting his arms fall by his side.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, let us rest here, sup here, if we can, and we will start\r\nquite fit in the cool of the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Agreed,\" replied the marquis; \"but then let us pass the time in a\r\nbecoming manner. I have two pistoles left, let them be given to these\r\ngood fellows to drink. It is only fair that I should treat them, seeing\r\nthat I am the cause of giving them so much trouble.\"\r\n\r\nHe threw two pieces of money on the table of the soldiers, who cried in\r\nchorus, \"Long live M. the marquis!\" The provost rose, went to post\r\nsentinels, and then repaired to the kitchen, where he ordered the best\r\nsupper that could be got. The men pulled out dice and began to drink and\r\nplay. The marquis hummed an air in the middle of the room, twirled his\r\nmoustache, turning on his heel and looking cautiously around; then he\r\ngently drew a purse from his trousers pocket, and as the daughter of the\r\nhouse was coming and going, he threw his arms round her neck as if to\r\nkiss her, and whispered, slipping ten Louis into her hand—\r\n\r\n\"The key of the front door in my room, and a quart of liquor to the\r\nsentinels, and you save my life.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl went backwards nearly to the door, and returning with an\r\nexpressive look, made an affirmative sign with her hand. The provost\r\nreturned, and two hours later supper was served. He ate and drank like a\r\nman more at home at table than in the saddle. The marquis plied him with\r\nbumpers, and sleepiness, added to the fumes of a very heady wine, caused\r\nhim to repeat over and over again—\r\n\r\n\"Confound it all, marquis, I can’t believe you are such a blackguard as\r\nthey say you are; you seem to me a jolly good sort.\"\r\n\r\nThe marquis thought he was ready to fall under the table, and was\r\nbeginning to open negotiations with the daughter of the house, when, to\r\nhis great disappointment, bedtime having come, the provoking provost\r\ncalled his sergeant, gave him instructions in an undertone, and\r\nannounced that he should have the honour of conducting M. the marquis to\r\nbed, and that he should not go to bed himself before performing this\r\nduty. In fact, he posted three of his men, with torches, escorted the\r\nprisoner to his room, and left him with many profound bows.\r\n\r\nThe marquis threw himself on his bed without pulling off his boots,\r\nlistening to a clock which struck nine. He heard the men come and go in\r\nthe stables and in the yard.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, everybody being tired, all was perfectly still. The\r\nprisoner then rose softly, and felt about on tiptoe on the chimneypiece,\r\non the furniture, and even in his clothes, for the key which he hoped to\r\nfind. He could not find it. He could not be mistaken, nevertheless, in\r\nthe tender interest of the young girl, and he could not believe that she\r\nwas deceiving him. The marquis’s room had a window which opened upon the\r\nstreet, and a door which gave access to a shabby gallery which did duty\r\nfor a balcony, whence a staircase ascended to the principal rooms of the\r\nhouse. This gallery hung over the courtyard, being as high above it as\r\nthe window was from the street. The marquis had only to jump over one\r\nside or the other: he hesitated for some time, and just as he was\r\ndeciding to leap into the street, at the risk of breaking his neck, two\r\ntaps were struck on the door. He jumped for joy, saying to himself as he\r\nopened, \"I am saved!\" A kind of shadow glided into the room; the young\r\ngirl trembled from head to foot, and could not say a word. The marquis\r\nreassured her with all sorts of caresses.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, sir,\" said she, \"I am dead if we are surprised.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the marquis, \"but your fortune is made if you get me out of\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"God is my witness that I would with all my soul, but I have such a bad\r\npiece of news——\"\r\n\r\nShe stopped, suffocated with varying emotions. The poor girl had come\r\nbarefooted, for fear of making a noise, and appeared to be shivering.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" impatiently asked the marquis.\r\n\r\n\"Before going to bed,\" she continued, \"M. the provost has required from\r\nmy father all the keys of the house, and has made him take a great oath\r\nthat there are no more. My father has given him all: besides, there is a\r\nsentinel at every door; but they are very tired; I have heard them\r\nmuttering and grumbling, and I have given them more wine than you told\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"They will sleep,\" said the marquis, nowise discouraged, \"and they have\r\nalready shown great respect to my rank in not nailing me up in this\r\nroom.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a small kitchen garden,\" continued the girl, \"on the side of\r\nthe fields, fenced in only by a loose hurdle, but——\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is my horse?\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt in the shed with the rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will jump into the yard.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will be killed.\"\r\n\r\n\"So much the better!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah monsieur marquis, what have, you done?\" said the young girl with\r\ngrief.\r\n\r\n\"Some foolish things! nothing worth mentioning; but my head and my\r\nhonour are at stake. Let us lose no time; I have made up my mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay,\" replied the girl, grasping his arm; \"at the left-hand corner of\r\nthe yard there is a large heap of straw, the gallery hangs just over\r\nit—\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravo! I shall make less noise, and do myself less mischief.\" He made a\r\nstep towards the door; the girl, hardly knowing what she was doing,\r\ntried to detain him; but he got loose from her and opened it. The moon\r\nwas shining brightly into the yard; he heard no sound. He proceeded to\r\nthe end of the wooden rail, and perceived the dungheap, which rose to a\r\ngood height: the girl made the sign of the cross. The marquis listened\r\nonce again, heard nothing, and mounted the rail. He was about to jump\r\ndown, when by wonderful luck he heard murmurings from a deep voice. This\r\nproceeded from one of two horsemen, who were recommencing their\r\nconversation and passing between them a pint of wine. The marquis crept\r\nback to his door, holding his breath: the girl was awaiting him on the\r\nthreshold.\r\n\r\n\"I told you it was not yet time,\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"Have you never a knife,\" said the marquis, \"to cut those rascals’\r\nthroats with?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait, I entreat you, one hour, one hour only,\" murmured the young girl;\r\n\"in an hour they will all be asleep.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl’s voice was so sweet, the arms which she stretched towards him\r\nwere full of such gentle entreaty, that the marquis waited, and at the\r\nend of an hour it was the young girl’s turn to tell him to start.\r\n\r\nThe marquis for the last time pressed with his mouth those lips but\r\nlately so innocent, then he half opened the door, and heard nothing this\r\ntime but dogs barking far away in an otherwise silent country. He leaned\r\nover the balustrade, and saw: very plainly a soldier lying prone on the\r\nstraw.\r\n\r\n\"If they were to awake?\" murmured the young girl in accents of anguish.\r\n\r\n\"They will not take me alive, be assured,\" said the marquis.\r\n\r\n\"Adieu, then,\" replied she, sobbing; \"may Heaven preserve you!\"\r\n\r\nHe bestrode the balustrade, spread himself out upon it, and fell heavily\r\non the dungheap. The young girl saw him run to the shed, hastily detach\r\na horse, pass behind the stable wall, spur his horse in both flanks,\r\ntear across the kitchen garden, drive his horse against the hurdle,\r\nknock it down, clear it, and reach the highroad across the fields.\r\n\r\nThe poor girl remained at the end of the gallery, fixing her eyes on the\r\nsleeping sentry, and ready to disappear at the slightest movement. The\r\nnoise made by spurs on the pavement and by the horse at the end of the\r\ncourtyard had half awakened him. He rose, and suspecting some surprise,\r\nran to the shed. His horse was no longer there; the marquis, in his\r\nhaste to escape, had taken the first which came to hand, and this was\r\nthe soldier’s. Then the soldier gave the alarm; his comrades woke up.\r\nThey ran to the prisoner’s room, and found it empty. The provost came\r\nfrom his bed in a dazed condition. The prisoner had escaped.\r\n\r\nThen the young girl, pretending to have been roused by the noise,\r\nhindered the preparations by mislaying the saddlery, impeding the\r\nhorsemen instead of helping them; nevertheless, after a quarter of an\r\nhour, all the party were galloping along the road. The provost swore\r\nlike a pagan. The best horses led the way, and the sentinel, who rode\r\nthe marquis’s, and who had a greater interest in catching the prisoner,\r\nfar outstripped his companions; he was followed by the sergeant, equally\r\nwell mounted, and as the broken fence showed the line he had taken,\r\nafter some minutes they were in view of him, but at a great distance.\r\nHowever, the marquis was losing ground; the horse he had taken was the\r\nworst in the troop, and he had pressed it as hard as it could go.\r\nTurning in the saddle, he saw the soldiers half a musket-shot off; he\r\nurged his horse more and more, tearing his sides with his spurs; but\r\nshortly the beast, completely winded, foundered; the marquis rolled with\r\nit in the dust, but when rolling over he caught hold of the holsters,\r\nwhich he found to contain pistols; he lay flat by the side of the horse,\r\nas if he had fainted, with a pistol at full cock in his hand. The\r\nsentinel, mounted on a valuable horse, and more than two hundred yards\r\nahead of his serafile, came up to him. In a moment the marquis, jumping\r\nup before he had time to resist him, shot him through the head; the\r\nhorseman fell, the marquis jumped up in his place without even setting\r\nfoot in the stirrup, started off at a gallop, and went away like the\r\nwind, leaving fifty yards behind him the non-commissioned officer,\r\ndumbfounded with what had just passed before his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe main body of the escort galloped up, thinking that he was taken; and\r\nthe provost shouted till he was hoarse, \"Do not kill him!\" But they\r\nfound only the sergeant, trying to restore life to his man, whose skull\r\nwas shattered, and who lay dead on the spot.\r\n\r\nAs for the marquis, he was out of sight; for, fearing a fresh pursuit,\r\nhe had plunged into the cross roads, along which he rode a good hour\r\nlonger at full gallop. When he felt pretty sure of having shaken the\r\npolice off his track, and that their bad horses could not overtake him,\r\nhe determined to slacken to recruit his horse; he was walking him along\r\na hollow lane, when he saw a peasant approaching; he asked him the road\r\nto the Bourbonnais, and flung him a crown. The man took the crown and\r\npointed out the road, but he seemed hardly to know what he was saying,\r\nand stared at the marquis in a strange manner. The marquis shouted to\r\nhim to get out of the way; but the peasant remained planted on the\r\nroadside without stirring an inch. The marquis advanced with threatening\r\nlooks, and asked how he dared to stare at him like that.\r\n\r\n\"The reason is,\" said the peasant, \"that you have——\", and he pointed to\r\nhis shoulder and his ruff.\r\n\r\nThe marquis glanced at his dress, and saw that his coat was dabbled in\r\nblood, which, added to the disorder of his clothes and the dust with\r\nwhich he was covered, gave him a most suspicious aspect.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" said he. \"I and my servant have been separated in a scuffle\r\nwith some drunken Germans; it’s only a tipsy spree, and whether I have\r\ngot scratched, or whether in collaring one of these fellows I have drawn\r\nsome of his blood, it all arises from the row. I don’t think I am hurt a\r\nbit.\" So saying, he pretended to feel all over his body.\r\n\r\n\"All the same,\" he continued, \"I should not be sorry to have a wash;\r\nbesides, I am dying with thirst and heat, and my horse is in no better\r\ncase. Do you know where I can rest and refresh myself?\"\r\n\r\nThe peasant offered to guide him to his own house, only a few yards off.\r\nHis wife and children, who were working, respectfully stood aside, and\r\nwent to collect what was wanted—wine, water, fruit, and a large piece of\r\nblack bread. The marquis sponged his coat, drank a glass of wine, and\r\ncalled the people of the house, whom he questioned in an indifferent\r\nmanner. He once more informed himself of the different roads leading\r\ninto the Bourbonnais province, where he was going to visit a relative;\r\nof the villages, cross roads, distances; and finally he spoke of the\r\ncountry, the harvest, and asked what news there was.\r\n\r\nThe peasant replied, with regard to this, that it was surprising to hear\r\nof disturbances on the highway at this moment, when it was patrolled by\r\ndetachments of mounted police, who had just made an important capture.\r\n\r\n\"Who is that?—\" asked the marquis.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said the peasant, \"a nobleman who has done a lot of mischief in\r\nthe country.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! a nobleman in the hands of justice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so; and he stands a good chance of losing his head.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do they say what he has done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shocking things; horrid things; everything he shouldn’t do. All the\r\nprovince is exasperated with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know him?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but we all have his description.\"\r\n\r\nAs this news was not encouraging, the marquis, after a few more\r\nquestions, saw to his horse, patted him, threw some more money to the\r\npeasant, and disappeared in the direction pointed out.\r\n\r\nThe provost proceeded half a league farther along the road; but coming\r\nto the conclusion that pursuit was useless, he sent one of his men to\r\nheadquarters, to warn all the points of exit from the province, and\r\nhimself returned with his troop to the place whence he had started in\r\nthe morning. The marquis had relatives in the neighbourhood, and it was\r\nquite possible that he might seek shelter with some of them. All the\r\nvillage ran to meet the horsemen, who were obliged to confess that they\r\nhad been duped by the handsome prisoner. Different views were expressed\r\non the event, which gave rise to much talking. The provost entered the\r\ninn, banging his fist on the furniture, and blaming everybody for the\r\nmisfortune which had happened to him. The daughter of the house, at\r\nfirst a prey to the most grievous anxiety, had great difficulty in\r\nconcealing her joy.\r\n\r\nThe provost spread his papers over the table, as if to nurse his\r\nill-temper.\r\n\r\n\"The biggest rascal in the world!\" he cried; \"I ought to have suspected\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a handsome man he was!\" said the hostess.\r\n\r\n\"A consummate rascal! Do you know who he is? He is the Marquis de\r\nSaint-Maixent!\"\r\n\r\n\"The Marquis de Saint-Maixent!\" all cried with horror.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the very man,\" replied the provost; \"the Marquis de Saint-Maixent,\r\naccused, and indeed convicted, of coining and magic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\"\r\n\r\n\"Convicted of incest.\"\r\n\r\n\"O my God!\"\r\n\r\n\"Convicted of having strangled his wife to marry another, whose husband\r\nhe had first stabbed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heaven help us!\" All crossed themselves.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, good people,\" continued the furious provost, \"this is the nice boy\r\nwho has just escaped the king’s justice!\"\r\n\r\nThe host’s daughter left the room, for she felt she was going to faint.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said the host, \"is there no hope of catching him again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not the slightest, if he has taken the road to the Bourbonnais; for I\r\nbelieve there are in that province noblemen belonging to his family who\r\nwill not allow him to be rearrested.\"\r\n\r\nThe fugitive was, indeed, no other than the Marquis de Saint-Maixent,\r\naccused of all the enormous crimes detailed by the provost, who by his\r\naudacious flight opened for himself an active part in the strange story\r\nwhich it remains to relate.\r\n\r\nIt came to pass, a fortnight after these events, that a mounted\r\ngentleman rang at the wicket gate of the chateau de Saint-Geran, at the\r\ngates of Moulins. It was late, and the servants were in no hurry to\r\nopen. The stranger again pulled the bell in a masterful manner, and at\r\nlength perceived a man running from the bottom of the avenue. The\r\nservant peered through the wicket, and making out in the twilight a very\r\nill-appointed traveller, with a crushed hat, dusty clothes, and no\r\nsword, asked him what he wanted, receiving a blunt reply that the\r\nstranger wished to see the Count de Saint-Geran without any further loss\r\nof time. The servant replied that this was impossible; the other got\r\ninto a passion.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" asked the man in livery.\r\n\r\n\"You are a very ceremonious fellow!\" cried the horseman. \"Go and tell M.\r\nde Saint-Geran that his relative, the Marquis de Saint-Maixent, wishes\r\nto see him at once.\"\r\n\r\nThe servant made humble apologies, and opened the wicket gate. He then\r\nwalked before the marquis, called other servants, who came to help him\r\nto dismount, and ran to give his name in the count’s apartments. The\r\nlatter was about to sit down to supper when his relative was announced;\r\nhe immediately went to receive the marquis, embraced him again and\r\nagain, and gave him the most friendly and gracious reception possible.\r\nHe wished then to take him into the dining-room to present him to all\r\nthe family; but the marquis called his attention to the disorder of his\r\ndress, and begged for a few minutes’ conversation. The count took him\r\ninto his dressing-room, and had him dressed from head to foot in his own\r\nclothes, whilst they talked. The marquis then narrated a made-up story\r\nto M. de Saint-Geran relative to the accusation brought against him.\r\nThis greatly impressed his relative, and gave him a secure footing in\r\nthe chateau. When he had finished dressing, he followed the count, who\r\npresented him to the countess and the rest of the family.\r\n\r\nIt will now be in place to state who the inmates of the chateau were,\r\nand to relate some previous occurrences to explain subsequent ones.\r\n\r\nThe Marshal de Saint-Geran, of the illustrious house of Guiche, and\r\ngovernor of the Bourbonnais, had married, for his first wife, Anne de\r\nTournon, by whom he had one son, Claude de la Guiche, and one daughter,\r\nwho married the Marquis de Bouille. His wife dying, he married again\r\nwith Suzanne des Epaules, who had also been previously married, being\r\nthe widow of the Count de Longaunay, by whom she had Suzanne de\r\nLongaunay.\r\n\r\nThe marshal and his wife, Suzanne des Epauies, for the mutual benefit of\r\ntheir children by first nuptials, determined to marry them, thus sealing\r\ntheir own union with a double tie. Claude de Guiche, the marshal’s son,\r\nmarried Suzanne de Longaunay.\r\n\r\nThis alliance was much to the distaste of the Marchioness de Bouille,\r\nthe marshal’s daughter, who found herself separated from her stepmother,\r\nand married to a man who, it was said, gave her great cause for\r\ncomplaint, the greatest being his threescore years and ten.\r\n\r\nThe contract of marriage between Claude de la Guiche and Suzanne de\r\nLongaunay was executed at Rouen on the 17th of February 1619; but the\r\ntender age of the bridegroom, who was then but eighteen, was the cause\r\nof his taking a tour in Italy, whence he returned after two years. The\r\nmarriage was a very happy one but for one circumstance—it produced no\r\nissue. The countess could not endure a barrenness which threatened the\r\nend of a great name, the extinction of a noble race. She made vows,\r\npilgrimages; she consulted doctors and quacks; but to no purpose.\r\n\r\nThe Marshal de Saint-Geran died on the 10th of December 1632, having the\r\nmortification of having seen no descending issue from the marriage of\r\nhis son. The latter, now Count de Saint-Geran, succeeded his father in\r\nthe government of the Bourbonnais, and was named Chevalier of the King’s\r\nOrders.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Marchioness de Bouille quarrelled with her old husband the\r\nmarquis, separated from him after a scandalous divorce, and came to live\r\nat the chateau of Saint-Geran, quite at ease as to her brother’s\r\nmarriage, seeing that in default of heirs all his property would revert\r\nto her.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of affairs when the Marquis de Saint-Maixent arrived\r\nat the chateau. He was young, handsome, very cunning, and very\r\nsuccessful with women; he even made a conquest of the dowager Countess\r\nde Saint-Geran, who lived there with her children. He soon plainly saw\r\nthat he might easily enter into the most intimate relations with the\r\nMarchioness de Bouille.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis de Saint-Maixent’s own fortune was much impaired by his\r\nextravagance and by the exactions of the law, or rather, in plain words,\r\nhe had lost it all. The marchioness was heiress presumptive to the\r\ncount: he calculated that she would soon lose her own husband; in any\r\ncase, the life of a septuagenarian did not much trouble a man like the\r\nmarquis; he could then prevail upon the marchioness to marry him, thus\r\ngiving him the command of the finest fortune in the province.\r\n\r\nHe set to work to pay his court to her, especially avoiding anything\r\nthat could excite the slightest suspicion. It was, however, difficult to\r\nget on good terms with the marchioness without showing outsiders what\r\nwas going on. But the marchioness, already prepossessed by the agreeable\r\nexterior of M. de Saint-Maixent, soon fell into his toils, and the\r\nunhappiness of her marriage, with the annoyances incidental to a\r\nscandalous case in the courts, left her powerless to resist his schemes.\r\nNevertheless, they had but few opportunities of seeing one’ another\r\nalone: the countess innocently took a part in all their conversations;\r\nthe count often came to take the marquis out hunting; the days passed in\r\nfamily pursuits. M. de Saint-Maixent had not so far had an opportunity\r\nof saying what a discreet woman ought to pretend not to hear; this\r\nintrigue, notwithstanding the marquis’s impatience, dragged terribly.\r\n\r\nThe countess, as has been stated, had for twenty years never ceased to\r\nhope that her prayers would procure for her the grace of bearing a son\r\nto her husband. Out of sheer weariness she had given herself up to all\r\nkinds of charlatans, who at that period were well received by people of\r\nrank. On one occasion she brought from Italy a sort of astrologer, who\r\nas nearly as possible poisoned her with a horrible nostrum, and was sent\r\nback to his own country in a hurry, thanking his stars for having\r\nescaped so cheaply. This procured Madame de Saint-Geran a severe\r\nreprimand from her confessor; and, as time went on, she gradually\r\naccustomed herself to the painful conclusion that she would die\r\nchildless, and cast herself into the arms of religion. The count, whose\r\ntenderness for her never failed, yet clung to the hope of an heir, and\r\nmade his Will with this in view. The marchioness’s hopes had become\r\ncertainties, and M. de Saint-Maixent, perfectly tranquil on this head,\r\nthought only of forwarding his suit with Madame-de Bouille, when, at the\r\nend of the month of November 1640, the Count de Saint-Geran was obliged\r\nto repair to Paris in great haste on pressing duty.\r\n\r\nThe countess, who could not bear to be separated from her husband, took\r\nthe family advice as to accompanying him. The marquis, delighted at an\r\nopportunity which left him almost alone in the chateau with Madame de\r\nBouille, painted the journey to Paris in the most attractive colours,\r\nand said all he could to decide her to go. The marchioness, for her\r\npart, worked very quietly to the same end; it was more than was needed.\r\nIt was settled that the countess should go with M. de Saint-Geran. She\r\nsoon made her preparations, and a few days later they set off on the\r\njourney together.\r\n\r\nThe marquis had no fears about declaring his passion; the conquest of\r\nMadame de Bouille gave him no trouble; he affected the most violent\r\nlove, and she responded in the same terms. All their time was spent in\r\nexcursions and walks from, which the servants were excluded; the lovers,\r\nalways together, passed whole days in some retired part of the park, or\r\nshut up in their apartments. It was impossible for these circumstances\r\nnot to cause gossip among an army of servants, against whom they had to\r\nkeep incessantly on their guard; and this naturally happened.\r\n\r\nThe marchioness soon found herself obliged to make confidantes of the\r\nsisters Quinet, her maids; she had no difficulty in gaining their\r\nsupport, for the girls were greatly attached to her. This was the first\r\nstep of shame for Madame de Bouille, and the first step of corruption\r\nfor herself and her paramour, who soon found themselves entangled in the\r\nblackest of plots. Moreover, there was at the chateau de Saint-Geran a\r\ntall, spare, yellow, stupid man, just intelligent enough to perform, if\r\nnot to conceive, a bad action, who was placed in authority over the\r\ndomestics; he was a common peasant whom the old marshal had deigned to\r\nnotice, and whom the count had by degrees promoted to the service of\r\nmajor-domo on account of his long service in the house, and because he\r\nhad seen him there since he himself was a child; he would not take him\r\naway as body servant, fearing that his notions of service would not do\r\nfor Paris, and left him to the superintendence of the household. The\r\nmarquis had a quiet talk with this man, took his measure, warped his\r\nmind as he wished, gave him some money, and acquired him body and soul.\r\nThese different agents undertook to stop the chatter of the servants’\r\nhall, and thenceforward the lovers could enjoy free intercourse.\r\n\r\nOne evening, as the Marquis de Saint-Maixent was at supper in company\r\nwith the marchioness, a loud knocking was heard at the gate of the\r\nchateau, to which they paid no great attention. This was followed by the\r\nappearance of a courier who had come post haste from Paris; he entered\r\nthe courtyard with a letter from the Count de Saint-Geran for M. the\r\nmarquis; he was announced and introduced, followed by nearly all the\r\nhousehold. The marquis asked the meaning of all this, and dismissed all\r\nthe following with a wave of the hand; but the courier explained that M.\r\nthe count desired that the letter in his hands should be read before\r\neveryone. The marquis opened it without replying, glanced over it, and\r\nread it out loud without the slightest alteration: the count announced\r\nto his good relations and to all his household that the countess had\r\nindicated positive symptoms of pregnancy; that hardly had she arrived in\r\nParis when she suffered from fainting fits, nausea, retching, that she\r\nbore with joy these premonitory indications, which were no longer a\r\nmatter of doubt to the physicians, nor to anyone; that for his part he\r\nwas overwhelmed with joy at this event, which was the crowning stroke to\r\nall his wishes; that he desired the chateau to share his satisfaction by\r\nindulging in all kinds of gaieties; and that so far as other matters\r\nwere concerned they could remain as they were till the return of himself\r\nand the countess, which the letter would precede only a few days, as he\r\nwas going to transport her in a litter for greater safety. Then followed\r\nthe specification of certain sums of money to be distributed among the\r\nservants.\r\n\r\nThe servants uttered cries of joy; the marquis and marchioness exchanged\r\na look, but a very troublous one; they, however, restrained themselves\r\nso far as to simulate a great satisfaction, and the marquis brought\r\nhimself to congratulate the servants on their attachment to their master\r\nand mistress. After this they were left alone, looking very serious,\r\nwhile crackers exploded and violins resounded under the windows. For\r\nsome time they preserved silence, the first thought which occurred to\r\nboth being that the count and countess had allowed themselves to be\r\ndeceived by trifling symptoms, that people had wished to flatter their\r\nhopes, that it was impossible for a constitution to change so suddenly\r\nafter twenty years, and that it was a case of simulative pregnancy. This\r\nopinion gaining strength in their minds made them somewhat calmer.\r\n\r\nThe next day they took a walk side by side in a solitary path in the\r\npark and discussed the chances of their situation. M. de Saint-Maixent\r\nbrought before the marchioness the enormous injury which this event\r\nwould bring them. He then said that even supposing the news to be true,\r\nthere were many rocks ahead to be weathered before the succession could\r\nbe pronounced secure.\r\n\r\n\"The child may die,\" he said at last.\r\n\r\nAnd he uttered some sinister expressions on the slight damage caused by\r\nthe loss of a puny creature without mind, interest, or consequence;\r\nnothing, he said, but a bit of ill-organised matter, which only came\r\ninto the world to ruin so considerable a person as the marchioness.\r\n\r\n\"But what is the use of tormenting ourselves?\" he went on impatiently;\r\n\"the countess is not pregnant, nor can she be.\"\r\n\r\nA gardener working near them overheard this part of the conversation,\r\nbut as they walked away from him he could not hear any more.\r\n\r\nA few days later, some outriders, sent before him by the count, entered\r\nthe chateau, saying that their master and mistress were close at hand.\r\nIn fact, they were promptly followed by brakes and travelling-carriages,\r\nand at length the countess’s litter was descried, which M. de\r\nSaint-Geran, on horse back, had never lost sight of during the journey.\r\nIt was a triumphal reception: all the peasants had left their work, and\r\nfilled the air with shouts of welcome; the servants ran to meet their\r\nmistress; the ancient retainers wept for joy at seeing the count so\r\nhappy and in the hope that his noble qualities might be perpetuated in\r\nhis heir. The marquis and Madame de Bouille did their best to tune up to\r\nthe pitch of this hilarity.\r\n\r\nThe dowager countess, who had arrived at the chateau the same day,\r\nunable to convince herself as to this news, had the pleasure of\r\nsatisfying her self respecting it. The count and countess were much\r\nbeloved in the Bourbonnais province; this event caused therein a general\r\nsatisfaction, particularly in the numerous houses attached to them by\r\nconsanguinity. Within a few days of their return, more than twenty\r\nladies of quality flocked to visit them in great haste, to show the\r\ngreat interest they took in this pregnancy. All these ladies, on one\r\noccasion or another, convinced themselves as to its genuineness, and\r\nmany of them, carrying the subject still further, in a joking manner\r\nwhich pleased the countess, dubbed themselves prophetesses, and\r\npredicted the birth of a boy. The usual symptoms incidental to the\r\nsituation left no room for doubt: the country physicians were all\r\nagreed. The count kept one of these physicians in the chateau for two\r\nmonths, and spoke to the Marquis of Saint-Maixent of his intention of\r\nprocuring a good mid-wife, on the same terms. Finally, the dowager\r\ncountess, who was to be sponsor, ordered at a great expense a\r\nmagnificent store of baby linen, which she desired to present at the\r\nbirth.\r\n\r\nThe marchioness devoured her rage, and among the persons who went beside\r\nthemselves with joy not one remarked the disappointment which overspread\r\nher soul. Every day she saw the marquis, who did all he could to\r\nincrease her regret, and incessantly stirred up her ill-humour by\r\nrepeating that the count and countess were triumphing over her\r\nmisfortune, and insinuating that they were importing a supposititious\r\nchild to disinherit her. As usual both in private and political affairs,\r\nhe began by corrupting the marchioness’s religious views, to pervert her\r\ninto crime. The marquis was one of those libertines so rare at that\r\ntime, a period less unhappy than is generally believed, who made science\r\ndependent upon, atheism. It is remarkable that great criminals of this\r\nepoch, Sainte-Croix for instance, and Exili, the gloomy poisoner, were\r\nthe first unbelievers, and that they preceded the learned of the\r\nfollowing age both, in philosophy and in the exclusive study of physical\r\nscience, in which they included that of poisons. Passion, interest,\r\nhatred fought the marquis’s battles in the heart of Madame de Bouille;\r\nshe readily lent herself to everything that M. de Saint-Maixent wished.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis de Saint-Maixent had a confidential servant, cunning,\r\ninsolent, resourceful, whom he had brought from his estates, a servant\r\nwell suited to such a master, whom he sent on errands frequently into\r\nthe neighbourhood of Saint-Geran.\r\n\r\nOne evening, as the marquis was about to go to bed, this man, returning\r\nfrom one of his expeditions, entered his room, where he remained for a\r\nlong time, telling him that he had at length found what he wanted, and\r\ngiving him a small piece of paper which contained several names of\r\nplaces and persons.\r\n\r\nNext morning, at daybreak, the marquis caused two of his horses to be\r\nsaddled, pretended that he was summoned home on pressing business,\r\nforesaw that he should be absent for three or four days, made his\r\nexcuses to the count, and set off at full gallop, followed by his\r\nservant.\r\n\r\nThey slept that night at an inn on the road to Auvergne, to put off the\r\nscent any persons who might recognise them; then, following\r\ncross-country roads, they arrived after two days at a large hamlet,\r\nwhich they had seemed to have passed far to their left.\r\n\r\nIn this hamlet was a woman who practised the avocation of midwife, and\r\nwas known as such in the neighbourhood, but who had, it was said,\r\nmysterious and infamous secrets for those who paid her well. Further,\r\nshe drew a good income from the influence which her art gave her over\r\ncredulous people. It was all in her line to cure the king’s evil,\r\ncompound philtres and love potions; she was useful in a variety of ways\r\nto girls who could afford to pay her; she was a lovers’ go-between, and\r\neven practised sorcery for country folk. She played her cards so well,\r\nthat the only persons privy to her misdeeds were unfortunate creatures\r\nwho had as strong an interest as herself in keeping them profoundly\r\nsecret; and as her terms were very high, she lived comfortably enough in\r\na house her own property, and entirely alone, for greater security. In a\r\ngeneral way, she was considered skilful in her ostensible profession,\r\nand was held in estimation by many persons of rank. This woman’s name\r\nwas Louise Goillard.\r\n\r\nAlone one evening after curfew, she heard a loud knocking at the door of\r\nher house. Accustomed to receive visits at all hours, she took her lamp\r\nwithout hesitation, and opened the door. An armed man, apparently much\r\nagitated, entered the room. Louise Goillard, in a great fright, fell\r\ninto a chair; this man was the Marquis de Saint-Maixent.\r\n\r\n\"Calm yourself, good woman,\" said the stranger, panting and stammering;\r\n\"be calm, I beg; for it is I, not you, who have any cause for emotion. I\r\nam not a brigand, and far from your having anything to fear, it is I, on\r\nthe contrary, who am come to beg for your assistance.\"\r\n\r\nHe threw his cloak into a corner, unbuckled his waistbelt, and laid\r\naside his sword. Then falling into a chair, he said—\r\n\r\n\"First of all, let me rest a little.\"\r\n\r\nThe marquis wore a travelling-dress; but although he had not stated his\r\nname, Louise Goillard saw at a glance that he was a very different\r\nperson from what she had thought, and that, on the contrary, he was some\r\nfine gentleman who had come on his love affairs.\r\n\r\n\"I beg you to excuse,\" said she, \"a fear which is insulting to you. You\r\ncame in so hurriedly that I had not time to see whom I was talking to.\r\nMy house is rather lonely; I am alone; ill-disposed people might easily\r\ntake advantage of these circumstances to plunder a poor woman who has\r\nlittle enough to lose. The times are so bad! You seem tired. Will you\r\ninhale some essence?\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me only a glass of water.\"\r\n\r\nLouise Goillard went into the adjoining room, and returned with an ewer.\r\nThe marquis affected to rinse his lips, and said—\r\n\r\n\"I come from a great distance on a most important matter. Be assured\r\nthat I shall be properly grateful for your services.\"\r\n\r\nHe felt in his pocket, and pulled out a purse, which he rolled between\r\nhis fingers.\r\n\r\n\"In the first place; you must swear to the greatest secrecy.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no need of that with us,\" said Louise Goillard; \"that is the\r\nfirst condition of our craft.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must have more express guarantees, and your oath that you will reveal\r\nto no one in the world what I am going to confide to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I give you my word, then, since you demand it; but I repeat that this\r\nis superfluous; you do not know me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Consider that this is a most serious matter, that I am as it were\r\nplacing my head in your hands, and that I would lose my life a thousand\r\ntimes rather than see this mystery unravelled.\"\r\n\r\n\"Consider also,\" bluntly replied the midwife, \"that we ourselves are\r\nprimarily interested in all the secrets entrusted to us; that an\r\nindiscretion would destroy all confidence in us, and that there are even\r\ncases——You may speak.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the marquis had reassured her as to himself by this preface, he\r\ncontinued: \"I know that you are a very able woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could indeed wish to be one, to serve you.\".\r\n\r\n\"That you have pushed the study of your art to its utmost limits.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear they have been flattering your humble servant.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that your studies have enabled you to predict the future.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is all nonsense.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true; I have been told so.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have been imposed upon.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the use of denying it and refusing to do me a service?\"\r\n\r\nLouise Goillard defended herself long: she could not understand a man of\r\nthis quality believing in fortune-telling, which she practised only with\r\nlow-class people and rich farmers; but the marquis appeared so earnest\r\nthat she knew not what to think.\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" said he, \"it is no use dissembling with me, I know all. Be\r\neasy; we are playing a game in which you are laying one against a\r\nthousand; moreover, here is something on account to compensate you for\r\nthe trouble I am giving.\"\r\n\r\nHe laid a pile of gold on the table. The matron weakly owned that she\r\nhad sometimes attempted astrological combinations which were not always\r\nfortunate, and that she had been only induced to do so by the\r\nfascination of the phenomena of science. The secret of her guilty\r\npractices was drawn from her at the very outset of her defence.\r\n\r\n\"That being so,\" replied the marquis, \"you must be already aware of the\r\nsituation in which I find myself; you must know that, hurried away by a\r\nblind and ardent passion, I have betrayed the confidence of an old lady\r\nand violated the laws of hospitality by seducing her daughter in her own\r\nhouse; that matters have come to a crisis, and that this noble damsel,\r\nwhom I Love to distraction, being pregnant, is on the point of losing\r\nher life and honour by the discovery of her fault, which is mine.\"\r\n\r\nThe matron replied that nothing could be ascertained about a person\r\nexcept from private questions; and to further impose upon the marquis,\r\nshe fetched a kind of box marked with figures and strange emblems.\r\nOpening this, and putting together certain figures which it contained,\r\nshe declared that what the marquis had told her was true, and that his\r\nsituation was a most melancholy one. She added, in order to frighten\r\nhim, that he was threatened by still more serious misfortunes than those\r\nwhich had already overtaken him, but that it was easy to anticipate and\r\nobviate these mischances by new consultations.\r\n\r\n\"Madame,\" replied the marquis, \"I fear only one thing in the world, the\r\ndishonour of the woman I love. Is there no method of remedying the usual\r\nembarrassment of a birth?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know of none,\" said the matron.\r\n\r\n\"The young lady has succeeded in concealing her condition; it would be\r\neasy for her confinement to take place privately.\"\r\n\r\n\"She has already risked her life; and I cannot consent to be mixed up in\r\nthis affair, for fear of the consequences.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could not, for instance,\" said the marquis, \"a confinement be effected\r\nwithout pain?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don’t know about that, but this I do\" know, that I shall take very\r\ngood care not to practise any method contrary to the laws of nature.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are deceiving me: you are acquainted with this method, you have\r\nalready practised it upon a certain person whom I could name to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who has dared to calumniate me thus? I operate only after the decision\r\nof the Faculty. God forbid that I should be stoned by all the\r\nphysicians, and perhaps expelled from France!\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you then let me die of despair? If I were capable of making a bad\r\nuse of your secrets, I could have done so long ago, for I know them. In\r\nHeaven’s name, do not dissimulate any longer, and tell me how it is\r\npossible to stifle the pangs of labour. Do you want more gold? Here it\r\nis.\" And he threw more Louis on the table.\r\n\r\n\"Stay,\" said the matron: \"there is perhaps a method which I think I have\r\ndiscovered, and which I have never employed, but I believe it\r\nefficacious.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if you have never employed it, it may be dangerous, and risk the\r\nlife of the lady whom I love.\"\r\n\r\n\"When I say never, I mean that I have tried it once, and most\r\nsuccessfully. Be at your ease.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" cried the marquis, \"you have earned my everlasting gratitude!\r\nBut,\" continued he, \"if we could anticipate the confinement itself, and\r\nremove from henceforth the symptoms of pregnancy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sir, that is a great crime you speak of!\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" continued the marquis, as if speaking to himself in a fit of\r\nintense grief; \"I had rather lose a dear child, the pledge of our love,\r\nthan bring into the world an unhappy creature which might possibly cause\r\nits mother’s death.\"\r\n\r\n\"I pray you, sir, let no more be said on the subject; it is a horrible\r\ncrime even to think of such a thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is to be done? Is it better to destroy two persons and perhaps\r\nkill a whole family with despair? Oh, madame, I entreat you, extricate\r\nus from this extremity!\"\r\n\r\nThe marquis buried his face in his hands, and sobbed as though he were\r\nweeping copiously.\r\n\r\n\"Your despair grievously affects me,\" said the matron; \"but consider\r\nthat for a woman of my calling it is a capital offence.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you talking about? Do not our mystery, our safety, and our\r\ncredit come in first?\r\n\r\n\"They can never get at you till after the death and dishonour of all\r\nthat is dear to me in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"I might then, perhaps. But in this case you must insure me against\r\nlegal complications, fines, and procure me a safe exit from the\r\nkingdom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! that is my affair. Take my whole fortune! Take my life!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he threw the whole purse on the table.\r\n\r\n\"In this case, and solely to extricate you from the extreme danger in\r\nwhich I see you placed, I consent to give you a decoction, and certain\r\ninstructions, which will instantly relieve the lady from her burden. She\r\nmust use the greatest precaution, and study to carry out exactly what I\r\nam about to tell you. My God! only such desperate occasions as this one\r\ncould induce me to—— Here——\"\r\n\r\nShe took a flask from the bottom of a cupboard, and continued—\r\n\r\n\"Here is a liquor which never fails.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, madame, you save my honour, which is dearer to me than life! But\r\nthis is not enough: tell me what use I am to make of this liquor, and in\r\nwhat doses I am to administer it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The patient,\" replied the midwife, \"must take one spoonful the first\r\nday; the second day two; the third——\"\r\n\r\n\"You will obey me to the minutest particular?\"\r\n\r\n\"I swear it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us start, then.\"\r\n\r\nShe asked but for time to pack a little linen, put things in order, then\r\nfastened her doors, and left the house with the marquis. A quarter of an\r\nhour later they were galloping through the night, without her knowing\r\nwhere the marquis was taking her.\r\n\r\nThe marquis reappeared three days later at the chateau, finding the\r\ncount’s family as he had left them—that is to say, intoxicated with\r\nhope, and counting the weeks, days, and hours before the accouchement of\r\nthe countess. He excused his hurried departure on the ground of the\r\nimportance of the business which had summoned him away; and speaking of\r\nhis journey at table, he related a story current in the country whence\r\nhe came, of a surprising event which he had all but witnessed. It was\r\nthe case of a lady of quality who suddenly found herself in the most\r\ndangerous pangs of labour. All the skill of the physicians who had been\r\nsummoned proved futile; the lady was at the point of death; at last, in\r\nsheer despair, they summoned a midwife of great repute among the\r\npeasantry, but whose practice did not include the gentry. From the first\r\ntreatment of this woman, who appeared modest and diffident to a degree,\r\nthe pains ceased as if by enchantment; the patient fell into an\r\nindefinable calm languor, and after some hours was delivered of a\r\nbeautiful infant; but after this was attacked by a violent fever which\r\nbrought her to death’s door. They then again had recourse to the\r\ndoctors, notwithstanding the opposition of the master of the house, who\r\nhad confidence in the matron. The doctors’ treatment only made matters\r\nworse. In this extremity they again called in the midwife, and at the\r\nend of three weeks the lady was miraculously restored to life, thus,\r\nadded the marquis, establishing the reputation of the matron, who had\r\nsprung into such vogue in the town where she lived and the neighbouring\r\ncountry that nothing else was talked about.\r\n\r\nThis story made a great impression on the company, on account of the\r\ncondition of the countess; the dowager added that it was very wrong to\r\nridicule these humble country experts, who often through observation and\r\nexperience discovered secrets which proud doctors were unable to unravel\r\nwith all their studies. Hereupon the count cried out that this midwife\r\nmust be sent for, as she was just the kind of woman they wanted. After\r\nthis other matters were talked about, the marquis changing the\r\nconversation; he had gained his point in quietly introducing the thin\r\nend of the wedge of his design.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, the company walked on the terrace. The countess dowager\r\nnot being able to walk much on account of her advanced age, the countess\r\nand Madame de Bouille took chairs beside her. The count walked up and\r\ndown with M. de Saint-Maixent. The marquis naturally asked how things\r\nhad been going on during his absence, and if Madame de Saint-Geran had\r\nsuffered any inconvenience, for her pregnancy had become the most\r\nimportant affair in the household, and hardly anything else was talked\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n\"By the way,\" said the count, \"you were speaking just now of a very\r\nskilful midwife; would it not be a good step to summon her?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" replied the marquis, \"that it would be an excellent\r\nselection, for I do not suppose there is one in this neighbourhood to\r\ncompare to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a great mind to send for her at once, and to keep her about the\r\ncountess, whose constitution she will be all the better acquainted with\r\nif she studies it beforehand. Do you know where I can send for her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Faith,\" said the marquis, \"she lives in a village, but I don’t know\r\nwhich.\"\r\n\r\n\"But at least you know her name?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can hardly remember it. Louise Boyard, I think, or Polliard, one or\r\nthe other.\"\r\n\r\n\"How! have you not even retained the name?\"\r\n\r\n\"I heard the story, that’s all. Who the deuce can keep a name in his\r\nhead which he hears in such a chance fashion?\"\r\n\r\n\"But did the condition of the countess never occur to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was so far away that I did not suppose you would send such a\r\ndistance. I thought you were already provided.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can we set about to find her?\"\r\n\r\n\"If that is all, I have a servant who knows people in that part of the\r\ncountry, and who knows how to go about things: if you like, he shall go\r\nin quest of her.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I like? This very moment.\"\r\n\r\nThe same evening the servant started on his errand with the count’s\r\ninstructions, not forgetting those of his master. He went at full speed.\r\nIt may readily be supposed that he had not far to seek the woman he was\r\nto bring back with him; but he purposely kept away for three days, and\r\nat the end of this time Louise Goillard was installed in the chateau.\r\n\r\nShe was a woman of plain and severe exterior, who at once inspired\r\nconfidence in everyone. The plots of the marquis and Madame de Bouille\r\nthus throve with most baneful success; but an accident happened which\r\nthreatened to nullify them, and, by causing a great disaster, to prevent\r\na crime.\r\n\r\nThe countess, passing into her apartments, caught her foot in a carpet,\r\nand fell heavily on the floor. At the cries of a footman all the\r\nhousehold was astir. The countess was carried to bed; the most intense\r\nalarm prevailed; but no bad consequences followed this accident, which\r\nproduced only a further succession of visits from the neighbouring\r\ngentry. This happened about the end of the seventh month.\r\n\r\nAt length the moment of accouchement came. Everything had long before\r\nbeen arranged for the delivery, and nothing remained to be done. The\r\nmarquis had employed all this time in strengthening Madame de Bouille\r\nagainst her scruples. He often saw Louise Goillard in private, and gave\r\nher his instructions; but he perceived that the corruption of Baulieu,\r\nthe house steward, was an essential factor. Baulieu was already half\r\ngained over by the interviews of the year preceding; a large sum of\r\nready money and many promises did the rest. This wretch was not ashamed\r\nto join a plot against a master to whom he owed everything. The\r\nmarchioness for her part, and always under the instigation of M. de\r\nSaint-Maixent, secured matters all round by bringing into the abominable\r\nplot the Quinet girls, her maids; so that there was nothing but treason\r\nand conspiracy against this worthy family among their upper servants,\r\nusually styled confidential. Thus, having prepared matters, the\r\nconspirators awaited the event.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of August the Countess de Saint-Geran was overtaken by the\r\npangs of labour in the chapel of the chateau, where she was hearing\r\nmass. They carried her to her room before mass was over, her women ran\r\naround her, and the countess dowager with her own hands arranged on her\r\nhead a cap of the pattern worn by ladies about to be confined—a cap\r\nwhich is not usually removed till some time later.\r\n\r\nThe pains recurred with terrible intensity. The count wept at his wife’s\r\ncries. Many persons were present. The dowager’s two daughters by her\r\nsecond marriage, one of whom, then sixteen years of age, afterwards\r\nmarried the Duke de Ventadour and was a party to the lawsuit, wished to\r\nbe present at this accouchement, which was to perpetuate by a new scion\r\nan illustrious race near extinction. There were also Dame Saligny,\r\nsister of the late Marshal Saint-Geran, the Marquis de Saint-Maixent,\r\nand the Marchioness de Bouille.\r\n\r\nEverything seemed to favour the projects of these last two persons, who\r\ntook an interest in the event of a very different character from that\r\ngenerally felt. As the pains produced no result, and the accouchement\r\nwas of the most difficult nature, while the countess was near the last\r\nextremity, expresses were sent to all the neighbouring parishes to offer\r\nprayers for the mother and the child; the Holy Sacrament was elevated in\r\nthe churches at Moulins.\r\n\r\nThe midwife attended to everything herself. She maintained that the\r\ncountess would be more comfortable if her slightest desires were\r\ninstantly complied with. The countess herself never spoke a word, only\r\ninterrupting the gloomy silence by heart-rending cries. All at once,\r\nMadame de Boulle, who affected to be bustling about, pointed out that\r\nthe presence of so many persons was what hindered the countess’s\r\naccouchement, and, assuming an air of authority justified by fictitious\r\ntenderness, said that everyone must retire, leaving the patient in the\r\nhands of the persons who were absolutely necessary to her, and that, to\r\nremove any possible objections, the countess dowager her mother must set\r\nthe example. The opportunity was made use of to remove the count from\r\nthis harrowing spectacle, and everyone followed the countess dowager.\r\nEven the countess’s own maids were not allowed to remain, being sent on\r\nerrands which kept them out of the way. This further reason was given,\r\nthat the eldest being scarcely fifteen, they were too young to be\r\npresent on such an occasion. The only persons remaining by the bedside\r\nwere the Marchioness de Bouille, the midwife, and the two Quinet girls;\r\nthe countess was thus in the hands of her most cruel enemies.\r\n\r\nIt was seven o’clock in the evening; the labours continued; the elder\r\nQuinet girl held the patient by the hand to soothe her. The count and\r\nthe dowager sent incessantly to know the news. They were told that\r\neverything was going on well, and that shortly their wishes would be\r\naccomplished; but none of the servants were allowed to enter the room.\r\n\r\nThree hours later, the midwife declared that the countess could not hold\r\nout any longer unless she got some rest. She made her swallow a liquor\r\nwhich was introduced into her mouth by spoonfuls. The countess fell into\r\nso deep a sleep that she seemed to be dead. The younger Quinet girl\r\nthought for a moment that they had killed her, and wept in a corner of\r\nthe room, till Madame de Bouille reassured her.\r\n\r\nDuring this frightful night a shadowy figure prowled in the corridors,\r\nsilently patrolled the rooms, and came now and then to the door of the\r\nbedroom, where he conferred in a low tone with the midwife and the\r\nMarchioness de Bouille. This was the Marquis de Saint-Maixent, who gave\r\nhis orders, encouraged his people, watched over every point of his plot,\r\nhimself a prey to the agonies of nervousness which accompany the\r\npreparations for a great crime.\r\n\r\nThe dowager countess, owing to her great age, had been compelled to take\r\nsome rest. The count sat up, worn out with fatigue, in a downstairs room\r\nhard by that in which they were compassing the ruin of all most dear to\r\nhim in the world.\r\n\r\nThe countess, in her profound lethargy, gave birth, without being aware\r\nof it, to a boy, who thus fell on his entry into the world into the\r\nhands of his enemies, his mother powerless to defend him by her cries\r\nand tears. The door was half opened, and a man who was waiting outside\r\nbrought in; this was the major-domo Baulieu.\r\n\r\nThe midwife, pretending to afford the first necessary cares to the\r\nchild, had taken it into a corner. Baulieu watched her movements, and\r\nspringing upon her, pinioned her arms. The wretched woman dug her nails\r\ninto the child’s head. He snatched it from her, but the poor infant for\r\nlong bore the marks of her claws.\r\n\r\nPossibly the Marchioness de Bouille could not nerve herself to the\r\ncommission of so great a crime; but it seems more probable that the\r\nsteward prevented the destruction of the child under the orders of M. de\r\nSaint-Maixent. The theory is that the marquis, mistrustful of the\r\npromise made him by Madame de Bouille to marry him after the death of\r\nher husband, desired to keep the child to oblige her to keep her word,\r\nunder threats of getting him acknowledged, if she proved faithless to\r\nhim. No other adequate reason can be conjectured to determine a man of\r\nhis character to take such great care of his victim.\r\n\r\nBaulieu swaddled the child immediately, put it in a basket, hid it under\r\nhis cloak, and went with his prey to find the marquis; they conferred\r\ntogether for some time, after which the house steward passed by a\r\npostern gate into the moat, thence to a terrace by which he reached a\r\nbridge leading into the park. This park had twelve gates, and he had the\r\nkeys of all. He mounted a blood horse which he had left waiting behind a\r\nwall, and started off at full gallop. The same day he passed through the\r\nvillage of Escherolles, a league distant from Saint-Geran, where he\r\nstopped at the house of a nurse, wife of a glove-maker named Claude.\r\nThis peasant woman gave her breast to the child; but the steward, not\r\ndaring to stay in a village so near Saint-Geran, crossed the river\r\nAllier at the port de la Chaise, and calling at the house of a man named\r\nBoucaud, the good wife suckled the child for the second time; he then\r\ncontinued his journey in the direction of Auvergne.\r\n\r\nThe heat was excessive, his horse was done up, the child seemed uneasy.\r\nA carrier’s cart passed him going to Riom; it was owned by a certain\r\nPaul Boithion of the town of Aigueperce, a common carrier on the road.\r\nBaulieu went alongside to put the child in the cart, which he entered\r\nhimself, carrying the infant on his knees. The horse followed, fastened\r\nby the bridle to the back of the cart.\r\n\r\nIn the conversation which he held with this man, Baulieu said that he\r\nshould not take so much care of the child did it not belong to the most\r\nnoble house in the Bourbonnais. They reached the village of Che at\r\nmidday. The mistress of the house where he put up, who was nursing an\r\ninfant, consented to give some of her milk to the child. The poor\r\ncreature was covered with blood; she warmed some water, stripped off its\r\nswaddling linen, washed it from head to foot, and swathed it up again\r\nmore neatly.\r\n\r\nThe carrier then took them to Riom. When they got there, Baulieu got rid\r\nof him by giving a false meeting-place for their departure; left in the\r\ndirection of the abbey of Lavoine, and reached the village of\r\nDescoutoux, in the mountains, between Lavoine and Thiers. The\r\nMarchioness de Bouille had a chateau there where she occasionally spent\r\nsome time.\r\n\r\nThe child was nursed at Descoutoux by Gabrielle Moini, who was paid a\r\nmonth in advance; but she only kept it a week or so, because they\r\nrefused to tell her the father and mother and to refer her to a place\r\nwhere she might send reports of her charge. This woman having made these\r\nreasons public, no nurse could be found to take charge of the child,\r\nwhich was removed from the village of Descoutoux. The persons who\r\nremoved it took the highroad to Burgundy, crossing a densely wooded\r\ncountry, and here they lost their way.\r\n\r\nThe above particulars were subsequently proved by the nurses, the\r\ncarrier, and others who made legal depositions. They are stated at\r\nlength here, as they proved very important in the great lawsuit. The\r\ncompilers of the case, into which we search for information, have\r\nhowever omitted to tell us how the absence of the major-domo was\r\naccounted for at the castle; probably the far-sighted marquis had got an\r\nexcuse ready.\r\n\r\nThe countess’s state of drowsiness continued till daybreak. She woke\r\nbathed in blood, completely exhausted, but yet with a sensation of\r\ncomfort which convinced her that she had been delivered from her burden.\r\nHer first words were about her child; she wished to see it, kiss it; she\r\nasked where it was. The midwife coolly told her, whilst the girls who\r\nwere by were filled with amazement at her audacity, that she had not\r\nbeen confined at all. The countess maintained the contrary, and as she\r\ngrew very excited, the midwife strove to calm her, assuring her that in\r\nany case her delivery could not be long protracted, and that, judging\r\nfrom all the indications of the night, she would give birth to a boy.\r\nThis promise comforted the count and the countess dowager, but failed to\r\nsatisfy the countess, who insisted that a child had been born.\r\n\r\nThe same day a scullery-maid met a woman going to the water’s edge in\r\nthe castle moat, with a parcel in her arms. She recognised the midwife,\r\nand asked what she was carrying and where she was going so early. The\r\nlatter replied that she was very inquisitive, and that it was nothing at\r\nall; but the girl, laughingly pretending to be angry at this answer,\r\npulled open one of the ends of the parcel before the midwife had time to\r\nstop her, and exposed to view some linen soaked in blood.\r\n\r\n\"Madame has been confined, then?\" she said to the matron.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied she briskly, \"she has not.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl was unconvinced, and said, \"How do you mean that she has not,\r\nwhen madame the marchioness, who was there, says she has?\" The matron in\r\ngreat confusion replied, \"She must have a very long tongue, if she said\r\nso.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl’s evidence was later found most important.\r\n\r\nThe countess’s uneasiness made her worse the next day. She implored with\r\nsighs and tears at least to be told what had become of her child,\r\nsteadily maintaining that she was not mistaken when she assured them\r\nthat she had given birth to one. The midwife with great effrontery told\r\nher that the new moon was unfavourable to childbirth, and that she must\r\nwait for the wane, when it would be easier as matters were already\r\nprepared.\r\n\r\nInvalids’ fancies do not obtain much credence; still, the persistence of\r\nthe countess would have convinced everyone in the long run, had not the\r\ndowager said that she remembered at the end of the ninth month of one of\r\nher own pregnancies she had all the premonitory symptoms of lying in,\r\nbut they proved false, and in fact the accouchement took place three\r\nmonths later.\r\n\r\nThis piece of news inspired great confidence. The marquis and Madame de\r\nBouille did all in their power to confirm it, but the countess\r\nobstinately refused to listen to it, and her passionate transports of\r\ngrief gave rise to the greatest anxiety. The midwife, who knew not how\r\nto gain time, and was losing all hope in face of the countess’s\r\npersistence, was almost frightened out of her wits; she entered into\r\nmedical details, and finally said that some violent exercise must be\r\ntaken to induce labour. The countess, still unconvinced, refused to obey\r\nthis order; but the count, the dowager, and all the family entreated her\r\nso earnestly that she gave way.\r\n\r\nThey put her in a close carriage, and drove her a whole day over\r\nploughed fields, by the roughest and hardest roads. She was so shaken\r\nthat she lost the power of breathing; it required all the strength of\r\nher constitution to support this barbarous treatment in the delicate\r\ncondition of a lady so recently confined. They put her to bed again\r\nafter this cruel drive, and seeing that nobody took her view, she threw\r\nherself into the arms of Providence, and consoled herself by religion;\r\nthe midwife administered violent remedies to deprive her of milk; she\r\ngot over all these attempts to murder her, and slowly got better.\r\n\r\nTime, which heals the deepest affliction, gradually soothed that of the\r\ncountess; her grief nevertheless burst out periodically on the slightest\r\ncause; but eventually it died out, till the following events rekindled\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThere had been in Paris a fencing-master who used to boast that he had a\r\nbrother in the service of a great house. This fencing-master had married\r\na certain Marie Pigoreau, daughter of an actor. He had recently died in\r\npoor circumstances, leaving her a widow with two children. This woman\r\nPigoreau did not enjoy the best of characters, and no one knew how she\r\nmade a living, when all at once, after some short absences from home and\r\nvisit from a man who came in the evening, his face muffled in his cloak,\r\nshe launched out into a more expensive style of living; the neighbours\r\nsaw in her house costly clothes, fine swaddling-clothes, and at last it\r\nbecame known that she was nursing a strange child.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time it also transpired that she had a deposit of two\r\nthousand livres in the hands of a grocer in the quarter, named Raguenet;\r\nsome days later, as the child’s baptism had doubtless been put off for\r\nfear of betraying his origin, Pigoreau had him christened at St. Jean en\r\nGreve. She did not invite any of the neighbours to the function, and\r\ngave parents’ names of her own choosing at the church. For godfather she\r\nselected the parish sexton, named Paul Marmiou, who gave the child the\r\nname of Bernard. La Pigoreau remained in a confessional during the\r\nceremony, and gave the man ten sou. The godmother was Jeanne Chevalier,\r\na poor woman of the parish.\r\n\r\nThe entry in the register was as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"On the seventh day of March one thousand six hundred and\r\n     forty−two was baptized Bernard, son of .  .  .  and .  .  .  his\r\n     godfather being Paul Marmiou, day labourer and servant of this\r\n     parish, and his godmother Jeanne Chevalier, widow of Pierre\r\n     Thibou.\"\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards la Pigoreau put out the child to nurse in the\r\nvillage of Torcy en Brie, with a woman who had been her godmother, whose\r\nhusband was called Paillard. She gave out that it was a child of quality\r\nwhich had been entrusted to her, and that she should not hesitate, if\r\nsuch a thing were necessary, to save its life by the loss of one of her\r\nown children. The nurse did not keep it long, because she fell ill; la\r\nPigoreau went to fetch the child away, lamenting this accident, and\r\nfurther saying that she regretted it all the more, as the nurse would\r\nhave earned enough to make her comfortable for the rest of her life. She\r\nput the infant out again in the same village, with the widow of a\r\npeasant named Marc Peguin. The monthly wage was regularly paid, and the\r\nchild brought up as one of rank. La Pigoreau further told the woman that\r\nit was the son of a great nobleman, and would later make the fortunes of\r\nthose who served him. An elderly man, whom the people supposed to be the\r\nchild’s father, but who Pigoreau assured them was her brother-in-law,\r\noften came to see him.\r\n\r\nWhen the child was eighteen months old, la Pigoreau took him away and\r\nweaned him. Of the two by her husband the elder was called Antoine, the\r\nsecond would have been called Henri if he had lived; but he was born on\r\nthe 9th of August 1639, after the death of his father, who was killed in\r\nJune of the same year, and died shortly after his birth. La Pigoreau\r\nthought fit to give the name and condition of this second son to the\r\nstranger, and thus bury for ever the secret of his birth. With this end\r\nin view, she left the quarter where she lived, and removed to conceal\r\nherself in another parish where she was not known. The child was brought\r\nup under the name and style of Henri, second son of la Pigoreau, till he\r\nwas two and a half years of age; but at this time, whether she was not\r\nengaged to keep it any longer, or whether she had spent the two thousand\r\nlivres deposited with the grocer Raguenet, and could get no more from\r\nthe principals, she determined to get rid of it.\r\n\r\nHer gossips used to tell this woman that she cared but little for her\r\neldest son, because she was very confident of the second one making his\r\nfortune, and that if she were obliged to give up one of them, she had\r\nbetter keep the younger, who was a beautiful boy. To this she would\r\nreply that the matter did not depend upon her; that the boy’s godfather\r\nwas an uncle in good circumstances, who would not charge himself with\r\nany other child. She often mentioned this uncle, her brother-in-law, she\r\nsaid, who was major-domo in a great house.\r\n\r\nOne morning, the hall porter at the hotel de Saint-Geran came to Baulieu\r\nand told him that a woman carrying a child was asking for him at the\r\nwicket gate; this Baulieu was, in fact, the brother of the fencing\r\nmaster, and godfather to Pigoreau’s second son. It is now supposed that\r\nhe was the unknown person who had placed the child of quality with her,\r\nand who used to go and see him at his nurse’s. La Pigoreau gave him a\r\nlong account of her situation. The major-domo took the child with some\r\nemotion, and told la Pigoreau to wait his answer a short distance off,\r\nin a place which he pointed out.\r\n\r\nBaulieu’s wife made a great outcry at the first proposal of an increase\r\nof family; but he succeeded in pacifying her by pointing out the\r\nnecessities of his sister-in-law, and how easy and inexpensive it was to\r\ndo this good work in such a house as the count’s. He went to his master\r\nand mistress to ask permission to bring up this child in their hotel; a\r\nkind of feeling entered into the charge he was undertaking which in some\r\nmeasure lessened the weight on his conscience.\r\n\r\nThe count and countess at first opposed this project; telling him that\r\nhaving already five children he ought not to burden himself with any\r\nmore, but he petitioned so earnestly that he obtained what he wanted.\r\nThe countess wished to see it, and as she was about to start for Moulins\r\nshe ordered it to be put in her women’s coach; when it was shown her,\r\nshe cried out, \"What a lovely child!\" The boy was fair, with large blue\r\neyes and very regular features, She gave him a hundred caresses, which\r\nthe child returned very prettily. She at once took a great fancy to him,\r\nand said to Baulieu, \"I shall not put him in my women’s coach; I shall\r\nput him in my own.\"\r\n\r\nAfter they arrived at the chateau of Saint-Geran, her affection for\r\nHenri, the name retained by the child, increased day by day. She often\r\ncontemplated him with sadness, then embraced him with tenderness, and\r\nkept him long on her bosom. The count shared this affection for the\r\nsupposed nephew of Baulieu, who was adopted, so to speak, and brought up\r\nlike a child of quality.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis de Saint-Maixent and Madame de Bouille had not married,\r\nalthough the old Marquis de Bouille had long been dead. It appeared that\r\nthey had given up this scheme. The marchioness no doubt felt scruples\r\nabout it, and the marquis was deterred from marriage by his profligate\r\nhabits. It is moreover supposed that other engagements and heavy bribes\r\ncompensated the loss he derived from the marchioness’s breach of faith.\r\n\r\nHe was a man about town at that period, and was making love to the\r\ndemoiselle Jacqueline de la Garde; he had succeeded in gaining her\r\naffections, and brought matters to such a point that she no longer\r\nrefused her favours except on the grounds of her pregnancy and the\r\ndanger of an indiscretion. The marquis then offered to introduce to her\r\na matron who could deliver women without the pangs of labour, and who\r\nhad a very successful practice. The same Jacqueline de la Garde further\r\ngave evidence at the trial that M. de Saint-Maixent had often boasted,\r\nas of a scientific intrigue, of having spirited away the son of a\r\ngovernor of a province and grandson of a marshal of France; that he\r\nspoke of the Marchioness de Bouille, said that he had made her rich, and\r\nthat it was to him she owed her great wealth; and further, that one day\r\nhaving taken her to a pretty country seat which belonged to him, she\r\npraised its beauty, saying \"c’etait un beau lieu\"; he replied by a pun\r\non a man’s name, saying that he knew another Baulieu who had enabled him\r\nto make a fortune of five hundred thousand crowns. He also said to\r\nJadelon, sieur de la Barbesange, when posting with him from Paris, that\r\nthe Countess de Saint-Geran had been delivered of a son who was in his\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThe marquis had not seen Madame de Bouille for a long time; a common\r\ndanger reunited them. They had both learned with terror the presence of\r\nHenri at the hotel de Saint-Geran. They consulted about this; the\r\nmarquis undertook to cut the danger short. However, he dared put in\r\npractice nothing overtly against the child, a matter still more\r\ndifficult just then, inasmuch as some particulars of his discreditable\r\nadventures had leaked out, and the Saint-Geran family received him more\r\nthan coldly.\r\n\r\nBaulieu, who witnessed every day the tenderness of the count and\r\ncountess for the boy Henri, had been a hundred times on the point of\r\ngiving himself up and confessing everything. He was torn to pieces with\r\nremorse. Remarks escaped him which he thought he might make without\r\nulterior consequences; seeing the lapse of time, but they were noted and\r\ncommented on. Sometimes he would say that he held in his hand the life\r\nand honour of Madame the Marchioness de Bouille; sometimes that the\r\ncount and countess had more reasons than they knew of for loving Henri.\r\nOne day he put a case of conscience to a confessor, thus: \"Whether a man\r\nwho had been concerned in the abduction of a child could not satisfy his\r\nconscience by restoring him to his father and mother without telling\r\nthem who he was?\" What answer the confessor made is not known, but\r\napparently it was not what the major-domo wanted. He replied to a\r\nmagistrate of Moulins, who congratulated him on having a nephew whom his\r\nmasters overburdened with kind treatment, that they ought to love him,\r\nsince he was nearly related to them.\r\n\r\nThese remarks were noticed by others than those principally concerned.\r\nOne day a wine merchant came to propose to Baulieu the purchase of a\r\npipe of Spanish wine, of which he gave him a sample bottle; in the\r\nevening he was taken violently ill. They carried him to bed, where he\r\nwrithed, uttering horrible cries. One sole thought possessed him when\r\nhis sufferings left him a lucid interval, and in his agony he repeated\r\nover and over again that he wished to implore pardon from the count and\r\ncountess for a great injury which he had done them. The people round\r\nabout him told him that was a trifle, and that he ought not to let it\r\nembitter his last moments, but he begged so piteously that he got them\r\nto promise that they should be sent for.\r\n\r\nThe count thought it was some trifling irregularity, some\r\nmisappropriation in the house accounts; and fearing to hasten the death\r\nof the sufferer by the shame of the confession of a fault, he sent word\r\nthat he heartily forgave him, that he might die tranquil, and refused to\r\nsee him. Baulieu expired, taking his secret with him. This happened in\r\n1648.\r\n\r\nThe child was then seven years old. His charming manners grew with his\r\nage, and the count and countess felt their love for him increase. They\r\ncaused him to be taught dancing and fencing, put him into breeches and\r\nhose, and a page’s suit of their livery, in which capacity he served\r\nthem. The marquis turned his attack to this quarter. He was doubtless\r\npreparing some plot as criminal as the preceding, when justice overtook\r\nhim for some other great crimes of which he had been guilty. He was\r\narrested one day in the street when conversing with one of the\r\nSaint-Geran footmen, and taken to the Conciergerie of the Palace of\r\nJustice.\r\n\r\nWhether owing to these occurrences, or to grounds for suspicion before\r\nmentioned, certain reports spread in the Bourbonnais embodying some of\r\nthe real facts; portions of them reached the ears of the count and\r\ncountess, but they had only the effect of renewing their grief without\r\nfurnishing a clue to the truth.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the count went to take the waters at Vichy. The countess and\r\nMadame de Bouille followed him, and there they chanced to encounter\r\nLouise Goillard, the midwife. This woman renewed her acquaintance with\r\nthe house, and in particular often visited the Marchioness de Bouille.\r\nOne day the countess, unexpectedly entering the marchioness’s room,\r\nfound them both conversing in an undertone. They stopped talking\r\nimmediately, and appeared disconcerted.\r\n\r\nThe countess noticed this without attaching any importance to it, and\r\nasked the subject of their conversation.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nothing,\" said the marchioness.\r\n\r\n\"But what is it?\" insisted the countess, seeing that she blushed.\r\n\r\nThe marchioness, no longer able to evade the question, and feeling her\r\ndifficulties increase, replied—\r\n\r\n\"Dame Louise is praising my brother for bearing no ill-will to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" said the countess, turning to the midwife,—\"why should you fear\r\nany ill-will on the part of my husband?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was afraid,\" said Louise Goillard awkwardly, \"that he might have\r\ntaken a dislike to me on account of all that happened when you expected\r\nto be confined.\"\r\n\r\nThe obscurity of these words and embarrassment of the two women produced\r\na lively effect upon the countess; but she controlled herself and let\r\nthe subject drop. Her agitation, however, did not escape the notice of\r\nthe marchioness, who the next day had horses put to her coach and\r\nretired to her estate of Lavoine. This clumsy proceeding strengthened\r\nsuspicion.\r\n\r\nThe first determination of the countess was to arrest Louise Goillard;\r\nbut she saw that in so serious a matter every step must be taken with\r\nprecaution. She consulted the count and the countess dowager. They\r\nquietly summoned the midwife, to question her without any preliminaries.\r\nShe prevaricated and contradicted herself over and over again; moreover,\r\nher state of terror alone sufficed to convict her of a crime. They\r\nhanded her over to the law, and the Count de Saint-Geran filed an\r\ninformation before the vice-seneschal of Moulins.\r\n\r\nThe midwife underwent a first interrogatory. She confessed the truth of\r\nthe accouchement, but she added that the countess had given birth to a\r\nstill-born daughter, which she had buried under a stone near the step of\r\nthe barn in the back yard. The judge, accompanied by a physician and a\r\nsurgeon, repaired to the place, where he found neither stone, nor\r\nfoetus, nor any indications of an interment. They searched\r\nunsuccessfully in other places.\r\n\r\nWhen the dowager countess heard this statement, she demanded that this\r\nhorrible woman should be put on her trial. The civil lieutenant, in the\r\nabsence of the criminal lieutenant, commenced the proceedings.\r\n\r\nIn a second interrogation, Louise Goillard positively declared that the\r\ncountess had never been confined;\r\n\r\nIn a third, that she had been delivered of a mole;\r\n\r\nIn a fourth, that she had been confined of a male infant, which Baulieu\r\nhad carried away in a basket;\r\n\r\nAnd in a fifth, in which she answered from the dock, she maintained that\r\nher evidence of the countess’s accouchement had been extorted from her\r\nby violence. She made no charges against either Madame de Bouille or the\r\nMarquis de Saint Maixent. On the other hand, no sooner was she under\r\nlock and key than she despatched her son Guillemin to the marchioness to\r\ninform her that she was arrested. The marchioness recognised how\r\nthreatening things were, and was in a state of consternation; she\r\nimmediately sent the sieur de la Foresterie, her steward, to the\r\nlieutenant-general, her counsel, a mortal enemy of the count, that he\r\nmight advise her in this conjuncture, and suggest a means for helping\r\nthe matron without appearing openly in the matter. The lieutenant’s\r\nadvice was to quash the proceedings and obtain an injunction against the\r\ncontinuance of the preliminaries to the action. The marchioness spent a\r\nlarge sum of money, and obtained this injunction; but it was immediately\r\nreversed, and the bar to the suit removed.\r\n\r\nLa Foresterie was then ordered to pass to Riom, where the sisters Quinet\r\nlived, and to bribe them heavily to secrecy. The elder one, on leaving\r\nthe marchioness’s service, had shaken her fist in her face, feeling\r\nsecure with the secrets in her knowledge, and told her that she would\r\nrepent having dismissed her and her sister, and that she would make a\r\nclean breast of the whole affair, even were she to be hung first. These\r\ngirls then sent word that they wished to enter her service again; that\r\nthe countess had promised them handsome terms if they would speak; and\r\nthat they had even been questioned in her name by a Capuchin superior,\r\nbut that they said nothing, in order to give time to prepare an answer\r\nfor them. The marchioness found herself obliged to take back the girls;\r\nshe kept the younger, and married the elder to Delisle, her house\r\nsteward. But la Foresterie, finding himself in this network of intrigue,\r\ngrew disgusted at serving such a mistress, and left her house. The\r\nmarchioness told him on his departure that if he were so indiscreet as\r\nto repeat a word of what he had learned from the Quinet girls, she would\r\npunish him with a hundred poniard stabs from her major-domo Delisle.\r\nHaving thus fortified her position, she thought herself secure against\r\nany hostile steps; but it happened that a certain prudent Berger,\r\ngentleman and page to the Marquis de Saint-Maixent, who enjoyed his\r\nmaster’s confidence and went to see him in the Conciergerie, where he\r\nwas imprisoned, threw some strange light on this affair. His master had\r\nnarrated to him all the particulars of the accouchement of the countess\r\nand of the abduction of the child.\r\n\r\n\"I am astonished, my lord,\" replied the page, \"that having so many\r\ndangerous affairs on hand; you did not relieve your conscience of this\r\none.\"\r\n\r\n\"I intend,\" replied the marquis, \"to restore this child to his father: I\r\nhave been ordered to do so by a Capuchin to whom I confessed having\r\ncarried off from the midst of the family, without their knowing it, a\r\ngrandson of a marshal of France and son of a governor of a province.\"\r\n\r\nThe marquis had at that time permission to go out from prison\r\noccasionally on his parole. This will not surprise anyone acquainted\r\nwith the ideas which prevailed at that period on the honour of a\r\nnobleman, even the greatest criminal. The marquis, profiting by this\r\nfacility, took the page to see a child of about seven years of age, fair\r\nand with a beautiful countenance.\r\n\r\n\"Page,\" said he, \"look well at this child, so that you may know him\r\nagain when I shall send you to inquire about him.\"\r\n\r\nHe then informed him that this was the Count de Saint-Geran’s son whom\r\nhe had carried away.\r\n\r\nInformation of these matters coming to the ears of justice, decisive\r\nproofs were hoped for; but this happened just when other criminal\r\ninformations were lodged against the marquis, which left him helpless to\r\nprevent the exposure of his crimes. Police officers were despatched in\r\nall haste to the Conciergerie; they were stopped by the gaolers, who\r\ntold them that the marquis, feeling ill, was engaged with a priest who\r\nwas administering the sacraments, to him. As they insisted on seeing\r\nhim; the warders approached the cell: the priest came out, crying that\r\npersons must be sought to whom the sick man had a secret to reveal; that\r\nhe was in a desperate state, and said he had just poisoned himself; all\r\nentered the cell.\r\n\r\n  M. de Saint-Maixent was writhing on a pallet, in a pitiable condition,\r\n     sometimes shrieking like a wild beast, sometimes stammering\r\n     disconnected words. All that the officers could hear was—\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur le Comte . . . call . . . the Countess . . . de Saint-Geran .\r\n. . let them come. . . .\" The officers earnestly begged him to try to be\r\nmore explicit.\r\n\r\nThe marquis had another fit; when he opened his eyes, he said—\r\n\r\n\"Send for the countess . . . let them forgive me . . . I wish to tell\r\nthem everything.\" The police officers asked him to speak; one even told\r\nhim that the count was there. The marquis feebly murmured—\r\n\r\n\"I am going to tell you——\" Then he gave a loud cry and fell back dead.\r\n\r\nIt thus seemed as if fate took pains to close every mouth from which the\r\ntruth might escape. Still, this avowal of a deathbed revelation to be\r\nmade to the Count de Saint-Geran and the deposition of the priest who\r\nhad administered the last sacraments formed a strong link in the chain\r\nof evidence.\r\n\r\nThe judge of first instruction, collecting all the information he had\r\ngot, made a report the weight of which was overwhelming. The carters,\r\nthe nurse, the domestic servants, all gave accounts consistent with each\r\nother; the route and the various adventures of the child were plainly\r\ndetailed, from its birth till its arrival at the village of Descoutoux.\r\n\r\nJustice, thus tracing crime to its sources, had no option but to issue a\r\nwarrant for the arrest of the Marchioness de Bouilie; but it seems\r\nprobable that it was not served owing to the strenuous efforts of the\r\nCount de Saint-Geran, who could not bring himself to ruin his sister,\r\nseeing that her dishonour would have been reflected on him. The\r\nmarchioness hid her remorse in solitude, and appeared again no more. She\r\ndied shortly after, carrying the weight of her secret till she drew her\r\nlast breath.\r\n\r\nThe judge of Moulins at length pronounced sentence on the midwife, whom\r\nhe declared arraigned and convicted of having suppressed the child born\r\nto the countess; for which he condemned her to be tortured and then\r\nhanged. The matron lodged an appeal against this sentence, and the case\r\nwas referred to the Conciergerie.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the count and countess seen the successive proofs of the\r\nprocedure, than tenderness and natural feelings accomplished the rest.\r\nThey no longer doubted that their page was their son; they stripped him\r\nat once of his livery and gave him his rank and prerogatives, under the\r\ntitle of the Count de la Palice.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a private person named Sequeville informed the countess that\r\nhe had made a very important discovery; that a child had been baptized\r\nin 1642 at St. Jean-en-Greve, and that a woman named Marie Pigoreau had\r\ntaken a leading part in the affair. Thereupon inquiries were made, and\r\nit was discovered that this child had been nursed in the village of\r\nTorcy. The count obtained a warrant which enabled him to get evidence\r\nbefore the judge of Torcy; nothing was left undone to elicit the whole\r\ntruth; he also obtained a warrant through which he obtained more\r\ninformation, and published a monitory. The elder of the Quinet girls on\r\nthis told the Marquis de Canillac that the count was searching at a\r\ndistance for things very near him. The truth shone out with great lustre\r\nthrough these new facts which gushed from all this fresh information.\r\nThe child, exhibited in the presence of a legal commissary to the nurses\r\nand witnesses of Torcy, was identified, as much by the scars left by the\r\nmidwife’s nails on his head, as by his fair hair and blue eyes. This\r\nineffaceable vestige of the woman’s cruelty was the principal proof; the\r\nwitnesses testified that la Pigoreau, when she visited this child with a\r\nman who appeared to be of condition, always asserted that he was the son\r\nof a great nobleman who had been entrusted to her care, and that she\r\nhoped he would make her fortune and that of those who had reared him.\r\n\r\nThe child’s godfather, Paul Marmiou, a common labourer; the grocer\r\nRaguenet, who had charge of the two thousand livres; the servant of la\r\nPigoreau, who had heard her say that the count was obliged to take this\r\nchild; the witnesses who proved that la Pigoreau had told them that the\r\nchild was too well born to wear a page’s livery, all furnished\r\nconvincing proofs; but others were forthcoming.\r\n\r\nIt was at la Pigoreau’s that the Marquis de Saint-Maixent, living then\r\nat the hotel de Saint-Geran, went to see the child, kept in her house as\r\nif it were hers; Prudent Berger, the marquis’s page, perfectly well\r\nremembered la Pigoreau, and also the child, whom he had seen at her\r\nhouse and whose history the marquis had related to him. Finally, many\r\nother witnesses heard in the course of the case, both before the three\r\nchambers of nobles, clergy, and the tiers etat, and before the judges of\r\nTorcy, Cusset, and other local magistrates, made the facts so clear and\r\nconclusive in favour of the legitimacy of the young count, that it was\r\nimpossible to avoid impeaching the guilty parties. The count ordered the\r\nsummons in person of la Pigoreau, who had not been compromised in the\r\noriginal preliminary proceedings. This drastic measure threw the\r\nintriguing woman on her beam ends, but she strove hard to right herself.\r\n\r\nThe widowed Duchess de Ventadour, daughter by her mother’s second\r\nmarriage of the Countess dowager of Saint-Geran, and half-sister of the\r\ncount, and the Countess de Lude, daughter of the Marchioness de Bouille,\r\nfrom whom the young count carried away the Saint-Geran inheritance, were\r\nvery warm in the matter, and spoke of disputing the judgment. La\r\nPigoreau went to see them, and joined in concert with them.\r\n\r\nThen commenced this famous lawsuit, which long occupied all France, and\r\nis parallel in some respects, but not in the time occupied in the\r\nhearing, to the case heard by Solomon, in which one child was claimed by\r\ntwo mothers.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis de Saint-Maixent and Madame de Bouille being dead, were\r\nnaturally no parties to the suit, which was fought against the\r\nSaint-Geran family by la Pigoreau and Mesdames du Lude and de Ventadour.\r\nThese ladies no doubt acted in good faith, at first at any rate, in\r\nrefusing to believe the crime; for if they had originally known the\r\ntruth it is incredible that they could have fought the case so long and\r\nso obstinately.\r\n\r\nThey first of all went to the aid of the midwife, who had fallen sick in\r\nprison; they then consulted together, and resolved as follows:\r\n\r\nThat the accused should appeal against criminal proceedings;\r\n\r\nThat la Pigoreau should lodge a civil petition against the judgments\r\nwhich ordered her arrest and the confronting of witnesses;\r\n\r\nThat they should appeal against the abuse of obtaining and publishing\r\nmonitories, and lodge an interpleader against the sentence of the judge\r\nof first instruction, who had condemned the matron to capital\r\npunishment;\r\n\r\nAnd that finally, to carry the war into the enemy’s camp, la Pigoreau\r\nshould impugn the maternity of the countess, claiming the child as her\r\nown; and that the ladies should depose that the countess’s accouchement\r\nwas an imposture invented to cause it to be supposed that she had given\r\nbirth to a child.\r\n\r\nFor more safety and apparent absence of collusion Mesdames du Lude and\r\nde Ventadour pretended to have no communication with la Pigoreau.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the midwife died in prison, from an illness which\r\nvexation and remorse had aggravated. After her death, her son Guillemin\r\nconfessed that she had often told him that the countess had given birth\r\nto a son whom Baulieu had carried off, and that the child entrusted to\r\nBaulieu at the chateau Saint-Geran was the same as the one recovered;\r\nthe youth added that he had concealed this fact so long as it might\r\ninjure his mother, and he further stated that the ladies de Ventadour\r\nand du Lude had helped her in prison with money and advice—another\r\nstrong piece of presumptive evidence.\r\n\r\nThe petitions of the accused and the interpleadings of Mesdames du Lude\r\nand de Ventadour were discussed in seven hearings, before three courts\r\nconvened. The suit proceeded with all the languor and chicanery of the\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nAfter long and specious arguments, the attorney general Bijnon gave his\r\ndecision in favour of the Count and Countess of Saint-Geran, concluding\r\nthus:—\r\n\r\n\"The court rejects the civil appeal of la Pigoreau; and all the\r\nopposition and appeals of the appellants and the defendants; condemns\r\nthem to fine and in costs; and seeing that the charges against la\r\nPigoreau were of a serious nature, and that a personal summons had been\r\ndecreed against her, orders her committal, recommending her to the\r\nindulgence of the court.\"\r\n\r\nBy a judgment given in a sitting at the Tournelle by M. de Mesmes, on\r\nthe 18th of August 1657, the appellant ladies’ and the defendants’\r\nopposition was rejected with fine and costs. La Pigoreau was forbidden\r\nto leave the city and suburbs of Paris under penalty of summary\r\nconviction. The judgment in the case followed the rejection of the\r\nappeal.\r\n\r\nThis reverse at first extinguished the litigation of Mesdames du Lude\r\nand de Ventadour, but it soon revived more briskly than ever. These\r\nladies, who had taken la Pigoreau in their coach to all the hearings,\r\nprompted her, in order to procrastinate, to file a fresh petition, in\r\nwhich she demanded the confrontment of all the witnesses to the\r\npregnancy, and the confinement. On hearing this petition, the court gave\r\non the 28th of August 1658 a decree ordering the confrontment, but on\r\ncondition that for three days previously la Pigoreau should deliver\r\nherself a prisoner in the Conciergerie.\r\n\r\nThis judgment, the consequences of which greatly alarmed la Pigoreau,\r\nproduced such an effect upon her that, after having weighed the interest\r\nshe had in the suit, which she would lose by flight, against the danger\r\nto her life if she ventured her person into the hands of justice, she\r\nabandoned her false plea of maternity, and took refuge abroad. This last\r\ncircumstance was a heavy blow to Mesdames du Lude and de Ventadour; but\r\nthey were not at the end of their resources and their obstinacy.\r\n\r\nContempt of court being decreed against la Pigoreau, and the case being\r\ngot up against the other defendants, the Count de Saint-Geran left for\r\nthe Bourbonnais, to put in execution the order to confront the\r\nwitnesses. Scarcely had he arrived in the province when he was obliged\r\nto interrupt his work to receive the king and the queen mother, who were\r\nreturning from Lyons and passing through Moulins. He presented the Count\r\nde la Palice to their Majesties as his son; they received him as such.\r\nBut during the visit of the king and queen the Count de Saint-Geran fell\r\nill, over fatigued, no doubt, by the trouble he had taken to give them a\r\nsuitable reception, over and above the worry of his own affairs.\r\n\r\nDuring his illness, which only lasted a week, he made in his will a new\r\nacknowledgment of his son, naming his executors M. de Barriere,\r\nintendant of the province, and the sieur Vialet, treasurer of France,\r\ndesiring them to bring the lawsuit to an end. His last words were for\r\nhis wife and child; his only regret that he had not been able to\r\nterminate this affair. He died on the 31st of January 1659.\r\n\r\nThe maternal tenderness of the countess did not need stimulating by the\r\ninjunctions of her husband, and she took up the suit with energy. The\r\nladies de Ventadour and du Lude obtained by default letters of\r\nadministration as heiresses without liability, which were granted out of\r\nthe Chatelet. At the same time they appealed against the judgment of the\r\nlieutenant-general of the Bourbonnais, giving the tutelage of the young\r\ncount to the countess his mother, and his guardianship to sieur de\r\nBompre. The countess, on her side, interpleaded an appeal against the\r\ngranting of letters of administration without liability, and did all in\r\nher power to bring back the case to the Tournelle. The other ladies\r\ncarried their appeal to the high court, pleading that they were not\r\nparties to the lawsuit in the Tournelle.\r\n\r\nIt would serve no purpose to follow the obscure labyrinth of legal\r\nprocedure of that period, and to recite all the marches and\r\ncountermarches which legal subtlety suggested to the litigants. At the\r\nend of three years, on the 9th of April 1661, the countess obtained a\r\njudgment by which the king in person:\r\n\r\n    \"Assuming to his own decision the civil suit pending at the\r\n     Tournelle, as well as the appeals pled by both parties, and the\r\n     last petition of Mesdames du Lude and de Ventadour, sends back\r\n     the whole case to the three assembled chambers of the States\r\n     General, to be by them decided on its merits either jointly or\r\n     separately, as they may deem fit.\"\r\n\r\nThe countess thus returned to her first battlefield. Legal science\r\nproduced an immense quantity of manuscript, barristers and attorneys\r\ngreatly distinguishing themselves in their calling. After an\r\ninterminable hearing, and pleadings longer and more complicated than\r\never, which however did not bamboozle the court, judgment was pronounced\r\nin Conformity with the summing up of the attorney-general, thus—\r\n\r\n\"That passing over the petition of Mesdames Marie de la Guiche and\r\nEleonore de Bouille, on the grounds,\" etc. etc.;\r\n\r\n\"Evidence taken,\" etc.;\r\n\r\n\"Appeals, judgments annulled,\" etc.;\r\n\r\n\"With regard to the petition of the late Claude de la Guiche and Suzanne\r\nde Longaunay, dated 12th August 1658,\"\r\n\r\n\"Ordered,\r\n\r\n\"That the rule be made absolute;\r\n\r\n\"Which being done, Bernard de la Guiche is pronounced, maintained, and\r\ndeclared the lawfully born and legitimate son of Claude de la Guiche and\r\nSuzanne de Longaunay; in possession and enjoyment of the name and arms\r\nof the house of Guiche, and of all the goods left by Claude de la\r\nGuiche, his father; and Marie de la Guiche and Eleonore de Bouille are\r\ninterdicted from interfering with him;\r\n\r\n\"The petitions of Eleonore de Bouille and Marie de la Guiche, dated 4th\r\nJune 1664, 4th August 1665, 6th January, 10th February, 12th March, 15th\r\nApril, and 2nd June, 1666, are dismissed with costs;\r\n\r\n\"Declared,\r\n\r\n\"That the defaults against la Pigoreau are confirmed; and that she,\r\narraigned and convicted of the offences imputed to her, is condemned to\r\nbe hung and strangled at a gallows erected in the Place de Greve in this\r\ncity, if taken and apprehended; otherwise, in effigy at a gallows\r\nerected in the Place de Greve aforesaid; that all her property subject\r\nto confiscation is seized and confiscated from whomsoever may be in\r\npossession of it; on which property and other not subject to\r\nconfiscation, is levied a fine of eight hundred Paris livres, to be paid\r\nto the King, and applied to the maintenance of prisoners in the\r\nConciergerie of the Palace of justice, and to the costs.\"\r\n\r\nPossibly a more obstinate legal contest was never waged, on both sides,\r\nbut especially by those who lost it. The countess, who played the part\r\nof the true mother in the Bible, had the case so much to heart that she\r\noften told the judges, when pleading her cause, that if her son were not\r\nrecognised as such, she would marry him, and convey all her property to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe young Count de la Palice became Count de Saint-Geran through the\r\ndeath of his father, married, in 1667, Claude Francoise Madeleine de\r\nFarignies, only daughter of Francois de Monfreville and of Marguerite\r\nJourdain de Carbone de Canisi. He had only one daughter, born in 1688,\r\nwho became a nun. He died at the age of fifty-five years, and thus this\r\nillustrious family became extinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*MURAT—1815*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI—TOULON\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 18th June, 1815, at the very moment when the destiny of Europe\r\nwas being decided at Waterloo, a man dressed like a beggar was silently\r\nfollowing the road from Toulon to Marseilles.\r\n\r\nArrived at the entrance of the Gorge of Ollioulles, he halted on a\r\nlittle eminence from which he could see all the surrounding country;\r\nthen either because he had reached the end of his journey, or because,\r\nbefore attempting that forbidding, sombre pass which is called the\r\nThermopylae of Provence, he wished to enjoy the magnificent view which\r\nspread to the southern horizon a little longer, he went and sat down on\r\nthe edge of the ditch which bordered the road, turning his back on the\r\nmountains which rise like an amphitheatre to the north of the town, and\r\nhaving at his feet a rich plain covered with tropical vegetation,\r\nexotics of a conservatory, trees and flowers quite unknown in any other\r\npart of France.\r\n\r\nBeyond this plain, glittering in the last rays of the sun, pale and\r\nmotionless as a mirror lay the sea, and on the surface of the water\r\nglided one brig-of-war, which, taking advantage of a fresh land breeze,\r\nhad all sails spread, and was bowling along rapidly, making for Italian\r\nseas. The beggar followed it eagerly with his eyes until it disappeared\r\nbetween the Cape of Gien and the first of the islands of Hyeres, then as\r\nthe white apparition vanished he sighed deeply, let his head fall into\r\nhis hands, and remained motionless and absorbed in his reflections until\r\nthe tramplings of a cavalcade made him start; he looked up, shook back\r\nhis long black hair, as if he wished to get rid of the gloomy thoughts\r\nwhich were overwhelming him, and, looking at the entrance to the gorge\r\nfrom whence the noise came, he soon saw two riders appear, who were no\r\ndoubt well known to him, for, drawing himself up to his full height, he\r\nlet fall the stick he was carrying, and folding his arms he turned\r\ntowards them. On their side the new-comers had hardly seen him before\r\nthey halted, and the foremost dismounted, threw his bridle to his\r\ncompanion, and uncovering, though fifty paces from the man in rags,\r\nadvanced respectfully towards him. The beggar allowed him to approach\r\nwith an air of sombre dignity and without a single movement; then, when\r\nhe was quite near—\r\n\r\n\"Well, marshal, have, you news for me?\" said the beggar.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire,\" said the other sadly.\r\n\r\n\"And what are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Such that I could wish it were anyone but myself to announce them to\r\nyour Majesty——\"\r\n\r\n\"So the Emperor refuses my services! He forgets the victories of\r\nAboukir, Eylau, and Moscow?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sire; but he remembers the treaty of Naples, the taking of Reggio,\r\nand the declaration of war of the viceroy of Italy.\"\r\n\r\nThe beggar struck his forehead.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes! I daresay he thinks I deserve his reproaches, and yet it\r\nseems to me that he ought to remember that there are two men in me—the\r\nsoldier whom he made his brother, and the brother whom he made a\r\nking.... Yes, as brother I have treated him ill—very ill, but as king,\r\nupon my soul, I could not have acted differently.... I had to choose\r\nbetween my sword and my crown, and between a regiment and a people.\r\nListen, Brune: you do not know how it all happened. There was an English\r\nfleet, the guns of which were growling in the port, there was a\r\nNeapolitan population howling in the streets. If I had been alone, I\r\nwould have passed through the fleet with one boat, through the crowd\r\nwith my sword alone, but I had a wife and children. Yet I hesitated; the\r\nidea of being called traitor and deserter caused me to shed more tears\r\nthan the loss of my throne, or perhaps the death of those I love best,\r\nwill ever wring from me.... And so he will have nothing more to do with\r\nme? He refuses me as general, captain, private? Then what is left for me\r\nto do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, your Majesty must leave France immediately.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if I don’t obey?\"\r\n\r\n\"My orders are to arrest you and deliver you up to a court-martial!\"\r\n\r\n\"Old comrade, you will not do that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall do it, praying God to strike me dead in the moment I lay hands\r\non you!\"\r\n\r\n\"That’s you all over, Brune. You have been able to remain a good, loyal\r\nfellow. He did not give you a kingdom, he did not encircle your brow\r\nwith a band of iron which men call a crown and which drives one mad; he\r\ndid not place you between your conscience and your family. So I must\r\nleave France, begin my vagabond life again, and say farewell to Toulon,\r\nwhich recalls so many memories to me! See, Brune,\" continued Murat,\r\nleaning on the arm of the marshal, \"are not the pines yonder as fine as\r\nany at the Villa Pamfili, the palms as imposing as any at Cairo, the\r\nmountains as grand as any range in the Tyrol? Look to your left, is not\r\nCape Gien something like Castellamare and Sorrento—leaving out Vesuvius?\r\nAnd see, Saint-Mandrier at the farthest point of the gulf, is it not\r\nlike my rock of Capri, which Lamarque juggled away so cleverly from that\r\nidiot of a Sir Hudson Lowe? My God! and I must leave all this! Is there\r\nno way of remaining on this little corner of French ground—tell me,\r\nBrune!\"\r\n\r\n\"You’ll break my heart, sire!\" answered the marshal.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we’ll say no more about it. What news?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Emperor has left Paris to join the army. They must be fighting\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fighting now and I not there! Oh, I feel I could have been of use to\r\nhim on this battlefield. How I would have gloried in charging those\r\nmiserable Prussians and dastardly English! Brune, give me a passport,\r\nI’ll go at full speed, I’ll reach the army, I will make myself known to\r\nsome colonel, I shall say, ’Give me your regiment.’ I’ll charge at its\r\nhead, and if the Emperor does not clasp my hand to-night, I’ll blow my\r\nbrains out, I swear I will. Do what I ask, Brune, and however it may\r\nend, my eternal gratitude will be yours!\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot, sire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, say no more about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your Majesty is going to leave France?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don’t know. Obey your orders, marshal, and if you come across me\r\nagain, have me arrested. That’s another way of doing something for me.\r\nLife is a heavy burden nowadays. He who will relieve me of it will be\r\nwelcome.... Good-bye, Brune.\"\r\n\r\nHe held out his hand to the marshal, who tried to kiss it; but Murat\r\nopened his arms, the two old comrades held each other fast for a moment,\r\nwith swelling hearts and eyes full of tears; then at last they parted.\r\nBrune remounted his horse, Murat picked up his stick again, and the two\r\nmen went away in opposite directions, one to meet his death by\r\nassassination at Avignon, the other to be shot at Pizzo. Meanwhile, like\r\nRichard III, Napoleon was bartering his crown against a horse at\r\nWaterloo.\r\n\r\nAfter the interview that has just been related, Murat took refuge with\r\nhis nephew, who was called Bonafoux, and who was captain of a frigate;\r\nbut this retreat could only be temporary, for the relationship would\r\ninevitably awake the suspicions of the authorities. In consequence,\r\nBonafoux set about finding a more secret place of refuge for his uncle.\r\nHe hit on one of his friends, an avocat, a man famed for his integrity,\r\nand that very evening Bonafoux went to see him.\r\n\r\nAfter chatting on general subjects, he asked his friend if he had not a\r\nhouse at the seaside, and receiving an affirmative answer, he invited\r\nhimself to breakfast there the next day; the proposal naturally enough\r\nwas agreed to with pleasure. The next day at the appointed hour Bonafoux\r\narrived at Bonette, which was the name of the country house where M.\r\nMarouin’s wife and daughter were staying. M. Marouin himself was kept by\r\nhis work at Toulon. After the ordinary greetings, Bonafoux stepped to\r\nthe window, beckoning to Marouin to rejoin him.\r\n\r\n\"I thought,\" he said uneasily, \"that your house was by the sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are hardly ten minutes’ walk from it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is not in sight.\"\r\n\r\n\"That hill prevents you from seeing it.\"\r\n\r\n\"May we go for a stroll on the beach before breakfast is served?\"\r\n\r\n\"By all means. Well, your horse is still saddled. I will order mine—I\r\nwill come back for you.\"\r\n\r\nMarouin went out. Bonafoux remained at the window, absorbed in his\r\nthoughts. The ladies of the house, occupied in preparations for the\r\nmeal, did not observe, or did not appear to observe, his preoccupation.\r\nIn five minutes Marouin came back. He was ready to start. The avocat and\r\nhis friend mounted their horses and rode quickly down to the sea. On the\r\nbeach the captain slackened his pace, and riding along the shore for\r\nabout half an hour, he seemed to be examining the bearings of the coast\r\nwith great attention. Marouin followed without inquiring into his\r\ninvestigations, which seemed natural enough for a naval officer.\r\n\r\nAfter about an hour the two men went back to the house.\r\n\r\nMarouin wished to have the horses unsaddled, but Bonafoux objected,\r\nsaying that he must go back to Toulon immediately after lunch. Indeed,\r\nthe coffee was hardly finished before he rose and took leave of his\r\nhosts. Marouin, called back to town by his work, mounted his horse too,\r\nand the two friends rode back to Toulon together. After riding along for\r\nten minutes, Bonafoux went close to his companion and touched him on the\r\nthigh—\r\n\r\n\"Marouin,\" he said, \"I have an important secret to confide to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak, captain. After a father confessor, you know there is no one so\r\ndiscreet as a notary, and after a notary an avocat.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can quite understand that I did not come to your country house just\r\nfor the pleasure of the ride. A more important object, a serious\r\nresponsibility, preoccupied me; I have chosen you out of all my friends,\r\nbelieving that you were devoted enough to me to render me a great\r\nservice.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did well, captain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us go straight to the point, as men who respect and trust each\r\nother should do. My uncle, King Joachim, is proscribed, he has taken\r\nrefuge with me; but he cannot remain there, for I am the first person\r\nthey will suspect. Your house is in an isolated position, and\r\nconsequently we could not find a better retreat for him. You must put it\r\nat our disposal until events enable the king to come to some decision.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is at your service,\" said Marouin.\r\n\r\n\"Right. My uncle shall sleep there to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"But at least give me time to make some preparations worthy of my royal\r\nguest.\"\r\n\r\n\"My poor Marouin, you are giving yourself unnecessary trouble, and\r\nmaking a vexatious delay for us: King Joachim is no longer accustomed to\r\npalaces and courtiers; he is only too happy nowadays to find a cottage\r\nwith a friend in it; besides, I have let him know about it, so sure was\r\nI of your answer. He is counting on sleeping at your house to-night, and\r\nif I try to change his determination now he will see a refusal in what\r\nis only a postponement, and you will lose all the credit for your\r\ngenerous and noble action. There—it is agreed: to-night at ten at the\r\nChamps de Mars.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words the captain put his horse to a gallop and disappeared.\r\nMarouin turned his horse and went back to his country house to give the\r\nnecessary orders for the reception of a stranger whose name he did not\r\nmention.\r\n\r\nAt ten o’clock at night, as had been agreed, Marouin was on the Champs\r\nde Mars, then covered with Marshal Brune’s field-artillery. No one had\r\narrived yet. He walked up and down between the gun-carriages until a\r\nfunctionary came to ask what he was doing. He was hard put to it to find\r\nan answer: a man is hardly likely to be wandering about in an artillery\r\npark at ten o’clock at night for the mere pleasure of the thing. He\r\nasked to see the commanding officer. The officer came up: M. Marouin\r\ninformed him that he was an avocat, attached to the law courts of\r\nToulon, and told him that he had arranged to meet someone on the Champs\r\nde Mars, not knowing that it was prohibited, and that he was still\r\nwaiting for that person. After this explanation, the officer authorised\r\nhim to remain, and went back to his quarters. The sentinel, a faithful\r\nadherent to discipline, continued to pace up and down with his measured\r\nstep, without troubling any more about the stranger’s presence.\r\n\r\nA few moments later a group of several persons appeared from the\r\ndirection of Les Lices. The night was magnificent, and the moon\r\nbrilliant. Marouin recognised Bonafoux, and went up to him. The captain\r\nat once took him by the hand and led him to the king, and speaking in\r\nturn to each of them—\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" he said, \"here is the friend. I told you of.\"\r\n\r\nThen turning to Marouin—\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" he said, \"is the King of Naples, exile and fugitive, whom I\r\nconfide to your care. I do not speak of the possibility that some day he\r\nmay get back his crown, that would deprive you of the credit of your\r\nfine action.... Now, be his guide—we will follow at a distance. March!\"\r\n\r\nThe king and the lawyer set out at once together. Murat was dressed in a\r\nblue coat-semi-military, semi-civil, buttoned to the throat; he wore\r\nwhite trousers and top boots with spurs; he had long hair, moustache,\r\nand thick whiskers, which would reach round his neck.\r\n\r\nAs they rode along he questioned his host about the situation of his\r\ncountry house and the facility for reaching the sea in case of a\r\nsurprise. Towards midnight the king and Marouin arrived at Bonette; the\r\nroyal suite came up in about ten minutes; it consisted of about thirty\r\nindividuals. After partaking of some light refreshment, this little\r\ntroop, the last of the court of the deposed king, retired to disperse in\r\nthe town and its environs, and Murat remained alone with the women, only\r\nkeeping one valet named Leblanc.\r\n\r\nMurat stayed nearly a month in this retirement, spending all his time in\r\nanswering the newspapers which accused him of treason to the Emperor.\r\nThis accusation was his absorbing idea, a phantom, a spectre to him; day\r\nand night he tried to shake it off, seeking in the difficult position in\r\nwhich he had found himself all the reasons which it might offer him for\r\nacting as he had acted. Meanwhile the terrible news of the defeat at\r\nWaterloo had spread abroad. The Emperor who had exiled him was an exile\r\nhimself, and he was waiting at Rochefort, like Murat at Toulon, to hear\r\nwhat his enemies would decide against him. No one knows to this day what\r\ninward prompting Napoleon obeyed when, rejecting the counsels of General\r\nLallemande and the devotion of Captain Bodin, he preferred England to\r\nAmerica, and went like a modern Prometheus to be chained to the rock of\r\nSt. Helena.\r\n\r\nWe are going to relate the fortuitous circumstance which led Murat to\r\nthe moat of Pizzo, then we will leave it to fatalists to draw from this\r\nstrange story whatever philosophical deduction may please them. We, as\r\nhumble annalists, can only vouch for the truth of the facts we have\r\nalready related and of those which will follow.\r\n\r\nKing Louis XVIII remounted his throne, consequently Murat lost all hope\r\nof remaining in France; he felt he was bound to go. His nephew Bonafoux\r\nfitted out a frigate for the United States under the name of Prince\r\nRocca Romana. The whole suite went on board, and they began to carry on\r\nto the boat all the valuables which the exile had been able to save from\r\nthe shipwreck of his kingdom. First a bag of gold weighing nearly a\r\nhundred pounds, a sword-sheath on which were the portraits of the king,\r\nthe queen, and their children, the deed of the civil estates of his\r\nfamily bound in velvet and adorned with his arms. Murat carried on his\r\nperson a belt where some precious papers were concealed, with about a\r\nscore of unmounted diamonds, which he estimated himself to be worth four\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\nWhen all these preparations for departing were accomplished, it was\r\nagreed that the next day, the 1st of August, at five o’clock, a boat\r\nshould fetch the king to the brig from a little bay, ten minutes’ walk\r\nfrom the house where he was staying. The king spent the night making out\r\na route for M. Marouin by which he could reach the queen, who was then\r\nin Austria, I think.\r\n\r\nIt was finished just as it was time to leave, and on crossing the\r\nthreshold of the hospitable house where he had found refuge he gave it\r\nto his host, slipped into a volume of a pocket edition of Voltaire.\r\nBelow the story of ’Micromegas’ the king had written: [The volume is\r\nstill in the hands of M. Marouin, at Toulon.]\r\n\r\nReassure yourself, dear Caroline; although unhappy, I am free. I am\r\ndeparting, but I do not know whither I am bound. Wherever I may be my\r\nheart will be with you and my children. \"J. M.\"\r\n\r\nTen minutes later Murat and his host were waiting on the beach at\r\nBonette for the boat which was to take them out to the ship.\r\n\r\nThey waited until midday, and nothing appeared; and yet on the horizon\r\nthey could see the brig which was to be his refuge, unable to lie at\r\nanchor on account of the depth of water, sailing along the coast at the\r\nrisk of giving the alarm to the sentinels.\r\n\r\nAt midday the king, worn out with fatigue and the heat of the sun, was\r\nlying on the beach, when a servant arrived, bringing various\r\nrefreshments, which Madame Marouin, being very uneasy, had sent at all\r\nhazards to her husband. The king took a glass of wine and water and ate\r\nan orange, and got up for a moment to see whether the boat he was\r\nexpecting was nowhere visible on the vastness of the sea. There was not\r\na boat in sight, only the brig tossing gracefully on the horizon,\r\nimpatient to be off, like a horse awaiting its master.\r\n\r\nThe king sighed and lay down again on the sand.\r\n\r\nThe servant went back to Bonette with a message summoning M. Marouin’s\r\nbrother to the beach. He arrived in a few minutes, and almost\r\nimmediately afterwards galloped off at full speed to Toulon, in order to\r\nfind out from M. Bonafoux why the boat had not been sent to the king. On\r\nreaching the captain’s house, he found it occupied by an armed force.\r\nThey were making a search for Murat.\r\n\r\nThe messenger at last made his way through the tumult to the person he\r\nwas in search of, and he heard that the boat had started at the\r\nappointed time, and that it must have gone astray in the creeks of Saint\r\nLouis and Sainte Marguerite. This was, in fact, exactly what had\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nBy five o’clock M. Marouin had reported the news to his brother and the\r\nking. It was bad news. The king had no courage left to defend his life\r\neven by flight, he was in a state of prostration which sometimes\r\noverwhelms the strongest of men, incapable of making any plan for his\r\nown safety, and leaving M. Marouin to do the best he could. Just then a\r\nfisherman was coming into harbour singing. Marouin beckoned to him, and\r\nhe came up.\r\n\r\nMarouin began by buying all the man’s fish; then, when he had paid him\r\nwith a few coins, he let some gold glitter before his eyes, and offered\r\nhim three louis if he would take a passenger to the brig which was lying\r\noff the Croix-des-Signaux. The fisherman agreed to do it. This chance of\r\nescape gave back Murat all his strength; he got up, embraced Marouin,\r\nand begged him to go to the queen with the volume of Voltaire. Then he\r\nsprang into the boat, which instantly left the shore.\r\n\r\nIt was already some distance from the land when the king stopped the man\r\nwho was rowing and signed to Marouin that he had forgotten something. On\r\nthe beach lay a bag into which Murat had put a magnificent pair of\r\npistols mounted with silver gilt which the queen had given him, and\r\nwhich he set great store on. As soon as he was within hearing he shouted\r\nhis reason for returning to his host. Marouin seized the valise, and\r\nwithout waiting for Murat to land he threw it into the boat; the bag\r\nflew open, and one of the pistols fell out. The fisherman only glanced\r\nonce at the royal weapon, but it was enough to make him notice its\r\nrichness and to arouse his suspicions. Nevertheless, he went on rowing\r\ntowards the frigate. M. Marouin seeing him disappear in the distance,\r\nleft his brother on the beach, and bowing once more to the king,\r\nreturned to the house to calm his wife’s anxieties and to take the\r\nrepose of which he was in much need.\r\n\r\nTwo hours later he was awakened. His house was to be searched in its\r\nturn by soldiers. They searched every nook and corner without finding a\r\ntrace of the king. Just as they were getting desperate, the brother came\r\nin; Maroum smiled at him; believing the king to be safe, but by the\r\nnew-comer’s expression he saw that some fresh misfortune was in the\r\nwind. In the first moment’s respite given him by his visitors he went up\r\nto his brother.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, \"I hope the king is on board?\"\r\n\r\n\"The king is fifty yards away, hidden in the outhouse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did he come back?\"\r\n\r\n\"The fisherman pretended he was afraid of a sudden squall, and refused\r\nto take him off to the brig.\"\r\n\r\n\"The scoundrel!\"\r\n\r\nThe soldiers came in again.\r\n\r\nThey spent the night in fruitless searching about the house and\r\nbuildings; several times they passed within a few steps of the king, and\r\nhe could hear their threats and imprecations. At last, half an hour\r\nbefore dawn, they went away. Marouin watched them go, and when they were\r\nout of sight he ran to the king. He found him lying in a corner, a\r\npistol clutched in each hand. The unhappy man had been overcome by\r\nfatigue and had fallen asleep. Marouin hesitated a moment to bring him\r\nback to his wandering, tormented life, but there was not a minute to\r\nlose. He woke him.\r\n\r\nThey went down to the beach at once. A morning mist lay over the sea.\r\nThey could not see anything two hundred yards ahead. They were obliged\r\nto wait. At last the first sunbeams began to pierce this nocturnal mist.\r\nIt slowly dispersed, gliding over the sea as clouds move in the sky. The\r\nking’s hungry eye roved over the tossing waters before him, but he saw\r\nnothing, yet he could not banish the hope that somewhere behind that\r\nmoving curtain he would find his refuge. Little by little the horizon\r\ncame into view; light wreaths of mist, like smoke, still floated about\r\nthe surface of the water, and in each of them the king thought he\r\nrecognised the white sails of his vessel. The last gradually vanished,\r\nthe sea was revealed in all its immensity, it was deserted. Not daring\r\nto delay any longer, the ship had sailed away in the night.\r\n\r\n\"So,\" said the king, \"the die is cast. I will go to Corsica.\"\r\n\r\nThe same day Marshal Brune was assassinated at Avignon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII—CORSICA\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce more on the same beach at Bonette, in the same bay where he had\r\nawaited the boat in vain, still attended by his band of faithful\r\nfollowers, we find Murat on the 22nd August in the same year. It was no\r\nlonger by Napoleon that he was threatened, it was by Louis XVIII that he\r\nwas proscribed; it was no longer the military loyalty of Marshal Brune\r\nwho came with tears in his eyes to give notice of the orders he had\r\nreceived, but the ungrateful hatred of M. de Riviere, who had set a\r\nprice [48,000 francs.] on the head of the man who had saved his\r\nown.[Conspiracy of Pichegru.] M. de Riviere had indeed written to the\r\nex-King of Naples advising him to abandon himself to the good faith and\r\nhumanity of the King of France, but his vague invitation had not seemed\r\nsufficient guarantee to the outlaw, especially on the part of one who\r\nhad allowed the assassination almost before his eyes of a man who\r\ncarried a safe-conduct signed by himself. Murat knew of the massacre of\r\nthe Mamelukes at Marseilles, the assassination of Brune at Avignon; he\r\nhad been warned the day before by the police of Toulon that a formal\r\norder for his arrest was out; thus it was impossible that he should\r\nremain any longer in France. Corsica, with its hospitable towns, its\r\nfriendly mountains, its impenetrable forests, was hardly fifty leagues\r\ndistant; he must reach Corsica, and wait in its towns, mountains, and\r\nforests until the crowned heads of Europe should decide the fate of the\r\nman they had called brother for seven years.\r\n\r\nAt ten o’clock at, night the king went down to the shore. The boat which\r\nwas to take him across had not reached the rendezvous, but this time\r\nthere was not the slightest fear that it would fail; the bay had been\r\nreconnoitred during the day by three men devoted to the fallen fortunes\r\nof the king—Messieurs Blancard, Langlade, and Donadieu, all three naval\r\nofficers, men of ability and warm heart, who had sworn by their own\r\nlives to convey Murat to Corsica, and who were in fact risking their\r\nlives in order to accomplish their promise. Murat saw the deserted shore\r\nwithout uneasiness, indeed this delay afforded him a few more moments of\r\npatriotic satisfaction.\r\n\r\nOn this little patch of land, this strip of sand, the unhappy exile\r\nclung to his mother France, for once his foot touched the vessel which\r\nwas to carry him away, his separation from France would be long, if not\r\neternal. He started suddenly amidst these thoughts and sighed: he had\r\njust perceived a sail gliding over the waves like a phantom through the\r\ntransparent darkness of the southern night. Then a sailor’s song was\r\nheard; Murat recognised the appointed signal, and answered it by burning\r\nthe priming of a pistol, and the boat immediately ran inshore; but as\r\nshe drew three feet of water, she was obliged to stop ten or twelve feet\r\nfrom the beach; two men dashed into the water and reached the beach,\r\nwhile a third remained crouching in the stern-sheets wrapped in his\r\nboat-cloak.\r\n\r\n\"Well, my good friends,\" said the king, going towards Blancard and\r\nLanglade until he felt the waves wet his feet \"the moment is come, is it\r\nnot? The wind is favourable, the sea calm, we must get to sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Langlade, \"yes, we must start; and yet perhaps it would\r\nbe wiser to wait till to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" asked Murat.\r\n\r\nLanglade did not answer, but turning towards the west, he raised his\r\nhand, and according to the habit of sailors, he whistled to call the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\n\"That’s no good,\" said Donadieu, who had remained in the boat. \"Here are\r\nthe first gusts; you will have more than you know what to do with in a\r\nminute.... Take care, Langlade, take care! Sometimes in calling the wind\r\nyou wake up a storm.\"\r\n\r\nMurat started, for he thought that this warning which rose from the sea\r\nhad been given him by the spirit of the waters; but the impression was a\r\npassing one, and he recovered himself in a moment.\r\n\r\n\"All the better,\" he said; \"the more wind we have, the faster we shall\r\ngo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Langlade, \"but God knows where it will take us if it\r\ngoes on shifting like this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don’t start to-night, sire,\" said Blancard, adding his voice to those\r\nof his two companions.\r\n\r\n\"But why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"You see that bank of black cloud there, don’t you? Well, at sunset it\r\nwas hardly visible, now it covers a good part of the sky, in an hour\r\nthere won’t be a star to be seen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you afraid?\" asked Murat.\r\n\r\n\"Afraid!\" answered Langlade. \"Of what? Of the storm? I might as well ask\r\nif your Majesty is afraid of a cannon-ball. We have demurred solely on\r\nyour account, sire; do you think seadogs like ourselves would delay on\r\naccount of the storm?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let us go!\" cried Murat, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, Marouin.... God alone can reward you for what you have done\r\nfor me. I am at your orders, gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words the two sailors seized the king and hoisted him on to\r\ntheir shoulders, and carried him into the sea; in another moment he was\r\non board. Langlade and Blancard sprang in behind him. Donadieu remained\r\nat the helm, the two other officers undertook the management of the\r\nboat, and began their work by unfurling the sails. Immediately the\r\npinnace seemed to rouse herself like a horse at touch of the spur; the\r\nsailors cast a careless glance back, and Murat feeling that they were\r\nsailing away, turned towards his host and called for a last time—\r\n\r\n\"You have your route as far as Trieste. Do not forget my wife!...\r\nGood-bye-good-bye——!\"\r\n\r\n\"God keep you, sire!\" murmured Marouin.\r\n\r\nAnd for some time, thanks to the white sail which gleamed through the\r\ndarkness, he could follow with his eyes the boat which was rapidly\r\ndisappearing; at last it vanished altogether. Marouin lingered on the\r\nshore, though he could see nothing; then he heard a cry, made faint by\r\nthe distance; it was Murat’s last adieu to France.\r\n\r\nWhen M. Marouin was telling me these details one evening on the very\r\nspot where it all happened, though twenty years had passed, he\r\nremembered clearly the slightest incidents of the embarkation that\r\nnight. From that moment he assured me that a presentiment of misfortune\r\nseized him; he could not tear himself away from the shore, and several\r\ntimes he longed to call the king back, but, like a man in a dream, he\r\nopened his mouth without being able to utter a sound. He was afraid of\r\nbeing thought foolish, and it was not until one o’clock that is, two and\r\na half hours after the departure of the boat-that he went home with a\r\nsad and heavy heart.\r\n\r\nThe adventurous navigators had taken the course from Toulon to Bastia,\r\nand at first it seemed to the king that the sailors’ predictions were\r\nbelied; the wind, instead of getting up, fell little by little, and two\r\nhours after the departure the boat was rocking without moving forward or\r\nbackward on the waves, which were sinking from moment to moment. Murat\r\nsadly watched the phosphorescent furrow trailing behind the little boat:\r\nhe had nerved himself to face a storm, but not a dead calm, and without\r\neven interrogating his companions, of whose uneasiness he took no\r\naccount, he lay down in the boat, wrapped in his cloak, closing his eyes\r\nas if he were asleep, and following the flow of his thoughts, which were\r\nfar more tumultuous than that of the waters. Soon the two sailors,\r\nthinking him asleep, joined the pilot, and sitting down beside the helm,\r\nthey began to consult together.\r\n\r\n\"You were wrong, Langlade,\" said Donadieu, \"in choosing a craft like\r\nthis, which is either too small or else too big; in an open boat we can\r\nnever weather a storm, and without oars we can never make any way in a\r\ncalm.\"\r\n\r\n\"’Fore God! I had no choice. I was obliged to take what I could get, and\r\nif it had not been the season for tunny-fishing I might not even have\r\ngot this wretched pinnace, or rather I should have had to go into the\r\nharbour to find it, and they keep such a sharp lookout that I might well\r\nhave gone in without coming out again.\"\r\n\r\n\"At least it is seaworthy,\" said Blancard.\r\n\r\n\"Pardieu, you know what nails and planks are when they have been soaked\r\nin sea-water for ten years. On any ordinary occasion, a man would rather\r\nnot go in her from Marseilles to the Chateau d’If, but on an occasion\r\nlike this one would willingly go round the world in a nutshell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" said Donadieu. The sailors listened; a distant growl was heard,\r\nbut it was so faint that only the experienced ear of a sailor could have\r\ndistinguished it.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Langlade, \"it is a warning for those who have legs or\r\nwings to regain the homes and nests that they ought never to have left.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are we far from the islands?\" asked Donadieu quickly.\r\n\r\n\"About a mile off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Steer for them.\"\r\n\r\n\"What for?\" asked Murat, looking up.\r\n\r\n\"To put in there, sire, if we can.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" cried Murat; \"I will not land except in Corsica. I will not\r\nleave France again. Besides, the sea is calm and the wind is getting up\r\nagain—\"\r\n\r\n\"Down with the sails!\" shouted Donadieu. Instantly Langlade and Blancard\r\njumped forward to carry out the order. The sail slid down the mast and\r\nfell in a heap in the bottom of the boat.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing?\" cried Murat. \"Do you forget that I am king and\r\nthat I command you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" said Donadieu, \"there is a king more powerful than you—God;\r\nthere is a voice which drowns yours—the voice of the tempest: let us\r\nsave your Majesty if possible, and demand nothing more of us.\"\r\n\r\nJust then a flash of lightning quivered along the horizon, a clap of\r\nthunder nearer than the first one was heard, a light foam appeared on\r\nthe surface of the water, and the boat trembled like a living thing.\r\nMurat began to understand that danger was approaching, then he got up\r\nsmiling, threw his hat behind him, shook back his long hair, and\r\nbreathed in the storm like the smell of powder—the soldier was ready for\r\nthe battle.\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" said Donadieu, \"you have seen many a battle, but perhaps you\r\nhave never watched a storm if you are curious about it, cling to the\r\nmast, for you have a fine opportunity now.\"\r\n\r\n\"What ought I to do?\" said Murat. \"Can I not help you in any way?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not just now, sire; later you will be useful at the pumps.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this dialogue the storm had drawn near; it rushed on the\r\ntravellers like a war-horse, breathing out fire and wind through its\r\nnostrils, neighing like thunder, and scattering the foam of the waves\r\nbeneath its feet.\r\n\r\nDonadieu turned the rudder, the boat yielded as if it understood the\r\nnecessity for prompt obedience, and presented the poop to the shock of\r\nwind; then the squall passed, leaving the sea quivering, and everything\r\nwas calm again. The storm took breath.\r\n\r\n\"Will that gust be all?\" asked Murat.\r\n\r\n\"No, your Majesty, that was the advance-guard only; the body of the army\r\nwill be up directly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And are you not going to prepare for it?\" asked the king gaily.\r\n\r\n\"What could we do?\" said Donadieu. \"We have not an inch of canvas to\r\ncatch the wind, and as long as we do not make too much water, we shall\r\nfloat like a cork. Look out-sire!\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, a second hurricane was on its way, bringing rain and lightning;\r\nit was swifter than the first. Donadieu endeavoured to repeat the same\r\nmanoeuvre, but he could not turn before the wind struck the boat, the\r\nmast bent like a reed; the boat shipped a wave.\r\n\r\n\"To the pumps!\" cried Donadieu. \"Sire, now is the moment to help us—\"\r\n\r\nBlancard, Langlade, and Murat seized their hats and began to bale out\r\nthe boat. The position of the four men was terrible—it lasted three\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nAt dawn the wind fell, but the sea was still high. They began to feel\r\nthe need of food: all the provisions had been spoiled by sea-water, only\r\nthe wine had been preserved from its contact.\r\n\r\nThe king took a bottle and swallowed a little wine first, then he passed\r\nit to his companions, who drank in their turn: necessity had overcome\r\netiquette. By chance Langlade had on him a few chocolates, which he\r\noffered to the king. Murat divided them into four equal parts, and\r\nforced his companions to take their shares; then, when the meal was\r\nover, they steered for Corsica, but the boat had suffered so much that\r\nit was improbable that it would reach Bastia.\r\n\r\nThe whole day passed without making ten miles; the boat was kept under\r\nthe jib, as they dared not hoist the mainsail, and the wind was so\r\nvariable that much time was lost in humouring its caprices.\r\n\r\nBy evening the boat had drawn a considerable amount of water, it\r\npenetrated between the boards, the handkerchiefs of the crew served to\r\nplug up the leaks, and night, which was descending in mournful gloom,\r\nwrapped them a second time in darkness. Prostrated with fatigue, Murat\r\nfell asleep, Blancard and Langlade took their places beside Donadieu,\r\nand the three men, who seemed insensible to the calls of sleep and\r\nfatigue, watched over his slumbers.\r\n\r\nThe night was calm enough apparently, but low grumblings were heard now\r\nand then.\r\n\r\nThe three sailors looked at each other strangely and then at the king,\r\nwho was sleeping at the bottom of the boat, his cloak soaked with\r\nsea-water, sleeping as soundly as he had slept on the sands of Egypt or\r\nthe snows of Russia.\r\n\r\nThen one of them got up and went to the other end of the boat, whistling\r\nbetween his teeth a Provencal air; then, after examining the sky, the\r\nwaves; and the boat, he went back to his comrades and sat down,\r\nmuttering, \"Impossible! Except by a miracle, we shall never make the\r\nland.\"\r\n\r\nThe night passed through all its phases. At dawn there was a vessel in\r\nsight.\r\n\r\n\"A sail!\" cried Donadieu,—\"a sail!\"\r\n\r\nAt this cry the king—awoke; and soon a little trading brig hove in\r\nsight, going from Corsica to Toulon.\r\n\r\nDonadieu steered for the brig, Blancard hoisted enough sail to work the\r\nboat, and Langlade ran to the prow and held up the king’s cloak on the\r\nend of a sort of harpoon. Soon the voyagers perceived that they had been\r\nsighted, the brig went about to approach them, and in ten minutes they\r\nfound themselves within fifty yards of it. The captain appeared in the\r\nbows. Then the king hailed him and offered him a substantial reward if\r\nhe would receive them on board and take them to Corsica. The captain\r\nlistened to the proposal; then immediately turning to the crew, he gave\r\nan order in an undertone which Donadieu could not hear, but which he\r\nunderstood probably by the gesture, for he instantly gave Langlade and\r\nBlancard the order to make away from the schooner. They obeyed with the\r\nunquestioning promptitude of sailors; but the king stamped his foot.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing, Donadieu? What are you about? Don’t you see that\r\nshe is coming up to us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes—upon my soul—so she is.... Do as I say, Langlade; ready, Blancard.\r\nYes, she is coming upon us, and perhaps I was too late in seeing this.\r\nThat’s all right—that’s all right: my part now.\"\r\n\r\nThen he forced over the rudder, giving it so violent a jerk that the\r\nboat, forced to change her course suddenly, seemed to rear and plunge\r\nlike a horse struggling against the curb; finally she obeyed. A huge\r\nwave, raised by the giant bearing down on the pinnace, carried it on\r\nlike a leaf, and the brig passed within a few feet of the stern.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!.... traitor!\" cried the king, who had only just begun to realise\r\nthe intention of the captain. At the some time, he pulled a pistol from\r\nhis belt, crying \"Board her! board her!\" and tried to fire on the brig,\r\nbut the powder was wet and would not catch. The king was furious, and\r\nwent on shouting \"Board her! board her!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the wretch, or rather the imbecile,\" said Donadieu, \"he took us\r\nfor pirates, and wanted to sink us—as if we needed him to do that!\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, a single glance at the boat showed that she was beginning to\r\nmake water.\r\n\r\nThe effort—to escape which Donadieu had made had strained the boat\r\nterribly, and the water was pouring in by a number of leaks between the\r\nplanks; they had to begin again bailing out with their hats, and went on\r\nat it for ten hours. Then for the second time Donadieu heard the\r\nconsoling cry, \"A sail! a sail!\" The king and his companions immediately\r\nleft off bailing; they hoisted the sails again, and steered for the\r\nvessel which was coming towards them, and neglected to fight against the\r\nwater, which was rising rapidly.\r\n\r\nFrom that time forth it was a question of time, of minutes, of seconds;\r\nit was a question of reaching the ship before the boat foundered.\r\n\r\nThe vessel, however, seemed to understand the desperate position of the\r\nmen imploring help; she was coming up at full speed. Langlade was the\r\nfirst to recognise her; she was a Government felucca plying between\r\nToulon and Bastia. Langlade was a friend of the captain, and he called\r\nhis name with the penetrating voice of desperation, and he was heard. It\r\nwas high time: the water kept on rising, and the king and his companions\r\nwere already up to their knees; the boat groaned in its death-struggle;\r\nit stood still, and began to go round and round.\r\n\r\nJust then two or three ropes thrown from the felucca fell upon the boat;\r\nthe king seized one, sprang forward, and reached the rope-ladder: he was\r\nsaved.\r\n\r\nBlancard and Langlade immediately followed. Donadieu waited until the\r\nlast, as was his duty, and as he put his foot on the ladder he felt the\r\nother boat begin to go under; he turned round with all a sailor’s calm,\r\nand saw the gulf open its jaws beneath him, and then the shattered boat\r\ncapsized, and immediately disappeared. Five seconds more, and the four\r\nmen who were saved would have been lost beyond recall! [These details\r\nare well known to the people of Toulon, and I have heard them myself a\r\nscore of times during the two stays that I made in that town during 1834\r\nand 1835. Some of the people who related them had them first-hand from\r\nLanglade and Donadieu themselves.]\r\n\r\nMurat had hardly gained the deck before a man came and fell at his feet:\r\nit was a Mameluke whom he had taken to Egypt in former years, and had\r\nsince married at Castellamare; business affairs had taken him to\r\nMarseilles, where by a miracle he had escaped the massacre of his\r\ncomrades, and in spite of his disguise and fatigue he had recognised his\r\nformer master.\r\n\r\nHis exclamations of joy prevented the king from keeping up his\r\nincognito. Then Senator Casabianca, Captain Oletta, a nephew of Prince\r\nBaciocchi, a staff-paymaster called Boerco, who were themselves fleeing\r\nfrom the massacres of the South, were all on board the vessel, and\r\nimprovising a little court, they greeted the king with the title of\r\n\"your Majesty.\" It had been a sudden embarkation, it brought about a\r\nswift change: he was no longer Murat the exile; he was Joachim, the King\r\nof Naples. The exile’s refuge disappeared with the foundered boat; in\r\nits place Naples and its magnificent gulf appeared on the horizon like a\r\nmarvellous mirage, and no doubt the primary idea of the fatal expedition\r\nof Calabria was originated in the first days of exultation which\r\nfollowed those hours of anguish. The king, however, still uncertain of\r\nthe welcome which awaited him in Corsica, took the name of the Count of\r\nCampo Melle, and it was under this name that he landed at Bastia on the\r\n25th August. But this precaution was useless; three days after his\r\narrival, not a soul but knew of his presence in the town.\r\n\r\nCrowds gathered at once, and cries of \"Long live Joachim!\" were heard,\r\nand the king, fearing to disturb the public peace, left Bastia the same\r\nevening with his three companions and his Mameluke. Two hours later he\r\narrived at Viscovato, and knocked at the door of General Franceschetti,\r\nwho had been in his service during his whole reign, and who, leaving\r\nNaples at the same time as the king, had gone to Corsica with his wife,\r\nto live with his father-in-law, M. Colonna Cicaldi.\r\n\r\nHe was in the middle of supper when a servant told him that a stranger\r\nwas asking to speak to him—he went out, and found Murat wrapped in a\r\nmilitary greatcoat, a sailor’s cap drawn down on his head, his beard\r\ngrown long, and wearing a soldier’s trousers, boots, and gaiters.\r\n\r\nThe general stood still in amazement; Murat fixed his great dark eyes on\r\nhim, and then, folding his arms:—\r\n\r\n\"Franceschetti,\" said he, \"have you room at your table for your general,\r\nwho is hungry? Have you a shelter under your roof for your king, who is\r\nan exile?\"\r\n\r\nFranceschetti looked astonished as he recognised Joachim, and could only\r\nanswer him by falling on his knees and kissing his hand. From that\r\nmoment the general’s house was at Murat’s disposal.\r\n\r\nThe news of the king’s arrival had hardly been handed about the\r\nneighbourhood before officers of all ranks hastened to Viscovato,\r\nveterans who had fought under him, Corsican hunters who were attracted\r\nby his adventurous character; in a few days the general’s house was\r\nturned into a palace, the village into a royal capital, the island into\r\na kingdom.\r\n\r\nStrange rumours were heard concerning Murat’s intentions. An army of\r\nnine hundred men helped to give them some amount of confirmation. It was\r\nthen that Blancard, Donadieu, and Langlade took leave of him; Murat\r\nwished to keep them, but they had been vowed to the rescue of the exile,\r\nnot to the fortunes of the king.\r\n\r\nWe have related how Murat had met one of his former Mamelukes, a man\r\ncalled Othello, on board the Bastia mailboat. Othello had followed him\r\nto Viscovato, and the ex-King of Naples considered how to make use of\r\nhim. Family relations recalled him naturally to Castellamare, and Murat\r\nordered him to return there, entrusting to him letters for persons on\r\nwhose devotion he could depend. Othello started, and reached his\r\nfather-in-law’s safely, and thought he could confide in him; but the\r\nlatter was horror-struck, and alarmed the police, who made a descent on\r\nOthello one night, and seized the letters.\r\n\r\nThe next day each man to whom a letter was addressed was arrested and\r\nordered to answer Murat as if all was well, and to point out Salerno as\r\nthe best place for disembarking: five out of seven were dastards enough\r\nto obey; the two remaining, who were two Spanish brothers, absolutely\r\nrefused; they were thrown into a dungeon.\r\n\r\nHowever, on the 17th September, Murat left Viscovato; General\r\nFranceschetti and several Corsican officers served as escort; he took\r\nthe road to Ajaccio by Cotone, the mountains of Serra and Bosco, Venaco\r\nand Vivaro, by the gorges of the forest of Vezzanovo and Bogognone; he\r\nwas received and feted like a king everywhere, and at the gates of the\r\ntowns he was met by deputations who made him speeches and saluted him\r\nwith the title of \"Majesty\"; at last, on the 23rd September, he arrived\r\nat Ajaccio. The whole population awaited him outside the walls, and his\r\nentry into the town was a triumphal procession; he was taken to the inn\r\nwhich had been fixed upon beforehand by the quartermasters. It was\r\nenough to turn the head of a man less impressionable than Murat; as for\r\nhim, he was intoxicated with it. As he went into the inn he held out his\r\nhand to Franceschetti.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" he said, \"what the Neapolitans will do for me by the way the\r\nCorsicans receive me.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the first mention which had escaped him of his plans for the\r\nfuture, and from that very day he began to give orders for his\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nThey collected ten little feluccas: a Maltese, named Barbara, former\r\ncaptain of a frigate of the Neapolitan navy, was appointed\r\ncommander-in-chief of the expedition; two hundred and fifty men were\r\nrecruited and ordered to hold themselves in readiness for the first\r\nsignal.\r\n\r\nMurat was only waiting for the answers to Othello’s letters: they\r\narrived on the afternoon of the 28th. Murat invited all his officers to\r\na grand dinner, and ordered double pay and double rations to the men.\r\n\r\nThe king was at dessert when the arrival of M. Maceroni was announced to\r\nhim: he was the envoy of the foreign powers who brought Murat the answer\r\nwhich he had been awaiting so long at Toulon. Murat left the table and\r\nwent into another room. M. Maceroni introduced himself as charged with\r\nan official mission, and handed the king the Emperor of Austria’s\r\nultimatum. It was couched in the following terms:\r\n\r\n    \"Monsieur Maceroni is authorised by these presents to announce to\r\n     King Joachim that His Majesty the Emperor of Austria will afford him\r\n     shelter in his States on the following terms:—\r\n\r\n     \"1. The king is to take a private name.  The queen having adopted\r\n     that of Lipano, it is proposed that the king should do likewise.\r\n\r\n     \"2. It will be permitted to the king to choose a town in Bohemia,\r\n     Moravia, or the Tyrol, as a place of residence.  He could even\r\n     inhabit a country house in one of these same provinces without\r\n     inconvenience.\r\n\r\n     \"3. The king is to give his word of honour to His Imperial and Royal\r\n     Majesty that he will never leave the States of Austria without the\r\n     express−permission of the Emperor, and that he is to live like a\r\n     private gentleman of distinction, but submitting to the laws in force\r\n     in the States of Austria.\r\n\r\n     \"In attestation whereof, and to guard against abuse, the undersigned\r\n     has received the order of the Emperor to sign the present\r\n     declaration.\r\n\r\n     \"(Signed) PRINCE OF METTERNICH\r\n\r\n     \"PARIS, 1st Sept.  1815.\"\r\n\r\nMurat smiled as he finished reading, then he signed to M. Maceroni to\r\nfollow him:\r\n\r\nHe led him on to the terrace of the house, which looked over the whole\r\ntown, and over which a banner floated as it might on a royal castle.\r\nFrom thence they could see Ajaccio all gay and illuminated, the port\r\nwith its little fleet, and the streets crowded with people, as if it\r\nwere a fete-day.\r\n\r\nHardly had the crowd set eyes on Murat before a universal cry arose,\r\n\"Long live Joachim, brother of Napoleon! Long live the King of Naples!\"\r\n\r\nMurat bowed, and the shouts were redoubled, and the garrison band played\r\nthe national airs.\r\n\r\n  M. Maceroni did not know how to believe his own eyes and ears.\r\n\r\nWhen the king had enjoyed his astonishment, he invited him to go down to\r\nthe drawing-room. His staff were there, all in full uniform: one might\r\nhave been at Caserte or at Capo di Monte. At last, after a moment’s\r\nhesitation, Maceroni approached Murat.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" he said, \"what is my answer to be to His Majesty the Emperor of\r\nAustria?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" answered Murat, with the lofty dignity which sat so well on his\r\nfine face, \"tell my brother Francis what you have seen and heard, and\r\nadd that I am setting out this very night to reconquer my kingdom of\r\nNaples.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII—PIZZO\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letters which had made Murat resolve to leave Corsica had been\r\nbrought to him by a Calabrian named Luidgi. He had presented himself to\r\nthe king as the envoy of the Arab, Othello, who had been thrown into\r\nprison in Naples, as we have related, as well as the seven recipients of\r\nthe letters.\r\n\r\nThe answers, written by the head of the Neapolitan police, indicated the\r\nport of Salerno as the best place for Joachim to land; for King\r\nFerdinand had assembled three thousand Austrian troops at that point,\r\nnot daring to trust the Neapolitan soldiers, who cherished a brilliant\r\nand enthusiastic memory of Murat.\r\n\r\nAccordingly the flotilla was directed for the Gulf of Salerno, but\r\nwithin sight of the island of Capri a violent storm broke over it, and\r\ndrove it as far as Paola, a little seaport situated ten miles from\r\nCosenza. Consequently the vessels were anchored for the night of the 5th\r\nof October in a little indentation of the coast not worthy of the name\r\nof a roadstead. The king, to remove all suspicion from the coastguards\r\nand the Sicilian scorridori, [Small vessels fitted up as ships-of-war.]\r\nordered that all lights should be extinguished and that the vessels\r\nshould tack about during the night; but towards one o’clock such a\r\nviolent land-wind sprang up that the expedition was driven out to sea,\r\nso that on the 6th at dawn the king’s vessel was alone.\r\n\r\nDuring the morning they overhauled Captain Cicconi’s felucca, and the\r\ntwo ships dropped anchor at four o’clock in sight of Santo-Lucido. In\r\nthe evening the king commanded Ottoviani, a staff officer, to go ashore\r\nand reconnoitre. Luidgi offered to accompany him. Murat accepted his\r\nservices. So Ottoviani and his guide went ashore, whilst Cicconi and his\r\nfelucca put out to sea in search of the rest of the fleet.\r\n\r\nTowards eleven o’clock at night the lieutenant of the watch descried a\r\nman in the waves swimming to the vessel. As soon as he was within\r\nhearing the lieutenant hailed him. The swimmer immediately made himself\r\nknown: it was Luidgi. They put out the boat, and he came on board. Then\r\nhe told them that Ottoviani had been arrested, and he had only escaped\r\nhimself by jumping into the sea. Murat’s first idea was to go to the\r\nrescue of Ottoviani; but Luidgi made the king realise the danger and\r\nuselessness of such an attempt; nevertheless, Joachim remained agitated\r\nand irresolute until two o’clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nAt last he gave the order to put to sea again. During the manoeuvre\r\nwhich effected this a sailor fell overboard and disappeared before they\r\nhad time to help him. Decidedly these were ill omens.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 7th two vessels were in sight. The king gave the\r\norder to prepare for action, but Barbara recognised them as Cicconi’s\r\nfelucca and Courrand’s lugger, which had joined each other and were\r\nkeeping each other company. They hoisted the necessary signals, and the\r\ntwo captains brought up their vessels alongside the admiral’s.\r\n\r\nWhile they were deliberating as to what route to follow, a boat came up\r\nto Murat’s vessel. Captain Pernice was on board with a lieutenant. They\r\ncame to ask the king’s permission to board his ship, not wishing to\r\nremain on Courrand’s, for in their opinion he was a traitor.\r\n\r\nMurat sent to fetch him, and in spite of his protestations he was made\r\nto descend into a boat with fifty men, and the boat was moored to the\r\nvessel. The order was carried out at once, and the little squadron\r\nadvanced, coasting along the shores of Calabria without losing sight of\r\nthem; but at ten o’clock in the evening, just as they came abreast of\r\nthe Gulf of Santa-Eufemia, Captain Courrand cut the rope which moored\r\nhis boat to the vessel, and rowed away from the fleet.\r\n\r\nMurat had thrown himself on to his bed without undressing; they brought\r\nhim the news.\r\n\r\nHe rushed up to the deck, and arrived in time to see the boat, which was\r\nfleeing in the direction of Corsica, grow small and vanish in the\r\ndistance. He remained motionless, not uttering a cry, giving no signs of\r\nrage; he only sighed and let his head fall on his breast: it was one\r\nmore leaf falling from the exhausted tree of his hopes.\r\n\r\nGeneral Franceschetti profited by this hour of discouragement to advise\r\nhim not to land in Calabria, and to go direct to Trieste, in order to\r\nclaim from Austria the refuge which had been offered.\r\n\r\nThe king was going through one of those periods of extreme exhaustion,\r\nof mortal depression, when courage quite gives way: he refused flatly at\r\nfirst, and there at last agreed to do it.\r\n\r\nJust then the general perceived a sailor lying on some coils of ropes,\r\nwithin hearing of all they said; he interrupted himself, and pointed him\r\nout to Murat.\r\n\r\nThe latter got up, went to see the man, and recognised Luidgi; overcome\r\nwith exhaustion, he had fallen asleep on deck. The king satisfied\r\nhimself that the sleep was genuine, and besides he had full confidence\r\nin the man. The conversation, which had been interrupted for a moment,\r\nwas renewed: it was agreed that without saying anything about the new\r\nplans, they would clear Cape Spartivento and enter the Adriatic; then\r\nthe king and the general went below again to the lower deck.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 8th October, they found themselves abreast of Pizzo,\r\nwhen Joachim, questioned by Barbara as to what he proposed to do, gave\r\nthe order to steer for Messina. Barbara answered that he was ready to\r\nobey, but that they were in need of food and water; consequently he\r\noffered to go on, board Cicconi’s vessel and to land with him to get\r\nstores. The king agreed; Barbara asked for the passports which he had\r\nreceived from the allied powers, in order, he said, not to be molested\r\nby the local authorities.\r\n\r\nThese documents were too important for Murat to consent to part with\r\nthem; perhaps the king was beginning to suspect: he refused. Barbara\r\ninsisted; Murat ordered him to land without the papers; Barbara flatly\r\nrefused.\r\n\r\nThe king, accustomed to being obeyed, raised his riding-whip to strike\r\nthe Maltese, but, changing his resolution, he ordered the soldiers to\r\nprepare their arms, the officers to put on full uniform; he himself set\r\nthe example. The disembarkation was decided upon, and Pizzo was to\r\nbecome the Golfe Juan of the new Napoleon.\r\n\r\nConsequently the vessels were steered for land. The king got down into a\r\nboat with twenty-eight soldiers and three servants, amongst whom was\r\nLuidgi. As they drew near the shore General Franceschetti made a\r\nmovement as if to land, but Murat stopped him.\r\n\r\n\"It is for me to land first,\" he said, and he sprang on shore.\r\n\r\nHe was dressed in a general’s coat, white breeches and riding-boots, a\r\nbelt carrying two pistols, a gold-embroidered hat with a cockade\r\nfastened in with a clasp made of fourteen brilliants, and lastly he\r\ncarried under his arm the banner round which he hoped to rally his\r\npartisans. The town clock of Pizzo struck ten. Murat went straight up to\r\nthe town, from which he was hardly a hundred yards distant. He followed\r\nthe wide stone staircase which led up to it.\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday. Mass was about to be celebrated, and the whole population\r\nhad assembled in the Great Square when he arrived. No one recognised\r\nhim, and everyone gazed with astonishment at the fine officer. Presently\r\nhe saw amongst the peasants a former sergeant of his who had served in\r\nhis guard at Naples. He walked straight up to him and put his hand on\r\nthe man’s shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Tavella,\" he said, \"don’t you recognise me?\"\r\n\r\nBut as the man made no answer:\r\n\r\n\"I am Joachim Murat, I am your king,\" he said. \"Yours be the honour to\r\nshout ’Long live Joachim!’ first.\"\r\n\r\nMurat’s suite instantly made the air ring with acclamations, but the\r\nCalabrians remained silent, and not one of his comrades took up the cry\r\nfor which the king himself had given the signal; on the contrary, a low\r\nmurmur ran through the crowd. Murat well understood this forerunner of\r\nthe storm.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said to Tavella, \"if you won’t cry ’Long live Joachim!’ you\r\ncan at least fetch me a horse, and from sergeant I will promote you to\r\nbe captain.\"\r\n\r\nTavella walked away without answering, but instead of carrying out the\r\nking’s behest, went into his house, and did not appear again.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the people were massing together without evincing any of\r\nthe sympathy that the king had hoped for. He felt that he was lost if he\r\ndid not act instantly.\r\n\r\n\"To Monteleone!\" he cried, springing forward towards the road which led\r\nto that town.\r\n\r\n\"To Monteleone!\" shouted his officers and men, as they followed him.\r\n\r\nAnd the crowd, persistently silent, opened to let them pass.\r\n\r\nBut they had hardly left the square before a great disturbance broke\r\nout. A man named Giorgio Pellegrino came out of his house with a gun and\r\ncrossed the square, shouting, \"To your arms!\"\r\n\r\nHe knew that Captain Trenta Capelli commanding the Cosenza garrison was\r\njust then in Pizzo, and he was going to warn him.\r\n\r\nThe cry \"To arms!\" had more effect on the crowd than the cry \"Long live\r\nJoachim!\"\r\n\r\nEvery Calabrian possesses a gun, and each one ran to fetch his, and when\r\nTrenta Capelli and Giorgio Pellegrino came back to the square they found\r\nnearly two hundred armed men there.\r\n\r\nThey placed themselves at the head of the column, and hastened forward\r\nin pursuit of the king; they came up with him about ten minutes from the\r\nsquare, where the bridge is nowadays. Seeing them, Murat stopped and\r\nwaited for them.\r\n\r\nTrenta Capelli advanced, sword in hand, towards the king.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said the latter, \"will you exchange your captain’s epaulettes for\r\na general’s? Cry ’Long live Joachim!’ and follow me with these brave\r\nfellows to Monteleone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" said Trenta Capelli, \"we are the faithful subjects of King\r\nFerdinand, and we come to fight you, and not to bear you company. Give\r\nyourself up, if you would prevent bloodshed.\"\r\n\r\nMurat looked at the captain with an expression which it would be\r\nimpossible to describe; then without deigning to answer, he signed to\r\nCagelli to move away, while his other hand went to his pistol. Giotgio\r\nPellegrino perceived the movement.\r\n\r\n\"Down, captain, down!\" he cried. The captain obeyed. Immediately a\r\nbullet whistled over his head and brushed Murat’s head.\r\n\r\n\"Fire!\" commanded Franceschetti.\r\n\r\n\"Down with your arms!\" cried Murat.\r\n\r\nWaving his handkerchief in his right hand, he made a step towards the\r\npeasants, but at the same moment a number of shots were fired, an\r\nofficer and two or three men fell. In a case like this, when blood has\r\nbegun to flow, there is no stopping it.\r\n\r\nMurat knew this fatal truth, and his course of action was rapidly\r\ndecided on. Before him he had five hundred armed men, and behind him a\r\nprecipice thirty feet high: he sprang from the jagged rock on which he\r\nwas standing, and alighting on the sand, jumped up safe and sound.\r\nGeneral Franceschetti and his aide-de-camp Campana were able to\r\naccomplish the jump in the same way, and all three went rapidly down to\r\nthe sea through the little wood which lay within a hundred yards of the\r\nshore, and which hid them for a few moments from their enemies.\r\n\r\nAs they came out of the wood a fresh discharge greeted them, bullets\r\nwhistled round them, but no one was hit, and the three fugitives went on\r\ndown to the beach.\r\n\r\nIt was only then that the king perceived that the boat which had brought\r\nthem to land had gone off again. The three ships which composed the\r\nfleet, far from remaining to guard his landing, were sailing away at\r\nfull speed into the open sea.\r\n\r\nThe Maltese, Barbara, was going off not only with Murat’s fortune, but\r\nwith his hopes likewise, his salvation, his very life. They could not\r\nbelieve in such treachery, and the king took it for some manoeuvre of\r\nseamanship, and seeing a fishing-boat drawn up on the beach on some\r\nnets, he called to his two companions, \"Launch that boat!\"\r\n\r\nThey all began to push it down to the sea with the energy of despair,\r\nthe strength of agony.\r\n\r\nNo one had dared to leap from the rock in pursuit of them; their\r\nenemies, forced to make a detour, left them a few moments of liberty.\r\n\r\nBut soon shouts were heard: Giorgio Pellegrino, Trenta Capelli, followed\r\nby the whole population of Pizzo, rushed out about a hundred and fifty\r\npaces from where Murat, Franceschetti, and Campana were straining\r\nthemselves to make the boat glide down the sand.\r\n\r\nThese cries were immediately followed by a volley. Campana fell, with a\r\nbullet through his heart.\r\n\r\nThe boat, however, was launched. Franceschetti sprang into it, Murat was\r\nabout to follow, but he had not observed that the spurs of his\r\nriding-boots had caught in the meshes of the net. The boat, yielding to\r\nthe push he gave it, glided away, and the king fell head foremost, with\r\nhis feet on land and his face in the water. Before he had time to pick\r\nhimself up, the populace had fallen on him: in one instant they had torn\r\naway his epaulettes, his banner, and his coat, and would have torn him\r\nto bits himself, had not Giorgio Pellegrino and Trenta Capelli taken him\r\nunder their protection, and giving him an arm on each side, defended him\r\nin their turn against the people. Thus he crossed the square as a\r\nprisoner where an hour before he had walked as a king.\r\n\r\nHis captors took him to the castle: he was pushed into the common\r\nprison, the door was shut upon him, and the king found himself among\r\nthieves and murderers, who, not knowing him, took him for a companion in\r\ncrime, and greeted him with foul language and hoots of derision.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour later the door of the gaol opened and Commander\r\nMattei came in: he found Murat standing with head proudly erect and\r\nfolded arms. There was an expression of indefinable loftiness in this\r\nhalf-naked man whose face was stained with blood and bespattered with\r\nmud. Mattei bowed before him.\r\n\r\n\"Commander,\" said Murat, recognising his rank by his epaulettes, \"look\r\nround you and tell me whether this is a prison for a king.\"\r\n\r\nThen a strange thing happened: the criminals, who, believing Murat their\r\naccomplice, had welcomed him with vociferations and laughter, now bent\r\nbefore his royal majesty, which had not overawed Pellegrino and Trenta\r\nCapelli, and retired silently to the depths of their dungeon.\r\n\r\nMisfortune had invested Murat with a new power.\r\n\r\nCommander Mattei murmured some excuse, and invited Murat to follow him\r\nto a room that he had had prepared for him; but before going out, Murat\r\nput his hand in his pocket and pulled out a handful of gold and let it\r\nfall in a shower in the midst of the gaol.\r\n\r\n\"See,\" he said, turning towards the prisoners, \"it shall not be said\r\nthat you have received a visit from a king, prisoner and crownless as he\r\nis, without having received largesse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Long live Joachim!\" cried the prisoners.\r\n\r\nMurat smiled bitterly. Those same words repeated by the same number of\r\nvoices an hour before in the public square, instead of resounding in the\r\nprison, would have made him King of Naples.\r\n\r\nThe most important events proceed sometimes from such mere trifles, that\r\nit seems as if God and the devil must throw dice for the life or death\r\nof men, for the rise or fall of empires.\r\n\r\nMurat followed Commander Mattei: he led him to a little room which the\r\nporter had put at his disposal. Mattei was going to retire when Murat\r\ncalled him back.\r\n\r\n\"Commander,\" he said, \"I want a scented bath.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, it will be difficult to obtain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here are fifty ducats; let someone buy all the eau de Cologne that can\r\nbe obtained. Ah—and let some tailors be sent to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be impossible to find anyone here capable of making anything\r\nbut a peasant’s clothes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Send someone to Monteleone to fetch them from there.\"\r\n\r\nThe commander bowed and went out.\r\n\r\nMurat was in his bath when the Lavaliere Alcala was announced, a General\r\nand Governor of the town. He had sent damask coverlets, curtains, and\r\narm-chairs. Murat was touched by this attention, and it gave him fresh\r\ncomposure. At two o’clock the same day General Nunziante arrived from\r\nSanta-Tropea with three thousand men. Murat greeted his old acquaintance\r\nwith pleasure; but at the first word the king perceived that he was\r\nbefore his judge, and that he had not come for the purpose of making a\r\nvisit, but to make an official inquiry.\r\n\r\nMurat contented himself with stating that he had been on his way from\r\nCorsica to Trieste with a passport from the Emperor of Austria when\r\nstormy weather and lack of provisions had forced him to put into Pizzo.\r\nAll other questions Murat met with a stubborn silence; then at least,\r\nwearied by his importunity—\r\n\r\n\"General,\" he said, \"can you lend me some clothes after my bath?\"\r\n\r\nThe general understood that he could expect no more information, and,\r\nbowing to the king, he went out. Ten minutes later, a complete uniform\r\nwas brought to Murat; he put it on immediately, asked for a pen and ink,\r\nwrote to the commander-in-chief of the Austrian troops at Naples, to the\r\nEnglish ambassador, and to his wife, to tell them of his detention at\r\nPizzo. These letters written, he got up and paced his room for some time\r\nin evident agitation; at last, needing fresh air, he opened the window.\r\nThere was a view of the very beach where he had been captured.\r\n\r\nTwo men were digging a hole in the sand at the foot of the little\r\nredoubt. Murat watched them mechanically. When the two men had finished,\r\nthey went into a neighbouring house and soon came out, bearing a corpse\r\nin their arms.\r\n\r\nThe king searched his memory, and indeed it seemed to him that in the\r\nmidst of that terrible scene he had seen someone fall, but who it was he\r\nno longer remembered. The corpse was quite without covering, but by the\r\nlong black hair and youthful outlines the king recognised Campana, the\r\naide-decamp he had always loved best.\r\n\r\nThis scene, watched from a prison window in the twilight, this solitary\r\nburial on the shore, in the sand, moved Murat more deeply than his own\r\nfate. Great tears filled his eyes and fell silently down the leonine\r\nface. At that moment General Nunziante came in and surprised him with\r\noutstretched arms and face bathed with tears. Murat heard him enter and\r\nturned round, and seeing the old soldier’s surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, general,\" he said, \"I weep; I weep for that boy, just twenty-four,\r\nentrusted to me by his parents, whose death I have brought about. I weep\r\nfor that vast, brilliant future which is buried in an unknown grave, in\r\nan enemy’s country, on a hostile shore. Oh, Campana! Campana! if ever I\r\nam king again, I will raise you a royal tomb.\"\r\n\r\nThe general had had dinner served in an adjacent room. Murat followed\r\nhim and sat down to table, but he could not eat. The sight which he had\r\njust witnessed had made him heartbroken, and yet without a line on his\r\nbrow that man had been through the battles of Aboukir, Eylau, and\r\nMoscow! After dinner, Murat went into his room again, gave his various\r\nletters to General Nunziante, and begged to be left alone. The general\r\nwent away.\r\n\r\nMurat paced round his room several times, walking with long steps, and\r\npausing from time to time before the window, but without opening it.\r\n\r\nAt last he overcame a deep reluctance, put his hand on the bolt and drew\r\nthe lattice towards him.\r\n\r\nIt was a calm, clear night: one could see the whole shore. He looked for\r\nCampana’s grave. Two dogs scratching the sand showed him the spot.\r\n\r\nThe king shut the window violently, and without undressing threw himself\r\nonto his bed. At last, fearing that his agitation would be attributed to\r\npersonal alarm, he undressed and went to bed, to sleep, or seem to sleep\r\nall night.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 9th the tailors whom Murat had asked for arrived.\r\nHe ordered a great many clothes, taking the trouble to explain all the\r\ndetails suggested by his fastidious taste. He was thus employed when\r\nGeneral Nunziante came in. He listened sadly to the king’s commands. He\r\nhad just received telegraphic despatches ordering him to try the King of\r\nNaples by court-martial as a public enemy. But he found the king so\r\nconfident, so tranquil, almost cheerful indeed, that he had not the\r\nheart to announce his trial to him, and took upon himself to delay the\r\nopening of operation until he received written instructions. These\r\narrived on the evening of the 12th. They were couched in the following\r\nterms:\r\n\r\n                             NAPLES, October 9, 1815\r\n\r\n    \"Ferdinand, by the grace of God, etc .  .  .  .  wills and decrees\r\n    the following:\r\n\r\n    \"Art.  1.  General Murat is to be tried by court−martial, the members\r\n    whereof are to be nominated by our Minister of War.\r\n\r\n    \"Art.  2.  Only half an hour is to be accorded to the condemned for\r\n    the exercises of religion.\r\n\r\n    \"(Signed) FERDINAND.\"\r\n\r\nAnother despatch from the minister contained the names of the members of\r\nthe commission. They were:—\r\n\r\nGiuseppe Fosculo, adjutant, commander-in-chief of the staff, president.\r\n\r\nLaffaello Scalfaro, chief of the legion of Lower Calabria.\r\n\r\nLatereo Natali, lieutenant-colonel of the Royal Marines.\r\n\r\nGennaro Lanzetta, lieutenant-colonel of the Engineers.\r\n\r\n  W. T. captain of Artillery.\r\n\r\nFrancois de Venge, ditto.\r\n\r\nFrancesco Martellari, lieutenant of Artillery.\r\n\r\nFrancesco Froio, lieutenant in the 3rd regiment of the line.\r\n\r\nGiovanni delta Camera, Public Prosecutor to the Criminal Courts of Lower\r\nCalabria.\r\n\r\nFrancesco Papavassi, registrar.\r\n\r\nThe commission assembled that night.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th October, at six o’clock in the morning, Captain Stratti came\r\ninto the king’s prison; he was sound asleep. Stratti was going away\r\nagain, when he stumbled against a chair; the noise awoke Murat.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want with me, captain?\" asked the king.\r\n\r\nStratti tried to speak, but his voice failed him.\r\n\r\n\"Ah ha!\" said Murat, \"you must have had news from Naples.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire,\" muttered Stratti.\r\n\r\n\"What are they?\" said Murat.\r\n\r\n\"Your trial, sire.\"\r\n\r\n\"And by whose order will sentence be pronounced, if you please? Where\r\nwill they find peers to judge me? If they consider me as a king, I must\r\nhave a tribunal of kings; if I am a marshal of France, I must have a\r\ncourt of marshals; if I am a general, and that is the least I can be, I\r\nmust have a jury of generals.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, you are declared a public enemy, and as such you are liable to be\r\njudged by court-martial: that is the law which you instituted yourself\r\nfor rebels.\"\r\n\r\n\"That law was made for brigands, and not for crowned heads, sir,\" said\r\nMurat scornfully. \"I am ready; let them butcher me if they like. I did\r\nnot think King Ferdinand capable of such an action.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, will you not hear the names of your judges?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, I will. It must be a curious list. Read it: I am listening.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Stratti read out the names that we have enumerated. Murat\r\nlistened with a disdainful smile.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" he said, as the captain finished, \"it seems that every precaution\r\nhas been taken.\"\r\n\r\n\"How, sire?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Don’t you know that all these men, with the exception of Francesco\r\nFroio, the reporter; owe their promotion to me? They will be afraid of\r\nbeing accused of sparing me out of gratitude, and save one voice,\r\nperhaps, the sentence will be unanimous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, suppose you were to appear before the court, to plead your own\r\ncause?\"\r\n\r\n\"Silence, sir, silence!\" said Murat. \"I could, not officially recognise\r\nthe judges you have named without tearing too many pages of history.\r\nSuch tribunal is quite incompetent; I should be disgraced if I appeared\r\nbefore it. I know I could not save my life, let me at least preserve my\r\nroyal dignity.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment Lieutenant Francesco Froio came in to interrogate the\r\nprisoner, asking his name, his age, and his nationality. Hearing these\r\nquestions, Murat rose with an expression of sublime dignity.\r\n\r\n\"I am Joachim Napoleon, King of the Two Sicilies,\" he answered, \"and I\r\norder you to leave me.\"\r\n\r\nThe registrar obeyed.\r\n\r\nThen Murat partially dressed himself, and asked Stratti if he could\r\nwrite a farewell to his wife and children. The Captain no longer able to\r\nspeak, answered by an affirmative sign; then Joachim sat down to the\r\ntable and wrote this letter:\r\n\r\n\"DEAR CAROLINE OF MY HEART,—The fatal moment has come: I am to suffer\r\nthe death penalty. In an hour you will be a widow, our children will be\r\nfatherless: remember me; never forget my memory. I die innocent; my life\r\nis taken from me unjustly.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, Achilles good-bye, Laetitia; goodbye, Lucien; good-bye,\r\nLouise.\r\n\r\n\"Show yourselves worthy of me; I leave you in a world and in a kingdom\r\nfull of my enemies. Show yourselves superior to adversity, and remember\r\nnever to think yourselves better than you are, remembering what you have\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\n\"Farewell. I bless you all. Never curse my memory. Remember that the\r\nworst pang of my agony is in dying far from my children, far from my\r\nwife, without a friend to close my eyes. Farewell, my own Caroline.\r\nFarewell, my children. I send you my blessing, my most tender tears, my\r\nlast kisses. Farewell, farewell. Never forget your unhappy father,\r\n\r\n\"Pizzo, Oct. 13, 1815\"\r\n\r\n[We can guarantee the authenticity of this letter, having copied it\r\nourselves at Pizzo, from the Lavaliere Alcala’s copy of the original]\r\n\r\nThen he cut off a lock of his hair and put it in his letter. Just then\r\nGeneral Nunziante came in; Murat went to him and held out his hand.\r\n\r\n\"General,\" he said, \"you are a father, you are a husband, one day you\r\nwill know what it is to part from your wife and sons. Swear to me that\r\nthis letter shall be delivered.\"\r\n\r\n\"On my epaulettes,\" said the general, wiping his eyes. [Madame Murat\r\nnever received this letter.]\r\n\r\n\"Come, come, courage, general,\" said Murat; \"we are soldiers, we know\r\nhow to face death. One favour—you will let me give the order to fire,\r\nwill you not?\"\r\n\r\nThe general signed acquiescence: just then the registrar came in with\r\nthe king’s sentence in his hand.\r\n\r\nMurat guessed what it was.\r\n\r\n\"Read, sir,\" he said coldly; \"I am listening.\"\r\n\r\nThe registrar obeyed. Murat was right.\r\n\r\nThe sentence of death had been carried with only one dissentient voice.\r\n\r\nWhen the reading was finished, the king turned again to Nunziante.\r\n\r\n\"General,\" he said, \"believe that I distinguish in my mind the\r\ninstrument which strikes me and the hand that wields that instrument. I\r\nshould never have thought that Ferdinand would have had me shot like a\r\ndog; he does not hesitate apparently before such infamy. Very well. We\r\nwill say no more about it. I have challenged my judges, but not my\r\nexecutioners. What time have you fixed for my execution?\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you fix it yourself, sir?\" said the general.\r\n\r\nMurat pulled out a watch on which there was a portrait of his wife; by\r\nchance he turned up the portrait, and not the face of the watch; he\r\ngazed at it tenderly.\r\n\r\n\"See, general,\" he said, showing it to Nunziante; \"it is a portrait of\r\nthe queen. You know her; is it not like her?\"\r\n\r\nThe general turned away his head. Murat sighed and put away the watch.\r\n\r\n\"Well, sire,\" said the registrar, \"what time have you fixed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah yes,\" said Murat, smiling, \"I forgot why I took out my watch when I\r\nsaw Caroline’s portrait.\"\r\n\r\nThen he looked at his watch again, but this time at its face.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it shall be at four o’clock, if you like; it is past three\r\no’clock. I ask for fifty minutes. Is that too much, sir?\"\r\n\r\nThe registrar bowed and went out. The general was about to follow him.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I never see you again, Nunziante?\" said Murat.\r\n\r\n\"My orders are to be present at your death, sire, but I cannot do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, general. I will dispense with your presence at the last\r\nmoment, but I should like to say farewell once more and to embrace you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will be near, sire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. Now leave me alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, there are two priests here.\"\r\n\r\nMurat made an impatient movement.\r\n\r\n\"Will you receive them?\" continued the general.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; bring them in.\"\r\n\r\nThe general went out. A moment later, two priests appeared in the\r\ndoorway. One of them was called Francesco Pellegrino, uncle of the man\r\nwho had caused the king’s death; the other was Don Antonio Masdea.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want here?\" asked Murat.\r\n\r\n\"We come to ask you if you are dying a Christian?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am dying as a soldier. Leave me.\"\r\n\r\nDon Francesco Pellegrino retired. No doubt he felt ill at ease before\r\nJoachim. But Antonio Masdea remained at the door.\r\n\r\n\"Did you not hear me?\" asked the king.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed,\" answered the old man; \"but permit me, sire, to hope that\r\nit was not your last word to me. It is not, the first time that I see\r\nyou or beg something of you. I have already had occasion to ask a favour\r\nof you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was that?\"\r\n\r\n\"When your Majesty came to Pizzo in 1810, I asked you for 25,000 francs\r\nto enable us to finish our church. Your Majesty sent me 40,000 francs.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must have foreseen that I should be buried there,\" said Murat,\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, sire, I should like to think that you did not refuse my second boon\r\nany more than my first. Sire, I entreat you on my knees.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man fell at Murat’s feet.\r\n\r\n\"Die as a Christian!\"\r\n\r\n\"That would give you pleasure, then, would it?\" said the king.\r\n\r\n\"Sire, I would give the few short days remaining to me if God would\r\ngrant that His Holy Spirit should fall upon you in your last hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Murat, \"hear my confession. I accuse myself of having been\r\ndisobedient to my parents as a child. Since I reached manhood I have\r\ndone nothing to reproach myself with.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, will you give me an attestation that you die in the Christian\r\nfaith?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said Murat.\r\n\r\nAnd he took a pen and wrote: \"I, Joachim Murat, die a Christian,\r\nbelieving in the Holy Catholic Church, Apostolic and Roman.\"\r\n\r\nHe signed it.\r\n\r\n\"Now, father,\" continued the king, \"if you have a third favour to ask of\r\nme, make haste, for in half an hour it will be too late.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, the castle clock was striking half-past three. The priest signed\r\nthat he had finished.\r\n\r\n\"Then leave me alone,\" said Murat; and the old man went out.\r\n\r\nMurat paced his room for a few moments, then he sat down on his bed and\r\nlet his head fall into his hands. Doubtless, during the quarter of an\r\nhour he remained thus absorbed in his thoughts, he saw his whole life\r\npass before him, from the inn where he had started to the palace he had\r\nreached; no doubt his adventurous career unrolled itself before him like\r\nsome golden dream, some brilliant fiction, some tale from the Arabian\r\nNights.\r\n\r\nHis life gleamed athwart the storm like a rainbow, and like a rainbow’s,\r\nits two extremities were lost in clouds—the clouds of birth and death.\r\nAt last he roused himself from this inward contemplation, and lifted a\r\npale but tranquil face. Then he went to the glass and arranged his hair.\r\nHis strange characteristics never left him. The affianced of Death, he\r\nwas adorning himself to meet his bride.\r\n\r\nFour o’clock struck.\r\n\r\nMurat went to the door himself and opened it.\r\n\r\nGeneral Nunziante was waiting for him.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, general,\" said Murat. \"You have kept your word. Kiss me, and\r\ngo at once, if you like.\"\r\n\r\nThe general threw himself into the king’s arms, weeping, and utterly\r\nunable to speak.\r\n\r\n\"Courage,\" said Murat. \"You see I am calm.\" It was this very calmness\r\nwhich broke the general’s heart. He dashed out of the corridor, and left\r\nthe castle, running like a madman.\r\n\r\nThen the king walked out into the courtyard.\r\n\r\nEverything was ready for the execution.\r\n\r\nNine men and a corporal were ranged before the door of the council\r\nchamber. Opposite them was a wall twelve feet high. Three feet away from\r\nthe wall was a stone block: Murat mounted it, thus raising himself about\r\na foot above the soldiers who were to execute him. Then he took out his\r\nwatch,[Madame Murat recovered this watch at the price of 200 Louis]\r\nkissed his wife’s portrait, and fixing his eyes on it, gave the order to\r\nfire. At the word of command five out of the nine men fired: Murat\r\nremained standing. The soldiers had been ashamed to fire on their king,\r\nand had aimed over his head. That moment perhaps displayed most\r\ngloriously the lionlike courage which was Murat’s special attribute. His\r\nface never changed, he did not move a muscle; only gazing at the\r\nsoldiers with an expression of mingled bitterness and gratitude, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Thank you; my friends. Since sooner or later you will be obliged to aim\r\ntrue, do not prolong my death-agonies. All I ask you is to aim at the\r\nheart and spare the face. Now——\"\r\n\r\nWith the same voice, the same calm, the same expression, he repeated the\r\nfatal words one after another, without lagging, without hastening, as if\r\nhe were giving an accustomed command; but this time, happier than the\r\nfirst, at the word \"Fire!\" he fell pierced by eight bullets, without a\r\nsigh, without a movement, still holding the watch in his left hand.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers took up the body and laid it on the bed where ten minutes\r\nbefore he had been sitting, and the captain put a guard at the door.\r\n\r\nIn the evening a man presented himself, asking to go into the\r\ndeath-chamber: the sentinel refused to let him in, and he demanded an\r\ninterview with the governor of the prison. Led before him, he produced\r\nan order. The commander read it with surprise and disgust, but after\r\nreading it he led the man to the door where he had been refused\r\nentrance.\r\n\r\n\"Pass the Signor Luidgi,\" he said to the sentinel.\r\n\r\nTen minutes had hardly elapsed before he came out again, holding a\r\nbloodstained handkerchief containing something to which the sentinel\r\ncould not give a name.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, the carpenter brought the coffin which was to contain the\r\nking’s remains. The workman entered the room, but instantly called the\r\nsentinel in a voice of indescribable terror.\r\n\r\nThe sentinel half opened the door to see what had caused the man’s\r\npanic.\r\n\r\nThe carpenter pointed to a headless corpse!\r\n\r\nAt the death of King Ferdinand, that, head, preserved in spirits of\r\nwine, was found in a secret cupboard in his bedroom.\r\n\r\nA week after the execution of Pizzo everyone had received his reward:\r\nTrenta Capelli was made a colonel, General Nunziante a marquis, and\r\nLuidgi died from the effects of poison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*THE MARQUISE DE BRINVILLIERS*\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the year 1665, on a fine autumn evening, there was a\r\nconsiderable crowd assembled on the Pont-Neuf where it makes a turn down\r\nto the rue Dauphine. The object of this crowd and the centre of\r\nattraction was a closely shut, carriage. A police official was trying to\r\nforce open the door, and two out of the four sergeants who were with him\r\nwere holding the horses back and the other two stopping the driver, who\r\npaid no attention to their commands, but only endeavoured to urge his\r\nhorses to a gallop. The struggle had been going on same time, when\r\nsuddenly one of the doors violently pushed open, and a young officer in\r\nthe uniform of a cavalry captain jumped down, shutting the door as he\r\ndid so though not too quickly for the nearest spectators to perceive a\r\nwoman sitting at the back of the carriage. She was wrapped in cloak and\r\nveil, and judging by the precautions she, had taken to hide her face\r\nfrom every eye, she must have had her reasons for avoiding recognition.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said the young man, addressing the officer with a haughty air, \"I\r\npresume, till I find myself mistaken, that your business is with me\r\nalone; so I will ask you to inform me what powers you may have for thus\r\nstopping my coach; also, since I have alighted, I desire you to give\r\nyour men orders to let the vehicle go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"First of all,\" replied the man, by no means intimidated by these lordly\r\nairs, but signing to his men that they must not release the coach or the\r\nhorses, \"be so good as to answer my questions.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am attending,\" said the young man, controlling his agitation by a\r\nvisible effort.\r\n\r\n\"Are you the Chevalier Gaudin de Sainte-Croix?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am he.\"\r\n\r\n\"Captain of the Tracy, regiment?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I arrest you in the king’s name.\"\r\n\r\n\"What powers have you?\"\r\n\r\n\"This warrant.\"\r\n\r\nSainte-Croix cast a rapid glance at the paper, and instantly recognised\r\nthe signature of the minister of police: he then apparently confined his\r\nattention to the woman who was still in the carriage; then he returned\r\nto his first question.\r\n\r\n\"This is all very well, sir,\" he said to the officer, \"but this warrant\r\ncontains no other name than mine, and so you have no right to expose\r\nthus to the public gaze the lady with whom I was travelling when you\r\narrested me. I must beg of you to order your assistants to allow this\r\ncarriage to drive on; then take me where you please, for I am ready to\r\ngo with you.\"\r\n\r\nTo the officer this request seemed a just one: he signed to his men to\r\nlet the driver and the horses go on; and, they, who had waited only for\r\nthis, lost no time in breaking through the crowd, which melted away\r\nbefore them; thus the woman escaped for whose safety the prisoner seemed\r\nso much concerned.\r\n\r\nSainte-Croix kept his promise and offered no resistance; for some\r\nmoments he followed the officer, surrounded by a crowd which seemed to\r\nhave transferred all its curiosity to his account; then, at the corner\r\nof the Quai de d’Horloge, a man called up a carriage that had not been\r\nobserved before, and Sainte-Croix took his place with the same haughty\r\nand disdainful air that he had shown throughout the scene we have just\r\ndescribed. The officer sat beside him, two of his men got up behind, and\r\nthe other two, obeying no doubt their master’s orders, retired with a\r\nparting direction to the driver.\r\n\r\n\"The Bastille!\"\r\n\r\nOur readers will now permit us to make them more fully acquainted with\r\nthe man who is to take the first place in the story. The origin of\r\nGaudin de Sainte-Croix was not known: according to one tale, he was the\r\nnatural son of a great lord; another account declared that he was the\r\noffspring of poor people, but that, disgusted with his obscure birth, he\r\npreferred a splendid disgrace, and therefore chose to pass for what he\r\nwas not. The only certainty is that he was born at Montauban, and in\r\nactual rank and position he was captain of the Tracy regiment. At the\r\ntime when this narrative opens, towards the end of 1665, Sainte-Croix\r\nwas about twenty-eight or thirty, a fine young man of cheerful and\r\nlively appearance, a merry comrade at a banquet, and an excellent\r\ncaptain: he took his pleasure with other men, and was so impressionable\r\na character that he enjoyed a virtuous project as well as any plan for a\r\ndebauch; in love he was most susceptible, and jealous to the point of\r\nmadness even about a courtesan, had she once taken his fancy; his\r\nprodigality was princely, although he had no income; further, he was\r\nmost sensitive to slights, as all men are who, because they are placed\r\nin an equivocal position, fancy that everyone who makes any reference to\r\ntheir origin is offering an intentional insult.\r\n\r\nWe must now see by what a chain of circumstances he had arrived at his\r\npresent position. About the year 1660, Sainte-Croix, while in the army,\r\nhad made the acquaintance of the Marquis de Brinvilliers, maitre-de-camp\r\nof the Normandy regiment.\r\n\r\nTheir age was much the same, and so was their manner of life: their\r\nvirtues and their vices were similar, and thus it happened that a mere\r\nacquaintance grew into a friendship, and on his return from the field\r\nthe marquis introduced Sainte-Croix to his wife, and he became an\r\nintimate of the house. The usual results followed. Madame de\r\nBrinvilliers was then scarcely eight-and-twenty: she had married the\r\nmarquis in 1651-that is, nine years before. He enjoyed an income of\r\n30,000 livres, to which she added her dowry of 200,000 livres, exclusive\r\nof her expectations in the future. Her name was Marie-Madeleine; she had\r\na sister and two brothers: her father, M. de Dreux d’Aubray; was civil\r\nlieutenant at the Chatelet de Paris. At the age of twenty-eight the\r\nmarquise was at the height of her beauty: her figure was small but\r\nperfectly proportioned; her rounded face was charmingly pretty; her\r\nfeatures, so regular that no emotion seemed to alter their beauty,\r\nsuggested the lines of a statue miraculously endowed with life: it was\r\neasy enough to mistake for the repose of a happy conscience the cold,\r\ncruel calm which served as a mask to cover remorse.\r\n\r\nSainte-Croix and the marquise loved at first sight, and she was soon his\r\nmistress. The marquis, perhaps endowed with the conjugal philosophy\r\nwhich alone pleased the taste of the period, perhaps too much occupied\r\nwith his own pleasure to see what was going on before his eyes, offered\r\nno jealous obstacle to the intimacy, and continued his foolish\r\nextravagances long after they had impaired his fortunes: his affairs\r\nbecame so entangled that the marquise, who cared for him no longer, and\r\ndesired a fuller liberty for the indulgence of her new passion, demanded\r\nand obtained a separation. She then left her husband’s house, and\r\nhenceforth abandoning all discretion, appeared everywhere in public with\r\nSainte-Croix. This behaviour, authorised as it was by the example of the\r\nhighest nobility, made no impression upon the. Marquis of Brinvilliers,\r\nwho merrily pursued the road to ruin, without worrying about his wife’s\r\nbehaviour. Not so M. de Dreux d’Aubray: he had the scrupulosity of a\r\nlegal dignitary. He was scandalised at his daughter’s conduct, and\r\nfeared a stain upon his own fair name: he procured a warrant for the\r\narrest of Sainte-Croix wheresoever the bearer might chance to encounter\r\nhim. We have seen how it was put in execution when Sainte-Croix was\r\ndriving in the carriage of the marquise, whom our readers will doubtless\r\nhave recognised as the woman who concealed herself so carefully.\r\n\r\nFrom one’s knowledge of the character of Sainte-Croix, it is easy to\r\nimagine that he had to use great self-control to govern the anger he\r\nfelt at being arrested in the middle of the street; thus, although\r\nduring the whole drive he uttered not a single word, it was plain to see\r\nthat a terrible storm was gathering, soon to break. But he preserved the\r\nsame impossibility both at the opening and shutting of the fatal gates,\r\nwhich, like the gates of hell, had so often bidden those who entered\r\nabandon all hope on their threshold, and again when he replied to the\r\nformal questions put to him by the governor. His voice was calm, and\r\nwhen they gave him the prison register he signed it with a steady hand.\r\nAt once a gaoler, taking his orders from the governor, bade him follow:\r\nafter traversing various corridors, cold and damp, where the daylight\r\nmight sometimes enter but fresh air never, he opened a door, and\r\nSainte-Croix had no sooner entered than he heard it locked behind him.\r\n\r\nAt the grating of the lock he turned. The gaoler had left him with no\r\nlight but the rays of the moon, which, shining through a barred window\r\nsome eight or ten feet from the ground, shed a gleam upon a miserable\r\ntruckle-bed and left the rest of the room in deep obscurity. The\r\nprisoner stood still for a moment and listened; then, when he had heard\r\nthe steps die away in the distance and knew himself to be alone at last,\r\nhe fell upon the bed with a cry more like the roaring of a wild beast\r\nthan any human sound: he cursed his fellow-man who had snatched him from\r\nhis joyous life to plunge him into a dungeon; he cursed his God who had\r\nlet this happen; he cried aloud to whatever powers might be that could\r\ngrant him revenge and liberty.\r\n\r\nJust at that moment, as though summoned by these words from the bowels\r\nof the earth, a man slowly stepped into the circle of blue light that\r\nfell from the window-a man thin and pale, a man with long hair, in a\r\nblack doublet, who approached the foot of the bed where Sainte-Croix\r\nlay. Brave as he was, this apparition so fully answered to his prayers\r\n(and at the period the power of incantation and magic was still believed\r\nin) that he felt no doubt that the arch-enemy of the human race, who is\r\ncontinually at hand, had heard him and had now come in answer to his\r\nprayers. He sat up on the bed, feeling mechanically at the place where\r\nthe handle of his sword would have been but two hours since, feeling his\r\nhair stand on end, and a cold sweat began to stream down his face as the\r\nstrange fantastic being step by step approached him. At length the\r\napparition paused, the prisoner and he stood face to face for a moment,\r\ntheir eyes riveted; then the mysterious stranger spoke in gloomy tones.\r\n\r\n\"Young man,\" said he, \"you have prayed to the devil for vengeance on the\r\nmen who have taken you, for help against the God who has abandoned you.\r\nI have the means, and I am here to proffer it. Have you the courage to\r\naccept?\"\r\n\r\n\"First of all,\" asked Sainte-Croix; \"who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why seek you to know who I am,\" replied the unknown, \"at the very\r\nmoment when I come at your call, and bring what you desire?\"\r\n\r\n\"All the same,\" said Sainte-Croix, still attributing what he heard to a\r\nsupernatural being, \"when one makes a compact of this kind, one prefers\r\nto know with whom one is treating.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, since you must know,\" said the stranger, \"I am the Italian\r\nExili.\"\r\n\r\nSainte-Croix shuddered anew, passing from a supernatural vision to a\r\nhorrible reality. The name he had just heard had a terrible notoriety at\r\nthe time, not only in France but in Italy as well. Exili had been driven\r\nout of Rome, charged with many poisonings, which, however, could not be\r\nsatisfactorily brought home to him. He had gone to Paris, and there, as\r\nin his native country, he had drawn the eyes of the authorities upon\r\nhimself; but neither in Paris nor in Rome was he, the pupil of Rene and\r\nof Trophana, convicted of guilt. All the same, though proof was wanting,\r\nhis enormities were so well accredited that there was no scruple as to\r\nhaving him arrested. A warrant was out against him: Exili was taken up,\r\nand was lodged in the Bastille. He had been there about six months when\r\nSainte-Croix was brought to the same place. The prisoners were numerous\r\njust then, so the governor had his new guest put up in the same room as\r\nthe old one, mating Exili and Sainte-Croix, not knowing that they were a\r\npair of demons. Our readers now understand the rest. Sainte-Croix was\r\nput into an unlighted room by the gaoler, and in the dark had failed to\r\nsee his companion: he had abandoned himself to his rage, his\r\nimprecations had revealed his state of mind to Exili, who at once seized\r\nthe occasion for gaining a devoted and powerful disciple, who once out\r\nof prison might open the doors for him, perhaps, or at least avenge his\r\nfate should he be incarcerated for life.\r\n\r\nThe repugnance felt by Sainte-Croix for his fellow-prisoner did not last\r\nlong, and the clever master found his pupil apt. Sainte-Croix, a strange\r\nmixture of qualities good and evil, had reached the supreme crisis of\r\nhis life, when the powers of darkness or of light were to prevail.\r\nMaybe, if he had met some angelic soul at this point, he would have been\r\nled to God; he encountered a demon, who conducted him to Satan.\r\n\r\nExili was no vulgar poisoner: he was a great artist in poisons,\r\ncomparable with the Medici or the Borgias. For him murder was a fine\r\nart, and he had reduced it to fixed and rigid rules: he had arrived at a\r\npoint when he was guided not by his personal interest but by a taste for\r\nexperiment. God has reserved the act of creation for Himself, but has\r\nsuffered destruction to be within the scope of man: man therefore\r\nsupposes that in destroying life he is God’s equal. Such was the nature\r\nof Exili’s pride: he was the dark, pale alchemist of death: others might\r\nseek the mighty secret of life, but he had found the secret of\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nFor a time Sainte-Croix hesitated: at last he yielded to the taunts of\r\nhis companion, who accused Frenchmen of showing too much honour in their\r\ncrimes, of allowing themselves to be involved in the ruin of their\r\nenemies, whereas they might easily survive them and triumph over their\r\ndestruction. In opposition to this French gallantry, which often\r\ninvolves the murderer in a death more cruel than that he has given, he\r\npointed to the Florentine traitor with his amiable smile and his deadly\r\npoison. He indicated certain powders and potions, some of them of dull\r\naction, wearing out the victim so slowly that he dies after long\r\nsuffering; others violent and so quick, that they kill like a flash of\r\nlightning, leaving not even time for a single cry. Little by little\r\nSainte-Croix became interested in the ghastly science that puts the\r\nlives of all men in the hand of one. He joined in Exili’s experiments;\r\nthen he grew clever enough to make them for himself; and when, at the\r\nyear’s end, he left the Bastille, the pupil was almost as accomplished\r\nas his master.\r\n\r\nSainte-Croix returned into that society which had banished him,\r\nfortified by a fatal secret by whose aid he could repay all the evil he\r\nhad received. Soon afterwards Exili was set free—how it happened is not\r\nknown—and sought out Sainte-Croix, who let him a room in the name of his\r\nsteward, Martin de Breuille, a room situated in the blind, alley off the\r\nPlace Maubert, owned by a woman called Brunet.\r\n\r\nIt is not known whether Sainte-Croix had an opportunity of seeing the\r\nMarquise de Brinvilliers during his sojourn in the Bastille, but it is\r\ncertain that as soon as he was a free man the lovers were more attached\r\nthan ever. They had learned by experience, however, of what they had to\r\nfear; so they resolved that they would at once make trial of\r\nSainte-Croix’s newly acquired knowledge, and M. d’Aubray was selected by\r\nhis daughter for the first victim. At one blow she would free herself\r\nfrom the inconvenience of his rigid censorship, and by inheriting his\r\ngoods would repair her own fortune, which had been almost dissipated by\r\nher husband. But in trying such a bold stroke one must be very sure of\r\nresults, so the marquise decided to experiment beforehand on another\r\nperson. Accordingly, when one day after luncheon her maid, Francoise\r\nRoussel, came into her room, she gave her a slice of mutton and some\r\npreserved gooseberries for her own meal. The girl unsuspiciously ate\r\nwhat her mistress gave her, but almost at once felt ill, saying she had\r\nsevere pain in the stomach, and a sensation as though her heart were\r\nbeing pricked with pins. But she did not die, and the marquise perceived\r\nthat the poison needed to be made stronger, and returned it to\r\nSainte-Croix, who brought her some more in a few days’ time.\r\n\r\nThe moment had come for action. M. d’Aubray, tired with business, was to\r\nspend a holiday at his castle called Offemont. The marquise offered to\r\ngo with him. M. d’Aubray, who supposed her relations with Sainte-Croix\r\nto be quite broken off, joyfully accepted. Offemont was exactly the\r\nplace for a crime of this nature. In the middle of the forest of Aigue,\r\nthree or four miles from Compiegne, it would be impossible to get\r\nefficient help before the rapid action of the poison had made it\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\n  M. d’Aubray started with his daughter and one servant only. Never had\r\n     the marquise been so devoted to her father, so especially\r\n     attentive, as she was during this journey. And M. d’Aubray, like\r\n     Christ—who though He had no children had a father’s heart—loved his\r\n     repentant daughter more than if she had never strayed. And then the\r\n     marquise profited by the terrible calm look which we have already\r\n     noticed in her face: always with her father, sleeping in a room\r\n     adjoining his, eating with him, caring for his comfort in every\r\n     way, thoughtful and affectionate, allowing no other person to do\r\n     anything for him, she had to present a smiling face, in which the\r\n     most suspicious eye could detect nothing but filial tenderness,\r\n     though the vilest projects were in her heart. With this mask she\r\n     one evening offered him some soup that was poisoned. He took it;\r\n     with her eyes she saw him put it to his lips, watched him drink it\r\n     down, and with a brazen countenance she gave no outward sign of\r\n     that terrible anxiety that must have been pressing on her heart.\r\n     When he had drunk it all, and she had taken with steady hands the\r\n     cup and its saucer, she went back to her own room, waited and\r\n     listened....\r\n\r\nThe effect was rapid. The marquise heard her father moan; then she heard\r\ngroans. At last, unable to endure his sufferings, he called out to his\r\ndaughter. The marquise went to him. But now her face showed signs of the\r\nliveliest anxiety, and it was for M. d’Aubray to try to reassure her\r\nabout himself! He thought it was only a trifling indisposition, and was\r\nnot willing that a doctor should be disturbed. But then he was seized by\r\na frightful vomiting, followed by such unendurable pain that he yielded\r\nto his daughter’s entreaty that she should send for help. A doctor\r\narrived at about eight o’clock in the morning, but by that time all that\r\ncould have helped a scientific inquiry had been disposed of: the doctor\r\nsaw nothing, in M. d’Aubray’s story but what might be accounted for by\r\nindigestion; so he dosed him, and went back to Compiegne.\r\n\r\nAll that day the marquise never left the sick man. At night she had a\r\nbed made up in his room, declaring that no one else must sit up with\r\nhim; thus she, was able to watch the progress of the malady and see with\r\nher own eyes the conflict between death and life in the body of her\r\nfather. The next day the doctor came again: M. d’Aubray was worse; the\r\nnausea had ceased, but the pains in the stomach were now more acute; a\r\nstrange fire seemed to burn his vitals; and a treatment was ordered\r\nwhich necessitated his return to Paris. He was soon so weak that he\r\nthought it might be best to go only so far as Compiegne, but the\r\nmarquise was so insistent as to the necessity for further and better\r\nadvice than anything he could get away from home, that M. d’Aubray\r\ndecided to go. He made the journey in his own carriage, leaning upon his\r\ndaughter’s shoulder; the behaviour of the marquise was always the same:\r\nat last M. d’Aubray reached Paris. All had taken place as the marquise\r\ndesired; for the scene was now changed: the doctor who had witnessed the\r\nsymptoms would not be present at the death; no one could discover the\r\ncause by studying the progress of the disorder; the thread of\r\ninvestigation was snapped in two, and the two ends were now too distant\r\nto be joined again. In spite, of every possible attention, M. d’Aubray\r\ngrew continually worse; the marquise was faithful to her mission, and\r\nnever left him for an hour. At last, after four days of agony, he died\r\nin his daughter’s arms, blessing the woman who was his murderess. Her\r\ngrief then broke forth uncontrolled. Her sobs and tears were so vehement\r\nthat her brothers’ grief seemed cold beside hers. Nobody suspected a\r\ncrime, so no autopsy was held; the tomb was closed, and not the\r\nslightest suspicion had approached her.\r\n\r\nBut the marquise had only gained half her purpose. She had now more\r\nfreedom for her love affairs, but her father’s dispositions were not so\r\nfavourable as she expected: the greater part of his property, together\r\nwith his business, passed to the elder brother and to the second\r\nbrother, who was Parliamentary councillor; the position of, the marquise\r\nwas very little improved in point of fortune.\r\n\r\nSainte-Croix was leading a fine and joyous life. Although nobody\r\nsupposed him to be wealthy, he had a steward called Martin, three\r\nlackeys called George, Lapierre, and Lachaussee, and besides his coach\r\nand other carriages he kept ordinary bearers for excursions at night. As\r\nhe was young and good-looking, nobody troubled about where all these\r\nluxuries came from. It was quite the custom in those days that a\r\nwell-set-up young gentleman should want for nothing, and Sainte-Croix\r\nwas commonly said to have found the philosopher’s stone. In his life in\r\nthe world he had formed friendships with various persons, some noble,\r\nsome rich: among the latter was a man named Reich de Penautier,\r\nreceiver-general of the clergy and treasurer of the States of Languedoc,\r\na millionaire, and one of those men who are always successful, and who\r\nseem able by the help of their money to arrange matters that would\r\nappear to be in the province of God alone. This Penautier was connected\r\nin business with a man called d’Alibert, his first clerk, who died all\r\nof a sudden of apoplexy. The attack was known to Penautier sooner than\r\nto his own family: then the papers about the conditions of partnership\r\ndisappeared, no one knew how, and d’Alibert’s wife and child were\r\nruined. D’Alibert’s brother-in-law, who was Sieur de la Magdelaine, felt\r\ncertain vague suspicions concerning this death, and wished to get to the\r\nbottom of it; he accordingly began investigations, which were suddenly\r\nbrought to an end by his death.\r\n\r\nIn one way alone Fortune seemed to have abandoned her favourite: Maitre\r\nPenautier had a great desire to succeed the Sieur of Mennevillette, who\r\nwas receiver of the clergy, and this office was worth nearly 60,000\r\nlivres. Penautier knew that Mennevillette was retiring in favour of his\r\nchief clerk, Messire Pierre Hannyvel, Sieur de Saint-Laurent, and he had\r\ntaken all the necessary, steps for buying the place over his head: the\r\nSieur de Saint-Laurent, with the full support of the clergy, obtained\r\nthe reversion for nothing—a thing that never happened before. Penautier\r\nthen offered him 40,000 crowns to go halves, but Saint-Laurent refused.\r\nTheir relations, however, were not broken off, and they continued to\r\nmeet. Penautier was considered such a lucky fellow that it was generally\r\nexpected he would somehow or other get some day the post he coveted so\r\nhighly. People who had no faith in the mysteries of alchemy declared\r\nthat Sainte-Croix and Penautier did business together.\r\n\r\nNow, when the period for mourning was over, the relations of the\r\nmarquise and Sainte-Croix were as open and public as before: the two\r\nbrothers d’Aubray expostulated with her by the medium of an older sister\r\nwho was in a Carmelite nunnery, and the marquise perceived that her\r\nfather had on his death bequeathed the care and supervision of her to\r\nher brothers. Thus her first crime had been all but in vain: she had\r\nwanted to get rid of her father’s rebukes and to gain his fortune; as a\r\nfact the fortune was diminished by reason of her elder brothers, and she\r\nhad scarcely enough to pay her debts; while the rebukes were renewed\r\nfrom the mouths of her brothers, one of whom, being civil lieutenant,\r\nhad the power to separate her again from her lover. This must be\r\nprevented. Lachaussee left the service of Sainte-Croix, and by a\r\ncontrivance of the marquise was installed three months later as servant\r\nof the elder brother, who lived with the civil lieutenant. The poison to\r\nbe used on this occasion was not so swift as the one taken by M.\r\nd’Aubray so violent a death happening so soon in the same family might\r\narouse suspicion. Experiments were tried once more, not on animals—for\r\ntheir different organisation might put the poisoner’s science in the\r\nwrong—but as before upon human subjects; as before, a ’corpus vili’ was\r\ntaken. The marquise had the reputation of a pious and charitable lady;\r\nseldom did she fail to relieve the poor who appealed: more than this,\r\nshe took part in the work of those devoted women who are pledged to the\r\nservice of the sick, and she walked the hospitals and presented wine and\r\nother medicaments. No one was surprised when she appeared in her\r\nordinary way at l’Hotel-Dieu. This time she brought biscuits and cakes\r\nfor the convalescent patients, her gifts being, as usual, gratefully\r\nreceived. A month later she paid another visit, and inquired after\r\ncertain patients in whom she was particularly interested: since the last\r\ntime she came they had suffered a relapse—the malady had changed in\r\nnature, and had shown graver symptoms. It was a kind of deadly fatigue,\r\nkilling them by a slows strange decay. She asked questions of the\r\ndoctors but could learn nothing: this malady was unknown to them, and\r\ndefied all the resources of their art. A fortnight later she returned.\r\nSome of the sick people were dead, others still alive, but desperately\r\nill; living skeletons, all that seemed left of them was sight, speech,\r\nand breath. At the end of two months they were all dead, and the\r\nphysicians had been as much at a loss over the post-mortems as over the\r\ntreatment of the dying.\r\n\r\nExperiments of this kind were reassuring; so Lachaussee had orders to\r\ncarry out his instructions. One day the civil lieutenant rang his bell,\r\nand Lachaussee, who served the councillor, as we said before, came up\r\nfor orders. He found the lieutenant at work with his secretary, Couste.\r\nWhat he wanted was a glass of wine and water. In a moment Lachaussee\r\nbrought it in. The lieutenant put the glass to his lips, but at the\r\nfirst sip pushed it away, crying, \"What have you brought, you wretch? I\r\nbelieve you want to poison me.\" Then handing the glass to his secretary,\r\nhe added, \"Look at it, Couste: what is this stuff?\" The secretary put a\r\nfew drops into a coffee-spoon, lifting it to his nose and then to his\r\nmouth: the drink had the smell and taste of vitriol. Meanwhile\r\nLachaussee went up to the secretary and told him he knew what it must\r\nbe: one of the councillor’s valets had taken a dose of medicine that\r\nmorning, and without noticing he must have brought the very glass his\r\ncompanion had used. Saying this, he took the glass from the secretary’s\r\nhand, put it to his lips, pretending to taste it himself, and then said\r\nhe had no doubt it was so, for he recognised the smell. He then threw\r\nthe wine into the fireplace.\r\n\r\nAs the lieutenant had not drunk enough to be upset by it, he soon forgot\r\nthis incident and the suspicions that had been aroused at the moment in\r\nhis mind. Sainte-Croix and the marquise perceived that they had made a\r\nfalse step, and at the risk of involving several people in their plan\r\nfor vengeance, they decided on the employment of other means. Three\r\nmonths passed without any favourable occasion presenting itself; at\r\nlast, on one of the early days of April 1670, the lieutenant took his\r\nbrother to his country place, Villequoy, in Beauce, to spend the Easter\r\nvacation. Lachaussee was with his master, and received his instructions\r\nat the moment of departure.\r\n\r\nThe day after they arrived in the country there was a pigeon-pie for\r\ndinner: seven persons who had eaten it felt indisposed after the meal,\r\nand the three who had not taken it were perfectly well. Those on whom\r\nthe poisonous substance had chiefly acted were the lieutenant, the\r\ncouncillor, and the commandant of the watch. He may have eaten more, or\r\npossibly the poison he had tasted on the former occasion helped, but at\r\nany rate the lieutenant was the first to be attacked with vomiting two\r\nhours later, the councillor showed the same symptoms; the commandant and\r\nthe others were a prey for several hours to frightful internal pains;\r\nbut from the beginning their condition was not nearly so grave as that\r\nof the two brothers. This time again, as usual, the help of doctors was\r\nuseless. On the 12th of April, five days after they had been poisoned,\r\nthe lieutenant and his brother returned to Paris so changed that anyone\r\nwould have thought they had both suffered a long and cruel illness.\r\nMadame de Brinvilliers was in the country at the time, and did not come\r\nback during the whole time that her brothers were ill. From the very\r\nfirst consultation in the lieutenant’s case the doctors entertained no\r\nhope. The symptoms were the same as those to which his father had\r\nsuccumbed, and they supposed it was an unknown disease in the family.\r\nThey gave up all hope of recovery. Indeed, his state grew worse and\r\nworse; he felt an unconquerable aversion for every kind of food, and the\r\nvomiting was incessant. The last three days of his life he complained\r\nthat a fire was burning in his breast, and the flames that burned within\r\nseemed to blaze forth at his eyes, the only part of his body that\r\nappeared to live, so like a corpse was all the rest of him. On the 17th\r\nof June 1670 he died: the poison had taken seventy-two days to complete\r\nits work. Suspicion began to dawn: the lieutenant’s body was opened, and\r\na formal report was drawn up. The operation was performed in the\r\npresence of the surgeons Dupre and Durant, and Gavart, the apothecary,\r\nby M. Bachot, the brothers’ private physician. They found the stomach\r\nand duodenum to be black and falling to pieces, the liver burnt and\r\ngangrened. They said that this state of things must have been produced\r\nby poison, but as the presence of certain bodily humours sometimes\r\nproduces similar appearances, they durst not declare that the\r\nlieutenant’s death could not have come about by natural causes, and he\r\nwas buried without further inquiry.\r\n\r\nIt was as his private physician that Dr. Bachot had asked for the\r\nautopsy of his patient’s brother. For the younger brother seemed to have\r\nbeen attacked by the same complaint, and the doctor hoped to find from\r\nthe death of the one some means for preserving the life of the other.\r\nThe councillor was in a violent fever, agitated unceasingly both in body\r\nand mind: he could not bear any position of any kind for more than a few\r\nminutes at a time. Bed was a place of torture; but if he got up, he\r\ncried for it again, at least for a change of suffering. At the end of\r\nthree months he died. His stomach, duodenum, and liver were all in the\r\nsame corrupt state as his brother’s, and more than that, the surface of\r\nhis body was burnt away. This, said the doctors; was no dubious sign of\r\npoisoning; although, they added, it sometimes happened that a\r\n’cacochyme’ produced the same effect. Lachaussee was so far from being\r\nsuspected, that the councillor, in recognition of the care he had\r\nbestowed on him in his last illness, left him in his will a legacy of a\r\nhundred crowns; moreover, he received a thousand francs from\r\nSainte-Croix and the marquise.\r\n\r\nSo great a disaster in one family, however, was not only sad but\r\nalarming. Death knows no hatred: death is deaf and blind, nothing more,\r\nand astonishment was felt at this ruthless destruction of all who bore\r\none name. Still nobody suspected the true culprits, search was\r\nfruitless, inquiries led nowhere: the marquise put on mourning for her\r\nbrothers, Sainte-Croix continued in his path of folly, and all things\r\nwent on as before. Meanwhile Sainte-Croix had made the acquaintance of\r\nthe Sieur de Saint Laurent, the same man from whom Penautier had asked\r\nfor a post without success, and had made friends with him. Penautier had\r\nmeanwhile become the heir of his father-in-law, the Sieur Lesecq, whose\r\ndeath had most unexpectedly occurred; he had thereby gained a second\r\npost in Languedoc and an immense property: still, he coveted the place\r\nof receiver of the clergy. Chance now once more helped him: a few days\r\nafter taking over from Sainte-Croix a man-servant named George, M. de\r\nSaint-Laurent fell sick, and his illness showed symptoms similar to\r\nthose observed in the case of the d’Aubrays, father and sons; but it was\r\nmore rapid, lasting only twenty-four hours. Like them, M. de\r\nSaint-Laurent died a prey to frightful tortures. The same day an officer\r\nfrom the sovereign’s court came to see him, heard every detail connected\r\nwith his friend’s death, and when told of the symptoms said before the\r\nservants to Sainfray the notary that it would be necessary to examine\r\nthe body. An hour later George disappeared, saying nothing to anybody,\r\nand not even asking for his wages. Suspicions were excited; but again\r\nthey remained vague. The autopsy showed a state of things not precisely\r\nto be called peculiar to poisoning cases the intestines, which the fatal\r\npoison had not had time to burn as in the case of the d’Aubrays, were\r\nmarked with reddish spots like flea-bites. In June Penautier obtained\r\nthe post that had been held by the Sieur de Saint-Laurent.\r\n\r\nBut the widow had certain suspicions which were changed into something\r\nlike certainty by George’s flight. A particular circumstance aided and\r\nalmost confirmed her doubts. An abbe who was a friend of her husband,\r\nand knew all about the disappearance of George, met him some days\r\nafterwards in the rue des Masons, near the Sorbonne. They were both on\r\nthe same side, and a hay-cart coming along the street was causing a\r\nblock. George raised his head and saw the abbe, knew him as a friend of\r\nhis late master, stooped under the cart and crawled to the other side,\r\nthus at the risk of being crushed escaping from the eyes of a man whose\r\nappearance recalled his crime and inspired him with fear of punishment.\r\nMadame de Saint-Laurent preferred a charge against George, but though he\r\nwas sought for everywhere, he could never be found. Still the report of\r\nthese strange deaths, so sudden and so incomprehensible, was bruited\r\nabout Paris, and people began to feel frightened. Sainte-Croix, always\r\nin the gay world, encountered the talk in drawing-rooms, and began to\r\nfeel a little uneasy. True, no suspicion pointed as yet in his\r\ndirection; but it was as well to take precautions, and Sainte-Croix\r\nbegan to consider how he could be freed from anxiety. There was a post\r\nin the king’s service soon to be vacant, which would cost 100,000\r\ncrowns; and although Sainte-Croix had no apparent means, it was rumoured\r\nthat he was about to purchase it. He first addressed himself to\r\nBelleguise to treat about this affair with Penautier. There was some\r\ndifficulty, however, to be encountered in this quarter. The sum was a\r\nlarge one, and Penautier no longer required help; he had already come\r\ninto all the inheritance he looked for, and so he tried to throw cold\r\nwater on the project.\r\n\r\nSainte-Croix thus wrote to Belleguise:\r\n\r\n\"DEAR FRIEND,—Is it possible that you need any more talking to about the\r\nmatter you know of, so important as it is, and, maybe, able to give us\r\npeace and quiet for the rest of our days! I really think the devil must\r\nbe in it, or else you simply will not be sensible: do show your common\r\nsense, my good man, and look at it from all points of view; take it at\r\nits very worst, and you still ought to feel bound to serve me, seeing\r\nhow I have made everything all right for you: all our interests are\r\ntogether in this matter. Do help me, I beg of you; you may feel sure I\r\nshall be deeply grateful, and you will never before have acted so\r\nagreeably both for me and for yourself. You know quite enough about it,\r\nfor I have not spoken so openly even to my own brother as I have to you.\r\nIf you can come this afternoon, I shall be either at the house or quite\r\nnear at hand, you know where I mean, or I will expect you tomorrow\r\nmorning, or I will come and find you, according to what you\r\nreply.—Always yours with all my heart.\"\r\n\r\nThe house meant by Sainte-Croix was in the rue des Bernardins, and the\r\nplace near at hand where he was to wait for Belleguise was the room he\r\nleased from the widow Brunet, in the blind alley out of the Place\r\nMaubert. It was in this room and at the apothecary Glazer’s that\r\nSainte-Croix made his experiments; but in accordance with poetical\r\njustice, the manipulation of the poisons proved fatal to the workers\r\nthemselves. The apothecary fell ill and died; Martin was attacked by\r\nfearful sickness, which brought, him to death’s door. Sainte-Croix was\r\nunwell, and could not even go out, though he did not know what was the\r\nmatter. He had a furnace brought round to his house from Glazer’s, and\r\nill as he was, went on with the experiments. Sainte-Croix was then\r\nseeking to make a poison so subtle that the very effluvia might be\r\nfatal. He had heard of the poisoned napkin given to the young dauphin,\r\nelder brother of Charles VII, to wipe his hands on during a game of\r\ntennis, and knew that the contact had caused his death; and the still\r\ndiscussed tradition had informed him of the gloves of Jeanne d’Albret;\r\nthe secret was lost, but Sainte-Croix hoped to recover it. And then\r\nthere happened one of those strange accidents which seem to be not the\r\nhand of chance but a punishment from Heaven. At the very moment when\r\nSainte-Croix was bending over his furnace, watching the fatal\r\npreparation as it became hotter and hotter, the glass mask which he wore\r\nover his face as a protection from any poisonous exhalations that might\r\nrise up from the mixture, suddenly dropped off, and Sainte-Croix dropped\r\nto the ground as though felled by a lightning stroke. At supper-time,\r\nhis wife finding that he did not come out from his closet where he was\r\nshut in, knocked at the door, and received no answer; knowing that her\r\nhusband was wont to busy himself with dark and mysterious matters, she\r\nfeared some disaster had occurred. She called her servants, who broke in\r\nthe door. Then she found Sainte-Croix stretched out beside the furnace,\r\nthe broken glass lying by his side. It was impossible to deceive the\r\npublic as to the circumstances of this strange and sudden death: the\r\nservants had seen the corpse, and they talked. The commissary Picard was\r\nordered to affix the seals, and all the widow could do was to remove the\r\nfurnace and the fragments of the glass mask.\r\n\r\nThe noise of the event soon spread all over Paris. Sainte-Croix was\r\nextremely well known, and the, news that he was about to purchase a post\r\nin the court had made him known even more widely. Lachaussee was one of\r\nthe first to learn of his master’s death; and hearing that a seal had\r\nbeen set upon his room, he hastened to put in an objection in these\r\nterms:\r\n\r\n\"Objection of Lachaussee, who asserts that for seven years he was in the\r\nservice of the deceased; that he had given into his charge, two years\r\nearlier, 100 pistoles and 200 white crowns, which should be found in a\r\ncloth bag under the closet window, and in the same a paper stating that\r\nthe said sum belonged to him, together with the transfer of 300 livres\r\nowed to him by the late M. d’Aubray, councillor; the said transfer made\r\nby him at Laserre, together with three receipts from his master of\r\napprenticeship, 100 livres each: these moneys and papers he claims.\"\r\n\r\nTo Lachaussee the reply was given that he must wait till the day when\r\nthe seals were broken, and then if all was as he said, his property\r\nwould be returned.\r\n\r\nBut Lachaussee was not the only person who was agitated about the death\r\nof Sainte-Croix. The, marquise, who was familiar with all the secrets of\r\nthis fatal closet, had hurried to the commissary as soon as she\r\nheard of the event, and although it was ten o’clock at night had\r\ndemanded to speak with him. But he had replied by his head clerk, Pierre\r\nFrater, that he was in bed; the marquise insisted, begging them to rouse\r\nhim up, for she wanted a box that she could not allow to have opened.\r\nThe clerk then went up to the Sieur Picard’s bedroom, but came back\r\nsaying that what the marquise demanded was for the time being an\r\nimpossibility, for the commissary was asleep. She saw that it was idle\r\nto insist, and went away, saying that she should send a man the next\r\nmorning to fetch the box. In the morning the man came, offering fifty\r\nLouis to the commissary on behalf of the marquise, if he would give her\r\nthe box. But he replied that the box was in the sealed room, that it\r\nwould have to be opened, and that if the objects claimed by the marquise\r\nwere really hers, they would be safely handed over to her. This reply\r\nstruck the marquise like a thunderbolt. There was no time to be lost:\r\nhastily she removed from the rue Neuve-Saint-Paul, where her town house\r\nwas, to Picpus, her country place. Thence she posted the same evening to\r\nLiege, arriving the next morning, and retired to a convent.\r\n\r\nThe seals had been set on the 31st of July 1672, and they were taken off\r\non the 8th of August following. Just as they set to work a lawyer\r\ncharged with full powers of acting for the marquise, appeared and put in\r\nthe following statement: \"Alexandre Delamarre, lawyer acting for the\r\nMarquise de Brinvilliers, has come forward, and declares that if in the\r\nbox claimed by his client there is found a promise signed by her for the\r\nsum of 30,000 livres, it is a paper taken from her by fraud, against\r\nwhich, in case of her signature being verified, she intends to lodge an\r\nappeal for nullification.\" This formality over, they proceeded to open\r\nSainte-Croix’s closet: the key was handed to the commissary Picard by a\r\nCarmelite called Friar Victorin. The commissary opened the door, and\r\nentered with the parties interested, the officers, and the widow, and\r\nthey began by setting aside the loose papers, with a view to taking them\r\nin order, one at a time. While they were thus busy, a small roll fell\r\ndown, on which these two words were written: \"My Confession.\" All\r\npresent, having no reason to suppose Sainte-Croix a bad man, decided\r\nthat this paper ought not to be read. The deputy for the attorney\r\ngeneral on being consulted was of this opinion, and the confession of\r\nSainte-Croix was burnt. This act of conscience performed, they proceeded\r\nto make an inventory. One of the first objects that attracted the\r\nattention of the officers was the box claimed by Madame de Brinvilliers.\r\nHer insistence had provoked curiosity, so they began with it. Everybody\r\nwent near to see what was in it, and it was opened.\r\n\r\nWe shall let the report speak: in such cases nothing is so effective or\r\nso terrible as the official statement.\r\n\r\n\"In the closet of Sainte-Croix was found a small box one foot square, on\r\nthe top of which lay a half-sheet of paper entitled ’My Will,’ written\r\non one side and containing these words: ’I humbly entreat any into whose\r\nhands this chest may fall to do me the kindness of putting it into the\r\nhands of Madame the Marquise de Brinvilliers, resident in the rue\r\nNeuve-Saint-Paul, seeing that all the contents concern and belong to her\r\nalone, and are of no use to any person in the world apart from herself:\r\nin case of her being already dead before me, the box and all its\r\ncontents should be burnt without opening or disturbing anything. And\r\nlest anyone should plead ignorance of the contents, I swear by the God I\r\nworship and by all that is most sacred that no untruth is here asserted.\r\nIf anyone should contravene my wishes that are just and reasonable in\r\nthis matter, I charge their conscience therewith in discharging my own\r\nin this world and the next, protesting that such is my last wish.\r\n\r\n\"’Given at Paris, the 25th of May after noon, 1672. Signed by\r\nSainte-Croix,’\r\n\r\n\"And below were written these words: ’There is one packet only addressed\r\nto M. Penautier which should be delivered.’\"\r\n\r\nIt may be easily understood that a disclosure of this kind only\r\nincreased the interest of the scene; there was a murmur of curiosity,\r\nand when silence again reigned, the official continued in these words:\r\n\r\n\"A packet has been found sealed in eight different places with eight\r\ndifferent seals. On this is written: ’Papers to be burnt in case of my\r\ndeath, of no consequence to anyone. I humbly beg those into whose hands\r\nthey may fall to burn them. I give this as a charge upon their\r\nconscience; all without opening the packet.’ In this packet we find two\r\nparcels of sublimate.\r\n\r\n\"Item, another packet sealed with six different seals, on which is a\r\nsimilar inscription, in which is found more sublimate, half a pound in\r\nweight.\r\n\r\n\"Item, another packet sealed with six different seals, on which is a\r\nsimilar inscription, in which are found three parcels, one containing\r\nhalf an ounce of sublimate, the second 2 1/4 ozs. of Roman vitriol, and\r\nthe third some calcined prepared vitriol. In the box was found a large\r\nsquare phial, one pint in capacity, full of a clear liquid, which was\r\nlooked at by M. Moreau, the doctor; he, however, could not tell its\r\nnature until it was tested.\r\n\r\n\"Item, another phial, with half a pint of clear liquid with a white\r\nsediment, about which Moreau said the same thing as before.\r\n\r\n\"Item, a small earthenware pot containing two or three lumps of prepared\r\nopium.\r\n\r\n\"Item, a folded paper containing two drachms of corrosive sublimate\r\npowdered.\r\n\r\n\"Next, a little box containing a sort of stone known as infernal stone.\r\n\r\n\"Next, a paper containing one ounce of opium.\r\n\r\n\"Next, a piece of pure antimony weighing three ounces.\r\n\r\n\"Next, a packet of powder on which was written: ’To check the flow of\r\nblood.’ Moreau said that it was quince flower and quince buds dried.\r\n\r\n\"Item, a pack sealed with six seals, on which was written, ’Papers to be\r\nburnt in case of death.’ In this twenty-four letters were found, said to\r\nhave been written by the Marquise de Brinvilliers.\r\n\r\n\"Item, another packet sealed with six seals, on which a similar\r\ninscription was written. In this were twenty-seven pieces of paper on\r\neach of which was written: ’Sundry curious secrets.’\r\n\r\n\"Item, another packet with six more seals, on which a similar\r\ninscription was written. In this were found seventy-five livres,\r\naddressed to different persons. Besides all these, in the box there were\r\ntwo bonds, one from the marquise for 30,000, and one from Penautier for\r\n10,000 francs, their dates corresponding to the time of the deaths of M.\r\nd’Aubray and the Sieur de St. Laurent.\"\r\n\r\nThe difference in the amount shows that Sainte-Croix had a tariff, and\r\nthat parricide was more expensive than simple assassination. Thus in his\r\ndeath did Sainte-Croix bequeath the poisons to his mistress and his\r\nfriend; not content with his own crimes in the past, he wished to be\r\ntheir accomplice in the future.\r\n\r\nThe first business of the officials was to submit the different\r\nsubstances to analysis, and to experiment with them on animals. The\r\nreport follows of Guy Simon, an apothecary, who was charged to undertake\r\nthe analysis and the experiments:\r\n\r\n\"This artificial poison reveals its nature on examination. It is so\r\ndisguised that one fails to recognise it, so subtle that it deceives the\r\nscientific, so elusive that it escapes the doctor’s eye: experiments\r\nseem to be at fault with this poison, rules useless, aphorisms\r\nridiculous. The surest experiments are made by the use of the elements\r\nor upon animals. In water, ordinary poison falls by its own weight. The\r\nwater is superior, the poison obeys, falls downwards, and takes the\r\nlower place.\r\n\r\n\"The trial by fire is no less certain: the fire evaporates and disperses\r\nall that is innocent and pure, leaving only acrid and sour matter which\r\nresists its influence. The effect produced by poisons on animals is\r\nstill more plain to see: its malignity extends to every part that it\r\nreaches, and all that it touches is vitiated; it burns and scorches all\r\nthe inner parts with a strange, irresistible fire.\r\n\r\n\"The poison employed by Sainte-Croix has been tried in all the ways, and\r\ncan defy every experiment. This poison floats in water, it is the\r\nsuperior, and the water obeys it; it escapes in the trial by fire,\r\nleaving behind only innocent deposits; in animals it is so skilfully\r\nconcealed that no one could detect it; all parts of the animal remain\r\nhealthy and active; even while it is spreading the cause of death, this\r\nartificial poison leaves behind the marks and appearance of life. Every\r\nsort of experiment has been tried. The first was to pour out several\r\ndrops of the liquid found into oil of tartar and sea water, and nothing\r\nwas precipitated into the vessels used; the second was to pour the same\r\nliquid into a sanded vessel, and at the bottom there was found nothing\r\nacrid or acid to the tongue, scarcely any stains; the third experiment\r\nwas tried upon an Indian fowl, a pigeon, a dog, and some other animals,\r\nwhich died soon after. When they were opened, however, nothing was found\r\nbut a little coagulated blood in the ventricle of the heart. Another\r\nexperiment was giving a white powder to a cat, in a morsel of mutton.\r\nThe cat vomited for half an hour, and was found dead the next day, but\r\nwhen opened no part of it was found to be affected by the poison. A\r\nsecond trial of the same poison was made upon a pigeon, which soon died.\r\nWhen opened, nothing peculiar was found except a little reddish water in\r\nthe stomach.\"\r\n\r\nThese experiments proved that Sainte-Croix was a learned chemist, and\r\nsuggested the idea that he did not employ his art for nothing; everybody\r\nrecalled the sudden, unexpected deaths that had occurred, and the bonds\r\nfrom the marquise and from Penautier looked like blood-money. As one of\r\nthese two was absent, and the other so powerful and rich that they dared\r\nnot arrest him without proofs, attention was now paid to the objection\r\nput in by Lachaussee.\r\n\r\nIt was said in the objection that Lachaussee had spent seven years in\r\nthe service of Sainte-Croix, so he could not have considered the time he\r\nhad passed with the d’Aubrays as an interruption to this service. The\r\nbag containing the thousand pistoles and the three bonds for a hundred\r\nlivres had been found in the place indicated; thus Lachaussee had a\r\nthorough knowledge of this closet: if he knew the closet, he would know\r\nabout the box; if he knew about the box, he could not be an innocent\r\nman. This was enough to induce Madame Mangot de Villarceaux, the\r\nlieutenant’s widow, to lodge an accusation against him, and in\r\nconsequence a writ was issued against Lachaussee, and he was arrested.\r\n\r\nWhen this happened, poison was found upon him. The trial came on before\r\nthe Chatelet. Lachaussee denied his guilt obstinately. The judges\r\nthinking they had no sufficient proof, ordered the preparatory question\r\nto be applied. Mme. Mangot appealed from a judgment which would probably\r\nsave the culprit if he had the strength to resist the torture and own to\r\nnothing;\r\n\r\n[Note: There were two kinds of question, one before and one after the\r\nsentence was passed. In the first, an accused person would endure\r\nfrightful torture in the hope of saving his life, and so would often\r\nconfess nothing. In the second, there was no hope, and therefore it was\r\nnot worth while to suffer additional pains.]\r\n\r\nso, in virtue of this appeal, a judgment, on March 4th, 1673, declared\r\nthat Jean Amelin Lachaussee was convicted of having poisoned the\r\nlieutenant and the councillor; for which he was to be broken alive on\r\nthe wheel, having been first subjected to the question both ordinary and\r\nextraordinary, with a view to the discovery of his accomplices. At the\r\nsame time Madame de Brinvilliers was condemned in default of appearance\r\nto have her head cut off.\r\n\r\nLachaussee suffered the torture of the boot. This was having each leg\r\nfastened between two planks and drawn together in an iron ring, after\r\nwhich wedges were driven in between the middle planks; the ordinary\r\nquestion was with four wedges, the extraordinary with eight. At the\r\nthird wedge Lachaussee said he was ready to speak; so the question was\r\nstopped, and he was carried into the choir of the chapel stretched on a\r\nmattress, where, in a weak voice—for he could hardly speak—he begged for\r\nhalf an hour to recover himself. We give a verbatim extract from the\r\nreport of the question and the execution of the death-sentence:\r\n\r\n\"Lachaussee, released from the question and laid on the mattress, the\r\nofficial reporter retired. Half an hour later Lachaussee begged that he\r\nmight return, and said that he was guilty; that Sainte-Croix told him\r\nthat Madame de Brinvilliers had given him the poison to administer to\r\nher brothers; that he had done it in water and soup, had put the reddish\r\nwater in the lieutenant’s glass in Paris, and the clear water in the pie\r\nat Villequoy; that Sainte-Croix had promised to keep him always, and to\r\nmake him a gift of 100 pistolets; that he gave him an account of the\r\neffect of the poisons, and that Sainte-Croix had given him some of the\r\nwaters several times. Sainte-Croix told him that the marquise knew\r\nnothing of his other poisonings, but Lachaussee thought she did know,\r\nbecause she had often spoken to him about his poisons; that she wanted\r\nto compel him to go away, offering him money if he would go; that she\r\nhad asked him for the box and its contents; that if Sainte-Croix had\r\nbeen able to put anyone into the service of Madame d’Aubray, the\r\nlieutenant’s widow, he would possibly have had her poisoned also; for he\r\nhad a fancy for her daughter.\"\r\n\r\nThis declaration, which left no room for doubt, led to the judgment that\r\ncame next, thus described in the Parliamentary register: \"Report of the\r\nquestion and execution on the 24th of March 1673, containing the\r\ndeclarations and confessions of Jean Amelin Lachaussee; the court has\r\nordered that the persons mentioned, Belleguise, Martin, Poitevin,\r\nOlivier, Veron pere, the wife of Quesdon the wigmaker, be summoned to\r\nappear before the court to be interrogated and heard concerning matters\r\narising from the present inquiry, and orders that the decree of arrest\r\nagainst Lapierre and summons against Penautier decreed by the criminal\r\nlieutenant shall be carried out. In Parliament, 27th March 1673.\" In\r\nvirtue of this judgment, Penautier, Martin, and Belleguise were\r\ninterrogated on the 21st, 22nd, and 24th of April. On the 26th of July,\r\nPenautier was discharged; fuller information was desired concerning\r\nBelleguise, and the arrest of Martin was ordered. On the 24th of March,\r\nLachaussee had been broken on the wheel. As to Exili, the beginner of it\r\nall, he had disappeared like Mephistopheles after Faust’s end, and\r\nnothing was heard of him. Towards the end of the year Martin was\r\nreleased for want of sufficient evidence. But the Marquise de\r\nBrinvilliers remained at Liege, and although she was shut up in a\r\nconvent she had by no means abandoned one, at any rate, of the most\r\nworldly pleasures. She had soon found consolation for the death of\r\nSainte-Croix, whom, all the same, she had loved so much as to be willing\r\nto kill herself for his sake. But she had adopted a new lover, Theria by\r\nname. About this man it has been impossible to get any information,\r\nexcept that his name was several times mentioned during the trial. Thus,\r\nall the accusations had, one by one, fallen upon her, and it was\r\nresolved to seek her out in the retreat where she was supposed to be\r\nsafe. The mission was difficult and very delicate. Desgrais, one of the\r\ncleverest of the officials, offered to undertake it. He was a handsome\r\nman, thirty-six years old or thereabouts: nothing in his looks betrayed\r\nhis connection with the police; he wore any kind of dress with equal\r\nease and grace, and was familiar with every grade in the social scale,\r\ndisguising himself as a wretched tramp or a noble lord. He was just the\r\nright man, so his offer was accepted.\r\n\r\nHe started accordingly for Liege, escorted by several archers, and,\r\nfortified by a letter from the king addressed to the Sixty of that town,\r\nwherein Louis xiv demanded the guilty woman to be given up for\r\npunishment. After examining the letter, which Desgrais had taken pains\r\nto procure, the council authorised the extradition of the marquise.\r\n\r\nThis was much, but it was not all. The marquise, as we know, had taken\r\nrefuge in a convent, where Desgrais dared not arrest her by force, for\r\ntwo reasons: first, because she might get information beforehand, and\r\nhide herself in one of the cloister retreats whose secret is known only\r\nto the superior; secondly, because Liege was so religious a town that\r\nthe event would produce a great sensation: the act might be looked upon\r\nas a sacrilege, and might bring about a popular rising, during which the\r\nmarquise might possibly contrive to escape. So Desgrais paid a visit to\r\nhis wardrobe, and feeling that an abbe’s dress would best free him from\r\nsuspicion, he appeared at the doors of the convent in the guise of a\r\nfellow-countryman just returned from Rome, unwilling to pass through\r\nLiege without presenting his compliments to the lovely and unfortunate\r\nmarquise. Desgrais had just the manner of the younger son of a great\r\nhouse: he was as flattering as a courtier, as enterprising as a\r\nmusketeer. In this first visit he made himself attractive by his wit and\r\nhis audacity, so much so that more easily than he had dared to hope, he\r\ngot leave to pay a second call. The second visit was not long delayed:\r\nDesgrais presented himself the very next day. Such eagerness was\r\nflattering to the marquise, so Desgrais was received even better than\r\nthe night before. She, a woman of rank and fashion, for more than a year\r\nhad been robbed of all intercourse with people of a certain set, so with\r\nDesgrais the marquise resumed her Parisian manner. Unhappily the\r\ncharming abbe was to leave Liege in a few days; and on that account he\r\nbecame all the more pressing, and a third visit, to take place next day,\r\nwas formally arranged. Desgrais was punctual: the marquise was\r\nimpatiently waiting him; but by a conjunction of circumstances that\r\nDesgrais had no doubt arranged beforehand, the amorous meeting was\r\ndisturbed two or three times just as they were getting more intimate and\r\nleast wanting to be observed. Desgrais complained of these tiresome\r\nchecks; besides, the marquise and he too would be compromised: he owed\r\nconcealment to his cloth: He begged her to grant him a rendezvous\r\noutside the town, in some deserted walk, where there would be no fear of\r\ntheir being recognised or followed: the marquise hesitated no longer\r\nthan would serve to put a price on the favour she was granting, and the\r\nrendezvous was fixed for the same evening.\r\n\r\nThe evening came: both waited with the same impatience, but with very\r\ndifferent hopes. The marquise found Desgrais at the appointed spot: he\r\ngave her his arm then holding her hand in his own, he gave a sign, the\r\narchers appeared, the lover threw off his mask, Desgrais was confessed,\r\nand the marquise was his prisoner. Desgrais left her in the hands of his\r\nmen, and hastily made his way to the convent. Then, and not before, he\r\nproduced his order from the Sixty, by means of which he opened the\r\nmarquise’s room. Under her bed he found a box, which he seized and\r\nsealed; then he went back to her, and gave the order to start.\r\n\r\nWhen the marquise saw the box in the hands of Desgrais, she at first\r\nappeared stunned; quickly recovering, she claimed a paper inside it\r\nwhich contained her confession. Desgrais refused, and as he turned round\r\nfor the carriage to come forward, she tried to choke herself by\r\nswallowing a pin. One of the archers, called Claude, Rolla, perceiving\r\nher intention, contrived to get the pin out of her mouth. After this,\r\nDesgrais commanded that she should be doubly watched.\r\n\r\nThey stopped for supper. An archer called Antoine Barbier was present at\r\nthe meal, and watched so that no knife or fork should be put on the\r\ntable, or any instrument with which she could wound or kill herself. The\r\nmarquise, as she put her glass to her mouth as though to drink, broke a\r\nlittle bit off with her teeth; but the archer saw it in time, and forced\r\nher to put it out on her plate. Then she promised him, if he would save\r\nher, that she would make his fortune. He asked what he would have to do\r\nfor that. She proposed that he should cut Desgrais’ throat; but he\r\nrefused, saying that he was at her service in any other way. So she\r\nasked him for pen and paper, and wrote this letter:\r\n\r\n\"DEAR THERIA,—I am in the hands of Desgrais, who is taking me by road\r\nfrom Liege to Paris. Come quickly and save me.\"\r\n\r\nAntoine Barbier took the letter, promising to deliver it at the right\r\naddress; but he gave it to Desgrais instead. The next day, finding that\r\nthis letter had not been pressing enough, she wrote him another, saying\r\nthat the escort was only eight men, who could be easily overcome by four\r\nor five determined assailants, and she counted on him to strike this\r\nbold stroke. But, uneasy when she got no answer and no result from her\r\nletters, she despatched a third missive to Theria. In this she implored\r\nhim by his own salvation, if he were not strong enough to attack her\r\nescort and save her, at least to kill two of the four horses by which\r\nshe was conveyed, and to profit by the moment of confusion to seize the\r\nchest and throw it into the fire; otherwise, she declared, she was lost.\r\nThough Theria received none of these letters, which were one by one\r\nhanded over by Barbier to Desgrais, he all the same did go to\r\nMaestricht, where the marquise was to pass, of his own accord. There he\r\ntried to bribe the archers, offering much as 10,000 livres, but they\r\nwere incorruptible. At Rocroy the cortege met M. Palluau, the\r\ncouncillor, whom the Parliament had sent after the prisoner, that he\r\nmight put questions to her at a time when she least expected them, and\r\nso would not have prepared her answers. Desgrais told him all that had\r\npassed, and specially called his attention to the famous box, the object\r\nof so much anxiety and so many eager instructions. M. de Palluau opened\r\nit, and found among other things a paper headed \"My Confession.\" This\r\nconfession was a proof that the guilty feel great need of discovering\r\ntheir crimes either to mankind or to a merciful God. Sainte-Croix, we\r\nknow, had made a confession that was burnt, and here was the marquise\r\nequally imprudent. The confession contained seven articles, and began\r\nthus, \"I confess to God, and to you, my father,\" and was a complete\r\navowal, of all the crimes she had committed.\r\n\r\nIn the first article she accused herself of incendiarism;\r\n\r\nIn the second, of having ceased to be a virgin at seven years of age;\r\n\r\nIn the third of having poisoned her father;\r\n\r\nIn the fourth, of having poisoned her two brothers;\r\n\r\nIn the fifth, that she had tried to poison her sister, a Carmelite nun.\r\n\r\nThe two other articles were concerned with the description of strange\r\nand unnatural sins. In this woman there was something of Locusta and\r\nsomething of Messalina as well: antiquity could go no further.\r\n\r\n  M. de Palluau, fortified by his knowledge of this important document,\r\n     began his examination forthwith. We give it verbatim, rejoicing\r\n     that we may substitute an official report for our own narrative.\r\n\r\nAsked why she fled to Liege, she replied that she left France on account\r\nof some business with her sister-in-law.\r\n\r\nAsked if she had any knowledge of the papers found in the box, she\r\nreplied that in the box there were several family papers, and among them\r\na general confession which she desired to make; when she wrote it,\r\nhowever, her mind was disordered; she knew not what she had said or\r\ndone, being distraught at the time, in a foreign country, deserted by\r\nher relatives, forced to borrow every penny.\r\n\r\nAsked as to the first article, what house it was she had burnt, she\r\nreplied that she had not burnt anything, but when she wrote that she was\r\nout of her senses.\r\n\r\nAsked about the six other articles she replied that she had no\r\nrecollection of them.\r\n\r\nAsked if she had not poisoned her father and brothers, she replied that\r\nshe knew nothing at all about it.\r\n\r\nAsked if it were not Lachaussee who poisoned her brothers, she replied\r\nthat she knew nothing about it.\r\n\r\nAsked if she did not know that her sister could not live long, having\r\nbeen poisoned, she said that she expected her sister to die, because she\r\nsuffered in the same way as her brothers; that she had lost all memory\r\nof the time when she wrote this confession; admitted that she left\r\nFrance by the advice of her relations.\r\n\r\nAsked why her relations had advised her thus, she replied that it was in\r\nconnection with her brothers’ affairs; admitted seeing Sainte-Croix\r\nsince his release from the Bastille.\r\n\r\nAsked if Sainte-Croix had not persuaded her to get rid of her father,\r\nshe replied that she could not remember; neither did she remember if\r\nSainte-Croix had given her powders or other drugs, nor if Sainte-Croix\r\nhad told her he knew how to make her rich.\r\n\r\nEight letters having been produced, asked to whom she had written them,\r\nshe replied that she did not remember.\r\n\r\nAsked why she had promised to pay 30,000 livres to Sainte-Croix, she\r\nreplied that she intended to entrust this sum to his care, so that she\r\nmight make use of it when she wanted it, believing him to be her friend;\r\nshe had not wished this to be known, by reason of her creditors; that\r\nshe had an acknowledgment from Sainte-Croix, but had lost it in her\r\ntravels; that her husband knew nothing about it.\r\n\r\nAsked if the promise was made before or after the death of her brothers,\r\nshe replied that she could not remember, and it made no difference.\r\n\r\nAsked if she knew an apothecary called Glazer, she replied that she had\r\nconsulted him three times about inflammation.\r\n\r\nAsked why she wrote to Theria to get hold of the box, she replied that\r\nshe did not understand.\r\n\r\nAsked why, in writing to Theria, she had said she was lost unless he got\r\nhold of the box, she replied that she could not remember.\r\n\r\nAsked if she had seen during the journey with her father the first\r\nsymptoms of his malady, she replied that she had not noticed that her\r\nfather was ill on the journey, either going or coming back in 1666.\r\n\r\nAsked if she had not done business with Penautier, she replied that\r\nPenautier owed her 30,000 livres.\r\n\r\nAsked how this was, she replied that she and her husband had lent\r\nPenautier 10,000 crowns, that he had paid it back, and since then they\r\nhad had no dealings with him.\r\n\r\nThe marquise took refuge, we see, in a complete system of denial:\r\narrived in Paris, and confined in the Conciergerie, she did the same;\r\nbut soon other terrible charges were added, which still further\r\noverwhelmed her.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant Cluet deposed: that, observing a lackey to M. d’Aubray, the\r\ncouncillor, to be the man Lachaussee, whom he had seen in the service of\r\nSainte-Croix, he said to the marquise that if her brother knew that\r\nLachaussee had been with Sainte-Croix he would not like it, but that\r\nMadame de Brinvilliers exclaimed, \"Dear me, don’t tell my brothers; they\r\nwould give him a thrashing, no doubt, and he may just as well get his\r\nwages as any body else.\" He said nothing to the d’Aubrays, though he saw\r\nLachaussee paying daily visits to Sainte-Croix and to the marquise, who\r\nwas worrying Sainte-Croix to let her have her box, and wanted her bill\r\nfor two or three thousand pistoles. Other wise she would have had him\r\nassassinated. She often said that she was very anxious that no one\r\nshould see the contents of the box; that it was a very important matter,\r\nbut only concerned herself. After the box was opened, the witness added,\r\nhe had told the marquise, that the commissary Picard said to Lachaussee\r\nthat there were strange things in it; but the lady blushed, and changed\r\nthe subject. He asked her if she were not an accomplice. She said,\r\n\"What! I?\" but then muttered to herself: \"Lachaussee ought to be sent\r\noff to Picardy.\" The witness repeated that she had been after\r\nSainte-Croix a long time about the box, and if she had got it she would\r\nhave had his throat cut. The witness further said that when he told\r\nBriancourt that Lachaussee was taken and would doubtless confess all,\r\nBriancourt, speaking of the marquise, remarked, \"She is a lost woman.\"\r\nThat d’Aubray’s daughter had called Briancourt a rogue, but Briancourt\r\nhad replied that she little knew what obligations she was under to him;\r\nthat they had wanted to poison both her and the lieutenant’s widow, and\r\nhe alone had hindered it. He had heard from Briancourt that the marquise\r\nhad often said that there are means to get rid of people one dislikes,\r\nand they can easily be put an end to in a bowl of soup.\r\n\r\nThe girl Edme Huet, a woman of Brescia, deposed that Sainte-Croix went\r\nto see the marquise every day, and that in a box belonging to that lady\r\nshe had seen two little packets containing sublimate in powder and in\r\npaste: she recognised these, because she was an apothecary’s daughter.\r\nShe added that one day Madame de Brinvilliers, after a dinner party, in\r\na merry mood, said, showing her a little box, \"Here is vengeance on\r\none’s enemies: this box is small, but holds plenty of successsions!\"\r\nThat she gave back the box into her hands, but soon changing from her\r\nsprightly mood, she cried, \"Good heavens, what have I said? Tell\r\nnobody.\" That Lambert, clerk at the palace, told her he had brought the\r\npackets to Madame from Sainte-Croix; that Lachaussee often went to see\r\nher; and that she herself, not being paid ten pistoles which the\r\nmarquise owed her, went to complain to Sainte-Croix, threatening to tell\r\nthe lieutenant what she had seen; and accordingly the ten pistoles were\r\npaid; further, that the marquise and Sainte-Croix always kept poison\r\nabout them, to make use of, in case of being arrested.\r\n\r\nLaurent Perrette, living with Glazer, said that he had often seen a lady\r\ncall on his mistress with Sainte-Croix; that the footman told him she\r\nwas the Marquise de Brinvilliers; that he would wager his head on it\r\nthat they came to Glazer’s to make poison; that when they came they used\r\nto leave their carriage at the Foire Saint-Germain.\r\n\r\nMarie de Villeray, maid to the marquise, deposed that after the death of\r\nM. d’Aubray the councillor, Lachaussee came to see the lady and spoke\r\nwith her in private; that Briancourt said she had caused the death of a\r\nworthy men; that Briancourt every day took some electuary for fear of\r\nbeing poisoned, and it was no doubt due to this precaution that he was\r\nstill alive; but he feared he would be stabbed, because she had told him\r\nthe secret about the poisoning; that d’Aubray’s daughter had to be\r\nwarned; and that there was a similar design against the tutor of M. de\r\nBrinvillier’s children. Marie de Villeray added that two days after the\r\ndeath of the councillor, when Lachaussee was in Madame’s bedroom,\r\nCouste, the late lieutenant’s secretary, was announced, and Lachaussee\r\nhad to be hidden in the alcove by the bed. Lachaussee brought the\r\nmarquise a letter from Sainte-Croix.\r\n\r\nFrancois Desgrais, officer, deposed that when he was given the king’s\r\norders he arrested the marquise at Liege; that he found under her bed a\r\nbox which he sealed; that the lady had demanded a paper which was in it,\r\ncontaining her confession, but he refused it; that on the road to Paris\r\nthe marquise had told him that she believed it was Glazer who made the\r\npoisons for Sainte-Croix; that Sainte-Croix, who had made a rendezvous\r\nwith her one day at the cross Saint-Honore, there showed her four little\r\nbottles, saying, \"See what Glazer has sent me.\" She asked him for one,\r\nbut Sainte-Croix said he would rather die than give it up. He added that\r\nthe archer Antoine Barbier had given him three letters written by the\r\nmarquise to Theria; that in the first she had told him to come at once\r\nand snatch her from the hands of the soldiers; that in the second she\r\nsaid that the escort was only composed of eight persons, who could he\r\nworsted by five men; that in the third she said that if he could not\r\nsave her from the men who were taking her away, he should at least\r\napproach the commissary, and killing his valet’s horse and two other\r\nhorses in his carriage, then take the box, and burn it; otherwise she\r\nwas lost.\r\n\r\nLaviolette, an archer, deposed that on the evening of the arrest, the\r\nmarquise had a long pin and tried to put it in her mouth; that he\r\nstopped her, and told her that she was very wicked; that he perceived\r\nthat people said the truth and that she had poisoned all her family; to\r\nwhich she replied, that if she had, it was only through following bad\r\nadvice, and that one could not always be good.\r\n\r\nAntoine Barbier, an archer, said that the marquise at table took up a\r\nglass as though to drink, and tried to swallow a piece of it; that he\r\nprevented this, and she promised to make his fortune if only he would\r\nsave her; that she wrote several letters to Theria; that during the\r\nwhole journey she tried all she could to swallow pins, bits of glass,\r\nand earth; that she had proposed that he should cut Desgrais’ throat,\r\nand kill the commissary’s valet; that she had bidden him get the box and\r\nburn it, and bring a lighted torch to burn everything; that she had\r\nwritten to Penautier from the Conciergerie; that she gave him, the\r\nletter, and he pretended to deliver it.\r\n\r\nFinally, Francoise Roussel deposed that she had been in the service of\r\nthe marquise, and the lady had one day given her some preserved\r\ngooseberries; that she had eaten some on the point of her knife, and at\r\nonce felt ill. She also gave her a slice of mutton, rather wet, which\r\nshe ate, afterwards suffering great pain in the stomach, feeling as\r\nthough she had been pricked in the heart, and for three years had felt\r\nthe same, believing herself poisoned.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to continue a system of absolute denial in face of\r\nproofs like these. The marquise persisted, all the same, that she was in\r\nno way guilty; and Maitre Nivelle, one of the best lawyers of the\r\nperiod, consented to defend her cause.\r\n\r\nHe combated one charge after another, in a remarkably clever way, owning\r\nto the adulterous connection of the marquise with Sainte-Croix, but\r\ndenying her participation in the murders of the d’Aubrays, father and\r\nsons: these he ascribed entirely to the vengeance desired by\r\nSainte-Croix. As to the confession, the strongest and, he maintained,\r\nthe only evidence against Madame de Brinvilliers, he attacked its\r\nvalidity by bringing forward certain similar cases, where the evidence\r\nsupplied by the accused against themselves had not been admitted by\r\nreason of the legal action: ’Non auditur perire volens’. He cited three\r\ninstances, and as they are themselves interesting, we copy them verbatim\r\nfrom his notes.\r\n\r\nFIRST CASE\r\n\r\nDominicus Soto, a very famous canonist and theologian, confessor to\r\nCharles V, present at the first meetings of the Council of Trent under\r\nPaul III, propounds a question about a man who had lost a paper on which\r\nhe had written down his sins. It happened that this paper fell into the\r\nhands of an ecclesiastical judge, who wished to put in information\r\nagainst the writer on the strength of this document. Now this judge was\r\njustly punished by his superior, because confession is so sacred that\r\neven that which is destined to constitute the confession should be\r\nwrapped in eternal silence. In accordance with this precedent, the\r\nfollowing judgment, reported in the ’Traite des Confesseurs’, was given\r\nby Roderic Acugno. A Catalonian, native of Barcelona, who was condemned\r\nto death for homicide and owned his guilt, refused to confess when the\r\nhour of punishment arrived. However strongly pressed, he resisted, and\r\nso violently, giving no reason, that all were persuaded that his mind\r\nwas unhinged by the fear of death. Saint-Thomas of Villeneuve,\r\nArchbishop of Valencia, heard of his obstinacy. Valencia was the place\r\nwhere his sentence was given. The worthy prelate was so charitable as to\r\ntry to persuade the criminal to make his confession, so as not to lose\r\nhis soul as well as his body. Great was his surprise, when he asked the\r\nreason of the refusal, to hear the doomed man declare that he hated\r\nconfessors, because he had been condemned through the treachery of his\r\nown priest, who was the only person who knew about the murder. In\r\nconfession he had admitted his crime and said where the body was buried,\r\nand all about it; his confessor had revealed it all, and he could not\r\ndeny it, and so he had been condemned. He had only just learned, what he\r\ndid not know at the time he confessed, that his confessor was the\r\nbrother of the man he had killed, and that the desire for vengeance had\r\nprompted the bad priest to betray his confession. Saint-Thomas, hearing\r\nthis, thought that this incident was of more importance than the trial,\r\nwhich concerned the life of only one person, whereas the honour of\r\nreligion was at stake, with consequences infinitely more important. He\r\nfelt he must verify this statement, and summoned the confessor. When he\r\nhad admitted the breach of faith, the judges were obliged to revoke\r\ntheir sentence and pardon the criminal, much to the gratification of the\r\npublic mind. The confessor was adjudged a very severe penance, which\r\nSaint-Thomas modified because of his prompt avowal of his fault, and\r\nstill more because he had given an opportunity for the public exhibition\r\nof that reverence which judges themselves are bound to pay to\r\nconfessions.\r\n\r\nSECOND CASE\r\n\r\nIn 1579 an innkeeper at Toulouse killed with his own hand, unknown to\r\nthe inmates of his house, a stranger who had come to lodge with him, and\r\nburied him secretly in the cellar. The wretch then suffered from\r\nremorse, and confessed the crime with all its circumstances, telling his\r\nconfessor where the body was buried. The relations of the dead man,\r\nafter making all possible search to get news of him, at last proclaimed\r\nthrough the town a large reward to be given to anyone who would discover\r\nwhat had happened to him. The confessor, tempted by this bait, secretly\r\ngave word that they had only to search in the innkeeper’s cellar and\r\nthey would find the corpse. And they found it in the place indicated.\r\nThe innkeeper was thrown into prison, was tortured, and confessed his\r\ncrime. But afterwards he always maintained that his confessor was the\r\nonly person who could have betrayed him. Then the Parliament, indignant\r\nwith such means of finding out the truth, declared him innocent, failing\r\nother proof than what came through his confessor. The confessor was\r\nhimself condemned to be hanged, and his body was burnt. So fully did the\r\ntribunal in its wisdom recognise the importance of securing the sanctity\r\nof a sacrament that is indispensable to salvation.\r\n\r\nTHIRD CASE\r\n\r\nAn Armenian woman had inspired a violent passion in a young Turkish\r\ngentleman, but her prudence was long an obstacle to her lover’s desires.\r\nAt last he went beyond all bounds, and threatened to kill both her and\r\nher husband if she refused to gratify him. Frightened by this threat,\r\nwhich she knew too well he would carry out, she feigned consent, and\r\ngave the Turk a rendezvous at her house at an hour when she said her\r\nhusband would be absent; but by arrangement the husband arrived, and\r\nalthough the Turk was armed with a sabre and a pair of pistols, it so\r\nbefell that they were fortunate enough to kill their enemy, whom they\r\nburied under their dwelling unknown to all the world. But some days\r\nafter the event they went to confess to a priest of their nation, and\r\nrevealed every detail of the tragic story. This unworthy minister of the\r\nLord supposed that in a Mahommedan country, where the laws of the\r\npriesthood and the functions of a confessor are either unknown or\r\ndisapproved, no examination would be made into the source of his\r\ninformation, and that his evidence would have the same weight as any\r\nother accuser’s. So he resolved to make a profit and gratify his own\r\navarice. Several times he visited the husband and wife, always borrowing\r\nconsiderable sums, and threatening to reveal their crime if they refused\r\nhim. The first few times the poor creatures gave in to his exactions;\r\nbut the moment came at last when, robbed of all their fortune, they were\r\nobliged to refuse the sum he demanded. Faithful to his threat, the\r\npriest, with a view to more reward, at once denounced them to the dead\r\nman’s father. He, who had adored his son, went to the vizier, told him\r\nhe had identified the murderers through their confessor, and asked for\r\njustice. But this denunciation had by no means the desired effect. The\r\nvizier, on the contrary, felt deep pity for the wretched Armenians, and\r\nindignation against the priest who had betrayed them. He put the accuser\r\ninto a room which adjoined the court, and sent for the Armenian bishop\r\nto ask what confession really was, and what punishment was deserved by a\r\npriest who betrayed it, and what was the fate of those whose crimes were\r\nmade known in this fashion. The bishop replied that the secrets of\r\nconfession are inviolable, that Christians burn the priest who reveals\r\nthem, and absolve those whom he accuses, because the avowal made by the\r\nguilty to the priest is proscribed by the Christian religion, on pain of\r\neternal damnation. The vizier, satisfied with the answer, took the\r\nbishop into another room, and summoned the accused to declare all the\r\ncircumstances: the poor wretches, half dead, fell at the vizier’s feet.\r\nThe woman spoke, explaining that the necessity of defending life and\r\nhonour had driven them to take up arms to kill their enemy. She added\r\nthat God alone had witnessed their crime, and it would still be unknown\r\nhad not the law of the same God compelled them to confide it to the ear\r\nof one of His ministers for their forgiveness. Now the priest’s\r\ninsatiable avarice had ruined them first and then denounced them. The\r\nvizier made them go into a third room, and ordered the treacherous\r\npriest to be confronted with the bishop, making him again rehearse the\r\npenalties incurred by those who betray confessions. Then, applying this\r\nto the guilty priest, he condemned him to be burnt alive in a public\r\nplace;—in anticipation, said he, of burning in hell, where he would\r\nassuredly receive the punishment of his infidelity and crimes. The\r\nsentence was executed without delay.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the effect which the advocate intended to produce by these\r\nthree cases, either the judges rejected them, or perhaps they thought\r\nthe other evidence without the confession was enough, and it was soon\r\nclear to everyone, by the way the trial went forward, that the marquise\r\nwould be condemned. Indeed, before sentence was pronounced, on the\r\nmorning of July 16th, 1676, she saw M. Pirot, doctor of the Sorbonne,\r\ncome into her prison, sent by the chief president. This worthy\r\nmagistrate, foreseeing the issue, and feeling that one so guilty should\r\nnot be left till the last moment, had sent the good priest. The latter,\r\nalthough he had objected that the Conciergerie had its own two\r\nchaplains, and added that he was too feeble to undertake such a task,\r\nbeing unable even to see another man bled without feeling ill, accepted\r\nthe painful mission, the president having so strongly urged it, on the\r\nground that in this case he needed a man who could be entirely trusted.\r\nThe president, in fact, declared that, accustomed as he was to dealing\r\nwith criminals, the strength of the marquise amazed him. The day before\r\nhe summoned M. Pirot, he had worked at the trial from morning to night,\r\nand for thirteen hours the accused had been confronted with Briancourt,\r\none of the chief witnesses against her. On that very day, there had been\r\nfive hours more, and she had borne it all, showing as much respect\r\ntowards her judges as haughtiness towards the witness, reproaching him\r\nas a miserable valet, given to drink, and protesting that as he had been\r\ndismissed for his misdemeanours, his testimony against her ought to go\r\nfor nothing. So the chief president felt no hope of breaking her\r\ninflexible spirit, except by the agency of a minister of religion; for\r\nit was not enough to put her to death, the poisons must perish with her,\r\nor else society would gain nothing. The doctor Pirot came to the\r\nmarquise with a letter from her sister, who, as we know, was a nun\r\nbearing the name of Sister Marie at the convent Saint-Jacques. Her\r\nletter exhorted the marquise, in the most touching and affectionate\r\nterms, to place her confidence in the good priest, and look upon him not\r\nonly as a helper but as a friend.\r\n\r\nWhen M. Pirot came before the marquise, she had just left the dock,\r\nwhere she had been for three hours without confessing anything, or\r\nseeming in the least touched by what the president said, though he,\r\nafter acting the part of judge, addressed her simply as a Christian, and\r\nshowing her what her deplorable position was, appearing now for the last\r\ntime before men, and destined so soon to appear before God, spoke to her\r\nsuch moving words that he broke down himself, and the oldest and most\r\nobdurate judges present wept when they heard him. When the marquise\r\nperceived the doctor, suspecting that her trial was leading her to\r\ndeath, she approached him, saying:\r\n\r\n\"You have come, sir, because——\"\r\n\r\nBut Father Chavigny, who was with M. Pirot; interrupted her, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Madame, we will begin with a prayer.\"\r\n\r\nThey all fell on their knees invoking the Holy Spirit; then the marquise\r\nasked them to add a prayer to the Virgin, and, this prayer finished, she\r\nwent up to the doctor, and, beginning afresh, said:\r\n\r\n\"Sir, no doubt the president has sent you to give me consolation: with\r\nyou I am to pass the little life I have left. I have long been eager to\r\nsee you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame,\" the doctor replied, \"I come to render you any spiritual office\r\nthat I can; I only wish it were on another occasion.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must have resolution, sir,\" said she, smiling, \"for all things.\"\r\n\r\nThen turning to Father Chavigny, she said:\r\n\r\n\"My father, I am very grateful to you for bringing the doctor here, and\r\nfor all the other visits you have been willing to pay me. Pray to God\r\nfor me, I entreat you; henceforth I shall speak with no one but the\r\ndoctor, for with him I must speak of things that can only be discussed\r\ntete-a-tete. Farewell, then, my father; God will reward you for the\r\nattention you have been willing to bestow upon me.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words the father retired, leaving the marquise alone with the\r\ndoctor and the two men and one woman always in attendance on her. They\r\nwere in a large room in the Montgomery tower extending, throughout its\r\nwhole length. There was at the end of the room a bed with grey curtains\r\nfor the lady, and a folding-bed for the custodian. It is said to have\r\nbeen the same room where the poet Theophile was once shut up, and near\r\nthe door there were still verses in his well-known style written by his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the two men and the woman saw for what the doctor had come,\r\nthey retired to the end of the room, leaving the marquise free to ask\r\nfor and receive the consolations brought her by the man of God. Then the\r\ntwo sat at a table side by side. The marquise thought she was already\r\ncondemned, and began to speak on that assumption; but the doctor told\r\nher that sentence was not yet given, and he did not know precisely when\r\nit would be, still less what it would be; but at these words the\r\nmarquise interrupted him.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" she said, \"I am not troubled about the future. If my sentence is\r\nnot given yet, it soon will be. I expect the news this morning, and I\r\nknow it will be death: the only grace I look for from the president is a\r\ndelay between the sentence and its execution; for if I were executed\r\nto-day I should have very little time to prepare, and I feel I have need\r\nfor more.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor did not expect such words, so he was overjoyed to learn what\r\nshe felt. In addition to what the president had said, he had heard from\r\nFather Chavigny that he had told her the Sunday before that it was very\r\nunlikely she would escape death, and indeed, so far as one could judge\r\nby reports in the town, it was a foregone conclusion. When he said so,\r\nat first she had appeared stunned, and said with an air of great terror,\r\n\"Father, must I die?\" And when he tried to speak words of consolation,\r\nshe had risen and shaken her head, proudly replying—\r\n\r\n\"No, no, father; there is no need to encourage me. I will play my part,\r\nand that at once: I shall know how to die like a woman of spirit.\"\r\n\r\nThen the father had told her that we cannot prepare for death so quickly\r\nand so easily; and that we have to be in readiness for a long time, not\r\nto be taken by surprise; and she had replied that she needed but a\r\nquarter of an hour to confess in, and one moment to die.\r\n\r\nSo the doctor was very glad to find that between Sunday and Thursday her\r\nfeelings had changed so much.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said she, \"the more I reflect the more I feel that one day would\r\nnot be enough to prepare myself for God’s tribunal, to be judged by Him\r\nafter men have judged me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame,\" replied the doctor, \"I do not know what or when your sentence\r\nwill be; but should it be death, and given to-day, I may venture to\r\npromise you that it will not be carried out before to-morrow. But\r\nalthough death is as yet uncertain, I think it well that you should be\r\nprepared for any event.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my death is quite certain,\" said she, \"and I must not give way to\r\nuseless hopes. I must repose in you the great secrets of my whole life;\r\nbut, father, before this opening of my heart, let me hear from your lips\r\nthe opinion you have formed of me, and what you think in my present\r\nstate I ought to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"You perceive my plan,\" said the doctor, \"and you anticipate what I was\r\nabout to say. Before entering into the secrets of your conscience,\r\nbefore opening the discussion of your affairs with God, I am ready,\r\nmadame, to give you certain definite rules. I do not yet know whether\r\nyou are guilty at all, and I suspend my judgment as to all the crimes\r\nyou are accused of, since of them I can learn nothing except through\r\nyour confession. Thus it is my duty still to doubt your guilt. But I\r\ncannot be ignorant of what you are accused of: this is a public matter,\r\nand has reached my ears; for, as you may imagine, madame, your affairs\r\nhave made a great stir, and there are few people who know nothing about\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said, smiling, \"I know there has been a great deal of talk,\r\nand I am in every man’s mouth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" replied the doctor, \"the crime you are accused of is poisoning.\r\nIf you are guilty, as is believed, you cannot hope that God will pardon\r\nyou unless you make known to your judges what the poison is, what is its\r\ncomposition and what its antidote, also the names of your accomplices.\r\nMadame, we must lay hands on all these evil-doers without exception; for\r\nif you spared them, they would be able to make use of your poison, and\r\nyou would then be guilty of all the murders committed by them after your\r\ndeath, because you did not give them over to the judges during your\r\nlife; thus one might say you survive yourself, for your crime survives\r\nyou. You know, madame, that a sin in the moment of death is never\r\npardoned, and that to get remission for your crimes, if crimes you have,\r\nthey must die when you die: for if you slay them not, be very sure they\r\nwill slay you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am sure of that,\" replied the marquise, after a moment of silent\r\nthought; \"and though I will not admit that I am guilty, I promise, if I\r\nam guilty, to weigh your words. But one question, sir, and pray take\r\nheed that an answer is necessary. Is there not crime in this world that\r\nis beyond pardon? Are not some people guilty of sins so terrible and so\r\nnumerous that the Church dares not pardon them, and if God, in His\r\njustice, takes account of them, He cannot for all His mercy pardon them?\r\nSee, I begin with this question, because, if I am to have no hope, it is\r\nneedless for me to confess.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish to think, madame,\" replied the doctor, in spite of himself half\r\nfrightened at the marquise, \"that this your first question is only put\r\nby way of a general thesis, and has nothing to do with your own state. I\r\nshall answer the question without any personal application. No, madame,\r\nin this life there are no unpardonable sinners, terrible and numerous\r\nhowsoever their sins may be. This is an article of faith, and without\r\nholding it you could not die a good Catholic. Some doctors, it is true,\r\nhave before now maintained the contrary, but they have been condemned as\r\nheretics. Only despair and final impenitence are unpardonable, and they\r\nare not sins of our life but in our death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" replied the marquise, \"God has given me grace to be convinced by\r\nwhat you say, and I believe He will pardon all sins—that He has often\r\nexercised this power. Now all my trouble is that He may not deign to\r\ngrant all His goodness to one so wretched as I am, a creature so\r\nunworthy of the favours already bestowed on her.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor reassured her as best he could, and began to examine her\r\nattentively as they conversed together. \"She was,\" he said, \"a woman\r\nnaturally courageous and fearless; naturally gentle and good; not easily\r\nexcited; clever and penetrating, seeing things very clearly in her mind,\r\nand expressing herself well and in few but careful words; easily finding\r\na way out of a difficulty, and choosing her line of conduct in the most\r\nembarrassing circumstances; light-minded and fickle; unstable, paying no\r\nattention if the same thing were said several times over. For this\r\nreason,\" continued the doctor, \"I was obliged to alter what I had to say\r\nfrom time to time, keeping her but a short time to one subject, to\r\nwhich, however, I would return later, giving the matter a new appearance\r\nand disguising it a little. She spoke little and well, with no sign of\r\nlearning and no affectation, always, mistress of herself, always\r\ncomposed and saying just what she intended to say. No one would have\r\nsupposed from her face or from her conversation that she was so wicked\r\nas she must have been, judging by her public avowal of the parricide. It\r\nis surprising, therefore—and one must bow down before the judgment of\r\nGod when He leaves mankind to himself—that a mind evidently of some\r\ngrandeur, professing fearlessness in the most untoward and unexpected\r\nevents, an immovable firmness and a resolution to await and to endure\r\ndeath if so it must be, should yet be so criminal as she was proved to\r\nbe by the parricide to which she confessed before her judges. She had\r\nnothing in her face that would indicate such evil. She had very abundant\r\nchestnut hair, a rounded, well-shaped face, blue eyes very pretty and\r\ngentle, extraordinarily white skin, good nose, and no disagreeable\r\nfeature. Still, there was nothing unusually attractive in the face:\r\nalready she was a little wrinkled, and looked older than her age.\r\nSomething made me ask at our first interview how old she was.\r\n’Monsieur,’ she said, ’if I were to live till Sainte-Madeleine’s day I\r\nshould be forty-six. On her day I came into the world, and I bear her\r\nname. I was christened Marie-Madeleine. But near to the day as we now\r\nare, I shall not live so long: I must end to-day, or at latest\r\nto-morrow, and it will be a favour to give me the one day. For this\r\nkindness I rely on your word.’ Anyone would have thought she was quite\r\nforty-eight. Though her face as a rule looked so gentle, whenever an\r\nunhappy thought crossed her mind she showed it by a contortion that\r\nfrightened one at first, and from time to time I saw her face twitching\r\nwith anger, scorn, or ill-will. I forgot to say that she was very little\r\nand thin. Such is, roughly given, a description of her body and mind,\r\nwhich I very soon came to know, taking pains from the first to observe\r\nher, so as to lose no time in acting on what I discovered.\"\r\n\r\nAs she was giving a first brief sketch of her life to her confessor, the\r\nmarquise remembered that he had not yet said mass, and reminded him\r\nherself that it was time to do so, pointing out to him the chapel of the\r\nConciergerie. She begged him to say a mass for her and in honour of Our\r\nLady, so that she might gain the intercession of the Virgin at the\r\nthrone of God. The Virgin she had always taken for her patron saint, and\r\nin the midst of her crimes and disorderly life had never ceased in her\r\npeculiar devotion. As she could not go with the priest, she promised to\r\nbe with him at least in the spirit. He left her at half-past ten in the\r\nmorning, and after four hours spent alone together, she had been induced\r\nby his piety and gentleness to make confessions that could not be wrung\r\nfrom her by the threats of the judges or the fear of the question. The\r\nholy and devout priest said his mass, praying the Lord’s help for\r\nconfessor and penitent alike. After mass, as he returned, he learned\r\nfrom a librarian called Seney, at the porter’s lodge, as he was taking a\r\nglass of wine, that judgment had been given, and that Madame de\r\nBrinvilliers was to have her hand cut off. This severity—as a fact,\r\nthere was a mitigation of the sentence—made him feel yet more interest\r\nin his penitent, and he hastened back to her side.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she saw the door open, she advanced calmly towards him, and\r\nasked if he had truly prayed for her; and when he assured her of this,\r\nshe said, \"Father, shall I have the consolation of receiving the\r\nviaticum before I die?\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame,\" replied the doctor, \"if you are condemned to death, you must\r\ndie without that sacrament, and I should be deceiving you if I let you\r\nhope for it. We have heard of the death of the constable of Saint-Paul\r\nwithout his obtaining this grace, in spite of all his entreaties. He was\r\nexecuted in sight of the towers of Notre-Dame. He offered his own\r\nprayer, as you may offer yours, if you suffer the same fate. But that is\r\nall: God, in His goodness, allows it to suffice.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" replied the marquise, \"I believe M. de Cinq-Mars and M. de Thou\r\ncommunicated before their death.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think not, madame,\" said the doctor; \"for it is not so said in the\r\npages of Montresor or any other book that describes their execution.\"\r\n\r\n\"But M. de Montmorency?\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"But M. de Marillac?\" replied the doctor.\r\n\r\nIn truth, if the favour had been granted to the first, it had been\r\nrefused to the second, and the marquise was specially struck thereby,\r\nfor M. de Marillac was of her own family, and she was very proud of the\r\nconnection. No doubt she was unaware that M. de Rohan had received the\r\nsacrament at the midnight mass said for the salvation of his soul by\r\nFather Bourdaloue, for she said nothing about it, and hearing the\r\ndoctor’s answer, only sighed.\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" he continued, \"in recalling examples of the kind, madame, you\r\nmust not build upon them, please: they are extraordinary cases, not the\r\nrule. You must expect no privilege; in your case the ordinary laws will\r\nbe carried out, and your fate will not differ from the fate of other\r\ncondemned persons. How would it have been had you lived and died before\r\nthe reign of Charles VI? Up to the reign of this prince, the guilty died\r\nwithout confession, and it was only by this king’s orders that there was\r\na relaxation of this severity. Besides, communion is not absolutely\r\nnecessary to salvation, and one may communicate spiritually in reading\r\nthe word, which is like the body; in uniting oneself with the Church,\r\nwhich is the mystical substance of Christ; and in suffering for Him and\r\nwith Him, this last communion of agony that is your portion, madame, and\r\nis the most perfect communion of all. If you heartily detest your crime\r\nand love God with all your soul, if you have faith and charity, your\r\ndeath is a martyrdom and a new baptism.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas, my God,\" replied the marquise, \"after what you tell me, now that\r\nI know the executioner’s hand was necessary to my salvation, what should\r\nI have become had I died at Liege? Where should I have been now? And\r\neven if I had not been taken, and had lived another twenty years away\r\nfrom France, what would my death have been, since it needed the scaffold\r\nfor my purification? Now I see all my wrong-doings, and the worst of all\r\nis the last—I mean my effrontery before the judges. But all is not yet\r\nlost, God be thanked; and as I have one last examination to go through,\r\nI desire to make a complete confession about my whole life. You, Sir, I\r\nentreat specially to ask pardon on my behalf of the first president;\r\nyesterday, when I was in the dock, he spoke very touching words to me,\r\nand I was deeply moved; but I would not show it, thinking that if I made\r\nno avowal the evidence would not be sufficiently strong to convict me.\r\nBut it has happened otherwise, and I must have scandalised my judges by\r\nsuch an exhibition of hardihood. Now I recognise my fault, and will\r\nrepair it. Furthermore, sir, far from feeling angry with the president\r\nfor the judgment he to-day passes against me, far from complaining of\r\nthe prosecutor who has demanded it, I thank them both most humbly, for\r\nmy salvation depends upon it.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor was about to answer, encouraging her, when the door opened:\r\nit was dinner coming in, for it was now half-past one. The marquise\r\npaused and watched what was brought in, as though she were playing\r\nhostess in her own country house. She made the woman and the two men who\r\nwatched her sit down to the table, and turning to the doctor, said,\r\n\"Sir, you will not wish me to stand on ceremony with you; these good\r\npeople always dine with me to keep me company, and if you approve, we\r\nwill do the same to-day. This is the last meal,\" she added, addressing\r\nthem, \"that I shall take with you.\" Then turning to the woman, \"Poor\r\nMadame du Rus,\" said she, \"I have been a trouble to you for a long time;\r\nbut have a little patience, and you will soon be rid of me. To-morrow\r\nyou can go to Dravet; you will have time, for in seven or eight hours\r\nfrom now there will be nothing more to do for me, and I shall be in the\r\ngentleman’s hands; you will not be allowed near me. After then, you can\r\ngo away for good; for I don’t suppose you will have the heart to see me\r\nexecuted.\" All this she said quite calmly, but not with pride. From time\r\nto time her people tried to hide their tears, and she made a sign of\r\npitying them. Seeing that the dinner was on the table and nobody eating,\r\nshe invited the doctor to take some soup, asking him to excuse the\r\ncabbage in it, which made it a common soup and unworthy of his\r\nacceptance. She herself took some soup and two eggs, begging her\r\nfellow-guests to excuse her for not serving them, pointing out that no\r\nknife or fork had been set in her place.\r\n\r\nWhen the meal was almost half finished, she begged the doctor to let her\r\ndrink his health. He replied by drinking hers, and she seemed to be\r\nquite charmed by, his condescension. \"To-morrow is a fast day,\" said\r\nshe, setting down her glass, \"and although it will be a day of great\r\nfatigue for me, as I shall have to undergo the question as well as\r\ndeath, I intend to obey the orders of the Church and keep my fast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame,\" replied the doctor, \"if you needed soup to keep you up, you\r\nwould not have to feel any scruple, for it will be no self-indulgence,\r\nbut a necessity, and the Church does not exact fasting in such a case.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" replied the marquise, \"I will make no difficulty about it, if it\r\nis necessary and if you order it; but it will not be needed, I think: if\r\nI have some soup this evening for supper, and some more made stronger\r\nthan usual a little before midnight, it will be enough to last me\r\nthrough to-morrow, if I have two fresh eggs to take after the question.\"\r\n\r\n\"In truth,\" says the priest in the account we give here, \"I was alarmed\r\nby this calm behaviour. I trembled when I heard her give orders to the\r\nconcierge that the soup was to be made stronger than usual and that she\r\nwas to have two cups before midnight. When dinner was over, she was\r\ngiven pen and ink, which she had already asked for, and told me that she\r\nhad a letter to write before I took up my pen to put down what she\r\nwanted to dictate.\" The letter, she explained, which was difficult to\r\nwrite, was to her husband. She would feel easier when it was written.\r\nFor her husband she expressed so much affection, that the doctor,\r\nknowing what had passed, felt much surprised, and wishing to try her,\r\nsaid that the affection was not reciprocated, as her husband had\r\nabandoned her the whole time of the trial. The marquise interrupted him:\r\n\r\n\"My father, we must not judge things too quickly or merely by\r\nappearances. M. de Brinvilliers has always concerned himself with me,\r\nand has only failed in doing what it was impossible to do. Our\r\ninterchange of letters never ceased while I was out of the kingdom; do\r\nnot doubt but that he would have come to Paris as soon as he knew I was\r\nin prison, had the state of his affairs allowed him to come safely. But\r\nyou must know that he is deeply in debt, and could not appear in Paris\r\nwithout being arrested. Do not suppose that he is without feeling for\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nShe then began to write, and when her letter was finished she handed it\r\nto the doctor, saying, \"You, sir, are the lord and master of all my\r\nsentiments from now till I die; read this letter, and if you find\r\nanything that should be altered, tell me.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the letter—\r\n\r\n\"When I am on the point of yielding up my soul to God, I wish to assure\r\nyou of my affection for you, which I shall feel until the last moment of\r\nmy life. I ask your pardon for all that I have done contrary to my duty.\r\nI am dying a shameful death, the work of my enemies: I pardon them with\r\nall my heart, and I pray you to do the same. I also beg you to forgive\r\nme for any ignominy that may attach to you herefrom; but consider that\r\nwe are only here for a time, and that you may soon be forced to render\r\nan account to God of all your actions, and even your idle words, just as\r\nI must do now. Be mindful of your worldly affairs, and of our children,\r\nand give them a good example; consult Madame Marillac and Madame Couste.\r\nLet as many prayers as possible be said for me, and believe that in my\r\ndeath I am still ever yours, D’AUBRAY.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor read this letter carefully; then he told her that one of her\r\nphrases was not right—the one about her enemies. \"For you have no other\r\nenemies,\" said he, \"than your own crimes. Those whom you call your\r\nenemies are those who love the memory of your father and brothers, whom\r\nyou ought to have loved more than they do.\"\r\n\r\n\"But those who have sought my death,\" she replied, \"are my enemies, are\r\nthey not, and is it not a Christian act to forgive them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame,\" said the doctor, \"they are not your enemies, but you are the\r\nenemy of the human race: nobody can think without, horror of your\r\ncrimes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so, my father,\" she replied, \"I feel no resentment towards them,\r\nand I desire to meet in Paradise those who have been chiefly\r\ninstrumental in taking me and bringing me here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame,\" said the doctor, \"what mean you by this? Such words are used\r\nby some when they desire people’s death. Explain, I beg, what you mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heaven forbid,\" cried the marquise, \"that you should understand me\r\nthus! Nay, may God grant them long prosperity in this world and infinite\r\nglory in the next! Dictate a new letter, and I will write just what you\r\nplease.\"\r\n\r\nWhen a fresh letter had been written, the marquise would attend to\r\nnothing but her confession, and begged the doctor to take the pen for\r\nher. \"I have done so many wrong thing’s,\" she said, \"that if I only gave\r\nyou a verbal confession, I should never be sure I had given a complete\r\naccount.\"\r\n\r\nThen they both knelt down to implore the grace of the Holy Spirit. They\r\nsaid a ’Veni Creator’ and a ’Salve Regina’, and the doctor then rose and\r\nseated himself at a table, while the marquise, still on her knees, began\r\na Confiteor and made her whole confession. At nine o’clock, Father\r\nChavigny, who had brought Doctor Pirot in the morning, came in again.\r\nThe marquise seemed annoyed, but still put a good face upon it. \"My\r\nfather,\" said she, \"I did not expect to see you so late; pray leave me a\r\nfew minutes longer with the doctor.\" He retired. \"Why has he come?\"\r\nasked the marquise.\r\n\r\n\"It is better for you not to be alone,\" said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Then do you mean to leave me?\" cried the marquise, apparently\r\nterrified.\r\n\r\n\"Madame, I will do as you wish,\" he answered; \"but you would be acting\r\nkindly if you could spare me for a few hours. I might go home, and\r\nFather Chavigny would stay with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" she cried, wringing her hands, \"you promised you would not leave\r\nme till I am dead, and now you go away. Remember, I never saw you before\r\nthis morning, but since then you have become more to me than any of my\r\noldest friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame,\" said the good doctor, \"I will do all I can to please you. If I\r\nask for a little rest, it is in order that I may resume my place with\r\nmore vigour to-morrow, and render you better service than I otherwise\r\ncould. If I take no rest, all I say or do must suffer. You count on the\r\nexecution for tomorrow; I do not know if you are right; but if so,\r\nto-morrow will be your great and decisive day, and we shall both need\r\nall the strength we have. We have already been working for thirteen or\r\nfourteen hours for the good of your salvation; I am not a strong man,\r\nand I think you should realise, madame, that if you do not let me rest a\r\nlittle, I may not be able to stay with you to the end.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said the marquise, \"you have closed my mouth. To-morrow is for me\r\na far more important day than to-day, and I have been wrong: of course\r\nyou must rest to-night. Let us just finish this one thing, and read over\r\nwhat we have written.\"\r\n\r\nIt was done, and the doctor would have retired; but the supper came in,\r\nand the marquise would not let him go without taking something. She told\r\nthe concierge to get a carriage and charge it to her. She took a cup of\r\nsoup and two eggs, and a minute later the concierge came back to say the\r\ncarriage was at the door. Then the marquise bade the doctor good-night,\r\nmaking him promise to pray for her and to be at the Conciergerie by six\r\no’clock the next morning. This he promised her.\r\n\r\nThe day following, as he went into the tower, he found Father Chavigny,\r\nwho had taken his place with the marquise, kneeling and praying with\r\nher. The priest was weeping, but she was calm, and received the doctor\r\nin just the same way as she had let him go. When Father Chavigny saw\r\nhim, he retired. The marquise begged Chavigny to pray for her, and\r\nwanted to make him promise to return, but that he would not do. She then\r\nturned to the doctor, saying, \"Sir, you are punctual, and I cannot\r\ncomplain that you have broken your promise; but oh, how the time has\r\ndragged, and how long it has seemed before the clock struck six!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am here, madame,\" said the doctor; \"but first of all, how have you\r\nspent the night?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have written three letters,\" said the marquise, \"and, short as they\r\nwere, they took a long time to write: one was to my sister, one to\r\nMadame de Marillac, and the third to M. Couste. I should have liked to\r\nshow them to you, but Father Chavigny offered to take charge of them,\r\nand as he had approved of them, I could not venture to suggest any\r\ndoubts. After the letters were written, we had some conversation and\r\nprayer; but when the father took up his breviary and I my rosary with\r\nthe same intention, I felt so weary that I asked if I might lie on my\r\nbed; he said I might, and I had two good hours’ sleep without dreams or\r\nany sort of uneasiness; when I woke we prayed together, and had just\r\nfinished when you came back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, madame,\" said the doctor, \"if you will, we can pray again; kneel\r\ndown, and let us say the ’Veni Sancte Spiritus’.\"\r\n\r\nShe obeyed, and said the prayer with much unction and piety. The prayer\r\nfinished, M. Pirot was about to take up the pen to go on with the\r\nconfession, when she said, \"Pray let me submit to you one question which\r\nis troubling me. Yesterday you gave me great hope of the mercy of God;\r\nbut I cannot presume to hope I shall be saved without spending a long\r\ntime in purgatory; my crime is far too atrocious to be pardoned on any\r\nother conditions; and when I have attained to a love of God far greater\r\nthan I can feel here, I should not expect to be saved before my stains\r\nhave been purified by fire, without suffering the penalty that my sins\r\nhave deserved. But I have been told that the flames of purgatory where\r\nsouls are burned for a time are just the same as the flames of hell\r\nwhere those who are damned burn through all eternity tell me, then, how\r\ncan a soul awaking in purgatory at the moment of separation from this\r\nbody be sure that she is not really in hell? how can she know that the\r\nflames that burn her and consume not will some day cease? For the\r\ntorment she suffers is like that of the damned, and the flames wherewith\r\nshe is burned are even as the flames of hell. This I would fain know,\r\nthat at this awful moment I may feel no doubt, that I may know for\r\ncertain whether I dare hope or must despair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame,\" replied the doctor, \"you are right, and God is too just to add\r\nthe horror of uncertainty to His rightful punishments. At that moment\r\nwhen the soul quits her earthly body the judgment of God is passed upon\r\nher: she hears the sentence of pardon or of doom; she knows whether she\r\nis in the state of grace or of mortal sin; she sees whether she is to be\r\nplunged forever into hell, or if God sends her for a time to purgatory.\r\nThis sentence, madame, you will learn at the very instant when the\r\nexecutioner’s axe strikes you; unless, indeed, the fire of charity has\r\nso purified you in this life that you may pass, without any purgatory at\r\nall, straight to the home of the blessed who surround the throne of the\r\nLord, there to receive a recompense for earthly martyrdom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" replied the marquise, \"I have such faith in all you say that I\r\nfeel I understand it all now, and I am satisfied.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor and the marquise then resumed the confession that was\r\ninterrupted the night before. The marquise had during the night\r\nrecollected certain articles that she wanted to add. So they continued,\r\nthe doctor making her pause now and then in the narration of the heavier\r\noffences to recite an act of contrition.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour and a half they came to tell her to go down. The registrar\r\nwas waiting to read her the sentence. She listened very calmly,\r\nkneeling, only moving her head; then, with no alteration in her voice,\r\nshe said, \"In a moment: we will have one word more, the doctor and I,\r\nand then I am at your disposal.\" She then continued to dictate the rest\r\nof her confession. When she reached the end, she begged him to offer a\r\nshort prayer with her, that God might help her to appear with such\r\nbecoming contrition before her judges as should atone for her scandalous\r\neffrontery. She then took up her cloak, a prayer-book which Father\r\nChavigny had left with her, and followed the concierge, who led her to\r\nthe torture chamber, where her sentence was to be read.\r\n\r\nFirst, there was an examination which lasted five hours. The marquise\r\ntold all she had promised to tell, denying that she had any accomplices,\r\nand affirming that she knew nothing of the composition of the poisons\r\nshe had administered, and nothing of their antidotes. When this was\r\ndone, and the judges saw that they could extract nothing further, they\r\nsigned to the registrar to read the sentence. She stood to hear it: it\r\nwas as follows:\r\n\r\n\"That by the finding of the court, d’Aubray de Brinvilliers is convicted\r\nof causing the death by poison of Maitre Dreux d’Aubray, her father, and\r\nof the two Maitres d’Aubray, her brothers, one a civil lieutenant, the\r\nother a councillor to the Parliament, also of attempting the life of\r\nTherese d’Aubray, her sister; in punishment whereof the court has\r\ncondemned and does condemn the said d’Aubray de Brinvilliers to make the\r\nrightful atonement before the great gate of the church of Paris, whither\r\nshe shall be conveyed in a tumbril, barefoot, a rope on her neck,\r\nholding in her hands a burning torch two pounds in weight; and there on\r\nher knees she shall say and declare that maliciously, with desire for\r\nrevenge and seeking their goods, she did poison her father, cause to be\r\npoisoned her two brothers, and attempt the life of her sister, whereof\r\nshe doth repent, asking pardon of God, of the king, and of the judges;\r\nand when this is done, she shall be conveyed and carried in the same\r\ntumbril to the Place de Greve of this town, there to have her head cut\r\noff on a scaffold to be set up for the purpose at that place; afterwards\r\nher body to be burnt and the ashes scattered; and first she is to be\r\nsubjected to the question ordinary and extraordinary, that she may\r\nreveal the names of her accomplices. She is declared to be deprived of\r\nall successions from her said father, brothers, and sister, from the\r\ndate of the several crimes; and all her goods are confiscated to the\r\nproper persons; and the sum of 4000 livres shall be paid out of her\r\nestate to the king, and 400 livres to the Church for prayers to be said\r\non behalf of the poisoned persons; and all the costs shall be paid,\r\nincluding those of Amelin called Lachaussee. In Parliament, 16th July\r\n1676.\"\r\n\r\nThe marquise heard her sentence without showing any sign of fear or\r\nweakness. When it was finished, she said to the registrar, \"Will you,\r\nsir, be so kind as to read it again? I had not expected the tumbril, and\r\nI was so much struck by that that I lost the thread of what followed.\"\r\n\r\nThe registrar read the sentence again. From that moment she was the\r\nproperty of the executioner, who approached her. She knew him by the\r\ncord he held in his hands, and extended her own, looking him over coolly\r\nfrom head to foot without a word. The judges then filed out, disclosing\r\nas they did so the various apparatus of the question. The marquise\r\nfirmly gazed upon the racks and ghastly rings, on which so many had been\r\nstretched crying and screaming. She noticed the three buckets of water\r\n\r\n[Note: The torture with the water was thus administered. There were\r\neight vessels, each containing 2 pints of water. Four of these were\r\ngiven for the ordinary, and eight for the extraordinary. The executioner\r\ninserted a horn into the patient’s mouth, and if he shut his teeth,\r\nforced him to open them by pinching his nose with the finger and thumb.]\r\n\r\nprepared for her, and turned to the registrar—for she would not address\r\nthe executioner—saying, with a smile, \"No doubt all this water is to\r\ndrown me in? I hope you don’t suppose that a person of my size could\r\nswallow it all.\" The executioner said not a word, but began taking off\r\nher cloak and all her other garments, until she was completely naked. He\r\nthen led her up to the wall and made her sit on the rack of the ordinary\r\nquestion, two feet from the ground. There she was again asked to give\r\nthe names of her accomplices, the composition of the poison and its\r\nantidote; but she made the same reply as to the doctor, only adding, \"If\r\nyou do not believe me, you have my body in your hands, and you can\r\ntorture me.\"\r\n\r\nThe registrar signed to the executioner to do his duty. He first\r\nfastened the feet of the marquise to two rings close together fixed to a\r\nboard; then making her lie down, he fastened her wrists to two other\r\nrings in the wall, distant about three feet from each other. The head\r\nwas at the same height as the feet, and the body, held up on a trestle,\r\ndescribed a half-curve, as though lying over a wheel. To increase the\r\nstretch of the limbs, the man gave two turns to a crank, which pushed\r\nthe feet, at first about twelve inches from the rings, to a distance of\r\nsix inches. And here we may leave our narrative to reproduce the\r\nofficial report.\r\n\r\n\"On the small trestle, while she was being stretched, she said several\r\ntimes, ’My God! you are killing me! And I only spoke the truth.’\r\n\r\n\"The water was given: she turned and twisted, saying, ’You are killing\r\nme!’\r\n\r\n\"The water was again given.\r\n\r\n\"Admonished to name her accomplices, she said there was only one man,\r\nwho had asked her for poison to get rid of his wife, but he was dead.\r\n\r\n\"The water was given; she moved a little, but would not say anything.\r\n\r\n\"Admonished to say why, if she had no accomplice, she had written from\r\nthe Conciergerie to Penautier, begging him to do all he could for her,\r\nand to remember that his interests in this matter were the same as her\r\nown, she said that she never knew Penautier had had any understanding\r\nwith Sainte-Croix about the poisons, and it would be a lie to say\r\notherwise; but when a paper was found in Sainte-Croix’s box that\r\nconcerned Penautier, she remembered how often she had seen him at the\r\nhouse, and thought it possible that the friendship might have included\r\nsome business about the poisons; that, being in doubt on the point, she\r\nrisked writing a letter as though she were sure, for by doing so she was\r\nnot prejudicing her own case; for either Penautier was an accomplice of\r\nSainte-Croix or he was not. If he was, he would suppose the marquise\r\nknew enough to accuse him, and would accordingly do his best to save\r\nher; if he was not, the letter was a letter wasted, and that was all.\r\n\r\n\"The water was again given; she turned and twisted much, but said that\r\non this subject she had said all she possibly could; if she said\r\nanything else, it would be untrue.\"\r\n\r\nThe ordinary question was at an end. The marquise had now taken half the\r\nquantity of water she had thought enough to drown her. The executioner\r\npaused before he proceeded to the extraordinary question. Instead of the\r\ntrestle two feet and a half high on which she lay, they passed under her\r\nbody a trestle of three and a half feet, which gave the body a greater\r\narch, and as this was done without lengthening the ropes, her limbs were\r\nstill further stretched, and the bonds, tightly straining at wrists and\r\nankles, penetrated the flesh and made the blood run. The question began\r\nonce more, interrupted by the demands of the registrar and the answers\r\nof the sufferer. Her cries seemed not even to be heard.\r\n\r\n\"On the large trestle, during the stretching, she said several times, ’O\r\nGod, you tear me to, pieces! Lord, pardon me! Lord, have mercy upon me!’\r\n\r\n\"Asked if she had nothing more to tell regarding her accomplices, she\r\nsaid they might kill her, but she would not tell a lie that would\r\ndestroy her soul.\r\n\r\n\"The water was given, she moved about a little, but would not speak.\r\n\r\n\"Admonished that she should tell the composition of the poisons and\r\ntheir antidotes, she said that she did not know what was in them; the\r\nonly thing she could recall was toads; that Sainte-Croix never revealed\r\nhis secret to her; that she did not believe he made them himself, but\r\nhad them prepared by Glazer; she seemed to remember that some of them\r\ncontained nothing but rarefied arsenic; that as to an antidote, she knew\r\nof no other than milk; and Sainte-Croix had told her that if one had\r\ntaken milk in the morning, and on the first onset of the poison took\r\nanother glassful, one would have nothing to fear.\r\n\r\n\"Admonished to say if she could add anything further, she said she had\r\nnow told everything; and if they killed her, they could not extract\r\nanything more.\r\n\r\n\"More water was given; she writhed a little, and said she was dead, but\r\nnothing more.\r\n\r\n\"More water was given; she writhed more violently, but would say no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\"Yet again water was given; writhing and twisting, she said, with a deep\r\ngroan, ’O my God, I am killed!’ but would speak no more.\"\r\n\r\nThen they tortured her no further: she was let down, untied, and placed\r\nbefore the fire in the usual manner. While there, close to the fire,\r\nlying on the mattress, she was visited by the good doctor, who, feeling\r\nhe could not bear to witness the spectacle just described, had asked her\r\nleave to retire, that he might say a mass for her, that God might grant\r\nher patience and courage. It is plain that the good priest had not\r\nprayed in vain.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said the marquise, when she perceived him, \"I have long been\r\ndesiring to see you again, that you might comfort me. My torture has\r\nbeen very long and very painful, but this is the last time I shall have\r\nto treat with men; now all is with God for the future. See my hands,\r\nsir, and my feet, are they not torn and wounded? Have not my\r\nexecutioners smitten me in the same places where Christ was smitten?\"\r\n\r\n\"And therefore, madame,\" replied the priest, \"these sufferings now are\r\nyour happiness; each torture is one step nearer to heaven. As you say,\r\nyou are now for God alone; all your thoughts and hopes must be fastened\r\nupon Him; we must pray to Him, like the penitent king, to give you a\r\nplace among His elect; and since nought that is impure can pass thither,\r\nwe must strive, madame, to purify you from all that might bar the way to\r\nheaven.\"\r\n\r\nThe marquise rose with the doctor’s aid, for she could scarcely stand;\r\ntottering, she stepped forward between him and the executioner, who took\r\ncharge of her immediately after the sentence was read, and was not\r\nallowed to leave her before it was completely carried out. They all\r\nthree entered the chapel and went into the choir, where the doctor and\r\nthe marquise knelt in adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. At that moment\r\nseveral persons appeared in the nave, drawn by curiosity. They could not\r\nbe turned out, so the executioner, to save the marquise from being\r\nannoyed, shut the gate of the choir, and let the patient pass behind the\r\naltar. There she sat down in a chair, and the doctor on a seat opposite;\r\nthen he first saw, by the light of the chapel window, how greatly\r\nchanged she was. Her face, generally so pale, was inflamed, her eyes\r\nglowing and feverish, all her body involuntarily trembling. The doctor\r\nwould have spoken a few words of consolation, but she did not attend.\r\n\"Sir,\" she said, \"do you know that my sentence is an ignominious one? Do\r\nyou know there is fire in the sentence?\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor gave no answer; but, thinking she needed something, bade the\r\ngaoler to bring her wine. A minute later he brought it in a cup, and the\r\ndoctor handed it to the marquise, who moistened her lips and then gave\r\nit back. She then noticed that her neck was uncovered, and took out her\r\nhandkerchief to cover it, asking the gaoler for a pin to fasten it with.\r\nWhen he was slow in finding a pin, looking on his person for it, she\r\nfancied that he feared she would choke herself, and shaking her head,\r\nsaid, with a smile, \"You have nothing to fear now; and here is the\r\ndoctor, who will pledge his word that I will do myself no mischief.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame,\" said the gaoler, handing her the pin she wanted, \"I beg your\r\npardon for keeping you waiting. I swear I did not distrust you; if\r\nanyone distrusts you, it is not I.\"\r\n\r\nThen kneeling before her, he begged to kiss her hand. She gave it, and\r\nasked him to pray to God for her. \"Ah yes,\" he cried, sobbing, \"with all\r\nmy heart.\" She then fastened her dress as best she could with her hands\r\ntied, and when the gaoler had gone and she was alone with the doctor,\r\nsaid:—\r\n\r\n\"Did you not hear what I said, sir? I told you there was fire in my\r\nsentence. And though it is only after death that my body is to be burnt,\r\nit will always be a terrible disgrace on my memory. I am saved the pain\r\nof being burnt alive, and thus, perhaps, saved from a death of despair,\r\nbut the shamefulness is the same, and it is that I think of.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame,\" said the doctor, \"it in no way affects your soul’s salvation\r\nwhether your body is cast into the fire and reduced to ashes or whether\r\nit is buried in the ground and eaten by worms, whether it is drawn on a\r\nhurdle and thrown upon a dung-heap, or embalmed with Oriental perfumes\r\nand laid in a rich man’s tomb. Whatever may be your end, your body will\r\narise on the appointed day, and if Heaven so will, it will come forth\r\nfrom its ashes more glorious than a royal corpse lying at this moment in\r\na gilded casket. Obsequies, madame, are for those who survive, not for\r\nthe dead.\"\r\n\r\nA sound was heard at the door of the choir. The doctor went to see what\r\nit was, and found a man who insisted on entering, all but fighting with\r\nthe executioner. The doctor approached and asked what was the matter.\r\nThe man was a saddler, from whom the marquise had bought a carriage\r\nbefore she left France; this she had partly paid for, but still owed him\r\ntwo hundred livres. He produced the note he had had from her, on which\r\nwas a faithful record of the sums she had paid on account. The marquise\r\nat this point called out, not knowing what was going on, and the doctor\r\nand executioner went to her. \"Have they come to fetch me already?\" said\r\nshe. \"I am not well prepared just at this moment; but never mind, I am\r\nready.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor reassured her, and told her what was going on. \"The man is\r\nquite right,\" she said to the executioner; \"tell him I will give orders\r\nas far as I can about the money.\" Then, seeing the executioner retiring,\r\nshe said to the doctor, \"Must I go now, sir? I wish they would give me a\r\nlittle more time; for though I am ready, as I told you, I am not really\r\nprepared. Forgive me, father; it is the question and the sentence that\r\nhave upset me it is this fire burning in my eyes like hell-flames.\r\n\r\n\"Had they left me with you all this time, there would now be better hope\r\nof my salvation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame,\" said the doctor, \"you will probably have all the time before\r\nnightfall to compose yourself and think what remains for you to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, sir,\" she replied, with a smile, \"do not think they will show so\r\nmuch consideration for a poor wretch condemned to be burnt. That does\r\nnot depend on ourselves; but as soon as everything is ready, they will\r\nlet us know, and we must start.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame,\" said the doctor, \"I am certain that they will give you the\r\ntime you need.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" she replied abruptly and feverishly, \"no, I will not keep them\r\nwaiting. As soon as the tumbril is at this door, they have only to tell\r\nme, and I go down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame,\" said he, \"I would not hold you back if I found you prepared to\r\nstand before the face of God, for in your situation it is right to ask\r\nfor no time, and to go when the moment is come; but not everyone is so\r\nready as Christ was, who rose from prayer and awaked His disciples that\r\nHe might leave the garden and go out to meet His enemies. You at this\r\nmoment are weak, and if they come for you just now I should resist your\r\ndeparture.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be calm; the time is not yet come,\" said the executioner, who had heard\r\nthis talk. He knew his statement must be believed, and wished as far as\r\npossible to reassure the marquise. \"There is no hurry, and we cannot\r\nstart for another two or three hours.\"\r\n\r\nThis assurance calmed the marquise somewhat, and she thanked the man.\r\nThen turning to the doctor, she said, \"Here is a rosary that I would\r\nrather should not fall into this person’s hands. Not that he could not\r\nmake good use of it; for, in spite of their trade, I fancy that these\r\npeople are Christians like ourselves. But I should prefer to leave this\r\nto somebody else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame,\" said the doctor, \"if you will tell me your wishes in this\r\nmatter, I will see that they are carried out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" she said, \"there is no one but my sister; and I fear lest she,\r\nremembering my crime towards her, may be too horrified to touch anything\r\nthat belonged to me. If she did not mind, it would be a great comfort to\r\nme to think she would wear it after my death, and that the sight of it\r\nwould remind her to pray for me; but after what has passed, the rosary\r\ncould hardly fail to revive an odious recollection. My God, my God! I am\r\ndesperately wicked; can it be that you will pardon me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame,\" replied the doctor, \"I think you are mistaken about Mlle,\r\nd’Aubray. You may see by her letter what are her feelings towards you,\r\nand you must pray with this rosary up to the very end. Let not your\r\nprayers be interrupted or distracted, for no guilty penitent must cease\r\nfrom prayer; and I, madame, will engage to deliver the rosary where it\r\nwill be gladly received.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the marquise, who had been constantly distracted since the morning,\r\nwas now, thanks to the patient goodness of the doctor, able to return\r\nwith her former fervour to her prayers. She prayed till seven o’clock.\r\nAs the clock struck, the executioner without a word came and stood\r\nbefore her; she saw that her moment had come, and said to the doctor,\r\ngrasping his arm, \"A little longer; just a few moments, I entreat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame,\" said the doctor, rising, \"we will now adore the divine blood\r\nof the Sacrament, praying that you may be thus cleansed from all soil\r\nand sin that may be still in your heart. Thus shall you gain the respite\r\nyou desire.\"\r\n\r\nThe executioner then tied tight the cords round her hands that he had\r\nlet loose before, and she advanced pretty firmly and knelt before the\r\naltar, between the doctor and the chaplain. The latter was in his\r\nsurplice, and chanted a ’Veni Creator, Salve Regina, and Tantum ergo’.\r\nThese prayers over, he pronounced the blessing of the Holy Sacrament,\r\nwhile the marquise knelt with her face upon the ground. The executioner\r\nthen went forward to get ready a shirt, and she made her exit from the\r\nchapel, supported on the left by the doctor’s arm, on the right by the\r\nexecutioner’s assistant. Thus proceeding, she first felt embarrassment\r\nand confusion. Ten or twelve people were waiting outside, and as she\r\nsuddenly confronted them, she made a step backward, and with her hands,\r\nbound though they were, pulled the headdress down to cover half her\r\nface. She passed through a small door, which was closed behind her, and\r\nthen found herself between the two doors alone, with the doctor and the\r\nexecutioner’s man. Here the rosary, in consequence of her violent\r\nmovement to cover her face, came undone, and several beads fell on the\r\nfloor. She went on, however, without observing this; but the doctor\r\nstopped her, and he and the man stooped down and picked up all the\r\nbeads, which they put into her hand. Thanking them humbly for this\r\nattention, she said to the man, \"Sir, I know I have now no worldly\r\npossessions, that all I have upon me belongs to you, and I may not give\r\nanything away without your consent; but I ask you kindly to allow me to\r\ngive this chaplet to the doctor before I die: you will not be much the\r\nloser, for it is of no value, and I am giving it to him for my sister.\r\nKindly let me do this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame,\" said the man, \"it is the custom for us to get all the property\r\nof the condemned; but you are mistress of all you have, and if the thing\r\nwere of the very greatest value you might dispose of it as you pleased.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor, whose arm she held, felt her shiver at this gallantry, which\r\nfor her, with her natural haughty disposition, must have been the worst\r\nhumiliation imaginable; but the movement was restrained, and her face\r\ngave no sign. She now came to the porch of the Conciergerie, between the\r\ncourt and the first door, and there she was made to sit down, so as to\r\nbe put into the right condition for making the ’amende honorable’. Each\r\nstep brought her nearer to the scaffold, and so did each incident cause\r\nher more uneasiness. Now she turned round desperately, and perceived the\r\nexecutioner holding a shirt in his hand. The door of the vestibule\r\nopened, and about fifty people came in, among them the Countess of\r\nSoissons, Madame du Refuge, Mlle. de Scudery, M. de Roquelaure, and the\r\nAbbe de Chimay. At the sight the marquise reddened with shame, and\r\nturning to the doctor, said, \"Is this man to strip me again, as he did\r\nin the question chamber? All these preparations are very cruel; and, in\r\nspite of myself, they divert my thoughts, from God.\"\r\n\r\nLow as her voice was, the executioner heard, and reassured her, saying\r\nthat they would take nothing off, only putting the shirt over her other\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\nHe then approached, and the marquise, unable to speak to the doctor with\r\na man on each side of her, showed him by her looks how deeply she felt\r\nthe ignominy of her situation. Then, when the shirt had been put on, for\r\nwhich operation her hands had to be untied, the man raised the headdress\r\nwhich she had pulled down, and tied it round her neck, then fastened her\r\nhands together with one rope and put another round her waist, and yet\r\nanother round her neck; then, kneeling before her, he took off her shoes\r\nand stockings. Then she stretched out her hands to the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sir,\" she cried, \"in God’s name, you see what they have done to me!\r\nCome and comfort me.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor came at once, supporting her head upon his breast, trying to\r\ncomfort her; but she, in a tone of bitter lamentation, gazing at the\r\ncrowd, who devoured her with all their eyes, cried, \"Oh, sir, is not\r\nthis a strange, barbarous curiosity?\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame,\" said he, the tears in his eyes, \"do not look at these eager\r\npeople from the point of view of their curiosity and barbarity, though\r\nthat is real enough, but consider it part of the humiliation sent by God\r\nfor the expiation of your crimes. God, who was innocent, was subject to\r\nvery different opprobrium, and yet suffered all with joy; for, as\r\nTertullian observes, He was a victim fattened on the joys of suffering\r\nalone.\"\r\n\r\nAs the doctor spoke these words, the executioner placed in the\r\nmarquise’s hands the lighted torch which she was to carry to Notre-Dame,\r\nthere to make the ’amende honorable’, and as it was too heavy, weighing\r\ntwo pounds, the doctor supported it with his right hand, while the\r\nregistrar read her sentence aloud a second time. The doctor did all in\r\nhis power to prevent her from hearing this by speaking unceasingly of\r\nGod. Still she grew frightfully pale at the words, \"When this is done,\r\nshe shall be conveyed on a tumbril, barefoot, a cord round her neck,\r\nholding in her hands a burning torch two pounds in weight,\" and the\r\ndoctor could feel no doubt that in spite of his efforts she had heard.\r\nIt became still worse when she reached the threshold of the vestibule\r\nand saw the great crowd waiting in the court. Then her face worked\r\nconvulsively, and crouching down, as though she would bury her feet in\r\nthe earth, she addressed the doctor in words both plaintive and wild:\r\n\"Is it possible that, after what is now happening, M. de Brinvilliers\r\ncan endure to go on living?\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame,\" said the doctor, \"when our Lord was about to leave His\r\ndisciples, He did not ask God to remove them from this earth, but to\r\npreserve them from all sin. ’My Father,’ He said, ’I ask not that You\r\ntake them from the world, but keep them safe from evil.’ If, madame, you\r\npray for M. de Brinvilliers, let it be only that he may be kept in\r\ngrace, if he has it, and may attain to it if he has it not.\"\r\n\r\nBut the words were useless: at that moment the humiliation was too great\r\nand too public; her face contracted, her eyebrows knit, flames darted\r\nfrom her eyes, her mouth was all twisted. Her whole appearance was\r\nhorrible; the devil was once more in possession. During this paroxysm,\r\nwhich lasted nearly a quarter of an hour, Lebrun, who stood near, got\r\nsuch a vivid impression of her face that the following night he could\r\nnot sleep, and with the sight of it ever before his eyes made the fine\r\ndrawing which—is now in the Louvre, giving to the figure the head of a\r\ntiger, in order to show that the principal features were the same, and\r\nthe whole resemblance very striking.\r\n\r\nThe delay in progress was caused by the immense crowd blocking the\r\ncourt, only pushed aside by archers on horseback, who separated the\r\npeople. The marquise now went out, and the doctor, lest the sight of the\r\npeople should completely distract her, put a crucifix in her hand,\r\nbidding her fix her gaze upon it. This advice she followed till they\r\ngained the gate into the street where the tumbril was waiting; then she\r\nlifted her eyes to see the shameful object. It was one of the smallest\r\nof carts, still splashed with mud and marked by the stones it had\r\ncarried, with no seat, only a little straw at the bottom. It was drawn\r\nby a wretched horse, well matching the disgraceful conveyance.\r\n\r\nThe executioner bade her get in first, which she did very rapidly, as if\r\nto escape observation. There she crouched like a wild beast, in the left\r\ncorner, on the straw, riding backwards. The doctor sat beside her on the\r\nright. Then the executioner got in, shutting the door behind him, and\r\nsat opposite her, stretching his legs between the doctor’s. His man,\r\nwhose business it was to guide the horse, sat on the front, back to back\r\nwith the doctor and the marquise, his feet stuck out on the shafts. Thus\r\nit is easy to understand how Madame de Sevigne, who was on the Pont\r\nNotre-Dame, could see nothing but the headdress of the marquise as she\r\nwas driven to Notre-Dame.\r\n\r\nThe cortege had only gone a few steps, when the face of the marquise,\r\nfor a time a little calmer, was again convulsed. From her eyes, fixed\r\nconstantly on the crucifix, there darted a flaming glance, then came a\r\ntroubled and frenzied look which terrified the doctor. He knew she must\r\nhave been struck by something she saw, and, wishing to calm her, asked\r\nwhat it was.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, nothing,\" she replied quickly, looking towards him; \"it was\r\nnothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, madame,\" said he, \"you cannot give the lie to your own eyes; and a\r\nminute ago I saw a fire very different from the fire of love, which only\r\nsome displeasing sight can have provoked. What may this be? Tell me,\r\npray; for you promised to tell me of any sort of temptation that might\r\nassail you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" she said, \"I will do so, but it is nothing.\" Then, looking\r\ntowards the executioner, who, as we know, sat facing the doctor, she\r\nsaid, \"Put me in front of you, please; hide that man from me.\" And she\r\nstretched out her hands towards a man who was following the tumbril on\r\nhorseback, and so dropped the torch, which the doctor took, and the\r\ncrucifix, which fell on the floor. The executioner looked back, and then\r\nturned sideways as she wished, nodding and saying, \"Oh yes, I\r\nunderstand.\" The doctor pressed to know what it meant, and she said, \"It\r\nis nothing worth telling you, and it is a weakness in me not to be able\r\nto bear the sight of a man who has ill-used me. The man who touched the\r\nback of the tumbril is Desgrais, who arrested me at Liege, and treated\r\nme so badly all along the road. When I saw him, I could not control\r\nmyself, as you noticed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame,\" said the doctor, \"I have heard of him, and you yourself spoke\r\nof him in confession; but the man was sent to arrest you, and was in a\r\nresponsible position, so that he had to guard you closely and\r\nrigorously; even if he had been more severe, he would only have been\r\ncarrying out his orders. Jesus Christ, madame, could but have regarded\r\nHis executioners as ministers of iniquity, servants of injustice, who\r\nadded of their own accord every indignity they could think of; yet all\r\nalong the way He looked on them with patience and more than patience,\r\nand in His death He prayed for them.\"\r\n\r\nIn the heart of the marquise a hard struggle was passing, and this was\r\nreflected on her face; but it was only for a moment, and after a last\r\nconvulsive shudder she was again calm and serene; then she said:—\r\n\r\n\"Sir, you are right, and I am very wrong to feel such a fancy as this:\r\nmay God forgive me; and pray remember this fault on the scaffold, when\r\nyou give me the absolution you promise, that this too may be pardoned\r\nme.\" Then she turned to the executioner and said, \"Please sit where you\r\nwere before, that I may see M. Desgrais.\" The man hesitated, but on a\r\nsign from the doctor obeyed. The marquise looked fully at Desgrais for\r\nsome time, praying for him; then, fixing her eyes on the crucifix, began\r\nto pray for herself: this incident occurred in front of the church of\r\nSainte-Genevieve des Ardents.\r\n\r\nBut, slowly as it moved, the tumbril steadily advanced, and at last\r\nreached the place of Notre-Dame. The archers drove back the crowding\r\npeople, and the tumbril went up to the steps, and there stopped. The\r\nexecutioner got down, removed the board at the back, held out his arms\r\nto the marquise, and set her down on the pavement. The doctor then got\r\ndown, his legs quite numb from the cramped position he had been in since\r\nthey left the Conciergerie. He mounted the church steps and stood behind\r\nthe marquise, who herself stood on the square, with the registrar on her\r\nright, the executioner on her left, and a great crowd of people behind\r\nher, inside the church, all the doors being thrown open. She was made to\r\nkneel, and in her hands was placed the lighted torch, which up to that\r\ntime the doctor had helped to carry. Then the registrar read the ’amende\r\nhonorable’ from a written paper, and she began to say it after him, but\r\nin so low a voice that the executioner said loudly, \"Speak out as he\r\ndoes; repeat every word. Louder, louder!\" Then she raised her voice, and\r\nloudly and firmly recited the following apology.\r\n\r\n\"I confess that, wickedly and for revenge, I poisoned my father and my\r\nbrothers, and attempted to poison my sister, to obtain possession of\r\ntheir goods, and I ask pardon of God, of the king, and of my country’s\r\nlaws.\"\r\n\r\nThe ’amende honorable’ over, the executioner again carried her to the\r\ntumbril, not giving her the torch any more: the doctor sat beside her:\r\nall was just as before, and the tumbril went on towards La Greve. From\r\nthat moment, until she arrived at the scaffold, she never took her eyes\r\noff the crucifix, which the doctor held before her the whole time,\r\nexhorting her with religious words, trying to divert her attention from\r\nthe terrible noise which the people made around the car, a murmur\r\nmingled with curses.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the Place de Greve, the tumbril stopped at a little\r\ndistance from the scaffold. Then the registrar M. Drouet, came up on\r\nhorseback, and, addressing the marquise, said, \"Madame, have you nothing\r\nmore to say? If you wish to make any declaration, the twelve\r\ncommissaries are here at hand, ready to receive it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see, madame,\" said the doctor, \"we are now at the end of our\r\njourney, and, thank God, you have not lost your power of endurance on\r\nthe road; do not destroy the effect of all you have suffered and all you\r\nhave yet to suffer by concealing what you know, if perchance you do know\r\nmore than you have hitherto said.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have told all I know,\" said the marquise, \"and there is no more I can\r\nsay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Repeat these words in a loud voice,\" said the doctor, \"so that\r\neverybody may hear.\"\r\n\r\nThen in her loudest voice the marquise repeated—\r\n\r\n\"I have told all I know, and there is no more I can say.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this declaration, they were going to drive the tumbril nearer to\r\nthe scaffold, but the crowd was so dense that the assistant could not\r\nforce a way through, though he struck out on every side with his whip.\r\nSo they had to stop a few paces short. The executioner had already got\r\ndown, and was adjusting the ladder. In this terrible moment of waiting,\r\nthe marquise looked calmly and gratefully at the doctor, and when she\r\nfelt that the tumbril had stopped, said, \"Sir, it is not here we part:\r\nyou promised not to leave me till my head is cut off. I trust you will\r\nkeep your word.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure I will,\" the doctor replied; \"we shall not be separated\r\nbefore the moment of your death: be not troubled about that, for I will\r\nnever forsake you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I looked for this kindness,\" she said, \"and your promise was too solemn\r\nfor you to think for one moment of failing me. Please be on the scaffold\r\nand be near me. And now, sir, I would anticipate the final farewell,—for\r\nall the things I shall have to do on the scaffold may distract me,—so\r\nlet me thank you here. If I am prepared to suffer the sentence of my\r\nearthly judge, and to hear that of my heavenly judge, I owe it to your\r\ncare for me, and I am deeply grateful. I can only ask your forgiveness\r\nfor the trouble I have given you.\" Tears choked the doctor’s speech, and\r\nhe could not reply. \"Do you not forgive me?\" she repeated. At her words,\r\nthe doctor tried to reassure her; but feeling that if he opened his\r\nmouth he must needs break into sobs, he still kept silent. The marquise\r\nappealed to him a third time. \"I entreat you, sir, forgive me; and do\r\nnot regret the time you have passed with me. You will say a De Profundus\r\nat the moment of my death, and a mass far me to-morrow: will you not\r\npromise?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madame,\" said the doctor in a choking voice; \"yes, yes, be calm,\r\nand I will do all you bid me.\"\r\n\r\nThe executioner hereupon removed the board, and helped the marquise out\r\nof the tumbril; and as they advanced the few steps towards the scaffold,\r\nand all eyes were upon them, the doctor could hide his tears for a\r\nmoment without being observed. As he was drying his eyes, the assistant\r\ngave him his hand to help him down. Meanwhile the marquise was mounting\r\nthe ladder with the executioner, and when they reached the platform he\r\ntold her to kneel down in front of a block which lay across it. Then the\r\ndoctor, who had mounted with a step less firm than hers, came and knelt\r\nbeside her, but turned in the other direction, so that he might whisper\r\nin her ear—that is, the marquise faced the river, and the doctor faced\r\nthe Hotel de Ville. Scarcely had they taken their place thus when the\r\nman took down her hair and began cutting it at the back and at the\r\nsides, making her turn her head this way and that, at times rather\r\nroughly; but though this ghastly toilet lasted almost half an hour, she\r\nmade no complaint, nor gave any sign of pain but her silent tears. When\r\nher hair was cut, he tore open the top of the shirt, so as to uncover\r\nthe shoulders, and finally bandaged her eyes, and lifting her face by\r\nthe chin, ordered her to hold her head erect. She obeyed, unresisting,\r\nall the time listening to the doctor’s words and repeating them from\r\ntime to time, when they seemed suitable to her own condition. Meanwhile,\r\nat the back of the scaffold, on which the stake was placed, stood the\r\nexecutioner, glancing now and again at the folds of his cloak, where\r\nthere showed the hilt of a long, straight sabre, which he had carefully\r\nconcealed for fear Madame de Brinvilliers might see it when she mounted\r\nthe scaffold. When the doctor, having pronounced absolution, turned his\r\nhead and saw that the man was not yet armed, he uttered these prayers,\r\nwhich she repeated after him: \"Jesus, Son of David and Mary, have mercy\r\nupon me; Mary, daughter of David and Mother of Jesus, pray for me; my\r\nGod, I abandon my body, which is but dust, that men may burn it and do\r\nwith it what they please, in the firm faith that it shall one day arise\r\nand be reunited with my soul. I trouble not concerning my body; grant, O\r\nGod, that I yield up to Thee my soul, that it may enter into Thy rest;\r\nreceive it into Thy bosom; that it may dwell once more there, whence it\r\nfirst descended; from Thee it came, to Thee returns; Thou art the source\r\nand the beginning; be thou, O God, the centre and the end!\"\r\n\r\nThe marquise had said these words when suddenly the doctor heard a dull\r\nstroke like the sound of a chopper chopping meat upon a block: at that\r\nmoment she ceased to speak. The blade had sped so quickly that the\r\ndoctor had not even seen a flash. He stopped, his hair bristling, his\r\nbrow bathed in sweat; for, not seeing the head fall, he supposed that\r\nthe executioner had missed the mark and must needs start afresh. But his\r\nfear was short-lived, for almost at the same moment the head inclined to\r\nthe left, slid on to the shoulder, and thence backward, while the body\r\nfell forward on the crossway block, supported so that the spectators\r\ncould see the neck cut open and bleeding. Immediately, in fulfilment of\r\nhis promise, the doctor said a De Profundis.\r\n\r\nWhen the prayer was done and the doctor raised his head, he saw before\r\nhim the executioner wiping his face. \"Well, sir,\" said he, \"was not that\r\na good stroke? I always put up a prayer on these occasions, and God has\r\nalways assisted me; but I have been anxious for several days about this\r\nlady. I had six masses said, and I felt strengthened in hand and heart.\"\r\nHe then pulled out a bottle from under his cloak, and drank a dram; and\r\ntaking the body under one arm, all dressed as it was, and the head in\r\nhis other hand, the eyes still bandaged, he threw both upon the faggots,\r\nwhich his assistant lighted.\r\n\r\n\"The next day,\" says Madame de Sevigne, \"people were looking for the\r\ncharred bones of Madame de Brinvilliers, because they said she was a\r\nsaint.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1814, M. d’Offemont, father of the present occupier of the castle\r\nwhere the Marquise de Brinvilliers poisoned her father, frightened at\r\nthe approach of all the allied troops, contrived in one of the towers\r\nseveral hiding-places, where he shut up his silver and such other\r\nvaluables as were to be found in this lonely country in the midst of the\r\nforest of Laigue. The foreign troops were passing backwards and forwards\r\nat Offemont, and after a three months’ occupation retired to the farther\r\nside of the frontier.\r\n\r\nThen the owners ventured to take out the various things that had been\r\nhidden; and tapping the walls, to make sure nothing had been overlooked,\r\nthey detected a hollow sound that indicated the presence of some\r\nunsuspected cavity. With picks and bars they broke the wall open, and\r\nwhen several stones had come out they found a large closet like a\r\nlaboratory, containing furnaces, chemical instruments, phials\r\nhermetically sealed full of an unknown liquid, and four packets of\r\npowders of different colours. Unluckily, the people who made these\r\ndiscoveries thought them of too much or too little importance; and\r\ninstead of submitting the ingredients to the tests of modern science,\r\nthey made away with them all, frightened at their probably deadly\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nThus was lost this great opportunity—probably the last—for finding and\r\nanalysing the substances which composed the poisons of Sainte-Croix and\r\nMadame de Brinvilliers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*VANINKA*\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the end of the reign of the Emperor Paul I—that is to say, towards\r\nthe middle of the first year of the nineteenth century—just as four\r\no’clock in the afternoon was sounding from the church of St. Peter and\r\nSt. Paul, whose gilded vane overlooks the ramparts of the fortress, a\r\ncrowd, composed of all sorts and conditions of people, began to gather\r\nin front of a house which belonged to General Count Tchermayloff,\r\nformerly military governor of a fair-sized town in the government of\r\nPultava. The first spectators had been attracted by the preparations\r\nwhich they saw had been made in the middle of the courtyard for\r\nadministering torture with the knout. One of the general’s serfs, he who\r\nacted as barber, was to be the victim.\r\n\r\nAlthough this kind of punishment was a common enough sight in St.\r\nPetersburg, it nevertheless attracted all passers-by when it was\r\npublicly administered. This was the occurrence which had caused a crowd,\r\nas just mentioned, before General Tchermayloff’s house.\r\n\r\nThe spectators, even had they been in a hurry, would have had no cause\r\nto complain of being kept waiting, for at half-past four a young man of\r\nabout five-and-twenty, in the handsome uniform of an aide-de-camp, his\r\nbreast covered with decorations, appeared on the steps at the farther\r\nend of the court-yard in front of the house. These steps faced the large\r\ngateway, and led to the general’s apartments.\r\n\r\nArrived on the steps, the young aide-de-camp stopped a moment and fixed\r\nhis eyes on a window, the closely drawn curtains of which did not allow\r\nhim the least chance of satisfying his curiosity, whatever may have been\r\nits cause. Seeing that it was useless and that he was only wasting time\r\nin gazing in that direction, he made a sign to a bearded man who was\r\nstanding near a door which led to the servants’ quarters. The door was\r\nimmediately opened, and the culprit was seen advancing in the middle of\r\na body of serfs and followed by the executioner. The serfs were forced\r\nto attend the spectacle, that it might serve as an example to them. The\r\nculprit was the general’s barber, as we have said, and the executioner\r\nwas merely the coachman, who, being used to the handling of a whip, was\r\nraised or degraded, which you will, to the office of executioner every\r\ntime punishment with the knout was ordered. This duty did not deprive\r\nhim of either the esteem or even the friendship of his comrades, for\r\nthey well knew that it was his arm alone that punished them and that his\r\nheart was not in his work. As Ivan’s arm as well as the rest of his body\r\nwas the property of the general, and the latter could do as he pleased\r\nwith it, no one was astonished that it should be used for this purpose.\r\nMore than that, correction administered by Ivan was nearly always\r\ngentler than that meted out by another; for it often happened that Ivan,\r\nwho was a good-natured fellow, juggled away one or two strokes of the\r\nknout in a dozen, or if he were forced by those assisting at the\r\npunishment to keep a strict calculation, he manoeuvred so that the tip\r\nof the lash struck the deal plank on which the culprit was lying, thus\r\ntaking much of the sting out of the stroke. Accordingly, when it was\r\nIvan’s turn to be stretched upon the fatal plank and to receive the\r\ncorrection he was in the habit of administering, on his own account,\r\nthose who momentarily played his part as executioner adopted the same\r\nexpedients, remembering only the strokes spared and not the strokes\r\nreceived. This exchange of mutual benefits, therefore, was productive of\r\nan excellent understanding between Ivan and his comrades, which was\r\nnever so firmly knit as at the moment when a fresh execution was about\r\nto take place. It is true that the first hour after the punishment was\r\ngenerally so full of suffering that the knouted was sometimes unjust to\r\nthe knouter, but this feeling seldom out-lasted the evening, and it was\r\nrare when it held out after the first glass of spirits that the operator\r\ndrank to the health of his patient.\r\n\r\nThe serf upon whom Ivan was about to exercise his dexterity was a man of\r\nfive or six-and-thirty, red of hair and beard, a little above average\r\nheight. His Greek origin might be traced in his countenance, which even\r\nin its expression of terror had preserved its habitual characteristics\r\nof craft and cunning.\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived at the spot where the punishment was to take place, the\r\nculprit stopped and looked up at the window which had already claimed\r\nthe young aide-de-camp’s attention; it still remained shut. With a\r\nglance round the throng which obstructed the entrance leading to the\r\nstreet, he ended by gazing, with a horror-stricken shudder upon the\r\nplank on which he was to be stretched. The shudder did not escape his\r\nfriend Ivan, who, approaching to remove the striped shirt that covered\r\nhis shoulders, took the opportunity to whisper under his breath—\r\n\r\n\"Come, Gregory, take courage!\"\r\n\r\n\"You remember your promise?\" replied the culprit, with an indefinable\r\nexpression of entreaty.\r\n\r\n\"Not for the first lashes, Gregory; do not count on that, for during the\r\nfirst strokes the aide-de-camp will be watching; but among the later\r\nones be assured I will find means of cheating him of some of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Beyond everything you will take care of the tip of the lash?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do my best, Gregory, I will do my best. Do you not know that I\r\nwill?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! yes,\" replied Gregory.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then!\" said the aide-de-camp.\r\n\r\n\"We are ready, noble sir,\" replied Ivan.\r\n\r\n\"Wait, wait one moment, your high origin,\" cried poor Gregory,\r\naddressing the young captain as though he had been a colonel, \"Vache\r\nVousso Korodie,\" in order to flatter him. \"I believe that the lady\r\nVaninka’s window is about to open!\"\r\n\r\nThe young captain glanced eagerly towards the spot which had already\r\nseveral times claimed his attention, but not a fold of the silken\r\ncurtains, which could be seen through the panes of the window, had\r\nmoved.\r\n\r\n\"You are mistaken, you rascal,\" said the aide-de-camp, unwillingly\r\nremoving his eyes from the window, as though he also had hoped to see it\r\nopen, \"you are mistaken; and besides, what has your noble mistress to do\r\nwith all this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon, your excellency,\" continued Gregory, gratifying the\r\naide-de-camp with yet higher rank,—\"pardon, but it is through her orders\r\nI am about to suffer. Perhaps she might have pity upon a wretched\r\nservant!\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough, enough; let us proceed,\" said the captain in an odd voice, as\r\nthough he regretted as well as the culprit that Vaninka had not shown\r\nmercy.\r\n\r\n\"Immediately, immediately, noble sir,\" said Ivan; then turning to\r\nGregory, he continued, \"Come, comrade; the time has come.\"\r\n\r\nGregory sighed heavily, threw a last look up at the window, and seeing\r\nthat everything remained the same there, he mustered up resolution\r\nenough to lie down on the fatal plank. At the same time two other serfs,\r\nchosen by Ivan for assistants, took him by the arms and attached his\r\nwrists to two stakes, one at either side of him, so that it appeared as\r\nthough he were stretched on a cross. Then they clamped his neck into an\r\niron collar, and seeing that all was in readiness and that no sign\r\nfavourable to the culprit had been made from the still closely shut\r\nwindow, the young aide-de-camp beckoned with his hand, saying, \"Now,\r\nthen, begin!\"\r\n\r\n\"Patience, my lord, patience,\" said Ivan, still delaying the whipping,\r\nin the hope that some sign might yet be made from the inexorable window.\r\n\"I have a knot in my knout, and if I leave it Gregory will have good\r\nright to complain.\"\r\n\r\nThe instrument with which the executioner was busying himself, and which\r\nis perhaps unknown to our readers, was a species of whip, with a handle\r\nabout two feet long. A plaited leather thong, about four feet long and\r\ntwo inches broad, was attached to this handle, this thong terminating in\r\nan iron or copper ring, and to this another band of leather was\r\nfastened, two feet long, and at the beginning about one and a half\r\ninches thick: this gradually became thinner, till it ended in a point.\r\nThe thong was steeped in milk and then dried in the sun, and on account\r\nof this method of preparation its edge became as keen and cutting as a\r\nknife; further, the thong was generally changed at every sixth stroke,\r\nbecause contact with blood softened it.\r\n\r\nHowever unwillingly and clumsily Ivan set about untying the knot, it had\r\nto come undone at last. Besides, the bystanders were beginning to\r\ngrumble, and their muttering disturbed the reverie into which the young\r\naide-de-camp had fallen. He raised his head, which had been sunk on his\r\nbreast, and cast a last look towards the window; then with a peremptory\r\nsign; and in a voice which admitted of no delay, he ordered the\r\nexecution to proceed.\r\n\r\nNothing could put it off any longer: Ivan was obliged to obey, and he\r\ndid not attempt to find any new pretext for delay. He drew back two\r\npaces, and with a spring he returned to his place, and standing on\r\ntiptoe, he whirled the knout above his head, and then letting it\r\nsuddenly fall, he struck Gregory with such dexterity that the lash\r\nwrapped itself thrice round his victim’s body, encircling him like a\r\nserpent, but the tip of the thong struck the plank upon which Gregory\r\nwas lying. Nevertheless, in spite of this precaution, Gregory uttered a\r\nloud shriek, and Ivan counted \"One.\"\r\n\r\nAt the shriek, the young aide-de-camp again turned towards the window;\r\nbut it was still shut, and mechanically his eyes went back to the\r\nculprit, and he repeated the word \"One.\"\r\n\r\nThe knout had traced three blue furrows on Gregory’s shoulders. Ivan\r\ntook another spring, and with the same skill as before he again\r\nenveloped the culprit’s body with the hissing thong, ever taking care\r\nthat the tip of it should not touch him. Gregory uttered another shriek,\r\nand Ivan counted \"Two.\" The blood now began to colour the skin.\r\n\r\nAt the third stroke several drops of blood appeared; at the fourth the\r\nblood spurted out; at the fifth some drops spattered the young officer’s\r\nface; he drew back, and wiped them away with his handkerchief. Ivan\r\nprofited by his distraction, and counted seven instead of six: the\r\ncaptain took no notice. At the ninth stroke Ivan stopped to change the\r\nlash, and in the hope that a second fraud might pass off as luckily as\r\nthe first, he counted eleven instead of ten.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a window opposite to Vaninka’s opened, and a man about\r\nforty-five or fifty in general’s uniform appeared. He called out in a\r\ncareless tone, \"Enough, that will do,\" and closed the window again.\r\n\r\nImmediately on this apparition the young aide-de-camp had turned towards\r\nhis general, saluting, and during the few seconds that the general was\r\npresent he remained motionless. When the window had been shut again, he\r\nrepeated the general’s words, so that the raised whip fell without\r\ntouching the culprit.\r\n\r\n\"Thank his excellency, Gregory,\" said Ivan, rolling the knout’s lash\r\nround his hand, \"for having spared you two strokes;\" and he added,\r\nbending down to liberate Gregory’s hand, \"these two with the two I was\r\nable to miss out make a total of eight strokes instead of twelve. Come,\r\nnow, you others, untie his other hand.\"\r\n\r\nBut poor Gregory was in no state to thank anybody; nearly swooning with\r\npain, he could scarcely stand.\r\n\r\nTwo moujiks took him by the arms and led him towards the serfs’\r\nquarters, followed by Ivan. Having reached the door, however, Gregory\r\nstopped, turned his head, and seeing the aide-de-camp gazing pitifully\r\nat him, \"Oh sir,\" he cried, \"please thank his excellency the general for\r\nme. As for the lady Vaninka,\" he added in a low tone, \"I will certainly\r\nthank her myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you muttering between your teeth?\" cried the young officer,\r\nwith an angry movement; for he thought he had detected a threatening\r\ntone in Gregory’s voice.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, sir, nothing,\" said Ivan. \"The poor fellow is merely thanking\r\nyou, Mr. Foedor, for the trouble you have taken in being present at his\r\npunishment, and he says that he has been much honoured, that is all.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is right,\" said the young man, suspecting that Ivan had somewhat\r\naltered the original remarks, but evidently not wishing to be better\r\ninformed. \"If Gregory wishes to spare me this trouble another time, let\r\nhim drink less vodka; or else, if he must get drunk, let him at least\r\nremember to be more respectful.\"\r\n\r\nIvan bowed low and followed his comrades, Foedor entered the house\r\nagain, and the crowd dispersed, much dissatisfied that Ivan’s trickery\r\nand the general’s generosity had deprived them of four strokes of the\r\nknout—exactly a third of the punishment.\r\n\r\nNow that we have introduced our readers to some of the characters in\r\nthis history, we must make them better acquainted with those who have\r\nmade their appearance, and must introduce those who are still behind the\r\ncurtain.\r\n\r\nGeneral Count Tchermayloff, as we have said, after having been governor\r\nof one of the most important towns in the environs of Pultava, had been\r\nrecalled to St. Petersburg by the Emperor Paul, who honoured him with\r\nhis particular friendship. The general was a widower, with one daughter,\r\nwho had inherited her mother’s fortune, beauty, and pride. Vaninka’s\r\nmother claimed descent from one of the chieftains of the Tartar race,\r\nwho had invaded Russia, under the leadership of D’Gengis, in the\r\nthirteenth century. Vaninka’s naturally haughty disposition had been\r\nfostered by the education she had received. His wife being dead, and not\r\nhaving time to look after his daughter’s education himself, General\r\nTchermayloff had procured an English governess for her. This lady,\r\ninstead of suppressing her pupil’s scornful propensities, had encouraged\r\nthem, by filling her head with those aristocratic ideas which have made\r\nthe English aristocracy the proudest in the world. Amongst the different\r\nstudies to which Vaninka devoted herself, there was one in which she was\r\nspecially interested, and that one was, if one may so call it, the\r\nscience of her own rank. She knew exactly the relative degree of\r\nnobility and power of all the Russian noble families—those that were a\r\ngrade above her own, and those of whom she took precedence. She could\r\ngive each person the title which belonged to their respective rank, no\r\neasy thing to do in Russia, and she had the greatest contempt for all\r\nthose who were below the rank of excellency. As for serfs and slaves,\r\nfor her they did not exist: they were mere bearded animals, far below\r\nher horse or her dog in the sentiments which they inspired in her; and\r\nshe would not for one instant have weighed the life of a serf against\r\neither of those interesting animals.\r\n\r\nLike all the women of distinction in her nation, Vaninka was a good\r\nmusician, and spoke French, Italian, German, and English equally well.\r\n\r\nHer features had developed in harmony with her character. Vaninka was\r\nbeautiful, but her beauty was perhaps a little too decided. Her large\r\nblack eyes, straight nose, and lips curling scornfully at the corners,\r\nimpressed those who saw her for the first time somewhat unpleasantly.\r\nThis impression soon wore off with her superiors and equals, to whom she\r\nbecame merely an ordinary charming woman, whilst to subalterns and such\r\nlike she remained haughty and inaccessible as a goddess. At seventeen\r\nVaninka’s education was finished, and her governess who had suffered in\r\nhealth through the severe climate of St. Petersburg, requested\r\npermission to leave. This desire was granted with the ostentatious\r\nrecognition of which the Russian nobility are the last representatives\r\nin Europe. Thus Vaninka was left alone, with nothing but her father’s\r\nblind adoration to direct her. She was his only daughter, as we have\r\nmentioned, and he thought her absolutely perfect.\r\n\r\nThings were in this state in the-general’s house when he received a\r\nletter, written on the deathbed of one of the friends of his youth.\r\nCount Romayloff had been exiled to his estates, as a result of some\r\nquarrel with Potemkin, and his career had been spoilt. Not being able to\r\nrecover his forfeited position, he had settled down about four hundred\r\nleagues from St. Petersburg; broken-hearted, distressed probably less on\r\naccount of his own exile and misfortune than of the prospects of his\r\nonly son, Foedor. The count feeling that he was leaving this son alone\r\nand friendless in the world, commended the young man, in the name of\r\ntheir early friendship, to the general, hoping that, owing to his being\r\na favourite with Paul I, he would be able to procure a lieutenancy in a\r\nregiment for him. The general immediately replied to the count that his\r\nson should find a second father in himself; but when this comforting\r\nmessage arrived, Romayloff was no more, and Foedor himself received the\r\nletter and carried it back with him to the general, when he went to tell\r\nhim of his loss and to claim the promised protection. So great was the\r\ngeneral’s despatch, that Paul I, at his request, granted the young man a\r\nsub-lieutenancy in the Semonowskoi regiment, so that Foedor entered on\r\nhis duties the very next day after his arrival in St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nAlthough the young man had only passed through the general’s house on\r\nhis way to the barracks, which were situated in the Litenoi quarter, he\r\nhad remained there long enough for him to have seen Vaninka, and she had\r\nproduced a great impression upon him. Foedor had arrived with his heart\r\nfull of primitive and noble feelings; his gratitude to his protector,\r\nwho had opened a career for him, was profound, and extended to all his\r\nfamily. These feelings caused him perhaps to have an exaggerated idea of\r\nthe beauty of the young girl who was presented to him as a sister, and\r\nwho, in spite of this title, received him with the frigidity and hauteur\r\nof a queen. Nevertheless, her appearance, in spite of her cool and\r\nfreezing manner, had left a lasting impression upon the young man’s\r\nheart, and his arrival in St. Petersburg had been marked by feelings\r\ntill then never experienced before in his life.\r\n\r\nAs for Vaninka, she had hardly noticed Foedor; for what was a young\r\nsub-lieutenant, without fortune or prospects, to her? What she dreamed\r\nof was some princely alliance, that would make her one of the most\r\npowerful ladies in Russia, and unless he could realise some dream of the\r\nArabian Nights, Foedor could not offer her such a future.\r\n\r\nSome time after this first interview, Foedor came to take leave of the\r\ngeneral. His regiment was to form part of a contingent that\r\nField-Marshal Souvarow was taking to Italy, and Foedor was about to die,\r\nor show himself worthy of the noble patron who had helped him to a\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\nThis time, whether on account of the elegant uniform that heightened\r\nFoedor’s natural good looks, or because his imminent departure, glowing\r\nwith hope and enthusiasm, lent a romantic interest to the young man,\r\nVaninka was astonished at the marvellous change in him, and deigned, at\r\nher father’s request, to give him her hand when he left. This was more\r\nthan Foedor had dared to hope. He dropped upon his knee, as though in\r\nthe presence of a queen, and took Vaninka’s between his own trembling\r\nhands, scarcely daring to touch it with his lips. Light though the kiss\r\nhad been, Vaninka started as though she had been burnt; she felt a\r\nthrill run through her, and she blushed violently. She withdrew her hand\r\nso quickly, that Foedor, fearing this adieu, respectful though it was,\r\nhad offended her, remained on his knees, and clasping his hands, raised\r\nhis eyes with such an expression of fear in them, that Vaninka,\r\nforgetting her hauteur, reassured him with a smile. Foedor rose, his\r\nheart filled with inexplicable joy, and without being able to say what\r\nhad caused this feeling, he only knew that it had made him absolutely\r\nhappy, so that, although he was just about to leave Vaninka, he had\r\nnever felt greater happiness in his life.\r\n\r\nThe young man left dreaming golden dreams; for his future, be it gloomy\r\nor bright, was to be envied. If it ended in a soldier’s grave, he\r\nbelieved he had seen in Vaninka’s eyes that she would mourn him; if his\r\nfuture was glorious, glory would bring him back to St. Petersburg in\r\ntriumph, and glory is a queen, who works miracles for her favourites.\r\n\r\nThe army to which the young officer belonged crossed Germany, descended\r\ninto Italy by the Tyrolese mountains, and entered Verona on the 14th of\r\nApril 1799. Souvarow immediately joined forces with General Melas, and\r\ntook command of the two armies. General Chasteler next day suggested\r\nthat they should reconnoitre. Souvarow, gazing at him with astonishment,\r\nreplied, \"I know of no other way of reconnoitring the enemy than by\r\nmarching upon him and giving him battle.\"\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact Souvarow was accustomed to this expeditious sort of\r\nstrategy: through it he had defeated the Turks at Folkschany and\r\nIsmailoff; and he had defeated the Poles, after a few days’ campaign,\r\nand had taken Prague in less than four hours. Catherine, out of\r\ngratitude, had sent her victorious general a wreath of oak-leaves,\r\nintertwined with precious stones, and worth six hundred thousand\r\nroubles, a heavy gold field-marshal’s baton encrusted with diamonds; and\r\nhad created him a field-marshal, with the right of choosing a regiment\r\nthat should bear his name from that time forward. Besides, when he\r\nreturned to Russia, she gave him leave of absence, that he might take a\r\nholiday at a beautiful estate she had given him, together with the eight\r\nthousand serfs who lived upon it.\r\n\r\nWhat a splendid example for Foedor! Souvarow, the son of a humble\r\nRussian officer, had been educated at the ordinary cadets’ training\r\ncollege, and had left it as a sub-lieutenant like himself. Why should\r\nthere not be two Souvarows in the same century?\r\n\r\nSouvarow arrived in Italy preceded by an immense reputation; religious,\r\nstrenuous, unwearied, impossible, loving with the simplicity of a Tartar\r\nand fighting with the fury of a Cossack, he was just the man required to\r\ncontinue General Melas’s successes over the soldiers of the Republic,\r\ndiscouraged as they had been by the weak vacillations of Scherer.\r\n\r\nThe Austro-Russian army of one hundred thousand men was opposed by only\r\ntwenty-nine or thirty thousand French. Souvarow began as usual with a\r\nthundering blow. On 20th April he appeared before Brescia, which made a\r\nvain attempt at resistance; after a cannonade of about half an hour’s\r\nduration, the Preschiera gate was forced, and the Korsakow division, of\r\nwhich Foedor’s regiment formed the vanguard, charged into the town,\r\npursuing the garrison, which only consisted of twelve hundred men, and\r\nobliged them to take refuge in the citadel. Pressed with an impetuosity\r\nthe French were not accustomed to find in their enemies, and seeing that\r\nthe scaling ladders were already in position against the ramparts, the\r\ncaptain Boucret wished to come to terms; but his position was too\r\nprecarious for him to obtain any conditions from his savage conquerors,\r\nand he and his soldiers were made prisoners of war.\r\n\r\nSouvarow was experienced enough to know how best to profit by victory;\r\nhardly master of Brescia, the rapid occupation of which had discouraged\r\nour army anew, he ordered General Kray to vigorously press on the siege\r\nof Preschiera. General Kray therefore established his headquarters at\r\nValeggio, a place situated at an equal distance between Preschiera and\r\nMantua, and he extended from the Po to the lake of Garda, on the banks\r\nof the Mencio, thus investing the two cities at the same time.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the commander-in-chief had advanced, accompanied by the larger\r\npart of his forces, and had crossed the Oglio in two columns: he\r\nlaunched one column, under General Rosenberg, towards Bergamo, and the\r\nother, with General Melas in charge, towards the Serio, whilst a body of\r\nseven or eight thousand men, commanded by General Kaim and General\r\nHohenzollern, were directed towards Placentia and Cremona, thus\r\noccupying the whole of the left bank of the Po, in such a manner that\r\nthe Austro-Russian army advanced deploying eighty thousand men along a\r\nfront of forty-five miles.\r\n\r\nIn view of the forces which were advancing, and which were three times\r\nas large as his own, Scherer beat a retreat all along the line. He\r\ndestroyed the bridges over the Adda, as he did not consider that he was\r\nstrong enough to hold them, and, having removed his headquarters to\r\nMilan, he awaited there the reply to a despatch which he had sent to the\r\nDirectory, in which, tacitly acknowledging his incapacity, he tendered\r\nhis resignation. As the arrival of his successor was delayed, and as\r\nSouvarow continued to advance, Scherer, more and more terrified by the\r\nresponsibility which rested upon him, relinquished his command into the\r\nhands of his most able lieutenant. The general chosen by him was Moreau,\r\nwho was again about to fight those Russians in whose ranks he was\r\ndestined to die at last.\r\n\r\nMoreau’s unexpected nomination was proclaimed amidst the acclamation of\r\nthe soldiers. He had been called the French Fabius, on account of his\r\nmagnificent campaign on the Rhine. He passed his whole army in review,\r\nsaluted by the successive acclamations of its different divisions, which\r\ncried, \"Long live Moreau! Long live the saviour of the army of Italy!\"\r\nBut however great this enthusiasm, it did not blind Moreau to the\r\nterrible position in which he found himself. At the risk of being\r\nout-flanked, it was necessary for him to present a parallel line to that\r\nof the Russian army, so that, in order to face his enemy, he was obliged\r\nto extend his line from Lake Lecco to Pizzighitone—that is to say, a\r\ndistance of fifty miles. It is true that he might have retired towards\r\nPiedmont and concentrated his troops at Alexandria, to await there the\r\nreinforcements the Directory had promised to send him. But if he had\r\ndone this, he would have compromised the safety of the army at Naples,\r\nand have abandoned it, isolated as it was, to the mercy of the enemy. He\r\ntherefore resolved to defend the passage of the Adda as long as\r\npossible, in order to give the division under Dessolles, which was to be\r\ndespatched to him by Massena, time to join forces with him and to defend\r\nhis left, whilst Gauthier, who had received orders to evacuate Tuscany\r\nand to hasten with forced marches to his aid, should have time to arrive\r\nand protect his right. Moreau himself took the centre, and personally\r\ndefended the fortified bridge of Cassano; this bridge was protected by\r\nthe Ritorto Canal, and he also defended it with a great deal of\r\nartillery and an entrenched vanguard. Besides, Moreau, always as prudent\r\nas brave, took every precaution to secure a retreat, in case of\r\ndisaster, towards the Apennines and the coast of Genoa. Hardly were his\r\ndispositions completed before the indefatigable Souvarow entered\r\nTriveglio. At the same time as the Russian commander-in-chief arrived at\r\nthis last town, Moreau heard of the surrender of Bergamo and its castle,\r\nand on 23rd April he saw the heads of the columns of the allied army.\r\n\r\nThe same day the Russian general divided his troops into three strong\r\ncolumns, corresponding to the three principal points in the French line,\r\neach column numerically more than double the strength of those to whom\r\nthey were opposed. The right column, led by General Wukassowich,\r\nadvanced towards Lake Lecco, where General Serrurier awaited it. The\r\nleft column, under the command of Melas, took up its position in front\r\nof the Cassano entrenchments; and the Austrian division, under Generals\r\nZopf and Ott, which formed the centre, concentrated at Canonia, ready at\r\na given moment to seize Vaprio. The Russian and Austrian troops\r\nbivouacked within cannon-shot of the French outposts.\r\n\r\nThat evening, Foedor, who with his regiment formed part of Chasteler’s\r\ndivision, wrote to General Tchermayloff:\r\n\r\n\"We are at last opposite the French, and a great battle must take place\r\nto-morrow morning; tomorrow evening I shall be a lieutenant or a\r\ncorpse.\"\r\n\r\nNext morning, 26th April, cannon resounded at break of day from the\r\nextremities of the lines; on our left Prince Bagration’s grenadiers\r\nattacked us, on our right General Seckendorff, who had been detached\r\nfrom the camp of Triveglio, was marching on Crema.\r\n\r\nThese two attacks met with very different success. Bagration’s\r\ngrenadiers were repulsed with terrible loss, whilst Seckendorff, on the\r\ncontrary, drove the French out of Crema, and pushed forward towards the\r\nbridge of Lodi. Foedor’s predictions were falsified: his portion of the\r\narmy did nothing the whole day; his regiment remained motionless,\r\nwaiting for orders that did not come.\r\n\r\nSouvarow’s arrangements were not yet quite complete, the night was\r\nneeded for him to finish them. During the night, Moreau, having heard of\r\nSeckendorff’s success on his extreme right, sent an order to Serrurier\r\ncommanding him to leave at Lecco, which was an easy post to defend, the\r\n18th light brigade and a detachment of dragoons only, and to draw back\r\nwith the rest of his troops towards the centre. Serrurier received this\r\norder about two o’clock in the morning, and executed it immediately.\r\n\r\nOn their side the Russians had lost no time, profiting by the darkness\r\nof the night. General Wukassowich had repaired the bridge at Brevio,\r\nwhich had been destroyed by the French, whilst General Chasteler had\r\nbuilt another bridge two miles below the castle of Trezzo. These two\r\nbridges had been, the one repaired and the other built, without the\r\nFrench outposts having the slightest suspicion of what was taking place.\r\n\r\nSurprised at two o’clock in the morning by two Austrian divisions,\r\nwhich, concealed by the village of San Gervasio, had reached the right\r\nbank of the Adda without their being discovered, the soldiers defending\r\nthe castle of Trezzo abandoned it and beat a retreat. The Austrians\r\npursued them as far as Pozzo, but there the French suddenly halted and\r\nfaced about, for General Serrurier was at Pozzo, with the troops he had\r\nbrought from Lecco. He heard the cannonade behind him, immediately\r\nhalted, and, obeying the first law of warfare, he marched towards the\r\nnoise and smoke. It was therefore through him that the garrison of\r\nTrezzo rallied and resumed the offensive. Serrurier sent an aide-de-Camp\r\nto Moreau to inform him of the manoeuvre he had thought proper to\r\nexecute.\r\n\r\nThe battle between the French and Austrian troops raged with incredible\r\nfury. Bonaparte’s veterans, during their first Italian campaigns, had\r\nadopted a custom which they could not renounce: it was to fight His\r\nImperial Majesty’s subjects wherever they found them. Nevertheless, so\r\ngreat was the numerical superiority of the allies, that our troops had\r\nbegun to retreat, when loud shouts from the rearguard announced that\r\nreinforcements had arrived. It was General Grenier, sent by Moreau, who\r\narrived with his division at the moment when his presence was most\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nOne part of the new division reinforced the centre column, doubling its\r\nsize; another part was extended upon the left to envelop the enemy. The\r\ndrums beat afresh down the whole line, and our grenadiers began again to\r\nreconquer this battle field already twice lost and won. But at this\r\nmoment the Austrians were reinforced by the Marquis de Chasteler and his\r\ndivision, so that the numerical superiority was again with the enemy.\r\nGrenier drew back his wing to strengthen the centre, and Serrurier,\r\npreparing for retreat in case of disaster, fell back on Pozzo, where he\r\nawaited the enemy. It was here that the battle raged most fiercely:\r\nthrice the village of Pozzo was taken and re-taken, until at last,\r\nattacked for the fourth time by a force double their own in numbers, the\r\nFrench were obliged to evacuate it. In this last attack an Austrian\r\ncolonel was mortally wounded, but, on the other hand, General Beker, who\r\ncommanded the French rearguard, refused to retreat with his soldiers,\r\nand maintained his ground with a few men, who were slain as they stood;\r\nhe was at length obliged to give up his sword to a young Russian officer\r\nof the Semenofskoi regiment, who, handing over his prisoner to his own\r\nsoldiers, returned immediately to the combat.\r\n\r\nThe two French generals had fixed on the village of Vaprio as a\r\nrallying-place, but at the moment when our troops were thrown into\r\ndisorder through the evacuation of Pozzo, the Austrian cavalry charged\r\nheavily, and Serrurier, finding himself separated from his colleague,\r\nwas obliged to retire with two thousand five hundred men to Verderio,\r\nwhilst Grenier, having reached the appointed place, Vaprio, halted to\r\nface the enemy afresh.\r\n\r\nDuring this time a terrible fight was taking place in the centre. Melas\r\nwith eighteen to twenty thousand men had attacked the fortified posts at\r\nthe head of the bridge of Cassano and the Ritorto Canal. About seven\r\no’clock in the morning, when Moreau had weakened himself by despatching\r\nGrenier and his division, Melas, leading three battalions of Austrian\r\ngrenadiers, had attacked the fortifications, and for two hours there was\r\nterrible carnage; thrice repulsed, and leaving more than fifteen hundred\r\nmen at the base of the fortifications, the Austrians had thrice returned\r\nto the attack, each time being reinforced by fresh troops, always led on\r\nand encouraged by Melas, who had to avenge his former defeats. At\r\nlength, having been attacked for the fourth time, forced from their\r\nentrenchments, and contesting the ground inch by inch, the French took\r\nshelter behind their second fortifications, which defended the entrance\r\nto the bridge itself: here they were commanded by Moreau in person.\r\nThere, for two more hours, a hand-to-hand struggle took place, whilst\r\nthe terrible artillery belched forth death almost muzzle to muzzle. At\r\nlast the Austrians, rallying for a last time, advanced at the point of\r\nthe bayonet, and; lacking either ladders or fascines, piled the bodies\r\nof their dead comrades against the fortifications, and succeeded in\r\nscaling the breastworks. There was not a moment to be lost. Moreau\r\nordered a retreat, and whilst the French were recrossing the Adda, he\r\nprotected their passage in person with a single battalion of grenadiers,\r\nof whom at the end of half an hour not more than a hundred and twenty\r\nmen remained; three of his aides-de-camp were killed at his side. This\r\nretreat was accomplished without disorder, and then Moreau himself\r\nretired, still fighting the enemy, who set foot on the bridge as soon as\r\nhe reached the other bank. The Austrians immediately rushed forward to\r\ncapture him, when suddenly a terrible noise was heard rising above the\r\nroar of the artillery; the second arch of the bridge was blown into the\r\nair, carrying with it all those who were standing on the fatal spot. The\r\narmies recoiled, and into the empty space between them fell like rain a\r\ndebris of stones and human beings. But at this moment, when Moreau had\r\nsucceeded in putting a momentary obstacle between himself and Melas,\r\nGeneral Grenier’s division arrived in disorder, after having been forced\r\nto evacuate Vaprio, pursued by the Austro-Russians under Zopf, Ott, and\r\nChasteler. Moreau ordered a change of front, and faced this new enemy,\r\nwho fell upon him when he least expected them; he succeeded in rallying\r\nGrenier’s troops and in re-establishing the battle. But whilst his back\r\nwas turned Melas repaired the bridge and crossed the river; thus Moreau\r\nfound himself attacked frontally, in the rear, and on his two flanks, by\r\nforces three times larger than his own. It was then that all the\r\nofficers who surrounded him begged him to retreat, for on the\r\npreservation of his person depended the preservation of Italy for\r\nFrance. Moreau refused for some time, for he knew the awful consequences\r\nof the battle he had just lost, and he did not wish to survive it,\r\nalthough it had been impossible for him to win it. At last a chosen band\r\nsurrounded him, and, forming a square, drew back, whilst the rest of the\r\narmy sacrificed themselves to cover his retreat; for Moreau’s genius was\r\nlooked upon as the sole hope that remained to them.\r\n\r\nThe battle lasted nearly three hours longer, during which the rearguard\r\nof the army performed prodigies of valour. At length Melas, seeing that\r\nthe enemy had escaped him, and believing that his troops, tired by the\r\nstubborn fight, needed rest, gave orders that the fighting should cease.\r\nHe halted on the left bank of the Adda, encamping his army in the\r\nvillages of Imago, Gorgonzola, and Cassano, and remained master of the\r\nbattlefield, upon which we had left two thousand five hundred dead, one\r\nhundred pieces of cannon, and twenty howitzers.\r\n\r\nThat night Souvarow invited General Becker to supper with him, and asked\r\nhim by whom he had been taken prisoner. Becker replied that it was a\r\nyoung officer belonging to the regiment which had first entered Pozzo.\r\nSouvarow immediately inquired what regiment this was, and discovered\r\nthat it was the Semenofskoi; he then ordered that inquiries should be\r\nmade to ascertain the young officer’s name. Shortly afterwards\r\nSub-Lieutenant Foedor Romayloff was announced. He presented General\r\nBecker’s sword to Souvarow, who invited him to remain and to have supper\r\nwith his prisoner.\r\n\r\nNext day Foedor wrote to his protector: \"I have kept my word. I am a\r\nlieutenant, and Field-Marshal Souvarow has requested his Majesty Paul I\r\nto bestow upon me the order of Saint Vladimir.\"\r\n\r\nOn 28th of April, Souvarow entered Milan, which Moreau had just\r\nabandoned in order to retreat beyond Tesino. The following proclamation\r\nwas by his order posted on all the walls of the capital; it admirably\r\npaints the spirit of the Muscovite:\r\n\r\n\"The victorious army of the Apostolical and Roman Emperor is here; it\r\nhas fought solely for the restoration of the Holy Faith,—the clergy,\r\nnobility, and ancient government of Italy. People, join us for God and\r\nthe Faith, for we have arrived with an army at Milan and Placentia to\r\nassist you!\"\r\n\r\nThe dearly bought victories of Trebia and Novi succeeded that of\r\nCassano, and left Souvarow so much weakened that he was unable to profit\r\nby them. Besides, just when the Russian general was about to resume his\r\nmarch, a new plan of campaign arrived, sent by the Aulic Council at\r\nVienna. The Allied Powers had decided upon the invasion of France, and\r\nhad fixed the route each general must follow in order to accomplish this\r\nnew project. It was decided that Souvarow should invade France by\r\nSwitzerland, and that the arch-duke should yield him his positions and\r\ndescend on the Lower Rhine.\r\n\r\nThe troops with which Souvarow was to operate against Massena from this\r\ntime were the thirty thousand Russians he had with him, thirty thousand\r\nothers detached from the reserve army commanded by Count Tolstoy in\r\nGalicia, who were to be led to join him in Switzerland by General\r\nKorsakoff, about thirty thousand Austrians under General Hotze, and\r\nlastly, five or six thousand French emigrants under the Prince de Conde\r\nin all, an army of ninety or ninety-five thousand men. The Austrians\r\nwere to oppose Moreau and Macdonald.\r\n\r\nFoedor had been wounded when entering Novi, but Souvarow had rewarded\r\nhim with a second cross, and the rank of captain hastened his\r\nconvalescence, so that the young officer, more happy than proud of the\r\nnew rank he had received, was in a condition to follow the army, when on\r\n13th September it moved towards Salvedra and entered the valley of\r\nTesino.\r\n\r\nSo far all had gone well, and as long as they remained in the rich and\r\nbeautiful Italian plains, Suovarow had nothing but praise for the\r\ncourage and devotion of his soldiers. But when to the fertile fields of\r\nLombardy, watered by its beautiful river, succeeded the rough ways of\r\nthe Levantine, and when the lofty summits of the St. Gothard, covered\r\nwith the eternal snows, rose before them, their enthusiasm was quenched,\r\ntheir energy disappeared, and melancholy forebodings filled the hearts\r\nof these savage children of the North.\r\n\r\nUnexpected grumblings ran through the ranks; then suddenly the vanguard\r\nstopped, and declared that it would go no farther. In vain Foedor, who\r\ncommanded a company, begged and entreated his own men to set an example\r\nby continuing the march: they threw down their arms, and lay down beside\r\nthem. Just as they had given this proof of insubordination, fresh\r\nmurmurs, sounding like an approaching storm, rose from the rear of the\r\narmy: they were caused by the sight of Souvarow, who was riding from the\r\nrear to the vanguard, and who arrived at the front accompanied by this\r\nterrible proof of mutiny and insubordination. When he reached the head\r\nof the column, the murmurings had developed into imprecations.\r\n\r\nThen Souvarow addressed his soldiers with that savage eloquence to which\r\nhe owed the miracles he had effected with them, but cries of \"Retreat!\r\nRetreat!\" drowned his voice. Then he chose out the most mutinous, and\r\nhad them thrashed until they were overcome by this shameful punishment:\r\nBut the thrashings had no more influence than the exhortation, and the\r\nshouts continued. Souvarow saw that all was lost if he did not employ\r\nsome powerful and unexpected means of regaining the mutineers. He\r\nadvanced towards Foedor. \"Captain,\" said he, \"leave these fools here,\r\ntake eight non-commissioned officers and dig a grave.\" Foedor,\r\nastonished, gazed at his general as though demanding an explanation of\r\nthis strange order. \"Obey orders,\" said Souvarow.\r\n\r\nFoedor obeyed, and the eight men set to work; and ten minutes later the\r\ngrave was dug, greatly to the astonishment of the whole army, which had\r\ngathered in a semicircle on the rising slopes of the two hills which\r\nbordered the road, standing as if on the steps of a huge amphitheatre.\r\n\r\nSouvarow dismounted from his horse, broke his sword in two and threw it\r\ninto the grave, detached his epaulets one by one and threw them after\r\nhis sword, dragged off the decorations which covered his breast and cast\r\nthese after the sword and epaulets, and then, stripping himself naked,\r\nhe lay down in the grave himself, crying in a loud voice—\r\n\r\n\"Cover me with earth! Leave your general here. You are no longer my\r\nchildren, and I am no longer your father; nothing remains to me but\r\ndeath.\"\r\n\r\nAt these strange words, which were uttered in so powerful a voice that\r\nthey were heard by the whole army, the Russian grenadiers threw\r\nthemselves weeping into the grave, and, raising their general, asked\r\npardon of him, entreating him to lead them again against the enemy.\r\n\r\n\"At last,\" cried Souvarow, \"I recognise my children again. To the\r\nenemy!\"\r\n\r\nNot cries but yells of joy greeted his words. Souvarav dressed himself\r\nagain, and whilst he was dressing the leaders of the mutiny crept in the\r\ndust to kiss his feet. Then, when his epaulets were replaced on his\r\nshoulders, and when his decorations again shone on his breast, he\r\nremounted his horse, followed by the army, the soldiers swearing with\r\none voice that they would all die rather than abandon their father.\r\n\r\nThe same day Souvarow attacked Aerolo; but his luck had turned: the\r\nconqueror of Cassano, Trebia, and Novi had left his good-fortune behind\r\nin the plains of Italy. For twelve hours six hundred French opposed\r\nthree thousand Russian grenadiers beneath the walls of the town, and so\r\nsuccessfully that night fell without Souvarow being able to defeat them.\r\nNext day he marched the whole of his troops against this handful of\r\nbrave men, but the sky clouded over and the wind blew a bitter rain into\r\nthe faces of the Russians; the French profited by this circumstance to\r\nbeat a retreat, evacuating the valley of Ursern, crossing the Reuss, and\r\ntaking up their position on the heights of the Furka and Grimsel. One\r\nportion of the Russian army’s design had been achieved, they were\r\nmasters of the St. Gothard. It is true that as soon as they marched\r\nfarther on, the French would retake it and cut off their retreat; but\r\nwhat did this matter to Souvarow? Did he not always march forward?\r\n\r\nHe marched on, then, without worrying about that which was behind him,\r\nreached Andermatt, cleared Trou d’Ury, and found Lecourbe guarding the\r\ndefile of the Devil’s Bridge with fifteen hundred men. There the\r\nstruggle began again; for three days fifteen hundred Frenchmen kept\r\nthirty thousand Russians at bay. Souvarow raged like a lion trapped in a\r\nsnare, for he could not understand this change of fortune. At last, on\r\nthe fourth day, he heard that General Korsakoff, who had preceded him\r\nand who was to rejoin him later, had been beaten by Molitor, and that\r\nMassena had recaptured Zurich and occupied the canton of Glaris.\r\nSouvarow now gave up the attempt to proceed up the valley of the Reuss,\r\nand wrote to Korsakoff and Jallachieh, \"I hasten to retrieve your\r\nlosses; stand firm as ramparts: you shall answer to me with your heads\r\nfor every step in retreat that you take.\" The aide-de-camp was also\r\ncharged to communicate to the Russian and Austrian generals a verbal\r\nplan of battle. Generals Linsken and Jallachieh were to attack the\r\nFrench troops separately and then to join the forces in the valley of\r\nGlaris, into which Souvarow himself was to descend by the Klon-Thal,\r\nthus hemming Molitor in between two walls of iron.\r\n\r\nSouvarow was so sure that this plan would be successful, that when he\r\narrived on the borders of the lake of Klon-Thal, he sent a bearer with a\r\nflag of truce, summoning Molitor to surrender, seeing that he was\r\nsurrounded on every side.\r\n\r\nMolitor replied, to the field-marshal that his proposed meeting with his\r\ngenerals had failed, as he had beaten them one after the other, and\r\ndriven them back into the Grisons, and that moreover, in retaliation, as\r\nMassena was advancing by Muotta, it was he, Souvarow, who was between\r\ntwo fires, and therefore he called upon him to lay down his arms\r\ninstead.\r\n\r\nOn hearing this strange reply, Souvarow thought that he must be\r\ndreaming, but soon recovering himself and realising the danger of his\r\nposition in the defiles, he threw himself on General Molitor, who\r\nreceived him at the point of the bayonet, and then closing up the pass\r\nwith twelve hundred men, the French succeeded in holding fifteen to\r\neighteen thousand Russians in check for eight hours. At length night\r\ncame, and Molitor evacuated the Klon Thal, and retired towards the\r\nLinth, to defend the bridges of Noefels and Mollis.\r\n\r\nThe old field-marshal rushed like a torrent over Glaris and Miltodi;\r\nthere he learnt that Molitor had told him the truth, and that Jallachieh\r\nand Linsken had been beaten and dispersed, that Massena was advancing on\r\nSchwitz, and that General Rosenberg, who had been given the defence of\r\nthe bridge of Muotta, had been forced to retreat, so that he found\r\nhimself in the position in which he had hoped to place Molitor.\r\n\r\nNo time was to be lost in retreating. Souvarow hurried through the\r\npasses of Engi, Schwauden, and Elm. His flight was so hurried that he\r\nwas obliged to abandon his wounded and part of his artillery.\r\nImmediately the French rushed in pursuit among the precipices and\r\nclouds. One saw whole armies passing over places where chamois-hunters\r\ntook off their shoes and walked barefoot, holding on by their hands to\r\nprevent themselves from falling. Three nations had come from three\r\ndifferent parts to a meeting-place in the home of the eagles, as if to\r\nallow those nearest God to judge the justice of their cause. There were\r\ntimes when the frozen mountains changed into volcanoes, when cascades\r\nnow filled with blood fell into the valleys, and avalanches of human\r\nbeings rolled down the deepest precipices. Death reaped such a harvest\r\nthere where human life had never been before, that the vultures,\r\nbecoming fastidious through the abundance, picked out only the eyes of\r\nthe corpses to carry to their young—at least so says the tradition of\r\nthe peasants of these mountains.\r\n\r\nSouvarow was able to rally his troops at length in the neighbourhood of\r\nLindau. He recalled Korsakoff, who still occupied Bregenz; but all his\r\ntroops together did not number more than thirty thousand men-all that\r\nremained of the eighty thousand whom Paul had furnished as his\r\ncontingent in the coalition. In fifteen days Massena had defeated three\r\nseparate armies, each numerically stronger than his own. Souvarow,\r\nfurious at having been defeated by these same Republicans whom he had\r\nsworn to exterminate, blamed the Austrians for his defeat, and declared\r\nthat he awaited orders from his emperor, to whom he had made known the\r\ntreachery of the allies, before attempting anything further with the\r\ncoalition.\r\n\r\nPaul’s answer was that he should immediately return to Russia with his\r\nsoldiers, arriving at St. Petersburg as soon as possible, where a\r\ntriumphal entry awaited them.\r\n\r\nThe same ukase declared that Souvarow should be quartered in the\r\nimperial palace for the rest of his life, and lastly that a monument\r\nshould be raised to him in one of the public places of St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nFoedor was thus about to see Vaninka once more. Throughout the campaign,\r\nwhere there was a chance of danger, whether in the plains of Italy, in\r\nthe defiles of Tesino, or on the glaciers of Mount Pragal, he was the\r\nfirst to throw himself into it, and his name had frequently been\r\nmentioned as worthy of distinction. Souvarow was too brave himself to be\r\nprodigal of honours where they were not merited. Foedor was returning,\r\nas he had promised, worthy of his noble protector’s friendship, and who\r\nknows, perhaps worthy of Vaninka’s love. Field-Marshal Souvarow had made\r\na friend of him, and none could know to what this friendship might not\r\nlead; for Paul honoured Souvarow like one of the ancient heroes.\r\n\r\nBut no one could rely upon Paul, for his character was made up of\r\nextreme impulses. Without having done anything to offend his master, and\r\nwithout knowing the cause of his disgrace, Souvarow, on arriving at\r\nRiga, received a private letter which informed him, in the emperor’s\r\nname, that, having tolerated an infraction of the laws of discipline\r\namong his soldiers, the emperor deprived him of all the honours with\r\nwhich he had been invested, and also forbade him to appear before him.\r\n\r\nSuch tidings fell like a thunderbolt upon the old warrior, already\r\nembittered by his reverses: he was heart-broken that such storm-clouds\r\nshould tarnish the end of his glorious day.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this order, he assembled all his officers in the\r\nmarket-place of Riga, and took leave of them sorrowfully, like a father\r\ntaking leave of his family. Having embraced the generals and colonels,\r\nand having shaken hands with the others, he said good-bye to them once\r\nmore, and left them free to continue their march to their destination.\r\n\r\nSouvarow took a sledge, and, travelling night and day, arrived incognito\r\nin the capital, which he was to have entered in triumph, and was driven\r\nto a distant suburb, to the house of one of his nieces, where he died of\r\na broken heart fifteen days afterwards.\r\n\r\nOn his own account, Foedor travelled almost as rapidly as his general,\r\nand entered St. Petersburg without having sent any letter to announce\r\nhis arrival. As he had no parent in the capital, and as his entire\r\nexistence was concentrated in one person, he drove direct to the\r\ngeneral’s house, which was situated in the Prospect of Niewski, at an\r\nangle of the Catherine Canal.\r\n\r\nHaving arrived there, he sprang out of his carriage, entered the\r\ncourtyard, and bounded up the steps. He opened the ante-chamber door,\r\nand precipitated himself into the midst of the servants and subordinate\r\nhousehold officers. They cried out with surprise upon seeing him: he\r\nasked them where the general was; they replied by pointing to the door\r\nof the dining-room; he was in there, breakfasting with his daughter.\r\n\r\nThen, through a strange reaction, Foedor felt his knees failing him, and\r\nhe was obliged to lean against a wall to prevent himself from falling.\r\nAt this moment, when he was about to see Vaninka again, this soul of his\r\nsoul, for whom alone he had done so much, he dreaded lest he should not\r\nfind her the same as when he had left her. Suddenly the dining-room door\r\nopened, and Vaninka appeared. Seeing the young man, she uttered a cry,\r\nand, turning to the general, said, \"Father, it is Foedor\"; and the\r\nexpression of her voice left no doubt of the sentiment which inspired\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"Foedor!\" cried the general, springing forward and holding out his arms.\r\n\r\nFoedor did not know whether to throw himself at the feet of Vaninka or\r\ninto the arms of her father. He felt that his first recognition ought to\r\nbe devoted to respect and gratitude, and threw himself into the\r\ngeneral’s arms. Had he acted otherwise, it would have been an avowal of\r\nhis love, and he had no right to avow this love till he knew that it was\r\nreciprocated.\r\n\r\nFoedor then turned, and as at parting, sank on his knee before Vaninka;\r\nbut a moment had sufficed for the haughty girl to banish the feeling she\r\nhad shown. The blush which had suffused her cheek had disappeared, and\r\nshe had become again cold and haughty like an alabaster statue-a\r\nmasterpiece of pride begun by nature and finished by education. Foedor\r\nkissed her hand; it was trembling but cold he felt his heart sink, and\r\nthought he was about to die.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Vaninka,\" said the general—\"why are you so cool to a friend who\r\nhas caused us so much anxiety and yet so much pleasure? Come, Fordor,\r\nkiss my daughter.\"\r\n\r\nFoedor rose entreatingly, but waited motionless, that another permission\r\nmight confirm that of the general.\r\n\r\n\"Did you not hear my father?\" said Vaninka, smiling, but nevertheless\r\npossessing sufficient self-control to prevent the emotion she was\r\nfeeling from appearing in her voice.\r\n\r\nFoedor stooped to kiss Vaninka, and as he held her hands it seemed to\r\nhim that she lightly pressed his own with a nervous, involuntary\r\nmovement. A feeble cry of joy nearly escaped him, when, suddenly looking\r\nat Vaninka, he was astonished at her pallor: her lips were as white as\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe general made Foedor sit down at the table: Vaninka took her place\r\nagain, and as by chance she was seated with her back to the light, the\r\ngeneral noticed nothing.\r\n\r\nBreakfast passed in relating and listening to an account of this strange\r\ncampaign which began under the burning sun of Italy and ended in the\r\nglaciers of Switzerland. As there are no journals in St. Petersburg\r\nwhich publish anything other than that which is permitted by the\r\nemperor, Souvarow’s successes were spread abroad, but his reverses were\r\nignored. Foedor described the former with modesty and the latter with\r\nfrankness.\r\n\r\nOne can imagine, the immense interest the general took in Foedor’s\r\nstory. His two captain’s epaulets and the decorations on his breast\r\nproved that the young man had modestly suppressed his own part in the\r\nstory he had told. But the general, too courageous to fear that he might\r\nshare in Souvarow’s disgrace, had already visited the dying\r\nfield-marshal, and had heard from him an account of his young protege’s\r\nbravery. Therefore, when Foedor had finished his story, it was the\r\ngeneral’s turn to enumerate all the fine things Foedor had done in a\r\ncampaign of less than a year. Having finished this enumeration, he added\r\nthat he intended next day to ask the emperor’s permission to take the\r\nyoung captain for his aide-de-camp. Foedor hearing this wished to throw\r\nhimself at the general’s feet, but he received him again in his arms,\r\nand to show Foedor how certain he was that he would be successful in his\r\nrequest, he fixed the rooms that the young man was to occupy in the\r\nhouse at once.\r\n\r\nThe next day the general returned from the palace of St. Michel with the\r\npleasant news that his request had been granted.\r\n\r\nFoedor was overwhelmed with joy: from this time he was to form part of\r\nthe general’s family. Living under the same roof as Vaninka, seeing her\r\nconstantly, meeting her frequently in the rooms, seeing her pass like an\r\napparition at the end of a corridor, finding himself twice a day at the\r\nsame table with her, all this was more than Foedor had ever dared hope,\r\nand he thought for a time that he had attained complete happiness.\r\n\r\nFor her part, Vaninka, although she was so proud, at the bottom of her\r\nheart took a keen interest in Foedor. He had left her with the certainty\r\nthat he loved her, and during his absence her woman’s pride had been\r\ngratified by the glory he had acquired, in the hope of bridging the\r\ndistance which separated them. So that, when she saw him return with\r\nthis distance between them lessened, she felt by the beating of her\r\nheart that gratified pride was changing into a more tender sentiment,\r\nand that for her part she loved Foedor as much as it was possible for\r\nher to love anyone.\r\n\r\nShe had nevertheless concealed these feelings under an appearance of\r\nhaughty indifference, for Vaninka was made so: she intended to let\r\nFoedor know some day that she loved him, but until the time came when it\r\npleased her to reveal it, she did not wish the young man to discover her\r\nlove. Things went on in this way for several months, and the\r\ncircumstances which had at first appeared to Foedor as the height of\r\nhappiness soon became awful torture.\r\n\r\nTo love and to feel his heart ever on the point of avowing its love, to\r\nbe from morning till night in the company of the beloved one, to meet\r\nher hand at the table, to touch her dress in a narrow corridor, to feel\r\nher leaning on his arm when they entered a salon or left a ballroom,\r\nalways to have ceaselessly to control every word, look, or movement\r\nwhich might betray his feelings, no human power could endure such a\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\nVaninka saw that Foedor could not keep his secret much longer, and\r\ndetermined to anticipate the avowal which she saw every moment on the\r\npoint of escaping his heart.\r\n\r\nOne day when they were alone, and she saw the hopeless efforts the young\r\nman was making to hide his feelings from her, she went straight up to\r\nhim, and, looking at him fixedly, said:\r\n\r\n\"You love me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me, forgive me,\" cried the young man, clasping his hands.\r\n\r\n\"Why should you ask me to forgive you, Foedor? Is not your love\r\ngenuine?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, genuine but hopeless.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why hopeless? Does not my father love you as a son?\" said Vaninka.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what do you mean?\" cried Foedor. \"Do you mean that if your father\r\nwill bestow your hand upon me, that you will then consent—?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you not both noble in heart and by birth, Foedor? You are not\r\nwealthy, it is true, but then I am rich enough for both.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I am not indifferent to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I at least prefer you to anyone else I have met.\"\r\n\r\n\"Vaninka!\" The young girl drew herself away proudly.\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me!\" said Foedor. \"What am I doing? You have but to order: I\r\nhave no wish apart from you. I dread lest I shall offend you. Tell me\r\nwhat to do, and I will obey.\"\r\n\r\n\"The first thing you must do, Foedor, is to ask my father’s consent.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you will allow me to take this step?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but on one condition.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it? Tell me.\"\r\n\r\n\"My father, whatever his answer, must never know that I have consented\r\nto your making this application to him; no one must know that you are\r\nfollowing my instructions; the world must remain ignorant of the\r\nconfession I have just made to you; and, lastly, you must not ask me,\r\nwhatever happens, to help you in any other way than with my good\r\nwishes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever you please. I will do everything you wish me to do. Do you not\r\ngrant me a thousand times more than I dared hope, and if your father\r\nrefuses me, do I not know myself that you are sharing my grief?\" cried\r\nFoedor.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but that will not happen, I hope,\" said Vaninka, holding out her\r\nhand to the young officer, who kissed it passionately.\r\n\r\n\"Now be hopeful and take courage;\" and Vaninka retired, leaving the\r\nyoung man a hundred times more agitated and moved than she was herself,\r\nwoman though she was.\r\n\r\nThe same day Foedor asked for an interview with the general. The general\r\nreceived his aide-de-camp as usual with a genial and smiling\r\ncountenance, but with the first words Foedor uttered his face darkened.\r\nHowever, when he heard the young man’s description of the love, so true,\r\nconstant, and passionate, that he felt for Vaninka, and when he heard\r\nthat this passion had been the motive power of those glorious deeds he\r\nhad praised so often, he held out his hand to Foedor, almost as moved as\r\nthe young soldier.\r\n\r\nAnd then the general told him, that while he had been away, and ignorant\r\nof his love for Vaninka, in whom he had observed no trace of its being\r\nreciprocated, he had, at the emperor’s desire, promised her hand to the\r\nson of a privy councillor. The only stipulation that the general had\r\nmade was, that he should not be separated from his daughter until she\r\nhad attained the age of eighteen. Vaninka had only five months more to\r\nspend under her father’s roof. Nothing more could be said: in Russia the\r\nemperor’s wish is an order, and from the moment that it is expressed, no\r\nsubject would oppose it, even in thought. However, the refusal had\r\nimprinted such despair on the young man’s face, that the general,\r\ntouched by his silent and resigned sorrow, held out his arms to him.\r\nFoedor flung himself into them with loud sobs.\r\n\r\nThen the general questioned him about his daughter, and Foedor answered,\r\nas he had promised, that Vaninka was ignorant of everything, and that\r\nthe proposal came from him alone, without her knowledge. This assurance\r\ncalmed the general: he had feared that he was making two people\r\nwretched.\r\n\r\nAt dinner-time Vaninka came downstairs and found her father alone.\r\nFoedor had not enough courage to be present at the meal and to meet her\r\nagain, just when he had lost all hope: he had taken a sleigh, and driven\r\nout to the outskirts of the city.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole time dinner lasted Vaninka and the general hardly\r\nexchanged a word, but although this silence was so expressive, Vaninka\r\ncontrolled her face with her usual power, and the general alone appeared\r\nsad and dejected.\r\n\r\nThat evening, just when Vaninka was going downstairs, tea was brought to\r\nher room, with the message that the general was fatigued and had\r\nretired. Vaninka asked some questions about the nature of his\r\nindisposition, and finding that it was not serious, she told the servant\r\nwho had brought her the message to ask her father to send for her if he\r\nwanted anything. The general sent to say that he thanked her, but he\r\nonly required quiet and rest. Vaninka announced that she would retire\r\nalso, and the servant withdrew.\r\n\r\nHardly had he left the room when Vaninka ordered Annouschka, her\r\nfoster-sister, who acted as her maid, to be on the watch for Foedor’s\r\nreturn, and to let her know as soon as he came in.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o’clock the gate of the mansion opened: Foedor got out of his\r\nsleigh, and immediately went up to his room. He threw himself upon a\r\nsofa, overwhelmed by his thoughts. About midnight he heard someone\r\ntapping at the door: much astonished, he got up and opened it. It was\r\nAnnouschka, who came with a message from her mistress, that Vaninka\r\nwished to see him immediately. Although he was astonished at this\r\nmessage, which he was far from expecting, Foedor obeyed.\r\n\r\nHe found Vaninka seated, dressed in a white robe, and as she was paler\r\nthan usual he stopped at the door, for it seemed to him that he was\r\ngazing at a marble statue.\r\n\r\n\"Come in,\" said Vaninka calmly.\r\n\r\nFoedor approached, drawn by her voice like steel to a magnet. Annouschka\r\nshut the door behind him.\r\n\r\n\"Well, and what did my father say?\" said Vaninka.\r\n\r\nFoedor told her all that had happened. The young girl listened to his\r\nstory with an unmoved countenance, but her lips, the only part of her\r\nface which seemed to have any colour, became as white as the\r\ndressing-gown she was wearing. Foedor, on the contrary, was consumed by\r\na fever, and appeared nearly out of his senses.\r\n\r\n\"Now, what do you intend to do?\" said Vaninka in the same cold tone in\r\nwhich she had asked the other questions.\r\n\r\n\"You ask me what I intend to do, Vaninka? What do you wish me to do?\r\nWhat can I do, but flee from St. Petersburg, and seek death in the first\r\ncorner of Russia where war may break out, in order not to repay my\r\npatron’s kindness by some infamous baseness?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a fool,\" said Vaninka, with a mixed smile of triumph and\r\ncontempt; for from that moment she felt her superiority over Foedor, and\r\nsaw that she would rule him like a queen for the rest of her life.\r\n\r\n\"Then order me—am I not your slave?\" cried the young soldier.\r\n\r\n\"You must stay here,\" said Vaninka.\r\n\r\n\"Stay here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; only women and children will thus confess themselves beaten at the\r\nfirst blow: a man, if he be worthy of the name, fights.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fight!—against whom?—against your father? Never!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who suggested that you should contend against my father? It is against\r\nevents that you must strive; for the generality of men do not govern\r\nevents, but are carried away by them. Appear to my father as though you\r\nwere fighting against your love, and he will think that you have\r\nmastered yourself. As I am supposed to be ignorant of your proposal, I\r\nshall not be suspected. I will demand two years’ more freedom, and I\r\nshall obtain them. Who knows what may happen in the course of two years?\r\nThe emperor may die, my betrothed may die, my father—may God protect\r\nhim!—my father himself may die—!\"\r\n\r\n\"But if they force you to marry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Force me!\" interrupted Vaninka, and a deep flush rose to her cheek and\r\nimmediately disappeared again. \"And who will force me to do anything?\r\nFather? He loves me too well. The emperor? He has enough worries in his\r\nown family, without introducing them into another’s. Besides, there is\r\nalways a last resource when every other expedient fails: the Neva only\r\nflows a few paces from here, and its waters are deep.\"\r\n\r\nFoedor uttered a cry, for in the young girl’s knit brows and tightly\r\ncompressed lips there was so much resolution that he understood that\r\nthey might break this child but that they would not bend her. But\r\nFoedor’s heart was too much in harmony with the plan Vaninka had\r\nproposed; his objections once removed, he did not seek fresh ones.\r\nBesides, had he had the courage to do so; Vaninka’s promise to make up\r\nin secret to him for the dissimulation she was obliged to practise in\r\npublic would have conquered his last scruples.\r\n\r\nVaninka, whose determined character had been accentuated by her\r\neducation, had an unbounded influence over all who came in contact with\r\nher; even the general, without knowing why, obeyed her. Foedor submitted\r\nlike a child to everything she wished, and the young girl’s love was\r\nincreased by the wishes she opposed and by a feeling of gratified pride.\r\n\r\nIt was some days after this nocturnal decision that the knouting had\r\ntaken place at which our readers have assisted. It was for some slight\r\nfault, and Gregory had been the victim; Vaninka having complained to her\r\nfather about him. Foedor, who as aide-de-camp had been obliged to\r\npreside over Gregory’s punishment, had paid no more attention to the\r\nthreats the serf had uttered on retiring.\r\n\r\nIvan, the coachman, who after having been executioner had become\r\nsurgeon, had applied compresses of salt and water to heal up the scarred\r\nshoulders of his victim. Gregory had remained three days in the\r\ninfirmary, and during this time he had turned over in his mind every\r\npossible means of vengeance. Then at the end of three days, being\r\nhealed, he had returned to his duty, and soon everyone except he had\r\nforgotten the punishment. If Gregory had been a real Russian, he would\r\nsoon have forgotten it all; for this punishment is too familiar to the\r\nrough Muscovite for him to remember it long and with rancour. Gregory,\r\nas we have said, had Greek blood in his veins; he dissembled and\r\nremembered. Although Gregory was a serf, his duties had little by little\r\nbrought him into greater familiarity with the general than any of the\r\nother servants. Besides, in every country in the world barbers have\r\ngreat licence with those they shave; this is perhaps due to the fact\r\nthat a man is instinctively more gracious to another who for ten minutes\r\nevery day holds his life in his hands. Gregory rejoiced in the immunity\r\nof his profession, and it nearly always happened that the barber’s daily\r\noperation on the general’s chin passed in conversation, of which he bore\r\nthe chief part.\r\n\r\nOne day the general had to attend a review: he sent for Gregory before\r\ndaybreak, and as the barber was passing the razor as gently as possible\r\nover his master’s cheek, the conversation fell, or more likely was led,\r\non Foedor. The barber praised him highly, and this naturally caused his\r\nmaster to ask him, remembering the correction the young aide-decamp had\r\nsuperintended, if he could not find some fault in this model of\r\nperfection that might counterbalance so many good qualities. Gregory\r\nreplied that with the exception of pride he thought Foedor\r\nirreproachable.\r\n\r\n\"Pride?\" asked the astonished general. \"That is a failing from which I\r\nshould have thought him most free.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I should have said ambition,\" replied Gregory.\r\n\r\n\"Ambition!\" said the general. \"It does not seem to me that he has given\r\nmuch proof of ambition in entering my service; for after his\r\nachievements in the last campaign he might easily have aspired to the\r\nhonour of a place in the emperor’s household.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, he is ambitious,\" said Gregory, smiling. \"One man’s ambition is\r\nfor high position, another’s an illustrious alliance: the former will\r\nowe everything to himself, the latter will make a stepping-stone of his\r\nwife, then they raise their eyes higher than they should.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean to suggest?\" said the general, beginning to see what\r\nGregory was aiming at.\r\n\r\n\"I mean, your excellency,\" replied Gregory, \"there are many men who,\r\nowing to the kindness shown them by others, forget their position and\r\naspire to a more exalted one; having already been placed so high, their\r\nheads are turned.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gregory,\" cried the general, \"believe me, you are getting into a\r\nscrape; for you are making an accusation, and if I take any notice of\r\nit, you will have to prove your words.\"\r\n\r\n\"By St. Basilius, general, it is no scrape when you have truth on your\r\nside; for I have said nothing I am not ready to prove.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said the general, \"you persist in declaring that Foedor loves my\r\ndaughter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! I have not said that: it is your excellency. I have not named the\r\nlady Vaninka,\" said Gregory, with the duplicity of his nation.\r\n\r\n\"But you meant it, did you not? Come, contrary to your custom, reply\r\nfrankly.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true, your excellency; it is what I meant.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, according to you, my daughter reciprocates the passion, no doubt?\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear so, your excellency.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what makes you think this, say?\"\r\n\r\n\"First, Mr. Foedor never misses a chance of speaking to the lady\r\nVaninka.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is in the same house with her, would you have him avoid her?\"\r\n\r\n\"When the lady Vaninka returns late, and when perchance Mr. Foedor has\r\nnot accompanied you, whatever the hour Mr. Foedor is there, ready, to\r\nhelp her out of the carriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Foedor attends me, it is his duty,\" said the general, beginning to\r\nbelieve that the serf’s suspicions were founded on slight grounds. \"He\r\nwaits for me,\" he, continued, \"because when I return, at any hour of the\r\nday or night, I may have orders to give him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a day passes without Mr. Foedor going into my lady Vaninka’s room,\r\nalthough such a favour is not usually granted to a young man in a house\r\nlike that of your excellency.\"\r\n\r\n\"Usually it is I who send him to her,\" said the general.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, in the daytime,\" replied Gregory, \"but at night?\"\r\n\r\n\"At night!\" cried the general, rising to his feet, and turning so pale\r\nthat, after a moment, he was forced to lean for support on a table.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, at night, your excellency,\" answered Gregory quietly; \"and since,\r\nas you say, I have begun to mix myself up in a bad business, I must go\r\non with it; besides, even if there were to result from it another\r\npunishment for me, even more terrible than that I have already endured,\r\nI should not allow so good, a master to be deceived any longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be very careful about what you are going to say, slave; for I know the\r\nmen of your nation. Take care, if the accusation you are making by way\r\nof revenge is not supported by visible, palpable, and positive proofs,\r\nyou shall be punished as an infamous slanderer.\"\r\n\r\n\"To that I agree,\" said Gregory.\r\n\r\n\"Do you affirm that you have seen Foedor enter my daughter’s chamber at\r\nnight?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not say that I have seen him enter it, your excellency. I say that\r\nI have seen him come out.\"\r\n\r\n\"When was that?\"\r\n\r\n\"A quarter of an hour ago, when I was on my way to your excellency.\"\r\n\r\n\"You lie!\" said the general, raising his fist.\r\n\r\n\"This is not our agreement, your excellency,\" said the slave, drawing\r\nback. \"I am only to be punished if I fail to give proofs.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what are your proofs?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have told you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you expect me to believe your word alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; but I expect you to believe your own eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"The first time that Mr. Foedor is in my lady Vaninka’s room after\r\nmidnight, I shall come to find your excellency, and then you can judge\r\nfor yourself if I lie; but up to the present, your excellency, all the\r\nconditions of the service I wish to render you are to my disadvantage.\"\r\n\r\n\"In what way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if I fail to give proofs, I am to be treated as an infamous\r\nslanderer; but if I give them, what advantage shall I gain?\"\r\n\r\n\"A thousand roubles and your freedom.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a bargain, then, your excellency,\" replied Gregory quietly,\r\nreplacing the razors on the general’s toilet-table, \"and I hope that\r\nbefore a week has passed you will be more just to me than you are now.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words the slave left the room, leaving the general convinced\r\nby his confidence that some dreadful misfortune threatened him.\r\n\r\nFrom this time onward, as might be expected, the general weighed every\r\nword and noticed every gesture which passed between Vaninka and Foedor\r\nin his presence; but he saw nothing to confirm his suspicions on the\r\npart of the aide-de-camp or of his daughter; on the contrary, Vaninka\r\nseemed colder and more reserved than ever.\r\n\r\nA week passed in this way. About two o’clock in the morning of the ninth\r\nday, someone knocked at the general’s door. It was Gregory.\r\n\r\n\"If your excellency will go into your daughter’s room,\" said Gregory,\r\n\"you will find Mr. Foedor there.\"\r\n\r\nThe general turned pale, dressed himself without uttering a word, and\r\nfollowed the slave to the door of Vaninka’s room. Having arrived there,\r\nwith a motion of his hand he dismissed the informer, who, instead of\r\nretiring in obedience to this mute command, hid himself in the corner of\r\nthe corridor.\r\n\r\nWhen the general believed himself to be alone, he knocked once; but all\r\nwas silent. This silence, however, proved nothing; for Vaninka might be\r\nasleep. He knocked a second time, and the young girl, in a perfectly\r\ncalm voice, asked, \"Who is there?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is I,\" said the general, in a voice trembling with emotion.\r\n\r\n\"Annouschka!\" said the girl to her foster-sister, who slept in the\r\nadjoining room, \"open the door to my father. Forgive me, father,\" she\r\ncontinued; \"but Annouschka is dressing, and will be with you in a\r\nmoment.\"\r\n\r\nThe general waited patiently, for he could discover no trace of emotion\r\nin his daughter’s voice, and he hoped that Gregory had been mistaken.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments the door opened, and the general went in, and cast a\r\nlong look around him; there was no one in this first apartment.\r\n\r\nVaninka was in bed, paler perhaps than usual, but quite calm, with the\r\nloving smile on her lips with which she always welcomed her father.\r\n\r\n\"To what fortunate circumstance,\" asked the young girl in her softest\r\ntones, \"do I owe the pleasure of seeing you at so late an hour?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wished to speak to you about a very important matter,\" said the\r\ngeneral, \"and however late it was, I thought you would forgive me for\r\ndisturbing you.\"\r\n\r\n\"My father will always be welcome in his daughter’s room, at whatever\r\nhour of the day or night he presents himself there.\"\r\n\r\nThe general cast another searching look round, and was convinced that it\r\nwas impossible for a man to be concealed in the first room—but the\r\nsecond still remained.\r\n\r\n\"I am listening,\" said Vaninka, after a moment of silence.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but we are not alone,\" replied the general, \"and it is important\r\nthat no other ears should hear what I have to say to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Annauschka, as you know, is my foster-sister,\" said Vaninka.\r\n\r\n\"That makes no difference,\" said the general, going candle in hand into\r\nthe next room, which was somewhat smaller than his daughter’s.\r\n\"Annouschka,\" said he, \"watch in the corridor and see that no one\r\noverhears us.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke these words, the general threw the same scrutinizing glance\r\nall round the room, but with the exception of the young girl there was\r\nno one there.\r\n\r\nAnnouschka obeyed, and the general followed her out, and, looking\r\neagerly round for the last time, re-entered his daughter’s room, and\r\nseated himself on the foot of her bed. Annouschka, at a sign from her\r\nmistress, left her alone with her father. The general held out his hand\r\nto Vaninka, and she took it without hesitation.\r\n\r\n\"My child,\" said the general, \"I have to speak to you about a very\r\nimportant matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, father?\" said Vaninka.\r\n\r\n\"You will soon be eighteen,\" continued the general, \"and that is the age\r\nat which the daughters of the Russian nobility usually marry.\" The\r\ngeneral paused for a moment to watch the effect of these words upon\r\nVaninka, but her hand rested motionless in his. \"For the last year your\r\nhand has been engaged by me,\" continued the general.\r\n\r\n\"May I know to whom?\" asked Vaninka coldly.\r\n\r\n\"To the son of the Councillor-in-Ordinary,\" replied the general. \"What\r\nis your opinion of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a worthy and noble young man, I am told, but I can have formed no\r\nopinion except from hearsay. Has he not been in garrison at Moscow for\r\nthe last three months?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the general, \"but in three months’ time he should return.\"\r\n\r\nVaninka remained silent.\r\n\r\n\"Have you nothing to say in reply?\" asked the general.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, father; but I have a favour to ask of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not wish to marry until I am twenty years old.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have taken a vow to that effect.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if circumstances demanded the breaking of this vow, and made the\r\ncelebration of this marriage imperatively necessary?\"\r\n\r\n\"What circumstances?\" asked Vaninka.\r\n\r\n\"Foedor loves you,\" said the general, looking steadily at Vaninka.\r\n\r\n\"I know that,\" said Vaninka, with as little emotion as if the question\r\ndid not concern her.\r\n\r\n\"You know that!\" cried the general.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; he has told me so.\"\r\n\r\n\"When?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you replied—?\"\r\n\r\n\"That he must leave here at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he consented?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, father.\"\r\n\r\n\"When does he go?\"\r\n\r\n\"He has gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can that be?\" said the general: \"he only left me at ten o’clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he left me at midnight,\" said Vaninka.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said the general, drawing a deep breath of relief, \"you are a\r\nnoble girl, Vaninka, and I grant you what you ask-two years more. But\r\nremember it is the emperor who has decided upon this marriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"My father will do me the justice to believe that I am too submissive a\r\ndaughter to be a rebellious subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent, Vaninka, excellent,\" said the general. \"So, then, poor\r\nFoedor has told you all?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Vaninka.\r\n\r\n\"You knew that he addressed himself to me first?\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it was from him that you heard that your hand was engaged?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was from him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he consented to leave you? He is a good and noble young man, who\r\nshall always be under my protection wherever he goes. Oh, if my word had\r\nnot been given, I love him so much that, supposing you did not dislike\r\nhim, I should have given him your hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you cannot recall your promise?\" asked Vaninka.\r\n\r\n\"Impossible,\" said the general.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, I submit to my father’s will,\" said Vaninka.\r\n\r\n\"That is spoken like my daughter,\" said the general, embracing her.\r\n\"Farewell, Vaninka; I do not ask if you love him. You have both done\r\nyour duty, and I have nothing more to exact.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, he rose and left the room. Annouschka was in the\r\ncorridor; the general signed to her that she might go in again, and went\r\non his way. At the door of his room he found Gregory waiting for him.\r\n\r\n\"Well, your excellency?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the general, \"you are both right and wrong. Foedor loves my\r\ndaughter, but my daughter does not love him. He went into my daughter’s\r\nroom at eleven o’clock, but at midnight he left her for ever. No matter,\r\ncome to me tomorrow, and you shall have your thousand roubles and your\r\nliberty.\"\r\n\r\nGregory went off, dumb with astonishment.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Annouschka had re-entered her mistress’s room, as she had\r\nbeen ordered, and closed the door carefully behind her.\r\n\r\nVaninka immediately sprang out of bed and went to the door, listening to\r\nthe retreating footsteps of the general. When they had ceased to be\r\nheard, she rushed into Annouschka’s room, and both began to pull aside a\r\nbundle of linen, thrown down, as if by accident, into the embrasure of a\r\nwindow. Under the linen was a large chest with a spring lock. Annouschka\r\npressed a button, Vaninka raised the lid. The two women uttered a loud\r\ncry: the chest was now a coffin; the young officer, stifled for want of\r\nair, lay dead within.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the two women hoped it was only a swoon. Annouschka\r\nsprinkled his face with water; Vaninka put salts to his nose. All was in\r\nvain. During the long conversation which the general had had with his\r\ndaughter, and which had lasted more than half an hour, Foedor, unable to\r\nget out of the chest, as the lid was closed by a spring, had died for\r\nwant of air. The position of the two girls shut up with a corpse was\r\nfrightful. Annouschka saw Siberia close at hand; Vaninka, to do her\r\njustice, thought of nothing but Foedor. Both were in despair. However,\r\nas the despair of the maid was more selfish than that of her mistress,\r\nit was Annouschka who first thought of a plan of escaping from the\r\nsituation in which they were placed.\r\n\r\n\"My lady,\" she cried suddenly, \"we are saved.\" Vaninka raised her head\r\nand looked at her attendant with her eyes bathed in tears.\r\n\r\n\"Saved?\" said she, \"saved? We are, perhaps, but Foedor!\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen now,\" said Annouschka: \"your position is terrible, I grant that,\r\nand your grief is great; but your grief could be greater and your\r\nposition more terrible still. If the general knew this.\"\r\n\r\n\"What difference would it make to me?\" said Vaninka. \"I shall weep for\r\nhim before the whole world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but you will be dishonoured before the whole world! To-morrow your\r\nslaves, and the day after all St. Petersburg, will know that a man died\r\nof suffocation while concealed in your chamber. Reflect, my lady: your\r\nhonour is the honour of your father, the honour of your family.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" said Vaninka, shaking her head, as if to disperse the\r\ngloomy thoughts that burdened her brain,—\"you are right, but what must\r\nwe do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Does my lady know my brother Ivan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must tell him all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of what are you thinking?\" cried Vaninka. \"To confide in a man? A man,\r\ndo I say? A serf! a slave!\"\r\n\r\n\"The lower the position of the serf and slave, the safer will our secret\r\nbe, since he will have everything to gain by keeping faith with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your brother is a drunkard,\" said Vaninka, with mingled fear and\r\ndisgust.\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" said Annouschka; \"but where will you find a slave who is\r\nnot? My brother gets drunk less than most, and is therefore more to be\r\ntrusted than the others. Besides, in the position in which we are we\r\nmust risk something.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" said Vaninka, recovering her usual resolution, which\r\nalways grew in the presence of danger. \"Go and seek your brother.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can do nothing this morning,\" said Annouschka, drawing back the\r\nwindow curtains. \"Look, the dawn is breaking.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what can we do with the body of this unhappy man?\" cried Vaninka.\r\n\r\n\"It must remain hidden where it is all day, and this evening, while you\r\nare at the Court entertainment, my brother shall remove it.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" murmured Vaninka in a strange tone, \"I must go to Court this\r\nevening; to stay away would arouse suspicion. Oh, my God! my God!\"\r\n\r\n\"Help me, my lady,\" said Annouschka; \"I am not strong enough alone.\"\r\n\r\nVaninka turned deadly pale, but, spurred on by the danger, she went\r\nresolutely up to the body of her lover; then, lifting it by the\r\nshoulders, while her maid raised it by the legs, she laid it once more\r\nin the chest. Then Annouschka shut down the lid, locked the chest, and\r\nput the key into her breast. Then both threw back the linen which had\r\nhidden it from the eyes of the general. Day dawned, as might be\r\nexpected, ere sleep visited the eyes of Vaninka.\r\n\r\nShe went down, however, at the breakfast hour; for she did not wish to\r\narouse the slightest suspicion in her father’s mind. Only it might have\r\nbeen thought from her pallor that she had risen from the grave, but the\r\ngeneral attributed this to the nocturnal disturbance of which he had\r\nbeen the cause.\r\n\r\nLuck had served Vaninka wonderfully in prompting her to say that Foedor\r\nhad already gone; for not only did the general feel no surprise when he\r\ndid not appear, but his very absence was a proof of his daughter’s\r\ninnocence. The general gave a pretext for his aide-de-camp’s absence by\r\nsaying that he had sent him on a mission. As for Vaninka, she remained\r\nout of her room till it was time to dress. A week before, she had been\r\nat the Court entertainment with Foedor.\r\n\r\nVaninka might have excused herself from accompanying her father by\r\nfeigning some slight indisposition, but two considerations made her fear\r\nto act thus: the first was the fear of making the general anxious, and\r\nperhaps of making him remain at home himself, which would make the\r\nremoval of the corpse more difficult; the second was the fear of meeting\r\nIvan and having to blush before a slave. She preferred, therefore, to\r\nmake a superhuman effort to control herself; and, going up again into\r\nher room, accompanied by her faithful Annouschka, she began to dress\r\nwith as much care as if her heart were full of joy. When this cruel\r\nbusiness was finished, she ordered Annouschka to shut the door; for she\r\nwished to see Foedor once more, and to bid a last farewell to him who\r\nhad been her lover. Annouschka obeyed; and Vaninka, with flowers in her\r\nhair and her breast covered with jewels, glided like a phantom into her\r\nservant’s room.\r\n\r\nAnnouschka again opened the chest, and Vaninka, without shedding a tear,\r\nwithout breathing a sigh, with the profound and death-like calm of\r\ndespair, leant down towards Foedor and took off a plain ring which the\r\nyoung man had on his finger, placed it on her own, between two\r\nmagnificent rings, then kissing him on the brow, she said, \"Goodbye, my\r\nbetrothed.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment she heard steps approaching. It was a groom of the\r\nchambers coming from the general to ask if she were ready. Annouschka\r\nlet the lid of the chest fall, and Vaninka going herself to open the\r\ndoor, followed the messenger, who walked before her, lighting the way.\r\n\r\nSuch was her trust in her foster-sister that she left her to accomplish\r\nthe dark and terrible task with which she had burdened herself.\r\n\r\nA minute later, Annouschka saw the carriage containing the general and\r\nhis daughter leave by the main gate of the hotel.\r\n\r\nShe let half an hour go by, and then went down to look for Ivan. She\r\nfound him drinking with Gregory, with whom the general had kept his\r\nword, and who had received the same day one thousand roubles and his\r\nliberty. Fortunately, the revellers were only beginning their\r\nrejoicings, and Ivan in consequence was sober enough for his sister to\r\nentrust her secret to him without hesitation.\r\n\r\nIvan followed Annouschka into the chamber of her mistress. There she\r\nreminded him of all that Vaninka, haughty but generous, had allowed his\r\nsister to do for him. The, few glasses of brandy Ivan had already\r\nswallowed had predisposed him to gratitude (the drunkenness of the\r\nRussian is essentially tender). Ivan protested his devotion so warmly\r\nthat Annouschka hesitated no longer, and, raising the lid of the chest,\r\nshowed him the corpse of Foedor. At this terrible sight Ivan remained an\r\ninstant motionless, but he soon began to calculate how much money and\r\nhow many benefits the possession of such a secret would bring him. He\r\nswore by the most solemn oaths never to betray his mistress, and\r\noffered, as Annouschka had hoped, to dispose of the body of the\r\nunfortunate aide-decamp.\r\n\r\nThe thing was easily done. Instead of returning to drink with Gregory\r\nand his comrades, Ivan went to prepare a sledge, filled it with straw,\r\nand hid at the bottom an iron crowbar. He brought this to the outside\r\ngate, and assuring himself he was not being spied upon, he raised the\r\nbody of the dead man in his arms, hid it under the straw, and sat down\r\nabove it. He had the gate of the hotel opened, followed Niewski Street\r\nas far as the Zunamenie Church, passed through the shops in the\r\nRejestwenskoi district, drove the sledge out on to the frozen Neva, and\r\nhalted in the middle of the river, in front of the deserted church of\r\nSte. Madeleine. There, protected by the solitude and darkness, hidden\r\nbehind the black mass of his sledge, he began to break the ice, which\r\nwas fifteen inches thick, with his pick. When he had made a large enough\r\nhole, he searched the body of Foedor, took all the money he had about\r\nhim, and slipped the body head foremost through the opening he had made.\r\nHe then made his way back to the hotel, while the imprisoned current of\r\nthe Neva bore away the corpse towards the Gulf of Finland. An hour\r\nafter, a new crust of ice had formed, and not even a trace of the\r\nopening made by Ivan remained.\r\n\r\nAt midnight Vaninka returned with her father. A hidden fever had been\r\nconsuming her all the evening: never had she looked so lovely, and she\r\nhad been overwhelmed by the homage of the most distinguished nobles and\r\ncourtiers. When she returned, she found Annouschka in the vestibule\r\nwaiting to take her cloak. As she gave it to her, Vaninka sent her one\r\nof those questioning glances that seem to express so much. \"It is done,\"\r\nsaid the girl in a low voice. Vaninka breathed a sigh of relief, as if a\r\nmountain had been removed from her breast. Great as was her\r\nself-control, she could no longer bear her father’s presence, and\r\nexcused herself from remaining to supper with him, on the plea of the\r\nfatigues of the evening. Vaninka was no sooner in her room, with the\r\ndoor once closed, than she tore the flowers from her hair, the necklace\r\nfrom her throat, cut with scissors the corsets which suffocated her, and\r\nthen, throwing herself on her bed, she gave way to her grief. Annouschka\r\nthanked God for this outburst; her mistress’s calmness had frightened\r\nher more than her despair. The first crisis over, Vaninka was able to\r\npray. She spent an hour on her knees, then, yielding to the entreaties\r\nof her faithful attendant, went to bed. Annouschka sat down at the foot\r\nof the bed.\r\n\r\nNeither slept, but when day came the tears which Vaninka had shed had\r\ncalmed her.\r\n\r\nAnnouschka was instructed to reward her brother. Too large a sum given\r\nto a slave at once might have aroused suspicion, therefore Annouschka\r\ncontented herself with telling Ivan that when he had need of money he\r\nhad only to ask her for it.\r\n\r\nGregory, profiting by his liberty and wishing to make use of his\r\nthousand roubles, bought a little tavern on the outskirts of the town,\r\nwhere, thanks to his address and to the acquaintances he had among the\r\nservants in the great households of St. Petersburg, he began to develop\r\nan excellent business, so that in a short time the Red House (which was\r\nthe name and colour of Gregory’s establishment) had a great reputation.\r\nAnother man took over his duties about the person of the general, and\r\nbut for Foedor’s absence everything returned to its usual routine in the\r\nhouse of Count Tchermayloff.\r\n\r\nTwo months went by in this way, without anybody having the least\r\nsuspicion of what had happened, when one morning before the usual\r\nbreakfast-hour the general begged his daughter to come down to his room.\r\nVaninka trembled with fear, for since that fatal night everything\r\nterrified her. She obeyed her father, and collecting all her strength,\r\nmade her way to his chamber, The count was alone, but at the first\r\nglance Vaninka saw she had nothing to fear from this interview: the\r\ngeneral was waiting for her with that paternal smile which was the usual\r\nexpression of his countenance when in his daughter’s presence.\r\n\r\nShe approached, therefore, with her usual calmness, and, stooping down\r\ntowards the general, gave him her forehead to kiss.\r\n\r\nHe motioned to her to sit down, and gave her an open letter. Vaninka\r\nlooked at him for a moment in surprise, then turned her eyes to the\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nIt contained the news of the death of the man to whom her hand had been\r\npromised: he had been killed in a duel.\r\n\r\nThe general watched the effect of the letter on his daughter’s face, and\r\ngreat as was Vaninka’s self-control, so many different thoughts, such\r\nbitter regret, such poignant remorse assailed her when she learnt that\r\nshe was now free again, that she could not entirely conceal her emotion.\r\nThe general noticed it, and attributed it to the love which he had for a\r\nlong time suspected his daughter felt for the young aide-de-camp.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, smiling, \"I see it is all for the best.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is that, father?\" asked Vaninka.\r\n\r\n\"Doubtless,\" said the general. \"Did not Foedor leave because he loved\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" murmured the young girl.\r\n\r\n\"Well, now he may return,\" said the general.\r\n\r\nVaninka remained silent, her eyes fixed, her lips trembling.\r\n\r\n\"Return!\" she said, after a moment’s silence.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, certainly return. We shall be most unfortunate,\" continued the\r\ngeneral, smiling, \"if we cannot find someone in the house who knows\r\nwhere he is. Come, Vaninka, tell me the place of his exile, and I will\r\nundertake the rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobody knows where Foedor is,\" murmured Vaninka in a hollow voice;\r\n\"nobody but God, nobody!\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" said the general, \"he has sent you no news since the day he\r\nleft?\"\r\n\r\nVaninka shook her head in denial. She was so heart-broken that she could\r\nnot speak.\r\n\r\nThe general in his turn became gloomy. \"Do you fear some misfortune,\r\nthen?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"I fear that I shall never be happy again on earth,\" cried Vaninka,\r\ngiving way under the pressure of her grief; then she continued at once,\r\n\"Let me retire, father; I am ashamed of what I have said.\"\r\n\r\nThe general, who saw nothing in this exclamation beyond regret for\r\nhaving allowed the confession of her love to escape her, kissed his\r\ndaughter on the brow and allowed her to retire. He hoped that, in spite\r\nof the mournful way in which Vaninka had spoken of Foedor, that it would\r\nbe possible to find him. The same day he went to the emperor and told\r\nhim of the love of Foedor for his daughter, and requested, since death\r\nhad freed her from her first engagement, that he might dispose of her\r\nhand. The emperor consented, and the general then solicited a further\r\nfavour. Paul was in one of his kindly moods, and showed himself disposed\r\nto grant it. The general told him that Foedor had disappeared for two\r\nmonths; that everyone, even his daughter, was ignorant of his\r\nwhereabouts, and begged him to have inquiries made. The emperor\r\nimmediately sent for the chief of police, and gave him the necessary\r\norders.\r\n\r\nSix weeks went by without any result. Vaninka, since the day when the\r\nletter came, was sadder and more melancholy than ever. Vainly from time\r\nto time the general tried to make her more hopeful. Vaninka only shook\r\nher head and withdrew. The general ceased to speak, of Foedor.\r\n\r\nBut it was not the same among the household. The young aide-de-camp had\r\nbeen popular with the servants, and, with the exception of Gregory,\r\nthere was not a soul who wished him harm, so that, when it became known\r\nthat he had not been sent on a mission, but had disappeared, the matter\r\nbecame the constant subject of conversation in the antechamber, the\r\nkitchen, and the stables. There was another place where people busied\r\nthemselves about it a great deal—this was the Red House.\r\n\r\nFrom the day when he heard of Foedor’s mysterious departure Gregory had\r\nhis suspicions. He was sure that he had seen Foedor enter Vaninka’s\r\nroom, and unless he had gone out while he was going to seek the general,\r\nhe did not understand why the latter had not found him in his daughter’s\r\nroom. Another thing occupied his mind, which it seemed to him might\r\nperhaps have some connection with this event—the amount of money Ivan\r\nhad been spending since that time, a very extraordinary amount for a\r\nslave. This slave, however, was the brother of Vaninka’s cherished\r\nfoster-sister, so that, without being sure, Gregory already suspected\r\nthe source from whence this money came. Another thing confirmed him in\r\nhis suspicions, which was that Ivan, who had not only remained his most\r\nfaithful friend, but had become one of his best customers, never spoke\r\nof Foedor, held his tongue if he were mentioned in his presence, and to\r\nall questions, however pressing they were, made but one answer: \"Let us\r\nspeak of something else.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Feast of Kings arrived. This is a great day in St.\r\nPetersburg, for it is also the day for blessing the waters.\r\n\r\nAs Vaninka had been present at the ceremony, and was fatigued after\r\nstanding for two hours on the Neva, the general did not go out that\r\nevening, and gave Ivan leave to do so. Ivan profited by the permission\r\nto go to the Red House.\r\n\r\nThere was a numerous company there, and Ivan was welcomed; for it was\r\nknown that he generally came with full pockets. This time he did not\r\nbelie his reputation, and had scarcely arrived before he made the\r\nsorok-kopecks ring, to the great envy of his companions.\r\n\r\nAt this warning sound Gregory hastened up with all possible deference, a\r\nbottle of brandy in each hand; for he knew that when Ivan summoned him\r\nhe gained in two ways, as innkeeper and as boon companion. Ivan did not\r\ndisappoint these hopes, and Gregory was invited to share in the\r\nentertainment. The conversation turned on slavery, and some of the\r\nunhappy men, who had only four days in the year of respite from their\r\neternal labour, talked loudly of the happiness Gregory had enjoyed since\r\nhe had obtained his freedom.\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" said Ivan, on whom the brandy had begun to take effect, \"there\r\nare some slaves who are freer than their masters.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" said Gregory, pouring him out another glass of\r\nbrandy.\r\n\r\n\"I meant to say happier,\" said Ivan quickly.\r\n\r\n\"It is difficult to prove that,\" said Gregory doubtingly.\r\n\r\n\"Why difficult? Our masters, the moment they are born, are put into the\r\nhands of two or three pedants, one French, another German, and a third\r\nEnglish, and whether they like them or not, they must be content with\r\ntheir society till they are seventeen, and whether they wish to or not,\r\nmust learn three barbarous languages, at the expense of our noble\r\nRussian tongue, which they have sometimes completely forgotten by the\r\ntime the others are acquired. Again, if one of them wishes for some\r\ncareer, he must become a soldier: if he is a sublieutenant, he is the\r\nslave of the lieutenant; if he is a lieutenant, he is the slave of the\r\ncaptain, and the captain of the major, and so on up to the emperor, who\r\nis nobody’s slave, but who one fine day is surprised at the table, while\r\nwalking, or in his bed, and is poisoned, stabbed, or strangled. If he\r\nchooses a civil career, it is much the same. He marries a wife, and does\r\nnot love her; children come to him he knows not how, whom he has to\r\nprovide for; he must struggle incessantly to provide for his family if\r\nhe is poor, and if he is rich to prevent himself being robbed by his\r\nsteward and cheated by his tenants. Is this life? While we, gentlemen,\r\nwe are born, and that is the only pain we cost our mothers—all the rest\r\nis the master’s concern. He provides for us, he chooses our calling,\r\nalways easy enough to learn if we are not quite idiots. Are we ill? His\r\ndoctor attends us gratis; it is a loss to him if we die. Are we well? We\r\nhave our four certain meals a day, and a good stove to sleep near at\r\nnight. Do we fall in love? There is never any hindrance to our marriage,\r\nif the woman loves us; the master himself asks us to hasten our\r\nmarriage, for he wishes us to have as many children as possible. And\r\nwhen the children are born, he does for them in their turn all he has\r\ndone for us. Can you find me many great lords as happy as their slaves?\"\r\n\r\n\"All this is true,\" said Gregory, pouring him out another glass of\r\nbrandy; \"but, after all, you are not free.\"\r\n\r\n\"Free to do what?\" asked Ivan.\r\n\r\n\"Free to go where you will and when you will.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am as free as the air,\" replied Ivan.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" said Gregory.\r\n\r\n\"Free as air, I tell you; for I have good masters, and above all a good\r\nmistress,\" continued Ivan, with a significant smile, \"and I have only to\r\nask and it is done.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! if after having got drunk here to-day, you asked to come back\r\nto-morrow to get drunk again?\" said Gregory, who in his challenge to\r\nIvan did not forget his own interests,—\"if you asked that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should come back again,\" said Ivan.\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow?\" said Gregory.\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow, the day after, every day if I liked....\"\r\n\r\n\"The fact is, Ivan is our young lady’s favourite,\" said another of the\r\ncount’s slaves who was present, profiting by his comrade Ivan’s\r\nliberality.\r\n\r\n\"It is all the same,\" said Gregory; \"for supposing such permission were\r\ngiven you, money would soon run short.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" said Ivan, swallowing another glass of brandy, \"never will Ivan\r\nwant for money as long as there is a kopeck in my lady’s purse.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not find her so liberal,\" said Gregory bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you forget, my friend; you know well she does not reckon with her\r\nfriends: remember the strokes of the knout.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no wish to speak about that,\" said Gregory. \"I know that she is\r\ngenerous with blows, but her money is another thing. I have never seen\r\nthe colour of that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, would you like to see the colour of mine?\" said Ivan, getting\r\nmore and more drunk. \"See here, here are kopecks, sorok-kopecks, blue\r\nnotes worth five roubles, red notes worth twenty five roubles, and\r\nto-morrow, if you like, I will show you white notes worth fifty roubles.\r\nA health to my lady Vaninka!\" And Ivan held out his glass again, and\r\nGregory filled it to the brim.\r\n\r\n\"But does money,\" said Gregory, pressing Ivan more and more,—\"does money\r\nmake up for scorn?\"\r\n\r\n\"Scorn!\" said Ivan,—\"scorn! Who scorns me? Do you, because you are free?\r\nFine freedom! I would rather be a well-fed slave than a free man dying\r\nof hunger.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean the scorn of our masters,\" replied Gregory.\r\n\r\n\"The scorn of our masters! Ask Alexis, ask Daniel there, if my lady\r\nscorns me.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fact is,\" said the two slaves in reply, who both belonged to the\r\ngeneral’s household, \"Ivan must certainly have a charm; for everyone\r\ntalks to him as if to a master.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he is Annouschka’s brother,\" said Gregory, \"and Annouschka is\r\nmy lady’s foster-sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be so,\" said the two slaves.\r\n\r\n\"For that reason or for some other,\" said Ivan; \"but, in short, that is\r\nthe case.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but if your sister should die?\" said Gregory. \"Ah!\"\r\n\r\n\"If my sister should die, that would be a pity, for she is a good girl.\r\nI drink to her health! But if she should die, that would make no\r\ndifference. I am respected for myself; they respect me because they fear\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fear my lord Ivan!\" said Gregory, with a loud laugh. \"It follows, then,\r\nthat if my lord Ivan were tired of receiving orders, and gave them in\r\nhis turn, my lord Ivan would be obeyed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" said Ivan.\r\n\r\n\"He said ’perhaps,’ repeated Gregory,\" laughing louder than ever,—\"he\r\nsaid ’perhaps.’ Did you hear him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the slaves, who had drunk so much that they could only\r\nanswer in monosyllables.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I no longer say ’perhaps,’ I now say ’for certain.’\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I should like to see that,\" said Gregory; \"I would give something\r\nto see that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, send away these fellows, who are getting drunk like pigs, and for\r\nnothing, you will find.\"\r\n\r\n\"For nothing?\" said Gregory. \"You are jesting. Do you think I should\r\ngive them drink for nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we shall see. How much would be their score, for your atrocious\r\nbrandy, if they drank from now till midnight, when you are obliged to\r\nshut up your tavern?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not less than twenty roubles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here are thirty; turn them out, and let us remain by ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Friends,\" said Gregory, taking out his watch as if to look at the time,\r\n\"it is just upon midnight; you know the governor’s orders, so you must\r\ngo.\" The men, habituated like all Russians to passive obedience, went\r\nwithout a murmur, and Gregory found himself alone with Ivan and the two\r\nother slaves of the general.\r\n\r\n\"Well, here we are alone,\" said Gregory. \"What do you mean to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what would you say,\" replied Ivan, \"if in spite of the late hour\r\nand the cold, and in spite of the fact that we are only slaves, my lady\r\nwere to leave her father’s house and come to drink our healths?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would say that you ought to take advantage of it,\" said Gregory,\r\nshrugging his shoulders, \"and tell her to bring at the same time a\r\nbottle of brandy. There is probably better brandy in the general’s\r\ncellar than in mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is better,\" said Ivan, as if he was perfectly sure of it, \"and my\r\nlady shall bring you a bottle of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are mad!\" said Gregory.\r\n\r\n\"He is mad!\" repeated the other two slaves mechanically.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I am mad?\" said Ivan. \"Well, will you take a wager?\"\r\n\r\n\"What will you wager?\"\r\n\r\n\"Two hundred roubles against a year of free drinking in your inn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Done!\" said Gregory.\r\n\r\n\"Are your comrades included?\" said the two moujiks.\r\n\r\n\"They are included,\" said Ivan, \"and in consideration of them we will\r\nreduce the time to six months. Is that agreed?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is agreed,\" said Gregory.\r\n\r\nThe two who were making the wager shook hands, and the agreement was\r\nperfected. Then, with an air of confidence, assumed to confound the\r\nwitnesses of this strange scene, Ivan wrapped himself in the fur coat\r\nwhich, like a cautious man, he had spread on the stove, and went out.\r\n\r\nAt the end of half an hour he reappeared.\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" cried Gregory and the two slaves together.\r\n\r\n\"She is following,\" said Ivan.\r\n\r\nThe three tipplers looked at one another in amazement, but Ivan quietly\r\nreturned to his place in the middle of them, poured out a new bumper,\r\nand raising his glass, cried—\r\n\r\n\"To my lady’s health! It is the least we can do when she is kind enough\r\nto come and join us on so cold a night, when the snow is falling fast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Annouschka,\" said a voice outside, \"knock at this door and ask Gregory\r\nif he has not some of our servants with him.\"\r\n\r\nGregory and the two other slaves looked at one another, stupefied: they\r\nhad recognised Vaninka’s voice. As for Ivan, he flung himself back in\r\nhis chair, balancing himself with marvellous impertinence.\r\n\r\nAnnouschka opened the door, and they could see, as Ivan had said, that\r\nthe snow was falling heavily.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madam,\" said the girl; \"my brother is there, with Daniel and\r\nAlexis.\"\r\n\r\nVaninka entered.\r\n\r\n\"My friends,\" said she, with a strange smile, \"I am told that you were\r\ndrinking my health, and I have come to bring you something to drink it\r\nagain. Here is a bottle of old French brandy which I have chosen for you\r\nfrom my father’s cellar. Hold out your glasses.\"\r\n\r\nGregory and the slaves obeyed with the slowness and hesitation of\r\nastonishment, while Ivan held out his glass with the utmost effrontery.\r\n\r\nVaninka filled them to the brim herself, and then, as they hesitated to\r\ndrink, \"Come, drink to my health, friends,\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" cried the drinkers, reassured by the kind and familiar tone of\r\ntheir noble visitor, as they emptied their glasses at a draught.\r\n\r\nVaninka at once poured them out another glass; then putting the bottle\r\non the table, \"Empty the bottle, my friends,\" said she, \"and do not\r\ntrouble about me. Annouschka and I, with the permission of the\r\nmaster of the house, will sit near the stove till the storm is over.\"\r\n\r\nGregory tried to rise and place stools near the stove, but whether he\r\nwas quite drunk or whether some narcotic had been mixed with the brandy,\r\nhe fell back on his seat, trying to stammer out an excuse.\r\n\r\n\"It is all right,\" said Vaninka: \"do not disturb yourselves; drink, my\r\nfriends, drink.\"\r\n\r\nThe revellers profited by this permission, and each emptied the glass\r\nbefore him. Scarcely had Gregory emptied his before he fell forward on\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" said Vaninka to her maid in a low voice: \"the opium is taking\r\neffect.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean to do?\" said Annouschka.\r\n\r\n\"You will soon see,\" was the answer.\r\n\r\nThe two moujiks followed the example of the master of the house, and\r\nfell down side by side on the ground. Ivan was left struggling against\r\nsleep, and trying to sing a drinking song; but soon his tongue refused\r\nto obey him, his eyes closed in spite of him, and seeking the tune that\r\nescaped him, and muttering words he was unable to pronounce, he fell\r\nfast asleep near his companions.\r\n\r\nImmediately Vaninka rose, fixed them with flashing eyes, and called them\r\nby name one after another. There was no response.\r\n\r\nThen she clapped her hands and cried joyfully, \"The moment has come!\"\r\nGoing to the back of the room, she brought thence an armful of straw,\r\nplaced it in a corner of the room, and did the same in the other\r\ncorners. She then took a flaming brand from the stove and set fire in\r\nsuccession to the four corners of the room.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing?\" said Annouschka, wild with terror, trying to stop\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"I am going to bury our secret in the ashes of this house,\" answered\r\nVaninka.\r\n\r\n\"But my brother, my poor brother!\" said the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Your brother is a wretch who has betrayed me, and we are lost if we do\r\nnot destroy him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my brother, my poor brother!\"\r\n\r\n\"You can die with him if you like,\" said Vaninka, accompanying the\r\nproposal with a smile which showed she would not have been sorry if\r\nAnnouschka had carried sisterly affection to that length.\r\n\r\n\"But look at the fire, madam—the fire!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us go, then,\" said Vaninka; and, dragging out the heart-broken\r\ngirl, she locked the door behind her and threw the key far away into the\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\n\"In the name of Heaven,\" said Annouschka, \"let us go home quickly: I\r\ncannot gaze upon this awful sight!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, let us stay here!\" said Vaninka, holding her back with a grasp of\r\nalmost masculine strength. \"Let us stay until the house falls in on\r\nthem, so that we may be certain that not one of them escapes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my God!\" cried Annouschka, falling on her knees, \"have mercy upon\r\nmy poor brother, for death will hurry him unprepared into Thy presence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, pray; that is right,\" said Vaninka. \"I wish to destroy their\r\nbodies, not their souls.\"\r\n\r\nVaninka stood motionless, her arms crossed, brilliantly lit up by the\r\nflames, while her attendant prayed. The fire did not last long: the\r\nhouse was wooden, with the crevices filled with oakum, like all those of\r\nRussian peasants, so that the flames, creeping out at the four corners,\r\nsoon made great headway, and, fanned by the wind, spread rapidly to all\r\nparts of the building. Vaninka followed the progress of the fire with\r\nblazing eyes, fearing to see some half-burnt spectral shape rush out of\r\nthe flames. At last the roof fell in, and Vaninka, relieved of all fear,\r\nthen at last made her way to the general’s house, into which the two\r\nwomen entered without being seen, thanks to the permission Annouschka\r\nhad to go out at any hour of the day or night.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the sole topic of conversation in St. Petersburg was\r\nthe fire at the Red House. Four half-consumed corpses were dug out from\r\nbeneath the ruins, and as three of the general’s slaves were missing, he\r\nhad no doubt that the unrecognisable bodies were those of Ivan, Daniel,\r\nand Alexis: as for the fourth, it was certainly that of Gregory.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the fire remained a secret from everyone: the house was\r\nsolitary, and the snowstorm so violent that nobody had met the two women\r\non the deserted road. Vaninka was sure of her maid. Her secret then had\r\nperished with Ivan. But now remorse took the place of fear: the young\r\ngirl who was so pitiless and inflexible in the execution of the deed\r\nquailed at its remembrance. It seemed to her that by revealing the\r\nsecret of her crime to a priest, she would be relieved of her terrible\r\nburden. She therefore sought a confessor renowned for his lofty charity,\r\nand, under the seal of confession, told him all. The priest was\r\nhorrified by the story. Divine mercy is boundless, but human forgiveness\r\nhas its limits. He refused Vaninka the absolution she asked. This\r\nrefusal was terrible: it would banish Vaninka from the Holy Table; this\r\nbanishment would be noticed, and could not fail to be attributed to some\r\nunheard-of and secret crime. Vaninka fell at the feet of the priest, and\r\nin the name of her father, who would be disgraced by her shame, begged\r\nhim to mitigate the rigour of this sentence.\r\n\r\nThe confessor reflected deeply, then thought he had found a way to\r\nobviate such consequences. It was that Vaninka should approach the Holy\r\nTable with the other young girls; the priest would stop before her as\r\nbefore all the others, but only say to her, \"Pray and weep\"; the\r\ncongregation, deceived by this, would think that she had received the\r\nSacrament like her companions. This was all that Vaninka could obtain.\r\n\r\nThis confession took place about seven o’clock in the evening, and the\r\nsolitude of the church, added to the darkness of night, had given it a\r\nstill more awful character. The confessor returned home, pale and\r\ntrembling. His wife Elizabeth was waiting for him alone. She had just\r\nput her little daughter Arina, who was eight years old, to bed in an\r\nadjoining room. When she saw her husband, she uttered a cry of terror,\r\nso changed and haggard was his appearance. The confessor tried to\r\nreassure her, but his trembling voice only increased her alarm. She\r\nasked the cause of his agitation; the confessor refused to tell her.\r\nElizabeth had heard the evening before that her mother was ill; she\r\nthought that her husband had received some bad news. The day was Monday,\r\nwhich is considered an unlucky day among the Russians, and, going out\r\nthat day, Elizabeth had met a man in mourning; these omens were too\r\nnumerous and too strong not to portend misfortune.\r\n\r\nElizabeth burst into tears, and cried out, \"My mother is dead!\"\r\n\r\nThe priest in vain tried to reassure her by telling her that his\r\nagitation was not due to that. The poor woman, dominated by one idea,\r\nmade no response to his protestations but this everlasting cry, \"My\r\nmother is dead!\"\r\n\r\nThen, to bring her to reason, the confessor told her that his emotion\r\nwas due to the avowal of a crime which he had just heard in the\r\nconfessional. But Elizabeth shook her head: it was a trick, she said, to\r\nhide from her the sorrow which had fallen upon her. Her agony, instead\r\nof calming, became more violent; her tears ceased to flow, and were\r\nfollowed by hysterics. The priest then made her swear to keep the\r\nsecret, and the sanctity of the confession was betrayed.\r\n\r\nLittle Arina had awakened at Elizabeth’s cries, and being disturbed and\r\nat the same time curious as to what her parents were doing, she got up,\r\nwent to listen at the door, and heard all.\r\n\r\nThe day for the Communion came; the church of St. Simeon was crowded.\r\nVaninka came to kneel at the railing of the choir. Behind her was her\r\nfather and his aides-de-camp, and behind them their servants.\r\n\r\nArina was also in the church with her mother. The inquisitive child\r\nwished to see Vaninka, whose name she had heard pronounced that terrible\r\nnight, when her father had failed in the first and most sacred of the\r\nduties imposed on a priest. While her mother was praying, she left her\r\nchair and glided among the worshippers, nearly as far as the railing.\r\n\r\nBut when she had arrived there, she was stopped by the group of the\r\ngeneral’s servants. But Arina had not come so far to be, stopped so\r\neasily: she tried to push between them, but they opposed her; she\r\npersisted, and one of them pushed her roughly back. The child fell,\r\nstruck her head against a seat, and got up bleeding and crying, \"You are\r\nvery proud for a slave. Is it because you belong to the great lady who\r\nburnt the Red House?\"\r\n\r\nThese words, uttered in a loud voice, in the midst of the silence which\r\npreceded, the sacred ceremony, were heard by everyone. They were\r\nanswered by a shriek. Vaninka had fainted. The next day the general, at\r\nthe feet of Paul, recounted to him, as his sovereign and judge, the\r\nwhole terrible story, which Vaninka, crushed by her long struggle, had\r\nat last revealed to him, at night, after the scene in the church.\r\n\r\nThe emperor remained for a moment in thought at the end of this strange\r\nconfession; then, getting up from the chair where he had been sitting\r\nwhile the miserable father told his story, he went to a bureau, and\r\nwrote on a sheet of paper the following sentence:\r\n\r\n\"The priest having violated what should have been inviolable, the\r\nsecrets of the confessional, is exiled to Siberia and deprived of his\r\npriestly office. His wife will follow him: she is to be blamed for not\r\nhaving respected his character as a minister of the altar. The little\r\ngirl will not leave her parents.\r\n\r\n\"Annouschka, the attendant, will also go to Siberia for not having made\r\nknown to her master his daughter’s conduct.\r\n\r\n\"I preserve all my esteem for the general, and I mourn with him for the\r\ndeadly blow which has struck him.\r\n\r\n\"As for Vaninka, I know of no punishment which can be inflicted upon\r\nher. I only see in her the daughter of a brave soldier, whose whole life\r\nhas been devoted to the service of his country. Besides, the\r\nextraordinary way in which the crime was discovered, seems to place the\r\nculprit beyond the limits of my severity. I leave her punishment in her\r\nown hands. If I understand her character, if any feeling of dignity\r\nremains to her, her heart and her remorse will show her the path she\r\nought to follow.\"\r\n\r\nPaul handed the paper open to the general, ordering him to take it to\r\nCount Pahlen, the governor of St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nOn the following day the emperor’s orders were carried out.\r\n\r\nVaninka went into a convent, where towards the end of the same year she\r\ndied of shame and grief.\r\n\r\nThe general found the death he sought on the field of Austerlitz.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*THE MARQUISE DE GANGES—1657*\r\n\r\n\r\nToward the close of the year 1657, a very plain carriage, with no arms\r\npainted on it, stopped, about eight o’clock one evening, before the door\r\nof a house in the rue Hautefeuille, at which two other coaches were\r\nalready standing. A lackey at once got down to open the carriage door;\r\nbut a sweet, though rather tremulous voice stopped him, saying, \"Wait,\r\nwhile I see whether this is the place.\"\r\n\r\nThen a head, muffled so closely in a black satin mantle that no feature\r\ncould be distinguished, was thrust from one of the carriage windows, and\r\nlooking around, seemed to seek for some decisive sign on the house\r\nfront. The unknown lady appeared to be satisfied by her inspection, for\r\nshe turned back to her companion.\r\n\r\n\"It is here,\" said she. \"There is the sign.\"\r\n\r\nAs a result of this certainty, the carriage door was opened, the two\r\nwomen alighted, and after having once more raised their eyes to a strip\r\nof wood, some six or eight feet long by two broad, which was nailed\r\nabove the windows of the second storey, and bore the inscription,\r\n\"Madame Voison, midwife,\" stole quickly into a passage, the door of\r\nwhich was unfastened, and in which there was just so much light as\r\nenabled persons passing in or out to find their way along the narrow\r\nwinding stair that led from the ground floor to the fifth story.\r\n\r\nThe two strangers, one of whom appeared to be of far higher rank than\r\nthe other, did not stop, as might have been expected, at the door\r\ncorresponding with the inscription that had guided them, but, on the\r\ncontrary, went on to the next floor.\r\n\r\nHere, upon the landing, was a kind of dwarf, oddly dressed after the\r\nfashion of sixteenth-century Venetian buffoons, who, when he saw the two\r\nwomen coming, stretched out a wand, as though to prevent them from going\r\nfarther, and asked what they wanted.\r\n\r\n\"To consult the spirit,\" replied the woman of the sweet and tremulous\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"Come in and wait,\" returned the dwarf, lifting a panel of tapestry and\r\nushering the two women into a waiting-room.\r\n\r\nThe women obeyed, and remained for about half an hour, seeing and\r\nhearing nothing. At last a door, concealed by the tapestry, was suddenly\r\nopened; a voice uttered the word \"Enter,\" and the two women were\r\nintroduced into a second room, hung with black, and lighted solely by a\r\nthree-branched lamp that hung from the ceiling. The door closed behind\r\nthem, and the clients found themselves face to face with the sibyl.\r\n\r\nShe was a woman of about twenty-five or twenty-six, who, unlike other\r\nwomen, evidently desired to appear older than she was. She was dressed\r\nin black; her hair hung in plaits; her neck, arms, and feet were bare;\r\nthe belt at her waist was clasped by a large garnet which threw out\r\nsombre fires. In her hand she held a wand, and she was raised on a sort\r\nof platform which stood for the tripod of the ancients, and from which\r\ncame acrid and penetrating fumes; she was, moreover, fairly handsome,\r\nalthough her features were common, the eyes only excepted, and these, by\r\nsome trick of the toilet, no doubt, looked inordinately large, and, like\r\nthe garnet in her belt, emitted strange lights.\r\n\r\nWhen the two visitors came in, they found the soothsayer leaning her\r\nforehead on her hand, as though absorbed in thought. Fearing to rouse\r\nher from her ecstasy, they waited in silence until it should please her\r\nto change her position. At the end of ten minutes she raised her head,\r\nand seemed only now to become aware that two persons were standing\r\nbefore her.\r\n\r\n\"What is wanted of me again?\" she asked, \"and shall I have rest only in\r\nthe grave?\"\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me, madame,\" said the sweet-voiced unknown, \"but I am wishing\r\nto know——\"\r\n\r\n\"Silence!\" said the sibyl, in a solemn voice. \"I will not know your\r\naffairs. It is to the spirit that you must address yourself; he is a\r\njealous spirit, who forbids his secrets to be shared; I can but pray to\r\nhim for you, and obey his will.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words, she left her tripod, passed into an adjoining room, and\r\nsoon returned, looking even paler and more anxious than before, and\r\ncarrying in one hand a burning chafing dish, in the other a red paper.\r\nThe three flames of the lamp grew fainter at the same moment, and the\r\nroom was left lighted up only by the chafing dish; every object now\r\nassumed a fantastic air that did not fail to disquiet the two visitors,\r\nbut it was too late to draw back.\r\n\r\nThe soothsayer placed the chafing dish in the middle of the room,\r\npresented the paper to the young woman who had spoken, and said to her—\r\n\r\n\"Write down what you wish to know.\"\r\n\r\nThe woman took the paper with a steadier hand than might have been\r\nexpected, seated herself at a table, and wrote:—\r\n\r\n\"Am I young? Am I beautiful? Am I maid, wife, or widow? This is for the\r\npast.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I marry, or marry again? Shall I live long, or shall I die young?\r\nThis is for the future.\"\r\n\r\nThen, stretching out her hand to the soothsayer, she asked—\r\n\r\n\"What am I to do now with this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Roll that letter around this ball,\" answered the other, handing to the\r\nunknown a little ball of virgin wax. \"Both ball and letter will be\r\nconsumed in the flame before your eyes; the spirit knows your secrets\r\nalready. In three days you will have the answer.\"\r\n\r\nThe unknown did as the sibyl bade her; then the latter took from her\r\nhands the ball and the paper in which it was wrapped, and went and threw\r\nboth into the chafing pan.\r\n\r\n\"And now all is done as it should be,\" said the soothsayer. \"Comus!\"\r\n\r\nThe dwarf came in.\r\n\r\n\"See the lady to her coach.\"\r\n\r\nThe stranger left a purse upon the table, and followed Comus. He\r\nconducted her and her companion, who was only a confidential maid, down\r\na back staircase, used as an exit, and leading into a different street\r\nfrom that by which the two women had come in; but the coachman, who had\r\nbeen told beforehand of this circumstance, was awaiting them at the\r\ndoor, and they had only to step into their carriage, which bore them\r\nrapidly away in the direction of the rue Dauphine.\r\n\r\nThree days later, according to the promise given her, the fair unknown,\r\nwhen she awakened, found on the table beside her a letter in an\r\nunfamiliar handwriting; it was addressed \"To the beautiful Provencale,\"\r\nand contained these words—\r\n\r\n\"You are young; you are beautiful; you are a widow. This is for the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n\"You will marry again; you will die young, and by a violent death. This\r\nis for the future.\r\n\r\n\"THE SPIRIT.\"\r\n\r\nThe answer was written upon a paper like that upon which the questions\r\nhad been set down.\r\n\r\nThe marquise turned pale and uttered a faint cry of terror; the answer\r\nwas so perfectly correct in regard to the past as to call up a fear that\r\nit might be equally accurate in regard to the future.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that the unknown lady wrapped in a mantle whom we have\r\nescorted into the modern sibyl’s cavern was no other than the beautiful\r\nMarie de Rossan, who before her marriage had borne the name of\r\nMademoiselle de Chateaublanc, from that of an estate belonging to her\r\nmaternal grandfather, M. Joannis de Nocheres, who owned a fortune of\r\nfive to six hundred thousand livres. At the age of thirteen—that is to\r\nsay, in 1649—she had married the Marquis de Castellane, a gentleman of\r\nvery high birth, who claimed to be descended from John of Castille, the\r\nson of Pedro the Cruel, and from Juana de Castro, his mistress. Proud of\r\nhis young wife’s beauty, the Marquis de Castellane, who was an officer\r\nof the king’s galleys, had hastened to present her at court. Louis XIV,\r\nwho at the time of her presentation was barely twenty years old, was\r\nstruck by her enchanting face, and to the great despair of the famous\r\nbeauties of the day danced with her three times in one evening. Finally,\r\nas a crowning touch to her reputation, the famous Christina of Sweden,\r\nwho was then at the French court, said of her that she had never, in any\r\nof the kingdoms through which she had passed, seen anything equal to\r\n\"the beautiful Provencale.\" This praise had been so well received, that\r\nthe name of \"the beautiful Provencale\" had clung to Madame de\r\nCastellane, and she was everywhere known by it.\r\n\r\nThis favour of Louis XIV and this summing up of Christina’s had been\r\nenough to bring the Marquise de Castellane instantly into fashion; and\r\nMignard, who had just received a patent of nobility and been made\r\npainter to the king, put the seal to her celebrity by asking leave to\r\npaint her portrait. That portrait still exists, and gives a perfect\r\nnotion of the beauty which it represents; but as the portrait is far\r\nfrom our readers’ eyes, we will content ourselves by repeating, in its\r\nown original words, the one given in 1667 by the author of a pamphlet\r\npublished at Rouen under the following title: True and Principal\r\nCircumstances of the Deplorable Death of Madame the Marquise de Ganges:\r\n\r\n[Note: It is from this pamphlet, and from the Account of the Death of\r\nMadame the Marquise de Ganges, formerly Marquise de Castellane, that we\r\nhave borrowed the principal circumstances of this tragic story. To these\r\ndocuments we must add—that we may not be constantly referring our\r\nreaders to original sources—the Celebrated Trials by Guyot de Pitaval,\r\nthe Life of Marie de Rossan, and the Lettres galantes of Madame\r\nDesnoyers.]\r\n\r\n\"Her complexion, which was of a dazzling whiteness, was illumined by not\r\ntoo brilliant a red, and art itself could not have arranged more\r\nskilfully the gradations by which this red joined and merged into the\r\nwhiteness of the complexion. The brilliance of her face was heightened\r\nby the decided blackness of her hair, growing, as though drawn by a\r\npainter of the finest taste, around a well proportioned brow; her large,\r\nwell opened eyes were of the same hue as her hair, and shone with a soft\r\nand piercing flame that rendered it impossible to gaze upon her\r\nsteadily; the smallness, the shape, the turn of her mouth, and, the\r\nbeauty of her teeth were incomparable; the position and the regular\r\nproportion of her nose added to her beauty such an air of dignity, as\r\ninspired a respect for her equal to the love that might be inspired by\r\nher beauty; the rounded contour of her face, produced by a becoming\r\nplumpness, exhibited all the vigour and freshness of health; to complete\r\nher charms, her glances, the movements of her lips and of her head,\r\nappeared to be guided by the graces; her shape corresponded to the\r\nbeauty of her face; lastly, her arms, her hands, her bearing, and her\r\ngait were such that nothing further could be wished to complete the\r\nagreeable presentment of a beautiful woman.\"\r\n\r\n[Note: All her contemporaries, indeed, are in agreement as to her\r\nmarvellous beauty; here is a second portrait of the marquise, delineated\r\nin a style and manner still more characteristic of that period:—\r\n\r\n\"You will remember that she had a complexion smoother and finer than a\r\nmirror, that her whiteness was so well commingled with the lively blood\r\nas to produce an exact admixture never beheld elsewhere, and imparting\r\nto her countenance the tenderest animation; her eyes and hair were\r\nblacker than jet; her eyes, I say, of which the gaze could scarce, from\r\ntheir excess of lustre, be supported, which have been celebrated as a\r\nmiracle of tenderness and sprightliness, which have given rise, a\r\nthousand times, to the finest compliments of the day, and have been the\r\ntorment of many a rash man, must excuse me, if I do not pause longer to\r\npraise them, in a letter; her mouth was the feature of her face which\r\ncompelled the most critical to avow that they had seen none of equal\r\nperfection, and that, by its shape, its smallness, and its brilliance,\r\nit might furnish a pattern for all those others whose sweetness and\r\ncharms had been so highly vaunted; her nose conformed to the fair\r\nproportion of all her features; it was, that is to say, the finest in\r\nthe world; the whole shape of her face was perfectly round, and of so\r\ncharming a fullness that such an assemblage of beauties was never before\r\nseen together. The expression of this head was one of unparalleled\r\nsweetness and of a majesty which she softened rather by disposition than\r\nby study; her figure was opulent, her speech agreeable, her step noble,\r\nher demeanour easy, her temper sociable, her wit devoid of malice, and\r\nfounded upon great goodness of heart.\"]\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand that a woman thus endowed could not, in a court\r\nwhere gallantry was more pursued than in any other spot in the world,\r\nescape the calumnies of rivals; such calumnies, however, never produced\r\nany result, so correctly, even in the absence of her husband, did the\r\nmarquise contrive to conduct herself; her cold and serious conversation,\r\nrather concise than lively, rather solid than brilliant, contrasted,\r\nindeed, with the light turn, the capricious and fanciful expressions\r\nemployed by the wits of that time; the consequence was that those who\r\nhad failed to succeed with her, tried to spread a report that the\r\nmarquise was merely a beautiful idol, virtuous with the virtue of a\r\nstatue. But though such things might be said and repeated in the absence\r\nof the marquise, from the moment that she appeared in a drawing-room,\r\nfrom the moment that her beautiful eyes and sweet smile added their\r\nindefinable expression to those brief, hurried, and sensible words that\r\nfell from her lips, the most prejudiced came back to her and were forced\r\nto own that God had never before created anything that so nearly touched\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nShe was thus in the enjoyment of a triumph that backbiters failed to\r\nshake, and that scandal vainly sought to tarnish, when news came of the\r\nwreck of the French galleys in Sicilian waters, and of the death of the\r\nMarquis de Castellane, who was in command. The marquise on this\r\noccasion, as usual, displayed the greatest piety and propriety: although\r\nshe had no very violent passion for her husband, with whom she had spent\r\nscarcely one of the seven years during which their marriage had lasted,\r\non receipt of the news she went at once into retreat, going to live with\r\nMadame d’Ampus, her mother-in-law, and ceasing not only to receive\r\nvisitors but also to go out.\r\n\r\nSix months after the death of her husband, the marquise received letters\r\nfrom her grandfather, M. Joannis de Nocheres, begging her to come and\r\nfinish her time of mourning at Avignon. Having been fatherless almost\r\nfrom childhood, Mademoiselle de Chateaublanc had been brought up by this\r\ngood old man, whom she loved dearly; she hastened accordingly to accede\r\nto his invitation, and prepared everything for her departure.\r\n\r\nThis was at the moment when la Voisin, still a young woman, and far from\r\nhaving the reputation which she subsequently acquired, was yet beginning\r\nto be talked of. Several friends of the Marquise de Castellane had been\r\nto consult her, and had received strange predictions from her, some of\r\nwhich, either through the art of her who framed them, or through some\r\nodd concurrence of circumstances, had come true. The marquise could not\r\nresist the curiosity with which various tales that she had heard of this\r\nwoman’s powers had inspired her, and some days before setting out for\r\nAvignon she made the visit which we have narrated. What answer she\r\nreceived to her questions we have seen.\r\n\r\nThe marquise was not superstitious, yet this fatal prophecy impressed\r\nitself upon her mind and left behind a deep trace, which neither the\r\npleasure of revisiting her native place, nor the affection of her\r\ngrandfather, nor the fresh admiration which she did not fail to receive,\r\ncould succeed in removing; indeed, this fresh admiration was a weariness\r\nto the marquise, and before long she begged leave of her grandfather to\r\nretire into a convent and to spend there the last three months of her\r\nmourning.\r\n\r\nIt was in that place, and it was with the warmth of these poor\r\ncloistered maidens, that she heard a man spoken of for the first time,\r\nwhose reputation for beauty, as a man, was equal to her own, as a woman.\r\nThis favourite of nature was the sieur de Lenide, Marquis de Ganges,\r\nBaron of Languedoc, and governor of Saint-Andre, in the diocese of Uzes.\r\nThe marquise heard of him so often, and it was so frequently declared to\r\nher that nature seemed to have formed them for each other, that she\r\nbegan to allow admission to a very strong desire of seeing him.\r\nDoubtless, the sieur de Lenide, stimulated by similar suggestions, had\r\nconceived a great wish to meet the marquise; for, having got M. de\r\nNocheres who no doubt regretted her prolonged retreat—to entrust him\r\nwith a commission for his granddaughter, he came to the convent parlour\r\nand asked for the fair recluse. She, although she had never seen him,\r\nrecognised him at the first glance; for having never seen so handsome a\r\ncavalier as he who now presented himself before her, she thought this\r\ncould be no other than the Marquis de Ganges, of whom people had so\r\noften spoken to her.\r\n\r\nThat which was to happen, happened: the Marquise de Castellane and the\r\nMarquis de Ganges could not look upon each other without loving. Both\r\nwere young, the marquis was noble and in a good position, the marquise\r\nwas rich; everything in the match, therefore, seemed suitable: and\r\nindeed it was deferred only for the space of time necessary to complete\r\nthe year of mourning, and the marriage was celebrated towards the\r\nbeginning of the year 1658. The marquis was twenty years of age, and the\r\nmarquise twenty-two.\r\n\r\nThe beginnings of this union were perfectly happy; the marquis was in\r\nlove for the first time, and the marquise did not remember ever to have\r\nbeen in love. A son and a daughter came to complete their happiness. The\r\nmarquise had entirely forgotten the fatal prediction, or, if she\r\noccasionally thought of it now, it was to wonder that she could ever\r\nhave believed in it. Such happiness is not of this world, and when by\r\nchance it lingers here a while, it seems sent rather by the anger than\r\nby the goodness of God. Better, indeed, would it be for him who\r\npossesses and who loses it, never to have known it.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis de Ganges was the first to weary of this happy life. Little\r\nby little he began to miss the pleasures of a young man; he began to\r\ndraw away from the marquise and to draw nearer to his former friends. On\r\nher part, the marquise, who for the sake of wedded intimacy had\r\nsacrificed her habits of social life, threw herself into society, where\r\nnew triumphs awaited her. These triumphs aroused the jealousy of the\r\nmarquis; but he was too much a man of his century to invite ridicule by\r\nany manifestation; he shut his jealousy into his soul, and it emerged in\r\na different form on every different occasion. To words of love, so sweet\r\nthat they seemed the speech of angels, succeeded those bitter and biting\r\nutterances that foretell approaching division. Before long, the marquis\r\nand the marquise only saw each other at hours when they could not avoid\r\nmeeting; then, on the pretext of necessary journeys, and presently\r\nwithout any pretext at all, the marquis would go away for three-quarters\r\nof a year, and once more the marquise found herself widowed. Whatever\r\ncontemporary account one may consult, one finds them all agreeing to\r\ndeclare that she was always the same—that is to say, full of patience,\r\ncalmness, and becoming behaviour—and it is rare to find such a unanimity\r\nof opinion about a young and beautiful woman.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the marquis, finding it unendurable to be alone with his\r\nwife during the short spaces of time which he spent at home, invited his\r\ntwo brothers, the chevalier and the abbe de Ganges, to come and live\r\nwith him. He had a third brother, who, as the second son, bore the title\r\nof comte, and who was colonel of the Languedoc regiment, but as this\r\ngentleman played no part in this story we shall not concern ourselves\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nThe abbe de Ganges, who bore that title without belonging to the Church,\r\nhad assumed it in order to enjoy its privileges: he was a kind of wit,\r\nwriting madrigals and ’bouts-rimes’ [Bouts-rimes are verses written to a\r\ngiven set of rhymes.] on occasion, a handsome man enough, though in\r\nmoments of impatience his eyes would take a strangely cruel expression;\r\nas dissolute and shameless to boot, as though he had really belonged to\r\nthe clergy of the period.\r\n\r\nThe chevalier de Ganges, who shared in some measure the beauty so\r\nprofusely showered upon the family, was one of those feeble men who\r\nenjoy their own nullity, and grow on to old age inapt alike for good and\r\nevil, unless some nature of a stronger stamp lays hold on them and drags\r\nthem like faint and pallid satellites in its wake. This was what befell\r\nthe chevalier in respect of his brother: submitted to an influence of\r\nwhich he himself was not aware, and against which, had he but suspected\r\nit, he would have rebelled with the obstinacy of a child, he was a\r\nmachine obedient to the will of another mind and to the passions of\r\nanother heart, a machine which was all the more terrible in that no\r\nmovement of instinct or of reason could, in his case, arrest the impulse\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nMoreover, this influence which the abbe had acquired over the chevalier\r\nextended, in some degree also, to the marquis. Having as a younger son\r\nno fortune, having no revenue, for though he wore a Churchman’s robes he\r\ndid not fulfil a Churchman’s functions, he had succeeded in persuading\r\nthe marquis, who was rich, not only in the enjoyment of his own fortune,\r\nbut also in that of his wife, which was likely to be nearly doubled at\r\nthe death of M. de Nocheres, that some zealous man was needed who would\r\ndevote himself to the ordering of his house and the management of his\r\nproperty; and had offered himself for the post. The marquis had very\r\ngladly accepted, being, as we have said, tired by this time of his\r\nsolitary home life; and the abbe had brought with him the chevalier, who\r\nfollowed him like his shadow, and who was no more regarded than if he\r\nhad really possessed no body.\r\n\r\nThe marquise often confessed afterwards that when she first saw these\r\ntwo men, although their outward aspect was perfectly agreeable, she felt\r\nherself seized by a painful impression, and that the fortune-teller’s\r\nprediction of a violent death, which she had so long forgotten, gashed\r\nout like lightning before her eyes. The effect on the two brothers was\r\nnot of the same kind: the beauty of the marquise struck them both,\r\nalthough in different ways. The chevalier was in ecstasies of\r\nadmiration, as though before a beautiful statue, but the impression that\r\nshe made upon him was that which would have been made by marble, and if\r\nthe chevalier had been left to himself the consequences of this\r\nadmiration would have been no less harmless. Moreover, the chevalier did\r\nnot attempt either to exaggerate or to conceal this impression, and\r\nallowed his sister-in-law to see in what manner she struck him. The\r\nabbe, on the contrary, was seized at first sight with a deep and violent\r\ndesire to possess this woman—the most beautiful whom he had ever met;\r\nbut being as perfectly capable of mastering his sensations as the\r\nchevalier was incapable, he merely allowed such words of compliment to\r\nescape him as weigh neither with him who utters nor her who hears them;\r\nand yet, before the close of this first interview, the abbe had decided\r\nin his irrevocable will that this woman should be his.\r\n\r\nAs for the marquise, although the impression produced by her two\r\nbrothers-in-law could never be entirely effaced, the wit of the abbe, to\r\nwhich he gave, with amazing facility, whatever turn he chose, and the\r\ncomplete nullity of the chevalier brought her to certain feelings of\r\nless repulsion towards them: for indeed the marquise had one of those\r\nsouls which never suspect evil, as long as it will take the trouble to\r\nassume any veil at all of seeming, and which only recognise it with\r\nregret when it resumes its true shape.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the arrival of these two new inmates soon spread a little more\r\nlife and gaiety through the house. Furthermore; greatly to the\r\nastonishment of the marquise, her husband, who had so long been\r\nindifferent to her beauty, seemed to remark afresh that she was too\r\ncharming to be despised; his words accordingly began little by little to\r\nexpress an affection that had long since gradually disappeared from\r\nthem. The marquise had never ceased to love him; she had suffered the\r\nloss of his love with resignation, she hailed its return with joy, and\r\nthree months elapsed that resembled those which had long ceased to be\r\nmore to the poor wife than a distant and half-worn-out memory.\r\n\r\nThus she had, with the supreme facility of youth, always ready to be\r\nhappy, taken up her gladness again, without even asking what genius had\r\nbrought back to her the treasure which she had thought lost, when she\r\nreceived an invitation from a lady of the neighbourhood to spend some\r\ndays in her country house. Her husband and her two brothers-in-law,\r\ninvited with her, were of the party, and accompanied her. A great\r\nhunting party had been arranged beforehand, and almost immediately upon\r\narriving everyone began to prepare for taking part in it.\r\n\r\nThe abbe, whose talents had made him indispensable in every company,\r\ndeclared that for that day he was the marquise’s cavalier, a title which\r\nhis sister-in-law, with her usual amiability, confirmed. Each of the\r\nhuntsmen, following this example, made choice of a lady to whom to\r\ndedicate his attentions throughout the day; then, this chivalrous\r\narrangement being completed, all present directed their course towards\r\nthe place of meeting.\r\n\r\nThat happened which almost always happens the dogs hunted on their own\r\naccount. Two or three sportsmen only followed the dogs; the rest got\r\nlost. The abbe, in his character of esquire to the marquise, had not\r\nleft her for a moment, and had managed so cleverly that he was alone\r\nwith her—an opportunity which he had been seeking for a month previously\r\nwith no less care—than the marquise had been using to avoid it. No\r\nsooner, therefore, did the marquise believe herself aware that the abbe\r\nhad intentionally turned aside from the hunt than she attempted to\r\ngallop her horse in the opposite direction from that which she had been\r\nfollowing; but the abbe stopped her. The marquise neither could nor\r\nwould enter upon a struggle; she resigned herself, therefore, to hearing\r\nwhat the abbe had to say to her, and her face assumed that air of\r\nhaughty disdain which women so well know how to put on when they wish a\r\nman to understand that he has nothing to hope from them. There was an\r\ninstant’s silence; the abbe was the first to break it.\r\n\r\n\"Madame,\" said he, \"I ask your pardon for having used this means to\r\nspeak to you alone; but since, in spite of my rank of brother-in-law,\r\nyou did not seem inclined to grant me that favour if I had asked it, I\r\nthought it would be better for me, to deprive you of the power to refuse\r\nit me.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you have hesitated to ask me so simple a thing, monsieur,\" replied\r\nthe marquise, \"and if you have taken such precautions to compel me to\r\nlisten to you, it must, no doubt, be because you knew beforehand that\r\nthe words you had to say to me were such as I could not hear. Have the\r\ngoodness, therefore, to reflect, before you open this conversation, that\r\nhere as elsewhere I reserve the right—and I warn you of it—to interrupt\r\nwhat you may say at the moment when it may cease to seem to me\r\nbefitting.\"\r\n\r\n\"As to that, madame,\" said the abbe, \"I think I can answer for it that\r\nwhatever it may please me to say to you, you will hear to the end; but\r\nindeed the matters are so simple that there is no need to make you\r\nuneasy beforehand: I wished to ask you, madame, whether you have\r\nperceived a change in the conduct of your husband towards you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" replied the marquise, \"and no single day has passed in\r\nwhich I have not thanked Heaven for this happiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you have been wrong, madame,\" returned the abbe, with one of those\r\nsmiles that were peculiar to himself; \"Heaven has nothing to do with it.\r\nThank Heaven for having made you the most beautiful and charming of\r\nwomen, and that will be enough thanksgiving without despoiling me of\r\nsuch as belong to my share.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not understand you, monsieur,\" said the marquise in an icy tone.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I will make myself comprehensible, my dear sister-in-law. I am\r\nthe worker of the miracle for which you are thanking Heaven; to me\r\ntherefore belongs your gratitude. Heaven is rich enough not to rob the\r\npoor.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, monsieur: if it is really to you that I owe this return,\r\nthe cause of which I did not know, I will thank you in the first place;\r\nand then afterwards I will thank Heaven for having inspired you with\r\nthis good thought.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered the abbe, \"but Heaven, which has inspired me with a good\r\nthought, may equally well inspire me with a bad one, if the good thought\r\ndoes not bring me what I expect from it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, monsieur?\"\r\n\r\n\"That there has never been more than one will in the family, and that\r\nwill is mine; that the minds of my two brothers turn according to the\r\nfancy of that will like weathercocks before the wind, and that he who\r\nhas blown hot can blow cold.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am still waiting for you to explain yourself, monsieur.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, my dear sister-in-law, since you are pleased not to\r\nunderstand me, I will explain myself more clearly. My brother turned\r\nfrom you through jealousy; I wished to give you an idea of my power over\r\nhim, and from extreme indifference I have brought him back, by showing\r\nhim that he suspected you wrongly, to the ardours of the warmest love.\r\nWell, I need only tell him that I was mistaken, and fix his wandering\r\nsuspicions upon any man whatever, and I shall take him away from you,\r\neven as I have brought him back. I need give you no proof of what I say;\r\nyou know perfectly well that I am speaking the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what object had you, in acting this part?\"\r\n\r\n\"To prove to you, madame, that at my will I can cause you to be sad or\r\njoyful, cherished or neglected, adored or hated. Madame, listen to me: I\r\nlove you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You insult me, monsieur!\" cried the marquise, trying to withdraw the\r\nbridle of her horse from the abbe’s hands.\r\n\r\n\"No fine words, my dear sister-in-law; for, with me, I warn you, they\r\nwill be lost. To tell a woman one loves her is never an insult; only\r\nthere are a thousand different ways of obliging her to respond to that\r\nlove. The error is to make a mistake in the way that one employs—that is\r\nthe whole of the matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"And may I inquire which you have chosen?\" asked the marquise, with a\r\ncrushing smile of contempt.\r\n\r\n\"The only one that could succeed with a calm, cold, strong woman like\r\nyou, the conviction that your interest requires you to respond to my\r\nlove.\"\r\n\r\n\"Since you profess to know me so well,\" answered the marquise, with\r\nanother effort, as unsuccessful as the former, to free the bridle of her\r\nhorse, \"you should know how a woman like me would receive such an\r\noverture; say to yourself what I might say to you, and above all, what I\r\nmight say to my husband.\"\r\n\r\nThe abbe smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, as to that,\" he returned, \"you can do as you please, madame. Tell\r\nyour husband whatever you choose; repeat our conversation word for word;\r\nadd whatever your memory may furnish, true or false, that may be most\r\nconvincing against me; then, when you have thoroughly given him his cue,\r\nwhen you think yourself sure of him, I will say two words to him, and\r\nturn him inside out like this glove. That is what I had to say to you,\r\nmadame I will not detain you longer. You may have in me a devoted friend\r\nor a mortal enemy. Reflect.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words the abbe loosed his hold upon the bridle of the\r\nmarquise’s horse and left her free to guide it as she would. The\r\nmarquise put her beast to a trot, so as to show neither fear nor haste.\r\nThe abbe followed her, and both rejoined the hunt.\r\n\r\nThe abbe had spoken truly. The marquise, notwithstanding the threat\r\nwhich she had made, reflected upon the influence which this man had over\r\nher husband, and of which she had often had proof she kept silence,\r\ntherefore, and hoped that he had made himself seem worse than he was, to\r\nfrighten her. On this point she was strangely mistaken.\r\n\r\nThe abbe, however, wished to see, in the first place, whether the\r\nmarquise’s refusal was due to personal antipathy or to real virtue. The\r\nchevalier, as has been said, was handsome; he had that usage of good\r\nsociety which does instead of mind, and he joined to it the obstinacy of\r\na stupid man; the abbe undertook to persuade him that he was in love\r\nwith the marquise. It was not a difficult matter. We have described the\r\nimpression made upon the chevalier by the first sight of Madame de\r\nGanges; but, owing beforehand the reputation of austerity that his\r\nsister-in-law had acquired, he had not the remotest idea of paying court\r\nto her. Yielding, indeed, to the influence which she exercised upon all\r\nwho came in contact with her, the chevalier had remained her devoted\r\nservant; and the marquise, having no reason to mistrust civilities which\r\nshe took for signs of friendliness, and considering his position as her\r\nhusband’s brother, treated him with less circumspection than was her\r\ncustom.\r\n\r\nThe abbe sought him out, and, having made sure they were alone, said,\r\n\"Chevalier, we both love the same woman, and that woman is our brother’s\r\nwife; do not let us thwart each other: I am master of my passion, and\r\ncan the more easily sacrifice it to you that I believe you are the man\r\npreferred; try, therefore, to obtain some assurance of the love which I\r\nsuspect the marquise of having for you; and from the day when you reach\r\nthat point I will withdraw, but otherwise, if you fail, give up your\r\nplace civilly to me, that I may try, in my turn, whether her heart is\r\nreally impregnable, as everybody says.\"\r\n\r\nThe chevalier had never thought of the possibility of winning the\r\nmarquise; but from the moment in which his brother, with no apparent\r\nmotive of personal interest, aroused the idea that he might be beloved,\r\nevery spark of passion and of vanity that still existed in this\r\nautomaton took fire, and he began to be doubly assiduous and attentive\r\nto his sister-in-law. She, who had never suspected any evil in this\r\nquarter, treated the chevalier at first with a kindliness that was\r\nheightened by her scorn for the abbe. But, before long, the chevalier,\r\nmisunderstanding the grounds of this kindliness, explained himself more\r\nclearly. The marquise, amazed and at first incredulous, allowed him to\r\nsay enough to make his intentions perfectly clear; then she stopped him,\r\nas she had done the abbe, by some of those galling words which women\r\nderive from their indifference even more than from their virtue.\r\n\r\nAt this check, the chevalier, who was far from possessing his brother’s\r\nstrength and determination, lost all hope, and came candidly to own to\r\nthe latter the sad result of his attentions and his love. This was what\r\nthe abbe had awaited, in the first place for the satisfaction of his own\r\nvanity, and in the second place for the means of carrying out his\r\nschemes. He worked upon the chevalier’s humiliation until he had wrought\r\nit into a solid hatred; and then, sure of having him for a supporter and\r\neven for an accomplice, he began to put into execution his plan against\r\nthe marquise.\r\n\r\nThe consequence was soon shown in a renewal of alienation on the part of\r\nM. de Ganges. A young man whom the marquise sometimes met in society,\r\nand to whom, on account of his wit, she listened perhaps a little more\r\nwillingly than to others, became, if not the cause, at least the excuse\r\nof a fresh burst of jealousy. This jealousy was exhibited as on previous\r\noccasions, by quarrels remote from the real grievance; but the marquise\r\nwas not deceived: she recognised in this change the fatal hand of her\r\nbrother-in-law. But this certainty, instead of drawing her towards him,\r\nincreased her repulsion; and thenceforward she lost no opportunity of\r\nshowing him not only that repulsion but also the contempt that\r\naccompanied it.\r\n\r\nMatters remained in this state for some months. Every day the marquise\r\nperceived her husband growing colder, and although the spies were\r\ninvisible she felt herself surrounded by a watchfulness that took note\r\nof the most private details of her life. As to the abbe and the\r\nchevalier, they were as usual; only the abbe had hidden his hate behind\r\na smile that was habitual, and the chevalier his resentment behind that\r\ncold and stiff dignity in which dull minds enfold themselves when they\r\nbelieve themselves injured in their vanity.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all this, M. Joannis de Nocheres died, and added to the\r\nalready considerable fortune of his granddaughter another fortune of\r\nfrom six to seven hundred thousand livres.\r\n\r\nThis additional wealth became, on accruing to the marquise, what was\r\nthen called, in countries where the Roman law prevailed, a ’paraphernal’\r\nestate that is to say that, falling in, after marriage, it was not\r\nincluded in the dowry brought by the wife, and that she could dispose\r\nfreely both of the capital and the income, which might not be\r\nadministered even by her husband without a power of attorney, and of\r\nwhich she could dispose at pleasure, by donation or by will. And in\r\nfact, a few days after the marquise had entered into possession of her\r\ngrandfather’s estate, her husband and his brothers learned that she had\r\nsent for a notary in order to be instructed as to her rights. This step\r\nbetokened an intention of separating this inheritance from the common\r\nproperty of the marriage; for the behaviour of the marquis towards his\r\nwife—of which within himself he often recognised the injustice—left him\r\nlittle hope of any other explanation.\r\n\r\nAbout this time a strange event happened. At a dinner given by the\r\nmarquise, a cream was served at dessert: all those who partook of this\r\ncream were ill; the marquis and his two brothers, who had not touched\r\nit, felt no evil effects. The remainder of this cream, which was\r\nsuspected of having caused illness to the guests, and particularly to\r\nthe marquise, who had taken of it twice, was analysed, and the presence\r\nof arsenic in it demonstrated. Only, having been mixed with milk, which\r\nis its antidote, the poison had lost some of its power, and had produced\r\nbut half the expected effect. As no serious disaster had followed this\r\noccurrence, the blame was thrown upon a servant, who was said to have\r\nmistaken arsenic for sugar, and everybody forgot it, or appeared to\r\nforget it.\r\n\r\nThe marquis, however, seemed to be gradually and naturally drawing\r\nnearer again to his wife; but this time Madame de Ganges was not\r\ndeceived by his returning kindness. There, as in his alienation, she saw\r\nthe selfish hand of the abbe: he had persuaded his brother that seven\r\nhundred thousand livres more in the house would make it worth while to\r\noverlook some levities of behaviour; and the marquis, obeying the\r\nimpulse given, was trying, by kind dealing, to oppose his wife’s still\r\nunsettled intention of making a will.\r\n\r\nTowards the autumn there was talk of going to spend that season at\r\nGanges, a little town situated in Lower Languedoc, in the diocese of\r\nMontpellier, seven leagues from that town, and nineteen from Avignon.\r\nAlthough this was natural enough, since the marquis was lord of the town\r\nand had a castle there, the marquise was seized by a strange shudder\r\nwhen she heard the proposal. Remembrance of the prediction made to her\r\nreturned immediately to her mind. The recent and ill explained attempt\r\nto poison her, too, very naturally added to her fears.\r\n\r\nWithout directly and positively suspecting her brothers-in-law of that\r\ncrime, she knew that in them she had two implacable enemies. This\r\njourney to a little town, this abode in a lonely castle, amid new,\r\nunknown neighbours, seemed to her of no good omen; but open opposition\r\nwould have been ridiculous. On what grounds, indeed, could she base\r\nresistance? The marquise could only own her terrors by accusing her\r\nhusband and her brothers-in-law. And of what could she accuse them? The\r\nincident of the poisoned cream was not a conclusive proof. She resolved\r\naccordingly to lock up all her fears in her heart, and to commit herself\r\nto the hands of God.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, she would not leave Avignon without signing the will which\r\nshe had contemplated making ever since M. de Nocheres’ death. A notary\r\nwas called in who drew up the document. The Marquise de Ganges made her\r\nmother, Madame de Rossan, her sole inheritor, and left in her charge the\r\nduty of choosing between the testatrix’s two children as to which of\r\nthem should succeed to the estate. These two children were, one a boy of\r\nsix years old, the other a girl of five. But this was not enough for the\r\nmarquise, so deep was her impression that she would not survive this\r\nfatal journey; she gathered together, secretly and at night, the\r\nmagistrates of Avignon and several persons of quality, belonging to the\r\nfirst families of the town, and there, before them, verbally at first,\r\ndeclared that, in case of her death, she begged the honourable witnesses\r\nwhom she had assembled on purpose, not to recognise as valid, voluntary,\r\nor freely written anything except the will which she had signed the day\r\nbefore, and affirmed beforehand that any later will which might be\r\nproduced would be the effect of fraud or of violence. Then, having made\r\nthis verbal declaration, the marquise repeated it in writing, signed the\r\npaper containing it, and gave the paper to be preserved by the honour of\r\nthose whom she constituted its guardians. Such a precaution, taken with\r\nsuch minute detail, aroused the lively curiosity of her hearers. Many\r\npressing questions were put to the marquise, but nothing could be\r\nextracted from her except that she had reasons for her action which she\r\ncould not declare. The cause of this assemblage remained a secret, and\r\nevery person who formed part of it promised the marquise not to reveal\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOn the next day, which was that preceding her departure for Ganges, the\r\nmarquise visited all the charitable institutions and religious\r\ncommunities in Avignon; she left liberal alms everywhere, with the\r\nrequest that prayers and masses should be said for her, in order to\r\nobtain from God’s grace that she should not be suffered to die without\r\nreceiving the sacraments of the Church. In the evening, she took leave\r\nof all her friends with the affection and the tears of a person\r\nconvinced that she was bidding them a last farewell; and finally she\r\nspent the whole night in prayer, and the maid who came to wake her found\r\nher kneeling in the same spot where she, had left her the night before.\r\n\r\nThe family set out for Ganges; the journey was performed without\r\naccident. On reaching the castle, the marquise found her mother-in-law\r\nthere; she was a woman of remarkable distinction and piety, and her\r\npresence, although it was to be but temporary, reassured the poor\r\nfearful marquise a little. Arrangements had been made beforehand at the\r\nold castle, and the most convenient and elegant of the rooms had been\r\nassigned to the marquise; it was on the first floor, and looked out upon\r\na courtyard shut in on all sides by stables.\r\n\r\nOn the first evening that she was to sleep here, the marquise explored\r\nthe room with the greatest attention. She inspected the cupboards,\r\nsounded the walls, examined the tapestry, and found nothing anywhere\r\nthat could confirm her terrors, which, indeed, from that time began to\r\ndecrease. At the end of a certain time; however, the marquis’s mother\r\nleft Ganges to return to Montpellier. Two, days after her departure, the\r\nmarquis talked of important business which required him to go back to\r\nAvignon, and he too left the castle. The marquise thus remained alone\r\nwith the abbe, the chevalier, and a chaplain named Perette, who had been\r\nattached for five-and-twenty years to the family of the marquis. The\r\nrest of the household consisted of a few servants.\r\n\r\nThe marquise’s first care, on arriving at the castle, had been to\r\ncollect a little society for herself in the town. This was easy: not\r\nonly did her rank make it an honour to belong to her circle, her kindly\r\ngraciousness also inspired at first-sight the desire of having her for a\r\nfriend. The marquise thus endured less dulness than she had at first\r\nfeared. This precaution was by no means uncalled for; instead of\r\nspending only the autumn at Ganges, the marquise was obliged, in\r\nconsequence of letters from her husband, to spend the winter there.\r\nDuring the whole of this time the abbe and the chevalier seemed to have\r\ncompletely forgotten their original designs upon her, and had again\r\nresumed the conduct of respectful, attentive brothers. But with all\r\nthis, M. de Ganges remained estranged, and the marquise, who had not\r\nceased to love him, though she began to lose her fear, did not lose her\r\ngrief.\r\n\r\nOne day the abbe entered her room suddenly enough to surprise her before\r\nshe had time to dry her tears; the secret being thus half surprised, he\r\neasily obtained a knowledge of the whole. The marquise owned to him that\r\nhappiness in this world was impossible for her so long as her husband\r\nled this separate and hostile life. The abbe tried to console her; but\r\namid his consolations he told her that the grief which she was suffering\r\nhad its source in herself; that her husband was naturally wounded by her\r\ndistrust of him—a distrust of which the will, executed by her, was a\r\nproof, all the more humiliating because public, and that, while that\r\nwill existed, she could expect no advances towards reconciliation from\r\nher husband. For that time the conversation ended there.\r\n\r\nSome days later, the abbe came into the marquise’s room with a letter\r\nwhich he had just received from his brother. This letter, supposed\r\nconfidential, was filled with tender complaints of his wife’s conduct\r\ntowards him, and showed, through every sentence, a depth of affection\r\nwhich only wrongs as serious as those from which the marquis considered\r\nhimself to be feeling could counterbalance. The marquise was, at first,\r\nvery much touched by this letter; but having soon reflected that just\r\nsufficient time had elapsed since the explanation between herself and\r\nthe abbe for the marquis to be informed of it, she awaited further and\r\nstronger proofs before changing her mind.\r\n\r\nFrom day to day, however, the abbe, under the pretext of reconciling the\r\nhusband and wife, became more pressing upon the matter of the will, and\r\nthe marquise, to whom this insistence seemed rather alarming, began to\r\nexperience some of her former fears. Finally, the abbe pressed her so\r\nhard as to make her reflect that since, after the precautions which she\r\nhad taken at Avignon, a revocation could have no result, it would be\r\nbetter to seem to yield rather than irritate this man, who inspired her\r\nwith so great a fear, by constant and obstinate refusals. The next time\r\nthat he returned to the subject she accordingly replied that she was\r\nready to offer her husband this new proof of her love if it would bring\r\nhim back to her, and having ordered a notary to be sent for, she made a\r\nnew will, in the presence of the abbe and the chevalier, and constituted\r\nthe marquis her residuary legatee. This second instrument bore date the\r\n5th of May 1667. The abbe and the chevalier expressed the greatest joy\r\nthat this subject of discord was at last removed, and offered themselves\r\nas guarantees, on their brother’s behalf, of a better future. Some days\r\nwere passed in this hope, which a letter from the marquis came to\r\nconfirm; this letter at the same time announced his speedy return to\r\nGanges.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of May; the marquise, who for a month or two had not been\r\nwell, determined to take medicine; she therefore informed the chemist of\r\nwhat she wanted, and asked him to make her up something at his\r\ndiscretion and send it to her the next day. Accordingly, at the agreed\r\nhour in the morning, the draught was brought to the marquise; but it\r\nlooked to her so black and so thick that she felt some doubt of the\r\nskill of its compounder, shut it up in a cupboard in her room without\r\nsaying anything of the matter, and took from her dressing-case some\r\npills, of a less efficacious nature indeed, but to which she was\r\naccustomed, and which were not so repugnant to her.\r\n\r\nThe hour in which the marquise was to take this medicine was hardly over\r\nwhen the abbe and the chevalier sent to know how she was. She replied\r\nthat she was quite well, and invited them to a collation which she was\r\ngiving about four o’clock to the ladies who made up her little circle.\r\nAn hour afterwards the abbe and the chevalier sent a second time to\r\ninquire after her; the marquise, without paying particular attention to\r\nthis excessive civility, which she remembered afterwards, sent word as\r\nbefore that she was perfectly well. The marquise had remained in bed to\r\ndo the honours of her little feast, and never had she felt more\r\ncheerful. At the hour named all her guests arrived; the abbe and the\r\nchevalier were ushered in, and the meal was served. Neither one nor the\r\nother would share it; the abbe indeed sat down to table, but the\r\nchevalier remained leaning on the foot of the bed. The abbe appeared\r\nanxious, and only roused himself with a start from his absorption; then\r\nhe seemed to drive away some dominant idea, but soon the idea, stronger\r\nthan his will, plunged him again into a reverie, a state which struck\r\neveryone the more particularly because it was far from his usual temper.\r\nAs to the chevalier, his eyes were fixed constantly upon his\r\nsister-in-law, but in this there was not, as in his brother’s behaviour,\r\nanything surprising, since the marquise had never looked so beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe meal over, the company took leave. The abbe escorted the ladies\r\ndownstairs; the chevalier remained with the marquise; but hardly had the\r\nabbe left the room when Madame de Ganges saw the chevalier turn pale and\r\ndrop in a sitting position—he had been standing on the foot of the bed.\r\nThe marquise, uneasy, asked what was the matter; but before he could\r\nreply, her attention was called to another quarter. The abbe, as pale\r\nand as disturbed as the chevalier, came back into the room, carrying in\r\nhis hands a glass and a pistol, and double-locked the door behind him.\r\nTerrified at this spectacle, the marquise half raised herself in her\r\nbed, gazing voiceless and wordless. Then the abbe approached her, his\r\nlips trembling; his hair bristling and his eyes blazing, and, presenting\r\nto her the glass and the pistol, \"Madame,\" said he, after a moment of\r\nterrible silence, \"choose, whether poison, fire, or\"—he made a sign to\r\nthe chevalier, who drew his sword—\"or steel.\"\r\n\r\nThe marquise had one moment’s hope: at the motion which she saw the\r\nchevalier make she thought he was coming to her assistance; but being\r\nsoon undeceived, and finding herself between two men, both threatening\r\nher, she slipped from her bed and fell on her knees.\r\n\r\n\"What have I done,\" she cried, \"oh, my God? that you should thus decree\r\nmy death, and after having made yourselves judges should make yourselves\r\nexecutioners? I am guilty of no fault towards you except of having been\r\ntoo faithful in my duty to my husband, who is your brother.\"\r\n\r\nThen seeing that it was vain to continue imploring the abbe, whose looks\r\nand gestures spoke a mind made up, she turned towards the chevalier.\r\n\r\n\"And you too, brother,\" said she, \"oh, God, God! you, too! Oh, have pity\r\non me, in the name of Heaven!\"\r\n\r\nBut he, stamping his foot and pressing the point of his sword to her\r\nbosom, answered—\r\n\r\n\"Enough, madam, enough; take your choice without delay; for if you do\r\nnot take it, we will take it for you.\"\r\n\r\nThe marquise turned once again to the abbe, and her forehead struck the\r\nmuzzle of the pistol. Then she saw that she must die indeed, and\r\nchoosing of the three forms of death that which seemed to her the least\r\nterrible, \"Give me the poison, then,\" said she, \"and may God forgive you\r\nmy death!\"\r\n\r\nWith these words she took the glass, but the thick black liquid of which\r\nit was full aroused such repulsion that she would have attempted a last\r\nappeal; but a horrible imprecation from the abbe and a threatening\r\nmovement from his brother took from her the very last gleam of hope. She\r\nput the glass to her lips, and murmuring once more, \"God! Saviour! have\r\npity on me!\" she swallowed the contents.\r\n\r\nAs she did so a few drops of the liquid fell upon her breast, and\r\ninstantly burned her skin like live coals; indeed, this infernal draught\r\nwas composed of arsenic and sublimate infused in aqua-fortis; then,\r\nthinking that no more would be required of her, she dropped the glass.\r\n\r\nThe marquise was mistaken: the abbe picked it up, and observing that all\r\nthe sediment had remained at the bottom, he gathered together on a\r\nsilver bodkin all that had coagulated on the sides of the glass and all\r\nthat had sunk to the bottom, and presenting this ball, which was about\r\nthe size of a nut, to the marquise, on the end of the bodkin, he said,\r\n\"Come, madame, you must swallow the holy-water sprinkler.\"\r\n\r\nThe marquise opened her lips, with resignation; but instead of doing as\r\nthe abbe commanded, she kept this remainder of the poison in her mouth,\r\nthrew herself on the bed with a scream, and clasping the pillows, in her\r\npain, she put out the poison between the sheets, unperceived by her\r\nassassins; and then turning back to them, folded her hands in entreaty\r\nand said, \"In the name of God, since you have killed my body, at least\r\ndo not destroy my soul, but send me a confessor.\"\r\n\r\nCruel though the abbe and the chevalier were, they were no doubt\r\nbeginning to weary of such a scene; moreover, the mortal deed was\r\naccomplished—after what she had drunk, the marquise could live but a few\r\nminutes; at her petition they went out, locking the door behind them.\r\nBut no sooner did the marquise find herself alone than the possibility\r\nof flight presented itself to her. She ran to the window: this was but\r\ntwenty-two feet above the ground, but the earth below was covered with\r\nstones and rubbish. The marquise, being only in her nightdress, hastened\r\nto slip on a silk petticoat; but at the moment when she finished tying\r\nit round her waist she heard a step approaching her room, and believing\r\nthat her murderers were returning to make an end of her, she flew like a\r\nmadwoman to the window. At the moment of her setting foot on the window\r\nledge, the door opened: the marquise, ceasing to consider anything,\r\nflung herself down, head first.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the new-comer, who was the castle chaplain, had time to\r\nreach out and seize her skirt. The skirt, not strong enough to bear the\r\nweight of the marquise, tore; but its resistance, slight though it was,\r\nsufficed nevertheless to change the direction of her body: the marquise,\r\nwhose head would have been shattered on the stones, fell on her feet\r\ninstead, and beyond their being bruised by the stones, received no\r\ninjury. Half stunned though she was by her fall, the marquise saw\r\nsomething coming after her, and sprang aside. It was an enormous pitcher\r\nof water, beneath which the priest, when he saw her escaping him, had\r\ntried to crush her; but either because he had ill carried out his\r\nattempt or because the marquise had really had time to move away, the\r\nvessel was shattered at her feet without touching her, and the priest,\r\nseeing that he had missed his aim, ran to warn the abbe and the\r\nchevalier that the victim was escaping.\r\n\r\nAs for the marquise, she had hardly touched the ground, when with\r\nadmirable presence of mind she pushed the end of one of her long plaits\r\nso far down her throat as to provoke a fit of vomiting; this was the\r\nmore easily done that she had eaten heartily of the collation, and\r\nhappily the presence of the food had prevented the poison from attacking\r\nthe coats of the stomach so violently as would otherwise have been the\r\ncase. Scarcely had she vomited when a tame boar swallowed what she had\r\nrejected, and falling into a convulsion, died immediately.\r\n\r\nAs we have said, the room looked upon an enclosed courtyard; and the\r\nmarquise at first thought that in leaping from her room into this court\r\nshe had only changed her prison; but soon perceiving a light that\r\nflickered from an upper window of one of the stables, she ran thither,\r\nand found a groom who was just going to bed.\r\n\r\n\"In the name of Heaven, my good man,\" said she to him, \"save me! I am\r\npoisoned! They want to kill me! Do not desert me, I entreat you! Have\r\npity on me, open this stable for me; let me get away! Let me escape!\"\r\n\r\nThe groom did not understand much of what the marquise said to him; but\r\nseeing a woman with disordered hair, half naked, asking help of him, he\r\ntook her by the arm, led her through the stables, opened a door for her,\r\nand the marquise found herself in the street. Two women were passing;\r\nthe groom put her into their hands, without being able to explain to\r\nthem what he did not know himself. As for the marquise, she seemed able\r\nto say nothing beyond these words: \"Save me! I am poisoned! In the name\r\nof Heaven, save me!\"\r\n\r\nAll at once she escaped from their hands and began to run like a mad\r\nwoman; she had seen, twenty steps away, on the threshold of the door by\r\nwhich she had come, her two murderers in pursuit of her.\r\n\r\nThen they rushed after her; she shrieking that she was poisoned, they\r\nshrieking that she was mad; and all this happening amid a crowd which,\r\nnot knowing what part to take, divided and made way for the victim and\r\nthe murderers. Terror gave the marquise superhuman strength: the woman\r\nwho was accustomed to walk in silken shoes upon velvet carpets, ran with\r\nbare and bleeding feet over stocks and stones, vainly asking help, which\r\nnone gave her; for, indeed, seeing her thus, in mad flight, in a\r\nnightdress, with flying hair, her only garment a tattered silk\r\npetticoat, it was difficult not to—think that this woman was, as her\r\nbrothers-in-law said, mad.\r\n\r\nAt last the chevalier came up with her, stopped her, dragged her, in\r\nspite of her screams, into the nearest house, and closed the door behind\r\nthem, while the abbe, standing at the threshold with a pistol in his\r\nhand, threatened to blow out the brains of any person who should\r\napproach.\r\n\r\nThe house into which the chevalier and the marquise had gone belonged to\r\none M. Desprats, who at the moment was from home, and whose wife was\r\nentertaining several of her friends. The marquise and the chevalier,\r\nstill struggling together, entered the room where the company was\r\nassembled: as among the ladies present were several who also visited the\r\nmarquise, they immediately arose, in the greatest amazement, to give her\r\nthe assistance that she implored; but the chevalier hastily pushed them\r\naside, repeating that the marquise was mad. To this reiterated\r\naccusation—to which, indeed, appearances lent only too great a\r\nprobability—the marquise replied by showing her burnt neck and her\r\nblackened lips, and wringing her hands in pain, cried out that she was\r\npoisoned, that she was going to die, and begged urgently for milk, or at\r\nleast for water. Then the wife of a Protestant minister, whose name was\r\nMadame Brunel, slipped into her hand a box of orvietan, some pieces of\r\nwhich she hastened to swallow, while another lady gave her a glass of\r\nwater; but at the instant when she was lifting it to her mouth, the\r\nchevalier broke it between her teeth, and one of the pieces of glass cut\r\nher lips. At this, all the women would have flung themselves upon the\r\nchevalier; but the marquise, fearing that he would only become more\r\nenraged, and hoping to disarm him, asked, on the contrary, that she\r\nmight be left alone with him: all the company, yielding to her desire,\r\npassed into the next room; this was what the chevalier, on his part,\r\ntoo, asked.\r\n\r\nScarcely were they alone, when the marquise, joining her hands, knelt to\r\nhim and said in the gentlest and most appealing voice that it was\r\npossible to use, \"Chevalier, my dear brother, will you not have pity\r\nupon me, who have always had so much affection for you, and who, even\r\nnow, would give my blood for your service? You know that the things I am\r\nsaying are not merely empty words; and yet how is it you are treating\r\nme, though I have not deserved it? And what will everyone say to such\r\ndealings? Ah, brother, what a great unhappiness is mine, to have been so\r\ncruelly treated by you! And yet—yes, brother—if you will deign to have\r\npity on me and to save my life, I swear, by my hope of heaven, to keep\r\nno remembrance of what has happened; and to consider you always as my\r\nprotector and my friend.\"\r\n\r\nAll at once the marquise rose with a great cry and clasped her hand to\r\nher right side. While she was speaking, and before she perceived what he\r\nwas doing, the chevalier had drawn his sword, which was very short, and\r\nusing it as a dagger, had struck her in the breast; this first blow was\r\nfollowed by a second, which came in contact with the shoulder blade, and\r\nso was prevented from going farther. At these two blows the marquise\r\nrushed towards the door, of the room into which the ladies had retired,\r\ncrying, \"Help! He is killing me!\"\r\n\r\nBut during the time that she took to cross the room the chevalier\r\nstabbed her five times in the back with his sword, and would no doubt\r\nhave done more, if at the last blow his sword had not broken; indeed, he\r\nhad struck with such force that the fragment remained embedded in her\r\nshoulder, and the marquise fell forward on the floor, in a pool of her\r\nblood, which was flowing all round her and spreading through the room.\r\n\r\nThe chevalier thought he had killed her, and hearing the women running\r\nto her assistance, he rushed from the room. The abbe was still at the\r\ndoor, pistol in hand; the chevalier took him by the arm to drag him\r\naway, and as the abbe hesitated to follow, he said:—\r\n\r\n\"Let us go, abbe; the business is done.\"\r\n\r\nThe chevalier and the abbe had taken a few steps in the street when a\r\nwindow opened and the women who had found the marquise expiring called\r\nout for help: at these cries the abbe stopped short, and holding back\r\nthe chevalier by the arm, demanded—\r\n\r\n\"What was it you said, chevalier? If they are calling help, is she not\r\ndead, after all?\"\r\n\r\n\"’Ma foi’, go and see for yourself,\" returned the chevalier. \"I have\r\ndone enough for my share; it is your turn now.\"\r\n\r\n\"’Pardieu’, that is quite my opinion,\" cried the abbe; and rushing back\r\nto the house, he flung himself into the room at the moment when the\r\nwomen, lifting the marquise with great difficulty, for she was so weak\r\nthat she could no longer help herself, were attempting to carry her to\r\nbed. The abbe pushed them away, and arriving at the marquise, put his\r\npistol to her heart; but Madame Brunel, the same who had previously\r\ngiven the marquise a box of orvietan, lifted up the barrel with her\r\nhand, so that the shot went off into the air, and the bullet instead of\r\nstriking the marquise lodged in the cornice of the ceiling. The abbe\r\nthen took the pistol by the barrel and gave Madame Brunet so violent a\r\nblow upon the head with the butt that she staggered and almost fell; he\r\nwas about to strike her again, but all the women uniting against him,\r\npushed him, with thousands of maledictions, out of the room, and locked\r\nthe door behind him. The two assassins, taking advantage of the\r\ndarkness, fled from Ganges, and reached Aubenas, which is a full league\r\naway, about ten in the evening.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the women were doing all they could for the marquise. Their\r\nfirst intention, as we have already said, was to put her to bed, but the\r\nbroken sword blade made her unable to lie down, and they tried in vain\r\nto pull it out, so deeply had it entered the bone. Then the marquise\r\nherself showed Madame Brunet what method to take: the operating lady was\r\nto sit on the bed, and while the others helped to hold up the marquise,\r\nwas to seize the blade with both hands, and pressing her—knees against\r\nthe patient’s back, to pull violently and with a great jerk. This plan\r\nat last succeeded, and the marquise was able to get to bed; it was nine\r\nin the evening, and this horrible tragedy had been going on for nearly\r\nthree hours.\r\n\r\nThe magistrates of Ganges, being informed of what had happened, and\r\nbeginning to believe that it was really a case of murder, came in\r\nperson, with a guard, to the marquise. As soon as she saw them come in\r\nshe recovered strength, and raising herself in bed, so great was her\r\nfear, clasped her hands and besought their protection; for she always\r\nexpected to see one or the other of her murderers return. The\r\nmagistrates told her to reassure herself, set armed men to guard all the\r\napproaches to the house, and while physicians and surgeons were,\r\nsummoned in hot haste from Montpellier, they on their part sent word to\r\nthe Baron de Trissan, provost of Languedoc, of the crime that had just\r\nbeen committed, and gave him the names and the description of the\r\nmurderers. That official at once sent people after them, but it was\r\nalready too late: he learned that the abbe and the chevalier had slept\r\nat Aubenas on the night of the murder, that there they had reproached\r\neach other for their unskilfulness, and had come near cutting each\r\nother’s throats, that finally they had departed before daylight, and had\r\ntaken a boat, near Agde, from a beach called the \"Gras de Palaval.\"\r\n\r\nThe Marquis de Ganges was at Avignon, where he was prosecuting a servant\r\nof his who had robbed him of two hundred crowns; when he heard news of\r\nthe event. He turned horribly pale as he listened to the messenger’s\r\nstory, then falling into a violent fury against his brothers, he swore\r\nthat they should have no executioners other than himself. Nevertheless,\r\nthough he was so uneasy about the marquise’s condition, he waited until\r\nthe next day in the afternoon before setting forth, and during the\r\ninterval he saw some of his friends at Avignon without saying anything\r\nto them of the matter. He did not reach Ganges until four days after the\r\nmurder, then he went to the house of M. Desprats and asked to see his\r\nwife, whom some kind priests had already prepared for the meeting; and\r\nthe marquise, as soon as she heard of his arrival, consented to receive\r\nhim. The marquis immediately entered the room, with his eyes full of\r\ntears, tearing his hair, and giving every token of the deepest despair.\r\n\r\nThe marquise received her husband like a forgiving wife and a dying\r\nChristian. She scarcely even uttered some slight reproaches about the\r\nmanner in which he had deserted her; moreover, the marquis having\r\ncomplained to a monk of these reproaches, and the monk having reported\r\nhis complaints to the marquise, she called her husband to her bedside,\r\nat a moment when she was surrounded by people, and made him a public\r\napology, begging him to attribute the words that seemed to have wounded\r\nhim to the effect of her sufferings, and not to any failure in her\r\nregard for him. The marquis, left alone with his wife, tried to take\r\nadvantage of this reconciliation to induce her to annul the declaration\r\nthat she had made before the magistrates of Avignon; for the vice-legate\r\nand his officers, faithful to the promises made to the marquise, had\r\nrefused to register the fresh donation which she had made at Ganges,\r\naccording to the suggestions of the abbe, and which the latter had sent\r\noff, the very moment it was signed, to his brother. But on this point\r\nthe marquise was immovably resolute, declaring that this fortune was\r\nreserved for her children and therefore sacred to her, and that she\r\ncould make no alteration in what had been done at Avignon, since it\r\nrepresented her genuine and final wishes. Notwithstanding this\r\ndeclaration, the marquis did not cease to—remain beside his wife and to\r\nbestow upon her every care possible to a devoted and attentive husband.\r\n\r\nTwo days later than the Marquis de Ganges arrived Madame de Rossan great\r\nwas her amazement, after all the rumours that were already in\r\ncirculation about the marquis, at finding her daughter in the hands of\r\nhim whom she regarded as one of her murderers. But the marquise, far\r\nfrom sharing that opinion, did all she could, not only to make her\r\nmother feel differently, but even to induce her to embrace the marquis\r\nas a son. This blindness on the part of the marquise caused Madame de\r\nRossan so much grief that notwithstanding her profound affection for her\r\ndaughter she would only stay two days, and in spite of the entreaties\r\nthat the dying woman made to her, she returned home, not allowing\r\nanything to stop her. This departure was a great grief to the marquise,\r\nand was the reason why she begged with renewed entreaties to be taken to\r\nMontpellier. The very sight of the place where she had been so cruelly\r\ntortured continually brought before her, not only the remembrance of the\r\nmurder, but the image of the murderers, who in her brief moments of\r\nsleep so haunted her that she sometimes awoke suddenly, uttering shrieks\r\nand calling for help. Unfortunately, the physician considered her too\r\nweak to bear removal, and declared that no change of place could be made\r\nwithout extreme danger.\r\n\r\nThen, when she heard this verdict, which had to be repeated to her, and\r\nwhich her bright and lively complexion and brilliant eyes seemed to\r\ncontradict, the marquise turned all her thoughts towards holy things,\r\nand thought only of dying like a saint after having already suffered\r\nlike a martyr. She consequently asked to receive the last sacrament, and\r\nwhile it was being sent for, she repeated her apologies to her husband\r\nand her forgiveness of his brothers, and this with a gentleness that,\r\njoined to her beauty, made her whole personality appear angelic. When,\r\nhowever, the priest bearing the viaticum entered, this expression\r\nsuddenly changed, and her face presented every token of the greatest\r\nterror. She had just recognised in the priest who was bringing her the\r\nlast consolations of Heaven the infamous Perette, whom she could not but\r\nregard as an accomplice of the abbe and the chevalier, since, after\r\nhaving tried to hold her back, he had attempted to crush her beneath the\r\npitcher of water which he had thrown at her from the window, and since,\r\nwhen he saw her escaping, he had run to warn her assassins and to set\r\nthem on her track. She recovered herself quickly, however, and seeing\r\nthat the priest, without any sign of remorse, was drawing near to her\r\nbedside, she would not cause so great a scandal as would have been\r\ncaused by denouncing him at such a moment. Nevertheless, bending towards\r\nhim, she said, \"Father, I hope that, remembering what has passed, and in\r\norder to dispel fears that—I may justifiably entertain, you will make no\r\ndifficulty of partaking with me of the consecrated wafer; for I have\r\nsometimes heard it said that the body of our Lord Jesus Christ, while\r\nremaining a token of salvation, has been known to be made a principle of\r\ndeath.\"\r\n\r\nThe priest inclined his head as a sign of assent.\r\n\r\nSo the marquise communicated thus, taking a sacrament that she shared\r\nwith one of her murderers, as an evidence that she forgave this one like\r\nthe others and that she prayed God to forgive them as she herself did.\r\n\r\nThe following days passed without any apparent increase in her illness,\r\nthe fever by which she was consumed rather enhancing her beauties, and\r\nimparting to her voice and gestures a vivacity which they had never had\r\nbefore. Thus everybody had begun to recover hope, except herself, who,\r\nfeeling better than anyone else what was her true condition, never for a\r\nmoment allowed herself any illusion, and keeping her son, who was seven\r\nyears old, constantly beside her bed, bade him again and again look well\r\nat her, so that, young as he was, he might remember her all his life and\r\nnever forget her in his prayers. The poor child would burst into tears\r\nand promise not only to remember her but also to avenge her when he was\r\na man. At these words the marquise gently reproved him, telling him that\r\nall vengeance belonged to the king and to God, and that all cares of the\r\nkind must be left to those two great rulers of heaven and of earth.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of June, M. Catalan, a councillor, appointed as a\r\ncommissioner by the Parliament of Toulouse, arrived at Ganges, together\r\nwith all the officials required by his commission; but he could not see\r\nthe marquise that night, for she had dozed for some hours, and this\r\nsleep had left a sort of torpor upon her mind, which might have impaired\r\nthe lucidity of her depositions. The next morning, without asking\r\nanybody’s opinion, M. Catalan repaired to the house of M. Desprats, and\r\nin spite of some slight resistance on the part of those who were in\r\ncharge of her, made his way to the presence of the marquise. The dying\r\nwoman received him with an admirable presence of mind, that made M.\r\nCatalan think there had been an intention the night before to prevent\r\nany meeting between him and the person whom he was sent to interrogate.\r\nAt first the marquise would relate nothing that had passed, saying that\r\nshe could not at the same time accuse and forgive; but M. Catalan\r\nbrought her to see that justice required truth from her before all\r\nthings, since, in default of exact information, the law might go astray,\r\nand strike the innocent instead of the guilty. This last argument\r\ndecided the marquise, and during the hour and a half that he spent alone\r\nwith her she told him all the details of this horrible occurrence. On\r\nthe morrow M. Catalan was to see her again; but on the morrow the\r\nmarquise was, in truth, much worse. He assured himself of this by his\r\nown eyes, and as he knew almost all that he wished to know, did not\r\ninsist further, for fear of fatiguing her.\r\n\r\nIndeed, from that day forward, such atrocious sufferings laid hold upon\r\nthe marquise, that notwithstanding the firmness which she had always\r\nshown, and which she tried to maintain to the end, she could not prevent\r\nherself from uttering screams mingled with prayers. In this manner she\r\nspent the whole day of the 4th and part of the 5th. At last, on that\r\nday, which was a Sunday, towards four o’clock in the afternoon, she\r\nexpired.\r\n\r\nThe body was immediately opened, and the physicians attested that the\r\nmarquise had died solely from the power of the poison, none of the seven\r\nsword cuts which she had received being, mortal. They found the stomach\r\nand bowels burned and the brain blackened. However, in spite of that\r\ninfernal draught, which, says the official report, \"would have killed a\r\nlioness in a few hours,\" the marquise struggled for nineteen days, so\r\nmuch, adds an account from which we have borrowed some of these details,\r\nso much did nature lovingly defend the beautiful body that she had taken\r\nso much trouble to make.\r\n\r\n  M. Catalan, the very moment he was informed of the marquise’s death,\r\n     having with him twelve guards belonging to the governor, ten\r\n     archers, and a poqueton,—despatched them to the marquis’s castle\r\n     with orders to seize his person, that of the priest, and those of\r\n     all the servants except the groom who had assisted the marquise in\r\n     her flight. The officer in command of this little squad found the\r\n     marquis walking up and down, melancholy and greatly disturbed, in\r\n     the large hall of the castle, and when he signified to him the\r\n     order of which he was the bearer, the marquis, without making any\r\n     resistance, and as though prepared for what was happening to him,\r\n     replied that he was ready to obey, and that moreover he had always\r\n     intended to go before the Parliament to accuse the murderers of his\r\n     wife. He was asked for the key of his cabinet, which he gave up,\r\n     and the order was given to conduct him, with the other persons\r\n     accused, to the prisons of Montpellier. As soon as the marquis came\r\n     into that town, the report of his arrival spread with incredible\r\n     rapidity from street to street. Then, as it was dark, lights came\r\n     to all the windows, and people coming out with torches formed a\r\n     torchlight procession, by means of which everybody could see him.\r\n     He, like the priest, was mounted on a sorry hired horse, and\r\n     entirely surrounded by archers, to whom, no doubt, he owed his life\r\n     on this occasion; for the indignation against him was so great that\r\n     everyone was egging on his neighbours to tear him limb from limb,\r\n     which would certainly have come to pass had he not been so\r\n     carefully defended and guarded.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon receiving news of her daughter’s death, Madame de\r\nRossan took possession of all her property, and, making herself a party\r\nto the case, declared that she would never desist from her suit until\r\nher daughter’s death was avenged. M. Catalan began the examination at\r\nonce, and the first interrogation to which he submitted the marquis\r\nlasted eleven hours. Then soon afterwards he and the other persons\r\naccused were conveyed from the prisons of Montpellier to those of\r\nToulouse. A crushing memorial by Madame de Rossan followed them, in\r\nwhich she demonstrated with absolute clearness that the marquis had\r\nparticipated in the crime of his two brothers, if not in act, in\r\nthought, desire, and intention.\r\n\r\nThe marquis’s defence was very simple: it was his misfortune to have had\r\ntwo villains for brothers, who had made attempts first upon the honour\r\nand then upon the life of a wife whom he loved tenderly; they had\r\ndestroyed her by a most atrocious death, and to crown his evil fortune,\r\nhe, the innocent, was accused of having had a hand in that death. And,\r\nindeed, the examinations in the trial did not succeed in bringing any\r\nevidence against the marquis beyond moral presumptions, which, it\r\nappears, were insufficient to induce his judges to award a sentence of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nA verdict was consequently given, upon the 21st of August, 1667, which\r\nsentenced the abbe and the chevalier de Ganges to be broken alive on the\r\nwheel, the Marquis de Ganges to perpetual banishment from the kingdom,\r\nhis property to be confiscated to the king, and himself to lose his\r\nnobility and to become incapable of succeeding to the property of his\r\nchildren. As for the priest Perette, he was sentenced to the galleys for\r\nlife, after having previously been degraded from his clerical orders by\r\nthe ecclesiastical authorities.\r\n\r\nThis sentence made as great a stir as the murder had done, and gave\r\nrise, in that period when \"extenuating circumstances\" had not been\r\ninvented, to long and angry discussions. Indeed, the marquis either was\r\nguilty of complicity or was not: if he was not, the punishment was too\r\ncruel; if he was, the sentence was too light. Such was the opinion of\r\nLouis XIV., who remembered the beauty of the Marquis de Ganges; for,\r\nsome time afterwards, when he was believed to have forgotten this\r\nunhappy affair, and when he was asked to pardon the Marquis de la Douze,\r\nwho was accused of having poisoned his wife, the king answered, \"There\r\nis no need for a pardon, since he belongs to the Parliament of Toulouse,\r\nand the Marquis de Ganges did very well without one.\"\r\n\r\nIt may easily be supposed that this melancholy event did not pass\r\nwithout inciting the wits of the day to write a vast number of verses\r\nand bouts-rimes about the catastrophe by which one of the most beautiful\r\nwomen of the country was carried off. Readers who have a taste for that\r\nsort of literature are referred to the journals and memoirs of the\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nNow, as our readers, if they have taken any interest at all in the\r\nterrible tale just narrated, will certainly ask what became of the\r\nmurderers, we will proceed to follow their course until the moment when\r\nthey disappeared, some into the night of death, some into the darkness\r\nof oblivion.\r\n\r\nThe priest Perette was the first to pay his debt to Heaven: he died at\r\nthe oar on the way from Toulouse to Brest.\r\n\r\nThe chevalier withdrew to Venice, took service in the army of the Most\r\nSerene Republic, then at war with Turkey, and was sent to Candia, which\r\nthe Mussulmans had been besieging for twenty years; he had scarcely\r\narrived there when, as he was walking on the ramparts of the town with\r\ntwo other officers, a shell burst at their feet, and a fragment of it\r\nkilled the chevalier without so much as touching his companions, so that\r\nthe event was regarded as a direct act of Providence.\r\n\r\nAs for the abbe, his story is longer and stranger. He parted from the\r\nchevalier in the neighbourhood of Genoa, and crossing the whole of\r\nPiedmont, part of Switzerland, and a corner of Germany, entered Holland\r\nunder the name of Lamartelliere. After many hesitations as to the place\r\nwhere he would settle, he finally retired to Viane, of which the Count\r\nof Lippe was at that time sovereign; there he made the acquaintance of a\r\ngentleman who presented him to the count as a French religious refugee.\r\n\r\nThe count, even in this first conversation, found that the foreigner who\r\nhad come to seek safety in his dominions possessed not only great\r\nintelligence but a very solid sort of intelligence, and seeing that the\r\nFrenchman was conversant with letters and with learning, proposed that\r\nhe should undertake the education of his son, who at that time was nine\r\nyears old. Such a proposal was a stroke of fortune for the abbe de\r\nGanges, and he did not dream of refusing it.\r\n\r\nThe abbe de Ganges was one of those men who have great mastery over\r\nthemselves: from the moment when he saw that his interest, nay, the very\r\nsafety of his life required it, he concealed with extreme care whatever\r\nbad passions existed within him, and only allowed his good qualities to\r\nappear. He was a tutor who supervised the heart as sharply as the mind,\r\nand succeeded in making of his pupil a prince so accomplished in both\r\nrespects, that the Count of Lippe, making use of such wisdom and such\r\nknowledge, began to consult the tutor upon all matters of State, so that\r\nin course of time the so-called Lamartelliere, without holding any\r\npublic office, had become the soul of the little principality.\r\n\r\nThe countess had a young relation living with her, who though without\r\nfortune was of a great family, and for whom the countess had a deep\r\naffection; it did not escape her notice that her son’s tutor had\r\ninspired this poor young girl with warmer feelings than became her high\r\nstation, and that the false Lamartelliere, emboldened by his own growing\r\ncredit, had done all he could to arouse and keep up these feelings. The\r\ncountess sent for her cousin, and having drawn from her a confession of\r\nher love, said that she herself had indeed a great regard for her son’s\r\ngovernor, whom she and her husband intended to reward with pensions and\r\nwith posts for the services he had rendered to their family and to the\r\nState, but that it was too lofty an ambition for a man whose name was\r\nLamartelliere, and who had no relations nor family that could be owned,\r\nto aspire to the hand of a girl who was related to a royal house; and\r\nthat though she did not require that the man who married her cousin\r\nshould be a Bourbon, a Montmorency, or a Rohan, she did at least desire\r\nthat he should be somebody, though it were but a gentleman of Gascony or\r\nPoitou.\r\n\r\nThe Countess of Lippe’s young kinswoman went and repeated this answer,\r\nword for word, to her lover, expecting him to be overwhelmed by it; but,\r\non the contrary, he replied that if his birth was the only obstacle that\r\nopposed their union, there might be means to remove it. In fact, the\r\nabbe, having spent eight years at the prince’s court, amid the strongest\r\ntestimonies of confidence and esteem, thought himself sure enough of the\r\nprince’s goodwill to venture upon the avowal of his real name.\r\n\r\nHe therefore asked an audience of the countess, who immediately granted\r\nit. Bowing to her respectfully, he said, \"Madame, I had flattered myself\r\nthat your Highness honoured me with your esteem, and yet you now oppose\r\nmy happiness: your Highness’s relative is willing to accept me as a\r\nhusband, and the prince your son authorises my wishes and pardons my\r\nboldness; what have I done to you, madame, that you alone should be\r\nagainst me? and with what can you reproach me during the eight years\r\nthat I have had the honour of serving your Highness?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing to reproach you with, monsieur,\" replied the countess:\r\n\"but I do not wish to incur reproach on my own part by permitting such a\r\nmarriage: I thought you too sensible and reasonable a man to need\r\nreminding that, while you confined yourself to suitable requests and\r\nmoderate ambitions, you had reason to be pleased with our gratitude. Do\r\nyou ask that your salary shall be doubled? The thing is easy. Do you\r\ndesire important posts? They shall be given you; but do not, sir, so far\r\nforget yourself as to aspire to an alliance that you cannot flatter\r\nyourself with a hope of ever attaining.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, madame,\" returned the petitioner, \"who told you that my birth was\r\nso obscure as to debar me from all hope of obtaining your consent?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you yourself, monsieur, I think,\" answered the countess in\r\nastonishment; \"or if you did not say so, your name said so for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if that name is not mine, madame?\" said the abbe, growing bolder;\r\n\"if unfortunate, terrible, fatal circumstances have compelled me to take\r\nthat name in order to hide another that was too unhappily famous, would\r\nyour Highness then be so unjust as not to change your mind?\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur,\" replied the countess, \"you have said too much now not to go\r\non to the end. Who are you? Tell me. And if, as you give me to\r\nunderstand, you are of good birth, I swear to you that want of fortune\r\nshall not stand in the way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas, madame,\" cried the abbe, throwing himself at her feet, \"my name,\r\nI am sure, is but too familiar to your Highness, and I would willingly\r\nat this moment give half my blood that you had never heard it uttered;\r\nbut you have said it, madame, have gone too far to recede. Well, then, I\r\nam that unhappy abbe de Ganges whose crimes are known and of whom I have\r\nmore than once heard you speak.\"\r\n\r\n\"The abbe de Ganges!\" cried the countess in horror,—\"the abbe de Ganges!\r\nYou are that execrable abbe de Ganges whose very name makes one shudder?\r\nAnd to you, to a man thus infamous, we have entrusted the education of\r\nour only son? Oh, I hope, for all our sakes, monsieur, that you are\r\nspeaking falsely; for if you were speaking the truth I think I should\r\nhave you arrested this very instant and taken back to France to undergo\r\nyour punishment. The best thing you can do, if what you have said to me\r\nis true, is instantly to leave not only the castle, but the town and the\r\nprincipality; it will be torment enough for the rest of my life whenever\r\nI think that I have spent seven years under the same roof with you.\"\r\n\r\nThe abbe would have replied; but the countess raised her voice so much,\r\nthat the young prince, who had been won over to his tutor’s interests\r\nand who was listening at his mother’s door, judged that his protege’s\r\nbusiness was taking an unfavourable turn; and went in to try and put\r\nthings right. He found his mother so much alarmed that she drew him to\r\nher by an instinctive movement, as though to put herself under his\r\nprotection, and beg and pray as he might; he could only obtain\r\npermission for his tutor to go away undisturbed to any country of the\r\nworld that he might prefer, but with an express prohibition of ever\r\nagain entering the presence of the Count or the Countess of Lippe.\r\n\r\nThe abbe de Ganges withdrew to Amsterdam, where he became a teacher of\r\nlanguages, and where his lady-love soon after came to him and married\r\nhim: his pupil, whom his parents could not induce, even when they told\r\nhim the real name of the false Lamartelliere, to share their horror of\r\nhim, gave him assistance as long as he needed it; and this state of\r\nthings continued until upon his wife attaining her majority he entered\r\ninto possession of some property that belonged to her. His regular\r\nconduct and his learning, which had been rendered more solid by long and\r\nserious study, caused him to be admitted into the Protestant consistory;\r\nthere, after an exemplary life, he died, and none but God ever knew\r\nwhether it was one of hypocrisy or of penitence.\r\n\r\nAs for the Marquis de Ganges, who had been sentenced, as we have seen,\r\nto banishment and the confiscation of his property, he was conducted to\r\nthe frontier of Savoy and there set at liberty. After having spent two\r\nor three years abroad, so that the terrible catastrophe in which he had\r\nbeen concerned should have time to be hushed up, he came back to France,\r\nand as nobody—Madame de Rossan being now dead—was interested in\r\nprosecuting him, he returned to his castle at Ganges, and remained\r\nthere, pretty well hidden. M. de Baville, indeed, the Lieutenant of\r\nLanguedoc, learned that the marquis had broken from his exile; but he\r\nwas told, at the same time, that the marquis, as a zealous Catholic, was\r\nforcing his vassals to attend mass, whatever their religion might be:\r\nthis was the period in which persons of the Reformed Church were being\r\npersecuted, and the zeal of the marquis appeared to M. de Baville to\r\ncompensate and more than compensate for the peccadillo of which he had\r\nbeen accused; consequently, instead of prosecuting him, he entered into\r\nsecret communication with him, reassuring him about his stay in France,\r\nand urging on his religious zeal; and in this manner twelve years passed\r\nby.\r\n\r\nDuring this time the marquise’s young son, whom we saw at his mother’s\r\ndeathbed, had reached the age of twenty, and being rich in his father’s\r\npossessions—which his uncle had restored to him—and also by his mother’s\r\ninheritance, which he had shared with his sister, had married a girl of\r\ngood family, named Mademoiselle de Moissac, who was both rich and\r\nbeautiful. Being called to serve in the royal army, the count brought\r\nhis young wife to the castle of Ganges, and, having fervently commended\r\nher to his father, left her in his charge.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis de Ganges was forty-two years old, and scarcely seemed\r\nthirty; he was one of the handsomest men living; he fell in love with\r\nhis daughter-in-law and hoped to win her love, and in order to promote\r\nthis design, his first care was to separate from her, under the excuse\r\nof religion, a maid who had been with her from childhood and to whom she\r\nwas greatly attached.\r\n\r\nThis measure, the cause of which the young marquise did not know,\r\ndistressed her extremely. It was much against her will that she had come\r\nto live at all in this old castle of Ganges, which had so recently been\r\nthe scene of the terrible story that we have just told. She inhabited\r\nthe suite of rooms in which the murder had been committed; her\r\nbedchamber was the same which had belonged to the late marquise; her bed\r\nwas the same; the window by which she had fled was before her eyes; and\r\neverything, down to the smallest article of furniture, recalled to her\r\nthe details of that savage tragedy. But even worse was her case when she\r\nfound it no longer possible to doubt her father-in-law’s intentions;\r\nwhen she saw herself beloved by one whose very name had again and again\r\nmade her childhood turn pale with terror, and when she was left alone at\r\nall hours of the day in the sole company of the man whom public rumour\r\nstill pursued as a murderer. Perhaps in any other place the poor lonely\r\ngirl might have found some strength in trusting herself to God; but\r\nthere, where God had suffered one of the fairest and purest creatures\r\nthat ever existed to perish by so cruel a death, she dared not appeal to\r\nHim, for He seemed to have turned away from this family.\r\n\r\nShe waited, therefore, in growing terror; spending her days, as much as\r\nshe could, with the women of rank who lived in the little town of\r\nGanges, and some of whom, eye-witnesses of her mother-in-law’s murder,\r\nincreased her terrors by the accounts which they gave of it, and which\r\nshe, with the despairing obstinacy of fear, asked to hear again and\r\nagain. As to her nights, she spent the greater part of them on her\r\nknees, and fully dressed, trembling at the smallest sound; only\r\nbreathing freely as daylight came back, and then venturing to seek her\r\nbed for a few hours’ rest.\r\n\r\nAt last the marquis’s attempts became so direct and so pressing, that\r\nthe poor young woman resolved to escape at all costs from his hands. Her\r\nfirst idea was to write to her father, explain to him her position and\r\nask help; but her father had not long been a Catholic, and had suffered\r\nmuch on behalf of the Reformed religion, and on these accounts it was\r\nclear that her letter would be opened by the marquis on pretext of\r\nreligion, and thus that step, instead of saving, might destroy her. She\r\nhad thus but one resource: her husband had always been a Catholic; her\r\nhusband was a captain of dragoons, faithful in the service of the king\r\nand faithful in the service of God; there could be no excuse for opening\r\na letter to him; she resolved to address herself to him, explained the\r\nposition in which she found herself, got the address written by another\r\nhand, and sent the letter to Montpellier, where it was posted.\r\n\r\nThe young marquis was at Metz when he received his wife’s missive. At\r\nthat instant all his childish memories awoke; he beheld himself at his\r\ndying mother’s bedside, vowing never to forget her and to pray daily for\r\nher. The image presented itself of this wife whom he adored, in the same\r\nroom, exposed to the same violence, destined perhaps to the same fate;\r\nall this was enough to lead him to take positive action: he flung\r\nhimself into a post-chaise, reached Versailles, begged an audience of\r\nthe king, cast himself, with his wife’s letter in his hand, at the feet\r\nof Louis XIV, and besought him to compel his father to return into\r\nexile, where he swore upon his honour that he would send him everything\r\nhe could need in order to live properly.\r\n\r\nThe king was not aware that the Marquis de Ganges had disobeyed the\r\nsentence of banishment, and the manner in which he learned it was not\r\nsuch as to make him pardon the contradiction of his laws. In consequence\r\nhe immediately ordered that if the Marquis de Ganges were found in\r\nFrance he should be proceeded against with the utmost rigour.\r\n\r\nHappily for the marquis, the Comte de Ganges, the only one of his\r\nbrothers who had remained in France, and indeed in favour, learned the\r\nking’s decision in time. He took post from Versailles, and making the\r\ngreatest haste, went to warn him of the danger that was threatening;\r\nboth together immediately left Ganges, and withdrew to Avignon. The\r\ndistrict of Venaissin, still belonging at that time to the pope and\r\nbeing governed by a vice-legate, was considered as foreign territory.\r\nThere he found his daughter, Madame d’Urban, who did all she could to\r\ninduce him to stay with her; but to do so would have been to flout Louis\r\nXIV’s orders too publicly, and the marquis was afraid to remain so much\r\nin evidence lest evil should befall him; he accordingly retired to the\r\nlittle village of l’Isle, built in a charming spot near the fountain of\r\nVaucluse; there he was lost sight of; none ever heard him spoken of\r\nagain, and when I myself travelled in the south of France in 1835, I\r\nsought in vain any trace of the obscure and forgotten death which closed\r\nso turbulent and stormy an existence.\r\n\r\nAs, in speaking of the last adventures of the Marquis de Ganges, we have\r\nmentioned the name of Madame d’Urban, his daughter, we cannot exempt\r\nourselves from following her amid the strange events of her life,\r\nscandalous though they may be; such, indeed, was the fate of this\r\nfamily, that it was to occupy the attention of France through well-nigh\r\na century, either by its crimes or by its freaks.\r\n\r\nOn the death of the marquise, her daughter, who was barely six years\r\nold, had remained in the charge of the dowager Marquise de Ganges, who,\r\nwhen she had attained her twelfth year, presented to her as her husband\r\nthe Marquis de Perrant, formerly a lover of the grandmother herself. The\r\nmarquis was seventy years of age, having been born in the reign of Henry\r\nIV; he had seen the court of Louis XIII and that of Louis XIV’s youth,\r\nand he had remained one of its most elegant and favoured nobles; he had\r\nthe manners of those two periods, the politest that the world has known,\r\nso that the young girl, not knowing as yet the meaning of marriage and\r\nhaving seen no other man, yielded without repugnance, and thought\r\nherself happy in becoming the Marquise de Perrant.\r\n\r\nThe marquis, who was very rich, had quarrelled With his younger brother,\r\nand regarded him with such hatred that he was marrying only to deprive\r\nhis brother of the inheritance that would rightfully accrue to him,\r\nshould the elder die childless. Unfortunately, the marquis soon\r\nperceived that the step which he had taken, however efficacious in the\r\ncase of another man, was likely to be fruitless in his own. He did not,\r\nhowever, despair, and waited two or three years, hoping every day that\r\nHeaven would work a miracle in his favour; but as every day diminished\r\nthe chances of this miracle, and his hatred for his brother grew with\r\nthe impossibility of taking revenge upon him, he adopted a strange and\r\naltogether antique scheme, and determined, like the ancient Spartans, to\r\nobtain by the help of another what Heaven refused to himself.\r\n\r\nThe marquis did not need to seek long for the man who should give him\r\nhis revenge: he had in his house a young page, some seventeen or\r\neighteen years old, the son of a friend of his, who, dying without\r\nfortune, had on his deathbed particularly commended the lad to the\r\nmarquis. This young man, a year older than his mistress, could not be\r\ncontinually about her without falling passionately in love with her; and\r\nhowever much he might endeavour to hide his love, the poor youth was as\r\nyet too little practised in dissimulation to succeed in concealing it\r\nfrom the eyes of the marquis, who, after having at first observed its\r\ngrowth with uneasiness, began on the contrary to rejoice in it, from the\r\nmoment when he had decided upon the scheme that we have just mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe marquis was slow to decide but prompt to execute. Having taken his\r\nresolution, he summoned his page, and, after having made him promise\r\ninviolable secrecy, and having undertaken, on that condition, to prove\r\nhis gratitude by buying him a regiment, explained what was expected of\r\nhim. The poor youth, to whom nothing could have been more unexpected\r\nthan such a communication, took it at first for a trick by which the\r\nmarquis meant to make him own his love, and was ready to throw himself\r\nat his feet and declare everything; but the marquis seeing his\r\nconfusion, and easily guessing its cause, reassured him completely by\r\nswearing that he authorised him to take any steps in order to attain the\r\nend that the marquis had in view. As in his inmost heart the aim of the\r\nyoung man was the same, the bargain was soon struck: the page bound\r\nhimself by the most terrible oaths to keep the secret; and the marquis,\r\nin order to supply whatever assistance was in his power, gave him money\r\nto spend, believing that there was no woman, however virtuous, who could\r\nresist the combination of youth, beauty, and fortune: unhappily for the\r\nmarquis, such a woman, whom he thought impossible, did exist, and was\r\nhis wife.\r\n\r\nThe page was so anxious to obey his master, that from that very day his\r\nmistress remarked the alteration that arose from the permission given\r\nhim—his prompt obedience to her orders and his speed in executing them,\r\nin order to return a few moments the sooner to her presence. She was\r\ngrateful to him, and in the simplicity of her heart she thanked him. Two\r\ndays later the page appeared before her splendidly dressed; she observed\r\nand remarked upon his improved appearance, and amused herself in conning\r\nover all the parts of his dress, as she might have done with a new doll.\r\nAll this familiarity doubled the poor young man’s passion, but he stood\r\nbefore his mistress, nevertheless, abashed and trembling, like Cherubino\r\nbefore his fair godmother. Every evening the marquis inquired into his\r\nprogress, and every evening the page confessed that he was no farther\r\nadvanced than the day before; then the marquis scolded, threatened to\r\ntake away his fine clothes, to withdraw his own promises, and finally to\r\naddress himself to some other person. At this last threat the youth\r\nwould again call up his courage, and promise to be bolder to-morrow; and\r\non the morrow would spend the day in making a thousand compliments to\r\nhis mistress’s eyes, which she, in her innocence, did not understand. At\r\nlast, one day, Madame de Perrant asked him what made him look at her\r\nthus, and he ventured to confess his love; but then Madame de Perrant,\r\nchanging her whole demeanour, assumed a face of sternness and bade him\r\ngo out of her room.\r\n\r\nThe poor lover obeyed, and ran, in despair, to confide his grief to the\r\nhusband, who appeared sincerely to share it, but consoled him by saying\r\nthat he had no doubt chosen his moment badly; that all women, even the\r\nleast severe, had inauspicious hours in which they would not yield to\r\nattack, and that he must let a few days pass, which he must employ in\r\nmaking his peace, and then must take advantage of a better opportunity,\r\nand not allow himself to be rebuffed by a few refusals; and to these\r\nwords the marquis added a purse of gold, in order that the page might,\r\nif necessary, win over the marquise’s waiting-woman.\r\n\r\nGuided thus by the older experience of the husband, the page began to\r\nappear very much ashamed and very penitent; but for a day or two the\r\nmarquise, in spite of his apparent humility, kept him at a distance: at\r\nlast, reflecting no doubt, with the assistance of her mirror and of her\r\nmaid, that the crime was not absolutely unpardonable, and after having\r\nreprimanded the culprit at some length, while he stood listening with\r\neyes cast down, she gave a him her hand, forgave him, and admitted him\r\nto her companionship as before.\r\n\r\nThings went on in this way for a week. The page no longer raised his\r\neyes and did not venture to open his mouth, and the marquise was\r\nbeginning to regret the time in which he used to look and to speak,\r\nwhen, one fine day while she was at her toilet, at which she had allowed\r\nhim to be present, he seized a moment when the maid had left her alone,\r\nto cast himself at her feet and tell her that he had vainly tried to\r\nstifle his love, and that, even although he were to die under the weight\r\nof her anger, he must tell her that this love was immense, eternal,\r\nstronger than his life. The marquise upon this wished to send him away,\r\nas on the former occasion, but instead of obeying her, the page, better\r\ninstructed, took her in his arms. The marquise called, screamed, broke\r\nher bell-rope; the waiting-maid, who had been bought over, according to\r\nthe marquis’s advice, had kept the other women out of the way, and was\r\ncareful not to come herself. Then the marquise, resisting force by\r\nforce, freed herself from the page’s arms, rushed to her husband’s room,\r\nand there, bare-necked, with floating hair, and looking lovelier than\r\never, flung herself into his arms and begged his protection against the\r\ninsolent fellow who had just insulted her. But what was the amazement of\r\nthe marquise, when, instead of the anger which she expected to see break\r\nforth, the marquis answered coldly that what she was saying was\r\nincredible, that he had always found the young man very well behaved,\r\nand that, no doubt, having taken up some frivolous ground of resentment\r\nagainst him, she was employing this means to get rid of him; but, he\r\nadded, whatever might be his love for her, and his desire to do\r\neverything that was agreeable to her, he begged her not to require this\r\nof him, the young man being his friend’s son, and consequently his own\r\nadopted child. It was now the marquise who, in her turn, retired\r\nabashed, not knowing what to make of such a reply, and fully resolving,\r\nsince her husband’s protection failed her, to keep herself well guarded\r\nby her own severity.\r\n\r\nIndeed, from that moment the marquise behaved to the poor youth with so\r\nmuch prudery, that, loving her as he did, sincerely, he would have died\r\nof grief, if he had not had the marquis at hand to encourage and\r\nstrengthen him. Nevertheless, the latter himself began to despair, and\r\nto be more troubled by the virtue of his wife than another man might\r\nhave been by the levity of his. Finally, he resolved, seeing that\r\nmatters remained at the same point and that the marquise did not relax\r\nin the smallest degree, to take extreme measures. He hid his page in a\r\ncloset of his wife’s bedchamber, and, rising during her first sleep,\r\nleft empty his own place beside her, went out softly, double-locked the\r\ndoor, and listened attentively to hear what would happen.\r\n\r\nHe had not been listening thus for ten minutes when he heard a great\r\nnoise in the room, and the page trying in vain to appease it. The\r\nmarquis hoped that he might succeed, but the noise increasing, showed\r\nhim that he was again to be disappointed; soon came cries for help, for\r\nthe marquise could not ring, the bell-ropes having been lifted out of\r\nher reach, and no one answering her cries, he heard her spring from her\r\nhigh bed, run to the door, and finding it locked rush to the window,\r\nwhich she tried to open: the scene had come to its climax.\r\n\r\nThe marquis decided to go in, lest some tragedy should happen, or lest\r\nhis wife’s screams should reach some belated passer-by, who next day\r\nwould make him the talk of the town. Scarcely did the marquise behold\r\nhim when she threw herself into his arms, and pointing to the page,\r\nsaid:—\r\n\r\n\"Well, monsieur, will you still hesitate to free me from this insolent\r\nwretch?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madame,\" replied the marquis; \"for this insolent wretch has been\r\nacting for the last three months not only with my sanction but even by\r\nmy orders.\"\r\n\r\nThe marquise remained stupefied. Then the marquis, without sending away\r\nthe page, gave his wife an explanation of all that had passed, and\r\nbesought her to yield to his desire of obtaining a successor, whom he\r\nwould regard as his own child, so long as it was hers; but young though\r\nshe was, the marquise answered with a dignity unusual at her age, that\r\nhis power over her had the limits that were set to it by law, and not\r\nthose that it might please him to set in their place, and that however\r\nmuch she might wish to do what might be his pleasure, she would yet\r\nnever obey him at the expense of her soul and her honour.\r\n\r\nSo positive an answer, while it filled her husband with despair, proved\r\nto him that he must renounce the hope of obtaining an heir; but since\r\nthe page was not to blame for this, he fulfilled the promise that he had\r\nmade, bought him a regiment, and resigned himself to having the most\r\nvirtuous wife in France. His repentance was not, however, of long\r\nduration; he died at the end of three months, after having confided to\r\nhis friend, the Marquis d’Urban, the cause of his sorrows.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis d’Urban had a son of marriageable age; he thought that he\r\ncould find nothing more suitable for him than a wife whose virtue had\r\ncome triumphantly through such a trial: he let her time of mourning\r\npass, and then presented the young Marquis d’Urban, who succeeded in\r\nmaking his attentions acceptable to the beautiful widow, and soon became\r\nher husband. More fortunate than his predecessor, the Marquis d’Urban\r\nhad three heirs to oppose to his collaterals, when, some two years and a\r\nhalf later, the Chevalier de Bouillon arrived at the capital of the\r\ncounty of Venaissin.\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier de Bouillon was a typical rake of the period, handsome,\r\nyoung, and well-grown; the nephew of a cardinal who was influential at\r\nRome, and proud of belonging to a house which had privileges of\r\nsuzerainty. The chevalier, in his indiscreet fatuity, spared no woman;\r\nand his conduct had given some scandal in the circle of Madame de\r\nMaintenon, who was rising into power. One of his friends, having\r\nwitnessed the displeasure exhibited towards him by Louis XIV, who was\r\nbeginning to become devout, thought to do him a service by warning him\r\nthat the king \"gardait une dent\" against him. [ Translator’s\r\nnote.—\"Garder une dent,\" that is, to keep up a grudge, means literally\r\n\"to keep a tooth\" against him.]\r\n\r\n\"Pardieu!\" replied the chevalier, \"I am indeed unlucky when the only\r\ntooth left to him remains to bite me.\"\r\n\r\nThis pun had been repeated, and had reached Louis XIV, so that the\r\nchevalier presently heard, directly enough this time, that the king\r\ndesired him to travel for some years. He knew the danger of\r\nneglecting—such intimations, and since he thought the country after all\r\npreferable to the Bastille, he left Paris, and arrived at Avignon,\r\nsurrounded by the halo of interest that naturally attends a handsome\r\nyoung persecuted nobleman.\r\n\r\nThe virtue of Madame d’Urban was as much cried up at Avignon as the\r\nill-behaviour of the chevalier had been reprobated in Paris. A\r\nreputation equal to his own, but so opposite in kind, could not fail to\r\nbe very offensive to him, therefore he determined immediately upon\r\narriving to play one against the other.\r\n\r\nNothing was easier than the attempt. M. d’Urban, sure of his wife’s\r\nvirtue, allowed her entire liberty; the chevalier saw her wherever he\r\nchose to see her, and every time he saw her found means to express a\r\ngrowing passion. Whether because the hour had come for Madame d’Urban,\r\nor whether because she was dazzled by the splendour of the chevalier’s\r\nbelonging to a princely house, her virtue, hitherto so fierce, melted\r\nlike snow in the May sunshine; and the chevalier, luckier than the poor\r\npage, took the husband’s place without any attempt on Madame d’Urban’s\r\npart to cry for help.\r\n\r\nAs all the chevalier desired was public triumph, he took care to make\r\nthe whole town acquainted at once with his success; then, as some\r\ninfidels of the neighbourhood still doubted, the chevalier ordered one\r\nof his servants to wait for him at the marquise’s door with a lantern\r\nand a bell. At one in the morning, the chevalier came out, and the\r\nservant walked before him, ringing the bell. At this unaccustomed sound,\r\na great number of townspeople, who had been quietly asleep, awoke, and,\r\ncurious to see what was happening, opened their windows. They beheld the\r\nchevalier, walking gravely behind his servant, who continued to light\r\nhis master’s way and to ring along the course of the street that lay\r\nbetween Madame d’Urban’s house and his own. As he had made no mystery to\r\nanyone of his love affair, nobody took the trouble even to ask him\r\nwhence he came. However, as there might possibly be persons still\r\nunconvinced, he repeated this same jest, for his own satisfaction, three\r\nnights running; so that by the morning of the fourth day nobody had any\r\ndoubts left.\r\n\r\nAs generally happens in such cases, M. d’Urban did not know a word of\r\nwhat was going on until the moment when his friends warned him that he\r\nwas the talk of the town. Then he forbade his wife to see her lover\r\nagain. The prohibition produced the usual results: on the morrow, as,\r\nsoon as M. d’Urban had gone out, the marquise sent for the chevalier to\r\ninform him of the catastrophe in which they were both involved; but she\r\nfound him far better prepared than herself for such blows, and he tried\r\nto prove to her, by reproaches for her imprudent conduct, that all this\r\nwas her fault; so that at last the poor woman, convinced that it was she\r\nwho had brought these woes upon them, burst into tears. Meanwhile, M.\r\nd’Urban, who, being jealous for the first time, was the more seriously\r\nso, having learned that the chevalier was with his wife, shut the doors,\r\nand posted himself in the ante-chamber with his servants, in order to\r\nseize him as he came out. But the chevalier, who had ceased to trouble\r\nhimself about Madame d’Urban’s tears, heard all the preparations, and,\r\nsuspecting some ambush, opened the window, and, although it was one\r\no’clock in the afternoon and the place was full of people, jumped out of\r\nthe window into the street, and did not hurt himself at all, though the\r\nheight was twenty feet, but walked quietly home at a moderate pace.\r\n\r\nThe same evening, the chevalier, intending to relate his new adventure\r\nin all its details, invited some of his friends to sup with him at the\r\npastrycook Lecoq’s. This man, who was a brother of the famous Lecoq of\r\nthe rue Montorgueil, was the cleverest eating-house-keeper in Avignon;\r\nhis own unusual corpulence commended his cookery, and, when he stood at\r\nthe door, constituted an advertisement for his restaurant. The good man,\r\nknowing with what delicate appetites he had to deal, did his very best\r\nthat evening, and that nothing might be wanting, waited upon his guests\r\nhimself. They spent the night drinking, and towards morning the\r\nchevalier and his companions, being then drunk, espied their host\r\nstanding respectfully at the door, his face wreathed in smiles. The\r\nchevalier called him nearer, poured him out a glass of wine and made him\r\ndrink with them; then, as the poor wretch, confused at such an honour,\r\nwas thanking him with many bows, he said:—\r\n\r\n\"Pardieu, you are too fat for Lecoq, and I must make you a capon.\"\r\n\r\nThis strange proposition was received as men would receive it who were\r\ndrunk and accustomed by their position to impunity. The unfortunate\r\npastry-cook was seized, bound down upon the table, and died under their\r\ntreatment. The vice-legate being informed of the murder by one of the\r\nwaiters, who had run in on hearing his master’s shrieks, and had found\r\nhim, covered with blood, in the hands of his butchers, was at first\r\ninclined to arrest the chevalier and bring him conspicuously to\r\npunishment. But he was restrained by his regard for the Cardinal de\r\nBouillon, the chevalier’s uncle, and contented himself with warning the\r\nculprit that unless he left the town instantly he would be put into the\r\nhands of the authorities. The chevalier, who was beginning to have had\r\nenough of Avignon, did not wait to be told twice, ordered the wheels of\r\nhis chaise to be greased and horses to be brought. In the interval\r\nbefore they were ready the fancy took him to go and see Madame d’Urban\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAs the house of the marquise was the very last at which, after the\r\nmanner of his leaving it the day before, the chevalier was expected at\r\nsuch an hour, he got in with the greatest ease, and, meeting a\r\nlady’s-maid, who was in his interests, was taken to the room where the\r\nmarquise was. She, who had not reckoned upon seeing the chevalier again,\r\nreceived him with all the raptures of which a woman in love is capable,\r\nespecially when her love is a forbidden one. But the chevalier soon put\r\nan end to them by announcing that his visit was a visit of farewell, and\r\nby telling her the reason that obliged him to leave her. The marquise\r\nwas like the woman who pitied the fatigue of the poor horses that tore\r\nDamien limb from limb; all her commiseration was for the chevalier, who\r\non account of such a trifle was being forced to leave Avignon. At last\r\nthe farewell had to be uttered, and as the chevalier, not knowing what\r\nto say at the fatal moment, complained that he had no memento of her,\r\nthe marquise took down the frame that contained a portrait of herself\r\ncorresponding with one of her husband, and tearing out the canvas,\r\nrolled, it up and gave it to the chevalier. The latter, so far from\r\nbeing touched by this token of love, laid it down, as he went away, upon\r\na piece of furniture, where the marquise found it half an hour later.\r\nShe imagined that his mind being so full of the original, he had\r\nforgotten the copy, and representing to herself the sorrow which the\r\ndiscovery of this forgetfulness would cause him, she sent for a servant,\r\ngave him the picture, and ordered him to take horse and ride after the\r\nchevalier’s chaise. The man took a post-horse, and, making great speed,\r\nperceived the fugitive in the distance just as the latter had finished\r\nchanging horses. He made violent signs and shouted loudly, in order to\r\nstop the postillion. But the postillion having told his fare that he saw\r\na man coming on at full speed, the chevalier supposed himself to be\r\npursued, and bade him go on as fast as possible. This order was so well\r\nobeyed that the unfortunate servant only came up with the chaise a\r\nleague and a half farther on; having stopped the postillion, he got off\r\nhis horse, and very respectfully presented to the chevalier the picture\r\nwhich he had been bidden to bring him. But the chevalier, having\r\nrecovered from his first alarm, bade him go about his business, and take\r\nback the portrait—which was of no use to him—to the sender. The servant,\r\nhowever, like a faithful messenger, declared that his orders were\r\npositive, and that he should not dare go back to Madame d’Urban without\r\nfulfilling them. The chevalier, seeing that he could not conquer the\r\nman’s determination, sent his postillion to a farrier, whose house lay\r\non the road, for a hammer and four nails, and with his own hands nailed\r\nthe portrait to the back of his chaise; then he stepped in again, bade\r\nthe postillion whip up his horses, and drove away, leaving Madame\r\nd’Urban’s messenger greatly astonished at the manner in which the\r\nchevalier had used his mistress’s portrait.\r\n\r\nAt the next stage, the postillion, who was going back, asked for his\r\nmoney, and the chevalier answered that he had none. The postillion\r\npersisted; then the chevalier got out of his chaise, unfastened Madame\r\nd’Urban’s portrait, and told him that he need only put it up for sale in\r\nAvignon and declare how it had come into his possession, in order to\r\nreceive twenty times the price of his stage; the postillion, seeing that\r\nnothing else was to be got out of the chevalier, accepted the pledge,\r\nand, following his instructions precisely, exhibited it next morning at\r\nthe door of a dealer in the town, together with an exact statement of\r\nthe story. The picture was bought back the same day for twenty-five\r\nLouis.\r\n\r\nAs may be supposed, the adventure was much talked of throughout the\r\ntown. Next day, Madame d’Urban disappeared, no one knew whither, at the\r\nvery time when the relatives of the marquis were met together and had\r\ndecided to ask the king for a ’lettre-de-cachet’. One of the gentlemen\r\npresent was entrusted with the duty of taking the necessary steps; but\r\nwhether because he was not active enough, or whether because he was in\r\nMadame d’Urban’s interests, nothing further was heard in Avignon of any\r\nconsequences ensuing from such steps. In the meantime, Madame d’Urban,\r\nwho had gone to the house of an aunt, opened negotiations with her\r\nhusband that were entirely successful, and a month after this adventure\r\nshe returned triumphantly to the conjugal roof.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred pistoles, given by the Cardinal de Bouillon, pacified the\r\nfamily of the unfortunate pastry-cook, who at first had given notice of\r\nthe affair to the police, but who soon afterwards withdrew their\r\ncomplaint, and gave out that they had taken action too hastily on the\r\nstrength of a story told in joke, and that further inquiries showed\r\ntheir relative to have died of an apoplectic stroke.\r\n\r\nThanks—to this declaration, which exculpated the Chevalier de Bouillon\r\nin the eyes of the king, he was allowed, after travelling for two years\r\nin Italy and in Germany, to return undisturbed to France.\r\n\r\nThus ends, not the family of Ganges, but the commotion which the family\r\nmade in the world. From time to time, indeed, the playwright or the\r\nnovelist calls up the pale and bloodstained figure of the marquise to\r\nappear either on the stage or in a book; but the evocation almost always\r\nceases at her, and many persons who have written about the mother do not\r\neven know what became of the children. Our intention has been to fill\r\nthis gap; that is why we have tried to tell what our predecessors left\r\nout, and try offer to our readers what the stage—and often the actual\r\nworld—offers; comedy after melodrama.",
