CROWELL COMPANY\r\n\r\n                           _Third Printing_\r\n\r\n\r\n               _Printed in the United States of America_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be of use to explain briefly the principles underlying the\r\nconstruction of this book.\r\n\r\nIn the first place the aim has been to make the book comprehensive.\r\nAll first-class and nearly all second-class authors (so far as\r\nsuch classification is generally accepted) have been included. Due\r\nproportion between the two groups has been attempted by giving the more\r\nimportant authors greater space. The complete index should assist in\r\nmaking the book a handy volume of reference as well as a historical\r\nsketch.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the plan of making the volume as comprehensive as\r\npossible, a chapter has been added dealing with modern writers. An\r\nattempt of this kind has certain obvious drawbacks; but it has at\r\nleast the double advantage of demonstrating the living nature of our\r\nliterature, and of setting modern authors to scale against the larger\r\nhistorical background.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the endeavor has been to make the book practical. Discussion\r\nhas been avoided; facts, so far as they are known and verifiable, are\r\nsimply stated; dates are quoted whenever it is possible to do so, and\r\nwhere any doubt exists as to these the general opinion of the best\r\nauthorities has been taken; there are frequent tabulated summaries to\r\nassist the mind and eye; and, lastly, there are the exercises.\r\n\r\nIt would be as easy to overpraise as it is to underestimate the value\r\nof the exercises. But in their favor one can at least point out that\r\nthey enable the student to work out for himself some simple literary\r\nand historical problems; that they supply a collection of _obiter\r\ndicta_ by famous critics; and that they are a storehouse of many\r\nadditional extracts. The index to all the extracts in the book should\r\nassist the student in locating every quotation from any writer he may\r\nhave in view.\r\n\r\nWhile he has never neglected the practical aspect of his task, the\r\nwriter of the present work has never been content with a bleak summary\r\nof our literary history. It has been his ambition to set out the facts\r\nwith clearness, vivacity, and some kind of literary elegance. How far\r\nhe has succeeded the reader must judge.\r\n\r\nThe use of the Bibliography (Appendix II) is strongly urged upon all\r\nreaders. Such a book as the present cannot avoid being fragmentary and\r\nincomplete. The student should therefore pursue his inquiries into the\r\nvolumes mentioned in the Appendix. Owing to the restrictions of space,\r\nthe Bibliography is small. But all the books given are of moderate\r\nprice or easily accessible. Moreover, they have been tested by repeated\r\npersonal use, and can be recommended with some confidence.\r\n\r\nThere remains to set on record the author’s gratitude to his colleagues\r\nand good friends, for their skill and good-nature in revising the\r\nmanuscript and in making many excellent suggestions.\r\n                                                                 E.

Nearly all the literary history of the period,\r\nas far as it concerns the lives of actual writers, is a series of\r\nskillful reconstructions based on the texts, fortified by some scanty\r\ncontemporary references (such as those of Bede), and topped with a mass\r\nof conjecture. The results, however, are astonishing and fruitful, as\r\nwill be seen even in the meager summary that appears in the following\r\npages.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nThe period is a long one, for it starts with the fifth century and\r\nconcludes with the Norman Conquest of 1066. The events, however, must\r\nbe dismissed very quickly. We may begin in 410 with the departure of\r\nthe Romans, who left behind them a race of semi-civilized Celts. The\r\nlatter, harassed by the inroads of the savage Caledonians, appealed\r\nfor help to the adventurous English. The English, coming at first as\r\nsaviors, remained as conquerors (450–600). In the course of time they\r\ngained possession of nearly all the land from the English Channel to\r\nthe Firth of Forth. Then followed the Christianizing of the pagan\r\nEnglish, beginning in Kent (597), a movement that affected very deeply\r\nall phases of English life. In succession followed the inroads of the\r\nDanes in the ninth century; the rise of Wessex among the early English\r\nkingdoms, due in great measure to the personality of King Alfred, who\r\ncompromised with the Danes by sharing England with them (878); the\r\naccession of a Danish dynasty in England (1017); and the Gallicizing\r\nof the English Court, a process that was begun before the Conquest of\r\n1066. All these events had their effect on the literature of the period.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY FEATURES OF THE PERIOD\r\n\r\n=1. Pagan Origins.= The earliest poems, such as _Widsith_\r\nand _Beowulf_, present few Christian features, and those that\r\ndo appear are clearly clumsy additions by later hands. It is fairly\r\ncertain, therefore, that the earliest poems came over with the pagan\r\nconquerors. They were probably the common property of the bards or\r\ngleemen, who sang them at the feasts of the warriors. As time went on\r\nChristian ideas were imposed upon the heathen poetry, which retained\r\nmuch of its primitive phraseology.\r\n\r\n=2. Anonymous Origins.= Of all the Old English poets, we have\r\ndirect mention of only one, Cædmon. The name of another poet, Cynewulf,\r\nobscurely hinted at in three separate runic or riddling verses. Of the\r\nother Old English poets we do not know even the names. Prose came much\r\nlater, and, as it was used for practical purposes, its authorship is in\r\neach case established.\r\n\r\n=3. The Imitative Quality.= Nearly all the prose, and the larger\r\npart of the poetry, consists of translations and adaptations from the\r\nLatin. The favorite works for translation were the lives of saints,\r\nthe books of the Bible, and various works of a practical nature. The\r\nclergy, who were almost the sole authors, had such text-books at hand,\r\nand were rarely capable of reaching beyond them. This secondhand nature\r\nof Old English is certainly its most disappointing feature. In most\r\ncases the translations are feebly imitative; in a few cases the poets\r\n(such as Cynewulf) or the prose-writers (such as Alfred) alter, expand,\r\nor comment upon their Latin originals, and then the material is of\r\nmuch greater literary importance.\r\n\r\n=4. The Manuscripts.= It is very likely that only a portion of\r\nOld English poetry has survived, though the surviving material is\r\nquite representative. The manuscripts that preserve the poetical texts\r\nare comparatively late in their discovery, are unique of their kind,\r\nand are only four in number. They are (_a_) the _Beowulf_\r\nmanuscript (containing also a portion of a poem _Judith_),\r\ndiscovered in 1705, and said to have been written about the year 1000;\r\n(_b_) the Junian manuscript, discovered in 1681 by the famous\r\nscholar Junius, and now in the Bodleian Library, containing the Cædmon\r\npoems; (_c_) the Exeter Book, in the Exeter Cathedral library (to\r\nwhich it was given by Leofric about 1050, being brought to light again\r\nin 1705), which preserves most of the Cynewulf poems; and (_d_)\r\nthe Vercelli Book, discovered at Vercelli, near Milan, in 1832, which\r\ncontains, along with some prose homilies, six Old English poems,\r\nincluding _Andreas_ and _Elene_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LANGUAGE\r\n\r\nThe Old English language was that of a simple and semi-barbarous\r\npeople: limited in vocabulary, concrete in ideas, and rude and forcible\r\nin expression. In the later stages of their literature we see the\r\ncrudeness being softened into something more cultured. In grammar the\r\nlanguage was fairly complicated, possessing declinable nouns, pronouns,\r\nand adjectives, and a rather elaborate verb-system. There were three\r\nchief dialects: the Northern or Northumbrian, which was the first to\r\nproduce a literature, and which was overwhelmed by the Danes; the West\r\nSaxon, a form of the Mercian or Midland, which grew to be the standard,\r\nas nearly all the texts are preserved in it; and the Kentish or Jutish,\r\nwhich is of little literary importance.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEOWULF\r\n\r\n=1. Origin of the Poem.= It is almost certain that the poem\r\noriginated before the English invasions. There is no mention of\r\nEngland; Beowulf himself is the king of the “Geatas.” The poem,\r\nmoreover, is pagan in conception, and so antedates the Christian\r\nconversion. With regard to the actual authorship of the work there is\r\nno evidence. It is very likely that it is a collection of the tales\r\nsung by the bards, strung together by one hand, and written in the West\r\nSaxon dialect.\r\n\r\n=2. The Story.= There are so many episodes, digressions, and\r\nreversions in the story of _Beowulf_ that it is almost impossible\r\nto set it down as a detailed consecutive narrative. Putting it in its\r\nvery briefest form, we may say that Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow, and\r\nking of the Geatas, sails to Denmark with a band of heroes, and rids\r\nthe Danish King Hrothgar of a horrible mere-monster called Grendel.\r\nThe mother of Grendel meets with the same fate, and Beowulf, having\r\nbeen duly feasted and rewarded, returns to his native land. After a\r\nprosperous reign of forty years Beowulf slays the dragon that ravishes\r\nhis land, but himself receives a mortal wound. The poem concludes with\r\nthe funeral of the old hero.\r\n\r\n=3. The Style.= We give a short extract, along with a literal\r\ntranslation, to illustrate the style. The short lines of the poem are\r\nreally half-lines, and in most editions they are printed in pairs\r\nacross the page. The extract deals with Beowulf’s funeral rites:\r\n\r\n    Him ðá ge-giredan           For him then did the people of the\r\n    Geáta leóde                 Geáts prepare\r\n    Âd on eorðan                Upon the earth\r\n    Un-wác-lícne                A funeral pile, strong,\r\n    Helm-be-hongen              Hung round with helmets,\r\n    Hilde-bordū                 With war-boards and\r\n    Beorhtū byrnū               Bright byrnies[1]\r\n    Swá he béna wæs             As he had requested.\r\n    Ā-legdon ðá to-middes       Weeping the heroes\r\n    Máerne þeóden               Then laid down\r\n    Hæleð hiófende              In the midst\r\n    Hláf-ord leófne             Their dear lord;\r\n    On-gunnon ðá on beorge      Then began the warriors\r\n    Bæl-fýra mæst               To wake upon the hill\r\n    Wigend weccan               The mightiest of bale-fires;\r\n    Wu [du-r] êc á-stáh         The wood smoke rose aloft,\r\n    Sweart of swicðole          Dark from the wood-devourer;[2]\r\n    Swógende let                Noisily it went, mingled\r\n    [Wópe] be-wunden            With weeping; the mixture\r\n    Wind-blond ğ-læg            Of the wind lay on it\r\n    Oð that he tha bàn-hús      Till it the bone-house\r\n    Ge-brocen hæfd[e]           Had broken,\r\n    Hat on hreðre               Hot in his breast:\r\n    Higū un-róte                Sad in mind,\r\n    Mód-ceare mændon            Sorry of mood they moaned\r\n    Mod-dryhtnes [cwealm].      The death of their lord.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the language is abruptly and rudely phrased.\r\nThe half-lines very frequently consist of mere tags or, as they are\r\ncalled, _kennings_. Such conventional phrases were the stock-in-trade\r\nof the gleemen, and they were employed to keep the narrative in some\r\nkind of motion while the invention of the minstrel flagged. At least\r\nhalf of the lines in the extract are kennings--_beorhtū byrnū_,\r\n_hláf-ord leófne_, _higū un-róte_, and so on. Such phrases occur again\r\nand again in Old English poetry. It will also be observed that the\r\nlines are strongly rhythmical, but not metrical; and that there is a\r\nsystem of alliteration, consisting as a rule of two alliterated sounds\r\nin the first half-line and one in the second half-line.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the general narrative style of the poem, there is\r\nmuch primitive vigor in the fighting, sailing, and feasting; a deep\r\nappreciation of the terrors of the sea and of other elemental forces;\r\nand a fair amount of rather tedious repetition and digression.\r\n_Beowulf_, in short, may be justly regarded as the expression of a\r\nhardy, primitive, seafaring folk, reflecting their limitations as well\r\nas their virtues.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER POETRY\r\n\r\n=1. The Pagan Poems.= The bulk of Old English poetry is of a religious\r\ncast, but a few pieces are distinctly secular.\r\n\r\n(_a_) =Widsith= (_i.e._, “the far traveler”) is usually considered to\r\nbe the oldest poem in the language. It consists of more than a hundred\r\nlines of verse, in which a traveler, real or imaginary, recounts the\r\nplaces and persons he has visited. Since he mentions several historical\r\npersonages, the poem is of much interest, but as pure poetry it has\r\nlittle merit.\r\n\r\n(_b_) =Waldhere= (or _Walter_) consists of two fragments, sixty-eight\r\nlines in all, giving some of the exploits of a famous Burgundian hero.\r\nThere is much real vigor in the poem, which ranks high among its\r\nfellows.\r\n\r\n(_c_) =The Fight at Finnesburgh=, a fragment of fifty lines, contains a\r\nfinely told description of the fighting at Finnesburgh.\r\n\r\n(_d_) =The Battle of Brunanburgh= is a spirited piece on this famous\r\nfight, which took place in 937. The poem has much more spirit and\r\noriginality than usual, contains some fine descriptions, and forces the\r\nnarrative along at a comparatively fast pace.\r\n\r\n(_e_) =The Battle of Maldon= is a fragment, but of uncommon freshness\r\nand vivacity. The battle occurred in 993, and the poem seems to be\r\ncontemporary with the event.\r\n\r\n=2. The Dramatic Monologues.= These poems, which are called _The\r\nWanderer_, _The Seafarer_, _Deor’s Complaint_, _The Wife’s Complaint_,\r\n_The Husband’s Message_, and _Wulf and Eadwacer_, appear in the Exeter\r\nBook. It is unlikely that they were composed at the same time, but they\r\nare alike in a curious meditative pathos. In Old English literature\r\nthey come nearest to the lyric. As poetry, they possess the merit of\r\nbeing both original and personal, qualities not common in the poems of\r\nthe period.\r\n\r\n=3. The Cædmon Group.= In his _Historia Ecclesiastica_ Bede tells the\r\nstory of a herdsman Cædmon, who by divine inspiration was transformed\r\nfrom a state of tongue-tied ineffectiveness into that of poetical\r\necstasy. He was summoned into the presence of Hilda of Whitby, who was\r\nabbess during the years 658–80. He was created a monk, and thereafter\r\nsang of many Biblical events. On a blank page of one of the Bede\r\nmanuscripts there is quoted the first divinely inspired hymn of Cædmon,\r\na rude and distinctly uninspired fragment of poetry, nine lines in all,\r\ncomposed in the ancient Northumbrian dialect.\r\n\r\nThat is all we know of the life and works of Cædmon; but in the Junian\r\nmanuscript a series of religious paraphrases was unearthed in the year\r\n1651. In subject they corresponded rather closely to the list set out\r\nby Bede, and in a short time they were ascribed to Cædmon. The poems\r\nconsist of paraphrases of Genesis, Exodus, and Daniel and three shorter\r\npoems, the chief of which is the _Harrowing of Hell_. Modern\r\nscholarship now recognizes that the poems are by different hands, but\r\nthe works can be conveniently lumped together under the name of the\r\nshadowy Northumbrian. The poems appear in the West Saxon dialect, in\r\nspite of the fact that Cædmon must have written in his own dialect; but\r\nthe difficulty is overcome by pointing out that a West Saxon scribe\r\nmight have copied the poems.\r\n\r\nIn merit the poems are unequal. At their best they are not sublime\r\npoetry, but they are strong and spirited pieces with some aptitude in\r\ndescription. On the average they are trudging mediocrities which are\r\nfrequently prosaic and dull.\r\n\r\n=4. The Cynewulf Group.= In 1840 the scholar Kemble lighted upon three\r\nrunic (or pre-Roman) signatures which appeared respectively in the\r\ncourse of the poems called _Christ_ and _Juliana_ (in the Exeter Book)\r\nand _Elene_ (in the Vercelli Book). The signatures read “Cynewulf” or\r\n“Cynwulf.” In 1888 a signature “Fwulcyn” was discovered in _The Fates\r\nof the Apostles_. This is all we know of Cynewulf, if we accept the\r\nquite general personalities that appear in the course of the poems.\r\nYet an elaborate life has been built up for the poet, and other poems,\r\nsimilar in style to the signed pieces, have been attributed to him.\r\n_The Phœnix_, _The Dream of the Rood_, and the _Riddles_ of the Exeter\r\nBook are the most considerable of the additional poems.\r\n\r\nThe Cynewulfian poems are much more scholarly compositions than the\r\n_Beowulf_ or even the Cædmon poems. There is a greater power\r\nof expression, less reliance on the feeble kenning, and some real\r\nexpertness in description. The ideas expressed in the poems are broader\r\nand deeper, and a certain lyrical fervor is not wanting. The date is\r\nprobably the tenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROSE\r\n\r\n=1. Alfred (848–900).= Though there were some prose writings\r\nof an official nature (such as the laws of Ine, who died about 730)\r\nbefore the time of Alfred, there can be little objection to the claim\r\nfrequently made for him, that he is “the father of English prose.” As\r\nhe tells us himself in his preface to the _Pastoral Care_, he was\r\ndriven into authorship by the lamentable state of English learning,\r\ndue in large measure to the depredations of the Danes. Even the\r\nknowledge of Latin was evaporating, so the King, in order to preserve\r\nsome show of learning among the clergy, was compelled to translate\r\nsome popular monastic handbooks into his own tongue. These works\r\nare his contribution to our literature. As he says, they were often\r\n“interpreted word for word, and meaning for meaning”; but they are made\r\nmuch more valuable by reason of the original passages freely introduced\r\ninto them. The books, four in number, are an able selection from the\r\npopular treatises of the day: the _Universal History_ of Orosius;\r\nthe _Ecclesiastical History_ of Bede; the _Pastoral Care_ of\r\nPope Gregory; and the _Consolation of Philosophy_ of Boëthius. His\r\nclaim to the translation of Bede is sometimes disputed; and there is a\r\nfifth work, a _Handbook_ or commonplace book, which has been lost.\r\nThe chronological order of the translations cannot be determined, but\r\nthey were all written during the last years of the reign.\r\n\r\nWe add a brief extract to illustrate his prose style. It is not a\r\nhighly polished style; it is rather that of an earnest but somewhat\r\nunpracticed writer. When it is simplest it is best; in its more\r\ncomplicated passages it is confusing and involved. The vocabulary is\r\nsimple and unforced.\r\n\r\n  Swa clæne heo wæs oðfeallen        So clean [completely] has\r\n  on Angelcynne [-þ] swiðe feawa     ruin fallen on the English nation,\r\n  wæron be-heonan Humbre þe          that very few were there\r\n  hira þe-nunge cuðon understanden   this side the Humber that could\r\n  on Englisc, oððe furðon            understand their service in\r\n  an ærend-ge-writ of Ledene         English or declare forth an\r\n  on Englisc areccan; and ic         Epistle [an errand-writing]\r\n  wene [-þ] naht monige be-geondan   out of Latin into English; and\r\n  Humbre næron.

Ælfric= (=955–1020=) is known as “the Grammarian.” Of his life\r\nlittle is known. It is probable that he lived near Winchester, and\r\nhe was certainly the first abbot of Eynsham, near Oxford, in 1006. A\r\nfair number of his works, both in Latin and English, have come down\r\nto us. Of his English books, two series of homilies, adapted from the\r\nLatin, seem to have been composed about the year 990. A third series of\r\nhomilies, called _The Lives of the Saints_, is dated approximately at\r\n996. Several of his pastoral letters survive, as well as a translation\r\nof Bede’s _De Temporibus_ and some English translations of Biblical\r\npassages.\r\n\r\nÆlfric’s style is interesting, for it is representative of the\r\nscholarly prose of his time, a century after Alfred. It is flowing and\r\nvigorous, showing an almost excessive use of alliteration. In many\r\ncases it suggests a curious hybrid between the poetry and prose of the\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n=3. Wulfstan= was Archbishop of York from 1003 till his death in 1023.\r\nIn his prose, which survives in more than fifty homilies and in\r\nhis famous _Letter to the English People_ (_Lupi Sermo ad Anglos_),\r\nhe shows the effects of “style” to a marked degree. His _Letter_ in\r\nparticular is a fervid epistle, detailing with considerable power and\r\nfluency the dreadful plight of the English nation in the year 1014. The\r\nalliteration and rhythm are exceedingly well marked, much more so than\r\nin the case of Ælfric.\r\n\r\n=4.= The =Anglo-Saxon Chronicle= was probably inspired by King Alfred,\r\nwho is said even to have dictated the entries dealing with his own\r\ncampaigns. The _Chronicle_ has come down to us in four versions, all of\r\nwhich seem to have sprung from a common stock. The four versions are\r\npreserved in seven manuscripts, of which the most notable are those\r\nconnected with Canterbury and Peterborough. From the period of the\r\nEnglish invasions till the year 892 the books are fairly in accord.\r\nAt the latter year they diverge. Each introduces its local events and\r\nmiscellaneous items of news, and they finish at different dates. The\r\nlast date of all is about the middle of the twelfth century.\r\n\r\nThe style of the _Chronicle_ varies greatly; it ranges from the baldest\r\nnotes and summaries to quite ambitious passages of narrative and\r\ndescription. Of the latter class the well-known passage on the horrors\r\nof Stephen’s reign is a worthy example. We give a brief extract, dated\r\n1100, just at the close of the Old English period, which is a fair\r\naverage of the different methods:\r\n\r\n  On þisum geare aras seo ungeþwærnes      In the year arose the discord\r\n  on Glæstinga byrig                       in Glastonbury betwixt the Abbot\r\n  betwyx þam abbode Ðurstane               Thurstan and his monks.\r\n  and his munecan.

In the mass the advance appears to be considerable, but\r\nwhen we reflect that it represents the growth of some five hundred\r\nyears, we see that the rate of progress is undoubtedly slow. We shall\r\ntake the poetical and prose forms separately.\r\n\r\n=1. Poetry.= Poetry is much earlier in the field, and its development\r\nis the greater. It begins with the rude forms of _Beowulf_ and\r\nconcludes with the more scholarly paraphrases of Cynewulf.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The _epic_ in its untutored form exists in _Beowulf_. This poem\r\nlacks the finer qualities of the epic: it is deficient in the strict\r\nunity, the high dignity, and the broad motive of the great classical\r\nepic; but a crude vigor and a certain rude majesty are not wanting.\r\nIt is no mean beginning for the English epic. The later poems of the\r\nCædmon and Cynewulf types are too discursive and didactic to be epics,\r\nthough in places they are like _The Battle of Maldon_ and _The Fight at\r\nFinnesburgh_ in their narrative force.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The _lyric_--that is, the short and passionate expression of a\r\npersonal feeling--hardly exists at all. The nearest approach to it lies\r\nin the dramatic monologues, such as _Deor’s Complaint_. These poems\r\nare too long and diffuse to be real lyrics, but they have some of the\r\nexpressive melancholy and personal emotion of the lyric.\r\n\r\n=2. Prose.= The great bulk of Old English prose consists of\r\ntranslation; and in its various shapes English prose adopts the methods\r\nof its originals. We have many homilies, some history, and a few\r\npastoral letters, all based strictly upon Latin works. There are very\r\nfew passages of real originality, and they are short and disjointed.\r\nOf historical writing we have the rudiments in the _Anglo-Saxon\r\nChronicle_. On the whole, the development is very small, for the prose\r\nis bound by the curse of imitativeness.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF LITERARY STYLE\r\n\r\n=1. Poetry.= We have once more to distinguish between the earlier\r\n_Beowulf_ stage and the later Cynewulf stage. In the earlier period\r\nthe style is more disjointed, abrupt, and digressive, and is weighted\r\ndown by the reliance upon the kenning. In the later stage there is\r\ngreater passion and insight, less reliance upon the stock phrases, and\r\na greater desire for stylistic effects.\r\n\r\n=2. Prose.= In spite of its limited scope, Old English prose shows\r\nquite an advance in style. The earlier style, represented by the prose\r\nof Alfred, is rather halting and unformed, the sentences are loosely\r\nknit, the vocabulary is meager, and there is an absence of the finer\r\nqualities of rhythm and cadence. By the time of Wulfstan the prose\r\nhas gained in fluency. It is much more animated and confident, and it\r\nfreely employs alliteration and the commoner rhetorical figures.\r\n\r\nBut within this development both of prose and poetry there was\r\nalready the seed of decay. During the last century of the period the\r\npoetical impulse was weakening; there is little verse after the time\r\nof Cynewulf. The prose too was failing, and the language was showing\r\nsymptoms of weakness. The inflections were loosening even before the\r\nNorman Conquest, and the Old English vocabulary was being subtly\r\nGallicized. The Norman Conquest was in time to put an abrupt finish to\r\na process already well advanced.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               EXERCISES\r\n\r\n1.

What appears to you to be the reasons why in Old English poetry\r\nappears before prose?\r\n\r\n4. Mention some of the effects of translation upon both the poetry and\r\nthe prose of the Old English.\r\n\r\n5. “Old English prose is much nearer modern English prose than Old\r\nEnglish poetry is to modern English poetry.” Discuss this statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                       THE MIDDLE ENGLISH PERIOD\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND (1050–1350)\r\n\r\nThe extensive period covered by this chapter saw many developments\r\nin the history of England: the establishment of Norman and Angevin\r\ndynasties; the class-struggle between king, nobles, clergy, and people;\r\nand the numerous wars against France, Scotland, and Wales. But, from\r\nthe literary point of view, much more important than definite events\r\nwere the general movements of the times: the rise of the religious\r\norders, their early enthusiasm, and their subsequent decay; the\r\nblossoming of chivalry and the spirit of romance, bringing new sympathy\r\nfor the poor and for womankind; the Crusades, and the widening of the\r\nEuropean outlook which was gradually to expand into the rebirth of the\r\nintellect known as the Renaissance. All these were only symptoms of a\r\ngrowing intelligence that was strongly reflected in the literature of\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE\r\n\r\nThis period witnesses the disappearance of the pure Old English\r\nlanguage and the emergence of the mixed Anglo-French or Middle English\r\nspeech that was to be the parent of modern English. As a written\r\nlanguage Old English disappears about 1050, and, also as a written\r\nlanguage, Middle English first appears about the year 1200. With the\r\nappearance of the _Brut_ about 1200 we have the beginning of\r\nthe numerous Middle English texts, amply illustrating the changes\r\nthat have been wrought in the interval: the loss of a great part of\r\nthe Old English vocabulary; a great and growing inrush of French\r\nwords; the confusion, crumbling, and ultimate loss of most of the old\r\ninflections; and the development of the dialects. There are three main\r\ndialects in Middle English: the Northern, corresponding to the older\r\nNorthumbrian; the Midland, corresponding to Mercian; and the Southern,\r\ncorresponding to the Old English Kentish or Southern. None of the three\r\ncan claim the superiority until late in the period, when the Midland\r\ngradually assumes a slight predominance that is strongly accentuated in\r\nthe period following.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY FEATURES OF THE AGE\r\n\r\nThe latter part of the three hundred years now under review provides a\r\nlarge amount of interesting, important, and sometimes delightful works.\r\nIt is, however, the general features that count for most, for there is\r\nhardly anything of outstanding individual importance.\r\n\r\n=1. The Transition.= The period is one of transition and experiment.\r\nThe old poetical methods are vanishing, and the poets are groping after\r\na new system. English poets had two models to follow--the French and\r\nthe Latin, which were not entirely independent of each other. For a\r\ntime, early in the period, the French and Latin methods weighed heavily\r\nupon English literature; but gradually the more typically native\r\nfeatures, such as the systematic use of alliteration, emerge. It is\r\nlikely that all the while oral tradition had preserved the ancient\r\nmethods in popular songs, but that influence was slight for a long\r\nperiod after the Norman Conquest.\r\n\r\n=2.= The =anonymous= nature of the writing is still strongly in\r\nevidence. A large proportion of the works are entirely without known\r\nauthors; most of the authors whose names appear are names only;\r\nthere is indeed only one, the Hermit of Hampole, about whom we have\r\nany definite biographical detail. There is an entire absence of any\r\noutstanding literary personality.\r\n\r\n=3. The Domination of Poetry.= The great bulk of the surviving material\r\nis poetry, which is used for many kinds of miscellaneous work, such as\r\nhistory, geography, divinity, and rudimentary science. Most of the\r\nwork is monastic hack-work, and much of it is in consequence of little\r\nmerit.\r\n\r\nCompared with poetry of the period, the prose is meager in quantity\r\nand undeveloped in style. The common medium of the time was Latin and\r\nFrench, and English prose was starved. Nearly all the prose consists of\r\nhomilies, of the nature of the _Ancren Riwle_; and most of them\r\nare servile translations from Latin, and destitute of individual style.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOETRY\r\n\r\nFor the sake of convenience we can classify the different poems into\r\nthree groups, according to the nature of their subjects.\r\n\r\n=1. The Rhyming Chronicles.= During this period there is an unusual\r\nabundance of chronicles in verse. They are distinguished by their\r\ningenuous use of incredible stories, the copiousness of their\r\ninvention, and in no small number of cases by the vivacity of their\r\nstyle.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _The Brut._ This poem was written by a certain =Layamon=\r\nabout the year 1205. We gather a few details about the author in a\r\nbrief prologue to the poem itself. He seems to have been a monk in\r\nGloucestershire; his language certainly is of a nature that corresponds\r\nclosely to the dialect of that district. The work, thirty thousand\r\nlines in length, is a paraphrase and expansion of the Anglo-Norman\r\n_Brut d’Angleterre_ of Wace, who in turn simply translated from\r\nGeoffrey of Monmouth’s Latin history of Britain. In the _Brut_ the\r\nfounder of the British race is Brutus, great-grandson of Æneas of Troy.\r\nBrutus lands in England, founds London, and becomes the progenitor\r\nof the earliest line of British kings. In style the poem is often\r\nlifeless, though it has a naïve simplicity that is attractive. The form\r\nof the work, however, is invaluable as marking the transition from the\r\nOld English to the Middle English method.\r\n\r\nAlliteration, the basis of the earlier types, survives in a casual\r\nmanner; at irregular intervals there are rudely rhyming couplets,\r\nsuggesting the newer methods; the lines themselves, though they are of\r\nfairly uniform length, can rarely be scanned; the basis of the line\r\nseems to be four accents, occurring with fair regularity. The following\r\nextract should be scrutinized carefully to bring out these features:\r\n\r\n    To niht a mine slepe,           At night in my slepe\r\n    Their ich læi on bure,          Where I lay in bower [chamber]\r\n    Me imæette a sweuen;            I dreamt a dream--\r\n    Ther oure ich full sari æm.     Therefore I full sorry am.\r\n    Me imætte that mon me hof       I dreamt that men lifted me\r\n    Uppen are halle.                Up on a hall;\r\n    Tha halle ich gon bestriden,    The hall I gan bestride,\r\n    Swulc ich wolde riden           As if I would ride;\r\n    Alle tha lond tha ich ah        All the lands that I owned,\r\n    Alle ich ther ouer sah.         All I there overlooked.\r\n    And Walwain sat biuoren me;     And Walwain sate before me;\r\n    Mi sweord he bar an honde.      My sword he bare in hand.\r\n    Tha com Moddred faren ther      Then approached Modred there,\r\n    Mid unimete uolke.              With innumerable folk.\r\n\r\n(_b_) =Robert of Gloucester= is known only through his rhyming history.\r\nFrom internal evidence it is considered likely that he wrote about\r\n1300. From his dialect, and from local details that he introduces into\r\nthe poem, it is probable that he belonged to Gloucestershire. Drawing\r\nlargely upon Layamon, Geoffrey of Monmouth, and other chroniclers, he\r\nbegins his history of England with Brutus and carries it down to the\r\nyear 1270. The style of the poem is often lively enough; and the meter,\r\nthough rough and irregular, often suggests the later “fourteener.” As a\r\nrule the lines are longer than those of the _Brut_, and the number of\r\naccents is greater.\r\n\r\n(_c_) =Robert Manning (1264–1340)= is sometimes known as Robert of\r\nBrunne, or Bourne, in Lincolnshire. In 1288 he entered a Gilbertine\r\nmonastery near his native town. His _Story of Ingelond_ (1338) begins\r\nwith the Deluge, and traces the descent of the English kings back to\r\nNoah. The latter portion of the book is based upon the work of Pierre\r\nde Langtoft, and the first part upon Wace’s _Brut_. The meter is a kind\r\nof chaotic alexandrine verse; but an interesting feature is that the\r\ncouplet rhymes are carefully executed, with the addition of occasional\r\nmiddle rhymes.\r\n\r\nManning’s _Handlyng Synne_ (1303) is a religious manual based on\r\na French work, _Manuel des Pechiez_. The poem, which is thirteen\r\nthousand lines in length, is a series of metrical sermons on the Ten\r\nCommandments, the Seven Deadly Sins, and the Seven Sacraments. The\r\nauthor knows how to enliven the work with agreeable anecdotes, and\r\nthere are signs of a keen observation. The meter is an approximation to\r\nthe octosyllabic couplet.\r\n\r\nManning’s language is of importance because it marks a close approach\r\nto that of Chaucer: a comparative absence of old words and inflections,\r\na copious use of the later French terms, and the adoption of new\r\nphrases.\r\n\r\n(_d_) =Laurence Minot=, who probably flourished about 1350, appears\r\nas the author of eleven political songs, which were first published\r\nin 1795. The pieces, which sing of the exploits of Edward III, are\r\nviolently patriotic in temper, and have a rudely poetical vigor. Their\r\nmeters are often highly developed.\r\n\r\n=2. Religious and Didactic Poetry.= Like most of the other poetry of\r\nthe period, this kind was strongly imitative, piously credulous, and\r\nenormous in length.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The _Ormulum_, by a certain =Orm=, or =Ormin=, is usually dated\r\nat 1200. As it survives it is an enormous fragment, twenty thousand\r\nlines in length, and composed in the East Midland dialect. It consists\r\nof a large number of religious homilies addressed to a person called\r\nWalter. Of poetical merit the poem is destitute; but it is unique\r\nin the immense care shown over a curious and complicated system of\r\nspelling, into which we have not the space to enter. Its metrical\r\nform is noteworthy: a rigidly iambic measure, rhymeless, arranged\r\nin alternate lines of eight and seven syllables respectively. This\r\nregularity of meter is another unique feature of the poem, which we\r\nillustrate by an extract:\r\n\r\n    An Romanisshe Kaserrking              A Roman Kaiser-king\r\n      Wass Augusstuss [gh]ehatenn           Was called Augustus\r\n    And he wass wurrthenn Kaserrking      And he became Kaiser-king\r\n      Off all mannkinn onn eorthe,          Of all mankind on earth,\r\n    And he gann thenkenn off himmsellf    And he gan think of himself\r\n      And off hiss micle riche.             And of his muckle kingdom,\r\n    And he bigann to thenkenn tha,        And he began to think\r\n      Swa summ the goddspell kithethth      Just as the gospel tells\r\n    Off thatt he wollde witenn wel        Of what he would well know\r\n      Hu mikell fehh himm come,             How much money [fee] would\r\n                                              come to him\r\n    [GH]iff himm off all hiss kinedom.    If to him of all his kingdom\r\n      Illc mann an penning [gh]æfe.         Each man a penny gave.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The Owl and the Nightingale_, the date of which is commonly\r\ngiven as 1250, is attributed to =Nicholas of Guildford=. The poem\r\nconsists of a long argument between the nightingale, representing\r\nthe lighter joys of life, and the owl, which stands for wisdom and\r\nsobriety. The poem is among the most lively of its kind, and the\r\nargument tends to become heated. In meter it is rhyming octosyllabic\r\ncouplets, much more regular than was common at the time.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The _Orison to Our Lady_, _Genesis_ and _Exodus_, the _Bestiary_,\r\nthe _Moral Ode_, the _Proverbs of Alfred_, and the _Proverbs of\r\nHendyng_ are usually placed about the middle of the thirteenth century.\r\nOf originality there is little to comment upon; but as metrical\r\nexperiments they are of great importance. The _Proverbs_ show some\r\nregular stanza-formation, and the _Moral Ode_ is remarkable for the\r\nsteadiness and maturity of its measure, a long line coming very close\r\nto the fourteener.\r\n\r\n(_d_) The _Cursor Mundi_ was composed about 1320. It is a kind of\r\nreligious epic, twenty-four thousand lines long, composed in the\r\nNorthern dialect. The author, who divides his history into seven\r\nstages, draws upon both the Old and the New Testaments. The meter shows\r\na distinct advance in its grip of the octosyllabic couplet.\r\n\r\n(_e_) =Richard Rolle of Hampole=, who died in 1349, is one of the few\r\ncontemporary figures about whom definite personal facts are recorded.\r\nHe was born in Yorkshire, educated at Oxford, and ran away from home to\r\nbecome a hermit. Subsequently he removed to Hampole, near Doncaster,\r\nwhere he enjoyed a great reputation for sanctity and good works.\r\n\r\nHe wrote some miscellaneous prose and a few short poems, but his chief\r\nimportance lies in his authorship of the long poem _The Pricke of\r\nConscience_. This work, which is based upon the writings of the\r\nearly Christian Fathers, describes the joys and sorrows of a man’s\r\nlife as he is affected in turn by good and evil. The meter is a close\r\napproximation to the octosyllabic couplet, which shows extensions\r\nand variations that often resemble the heroic measure. It has been\r\nsuggested that Hampole is the first English writer to use the heroic\r\ncouplet; but it is almost certain that his heroic couplets are\r\naccidental.\r\n\r\n(_f_) _The Alliterative Poems._ In a unique manuscript, now preserved\r\nin the British Museum, are found four remarkably fine poems in the West\r\nMidland dialect: _Pearl_, _Cleannesse_, _Patience_, and _Sir Gawain\r\nand the Green Knight_. There is no indication of the authorship, but\r\njudging from the similarity of the style it is considered likely that\r\nthey are by the same poet. The date is about 1300. The first three\r\npoems are religious in theme, and of them _Pearl_ is undoubtedly the\r\nbest. This poem, half allegorical in nature, tells of a vision in which\r\nthe poet seeks his precious pearl that has slipped away from him. In\r\nhis quest he spies his pearl, which seems to be the symbol of a dead\r\nmaiden, and obtains a glimpse of the Eternal Jerusalem. The poem,\r\nwhich contains long discussions between the poet and the pearl, has\r\nsome passages of real, moving beauty, and there is a sweet melancholy\r\ninflection in some of the verses that is rare indeed among the fumbling\r\npoetasters of the time. The meter is extraordinarily complicated:\r\nheavily alliterated twelve-lined stanzas, with intricate rhymes\r\narranged on a triple basis (see p. 149). _Cleannesse_ and _Patience_,\r\nmore didactic in theme, are of less interest and beauty, but they have\r\nan exultation and stern energy that make them conspicuous among the\r\npoems of the period. They are composed in a kind of alliterative blank\r\nverse. _Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_ is one of the most captivating\r\nof the romances. Its meter also is freely alliterated and built into\r\nirregular rhyming stanzas which sometimes run into twenty lines.\r\n\r\n=3. The Metrical Romances.= The great number of the romances that\r\nnow appear in our literature can be classified according to subject.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The romances dealing with early English history and its heroes\r\nwere very numerous. Of these the lively _Horn_ and _Havelock the Dane_\r\nand the popular _Guy of Warwick_ and _Bevis of Hampton_ were among the\r\nbest. Even contemporary history was sometimes drawn upon, as in the\r\nwell-known _Richard Cœur-de-Lion_.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Allied to the last group are the immense number of Arthurian\r\nromances, which are closely related and often of high merit. _Sir\r\nTristrem_, one of the earliest, is by no means one of the worst; to\r\nit we may add the famous _Arthur and Merlin_, _Ywain and Gawain_, the\r\n_Morte d’Arthure_, and _Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_.\r\n\r\n(_c_) There was also a large number of classical themes, such as\r\nthe exploits of Alexander the Great and the siege of Troy. _King\r\nAlisaunder_ is very long, but of more than average merit. Further\r\nexamples are _Sir Orpheo_ and _The Destruction of Troy_.\r\n\r\n(_d_) The group dealing with the feats of Charlemagne is smaller, and\r\nthe quality is lower. _Rauf Coilyear_, an alliterative romance, is\r\nprobably the best of them, and to it we may add _Sir Ferumbras_.\r\n\r\n(_e_) A large number of the romances deal with events which are to\r\nsome extent contemporary with the composition. They are miscellaneous\r\nin subject, but they are of much interest and some of them of great\r\nbeauty. _Amis and Amiloun_ is a touching love-story; _William of\r\nPalerne_ is on the familiar “missing heir” theme; and _The Squire\r\nof Low Degree_, who loved the king’s daughter of Hungary, is among\r\nthe best known of all the romances.\r\n\r\nIt would take a volume to comment in detail upon the romances. The\r\nvariety of their meter and style is very great; but in general terms we\r\nmay say that the prevailing subject is of a martial and amatory nature;\r\nthere is the additional interest of the supernatural, which enters\r\nfreely into the story; and one of the most attractive features to the\r\nmodern reader of this delightful class of fiction is the frequent\r\nglimpses obtainable into the habits of the time.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROSE\r\n\r\n=1.= The =Ancren Riwle=, or _Rule of Anchoresses_, is one of the\r\nearliest of Middle English prose texts, for it dates from about 1200.\r\nThe book, which is written in a simple, matter-of-fact style, is a\r\nmanual composed for the guidance of a small religious community of\r\nwomen which then existed in Somersetshire. Nothing certain is known\r\nregarding the author. Its Southern dialect shows some traces of\r\nMidland. As in some respects the text is the forerunner of modern\r\nprose, we give an extract:\r\n\r\n    Uorþi was ihoten a Godes            Therefore it was ordered on\r\n    half iðen olde lawe þet put         the part of God in the old law\r\n    were euer iwrien; & [gh]if eni      that a pit should be ever\r\n      unwrie                              covered,\r\n    put were, & best feolle             and if there were any uncovered\r\n    þerinne, he hit schulde [gh]elden   pit, and a beast fell\r\n    þet þene put unwrieh. Ðis is a      therein, he should pay for it,\r\n    swuðe dredlich word to wummen       that uncovered the pit. This is\r\n    þet scheaweð her to wep-monnes      a very dreadful saying for a\r\n    eien. Heo is bitocned               woman that shows herself to a\r\n    bi þe þet unwrieð þene put: þe      man’s eyes. She is betokened\r\n    put is hire veire neb, & hire       by the person that uncovers the\r\n    hwite swire, & hire hond, [gh]if    pit; the pit is her fair face,\r\n      hes                                 and\r\n    halt forð in his eihsihðe.          her white neck, and her hand, if\r\n                                        she holds it forth in his\r\n                                          eyesight.\r\n\r\n\r\n=2.= The =Ayenbite of Inwyt= was written by Dan Michel of Northgate,\r\nwho flourished about 1340. The book is a servile translation of a\r\nFrench work, and is of little literary importance. To the philologist\r\nit is very useful as an example of the Southern dialect of the period.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF LITERARY FORMS\r\n\r\n=1. Poetry.= (_a_) _Meter_. The most interesting feature of this\r\nperiod is the development of the modern system of rhymed meters,\r\nwhich displaced the Old English alliterative measures. Between the\r\nOld English poems of Cynewulf (about 950) and the Middle English\r\n_Brut_ (about 1205) there is a considerable gap both in time and in\r\ndevelopment. This gap is only slightly bridged by the few pieces which\r\nwe proceed to quote.\r\n\r\nA quatrain dated at about 1100 is as follows:\r\n\r\n    Merrie sungen the muneches binnen Ely,\r\n    Tha Cnut chining[3] reu[4] ther by;\r\n    “Roweth, cnichtes, noer the land,\r\n    And here we thes muneches sang.”\r\n\r\nIn this example we have two rough couplets. The first pair rhyme, and\r\nin the second pair there is a fair example of assonance. The meter,\r\nas far as it exists at all, is a cross between octosyllables and\r\ndecasyllables.\r\n\r\nA few brief fragments by Godric, who died in 1170, carry the process\r\nstill further. The following lines may be taken as typical:\r\n\r\n    Sainte Nicholaes, Godes druth,\r\n    Tymbre[5] us faire scone[6] hus,\r\n    At thy burth,[7] at thy bare,[7]\r\n    Sainte Nicholaes, bring us wel thare.\r\n\r\nThese lines are almost regular, and the rhyme in the second couplet is\r\nperfect.\r\n\r\nThe _Brut_, with its ragged four-accented and nearly rhymeless lines,\r\nshows no further advance; but the _Ormulum_, though it does without\r\nrhyme, is remarkable for the regularity of its meter. Then during\r\nthe thirteenth century there comes a large number of poems, chiefly\r\nromances and homilies. Much of the verse, such as in _Horn_, _Havelock\r\nthe Dane_, and the works of Manning, is in couplet form. It is nearly\r\ndoggerel very often, and hesitates between four and five feet. This is\r\nthe rough work that Chaucer is to make perfect. The following example\r\nof this traditional verse should be carefully scanned:\r\n\r\n    For Engelond ys ful ynow of fruyt and of tren,\r\n    Of wodes and of parkes, that joye yt ys to sen.\r\n    Of foules and of bestes of wylde and tame also.\r\n    Of salt fysch and eche fresch, and fayr ryueres ther to.\r\n    Of welles swete and colde ynow, of lesen and of mede.\r\n    Of seluer or and of gold, of tyn and of lede.\r\n                                             ROBERT OF GLOUCESTER\r\n\r\nDuring the fourteenth century, with the increase of dexterity, came\r\nthe desire for experiment. Stanzas in the manner of the French were\r\ndeveloped, and the short or _bobbed_ line was introduced. The expansion\r\nof the lyric helped the development of the stanza. Thus we pass through\r\nthe fairly elaborate meters of Minot, the _Proverbs of Hendyng_, and\r\nthe romances (like _The King of Tars_) in the Romance sestette, to the\r\nextremely complicated verses of _Sir Tristrem_, _Sir Gawain and the\r\nGreen Knight_, and _Pearl_. We add a specimen of the popular Romance\r\nsestette, and a verse from a popular song of the period.\r\n\r\n    (1) The King of Tars came also\r\n        The Soudan battle for to do,\r\n          With many a Christian Knight;\r\n        Either host gan the other assail,\r\n        There began a strong battail\r\n          That grisley was of sight.\r\n                          _The King of Tars_\r\n\r\n    (2) Sitteth alle stille, ant herkneth to me:\r\n        The kyn of Alemaigne,[8] bi mi leaute[9]\r\n        Thritti thousent pound askede he\r\n        For te make the pees[10] in the countre\r\n              Ant so he dude more.\r\n            Richard, thah thou be euer trichard,[11]\r\n              Trichten shalt thou neuer more.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The Lyric._ The most delightful feature of the period is\r\nthe appearance of the lyric. There can be little doubt that from\r\nOld English times popular songs were common, but it is not till\r\nthe thirteenth century that they receive a permanent place in the\r\nmanuscripts. We then obtain several specimens that for sweetness and\r\nlyrical power are most satisfying.\r\n\r\nApart from its native element, the lyric of the time drew its\r\nmain inspiration from the songs of the French _jongleurs_ and the\r\nmagnificent, rhymed Latin hymns (such as _Dies Iræ_ and _Stabat Mater_)\r\nof the Church. These hymns, nobly phrased and rhymed, were splendid\r\nmodels to follow. Many of the early English lyrics were devoutly\r\nreligious in theme, especially those addressed to the Virgin Mary; a\r\nlarge number, such as the charming _Alysoun_, are love-lyrics; and many\r\nmore, such as the cuckoo song quoted below (one of the oldest of all),\r\nare nature-lyrics. In the song below note the regularity of the meter:\r\n\r\n    Sumer is i-cumen in,              Summer is coming,\r\n      Lhude sing cuccu:                 Loud sing cuckoo:\r\n    Groweth sed, and bloweth med,     Groweth seed and bloweth mead,\r\n      And springth the wde nu.          And springeth the wood now.\r\n        Sing cuccu, cuccu.                Sing cuckoo, cuckoo.\r\n\r\n    Awe bleteth after lombe,          Ewe bleateth after lamb,\r\n      Lhouth after calue cu;            Loweth after calf the cow;\r\n    Bulluc sterteth, bucke verteth;   Bullock starteth, buck verteth[12]\r\n      Murie sing cuccu,                 Merry sing cuckoo:\r\n        Cuccu, cuccu.                     Cuckoo, cuckoo.\r\n    Wel singes thu, cuccu;            Well sing’st thou, cuckoo;\r\n    Ne swik thu nauer nu.             Nor cease thou ever now.\r\n      Sing cuccu nu,                    Sing cuckoo now,\r\n        Sing, cuccu.                      Sing, cuckoo.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _The Metrical Romances._ A romance was originally a composition\r\nin the Romance tongue, but the meaning was narrowed into that of a tale\r\nof the kind described in the next paragraph. Romances were brought into\r\nEngland by the French minstrels, who as early as the eleventh century\r\nhad amassed a large quantity of material. By the beginning of the\r\nfourteenth century the romance appears in English, and from that point\r\nthe rate of production is great. Romantic tales are the main feature of\r\nthe literature of the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n         TABLE TO ILLUSTRATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF LITERARY FORMS\r\n\r\n    +----+---------------------------------+--------------------------+\r\n    |    |             POETRY              |          PROSE           |\r\n    |YEAR+----------+-----------+----------+------------+-------------+\r\n    |    |  Lyrical | Narrative | Didactic | Narrative  |   Didactic  |\r\n    +----+----------+-----------+----------+------------+-------------+\r\n    |    |          | _Beowulf_ |          |            |             |\r\n    |    |          |           |          |            |             |\r\n    | 700|          |         Cædmon       |            |             |\r\n    +----+----------+-----------+----------+------------+-------------+\r\n    |    |          |           |          |            |             |\r\n    |    |          |           |          |            |             |\r\n    | 800|          |           |          |            |             |\r\n    +----+----------+-----------+----------+------------+-------------+\r\n    |    |          |           |          |            |             |\r\n    |    |          |           |          |            |             |\r\n    | 900|          |           |          |            | Alfred      |\r\n    +----+----------+-----------+----------+------------+-------------+\r\n    |    |          |           |          |    A.S.    |             |\r\n    |    |          |       Cynewulf       | CHRONICLE  |             |\r\n    |1000|          |           |          |            | Ælfric      |\r\n    +----+----------+-----------+----------+------------+-------------+\r\n    |    |          |           |          |            | Wulfstan    |\r\n    |    |          |           |          |            |             |\r\n    |1100|          |           |          |            |             |\r\n    +----+----------+-----------+----------+------------+-------------+\r\n    |    |          |           |          |            |             |\r\n    |    |          |           |_Ormulum_ |            |             |\r\n    |1200|          |           |          |            |             |\r\n    +----+----------+-----------+----------+------------+-------------+\r\n    |    |          |  _Brut_   |          |            |_AncrenRiwle_|\r\n    |    |          |           |          |            |             |\r\n    |1300|          |           |  Manning |            |             |\r\n    +----+----------+-----------+----------+------------+-------------+\r\n    |    |_Alysoun_,|    THE    |  Hampole |            |             |\r\n    |    | etc.     |  ROMANCES |          |            |             |\r\n    |    |          |           |          |            |             |\r\n    |1400|          |    _Cursor Mundi_    |            |             |\r\n    +----+----------+-----------+----------+------------+-------------+\r\n\r\nThe chief features of the romance were: a long story, cumulative\r\nin construction, chiefly of a journey or a quest; a strong martial\r\nelement, with an infusion of the supernatural and wonderful;\r\ncharacters, usually of high social rank, and of fixed type and\r\nrudimentary workmanship, such as the knightly hero, the distressed\r\ndamsel, and the wicked enchanter; and a style that was simple to\r\nquaintness, but in the better specimens was spirited and suggestive of\r\nmystery and wonder. In meter it ranged from the simple couplet of _The\r\nSquire of Low Degree_ to the twenty-lined stanza of _Sir Tristrem_.

Prose.= The small amount of prose is strictly practical in\r\npurpose, and its development as a species of literature is to come\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF STYLE IN POETRY\r\n\r\nWith poetry in such an immature condition, it can be easily understood\r\nthat style is of secondary importance. The prevailing, almost the\r\nuniversal, style is one of artless simplicity. Very often, owing\r\nchiefly to lack of practice on the part of the poet, the style becomes\r\nobscure; and when more ambitious schemes of meter are attempted (as\r\nin _Pearl_) the same cause leads to the same result. Humor is rarely\r\nfound in Middle English, but quaint touches are not entirely lacking,\r\nas facts revealed in the life of Hampole show. Pathos of a solemn and\r\nelevated kind appears in the _Moral Ode_, and the romance called _The\r\nPistyl of Susan_ and the _Pearl_, already mentioned, have passages of\r\nsimple pathos.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               EXERCISES\r\n\r\n1.

Account for the poor quality of English prose during this period.\r\n\r\n3. What were the effects of the Norman Conquest upon English literature?\r\n\r\n4. Describe the main features of the romance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                          THE AGE OF CHAUCER\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND (1350–1450)\r\n\r\nCompared with the periods covered by the last two chapters, the period\r\nnow under review is quite short. It includes the greater part of the\r\nreign of Edward III and the long French wars associated with his name;\r\nthe accession of his grandson Richard II (1377); and the revolution of\r\n1399, the deposition of Richard, and the foundation of the Lancastrian\r\ndynasty. From the literary point of view, of greater importance are the\r\nsocial and intellectual movements of the period: the terrible plague\r\ncalled the Black Death, bringing poverty, unrest, and revolt among the\r\npeasants, and the growth of the spirit of inquiry, which was strongly\r\ncritical of the ways of the Church, and found expression in the\r\nteachings of Wyclif and the Lollards, and in the stern denunciations of\r\nLangland.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY FEATURES OF THE AGE\r\n\r\n=1. The Standardizing of English.= The period of transition is now\r\nnearly over. The English language has shaken down to a kind of\r\naverage--to the standard of the East Midland speech, the language of\r\nthe capital city and of the universities. The other dialects, with the\r\nexception of the Scottish branch, rapidly melt away from literature,\r\ntill they become quite exiguous. French and English have amalgamated\r\nto form the standard English tongue, which attains to its first full\r\nexpression in the works of Chaucer.\r\n\r\n=2.= A curious =“modern” note= begins to be apparent at this period.\r\nThere is a sharper spirit of criticism, a more searching interest in\r\nman’s affairs, and a less childlike faith in, and a less complacent\r\nacceptance of, the established order. The vogue of the romance, though\r\nit has by no means gone, is passing, and in Chaucer it is derided.\r\nThe freshness of the romantic ideal is being superseded by the more\r\nacute spirit of the drama, which even at this early time is faintly\r\nforeshadowed. Another more modern feature that at once strikes the\r\nobserver is that the age of anonymity is passing away. Though many of\r\nthe texts still lack named authors, the greater number of the books can\r\nbe definitely ascribed. Moreover, we have for the first time a figure\r\nof outstanding literary importance, who gives to the age the form and\r\npressure of his genius.\r\n\r\n=3. Prose.= This era sees the foundation of an English prose style.\r\nEarlier specimens have been experimental or purely imitative; now, in\r\nthe works of Mandeville and Malory, we have prose that is both original\r\nand individual. The English tongue is now ripe for a prose style. The\r\nlanguage is settling to a standard; Latin and French are losing grip\r\nas popular prose mediums; and the growing desire for an English Bible\r\nexercises a steady pressure in favor of a standard English prose.\r\n\r\n=4. Scottish Literature.= For the first time in our literature, in the\r\nperson of Barbour (died 1395), Scotland supplies a writer worthy of\r\nnote. This is only the beginning; for the tradition is handed on to the\r\npowerful group of poets who are mentioned in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOFFREY CHAUCER (1340–1400)\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= In many of the documents of the time Chaucer’s name\r\nis mentioned with some frequency; and these references, in addition to\r\nsome remarks he makes regarding himself in the course of his poems,\r\nare the sum of what we know about his life. The date of his birth is\r\nuncertain, but it is now generally accepted as being 1340. He was born\r\nin London, entered the household of the wife of the Duke of Clarence\r\n(1357), and saw military service abroad, where he was captured. Next\r\nhe seems to have entered the royal household, for he is frequently\r\nmentioned as the recipient of royal pensions and bounties. When\r\nRichard II succeeded to the crown (1377) Chaucer was confirmed in his\r\noffices and pensions, and shortly afterward (1378) he was sent to Italy\r\non one of his several diplomatic missions. More pecuniary blessings\r\nfollowed; then ensued a period of depression, due probably to the\r\ndeparture to Spain (1387) of his patron John of Gaunt; but his life\r\nclosed with a revival of his prosperity. He was the first poet to be\r\nburied in what is now known as Poets’ Corner in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\n=2. His Poems.= The order of Chaucer’s poems cannot be ascertained\r\nwith certitude, but from internal evidence they can as a rule be\r\napproximately dated.\r\n\r\nIt is now customary to divide the Chaucerian poems into three stages:\r\nthe French, the Italian, and the English, of which the last is a\r\ndevelopment of the first two.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The poems of the earliest or French group are closely modeled\r\nupon French originals, and the style is clumsy and immature. Of such\r\npoems the longest is _The Romaunt of the Rose_, a lengthy allegorical\r\npoem, written in octosyllabic couplets, and based upon Jean de Meung’s\r\n_Le Roman de la Rose_. This poem, which, though it extends to eight\r\nthousand lines, is only a fragment, was once entirely ascribed to\r\nChaucer, but recent research, based upon a scrutiny of Chaucerian\r\nstyle, has decided that only the first part, amounting to seventeen\r\nhundred lines, is his work. Other poems of this period include _The\r\nDethe of the Duchesse_, probably his earliest, and dated 1369, the date\r\nof the Duchess’s death, _The Compleynte unto Pité_, _Chaucer’s ABC_,\r\n_The Compleynte of Mars_, _The Compleynte of Faire Anelida_, and _The\r\nParlement of Foules_. Of these the last is the longest; it has a fine\r\nopening, but, as so often happens at this time, the work diffuses into\r\nlong speeches and descriptions.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The second or Italian stage shows a decided advance upon the\r\nfirst. In the handling of the meters the technical ability is greater,\r\nand there is a growing keenness of perception and a greater stretch\r\nof originality. _Troilus and Cressida_ is a long poem adapted from\r\nBoccaccio. By far the greater part of the poem is original, and the\r\nrhyme royal stanzas, of much dexterity and beauty, abound in excellent\r\nlines that often suggest the sonnets of Shakespeare. The poem suffers\r\nfrom the prevailing diffuseness; but the pathos of the story is touched\r\nupon with a passionate intensity.\r\n\r\n    “If no love is, O God, what fele I so?\r\n    And if love is, what thing and which is he?\r\n    If love be good, from whennes com’th my wo?\r\n    If it be wikke, a wonder thinketh me\r\n    When every torment and adversite\r\n    That com’th of him may to me savory thinke;\r\n    For ay thurste I the more that ich it drinke.\r\n\r\n    “And if that in myn owne lust I brenne,\r\n    From whennes com’th my wailing and my pleynte?\r\n    If harm agree me, wher-to pleyne I thenne?\r\n    I n’ot, ne why unwery that I fainte.\r\n    O quike deth! O swete harm so queynte!\r\n    How may of thee in me swich quantite,\r\n    But if I consente that it be?”\r\n\r\n_The Hous of Fame_, a shorter poem in octosyllabic couplets, is of\r\nthe dream-allegory type, as most of Chaucer’s poems of this period\r\nare; and it is of special importance because it shows gleams of the\r\ngenuine Chaucerian humor. In this group is also included _The Legende\r\nof Good Women_, in which Chaucer, starting with the intention of\r\ntelling nineteen affecting tales of virtuous women of antiquity,\r\nfinishes with eight accomplished and the ninth only begun. After a\r\ncharming introduction on the daisy, there is some masterly narrative,\r\nparticularly in the portion dealing with Cleopatra. The meter is the\r\nheroic couplet, with which Chaucer was to familiarize us in _The\r\nCanterbury Tales_.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The third or English group contains work of the greatest\r\nindividual accomplishment. The achievement of this period is _The\r\nCanterbury Tales_, though one or two of the separate tales may be of\r\nslightly earlier composition. For the general idea of the tales Chaucer\r\nmay be indebted to Boccaccio, but in nearly every important feature\r\nthe work is essentially English. For the purposes of his poem Chaucer\r\ndraws together twenty-nine pilgrims, including himself. They meet at\r\nthe Tabard Inn, in Southwark, in order to go on a pilgrimage to the\r\ntomb of Thomas à Becket at Canterbury. The twenty-nine are carefully\r\nchosen types, of both sexes, and of all ranks, from a knight to a\r\nhumble plowman; their occupations and personal peculiarities are many\r\nand diverse; and, as they are depicted in the masterly _Prologue_ to\r\nthe main work, they are interesting, alive, and thoroughly human. At\r\nthe suggestion of the host of the Tabard, and to relieve the tedium of\r\nthe journey, each of the pilgrims is to tell two tales on the outward\r\njourney, and two on the return. In its entirety the scheme would have\r\nresulted in an immense collection of over a hundred tales. But as it\r\nhappens Chaucer finished only twenty, and left four partly complete.\r\nThe separate tales are linked with their individual prologues, and with\r\ndialogues and scraps of narrative. Even in its incomplete state the\r\nwork is a small literature in itself, an almost unmeasured abundance\r\nand variety of humor and pathos, of narrative and description, and of\r\ndialogue and digression. There are two prose tales, Chaucer’s own _Tale\r\nof Melibœus_ and _The Parson’s Tale_; and nearly all the others are\r\ncomposed in a powerful and versatile species of the heroic couplet.\r\n\r\nTo this last stage of Chaucer’s work several short poems are ascribed,\r\nincluding _The Lack of Stedfastness_ and the serio-comic _Compleynte of\r\nChaucer to his Purse_.\r\n\r\nThere is also mention of a few short early poems, such as _Origines\r\nupon the Maudeleyne_, which have been lost.\r\n\r\nDuring his lifetime Chaucer built up such a reputation as a poet that\r\nmany works were at a later date ascribed to him without sufficient\r\nevidence. Of this group the best examples are _The Flower and the\r\nLeaf_, quite an excellent example of the dream-allegory type, and _The\r\nCourt of Love_. It has now been settled that these poems are not truly\r\nhis.\r\n\r\n=3. His Prose.= The two prose tales cannot be regarded as among\r\nChaucer’s successful efforts. Both of them--that is, _The Tale of\r\nMelibœus_ and _The Parson’s Tale on Penitence_--are lifeless in style\r\nand full of tedious moralizings. Compared with earlier prose works\r\nthey nevertheless mark an advance. They have a stronger grasp of\r\nsentence-construction, and in vocabulary they are copious and accurate.\r\nThe other prose works of Chaucer are an early translation of Boëthius,\r\nand a treatise, composed for the instruction of his little son Lewis,\r\non the astrolabe, then a popular astronomical instrument.\r\n\r\nThe following extract is a fair example of his prose:\r\n\r\n   “Now, sirs,” saith dame Prudence, “sith ye vouche saufe to be\r\n   gouerned by my counceyll, I will enforme yow how ye shal gouerne\r\n   yow in chesing of your counceyll. First tofore alle workes\r\n   ye shall beseche the hyghe God, that he be your counceyll;\r\n   and shape yow to suche entente that he yeue you counceyll and\r\n   comforte as Thobye taught his sone. ‘At alle tymes thou shall\r\n   plese and praye him to dresse thy weyes; and loke that alle thy\r\n   counceylls be in hym for euermore.’ Saynt James eke saith: ‘Yf\r\n   ony of yow haue nede of sapience, axe it of God.’ And after\r\n   that than shall ye take counceyll in yourself, and examyne well\r\n   your thoughtys of suche thynges as ye thynke that ben beste\r\n   for your profyt. And than shall ye dryue away from your hertes\r\n   the thynges that ben contraryous to good counceyl: this is to\r\n   saye--ire, couetyse, and hastynes.”\r\n                                            _The Tale of Melibœus_\r\n\r\n\r\n=4. Features of his Poetry.= (_a_) The first thing that strikes the eye\r\nis the _unique position_ that Chaucer’s work occupies in the literature\r\nof the age. He is first, with no competitor for hundreds of years to\r\nchallenge his position. He is, moreover, the forerunner in the race of\r\ngreat literary figures that henceforth, in fairly regular succession,\r\ndominate the ages they live in.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _His Observation._ Among Chaucer’s literary virtues his acute\r\nfaculty of observation is very prominent. He was a man of the world,\r\nmixing freely with all types of mankind; and he used his opportunities\r\nto observe the little peculiarities of human nature. He had the seeing\r\neye, the retentive memory, the judgment to select, and the capacity to\r\nexpound; hence the brilliance of his descriptions, which we shall note\r\nin the next paragraph.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _His Descriptions._ Success in descriptive passages depends on\r\nvivacity and skill in presentation, as well as on the judgment shown in\r\nthe selection of details. Chaucer’s best descriptions, of men, manners,\r\nand places, are of the first rank in their beauty, impressiveness, and\r\nhumor. Even when he follows the common example of the time, as when\r\ngiving details of conventional spring mornings and flowery gardens, he\r\nhas a vivacity that makes his poetry unique. Many poets before him had\r\ndescribed the break of day, but never with the real inspiration that\r\nappears in the following lines:\r\n\r\n    The bisy larke, messager of day,\r\n    Salueth in her song the morwe gay,\r\n    And firy Phœbus riseth up so brighte\r\n    That all the orient laugheth with the lighte.\r\n                                   _The Knight’s Tale_\r\n\r\nThe _Prologue_ contains ample material to illustrate Chaucer’s power\r\nin describing his fellow-men. We shall add an extract to show him\r\nin another vein. Observe the selection of detail, the terseness and\r\nadequacy of epithet, and the masterly handling of the couplet.\r\n\r\n    First on the wal was peynted a forest,\r\n    In which ther dwelleth neither man nor best,\r\n    With knotty, knarry, barreyne trees olde\r\n    Of stubbes sharpe and hidouse to biholde,\r\n    In which ther ran a rumbel and a swough,\r\n    As though a storm sholde bresten every bough;\r\n    And dounward from an hille, under a bente,\r\n    Ther stood the temple of Mars armypotente,\r\n    Wroght al of burned steel, of which the entree\r\n    Was long and streit, and gastly for to see.\r\n    The northern light in at the dores shoon,\r\n    For wyndowe on the wal ne was ther noon\r\n    Thurgh which men myghten any light discern,\r\n    The dores were al of adament eterne,\r\n    Y-clenched overthwart and endelong\r\n    With iren tough, and for to make it strong,\r\n    Every pyler, the temple to sustene,\r\n    Was tonne greet, of iren bright and shene.\r\n                                 _The Knight’s Tale_\r\n\r\n(_d_) _His Humor and Pathos._ In the literature of his time, when so\r\nfew poets seem to have any perception of the fun in life, the humor of\r\nChaucer is invigorating and delightful. The humor, which steeps nearly\r\nall his poetry, has great variety: kindly and patronizing, as in the\r\ncase of the Clerk of Oxenford; broad and semi-farcical, as in the Wife\r\nof Bath; pointedly satirical, as in the Pardoner and the Summoner;\r\nor coarse, as happens in the tales of the Miller, the Reeve, and the\r\nPardoner. It is seldom that the satirical intent is wholly lacking,\r\nas it is in the case of the Good Parson, but, except in rare cases,\r\nthe satire is good-humored and well-meant. The prevailing feature\r\nof Chaucer’s humor is its urbanity: the man of the world’s kindly\r\ntolerance of the weaknesses of his erring fellow-mortals.\r\n\r\nChaucer lays less emphasis on pathos, but it is not overlooked. In\r\nthe poetry of Chaucer the sentiment is humane and unforced. We have\r\nexcellent examples of pathos in the tale of the Prioress and in _The\r\nLegende of Good Women_.\r\n\r\nWe give a short extract from the long conversation between Chaucer and\r\nthe eagle (“with fethres all of gold”) which carried him off to the\r\nHouse of Fame. The bird, with its cool acceptance of things, is an\r\nappropriate symbol of Chaucer himself in his attitude toward the world.\r\n\r\n    Thus I longe in his clawes lay,\r\n    Til at the laste he to me spak\r\n    In mannes vois, and seyde, “Awak!\r\n    And be not so agast, for shame!”\r\n    And called me tho by my name.\r\n    And, for I sholde the bet abreyde--\r\n    Me mette--“Awak,” to me he seyde,\r\n    Right in the same vois and stevene\r\n    That useth oon I coude nevene;\r\n    And with that vois, soth for to sayn,\r\n    My minde cam to me agayn;\r\n    For hit was goodly seyd to me,\r\n    So nas hit never wont to be....\r\n    And sayde twyes “Seynte Marie!\r\n    Thou art noyous for to carie.”...\r\n    “O god,” thoughte I, “that madest kinde,\r\n    Shal I non other weyes dye?\r\n    Wher Ioves wol me stellifye,\r\n    Or what thing may this signifye?\r\n    I neither am Enok, nor Elye,\r\n    Ne Romulus, ne Ganymede\r\n    That was y-bore up, as men rede,\r\n    To hevene with dan Iupiter,\r\n    And maad the goddes boteler.”\r\n\r\n(_e_) _His Narrative Power._ As a story-teller Chaucer employs somewhat\r\ntortuous methods, but his narrative possesses a curious stealthy speed.\r\nHis stories, viewed strictly as stories, have most of the weaknesses of\r\nhis generation: a fondness for long speeches, for pedantic digressions\r\non such subjects as dreams and ethical problems, and for long\r\nexplanations when none are necessary. _Troilus and Cressida_, heavy\r\nwith long speeches, is an example of his prolixity, and _The Knight’s\r\nTale_, of baffling complexity and overabundant in detail, reveals\r\nhis haphazard and dawdling methods; yet both contain many admirable\r\nnarrative passages. But when he rises above the weaknesses common to\r\nthe time he is terse, direct, and vivacious. The extract given below\r\nwill illustrate the briskness with which his story can move.\r\n\r\n    This sely widwe, and eek hir doghtres two,\r\n    Herden thise hennes crie and maken wo,\r\n    And out at dores stirten they anon,\r\n    And syen the fox toward the grove gon,\r\n    And bar upon his bak the cok away,\r\n    And cryden, “Out! Harrow! And weylaway!\r\n    Ha! Ha! The Fox!” And after hym they ran,\r\n    And eek with staves many another man;\r\n    Ran Colle, oure dogge, and Talbot, and Gerland\r\n    And Malkyn, with a dystaf in hir hand;\r\n    Ran cow and calf, and eek the verray hogges,\r\n    So were they fered for berkynge of the dogges,\r\n    And shoutyng of the men and wommen eek;\r\n    They ronne so hem thoughte hir herte breek.\r\n    They yolleden, as feendes doon in helle;\r\n    The dokes cryden, as men wolde hem quelle;\r\n    The gees, for feere, flowen over the trees;\r\n    Out of the hyve cam the swarm of bees;\r\n    So hidous was the noys, _a benedicitee_!\r\n    Certes, he Jakke Straw, and his meynee,\r\n    Ne made never shoutes half so shrille,\r\n    Whan that they wolden any Flemyng kille,\r\n    As thilke day was maade upon the fox.\r\n                         _The Nun’s Priest’s Tale_\r\n\r\n(_f_) _His Metrical Skill._ In the matter of poetical technique English\r\nliterature owes much to Chaucer. He is not an innovator, for he employs\r\nthe meters in common use. In his hands, however, they take on new\r\npowers. The octosyllabic and heroic couplets, which previously were\r\nslack and inartistic measures, now acquire a new strength, suppleness,\r\nand melody. Chaucer, who is no great lyrical poet, takes little\r\ninterest in the more complicated meters common in the lyric; but in\r\nsome of his shorter poems he shows a skill that is as good as the very\r\nbest apparent in the contemporary poems.\r\n\r\n(_g_) _Summary._ We may summarize Chaucer’s achievement by saying that\r\nhe is the earliest of the great moderns. In comparison with the poets\r\nof his own time, and with those of the succeeding century, the advance\r\nhe makes is almost startling. For example, Manning, Hampole, and the\r\nromancers are of another age and of another way of thinking from ours;\r\nbut, apart from the superficial archaisms of spelling, the modern\r\nreader finds in Chaucer something closely akin. All the Chaucerian\r\nfeatures help to create this modern atmosphere: the shrewd and placidly\r\nhumorous observation, the wide humanity, the quick aptness of phrase,\r\nthe dexterous touch upon the meter, and, above all, the fresh and\r\nformative _spirit_--the genius turning dross into gold. Chaucer is\r\nindeed a genius; he stands alone, and for nearly two hundred years none\r\ndare claim equality with him.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER POETS\r\n\r\n=1. William Langland=, or =Langley (1332–1400)=, is one of the early\r\nwriters with whom modern research has dealt adversely. All we know\r\nabout him appears on the manuscripts of his poem, or is based upon the\r\nremarks he makes regarding himself in the course of the poem. This\r\npoem, the full title of which is _The Vision of William concerning\r\nPiers the Plowman_, appears in its many manuscripts in three forms,\r\ncalled respectively the A, B, and C texts. The A text is the shortest,\r\nbeing about 2500 lines long; the B is more than 7200 lines; and the\r\nC, which is clearly based upon B, is more than 7300 lines. Until\r\nquite recently it has always been assumed that the three forms were\r\nall the work of Langland; but the latest theory is that the A form is\r\nthe genuine composition of Langland, whereas both B and C have been\r\ncomposed by a later and inferior poet.\r\n\r\nFrom the personal passages in the poem it appears that the author was\r\nborn in Shropshire about 1332. The vision in which he saw Piers the\r\nPlowman probably took place in 1362.\r\n\r\nThe poem itself tells of the poet’s vision on the Malvern Hills. In\r\nthis trance he beholds a fair “feld ful of folk.” The first vision,\r\nby subtle and baffling changes, merges into a series of dissolving\r\nscenes which deal with the adventures of allegorical beings, human like\r\nDo-wel, Do-bet, and Do-betst, or of abstract significance like the Lady\r\nMeed, Wit, Study, and Faith. During the many incidents of the poem the\r\nvirtuous powers generally suffer most, till the advent of Piers the\r\nPlowman--the Messianic deliverer--restores the balance to the right\r\nside. The underlying motive of the work is to expose the sloth and\r\nvice of the Church, and to set on record the struggles and virtues of\r\ncommon folks. Langland’s frequent sketches of homely life are done with\r\nsympathy and knowledge, and often suggest the best scenes of Bunyan.\r\n\r\nThe style has a somber energy, an intense but crabbed seriousness,\r\nand an austere simplicity of treatment. The form of the poem is\r\ncurious. It is a revival of the Old English rhymeless measure, having\r\nalliteration as the basis of the line. The lines themselves are fairly\r\nuniform in length, and there is the middle pause, with (as a rule) two\r\nalliterations in the first half-line and one in the second. Yet in\r\nspite of the Old English meter the vocabulary draws freely upon the\r\nFrench, to an extent equal to that of Chaucer himself.\r\n\r\nWe quote the familiar opening lines of the poem. The reader should note\r\nthe strong rhythm of the lines--which in some cases almost amounts to\r\nactual meter--the fairly regular system of alliteration, and the sober\r\nundertone of resignation.\r\n\r\n    In a somer sesun, whan softe was the sonne,\r\n    I shope me into a shroud, a sheep as I were;\r\n    In habite of an hermite, unholy of werkes,\r\n    Wende I wyde in this world, wondres to here.\r\n    But in a Mayes morwnynge, on Malverne hulles,\r\n    Me bifel a ferly,[26] a feyric me thouhte;\r\n    I was wery of wandringe and wente me to reste\r\n    Under a brod banke, bi a bourne syde,\r\n    And as I lay and lened, and loked on the waters,\r\n    I slumberde on a slepyng; it sownede so murie.\r\n\r\n=2. John Gower=, the date of whose birth is uncertain, died in 1408. He\r\nwas a man of means, and a member of a good Kentish family; he took a\r\nfairly active part in the politics and literary activity of the time,\r\nand was buried in London.\r\n\r\nThe three chief works of Gower are noteworthy, for they illustrate the\r\nunstable state of contemporary English literature. His first poem,\r\n_Speculum Meditantis_, is written in French, and for a long time was\r\nlost, being discovered as late as 1895; the second, _Vox Clamantis_,\r\nis composed in Latin; and the third, _Confessio Amantis_, is written\r\nin English, at the King’s command according to Gower himself. In this\r\nlast poem we have the conventional allegorical setting, with the\r\ndisquisition of the seven deadly sins, illustrated by many anecdotes.\r\nThese anecdotes reveal Gower’s capacity as a story-teller. He has a\r\ndiffuse and watery style of narrative, but occasionally he is brisk and\r\ncompetent. The meter is the octosyllabic couplet, of great smoothness\r\nand fluency.\r\n\r\n=3. John Barbour (1316–95)= is the first of the Scottish poets to\r\nclaim our attention. He was born in Aberdeenshire, and studied both\r\nat Oxford and Paris. His great work is _The Brus_ (1375), a lengthy\r\npoem of twenty books and thirteen thousand lines. The work is really\r\na history of Scotland from the death of Alexander III (1286) till the\r\ndeath of Bruce and the burial of his heart (1332). The heroic theme is\r\nthe rise of Bruce, and the central incident of the poem is the battle\r\nof Bannockburn. The poem, often rudely but pithily expressed, contains\r\nmuch absurd legend and a good deal of inaccuracy, but it is no mean\r\nbeginning to the long series of Scottish heroic poems. The spirited\r\nbeginning is often quoted:\r\n\r\n    A! fredome is a nobill thing!\r\n    Fredome mayss man to haiif liking!\r\n    Fredome all solace to man giffis;\r\n    He levys at ess that frely levys!\r\n    A noble hart may haiff nane ess,\r\n    Na ellys nocht that may him pless,\r\n    Gyffe fredome failzhe: for fre liking\r\n    Is zharnyt[27] our all othir thing.\r\n    Na he, that ay hass levyt fre,\r\n    May nocht knaw weill the propyrte,\r\n    The angyr, na the wrechyt dome,\r\n    That is couplyt to foule thyrldome.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROSE-WRITERS\r\n\r\n=1. Sir John Mandeville= is the English form of the name of =Jehan\r\nde Mandeville=, who compiled and published a French book of travels\r\nbetween 1357 and 1371. This French work was very popular, and it was\r\ntranslated into several languages, including English. The English\r\nversion has a preface, in which it is stated that the author was\r\na Sir John Mandeville, a knight, born at St. Albans, who crossed\r\nthe sea in 1322 and traveled in many strange regions. Much of the\r\npersonal narrative is invention; nowadays the very existence of Sir\r\nJohn is denied. The real author of the book is said to be =Jehan de\r\nBourgogne=, who died at Liège in 1372.\r\n\r\nIt has now been demonstrated that the so-called “_Travels_” is\r\na compilation from several popular books of voyages, including those\r\nof a Friar Odoric, of an Armenian called Hetoum, and (to a very small\r\nextent) of the famous traveler Marco Polo. These, with a few grains of\r\noriginal matter, are ingeniously welded into one of the most charming\r\nbooks of its kind. The travels are full of incredible descriptions and\r\nanecdotes, which are set down with delightful faith and eagerness. The\r\nstyle is sweet and clear, with some colloquial touches; and the short\r\nnarrations freely dispersed through the text, tersely phrased and\r\naccurately gauged in length, are rendered with great skill.\r\n\r\nWe add an example to illustrate this admirable prose style. Observe\r\nthe brief sentences, many of which begin with “and,” the simple but\r\neffective diction, and the straightforward style of narrative.\r\n\r\n   And zee schull undirstonde that whan men comen to Jerusalem her\r\n   first pilgrymage is to the chirche of the Holy Sepulcr wher\r\n   oure Lord was buryed, that is withoute the cytee on the north\r\n   syde. But it is now enclosed in with the ton wall. And there is\r\n   a full fair chirche all rownd, and open above, and covered with\r\n   leed. And on the west syde is a fair tour and an high for belles\r\n   strongly made. And in the myddes of the chirche is a tabernacle\r\n   as it wer a lytyll hows, made with a low lityll dore; and that\r\n   tabernacle is made in maner of a half a compas right curiousely\r\n   and richely made of gold and azure and othere riche coloures,\r\n   full nobelyche made. And in the ryght side of that tabernacle\r\n   is the sepulcre of oure Lord. And the tabernacle is viij fote\r\n   long and v fote wide, and xj fote in heghte. And it is not longe\r\n   sithe the sepulcre was all open, that men myghte kisse it and\r\n   touche it. But for pilgrymes that comen thider peyned hem to\r\n   breke the ston in peces, or in poudr; therefore the Soudan[28]\r\n   hath do make a wall aboute the sepulcr that no man may towche\r\n   it. But in the left syde of the wall of the tabernacle is well\r\n   the heighte of a man, is a gret ston, to the quantytee of a\r\n   mannes bed, that was of the holy sepuler, and that ston kissen\r\n   the pilgrymes that comen thider. In that tabernacle ben no\r\n   wyndowes, but it is all made light with lampes that hangen befor\r\n   the sepulcr.\r\n\r\n=2. John Wyclif=, or =Wycliffe (1320–84)=, was born in Yorkshire about\r\nthe year 1320. He was educated at Oxford, took holy orders, received\r\nthe living of Lutteworth in Leicestershire (1374), and took a prominent\r\npart in the ecclesiastical feuds of the day. He was strong in his\r\ndenunciation of the abuses then rampant, and only the influence of\r\nhis powerful friends saved him from the fate of a heretic. He died\r\npeacefully in 1384.\r\n\r\nAn active controversialist, he wrote many Latin books in support of his\r\nrevolutionary opinions. In addition, he issued a large number of tracts\r\nand pamphlets in English, and carried through an English translation of\r\nthe Bible. His English style is not polished, but it is vigorous and\r\npointed, with a homely simplicity that makes its appeal both wide and\r\npowerful.\r\n\r\n=3. Sir Thomas Malory= may be included at this point, though his famous\r\nwork, the _Morte d’Arthur_, was composed as late as the “ix yere of\r\nthe reygne of Kyng Edward the furth” (1469). Nearly all we know about\r\nMalory is contained in the preface of Caxton, the first printer of the\r\nbook. Caxton says that the book was written by Sir Thomas Malory “oute\r\nof certeyn bookes of frensshe.”\r\n\r\nLike the travels of Mandeville, the _Morte d’Arthur_ is a compilation.\r\nIn the case of Malory’s books, French Arthurian romances are drawn\r\nupon to create a prose romance of great length and detail. However\r\ndiverse the sources are, the book is written with a uniform dignity and\r\nfervor that express the very soul and essence of romance. The prose\r\nstyle, never pretentious, is always equal to the demands put upon it,\r\nand frequently it has that flash of phrase that is essential to the\r\ncreation of a literary style. Malory is, in short, our first individual\r\nprose stylist.\r\n\r\n   And on the morn the damsel and he took their leave and thanked\r\n   the knight, and so departed, and rode on their way until they\r\n   came to a great forest. And there was a great river and but one\r\n   passage, and there were ready two knights on the further side\r\n   to let them the passage. “What sayest thou,” said the damsel,\r\n   “wilt thou match yonder knights, or turn again?” “Nay,” said\r\n   Sir Beaumains, “I will not turn again and they were six more.”\r\n   And therewithal he rushed into the water, and in the midst of\r\n   the water, either brake their spears upon other to their hands,\r\n   and then they drew their swords and smote eagerly at other. And\r\n   at the last Sir Beaumains smote the other upon the helm that\r\n   his head stonied, and therewithal he fell down in the water,\r\n   and there was he drowned. And then he spurred his horse upon\r\n   the land, where the other knight fell upon him and brake his\r\n   spear, and so they drew their swords and fought long together.\r\n   At the last Sir Beaumains clave his helm and his head down to\r\n   the shoulders: and so he rode unto the damsel, and bade her ride\r\n   forth on her way.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF LITERARY FORMS\r\n\r\nThe Chaucerian age saw a great and significant advance in poetical\r\nforms of literature, and a noteworthy one in the domain of prose.\r\n\r\n=1. Poetry.= With regard to poetry, we can observe the various forms\r\nseparating themselves and straightening out into form and coherence.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The _lyric_, chiefly the religious and love-lyric, continues\r\nto be written and developed. Chaucer himself contributes very little\r\ntoward it, but a number of anonymous bards add to the common stock.\r\nIt is seldom that we can give precise dates to the lyrics of this\r\nperiod; but about this time were composed such exquisite pieces as _The\r\nNut-brown Maid_, a curious hybrid between the lyric and the ballad, and\r\nthe lovely carols of the Church.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The Rise of the Ballad._ The origin of the ballad has always\r\nbeen a question in dispute. There is little doubt, however, that\r\nballads began to assume a position of importance at the end of the\r\nfourteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe true ballad-form had several features to make it distinct from the\r\nromance: it is commonly plebeian in origin and theme, thus contrasting\r\nwith the romance, which is aristocratic in these respects; it is short,\r\nand treats of one incident, whereas the romance form is cumulative,\r\nand can absorb any number of adventures; it is simple in style, and is\r\nas a rule composed in the familiar ballad-stanza. Some of the fine\r\nballads belonging to this time are _Chevy Chace_, _Gil Morrice_, and\r\n_Sir Patrick Spens_. Very old ballads, as can be seen in the case of\r\n_Chevy Chace_, which exists in more than one version, have descended\r\nto modern times in a much more polished condition than they were in at\r\nfirst. In their earliest condition they were rude and almost illiterate\r\nproductions, the compositions of the popular minstrels.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _The Rise of the Allegory._ This is perhaps the suitable place to\r\nnote the rise of allegory, which in the age of Chaucer began to affect\r\nall the branches of poetry. Even at its best the allegorical method\r\nis crude and artificial, but it is a concrete and effective literary\r\ndevice for expounding moral and religious lessons. It appeals with the\r\ngreatest force to minds which are still unused to abstract thinking;\r\nand about the period now under discussion it exactly suited the lay and\r\necclesiastical mind. Hence we have a flood of poems dealing with Courts\r\nof Love, Houses of Fame, Dances of the Seven Deadly Sins, and other\r\nsymbolical subjects. Especially in the earlier stages of his career,\r\nChaucer himself did not escape the prevailing habit. We shall see that\r\nthe craze for the allegory was to increase during the next century and\r\nlater, till it reached its climax in _The Faerie Queene_.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Descriptive and Narrative Poems._ In this form of poetry _The\r\nCanterbury Tales_ is the outstanding example, but in many passages of\r\nLangland and Gower we have specimens of the same class. We have already\r\nmentioned some of the weaknesses that are common to the narrative\r\npoetry of the day, and which were due partly to lack of practice and\r\npartly to reliance upon inferior models: the tantalizing rigmaroles of\r\nlong speeches and irrelevant episodes, the habit of dragging into the\r\nstory scientific and religious discussions, and an imperfect sense of\r\nproportion in the arrangement of the plot. In the best examples, such\r\nas those of Chaucer, there is powerful grip upon the central interest,\r\na shrewd observation and humor, and quite often a brilliant rapidity of\r\nnarration.\r\n\r\n(_e_) The _metrical romance_ is still a popular form, but the great\r\nvogue of the last century is on the wane. Among the lower classes it\r\nis being supplanted by the ballad; and the growing favor that is being\r\nshown to the _fabliau_--that is, the short French tale, realistic in\r\nsubject and humorous-satirical in style--is leading to tales of the\r\ncoarser Chaucer type.\r\n\r\n=2. Prose.= In prose we have the first English travel-book in\r\nMandeville’s _Travels_; one of the earliest translations of the Bible\r\nin Wyclif’s; and, among others, a prose chronicle in the work of\r\n=John of Trevisa (1326–1412)=, who issued a prose version of Higden’s\r\n_Polychronicon_. As yet such works are in an undeveloped state, but\r\nalready some considerable growth is apparent. Prose is increasing both\r\nin quantity and in quality, and the rate of increase is accelerating.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF LITERARY STYLE\r\n\r\n=1. Poetry.= We have already stated that the time of transition\r\nand experiment is nearly over. English poetical style has established\r\nitself, and the main lines of development have been laid down. For this\r\nwe are indebted almost entirely to Chaucer.\r\n\r\n(_a_) With regard to _meter_, it is curious to observe that with\r\nincreasing practice the tendency is toward simplicity. The extremely\r\ncomplicated stanzas are becoming less common, and rhyme royal and\r\nother shorter verses are coming into favor. Along with simplification\r\nis a greater suppleness and dexterity. There is less rigidity in the\r\nposition of the pause, and a greater freedom in the substitution of\r\nthree-syllabled feet for two-syllabled feet. These features are most\r\nstrongly developed in the couplet forms. It is this union of simplicity\r\nand freedom that is to remain the dominating characteristic of English\r\nverse, thus contrasting with the quantitative system of the classical\r\nmeasures and the syllabic nature of the French.\r\n\r\n(_b_) There is an interesting _revival in alliteration_. In the true\r\nalliterative poem the basis of the line is a system of repeating\r\nsounds, such as was the custom in Old English verse. One of the\r\nearliest examples of this type which occurs after the Norman Conquest\r\nis _Wynnere and Wastour_ (1352), an anonymous poem of no great merit.\r\nThe tradition is continued in the alliterative romances of the type\r\nof _Cleannesse_; and it attains its climax in _Piers Plowman_. Though\r\nthis last poem gained a great popularity it left no important literary\r\ndescendants. Hence the revival of the ancient system of alliteration\r\nremains as an interesting curiosity. In a very short time after\r\nLangland, alliteration becomes simply an ornament to meter--sometimes a\r\ndevice of great beauty, but not vital to the metrical scheme.\r\n\r\nAs regards the actual _poetic diction_ of the period, there is a\r\nconsiderable liking shown for ornate French and classical terms. This\r\ncan be observed in the earlier poems of Chaucer and in the _Confessio\r\nAmantis_ of Gower. We have not yet attained to the aureate diction\r\nof the succeeding generation, but the temptation to use French terms\r\nwas too strong to be resisted. Langland, though he draws upon the\r\nFrench Element, writes with much greater simplicity; and the ballads\r\nalso are composed in a manner quite plain and unadorned.\r\n\r\n=2. Prose.= The state of prose is still too immature to allow of\r\nany style beyond the plainest. Wyclif’s, the earliest of the period,\r\nis unpolished, though it can be pointed and vigorous. Mandeville’s\r\nprose style, though it is devoid of artifices, attains to a certain\r\ndistinction by reason of its straightforward methods, its short and\r\nworkmanlike sentences, and a brevity rare in his day. In the case\r\nof Malory, who comes some time after the others, we have quite an\r\nindividual style. It is still unadorned; but it has a distinction of\r\nphrase and a decided romantic flavor that make Malory a prose stylist\r\nof a high class. His prose is, indeed, a distinct advance upon that of\r\nhis predecessors.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               EXERCISES\r\n\r\n1. The following series of extracts is intended to show the development\r\nof English prose style from Old English times to those of Malory.\r\nThe student should write a brief commentary upon the development of\r\nthe prose, paying attention to vocabulary, sentence-construction,\r\nclearness, and brevity.\r\n\r\n    (1) Ða ic ða ðis eall gemunde,  When I recollected all this, I\r\n    ða wundrade ic swiðe            wondered very much that of all\r\n    swiðe ðara godena wiotona ðe    the scholars that long were\r\n    giu wæron giond Angelcynn,      throughout England and had\r\n    ond ða bec ealla be fullan      learnt all the books in full,\r\n      geliornod\r\n    hæfdon, ðæt hie hiora           none at all wished to turn them\r\n    ða nænne dæl noldon on hiera    into their own tongue.

He followed nature\r\n   everywhere.... The verse of Chaucer is not harmonious to us....\r\n   There is the rudeness of a Scotch tune in it.[44]\r\n                                                             DRYDEN\r\n\r\n   (3) He was a healthy and hearty man, so humane that he loved\r\n   even the foibles of his kind.... He was a truly epic poet,\r\n   without knowing it....

Point out some of the traces that the social and religious unrest\r\nhas left upon the literature of the time.\r\n\r\n7. “There exists a general impression that our prose dates from the\r\nsixteenth century.” (Earle.) Is this impression a correct one?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                        FROM CHAUCER TO SPENSER\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND (1450–1550)\r\n\r\nThe dates that appear at the head of this section are only approximate,\r\nbut the general features of the time are well defined. In England\r\nthe period begins with wars, unrest, and almost chaos; it concludes\r\nwith a settled dynasty, a reformed religion, and a people united and\r\nprogressive. Abroad, as well as in England, there is apparent the\r\nbroad intellectual flood known as the Renaissance, running deep and\r\nstrong: the renewed desire for knowledge, changes in religious ideals,\r\nthe discovery of new worlds, both geographical and literary, and the\r\nenormous quickening of heart and mind. In England the scene is being\r\nprepared for the great age to follow.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY FEATURES OF THE AGE\r\n\r\n=1. Poverty of Material.= Considering the length of the period, the\r\npoverty of the output is hard to explain. There is no English poet of\r\nany consequence; the prose writing is thin in quality and quantity; and\r\nif it were not for the activities of the Scottish poets the age would\r\nbe poor indeed.\r\n\r\n=2. Scottish Poetry.= Scottish poetry comes late into notice, but it\r\ncomes with a bound. The poverty and disunion of Scotland, its severance\r\nfrom the intellectual stimulus of English thought, and the dearth of\r\neducational facilities all combine to retard its literary development.\r\nBut these disadvantages are rapidly passing away, with the beneficial\r\nresults apparent in this chapter.\r\n\r\n=3. The Development of the Drama.= The popularity of the romance is\r\nalmost gone; the drama, more suited to the growing intelligence of the\r\ntime, is rapidly taking on a new importance. The professional actor and\r\nthe playwright, owing to real demand for their services, are making\r\ntheir appearance. The development of the drama is sketched in this\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n=4. The Importance of the Period.= The importance of the time is belied\r\nby its apparent barrenness. In reality it is a season of healthy\r\nfallow, of germination, of rest and recuperation. The literary impulse,\r\nslowly awakening, is waiting for the right moment. When that movement\r\ncomes the long period of rest gives the new movement swift and enduring\r\nforce.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOETRY\r\n\r\n=1. The Scottish Poets.= (_a_) =James I (1394–1437)= was captured by\r\nthe English in 1405, and remained in England till 1424, when he married\r\nJoan Beaufort, the cousin of Henry V, and returned to Scotland. The\r\nchief poem associated with his name is _The Kingis Quhair_ (_quire_\r\nor _book_). The attempts to disprove his authorship have not been\r\nsuccessful. It seems to have been written during his captivity, and it\r\nrecords his first sight of the lady destined to be his wife. It follows\r\nthe Chaucerian model of the dream, the garden, and the introduction\r\nof allegorical figures. The stanza is the rhyme royal, which is said\r\nto have derived its name from his use of it. The diction, which is\r\nthe common artificial blend of Scottish and Chaucerian forms, is\r\nhighly ornamented; but there are some passages of really brilliant\r\ndescription, and a few stanzas of passionate declamation quite equal\r\nto the best of Chaucer’s _Troilus and Cressida_. It is certainly among\r\nthe best of the poems that appear between the periods of Chaucer and\r\nSpenser. Other poems, in particular the more plebeian _Peblis to the\r\nPlay_ and _Christis Kirk on the Green_, have been ascribed to James,\r\nbut his authorship is extremely doubtful.\r\n\r\nThe two following stanzas are fair examples of James’s poetry. The man\r\nwho wrote them was no mean poet.\r\n\r\n    Of her array the form if I shall write,\r\n    Towards her golden hair and rich attire,\r\n    In fretwise couchit[45] with pearlis white,\r\n    And great balas[46] leaming[47] as the fire,\r\n    With mony ane emeraut and fair sapphire;\r\n    And on her head a chaplet fresh of hue,\r\n    Of Plumis parted red, and white, and blue.\r\n\r\n    Full of quaking spangis bright as gold,\r\n    Forged of shape like to the amorets,\r\n    So new, so fresh, so pleasant to behold,\r\n    The plumis eke like to the flower jonets,[48]\r\n    And other of shape, like to the flower jonets;\r\n    And above all this, there was, well I wot,\r\n    Beauty enough to make a world to dote.\r\n                                     _The Kingis Quhair_\r\n\r\n(_b_) =Sir David Lyndsay (1490–1555)= was born in Fifeshire about the\r\nyear 1490. He entered the royal service, and rose to fill the important\r\nposition of Lyon King-of-Arms.\r\n\r\nHis longer works, which were written during his service at Court,\r\ninclude _The Dreme_, in rhyme royal stanzas, with the usual allegorical\r\nsetting; _The Testament of Squyer Meldrum_, in octosyllabic couplets,\r\na romantic biography with a strongly Chaucerian flavor; _The\r\nTestament and Compleynt of the Papyngo_, which has some gleams of his\r\ncharacteristic humor; and _Ane Pleasant Satyre of the Thrie Estatis_, a\r\nmorality-play, coarse and vulgar, but containing much of his best work.\r\nIt is full of telling satire directed against the Church, and it shows\r\nacute observation of the frailties of his fellows. Lyndsay represents\r\nthe ruder type of the Scottish Chaucerian. He has a coarseness\r\nbeyond the standard even of his day; but he cannot be denied a bluff\r\ngood-humor, a sound honesty of opinion, and an abundant and vital\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\n(_c_) =Robert Henryson (1425–1500)= has left us few details regarding\r\nhis life. In one of his books he is described as a “scholemaister\r\nof Dunfermeling”; he may have studied at Glasgow University; and he\r\nwas dead when Dunbar (see below) wrote his _Lament for the Makaris_\r\nin 1506. Hence the dates given for his birth and death are only\r\napproximations.\r\n\r\nThe order of his poems has not been determined. His longest is a\r\nversion of the _Morall Fabillis of Esope_, composed in rhyme royal\r\nstanzas and showing much dexterity and vivacity; _The Testament of\r\nCresseid_ is a continuation of Chaucer’s _Troilus and Cressida_, and it\r\nhas a finely tragic conclusion; _Orpheus and Eurydice_, an adaptation\r\nfrom Boëthius, has, along with much commonplace moralizing, some\r\npassages of real pathos; and among his thirteen shorter poems _Robene\r\nand Makyne_, a little pastoral incident, is executed with a lightness,\r\na brevity, and a precision that make it quite a gem among its fellows.\r\nHis _Garment of Gude Ladies_, though often quoted, is pedantically\r\nallegorical, and of no high quality as poetry.\r\n\r\nWe quote two stanzas from _The Testament of Cresseid_. The diction is\r\nan artificial blend of that of Chaucer and of colloquial Scots, and it\r\nis heavily loaded with descriptive epithet; but it is picturesque and\r\ndramatic, in some respects suggesting the later work of Spenser.\r\n\r\n    His face frosnit,[49] his lyre was lyke the leid,\r\n      His teith chatterit, and cheverit[50] with the chin,\r\n    His ene[51] drowpit, how,[52] sonkin in his heid,\r\n      Out of his nois the meldrop[53] fast did rin,\r\n      With lippis bla,[54] and cheikis liene and thin,\r\n    The iceschoklis that fra his hair doun hang,\r\n    Was wonder greit, and as ane speir als lang.\r\n\r\n    Atouir[55] his belt his lyart[56] lokkis lay\r\n      Felterit[57] unfair, ovirfret with froistis hoir,\r\n    His garmound and his gyis[58] full gay of gray,\r\n      His widderit weid[59] fra him the wind out woir;\r\n      Ane busteous bow within his hand he boir,\r\n    Under his girdill ane flasche[60] of felloun flanis,[61]\r\n    Fedderit[62] with ice, and heidit with hailstanis.\r\n                                      _The Testament of Cresseid_\r\n\r\n(_d_) =William Dunbar (1460–1520)= is generally considered to be the\r\nchief of the Scottish Chaucerian poets. He was born in East Lothian,\r\nstudied at St. Andrews University (1477), and went to France and became\r\na wandering friar. Returning to Scotland, he became attached to the\r\nhousehold of James IV, and in course of time was appointed official\r\nRhymer. He died about 1520.\r\n\r\nDunbar wrote freely, often on subjects of passing interest; and though\r\nhis work runs mainly on Chaucerian lines it has an energy and pictorial\r\nquality that are quite individual. Of the more than ninety poems\r\nassociated with his name the most important are _The Golden Targe_, of\r\nthe common allegorical-rhetorical type; _The Thrissill and the Rois_,\r\ncelebrating the marriage of James IV and the English Margaret (1503);\r\n_The Dance of the Sevin Deidlie Sins_, with its strong _macabre_\r\neffects and its masterly grip of meter; _The Twa Meryit Wemen and the\r\nWedo_, a revival of the ancient alliterative measure, and outrageously\r\nfrank in expression; and _The Lament for the Makaris_, in short stanzas\r\nwith the refrain _Timor Mortis conturbat me_, quite striking in its\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nThe following short extract reveals Dunbar’s strong pictorial quality\r\nand his command of meter.\r\n\r\n    Let see quoth he now wha begins:--\r\n    With that the foul Sevin Deidlie Sins\r\n     Beyond to leap at anis[63];\r\n    And first of all in dance was Pride\r\n    With hair wyld[64] back and bonnet o’ side,\r\n     Like to make vaistie wanis.[65]\r\n    And round about him as a wheel\r\n    Hung all in rumples to the heel\r\n     His kethat[66] for the nanis.[67]\r\n    Mony proud trumpour[68] with him trippit;\r\n    Through scalding fire aye as they skippit\r\n     They girned[69] with hideous granis.[70]\r\n    Then Ire came in with sturt[71] and strife\r\n    His hand was aye upon his knife,\r\n     He brandeist like a beir.[72]\r\n                    _The Dance of the Sevin Deidlie Sins_\r\n\r\n(_e_) =Gawain Douglas (1474–1522)= was a member of the famous Douglas\r\nfamily, his father being the fifth Earl of Angus, Archibald “Bell the\r\nCat.” He studied at St. Andrews University (1489) and probably at\r\nParis, became a priest, and rose to be Bishop of Dunkeld. He took a\r\ngreat share in the high politics of those dangerous times, and in the\r\nend lost his bishopric, was expelled to England, and died in London.\r\n\r\nHis four works belong to the period 1501–13: _The Palice of Honour_, of\r\nelaborate and careful workmanship, and typical of the fifteenth-century\r\nmanner; _King Hart_, a laboriously allegorical treatment of life, the\r\nHart being the heart of life, which is attended by the five senses and\r\nother personifications of abstractions; _Conscience_, a short poem,\r\na mere quibble on the word “conscience,” of no great poetical merit;\r\nand the _Æneid_, his most considerable effort, a careful translation\r\nof Virgil, with some incongruous touches, but done with competence and\r\nsome poetical ability. It is the earliest of its kind, and so is worthy\r\nof some consideration. Douglas is the most scholarly and painstaking of\r\nhis group; but he lacks the native vigor of his fellows. His style is\r\noften overloaded and listless, and in the selection of theme he shows\r\nlittle originality.\r\n\r\n=2. John Skelton (1460–1529)= comes late in this period, but he is\r\nperhaps the most considerable of the poets. His place of birth is\r\ndisputed; he may have studied at Oxford, and he probably graduated at\r\nCambridge. He took orders (1498), entered the household of the Countess\r\nof Richmond, the mother of Henry VII, and became a tutor to Prince\r\nHenry. In 1500 he obtained the living of Diss in Norfolk, but his sharp\r\ntongue ruined him as a rector. He fell foul of Wolsey, and is said to\r\nhave escaped imprisonment by seeking sanctuary in Westminster Abbey,\r\nwhere he died in 1529.\r\n\r\nIn his _Garlande of Laurell Skelton_ gives a list of his own works,\r\nmost of which have perished. This poem itself is a dreary effort,\r\nstilted in style and diffuse in treatment. It is in satire that Skelton\r\nappears at his best. His satirical poems, in spite of their shuffling\r\nand scrambling meters, are usually sharp, often witty, and nearly\r\nalways alive. _Why come ye not to Court?_ is addressed to Wolsey, and\r\nfor jeering impertinence it is hard to find its equal, at that time\r\nat least; _The Tunnynge of Elynore Runnynge_ is realism indeed, for\r\nit faithfully portrays the drunken orgies of a pack of women in an\r\nale-house. His more serious poems include a _Dirge on Edward IV_, _The\r\nBowge of Court_, and a quite excellent morality-play, _Magnificence_.\r\n\r\nWe quote an example of Skelton’s peculiar meter, which came to be\r\ncalled “Skeltonics.” It is a species of jingling octosyllabic couplet,\r\nbut crumbling and unstable, often descending to doggerel. It is,\r\nhowever, lively, witty in a shallow fashion, and attractive. His own\r\ndescription of it is quite just:\r\n\r\n    For though my rhyme be ragged,\r\n    Tattered and jagged,\r\n    Rudely rayne beaten,\r\n    Rusty and moughte eaten,\r\n    It hath in it some pyth.\r\n\r\nThe following extract shows his powers of invective:\r\n\r\n    But this mad Amelek\r\n    Like to a Mamelek,\r\n    He regardeth lords\r\n    Not more than potshords;\r\n    He is in such elation\r\n    Of his exaltation,\r\n    And the supportation\r\n    Of our sovereign lord,\r\n    That, God to record,\r\n    He ruleth all at will.\r\n    Without reason or skill;\r\n    Howbeit the primordial\r\n    Of his wretched original,\r\n    And his base progeny,\r\n    And his greasy genealogy,\r\n    He came of the sank[73] royal\r\n    That was cast out of a butcher’s stall.\r\n                       _Why come ye not to Court?_\r\n\r\n=3. John Lydgate (1370–1451)= had a great reputation in his day, but\r\nlittle of it has survived. He was born at Lydgate, near Newmarket, and\r\nbecame a monk at Bury St. Edmunds, where he rose to be priest in 1397.\r\nHe studied and wrote much, gaining a wide reputation both as a scholar\r\nand a poet. The dates of his birth and death are only approximately\r\nfixed.\r\n\r\nLydgate was a friend of Chaucer, upon whom he models much of his\r\npoetry. But as a poet he is no Chaucer. He has none of the latter’s\r\nmetrical skill and lively imagination, and the enormous mass of his\r\npoems only enhances their futility. _The Falls of Princes_, full of\r\nplatitudes and wordy digressions, is no less than 7,000 verses long;\r\n_The Temple of Glass_, of the common allegorical type, is mercifully\r\nshorter; and so is _The Story of Thebes_, a feeble continuation of\r\nChaucer’s _Knight’s Tale_. On rare occasions, as in _London Lickpenny_,\r\nhe is livelier; but he has no ear for meter, and the common vices of\r\nhis time--prolixity, lack of humor, and pedantic allegory--lie heavy\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\n=4. Thomas Occleve=, or =Hoccleve (1368–1450)=, may have been born in\r\nBedfordshire; but we know next to nothing about him, and that he tells\r\nus himself. He was a clerk in the Privy Seal Office, from which in 1424\r\nhe retired on a pension to Hampshire.\r\n\r\nHis principal works are _The Regement of Princes_, written for the\r\nedification of Henry VIII, and consisting of a string of tedious\r\nsermons; _La Male Règle_, partly autobiographical, in a sniveling\r\nfashion; _The Complaint of Our Lady_; and _Occleve’s Complaint_.\r\n\r\nThe style of Occleve’s poetry shows the rapid degeneration that set\r\nin immediately after the death of Chaucer. His meter, usually rhyme\r\nroyal or couplets, is loose and sprawling, the style is uninspired,\r\nand the interest of the reader soon ebbs very low. He himself, in his\r\ncharacteristic whining way, admits it with much truth:\r\n\r\n    Fader Chaucer fayne wold han me taught,\r\n    But I was dul, and learned lite or nought.\r\n\r\n=5. Stephen Hawes (1474–1530)= was a Court poet during the first\r\ntwenty years of the sixteenth century. Very little is known of him,\r\neven the dates of his birth and death being largely matters of surmise.\r\n\r\nHis chief works include _The Passetyme of Pleasure_, a kind of\r\nromantic-homiletic poem, composed both in rhyme royal stanzas and\r\nin couplets, and dealing with man’s life in this world in a fashion\r\nreminiscent of Bunyan’s, _The Example of Virtue_, _The Conversion\r\nof Swerers_, and _A Joyfull Medytacyon_. Of all the poets now under\r\ndiscussion Hawes is the most uninspired; his allegorical methods are of\r\nthe crudest; but he is not entirely without his poetical moments. His\r\n_Passetyme of Pleasure_ probably influenced the allegory of Spenser.\r\n\r\n=6. Alexander Barclay (1476–1552)= might have been either a Scotsman\r\nor an Englishman for all that is known on the subject. He was a priest\r\nin Devonshire, and later withdrew to a monastery in Ely. His important\r\npoem, _The Ship of Fools_, a translation of a German work by Sebastian\r\nBrant, represents a newer type of allegory. The figures in the poem\r\nare not the usual wooden creatures representing the common vices and\r\nvirtues, but they are sharply satirical portraits of the various kinds\r\nof foolish men. Sometimes Barclay adds personal touches to make the\r\ngeneral satire more telling. _Certayne Ecloges_, another of Barclay’s\r\nworks, is the earliest English collection of pastorals. It contains,\r\namong much grumbling over the times, quite attractive pictures of the\r\ncountry life of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROSE-WRITERS\r\n\r\n=1. Reginald Pecock (1395–1460)= may have been born in Wales, and\r\nperhaps in 1395. He was educated at Oxford, and took orders, when\r\nhe became prominent through his attacks upon the Lollards. In his\r\narguments he went so far that he was convicted of heresy (1457),\r\nforced to make a public recantation, and deprived of his bishopric of\r\nChichester. He died in obscurity about 1460.\r\n\r\nHis two works were _The Repressor of Over-much Blaming the Clergy_\r\n(1449) and _The Book of Faith_. In his dogma he strongly supported\r\nthe ancient usages of the Church; and in the style of his argument he\r\nis downright and opinionative. His prose, often rugged and obscure, is\r\nmarked by his preference for English words in place of those of Latin\r\norigin. His books are among the earliest of English controversial\r\nworks, and thus they mark a victory over the once all-important Latin.\r\n\r\n=2. William Caxton (1422–91)=, the first English printer, was born\r\nin Kent about the year 1422. He was apprenticed to a London mercer,\r\nand in his capacity of mercer went to Bruges to assist in the revival\r\nof English trade with the Continent. In Bruges, where he lived for\r\nthirty-three years, he started his translations from the French, and\r\nin that city he may have learned the infant art of printing. In 1476\r\nhe established himself in London as a printer. There he began to issue\r\na series of books that laid the foundation of English printing. The\r\nfirst book printed in England was _The Dictes and Sayengis of the\r\nPhilosophers_ (1477). The main part of the volume was the work of\r\nLord Rivers, but Caxton, as was his habit, revised it for the press.\r\n\r\nIn addition to printing many older texts, such as Chaucer and Malory,\r\nCaxton did some original work of great value. He translated and printed\r\nno fewer than twenty-one books, French texts, the most remarkable of\r\nwhich were the two earliest, _The Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye_\r\n(1469) and _The Game and Playe of Chesse_ (1474). Like King Alfred, he\r\nadded to many of his books introductory remarks, some of great personal\r\nor general interest.\r\n\r\nWe give a brief extract from his preface to _The Recuyell_. Observe the\r\nrather clumsy sentences and the plain language.\r\n\r\n   When I remember that every man is bounden by the commandment\r\n   and counsel of the wise man to eschew sloth and idleness, which\r\n   is mother and nourisher of vices, and ought to put myself unto\r\n   virtuous occupation and business, then I, having no great charge\r\n   of occupation, following the said counsel, took a French book\r\n   and read therein many strange and marvellous histories wherein\r\n   I had great pleasure and delight, as well for the novelty of\r\n   the same as for the fair language of French, which was in prose\r\n   so well and compendiously set and written, which methought I\r\n   understood the sentence and substance of every matter. And\r\n   forsomuch as this book was new and late made and drawn into\r\n   French, and never had seen it in our English tongue, I thought\r\n   in myself it should be a good business to translate it into our\r\n   English, to the end that it might be had as well in the realm\r\n   of England as in other lands, and also for to pass therewith\r\n   the time, and thus concluded in myself to begin this said\r\n   work. And forthwith took pen and ink and began boldly to run\r\n   forth as blind Bayard, in this present work which is named the\r\n   _Recuyell_ of the Trojan histories.\r\n\r\n=3. John Fisher (1459–1535)= was born in Yorkshire about 1459, was\r\neducated at Cambridge, and entered the Church. In due course he became\r\nBishop of Rochester. During the time of the Reformation he opposed\r\nHenry VIII’s desire to be acknowledged as the head of the English\r\nChurch, and was imprisoned in the Tower (1531). While there he was made\r\na cardinal by the Pope; and he was beheaded by the orders of Henry.\r\n\r\nFisher wrote much in Latin, and in English he is represented by a\r\nsmall collection of tracts and sermons and a longer treatise on\r\nthe Psalms. Though they are of no great quantity, his prose works\r\nare in their nature of much importance. They are the first of the\r\nrhetorical-religious books that for several centuries were to be an\r\noutstanding feature of English prose. In addition, they show a decided\r\nadvance in the direction of style. They are written in the style of\r\nthe orator and are the result of the conscious effort of the stylist:\r\nthe searching after the appropriate word (often apparent by the use of\r\ntwo or three words of like meaning), the frequent use of rhetorical\r\nfigures of speech, and a rapid and flowing rhythm. In brief, in the\r\nstyle of Fisher we can observe the beginnings of an ornate style. It is\r\nstill in the making, but it is the direct ancestor of the prose style\r\nof Jeremy Taylor and other divines of the same class.\r\n\r\nIn the following passage observe the use of such doublets as “painful\r\nand laborious,” “rest and ease,” and “desire and love.” The rhythm is\r\nsupple, there is a quick procession of phrases, and the vocabulary is\r\ncopious and Latinized to a considerable extent.\r\n\r\n   What life is more painful and laborious of itself than is the\r\n   life of hunters which, most early in the morning, break their\r\n   sleep and rise when others do take their rest and ease, and in\r\n   his labour he may use no plain highways and the soft grass, but\r\n   he must tread upon the fallows, run over the hedges, and creep\r\n   through the thick bushes, and cry all the long day upon his\r\n   dogs, and so continue without meat or drink until the very night\r\n   drive him home; these labours be unto him pleasant and joyous,\r\n   for the desire and love that he hath to see the poor hare chased\r\n   with dogs. Verily, verily, if he were compelled to take upon him\r\n   such labours, and not for this cause, he would soon be weary of\r\n   them, thinking them full tedious unto him; neither would he rise\r\n   out of his bed so soon, nor fast so long, nor endure these other\r\n   labours unless he had a very love therein.\r\n                                         _The Ways to Perfect Religion_\r\n\r\n\r\n=4. Hugh Latimer (1491–1555)= was born in Leicestershire, educated\r\nat Cambridge, and rose to be chaplain to Henry VIII and Bishop of\r\nWorcester. He resisted some of the reforms of Henry, was imprisoned in\r\nthe Tower, and was released on the death of the King. At the accession\r\nof Mary he was once again thrown into jail, and was burned at Oxford.\r\n\r\nLatimer’s English prose works consist of two volumes of sermons\r\npublished in 1549. They are remarkable for their plain and dogmatic\r\nexposition, their graphical power, and their homely appeal. He is the\r\nfirst of the writers of plain style.\r\n\r\n=5. Sir Thomas More (1478–1535)= was born in London, and was the\r\nson of a judge. He was educated in London, attached to the household of\r\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury, and became a lawyer. A man of eager and\r\naspiring mind, he fell under the influence of Erasmus, Colet, and other\r\nhumanists of the period. For a time he sat in Parliament and saw State\r\nservice. His advanced political views led to his imprisonment (1534),\r\nand he was beheaded in the following year.\r\n\r\nOwing to their elegance and wit, his Latin works are of unusual\r\nimportance. They include his _Utopia_, the description of his\r\nimaginary ideal state. This book was not translated into English until\r\n1551, and so does not count as an English work of More’s. His English\r\nprose works include _The Lyfe of John Picus_, _The Historie of\r\nRichard III_, and a number of tracts and letters. He writes ably\r\nand clearly, but with no great distinction of manner. He is the first\r\nwriter of the middle style.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF LITERARY FORMS\r\n\r\n=1. Poetry.= In this period we have to chronicle the appearance of\r\nthe _eclogue_ or _pastoral_ in the work of Barclay (_Ecloges_) and in\r\nsome shorter poems like Henryson’s _Robene and Makyne_. The pastoral,\r\nwhich in classical times had been practiced by Virgil and Theocritus,\r\nbecame a common form of poetical exercise in Italy, France, and Spain\r\nbefore, in the sixteenth century, it appeared in England. It was marked\r\nby a set of conventional shepherds and shepherdesses, possessing\r\nsuch names as Colin, Phyllis, and Phœbe; by stock scenes introducing\r\nsheep, meadows, and flowers; and it was often made the medium for\r\nphilosophical and political theories. As yet the golden age of the\r\npastoral had not made its appearance in England, but the beginning of\r\nthe vogue was apparent.\r\n\r\nA glance at the poems mentioned in this chapter will reveal the\r\nimportance of the _allegory_. In this period it grew and hardened\r\ninto a mechanical and soulless device, for the poets lacked sufficient\r\npoetical fire to give it life. The allegory, as we can see in Dunbar’s\r\n_Golden Targe_ and Lydgate’s _Temple of Glass_, usually opened with\r\na garden and a dream, conventionalized to an absurd degree, and it\r\ncontinued with the introduction of the Goddess of Love, the Virtues and\r\nVices, and similar stock personations. The allegory, however, in spite\r\nof its enormous elaboration, was not at the end of its popularity, and,\r\nas we shall see in the next chapter, it was to add another great poet\r\nto its list of devotees.\r\n\r\nThe development of the _ballad_ and _carol_ continued, with highly\r\nsatisfactory results. These poems began to acquire polish and\r\nexpertness, for the early rudeness was becoming a thing of the past.\r\nTo this period probably belong the lovely carol to the Virgin Mary\r\nbeginning “I sing of a maiden,” and the ballads connected with Robin\r\nHood, Fair Rosamund, and many others.\r\n\r\n=2. Prose.= There were no outstanding achievements in prose, but facts\r\nall helped to reveal the waning influence of Latin and the increasing\r\nimportance given to English. English prose appeared in theological\r\nworks, as in those of Fisher; and =Cranmer (1489–1556)= gave it a\r\nnew field in his notable English Prayer Book. Historical prose was\r\nrepresented by _The Chronicle of England_ of =Capgrave (1393–1464)=,\r\nwho wrote in a businesslike fashion; a species of philosophical prose\r\nappeared in _The Governance of England_ of =Fortescue (1394–1476)=, and\r\nin _The Boke named the Governour_ of =Eylot (1490–1546)=, a kind of\r\neducational work; _The Castle of Health_, also by the last author, was\r\na medical work. The great race of Elizabethan translators is well begun\r\nby =Lord Berners (1467–1533)=, who translated Froissart with freedom\r\nand no mean skill; and, lastly, the English Bible was taking shape.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ENGLISH BIBLE\r\n\r\nThe work on the English Bible began as early as the eighth century,\r\nwhen Bede translated a portion of the Gospel of St. John into Old\r\nEnglish prose. The work was ardently continued during the Old English\r\nperiod--for example, in the Lindisfarne Gospels (about 700) and\r\nthe prose of Ælfric (about 1000). During the Anglo-Norman period,\r\nowing to the influence of French and Latin, English translation did\r\nnot flourish; but efforts were made, especially in the Psalms and\r\nthe Pauline epistles. Translation was systematically undertaken by\r\n=Wyclif (1320–84)=, under whose direction two complete versions\r\nwere carried through about 1384 and 1388. How much actual translation\r\nWyclif accomplished will never be known, but his was the leading\r\nspirit, and to him falls the glory of being the leader in the great\r\nwork. To the second of the Wycliffian versions is sometimes given the\r\nname of =John Purvey=, the Lollard leader who succeeded Wyclif.\r\nThe two versions are simple and unpretentious renderings, the second\r\nbeing much more finished than the first.\r\n\r\nAfter Wyclif translation flagged till the Reformation bent men’s minds\r\nanew to the task. The greatest of all the translators was =William\r\nTyndale (1485–1536)=, who did much to give the Bible its modern\r\nshape. Tyndale suffered a good deal of persecution owing to his\r\nhardihood, and was driven abroad, where much of his translation was\r\naccomplished, and where it was first printed. It was at Cologne that\r\nthe first English Bible appeared in print. A feature of Tyndale’s\r\ntranslation was its direct reliance upon the Hebrew and Greek\r\noriginals, and not upon the Latin renderings of them. Of these Latin\r\ntexts the stock version was the Vulgate, upon which Wyclif to a large\r\nextent relied.\r\n\r\n=Miles Coverdale (1488–1568)= carried on the work of Tyndale. Though he\r\nlacked the latter’s scholarship, he had an exquisite taste for phrase\r\nand rhythm, and many of the most beautiful Biblical expressions are of\r\nhis workmanship.\r\n\r\nTranslations now came apace. None of them, however, was much\r\nimprovement upon Tyndale’s. In 1537 appeared the finely printed version\r\nof “Thomas Matthew,” who was said to be =John Rogers=, a friend of\r\nCoverdale. The _Great Bible_, the first of the authorized versions,\r\nwas executed by a commission of translators, working under the command\r\nof Henry VIII. It was based on Matthew’s Bible. Another notable\r\ntranslation was the Calvinistic _Geneva Bible_ (1560). This book\r\nreceived the popular name of “_Breeches Bible_,” owing to its rendering\r\nof Genesis iii, 7: “They sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves\r\nbreeches.” In the reign of Elizabeth was issued the _Bishops’ Bible_\r\n(1568), a magnificent folio, which was translated by a committee of\r\nbishops and learned men. It was intended to be a counterblast to the\r\ngrowing popularity of the Breeches Bible.\r\n\r\nWith these we are close upon the great _Authorized Version_ (1611),\r\nwhich we shall mention in the next chapter, where also we shall briefly\r\ndiscuss the influence and the literary qualities of this translation. A\r\nfew representative passages from the early translations will be found\r\nin the exercises attached to this chapter.\r\n\r\n=3. The Drama.= As we have arrived on the threshold of the great\r\nElizabethan drama, it is here convenient to sketch the growth of the\r\ndramatic form of literature.\r\n\r\n(_a_) THE ORIGINS. (1) _Classical._ By the fourth or fifth century the\r\nLatin drama had become degraded almost past recognition. It left the\r\nmerest traces in the _mimes_, who were professional strolling players\r\ncommon to all Europe during the Dark Ages. Their performances seem\r\nto have been poor and ribald enough, and they left little trace upon\r\nEnglish drama.\r\n\r\n(2) _Popular Elements._ At the great festivities, such as those at\r\nEaster and Yule, there were popular shows that included a large amount\r\nof acting and speaking. These plays, rude and childish probably,\r\nwere survivals of ancient pagan beliefs and contained many scraps of\r\nfolk-lore. There were nature-myths, such as that representing the\r\nexpulsion of winter, in which a figure representing summer was slain\r\nand then revived. In England these _mummings_, as they were called,\r\ndeveloped into elaborate sword-play, into morris-dancing (partly of\r\nforeign origin), and into dramatic versions of the feats of Robin Hood\r\nand St. George. These plays, which were commonly acted at the feast\r\nof Corpus Christi, were the occasion of fun and license, particularly\r\nat the election of the “Abbot of Unreason,” with his attendants, the\r\nhobby-horse and the clown.\r\n\r\n(3) _Ecclesiastical Elements._ In early times the Church was the chief\r\nsupporter of the popular drama. The Church service, including the Mass\r\nitself, contains dramatic elements. In the course of time, in order to\r\nmake the Church services more intelligible and attractive, there grew\r\nup a habit of exhibiting “living pictures” illustrating Gospel stories,\r\nespecially those connected with Easter. As early as the fifth century\r\nwe have mention of such primitive dramatic entertainments, which\r\nwere accompanied by the singing of hymns. Such was the origin of the\r\n_mystery_.\r\n\r\n(_b_) THE MYSTERY-PLAY. The mystery was the dramatic representation\r\nof some important Biblical theme, such as the Nativity or the\r\nResurrection. There were stock characters, set speeches (usually in\r\ndoggerel verse), and a rudimentary plot supplied by the Biblical\r\nnarrative. The mystery was in existence as early as the tenth century.\r\nPriests took part in the plays, though it is not certain that they\r\nwrote them; and the performances took place in the vicinity of some\r\nchurch. This feature proved so attractive that the mystery developed\r\nquite elaborate forms. The mystery-play proper centered around the\r\nCrucifixion and the Resurrection, but other themes that grew into favor\r\nwere those of the Fall, Noah, Daniel, and Lazarus.\r\n\r\nWe add a brief passage from an ancient Cornish mystery. The reader\r\nshould observe the set speeches of uniform length, the simple style,\r\nand the rhymeless stanzas.\r\n\r\n    _Mary Magdalene._ Oh! let us hasten at once,\r\n            For the stone is raised\r\n              From the tomb.\r\n            Lord, how will it be this night,\r\n            If I know not where goes\r\n              The head of royalty?\r\n\r\n    _Mary, Mother of James._ And too long we have stayed,\r\n          My Lord has gone his way\r\n            Out of the tomb, surely.\r\n          Alas! my heart is sick;\r\n          I know not indeed if I shall see him,\r\n            Who is very God.\r\n\r\n    _Mary Salome._ I know truly, and I believe it,\r\n          That he is risen up\r\n            In this day.\r\n          How long will it be to us now,\r\n          That we find not our Lord?\r\n          Alas! woe! woe!\r\n\r\n                                   [_They sing._\r\n\r\n                   _The Dirge_\r\n\r\n        Alas! mourning I sing, mourning I call,\r\n        Our Lord is dead that bought us all.\r\n                                  _The Three Maries_\r\n\r\n(_c_) THE MIRACLE-PLAY. From the well-developed mystery-play it was but\r\na step to the _miracle-play_. In such plays the theme passed from the\r\nScriptural story to that of the lives of the saints. The plots were\r\nmuch more varied, the characters nearer to human experience, and the\r\nstyle rather more urbane.\r\n\r\n(_d_) THE MORALITY-PLAY registered a further advance. In such plays\r\nvirtues and vices were presented on the stage as allegorical creations,\r\noften of much liveliness. Abstractions such as Justice, Mercy,\r\nGluttony, and Vice were among the commonest characters. An important\r\nfeature of this class of play is the development of characterization.\r\nIt is almost crude; but it is often strongly marked and strongly\r\ncontrasted, with broad farcical elements. The favorite comic character\r\nwas Vice, whose chief duty was to tease the Devil.\r\n\r\n_Everyman_ (about 1490), perhaps the best of the morality-plays,\r\nis represented by the brief extract here given. The characters are\r\nsimply but effectively drawn, and the play does not lack a noble\r\npathos.\r\n\r\n    _Everyman._ O all thing faileth, save God alone;\r\n         Beauty, Strength, and Discretion;\r\n         For when Death bloweth his blast,\r\n         They all run from me full fast.\r\n\r\n    _Five-Wits._ Everyman, my leave now of thee I take;\r\n         I will follow the other, for here I thee forsake.\r\n\r\n    _Everyman._ Alas! then may I wail and weep,\r\n         For I took you for my best friend.\r\n\r\n    _Five-Wits._ I will no longer thee keep;\r\n         Now farewell, and there an end.\r\n\r\n    _Everyman._ O Jesu, help, all hath forsaken me!\r\n\r\n    _Good-Deeds._ Nay, Everyman, I will bide with thee,\r\n         I will not forsake thee indeed;\r\n         Thou shalt find me a good friend at need.\r\n\r\n    _Everyman._ Gramercy, Good-Deeds; now may I true friends see;\r\n         They have forsaken me every one;\r\n         I loved them better than my Good-Deeds alone.\r\n         Knowledge, will ye forsake me also?\r\n\r\n    _Knowledge._ Yea, Everyman, when ye to death do go:\r\n         But not for no manner of danger.\r\n\r\n    _Everyman._ Gramercy, Knowledge, with all my heart.\r\n\r\n(_e_) THE PLAY-CYCLES. As the plays developed, so did the demands\r\nupon the stagecraft of the performers. At first the priests were\r\nequal to it. Quite elaborate erections were used. In the very early\r\nproductions a popular setting was an erection in three stories. The top\r\nrepresented heaven, with the heavenly inhabitants, the “middel erde”\r\nwas in the center, and lowest of all were the flames of hell, tenanted\r\nby cheerfully disposed devils. In the course of time the acting passed\r\nfrom the priests into the hands of the craftsmen, the students, and\r\nthe schoolboys. The merchants’ guilds, in particular, were the most\r\nconsistent supporters of the drama.\r\n\r\nA curious feature was the fashion in which the plays ran in cycles or\r\ngroups, each of which became associated with some town. The earliest\r\nis the Chester play-cycle (1268–76), comprising twenty-four plays;\r\nothers are the York, with forty-nine; the Townley, with thirty-two,\r\nacted at the fairs at Widkirk; and the Coventry, of which only one play\r\nsurvives. Each member of the play-series was connected in theme with\r\nthe others, and the complete cycle illustrated Bible history in all its\r\nstages.\r\n\r\nEach company of the guild, say the Barbers or the Wax-chandlers, took a\r\nunit of the series. Each unit was short, corresponding to an _act_\r\nof the modern drama. They were composed in a great variety of meters,\r\nfrom doggerel to complicated lyrical stanzas.\r\n\r\nEach company having selected and rehearsed its play, the entire\r\napparatus was enclosed in a huge vehicle called the _pageant_.\r\nThe body of the vehicle was enclosed, and served as the dressing-and\r\nproperty-room; the top was an open-air stage. On the day of the\r\nfestival, which at York and Coventry was Corpus Christi, the whole\r\ncontrivance was pulled about the town, and performances were given\r\nat certain fixed points, of which the abbey was the chief. In _A\r\nMidsummer Night’s Dream_ Shakespeare has caricatured many features\r\nof these artisans’ dramatic performances.\r\n\r\n(_f_) THE INTERLUDE. The last predecessor of the drama proper was\r\nthe _interlude_, which flourished about the middle of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. It had several distinguishing points: it was a short play that\r\nintroduced real characters, usually of humble rank, such as citizens\r\nand friars; there was an absence of allegorical figures; there was much\r\nbroad farcical humor, often coarse; and there were set scenes, a new\r\nfeature in the English drama. It will be observed that the interlude\r\nwas a great advance upon the morality-play. =John Heywood=, who lived\r\nin the latter half of the sixteenth century, was the most gifted writer\r\nof the interlude. _The four P’s_ is one of his best. It is composed in\r\ndoggerel verse, and describes a lying-match between a Pedlar, a Palmer,\r\na Pardoner, and a Potycary. His _Johan Johan_ has much sharp wit and\r\nmany clever sayings.\r\n\r\n(_g_) THE EARLIEST DRAMAS. Our earliest dramas began to appear about\r\n1550. Their immediate cause was the renewed study of the classical\r\ndrama, especially the plays of Seneca (3 B.C.-A.D. 65), whose\r\nmannerisms were easily imitated by dramatic apprentices. The classical\r\ndrama gave English drama its five acts, its set scenes, and many other\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\n(1) _Tragedies._ The first tragedies had the Senecan stiffness of\r\nstyle, the conventional characters and plot, though in some cases\r\nthey adopted the “dumb show,” an English feature. _Gorboduc_ (1562),\r\nafterward called _Ferrex and Porrex_, written by Norton and Lord\r\nBuckhurst, was probably the earliest, and was acted at the Christmas\r\nrevels of the Inner Temple. The meter was a wooden type of regular\r\nblank verse. Other plays of a similar character were _Appius and\r\nVirginia_ (1563), of anonymous authorship; the _Historie of Horestes_\r\n(1567), also anonymous; _Jocasta_ (1566); and Preston’s _Cambises, King\r\nof Percia_ (1570). Hughes’s _Misfortunes of King Arthur_ (1587) broke\r\naway from the classical theme, but, like the others, it was a servile\r\nimitation of classical models. Many of the plays, however, preserved a\r\npeculiarly English feature in the retention of the comic Vice.\r\n\r\n(2) _Histories._ Along with the alien classical tragedy arose\r\na healthier native breed of historical plays. These plays, the\r\npredecessors of the historical plays of Shakespeare, were dramatized\r\nforms of the early chronicles, and combined both tragic and comic\r\nelements. This union of tragedy and comedy was alien to the classical\r\ndrama, and was the chief glory of the Elizabethan stage. Early\r\nhistorical plays were _The Famous Victories of Henry the Fifth_ (before\r\n1588), a mixture of rude verse and prose; _The Troublesome Raigne of\r\nKing John_ (before 1591); and _The Chronicle History of King Leir_\r\n(1594).\r\n\r\n(3) _Comedies._ Though the comedies drew much upon Latin comedians,\r\nsuch as Plautus, and upon Italian models also, they were to a great\r\nextent the growth of the English mumming element. They were composed\r\nusually in mixed verse and prose, the humor was of a primitive\r\ncharacter, but the best of them had verve and high good-humor, and\r\nthey were distinguished by some worthy songs and ditties. _Ralph\r\nRoister Doister_ (1551), by =Nicholas Udall=, is the earliest extant\r\ncomedy. Its author was the headmaster of Eton, and the play seems to\r\nhave been composed as a variant upon the Latin dramas that were the\r\nstock-in-trade of the schoolboy actors then common. Another comedy was\r\n_Gammer Gurton’s Needle_ (1575), the authorship of which is in dispute.\r\nThe plot is slight, but the humor, though the reverse of delicate,\r\nis abundant, and the play gives interesting glimpses of contemporary\r\nEnglish life.\r\n\r\nWe add a small scene from an early comedy. It shows the doggerel verse\r\nand the uninspired style--the homely natural speech of the time.\r\n\r\n    CHRISTIAN CUSTANCE                   MARGERIE MUMBLECRUST\r\n\r\n    _C. Custance._ Who took thee this letter, Margerie Mumblecrust?\r\n\r\n    _M. Mumble._ A lusty gay bachelor took it me of trust,\r\n         And if ye seek to him he will love your doing.\r\n\r\n    _C. Custance._ Yea, but where learned he that manner of wooing?\r\n\r\n    _M. Mumble._ If to sue to him, you will any pains take,\r\n         He will have you to his wife (he saith) for my sake.\r\n\r\n    _C. Custance._ Some wise gentleman, belike. I am bespoken:\r\n         And I thought verily this had been some token\r\n         From my dear spouse Gawin Goodluck, whom when him please,\r\n         God luckily send home to both our hearts’ ease.\r\n\r\n    _M. Mumble._ A joyly man it is, I wot well by report,\r\n         And would have you to him for marriage resort;\r\n         Best open the writing, and see what it does speak.\r\n\r\n    _C. Custance._ At this time, nurse, I will neither read ne break.\r\n\r\n    _M. Mumble._ He promised to give you a whole peck of gold.\r\n\r\n    _C. Custance._ Perchance, lack of a pint when it shall be all told.\r\n\r\n    _M. Mumble._ I would take a gay rich husband, and I were you.\r\n\r\n    _C. Custance._ In good sooth, Madge, e’en so would I, if I were thou.\r\n         But no more of this fond talk now, let us go in,\r\n         And see thou no more move me folly to begin.\r\n         Nor bring me no more letters for no man’s pleasure,\r\n         But thou know from whom.\r\n\r\n    _M. Mumble._ I warrant ye shall be sure.\r\n                                                 _Ralph Roister Doister_\r\n\r\n\r\n_Summary._ We can thus see the material that lay to the hand of\r\nShakespeare and his fellows. It was almost of uniform development and\r\nof ancient and diverse origin; it was frequently coarse and childish,\r\nbut its material was abundant and vital. The time was at hand, and\r\nso was the genius of the master to give this vast body a shape and\r\nimpulse. Almost in a day, after centuries of slow ripening, the harvest\r\ncame, with a wealth and excellence of fruition that is one of the\r\nmarvels of our literature.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF LITERARY STYLE\r\n\r\n=1. Poetry.= In English poetry there was a marked decadence in style.\r\nIn the works of Lydgate, Skelton, and Hawes the meters often became\r\nmere doggerel; there was little trace of real poetical imagination and\r\nphrasing; and the actual vocabulary is not striking. Compared with that\r\nof Chaucer, their work seems childish and inept. Many reasons have\r\nbeen advanced to explain this rapid collapse. The most obvious one is\r\nthe sheer lack of talent: there is nobody to carry on the Chaucerian\r\ntradition with any great credit. Another cause is probably the rapid\r\ndecay of the use of the final _e_, which in the meter of Chaucer was\r\nan item of much moment. Pronunciation of English was rapidly changing,\r\nand the new race of poets had not the requisite skill to modify the\r\nold meter to suit the new age. In Scottish poetry there is much\r\nactivity. To a large extent the Scottish poets were content to imitate\r\nthe mannerisms of Chaucer. In one respect, indeed, they carried his\r\ndescriptive-allegorical method too far, and made their poems lifeless.\r\nSuch were the less successful poems of Dunbar (_The Golden Targe_),\r\nand of Gawain Douglas (_The Palice of Honour_). On the other hand,\r\npeculiar Scottish features were not lacking: a breezy and sometimes\r\nvulgar humor, bred, perhaps, of the ruder folk and the bleaker air; a\r\nrobust independence and common sense; a note of passion and pathos;\r\nand a sense of the picturesque both in nature and in man. We find such\r\nfeatures illustrated, wholly or in part, in such poems as Lyndsay’s\r\n_Satyre of the Thrie Estatis_, in Dunbar’s _Lament for the Makaris_,\r\nand at the close of Henryson’s _Testament of Cresseid_.\r\n\r\n=2. Prose.= The development of prose style was marked by a number\r\nof small improvements which in the aggregate represented no small\r\nadvance. Unlike the poetry of the time, prose suffered from no\r\nretrogression. There was a perceptible increase in skill, due to\r\nincreased practice; there was a growing perception of the beauties\r\nof rhythm and cadence; and, in the purely formal sense, there was\r\nthe appearance of the prose paragraph. Above all, the chief prose\r\nstyles--the ornate, the middle, and the plain--are appearing faintly\r\nbut perceptibly. With their arrival the rapid development of English\r\nprose is assured.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               EXERCISES\r\n\r\n1. The following prose passages are early examples of ornate, middle,\r\nand simple styles.

The dominating features of the period can be\r\nconveniently summarized under two heads.\r\n\r\n=1. Settlement.= Both in politics and religion the English nation\r\nwas attaining to a state of stability. Dynastic problems, though they\r\nwere troublesome, were not sufficient to cause serious trouble; and the\r\nunion of the Crowns finally set at rest the ancient quarrel between\r\nScotland and England. In religion the same general features were\r\napparent--a general subsidence into quiescence, with minor disturbances\r\nat regular intervals. The settlement was all for the good of literature.\r\n\r\n=2. Expansion.= In our history this is perhaps the most remarkable\r\nepoch for the expansion of both mental and geographical horizons. New\r\nknowledge was pouring in from the East, and new worlds were opening\r\nin the West. The great voyagers, whose exploits were chronicled in\r\nthe immortal pages of =Hakluyt (1553–1616)=, brought home both\r\nmaterial and intellectual treasures from beyond the “still-vexed\r\nBermoothes,” as Shakespeare called them. It is unnecessary to enlarge\r\nupon the important effects which these revolutionary discoveries\r\nproduced in literature.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY FEATURES OF THE AGE\r\n\r\n=1. The New Classicism.= By the time of Elizabeth the Renaissance,\r\nas it was called, had made itself strongly felt in England. In\r\nparticular, there was an ardent revival in the study of Greek, which\r\nbrought a dazzling light into many dark places of the intellect.\r\nThe new passion for classical learning, in itself a rich and worthy\r\nenthusiasm, became quite a danger to the language. In all branches\r\nof literature Greek and Latin usages began to force themselves upon\r\nEnglish, with results not wholly beneficial. It said much for the\r\nnative sturdiness of English that, after a brief and vexed period of\r\ntransition, it threw off the worst effects of this deadening pressure.\r\nEnglish did not emerge unscathed from the contest. But, applied to this\r\nslight extent, the new classical influences were a great benefit: they\r\ntempered and polished the earlier rudeness of English literature.\r\n\r\n=2. Abundance of Output.= After the lean years of the preceding epoch\r\nthe prodigal issue of the Elizabethan age is almost embarrassing. As\r\nwe have pointed out, the historical situation encouraged a healthy\r\nproduction. The interest shown in literary subjects is quite amazing\r\nto a more chastened generation. Pamphlets and treatises were freely\r\nwritten; much abuse, often of a personal and scurrilous character,\r\nwas indulged in; and literary questions became almost of national\r\nimportance. To a great extent the controversies of the day were puerile\r\nenough, but at least they indicated a lively interest in the literature\r\nof the period.\r\n\r\n=3. The New Romanticism.= The romantic quest is for the remote, the\r\nwonderful, and the beautiful. All these desires were abundantly fed\r\nduring the Elizabethan age, which is our first and greatest romantic\r\nepoch. On the one hand, there was the revolt against the past, whose\r\ngrasp was too feeble to hold in restraint the lusty youth of the\r\nElizabethan age; on the other, there was a daring and resolute spirit\r\nof adventure in literary as well as in other regions; and, most\r\nimportant of all, there was an unmistakable buoyancy and freshness\r\nin the strong wind of the spirit. It was the ardent youth of English\r\nliterature, and the achievement was worthy of it.\r\n\r\n=4. The Drama.= The bold and critical attitude of the time was in\r\nkeeping with the dramatic instinct, which is analytic and observant.\r\nHence, after the long period of incubation detailed in the last\r\nchapter, the drama made a swift and wonderful leap into maturity.\r\nYet it had still many early difficulties to overcome. The actors\r\nthemselves were at variance, so much so that outrageous brawls were\r\nfrequent. On more than one occasion between 1590 and 1593 the theaters\r\nwere closed owing to disturbances caused by the actors. In 1594 the\r\nproblem was solved by the licensing of two troupes of players, the Lord\r\nChamberlain’s (among whom was Shakespeare) and the Lord Admiral’s.\r\nAnother early difficulty the drama had to face was its fondness for\r\ntaking part in the quarrels of the time--for example, in the burning\r\n“Marprelate” controversy. Owing to this meddling the theaters were\r\nclosed in 1589. Already, also, a considerable amount of Puritanical\r\nopposition was declaring itself. The most important anti-dramatic book\r\nof the day was Gosson’s virulent _School of Abuse_ (1579), to which\r\nSidney replied with his _Apologie for Poetrie_ (about 1580).\r\n\r\nIn spite of such early difficulties, the drama reached the splendid\r\nconsummation of Shakespeare’s art; but before the period closed decline\r\nwas apparent.\r\n\r\n=5. Poetry.= Though the poetical production was not quite equal to the\r\ndramatic, it was nevertheless of great and original beauty. As can be\r\nobserved from the disputes of the time, the passion for poetry was\r\nabsorbing, and the outcome of it was equal to expectation.\r\n\r\n=6. Prose.= For the first time prose rises to a position of first-rate\r\nimportance. The dead weight of the Latin tradition was passing away;\r\nEnglish prose was acquiring a tradition and a universal application;\r\nand so the rapid development was almost inevitable.\r\n\r\n=7. Scottish Literature.= A curious minor feature of the age was the\r\ndisappearance of Scottish literature, after its brief but remarkable\r\nappearance in the previous age. At this point it took to ground, and\r\ndid not reappear till late in the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDMUND SPENSER (1552–99)\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= From a passage in one of his sonnets it seems clear\r\nthat Spenser was born in 1552; and from another passage, in his\r\n_Prothalamion_, we can deduce that he was born in London. His parentage\r\nis unknown; but, though Spenser claimed kinship with the noble branch\r\nof the Spenser family, it is fairly certain that he was a member\r\nof some northern plebeian branch. He was educated at the Merchant\r\nTaylors’ School (just founded in 1560) and at Cambridge. He left\r\nCambridge in 1576, and for a few years his movements are unknown,\r\nthough he probably spent the time in the North of England. He comes\r\ninto view in London during the year 1579 as a member of the famous\r\nliterary circle surrounding Sir Philip Sidney and his uncle the Earl\r\nof Leicester. Sidney patronized Spenser, introducing him to the Queen\r\nand encouraging him in his imitation of the classical meters. In 1580\r\nSidney’s patronage bore fruit, for Spenser was appointed secretary to\r\nLord Grey de Wilton, who had just been appointed Lord-Deputy of Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland Spenser remained for eighteen years, serving the English\r\ngovernment in more than one capacity, and seeing his share of the\r\nrebellion, outrage, and misery that afflicted the unhappy land. In the\r\nend his services were requited by the grant of Kilcolman Castle, near\r\nLimerick, and an estate of three thousand acres. In 1589 he visited\r\nLondon to publish the first three books of _The Faerie Queene_.\r\nAfter remaining in London for nearly two years he returned to Ireland;\r\nmarried an Irishwoman (1591); revisited London in 1596, bringing\r\na second instalment of his great work; and once more returned to\r\nKilcolman, which was ultimately burnt down (1598) during one of the\r\nsporadic rebellions that tormented the country. One of his children\r\nperished in the fire. A ruined and disappointed man, he repaired to\r\nLondon, where in the next year he died, “for lack of bread,” according\r\nto the statement of Ben Jonson.\r\n\r\n=2. His Minor Poems.= The first of the poems that have descended to us\r\nis _The Shepherd’s Calendar_ (1579). The title, adopted from a popular\r\ncompilation of the day, suggests the contents: a series of twelve\r\neclogues, one for each month of the year. Each eclogue, as is common\r\nwith the species, is in dialogue form, in which the stock pastoral\r\ncharacters, such as Cuddie, Colin Clout, and Perigot, take part. The\r\npieces, though they are of no great poetical merit, served as excellent\r\npoetical exercises, for they range widely in meter, contain much\r\nskillful alliteration, and juggle with the conventional phrases of the\r\npastoral.\r\n\r\nA volume of miscellaneous poems, including _The Ruins of Time_,\r\n_The Tears of the Muses_, _Mother Hubberd’s Tale_, and _The Ruins\r\nof Rome_, appeared in 1591; in 1595 he published his _Amoretti_, a\r\nseries of eighty-eight sonnets celebrating the progress of his love;\r\n_Epithalamion_, a magnificent ode, rapturously jubilant, written in\r\nhonor of his marriage; and _Colin Clouts Come Home Againe_, somewhat\r\nwordy, but containing some interesting personal details. In 1596\r\nappeared his _Four Hymns_ and _Prothalamion_, the latter not so fine as\r\nthe great ode of the previous year.\r\n\r\nSpenser’s shorter poems illustrate his lyrical ability, which is\r\nmoderate in quality. His style is too diffuse and ornate to be\r\nintensely passionate; but, especially in the odes, he can build up\r\nsonorous and commanding measures which by their weight and splendor\r\ndelight both mind and ear. To a lesser extent, as in _Mother Hubberd’s\r\nTale_, the shorter poems afford him scope for his satirical bent, which\r\ncan be sharp and censorious.\r\n\r\nWe quote from the _Epithalamion_, which stands at the summit of English\r\nodes:\r\n\r\n    Open the temple gates unto my love,\r\n    Open them wide that she may enter in,\r\n    And all the posts adorn as doth behove,\r\n    And all the pillars deck with girlonds trim,\r\n    For to receive this Saint with honour due,\r\n    That cometh unto you.\r\n    With trembling steps, and humble reverence,\r\n    She cometh in, before the Almighty’s view;\r\n    Of her, ye virgins, learn obedience,\r\n    When so ye come into these holy places,\r\n    And humble your proud faces.\r\n    Bring her up to the high altar, that she may\r\n    The sacred ceremonies there partake,\r\n    The which do endless matrimony make;\r\n    And let the roaring organs loudly play\r\n    The praises of the Lord in lively notes;\r\n    The whiles, with hollow throats,\r\n    The choristers the joyous anthem sing,\r\n    That all the woods may answer, and their echo ring.\r\n\r\n=3. Prose.= In addition to his letters, which are often interesting and\r\ninformative, Spenser left one longish prose work, a kind of State paper\r\ndone in the form of a dialogue. Called _A View of the Present State\r\nof Ireland_ (1594), it gives Spenser’s views on the settlement of the\r\nIrish question. His opinions are exceeding hostile to the Irish, and\r\nhis methods, if put in force, would amount to pure terrorism. The style\r\nof the pamphlet is quite undistinguished.\r\n\r\n=4. The Faerie Queene.= In spite of the variety and beauty of his\r\nshorter poems, _The Faerie Queene_ is by far the most important of\r\nSpenser’s works.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Dates of Composition._ The work appeared in instalments. In 1589\r\nSpenser crossed to London and published the first three books; in 1596\r\nthe second three followed; and after his death two cantos and two odd\r\nstanzas of Book VII appeared. It was reported that more of the work\r\nperished in manuscript during the fire at Kilcolman, but this is not\r\ncertain.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The Plot._ The construction of the plot is so obscure\r\n(“clowdily enwrapped in Allegorical devises,” as Spenser himself says)\r\nthat he was compelled to write a preface, in the form of a letter\r\nto his friend Sir Walter Raleigh, explaining the scheme underlying\r\nthe whole. There were to be twelve books, each book to deal with the\r\nadventures of a particular knight, who was to represent some virtue.\r\nAs we have the poem, the first book deals with the Knight of the Red\r\nCross, representing Holiness; the second with Temperance; the third\r\nwith Chastity; the fourth with Friendship; and so on. The chief of\r\nall the twelve is Prince Arthur, who is to appear at critical moments\r\nin the poem, and who in the end is to marry Gloriana, the Queen of\r\n“Faerie-londe.” The plot is exceedingly leisurely and elaborate; it\r\nis crammed with incident and digression; and by the fifth book it is\r\npalpably weakening. It is therefore no misfortune (as far as the plot\r\nis concerned) that only half of the story is finished.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _The Allegory._ With its twelve divisions, each of which bears\r\nmany smaller branches, the allegory is the most complex in the\r\nlanguage. Through the story three strands keep running, twisting and\r\nuntwisting in a manner both baffling and delightful. (1) There are the\r\nusual characters, poorly developed, of the Arthurian and classical\r\nromance, such as Arthur, Merlin, Saracens, fauns, and satyrs. (2)\r\nThere are the allegorized moral and religious virtues, with their\r\ncounterparts in the vices: Una (Truth), Guyon (Temperance), Duessa\r\n(Deceit), Orgoglio (Pride).\r\n\r\n(3) Lastly, there is the strongly Elizabethan\r\npolitical-historical-religious element, also strongly allegorized. For\r\nexample, Gloriana is Elizabeth, Duessa may be Mary, Queen of Scots,\r\nArchimago may be the Pope, and Artegal (Justice) is said to be Lord\r\nGrey. Sometimes the allegory winds and multiplies in a bewildering\r\nfashion. Elizabeth, who is grossly and shamelessly flattered in the\r\npoem, is sometimes Gloriana, sometimes Belphœbe, or Britomart, or\r\nMercilla. It is very ingenious, but it retards the story.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _The Style._ No one, however, goes to Spenser for a story; one\r\ngoes to steep the senses in the rich and voluptuous style. The style\r\nhas its weaknesses: it is diffuse, and lacks judgment; it is weak in\r\n“bite” and in sharpness of attack; and it is misty and unsubstantial.\r\nBut for beauty long and richly wrought, for subtle and sustained\r\nmelody, for graphic word-pictures, and for depth and magical color of\r\natmosphere the poem stands supreme in English. Its imitators, good and\r\nbad, are legion. Milton, Keats, and Tennyson are among the best of\r\nthem, and its influence is still powerful.\r\n\r\n(_e_) _The Technique._ To the formal part of the poem Spenser devoted\r\nthe intelligence and care of the great artist. (1) First of all, he\r\nelaborated an archaic diction: “he writ no language,” said Ben Jonson,\r\nwho did not like the diction. When the occasion demanded it he invented\r\nwords or word-forms; for example, he uses _blend_ for _blind_, _kest_\r\nfor _cast_, and _vilde_ for _vile_. The result is not perhaps ideal,\r\nbut on the whole it suits the old-world atmosphere of the poem. (2) He\r\nintroduced the Spenserian stanza, which ever since has been one of the\r\nmost important measures in the language. Longer than the usual stanza,\r\nbut shorter than the sonnet, as a unit it is just long enough to give\r\nan easy pace to the slowly pacing narrative. The complicated rhymes of\r\nthe stanza suit the interwoven harmonies of the style; and the long\r\nline at the end acts either as a dignified conclusion or as a longer\r\nand stronger link with the succeeding stanza. (3) The alliteration,\r\nvowel-music, and cadence are cunningly fashioned, adroitly developed,\r\nand sumptuously appropriate. In these last respects Spenser is almost\r\npeerless.\r\n\r\nWe add two brief extracts to illustrate some features of the style. The\r\nreader should analyze the stanza and observe the graphical power and\r\nthe melodic beauty.\r\n\r\n    (1) And more to lulle him in his slumber soft,\r\n        A trickling streame from high rock tumbling downe,\r\n        And ever-drizling raine upon the loft,\r\n        Mixt with a murmuring winde, much like the sowne\r\n        Of swarming Bees, did cast him in a swowne.\r\n        No other noyse, nor peoples troublous cryes,\r\n        As still are wont t’annoy the walled towne,\r\n        Might there be heard; but carelesse Quiet lyes\r\n        Wrapt in eternall silence farre from enimyes.\r\n\r\n    (2) At last he came unto a gloomy shade,\r\n        Covered with boughes and shrubs from heavens light,\r\n        Whereas he sitting found in secret shade\r\n        An uncouth, salvage, and uncivile wight,[91]\r\n        Of griesly hew and foule ill favour’d sight;\r\n        His face with smoke was tand and eies were bleard,\r\n        His head and beard with sout were ill bedight,\r\n        His cole-blacke hands did seeme to have ben seard\r\n        In smythes fire-spitting forge, and nayles like clawes appeard.\r\n\r\n        His yron cote, all overgrowne with rust,\r\n        Was underneath enveloped with gold;\r\n        Whose glistring glosse, darkened with filthy dust,\r\n        Well yet appeared to have beene of old\r\n        A worke of rich entayle[92] and curious mould,\r\n        Woven with antickes and wyld ymagery;\r\n        And in his lap a masse of coyne he told,\r\n        And turned upside downe, to feede his eye\r\n        And covetous desire with his huge threasury.\r\n\r\n        And round about him lay on every side\r\n        Great heapes of gold that never could be spent;\r\n        Of which some were rude owre,[93] not purifide\r\n        Of Mulcibers devouring element;\r\n        Some others were new driven, and distent[94]\r\n        Into great Ingowes[95] and to wedges square;\r\n        Some in round plates withouten moniment;\r\n        But most were stampt, and in their metal bare\r\n        The antique shapes of kings and kesars straunge and rare.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER POETS\r\n\r\n=1. Sir Thomas Wyat (1503–42)= was descended from an ancient Yorkshire\r\nfamily which adopted the Lancastrian side in the Wars of the Roses.\r\nHe was educated at Cambridge, and, entering the King’s service, was\r\nentrusted with many important diplomatic missions. In public life his\r\nprincipal patron was Thomas Cromwell, after whose death he was recalled\r\nfrom abroad and imprisoned (1541). Though subsequently acquitted and\r\nreleased, he died shortly afterward.\r\n\r\nNone of Wyat’s poems is very long, though in number they are\r\nconsiderable. The most numerous of them are his love-poems, ninety-six\r\nin all, which appeared in a compendium of the day called _Tottel’s\r\nMiscellany_ (1557). The most noteworthy of these poems are the\r\nsonnets, the first of their kind in English, thirty-one in number. Of\r\nthese, ten are written almost entirely in the Italian or Petrarchan\r\nform. In sentiment the shorter poems, and especially the sonnets, are\r\nserious and reflective; in style and construction they are often too\r\nclosely imitative to be natural and genial; but as indications of the\r\nnew scholastic and literary influences at work upon English, sweetening\r\nand chastening the earlier uncouthness, they are of the highest\r\nimportance. Wyat’s epigrams, songs, and rondeaux are lighter than the\r\nsonnets, and they also reveal a care and elegance that were typical of\r\nthe new romanticism. His _Satires_ are composed in the Italian\r\n_terza rima_, once again showing the direction of the innovating\r\ntendencies.\r\n\r\n=2. Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey (1518–47)=, whose name is usually\r\nassociated in literature with that of Wyat, was the younger poet of\r\nthe two. He was the son of Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey, and when\r\nhis father became Duke of Norfolk (1524) the son adopted the courtesy\r\ntitle of Earl of Surrey. Owing largely to the powerful position of his\r\nfather, Surrey took a prominent part in the Court life of the time,\r\nand served as a soldier both in France and Scotland. He was a man of\r\nreckless temper, which involved him in many quarrels, and finally\r\nbrought upon him the wrath of the ageing and embittered Henry VIII. He\r\nwas arrested, tried for treason, and beheaded on Tower Hill.\r\n\r\nAbout 1542 Surrey began his literary relations with Wyat, who was his\r\nelder by fifteen years. His poems, which were the recreations of his\r\nfew leisure moments, and which were not published till after his death\r\n(1557), appeared along with Wyat’s in _Tottel’s Miscellany_. They\r\nare chiefly lyrical, and include a few sonnets, the first of their\r\nkind, composed in the English or Shakespearian mode--an arrangement of\r\nthree quatrains followed by a couplet. There are in addition a large\r\nnumber of love-poems addressed to a mysterious “Geraldine.” They are\r\nsmoother than Wyat’s poems, and are much more poetical in sentiment\r\nand expression. His most important poem was published separately:\r\n_Certain Bokes of Virgiles Æneis turned into English Meter_\r\n(1557). Though the actual translation is of no outstanding merit, the\r\nform is of great significance; it is done in blank verse, rather rough\r\nand frigid, but the earliest forerunner of the great achievements of\r\nShakespeare and Milton.\r\n\r\nIn the development of English verse Surrey represents a further stage:\r\na higher poetical faculty, increased ease and refinement, and the\r\nintroduction of two metrical forms of capital importance--the English\r\nform of the sonnet, and blank verse. We add a specimen of the earliest\r\nEnglish blank verse. It is wooden and uninspired, but as a beginning it\r\nis worthy of attention.\r\n\r\n    But now the wounded quene with heavie care\r\n    Throwgh out the vaines doth nourishe ay the plage,\r\n    Surprised with blind flame, and to her minde\r\n    Gan to resort the prowes of the man\r\n    And honor of his race, whiles on her brest\r\n    Imprinted stake his wordes and forme of face,\r\n    Ne to her lymmes care graunteth quiet rest.\r\n    The next morowe with Phœbus lampe the erthe\r\n    Alightned clere, and eke the dawninge daye\r\n    The shadowe danke gan from the pole remove.\r\n\r\n=3. Thomas Sackville, Earl of Dorset (1536–1608)=, was born at\r\nBuckhurst, in Sussex, and was educated both at Oxford and Cambridge. He\r\nwas called to the Bar, entered Parliament, took part in many diplomatic\r\nand public missions, and was created Lord Buckhurst in 1566. His plain\r\nspeaking did not recommend itself to Elizabeth, and for a time he was\r\nin disgrace. He was restored to favor, created Lord High Treasurer, and\r\nmade Earl of Dorset in 1604.\r\n\r\nIn bulk Sackville’s poetry does not amount to much, but in merit it is\r\nof much consequence. Two poems, _The Induction_ and _The Complaint of\r\nHenry, Duke of Buckingham_, appeared in a miscellany called _The Mirror\r\nfor Magistrates_ (1555). Both are composed in the rhyme royal stanza,\r\nare melancholy and elegiac in spirit and archaic in language, but\r\nhave a severe nobility of thought and a grandeur of conception and of\r\nlanguage quite unknown since the days of Chaucer. The poems undoubtedly\r\nassisted Spenser in the composition of _The Faerie Queene_.\r\n\r\nSackville collaborated with Norton in the early tragedy of _Gorboduc_\r\n(see p. 77).\r\n\r\nWe add a few stanzas from _The Induction_ to illustrate the somber\r\ngraphical power of the poem:\r\n\r\n    And, next in order, sad Old Age we found,\r\n    His beard all hoar, his eyes hollow and blind,\r\n    With drooping cheer still poring on the ground,\r\n    As on the place where nature him assigned\r\n    To rest, when that the Sisters had untwined\r\n    His vital thread, and ended with their knife\r\n    The fleeting course of fast-declining life.\r\n\r\n    There heard we him, with broke and hollow plaint,\r\n    Rue with himself his end approaching fast,\r\n    And all for nought his wretched mind torment\r\n    With sweet remembrance of his pleasures past,\r\n    And fresh delights of lusty youth forwaste;[96]\r\n    Recounting which, how would he sob and shriek,\r\n    And to be young again of Jove beseek!\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Crook-backed he was, tooth-shaken, and blear-eyed,\r\n    Went on three feet, and sometime crept on four;\r\n    With old lame bones, that rattled by his side;\r\n    His scalp all piled,[97] and he with eld forelore;\r\n    His withered fist still knocking at Death’s door;\r\n    Fumbling and drivelling as he draws his breath;\r\n    For brief, the shape and messenger of Death.\r\n\r\n=4. George Gascoigne (1535–77)= is another of the founders of the\r\ngreat Elizabethan tradition. He was born in Bedfordshire, educated at\r\nCambridge, and became a lawyer. Later in life he entered Parliament.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a large number of elegant lyrics, he composed one of\r\nthe first regular satires in the language, _The Steel Glass_ (1576).\r\nThis poem has the additional importance of being written in blank\r\nverse. Among his other numerous works we can mention his tragedy\r\n_Jocasta_ (1566), a landmark in the growth of the drama (see p. 77);\r\nhis _Supposes_ (1566), an important early comedy which was the basis of\r\nShakespeare’s _Taming of the Shrew_; and _Certayne Notes of Instruction\r\nconcerning the Making of Verse in English_ (1575), one of our earliest\r\ncritical essays. In ease and versatility Gascoigne is typical of the\r\nbest early Elizabethan miscellaneous writers.\r\n\r\n=5. Sir Philip Sidney (1554–86)= was the chief of an elegant literary\r\ncoterie, and exercised an influence which was almost supreme during his\r\nshort life. He was the most commanding literary figure before the prime\r\nof Spenser and Shakespeare. Born in Kent of an aristocratic family,\r\nhe was educated at Shrewsbury and Oxford, and then traveled widely.\r\nHe took a brilliant part in the military-literary-courtly life common\r\nwith the young nobles of the time, and at the early age of thirty-two\r\nwas mortally wounded at Zutphen when assisting the Dutch against the\r\nSpaniards.\r\n\r\nSidney was successful in more than one branch of literature, but\r\nhe owes his position chiefly to his collection of sonnets called\r\n_Astrophel and Stella_. Though they are strongly imitative of Italian\r\nsentiment, and are immature in thought and in general ideas, they are\r\noften remarkable for their flashes of real passion and their genuine\r\npoetical style. In metrical form they adopt the English scheme, and\r\nthus in another respect they foreshadow the great Shakespearian\r\nsonnets, to which alone they take second place.\r\n\r\n=6. Michael Drayton (1563–1631)= represents the later epoch of\r\nElizabethan literature. He was born in Warwickshire, studied at Oxford,\r\nwas attached to a noble family as tutor, came to London about 1590, and\r\nfor the remainder of his long life was busy in the production of his\r\nmany poems.\r\n\r\nHis first book was a collection of religious poems called _The Harmony\r\nof the Church_ (1591); then followed a number of long historical\r\npoems, which include _England’s Heroical Epistles_ and _The Barons’\r\nWars_ (1603). His _Polyolbion_ is the most important of his longer\r\npoems, and belongs to a later period of his career. It is a long,\r\ncareful, and tedious description of the geographical features of\r\nEngland, interspersed with tales, and written in alexandrines. His\r\nshorter poems, such as his well-known poem on Agincourt, and his verse\r\ntales and pastorals, such as _The Man in the Moon_ and _Nymphidia_,\r\nare skillful and attractive. Drayton is rarely an inspired poet--the\r\nwonderful sonnet beginning “Since there’s no help” (see p. 152) is\r\nperhaps his only poem in which we feel inspiration flowing freely--but\r\nhe is painstaking, versatile, and sometimes (as in _Nymphidia_)\r\ndelightful.\r\n\r\n=7. Thomas Campion (1567–1620)= was born in London, educated at\r\nCambridge, studied law in Gray’s Inn, but ultimately became a physician\r\n(1606). He wrote some masques that had much popularity, but his chief\r\nclaim to fame lies in his attractive lyrics, most of which have been\r\nset to music composed partly by the poet himself. His best-known\r\ncollections of songs were _A Booke of Ayres_ (1601), _Songs of\r\nMourning_ (1613), and _Two Bookes of Ayres_ (1613). Campion had not the\r\nhighest lyrical genius, but he had an ear skillful in adapting words\r\nto tunes, the knack of sweet phrasing, and a mastery of complicated\r\nmeters. He is one of the best examples of the accomplished poet\r\nwho, lacking the highest inspiration of poetry, excels in the lower\r\ntechnical features.\r\n\r\nThe lyric of Campion’s that we add is typical not only of his own grace\r\nand melody, but also of the later Elizabethan lyrics as a whole. The\r\nideas, in themselves somewhat forced and fantastic, are expressed with\r\ngreat felicity.\r\n\r\n    There is a garden in her face,\r\n      Where roses and white lilies blow;\r\n    A heavenly paradise is that place,\r\n      Wherein all pleasant fruits do grow;\r\n    There cherries grow that none may buy,\r\n    Till “Cherry-ripe” themselves do cry.\r\n\r\n    Those cherries fairly do enclose\r\n      Of orient pearl a double row,\r\n    Which when her lovely laughter shows,\r\n      They look like rose-buds fill’d with snow:\r\n    Yet them no peer nor prince may buy\r\n    Till “Cherry-ripe” themselves do cry.\r\n\r\n    Her eyes like angels watch them still;\r\n      Her brows like bended bows do stand,\r\n    Threat’ning with piercing frowns to kill\r\n      All that attempt with eye or hand\r\n    These sacred cherries to come nigh,\r\n    Till “Cherry-ripe” themselves do cry.\r\n\r\n=8. Phineas Fletcher (1582–1650)= and =Giles Fletcher (1588–1623)= are\r\nusually associated in the history of literature. They were brothers,\r\nwere both educated at Cambridge, and both took holy orders. Both were\r\npoetical disciples of Spenser.\r\n\r\nPhineas Fletcher’s chief poem is _The Purple Island, or The Isle of\r\nMan_ (1633), a curious work in twelve cantos describing the human\r\nbody in an allegorical-descriptive fashion. There is much digression,\r\nwhich gives the poet some scope for real poetical passages. In its plan\r\nthe poem is cumbrous and artificial, but it contains many descriptions\r\nin the Spenserian manner. The stanza is a further modification of the\r\nSpenserian, which it resembles except for its omission of the fifth and\r\nseventh lines.\r\n\r\nGiles’s best-known poem is _Christ’s Victorie and Triumph_ (1610),\r\nan epical poem in four cantos. The title of the poem sufficiently\r\nsuggests its subject; in style it is glowingly descriptive,\r\nimaginative, and is markedly ornate and melodious in diction. It is\r\nsaid partly to have inspired Milton’s _Paradise Regained_. The\r\nstyle is strongly suggestive of Spenser’s, and the stanza conveys the\r\nsame impression, for it is the Spenserian stanza lacking the seventh\r\nline.\r\n\r\nThe Fletchers are imitators, but imitators of high quality. They lack\r\nthe positive genius of their model Spenser, but they have intensity,\r\ncolor, melody, and great metrical artistry.\r\n\r\n=9. John Donne (1573–1631)= was born in London, the son of a\r\nwealthy merchant. He was educated at Oxford, and then studied law.\r\nThough he entered the public service and served with some distinction,\r\nhis bent was always theological, and in 1616 he was ordained. In 1621\r\nhe was appointed Dean of St. Paul’s.\r\n\r\nDonne’s poetical works are probably more important than those composed\r\nin prose, valuable though the latter are. He began poetical composition\r\nwith _Satires_ (1593), forcible and picturesque, though crabbed and\r\nobscure in language. His other poems include _The Progress of the\r\nSoul_, his longest poem, composed about 1600; _An Anatomy of the World_\r\n(1611), a wild, exaggerated eulogy of a friend’s daughter, who had\r\njust died; and a large number of miscellaneous poems, including songs,\r\nsonnets, elegies, and letters in verse.\r\n\r\nIn his nature Donne had a strain of actual genius, but his natural\r\ngifts were so obscured with fitful, wayward, and exaggerated mannerisms\r\nthat for long he was gravely underrated. His miscellaneous poems\r\nshow his poetical features at their best: a solemn, half-mystical,\r\nhalf-fanatical religious zeal; a style of somber grandeur, shot with\r\npiercing gleams of poetical imagery; and an almost unearthly music of\r\nword and phrase. Often, and especially in the _Satires_, he is\r\nrough and obscure; in thought and expression he is frequently fantastic\r\nand almost ludicrous; but at his best, when his stubborn, melancholy\r\nhumor is fired with his emotional frenzy, he is almost alone in his\r\ncurious compound of gloom and brilliance, of ice and consuming fire. He\r\nis the last of the Elizabethans, and among the first of the coming race\r\nof the “Metaphysicals.”\r\n\r\nHis prose works comprise a large number of sermons, a few theological\r\ntreatises, of which the greatest is _The Pseudo-Martyr_ (1609), and\r\na small number of personal letters. In its peculiar manner his prose\r\nis a reflex of his poetry. There is the same soaring and exaggerated\r\nimagery, the same fierce pessimism, and often the same obscurity and\r\nroughness. In prose his sentences are long and shapeless, but the\r\ncadence is rapid and free, and so is suited to the purposes of the\r\nsermon.\r\n\r\nAs a brief specimen of his poetical mannerisms, good and bad, we add\r\nthe following sonnet. The reader will observe the rugged grandeur of\r\nthe style and the curious intellectual twist that he gives to the\r\ngeneral idea of the poem.\r\n\r\n    Death, be not proud, though some have called thee\r\n    Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so;\r\n    For those, whom thou think’st thou dost overthrow,\r\n    Die not, poor Death; nor yet canst thou kill me.\r\n    From rest and sleep, which but thy picture be,\r\n    Much pleasure; then from thee much more must flow:\r\n    And soonest our best men with thee do go,\r\n    Rest of their bones, and soul’s delivery.\r\n    Thou’rt slave to fate, chance, kings, and desperate men,\r\n    And dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell,\r\n    And poppy or charms can make us sleep as well,\r\n    And better than thy stroke. Why swell’st thou then?\r\n    One short sleep past, we wake eternally;\r\n    And death shall be no more: Death, thou shalt die.\r\n                                                 _Holy Sonnetts_\r\n\r\n=10. Samuel Daniel (1562–1619)= was born near Taunton in Somerset,\r\neducated at Oxford, and became tutor to the son of the Countess of\r\nPembroke. For a time (1599) he was Poet Laureate, and was made (1603)\r\nMaster of the Queen’s Revels by James I.\r\n\r\nHis poems include a sonnet-series called _Delia_ (1592), a romance\r\ncalled _The Complaint of Rosamund_ (1592), some long historical poems,\r\nsuch as _The Civil Wars_ (1595), and a large number of masques, of\r\nwhich _The Queenes Wake_ (1610) and _Hymen’s Triumph_ (1615) are the\r\nmost important. His best work appears in his sonnets, which, composed\r\nin the English manner, carry on the great tradition of Sidney, Spenser,\r\nand Shakespeare. In his longer poems he is prosy and dull, though the\r\nmasques have pleasing touches of imagination.\r\n\r\n=11.= The =poetical miscellanies= which abound during this period\r\nare typical of the time. By the very extravagance of their titles\r\nthey reveal the enthusiasm felt for the revival of English poetry.\r\nEach volume consists of a collection of short pieces by various\r\npoets, some well known and others unknown. Some of the best poems are\r\nanonymous. Among much that is almost worthless, there are happily\r\npreserved many poems, sometimes by unknown poets, of great and\r\nenduring beauty. We have already drawn attention (p. 96) to _Tottel’s\r\nMiscellany_ (1557), which contained, among other poems, the pieces of\r\nWyat and Surrey. Other volumes are _The Paradyse of Daynty Devises_\r\n(1576), _A Handfull of Pleasant Delites_ (1584), _The Phœnix Nest_\r\n(1593), and _The Passionate Pilgrim_ (1599). The last book contains\r\npoems by Shakespeare, Marlowe, and Ralegh. The most important of the\r\nmiscellanies is _England’s Helicon_ (1600), which surpasses all others\r\nfor fullness, variety, and excellence of contents.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRE-SHAKESPEARIAN DRAMA: THE UNIVERSITY WITS\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter we gave a summary of the rise of the English\r\ndrama; it is now necessary to give an account of the early Elizabethan\r\nplaywrights.\r\n\r\nThe name “University Wits” is usually applied to a group of young\r\nmen, nearly all of whom were associated with Oxford or Cambridge, who\r\ndid much to found the Elizabethan school of drama. They were all more\r\nor less acquainted with each other, and most of them led irregular\r\nand stormy lives. Their plays had several features in common. These\r\nfeatures were of a nature almost inevitable in strong and immature\r\nproductions.\r\n\r\n(_a_) There was a fondness for heroic themes, such as the lives of\r\ngreat figures like Mohammed and Tamburlaine.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Heroic themes needed heroic treatment: great fullness and\r\nvariety; splendid descriptions, long swelling speeches, the handling of\r\nviolent incidents and emotions. These qualities, excellent when held in\r\nrestraint, only too often led to loudness and disorder.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The style also was “heroic.” The chief aim was to achieve strong\r\nand sounding lines, magnificent epithets, and powerful declamation.\r\nThis again led to abuse and to mere bombast, mouthing, and in the worst\r\ncases to nonsense. In the best examples, such as in Marlowe, the result\r\nis quite impressive. In this connection it is to be noted that the best\r\nmedium for such expression was blank verse, which was sufficiently\r\nelastic to bear the strong pressure of these expansive methods.\r\n\r\n(_d_) The themes were usually tragic in nature, for the dramatists\r\nwere as a rule too much in earnest to give heed to what was considered\r\nto be the lower species of comedy. The general lack of real humor in\r\nthe early drama is one of its most prominent features. Humor, when\r\nit is brought in at all, is coarse and immature. Almost the only\r\nrepresentative of the writers of real comedies is Lyly, who in such\r\nplays as _Alexander and Campaspe_ (1584), _Endymion_ (1592), and _The\r\nWoman in the Moon_ gives us the first examples of romantic comedy.\r\n\r\n=1. George Peele (1558–98)= was born in London, educated at Christ’s\r\nHospital and at Oxford, and became a literary hack and free-lance in\r\nLondon. His plays include _The Araygnement of Paris_ (1581), a kind\r\nof romantic comedy; _The Famous Chronicle of King Edward the First_\r\n(1593), a rambling chronicle-play; _The Old Wives’ Tale_ (1595), a\r\nclever satire on the popular drama of the day; and _The Love of King\r\nDavid and Fair Bethsabe_ (published 1599). Peele’s style can be violent\r\nto the point of absurdity; but he has his moments of real poetry; he\r\ncan handle his blank verse with more ease and variety than was common\r\nat the time; he is fluent; he has humor and a fair amount of pathos. In\r\nshort, he represents a great advance upon the earliest drama, and is\r\nperhaps the most attractive among the playwrights of the time.\r\n\r\nWe give a short example to illustrate the poetical quality of his blank\r\nverse:\r\n\r\n    _David._ Now comes my lover tripping like the roe,\r\n        And brings my longings tangled in her hair.\r\n        To ’joy her love I’ll build a kingly bower,\r\n        Seated in hearing of a hundred streams,\r\n        That, for their homage to her sovereign joys,\r\n        Shall, as the serpents fold into their nests,\r\n        In oblique turnings wind the nimble waves\r\n        About the circles of her curious walks,\r\n        And with their murmur summon easeful sleep\r\n        To lay his golden sceptre on her brows.\r\n                           _The Love of King David and Fair Bethsabe_\r\n\r\n=2. Robert Greene (1560–92)= wrote much and recklessly, but his\r\nplays are of sufficient merit to find a place in the development of\r\nthe drama. He was born at Norwich, educated at Cambridge (1575) and\r\nat Oxford (1588), and then took to a literary life in London. If all\r\naccounts, including his own, are true, his career in London must have\r\ntaken place in a sink of debauchery. He is said to have died, after\r\nan orgy in a London ale-house, “of a surfeit of pickle herringe and\r\nRennish wine.”\r\n\r\nHere we can refer only to his thirty-five prose tracts, which are\r\nprobably the best of his literary work, for they reveal his intense\r\nthough erratic energy, his quick, malicious wit, and his powerful\r\nimagination. His plays number four: _Alphonsus, King of Arragon_\r\n(1587), an imitation of Marlowe’s _Tamburlaine_; _Friar Bacon and\r\nFriar Bungay_ (1589), easily his best, and containing some fine\r\nrepresentations of Elizabethan life; _Orlando Furioso_ (1586), adapted\r\nfrom an English translation of Ariosto; and _The Scottish Historie of\r\nJames the Fourth_ (acted in 1592), not a “historical” play, but founded\r\non an imaginary incident in the life of the King. Greene is weak in\r\ncreating characters, and his style is not of outstanding merit; but his\r\nhumor is somewhat genial in his plays, and his methods less austere\r\nthan those of the other tragedians.\r\n\r\n=3. Thomas Nash (1567–1601)= was born at Lowestoft, educated\r\nat Cambridge, and then (1586) went to London to make his living by\r\nliterature. He was a born journalist, but in those days the only scope\r\nfor his talents lay in pamphleteering. He took an active part in the\r\npolitical and personal questions of the day, and his truculent methods\r\nactually landed him in jail (1600). He finished Marlowe’s _Dido_,\r\nbut his only surviving play is _Summer’s Last Will and Testament_\r\n(1592), a satirical masque. His _Jack Wilton, or The Unfortunate\r\nTraveller_ (1594), a prose tale, is important in the development of\r\nthe novel (see p. 336).\r\n\r\n=4. Thomas Lodge (1558–1625)= was the son of a Lord Mayor of London,\r\nwas educated in London and at Oxford, and studied law. He deserted his\r\nlegal studies, took to a literary career, and is said to have been an\r\nactor at one time.\r\n\r\nHis dramatic work is small in quantity. He probably collaborated with\r\nShakespeare in _Henry VI_, and with other dramatists, including\r\nGreene. The only surviving play entirely his own is _The Woundes\r\nof Civile War_, a kind of chronicle-play. His pamphleteering was\r\nvoluminous and energetic; and he imitated the euphuistic tales of Lyly.\r\n\r\n=5. Thomas Kyd (1558–94)= is one of the most important of the\r\nUniversity Wits. Very little is known of his life. He was born in\r\nLondon, educated (probably) at Merchant Taylors’ School, adopted\r\na literary career, and became secretary to a nobleman. He became\r\nacquainted with Marlowe, and that brilliant but sinister spirit\r\nenticed him into composing “lewd libels” and “blasphemies.” Marlowe’s\r\nsudden death saved him from punishment for such offenses; but Kyd was\r\nimprisoned and tortured. Though he was afterward released, Kyd soon\r\ndied under the weight of “bitter times and privy broken passions.”\r\n\r\nMuch of this dramatist’s work has been lost. Of the surviving plays\r\n_The Spanish Tragedy_ (about 1585) is the most important. Its horrific\r\nplot, involving murder, frenzy, and sudden death, gave the play a great\r\nand lasting popularity. There is a largeness of tragical conception\r\nabout the play that resembles the work of Marlowe, and there are\r\ntouches of style that dimly foreshadow the great tragical lines of\r\nShakespeare. Other plays of Kyd’s are _Soliman and Perseda_ (1588),\r\n_Jeronimo_ (1592), a kind of prologue to _The Spanish Tragedy_, and\r\n_Cornelia_ (1594), a tedious translation from the French.\r\n\r\n=6. Christopher Marlowe (1564–93)= is symbolical both of the best\r\nand the worst of his boisterous times. The eldest son of a shoemaker,\r\nhe was born at Canterbury, and educated there and at Cambridge. Like\r\nso many more of that day, he adopted literature as a profession, and\r\nbecame attached to the Lord Admiral’s players. Marlowe’s great mental\r\npowers had in them a twist of perversity, and they led him into many\r\nquestionable actions and beliefs. He became almost the pattern of the\r\nevil ways of his tribe. Charges of atheism and immorality were laid\r\nagainst him, and only his sudden death saved him from the experiences\r\nof his friend Kyd. Marlowe is said to have met his death in a tavern\r\nbrawl, “stabbed to death by a bawdy servingman, a rival of his in his\r\nlewde love.” In fairness to the memory of Marlowe it must be remembered\r\nthat these charges were made against him by the Puritanical opponents\r\nof the stage.\r\n\r\nWith Marlowe’s tragedies we at length come within measureable distance\r\nof Shakespeare. The gulf between the work of the two men is still very\r\ngreat. In Marlowe there is none of that benign humanity that clings to\r\neven the grimmest of Shakespeare’s tragedies. Marlowe’s characters\r\nare bleak in nature and massive in outline; enormous and majestical,\r\nbut forbidding and almost inhuman. His style has the same qualities:\r\nglowing with a volcanic energy, capable of a mighty soaring line and\r\nphrase (“Marlowe’s mighty line,” as Ben Jonson called it), but diffuse,\r\ntruculent, exaggerated, and bombastic. It is a lopsided style lacking\r\nthe more amiable qualities of humor, flexibility, sweetness, and\r\nbrevity.\r\n\r\nHis four great plays, all written within a few years, are _Tamburlaine\r\nthe Great_ (1587), _Doctor Faustus_ (1588), _The Jew of Malta_ (1589),\r\nand _Edward II_ (1593). All four, in their march of horrors and\r\nsplendors, are not unlike one another. The last has a conclusion which\r\nfor pity and terror ranks among the great achievements of Elizabethan\r\ntragedy. The plays, moreover, show a progressing dexterity in the\r\nhandling of blank verse. Marlowe’s life was pitiably short. If he had\r\nlived there might have been another triumph to chronicle.\r\n\r\nHe also collaborated with Nash in the tragedy of _Dido_ (1593), and\r\nleft uncompleted a poor fragment of a play called _The Massacre at\r\nParis_.\r\n\r\nWe give a brief extract to show the “mighty line.” In the passage\r\nTamburlaine, “the Scourge of God,” mentally reviews his past conquests.\r\n\r\n    And I have marched along the river Nile\r\n    To Machda where the mighty Christian priest,\r\n    Called John the Great, sits in a milk-white robe,\r\n    Whose triple mitre I did take by force,\r\n    And made him swear obedience to my crown,\r\n    From thence unto Cazates did I march,\r\n    Where Amazonians met me in the field,\r\n    With whom, being women, I vouchsafed a league,\r\n    And with my power did march to Zanzibar,\r\n    The eastern part of Afric, where I viewed\r\n    The Ethiopian sea, rivers and lakes,\r\n    But neither man nor child in all the land;\r\n    Therefore I took my course to Manico,\r\n    Where unresisted, I removed my camp,\r\n    And by the coast of Byather, at last\r\n    I came to Cubar, where the negroes dwell,\r\n    And conquering that, made haste to Nubia.\r\n    There having sacked Borno, the kingly seat,\r\n    I took the king, and led him bound in chains\r\n    Unto Damasco, where I stayed before.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM SHAKESPEARE (1564–1616)\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= In considering the life of Shakespeare we have at\r\nour disposal a fair number of facts; but on these facts the industry\r\nof commentators has constructed an additional mass of great magnitude\r\nand complexity. It is therefore the duty of the historian with only\r\na limited space at his disposal to keep his eye steadily upon the\r\nestablished facts and, without being superior or disdainful, to turn\r\ntoward speculation or surmise, however ingenious or laborious, a face\r\nof tempered but obdurate skepticism.\r\n\r\nThe future dramatist, as we learn from the church records, was baptized\r\nin the parish church at Stratford-on-Avon on April 26, 1564. He may\r\nhave been born on April 23, St. George’s Day, which happens also to\r\nbe the date of his death in 1616. His father, John Shakespeare, was a\r\nburgess of the town, and seems to have followed the occupations of a\r\nbutcher, a glover, and a farmer. The boy may have attended the grammar\r\nschool of the town, though Ben Jonson, himself a competent scholar,\r\naffirmed that Shakespeare knew “small Latin and less Greek.” From\r\nvarious entries in the town records it is clear that John Shakespeare,\r\nafter flourishing for a time, fell on evil days, and the son may have\r\nassisted in the paternal butcher’s shop. A bond dated November 28,\r\n1582, affords clear evidence of Shakespeare’s marriage on that date to\r\na certain “Anne Hatthwey of Stratford.” As at this time Shakespeare was\r\nonly eighteen, and (as appears from the inscription on her monument)\r\nthe bride was eight years older, speculation has busied itself over the\r\nsomewhat ill-assorted match.\r\n\r\nIn 1584 Shakespeare left his native town. Why he did so is not known.\r\nThe most popular explanation, which appeared after his death, is that\r\nhe was convicted of poaching on the estate of a local magnate, Sir\r\nThomas Lucy, and that he fled to escape the consequences. Then, until\r\n1592, when he reappears as a rising actor, Shakespeare disappears\r\nfrom view. During this period he is said to have wandered through the\r\ncountry, finally coming to London, where he performed various menial\r\noffices, including that of holding horses at the stage-door. On the\r\nface of them such tales are not improbable, but they grew up when the\r\ndramatist had become a half-mythical figure.\r\n\r\nIn 1592 Robert Greene, in a carping book called _A Groatsworth of\r\nWit_, mentions “an upstart crow ... in his own conceit the only\r\nShakescene in a country.”[98] This reference, most probably a gibe at\r\nShakespeare, shows that he is now important enough to merit abuse. In\r\n1595 his name appears on the payroll of the Lord Chamberlain’s company\r\nof actors, who performed at the Court. This company, one of the most\r\nimportant in the town, also played in the provinces, especially during\r\nthe plague of 1603, in the Shoreditch Theatre till it was demolished\r\nin 1598, in the Globe Theatre, and finally (after 1608) in the\r\nBlackfriars. During this period, as can be inferred from his purchases\r\nof property both in London and Stratford, Shakespeare was prospering in\r\nworldly affairs. He was a competent but not a great actor; tradition\r\nasserts that his chief parts were of the type of Adam in _As You Like\r\nIt_ and the Ghost in _Hamlet_. His chief function was to write\r\ndramas for his company, and the fruit of such labor was his plays.\r\n\r\nAbout 1610 Shakespeare left London for Stratford, where he stayed at\r\nNew Place, a house that he had bought. He may have written his last\r\nplays there; but it is likely that his connection with his company\r\nof actors ceased when the Globe Theatre was burned down during a\r\nperformance of _Henry VIII_ in 1613. His will, a hurriedly\r\nexecuted document, is dated March 25, 1616. His death occurred a month\r\nlater, April 23.\r\n\r\n=2. His Poems.= Shakespeare’s two long narrative poems were among\r\nthe earliest of his writings. _Venus and Adonis_ (1593), composed in\r\nsix-line stanzas, showed decided signs of immaturity. Its subject\r\nwas in accordance with popular taste; its descriptions were heavily\r\nornamented and conventional; but it contained individual lines and\r\nexpressions of great beauty. Already the hand of Shakespeare was\r\napparent. _The Rape of Lucrece_ (1594), in rhyme royal stanzas, is of\r\nless merit. As was common in the poetry of that day, the action was\r\nretarded with long speeches, but there were Shakespearian touches all\r\nthrough. In 1599 a collection of verse called _The Passionate Pilgrim_\r\nappeared with Shakespeare’s name on the title-page. Of the constituent\r\npoems only one, taking its name from the title of the book, has been\r\ndecidedly fixed as Shakespeare’s. It consists of some sonnets of\r\nunequal merit.\r\n\r\nIn 1609 a collection of Shakespeare’s sonnets was printed by Thomas\r\nThorpe, who dedicated the volume to a certain “Mr. W. H.” as being\r\n“the onlie begetter” of the sonnets. Speculation has exhausted itself\r\nregarding the identity of “Mr. W. H.” The most probable explanation is\r\nthat he was William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke. The sonnets themselves\r\nconsist of 154 numbers, which are all composed in the English form of\r\nthe sonnet, that of three quatrains clenched with a couplet. The entire\r\ncollection falls into two groups of unequal size, divided, at number\r\ncxxvi, by a poem of six couplets. The first group consists largely\r\nof a series of cryptic references, often passionately expressed, to\r\nhis friendship with a youth, apparently of high rank, who may be,\r\nand probably is, the mysterious “Mr. W. H.” The second group, also\r\nobscurely phrased, is taken up with reproaches addressed to his\r\nmistress, “a black beauty,” whose hair is like “black wires.” The\r\nidentity of this “Dark Lady of the Sonnets” is one of the romances of\r\nour literature. She may be, as is often asserted, Mary Fitton, who\r\nhappened to be fair; but she probably did not exist at all. Among the\r\nnumerous sonneteers of the time it was a common trick to apostrophize\r\na lovely and fickle mistress, as a rule quite imaginary, and it may be\r\nthat Shakespeare was following the custom of the period.\r\n\r\nConcerning the literary quality of the sonnets there can be no\r\ndispute. In the depth, breadth, and persistency of their passion,\r\nin their lordly but never overweening splendor of style, and, above\r\nall, in their mastery of a rich and sensuous phraseology, they are\r\nunique. Byron once remarked that the tissue of poetry cannot be all\r\nbrilliance, any more than the midnight sky can be entirely stars; but\r\nseveral of the sonnets (for example, xxx, xxxiii, lv, lxxi, cxvi) are\r\nthick clusters of starlight; and all through the series the frequency\r\nof lovely phrasing is great indeed. We quote one sonnet that is\r\nnearly perfect; the second that we give, after a splendid opening,\r\ndeteriorates toward the conclusion.\r\n\r\n    (1) Let me not to the marriage of true minds\r\n        Admit impediments. Love is not love\r\n        Which alters when it alteration finds,\r\n        Or bends with the remover to remove:\r\n        O, no! it is an ever-fixed mark,\r\n        That looks on tempests and is never shaken;\r\n        It is a star to every wandering bark,\r\n        Whose worth’s unknown, although his height be taken.\r\n        Love’s not Time’s fool, though rosy lips and cheeks\r\n        Within his bending sickle’s compass come;\r\n        Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,\r\n        But bears it out even to the edge of doom.\r\n          If this be error, and upon me proved,\r\n          I never writ, nor no man ever loved.\r\n                                               _Sonnet cxvi_\r\n\r\n    (2) When in the chronicle of wasted time\r\n        I see descriptions of the fairest wights,\r\n        And beauty making beautiful old rime,\r\n        In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,\r\n        Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty’s best,\r\n        Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,\r\n        I see their antique pen would have expressed\r\n        Even such a beauty as you master now.\r\n        So all their praises are but prophecies\r\n        Of this our time, all you prefiguring;\r\n        And, for they looked but with divining eyes,\r\n        They had not skill enough your worth to sing:\r\n          For we, which now behold these present days,\r\n          Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.\r\n                                                _Sonnet cvi_\r\n\r\nShakespeare’s later poetical work is worthily represented in the\r\nnumerous lyrics that are scattered through the plays. It is not quite\r\ncertain how much of the songs is original; it is almost certain that\r\nShakespeare, like Burns, used popular songs as the basis of many of\r\nhis lyrics. As they stand, however, the lyrics show a great range of\r\naccomplishment, most of it of the highest quality. It varies from the\r\nnonsense-verses in _Hamlet_ and _King Lear_ to the graceful\r\nperfection of Ariel’s “Full fathom five”; from the homely rusticity\r\nof “It was a lover and his lass” to the scholarly ease and wry humor\r\nof “O mistress mine”; it includes such gems as the willow-song in\r\n_Othello_, “Take, O take those lips away,” in _Measure for\r\nMeasure_, and the noble dirge, “Fear no more the heat o’ the\r\nsun,” in _Cymbeline_. If Shakespeare had not been our greatest\r\ndramatist, he would have taken a place among our greatest lyrical poets.\r\n\r\n=3. His Plays.= Concerning the plays that are usually accepted\r\nas being Shakespeare’s, almost endless discussion has arisen. In the\r\nfollowing pages we shall indicate the main lines of Shakesperian\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\n(_a_) THE ORDER OF THE PLAYS. All the manuscripts of the plays have\r\nperished; Shakespeare himself printed none of the texts; and though\r\neighteen of them appeared singly in quarto form during his lifetime,\r\nthey were all unauthorized editions. It was not till 1623, seven\r\nyears after his death, that the First Folio edition was printed. It\r\ncontained thirty-six dramas (_Pericles_ was omitted), and these are now\r\nuniversally accepted as Shakespeare’s. In the Folio edition the plays\r\nare not arranged chronologically, nor are the dates of composition\r\ngiven. The dates of the separate Quartos are registered at Stationers’\r\nHall, but these are the dates of the printing. With such scanty\r\nevidence to hand to assign the order of the plays, a task fundamental\r\nto all discussion of the dramas, much ingenious deductive work has been\r\nnecessary. The evidence can be divided into three groups.\r\n\r\n(1) _Contemporary References._ With one important exception, such\r\nare of little value. The exception occurs in a book by Francis Meres\r\n(1565–1647), an Elizabethan schoolmaster. In _Palladis Tamia, Wit’s\r\nTreasury_ (1598) he gives a list of contemporary authors, among whom is\r\nShakespeare. Meres mentions twelve of Shakespeare’s plays, along with\r\n“his _Venus and Adonis_, his _Lucrece_, and his sugred sonnets among\r\nhis private friends.” This valuable reference supplies us with a list\r\nof plays which were written before 1598.\r\n\r\n(2) _Internal References._ In the course of the plays there occur\r\npassages, more or less obscure, that can be traced to contemporary\r\nevents. Such are the references to “the imperial votaress” (perhaps\r\nElizabeth) in _A Midsummer Night’s Dream_, to “the two-fold balls\r\nand treble sceptres” (perhaps the Union of 1603) in _Macbeth_, and\r\nto a famous eclipse of the moon in the _Sonnets_. Owing to the\r\ninvariable obscurity of the passages, this class of evidence should be\r\nused cautiously, but unfortunately it has been made the basis of much\r\nwild theorizing.\r\n\r\n(3) _The Literary Evidence._ Soberly examined, and taken strictly\r\nin conjunction with the statement of Meres and the dates of the Quartos\r\n(when these are available), this type of evidence is by far the most\r\nreliable. We can examine the workmanship of the plays, paying attention\r\nto the construction of the plots, the force and originality of the\r\ncharacters, the standard of style, the metrical dexterity--in short,\r\nthe general level of competence. In a general survey of the dramas\r\nno great skill is necessary on the part of the reader to observe a\r\ndistinct variation in craftsmanship. By grading the plays according to\r\ntheir literary development a certain rough approximation of date can be\r\ndeduced.\r\n\r\n(_b_) THE DATES OF THE PLAYS. The following table, which\r\nto a large extent is the outcome of generations of discussion and\r\ncontention, represents a moderate or average estimate of the dates\r\nof the plays. It can be only an approximate estimate, for no exact\r\ndecision can ever be possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n        1590\r\n\r\n    1 _Henry VI_\r\n\r\n\r\n        1591–2\r\n\r\n    2 _Henry VI_\r\n    3 _Henry VI_\r\n\r\n\r\n        1593\r\n\r\n    _Richard III_\r\n    _Edward III_ (in part)\r\n    _The Comedy of Errors_\r\n\r\n\r\n        1594\r\n\r\n    _Titus Andronicus_\r\n    _The Taming of the Shrew_\r\n    _Love’s Labour’s Lost_\r\n    _Romeo and Juliet_\r\n\r\n\r\n        1595\r\n\r\n    _A Midsummer Night’s Dream_\r\n    _The Two Gentlemen of Verona_\r\n    _King John_\r\n\r\n\r\n        1596\r\n\r\n    _Richard II_\r\n    _The Merchant of Venice_\r\n\r\n\r\n        1597\r\n\r\n    1 _Henry IV_\r\n\r\n\r\n        1598\r\n\r\n    2 _Henry IV_\r\n    _Much Ado about Nothing_\r\n\r\n\r\n        1599\r\n\r\n    _Henry V_\r\n    _Julius Cæsar_\r\n\r\n\r\n        1600\r\n\r\n    _The Merry Wives of Windsor_\r\n    _As You Like It_\r\n\r\n\r\n        1601\r\n\r\n    _Hamlet_\r\n    _Twelfth Night_\r\n\r\n\r\n        1602\r\n\r\n    _Troilus and Cressida_\r\n    _All’s Well that Ends Well_\r\n\r\n\r\n        1603\r\n\r\n    (Theaters closed)\r\n\r\n\r\n        1604\r\n\r\n    _Measure for Measure_\r\n    _Othello_\r\n\r\n\r\n        1605\r\n\r\n    _Macbeth_\r\n    _King Lear_\r\n\r\n\r\n        1606\r\n\r\n    _Antony and Cleopatra_\r\n    _Coriolanus_\r\n\r\n\r\n        1607\r\n\r\n    _Timon of Athens_ (unfinished)\r\n\r\n\r\n        1608\r\n\r\n    _Pericles_ (in part)\r\n\r\n\r\n        1609\r\n\r\n    _Cymbeline_\r\n\r\n\r\n        1610\r\n\r\n    _The Winter’s Tale_\r\n\r\n\r\n        1611\r\n\r\n    _The Tempest_\r\n\r\n\r\n        1613\r\n\r\n    _The Two Noble Kinsmen_ (in part)\r\n    _Henry VIII_ (in part)\r\n\r\n(_c_) CLASSIFICATION OF THE PLAYS. It is customary to group the plays\r\ninto sets that to some extent traverse the order given above.\r\n\r\n(1) _The Early Comedies._ In these plays there is a certain amount of\r\nimmaturity: the plots show less originality; the characters are less\r\nfinished; the power of the style is less sustained; the humor is often\r\npuerile and quibbling; and there is a large amount of prose. Of this\r\ntype are _The Comedy of Errors_, _Love’s Labour’s Lost_, and _The Two\r\nGentlemen of Verona_.\r\n\r\n(2) _The Histories._ These show an advance, particularly in style.\r\nThere is more blank verse, which, though it is often stiffly imitative\r\nof the older playwrights, abounds in splendid passages. The appearance\r\nof such characters as Falstaff in _Henry IV_ and other plays is a sign\r\nof growing strength.\r\n\r\n(3) _The Tragedies._ The great tragedies, such as _Hamlet_, _Macbeth_,\r\nand _King Lear_, are the climax of Shakespearian art. They reveal the\r\nbest of his characterization and the full power of his style.\r\n\r\n(4) _The Later Comedies._ A mellowed maturity is the chief feature of\r\nthis group, which contains _Cymbeline_, _The Winter’s Tale_, and _The\r\nTempest_. The creative touch of the dramatist, making living men out\r\nof figment, is abundantly in view; the style is notable and serenely\r\nadequate; and with the ease of the master the author thoroughly subdues\r\nthe meter to his will. No more fitting conclusion--rich, ample, and\r\ngraciously dignified--could be found to round off the work of our\r\ngreatest literary genius.\r\n\r\n=4. His Prose.= Shakespeare’s prose appears all through the plays,\r\nsometimes in passages of considerable length. In the aggregate\r\nthe amount is quite large. In the earlier comedies the amount is\r\nconsiderable, but the proportion is apt to diminish in the later\r\nplays. With regard to the prose, the following points should be\r\nobserved: (_a_) it is the common vehicle for comic scenes, though\r\nused too in serious passages (one of which is given below); (_b_) it\r\nrepresents the common speech of the period, and some of it, as can be\r\nseen in _Hamlet_, is pithy and bracing. Even the rather stupid clowning\r\nthat often takes place cannot altogether conceal its beauty.\r\n\r\nWe quote a passage from _Hamlet_. The style is quite modern in phrase,\r\nand the beauty and grace of it are far beyond the ordinary standard of\r\nShakespeare’s literary contemporaries.\r\n\r\n   I have of late--but wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth,\r\n   forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily\r\n   with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to\r\n   me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the air,\r\n   look you, this brave o’erhanging firmament, this majestical roof\r\n   fretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to me\r\n   but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece\r\n   of work is man! How noble in reason! how infinite in faculty!\r\n   in form, in moving, how express and admirable! in action how\r\n   like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of\r\n   the world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what is this\r\n   quintessence of dust?\r\n                                                         _Hamlet_\r\n\r\n\r\n=5. Features of his Plays.= The extent, variety, and richness of the\r\nplays are quite bewildering as one approaches them. All that can be\r\ndone here is to set down in order some of the more obvious of their\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Their Originality._ In the narrowest sense of the term,\r\nShakespeare took no trouble to be original. Following the custom of\r\nthe time, he borrowed freely from older plays (such as _King Leir_),\r\nchronicles (such as Holinshed’s), and tales (such as _The Jew_, the\r\npart-origin of _The Merchant of Venice_). To these he is indebted\r\nchiefly for his plots; but in his more mature work the interest in the\r\nplot becomes subordinate to the development of character, the highest\r\nachievement of the dramatist’s art. He can work his originals deftly:\r\nhe can interweave plot within plot, as in _A Midsummer Night’s Dream_;\r\nhe can solidify years of history into five acts, as in _King John_ and\r\n_Antony and Cleopatra_; and, as in _Macbeth_, he makes the dust of\r\nhistory glow with the spirit of his imagination.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Characters._ (1) In sheer _prodigality of output_ Shakespeare\r\nis unrivaled in literature. From king to clown, from lunatic and\r\ndemi-devil to saint and seer, from lover to misanthrope--all are\r\nrevealed with the hand of the master. Surveying this multitude, one can\r\nonly cry out, as Hamlet does, “What a piece of work is man!”\r\n\r\n(2) Another feature of Shakespeare’s characterization is his attitude\r\nof _impartiality_. He seems indifferent to good and evil; he has the\r\neye of the creator, viewing bright and dismal things alike, provided\r\nthey are apt and real. In his characters vice and virtue commingle, and\r\nthe union is true to the common sense of humanity. Thus the villain\r\nIago is a man of resolution, intelligence, and fortitude; the murderer\r\nClaudius (in _Hamlet_) shows affection, wisdom, and fortitude; the\r\npeerless Cleopatra is narrow, spiteful, and avaricious; and the beast\r\nCaliban has his moments of ecstatic vision. The list could be extended\r\nalmost without limit, but these examples must serve.\r\n\r\n(3) Hence follows the _vital force_ that resides in the creations of\r\nShakespeare. They live, move, and utter speech; they are rounded,\r\nentire, and capable. Very seldom, and that almost entirely in the\r\nearlier plays, he uses the wooden puppets that are the stock-in-trade\r\nof the inferior dramatist. Of such a kind are some of his “heavy”\r\nfathers, like Egeus (in _A Midsummer Night’s Dream_), and his\r\nsentimental lovers, like Orsino (in _Twelfth Night_). Yet, as a rule,\r\nin the hands of Shakespeare the heavy father can develop into such\r\nliving beings as the meddlesome old bore Polonius (in _Hamlet_), and\r\nthe tediously sentimental lover can become the moody and headstrong\r\nRomeo, or the virile and drolly humorous Orlando (in _As You Like It_).\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Meter._ As in all the other features of his work, in meter\r\nShakespeare shows abnormal range and power. In the earlier plays the\r\nblank verse is regular in beat and pause; there is a fondness for the\r\nstopped and rhymed couplet; and in a few cases the couplet passes\r\ninto definite stanza-formation in a manner suggestive of the early\r\npre-Shakespearian comedies.\r\n\r\n    _Lysander._   Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?\r\n                Scorn and derision never come in tears:\r\n              Look, when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,\r\n                In their nativity all truth appears.\r\n              How can these things in me seem scorn to you,\r\n              Bearing the badge of faith to prove them true?\r\n                                        _A Midsummer Night’s Dream_\r\n\r\nAs Shakespeare becomes more sure of his instrument the verse increases\r\nin ease and dexterity; the cadence is varied; the pause is shifted\r\nto any position in the line. In the later plays there is an especial\r\nfondness for the extra syllable at the end of the line. And before he\r\nfinishes he has utterly subdued the meter to his will. In the last line\r\nof the extract now given every foot is abnormal:\r\n\r\n    _Lear._ And my poor fool is hanged! No, no, no life!\r\n          Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,\r\n          And thou no breath at all? Thou’lt come no more,\r\n          Never, never, never, never, never!\r\n                                                  _King Lear_\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Style._ For lack of a better name we call Shakespeare’s style\r\nShakesperian. One can instantly recognize it, even in other authors,\r\nwhere it is rarely visible. It is a difficult, almost an impossible,\r\nmatter to define it. There is aptness and quotability in it: sheaves\r\nof Shakespeare’s expressions have passed into common speech. To a very\r\nhigh degree it possesses sweetness, strength, and flexibility; and\r\nabove all it has a certain inevitable and final felicity that is the\r\ntrue mark of genius.\r\n\r\nThe following specimen shows the average Shakespearian style, if such a\r\nthing exists at all. It is not extremely elevated or poetical, but it\r\nis strong, precise, and individual.\r\n\r\n\r\n    If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,\r\n    Absent thee from felicity awhile,\r\n    And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,\r\n    To tell my story.\r\n                                               _Hamlet_\r\n\r\nSuch a style moves easily into the highest flights of poetry:\r\n\r\n    (1) That strain again! it had a dying fall:\r\n        O! it came o’er my ear like the sweet sound\r\n        That breathes upon a bank of violets,\r\n        Stealing and giving odour.\r\n                                          _Twelfth Night_\r\n\r\n    (2) _Cleopatra._        Come, thou mortal wretch,\r\n\r\n                   [_To the asp, which she applies to her breast._\r\n\r\n        With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate\r\n        Of life at once untie; poor venomous fool,\r\n        Be angry, and despatch....\r\n\r\n    _Charmian._                    O eastern star!\r\n\r\n    _Cleopatra._                                   Peace, peace!\r\n        Dost thou not see my baby at my breast,\r\n        That sucks the nurse asleep?\r\n                                             _Antony and Cleopatra_\r\n\r\nOr it can plumb the depths of terror and despair. The following are the\r\nwords of a condemned wretch shivering on the brink of extinction:\r\n\r\n    Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;\r\n    To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;\r\n    This sensible warm motion to become\r\n    A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit\r\n    To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside\r\n    In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;\r\n    To be imprisoned in the viewless winds,\r\n    And blown with restless violence round about\r\n    The pendant world; or to be worse than worst\r\n    Of those that lawless and incertain thoughts\r\n    Imagine howling: ’tis too horrible!\r\n                                        _Measure for Measure_\r\n\r\nThe style lends itself to the serenely ecstatic reverie of the sage:\r\n\r\n    Our revels now are ended. These our actors,\r\n    As I foretold you, were all spirits and\r\n    Are melted into air, into thin air:\r\n    And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,\r\n    The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces,\r\n    The solemn temples, the great globe itself,\r\n    Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,\r\n    And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,\r\n    Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff\r\n    As dreams are made on, and our little life\r\n    Is rounded with a sleep.\r\n                                          _The Tempest_\r\n\r\nIt can express, on the other hand, the bitterest cynicism:\r\n\r\n                            But, man, proud man,\r\n    Drest in a little brief authority,\r\n    Most ignorant of what he’s most assured,\r\n    His glassy essence, like an angry ape,\r\n    Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven\r\n    As make the angels weep.\r\n                                   _Measure for Measure_\r\n\r\nOr, in prose, Shakespeare can put into words the artless pathos of the\r\nhumble hostess of the inn:\r\n\r\n   _Hostess._ Nay, sure, he’s not in hell: he’s in Arthur’s\r\n   bosom, if ever man went to Arthur’s bosom. A’ made a finer end\r\n   and went away an it had been any christom child; a’ parted even\r\n   just between twelve and one, even at the turning o’ the tide;\r\n   for after I saw him fumble with the sheets and play with flowers\r\n   and smile upon his fingers’ ends, I knew that there was but one\r\n   way; for his nose was as sharp as a pen, and a’ babbled of green\r\n   fields. “How now, Sir John?” quoth I: “what, man! be of good\r\n   cheer.” So a’ cried out “God, God, God!” three or four times.\r\n                                                                  _Henry V_\r\n\r\n\r\nShakespeare can rant, and often rants badly; but at its best his\r\nranting glows with such imaginative splendor that it becomes a thing of\r\nfire and majesty:\r\n\r\n    His legs bestrid the ocean; his reared arm\r\n    Crested the world; his voice was propertied\r\n    As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;\r\n    But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,\r\n    He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,\r\n    There was no winter in’t, an autumn ’twas\r\n    That grew the more by reaping; his delights\r\n    Were dolphin-like, they showed his back above\r\n    The element they lived in; in his livery\r\n    Walked crowns and crownets, realms and islands were\r\n    As plates dropped from his pocket.\r\n                                        _Antony and Cleopatra_\r\n\r\nWith such a style as this Shakespeare can compass the world of human\r\nemotion, and he does so.\r\n\r\n=6. Summary.= “He was the man,” said Dryden, “who of all modern, and\r\nperhaps ancient poets, had the largest and most comprehensive soul.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPOST-SHAKESPEARIAN DRAMA\r\n\r\nIn the following section it will be found that, although much of the\r\nwork was composed during Shakespeare’s lifetime, the most typical of\r\nthe plays appeared after his death. On the whole, moreover, the work\r\nmarks a decline from the Shakespearian standard, and so we are probably\r\njustified in calling this type of drama post-Shakespearian.\r\n\r\n=1. Ben Jonson (1573–1637)= was born at Westminster, and educated\r\nat Westminster School. His father died before Jonson’s birth, and the\r\nboy adopted the trade of his stepfather, who was a master bricklayer.\r\nBricklaying did not satisfy him for long, and he became a soldier,\r\nserving in the Low Countries. From this he turned to acting and writing\r\nplays, engaging himself, both as actor and playwright, with the Lord\r\nAdmiral’s company (1597). At first he had little success, and the\r\ndiscouragement he encountered then must have done much to sour a temper\r\nthat was not at any time very genial. In his combative fashion he took\r\npart freely in the squabbles of the time, and in 1598 he killed a\r\nfellow-actor in a duel, narrowly escaping the gallows. On the accession\r\nof James I in 1603 there arose a new fashion for picturesque pageants\r\nknown as masques, and Jonson turned his energies to supplying this\r\ndemand, with great success. After this period (160315) he commanded\r\ngreat good-fortune, and during this time his best work was produced. In\r\n1617 he was created poet to the King, and the close of James’s reign\r\nsaw Jonson the undisputed ruler of English literature. His favorite\r\nhaunt was the Mermaid Tavern, where he reigned as dictator over a\r\nyounger literary generation. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, and\r\nover him was placed the epitaph “O rare Ben Jonson!”\r\n\r\nJonson’s works, extremely voluminous and of varying merit, can be\r\nclassified for convenience into comedies, tragedies, masques, and\r\nlyrics. His one considerable prose work, a kind of commonplace book, to\r\nwhich he gave the curious name of _Timber_, is of much interest, but\r\ndoes not affect his general position.\r\n\r\nHe began with the comedy _Every Man in his Humour_, which was written\r\nin 1598; then followed _Every Man out of His Humour_ (1599), _Cynthia’s\r\nRevels_ (1600), and _The Poetaster_ (1601). These earliest comedies\r\nare rather tedious in their characters, for they emphasize unduly\r\nthe “humor” or peculiar characteristic of each individual. They are,\r\nhowever, ingenious in plot, rich in rugged and not entirely displeasing\r\nfun, and full of vivacity and high spirits. The later group of comedies\r\nshows a decided advance. The characters are less angular, livelier,\r\nand much more convincing; the style is more matured and equable. Such\r\ncomedies, perhaps the best of all Jonson’s dramatic work, are _Volpone,\r\nor The Fox_ (1605), _Epicene, or The Silent Woman_ (1609), and _The\r\nAlchemist_ (1610). His last comedies are lighter and more farcical, and\r\nshow less care and forethought. They include _Bartholomew Fair_ (1614),\r\n_The Devil Is an Ass_ (1616), and _The Staple of News_ (1625). His last\r\nunfinished play, _The Sad Shepherd_, a pastoral comedy, is unapproached\r\namong his dramas for its combination of sober reflection, lightness\r\nof fancy, and delicacy of touch. In nearly all his comedies Jonson\r\nopened up a vein that was nearly new and was to be very freely worked\r\nby his successors--the comedy of London life and humors, reflecting the\r\nmanners of the day.\r\n\r\nHis two historical tragedies, _Sejanus his Fall_ (1603) and _Catiline\r\nhis Conspiracy_ (1611), are too labored and mechanical to be reckoned\r\nas great tragedies, though their author would fain have had them so.\r\nThey show immense learning, they have power, variety, and insight, but\r\nthey lack the last creative touch necessary to stamp them with reality,\r\nand to give them a living appeal.\r\n\r\nAs for his masques, they are abundant, graceful, and humorously\r\ningenious. Into them Jonson introduced the device of the anti-masque,\r\nwhich parodied the principal theme. The best of them are _The Masque of\r\nBeauty_ (1608), _The Masque of Queens_ (1609), and _Oberon, the Fairy\r\nPrince_ (1611).\r\n\r\nThe lyrics, which are freely introduced into his plays, and the\r\nelegies, epitaphs, and other occasional pieces, many of which appeared\r\nin a volume called _Underwoods_ (“consisting of divers poems”),\r\nrepresent Jonson’s work in its sweetest and most graceful phase. His\r\nsong, a translation from Philostratus, beginning “Drink to me only with\r\nthine eyes,” is deservedly famous. We cannot resist quoting two brief\r\nbut typical pieces:\r\n\r\n    (1) Have you seen but a bright lillie grow,\r\n          Before rude hands have touch’d it?\r\n        Have you mark’d but the fall of the snow\r\n          Before the soyle hath smutch’d it?\r\n        Have you felt the wooll of the bever?\r\n                  Or swan’s downe ever?\r\n        Or have smelt of the bud of the brier?\r\n                  Or the nard on the fire?\r\n        Or have tasted the bag of the bee?\r\n        O so white! O so soft! O so sweet is she!\r\n                                          _The Triumph_\r\n\r\n    (2) Underneath this sable hearse\r\n        Lies the subject of all verse,\r\n        Sidney’s sister, Pembroke’s mother:\r\n        Death, ere thou hast slain another,\r\n        Learned, and fair, and good as she,\r\n        Time shall throw a dart at thee!\r\n                      _Epitaph on the Countess of Pembroke_[99]\r\n\r\nIn the estimation of his own age Jonson stood second to none; to\r\na later generation he is overshadowed by the towering bulk of\r\nShakespeare. But even the enormous prestige of Shakespeare cannot or\r\nought not to belittle the merits of Jonson. Of Jonson we can justly\r\nsay that he had all good literary gifts except one, and that the\r\nhighest and most baffling of all--true genius. He had learning--perhaps\r\ntoo much of it; industry and constancy well beyond the ordinary;\r\nversatility; a crabbed and not unamiable humor, diversified with\r\nsweetness, grace, and nimbleness of wit; and a style quite adequate to\r\nhis needs. But the summit of it all--the magical phrase that catches\r\nthe breath, the immortal spirit that creates out of words and buckram\r\n“forms more real than living man”--these were lacking; and without\r\nthese he cannot join the circle of the very great.\r\n\r\n=2. Francis Beaumont (1584–1616)= and =John Fletcher (1575–1625)=\r\ncombined to produce a great number of plays, said to be fifty-two in\r\nall. How much of the joint work is to be assigned to the respective\r\nhands is not accurately known.\r\n\r\nThe elder, Fletcher, was a cousin of Giles and Phineas Fletcher (see\r\n(p. 101), and was born at Rye, Sussex. He was educated at Cambridge,\r\nand lived the life of a London literary man. He died of the plague\r\nin 1625. His colleague Beaumont, who was probably the abler of the\r\ntwo, was the son of a judge, Sir Francis Beaumont, was educated at\r\nOxford, and entered the Inner Temple (1600), but was captivated by\r\nthe attractions of a literary life. He died almost within a month of\r\nShakespeare, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nThey excelled in comedy, especially in the comedy of London life.\r\nTheirs is not the heavy “humorous” comedy of Jonson, but is lighter\r\nand more romantic. Their characters are slighter, but more pleasing\r\nand human; their humor is free and genial, and their representation of\r\ncontemporary life is happy and attractive. Their plots are ingenious\r\nand workmanlike, and their incidents numerous and striking. Their\r\nstyle shows a distinct decline from the high standard of Shakespeare.\r\nThey have a greater fondness for prose, their blank verse is looser and\r\nweaker, but they are capable of poetical lines and phrases. Typical\r\ncomedies are _A King and No King_ (1611), esteemed by Dryden the\r\nbest of them all, _The Knight of the Burning Pestle_ (1611), a very\r\nagreeable farce, and _The Scornful Lady_ (1616). Their tragedies, such\r\nas _The Maid’s Tragedy_ (1619), _Philaster_ (1620), suggesting _Twelfth\r\nNight_, and _The Faithful Shepherdess_ (by Fletcher alone), are not\r\ntoo tragical, and they are diversified by attractive incidents and\r\ndescriptions.\r\n\r\n=3. George Chapman (1559–1634)= was born at Hitchin. Beyond this\r\nfact little is known of him. He took part in the literary life of his\r\ntime, for his name appears in the squabbles of his tribe. He died in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nHis first play, _The Blind Beggar of Alexandria_ (1596) was followed by\r\nmany more, both comical and tragical. Among them are _Bussy d’Ambois_\r\n(1597), _Charles, Duke of Byron_ (1608), and _The Tragedie of Chabot_\r\n(1639). These are historical plays, dealing with events nearly\r\ncontemporary with his own time. Chapman’s comedies include _All Fools_\r\n(1605) and _Eastward Hoe!_ (1605), in the latter of which he combined\r\nwith Jonson and Marston. Chapman writes agreeably and well; he has\r\nfirmness, competence, and variety, and his comic and tragic powers are\r\nconsiderable. His translation of _Homer_ has something of the pace and\r\nmusic of the original.\r\n\r\n=4. John Marston (1575–1634)= was born at Coventry, was educated\r\nthere and at Oxford, became a literary figure in London, and later\r\ntook orders. Latterly he resigned his living in Hampshire, and died in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nMarston specialized in violent and melodramatic tragedies, which do not\r\nlack a certain impressiveness, but which are easily parodied and no\r\nless easily lead to abuse. They impressed his own generation, who rated\r\nhim with Jonson. For a later age they are spoiled to a great extent\r\nby exaggeration, rant, and excessive speeches. Typical of them are\r\n_Antonio and Mellida_ (1602) and _Antonio’s Revenge_ (1602), which were\r\nridiculed by Jonson in _The Poetaster_.\r\n\r\n=5. Thomas Dekker (1570–1641)= was born in London, where his life was\r\npassed as a literary hack and playwright. His plays, chiefly comedies,\r\nhave an attraction quite unusual for the time. They have a sweetness,\r\nan arch sentimentality, and an intimate knowledge of common men and\r\nthings that have led to his being called the Dickens of the Elizabethan\r\nstage. His plots are chaotic, and his blank verse, which very\r\nfrequently gives place to prose, is weak and sprawling. The best of his\r\nplays are _Old Fortunatus_ (1600), _The Shoemaker’s Holiday_ (1600),\r\nand _Satiromastix_ (1602). He collaborated with other playwrights,\r\nincluding Ford and Rowley, with whom he wrote _The Witch of Edmonton_\r\n(about 1633), and Massinger, in _The Virgin Martyr_ (1622).\r\n\r\n=6. Thomas Middleton (1570–1627)= was born in London, wrote much for\r\nthe stage, and in 1620 was made City Chronologer.\r\n\r\nHe is one of the most equable and literary of the dramatists of the\r\nage; he has a decided fanciful turn; he is a close observer and critic\r\nof the life of the time, and a dramatist who on a few occasions can\r\nrise to the heights of greatness. His most powerful play, which has\r\nbeen much praised by Lamb and others, is _The Changeling_ (1624);\r\nothers are _Women beware Women_ (1622), _The Witch_, which bears a\r\nstrong resemblance to _Macbeth_, and _The Spanish Gipsy_ (1623), a\r\nromantic comedy suggesting _As You Like It_. Along with Dekker he wrote\r\n_The Roaring Girle, or Moll Cutpurse_ (1611), which is a close dramatic\r\nparallel to the earliest novels.\r\n\r\n=7. Thomas Heywood (1575–1650)= was born in Lincolnshire about 1575,\r\nwas educated at Cambridge, and became an author and dramatist in\r\nLondon. He himself asserts that he had a hand (“or at least a main\r\nfinger”) in two hundred and twenty plays, of which twenty-three survive.\r\n\r\nLike so many more dramatists of the time, he excelled in his pictures\r\nof London life and manners. He was a rapid and light improviser,\r\nan expert contriver of stage situations, but otherwise content with\r\npassable results, and caring little about the higher flights of the\r\ndramatist. His best play is _A Woman Killed with Kindnesse_ (1603),\r\nwhich contains some strongly pathetic scenes; _The English Traveller_\r\n(1633) is only slightly inferior. Other plays of his are _The Royall\r\nKing_ (1600), _The Captives_ (1624), and a series of clumsy historical\r\ndramas, including _King Edward the Fourth_ (1600) and _The Troubles of\r\nQueene Elizabeth_ (1605).\r\n\r\n=8. John Webster=, who flourished during the first twenty years of the\r\nseventeenth century, excels his fellows as a tragical artist. Next to\r\nnothing is known regarding his life, and much of his work has been\r\nlost, but what remains is sufficient to show that he was a writer of no\r\nmean ability. Selecting themes of gloomy and supernatural horror, of\r\ngreat crimes and turbulent emotions and desires, he rises to the height\r\nof his argument with an ability equal to his ambition. In several\r\nrespects--in bleak horror and in largeness of tragical conception--he\r\nresembles Marlowe; but he is terse and precise when Marlowe is simply\r\nturgid; his plots have the inexorable march of Fate itself; and he\r\nfar excels Marlowe in brief and almost blinding flashes of sorrow and\r\npity. His two great plays are _The White Devil_ (1612) and _The Duchess\r\nof Malfy_ (1623). Other and inferior plays ascribed to him are _The\r\nDevil’s Law Case_ (1623) and _Appius and Virginia_.\r\n\r\n=9. Cyril Tourneur= (1575–1626) seems to have been a soldier and\r\nto have served in the Low Countries. He took part in Buckingham’s\r\ndisastrous expedition to Cadiz, and on his return died in Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn the work of Tourneur we have horrors piled on horrors. His two plays\r\n_The Revenger’s Tragedy_ (1600) and _The Atheist’s Tragedy_ (1611) are\r\nmelodramatic to the highest degree. He attempts much, but achieves\r\nlittle. He does not lack a certain poetic sensibility; but he lacks\r\ngrip, method, and balance, and he is weakest where Webster is strongest.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ENGLISH BIBLE: THE AUTHORIZED VERSION\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter we indicated the growth of the Bible from the\r\nearliest to Reformation times. The task of translation was completed by\r\nthe issue of _King James’s Bible_, or the _Authorized Version_ (1611).\r\n\r\nThe need for a standard text was urged during the conference between\r\nthe dissentient sects held at Hampton Court in 1604. James I, who was\r\npresent at some stages of the conference, approved of the project.\r\nForty-seven scholars, including the ablest professorial and episcopal\r\ntalent, were appointed for the task; they were divided into six\r\ncompanies, each receiving a certain portion of the Biblical text for\r\ntranslation; each company revised the work of its fellow-translators.\r\nThe task, begun in 1607, was completed in 1611. Since that date little\r\nof sufficient authority has been done to shake the Authorized Version’s\r\ndominating position as the greatest of English translations.\r\n\r\nIt may be of use here to set down some of the more obvious features of\r\nthis great work.\r\n\r\n=1.= With regard to the actual work of =translation=, it ought to be\r\nregarded simply as the climax of a long series of earlier translations.\r\nThe new translators came to handle a large mass of work already in\r\nexistence. All the debatable ground in the texts had been fought\r\nover again and again, and in a dim fashion a standard was emerging.\r\nThe translators themselves acknowledge this in the preface to their\r\nwork: their task, they say, is “to make a good one better, or out of\r\nmany good ones one principal good one.” In other words, their task\r\nwas largely one of selection and amendment. The reliance upon earlier\r\nwork resulted in a certain old-fashioned flavor that was felt even in\r\nJacobean times. “It is not the English,” says Hallam, “of Daniel or\r\nRalegh or Bacon.... It abounds, especially in the Old Testament, in\r\nobsolete phraseology.” It is a tribute to the compelling power and\r\nbeauty of the Authorized Version that its archaisms have long been\r\naccepted as permissible, and even inevitable. Allowing, however, for\r\nall the reliance upon earlier work, one cannot overpraise the sound\r\njudgment, the artistic taste, and the sensitive ear of every member of\r\nthe band who built up such a stately monument to our tongue.\r\n\r\n=2. Diversity of the Work.= One can best appreciate the vastness\r\nand complexity of the Bible by recollecting that it is not a single\r\nbook, but an entire literature, or even two literatures, for both\r\nin time and temper the New Testament is separated from the Old.\r\nThe different books of the Bible were composed at widely different\r\ntimes, and many hands worked at them. Their efforts resulted in a\r\nhuge collection of all the main species of literature--expository,\r\nnarrative, and lyrical. These will be noticed in their order below.\r\n\r\n=3. Unity of the Work.= If the Bible were a collection of discordant\r\nelements it would not possess its peculiar literary attraction. In\r\nspite of the diversity of its sources it has a remarkable uniformity\r\nof treatment and spirit. The core and substance of the entire work\r\nis the belief and delight in the Divine Spirit; and, added to this,\r\nespecially in the Old Testament, a fiery faith in the pre-eminence of\r\nthe Jewish race. With regard to the literary style, from cover to cover\r\nit is almost unvaried: firm, clear, simple, dignified, and thoroughly\r\nEnglish. It represents the broad and stable average of the labors of\r\ngenerations of devout and ardent men; and it endureth unshaken.\r\n\r\n=4. The Expository Portions.= Considered from the purely literary\r\npoint of view, the expository parts (that is, those that contain\r\nexhortation, information, or advice) are of least importance. In\r\nbulk they are considerable, and include the Book of Deuteronomy in\r\nthe Old Testament and the Pauline Epistles in the New. They have all\r\nthe distinction of the Biblical style, and they are expressed with\r\nclearness, dignity, and precision.\r\n\r\n=5.= The =narrative portions= include the bulk of the Bible, and\r\nare of great literary interest and value. In the Old Testament they\r\ncomprise the Pentateuch and many other books, and in the New Testament\r\nthey include the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles. The tone of\r\nthe Old Testament differs somewhat from that of the New. As can be\r\nsupposed, the former is often harsher in note, and is sometimes\r\nconfused and contradictory (from the unsatisfactory condition of some\r\nof the texts); the New Testament narrative, which came under the\r\ninfluence of the Greek, is more scholarly and liberal in tone. Both,\r\nhowever, have a breadth, solidity, and noble austerity of style that\r\nmake the Biblical narrative stand alone. It is perhaps unnecessary to\r\nquote, but one short specimen may not be out of place:\r\n\r\n   Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high\r\n   priest’s house. And Peter followed afar off.\r\n\r\n   And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and\r\n   were set down together, Peter sat down among them.\r\n\r\n   But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and\r\n   earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.\r\n\r\n   And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.\r\n\r\n   And, after a little while, another saw him, and said, Thou art\r\n   also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.\r\n\r\n   And about the space of one hour after, another confidently\r\n   affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him; for\r\n   he is a Galilean.\r\n\r\n   And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And\r\n   immediately, when he yet spake, the cock crew.\r\n\r\n   And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered\r\n   the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock\r\n   crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.\r\n\r\n   And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.\r\n                                                         _St. Luke_\r\n\r\n\r\n=6. The Lyrical Portions.= These (which include the Psalms, the\r\nSong of Solomon, much of the Book of Job, and the frequent passages,\r\nsuch as the song of Sisera, which occur in the narrative books) are\r\nperhaps the most important as literature. In addition to their native\r\nshrewdness and persistence, the Jews had a strongly emotional strain,\r\nwhich finds wide expression in the Bible. Their poetry, like that\r\nof the Old English, was rhythmic; it went by irregularly distributed\r\nbeats or accents. The English translators to a large extent preserved\r\nthe Jewish rhythms, adding to them the music, the cadence, the soar\r\nand the swing of ecstatic English prose. In theme Jewish poetry is\r\nthe primitive expression of simple people regarding the relations of\r\nman and God and the universe. Its similes and metaphors are based\r\nupon simple elemental things--the heavens, the running water, and\r\nthe congregations of wild beasts. The emotions are mystically and\r\nrapturously expressed, and convey the impression of much earnestness.\r\nThe following extract is fairly typical of its kind:\r\n\r\n   As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul\r\n   after thee, O God.\r\n\r\n   My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come\r\n   and appear before God?\r\n\r\n   My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually\r\n   say unto me, Where is thy God?\r\n\r\n   When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I\r\n   had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of\r\n   God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that\r\n   kept holyday.\r\n\r\n   Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted\r\n   in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the help\r\n   of his countenance.\r\n                                                   _The Book of Psalms_\r\n\r\n\r\n=7. The Influence of the Bible.= The English Bible has been a potent\r\ninfluence in our literature. Owing largely to their poetical or\r\nproverbial nature, multitudes of Biblical expressions have become woven\r\ninto the very tissue of the tongue: “a broken reed,” “the eleventh\r\nhour,” “a thorn in the flesh,” “a good Samaritan,” “sweat of the brow,”\r\nand so on. More important, probably, is the way in which the style\r\naffects that of many of our greatest writers. The influence is nearly\r\nall for the good; for a slight strain of the Biblical manner, when kept\r\nartistically within bounds, imparts simplicity, dignity, and elevation.\r\nBunyan shows the style almost undiluted; but in the works of such\r\nwidely diverse writers as Ruskin, Macaulay, Milton, and Tennyson the\r\neffects, though slighter, are quite apparent.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCIS BACON, BARON VERULAM, VISCOUNT ST. ALBANS (1561–1626)\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= Bacon was born in London, the son of Sir Nicholas\r\nBacon, the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal. The family was connected\r\nwith the Cecils and other political magnates of the time. Bacon was\r\na delicate youth, and for a time he was educated privately; then he\r\nproceeded to Cambridge, and thence entered Gray’s Inn (1576). To\r\ncomplete his education he spent three years in France. On his being\r\ncalled to the Bar his family influence helped him to acquire a fair\r\npractice; but Bacon was ambitious and longed for the highest rewards\r\nthat his profession could bestow. He became a member of Parliament\r\nin 1584, but the recognition that he expected from the Queen did\r\nnot come his way, hard though he fought for it. He assisted in the\r\nprosecution of the Earl of Essex, a nobleman who had befriended\r\nhim earlier in his career. Essex, an injudicious man, had involved\r\nhimself in a charge of treason, and the ingenuity of Bacon was largely\r\ninstrumental in bringing him to the block. On the accession of James\r\nI Bacon, who was never remiss in urging his own claims to preferment,\r\nbegan to experience prosperity, for he was tireless in urging the\r\nroyal claims before Parliament. He was made a knight in 1603, and\r\nAttorney-General in 1613. In the latter capacity he was James’s chief\r\nagent in asserting and enforcing the King’s theories of divine right,\r\nand he became thoroughly unpopular with the House of Commons. His\r\nreward came in 1618, when he was appointed Lord Chancellor and created\r\nBaron Verulam, and in 1621, when he became Viscount St. Albans. Popular\r\ndissatisfaction was mounting against the King and his agents, and when\r\nParliament met in 1620 it laid charges of bribery and corrupt dealings\r\nagainst the Lord Chancellor. Bacon quailed before the storm; made what\r\namounted to a confession of guilt; and was subjected to the huge fine\r\nof £40,000 (which was partially remitted), imprisonment during the\r\nKing’s pleasure (which was restricted to four days in the Tower of\r\nLondon), and exile from Court and office. He spent the last five years\r\nof his life in the pursuit of literary and scientific works.\r\n\r\n=2. His Works.= Bacon wrote both in Latin and English, and of the\r\ntwo he considered the Latin works to be the more important.\r\n\r\n(_a_) His English works include his _Essays_, which first appeared\r\nin 1597. Then they numbered ten; but the second (1612) and third\r\n(1625) editions raised the number to thirty-eight and fifty-eight\r\nrespectively. They are on familiar subjects, such as Learning,\r\nStudies, Vainglory, and Great Place; and in method they represent\r\nthe half-casual meditations of a trained and learned mind. His other\r\nEnglish works were _The Advancement of Learning_ (1605), containing the\r\nsubstance of his philosophy; _Apophthegms_ (1625), a kind of jest-book;\r\nand _The New Atlantis_, left unfinished at his death, a philosophical\r\nromance modeled upon More’s _Utopia_.\r\n\r\n(_b_) His Latin works were to be fashioned into a vast scheme, which he\r\ncalled _Instauratio Magna_, expounding his philosophical theories. It\r\nwas laid out on the following plan, but it was scarcely half finished:\r\n\r\n   (1) _De Augmentis Scientiarum_ (1623). This treatise, in which\r\n   the English work on the _Advancement of Learning_ is embodied,\r\n   gives a general summary of human knowledge, taking special\r\n   notice of gaps and imperfections in science.\r\n\r\n   (2) _Novum Organum_ (1620). This work explains the new logic,\r\n   or inductive method of reasoning, upon which his philosophy is\r\n   founded. Out of the nine sections into which he divides the\r\n   subject the first only is handled with any fullness, the other\r\n   eight being merely named.\r\n\r\n   (3) _Sylva Sylvarum_ (left incomplete). This part was designed\r\n   to give a complete view of what we call Natural Philosophy and\r\n   Natural History. The subjects he has touched on under this head\r\n   are four--the History of Winds, Life and Death, Density and\r\n   Rarity, Sound and Hearing.\r\n\r\n   (4) _Scala Intellectus._ Of this we have only a few of the\r\n   opening pages.\r\n\r\n   (5) _Prodromi._ A few fragments only were written.\r\n\r\n   (6) _Philosophia Secunda._ Never executed.\r\n\r\n=3. His Style.= Of Bacon as a philosopher we can only say that he is\r\none of the founders of modern systematic thought. His most important\r\nliterary work is his _Essays_. In its three versions this work shows\r\nthe development of Bacon’s English style. In the first edition the\r\nstyle is crisp, detached, and epigrammatic, conveying the impression\r\nthat each essay has arisen from some happy thought or phrase, around\r\nwhich other pithy statements are agglomerated. In the later editions\r\nthe ideas are expanded, the expression loses its spiky pointedness,\r\nand in the end we have an approach to a freer middle style, an\r\napproximation to the swinging manner of Dryden. Bacon had no ear\r\nfor rhythm and melody; a born rhetorician, he preferred the sharper\r\ndevices of antithesis and epigram; and he was always clear, orderly,\r\nand swiftly precise in his phrasing. Following the fashion of the\r\ntime, he was free in his use of allusions, conceits, and Latin tags,\r\ncreating rather a garish ornamental effect; but his style is saved from\r\ntriviality by his breadth of intellect, by his luminous intensity of\r\nideas, and by his cool man-of-the-world sagacity.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of comparison we quote the same extract from the first and\r\nthird editions of the _Essays_. The second extract, it will be\r\nnoticed, is a studied expansion of the first.\r\n\r\n   (1) Crafty men contemn them, simple men admire them, wise men\r\n   use them; for they teach not their own use, but that is a wisdom\r\n   without them and above them won by observation. Read not to\r\n   contradict nor to believe, but to weigh and consider. Some books\r\n   are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be\r\n   chewed and digested; that is, some books are to be read only\r\n   in parts, others to be read but cursorily, and some few to be\r\n   read wholly and with diligence and attention. Reading maketh\r\n   a full man, conference a ready man, and writing an exact man.\r\n   And therefore, if a man write little, he had need have a great\r\n   memory; if he confer little, he had need have a present wit;\r\n   and if he read little, he had need have much cunning to seem to\r\n   know that he doth not. Histories make men wise; poets witty; the\r\n   mathematics subtle; natural philosophy deep; moral grave; logic\r\n   and rhetoric able to contend.\r\n\r\n   (2) Crafty men contemn studies, simple men admire them, and\r\n   wise men use them; for they teach not their own use; but that\r\n   is a wisdom without them, and above them, won by observation.\r\n   Read not to contradict and confute; nor to believe and take\r\n   for granted; nor to find talk and discourse; but to weigh and\r\n   consider. Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed,\r\n   and some few to be chewed and digested; that is, some books\r\n   are to be read only in parts; others to be read, but not\r\n   curiously; and some few to be read wholly, and with diligence\r\n   and attention. Some books also may be read by deputy, and\r\n   extracts made of them by others; but that would be only in\r\n   the less important arguments, and the meaner sort of books;\r\n   else distilled books are like common distilled waters, flashy\r\n   things. Reading maketh a full man; conference a ready man; and\r\n   writing an exact man. And therefore, if a man write little, he\r\n   had need have a great memory; if he confer little, he had need\r\n   have a present wit; and if he read little, he had need have much\r\n   cunning, to seem to know that he doth not. Histories make men\r\n   wise; poets witty; the mathematics subtile; natural philosophy\r\n   deep; moral grave; logic and rhetoric able to contend.\r\n                                                          _Of Studies_\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER PROSE-WRITERS\r\n\r\n=1. Roger Ascham (1515–68)= is representative of the earliest school of\r\nElizabethan prose. He was born in Yorkshire, and educated privately and\r\nat St. John’s College, Cambridge, where he became a Fellow (1535) and\r\na teacher of Greek (1540). He took part in the literary and religious\r\ndisputes of the time, but managed to keep his feet on the shifting\r\ngrounds of politics. He was appointed tutor to Elizabeth (1548) and\r\nsecretary to Queen Mary; he visited the Continent as secretary to an\r\nembassy; and ultimately was appointed a canon of York Minster.\r\n\r\nHis two chief works were _Toxophilus_ (1544), a treatise, in the\r\nform of a dialogue, on archery; and _The Scholemaster_ (1570), an\r\neducational work containing some ideas that were then fairly fresh\r\nand enlightening. Ascham was a man of moderate literary talent, of\r\ngreat industry, and of boundless enthusiasm for learning. Though he\r\nis strongly influenced by classical models, he has all the strong\r\nElizabethan sense of nationality. In _Toxophilus_ he declares his\r\nintention of “writing this English matter in the English speech for\r\nEnglishmen.” In style he is plain and strong, using only the more\r\nobvious graces of alliteration and antithesis.\r\n\r\n=2. John Lyly (1553–1606)= marks another stage in the march of\r\nEnglish prose. He was born in Kent, educated at Oxford, and, failing to\r\nobtain Court patronage, became a literary man in London. At first he\r\nhad considerable success, and entered Parliament; but at a later stage\r\nhis popularity declined, and he died poverty-stricken in London.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned his comedies (see p. 105), which at the time\r\nbrought him fame and money. But his first prose work, _Euphues,\r\nthe Anatomy of Wit_ (1579), made him one of the foremost figures\r\nof the day. He repeated the success with a second part, _Euphues\r\nand his England_ (1580). The work is a kind of travel-romance,\r\nrecounting the adventures of Euphues, a young Athenian. The narrative\r\nis interspersed with numerous discussions upon many topics. It was,\r\nhowever, the style of its prose that gave the book its great vogue. It\r\nis the first consciously fabricated prose style in the language. It\r\nis mannered and affected almost to the point of being ridiculous. Its\r\ntricks are obvious and easily imitated, and they are freely applied\r\nby the next generation: balanced phrases, intricate alliteration,\r\nlabored comparisons drawn from classical and other sources, and ornate\r\nepithets. The effect is quaint and not displeasing, but the narrative\r\nlabors under the weight of it. It certainly suited the growing literary\r\nconsciousness of its day, and hence its pronounced, though temporary,\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nThe following extract will illustrate the euphuistic manner:\r\n\r\n   Philautus being a town-born child, both for his own countenance,\r\n   and the great countenance which his father had while he\r\n   lived, crept into credit with Don Ferardo one of the chief\r\n   governors of the city, who although he had a courtly crew of\r\n   gentlewomen sojourning in his palace, yet his daughter, heir\r\n   to his whole revenues stained the beauty of them all, whose\r\n   modest bashfulness caused the other to look wan for envy, whose\r\n   lily cheeks dyed with a vermilion red, made the rest to blush\r\n   for shame. For as the finest ruby staineth the colour of the\r\n   rest that be in place, or as the sun dimmeth the moon, that\r\n   she cannot be discerned, so this gallant girl more fair than\r\n   fortunate, and yet more fortunate than faithful, eclipsed the\r\n   beauty of them all, and changed their colours. Unto her had\r\n   Philautus access, who won her by right of love, and should have\r\n   worn her by right of law, had not Euphues by strange destiny\r\n   broken the bonds of marriage, and forbidden the banns of\r\n   matrimony.\r\n                                          _Euphues and his England_\r\n\r\n\r\n=3. Richard Hooker (1553–1600)= was born near Exeter, and educated\r\nat Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he was elected a Fellow\r\n(1577). In 1582 he took orders, and later was appointed to a living in\r\nKent, where he died.\r\n\r\nHis great work, at which he labored during the greater part of his\r\nlife, was _The Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity_. The first four of\r\nthe proposed eight books were issued in 1593; he finished one more;\r\nand though the remaining three were published under his name when he\r\nwas dead, it is very doubtful if he was entirely responsible for them.\r\nIn the work he supports Episcopacy against Presbyterianism. In style\r\nhe is strongly affected by classical writers; but he usually writes\r\nwith homeliness and point; his sentences are carefully constructed;\r\nthe rhythm moves easily; and there is both precision and melody in his\r\nchoice of vocabulary. His style is an early example of scholarly and\r\naccomplished English prose.\r\n\r\n=4. Sir Thomas Overbury (1581–1613)= may be taken as typical of a\r\nfairly large class of Elizabethan writers. He was born in Warwickshire,\r\neducated at Oxford, and became a figure at the Court of King James. His\r\nchief friend at Court was James’s favorite Robert Carr, with whom he\r\nquarreled over a love-affair. For this Overbury fell into disfavor, and\r\nwas imprisoned in the Tower, where he was poisoned under mysterious and\r\nbarbarous circumstances.\r\n\r\nOverbury survives in literature as the author of a series of\r\n_Characters_ (1614). Based on the ancient Greek work of Theophrastus,\r\nthe book consists of a number of concise character-sketches of\r\nwell-known types, such as a Milkmaid, a Pedant, a Franklin, and\r\n“an Affectate Traveller.” The sketches are solely of types, not of\r\nindividuals, and so lack any great literary merit. But they are\r\nimportant for several reasons: they are a curious development of the\r\npamphlet, which was so common at that time; they are another phase\r\nof the “humours” craze, seen so strongly in the Jonsonian and other\r\ndramas; and they are an important element in the growth of the essay.\r\nIn style the book is strongly euphuistic, thus illustrating another\r\ntendency of the time. They were added to and imitated by other writers,\r\nincluding =John Earle (1601–65)=.\r\n\r\n=5. Robert Burton (1577–1640)= was the son of a country gentleman, and\r\nwas born in Leicestershire. He was educated at Oxford, where, in holy\r\norders, he passed most of his life.\r\n\r\nHis famous work, _The Anatomy of Melancholy_, was first issued in\r\n1621, and then constantly revised and reissued. It is an elaborate and\r\ndiscursive study of melancholy, its species and kinds, its causes,\r\nresults, and cure. The book--labored, saturnine, and fantastic to an\r\nextraordinary degree--has exercised a strong fascination over many\r\nscholarly minds, including those of Dr. Johnson and Charles Lamb. Its\r\nlearning is immense and unconventional, being drawn from many rare\r\nauthors; its humor curiously crabbed, subdued, and ironical; and its\r\n“melancholy,” though pervading, is not oppressive. The diction, harsh\r\nand unstudied, is rarely obscure; the enormous sentences, packed with\r\nquotation and allusion, are loosely knit. Both as a stylist and as a\r\npersonality Burton occupies his own niche in English literature.\r\n\r\n=6. The Sermon-writers.= At the beginning of the seventeenth century\r\nthe sermon rose to a level of literary importance not hitherto\r\nattained, and afterward rarely equaled. We have already mentioned Donne\r\n(see p. 102), probably the most notable of his group, and we give space\r\nto two other writers.\r\n\r\n(_a_) =James Ussher (1581–1656)= was born in Dublin, and was descended\r\nfrom an ancient Protestant family. He was educated at Trinity College,\r\nDublin, and rose to be Bishop of Meath and Archbishop of Armagh (1626).\r\nIn 1640 he visited England, where, owing to the disturbed state of\r\nIreland, he had to remain for the remainder of his life. His many\r\nsermons, discourses, and tracts show learning, adroit argument, and a\r\nplain and easy style. His _Chronologia Sacra_ was for a long time the\r\nstandard work on Biblical chronology.\r\n\r\n(_b_) =Joseph Hall (1574–1656)= was educated at Cambridge, took orders,\r\nand became a prominent opponent of the Puritans, among whom was Milton.\r\nHe was appointed Bishop of Exeter (1627) and of Norwich (1641). When\r\nthe Puritans rose to power Hall’s opinions brought him into disgrace.\r\nHe was imprisoned, and, though liberated, forbidden to preach. He died\r\nin retirement.\r\n\r\nHall’s earliest work was in verse, and consisted of a series of satires\r\ncalled _Virgidemiarum_ (1597), which were condemned by the Church as\r\nbeing licentious. His theological and devotional works, the product\r\nof his later years, are very numerous, and include tracts, sermons,\r\nand treatises. Though he is often shallow and voluble, he writes\r\nwith literary grace. He is without doubt the most literary of the\r\ntheologians of the time.\r\n\r\n=7. The Translators.= The zeal for learning which was such a prominent\r\nfeature of the early Elizabethan times was strongly apparent in the\r\nfrequent translations. This class of literature had several curious\r\ncharacteristics. The translators cared little for verbal accuracy,\r\nand sometimes were content to translate from a translation, say from\r\na French version of a Latin text. The translators, moreover, borrowed\r\nfrom each other, and repeated the errors of their fellows. These habits\r\ndeprived their work of any great pretensions to scholarship; but they\r\nwere eager adventurers into the new realms of learning, and to a\r\ngreat extent they reproduced the spirit, if not the letter, of their\r\noriginals.\r\n\r\nOne of the first and most popular of the translations was North’s\r\n_Diall of Princes_ (1557), from an Italian original. North also\r\ntranslated Plutarch’s _Lives_ (1579), a work that had much influence\r\nupon Shakespeare and other dramatists. Other classical translations\r\nwere those of Virgil, done by =Phaer= in 1558 and =Stanyhurst= in\r\n1583, and of Ovid, by =Turberville= in 1567 and by =Chapman= in 1595.\r\nChapman’s Translation of Homer (1596) is perhaps the most famous of\r\nthem all. It is composed in long, swinging lines, and is lively,\r\naudacious, and pleasing.\r\n\r\n=8. The Pamphleteers.= All through this period there is a flood of\r\nshort tracts on religion, politics, and literature. It was the work of\r\na host of literary hacks who earned a precarious existence in London.\r\nThese men represented a new class of writer. The Reformation had closed\r\nthe Church to them; the growth of the universities and of learning\r\ncontinually increased their numbers. In later times journalism and\r\nits kindred careers supplied them with a livelihood; but at this time\r\nthey eked out their existence by writing plays and squabbling among\r\nthemselves in the pages of broadsheets.\r\n\r\nIn its buoyancy and vigor, its quaint mixture of truculence and\r\npetulance, Elizabethan pamphleteering is refreshingly boyish and\r\nalive. It is usually keenly satirical, and in style it is unformed and\r\nuncouth. The most notorious of the pamphleteers were =Thomas Nash\r\n(1567–1601)=, =Robert Greene (1560–92)=, and =Thomas Lodge\r\n(1558–1625)=. We quote a well-known passage from a pamphlet of\r\nGreene, in which he contrives to mingle praise of his friends with sly\r\ngibes at one who is probably Shakespeare. The style is typical of the\r\npamphlets.\r\n\r\n   And thou,[100] no less deserving than the other two,[101] in\r\n   some things rarer, in nothing inferior; driven (as myself) to\r\n   extreme shifts, a little have I to say to thee; and were it\r\n   not an idolatrous oath, I would swear by sweet St. George,\r\n   thou art unworthy better hap, sith thou dependest on so mean\r\n   a stay. Base-minded men all three of you, if by my misery ye\r\n   be not warned; for unto none of you (like me) sought those\r\n   burs to cleave,--those puppets, I mean,--that speak from our\r\n   mouths,--those antics garnished in our colours. Is it not\r\n   strange that I, to whom they all have been beholden,--is it not\r\n   like that you, to whom they all have been beholden,--shall\r\n   (were ye in that case that I am now) be both at once of them\r\n   forsaken? Yes, trust them not: for there is an upstart crow,\r\n   beautified with our feathers, that with his tiger’s heart wrapt\r\n   in a player’s hide, supposes he is as well able to bombast\r\n   out a blank-verse as the best of you: and being an absolute\r\n   _Johannes factotum_, is in his own conceit the only\r\n   Shakescene in a country. Oh, that I might entreat your rare wits\r\n   to be employed in more profitable courses, and let those apes\r\n   imitate your past excellence, and never more acquaint them with\r\n   your admired inventions! I know the best husband of you all\r\n   will never prove an usurer, and the kindest of them all will\r\n   never prove a kind nurse: yet, whilst you may, seek you better\r\n   masters; for it is pity men of such rare wits should be subject\r\n   to the pleasures of such rude grooms.\r\n                                 _A Groatsworth of Wit bought with a\r\n                                       Million of Repentance_\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF LITERARY FORMS\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the Elizabethan age English literary forms were\r\nstill to a large extent in the making; at the end of the period there\r\nis a rich and varied store of most of the chief literary species. All\r\nthat can be done here is to give the barest outline of this development.\r\n\r\n=1. Poetry.= (_a_) _Lyrical Poetry._ The temper of the age was suited\r\nto the lyrical mood, and so the abundance of the lyric is very great.\r\nIt begins with the first efforts of Wyat and Surrey (1557); it\r\ncontinues through the dramas in all their stages; and it appears in\r\nthe numerous miscellanies of the period. Then the lyrical impulse is\r\ncarried on without a break into the melodies of Campion and the darker\r\nmoods of Donne. The forms of the lyric are many, and on the whole its\r\nnotes are musical, wild, and natural.\r\n\r\nAn interesting sub-species of the lyric is the _sonnet_. We have seen\r\nhow it took two forms--the Italian or Petrarchan form, and the English\r\nor Shakespearian type. During this period both kinds flourished, the\r\nEnglish kind to a greater degree. Wyat began (1557) with a group of the\r\nItalian type; Surrey introduced the English form. Then the sonnet, in\r\none or other of its two forms, was continued by Sidney in _Astrophel\r\nand Stella_ (published in 1591), by Spenser, by Shakespeare, by Daniel\r\nin _Delia_ (1592), and by Watson in _Heoatompathia, or Passionate\r\nCentury of Sonnets_ (1582). Later in the period the sonnet was less\r\npopular, though Drayton wrote at least one of great power.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Descriptive and Narrative Poetry._ This is a convenient title\r\nfor a large and important class of poems. In this period it begins\r\nwith such works as Sackville’s _Induction_ (1555), and continues\r\nwith Marlowe’s _Hero and Leander_ (1598) and Shakespeare’s _Venus\r\nand Adonis_ (1593) and _The Rape of Lucrece_ (1594). It culminates\r\nin the sumptuous allegorical poetry of Spenser; and it begins its\r\ndecline with the Spenserians of the type of the Fletchers and with\r\nDrayton’s _Endimion and Phœbe_ (1600). The pastoral, which is a kind of\r\ndescriptive poem, is seen in Spenser’s _Shepherd’s Calendar_ (1579), in\r\nBrowne’s _Britannia’s Pastorals_ (1613), and in Drayton. Almost purely\r\ndescriptive poetry is represented in Drayton’s _Polyolbion_ (1612);\r\nand a more strongly narrative type is the same poet’s _England’s\r\nHeroical Epistles_ (1597). All these poems are distinguished by strong\r\ndescriptive power, freshness of fancy, and sometimes by positive genius\r\nof style.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Religious_, _satirical_, and _didactic poetry_ cannot take\r\na position equal in importance to the rest. During the period the\r\nsatirical intent is quite strong, but it does not produce great poetry.\r\nGascoigne’s _Steel Glass_ (1576) is one of the earliest satires; and it\r\nis followed by Donne’s _Satires_ (1593) and Hall’s _Satires_ (1597).\r\nDrayton’s _Harmony of the Church_ (1591) is religious in motive; so are\r\nseveral poems of Donne, and also many of those of the Jesuit =Robert\r\nSouthwell (1561–95)=.\r\n\r\n=2. Drama.= The opening of the Elizabethan period saw the drama\r\nstruggling into maturity. The early type of the time was scholarly in\r\ntone and aristocratic in authorship. An example of the earliest type\r\nof playwright is =Fulke Greville, Lord Brooke (1554–1628)=, who\r\ndistinguished himself both as a dramatic and lyrical poet.\r\n\r\nTo this stage succeeded that of Shakespeare, which covered\r\napproximately the years 1595 to 1615. Of this drama all we can say\r\nhere is that it is the crown and flower of the Elizabethan literary\r\nachievement, and embodies almost the entire spirit both of drama and\r\npoetry.\r\n\r\nThe decline begins with Jonson, and continues with Beaumont and\r\nFletcher, Dekker, Heywood, and the other dramatists mentioned in this\r\nchapter. The decline is made clear in several ways: in the narrowing\r\nof the ample Shakespearian motive, which comprises all mankind, into\r\nthemes of temporary, local, and fragmentary importance; in the lack of\r\ncreative power in the characterization, resulting (as in Jonson) in\r\nmere types or “humors,” or (as in Dekker and Fletcher) in superficial\r\nimprovisation, or in ponderous tragical figures (as in Webster and\r\nTourneur); and lastly, in the degradation of the style, which will be\r\nnoted below. Sometimes the decline is gilded with delicate fancy, as in\r\nFletcher’s _Faithful Shepherdess_, or in the exquisite _Parliament of\r\nBees_ (1607) by =John Day (1574–1640)=; but the grace and charm of such\r\nplays cannot conceal the falling-off in power and imagination.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the development of the different dramatic types, we have\r\nalready noted that tragedy developed first; in Shakespeare all kinds\r\nreceived attention, tragedy most of all. In post-Shakespearian drama\r\nlight comedy was the most popular species, chiefly because the tragic\r\nnote of exalted pity had degenerated into melodrama and horrors.\r\n\r\nA special word is perhaps necessary on the _masque_, which\r\nduring this time had a brief but brilliant career. The masque is\r\na short dramatic performance composed for some particular festive\r\noccasion, such as the marriage or majority of a great man’s son; it is\r\ndistinguished by ornate stage-setting, by lyrics, music, and dancing,\r\nand by allegorical characters. It finds a place in Shakespeare’s\r\n_Tempest_ and other plays; it is strongly developed in the works\r\nof Jonson, Fletcher, and other poets of the time; and it attains its\r\nclimax during the next age in the _Comus_ (1637) of Milton.\r\n\r\n=3. Prose.= In Elizabethan times the development of prose was\r\nslower and slighter than that of poetry.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The _essay_, beginning in the pamphlet, character-sketch, and\r\nother miscellaneous writing, develops in the work of Bacon. Its rise\r\nwill be sketched more fully in a future chapter (see p. 268).\r\n\r\n(_b_) The _novel_ has some meager but significant beginnings in More’s\r\n_Utopia_ (1516), Sidney’s _Arcadia_ (published in 1590), Lyly’s\r\n_Euphues_ (1579), Bacon’s _New Atlantis_ (1626), and most of all in\r\nNash’s _The Unfortunate Traveller_ (1594). The rise of the novel is\r\nalso reserved for a later chapter (see p. 336).\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Miscellaneous prose_, in the pamphlets, theological works,\r\nsermons, translations, travels, and such abnormalities as Burton’s\r\n_Anatomy of Melancholy_ (1621), is exceedingly voluminous and\r\nimportant. We have here a large, loose, and varied mass of English\r\nprose, the central exercising-ground of the average prose-writer, that\r\nis to be the foundation of many important groups of the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF LITERARY STYLE\r\n\r\n=1. Poetry.= The period immediately preceding was that of the clumsy\r\npoetry of Hawes, Skelton, and their kind; succeeding it is the strength\r\nand beauty of Elizabethan poetry. Between these two extremes the\r\ndifferent stages of development are fairly well marked.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The earliest period (say from 1550–80) is that of Wyat, Surrey,\r\nSidney, and the University Wits. This is the formative and imitative\r\nperiod, during which the dependence upon classical originals is\r\nparticularly strong. The style has the precision and the erratic\r\ncharacter of the diligent pupil. There are few deliberate innovations,\r\nand lapses into barbarism are not unknown. In this period appear the\r\nsonnet, blank verse, and many of the beautiful lyrical metrical forms.\r\nThe lyrical style is least restrained by the influence of classical\r\nmodels.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The Spenserian and Shakespearian stage (from about 1580 to 1615)\r\nis the stage of highest development. The native English genius, having\r\nabsorbed the lessons of foreign writers, adds to them the youth and\r\nardor of its own spirit. The result is a fullness, freshness, and\r\ngrandeur of style unequaled in any other period of our literature.\r\nThere are the lyrics and allegories of Spenser; the poems, dramas, and\r\nlyrics of Shakespeare; and the innumerable miscellanies, poems, and\r\nplays of other writers. The style is as varied as the poems; but the\r\nuniversal note is the romantic one of power and ease.\r\n\r\n(_c_) In the second decade of the seventeenth century the decline\r\nis apparent. The inspired phraseology, the wealth and flexibility of\r\nvocabulary, and the general bloom of the style pass into the lightness\r\nof fancy and the tinkling unsubstantial verse of the nature of\r\nCampion’s. Or the high seriousness degenerates into the gloomy manner\r\nof the Websterian tragedy. The handling of blank verse is typical of\r\nthe movement. The sinewy Shakesperian blank verse becomes nerveless; in\r\ndrama prose is commoner in quantity and coarser in fiber. In the lyric\r\nmuch of the old technical dexterity survives, but the deeper qualities\r\nof passion and sincerity are less common and robust.\r\n\r\n=2. Prose.= Unlike that of poetry, the style of prose enjoys a\r\nsteady development, continued from the previous age, and maintained\r\nthrough the Elizabethan age. Euphuism, which appeared early in this\r\nepoch, was a kind of literary measles incidental to early growth, and\r\nit quickly passed away, leaving the general body of English prose\r\nhealthier than before. There is an increase in the raw material of\r\nprose in the shape of many foreign words that are imported; there is a\r\ngrowing expertness in sentence-and paragraph-construction and in the\r\nmore delicate graces of style, such as rhythm and melody. The prose\r\nof Hooker and Bacon (in his later stages) represents the furthest\r\ndevelopment of the time. Prose style has yet a great deal to learn, but\r\nit is learning fast.\r\n\r\n\r\n         TABLE TO ILLUSTRATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF LITERARY FORMS\r\n\r\n    +----+------------------------------------------+-------------------------+----------------------------------+\r\n    |    |                 POETRY                   |          DRAMA          |              PROSE               |\r\n    |DATE|-------+---------------------+------------+------------+------------+-----------+-----------+----------+\r\n    |    | Lyric |Narrative-Descriptive|  Didactic  |   Comedy   |   Tragedy  |   Essay   | Narrative | Didactic |\r\n    +----+-------+---------------------+------------+------------+------------+-----------+-----------+----------+\r\n    |    |       |                     |            |            |            |           |           | Ascham   |\r\n    |    |       |                     |            |            |            |           |           |          |\r\n    |1550|       |                     |            |            |            |           |           |          |\r\n    +----+-------+---------------------+------------+------------+------------+-----------+-----------+----------+\r\n    |    |       |                     |            |            |            |           |           |          |\r\n    |    |       | Sackville[102]      |            |            |            |           |           |          |\r\n    |1560|Wyat[103]| Surrey[103]       |            |            |            |           |           |          |\r\n    +----+-------+---------------------+------------+------------+------------+-----------+-----------+----------+\r\n    |    |       |                     |            |            |            |           |           |          |\r\n    |    |       |                     |            |            |            |           |           |          |\r\n    |1570|       |                     |            |            |            |           |           |          |\r\n    +----+-------+---------------------+------------+------------+------------+-----------+-----------+----------+\r\n    |    |       |                     |            |            |            |           |           |          |\r\n    |    |       |                     |Gascoigne[104]|          |            |           |           |          |\r\n    |1580|       | Spenser[105]        |            |            |            |           | North[106]| Lyly     |\r\n    +----+-------+---------------------+------------+------------+------------+-----------+-----------+----------+\r\n    |    |       |                     |            | Lyly       | Peele      |           |           |          |\r\n    |    |       |                     |            |            Kyd          |           |           |          |\r\n    |    |       |                     |            |            Greene       |           |           |          |\r\n    |1590|       |                     |            |              Marlowe    |           |           |          |\r\n    +----+-------+---------------------+------------+-------------------------+-----------+-----------+----------+\r\n    |    |Daniel | Donne               |            |        Nash             |           |           |Hooker[107]|\r\n    |    |       | Shakespeare[108]    |            |                         |           | Nash      |          |\r\n    |    |       | Marlowe             |            | Shakespeare             |           |           |Spenser   |\r\n    |1600|       |                     | Drayton    |          Chapman        |Bacon[109] |           |          |\r\n    +----+-------+---------------------+------------+-------------------------+-----------+-----------+----------+\r\n    |    |Campion|                     |            |Jonson Dekker Shakespeare|           |           |          |\r\n    |    |Donne  |                     |            |      Marston            |           |           |          |\r\n    |    |       |                     |            |             Jonson      |           |           |          |\r\n    |1610|       | G.

In the following passages, which illustrate the development of blank\r\nverse, examine the metrical features (such as the scansion, variation\r\nof the pause, and the melody) of each, and mention if any improvement\r\nis apparent.\r\n\r\n    (1) It was the time when granted from the gods,\r\n        The first sleep creeps most sweet in weary folk,\r\n        Lo, in my dream before mine eyes, methought\r\n        With rueful cheer I saw where Hector stood\r\n        (Out of whose eyes gushed streams of tears),\r\n        Drawn at a car as he of late had been,\r\n        Distained with bloody dust, whose feet were bowl’n[113]\r\n        With the strait cords wherewith they haled him.\r\n                                              SURREY, _Æneid_, 1557\r\n\r\n    (2) That age is dead and vanished long ago,\r\n        Which thought that steel both trusty was and true\r\n        And needed not a foil of contraries,\r\n        But shewed all things even as they were in deed.\r\n        In stead whereof, our curious years can find\r\n        The crystal glass, which glimpseth brave and bright,\r\n        And shews the thing much better far than it,\r\n        Beguiled with foils, of sundry subtle sights\r\n        So that they seem and covet not to be.\r\n                                   GASCOIGNE, _The Steel Glass_, 1576\r\n\r\n    (3)   _Prospero._             Of the king’s ship\r\n        The mariners, say how thou hast disposed\r\n        And all the rest o’ the fleet.\r\n          _Ariel._                Safely in harbour\r\n        Is the king’s ship: in the deep nook, where once\r\n        Thou call’dst me up at midnight to fetch dew\r\n        From the still-vex’d Bermoothes, there she’s hid:\r\n        The mariners all under hatches stow’d;\r\n        Who, with a charm join’d to their suffer’d labour,\r\n        I have left asleep: and for the rest o’ the fleet\r\n        Which I dispersed, they all have met again\r\n        And are upon the Mediterranean flote,\r\n        Bound sadly home for Naples,\r\n        Supposing that they saw the king’s ship wreck’d\r\n        And his great person perish.\r\n                                      SHAKESPEARE, _The Tempest_, 1611\r\n\r\n3. Comment upon the style, meter, and general level of excellence shown\r\nin the following sonnets. Point out any development that is observable.\r\n\r\n    (1) The sweet season, that bud and bloom forth brings,\r\n        With green hath clad the hill and eke the vale.\r\n        The nightingale, with feathers new, she sings;\r\n        The turtle to her mate hath told her tale;\r\n        Summer is come, for every spray now springs.\r\n        The hart hath hung his old head on the pale:\r\n        The buck in brake his winter coat he flings;\r\n        The fishes fleet with new repaired scale;\r\n        The adder all her slough away she flings;\r\n        The swift swallow pursueth the flies small;\r\n        The busy bee her honey how she mings!\r\n        Winter is worn, that was the flowers’ bale,\r\n        And thus I see among these pleasant things\r\n        Each care decays, and yet my sorrow springs.\r\n                                          SURREY, _To Spring_, 1557\r\n\r\n    (2) Sweet is the rose, but growes upon a brere;\r\n        Sweet is the juniper, but sharpe his bough;\r\n        Sweet is the eglantine, but pricketh nere,\r\n        Sweet is the firbloome, but his braunches rough;\r\n        Sweet is the cyprese, but his rynd is tough;\r\n        Sweet is the nut, but bitter is his pill;[114]\r\n        Sweet is the broome flowre, but yet sowre enough;\r\n        And sweet is moly, but his root is ill;\r\n        So, every sweet, with soure is tempred still,\r\n        That maketh it be coveted the more:\r\n        For easie things that may be got at will\r\n        Most sorts of men doe set but little store.\r\n        Why then should I accompt of little paine\r\n        That endlesse pleasure shall unto me gaine!\r\n                                       SPENSER, _Amoretti_, 1595\r\n\r\n    (3) Since there’s no help, come, let us kiss and part,--\r\n        Nay, I have done, you get no more of me;\r\n        And I am glad, yea, glad with all my heart,\r\n        That thus so cleanly I myself can free;\r\n        Shake hands for ever, cancel all our vows,\r\n        And when we meet at any time again,\r\n        Be it not seen in either of our brows\r\n        That we one jot of former love retain.\r\n        Now at the last gasp of love’s latest breath,\r\n        When, his pulse failing, passion speechless lies,\r\n        When faith is kneeling by his bed of death,\r\n        And innocence is closing up his eyes,\r\n        --Now if thou wouldst, when all have given him over,\r\n        From death to life thou mightest him yet recover!\r\n                                                       DRAYTON, 1620\r\n\r\n4. Hooker’s is sometimes considered to be the most highly developed of\r\nElizabethan prose styles. In the following two extracts examine the\r\nvocabulary, sentence-construction, and general competence of the first,\r\nand compare it with the second, which was written about two hundred\r\nyears earlier.\r\n\r\n   (1) Touching musical harmony, whether by instrument or by voice,\r\n   it being but of high and low in sounds a due proportionable\r\n   disposition, such notwithstanding is the force thereof, and\r\n   so pleasing effects it hath in that very part of man which is\r\n   most divine, that some have been thereby induced to think\r\n   that the soul itself by nature is, or hath in it, harmony; a\r\n   thing which delighteth all ages, and beseemeth all states; a\r\n   thing as seasonable in grief as in joy; as decent being added\r\n   unto actions of greatest weight and solemnity, as being used\r\n   when men most sequester themselves from action. The reason\r\n   hereof is an admirable facility which music hath to express and\r\n   represent to the mind, more inwardly than any other sensible\r\n   mean, the very standing, rising and falling, the very steps and\r\n   inflections every way, the turns and varieties of all passions\r\n   whereunto the mind is subject; yea, so to imitate them, that,\r\n   whether it resemble unto us the same state wherein our minds\r\n   already are, or a clean contrary, we are not more contentedly by\r\n   the one confirmed, than changed and led away by the other. In\r\n   harmony, the very image and character even of virtue and vice\r\n   is perceived, the mind delighted with their resemblances, and\r\n   brought by having them often iterated into a love of the things\r\n   themselves. For which cause there is nothing more contagious and\r\n   pestilent than some kinds of harmony; than some, nothing more\r\n   strong and potent unto good.\r\n                     HOOKER, _The Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity_, 1592\r\n\r\n\r\n   (2) This Emperor Prester John, when he goeth in to battle,\r\n   against any other lord, he hath no banners borne before him: but\r\n   he hath three crosses of gold, fine, great and high, full of\r\n   precious stones: and every of the crosses be set in a chariot,\r\n   full richly arrayed. And for to keep every cross, be ordained\r\n   ten thousand men of arms, and more than a hundred thousand\r\n   men on foot, in manner as men would keep a standard in our\r\n   countries, when that we be in land of war. And this number of\r\n   folk is without the principal host, and without wings ordained\r\n   for the battle. And when he hath no war, but rideth with a privy\r\n   retinue, then he hath borne before him but a cross of tree,\r\n   without peinture, and without gold or silver or precious stones;\r\n   in remembrance, that Jesu Christ suffered death upon a cross of\r\n   tree.\r\n                                           MANDEVILLE, _Travels_, 1400\r\n\r\n\r\n   5. In what respects is each of the following extracts typical of\r\n   its author and its age? Write a very brief appreciation of the\r\n   style of each.\r\n\r\n    (1) Was this the face that launched a thousand ships,\r\n        And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?\r\n        Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss.--\r\n        Her lips suck forth my soul: see where it flies!\r\n        Come, Helen, come, give me my soul again.\r\n        Here will I dwell, for heaven is in those lips,\r\n        And all is dross that is not Helena.\r\n        I will be Paris, and for love of thee,\r\n        Instead of Troy, shall Wittenberg be sacked;\r\n        And I will combat with weak Menelaus,\r\n        And wear thy colours on my plumed crest;\r\n        Yea, I will wound Achilles in the heel,\r\n        And then return to Helen for a kiss.\r\n        Oh, thou art fairer than the evening air\r\n        Clad in the beauty of a thousand stars.\r\n                                      MARLOWE, _Doctor Faustus_\r\n\r\n   (2) Iffida, the water standing in her eyes, clasping my hand in\r\n   hers, with a sad countenance answered me thus:\r\n\r\n   “My good Fidus, if the increasing of my sorrows, might mitigate\r\n   the extremity of thy sickness, I could be content to resolve\r\n   myself into tears to rid thee of trouble: but the making of a\r\n   fresh wound in my body is nothing to the healing of a festered\r\n   sore in thy bowels: for that such diseases are to be cured\r\n   in the end, by the names of their original. For as by basil\r\n   the scorpion is engendered and by the means of the same herb\r\n   destroyed: so love which by time and fancy is bred in an idle\r\n   head, is by time and fancy banished from the heart: or as the\r\n   salamander which, being a long space nourished in the fire,\r\n   at the last quencheth it, so affection having taken hold of\r\n   the fancy, and living as it were in the mind of the lover, in\r\n   tract of time altereth and changeth the heat, and turneth it to\r\n   chillness.\r\n                                     LYLY, _Euphues and his England_\r\n\r\n(3) Cozen german to idleness, and a concomitant cause which goes hand\r\nin hand with it, is _nimia solitudo_, too much solitariness--by\r\nthe testimony of all physicians, cause and symptom both; but as it is\r\nhere put for a cause, it is either coact, enforced, or else voluntary.\r\nEnforced solitariness is commonly seen in students, monks, friars,\r\nanchorites, that, by their order and course of life, must abandon all\r\ncompany, society of other men, and betake themselves to a private\r\ncell; _otio superstitioso seclusi_ (as Bale and Hospinian well\r\nterm it), such as are the Carthusians of our time, that eat no flesh\r\n(by their order), keep perpetual silence, never go abroad; such as\r\nlive in prison, or some desert place, and cannot have company, as many\r\nof our country gentlemen do in solitary houses; they must either be\r\nalone without companions, or live beyond their means, and entertain\r\nall comers as so many hosts, or else converse with their servants\r\nand hinds, such as are unequal, inferior to them, and of a contrary\r\ndisposition; or else, as some do, to avoid solitariness, spend their\r\ntime with lewd fellows in taverns, and in ale-houses, and thence\r\naddict themselves to some unlawful disports, or dissolute courses.\r\n                                   BURTON, _The Anatomy of Melancholy_\r\n\r\n\r\n(4) Mr Peter, as one somewhat severe of nature, said plainly, that the\r\nrod only was the sword that must keep the school in obedience, and\r\nthe scholar in good order. Mr Wotton, a man of mild nature, with soft\r\nvoice, and few words, inclined to Mr Secretary’s judgment, and said,\r\n“In mine opinion the school-house should be in deed, as it is called\r\nby name, the house of play and pleasure, and not of fear and bondage;\r\nand as I do remember, so saith Socrates in one place of Plato. And\r\ntherefore, if a rod carry the fear of a sword it is no marvel if those\r\nthat be fearful of nature choose rather to forsake the play, than to\r\nstand always within the fear of a sword in a fond man’s handling.”\r\n                                            ASCHAM, _The Scholemaster_\r\n\r\n\r\n    (5) Come little babe, come silly soul,\r\n        Thy father’s shame, thy mother’s grief,\r\n        Born as I doubt to all our dole,\r\n        And to thyself unhappy chief:\r\n            Sing lullaby and lap it warm,\r\n            Poor soul that thinks no creature harm.\r\n\r\n        Thou little think’st and less dost know\r\n        The cause of this thy mother’s moan;\r\n        Thou want’st the wit to wail her woe,\r\n        And I myself am all alone;\r\n            Why dost thou weep, why dost thou wail,\r\n            And know’st not yet what thou dost ail?\r\n\r\n        Come little wretch, ah silly heart,\r\n        Mine only joy; what can I more?\r\n        If there be any wrong thy smart,\r\n        That may the destinies implore;\r\n            ’Twas I, I say, against my will;\r\n            I wail the time, but be thou still.\r\n                                    _A Sweet Lullaby_\r\n                        (from _The Arbor of Amorous Devices_)\r\n\r\n    (6) Ere long they come where that same wicked wight\r\n        His dwelling has, low in an hollow cave,[115]\r\n        Far underneath a craggie clifty pight,\r\n        Darke, dolefull, dreary, like a greedy grave,\r\n        That still for carrion carcases doth crave:\r\n        On top whereof ay dwelt the ghastly Owle,\r\n        Shrieking his balefull note, which ever drave\r\n        Far from that haunt all other chearefull fowle;\r\n        And all about it wandring ghostes did wayle and howle.\r\n\r\n        And all about old stockes and stubs of trees,\r\n        Whereon nor fruit nor leafe was ever seene,\r\n        Did hang upon the ragged rocky knees;\r\n        On which had many wretches hanged beene,\r\n        Whose carcases were scattred on the greene,\r\n        And throwne about the clifts.

What were the signs of the “dramatic decline” that set in after\r\nShakespeare? Mention some dramatists whose plays show this decline.\r\n\r\n10.

But prose style grows\r\n   more slowly; and its growth is hindered rather than quickened by\r\n   the very variety of its subject.--CRAIK.\r\n\r\n11.

The earlier years are marked by the quarrels and alarms which led\r\nup to actual hostilities in 1642; the middle of the period is occupied\r\nwith the spasmodic fighting that lasted till the execution of Charles\r\nI in 1649; and the last portion covers the establishment of the\r\nCommonwealth, the rise and disappearance of Cromwell (1654–58), the\r\nconfusion following upon his death, and the final restoration of the\r\nmonarchy in 1660.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY FEATURES OF THE AGE\r\n\r\n=1. The Reaction.= During this period the decline from the high\r\nElizabethan standard is apparent in several ways. (_a_) The output,\r\nespecially of poetry, is much smaller, and the fashion is toward\r\nshorter poems, especially the lyric of a peculiar type. (_b_) There is\r\na marked decay in the exalted poetical fervor of the previous age. In\r\nthe new poetry there is more of the intellectual play of fancy than of\r\npassion and profundity. And, especially in prose, there is a matured\r\nmelancholy that one is apt to associate with advancing years. (_c_)\r\nIn prose there is a marked increase in activity, which is an almost\r\ninvariable accompaniment of a decline in poetry.\r\n\r\n=2. The Pressure of Historical Events.= Viewed from a broad aspect, the\r\nCivil War was only a domestic incident in English history; but the very\r\nnarrowness of the issue intensified the bitterness of the contest. It\r\ndivided the people into two factions, and among other things vitally\r\naffected the literature of the time. Poetry was benumbed and lifeless,\r\nand prose assumed a fierce and disputatious character.\r\n\r\n=3. The Dominance of Milton.= The age is distinguished by the efforts\r\nof Milton to keep literature alive. Upon his “Atlantean shoulders” he\r\nbears its reputation. Other poets were scrappy and uneven, like the\r\n“Metaphysicals”; or flat and uninspired, like Cowley; or shallow and\r\ntrivial, like Denham. In Milton alone, and even in the prose of Milton\r\nto a considerable extent, we find satisfying quantity and quality.\r\n\r\n=4. The Metaphysical Poets.= This term was first used by Johnson,\r\nwho applied it to Donne and Cowley. It was applied to a kind of poetry,\r\nusually lyrical poetry, that often startled the reader by the sudden\r\nleaps of its fancy into remoteness and (in exaggerated instances)\r\nabsurdity. The fashion was popular just before the Civil War broke\r\nout, and it can be seen in the works of Herrick, Crashaw, Herbert,\r\nVaughan, and others. More detailed examination of this curious poetical\r\nmode will be found in the notices of these poets.\r\n\r\n=5. The Cavalier Poets.= This name is often loosely applied to the\r\nMetaphysical poets; but the latter were usually of a religious\r\nand mystical cast, whereas the Cavalier poets were military and\r\nswashbuckling in disposition. They were well represented by Lovelace\r\nand Suckling.\r\n\r\n=6. The Expansion of Prose.= The development of prose is carried on\r\nfrom the previous age. In spite of the hampering effects of the civil\r\nstrife, the prose output was copious and excellent in kind. There was\r\na notable advance in the sermon; pamphlets were abundant; and history,\r\npolitics, philosophy, and miscellaneous kinds were well represented. In\r\naddition, there was a remarkable advance in prose style.\r\n\r\n=7. The Collapse of the Drama.= Many things combined to oppress the\r\ndrama at this time. Chief among these were the civil disturbances\r\nand the strong opposition of the Puritans. In temper the age was not\r\ndramatic. It is curious to note that Milton’s greatest work, which in\r\nthe Elizabethan age would probably have been dramatic in form, took on\r\nthe shape of the epic. The actual dramatic work of the period was small\r\nand unimportant; and the unequal struggle was terminated by the closing\r\nof the theaters in 1642.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN MILTON (1608–74)\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= Milton was born in Bread Street, Cheapside, London.\r\nHis father was a money-scrivener, an occupation that combined the\r\nduties of the modern banker and lawyer. Milton was educated at St.\r\nPaul’s School, London, and at Cambridge. At the university his stubborn\r\nand irascible nature declared itself, and owing to insubordination\r\nhe was “sent down” for a term. On taking his final degree (1632) he\r\nabandoned his intention of entering the Church and retired to Horton,\r\na small village in Buckinghamshire, some seventeen miles from London,\r\nwhither his father had withdrawn from business.\r\n\r\nMilton’s next few years were those of a sequestered man of letters.\r\nPoetry, mathematics, and music were his main studies. In 1638 he left\r\nfor a tour on the Continent, staying some months in Italy, where he\r\nmet many scholars and literary men. He was recalled to England by the\r\nnews that civil war was imminent. He settled down in London and set up\r\na small private school, and when hostilities broke out a year or two\r\nlater he took no part in the fighting. His pen, however, was active\r\nin support of the Parliamentary cause, to which he was passionately\r\nattached.\r\n\r\nIn 1643 he married a woman much younger than himself, and almost\r\nimmediately his wife left him, and did not return for two years. This\r\nunfortunate circumstance led Milton to write two strong pamphlets\r\non divorce, which caused a great scandal at the time. Then in 1649,\r\nafter the execution of the King, he was appointed by the Commonwealth\r\nGovernment Secretary for Foreign Tongues. In this capacity he became\r\nsecretary to the Council of State, and drafted Latin documents for\r\ntransmission to foreign Powers. In addition, he wrote numerous\r\npamphlets in support of the republican cause. By this time his eyesight\r\nwas failing; and when the Restoration came in 1660 to ruin his hopes,\r\nit found him blind, poor, and alone. He escaped, however, from the\r\nsevere punishments that were inflicted upon many prominent Roundheads.\r\nHe was slightly punished by a nominal imprisonment; retired to an\r\nobscure village in Buckinghamshire to write poetry; and died in London,\r\nwhere he was buried.\r\n\r\n=2. His Prose.= Most of Milton’s prose was written during the middle\r\nperiod of his life (1640–60), when he was busy with public affairs.\r\nThe prose works have an unusual interest, because as a rule they have\r\na direct bearing on either his personal business or public interests.\r\nIn all they amount to twenty-five pamphlets, of which twenty-one are in\r\nEnglish and the remaining four in Latin.\r\n\r\nHe began pamphleteering quite early (1641), when he engaged in a\r\nlively controversy with Bishop Hall over episcopacy. Then, while\r\nteaching, he wrote a rather poor tract, _Of Education_ (1644). When\r\nhis wife deserted him he composed two pamphlets on divorce (1643–4),\r\nwhich scandalized the public by the freedom of their opinions and the\r\nslashing nature of their style. The critics of the pamphlets sought to\r\nconfound Milton on a technical matter by pointing out that he had not\r\nlicensed the books, as required by law. To this Milton retorted with\r\nthe greatest of all his tracts, _Areopagitica_ (1644), a noble and\r\nimpassioned plea for the liberty of the Press. Later works include a\r\ndefense (in Latin) of the execution of Charles I and of other actions\r\nof the Commonwealth Government. During the last years of his life\r\nMilton partly completed a _History of Britain_ and other scholastic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the style of Milton’s prose we must keep in mind\r\nhow it was occasioned. His pamphlets were cast off at white heat and\r\nprecipitated into print while some topic was in urgent debate either\r\nin Milton’s or the public mind. Hence in method they are tempestuous\r\nand disordered; voluble, violent, and lax in style. They reveal intense\r\nzeal and pugnacity, a mind at once spacious in ideals and intolerant\r\nin application, a rich fancy, and a capacious scholarship. They lack\r\nhumor, proportion, and restraint; but in spite of these defects they\r\nare among the greatest controversial compositions in the language. A\r\nshort extract will illustrate some of the Miltonic features:\r\n\r\n   I deny not but that it is of greatest concernment in the Church\r\n   and Commonwealth, to have a vigilant eye how books demean\r\n   themselves as well as men; and thereafter to confine, imprison,\r\n   and do sharpest justice on them as malefactors: for books are\r\n   not absolutely dead things, but do contain a potency of life\r\n   in them to be as active as that soul was whose progeny they\r\n   are; nay, they do preserve as in a vial the purest efficacy and\r\n   extraction of that living intellect that bred them. I know they\r\n   are as lively, and as vigorously productive, as those fabulous\r\n   dragons’ teeth; and being sown up and down, may chance to\r\n   spring up armed men. And yet on the other hand, unless wariness\r\n   be used, as good almost kill a man as kill a good book; who\r\n   kills a man kills a reasonable creature, God’s image; but he\r\n   who destroys a good book, kills reason itself, kills the image\r\n   of God as it were in the eye. Many a man lives a burden to the\r\n   earth; but a good book is the precious life-blood of a master\r\n   spirit, embalmed and treasured up on purpose to a life beyond\r\n   life.\r\n                                                      _Areopagitica_\r\n\r\n\r\n=3. His Poetry.= The great bulk of Milton’s poetry was written during\r\ntwo periods separated from each other by twenty years: (_a_) the period\r\nof his university career and his stay at Horton, from 1629 to 1640; and\r\n(_b_) the last years of his life, from about 1660 to 1674. The years\r\nbetween were filled by a few sonnets.\r\n\r\n(_a_) While still an undergraduate Milton began to compose poems of\r\nremarkable maturity and promise. They include the fine and stately\r\n_Ode on the Morning of Christ’s Nativity_ (1629), and the poems _On\r\nShakespeare_ (1630) and _On Arriving at the Age of Twenty-three_\r\n(1631). These poems show Milton’s command of impressive diction and\r\nhis high ideals, both literary and religious. While at Horton (1634)\r\nhe composed _L’Allegro_ and _Il Penseroso_, two longish poems in\r\noctosyllabic couplets dealing with the respective experiences of\r\nthe gay and thoughtful man. The pieces are decorative rather than\r\ndescriptive, artificial rather than natural, but they are full of\r\nscholarly fancy and adroit poetical phrasing. _Comus_ (1637) belongs to\r\nthis period, and is a masque containing some stiff but beautiful blank\r\nverse and some quite charming lyrical measures. _Lycidas_ (1637) is an\r\nelegy on his friend Edward King, who was drowned on a voyage to Ireland.\r\n\r\n_Lycidas_, which is to be reckoned as among the highest of Milton’s\r\nachievements, is something quite new in English poetry. In form it\r\nis pastoral, but this artificial medium serves only to show the\r\npower of Milton’s grip, which can wring from intractable material\r\nthe very essence of poetry. The elegy has the color and music of the\r\nbest Spenserian verse; but it has a climbing majesty of epithet and\r\na dignified intensity of passion that Spenser does not possess. Its\r\nmeter is an irregular stanza-sequence and rhyme-sequence of a peculiar\r\nhaunting beauty.\r\n\r\n    For, so to interpose a little ease,\r\n    Let our frail thoughts dally with false surmise;\r\n    Ay me! whilst thee the shores and sounding seas\r\n    Wash far away,--where’er thy bones are hurled,\r\n    Whether beyond the stormy Hebrides\r\n    Where thou perhaps, under the whelming tide,\r\n    Visitest the bottom of the monstrous world;\r\n    Or whether thou, to our moist vows denied,\r\n    Sleep’st by the fable of Bellerus old,\r\n    Where the great Vision of the guarded mount\r\n    Looks towards Namancos and Bayona’s hold....\r\n\r\n(_b_) This period (1660–74) gives us the poetry of the matured Milton.\r\nThe work of the middle years is composed of a few sonnets. These, with\r\nsome others written at different times, sufficiently show Milton’s\r\ncommand of the Italian form, which he uses throughout. He gives it a\r\nsweep and sonorous impressiveness that set him alone beside Wordsworth,\r\nwho in this respect is his poetical successor. The best of Milton’s\r\nsonnets are _On his Blindness_ and _On the Late Massacre in Piedmont_.\r\n\r\nThe great work of this time is _Paradise Lost_. It was begun as\r\nearly as 1658, and issued in 1667. At first it was divided into ten\r\nbooks or parts, but in the second edition it was redivided into twelve.\r\nIn form it follows the strict unity of the classical epic; in theme it\r\ndeals with the fall of man; but by means of introduced narratives it\r\ncovers the rebellion of Lucifer in heaven, the celestial warfare, and\r\nthe expulsion of the rebels. In conception the poem is spacious and\r\ncommanding; it is sumptuously adorned with all the detail that Milton’s\r\nrich imagination, fed with classical and Biblical lore, can suggest;\r\nthe characters, especially that of Lucifer, are drawn on a gigantic\r\nscale, and do not lack a certain tragic immensity; and the blank\r\nverse in which the work is composed is new and wonderful. This type\r\nof blank verse has founded a tradition in English; it has often been\r\nimitated and modified, but never paralleled. It lacks the suppleness\r\nof the Shakespearian measure; but it is instinct with beauty and\r\nscholarly care. It is almost infinite in modulation; varied cunningly\r\nin scansion, in pause, in cadence, and in sonorous dignity of music.\r\nIt has its lapses into wordiness and bombast, but the lapses are few\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\nIn the following extract the construction of the blank verse should be\r\ncarefully observed. The variation of foot, pause, and melody is worthy\r\nof the closest study.\r\n\r\n      No sooner had the Almighty ceased, but all\r\n    The multitude of angels, with a shout\r\n    Loud as from numbers without number, sweet\r\n    As from blest voices, uttering joy, Heaven rung\r\n    With jubilee, and loud hosannas filled\r\n    The eternal regions. Lowly reverent\r\n    Towards either throne they bow, and to the ground,\r\n    With solemn adoration, down they cast\r\n    Their crowns inwove with amarant and gold--\r\n    Immortal amarant, a flower which once\r\n    In Paradise, fast by the tree of life,\r\n    Began to bloom; but soon for man’s offence\r\n    To Heaven removed, where first it grew, there grows,\r\n    And flowers aloft, shading the fount of life,\r\n    And where the river of bliss, through midst of Heaven,\r\n    Rolls o’er Elysian flowers her amber stream.\r\n\r\nIn 1671 Milton issued his last volume of poetry, which contained\r\n_Paradise Regained_ and _Samson Agonistes_. The former poem, which\r\ntells of Christ’s temptation and victory, is complementary to the\r\nearlier epic, and Milton hoped that it would surpass its predecessor.\r\nIn this his hopes were dashed. It is briefer and poorer than _Paradise\r\nLost_; it lacks the exalted imagination, the adornment, and the ornate\r\nrhythms of the earlier poem. There is little action, the characters are\r\nuninteresting, and the work approaches _Paradise Lost_ only in a few\r\noutstanding passages.\r\n\r\n_Samson Agonistes_, which tells of Samson’s death while a prisoner\r\nof the Philistines, has a curious interest, for in the Biblical hero\r\nMilton saw more than one resemblance to himself. In form the work\r\nhas the strict unity of time, place, and action universal in Greek\r\ntragedy. In style it is bleak and bare, in places harsh and forbidding;\r\nbut in several places Milton’s stubborn soul is wrung with pity and\r\nexalted by the hope that looks beyond. The speech of Samson’s father\r\nover his dead son is no inappropriate epitaph for Milton himself:\r\n\r\n    Come, come, no time for lamentation now,\r\n    Nor much more cause; Samson hath quit himself\r\n    Like Samson, and heroically hath finished\r\n    A life heroic, on his enemies\r\n    Fully revenged, hath left them years of mourning,\r\n    To himself and father’s house eternal fame;\r\n    And, which is best and happiest yet, all this\r\n    With God not parted from him, as was feared,\r\n    But favouring and assisting to the end.\r\n    Nothing is here for tears, nothing to wail\r\n    Or knock the breast, no weakness, no contempt,\r\n    Dispraise, or blame, nothing but well and fair,\r\n    And what may quiet us in a death so noble.\r\n\r\n=4. Features of his Poetry.= (_a_) _The Puritan Strain._ All through\r\nhis life Milton’s religious fervor was unshaken. Even his enemies did\r\nnot deny his sincerity. It is seen even in one of his earliest sonnets:\r\n\r\n    All is, if I have grace to use it so,\r\n    As ever in my great Taskmaster’s eye.\r\n\r\nIt persists even to the end, when it runs deeper and darker. In\r\n_Paradise Lost_, for example, his chief motive is to “justify the ways\r\nof God to men.”\r\n\r\nThis religious tendency is apparent in (1) the choice of religious\r\nsubjects, especially in the later poems; (2) the sense of\r\nresponsibility and moral exaltation; (3) the fondness for preaching and\r\nlecturing, which in _Paradise Lost_ is a positive weakness; (4)\r\nthe narrowness of outlook, strongly Puritanical, seen in his outbursts\r\nagainst his opponents (as in _Lycidas_), in his belief regarding\r\nthe inferiority of women, and in his scorn for the “miscellaneous\r\nrabble.”\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The Classical Strain._ Curiously interwoven with the\r\nseverity of his religious nature is a strong bent for the classics,\r\nwhich is pagan and sensuous. His learning was wide and matured;\r\nhe wrote Latin prose and verse as freely as he wrote English. His\r\nclassical bent is apparent in (1) his choice of classical and\r\nsemi-classical forms--the epic, the Greek tragedy, the pastoral, and\r\nthe sonnet; (2) the elaborate descriptions and enormous similes in\r\n_Paradise Lost_; (3) the fondness for classical allusion, which\r\nruns riot through all his poetry; (4) the dignity of his style, and its\r\nprecision and care. His very egoism takes a high classical turn. In his\r\nblindness he compares himself with\r\n\r\n    Blind Thamyris and blind Mæonides,\r\n    And Tiresias and Phineus, prophets old.\r\n\r\nIn his choice of diction we have the classical element abundantly\r\napparent; and, lastly, the same element appears in the typical Miltonic\r\ngrandeur and frigidity, the arrogant aloofness from men and mortals.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _His Poetical Genius._ As a poet Milton is not a great innovator;\r\nhis function is rather to refine and make perfect. Every form he\r\ntouches acquires a finality of grace and dignity. The epic, the ode,\r\nthe classical drama, the sonnet, the masque, and the elegy--his\r\nachievements in these have never been bettered and seldom approached.\r\nAs a metrist he stands almost alone. In all his meters we observe the\r\nsame ease, sureness, and success.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _His Position in Literature._ In literature Milton occupies an\r\nimportant central or transitional position. He came immediately after\r\nthe Elizabethan epoch, when the Elizabethan methods were crumbling\r\ninto chaos. His hand and temper were firm enough to gather into one\r\nsystem the wavering tendencies of poetry, and to give them sureness,\r\naccuracy, and variety. The next generation, lacking the inspiration\r\nof the Elizabethans, found in him the necessary stimulus to order and\r\naccuracy; and from him, to a great extent, sprang the new “classicism”\r\nthat was to be the rule for more than a century.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER POETS\r\n\r\n=1. Abraham Cowley (1618–67)= was born in London, the son of a wealthy\r\ncitizen. He was educated at Westminster School and at Cambridge, where\r\nhe distinguished himself as a classical scholar. In the Civil War he\r\nwarmly supported the King; followed the royal family into exile, where\r\nhe performed valuable services; returned to England at the Restoration;\r\nand for the remainder of his life composed books in retirement.\r\n\r\nCowley, even more than Pope and Macaulay, is the great example of\r\nthe infant prodigy. When he was ten he wrote a long epical romance,\r\n_Piramus and Thisbe_ (1628), and two years later produced an even\r\nlonger poem called _Constantia and Philetus_ (1630). All through his\r\nlife he was active in the production of many kinds of work--poems,\r\nplays, essays, and histories. His best-known poem was _The Davideis_\r\n(1637), a rather dreary epic on King David, in heroic couplets. Other\r\npoems were _The Mistress_ (1647), a collection of love-poems, and the\r\n_Pindarique Odes_, which are a curious hybrid between the early freedom\r\nof the Elizabethans and the classicism of the later generation. His\r\nprose works included his _Essays_ and _Discourse concerning Oliver\r\nCromwell_ (1661).\r\n\r\nBoth in prose and poetry Cowley was a man of various methods, showing\r\nthe wavering moods of the transitional poet. His heroic couplets and\r\nirregular odes foreshadow the vogue of the approaching “correctness”;\r\nhis essays, in their pleasant egoism and miscellaneous subject-matter,\r\nsuggest Addison; and his prose style, plain and not inelegant, draws\r\nnear to the mode of Dryden. His variety pleased many tastes; hence the\r\npopularity that was showered upon him during his day. But he excelled\r\nin no particular method; and hence the partial oblivion that has\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n=2. The Metaphysical Poets.= The works of this group of poets have\r\nseveral features in common: (i) the poetry is to a great extent\r\nlyrical; (ii) in subject it is chiefly religious or amatory; (iii)\r\nthere is much metrical facility, even in complicated lyrical stanzas;\r\n(iv) the poetic style is sometimes almost startling in its sudden\r\nbeauty of phrase and melody of diction, but there are unexpected turns\r\nof language and figures of speech (hence the name of the group).\r\n\r\n(_a_) =Robert Herrick (1591–1674)= was born in London, and educated at\r\nWestminster School and at Cambridge, where he lived for fourteen years.\r\nHe was appointed to a living in Devonshire, where he died.\r\n\r\nHis two volumes of poems are _Noble Numbers_ (1647) and _Hesperides_\r\n(1648). Both are collections of short poems, sacred and profane. In\r\nthem he reveals lyrical power of a high order; fresh, passionate, and\r\nfelicitously exact, but at the same time meditative and observant.\r\nHerrick was strongly influenced by Jonson and the classics; he\r\ndelighted in the good things of this world; but that did not prevent\r\nhis having a keen enjoyment of nature and a fresh outlook upon life.\r\nAmong the best known of his shorter pieces are _To Anthea_, _To Julia_,\r\nand _Cherry Ripe_.\r\n\r\n(_b_) =George Herbert (1593–1633)= was born at Montgomery Castle,\r\neducated at Westminster School and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where\r\nhe was appointed Fellow and reader, took holy orders, and was given in\r\nturn livings near Huntingdon and at Bemerton, near Salisbury.\r\n\r\nNone of his poems was published during his lifetime. On his death-bed\r\nhe gave to a friend the manuscript of _The Temple_, a collection\r\nof religious poems in various meters. The poems, of a high quality, are\r\ninspired with a devout piety which is often fantastically expressed and\r\nquaintly figured. His poetry is not so “metaphysical” as that of some\r\nothers of his group; but neither does it rise to the great heights that\r\nthey sometimes achieve.\r\n\r\n(_c_) =Richard Crashaw (1613–50)=, the son of a clergyman, was born\r\nin London, and educated at the Charterhouse and at Cambridge. During\r\nthe Civil War, in which he was a strong Royalist, he was compelled to\r\nescape to France, where he became a Roman Catholic. At a later stage he\r\nwent to Rome and to Loretto. At the latter place he died and was buried.\r\n\r\nCrashaw represents the best and the worst of the Metaphysical poets.\r\nAt his best he has an energy and triumphant rapture that, outside the\r\npoems of Shelley, are rarely equaled in English; at his worst he is\r\nshrill, frothy, and conceited. His style at its best is harmonious,\r\nprecise, and nobly elevated; at its worst it is disfigured by\r\nobscurity, perversity, and unseemly images. His chief work is _Steps\r\nto the Temple_ (1646).\r\n\r\nWe quote an extract to show the exalted mood to which his poetry can\r\nascend:\r\n\r\n    Live in these conquering leaves; live all the same;\r\n    And walk through all tongues one triumphant flame;\r\n    Live here, great heart;[124] and love, and die, and kill;\r\n    And bleed, and wound, and yield, and conquer still.\r\n    Let this immortal life where’er it comes\r\n    Walk in a crowd of loves and martyrdoms.\r\n    Let mystic deaths wait on’t; and wise souls be\r\n    The love-slain witnesses of this life of thee.\r\n    O sweet incendiary! show here thy art,\r\n    Upon this carcase of a hard cold heart....\r\n    Oh thou undaunted daughter of desires!\r\n    By all thy power of lights and fires;...\r\n    By all thy brim-filled bowls of fierce desire;\r\n    By thy last morning’s draught of liquid fire;\r\n    By the full kingdom of that final kiss\r\n    That seized thy parting soul, and sealed thee his;...\r\n    Leave nothing of myself in me.\r\n                                      _The Flaming Heart_\r\n\r\n(_d_) =Henry Vaughan (1622–95)= was born in Wales, and was descended\r\nfrom an ancient family. He went to London to study law, then turned to\r\nmedicine, and practiced at Brecon. His books include _Poems_ (1646),\r\n_Olor Iscanus_ (1647), _Silex Scintillans_ (1650), and _Thalia\r\nRediviva_ (1678).\r\n\r\nVaughan’s love-poems, though they are often prettily and sometimes\r\nbeautifully phrased, are inferior to his religious pieces, especially\r\nthose in _Silex Scintillans_. His religious fervor is nobly\r\nimaginative, and strikes out lines and ideas of astonishing strength\r\nand beauty. His regard for nature, moreover, has a closeness and\r\npenetration that sometimes (for example, in _The Retreat_)\r\nsuggests Wordsworth.\r\n\r\n(_e_) =Thomas Carew (1595–1645)= was born in Kent, educated at Oxford,\r\nand studied law in the Middle Temple. He attained to some success as\r\na courtier, but later died in obscurity. The date of his death is\r\nuncertain, but it was probably 1645.\r\n\r\nHis _Poems_ (1640) show his undoubted lyrical ability. The pieces\r\nare influenced by Donne and Jonson, but they have a character of their\r\nown. The fancy is warmly colored, though it is marred by license and\r\nbad taste. We quote a lyric which can be taken as representative of\r\nthe best of its kind. Its fancy is too rich and beautiful to be called\r\nfantastic, and its golden felicity of diction is rarely equaled.\r\n\r\n    Ask me no more where Jove bestows,\r\n    When June is past, the fading rose,\r\n    For in your beauty’s orient deep\r\n    These flowers, as in their causes, sleep.\r\n\r\n    Ask me no more whither do stray\r\n    The golden atoms of the day,\r\n    For, in pure love, heaven did prepare\r\n    Those powders to enrich your hair.\r\n\r\n    Ask me no more whither doth haste\r\n    The nightingale when May is past,\r\n    For in your sweet dividing throat\r\n    She winters and keeps warm her note.\r\n\r\n    Ask me no more if east or west\r\n    The phœnix builds her spicy nest,\r\n    For unto you at last she flies,\r\n    And in your fragrant bosom dies.\r\n\r\n=3.= The =Cavalier poets= are lyrical poets, and deal chiefly with love\r\nand war.\r\n\r\n(_a_) =Richard Lovelace (1618–58)= was born at Woolwich, was\r\neducated at the Charterhouse and at Oxford, and became an officer in\r\nthe King’s household. When the Civil War broke out he was imprisoned\r\nby the Roundheads; and, being liberated on parole, could do little\r\nactively to assist Charles. At a later stage he saw some soldiering in\r\nFrance, returned to England, and died in obscure circumstances.\r\n\r\nHis volume _Lucasta_ (1649) contains the best of his shorter pieces,\r\nwhich had appeared at different times previously. He is essentially the\r\npoet of attractive scraps and fancies, elegantly and wittily expressed.\r\nSome of his lyrics, such as _To Althea, from Prison_ and _To Lucasta,\r\nGoing to the Wars_, have retained their popularity.\r\n\r\n(_b_) =Sir John Suckling (1609–42)= was born in Middlesex, and at\r\nthe age of eighteen fell heir to a large fortune. He was educated at\r\nOxford, traveled on the Continent, served as a volunteer under Gustavus\r\nAdolphus, and became a favorite of Charles I. He was implicated\r\nin Royalist plots, and escaped abroad (1640), where he died under\r\nconditions that are somewhat mysterious.\r\n\r\nTo some extent (for he seems to have lacked physical courage) Suckling\r\nwas the cavalier of the romances and the Restoration plays--gay,\r\ngenerous, and witty. His poems largely reflect these characteristics.\r\nAs a poet he has great ability, but he is usually the elegant amateur,\r\ndisdaining serious and sustained labor. Some of his poems, such as the\r\n_Ballad upon a Wedding_ (see p. 186), and “Why so pale and wan,\r\nfond lover?” show the tricksy elegance that is his chief attraction.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAMA\r\n\r\n=1. Philip Massinger (1583–1640)= was born at Salisbury, educated\r\nat Oxford, and became a literary man in London, writing plays for the\r\nKing’s Men, a company of actors. If we may judge from his begging\r\nletters that survive, he found in dramatic work little financial\r\nencouragement. He died and was buried in London.\r\n\r\nMassinger did much hack-work, and was fond of working out topical and\r\nmoral themes; so that a large amount of his work is of little permanent\r\nimportance. The best of his many plays are _A New Way to Pay Old\r\nDebts_ (1625) and _The City Madam_ (1632), two quite fine comedies;\r\nand _The Duke of Milan_ (1618) and _The Unnatural Combat_ (1619),\r\nquite respectable tragedies. The level of Massinger’s workmanship is\r\nlaudably high; he is remarkably uniform in quality; and in a few cases\r\n(as in that of Sir Giles Overreach in _A New Way to Pay Old Debts_) he\r\nhas created characters of real distinction. He followed the fashion of\r\nthe time in collaborating with other dramatists. _The Virgin Martyr_,\r\nproduced jointly with Dekker, is perhaps the most important of this\r\nclass of play.\r\n\r\n=2. John Ford (1586–1640)= was born in Devonshire, educated at Oxford,\r\nand studied, though he seems never to have practiced, law. He became an\r\nactive producer of plays, chiefly tragedies, both on his own account\r\nand in collaboration with other playwrights.\r\n\r\nIn his nature Ford had a morbid twist which gave him a strange liking\r\nfor the horrible and the unnatural. His plays are unequal in quality;\r\nbut the most powerful of them are prevented from being revolting by\r\ntheir real tragic force and their high literary aims. In _The Broken\r\nHeart_ (acted in 1629) he harrows the reader’s feelings almost beyond\r\nendurance; his _Perkin Warbeck_ (1634), a historical tragedy, is\r\nreckoned to be the best historical drama outside of Shakespeare; and\r\nin _The Witch of Edmonton_ (about 1633) he collaborated with Dekker\r\nand Rowley to produce a powerful domestic drama. Others of the sixteen\r\nplays attributed to him are _The Lover’s Melancholy_ (1629), _Love’s\r\nSacrifice_ (1633), and _The Fancies Chaste and Noble_ (1638).\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR THOMAS BROWNE (1605–82)\r\n\r\nBrowne may be taken as representative of the best prose-writers of the\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= He was born in London, educated at Winchester and\r\nOxford, and studied medicine. For a time he practiced in Oxfordshire;\r\nthen he traveled abroad, receiving his degree of M.D. at Leyden.\r\nReturning to London (1634), he soon removed to Norwich, where for the\r\nremainder of his life he successfully practiced as a doctor.\r\n\r\n=2. His Works.= Almost alone among his contemporaries, Browne seems to\r\nhave been unaffected by the commotions of the time. His prose works,\r\nproduced during some of the hottest years of civil contention, are\r\ntranquilly oblivious of unrest. His books are only five in number, are\r\nindividually small in size, and are of great and almost uniform merit.\r\n_Religio Medici_ (1642), his confession of faith, is a curious mixture\r\nof credulity and skepticism; _Pseudodoxia Epidemica_, or _Vulgar\r\nErrors_ (1646), shared the same mental inconsistency, resembles the\r\nwork of Burton in its out-of-the-way learning; _Hydriotaphia or Erne\r\nBuriall_ (1658), commonly considered to be his masterpiece, contains\r\nreflections on human mortality induced by the discovery of some ancient\r\nfuneral urns; _The Garden of Cyrus_ (1658) is a treatise on the\r\nquincunx. The last work, _Christian Morals_, was published after his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n=3. His Style.= As a philosopher Browne is either obscure and\r\nconfusing, as in _Religio Medici_, or unoriginal and obvious, as in\r\n_Hydriotaphia_. His learning, though it is wide and accurate, is too\r\nfar-fetched and strange to be of much practical use. But as a literary\r\nstylist he is very valuable indeed. He shows the ornate style of\r\nthe time in its richest bloom. His diction is strongly Latinized,\r\nsometimes to the limit of obscurity; and he has the scholastic habit\r\nof introducing Latin tags and references. In this he resembles Burton;\r\nbut in other respects he is far beyond the author of _The Anatomy of\r\nMelancholy_. His sentences are carefully wrought and artistically\r\ncombined into paragraphs; and, most important from the purely literary\r\npoint of view, the diction has a richness of effect unknown among other\r\nEnglish prose-writers. The rhythm is harmonious, and finishes with\r\ncarefully attuned cadences. The prose is sometimes obscure, rarely\r\nvivacious, and hardly ever diverting; but the solemnity and beauty\r\nof it have given it an enduring fascination. A brief extract will\r\nillustrate some of its qualities:\r\n\r\n   Pious spirits who passed their days in raptures of futurity,\r\n   made little more of this world, than the world that was before\r\n   it, while they lay obscure in the chaos of preordination, and\r\n   night of their fore-beings. And if any have been so happy\r\n   as truly to understand Christian annihilation, ecstasies,\r\n   exolution, liquefaction, transformation, the kiss of the spouse,\r\n   gustation of God, and ingression into the divine shadow, they\r\n   have already had an handsome anticipation of heaven; the glory\r\n   of the world is surely over, and the earth in ashes unto them.\r\n\r\n   To subsist in lasting monuments, to live in their productions,\r\n   to exist in their names and predicament of chimeras, was large\r\n   satisfaction unto old expectations, and made one part of their\r\n   Elysiums. But all this is nothing in the metaphysics of true\r\n   belief. To live, indeed, is to be again ourselves, which being\r\n   not only an hope, but an evidence in noble believers, ’tis all\r\n   one to lie in St Innocent’s churchyard, as in the sands of\r\n   Egypt. Ready to be anything, in the ecstasy of being ever, and\r\n   as content with six foot as the _moles_ of Adrianus.\r\n                                                   _Hydriotaphia_\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER PROSE-WRITERS\r\n\r\n=1. Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon (1609–74)=, was born in Wiltshire,\r\neducated at Oxford, and studied law. A man of excellent address, he\r\nwas a successful lawyer, and became a member of the House of Commons.\r\nAt first he was attached to the Parliamentary side, but he separated\r\nfrom the party on account of their attitude to the Church. He changed\r\nover to the Royalists, and thenceforward became one of the foremost\r\nadvocates of the King’s cause. After the downfall of the Royalists he\r\naccompanied the young Charles into exile; and at the Restoration he\r\nwas appointed Lord Chancellor and raised to the peerage as Earl of\r\nClarendon. He was too severe for the frivolous Restoration times, was\r\nexiled (1667), and died in France. His body was buried in Westminster\r\nAbbey.\r\n\r\nHis great work, _The History of the Great Rebellion_, was begun as\r\nearly as 1646 and finished during the years of his last exile. It was\r\nnot published till 1704. To some extent the work is based on his own\r\nknowledge of the struggle; it lacks proportion and complete accuracy;\r\nbut the narrative is strong and attractive, and it contains masterly\r\ncharacter-sketches of some of the chief figures in the struggle. It\r\nis composed in long, lumbering sentences, loaded with parentheses\r\nand digressions, but the style is readable. It is the most important\r\nEnglish work of a historical nature up to the date of its issue.\r\n\r\n=2. Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679)= was born at Malmesbury, and was the\r\nson of a clergyman. He finished his education at Oxford, and became\r\ntutor to the future Earl of Devonshire. He supported the Royalist\r\ncause, was exiled by the Roundheads, and at the Restoration was awarded\r\na pension. The remainder of his long life was devoted to literature.\r\n\r\nHobbes took an active part in the intellectual broils of the period,\r\nand much of his work is violently contentious. His chief book was\r\n_The Leviathan_ (1651), which expounded his political theories.\r\nThe ardor of his opinions embroiled him with both of the chief\r\npolitical parties, but the abuse that it occasioned gave the book an\r\nimmense interest. The style in which it is written is hard, clear, and\r\naccurate--almost the ideal medium for sustained exposition and argument.\r\n\r\n=3. Jeremy Taylor (1613–67)= is the most prominent literary divine\r\nof the period. The son of a barber, he was born and educated at\r\nCambridge, though latterly he removed to Oxford. Taking holy orders,\r\nhe distinguished himself as an ardent expounder of the Royalist cause,\r\nand for a time he was imprisoned by the Parliamentary party. At the\r\nRestoration he was rewarded by being appointed to the Irish bishoprics\r\nof Down and Dromore. He died in Ireland.\r\n\r\nA learned, voluble, and impressive preacher, Taylor carried the same\r\nqualities into his prose works, which consisted of tracts, sermons,\r\nand theological books. His most popular works, in addition to his\r\ncollections of sermons, were _The Liberty of Prophesying_ (1647),\r\n_Holy Living_ (1650), and _Holy Dying_ (1651). In his writings he is\r\nfond of quotations and allusions and of florid, rhetorical figures,\r\nsuch as simile, exclamation, and apostrophe; and his language, built\r\ninto long, stately, but comprehensible sentences, is abundant,\r\nmelodious, and pleasing.\r\n\r\n=4. Thomas Fuller (1608–61)= was born in Northamptonshire, his\r\nfather being a clergyman. He was educated at Cambridge, and took holy\r\norders. He received various appointments, and by his witty sermons\r\nattracted the notice of Charles I. During the Civil War he was a\r\nchaplain to the Royalist forces; but when his side was defeated he made\r\nhis peace with the Parliamentary party and was permitted to carry on\r\nhis literary labors. He died the year after the Restoration.\r\n\r\nFuller had an original and penetrating mind, a wit apt for caustic\r\ncomment, and an industry that remained unimpaired till the end of his\r\nlife. His literary works are therefore of great interest and value.\r\nHis serious historical books include _The History of the Holy\r\nWar_ (1639), dealing with the Crusades, and _The Church-History\r\nof Britain_ (1655). Among his pamphlets are _Good Thoughts in\r\nBad Times_ (1645), and _An Alarum to the Counties of England and\r\nWales_ (1660). The work that has given him his reputation is his\r\n_Worthies of England_, published by his son in 1662. It shows his\r\npeculiar jocosity at its best.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF LITERARY FORMS\r\n\r\n=1. Poetry.= (_a_) _The Lyric._ The period is rich in lyrical poetry\r\nof a peculiar kind. The theme is chiefly love or religion. Most of the\r\nlove-poems are dedicated to ladies of the usual literary convention,\r\nsuch as Althea, Celia, and Phyllis, who both in name and nature\r\nresemble the stock characters of the artificial pastoral poetry. The\r\nlanguage addressed to such creations cannot be that of deep and genuine\r\npassion; it is rather that of polite compliment, verbal quibble, or\r\ncourtly jest. This type of lyric is a charming literary exercise,\r\nbut hardly the inspired searching of the lover’s heart. We have\r\nalready noticed the poems of Herrick, Lovelace, and Carew as being\r\nrepresentative of this class. To these names may be added those of\r\n=George Wither (1588–1667)=, who writes freshly and sweetly, =Andrew\r\nMarvell (1621–78)=, who sometimes reveals real passion, and the\r\nnumerous miscellaneous songwriters, mostly anonymous, who in inspired\r\nmoments could produce such charming lyrics as “Phillada flouts me.”\r\n\r\nThe religious lyric, on the other hand, as we can see in the case\r\nof Crashaw and Vaughan, is frequently passionately inspired; but\r\nthe passions are vaguely expressed; and we have commented upon the\r\nincongruity that frequently disfigures the style. In the case of Milton\r\nhis lyrics are superbly phrased, but they too lack spontaneity. His\r\nsonnets, among the noblest of their class, have much more depth of\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The Epic._ The true epic treats of a sublime subject in the\r\ngrand manner. In some respects _Beowulf_ is an epic, but strictly\r\nspeaking the epic does not appear till this age. Cowley’s _Davideis_\r\n(1637) and Davenant’s _Gondibert_ (1651) aspire to be great epics; but\r\nthough they subscribe to the rules governing the outward form of the\r\nspecies they lack the inner spirit and they are failures. Milton’s\r\n_Paradise Lost_ (1658) has the heat and inspiration, but the Puritan\r\nbias in his nature led him to the rather unsuitable subject of the fall\r\nof man. It is unsuitable because it is weak in heroic action. Much more\r\nappropriate would have been the story of King Arthur, which for a long\r\ntime he thought of using. Otherwise Milton’s treatment of the subject\r\nis strictly orthodox. Nominally at least he adheres to the epical unity\r\nof action; he draws his characters with a wide sweep; and the style is\r\na triumph of English epical style. His _Paradise Regained_ (1671) is\r\nworked out on the same lines, but it is shorter and weaker than the\r\nearlier epic.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _The Ode._ In Spenser’s _Epithalamion_ and _Prothalamion_ we\r\nhave seen the irregular ode attain to a high degree of perfection. In\r\nthis age we observe the appearance of the Pindaric ode, which was to\r\nbe so popular in the succeeding generations. Though it appears to be\r\nirregular, the Pindaric ode is really bound by stringent rules; its\r\nlanguage is ornately artificial; and its diction mannered and unreal.\r\nTherefore it is suited to the needs of a transitional period that\r\ndesires artificiality with a show of freedom. Cowley’s _Pindarique\r\nOdes_ (1656) are the first of their class in English.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Descriptive and Narrative Poetry._ In this wide class we may\r\ninclude Milton’s _L’Allegro_ and _Il Penseroso_, Herrick’s pastoral\r\npoems, and Crashaw’s religious-descriptive pieces. To these may\r\nbe added the _Cooper Hill_ (1641) of =Sir John Denham (1615–69)=,\r\na descriptive poem much praised in its day, and the romantic poem\r\n_Pharonnida_ (1659) by =William Chamberlayne (1619–89)=. In all these\r\npoems we may observe the growing tendency to avoid contact with actual\r\nwild nature, and to seek rather the conventional and bookish landscapes\r\nfamiliar in the more artificial classical authors. Already the new\r\nclassicism is declaring itself.\r\n\r\n=2. Drama.= Earlier in this chapter we have noticed the decline and\r\ntemporary collapse of the drama (1642). The plays of Massinger sustain\r\nthe expiring spirit of the great Elizabethans; those of Ford follow\r\nthe tragical school of Webster and Tourneur. Other playwrights are\r\n=James Shirley (1596–1666)=, who wrote some pleasing comedies of London\r\nlife, such as _The Lady of Pleasure_ (1637), and the feebler writers\r\n=Suckling= and =Davenant=.\r\n\r\n=3. Prose.= While the period is almost devoid of narrative prose of the\r\nlighter sort, it is quite rich in prose of other kinds.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _The Sermon._ This period has been called “the Golden Age of the\r\nEnglish pulpit.” No doubt the violent religious strife of the time\r\nhas much to do with the great flow of sermon writing, which is marked\r\nwith eloquence, learning, and strong argument. In addition to Jeremy\r\nTaylor and Fuller, already mentioned, we may notice =Robert South\r\n(1634–1716)=, who writes rather more briefly and simply than the rest,\r\n=Isaac Barrow (1630–77)=, learned and copious, and =Richard Baxter\r\n(1615–91)=, a Nonconformist, whose _Saints’ Everlasting Rest_ (1649)\r\nhas survived all his preachings.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Philosophical Works._ On the moral side there are the works\r\nof Sir Thomas Browne; on the political those of Hobbes; and on the\r\nreligious side the books of =John Hales (1584–1656)=. Works of this\r\ntype show a growing knowledge and advancing scholarship, joined\r\nsometimes to quaint conceits and artless credulity.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Historical Works._ In this class Clarendon’s and Fuller’s works\r\nstand pre-eminent. The development of the history will be noticed in a\r\nfuture chapter (see p. 340).\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Miscellaneous Prose._ In this large and varied group may be\r\nincluded the pamphlets of Milton, Hobbes, Fuller, and many more;\r\nthe attractive books of =Isaac Walton (1593–1683)=, whose _Compleat\r\nAngler_ (1653) is the classic of its kind; the interesting _Resolves_,\r\nshort miscellaneous essays, of =Owen Felltham (1602–68)=; and the\r\n_Letters_ (1645), an early type of essay-journalism, of =James Howell\r\n(1594–1666)=.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF LITERARY STYLE\r\n\r\n=1. Poetry.= In surveying the poetical style of the age one is aware of\r\nconflicting tendencies, a state of affairs quite in keeping with the\r\ntransitional nature of the time.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The _lyrical style_ shows a decline from the natural splendors\r\nof the Elizabethan age; but it shows an increase in care, in polish,\r\nand in actual metrical dexterity. Moreover, in the best examples of the\r\ntime we find a melodious resonance and beauty that is quite peculiar\r\nto the period. The lyric of Carew quoted on p. 172 illustrates this\r\nfelicity both of sound and expression. The startling “metaphysical”\r\nquality of the works of many of the poets has been commented upon. It\r\nis revealed at its worst in the works of =John Cleveland (1613–58)=,\r\nwhose more violent efforts came to be known as “_Clevelandisms_.” The\r\nfollowing is a mild example of his manner:\r\n\r\n    The flowers, called out of their beds,\r\n    Start and raise up their drowsy heads;\r\n    And he that for their colour seeks,\r\n    Will find it mantling in her cheeks,\r\n    Where roses mix; no civil war\r\n    Between her York and Lancaster.\r\n    The marigold, whose courtier face\r\n    Echoes the sun, and doth unlace\r\n    Her at his rise, at his full stop\r\n    Packs and shuts up her gaudy shop,\r\n    Mistakes her cue, and doth display:\r\n    Thus Phillis antedates the day.\r\n            _On Phillis, walking before Sunrise_\r\n\r\n(_b_) In _blank verse_ conflicting movements are also apparent. In\r\nMilton the style reaches a magnificent climax. But in the drama,\r\nespecially in the drama of minor playwrights of the ability of Suckling\r\nand Davenant, it becomes a huddle of verse and prose, so bad that one\r\nhesitates to say where the verse ends and the prose begins. It is the\r\nlast stage of poetical decrepitude.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The _heroic couplet_ begins to appear, ushering in its long\r\nreign. We have it appearing as early as Spenser’s _Shepherd’s Calendar_\r\n(1579) and Sandys’s _Ovid_ (1626); but the true stopped couplet, as\r\nused by Dryden and developed by Pope, is usually set down to the credit\r\nof Cowley’s _Davideis_ (1637), or Denham’s _Cooper’s Hill_ (1641),\r\nor the shorter poems of =Edmund Waller (1606–87)=, who wrote stopped\r\ncouplets as early as 1623.

The principal\r\nmovement is toward ornate prose, in Browne, Jeremy Taylor, Clarendon,\r\nand in the Scottish writer =William Drummond (1585–1649)=, whose\r\n_Cypress Grove_ (1616) is in the fashionable funereal vein. In the\r\nmiddle style we have the precision of Hobbes in _The Leviathan_. At the\r\nother extreme from the ornate, the miscellaneous writers adopt great\r\nsimplicity. Of this class, which includes Howell and Fe11tham, the best\r\nexample is Isaac Walton, whose artless prose is shown in the following\r\nspecimen:\r\n\r\n   _Piscator._ O sir, doubt not but that angling is an art.\r\n   Is it not an art to deceive a trout with an artificial fly? a\r\n   trout that is more sharp-sighted than any hawk you have named,\r\n   and more watchful and timorous than your high-mettled merlin\r\n   is bold! and yet I doubt not to catch a brace or two to-morrow\r\n   for a friend’s breakfast. Doubt not, therefore, sir, but that\r\n   angling is an art, and an art worth your learning; the question\r\n   is rather, whether you be capable of learning it? for angling\r\n   is somewhat like poetry, men are to be born so--I mean with\r\n   inclinations to it, though both may be heightened by discourse\r\n   and practice; but he that hopes to be a good angler must not\r\n   only bring an inquiring, searching, observing wit, but he must\r\n   bring a large measure of hope and patience, and a love and\r\n   propensity to the art itself; but having once got and practised\r\n   it, then doubt not but angling will prove to be so pleasant that\r\n   it will prove to be like virtue, a reward to itself.\r\n                                              _The Compleat Angler_\r\n\r\n\r\n                               EXERCISES\r\n\r\n1. The following extracts illustrate the good and bad features of the\r\n“metaphysical” style in poetry. Comment upon each feature as it appears\r\nto you, and estimate the value of the style as a literary medium.\r\n\r\n    (1) Our two souls therefore, which are one,\r\n          Though I must go, endure not yet\r\n        A breach, but an expansion,\r\n          Like gold to airy thinness beat.\r\n\r\n      If they be two, they are two so\r\n        As stiff twin compasses are two,\r\n      Thy soul, the fix’d foot, makes no show\r\n        To move, but doth, if th’ other do.\r\n\r\n      And though it in the centre sit,\r\n        Yet when the other far doth roam,\r\n      It leans and hearkens after it,\r\n        And grows erect as that comes home.\r\n\r\n        Such wilt thou be to me, who must\r\n          Like th’ other foot obliquely run,\r\n        Thy firmness makes my circle just,\r\n          And makes me end where I begun.\r\n              DONNE, _A Valediction forbidding Mourning_\r\n\r\n    (2) But at my back I always hear\r\n        Time’s winged chariot hurrying near,\r\n        And yonder all before us lie\r\n        Deserts of vast eternity.\r\n        Thy beauty shall no more be found,\r\n        Nor, in thy marble vault, shall sound\r\n        My echoing song: then worms shall try\r\n        That long preserved virginity,\r\n        And your quaint honour turn to dust,\r\n        And into ashes all my lust:\r\n        The grave’s a fine and private place,\r\n        But none, I think, do there embrace.\r\n                          MARVELL, _To his Coy Mistress_\r\n\r\n    (3) When, like committed linnets, I\r\n          With shriller throat shall sing\r\n        The sweetness, mercy, majesty,\r\n          And glories of my King;\r\n        When I shall voice aloud, how good\r\n          He is, how great should be,\r\n        Enlarged winds that curl the flood\r\n          Know no such liberty.\r\n\r\n        Stone walls do not a prison make,\r\n          Nor iron bars a cage;\r\n        Minds innocent and quiet take\r\n          That for an hermitage;\r\n        If I have freedom in my love,\r\n          And in my soul am free,\r\n        Angels alone, that soar above,\r\n          Enjoy such liberty.\r\n                     LOVELACE, _To Althea, from Prison_\r\n\r\n    (4) Each little pimple had a tear in it,\r\n        To wail the fault its rising did commit.\r\n             DRYDEN, _Upon the Death of the Lord Hastings_\r\n\r\n    (5) The plants, whose luxury was lopped,\r\n        Or age with crutches underpropped,\r\n        Whose wooden carcases are grown\r\n        To be but coffins of their own,\r\n        Revive, and at her general dole,\r\n        Each receives his ancient soul.\r\n                                       CLEVELAND\r\n\r\n    (6) Her finger was so small, the ring,\r\n        Would not stay on, which they did bring,\r\n          It was too wide a peck:\r\n        And to say the truth (for out it must)\r\n        It looked like the great collar (just)\r\n          About our young colt’s neck.\r\n\r\n        Her feet beneath her petticoat,\r\n        Like little mice, stole in and out,\r\n          As if they feared the light:\r\n        But O, she dances such a way!\r\n        No sun upon an Easter-day\r\n          Is half so fine a sight.\r\n\r\n        Her cheeks so rare a white was on,\r\n        No daisy makes comparison,\r\n          (Who sees them is undone),\r\n        For streaks of red were mingled there,\r\n        Such as are on a Catherine pear\r\n            The side that’s next the sun.\r\n                      SUCKLING, _A Ballad upon a Wedding_\r\n\r\n2. Compare the following examples of Milton’s earlier and later blank\r\nverse respectively. Observe the metrical dexterity, the cadence, and\r\nthe vowel-music.\r\n\r\n    (1) They left me then, when the gray-hooded even,\r\n        Like a sad votarist in palmer’s weed\r\n        Rose from the hindmost wheels of Phœbus’ wain.\r\n        But where they are, and why they came not back,\r\n        Is now the labour of my thoughts; ’tis likeliest\r\n        They had engaged their wandering steps too far;\r\n        And envious darkness, ere they could return,\r\n        Had stole them from me: else, O thievish night,\r\n        Why shouldst thou, but for some felonious end,\r\n        In thy dark lantern thus close up the stars,\r\n        That nature hung in heaven, and filled their lamps\r\n        With everlasting oil, to give due light\r\n        To the misled and lonely traveller?\r\n                                                      _Comus_\r\n\r\n    (2) Then feed on thoughts, that voluntary move\r\n        Harmonious numbers; as the wakeful bird\r\n        Sings darkling, and in shadiest covert hid,\r\n        Tunes her nocturnal note. Thus with the year\r\n        Seasons return; but not to me returns\r\n        Day, or the sweet approach of even or morn,\r\n        Or sight of vernal bloom, or summer’s rose,\r\n        Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine;\r\n        But cloud instead, and ever-during dark\r\n        Surrounds me, from the cheerful ways of men\r\n        Cut off, and for the book of knowledge fair,\r\n        Presented with a universal blank\r\n        Of nature’s works to me expung’d and ras’d,\r\n        And wisdom at one entrance quite shut out.\r\n                                                    _Paradise Lost_\r\n\r\n3. The following paragraph is fairly typical both of the prose of\r\nJeremy Taylor and of that of the period in general. Point out the good\r\nand bad qualities of the style, and estimate its value.\r\n\r\n   Anger is a perfect alienation of the mind from prayer, and\r\n   therefore is contrary to that attention which presents our\r\n   prayers in a right line to God. For so have I seen a lark rising\r\n   from his bed of grass, and soaring upwards, singing as he\r\n   rises, and hopes to get to heaven, and climb above the clouds;\r\n   but the poor bird was beaten back with the loud sighings of an\r\n   eastern wind, and his motion made irregular and inconstant,\r\n   descending more at every breath of the tempest than it could\r\n   recover by the libration and frequent weighing of his wings,\r\n   till the little creature was forced to sit down and pant, and\r\n   stay till the storm was over; and then it made a prosperous\r\n   flight, and did rise and sing, as if it had learned music and\r\n   motion from an angel, as he passed sometimes through the air,\r\n   about his ministries here below. So is the prayer of a good\r\n   man: when his affairs have required business, and his business\r\n   was matter of discipline, and his discipline was to pass upon a\r\n   sinning person, or had a design of charity, his duty met with\r\n   the infirmities of a man, and anger was its instrument; and the\r\n   instrument became stronger than the prime agent, and raised a\r\n   tempest, and overruled the man; and then his prayer was broken,\r\n   and his thoughts were troubled, and his words went up towards a\r\n   cloud; and his thoughts pulled them back again, and made them\r\n   without intention; and the good man sighs for his infirmity, but\r\n   must be content to lose that prayer, and he must recover it when\r\n   his anger is removed, and his spirit is becalmed, made even as\r\n   the brow of Jesus, and smooth like the heart of God; and then it\r\n   ascends to heaven upon the wings of the holy dove, and dwells\r\n   with God, till it returns, like the useful bee, laden with a\r\n   blessing and the dew of heaven.\r\n                                         JEREMY TAYLOR, _On Prayer_\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Explain the references in the following passages. What parts of\r\nMilton’s character and literary works are emphasized?\r\n\r\n    (1)   Nor second he, that rode sublime\r\n        Upon the seraph-wings of Ecstasy,\r\n        The secret of th’ abyss to spy.\r\n          He passed the flaming bounds of place and time--\r\n        The living throne, the sapphire-blaze,\r\n        Where angels tremble while they gaze,\r\n        He saw; but, blasted with excess of light,\r\n        Closed his eyes in endless night.\r\n                               GRAY, _The Progress of Poesy_\r\n\r\n    (2) Milton! thou shouldst be living at this hour.[131]\r\n          England hath need of thee: she is a fen\r\n          Of stagnant waters; altar, sword, and pen,\r\n        Fireside, the heroic wealth of hall and bower,\r\n        Have forfeited their ancient English dower\r\n          Of inward happiness.

The Restoration (1660).= The Restoration of Charles II brought\r\nabout a revolution in our literature. With the collapse of the Puritan\r\nGovernment there sprang up activities that had been so long suppressed\r\nthat they flew to violent excesses. The Commonwealth had insisted on\r\ngravity and decorum in all things; the Restoration encouraged a levity\r\nthat often became immoral and indecent. Along with much that is sane\r\nand powerful, this latter tendency is prominent in the writing of the\r\ntime, especially in the comedies.\r\n\r\n=2. The Religious Question.= The strength of the religious-political\r\npassions of the time is reflected in the current literature. The\r\nreligion of the King was suspect; that of his brother James was\r\navowedly Papist; and James was the heir-apparent to the crown. There\r\nwas a prevalent suspicion of the Catholics, which, though it might have\r\nbeen groundless, was of such depth and intensity that it colors all\r\nthe writings of the time. The lies of Titus Oates added to the popular\r\nfrenzy, so that when the Earl of Shaftesbury sought to exclude James\r\nfrom the throne and supplant him by the Duke of Monmouth it needed all\r\nthe efforts of Charles (himself secretly a Roman Catholic) to save\r\nhis brother. The famous poem of Dryden, _Absalom and Achitophel_, is\r\nan outstanding example of a kind of poem that abounded during those\r\ntroubled years.\r\n\r\n=3. The Revolution (1688).= James succeeded to the throne in 1685;\r\nbut so soon did he reveal his Roman Catholic prejudices that he was\r\nrejected in three years and was replaced by Protestant sovereigns.\r\nHenceforth religious passions diminish in intensity; and the literature\r\nof the succeeding years tends to emphasize the political rather than\r\nthe religious side of public affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW CLASSICISM\r\n\r\nBy the year 1660 Elizabethan romanticism had all but spent itself. Of\r\nthe great figures of the earlier era only one survived, John Milton,\r\nand he had still to write _Paradise Lost_; but in everything Milton was\r\nof the past. At the Restoration he retired and worked in obscurity, and\r\nhis great poem reveals no signs of the time in which his later years\r\nwere cast.\r\n\r\nAt the Restoration the break with the past was almost absolute. It\r\ninvolved our literature in the deepest degree; subject and style took\r\non a new spirit and outlook, a different attitude and aim. Hence a\r\npost-Restoration period is often set up as the converse and antithesis\r\nof the previous Elizabethan age. It is called _classical_, as opposed\r\nto the Elizabethan _romanticism_. Though the contrast between the two\r\nepochs need not be over-emphasized, yet the differences are very great.\r\nLet us see in what respects the new spirit is shown.\r\n\r\n=1. Imitation of the Ancients.= Lacking the genius of the Elizabethans,\r\nthe authors of the time turned to the great classical writers, in\r\nparticular to the Latin writers, for guidance and inspiration. This\r\nhabit, quite noticeable during the time of Dryden, deepened and\r\nhardened during the succeeding era of Pope--so much so that the latter\r\nlaid down as a final test of excellence\r\n\r\n    Learn hence for ancient rules a just esteem;\r\n    To copy nature is to copy them.\r\n\r\n=2. Imitation of the French.= Charles II had spent most of his years\r\nof exile in France, and when he returned to England he brought with\r\nhim a new admiration for French literature. In particular the effects\r\nof this penetrated very deeply into the drama, especially into comedy,\r\nthe most copious literary product of the Restoration. Of French comedy\r\nthe great Molière was the outstanding exponent, and his influence was\r\nvery great. In the more formal tragedy French and classical models were\r\ncombined to produce a new type called the _heroic play_. The type is\r\nwell represented by Dryden’s _Tyrannic Love_.\r\n\r\n=3. The “Correct” School.= The Elizabethans too had drawn upon the\r\nancients, but they used their gains freely and joyously, bending the\r\nwork of the classical authors to their own wills. The imitative work\r\nof the new school was of a frigid and limited quality. The school\r\nof Dryden was loath to alter; the age of Pope abandoned freedom\r\naltogether. Pope puts it thus:\r\n\r\n    Those Rules of old, discovered, not devised,\r\n    Are Nature still, but Nature methodised.\r\n\r\nThus they evolved a number of “rules,” which can usefully be summarized\r\nin the injunction “Be correct.” “Correctness” means avoidance of\r\nenthusiasm; modern opinions moderately expressed; strict care and\r\naccuracy in poetical technique; and humble imitation of the style of\r\nthe Latin classics.\r\n\r\nDryden did not attain altogether to this ideal. Pope and his immediate\r\nsuccessors called him “copious,” thus hinting at a lack of care and\r\nan unrestrained vigor that were survivals of an earlier virility. Yet\r\nDryden has the new tendency very clearly marked. To him Dr. Johnson\r\nfirst applied the epithet “Augustan,” saying that Dryden did to English\r\nliterature what Augustus did to Rome, which he “found of brick and left\r\nof marble.” Dryden is the first great exponent of the new ideas that\r\nwere to dominate our literature till the end of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN DRYDEN (1631–1700)\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= Dryden’s life was a long one. It was, in addition,\r\nan exceedingly fruitful one. For forty years he continued to produce\r\nan abundance of literary works of every kind--poems, plays, and prose\r\nworks. The quality of it was almost unfailingly good, and at the end of\r\nhis life his poetry was as fresh and vivacious as it had been in the\r\nprime of his manhood.\r\n\r\nOf Dryden it can be said without qualification that he is\r\nrepresentative of his age. Indeed, it has been urged as a fault against\r\nhis character that he adapted himself with too facile a conscience to\r\nthe changing fortunes of the times. His earliest work of any importance\r\nis pre-Restoration, and consists of a laudation of Oliver Cromwell. At\r\nthe Restoration he changed his views, attaching himself to the fortunes\r\nof Charles II and to the Church of England. This loyalty brought its\r\nrewards in honors and pensions, so that for many years Dryden was\r\neasily the most considerable literary figure in the land. Yet his\r\ncareer was not without its thorns, for smaller men were busy with\r\ntheir slanders. On the accession of James II in 1685 Dryden changed\r\nhis faith and political persuasion, becoming a Roman Catholic. To his\r\nnew beliefs he adhered steadfastly, even when in 1688 the Revolution\r\nbrought certain disasters to such public men as adhered to Catholicism.\r\nThus Dryden lost his posts of Poet Laureate and Historiographer Royal.\r\nThe Laureateship was conferred on Shadwell, his most rancorous foe; and\r\nDryden retired with dignity to sustain his last years with his literary\r\nlabors. To this last period of his career we owe some of his finest\r\ntranslations and narrative poems. When he died in 1700 he was accorded\r\na splendid funeral in Westminster Abbey, though it was many years\r\nbefore his grave was marked by a tombstone.\r\n\r\n=2. His Poetry.= Dryden began his life’s work with poetry; he\r\nconcluded it with poetry; and the years between are starred with\r\nthe brightness of his greater poems. As early as February, 1664,\r\nPepys records in his diary that he met “Mr. Dryden, the poet”; and\r\nhe remained “Mr. Dryden, the poet,” till the day of his death. It is\r\ntherefore as a poet that Dryden is chiefly to be judged.\r\n\r\nHis first published poem of any consequence was a series of heroic\r\nstanzas on the death of the Protector Oliver Cromwell (1659). It\r\nconsists of thirty-seven quatrains of no particular merit. They\r\nmove stiffly, and are quite uninspired by any political or personal\r\nenthusiasm, but they show a certain angular force and a little metrical\r\ndexterity. Two stanzas will show the art of the earliest Dryden:\r\n\r\n    His grandeur he derived from Heaven alone,\r\n      For he was great, ere Fortune made him so;\r\n    And wars, like mists that rise against the sun,\r\n      Made him but greater seem, not greater grow.\r\n\r\n    No borrowed bays his temples did adorn,\r\n      But to our crown he did fresh laurels bring;\r\n    Nor was his virtue poisoned, soon as born,\r\n      With the too early thoughts of being king.\r\n\r\nIn 1660 he made a great step forward in poetical craftsmanship by\r\npublishing _Astrœa Redux_, in celebration of Charles II’s return. The\r\npoem represents a complete reversal of the poet’s political opinions;\r\nbut it is nevertheless a noteworthy literary advance. In its handling\r\nof the subject it shows a firmer grip and stronger common sense; in\r\nits style a new command of sonorous and dignified phrasing; and (as\r\nimportant a feature as any of the others) it is written in the heroic\r\ncouplet.\r\n\r\n    Methinks I see those crowds on Dover’s strand,\r\n    Who in their haste to welcome you to land\r\n    Choked up the beach with their still growing store,\r\n    And made a wilder torrent on the shore.\r\n\r\nHere we see Dryden, though not yet at his best, coming to his own. The\r\ncouplet marches with a steady but animated ring and swing. Its phrasing\r\nis apt and vivid; and it possesses a strength and music that are new.\r\nIt marks the beginning of that adherence to the use of the couplet\r\nwhich was to be Dryden’s lifelong habit, and which was to mark a new\r\nepoch in our literature.\r\n\r\nTwo other poems of this year--one on the coronation and one addressed\r\nto the Chancellor, Clarendon,--resemble _Astrœa Redux_ in their main\r\nfeatures, and are little inferior.\r\n\r\nIn 1666 he produced _Annus Mirabilis_, dealing with the extraordinary\r\nevents of the year, particularly the Fire of London and the Dutch\r\nwar. The poem is long, and often dull. When he attempts “style” he\r\nis sometimes florid and ridiculous. Moreover, the meter returns to\r\nthe quatrain. The work is inferior to those of 1660, but is still an\r\nadvance on the stanzas to Cromwell.\r\n\r\nFor more than fifteen years succeeding this Dryden devoted himself\r\nalmost entirely to the writing of plays. Then, about 1680, events both\r\npolitical and personal drove him back to the poetical medium, with\r\nresults both splendid and astonishing. Political passions over the\r\nExclusion Bills were at their height, and Dryden appeared as the chief\r\nliterary champion of the monarchy in the famous satirical allegory\r\n_Absalom and Achitophel_ (1681). Absalom is the Duke of Monmouth,\r\nthe unfortunate aspirant to the succession; and Achitophel is his\r\ndaring but injudicious counselor Shaftesbury. These two are surrounded\r\nby a cluster of lesser politicians, upon each of whom Dryden bestows\r\na Biblical name of deadly aptness and transparency. The satire is of\r\namazing force and range, rarely stooping to scurrility, but punishing\r\nits victims with devastating scorn and a wrathful aloofness; and it\r\ntakes shape in the best quality of Dryden’s couplet. Long practice in\r\ndramatic couplet-writing had now given Dryden a new metrical facility,\r\ntightening and strengthening the measure, and giving it crispness and\r\nenergy without allowing it to become violent and obscure. We give a\r\nspecimen of this measure, which in many ways represents the summit of\r\nDryden’s poetical achievement:\r\n\r\n    Of these the false Achitophel was first;\r\n    A name to all succeeding ages curst:\r\n    For close designs and crooked counsels fit;\r\n    Sagacious, bold, and turbulent of wit;\r\n    Restless, unfixed in principles and place;\r\n    In power unpleased, impatient of disgrace:\r\n    A fiery soul, which, working out its way,\r\n    Fretted the pigmy body to decay,\r\n    And o’er-informed the tenement of clay.\r\n    A daring pilot in extremity;\r\n    Pleased with the danger when the waves went high,\r\n    He sought the storms; but, for a calm unfit,\r\n    Would steer too nigh the sands to boast his wit.\r\n    Great wits are sure to madness near allied,\r\n    And thin partitions do their bounds divide;\r\n    Else why should he, with wealth and honour blest,\r\n    Refuse his age the needful hours of rest?\r\n    Punish a body which he could not please;\r\n    Bankrupt of life, yet prodigal of ease?\r\n    And all to leave what with his toil he won,\r\n    To that unfeathered two-legged thing--a son.\r\n\r\nOf such satire as this Dryden himself says not unfairly, “It is not\r\nbloody, but it is ridiculous enough. I avoided the mention of great\r\ncrimes, and applied myself to the representing of blind sides and\r\nlittle extravagances.” The hitting is hard, but not foul.\r\n\r\nNext year he produced another political poem, _The Medal_, which called\r\nforth an answer from an old friend of Dryden’s, Shadwell. Dryden\r\nretorted in _MacFlecknoe_, a personal lampoon of gigantic power and\r\nferocity, but degraded with much coarseness and personal spite. A\r\nsimilar poem is the second part of _Absalom and Achitophel_, to which\r\npoem Dryden contributed a violent attack on Shadwell, giving him the\r\nname of Og. The main part of the work was composed by Nahum Tate, a\r\nsatellite of Dryden’s.\r\n\r\nA new poetical development was manifest in _Religio Laici_ (1682)\r\nand _The Hind and the Panther_ (1687). The first poem is a thesis in\r\nsupport of the English Church; the second, written after the accession\r\nof James, is an allegorical defense of the Roman Catholic faith.\r\nAlterations like these in Dryden’s opinions gave free play to the\r\ngibes of his enemies. In spite of their difference in opinion, these\r\npoems have much in common: a clear light of argument, a methodical\r\narrangement of ideas, and a mastery of the couplet that often lifts\r\nthe drabness of the expository theme into passages of noble feeling\r\nand splendor. The allegorical treatment of _The Hind and the Panther_\r\nallows of a livelier handling; but the poem is very long, consisting of\r\nmore than one part, and much of it is dogmatic assertion and tedious\r\nargument.\r\n\r\nAfter the Revolution, when he was driven from his public appointments,\r\nDryden occupied himself chiefly with translations. He once more used\r\nthe couplet medium, turning Virgil, Ovid, and Boccaccio into English,\r\nand adapting Chaucer to the taste of his time. The translation is so\r\nfree that much of it is Dryden’s own, and all of it teems with his own\r\nindividuality. We give a passage to illustrate both the latest phase of\r\nhis couplet and his power as a narrative poet:\r\n\r\n    Scarce the third glass of measured hours was run,\r\n    When like a fiery meteor sunk the sun,\r\n    The promise of a storm; the shifting gales\r\n    Forsake by fits and fill the flagging sails;\r\n    Hoarse murmurs of the main from far were heard,\r\n    And night came on, not by degrees prepared,\r\n    But all at once; at once the winds arise,\r\n    The thunders roll, the forky lightning flies.\r\n    In vain the master issues out commands,\r\n    In vain the trembling sailors ply their hands;\r\n    The tempest unforeseen prevents their care,\r\n    And from the first they labour in despair.\r\n    The giddy ship betwixt the winds and tides,\r\n    Forced back and forwards, in a circle rides,\r\n    Stunned with the different blows; then shoots amain,\r\n    Till counterbuffed she stops, and sleeps again.\r\n                                        _Cymon and Iphigenia_\r\n\r\nThough it is small in bulk, Dryden’s lyrical poetry is of much\r\nimportance. The longest and the best-known pieces of this class are his\r\n_Song for St. Cecilia’s Day_ (1687) and _Alexander’s Feast_, written\r\nfor the same anniversary in 1697. Both show Dryden as a master of\r\nmelodious verse and of a varied and powerful style. The numerous lyrics\r\nthat appear in his plays are charming. One stanza will illustrate this\r\nsweetly facile phase of the poet’s art:\r\n\r\n    On a bank, beside a willow,\r\n    Heaven her covering, earth her pillow,\r\n    Sad Amynta sighed alone;\r\n    From the cheerless dawn of morning\r\n    Till the dews of night returning,\r\n    Singing thus she made her moan:\r\n            “Hope is banished,\r\n            Joys are vanished,\r\n    Damon, my beloved, is gone!”\r\n\r\nHis numerous prologues and epilogues, written in couplets, show\r\nabundant wit and vivacity, yet they habitually appeal to the worst\r\ninstincts of his audiences, being very often coarse and unmannerly.\r\n\r\n=3. His Drama.= In his dramatic work, as elsewhere, Dryden is a\r\nfaithful reflex of his time. His methods and objects vary as the public\r\nappreciation of them waxes and wanes, with the result that he gives us\r\na historical summary of the popular fancy.\r\n\r\nHis first play was a comedy, _The Wild Gallant_ (1663), which had but\r\na very moderate success. It has the complicated plot of the popular\r\nSpanish comedies and the “humors” of Jonson’s. After this unsuccessful\r\nattempt at public favor Dryden turned to tragedy, which henceforth\r\nnearly monopolizes his dramatic work.\r\n\r\nHis tragedies fall into two main groups:\r\n\r\n(_a_) _The Heroic Play._ This is a new type of the tragedy that\r\nbecame prominent after the Restoration, and of which Dryden is one of\r\nthe earliest and most skillful exponents. The chief features of the\r\nnew growth are the choice of a great heroic figure for the central\r\npersonage; a succession of stage incidents of an exalted character,\r\nwhich often, through the inexpertness of the dramatist, became\r\nridiculous; a loud and ranting style; and the rhymed couplet. Dryden’s\r\n_Rival Ladies_ (1663) is a hybrid between the comic and heroic species\r\nof play; _The Indian Emperor_ (1665), _Tyrannic Love_ (1669), _The\r\nConquest of Granada_ (1670), and _Aurengzebe_ (1675) show the heroic\r\nkind at its best and worst. Though Dryden is heavily weighted with the\r\nponderous mechanism of the heroic play, his gigantic literary strength\r\nis often sufficient to give it an attraction and a kind of heavy-footed\r\nanimation.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _His Blank-verse Tragedies._ The heroic play was so easily\r\nparodied and made ridiculous, that the wits of the Restoration were\r\nnot slow to make a butt of it. Their onslaughts were not without their\r\neffect on Dryden, for already in _Aurengzebe_ a shamefaced weakening of\r\nthe heroic mannerisms is apparent. In the prologue to this play Dryden\r\nfairly admits it, saying that he\r\n\r\n    Grows weary of his long-loved mistress, Rime.\r\n    Passion’s too fierce to be in fetters bound,\r\n    And Nature flies him like enchanted ground.\r\n\r\nHis next play, _All for Love, or The World well Lost_ (1678), is in\r\nblank verse, and is considered to be his dramatic masterpiece. For\r\nsubject he chose that of Shakespeare’s _Antony and Cleopatra_. It\r\nwas a daring thing to attempt what Shakespeare had already done; but\r\nDryden, while following the earlier play somewhat closely, never\r\nactually copies it. He produces a play of a distinctly different\r\nnature, and of a high merit. The characters are well drawn and\r\nanimated, and the style, though lacking the daimonic force of\r\nShakespeare’s at his best, is noble and restrained. We give Dryden’s\r\nhandling of the death of Cleopatra, a passage which should be compared\r\nwith that of Shakespeare given on p. 121.\r\n\r\n   (_Antony is lying dead on the stage; Charmion and Iras, the\r\n        Queen’s two handmaidens, are in attendance on her._)\r\n\r\n    _Charmion._              To what end\r\n        These ensigns of your pomp and royalty?\r\n\r\n    _Cleopatra._ Dull that thou art! Why, ’tis to meet my love;\r\n        As when I saw him first, on Cydnos’ bank,\r\n        All sparkling, like a goddess....\r\n                                      Haste, haste, both,\r\n        And dress the bride of Antony.\r\n\r\n    _Charmion._                    ’Tis done.\r\n\r\n    _Cleopatra._ Now seat me by my lord; I claim this place....\r\n        Reach me the casket.\r\n\r\n    _Iras._              Underneath the fruit\r\n        The aspic lies.\r\n\r\n    _Cleopatra._    Welcome, thou kind deceiver!\r\n\r\n                                  [_Putting aside the leaves._\r\n\r\n        Thou best of thieves, who with an easy key\r\n        Dost open life, and, unperceived by us,\r\n        Even steal us from ourselves....\r\n        Haste, bare my arm, and rouse the serpent’s fury.\r\n\r\n                       [_Holds out her arm, and draws it back._\r\n\r\n        Coward flesh,\r\n        Wouldst thou conspire with Cæsar to betray me,\r\n        As thou wert none of mine? I’ll force thee to it,\r\n        And not be sent by him,\r\n        But bring, myself, my soul to Antony.\r\n\r\n                       [_Turns aside, and then shows her arm bloody._\r\n\r\n        Take hence; the work is done....\r\n\r\n    _Charmion._                      The next is ours.\r\n\r\n    _Iras._ Now, Charmion, to be worthy\r\n        Of our great queen and mistress.\r\n\r\n                                          [_They apply the aspics._\r\n\r\n    _Cleopatra._ Already, death, I feel thee in my veins:\r\n        I go with such a will to find my lord,\r\n        That we shall quickly meet.\r\n        A heavy numbness creeps through every limb,\r\n        And now ’tis at my head: my eyelids fall,\r\n        And my dear love is vanquished in a mist.\r\n        Where shall I find him, where? O turn me to him,\r\n        And lay me on his breast! Cæsar, thy worst;\r\n        Now part us, if thou canst.        [_Dies._\r\n\r\n                 [_Iras sinks down at her feet, and dies; Charmion\r\n                 stands behind her chair, as dressing her head._\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the Revolution he wrote _Don Sebastian_ (1690), _Cleomenes_\r\n(1691), and _Love Triumphant_ (1694). The last was a tragi-comedy and\r\na failure. The other two, however, were quite up to the average of his\r\nplays. In addition, at various stages of his career he collaborated\r\nwith Lee in two other tragedies, and attempted, with lamentable\r\nresults, to improve upon Shakespeare’s _Tempest_ and _Troilus and\r\nCressida_.\r\n\r\n=4. His Prose.= Dryden’s versatility is apparent when we observe\r\nthat in prose, as well as in poetry and drama, he attains to primacy\r\nin his generation. In the case of prose he has one rival, John Bunyan.\r\nNo single item of Dryden’s prose work is of very great length; but in\r\nhis _Essay of Dramatic Poesie_ (1668), in his numerous dedicatory\r\nepistles and prefaces, and in the scanty stock of his surviving letters\r\nwe have a prose _corpus_ of some magnitude. The general subject\r\nof his prose is literary criticism, and that of a sane and vigorous\r\nquality. The style is free, but not too free; there are slips of\r\ngrammar, but they are not many. The _Essay of Dramatic Poesie_\r\nis his longest single prose work. It is cast into dialogue form, in\r\nwhich four characters, one of whom is Dryden himself, discuss such\r\nwell-worked themes as ancients _versus_ moderns and blank verse\r\n_versus_ rhyme. Studded throughout the book are passages of rare\r\nability, one of which is the following, which illustrates not only his\r\nprose style, but also his acute perception of literary values:\r\n\r\n   To begin, then, with Shakespeare. He was the man who, of all\r\n   modern and perhaps ancient poets, had the largest and most\r\n   comprehensive soul. All the images of nature were still present\r\n   to him, and he drew them not laboriously, but luckily; when\r\n   he describes anything, you more than see it, you feel it too.\r\n   Those who accuse him to have wanted learning, give him the\r\n   greater commendation. He was naturally learned; he needed not\r\n   the spectacles of books to read nature; he looked inwards and\r\n   found her there. I cannot say he is everywhere alike; were he\r\n   so, I should do him injury to compare him with the greatest\r\n   of mankind. He is many times flat, insipid; his comic wit\r\n   degenerating into clenches, his serious swelling into bombast.\r\n   But he is always great when some great occasion is presented to\r\n   him; no man can say he ever had a fit subject for his wit, and\r\n   did not then raise himself as high above the rest of poets,\r\n                   _Quantum lenta solent inter viburna cupressi._\r\n                                          VIRG., _Ecl., i, 26_\r\n\r\n\r\nRESTORATION COMEDY\r\n\r\nIn comedy alone Dryden showed a certain incapacity; his mind seemed to\r\nbe too rugged and unresilient to catch the sharper moods of the current\r\nwit. Fortunately this weakness of his was atoned for by the activities\r\nof a brilliant group of dramatists who made Restoration comedy a thing\r\napart in English literature.\r\n\r\nThe new comedy, of a slower growth than the new heroic play, owed\r\nmuch of its inspiration to French comedy. It marked a new stage in\r\nthe civilization of England. The plays of the Shakespearian era were\r\nbeginning to be thought out of date. In his diary Evelyn notes that\r\n“the old plays begin to disgust this refined age.” Though the age was\r\nno doubt refined in certain respects, it was also decadent, and this\r\ndecadent spirit is reflected in its comedy.\r\n\r\nThe novel features of the type are:\r\n\r\n(_a_) The theme is mainly of courtiers and their class, their vices and\r\naffectations, their love-intrigues and money-grabbing. The characters\r\nare still to a great extent those of the “humorsome” quality so common\r\nin the time of Jonson. Their names reveal their dispositions: Sir\r\nFopling Flutter; Scrub (a servant); Colonel Bully; Sir John Brute;\r\nSquire Sullen; Gibbet (a highwayman); Lady Bountiful. Such characters\r\nas these are involved in plots of great and unnatural complication,\r\nwith much bustle and unlimited love-intrigue. In rare cases, as in some\r\nof the plays of Shadwell, the characters are much more human and the\r\nconditions more natural; and then we obtain deeply interesting glimpses\r\nof the habits of the time. But in general the whole atmosphere of the\r\ncomedies is artificial and unreal.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The prevailing love-theme is treated in a characteristic fashion\r\nwhich is fortunately rare in English. It is not handled coarsely;\r\nindeed, the age shows a ridiculous squeamishness at the grosser forms\r\nof vice; but it is handled with a cool licentiousness and a vicious\r\npleasure that are often exceedingly clever, but always repulsive. It is\r\nart, but art of a perverted kind.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The style of the comedy suits the treatment. It is prose of\r\na neat and brilliant kind: deft and forcible, clean-cut and precise.\r\nThe style of Congreve, a specimen of which is given below, is a model\r\nof its kind.\r\n\r\n=William Congreve (1670–1729).= Though Congreve is not the first in\r\ntime, he is probably the first in merit among the comedy-writers. He\r\nhad a long life, but a glance at the table at the head of the chapter\r\nwill show that only a short period of his life was productive of\r\nliterary work. His plays were produced between 1693 and 1700. The last\r\nplay was not successful, and repeated attacks were forthcoming upon his\r\ndefects, so he wrote no more.\r\n\r\nHis first comedy was _The Old Bachelor_ (1693); then came _The Double\r\nDealer_ (1693 or 1694), _Love for Love_ (1695), and _The Way of the\r\nWorld_ (1700). In 1697 he produced one tragedy, _The Mourning Bride_,\r\nwhich had no success. The earlier plays have a slight touch of\r\nseriousness, which is rarer still in the later comedies.\r\n\r\nAll are marked by the same features. The characters are numerous,\r\nbrilliant, and sharply defined. In each case, however, they are too\r\none-sided to be real; but they fulfill their purpose in the plays. The\r\nplots are full of scandalous notions delicately adumbrated; and the\r\nstyle is as keen and deadly as a sharp sword.\r\n\r\nThe following is a passage from _The Way of the World_. Two gentleman\r\nare backbiting an acquaintance.\r\n\r\n   _Fainall._ He comes to town in order to equip himself for\r\n   travel.\r\n\r\n   _Mirabell._ For travel! Why the man that I mean is above\r\n   forty.\r\n\r\n   _Fainall._ No matter for that; ’tis for the honour of\r\n   England, that all Europe should know that we have blockheads of\r\n   all ages.\r\n\r\n   _Mirabell._ I wonder there is not an act of parliament to\r\n   save the credit of the nation, and prohibit the exportation of\r\n   fools.\r\n\r\n   _Fainall._ By no means, ’tis better as ’tis; ’tis better to\r\n   trade with a little loss, than to be quite eaten up with being\r\n   overstocked.\r\n\r\n   _Mirabell._ Pray, are the follies of this knight-errant,\r\n   and those of the squire his brother, anything related?\r\n\r\n   _Fainall._ Not at all; Witwoud grows by the knight, like\r\n   a medlar grafted on a crab. One will melt in your mouth, and\r\n   t’other set your teeth on edge; one is all pulp, and the other\r\n   all core.\r\n\r\n   _Mirabell._ So one will be rotten before he be ripe, and\r\n   the other will be rotten without ever being ripe at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER COMEDY-WRITERS\r\n\r\n=1. William Wycherley (1640–1715).= The productive period of\r\nWycherley’s life was brief but fruitful. He produced four plays in five\r\nyears: _Love in a Wood_ (1672), _The Gentleman Dancing Master_ (1673),\r\n_The Country Wife_ (1675), and _The Plain Dealer_ (1677). He was a man\r\nof good family, and he was at Court, where he seems to have been no\r\nbetter than the average courtier of his time.\r\n\r\nHis contemporaries call his plays “manly.” By this they probably refer\r\nto a boisterous indecency that riots through his comedies, in which\r\nnearly every person is a fool, and every clever man a rogue and a rake.\r\nHe is much coarser in the grain than Congreve, and cannot keep his work\r\nat such a high level. Yet he shows much wit in handling dialogue, and\r\nhas a sharp, though distorted, vision for human weaknesses.\r\n\r\n=2. George Etheredge (1635–91).= Not much is known regarding the life\r\nof Etheredge; but he appears to have been a courtier, and to have\r\nserved abroad. If all stories about him are true, he had an ample\r\nshare of the popular vices. He is said to have been killed by tumbling\r\ndownstairs while drunk. His three plays are _The Comical Revenge, or\r\nLove in a Tub_ (1664), _She Would if She Could_ (1668), and _The Man of\r\nMode_ (1676). They are more uneven than Wycherley’s, and at their worst\r\nare grosser; but they are clever, and can be lively and amusing.\r\n\r\n=3. Sir John Vanbrugh (1666–1726).= Vanbrugh’s career, though much\r\nof it is obscure, seems to have been a varied one, for at different\r\ntimes he was a soldier, a herald, and an architect. His best three\r\ncomedies are _The Relapse_ (1697), _The Provoked Wife_ (1698), and _The\r\nConfederacy_ (1705).\r\n\r\nIn the general opinion Vanbrugh is held to be a good second to\r\nCongreve, but his plays are exceedingly unequal. His wit is rather more\r\ngenial than is common at this time, and sometimes his touch is firm and\r\nsure.\r\n\r\n=4. Thomas Shadwell (1640–92).= Dryden’s abuse of Shadwell has given\r\nthe latter a notoriety that he scarcely deserves. Little is known about\r\nhis life except that he was created Poet Laureate at the deposition\r\nof Dryden in 1688. He wrote many plays, some of which were popular in\r\ntheir day. The best three are _The Sullen Lovers_ (1668), _The Squire\r\nof Alsatia_ (1688), and _Bury Fair_ (1689).\r\n\r\nShadwell is coarse without being clever to atone for it. His characters\r\nare often wooden and unreal, but he has the knack of laying his hand\r\non good material. His _Squire of Alsatia_ is full of interesting\r\ninformation about the life of the time, and Scott drew largely upon it\r\nfor _The Fortunes of Nigel_.\r\n\r\n=5. George Farquhar (1678–1707).= He had an adventurous career, was in\r\nturn a clergyman, an actor, and a soldier, and died when he was thirty\r\nyears old. The pathos of his early death has given him a fame of its\r\nown. He wrote seven plays, the best of which are the last two, viz.,\r\n_The Recruiting Officer_ (1706) and _The Beaux’ Stratagem_ (1707).\r\n\r\nFarquhar comes late among the Restoration dramatists, and by this time\r\nthe cynical immorality of the age seems to have worn thin. His temper\r\nis certainly more genial, and his wit, though it has lapses, is more\r\ndecorous. _The Beaux’ Stratagem_ (see pp. 225–6) is a lively and\r\ningenious comedy with a cleverly engineered plot.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESTORATION TRAGEDY\r\n\r\nWith regard to tragedy, Dryden is amply representative of his age.\r\nThe period is less rich in tragedy than it is in comedy, for several\r\nreasons. (_a_) The spirit of the time was too irresponsible and\r\nvivacious to provide a healthy breeding-ground for this type of play.\r\n(_b_) The average poetical standard was not high; and tragedy of\r\na superior type needs a high level of poetic merit. (_c_) There\r\nwas a lack of fresh models, the tragedians being dependent on the\r\nElizabethan plays (which were not popular), and on the classical French\r\ntragedies. Yet there are a few tragedians who deserve a brief mention.\r\n\r\n=1. Thomas Otway (1651–85).= As was so often the case with the\r\ndramatists of the time, Otway had a varied and troubled career, closed\r\nwith a miserable death. His first play, _Alcibiades_, was produced\r\nabout 1675; then followed _Don Carlos_ (1676), _The Orphan_ (1680), and\r\nhis masterpiece, _Venice Preserved_ (1682).\r\n\r\n_Venice Preserved_ (see p. 226) for long held the reputation of\r\nbeing the best tragedy outside Shakespeare, and that reputation has\r\nkept it in the forefront. It shows his work at its best. It has a\r\nrugged and somber force, and reveals a considerable skill in working\r\nout a dramatic situation. But Otway tends to lay on the horrors too\r\nthickly; his style is unreliable, and his comic passages are farce of\r\nthe coarsest kind. If he is second to Shakespeare, he is a very bad\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\n=2. Nathaniel Lee (1653–92).= Lee’s life is the usual tale of mishaps,\r\nmiseries, and drunkenness, with a taint of madness as an additional\r\ncalamity. He wrote many tragedies, some of which are _Nero_ (1673),\r\n_Sophonisba_ (1676), _The Rival Queens_ (1677), and _Mithridates_\r\n(1678). He also collaborated with Dryden in the production of two\r\nplays.\r\n\r\nDuring his own time Lee’s name became a byword to distinguish a kind of\r\nwild, raving style, which in part at least seems to have been a product\r\nof his madness. But he can write well when the spirit is in him; he has\r\na command of pathos, and all through his work he has touches of real\r\npoetic quality.\r\n\r\n=3. Elkanah Settle (1648–1724).= Settle was in some ways the butt of\r\nhis literary friends, and Dryden has given him prominence by attacking\r\nhim in his satires. In his day he obtained some popularity with a\r\nheroic play, _The Empress of Morocco_ (1673). It is a poor specimen of\r\nits kind, but his other dramas are worse.\r\n\r\n=4. John Crowne (1640–1703).= Crowne is another of the dramatists who\r\nattacked Dryden and who were in turn assailed by the bigger man. A\r\nvoluminous playwright, Crowne’s best-known works are the tragedies of\r\n_Caligula_ (1698), a heroic play, and _Thyestes_, in blank verse, and a\r\ncomedy, _Sir Courtly Nice_ (1685). Crowne is quite a good specimen of\r\nthe average Restoration dramatist. The plays show considerable talent\r\nand a fair amount of skill in versification.\r\n\r\n=5. Nicholas Rowe (1674–1718).= During his lifetime Rowe was a person\r\nof some importance, and was made Poet Laureate in 1714. His best-known\r\nplays are _Tamerlane_ (1702), _The Fair Penitent_ (1703), and the\r\npopular _Jane Shore_ (1714). Johnson says of him, “His reputation comes\r\nfrom the reasonableness of some of his scenes, the elegance of his\r\ndiction, and the suavity of his verse.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPOETRY\r\n\r\n=Samuel Butler (1612–80).= Besides Dryden and the tragedy-writers the\r\nonly considerable poet of the period is Samuel Butler, and his fame\r\nrests on one work, _Hudibras_.\r\n\r\nAs a middle-aged man Butler saw the rough and tumble of the Civil\r\nWar, and was nearly fifty when the Restoration occurred. He seems to\r\nhave been of humble birth and to have served as a kind of superior\r\nmenial in a number of noble households. In the course of these several\r\noccupations he acquired the varied knowledge that he was to put to good\r\nuse in his poem. In 1663 he published _Hudibras_, which was at once a\r\nsuccess. Two other parts followed in 1664 and 1678 respectively.\r\n\r\n_Hudibras_ was topical, for it was a biting satire on the Puritans, who\r\nwere the reverse of popular when the King returned. In general outline\r\nit is modeled upon the adventures of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, who\r\nfind their respective parallels in Sir Hudibras and his squire Ralpho.\r\nSir Hudibras is a Puritan knight who undergoes many absurd adventures;\r\nbut the poem lacks the real pathos and genuine insight of its great\r\nSpanish original. It is wholly, almost spitefully, satirical. The poem\r\nis composed artfully. The adventures are well chosen in order to throw\r\nthe greatest amount of ridicule on the maladroit hero; the humor,\r\nthough keen and caustic, is never absolutely brutal in expression;\r\nthere is a freakish spattering of tropes and a mock-solemn parade of\r\nscholastic learning; and (a feature that added immeasurably to its\r\nsuccess) it is cast in an odd jigging octosyllabic couplet. This meter\r\nof _Hudibras_ is remarkable. It is varied and yet uniform, and it\r\ncarries the tale with an easy relish. Though it is sometimes almost\r\ndoggerel, it has always a kind of distinction, and each couplet is\r\nclenched with an ingenious rhyme that is the most amusing feature of\r\nall.\r\n\r\n    He was in logic a great critic,\r\n    Profoundly drilled in analytic;\r\n    He could distinguish, and divide\r\n    A hair ’twixt south and south-west side;\r\n    On either which he would dispute,\r\n    Confute, change hands, and still confute;\r\n    He’d undertake to prove by force\r\n    Of argument a man’s no horse;\r\n    He’d prove a buzzard is no fowl,\r\n    And that a lord may be an owl--\r\n    A calf, an alderman--a goose, a justice--\r\n    And rooks, committee-men and trustees.\r\n\r\n    He’d run in debt by disputation,\r\n    And pay with ratiocination:\r\n    All this by syllogism, true\r\n    In mood and figure, he would do.\r\n    For rhetoric, he could not ope\r\n    His mouth but out there flew a trope;\r\n    And when he happened to break off\r\n    I’ th’ middle of his speech, or cough,\r\n    H’ had hard words, ready to show why.\r\n    And tell what rules he did it by:\r\n    Else, when with greatest art he spoke,\r\n    You’d think he talked like other folk;\r\n    For all a rhetorician’s rules\r\n    Teach nothing but to name his tools.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROSE-WRITERS\r\n\r\n=1. John Bunyan (1628–88).= In the domain of Restoration prose\r\nBunyan alone contests the supremacy of Dryden. And Bunyan stands in a\r\nclass by himself.\r\n\r\nThe main facts of his life are well known. He himself has given them an\r\nimperishable shape in his _Grace Abounding_ (1666), a kind of religious\r\nautobiography. Though the statements of this book need not be taken too\r\nliterally, he seems to have misspent his youth. He draws a horrible\r\npicture of his own depravity; but as religious converts are well known\r\nto delight in depicting their original wickedness in the darkest\r\ncolors, this need not be taken too seriously. He served as a soldier\r\nin the Civil War, and seems to have been no better than the ordinary\r\nsoldier. Religious conversion came to him about 1656, saving him,\r\naccording to his own account, from everlasting fire. In the flood of\r\nhis new enlightenment he became a preacher, and, being unlicensed, was\r\narrested. He was cast into Bedford jail, and remained there for twelve\r\nyears (1660–72). He was released, and obtained a license; but this was\r\ncanceled in 1675, and he was imprisoned for six months. Beginning with\r\nthis latter period we have all his most famous works: _The Pilgrim’s\r\nProgress_ (1677), _The Life and Death of Mr. Badman_ (1680), and _The\r\nHoly War_ (1682). He was eventually set at liberty, and spent his last\r\nyears preaching in peace.\r\n\r\nExcept for _Grace Abounding_, all Bunyan’s major works are allegorical.\r\nIn each case the allegory is worked out with ease, force, and\r\nclearness. Readers of all ages enjoy the narrative, while they follow\r\nthe double meaning without an effort. The allegorical personages--for\r\nexample, Mr. Worldly Wiseman, Mrs. Diffidence, Giant Despair, Madame\r\nWanton, My Lord Hategood, Mr. Standfast--are fresh and apt, and are\r\nfull of an intense interest and a raw dramatic energy. Their individual\r\nadventures combine and react with a variety that keeps the story from\r\nmonotony, and yet the simple idea of a forward journey is never lost.\r\nThe plot, working upon the fortunes of the different characters,\r\ngives us the nearest approach to the pure novel that had so far been\r\neffected. The numerous natural descriptions are simply done, but they\r\nare full of a great unspoilt ability. Lastly, Bunyan’s style is unique\r\nin prose. Though it is undoubtedly based upon the great Biblical\r\nmodels, it is quite individual. It is homely, but not vulgar; strong,\r\nbut not coarse; equable, but not monotonous; it is sometimes humorous,\r\nbut it is never ribald; rarely pathetic, but never sentimental. It has\r\nremained the pattern of a plain style, and is one of the masterpieces\r\nof the English language.\r\n\r\nThe following extract gives us an idea of Bunyan’s narrative and\r\ndescriptive power, and is a fair specimen of his masculine prose:\r\n\r\n   I saw them in my dream, so far as this valley reached, there\r\n   was, on the right hand, a very deep ditch; that ditch it is\r\n   into which the blind have led the blind in all ages, and have\r\n   both there miserably perished. Again, behold, on the left hand,\r\n   there was a very dangerous quag, into which even if a good man\r\n   falls, he finds no bottom for his feet to stand on: into that\r\n   quag King David once did fall, and had no doubt therein been\r\n   smothered, had not He that is able plucked him out. The pathway\r\n   was here also exceeding narrow, and therefore good Christian was\r\n   the more put to it: for when he sought, in the dark, to shun the\r\n   ditch on the one hand, he was ready to tip over into the mire\r\n   on the other; also, when he sought to escape the mire, without\r\n   great carefulness he would be ready to fall into the ditch. Thus\r\n   he went on, and I heard him here sigh bitterly; for besides\r\n   the danger mentioned above, the pathway here was so dark, that\r\n   oft-times when he lifted up his foot to set forward, he knew\r\n   not where, or upon what, he should set it next. About the midst\r\n   of the valley I perceived the mouth of Hell to be; and it stood\r\n   also hard by the way-side. And ever and anon the flame and\r\n   smoke would come out in such abundance, with sparks and hideous\r\n   noises, that he was forced to put up his sword, and betake\r\n   himself to another weapon, called All-prayer. So he cried, in my\r\n   hearing, “O Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.” Thus he went\r\n   on a great while, yet still the flames would be reaching towards\r\n   him. Also he heard doleful voices, and rushings to and fro; so\r\n   that sometimes he thought he should be torn to pieces or trodden\r\n   down like mire in the streets.\r\n                                        _The Pilgrim’s Progress_\r\n\r\n\r\n=2. Lord Halifax (1633–95).= Halifax was an outstanding figure in the\r\nHouse of Lords during the exciting times of the Exclusion Bills, of\r\nwhich he was the chief opponent. He ranks high as an orator; as an\r\nauthor his fame rests on a small volume called _Miscellanies_. The\r\nbook contains a number of political tracts, such as _The Character of\r\na Trimmer_, and a piece of a more general character called _Advice to\r\na Daughter_. In his writings Halifax adopts the manner and attitude of\r\nthe typical man of the world: a moderation of statement, a cool and\r\nagreeably acid humor, and a style devoid of flourishes. In him we find\r\na decided approach to the essay-manner of Addison.\r\n\r\n=3. Sir William Temple (1628–99).= Temple also was a politician of\r\nsome importance, filled diplomatic posts abroad, and was a moderate\r\nsuccess in affairs at home. He is an example of the moneyed, leisured\r\nsemi-amateur in literature. He wrote little and elegantly, as a\r\ngentleman should, and patronized authors of lesser fortune and greater\r\ngenius. His best work is his _Essay on Poetry_. His style resembles\r\nthat of Halifax in its mundane, cultured reticence; but at times he\r\nhas higher flights, in which he shows some skill in the handling of\r\nmelodious and rhythmic prose.\r\n\r\n=4. John Tillotson (1630–94).= In Tillotson we have one of the popular\r\npreachers of the time, and his _Sermons_ is mentioned by Addison as\r\nbeing a standard work of its class. He is a literary descendant of the\r\ngreat school of Jeremy Taylor and Thomas Fuller, but his style lacks\r\ntheir richness and melody, though it gains in clearness and crispness.\r\n\r\n=5. The Diarists.= By a coincidence it happened that the two most\r\nfamous diary-writers in English were working at the same time, and\r\nduring this period. Not dissimilar in several respects, their works\r\nshow both the drawbacks and the advantages of the diary manner. The\r\nbooks are private documents, and so have no formal pretensions to\r\nliterary excellence in style, which is not an undiluted misfortune.\r\nYet the style is often ragged and incoherent, and much reading at it\r\nproduces a feeling of flatness and monotony. But, on the other hand,\r\nbeing private jottings, they are intimate, and so are interesting, full\r\nof information concerning public and personal affairs, and containing\r\nilluminating comments on people and incidents.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Of the two =Samuel Pepys (1633–1703)= is the less worthy as a\r\nman, but his very human quality makes him the livelier and the more\r\ninteresting. By occupation he was a kind of civil servant in the\r\nAdmiralty, and prospered so well that he became a member of Parliament\r\nand Secretary to the Admiralty. His diary, which was meant to be\r\nstrictly personal, was written in cipher, and the reading of it gives\r\none the impression of surreptitiously peeping into his back window\r\nwhen the blinds are up. By a multitude of detail the book shows Pepys\r\nto have been mean and lustful; vain and trivial; ambitious, and\r\nyet without the resolution that should attend it. Yet withal he is\r\nintensely human and alive, full of a magpie alertness; and in addition\r\nhe has the gift of inspiring in his readers the same vividness of\r\ncuriosity. We could ill spare Pepys from among those mortals who have\r\nbecome immortal in their own despite.\r\n\r\n   _May 1st, 1669_--Up betimes. Called by my tailor, and here\r\n   first put on a summer suit this year; but it was not my fine one\r\n   of flowered tabby vest and coloured camelot tunic, because it\r\n   was too fine with the gold lace at the bands, that I was afraid\r\n   to be seen in it; but put on the stuff suit I made the last\r\n   year, which is now repaired; and so did go to the office in it,\r\n   and sat all the morning, the day looking as if it would be foul.\r\n   At noon home to dinner, and there find my wife extraordinary\r\n   fine, with her flowered tabby gown that she made two years ago,\r\n   now laced exceeding pretty; and, indeed, was fine all over; and\r\n   mighty earnest to go, though the day was very lowering; and she\r\n   would have me put on my fine suit, which I did. And so anon we\r\n   went alone through the town with our new liveries of serge,\r\n   and the horses’ manes and tails tied with red ribbons, and the\r\n   standards gilt with varnish, and all clean, and green reins,\r\n   that people did mightily look upon us; and, the truth is, I did\r\n   not see any coach more pretty, though more gay, than ours all\r\n   the day.\r\n\r\n(_b_) =John Evelyn (1620–1706)= is the other diarist, and is much\r\nmore respectable and much less amusing than Pepys. His diary is a\r\nmore finished production in the matter of style, and may have been\r\nproduced with an eye on the public. The style is only moderate in\r\nquality, and has little of the freshness that distinguishes Pepys’. The\r\ndiary, however, is full of accurate information, and in some of the\r\nmore moving incidents, such as that of the Great Fire, it warms into\r\nsomething like real eloquence.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF LITERARY FORMS\r\n\r\nViewed as a whole, this period is seen to be one of transition; and,\r\nbeing so, it is to a large extent one of stagnation, time’s dead\r\nlow-water. The Elizabethan fervor had spent itself, and the new\r\nclassicism was still in the making. Yet the time is important in the\r\ndevelopment of literary forms and style.\r\n\r\n=1. Poetry.= (_a_) _The Lyric._ The form of the lyric shows little\r\nchange. In bulk it is inconsiderable, for the lyrical spirit is largely\r\nin abeyance. Outside Dryden, who is the best example of the lyrical\r\nbard, we have the slight work of the courtiers, the =Earl of Dorset\r\n(1637–1706)=, the =Earl of Rochester (1647–80)=, and =Sir Charles\r\nSedley (16391701)=. These were fashionable men, taking their poetry\r\nwith fashionable irresponsibility. Their poems, which nearly all deal\r\nwith the love-theme in an artificial manner, have a decided charm and\r\nskill, being modeled on the Caroline poems that were the mode before\r\nthe Civil War. Of real originality there is hardly a trace.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The Ode._ Once more Dryden towers pre-eminent in this class of\r\npoem. His two odes on the anniversary of St. Cecilia’s Day and his\r\nother ode on the death of Mrs. Anne Killigrew are among the best of\r\nany period. Written in the irregular Pindaric meter, they are full of\r\nthe high passion that gives the artificial medium some real fire and\r\nenergy. We give the opening lines of the elegiac poem:\r\n\r\n    Thou youngest Virgin-Daughter of the skies,\r\n      Made in the last promotion of the blest;\r\n    Whose palms, new plucked from Paradise,\r\n    In spreading branches more sublimely rise,\r\n      Rich with immortal green above the rest:\r\n    Whether, adopted to some neighbouring star,\r\n    Thou roll’st above us in thy wandering race,\r\n      Or in procession fixed and regular\r\n    Moved with the heaven’s majestic pace,\r\n      Or called to more superior bliss,\r\n    Thou tread’st with seraphim the vast abyss.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _The Satire._ Several circumstances combined to make this age\r\nabound in satirical writing. It was a period of bitter political and\r\npersonal contention, of easy morals and subdued enthusiasms, of sharp\r\nwit and acute discrimination. For these reasons satire acquired a new\r\nimportance and a sharper edge.\r\n\r\nThe older satire, such as is represented in the poems of Donne and\r\nof Andrew Marvell (1621–78), was of a more general kind, and seemed\r\nto have been written with deliberate clumsiness and obscurity. These\r\nhabits were repugnant to the ideals of the new age, whose satire\r\nis more personal and more vindictive. Its effect is immensely more\r\nincisive, and it obtains a new freshness and point by the use of\r\nthe heroic couplet, in which it is almost wholly written. Dryden’s\r\n_Absalom and Achitophel_ is an excellent example of the political\r\nsatire, while his _MacFlecknoe_ shows the personal type. Literary\r\nsatire is also well represented in _The Rehearsal_ (1671), which\r\nparodied the literary vices of the time, especially those of the heroic\r\nplay. This work, which was reproduced year after year, with topical\r\nhits in every new edition, was the work of several hands, though the\r\nDuke of Buckingham receives the chief credit. Butler’s _Hudibras_\r\nis a satire on the Puritans. The miscellaneous satire of John Oldham\r\n(1653–83) had much of the earlier clumsiness.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Narrative poetry._ Dryden’s translations and adaptations of\r\nChaucer, Virgil, Ovid, and Boccaccio are the chief examples of this\r\nform. Among others, he gives us Chaucer’s _Wife of Bath’s Tale_, _The\r\nKnight’s Tale_, and several tales from Boccaccio. There is no fresh\r\ndevelopment to record. Butler’s _Hudibras_ is narrative of a kind,\r\nthough the chief interest is satirical.\r\n\r\n=2. Drama.= The development of the drama is considerable. We\r\nsummarize briefly what has already been indicated.\r\n\r\n(_a_) In _tragedy_ the most novel in the matter of form is the _heroic\r\nplay_, whose peculiarities have already been pointed out on p. 199.\r\nThere is little further development. The tragical faculty is weakening\r\nall through the period, even in comparison with the post-Shakespearian\r\nplays. This type of play is best represented by Dryden’s _All for\r\nLove_ and Otway’s _Venice Preserved_. The characters are becoming more\r\nstagy, and the situations are made as horrible as the ingenuity of the\r\ndramatist can devise.\r\n\r\n(_b_) In _comedy_ the advance is noteworthy. The comedy of “humors”\r\nis dying out, though considerable traces of it are still visible. The\r\ninfluence of the French is giving the comedy a new “snap” and glitter,\r\nand the almost universal medium is prose. Congreve’s _Way of the World_\r\n(1700), Wycherley’s _Country Wife_ (1675), and Farquhar’s _Beaux’\r\nStratagem_ (1707) are good examples.\r\n\r\n=3. Prose.= With the exception of the work of Dryden and Bunyan,\r\nthe prose work of the time is of little moment. Dryden’s prose is\r\nalmost entirely devoted to literary criticism; Bunyan’s contribution\r\nshows a remarkable development of the prose allegory. The remainder of\r\nthe prose-writers deal with political and miscellaneous subjects, with,\r\nin addition, some theological and historical writing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF LITERARY STYLE\r\n\r\nThe main tendency of the age, in all departments of literature, is\r\ntoward a clear, plain, and forcible style.\r\n\r\n=1. Poetry.= The new movement was seen most clearly in the\r\ndevelopment of the _heroic couplet_, which was soon to spread\r\nthroughout poetry and through much of the drama. As we have seen\r\n(p. 182), in the previous age the couplet had become so loose that\r\nit resembled a cross between prose and verse. An exponent of such a\r\nmeasure is Chamberlayne (1619–89):\r\n\r\n                    Poor love must dwell\r\n    Within no climate but what’s parallel\r\n    Unto our honoured births; the envied fate\r\n    Of princes oft these burdens find from state\r\n    When lowly swains, knowing no parent’s voice\r\n    Of negative, make a free and happy choice.\r\n\r\nThis is a curious liquid measure. The pause is irregularly distributed,\r\nand the rhythm is light and easy.\r\n\r\nCowley and Denham likewise obtain much credit for the introduction of\r\nthe new measure; but the chief innovator is Edmund Waller (1606–87).\r\nDryden, in his dedication to _The Rival Ladies_ says, “Rime has all the\r\nadvantages of prose besides its own. But the excellence and dignity of\r\nit were never fully known till Mr. Waller first taught it.” An extract\r\nfrom Waller will suffice:\r\n\r\n    While in this park I sing, the listening deer\r\n    Attend my passion, and forget to fear;\r\n    When to the beeches I report my flame,\r\n    They bow their heads, as if they felt the same,\r\n    To gods appealing, when I reach their bowers,\r\n    With loud complaints, they answer me in showers.\r\n\r\nThe note here is quite different from that of the previous extract. The\r\ntread of the meter is steady and almost uniform, and the pauses cluster\r\nabout the middle and the end of the lines. It must be noted, too, that\r\na large proportion of Waller’s poetry took this form.\r\n\r\nDryden adopted the heroic couplet, but he improved upon the wooden\r\nrespectability of his predecessors’ verse. While he retained all the\r\ncouplet’s steadiness and force, he gave it an additional vigor, a\r\nsinewy elegance, and a noble rhythm and beauty. It is worth while\r\ngiving another example of his couplet:\r\n\r\n    A milk-white hind, immortal and unchanged,\r\n    Fed on the lawns and in the forest ranged;\r\n    Without unspotted, innocent within,\r\n    She feared no danger, for she knew no sin.\r\n    Yet had she oft been chased with horns and hounds\r\n    And Scythian shafts; and many winged wounds\r\n    Aimed at her heart; was often forced to fly,\r\n    And doomed to death, though fated not to die.\r\n                           DRYDEN, _The Hind and the Panther_\r\n\r\nIn its own fashion this passage is as melodious and powerful as some of\r\nthe noblest lines of Milton.\r\n\r\nIn other forms of poetry the style contains little to be commented\r\nupon. The _blank verse_ continues the disintegration that\r\n(with the exception of the verse of Milton) began with the death of\r\nShakespeare. We give a good example of this Restoration blank verse:\r\n\r\n    Through a close lane as I pursued my journey,\r\n    And meditating on the last night’s vision,\r\n    I spied a wrinkled hag, with age grown double,\r\n    Picking dry sticks, and mumbling to herself;\r\n    Her eyes with scalding rheum were galled and red,\r\n    And palsy shook her head; her hands seemed withered;\r\n    And on her crooked shoulder had she wrapped\r\n    The tattered remnant of an old striped hanging.\r\n                                           OTWAY, _The Orphan_\r\n\r\nIn this passage we can observe the absence of the high poetic fire\r\nof the Elizabethans and the lack of the thunderous depth of Milton.\r\nObserve the regularity of the beat, the uniformity of the pauses, and\r\nthe frequency of the hypermetrical ending. There is, nevertheless, a\r\ncertain somber, dogged attraction about the style of the passage. The\r\naverage blank verse of the time is much less regular, and much less\r\nattractive.\r\n\r\nThe _lyric_ still shows a reflection of the Caroline manner, as can be\r\nseen in the following example:\r\n\r\n    Love still has something of the sea,\r\n      From whence his mother rose;\r\n    No time his slaves from doubt can free,\r\n      Nor give their thoughts repose.\r\n\r\n    They are becalmed in clearest days,\r\n      And in rough weather tossed;\r\n    They wither under cold delays,\r\n      Or are in tempests lost.\r\n                     SEDLEY (_out of seven stanzas_)\r\n\r\nThis lyric has an undoubted sweetness of expression, though it is\r\nartificial in thought.\r\n\r\n=2. Prose.= Though the prose writing of the period is not great\r\nin bulk, it shows a profound change in style. Previous writers, such\r\nas Browne, Clarendon, and Hobbes, had done remarkable and beautiful\r\nwork in prose, but their style had not yet found itself. It was wayward\r\nand erratic, often cumbrous and often obscure, and weighted with a\r\nLatinized construction and vocabulary. In Dryden’s time prose begins\r\ndefinitely to find its feet. It acquires a general utility and a\r\npermanence; it is smoothed and straightened, simplified and harmonized.\r\nThis is the age of average prose, and prepares the way for the work\r\nof Swift and Addison, who stand on the threshold of the modern prose\r\nstyle. Less than forty years intervene between Dryden and Sir Thomas\r\nBrowne; yet Dryden and his school seem to be nearer the twentieth\r\ncentury than they are to Browne.\r\n\r\nNot that Dryden’s style is flawless. It is sometimes involved\r\nand obscure; there are little slips of grammar and many slips of\r\nexpression; but on the average it is of high quality, and the\r\nimpression that the reader receives is one of great freshness and\r\nabounding vitality. Further examples of this good average style will be\r\nfound in the work of Temple and Halifax.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Bunyan the style becomes plainer still. But it is\r\npowerful and effective, and bears the narrative nobly. Pepys and Evelyn\r\nhave no pretensions to style as such, but their work is admirably\r\nexpressed, and Evelyn in especial has passages of more elevated diction.\r\n\r\nIn some authors of the period we find this desire for unornamented\r\nstyle degenerating into coarseness and ugliness. Such a one is =Jeremy\r\nCollier (1650–1726)=, whose _Short View of the Profaneness and\r\nImmorality of the English Stage_ (1698) caused a great commotion in\r\nits day. It attacked the vices of the stage with such vigor that it is\r\nsaid to have driven some of the playwrights from their evil courses.\r\nThe style of this famous book is so colloquial that it becomes in\r\nplaces ungrammatical. =Thomas Sprat (1635–1713)= was another disciple\r\nof the same school. He wrote on the newly formed Royal Society, which\r\ndemanded from its members, “a close, naked, natural way of speaking.”\r\nThis expresses the new development quite well. A greater man than Sprat\r\nbut a fellow-member of the Royal Society, was =John Locke (1632–1704)=,\r\nwho in his famous _Essay concerning Human Understanding_ (1690) put the\r\nprinciple into practice. Locke’s style is bare to baldness, but it is\r\nclear. We give an example:\r\n\r\n   Some men are remarked for pleasantness in raillery; others,\r\n   for apologues, and apposite, diverting stories. This is apt to\r\n   be taken for the effect of pure nature, and that the rather,\r\n   because it is not got by rules, and those who excel in either\r\n   of them, never purposely set themselves to the study of it as an\r\n   art to be learnt. But yet it is true, that at first some lucky\r\n   hit, which took with somebody, and gained him commendation,\r\n   encouraged him to try again, inclined his thoughts and\r\n   endeavours that way, till at last he insensibly got a facility\r\n   in it without perceiving how; and that is attributed wholly to\r\n   nature, which was much more the effect of use and practice. I\r\n   do not deny that natural disposition may often give the first\r\n   rise to it; but that never carries a man far without use and\r\n   exercise, and it is practice alone that brings the powers of\r\n   the mind as well as those of the body to their perfection. Many\r\n   a good poetic vein is buried under a trade, and never produces\r\n   anything for want of improvement. We see the ways of discourse\r\n   and reasoning are very different, even concerning the same\r\n   matter, at court and in the university. And he that will go but\r\n   from Westminster Hall to the Exchange, will find a different\r\n   genius and turn in their ways of talking; and one cannot think\r\n   that all whose lot fell in the city were born with different\r\n   parts from those who were bred at the university or inns of\r\n   court.\r\n\r\n         TABLE TO ILLUSTRATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF LITERARY FORMS\r\n\r\n    +----+-----------------------------+-------------------+--------------------------+\r\n    |    |           POETRY            |      DRAMA        |          PROSE           |\r\n    |    +---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+------+---------+\r\n    |DATE|         |         |Satirical|         |         |         |      | Miscel- |\r\n    |    | Lyrical |Narrative|   and   | Tragedy | Comedy  |Narrative|Essay | laneous |\r\n    |    |         |         |Didactic |         |         |         |      |         |\r\n    +----+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+------+---------+\r\n    |1650|         |         |         |         |         |         |      |         |\r\n    |    |         |         |         |         |         |         |      |         |\r\n    |    |         |         |         |         |         |         |      |         |\r\n    |    |         |         |         |         |         |         |      |         |\r\n    |    |         |         |         |         |         |         |      |         |\r\n    |    |         |         |         |         |         |         |      |         |\r\n    |1660|         |         |         |         |         |         |      |Pepys    |\r\n    +----+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+------+---------+\r\n    |    |Dryden   |Dryden   |         |         |         |         |      |         |\r\n    |    |         |       Butler      |         |         |         |      |Evelyn   |\r\n    |    |         |         |         |         |Dryden   |         |      |         |\r\n    |    |Dorset   |         |         |         |Etheredge|Bunyan   |      |         |\r\n    |    |Sedley   |         |         |Dryden   |         |         |Dryden|Dryden[136]|\r\n    |    |Rochester|         |         |         |         |         |      |         |\r\n    |1670|         |         |         |         |Shadwell |         |      |Tillotson|\r\n    +----+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+------+---------+\r\n    |    |         |         |         |         |         |         |      |Sprat    |\r\n    |    |         |         |         |Lee      |Wycherley|         |      |         |\r\n    |    |         |         |         |         |         |         |      |         |\r\n    |    |         |         |         |         |         |         |      |         |\r\n    |    |         |         |         |Otway    |         |         |      |         |\r\n    |    |         |         |Oldham   |         |         |         |      |         |\r\n    |1680|         |         |         |         |         |         |      |Halifax  |\r\n    +----+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+------+---------+\r\n    |    |         |         |Shadwell |         |         |         |Temple|Temple   |\r\n    |    |         |         |Dryden[137]|       |         |         |      |         |\r\n    |    |         |         |         |         |         |         |      |         |\r\n    |    |         |         |         |Rowe     |         |         |      |         |\r\n    |    |         |         |         |         |         |         |      |         |\r\n    |    |         |         |Dryden[138]|       |         |         |      |         |\r\n    |1690|         |         |         |Dryden[139]|       |         |      |         |\r\n    +----+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+------+---------+\r\n    |    |         |         |         |         |         |         |      |         |\r\n    |    |         |         |         |         |Congreve |         |      |         |\r\n    |    |         |         |         |         |         |         |      |         |\r\n    |    |         |         |         |         |Vanbrugh |         |      |         |\r\n    |    |         |         |         |         |         |         |      |         |\r\n    |    |Dryden[140]|       |         |         |         |         |      |         |\r\n    |1700|         |Dryden[141]|       |         |Farquhar |         |      |         |\r\n    +----+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+------+---------+\r\n\r\n\r\nIn one prominent case we have a survival of the more elaborate style of\r\nthe past, and that is in the history of =Gilbert Burnet (1643–1715)=,\r\nBishop of Salisbury, whose _History of his own Times_ was published\r\nafter his death. The style of the book is modeled on that of Clarendon.\r\nBurnet’s style is not of the same class as that of his predecessor: it\r\nhas lapses into colloquialism; its sentences are snipped into small\r\npieces by means of frequent colons and semicolons; and he has not\r\nClarendon’s command of vocabulary.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               EXERCISES\r\n\r\n1. The two following lyrics are respectively of the Restoration and the\r\nCaroline periods. Compare and contrast them in (_a_) subject, (_b_)\r\nstyle, and (_c_) meter. Summarize the effect of either of them, and say\r\nwhich you prefer and why you prefer it.\r\n\r\n    (1) Love in fantastic triumph sate,\r\n          Whilst bleeding hearts around him flowed,\r\n        For whom fresh pains he did create,\r\n          And strange tyrannic power he showed.\r\n        From thy bright eyes he took his fires,\r\n          Which round about in sport he hurled;\r\n        But ’twas from mine he took desires\r\n          Enough t’ undo the amorous world.\r\n\r\n        From me he took his sighs and tears,\r\n          From thee his pride and cruelty;\r\n        From me his languishment and fears,\r\n          And every killing dart from thee:\r\n        Thus thou, and I, the god have armed\r\n          And set him up a deity;\r\n        But my poor heart alone is harmed,\r\n          While thine the victor is, and free.\r\n                                  APHRA BEHN (1640–89)\r\n\r\n    (2) Fair Daffodils, we weep to see\r\n          You haste away so soon:\r\n        As yet the early-rising Sun\r\n          Has not attain’d his noon.\r\n              Stay, stay,\r\n        Until the hasting day\r\n              Has run\r\n          But to the even-song;\r\n        And, having pray’d together, we\r\n          Will go with you along.\r\n\r\n        We have short time to stay, as you,\r\n          We have as short a Spring;\r\n        As quick a growth to meet decay\r\n          As you, or any thing.\r\n              We die,\r\n        As your hours do, and dry\r\n              Away\r\n        Like to the Summer’s rain;\r\n        Or as the pearls of morning’s dew\r\n        Ne’er to be found again.\r\n                      _To Daffodils_, HERRICK (1591–1674)\r\n\r\n2. Write a brief criticism of the following passage of Dryden’s prose.\r\nComment upon (_a_) the vocabulary, (_b_) the type of sentence, (_c_)\r\nany colloquialisms or slips of grammar, and (_d_) its value as literary\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\n   He must have been a man of a most wonderful comprehensive\r\n   nature, because, as it has been truly observed of him, he has\r\n   taken into the compass of his _Canterbury Tales_ the various\r\n   manners and humours (as we now call them) of the whole English\r\n   nation, in his age. Not a single character has escaped him. All\r\n   his pilgrims are severally distinguished from each other; and\r\n   not only in their inclinations, but in their very physiognomies\r\n   and persons. Baptista Porta could not have described their\r\n   natures better, than by the marks which the poet gives them.\r\n   The matter and manner of their tales, and of their telling, are\r\n   so suited to their different educations, humours, and callings,\r\n   that each of them would be improper in any other mouth. Even\r\n   the grave and serious characters are distinguished by their\r\n   several sorts of gravity: their discourses are such as belong\r\n   to their age, their calling, and their breeding; such as are\r\n   becoming of them, and of them only. Some of his persons are\r\n   vicious, and some virtuous; some are unlearned, or (as Chaucer\r\n   calls them) lewd, and some are learned. Even the ribaldry of\r\n   the low characters is different; the Reeve, the Miller, and\r\n   the Cook, are several men, and distinguished from each other\r\n   as much as the mincing Lady Prioress, and the broad-speaking,\r\n   gap-toothed Wife of Bath. But enough of this; there is such a\r\n   variety of game springing up before me, that I am distracted in\r\n   my choice, and know not which to follow. ’Tis sufficient to say,\r\n   according to the proverb, that “Here is God’s plenty.” We have\r\n   our forefathers and great-granddames all before us, as they were\r\n   in Chaucer’s days; their general characters are still remaining\r\n   in mankind, and even in England, though they are called by other\r\n   names than those of monks and friars, and canons, and lady\r\n   abbesses, and nuns; for mankind is ever the same, and nothing\r\n   lost out of Nature, though everything is altered.\r\n                                        _Preface to the “Fables”_\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The extracts given below illustrate the development of the stopped\r\ncouplet. Point out briefly the change that comes over the meter, paying\r\nattention to (_a_) the regularity of the accent, (_b_) the pause, and\r\n(_c_) the cæsura.\r\n\r\n    (1) The sable mantle of the silent night\r\n        Shut from the world the ever-joysome light.\r\n        Care fled away, and softest slumbers please\r\n        To leave the court for lowly cottages.\r\n        Wild beasts forsook their dens on woody hills,\r\n        And sleightful otters left the purling rills;\r\n        Rooks to their nests in high woods now were flung,\r\n        And with their spread wings shield their naked young.\r\n        When thieves from thickets to the cross-ways stir,\r\n        And terror frights the lonely passenger;\r\n        When naught was heard but now and then the howl\r\n        Of some vile cur, or whooping of the owl.\r\n                                         WILLIAM BROWNE, 1620\r\n\r\n    (2) Oh, virtue’s pattern, glory of our times,\r\n        Sent of past days to expiate the crimes;\r\n        Great King, but better far than thou art great,\r\n        Whom state not honours but who honours state;\r\n        By wonder born, by wonder first installed,\r\n        By wonder after to new kingdoms called;\r\n        Young, kept by wonder from home-bred alarms,\r\n        Old, saved by wonder from pale traitor’s harms,\r\n        To be for this thy reign, which wonders brings,\r\n        A king of wonder, wonder unto kings.\r\n        If Pict, Dane, Norman, thy smooth yoke had seen,\r\n        Pict, Dane, and Norman, had thy subjects been;\r\n        If Brutus knew the bliss thy rule doth give,\r\n        E’en Brutus joy would under thee to live.\r\n        For thou thy people dost so dearly love,\r\n        That they a father more than prince thee prove.\r\n                                               DRUMMOND, 1630\r\n\r\n    (3) The seas are quiet when the winds give o’er;\r\n        So, calm are we when passions are no more!\r\n        For then we know how vain it was to boast\r\n        Of fleeting things, so certain to be lost.\r\n        Clouds of affection from our younger eyes\r\n        Conceal that emptiness which age descries.\r\n\r\n        The soul’s dark cottage, battered and decayed,\r\n        Lets in new light through chinks that time has made;\r\n        Stronger by weakness, wiser, men become\r\n        As they draw near to their eternal home.\r\n        Leaving the old, both worlds at once they view,\r\n        That stand upon the threshold of the new.\r\n                                               WALLER, 1687\r\n\r\n    (4) See barbarous nations at thy gates attend,\r\n        Walk in thy light, and in thy temple bend;\r\n        See thy bright altars thronged with prostrate kings,\r\n        And heaped with products of Sabæan springs!\r\n        For thee Idume’s spicy forests blow,\r\n        And seeds of golden Ophir’s mountains glow.\r\n        See heaven its sparkling portals wide display,\r\n        And break upon thee in a flood of day.\r\n                                                POPE, 1730\r\n\r\n4. In the following extract from Bunyan explain carefully the literal\r\nmeaning that lies behind the allegory. Remark upon (_a_) its\r\nclearness, (_b_) its appropriateness and beauty. Add a note on Bunyan’s\r\nstyle, especially with regard to its connection with the Bible.\r\n\r\n   But we will come again to this valley of humiliation. It is\r\n   the best and most fruitful piece of ground in all these parts.\r\n   It is fat ground, and, as you see, consisteth much in meadows;\r\n   and if a man was to come here in summer-time, as we do now, if\r\n   he knew not anything before thereof, and if he also delighted\r\n   himself in the sight of his eyes, he might see that which would\r\n   be delightful to him. Behold how green this valley is! also how\r\n   beautiful with lilies! I have known many labouring men that\r\n   have got good estates in this valley of humiliation. “For God\r\n   resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble”; for indeed\r\n   it is a very fruitful soil, and doth bring forth handfuls. Some\r\n   also have wished that the next way to their father’s house were\r\n   here, that they might be troubled no more with either hills or\r\n   mountains to go over; but the way is the way, and there’s an end.\r\n\r\n5.

Does it\r\nstrike you as being overdone? Add a note on the meter.\r\n\r\n6. The following is Dryden’s character-sketch of the Duke of\r\nBuckingham, who receives the name of Zimri. (Dryden, in his _Essay\r\non Satire_, says: “How easy it is to call rogue and villain, and\r\nthat wittily! but how hard to make a man appear a fool, a blockhead,\r\nor a knave without using any of these opprobrious names! There is\r\na vast difference between the slovenly butchering of a man and the\r\nfineness of stroke that separates the head from the body, and leaves\r\nit standing in its place.... The character of Zimri, in my _Absalom\r\nand Achitophel_, is, in my opinion, worth the whole poem. It is not\r\nbloody, but it is ridiculous enough.”)\r\n\r\n    Some of their chiefs were princes of the land;\r\n    In the first rank of these did Zimri stand,\r\n    A man so various that he seemed to be\r\n    Not one, but all mankind’s epitome:\r\n    Stiff in opinions, always in the wrong,\r\n    Was everything by starts, and nothing long;\r\n    But in the course of one revolving moon\r\n    Was chymist, fiddler, statesman, and buffoon;\r\n    Then all for women, painting, rhyming, drinking,\r\n    Besides ten thousand freaks that died in thinking.\r\n    Blest madman who could every hour employ\r\n    With something new to wish or to enjoy!\r\n    Railing and praising were his usual themes,\r\n    And both, to show his judgment, in extremes:\r\n    So over violent or over civil\r\n    That every man with him was God or Devil.\r\n    In squandering wealth was his peculiar art;\r\n    Nothing went unrewarded but desert.\r\n    Beggared by fools whom still he found too late,\r\n    He had his jest, and they had his estate.\r\n    He laughed himself from Court; then sought relief\r\n    By forming parties, but could ne’er be chief:\r\n    For spite of him, the weight of business fell\r\n    On Absalom and wise Achitophel;\r\n    Thus wicked but in will, of means bereft,\r\n    He left not faction, but of that was left.\r\n\r\nFrom this passage quote the lines which hint that Buckingham is\r\nrespectively “a fool, a blockhead, or a knave” without actually calling\r\nhim so. Quote other lines that seem to be particularly effective.\r\nRemark upon the style of the couplet: the meter, the position of the\r\npause, and the kind of rhyme. Finally, write a paragraph summarizing\r\nthe effect the passage produces on the reader.\r\n\r\n7. The passage given below is an extract from Dryden’s earliest printed\r\npoem (1658). Compare it with the passage given in the last exercise.\r\n\r\n    Each little pimple had a tear in it,\r\n    To wail the fault its rising did commit,\r\n    Who, rebel-like, with their own lord at strife,\r\n    Thus made an insurrection ’gainst his life.\r\n    Or were these gems sent to adorn his skin,\r\n    The cabinet of a richer soul within?\r\n    No comet need foretell his change drew on,\r\n    Whose corpse might seem a constellation.\r\n                 _Upon the Death of the Lord Hastings_\r\n\r\n    8. Waller was smooth; but Dryden taught to join\r\n       The varying verse, the full resounding line,\r\n       The long majestic march, the energy divine.\r\n                                                  POPE\r\n\r\nFrom the passages already quoted give extracts to show the truth of the\r\nabove statement.\r\n\r\n9. Use the following quotation to sketch the development of English\r\nprose from the death of Shakespeare to the death of Dryden:\r\n\r\n   When we find Chapman, the Elizabethan translator of Homer,\r\n   expressing himself in his preface thus: “Though truth in her\r\n   very nakedness sits in so deep a pit, that from Gades to Aurora\r\n   and Ganges few eyes can sound her, I hope yet those few here\r\n   will so discover and confirm, that, the date being out of her\r\n   darkness in this morning of our poet, he shall now gird his\r\n   temples with the sun,”--we pronounce that such a prose is\r\n   intolerable. When we find Milton writing: “And long it was not\r\n   after, when I was confirmed in this opinion, that he, who would\r\n   not be frustrate of his hope to write well hereafter in laudable\r\n   things, ought himself to be a true poem,”--we pronounce that\r\n   such a prose has its own grandeur, but that it is obsolete and\r\n   inconvenient. But when we find Dryden telling us: “What Virgil\r\n   wrote in the vigour of his age, in plenty and at ease, I have\r\n   undertaken to translate in my declining years; struggling with\r\n   wants, oppressed with sickness, curbed in my genius, liable to\r\n   be misconstrued in all I write,” then we exclaim that here at\r\n   last we have the true English prose, prose such as we would\r\n   all gladly use if we only knew how. Yet Dryden was Milton’s\r\n   contemporary.\r\n                                                    MATTHEW ARNOLD\r\n\r\n\r\n10. “A good deal of the unconquerable individuality of the earlier part\r\nof the century survives in it, and prevents monotony. After Addison\r\neverybody tries to write like Addison; after Johnson almost everybody\r\ntries to write like Johnson. But after Dryden everybody dare not yet\r\ntry to write like Dryden.” (Saintsbury.) Show how far this statement\r\napplies to the prose style of the age.\r\n\r\n11. “The characteristic feature of _The Pilgrim’s Progress_ is that it\r\nis the only work of its kind which possesses a strong human interest.”\r\n(Macaulay.) Show how Bunyan, in plot, characters, and style, arouses\r\nthis “strong human interest” in his allegory. From this point of view\r\ncompare him with Spenser, who, Macaulay says, does not arouse this\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n12. The period of Dryden is often called “the Age of Satire.” Account\r\nfor the prominence of satire in this period, and point out some of the\r\neffects it had on current and the succeeding writing.\r\n\r\n13. What are the main features of Restoration drama?\r\n\r\n14. “No man exercised so much influence on the age. The reason is\r\nobvious. On no man did the age exercise so much influence.” (Macaulay.)\r\nHow far is this statement true of Dryden?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                            THE AGE OF POPE\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME-CHART OF THE CHIEF AUTHORS\r\n\r\n_The thick line shows the period of active literary work_\r\n\r\n                   1700       1710       1720       1730       1740       1750\r\n                    |      ║  [142]║      |          |          |   ║      |\r\n    Pope            |......║=======║================================║      |\r\n      (1688–1744)   |          |   ║      |          |          |          |\r\n                    |      ║   |          |  ║       |          |          |\r\n    Prior           |......║=================║       |          |          |\r\n      (1664–1721)   |          |          |          |          |          |\r\n                    |          |   ║      |          |          | ║[143]║  |\r\n    Young           |..........|...║==============================║=====║..|\r\n      (1683–1765)   |          |          |          |          |          |\r\n                    |   ║      |          |    ║[144]|      ║   |     ║    |\r\n    Swift           |...║======================║============║...|.....║    |\r\n      (1667–1745)   |          |          |    ║     |          |          |\r\n                    |   ║      |║[145] ║  |          |          |          |\r\n    Addison         |...║=======║======║  |          |          |          |\r\n      (1672–1719)   |          |║         |          |          |          |\r\n                    |     ║    |║[145]    |       ║  |          |          |\r\n    Steele          |.....║=====║=================║  |          |          |\r\n      (1672–1729)   |          |║         |          |          |          |\r\n                    |║         |       ║[146]        | ║        |          |\r\n    Defoe           |║=================║===============║        |          |\r\n      (1659–1731)   |          |       ║  |          |          |          |\r\n                    |          |          |          |          |          |\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND (1700–50)\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the eighteenth century the old quarrels take on new\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\n=1. The Rise of the Political Parties.= In the reign of Charles II\r\nthe terms “Whig” and “Tory” first became current; by the year 1700 they\r\nwere in everybody’s mouth. About that time domestic politicians became\r\nsharply cleft into two groups that were destined to become established\r\nas the basis of the British system. Domestic affairs, while they never\r\napproached the stage of bloodshed, took on a new acrimony that was\r\nto affect literature deeply. Actual points of political faith upon\r\nwhich the parties were divided are not of great importance to us here;\r\nbut, generally speaking, we may say that the Whig party stood for the\r\npre-eminence of personal freedom as opposed to the Tory view of royal\r\ndivine right. Hence the Whigs supported the Hanoverian succession,\r\nwhereas the Tories were Jacobites. The Tories, whose numbers were\r\nrecruited chiefly from the landed classes, objected to the foreign war\r\nupon the score that they had to pay taxes to prolong it; and the Whigs,\r\nrepresenting the trading classes generally, were alleged to be anxious\r\nto continue the war, as it brought them increased prosperity. In the\r\nmatter of religion the Whigs were Low Churchmen and the Tories High\r\nChurchmen.\r\n\r\n=2. The Foreign War.= This War of the Spanish Succession was\r\nbrilliantly successful under the leadership of Marlborough, who,\r\nbesides being a great general, was a prominent Tory politician. The\r\nTories, as the war seemed to be indefinitely prolonged, supplanted\r\n(1710) the Whigs, with whom they had been co-operating in the\r\nearlier stages of the war, and in 1713 they concluded the war by\r\nthe unfortunate Treaty of Utrecht. Contemporary literature is much\r\nconcerned both with the war and the peace.\r\n\r\n=3. The Succession.= When Anne ascended the throne the succession\r\nseemed to be safe enough, for she had a numerous family. Nevertheless,\r\nher children all died before her, and in 1701 it became necessary to\r\npass the Act of Settlement, a Whig measure by which the crown was\r\nconferred upon the House of Hanover. On the death of Anne, in the\r\nyear 1714, the succession took effect, in spite of the efforts of the\r\nTories, who were anxious to restore the Stuarts. The events of this\r\nyear 1714 deeply influenced the lives of Addison, Steele, Swift, and\r\nmany other writers of lesser degree.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF PROSE\r\n\r\nThe age of Pope intensified the movement that, as we have seen, began\r\nafter the Restoration. The drift away from poetical passion was more\r\npronounced than ever, the ideals of “wit” and “common sense” were\r\nmore zealously pursued, and the lyrical note was almost unheard. In\r\nits place we find in poetry the overmastering desire for neatness\r\nand perspicuity, for edge and point in style, and for correctness in\r\nthe technique of the popular forms of poetry. These aims received\r\nexpression in the almost crazy devotion to the heroic couplet, the\r\naptest medium for the purpose. In this type of poetry the supreme\r\nmaster is Pope; yet even the most ardent admirer of Pope must admit his\r\ndefects as a poet of the passions. Indeed, one of his most competent\r\nbiographers[147] asserts that “most of his work may be fairly described\r\nas rhymed prose, differing from prose not in substance or in tone of\r\nfeeling, but only in the form of expression.”\r\n\r\nThus the poet who is admitted to be far and away the most important\r\nof the age is considered to be largely prosaic. On the other hand,\r\nthe only other great names of the period--Swift, Addison, Steele,\r\nDefoe--are those of prose-writers primarily, and prose-writers of a\r\nvery high quality.\r\n\r\nThe main reason for this temporary predominance of prose is hard to\r\ndiscover. One can put it down only to the mysterious ebb and flow, the\r\nalternate coming and going, of the spirit of poetry. This alternation\r\nis noticeable through all the stages of our literary history, and\r\nnowhere is it more distinct than in the century we are discussing. The\r\nspirit of poetry was soaring to its culmination in the Elizabethan age;\r\nduring the era of Dryden it was fluttering to earth; in Pope’s lifetime\r\nit was crouching “like veiled lightnings asleep”; but it was soon to\r\narise with new and divine strength.\r\n\r\nSome other outstanding conditions of the age remain to be considered.\r\nMost of them, it will be noticed, help to give prose its dominating\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n=1. Political Writing.= We have already noticed the rise of the two\r\npolitical parties, accompanied by an increased acerbity of political\r\npassion. This development gave a fresh importance to men of literary\r\nability, for both parties competed for the assistance of their pens,\r\nbribed the authors with places and pensions (or promises of them), and\r\nadmitted them more or less deeply into their counsels. In previous ages\r\nauthors had had to depend on their patrons, often capricious beings,\r\nor upon the length of their subscription lists; they now acquired an\r\nindependence and an importance that turned the heads of some of them.\r\nHardly a writer of the time is free from the political bias. Swift\r\nbecame a virulent Tory, Addison a tepid Whig; Steele was Whig and Tory\r\nin turn. It was indeed the Golden Age of political pamphleteering, and\r\nthe writers made the most of it.\r\n\r\n=2. The Clubs and Coffee-houses.= Politicians are necessarily\r\ngregarious, and the increased activity in politics led to a great\r\naddition to the number of political clubs and coffee-houses, which\r\nbecame the _foci_ of fashionable and public life. In the first\r\nnumber of _The Tatler_ Steele announces as a matter of course that\r\nthe activities of his new journal will be based upon the clubs. “All\r\naccounts of Gallantry, Pleasure and Entertainment shall be under\r\nthe article of White’s Chocolate-House; Poetry under that of Will’s\r\nCoffee-House; Learning under the title of Grecian; Foreign and Domestic\r\nNews you will have from Saint James’ Coffee-House.” These coffee-houses\r\nbecame the “clearing-houses” for literary business, and from them\r\nbranched purely literary associations such as the famous Scriblerus and\r\nKit-Cat Clubs, those haunts of the fashionable writers which figure so\r\nprominently in the writings of the period.\r\n\r\n=3. Periodical Writing.= The development of the periodical will be\r\nnoticed elsewhere (see pp. 267–8). It is sufficient here to point\r\nout that the struggle for political mastery led both factions to\r\nissue a swarm of _Examiners_, _Guardians_, _Freeholders_, and similar\r\npublications. These journals were run by a band of vigorous and facile\r\nprose-writers, who in their differing degrees of excellence represent\r\nalmost a new type in our literature.\r\n\r\n=4. The New Publishing Houses.= The interest in politics, and\r\nprobably the decline in the drama, caused a great increase in the size\r\nof the reading public. In its turn this aroused the activities of a\r\nnumber of men who became the forerunners of the modern publishing\r\nhouses. Such were Edmund Curll (1675–1747), Jacob Tonson (1656–1736),\r\nand John Dunton (1659–1733). These men employed numbers of needy\r\nwriters, who produced the translations, adaptations, and other popular\r\nworks of the time. It is unwise to judge a publisher by what authors\r\nsay of him, but the universal condemnation leveled against Curll and\r\nhis kind compels the belief that they were a breed of scoundrels who\r\npreyed upon authors and public, and (what is more remarkable) upon one\r\nanother. The miserable race of hack-writers--venomously attacked by\r\nPope in _The Dunciad_--who existed on the scanty bounty of such\r\nmen lived largely in a thoroughfare near Moorfields called Grub Street,\r\nthe name of which has become synonymous with literary drudgery.\r\n\r\n=5. The New Morality.= The immorality of the Restoration, which\r\nhad been almost entirely a Court phenomenon and was largely the\r\nreaction against extreme Puritanism, soon spent itself. The natural\r\nprocess of time was hastened by opinion in high quarters. William\r\nIII was a severe moralist, and Anne, his successor, was of the same\r\ncharacter. Thus we soon see a new tone in the writing of the time,\r\nand a new attitude to life and morals. Addison, in an early number of\r\n_The Spectator_, puts the new fashion in his own admirable way:\r\n“I shall endeavour to enliven morality with wit, and to temper wit\r\nwith morality.” Another development of the same spirit is seen in the\r\nrevised opinion of women, who are treated with new respect and dignity.\r\nMuch coarseness is still to be felt, especially in satirical writing,\r\nin which Swift, for instance, can be quite vile; but the general upward\r\ntendency is undoubtedly there.\r\n\r\n\r\nJONATHAN SWIFT (1667–1745)\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= Swift was born in Dublin, and, though both his parents\r\nwere English, his connection with Ireland was to be maintained more or\r\nless closely till the day he died. His father dying before Jonathan’s\r\nbirth, the boy was thrown upon the charity of an uncle, who paid for\r\nhis education in Ireland. He seems to have been very wretched both\r\nat his school at Kilkenny and at Trinity College, Dublin, where his\r\nexperiences went to confirm in him that savage melancholia that was to\r\nendure all his life. Much of this distemper was due to purely physical\r\ncauses, for he suffered from an affection of the ear that ultimately\r\ntouched his brain and caused insanity. In 1686, at the age of nineteen,\r\nhe left Trinity College (it is said in disgrace), and in 1689 entered\r\nthe household of his famous kinsman Sir William Temple, under whose\r\nencouragement he took holy orders, and on the death of Temple in 1699\r\nobtained other secretarial and ecclesiastical appointments. His real\r\nchance came in 1710, when the Tories overthrew the Marlborough faction\r\nand came into office. To them Swift devoted the gigantic powers of his\r\npen, became a political star of some magnitude, and, after the manner\r\nof the time, hoped for substantial rewards. He might have become a\r\nbishop, but it is said that Queen Anne objected to the vigor of his\r\nearly writings; and in the wreck of the Tory party in 1715 all he\r\ncould save was the Deanery of St. Patrick’s, in Dublin. An embittered\r\nman, he spent the last thirty years of his life in gloom, and largely\r\nin retirement. He was involved in obscure but not dishonorable\r\nphilanderings with Esther Johnson (Stella) and Esther Vanhomrigh\r\n(Vanessa), whose names figure prominently in his personal writings.\r\nHis last years were passed in silence and lunacy, and he expired (in\r\nJohnson’s words) “a driveller and a show.”\r\n\r\n=2. His Poetry.= Swift would have been among the first to smile at\r\nany claim being advanced for him on the score of his being a great\r\npoet, yet in bulk his verse is considerable, and in quality it is\r\nstriking. His poems were to a large extent recreations: odd verses\r\n(sometimes humorously doggerel) to his friends; squibs and lampoons\r\non his political and private enemies, including the famous one on\r\nPartridge, the quack astrologer; and one longish one, _Cadenus and\r\nVanessa_ (1730), which deals with his fancy for Esther Vanhomrigh.\r\nIn his poems he is as a rule lighter of touch and more placable in\r\nhumor than he is in his prose. His favorite meter is the octosyllabic\r\ncouplet, which he handles with a dexterity that reminds the reader of\r\nButler in _Hudibras_. He has lapses of taste, when be becomes coarse\r\nand vindictive; and sometimes the verse, through mere indifference, is\r\nbadly strung and colloquially expressed.\r\n\r\nThe following is from some bitter verses he wrote (1735) on his own\r\ndeath just before the final night of madness descended. Note the fierce\r\nmisery inadequately screened with savage scorn.\r\n\r\n    Yet thus, methinks, I hear them speak:\r\n    “See, how the Dean begins to break!\r\n    Poor gentleman, he droops apace!\r\n    You’ll plainly find it in his face.\r\n    That old vertigo in his head\r\n    Will never leave him, till he’s dead.\r\n    Besides, his memory decays:\r\n    He recollects not what he says;\r\n    He cannot call his friends to mind;\r\n    Forgets the place where last he dined;\r\n    Plies you with stories o’er and o’er;\r\n    He told them fifty times before.\r\n    How does he fancy we can sit\r\n    To hear his out-of-fashion wit?\r\n    But he takes up with younger folks,\r\n    Who for his wine will bear his jokes.\r\n    Faith, he must make his stories shorter,\r\n    Or change his comrades once a quarter:\r\n    In half the time he talks them round,\r\n    There must another set be found.”\r\n\r\n=3. His Prose.= Almost in one bound Swift attained to a mastery of\r\nEnglish prose, and then maintained an astonishing level of excellence.\r\nHis first noteworthy book was _The Battle of the Books_, published\r\nin 1704. The theme of this work is a well-worn one, being the dispute\r\nbetween ancient and modern authors. At the time Swift wrote it his\r\npatron, Sir William Temple, was engaged in the controversy, and Swift’s\r\ntract was in support of his kinsman’s views. Swift gives the theme a\r\nhalf allegorical, mock-heroic setting, in which the books in a library\r\nat length literally contend with one another. The handling is vigorous\r\nand illuminating, and refreshed with many happy remarks and allusions.\r\nThe famous passage where a bee, accidentally blundering into a spider’s\r\nweb, argues down the bitter remarks of the spider, is one of Swift’s\r\nhappiest efforts.\r\n\r\n_The Tale of a Tub_, also published in 1704, though it was written as\r\nearly as 1696, is regarded by many as Swift’s best work. It certainly\r\nreveals his power at its highest. It is a religious allegory, perhaps\r\nsuggested by the work of Bunyan, on three men: Peter, who stands for\r\nthe Roman Catholic Church; Jack, who represents the extreme Protestant\r\nsects; and Martin, the personification of the Anglican and Lutheran\r\nChurches. Each of the three has a coat left to him by his father, and\r\nthey have many experiences, beginning with the changes that they make\r\non the coats that have been left to them. As a narrative the book\r\nsoon loses clearness and coherence; but later a ferocious assault is\r\ndeveloped by Swift upon Peter and Jack. Martin escapes more lightly\r\nthan the others, and this is unusually discriminating on the part of\r\nthe author. The chief interest in the book lies in Swift’s uncanny\r\npenetration of intellect, which thrusts itself into all manner of human\r\nactivities, and also in the weight and blighting scorn of his comment\r\nupon those activities. The satire is irresistible. Nothing escapes\r\nit; nothing can resist it. When he has finished we feel he has made a\r\nwilderness of everything we call sacred and beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe great strength of Swift’s satiric method lies in its cosmic\r\nelemental force. Unlike that of Pope, it is never paltry or mean. It\r\nhas a terrifying intensity, caused by an aloofness that is inflexible,\r\ndominating, and unchallengeable. Yet _The Tale of a Tub_, while it\r\nfully reveals the power that stamps him as a writer of the first rank,\r\nthrows into prominence the faults that seriously mar his achievement.\r\nHis satire is too indiscriminate, lashing out at whatever comes in\r\nthe way, whether it be good or bad. Secondly, it is often violent and\r\nrevoltingly cruel. Thirdly, it can be coarse and indecent. These flaws,\r\npartly the common vices of the time, are likewise the fruit of his\r\nmental malady, and they deepen as he grows older.\r\n\r\nThe following extract shows the suggestiveness of his allegory, the\r\ncorrosive power of his satire, and his redoubtable style:\r\n\r\n   Whenever it happened that any rogue of Newgate was condemned to\r\n   be hanged, Peter would offer him a pardon for a certain sum of\r\n   money; which when the poor caitiff had made all shifts to scrape\r\n   up, and send, his lordship would return a piece of paper in this\r\n   form:\r\n\r\n   “To all mayors, sheriffs, jailors, constables, bailiffs,\r\n   hangmen, etc. Whereas we are informed that A. B. remains in the\r\n   hands of some of you, under the sentence of death: We will and\r\n   command you, upon sight hereof to let the said prisoner depart\r\n   to his own habitation whether he stands condemned for murder,\r\n   etc., etc., for which this shall be your sufficient warrant; and\r\n   if you fail hereof, God damn you and yours to all eternity; and\r\n   so we bid you heartily farewell. Your most humble man’s man,\r\n   Emperor Peter.”\r\n\r\n   The wretches, trusting to this, lost their lives and money too.\r\n   Peter, however, became outrageously proud. He has been seen\r\n   to take three old high-crowned hats and clap them on his head\r\n   three-storey high, with a huge bunch of keys at his girdle, and\r\n   an angling-rod in his hand. In which guise, whoever went to\r\n   take him by the hand in the way of salutation, Peter, with much\r\n   grace, like a well-educated spaniel, would present them with\r\n   his foot; and if they refused his civility, then he would raise\r\n   it as high as their chops, and give them a damned kick in the\r\n   mouth, which has ever since been called a salute.\r\n                                              _The Tale of a Tub_\r\n\r\nThe next period of his life (1704–14) was occupied mainly in the\r\ncomposition of political tracts, some of which are of great power.\r\nSeveral of them were written for _The Examiner_, a Tory journal. They\r\ninclude _Remarks on the Barrier Treaty_ (1712) and _The Public Spirit\r\nof the Whigs_ (1714). To this period also belongs the _Journal to\r\nStella_, which is a kind of informal private log-book written by him\r\nand sent regularly to Esther Johnson. It has all Swift’s shrewdness and\r\nvivacity, without much of the usual scorn and coarseness. It is not\r\nas intimate and revealing as the diary of Pepys, yet it gives us many\r\nglimpses of the inner man: vain and arrogant, ambitious and crafty, but\r\nnone the less a generous and considerate friend and a loyal ally.\r\n\r\nDuring the third period--that of his final stay in Ireland--the shadow\r\ndeepens. The earlier years produce one of the most compelling efforts\r\nof his pen. He supported the Irish in their revolt against “Wood’s\r\nhalfpence,” writing in their cause his _Drapier’s Letters_ (1724).\r\nThis gained for him an almost embarrassing popularity. Then followed\r\nsome miscellaneous political work, and then his longest and most famous\r\nbook, _Gulliver’s Travels_ (1726). The main idea of this book is\r\nan old one, being at least as old as the time of Lucian, a Greek writer\r\nof the second century: it deals with imaginary voyages, in Gulliver’s\r\ncase among the pigmies (Lilliputians), the giants (Brobdingnagians),\r\nthe moonstruck philosophers (Laputans), and the race of horses, with\r\ntheir human serfs the Yahoos.\r\n\r\n_Gulliver’s Travels_ resembles its fellow-allegory _The Pilgrim’s\r\nProgress_ in its popularity and human interest; but in temper the two\r\nbooks are worlds apart. Bunyan views human failings with a discerning\r\neye, but he accepts them with a benign quiescence, and with a tempered\r\nfaith in man’s ultimate redemption. Swift, on the other hand, said to\r\nPope, “I heartily hate and detest that animal called man,” and this\r\nbook is an elaboration of that attitude. He magnifies man into a giant,\r\nand then he diminishes him into a mannikin, and he finds him wicked\r\nand insolent and mean; he regards man in his wisdom, and he finds him\r\na fool; in despair, in the last book of the _Travels_, he turns from\r\nman altogether, and in the brute creation he discovers a charity and\r\nsagacity before which humanity grovels as a creature beastly beyond\r\nmeasure. The last stages of the book are morbid and revolting to the\r\npoint of insanity.\r\n\r\nThe two earlier stages of the _Travels_ have a charm and vivacity\r\nthat delight old and young. The bitterness of the satire lurks in the\r\nallegory, but it is so delicately tinseled over that it does not repel.\r\nThe crowded incidents are plausible and lively, and they are often\r\nspiced with a quaint and alluring humor; his comments upon mankind are\r\nshrewd and arresting, as well as satirical, and are yet not brutal nor\r\nobscene. The style is Swift’s best: not mannered or labored; clean,\r\npowerful, and tireless; easy without being slovenly, and as clear as\r\nsummer noonday.\r\n\r\n   The queen, who often used to hear me talk of my sea-voyages,\r\n   and took all occasions to divert me when I was melancholy,\r\n   asked me whether I understood how to handle a sail or an oar,\r\n   and whether a little exercise of rowing might not be convenient\r\n   for my health. I answered, that I understood both very well;\r\n   for although my proper employment had been to be surgeon or\r\n   doctor to the ship, yet often upon a pinch I was forced to work\r\n   like a common mariner. But I could not see how this could be\r\n   done in their country, where the smallest wherry was equal to\r\n   a first-rate man-of-war among us, and such a boat as I could\r\n   manage would never live in any of their rivers. Her majesty\r\n   said, if I would contrive a boat, her own joiner should make\r\n   it, and she would provide a place for me to sail in. The\r\n   fellow was an ingenious workman, and, by my instructions, in\r\n   ten days finished a pleasure-boat, with all its tackling, able\r\n   conveniently to hold eight Europeans. When it was finished,\r\n   the queen was so delighted that she ran with it in her lap to\r\n   the king, who ordered it to be put in a cistern full of water\r\n   with me in it by way of trial; where I could not manage my two\r\n   sculls, or little oars, for want of room. But the queen had\r\n   before contrived another project. She ordered the joiner to\r\n   make a wooden trough of three hundred feet long, fifty broad,\r\n   and eight deep, which being well pitched, to prevent leaking,\r\n   was placed on the floor along the wall in an outer room of the\r\n   palace. It had a cock near the bottom to let out the water, when\r\n   it began to grow stale; and two servants could easily fill it in\r\n   half an hour. Here I often used to row for my own diversion, as\r\n   well as that of the queen and her ladies, who thought themselves\r\n   well entertained with my skill and agility. Sometimes I would\r\n   put up my sail, and then my business was only to steer, while\r\n   the ladies gave me a gale with their fans; and when they were\r\n   weary, some of the pages would blow my sail forward with their\r\n   breath, while I showed my art by steering starboard or larboard,\r\n   as I pleased. When I had done, Glumdalclitch always carried back\r\n   my boat into her closet, and hung it on a nail to dry.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSEPH ADDISON (1672–1718)\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= Educated at the Charterhouse, Addison went to Oxford,\r\nwhere he became a Fellow of Magdalen College. He early made his mark\r\nas a serious and accomplished scholar, and seems to have attracted\r\nthe notice of the Whig leaders, who marked him out as a future\r\nliterary prop of their faction. He obtained a traveling scholarship of\r\nthree hundred pounds a year, and saw much of Europe under favorable\r\nconditions. Then the misfortunes of the Whigs in 1703 reduced him to\r\npoverty. In 1704, it is said at the instigation of the leaders of the\r\nWhigs, he wrote the poem _The Campaign_, praising the war policy of\r\nthe Whigs in general and the worthiness of Marlborough in particular.\r\nThis poem brought him fame and fortune. He obtained many official\r\nappointments and pensions, married a dowager countess (1716), and\r\nbecame a Secretary of State (1717). Two years later he died, at the age\r\nof forty-seven.\r\n\r\n=2. His Poetry.= In his Latin verses Addison attained early\r\ndistinction. These verses were highly praised at a time when praise\r\nfor proficiency in such a medium was of some significance. Then his\r\n_Campaign_ in 1704 gave him a reputation as one of the major poets of\r\nthe age. The poem is poor enough. It is written in the heroic couplet,\r\nand with some truth it has been called a “rhymed gazette.” The story\r\nis little more than a pompous catalogue of places and persons; the\r\nstyle is but mediocre, and warms only when it is feebly stirred by the\r\nignorant enthusiasm that a sedentary civilian feels for the glory of\r\nwar. The hero is Marlborough, who is drawn on a scale of epic grandeur.\r\nThe most famous passage of the work is that comparing the general to\r\nthe angel that rides the storm. The poem literally made Addison’s\r\nfortune; for after reading it the Whig Lord Treasurer Godolphin gave\r\nhim the valuable appointment of Commissioner of Appeals.\r\n\r\n    ’Twas then great Marlbro’s mighty soul was prov’d,\r\n    That, in the shock of charging hosts unmov’d,\r\n    Amidst confusion, horror, and despair,\r\n    Examin’d all the dreadful scenes of war;\r\n    In peaceful thought the field of death survey’d,\r\n    To fainting squadrons sent the timely aid,\r\n    Inspir’d repuls’d battalions to engage,\r\n    And taught the doubtful battle where to rage.\r\n    So when an angel by divine command\r\n    With rising tempests shakes a guilty land,\r\n    Such as of late o’er pale Britannia past,\r\n    Calm and serene he drives the furious blast;\r\n    And pleas’d th’ Almighty’s orders to perform,\r\n    Rides in the whirlwind, and directs the storm.\r\n\r\nHis only other poetical works worthy of notice are his hymns, which are\r\nmelodious, scholarly, and full of a cheerful piety. The one that begins\r\n“The spacious firmament on high” is among the best.\r\n\r\n=3. His Drama.= Addison was lucky in his greatest dramatic effort, just\r\nas he was lucky in his longest poem. In 1713 he produced the tragedy of\r\n_Cato_, part of which had been in manuscript as early as 1703. It is of\r\nlittle merit, and shows that Addison, whatever his other qualities may\r\nbe, is no dramatist. It is written in laborious blank verse, in which\r\nwooden characters declaim long, dull speeches. But it caught the ear\r\nof the political parties, both of which in the course of the play saw\r\npithy references to the inflamed passions of the time. The play had\r\nthe remarkable run of thirty-five nights, and was revived with much\r\nsuccess. Addison also attempted an opera, _Rosamond_ (1706), which was\r\na failure; and the prose comedy of _The Drummer_ (about 1715) is said,\r\nwith some reason, to be his also. If it is, it adds nothing to his\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\n=4. His Prose.= Several political pamphlets are ascribed to Addison,\r\nbut as a pamphleteer he is not impressive. He lacked the brutal\r\ndirectness of Swift, whose pen was a terror to his opponents. It is in\r\nfact almost entirely as an essayist that Addison is justly famed.\r\n\r\nThese essays began almost casually. On April 12, 1709, Steele published\r\nthe first number of _The Tatler_, a periodical that was to appear\r\nthrice weekly. Addison, who was a school and college friend of Steele,\r\nsaw and liked the new publication, and offered his services as a\r\ncontributor. His offer was accepted, and his first contribution, a\r\nsemi-political one, appeared in No. 18. Henceforward Addison wrote\r\nregularly for the paper, contributing 42 numbers, which may be compared\r\nwith Steele’s share of 188. _The Tatler_ finished in January, 1711;\r\nthen in March of the same year Steele began _The Spectator_, which was\r\nissued daily. The paper had some variations of fortune, price, and\r\ntime of issue, but eventually it ran until December, 1712; obtained\r\nan unprecedented popularity (it was said that in its palmiest days\r\nit sold ten thousand copies of each issue), and exercised a great\r\ninfluence upon the reading public of the period. In _The Spectator_\r\nAddison rapidly became the dominating spirit, wrote 274 essays out\r\nof a complete total of 555, and wholly shaped its policy when Steele\r\ntired of the project. Steele wrote 236 essays. In March, 1713, Addison\r\nassisted Steele with _The Guardian_, which Steele began. It was\r\nonly a moderate success, and terminated after 175 numbers, Addison\r\ncontributing 53.\r\n\r\nIn all, we thus have from Addison’s pen nearly four hundred essays,\r\nwhich are of nearly uniform length, of almost unvarying excellence of\r\nstyle, and of a wide diversity of subject. He set out to be a mild\r\ncensor of the morals of the time, and most of his compositions deal\r\nwith topical subjects--fashions, headdresses, practical jokes, polite\r\nconversation. Deeper themes were handled in a popular and sketchy\r\nfashion--immorality, jealousy, prayer, death, and drunkenness. Politics\r\nwere touched, but gingerly. Sometimes he adopted the allegory as a\r\nmeans of throwing his ideas vividly before his readers; and so we\r\nhave the popular _Vision of Mirza_ and the political allegory of\r\n_Public Credit_. Literary criticism, of a mild and cautious kind,\r\nfound a prominent place in the essays, as well as many half-personal,\r\nhalf-jocular editorial communications to the readers. And, lastly,\r\nthere was the famous series dealing with the Spectator Club.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that Steele first hit on the idea of Sir Roger de\r\nCoverley, an imaginary eccentric old country knight who frequented\r\nthe Spectator Club in London. Around the knight were grouped a number\r\nof contrasted characters, also members of the mythical club. Such\r\nwere Will Honeycomb, a middle-aged beau; Sir Andrew Freeport, a city\r\nmerchant; Captain Sentry, a soldier; and Mr. Spectator, a shy, reticent\r\nperson, who bears a resemblance to Addison himself. Addison seized\r\nupon the idea of the club; gave it life, interest, and adventure;\r\ncast over it the charm of his pleasantly sub-acid humor; and finished\r\nup by making the knight die with affecting deliberation and decorum.\r\nSandwiched between essays on other topics, this series appeared at\r\nintervals in the pages of _The Spectator_, and added immensely to\r\nthe popularity of the journal. In literature it has an added value.\r\nIf Addison had pinned the Coverley papers together with a stronger\r\nplot; if, instead of only referring to the widow who had stolen the\r\nknight’s affections, he had introduced a definite love-theme; if he had\r\nintroduced some important female characters, we should have had the\r\nfirst regular novel in our tongue. As it is, this essay-series brings\r\nus within measurable distance of the genuine eighteenth-century novel.\r\n\r\nWe give an extract to illustrate both his humor and his style. His\r\nhumor is of a rare order. It is delicate, almost furtive; sometimes it\r\nnearly descends to a snigger, but it seldom reveals anything that is\r\nnot gentlemanly, tolerant, and urbane. To Swift, with his virile mind,\r\nsuch a temper seemed effeminate and priggish. “I will not meddle with\r\n_The Spectator_,” he wrote to Stella; “let him _fair sex_ it to the\r\nworld’s end.”\r\n\r\nHis style has often been deservedly praised. It is the pattern of the\r\nmiddle style, never slipshod, or obscure, or unmelodious. He has an\r\ninfallible instinct for the proper word, and an infallible ear for\r\na subdued and graceful rhythm. In this fashion his prose moves with\r\na demure and pleasing grace, in harmony with his subject, with his\r\nobject, and with himself.\r\n\r\n   As I was yesterday morning walking with Sir Roger before his\r\n   house, a country fellow brought him a huge fish, which, he told\r\n   him, Mr William Wimble had caught that very morning; and that he\r\n   presented it with his service to him, and intended to come and\r\n   dine with him. At the same time he delivered a letter, which my\r\n   friend read to me as soon as the messenger left him.\r\n\r\n    “SIR ROGER,\r\n   “I desire you to accept of a jack, which is the best I have\r\n   caught this season. I intend to come and stay with you a week,\r\n   and see how the perch bite in the Black river. I observed with\r\n   some concern, the last time I saw you upon the bowling-green,\r\n   that your whip wanted a lash to it; I will bring half a dozen\r\n   with me that I twisted last week, which I hope will serve you\r\n   all the time you are in the country. I have not been out of the\r\n   saddle for six days last past, having been at Eton with Sir\r\n   John’s eldest son. He takes to his learning hugely.\r\n                     “I am, Sir, your humble servant,\r\n                                                  “WILL WIMBLE”\r\n\r\n   This extraordinary letter, and message that accompanied it,\r\n   made me very curious to know the character and quality of the\r\n   gentleman who sent them; which I found to be as follow:--Will\r\n   Wimble is younger brother to a baronet, and descended of the\r\n   ancient family of the Wimbles. He is now between forty and\r\n   fifty; but being bred to no business and born to no estate,\r\n   he generally lives with his eldest brother as superintendent\r\n   of his game. He hunts a pack of dogs better than any man in\r\n   the country, and is very famous for finding out a hare. He is\r\n   extremely well versed in all the little handicrafts of an idle\r\n   man. He makes a May-fly to a miracle; and furnishes the whole\r\n   country with angle-rods. As he is a good-natured, officious\r\n   fellow, and very much esteemed on account of his family, he is a\r\n   welcome guest at every house, and keeps up a good correspondence\r\n   among all the gentlemen about him. He carries a tulip root in\r\n   his pocket from one to another, or exchanges a puppy between a\r\n   couple of friends, that live perhaps in the opposite sides of\r\n   the country. He now and then presents a pair of garters of his\r\n   own knitting to their mothers or sisters; and raises a great\r\n   deal of mirth among them, by inquiring as often as he meets\r\n   them, how they wear? These gentleman-like manufactures and\r\n   obliging little humours make Will the darling of the country.\r\n                                               _The Spectator_\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR RICHARD STEELE (1672–1729)\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= Steele had a varied and rather an unfortunate\r\ncareer, due largely to his own ardent disposition. Like Addison, he was\r\neducated at the Charterhouse, and then proceeded to Oxford, leaving\r\nwithout taking a degree. His next exploit was to enter the army as\r\na cadet; then he took to politics, became a member of Parliament,\r\nand wrote for the Whigs. Steele, however, was too impetuous to be a\r\nsuccessful politician, and he was expelled from the House of Commons.\r\nHe became a Tory; quarreled with Addison on private and public\r\ngrounds; issued a number of periodicals; and died ten years after his\r\nfellow-essayist.\r\n\r\n=2. His Drama.= Steele wrote some prose comedies, the best of which are\r\n_The Funeral_ (1701), _The Lying Lover_ (1703), _The Tender Husband_\r\n(1705), and _The Conscious Lovers_ (1722). They follow in general\r\nscheme the Restoration comedies, but are without the grossness and\r\nimpudence of their models. They have, indeed, been criticized as being\r\ntoo moral; yet in places they are lively, and reflect much of Steele’s\r\namiability of temper.\r\n\r\n=3. His Essays.= It is as a miscellaneous essayist that Steele finds\r\nhis place in literature. He was a man fertile in ideas, but he lacked\r\nthe application that is always so necessary to carry those ideas to\r\nfruition. Thus he often sowed in order that other men might reap. He\r\nstarted _The Tatler_ in 1709, _The Spectator_ in 1711, and several\r\nother short-lived periodicals, such as _The Guardian_ (1713), _The\r\nReader_ (1714), _The Englishman_ (1715), and _The Plebeian_ (1718).\r\nAfter the rupture with Addison the loss of the latter’s steadying\r\ninfluence was acutely felt, and nothing that Steele attempted had any\r\nstability.\r\n\r\nSteele’s working alliance with Addison was so close and so constant\r\nthat the comparison between them is almost inevitable. Of the two\r\nwriters, some critics assert that Steele is the worthier. In\r\nversatility and in originality he is at least Addison’s equal. His\r\nhumor has none of Addison’s simpering prudishness; it is broader\r\nand less restrained, with a naïve, pathetic touch about it that is\r\nreminiscent of Goldsmith. His pathos is more attractive and more\r\nhumane. But Steele’s very virtues are only his weaknesses sublimed;\r\nthey are emotional, not intellectual; of the heart, and not of the\r\nhead. He is incapable of irony; he lacks penetration and power; and\r\nmuch of his moralizing is cheap and obvious. He lacks Addison’s care\r\nand suave ironic insight; he is reckless in style and inconsequent in\r\nmethod. And so, in the final estimate, as the greater artist he fails.\r\n\r\nThe passage given illustrates Steele’s easy style, the unconstrained\r\nsentences, the fresh and almost colloquial vocabulary, and the genial\r\nhumor.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (_Mr Bickerstaff, the Mr Spectator of “The Tatler,” visits an\r\n                             old friend._)\r\n\r\n   As soon as we were alone, he took me by the hand. “Well, my good\r\n   friend,” says he, “I am heartily glad to see thee; I was afraid\r\n   you would never have seen all the company that dined with you\r\n   to-day again. Do not you think the good woman of the house a\r\n   little altered since you followed her from the playhouse, to\r\n   find out who she was, for me?” I perceived a tear fall down his\r\n   cheek as he spoke, which moved me not a little. But, to turn the\r\n   discourse, said I, “She is not indeed quite that creature she\r\n   was, when she returned me the letter I carried from you; and\r\n   told me, she hoped as I was a gentleman I would be employed no\r\n   more to trouble her, who had never offended me; but would be so\r\n   much the gentleman’s friend as to dissuade him from a pursuit\r\n   which he could never succeed in. You may remember I thought\r\n   her in earnest; and you were compelled to employ your cousin\r\n   Will, who made his sister get acquainted with her, for you. You\r\n   cannot expect her to be for ever fifteen.” “Fifteen!” replied\r\n   my good friend: “Ah! you little understand, you that have lived\r\n   a bachelor, how great, how exquisite a pleasure there is in\r\n   being really beloved! It is impossible that the most beauteous\r\n   face in nature should raise in me such pleasing ideas as when I\r\n   look upon that excellent woman. That fading in her countenance\r\n   is chiefly caused by her watching with me in my fever. This was\r\n   followed by a fit of sickness, which had like to have carried\r\n   her off last winter. I tell you sincerely, I have so many\r\n   obligations to her that I cannot, with any sort of moderation,\r\n   think of her present state of health. But as to what you say of\r\n   fifteen, she gives me every day pleasures beyond what I ever\r\n   knew in the possession of her beauty, when I was in the vigour\r\n   of youth. Every moment of her life brings me fresh instances of\r\n   her complacency to my inclinations, and her prudence in regard\r\n   to my fortune. Her face is to me much more beautiful than when\r\n   I first saw it; there is no decay in any feature which I cannot\r\n   trace from the very instant it was occasioned by some anxious\r\n   concern for my welfare and interests.”\r\n\r\n\r\nDANIEL DEFOE (1659–1731)\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= Much of Defoe’s life is still undetermined, but it\r\nis certain that he was born, lived, and died in poor and somewhat\r\ndisreputable circumstances. He was born in London, became a soldier,\r\nand then took to journalism. He is one of the earliest, and in some\r\nways the greatest, of the Grub Street hacks. He entered the service\r\nof the Whigs, by whom he was frequently employed in obscure and\r\nquestionable work. He died in London, a fugitive from the law, and in\r\ngreat distress.\r\n\r\n=2. His Prose.= This is of amazing bulk and variety, and for\r\nconvenience can be divided into two groups.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Political Writings._ Like most of the other writers of his time,\r\nDefoe turned out a mass of political tracts and pamphlets. Many of them\r\nappeared in his own journal, _The Review_, which, issued in 1704, is in\r\nseveral ways the forerunner of _The Tatler_ and _The Spectator_. His\r\n_Shortest Way with the Dissenters_ (1702) brought upon him official\r\nwrath, and caused him to be fined and pilloried. He wrote one or two\r\nof his political tracts in rough verses which are more remarkable for\r\ntheir vigor than for their elegance. The best known of this class is\r\n_The True-born Englishman_ (1701). In all his propaganda Defoe is\r\nvigorous and acute, and he has a fair command of irony and invective.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _His Fiction._ His works in fiction were all produced in the\r\nlatter part of his life, at almost incredible speed. First came\r\n_Robinson Crusoe_ (1719); then _Duncan Campbell_, _Memoirs of a\r\nCavalier_, and _Captain Singleton_, all three books in 1720; in 1722\r\nappeared _Moll Flanders_, _A Journal of the Plague Year_, and _Colonel\r\nJack_; then _Roxana_ (1724) and _A New Voyage round the World_ (1725).\r\n\r\nThis great body of fiction has grave defects, largely due to the\r\nimmense speed with which it was produced. The general plan of the novel\r\nin each case is slatternly and unequal; as, for example, in _Robinson\r\nCrusoe_, where the incomparable effect of the story of the island is\r\nmarred by long and sometimes tedious narratives of other lands. Then\r\nthe style is unpolished to the verge of rudeness. In homely and direct\r\nnarrative this may not be a grave drawback, but it shuts Defoe out from\r\na large province of fiction in which he might have done valuable work.\r\n\r\nBut at its best, as in the finest parts of _Robinson Crusoe_, his\r\nwriting has a realism that is rarely approached by the most ardent of\r\nmodern realists. This is achieved by Defoe’s grasp of details and his\r\nunerring sense of their supreme literary value, a swift and resolute\r\nnarrative method, and a plain and matter-of-fact style that inevitably\r\nlays incredulity asleep. To the development of the novel Defoe’s\r\ncontribution is priceless.\r\n\r\nIn the passage now given note Defoe’s completely unadorned style, the\r\nloosely constructed sentences, and the almost laughable attention to\r\nthe minutest detail:\r\n\r\n   I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever man\r\n   did who had any of his senses awake. I pleased myself with the\r\n   design, without determining whether I was able to undertake it;\r\n   not but that the difficulty of launching my boat came often into\r\n   my head; but I put a stop to my own inquiries into it, by this\r\n   foolish answer: Let us first make it: I warrant I will find some\r\n   way or other to get it along when it is done.\r\n\r\n   This was a most preposterous method; but the eagerness of my\r\n   fancy prevailed, and to work I went. I felled a cedar-tree,\r\n   and I question much, whether Solomon ever had such a one for\r\n   the building of the Temple at Jerusalem; it was five feet ten\r\n   inches diameter at the lower part next the stump, and four feet\r\n   eleven inches diameter at the end of twenty-two feet, where it\r\n   lessened, and then parted into branches. It was not without\r\n   infinite labour that I felled this tree; I was twenty days\r\n   hacking and hewing at the bottom, and fourteen more getting\r\n   the branches and limbs and the vast spreading head of it cut\r\n   off; after this it cost me a month to shape it and dub it to a\r\n   proportion, and to something like the bottom of a boat, that\r\n   it might swim upright as it ought to do. It cost me near three\r\n   months more to clear the inside, and work it out so as to make\r\n   an exact boat of it: this I did indeed without fire, by mere\r\n   mallet and chisel, and by the dint of hard labour, till I had\r\n   brought it to be a very handsome periagua, and big enough to\r\n   have carried six-and-twenty men, and consequently big enough to\r\n   have carried me and all my cargo.\r\n                                              _Robinson Crusoe_\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER PROSE-WRITERS\r\n\r\n=1. John Arbuthnot (1667–1735).= Arbuthnot was born in\r\nKincardineshire, Scotland, studied medicine at Oxford, and spent the\r\nlatter part of his life in London, where he became acquainted with\r\nPope and Swift. His writings are chiefly political, and include the\r\n_Memoirs of Scriblerus_ (1709), which, though published in the\r\nworks of Pope, is thought to be his; _The History of John Bull_\r\n(1712 or 1713), ridiculing the war-policy of the Whigs; and _The Art\r\nof Political Lying_ (1712).\r\n\r\nArbuthnot writes with wit and vivacity, and with many pointed\r\nallusions. At his best he somewhat resembles Swift, though he lacks the\r\ngreat devouring flame of the latter’s personality.\r\n\r\n=2. Lord Bolingbroke (1678–1751).= Henry St. John, Viscount\r\nBolingbroke, was one of the chief political figures of the period. At\r\nthe age of twenty-six he was Secretary for War in the Tory Government;\r\nwas thereafter implicated in Jacobite plots; was compelled to flee to\r\nFrance; was pardoned, and permitted to return to England in 1723; had\r\nonce more to return to France in 1735; then, after seven years’ exile,\r\nwas finally restored to his native land.\r\n\r\nBolingbroke prided himself on being both a patron of letters and a man\r\nof letters. He influenced Pope, not always to the latter’s advantage.\r\nIn 1753 appeared his _Letter to Windham_ (written in 1717); then in\r\n1749 he produced _Letters on the Spirit of Patriotism_ and _The Idea\r\nof a Patriot King_. These reflect the Tory sentiments of their author,\r\nare written with a vigor that is often near to coarseness, and have all\r\nthe tricks and vices of the rhetorician.\r\n\r\n=3. George Berkeley (1685–1753).= Born in Ireland, Berkeley was\r\neducated at Dublin, where he distinguished himself in mathematics.\r\nTaking holy orders, he went to London (1713), and became acquainted\r\nwith Swift and other wits. He was a man of noble and charitable mind,\r\nand interested himself in many worthy schemes. He was appointed a dean,\r\nand then was made Bishop of Cloyne in 1734. He was a man of great\r\nand enterprising mind, and wrote with much charm on a diversity of\r\nscientific, philosophical, and metaphysical subjects.\r\n\r\nAmong his books are _The Principles of Human Knowledge_, a notable\r\neffort in the study of the human mind that appeared in 1710,\r\n_Dialogues of Hylas and Philonous_ (1713), and _Alciphron, or the\r\nMinute Philosopher_ (1733). He is among the first, both in time and\r\nin quality, of the English philosophers who have dressed their ideas\r\nin language of literary distinction. He writes with delightful ease,\r\ndisdaining ornament or affectation, and his command of gentle irony is\r\ncapable and sure.\r\n\r\n=4. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (1689–1762).= This lady, famous in\r\nher day for her masculine force of character, was the eldest daughter\r\nof the Duke of Kingston. In 1712 she married Edward Wortley Montagu,\r\nand moved in the highest literary and social circles. In 1716 her\r\nhusband was appointed ambassador at Constantinople, and while she was\r\nin the East she corresponded regularly with many friends, both literary\r\nand personal. She is the precursor of the great letter-writers of the\r\nlater portion of the century. Her _Letters_ are written shrewdly\r\nand sensibly, often with a frankness that is a little staggering. She\r\nhad a vivid interest in her world, and to a certain extent she can\r\ncommunicate her interest to her reader.\r\n\r\n=5. Earl of Shaftesbury (1671–1713).= Anthony Ashley Cooper,\r\nthird Earl of Shaftesbury, is another example of the aristocratic\r\n_dilettante_ man of letters. He had little taste for the politics\r\nof the time, and aspired to be famous as a great writer. He traveled\r\nmuch, and died at Naples in 1713.\r\n\r\nHis books are written with great care and exactitude, and are pleasant\r\nand lucid without being particularly striking. His _Characteristics\r\nof Men, Manners, Opinions, and Times_ (1716), though it contains\r\nnothing very original or profound, suited the taste of the time and\r\nwas widely popular. Pope drew upon it for much of his matter in his\r\n_Essay on Man_.\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDER POPE (1688–1744)\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= Pope was born in London, the only child of a\r\nconsiderable city tradesman. From his birth two conditions were to\r\ninfluence very deeply the career of the future poet: first, he was puny\r\nand delicate, and, secondly, he was baptized into the Roman Catholic\r\nfaith. His bodily infirmity, which amounted almost to deformity, caused\r\nhim to be privately educated; and to the end of his life his knowledge\r\nhad that extensive range, joined to the liability to make the grossest\r\nblunders, which is so often the mark of an eager and precocious\r\nintelligence imperfectly trained. Pope’s religious faith, though he\r\nwas never excessively devout as a Roman Catholic, closed to him all\r\nthe careers, professional and political, in which a man of his keen\r\nintelligence might have been expected to succeed. He was thus forced\r\ninto the pursuit of letters as his only road to fame. From his earliest\r\nyouth we find him passionately desirous of making his name as an author.\r\n\r\nHis youth was passed at Binfield, his father’s small estate near\r\nWindsor Forest. Before he was twenty years old he got into touch with\r\nWycherley, now old and besotted. Through him Pope became acquainted\r\nwith Addison, Swift, and Steele, whose friendship he eagerly\r\ncultivated. His early verses, admirably attuned to the ear of the age,\r\nbrought him recognition and applause; his translation of Homer brought\r\nhim wealth; and from that point he never looked back. He became the\r\ndominating poetical personality of the day. In 1718 he removed to his\r\nhouse at Twickenham, whose pinchbeck beauties became the wonder, envy,\r\nand derision of literary and social London. It remained his home till\r\n“that long disease, his life,” was finished in 1744.\r\n\r\n=2. His Character.= In this book it is fortunately seldom that we\r\nare called upon to analyze the character of an English writer in any\r\ndetail, but in the case of Pope it is necessary. With no man more than\r\nPope are such personal considerations relevant and cogent; for in no\r\nwritings more than in Pope’s do we find the author’s vices and his\r\nweaknesses--as well as his virtues--so fully portrayed.\r\n\r\nBy the time he was thirty Pope’s hands were full of the gifts of\r\nfortune, but he was far from being happy. He was so easily stung that\r\nhis numerous detractors were irresistibly impelled to sting him; and\r\nhis agonies, his vicious petulance, and his wild retaliation were so\r\npathetic and yet so ludicrous that his foes were incited to try his\r\ntemper again. Hence much of Pope’s life was a series of skirmishes\r\nwith friends and foes alike. His disposition, too, had so many flaws\r\nthat it trembled at the pressure of a finger. His stinginess, though\r\nhe was rich beyond the dreams of a poet’s avarice, was a byword. His\r\nsnobbishness was extreme; he fawned before lords, and he assailed his\r\nless fortunate poetical brethren with a rancor whose very coarseness\r\nblunts its edge. His vanity was egregious, and shrank from criticism\r\nas a raw nerve shrinks from fire. His nature stooped to actions so\r\ntortuous and reprehensible that his biographers confess, with a sigh\r\nof relief, that they cannot get quite to the bottom of them. His\r\nprocedure in the publication of some of his work almost stupefies the\r\ninvestigator with its combination of duplicity, bad faith, and sheer\r\ncross-grained perversion of the truth.\r\n\r\nYet he had his virtues, to which his friends testified with a curious\r\nhalf-laughing mixture of contempt and admiration. He could sometimes\r\nbe generous in a crabbed, distorted fashion; and if only his friends\r\nallowed for his weaknesses, he repaid their consideration with a\r\ndevoted cordiality that defied the shocks of fortune. At bottom his\r\nnature was not unkindly, but it was corroded and overlaid with the\r\neffects of his physical weakness, with his natural vanity, and with a\r\nshrinking self-criticism. And, above all, he was an artist. He lived\r\nfor his art; everything he wrote was stamped with the joy of creation\r\nand his desire for perfection and permanency; and it is as an artist\r\nthat he will finally be judged.\r\n\r\n=3. His Poetry.= “I lisped in numbers,” he tells us. But his earliest\r\nwork of any importance is his _Pastorals_. According to his own\r\nstatement (which need not be believed) they were begun when he was\r\nsixteen years old. They appeared in 1709, when he was twenty-one. They\r\ncontain the usual trumpery of “sylvan strains,” “warbling Philomel,”\r\nand other expressions that are the bane of the artificial pastoral. Yet\r\nthough the work is immature in some respects, it shows that Pope has\r\nfound his feet with regard to his metrical method. The poem is written\r\nin the heroic couplet, which is neat, effective, and melodious in a\r\nnamby-pamby fashion. We give a specimen of his earliest numbers:\r\n\r\n    And yet my numbers please the rural throng,\r\n    Rough satyrs dance, and Pan applauds the song:\r\n    The nymphs, forsaking ev’ry cave and spring,\r\n    Their early fruit, and milk-white turtles bring;\r\n    Each am’rous nymph prefers her gifts in vain,\r\n    On you their gifts are all bestowed again.\r\n    For you the swains the fairest flow’rs design,\r\n    And in one garland all their beauties join;\r\n    Accept the wreath which you deserve alone,\r\n    In whom all beauties are compris’d in one.\r\n\r\nIn 1711 appeared the _Essay on Criticism_, also written in heroic\r\ncouplets. The poem professes to set forth the gospel of “wit” and\r\n“nature” as it applies to the literature of the period. The work is\r\nclearly immature. There is nothing novel in its theories, which are\r\nconventionality itself; but it dresses the aged theories so neatly\r\nand freshly that the poem is a lasting monument to the genius of the\r\nwriter. It is full of apt, quotable lines that have become imbedded in\r\nthe language:\r\n\r\n    A little learning is a dangerous thing!...\r\n    And snatch a grace beyond the reach of art....\r\n    To err is human: to forgive, divine....\r\n    True wit is nature to advantage dressed....\r\n\r\n_Windsor Forest_ (1713) is another pastoral in the familiar meter.\r\nArtificial still, it nevertheless shows a broader treatment, and a\r\nstill stronger grip of the stopped couplet.\r\n\r\nBy this time Pope was well known, and he set about his ambitious scheme\r\nof translating the _Iliad_, which was eventually issued in 1720. For\r\nthe book, as he was zealously assisted by his literary friends, he was\r\nsuccessful in compiling a phenomenal subscription list, which (with\r\nthe additional translation of the _Odyssey_) brought him more than ten\r\nthousand pounds. Such a triumph produced the inevitable reaction on\r\nthe part of his critics, who maintained that Pope knew little Latin\r\nand less Greek, and that the translation was no translation at all. It\r\ncertainly bears no close resemblance to the original Greek. Bentley,\r\nthe famous classical scholar, remarked to the chagrined author, “A\r\npretty poem, Mr. Pope, but you must not call it Homer.” The line of\r\nPope has none of the great lift of the Homeric line, but it is often\r\nvigorous and picturesque, and answers with fair facility to the demands\r\nhe makes upon it.\r\n\r\n    The troops exulting sat in order round,\r\n    And beaming fires illumined all the ground.\r\n    As when the moon, refulgent lamp of night,\r\n    O’er heaven’s pure azure spreads her sacred light,\r\n    When not a breath disturbs the deep serene,\r\n    And not a cloud o’ercasts the solemn scene,\r\n    Around her throne the vivid planets roll,\r\n    And stars unnumber’d gild the glowing pole,\r\n    O’er the dark trees a yellower verdure shed,\r\n    And tip with silver every mountain’s head:\r\n    Then shine the vales, the rocks in prospect rise,\r\n    A flood of glory bursts from all the skies;\r\n    The conscious swains, rejoicing in the sight,\r\n    Eye the blue vault, and bless the useful light.\r\n\r\nIn 1712, in a volume of Lintot’s _Miscellanies_, appeared _The\r\nRape of the Lock_, one of the most brilliant poems in the language.\r\nThe occasion of it was trivial enough. A Lord Petre had offended a\r\nMiss Fermor by cutting off a lock of her hair; dissensions between the\r\nfamilies had followed, and Pope set about to laugh both parties back\r\ninto good-humor. He makes of the incident a mock-heroic poem, and,\r\nrather unwisely, invents elaborate machinery of sylphs, gnomes, and\r\nother airy beings that take part in the mortals’ misdemeanors. The\r\nlength becomes disproportionate to the theme, but the effect is quite\r\ndazzling. The style is highly artificial and mannered; but we must\r\nremember that Pope is jocular all through, and that he is purposely\r\npitching his style as high as the subject permits. It abounds in\r\nrhetorical devices, such as climax, antithesis, and apostrophe. The\r\neffect produced is like that of a crackle of colored fireworks; smart\r\nepigrams explode in almost every line, and conceits dazzle with their\r\nbrilliance. Yet so great an artist is Pope that by sheer skill he\r\nprevents the work from being flashy or vulgar: the workmanship is too\r\ndelicate and precise.\r\n\r\n    But when to mischief mortals bend their will,\r\n    How soon they find fit instruments of ill!\r\n    Just then, Clarissa drew, with tempting grace,\r\n    A two-edged weapon from her shining case;\r\n    So ladies, in romance, assist their knight,\r\n    Present the spear, and arm him for the fight.\r\n    He takes the gift with reverence, and extends\r\n    The little engine on his fingers’ ends;\r\n    This just behind Belinda’s neck he spread,\r\n    As o’er the fragrant steams she bent her head.\r\n    Swift to the lock a thousand sprites repair,\r\n    A thousand wings, by turns, blow back the hair!\r\n    And thrice they twitched the diamond in her ear;\r\n    Thrice she looked back, and thrice the foe drew near.\r\n    Just in that instant, anxious Ariel sought\r\n    The close recesses of the virgin’s thought:\r\n    As on the nosegay in her breast reclined,\r\n    He watched the ideas rising in her mind,\r\n    Sudden he viewed, in spite of all her art,\r\n    An earthly lover lurking at her heart.\r\n    Amazed, confused, he found his power expired,\r\n    Resigned to fate, and with a sigh retired.\r\n    The peer now spreads the glittering forfex wide\r\n    To enclose the lock; now joins it, to divide.\r\n    E’en then, before the fatal engine closed,\r\n    A wretched sylph too fondly interposed;\r\n    Fate urged the shears, and cut the sylph in twain\r\n    (But airy substance soon unites again),\r\n    The meeting points the sacred hair dissever\r\n    From the fair head, for ever, and for ever!\r\n\r\n_The Dunciad_ appeared in 1728, with many subterfuges to conceal the\r\nauthorship, and it reappeared in a larger, though not in an improved\r\nform, in 1742. In this poem he turns to rend the host of minor writers\r\nwho had been making his life a misery with their pin-pricks. It shows\r\nhis satirical powers at their best and at their worst. It is charged\r\nwith a stinging wit, but is too spiteful and venomous, and confounds\r\nthe good with the bad. Yet here as elsewhere Pope has many fine\r\npassages. The conclusion is probably the noblest that he ever composed:\r\n\r\n    In vain, in vain--the all-composing hour\r\n    Resistless falls: the Muse obeys the Power.\r\n    She comes! She comes! The sable throne behold\r\n    Of Night primeval and of Chaos old!\r\n    Before her, Fancy’s gilded clouds decay,\r\n    And all its varying rainbows die away.\r\n    Wit shoots in vain its momentary fires,\r\n    The meteor drops, and in a flash expires....\r\n    See skulking Truth to her old cavern fled,\r\n    Mountains of casuistry heaped o’er her head!...\r\n    See Mystery to Mathematics fly!\r\n    In vain! They gaze, turn giddy, rave, and die.\r\n    Religion blushing veils her sacred fires,\r\n    And unawares Morality expires....\r\n    Lo! thy dread empire, CHAOS! is restored;\r\n    Light dies before thy uncreating word;\r\n    Thy hand, great Anarch! lets the curtain fall,\r\n    And universal darkness buries all.\r\n\r\nThe last years of his life were occupied chiefly in the composition of\r\npoetical epistles and satires (1731–35). Some of these are of great\r\npower, and show Pope’s art at its best. The _Epistle to Arbuthnot_\r\ncontains the famous satirical portrait of Addison, with whom Pope had\r\nquarreled:\r\n\r\n    Peace to all such; but were there one whose fires\r\n    True genius kindles, and fair fame inspires;\r\n    Blest with each talent and each art to please,\r\n    And born to write, converse, and live with ease:\r\n    Should such a man, too fond to rule alone,\r\n    Bear, like the Turk, no brother near the throne,\r\n    View him with scornful, yet with jealous eyes,\r\n    And hate for arts that caused himself to rise;\r\n    Damn with faint praise, assent with civil leer,\r\n    And without sneering, teach the rest to sneer;\r\n    Willing to wound, and yet afraid to strike,\r\n    Just hint a fault, and hesitate dislike;\r\n    Alike reserved to blame, or to commend,\r\n    A timorous foe, and a suspicious friend;\r\n    Dreading even fools, by flatterers besieged,\r\n    And so obliging, that he ne’er obliged;\r\n    Like Cato, give his little senate laws,\r\n    And sit attentive to his own applause;\r\n    While wits and templars every sentence raise,\r\n    And wonder with a foolish face of praise:--\r\n    Who but must laugh, if such a man there be?\r\n    Who would not weep, if Atticus were he?\r\n\r\nIn this passage, though he does not perceive it, Pope is holding up a\r\nglass to his own method. Observe how he “damns with faint praise”; how\r\nhe is “willing to wound, and yet afraid to strike.” Nearly the whole\r\nextract might be applied to its author.\r\n\r\nThe last considerable poem is the _Essay on Man_ (1734), which\r\nowes much to the suggestions of Bolingbroke. At the beginning of the\r\npoem he says “The proper study of mankind is man,” and then proceeds\r\nwith a long and confused treatment of man and his place in the\r\nuniverse. As a contribution to philosophy it is contemptible, but from\r\nit we can detach clusters of passages full of force and beauty. The\r\nverse has all its author’s care and lucidity. In some places, indeed,\r\nthe style is cut to the very bone, as it is in the well-known line,\r\n“Man never is but always to be blessed.”\r\n\r\n=4. His Prose.= As a writer of prose Pope is of secondary importance.\r\nHis _Letters_, published under a cloud of devious tricks, clearly\r\nare written with an eye on the public. They are addressed chiefly to\r\nnotable persons, such as Swift and Gay, and consist of pompous essays\r\nupon abstract subjects. Sometimes in other letters he forgets himself,\r\nand writes easily and brightly, especially when he is telling of his\r\nown experiences.\r\n\r\n=5. Summary.= It is now useful to draw together the various features of\r\nthe work of this important poet.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Both in subject and in style his poems are _limited_. They\r\ntake people of his own social class, and they deal with their common\r\nexperiences and their common interests and aspirations. Pope rarely\r\ndips below the surface, and when he does so he is not at his best. With\r\nregard to his style, we have seen that it is almost wholly restricted\r\nto the heroic couplet, used in a narrative and didactic subject. He\r\nis almost devoid of the lyrical faculty, and the higher artistic\r\nemotions--“passion and apathy, and glory and shame”--are beyond his\r\nartistic grasp.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Within these limits his work is _powerful_ and _effective_. The\r\nwit is keen; the satire burns like acid; and his zeal is unshakable.\r\nIn serious topics, as in the _Essay on Man_, he can give imperishable\r\nshape to popular opinions.\r\n\r\n(_c_) His work is _careful_ and almost _fastidious_, and thus confers\r\nan enormous benefit upon English poetry. He cured poetry of the\r\nhaphazard methods of the earlier ages. With inspiration lacking, care\r\nwas more than ever necessary, and in this Pope led the way. His verse\r\nreads so easily owing to the great care he took with it.\r\n\r\n    True ease in writing comes from art, not chance,\r\n    As those move easiest who have learned to dance.\r\n                                        _Essay on Criticism_\r\n\r\n(_d_) His _meter_ is among the most discussed in our literature. Its\r\nmerits and demerits are quite clear to view. Against it we can urge its\r\nartificiality, its lack of originality, and the vile creeping paralysis\r\nthat it communicated to the other metrical forms. Yet in its favor we\r\nmust recognize its strength, unbreakable and pliable, like a strong\r\nbow, its clearness, point, and artistic brevity, and its incomparable\r\nexcellence in some forms of satire and narrative. It is unprofitable to\r\ncompare it with blank verse and other forms. We must recognize it as in\r\na class apart.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER POETS\r\n\r\n=1. Matthew Prior (1664–1721).= Born in Dorsetshire, Prior studied\r\nat Cambridge, and was early engaged in writing on behalf of the Tories,\r\nfrom whom he received several valuable appointments. In 1701 he entered\r\nthe House of Commons; and in 1715, becoming involved in Jacobite\r\nintrigues, he was imprisoned. He was liberated in 1717, and died in\r\n1721.\r\n\r\nHis first long work is _The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse_ (1687),\r\nwritten in collaboration with Charles Montagu, and ridiculing _The Hind\r\nand the Panther_. Other longer works are _Alma_ (1716) and _Solomon_\r\n(1718). The first imitates Butler in _Hudibras_, and with fair success;\r\nthe second, written in the heroic couplet, aims at being a serious\r\npoem, but its seriousness is often marred with levity, and it shows no\r\nwisdom or insight.\r\n\r\nPrior’s chief distinction lies in his miscellaneous verse, which is\r\nvaried, bulky, and of a high quality. In some respects it resembles\r\nthe verses of Swift, for much of it is composed in the octosyllabic\r\ncouplet, and it has a fair amount of Swift’s force and dexterity. Prior\r\nlacks Swift’s deadly power and passion, but he surpasses the Dean in\r\nversatility, in an easy wit and impudence, and in sentimentality. In\r\nthis pleasant ease of verse and sentiment he is rarely approached. Some\r\nof the best of his shorter pieces are _The Chameleon_, _The Thief and\r\nthe Cordelier_, and _To Chloe_.\r\n\r\n=2. John Gay (1685–1732).= Gay was born in humble circumstances, and\r\nwas apprenticed to a silk-mercer; but, being ambitious, he entered the\r\nservice of the Duchess of Monmouth (1713). His poems having brought\r\nhim some fame, he sought a public appointment. He was only moderately\r\nsuccessful in this search, and his lazy and indifferent habits spoiled\r\nthe chances that came in his way. He died in London, an amiable and\r\nshiftless idler.\r\n\r\nHis chief works are _Rural Sports_ (1713), written in the heroic\r\ncouplet, and resembling Pope’s _Pastorals, The Shepherd’s Week_ (1714),\r\nand _What d’Ye Call it?_ (1715), a pastoral farce. _Trivia, or The\r\nArt of Walking the Streets of London_ (1715) is a witty parody of the\r\nheroic style, and it contains bright descriptions of London streets;\r\nthen came two plays, _Acis and Galatea_ and _The Beggar’s Opera_\r\n(1728). This last play had a great success, which has lasted to the\r\npresent day. It became the rage, and ran for sixty-two performances.\r\nIt deserved its success, for it contains some pretty songs and much\r\ngenuine though boisterous humor. Gay had the real lyrical gift, which\r\nwas all the more valuable considering the age he lived in. His ballad\r\n_Black-eyed Susan_ is still popular.\r\n\r\n=3. Edward Young (1683–1765).= Young had a long life, and produced\r\na large amount of literary work of variable quality. He was born in\r\nHampshire, went to Oxford, and late in life (about 1730) entered the\r\nChurch. He lived much in retirement, though in his later years he\r\nreceived a public appointment.\r\n\r\nHis major works are _The Last Day_ (1713) and _The Force of Religion_\r\n(1714), which are moralizings written in the heroic couplet; _The Love\r\nof Fame_ (1724), which shows an advance in the use of the couplet; and\r\na poem in blank verse, _The Complaint, or Night Thoughts_ (1742). This\r\nlast poem, which was inspired by the death of his wife, had a great and\r\nlong-enduring popularity, which has now vanished. Like Young’s other\r\npoems, it shows some power of expression and somber satisfaction at his\r\nown misery. In the history of literature it is of some consequence, for\r\nthe blank verse is of considerable strength, and as a reaction against\r\nthe dominance of the couplet its value is undeniable.\r\n\r\n=4. Sir Samuel Garth (1661–1719).= Garth was an older man than most of\r\nthe other poets mentioned in this chapter. He was a popular physician,\r\nassisted Pope in the young man’s first efforts, and was knighted when\r\nGeorge I ascended the throne.\r\n\r\n_The Dispensary_, published in 1699, is the one work which gives\r\nhim his place. It deals with a long-defunct squabble between physicians\r\nand apothecaries, and its importance is due to its being written in a\r\nkind of heroic couplet that is a link in style between Dryden and Pope.\r\n\r\n=5. Richard Savage (1697–1743).= Savage’s melancholy fate, and his\r\nearly friendship with Johnson, have given him a prominence that he\r\nscarcely deserves. He was born in London, and, according to his own\r\nstory, was the child of Richard Savage, Earl Rivers. Savage passed\r\nhis youth in miserable circumstances, took to hack-work with the\r\npublishers, besotted himself with drink and debauchery, and died in a\r\ndebtor’s prison in Bristol.\r\n\r\nHis two chief poems are _The Bastard_ (1728) and _The Wanderer_ (1729).\r\nBoth are written in the heroic couplet, and consist of long frenzied\r\nmoralizings of his own unhappy lot. These works have much energy and\r\nsome power of expression, but they are diffuse and rhetorical in style.\r\nSavage cannot rid himself of his personal grievances, which, inflamed\r\nby his dissipations, produce a morbid extravagance that ruins his work\r\nas poetry.\r\n\r\n=6. Lady Winchilsea (1661–1720).= Born in Hampshire, the daughter of\r\nSir William Kingsmill, Anne, Countess of Winchilsea, passed most of\r\nher life in London, where she became acquainted with Pope and other\r\nliterary notables. Some of her poems, which were of importance in their\r\nday, are _The Spleen_ (1701), a Pindaric ode; _The Prodigy_ (1706); and\r\n_Miscellany Poems_ (1714), containing the _Nocturnal Reverie_.\r\n\r\nWordsworth says, “It is remarkable that, excepting the _Nocturnal\r\nReverie_ and a passage or two in _Windsor Forest_ of Pope, the poetry\r\nof the period intervening between the publication of _Paradise Lost_\r\nand _The Seasons_ does not contain a single new image of nature.” This\r\nstatement is perhaps an exaggeration, but there is no doubt that Lady\r\nWinchilsea had the gift of producing smooth and melodious verse, and\r\nshe had a discerning eye for the beauties of nature.\r\n\r\n=7. Ambrose Philips (1675–1749).= Philips was a Shropshire man, was\r\neducated at Cambridge, and became a considerable figure in the literary\r\nworld. He was a friend of Pope, and wrote _Pastorals_ (1709), which\r\nPope damned with faint praise. The two poets quarreled, and Pope gave\r\nthe other immortality in _The Dunciad_. Philips obtained several posts\r\nunder the Government, and passed a happy and prosperous life.\r\n\r\nHe wrote three tragedies, the best of which is _The Distressed\r\nMother_ (1712). He produced a fair amount of prose for the\r\nperiodicals, and his miscellaneous verse, of a light and agreeable\r\nkind, was popular in its day. His poetry was called “namby-pamby,”\r\nfrom his Christian name; and the word has survived in its general\r\napplication.\r\n\r\n=8. Sir Richard Blackmore (1650–1729).= Blackmore was an industrious\r\nphysician, and an industrious and unsuccessful poet. His name became a\r\nbyword by reason of his huge, dreary epics, which he composed in his\r\nspare time. Some of them are _Prince Arthur_ (1695), _Job_ (1700), and\r\n_The Creation_ (1712). They are written in tolerable heroic couplets.\r\n\r\n=9. Thomas Parnell (1679–1718).= Parnell was born in Ireland, entered\r\nthe Church, became an archdeacon, and prospered in his post. His poems\r\nconsist of miscellaneous work, and were extremely popular in their day.\r\nThe best of his work is contained in _The Hermit_ (1710), which is\r\nwritten in heroic couplets, and in places reminds the reader of _The\r\nDeserted Village_. He shows skill as a versifier, and he has a genuine\r\nregard for nature.\r\n\r\n=10. Allan Ramsay (1686–1758).= Born in Lanarkshire, Ramsay came\r\nto Edinburgh at the age of fifteen, and became a wig-maker. He soon\r\ntook to writing verses, which admitted him into the society of the\r\nEdinburgh wits. He started a bookseller’s shop in the city, and became\r\na kind of local unofficial Poet Laureate. His ballads became very\r\npopular, and he brought upon himself the notice of the leaders of the\r\nliterary world in London.\r\n\r\nRamsay published much miscellaneous writing, of which a large amount\r\nwas issued to satisfy a passing demand. The quality can be poor\r\nenough; but some of it is more meritorious. A piece like _Lochaber\r\nNo More_ is quite noteworthy, and others reveal his freakish and\r\npleasing sense of humor. His _Gentle Shepherd_ (1725), a pastoral\r\ndrama, has many of the vices of its species; but on the other hand\r\nit contains pleasing natural descriptions, some delightful though\r\nsentimental characters, and a few charming lyrics. As a literary\r\nancestor of Burns, Ramsay is important. He influenced the poetry of the\r\nAyrshire man, who freely acknowledged the aid he obtained. Ramsay also\r\nshows how the natural genius of Scotland, while bowing to the supremacy\r\nof the school of Pope, nevertheless diverged on lines natural to itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF LITERARY FORMS\r\n\r\nThe period under review marks a hardening of the process discernible\r\nin the last chapter. The secession from romanticism is complete; the\r\nideals of classicism reign supreme. Yet so unsleeping is the sense of\r\nprogress in our literature that, even at the lowest ebb of the romantic\r\nspirit, a return to nature is feebly beginning. In the next chapter we\r\nshall notice this new movement, for in the next period we shall see it\r\nbecoming full and strong.\r\n\r\n=1. Poetry.= In no department of literature is the triumph of\r\nclassicism seen more fully than in poetry.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The _lyric_ almost disappears. What remains is of a light and\r\nartificial nature. The best lyrics are found in some of Prior’s shorter\r\npieces, in Gay’s _Beggar’s Opera_, and in Ramsay’s _Gentle Shepherd_.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The _ode_ still feebly survives in the Pindaric form. Pope wrote\r\na few with poor success, one of them being _On St. Cecilia’s Day_,\r\nin imitation of Dryden’s ode. Lady Winchilsea was another mediocre\r\nexponent of the same form.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The _satiric_ type is common, and of high quality. The best\r\nexample is Pope’s _Dunciad_, a personal satire. Of political satire in\r\npoetry we have nothing to compare with Dryden’s. Satire tends to be\r\nlighter, brighter, and more cynical. It is spreading to other forms\r\nof verse besides the heroic couplet, and we can observe it in the\r\noctosyllabic couplet in the poems of Swift, Prior, and Gay. A slight\r\ndevelopment is the epistolary form of the satire, of which Pope became\r\nfond in his latter years. Such is his _Epistles of Horace Imitated_.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Narrative Poetry._ This is of considerable bulk, and contains\r\nsome of the best productions of the period. Pope’s translation of Homer\r\nis a good example, and of the poorer sort are Blackmore’s abundant\r\nepics. We have also to notice a slight revival of the ballad, which was\r\nimitated by Gay and Prior. Their imitations are bloodless things, but\r\nthey are worth noticing because they show that the interest is there.\r\n\r\n(_e_) _The Pastoral._ The artificial type of the pastoral was highly\r\npopular, for several reasons. It gave an air of rusticity to the most\r\nformal of compositions; it was thought to be elegant; it was easily\r\nwritten; and it had the approval of the ancients, who made free use\r\nof the type. Pope and Philips have been mentioned as examples of the\r\npastoral poets.\r\n\r\n=2. Drama.= Here there is almost a blank. The brilliant and exotic\r\nflower of Restoration comedy has withered, and nothing of any merit\r\ntakes its place. In tragedy Addison’s _Cato_ is almost the only\r\npassable example. In comedy Steele’s plays are an expurgated survival\r\nof the Restoration type. The only advance in the drama is shown in\r\n_The Beggar’s Opera_, whose robust vitality, sprightly music, and\r\ncharming songs make it stand alone in its generation.\r\n\r\n=3. Prose.= In prose we have to chronicle a distinct advance. For\r\nthe first time we have periodical literature occupying a prominent\r\nplace in the writing of the time. At this point, therefore, it is\r\nconvenient to summarize the rise of periodical literature.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _The Rise of the Periodical Press._ The first periodical\r\npublished in Europe was the _Gazetta_ (1536), in Venice. This was a\r\nmanuscript newspaper which was read publicly in order to give the\r\nVenetians information regarding their war with the Turks. In England\r\nnews-sheets were published during the reign of Elizabeth, but they were\r\nirregular in their appearance, being issued only when some notable\r\nevent, such as a great flood or fire, made their sale secure. The\r\nfirst regular English paper was _The Weekly Newes_ (1622), issued by\r\nNathaniel Butter. The sheet contained some items of news from abroad,\r\nand was devoid of editorial comment or literary matter.\r\n\r\nDuring the Civil War of the middle of the seventeenth century both\r\nRoyalists and Roundheads issued their newspapers, which appeared\r\nspasmodically and seldom survived for any length of time. A Royalist\r\njournal was the _Mercurius Anglicus_, which was succeeded by several\r\nothers of somewhat similar names. The Roundhead publications were the\r\n_Mercurius Pragmaticus_, the _Mercurius Politicus_, and others. After\r\nthe Restoration newspaper-writing became so popular and so troublesome\r\nthat the Government in 1662 suspended all private sheets and issued in\r\ntheir place the one official organ, _The Public Intelligencer_. This\r\nbecame _The Oxford Gazette_ (1665), and finally _The London Gazette_\r\n(1666). The office of Gazetteer became an official appointment, and\r\nSteele held it for a time.\r\n\r\nIn 1682 the freedom of the Press was restored, and large numbers of\r\n_Mercuries_ and other periodicals appeared and flourished in their\r\ndifferent fashions. Advertisements began to be a feature of the papers.\r\nIn _The Jockey’s Intelligencer_ (1683) the charge is “a shilling for a\r\nhorse or coach, for notification, and sixpence for renewing.” In 1702\r\n_The Daily Courant_, the first daily newspaper, was published, and it\r\nsurvived until 1735. Then in the early years of the eighteenth century\r\nthe fierce contests between the Whigs and the Tories brought a rapid\r\nexpansion of the Press. The most famous of the issues were Defoe’s\r\n_Review_ (1704), a Whig organ whose writings brought its editor into\r\ndisrepute; and its opponent _The Examiner_, the Tory paper to which men\r\nlike Swift and Prior contributed regularly. These newspapers are almost\r\nentirely political, but they contain satirical work of much merit.\r\n\r\nThen in 1709 Steele published _The Tatler_. At first it was Steele’s\r\nintention to make it entirely a _news_-paper; but under the pressure\r\nof his own genius and of that of Addison its literary features were\r\naccentuated till the daily essay became the feature of leading\r\ninterest. _The Spectator_, begun in March, 1711, carried the tendency\r\nstill farther. The literary journal has come to stay. Steele’s\r\n_Plebeian_ (1718) is an early example of the political periodical.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The Rise of the Essay._ Johnson defines an essay as “a loose\r\nsally of the mind, an irregular indigested piece, not a regular or\r\norderly performance.” This definition is not quite complete, for it\r\ndoes not cover such an elaborate work as Locke’s _Essay concerning\r\nHuman Understanding_. But for the miscellaneous prose essay, which\r\nit is our immediate business to consider here, the definition will\r\ndo. An essay, therefore, must in other words be short, unmethodical,\r\npersonal, and written in a style that is literary, easy, and elegant.\r\n\r\nThe English essay has its roots in the Elizabethan period, in the\r\nmiscellaneous work of Lodge, Lyly, and Greene, and other literary\r\nfree-lances (see p. 142). Sir Philip Sidney’s _Apologie for\r\nPoetrie_, published about 1580, is a pamphlet that attains a\r\nrudimentary essay-form. But the first real essayist in English is\r\nFrancis Bacon (1561–1626), who published a short series of essays in\r\n1597, enlarged in two later editions (1612 and 1625). His work follows\r\nthat of the French writer Montaigne, whose essays appeared about 1580.\r\nIn Bacon we have the miscellany of theme and the brevity, but we lack\r\nthe intimacy of treatment and of style. Bacon’s essays are rather the\r\ndisconnected musings of the philosopher than the personal opinions of\r\nthe literary executant.\r\n\r\nThe defects of Bacon were remedied by Abraham Cowley (1618–67), who\r\nwrites on such subjects as _Myself_, _The Garden_, and other familiar\r\nthemes. His style is somewhat heavy, but he has a pleasant discursive\r\nmanner, different from the dry and distant attitude of Bacon. He\r\nprovides the link between Addison and Bacon. Another advance is marked\r\nby a group of character-writers who flourished in the first half of\r\nthe seventeenth century. They gave short character-sketches, often\r\nvery acute and humorous, of various types of people. The best known of\r\nsuch writers are Joseph Hall (1574–1656), John Earle (1601–65), and\r\nSir Thomas Overbury (1581–1613). Overbury wrote short accounts of such\r\ntypes as the _Tinker_, the _Milkmaid_, and the _Franklin_. His sketches\r\nare short, are pithily expressed, and reveal considerable knowledge and\r\ninsight.\r\n\r\nDuring the Restoration period we have Dryden’s _Essay of Dramatic\r\nPoesie_ (1666), Locke’s _Essay concerning Human Understanding_ (1690),\r\nand Temple’s _Essay on Poetry_ (1685). The two first works are too\r\nlong to be called essays proper, and fall rather under the name of\r\ntreatises. Temple’s essay, one of many that he published, is rather\r\nlong and formal, but it is nearer the type we are here considering.\r\n\r\nWith the development of the periodical press the short essay takes\r\na great stride forward. It becomes varied, and acquires character,\r\nsuppleness, and strength. The work of Addison and Steele has already\r\nbeen noticed at some length. In _The Tatler_ (1709) and _The\r\nSpectator_ (1711) they laid down the lines along which the essay\r\nwas to be developed by their great successors. Other essayists of the\r\ntime were Swift and Pope, who contributed to the periodicals, and\r\nDefoe, whose miscellaneous work is of wide range and of considerable\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Prose Narrative._ Much of the narrative is still disguised as\r\nallegory, as in Swift’s _Gulliver’s Travels_ and Addison’s _Vision of\r\nMirza_. In his method Swift shows some advance, for he subordinates the\r\nallegory and adds to the interest in the satire and the narrative. The\r\nprominence given to fiction is still more noticeable in the novels of\r\nDefoe, such as _Robinson Crusoe_. We are now in touch with the novel\r\nproper, which will be treated in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Miscellaneous Prose._ There is a large body of religious,\r\npolitical and philosophical work. Much of it is satirical. In\r\npolitical prose Swift is the outstanding figure, with such books as\r\nthe _Drapier’s Letters_; and in religious writing his _Tale of a Tub_\r\nhas a sinister importance. Other examples are Bolingbroke’s _Spirit of\r\nPatriotism_ (political), Berkeley’s _Alciphron_ (philosophical), and\r\nSteele’s _The Christian Hero_ (religious).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF LITERARY STYLE\r\n\r\n=1. Poetry.= In poetry we have to chronicle the domination of the\r\n_heroic couplet_. This meter produced a close, clear, and almost\r\nprosaic style, as we have noticed in the work of Pope. Blank verse is\r\nstill found in Young’s _Night Thoughts_. Another example of blank\r\nverse is found in the mock epic of =John Philips (1676–1708)=\r\ncalled _The Splendid Shilling_ (1703). The use of blank verse at\r\nthis time is important, for it marks both a resistance to the use of\r\nthe couplet and a promise of the revival of the freer forms of verse.\r\nThe following is a fair example of the blank verse of the period. In\r\nstyle it is quite uninspired, and is philosophically dull, but it is\r\nmetrically accurate and has a certain dignity and force.\r\n\r\n    Amidst my list of blessings infinite\r\n    Stands this the foremost, “That my heart has bled.”\r\n    ’Tis Heaven’s last effort of goodwill to man;\r\n    When pain can’t bless, Heaven quits us in despair.\r\n    Who fails to grieve, when just occasion calls,\r\n    Or grieves too much, deserves not to be blest;\r\n    Inhuman, or effeminate, his heart:\r\n    Reason absolves the grief, which reason ends.\r\n    May Heaven ne’er trust my friend with happiness,\r\n    Till it has taught him how to bear it well,\r\n    By previous pain; and made it safe to smile!\r\n                                 YOUNG, _Night Thoughts_\r\n\r\nThe _lyric_ still survives as a pale reflection of the Caroline\r\nspecies. A short specimen will suffice to show the facile versification\r\nand the lack of real passion that marks the treatment of the almost\r\nuniversal love-theme:\r\n\r\n    Blessed as the immortal gods is he,\r\n    The youth who fondly sits by thee,\r\n    And hears and sees thee all the while,\r\n    Softly speak, and sweetly smile.\r\n\r\n    ’Twas this deprived my soul of rest,\r\n    And raised such tumults in my breast;\r\n    For while I gazed, in transport tossed,\r\n    My breath was gone, my voice was lost.\r\n                      AMBROSE PHILIPS, _Sappho_\r\n\r\nThe only other kind of meter of any consequence is the _octosyllabic\r\ncouplet_, which is largely employed in occasional and satirical\r\ncompositions. Its style is neat, sharp, and dexterous, as can be\r\nobserved in Swift’s and Prior’s verses.\r\n\r\n=2. Prose.= In prose the outstanding feature is the emergence of the\r\nmiddle style. Of this the chief exponent is Addison, of whom Johnson\r\nsays, “His prose is of the middle style, always equable, and always\r\neasy, without glowing words and pointed sentences.” We now find\r\nestablished a prose suitable for miscellaneous purposes--for newspaper\r\nand political work, for the essay, for history and biography. The step\r\nis of immense importance, for we can say that with Addison the modern\r\nera of prose is begun.\r\n\r\nAlong with this went the temporary disappearance of ornate prose. Prose\r\nof this style, though it had its beauties, was yet liable to be full\r\nof flaws, and was unacceptable to the taste of the age of Pope. It\r\nwas therefore avoided. When ornate prose re-emerged later in the work\r\nof Johnson and Gibbon it was purged of its technical weaknesses, a\r\ndevelopment largely due to the period of maturing that it had undergone\r\nin the time we are now considering.\r\n\r\nWhile the school of Addison represents the middle style, the plainer\r\nstyle is represented in the work of Swift and Defoe. Swift reveals the\r\nstyle at its best--sure, clean, and strong. Defoe’s writing is even\r\nplainer, and often descends to carelessness and inaccuracy. This is due\r\nalmost entirely to the haste with which he wrote. We give an example of\r\nthis colloquial style:\r\n\r\n   “Well,” said I, “honest man, that is a great mercy, as things\r\n   go now with the poor. But how do you live then, and how are you\r\n   kept from the dreadful calamity that is now upon us all?” “Why,\r\n   sir,” says he, “I am a waterman, and there is my boat,” says he,\r\n   “and the boat serves me for a house; I work in it in the day,\r\n   and I sleep in it in the night, and what I get I lay it down\r\n   upon that stone,” says he, showing me a broad stone on the other\r\n   side of the street, a good way from his house; “and then,” says\r\n   he, “I halloo and call to them till I make them hear, and they\r\n   come and fetch it.”\r\n                             DEFOE, _A Journal of the Plague Year_\r\n\r\n\r\n         TABLE TO ILLUSTRATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF LITERARY FORMS\r\n\r\n    +----+--------------------------------+--------------------+-------------------------------------+\r\n    |    |             POETRY             |        DRAMA       |                PROSE                |\r\n    |    +---------+----------+-----------+----------+---------+------------+----------+-------------+\r\n    |DATE|         |          | Satirical |          |         |            |          |             |\r\n    |    |  Lyric  |Narrative |    and    | Tragedy  |  Comedy | Narrative  |  Essay   |Miscellaneous|\r\n    |    |         |          |  Didactic |          |         |            |          |             |\r\n    +----+---------+----------+-----------+----------+----- ---+------------+----------+-------------+\r\n    |1700|         |Blackmore |Garth      |          |Steele[148]|          |          |             |\r\n    |    |         |          |           |          |         |            |          |Defoe[149]   |\r\n    |    |         |Addison[150]|Lady     |          |         |            |Defoe     |Swift[151]   |\r\n    |    |         |          | Winchilsea|          |         |            |          |             |\r\n    |1710|         |Pope[152] |           |          |         |Addison[154]|Steele[153]|Addison     |\r\n    +----+---------+----------+-----------+----------+---------+------------+----------+-------------+\r\n    |    |         |          |Pope[155]  |A.

Compare the two following passages as examples of satire. They\r\nrepresent the bitterest passages from Dryden and Pope respectively.\r\nRemark upon the two methods--whether they are personal or general,\r\nvindictive or magnanimous.

The following three extracts are from the works of Swift, Addison,\r\nand Defoe. Ascribe each piece to its author, in each case giving\r\ndistinctly your reasons for the selection of the authorship.\r\n\r\n   (1) When we were arrived upon the verge of his estate, we\r\n   stopped at a little inn to rest ourselves and our horses. The\r\n   man of the house had it seems been formerly a servant in the\r\n   knight’s family; and to do honour to his old master, had some\r\n   time since, unknown to Sir Roger, put him up in a sign-post\r\n   before the door; so that the knight’s head had hung out upon\r\n   the road about a week before he himself knew anything of the\r\n   matter. As soon as Sir Roger was acquainted with it, finding\r\n   that his servant’s indiscretion proceeded wholly from affection\r\n   and goodwill, he only told him that he had made him too high\r\n   a compliment; and when the fellow seemed to think that could\r\n   hardly be, added with a more decisive look, That it was too\r\n   great an honour for any man under a duke; but told him at the\r\n   same time, that it might be altered with a very few touches, and\r\n   that he himself would be at the charge of it.\r\n\r\n   (2) I turned away over the fields, from Bow to Bromley, and down\r\n   to Blackwall, to the stairs that are there for landing or taking\r\n   water.\r\n\r\n   Here I saw a poor man walking on the bank or sea-wall, as\r\n   they call it, by himself. I walked awhile also about, seeing\r\n   the houses all shut up; at last I fell into some talk, at a\r\n   distance, with this poor man. First I asked him how people did\r\n   there-abouts? “Alas! sir,” says he, “almost desolate; all dead\r\n   or sick: here are very few families in this part, or in that\r\n   village,” pointing at Poplar, “where half of them are not dead\r\n   already, and the rest sick.” Then pointing to one house, “There\r\n   they are all dead,” said he, “and the house stands open; nobody\r\n   dares go into it. A poor thief,” says he, “ventured in to steal\r\n   something, but he paid dear for his theft, for he was carried to\r\n   the churchyard too, last night.”\r\n\r\n   (3) I arrived at the fleet in less than half an hour. The enemy\r\n   was so frightened when they saw me that they leapt out of their\r\n   ships, and swam to shore, where there could not be fewer than\r\n   thirty thousand souls. I then took my tackling, and fastening\r\n   a hook to the hole at the prow of each, I tied all the cords\r\n   together at the end. While I was thus employed, the enemy\r\n   discharged several thousand arrows, many of which stuck in my\r\n   hands and face; and besides the excessive smart, gave me much\r\n   disturbance in my work. My greatest apprehension was for my\r\n   eyes, which I should have infallibly lost, if I had not suddenly\r\n   thought of an expedient.\r\n\r\n4. We give two extracts, one dramatic and one non-dramatic, from the\r\nblank verse of the time. Does the verse strike you as being passionate,\r\ninteresting, or profound? How would you describe it? Discuss the\r\nmeter--its regularity, melody, and power.\r\n\r\n    (1) It must be so--Plato, thou reason’st well,\r\n        Else whence this pleasing hope, this fond desire,\r\n        This longing after immortality?\r\n        Or whence this secret dread and inward horror\r\n        Of falling into nought? Why shrinks the soul\r\n        Back on herself and startles at destruction?\r\n        --’Tis the Divinity that stirs within us;\r\n        ’Tis heaven itself that points out an hereafter,\r\n        And intimates Eternity to man.\r\n                                            ADDISON, _Cato_\r\n\r\n    (2) Be wise to-day: ’tis madness to defer;\r\n        Next day the fatal precedent will plead;\r\n        Thus on, till wisdom is push’d out of life.\r\n        Procrastination is the thief of time;\r\n        Year after year it steals till all are fled,\r\n        And to the mercies of a moment leaves\r\n        The vast concerns of an eternal scene.\r\n        If not so frequent, would not this be strange?\r\n        That ’tis so frequent, _this_ is stranger still.\r\n                                       YOUNG, _Night Thoughts_\r\n\r\n5. What is the object of Swift in the following satirical passage?\r\nHow does he achieve it? How are the style, figures of speech, and\r\nmeter suited to his purpose? Compare this extract with that from\r\n_Hudibras_ given on pp. 208–9. Which is the wittier and more\r\ndeadly? How is the superiority gained?\r\n\r\n    Hobbes clearly proves that every creature\r\n    Lives in a state of war by nature.\r\n    The greater for the smallest watch,\r\n    But meddle seldom with their match.\r\n    A whale of moderate size will draw\r\n    A shoal of herrings down his maw:\r\n    A fox with geese his belly crams;\r\n    A wolf destroys a thousand lambs:\r\n    But search among the rhyming race,\r\n    The brave are worried by the base.\r\n    If on Parnassus’ top you sit,\r\n    You rarely bite, are always bit.\r\n    Each poet of inferior size\r\n    On you shall rail and criticise,\r\n    And strive to tear you limb from limb;\r\n    While others do as much for him.\r\n        The vermin only tease and pinch\r\n    Their foes superior by an inch.\r\n    So, naturalists observe, a flea\r\n    Hath smaller fleas that on him prey;\r\n    And these have smaller still to bite ’em,\r\n    And so proceed _ad infinitum_.\r\n    Thus every poet in his kind\r\n    Is bit by him that comes behind:\r\n    Who, though too little to be seen,\r\n    Can tease, and gall, and give the spleen.\r\n                                   _Rhapsody on Poetry_\r\n\r\n6. We give an example of Swift’s prose satire, a passage in which he\r\ndescribes the progress of a political lie. What is the figure of speech\r\nunderlying the passage, and how does it assist his purpose? Compare\r\nthis passage with the poetical one given in the last exercise: do the\r\ntwo passages correspond in style, figurativeness, and force? Which\r\nstrikes you as being the more effective?\r\n\r\n   No wonder if an infant so miraculous in its birth should be\r\n   destined for great adventures: and accordingly we see it hath\r\n   been the guardian spirit of a prevailing party for almost twenty\r\n   years. It can conquer kingdoms without fighting, and sometimes\r\n   with the loss of a battle. It gives and resumes employments;\r\n   can sink a mountain to a mole-hill, and raise a mole-hill to\r\n   a mountain; hath presided for many years at committees of\r\n   elections; can wash a blackmoor white; make a saint of an\r\n   atheist, and a patriot of a profligate; can furnish foreign\r\n   ministers with intelligence, and raise or let fall the credit\r\n   of the nation. This goddess flies with a huge looking-glass in\r\n   her hands, to dazzle the crowd, and make them see, according as\r\n   she turns it, their ruin in their interest, and their interest\r\n   in their ruin. In this glass you will behold your best friends,\r\n   clad in coats powdered with _fleurs de lis_, and triple\r\n   crowns; their girdles hung round with chains, and beads, and\r\n   wooden shoes; and your worst enemies adorned with the ensigns of\r\n   liberty, property, indulgence, moderation, and a cornucopia in\r\n   their hands. Her large wings, like those of a flying-fish, are\r\n   of no use but while they are moist; she therefore dips them in\r\n   mud, and soaring aloft scatters it in the eyes of the multitude,\r\n   flying with great swiftness; but at every turn is forced to\r\n   stoop in dirty ways for new supplies.\r\n                                                       _The Examiner_\r\n\r\n\r\n7. “The bulk of your natives appear to me to be the most pernicious\r\nrace of odious little vermin that Nature ever suffered to crawl\r\nupon the face of the earth.” The King of Brobdingnag says this to\r\nGulliver. How far does this represent Swift’s attitude in _Gulliver’s\r\nTravels_, and how far does he succeed in conveying this impression?\r\n\r\n8. “I fared like a distressed prince who calls in a powerful neighbour\r\nto his aid: I was undone by my auxiliary; when I had once called him\r\nin, I could not subsist without dependence on him.” This is Steele’s\r\nown estimate of Addison’s contribution to _The Tatler_ and _The\r\nSpectator_. As far as you can, estimate the share of each writer in\r\nthe production of the two periodicals, and apportion their relative\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n9. How much of their personal peculiarities and weaknesses appears in\r\nthe writings of Swift, Pope, and Steele? How far does the nature of\r\ntheir literary work drive them to this self-revelation?\r\n\r\n10. Account for the decline of the drama during the first half of the\r\neighteenth century.\r\n\r\n11. From an examination of the table given on p. 273 answer the\r\nfollowing questions: What branches of poetry are most weakly\r\nrepresented during the age of Pope? Why is that so? What branch of\r\nprose-writing is the strongest? Why is that so?\r\n\r\n12. Why is the period of Pope called “the Age of Prose”? Does this\r\ndescription of the time need modification?\r\n\r\n13. Give reasons for the rise of periodical literature during this\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n14. The humor of Addison “is that of a gentleman, in which the quickest\r\nsense of the ridiculous is constantly tempered by good nature and good\r\nbreeding.... He preserves a look of demure serenity.... The mirth of\r\nSwift is the mirth of Mephistopheles.... Swift moves laughter, but\r\nnever joins in it.” (Macaulay.)

In the table the lateral position of the\r\ntitle of a work gives an approximate estimate of its approach to\r\nthe Romantic ideal. Such an estimate, especially in the case of the\r\ntransitional poems, cannot be determined absolutely, and need not be\r\ntaken as final. The table, nevertheless, reveals not only the steady\r\ndrift, but also the manner in which the different stages of development\r\noverlap.\r\n\r\n    +------+--------------------------+------------------+---------------------------+\r\n    | DATE |         CLASSICAL        |   TRANSITIONAL   |          ROMANTIC         |\r\n    +------+--------------------------+------------------+---------------------------+\r\n    |      |                          |                  |                           |\r\n    |      |                          |                  |                           |\r\n    | 1730 | _The Dunciad_            |           _The Seasons_                      |\r\n    +------+--------------------------+------------------+---------------------------+\r\n    |      |                          |                  |                           |\r\n    |      | _Epistle to Arbuthnot_   |                  |                           |\r\n    | 1740 | _London_                 |                  |                           |\r\n    +------+--------------------------+------------------+---------------------------+\r\n    |      |                          | _Night Thoughts_ |                           |\r\n    |      |                          |                  |                           |\r\n    | 1750 | _Vanity of Human Wishes_ | Collins’s _Odes_ | _The Castle of Indolence_ |\r\n    +------+--------------------------+------------------+---------------------------+\r\n    |      |                          | Gray’s _Elegy_   |                           |\r\n    |      |                          |                  |                           |\r\n    | 1760 |                          |                  |                           |\r\n    +------+--------------------------+------------------+---------------------------+\r\n    |      |                          |                  |        _Ossian_           |\r\n    |      |                          |  _The Traveller_ |                           |\r\n    | 1770 |                          |                  |        Chatterton’s poems |\r\n    +------+--------------------------+------------------+---------------------------+\r\n    |      |                          |   _The Deserted Village_                     |\r\n    |      |                          |                  |                           |\r\n    | 1780 |                          |                  |                           |\r\n    +------+--------------------------+------------------+---------------------------+\r\n    |      |                          |    _The Village_ |                           |\r\n    |      |                          |                  | _The Task_  Burns’s poems |\r\n    | 1790 |                          |                  |             Blake’s poems |\r\n    +------+--------------------------+------------------+---------------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND (1740–1800)\r\n\r\nThe period covered by the present chapter is that of the middle and\r\nlater stages of the eighteenth century. During this time several\r\nrelevant historical movements call for notice.\r\n\r\n=1. Decline of the Party Feud.= The contest between the Whigs and the\r\nTories still continues, but it is hardly of the previous bitterness.\r\nThe chief reason for this change is found in the weakness of the Tory\r\nparty, which by rash management and precipitate action made itself so\r\nunpopular that for nearly thirty years--those in the middle of the\r\ncentury--the Whigs had hardly any opposition. With the accession of\r\nGeorge III in 1760 the Tories swiftly climbed into power, and, with the\r\nshadow of the French Revolution already looming up, party feeling soon\r\nacquired additional ferocity.\r\n\r\n=2. Commercial and Imperial Expansion.= Under the pacific management\r\nof the great Whig minister Walpole, and owing to the successful wars\r\nof his successors, the eighteenth century saw an immense growth in\r\nthe wealth and importance of the British Empire. On literature this\r\nmaterial welfare had its effect by endowing and stimulating research\r\nand original work. The possession of India and America in itself was\r\nan inspiration, and when the new territories brought new burdens, like\r\nthat of the American revolt, the clash of ideals led to fresh literary\r\neffort, as can easily be seen in the work of Burke.\r\n\r\n=3. The French Revolution.= Long before it burst, the storm of the\r\nRevolution was, in the words of Burke, blackening the horizon. During\r\nthe century new ideas were germinating; new forces were gathering\r\nstrength; and the Revolution, when it did come in 1789, was only the\r\nclimax to a long and deeply diffused unrest. Revolutionary ideas\r\nstirred literature to the very depths; the present chapter, and the\r\nnext as well, are a chronicle of their effects upon the literature of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF TRANSITION\r\n\r\nLike all other periods of transition, the one under review is disturbed\r\nand confused. It is a matter of great difficulty to trace the different\r\ntendencies, but with care the task may be accomplished with some\r\naccuracy.\r\n\r\n=1. The Double Tendency.= Two movements can be clearly observed in\r\nthe writing of the time, namely:\r\n\r\n(_a_) The allegiance to the old order of classicism. In this movement\r\nthe chief and almost the only figure is that of Samuel Johnson. He is a\r\nhost in himself, however.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The search after the new order of Romanticism. In their different\r\ndegrees, as can be seen from the second table at the beginning of this\r\nchapter, many writers were engaged in the search. It began as early as\r\n1730, with the publication of Thomson’s _Seasons_; and though it lapsed\r\nfor a time, it was to continue with gathering force during the latter\r\nyears of the century.\r\n\r\n=2. The New Romanticism.= The general features of the Romantic movement\r\nwere:\r\n\r\n(_a_) A return to nature--to the real nature of earth and air, and not\r\nto the stuffy, bookish nature of the artificial pastoral.\r\n\r\n(_b_) A fresh interest in man’s position in the world of nature. This\r\nled to great activity in religious and political speculation, as will\r\nbe seen further on.\r\n\r\n(_c_) An enlightened sympathy for the poor and oppressed. In English\r\nliterature during this time one has but to think of the work of Cowper,\r\nBurns, and Crabbe, and even of the classically minded Gray, to perceive\r\nthe revolution that is taking place in the minds of men.\r\n\r\n(_d_) A revolt against the conventional literary technique, such as\r\nthat of the heroic couplet. On the other hand, we have a desire for\r\nstrength, simplicity, and sincerity in the expression of the new\r\nliterary ideals.\r\n\r\n(_e_) Fresh treatment of Romantic themes in such poems as _The Lay of\r\nthe Last Minstrel_, _The Ancient Mariner_, _La Belle Dame sans Merci_.\r\n\r\nIn the present chapter we shall perceive all the above features dimly\r\ntaking shape. In the next chapter they will be the dominating features\r\nof the era.\r\n\r\n=3. The New Learning.= The middle and later stages of the\r\neighteenth century show a minor Renaissance that touched nearly\r\nall Europe. The increase in wealth and comfort coincided with a\r\ngeneral uplifting of the standard of the human intellect. In France\r\nparticularly it was well marked, and it took for its sign and seal the\r\nlabors of the Encyclopædists and the social amenities of the older\r\n_salons_. Many of the leading English writers, including Gibbon,\r\nHume, and Sterne, visited Paris, which was the hub of European culture.\r\n\r\nIn England the new learning took several channels. In literature we\r\nhave the revival of the Romantic movement, leading to (_a_) research\r\ninto archaic literary forms, such as the ballad, and (_b_) new editions\r\nof the older authors, such as Shakespeare and Chaucer. The publication\r\nof Bishop Percy’s _Reliques_ (1765) which contained some of the oldest\r\nand most beautiful specimens of ballad-literature, is a landmark in the\r\nhistory of the Romantic movement. Even Pope and Johnson were moved to\r\nedit Shakespeare, though they did it badly. The editions of Theobald\r\nand Warburton were examples of scholarly and enlightened research.\r\n\r\n=4. The New Philosophy.= The spirit of the new thinking, which received\r\nits consummate expression in the works of Voltaire, was marked by keen\r\nskepticism and the zest for eager inquiry. Scotland very early took\r\nto it, the leading Scottish philosopher being Hume. It would seem,\r\nperhaps, that this destructive spirit of disbelief would injure the\r\nRomantic ideal, which delights in illusion. But finally the new spirit\r\nactually assisted the Romantic ideal by demolishing and clearing away\r\nheaps of the ancient mental lumber, and so leaving the ground clear for\r\nnew and fresher creations.\r\n\r\n=5. The Growth of Historical Research.= History appears late in our\r\nliterature, for it presupposes a long apprenticeship of research\r\nand meditation. The eighteenth century witnessed the swift rise of\r\nhistorical literature to a place of great importance. Like so many\r\nother things we have mentioned, it was fostered in France, and it\r\ntouched Scotland first. The historical school had a glorious leader in\r\nGibbon, who was nearly as much at home in the French language as he was\r\nin English.\r\n\r\n=6. The New Realism.= At first, as might be expected, the spirit of\r\ninquiry led to the suppression of romance; but it drew within the\r\ncircle of literary endeavor all the ranks of mankind. Thus we have the\r\nastonishing development of the novel, which at first concerned itself\r\nwith domestic incidents. Fielding and his kind dealt very faithfully\r\nwith human life, and often were squalidly immersed in masses of sordid\r\ndetail. In the widest sense of the word, however, the novelists were\r\nRomanticists, for in sympathy and freshness of treatment they were\r\nfollowers of the new ideal.\r\n\r\n=7. The Decline of Political Writing.= With the partial decay of\r\nthe party spirit the activity in pamphleteering was over; poets and\r\nsatirists were no longer the favorites of Prime Ministers. Walpole,\r\nthe greatest of contemporary ministers, openly despised the literary\r\nbreed, for he did not need them. Hence writers had to depend on their\r\npublic, which was not entirely an evil. This caused the rise of the\r\nman of letters, such as Johnson and Goldsmith, who wrote to satisfy a\r\npublic demand. Later in the century, when the political temperature\r\nonce again approached boiling-point, pamphlets began again to acquire\r\nan importance, which rose to a climax in the works of Junius and Burke.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMUEL JOHNSON (1709–84)\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= Johnson has a faithful chronicler in Boswell, whose\r\n_Life of Johnson_ makes us intimate with its subject to a degree rare\r\nin literature. But even the prying zeal of Boswell could not extort\r\nmany facts regarding the great man’s early life. Johnson was born at\r\nLichfield, the son of a bookseller, whose pronounced Tory views he\r\ninherited and steadfastly maintained. From his birth he was afflicted\r\nwith a malignant skin-disease (for which he was unsuccessfully\r\n“touched” by Queen Anne) which all through his life affected his\r\nsight and hearing, and caused many of the physical peculiarities that\r\nastonished and amused the friends of his later years. After being\r\nprivately educated, he proceeded to Oxford, where he experienced the\r\nmiseries and indignities that are the lot of a poor scholar cursed\r\nwith a powerful and aspiring mind. Leaving the university, he tried\r\nschool-teaching, with no success; married a woman twenty years older\r\nthan himself; and then in 1737 went to London and threw himself into\r\nthe squalors and allurements of Grub Street.\r\n\r\nIn his _Essay on Johnson_ Macaulay has given an arresting description\r\nof the miseries endured by the denizens of Grub Street; and in this\r\ncase even the natural exaggeration of Macaulay is not quite misplaced.\r\nWe know next to nothing regarding the life of Johnson during this early\r\nperiod. It is certain that it was wretched enough to cause the sturdy\r\nold fellow, in after years, to glance at this period of his life with\r\na shudder of loathing, and to quench the curiosity of Boswell with\r\nultra-Johnsonian vehemence. Very slowly he won his way out of the\r\ngutter, fighting every step with bitter tenacity; for, as he puts it in\r\nhis poem of _London_, with all the outstanding emphasis of capitals,\r\nSLOW RISES WORTH BY POVERTY OPPRESSED. From the obscure position of a\r\npublisher’s hack he became a poet of some note by the publication of\r\n_London_ (1738), which was noticed by Pope; his _Dictionary_ (1747–55)\r\nadvanced his fame; then somewhat incomprehensibly he appears in the\r\nlimelight as one of the literary dictators of London, surrounded by a\r\ncircle of brilliant men. In 1762 he received a pension from the State,\r\nand the last twenty years of his life were passed in the manner most\r\nacceptable to him: dawdling, visiting, conversing, yet _living_ with a\r\ngigantic vitality that made his fellows wonder.\r\n\r\nIt is in these latter years that we find him imperishably figured\r\nin the pages of Boswell. All his tricks of humor--his bearishness,\r\nhis gruff goodwill, his silent and secret benevolences; his physical\r\naberrations--his guzzlings, his grunts, his grimaces, his puffings and\r\nwallowings; his puerile superstitions; his deep and beautiful piety;\r\nhis Tory prejudices, so often enormously vocal; his masterful and\r\nunsleeping common sense; the devouring immensity of his conversational\r\npowers: we find all these set out in _The Life of Doctor Johnson_.\r\n\r\n=2. His Poetry.= He wrote little poetry, and none of it, though it\r\nhas much merit, can be called first-class. His first poem, _London_\r\n(1738), written in the heroic couplet, is of great and somber power.\r\nIt depicts the vanities and the sins of city life viewed from the\r\ndepressing standpoint of an embittered and penurious poet. His only\r\nother longish poem is _The Vanity of Human Wishes_ (1749). The poem, in\r\nimitation of the Tenth Satire of Juvenal, transfers to the activities\r\nof mankind in general the gloomy convictions raised ten years earlier\r\nby the spectacle of London. The meter is the same as in _London_, and\r\nthere is the same bleak pessimism, but the weight and power of the\r\nemotion, the tremendous conviction and the stern immobility of the\r\nauthor, give the work a great value. There are many individual lines of\r\nsolemn grandeur. The following passage shows all he has to offer to the\r\nyoung aspirant to literary fame:\r\n\r\n    When first the college rolls receive his name,\r\n    The young enthusiast quits his ease for fame;\r\n    Resistless burns the fever of renown,\r\n    Caught from the strong contagion of the gown.\r\n    O’er Bodley’s dome his future labours spread,\r\n    And Bacon’s mansion trembles o’er his head.\r\n    Are these thy views? Proceed, illustrious youth,\r\n    And Virtue guard thee to the throne of Truth!\r\n    Yet, should thy soul indulge the generous heat\r\n    Till captive Science yields her last retreat;\r\n    Should Reason guide thee with her brightest ray,\r\n    And pour on misty Doubt resistless day;\r\n    Should no false kindness lure to loose delight,\r\n    Nor praise relax, nor difficulty fright;\r\n    Should tempting Novelty thy cell refrain,\r\n    And Sloth effuse her opiate fumes in vain;\r\n    Should Beauty blunt on fops her fatal dart,\r\n    Nor claim the triumph of a letter’d heart;\r\n    Should no disease thy torpid veins invade,\r\n    Nor Melancholy’s phantoms haunt thy shade;\r\n    Yet hope not life from grief or danger free,\r\n    Nor think the doom of man revers’d for thee:\r\n    Deign on the passing world to turn thine eyes,\r\n    And pause awhile from letters, to be wise;\r\n    There mark what ills the scholar’s life assail,\r\n    Toil, envy, want, the patron, and the jail.\r\n    See nations, slowly wise, and meanly just,\r\n    To buried merit raise the tardy bust.\r\n    If dreams yet flatter, once again attend,\r\n    Hear Lydiat’s life and Galileo’s end.\r\n\r\n=3. His Drama.= When he first came to London in 1737 he brought the\r\nmanuscript, in part, of _Irene_, a solemn and ponderous tragedy. In\r\n1749, through the heroic exertions of his old pupil David Garrick, who\r\nwas then manager of Drury Lane Theatre, it was given a hearing, and had\r\na run of nine nights. Even Johnson’s best friends had to admit that\r\nit was no success, and it then utterly disappeared, taking with it\r\nJohnson’s sole claim to dramatic merit.\r\n\r\n=4. His Prose.= Any claim that Johnson has to be called a first-rate\r\nwriter must be based on the merit of his prose; but even his prose\r\nis small in bulk and strangely unsatisfying in kind. His earliest\r\neffort was contributed to Cave’s _Gentleman’s Magazine_, and comprised\r\nParliamentary reporting, in which he fabricated the speeches of the\r\nlegislators, to the great benefit of the legislators. Various hack-work\r\nfollowed; and then in 1747 he planned, and in eight years produced, his\r\n_Dictionary_. He also wrote _The Rambler_ (1750–52) and _The Idler_\r\n(1758–60), which were periodicals in the manner of _The Spectator_,\r\nwithout the ease and variety of their original. To these he regularly\r\ncontributed essays, which were quite popular in their day, though to\r\nmodern notions they would be the reverse of acceptable. They treat\r\nmainly of abstract subjects, and are expressed in an extremely cumbrous\r\nstyle which soon came to be known as Johnsonese. This type of prose\r\nstyle is marked by a Latinized vocabulary, long and balanced sentences,\r\nand an abstract mode of expression. The passage given below illustrates\r\nthese mannerisms, as well as a kind of elephantine skittishness with\r\nwhich Johnson was sometimes afflicted:\r\n\r\n   Another cause of the gaiety and sprightliness of the dwellers\r\n   in garrets is probably the increase of that vertiginous motion,\r\n   with which we are carried round by the diurnal revolution of\r\n   the earth. The power of agitation upon the spirits is well\r\n   known; every man has felt his heart lightened in a rapid\r\n   vehicle, or on a galloping horse; and nothing is plainer, than\r\n   that he who towers to the fifth story is whirled through more\r\n   space by every circumrotation than another that grovels upon\r\n   the ground-floor. The nations between the tropics are known to\r\n   be fiery, inconstant, inventive, and fanciful; because, living\r\n   at the utmost length of the earth’s diameter, they are carried\r\n   about with more swiftness than those whom nature has placed\r\n   nearer to the poles; and therefore, as it becomes a wise man\r\n   to struggle with the inconveniences of his country, whenever\r\n   celerity and acuteness are requisite, we must actuate our\r\n   languor by taking a few turns round the centre in a garret.\r\n                                                    _The Rambler_\r\n\r\n\r\nHe wrote _Rasselas_ (1759) in order to pay for his mother’s funeral.\r\nIt was meant to be a philosophical novel, but it is really a number of\r\n_Rambler_ essays, written in Johnsonese, and strung together with the\r\npersonality of an inquiring young prince called Rasselas. It is hardly\r\na novel at all; the tale carries little interest, the characters are\r\nrudimentary, and there are many long, dull discussions. In the book,\r\nhowever, there are abundant shrewd comments and much of Johnson’s\r\nsomber clarity of vision.\r\n\r\nHis later years were almost unproductive of literary work. Yet he kept\r\nhimself deeply interested in the events of the day. For instance,\r\nhe started a violent quarrel with Macpherson, whose _Ossian_ had\r\nstartled the literary world. We give a letter that Johnson wrote to the\r\nScotsman, which shows that he sometimes wrote as he spoke--crisply,\r\nclearly, and scathingly:\r\n\r\n    MR JAMES MACPHERSON,\r\n   I have received your foolish and impudent letter. Any violence\r\n   offered me I shall do my best to repel; and what I cannot do\r\n   for myself, the law shall do for me. I hope I shall never be\r\n   deterred from detecting what I think a cheat by the menaces of a\r\n   ruffian.\r\n\r\n   What would you have me retract? I thought your book an\r\n   imposture: I think it an imposture still. For this opinion I\r\n   have given my reasons to the public, which I here dare you to\r\n   refute. Your rage I defy. Your abilities, since your Homer, are\r\n   not so formidable; and what I hear of your morals inclines me\r\n   to pay regard not to what you shall say, but to what you shall\r\n   prove. You may print this if you will.\r\n                                                  SAM. JOHNSON\r\n\r\n\r\nHis _Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland_ (1774), a travel\r\nbook, shows the faculty of narrative, and contains passages of great\r\nskill. His last work of any consequence was _The Lives of the Poets_\r\n(1779–81), a series of prefaces to a collection of poetical works. They\r\nare the best specimens of Johnson’s criticism, which is virile and\r\nsagacious, though it is influenced by the emotions of the classical\r\nschool of Pope.\r\n\r\nThus when we come to estimate the value of his work we must arrive at\r\nthe conclusion that the towering eminence which he held among really\r\nable men was due rather to the personality of the man than to the\r\noutstanding genius of the writer. Moreover, it is important to observe\r\nthat he founded no school and left no literary following. He is the\r\nlast of the old generation.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES THOMSON (1700–48)\r\n\r\nThomson can hardly be called a great poet, yet in the history of\r\nliterature he is unusual enough to be regarded (chronologically) as a\r\nfreak. As such he is important, and it is necessary to give him some\r\nprominence.\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= Born near Kelso, close to some of the loveliest valleys\r\non the Scottish side of the Border, Thomson early came to London (1725)\r\nto seek a patron and fame. His _Winter_ (1726), though its novelty\r\nembarrassed the critics, brought him recognition and afterward praise;\r\nhe obtained the patronage of the great, and assiduously cultivated it;\r\ntraveled as a tutor to a noble family; obtained Government places and\r\nemoluments; and passed a happy and prosperous life at his cottage near\r\nRichmond.\r\n\r\n=2. His Poetry.= His _Winter_ was afterward quadrupled in size by\r\nincluding the other three seasons, and became _The Seasons_ (1730). It\r\nis a blank-verse poem, and consists of a long series of descriptive\r\npassages dealing with natural scenes, mainly those with which he was\r\nfamiliar during his youth on the Scottish Border. There is a great\r\ndeal of padding, and the style is often marked by clumsy expressions;\r\nyet on the whole the treatment is exhilarating, full of concentrated\r\nobservation and joy in the face of nature. Above all, it is real\r\nnature, obtained from the living sky and air, and not from books; and,\r\ncoming when it did, the poem exerted a strong counter-influence against\r\nthe artificial school of poetry.\r\n\r\nThomson also wrote _Liberty_ (1736), a gigantic poem in blank verse,\r\nintolerably dull. It had no success. As Johnson says, “The praises of\r\nLiberty were condemned to harbour spiders, and to gather dust.”\r\n\r\nIn the last year of his life he published _The Castle of Indolence_,\r\nwhich is even more remarkable than _The Seasons_. The poem is written\r\nin Spenserian stanzas, and in the true Spenserian fashion it gives a\r\ndescription of a lotus-land into which world-weary souls are invited\r\nto withdraw. The work is imitative, and so cannot claim to be of the\r\nhighest class, but it is an imitation of the rarest merit. For languid\r\nsuggestiveness, in dulcet and harmonious versification, and for subtly\r\nwoven vowel-music it need not shirk comparison with the best of Spenser\r\nhimself. We give three verses of this remarkable poem. Coming at such a\r\nperiod, and expressing as they do the essence of romantic idealism, the\r\nverses are well worth quoting:\r\n\r\n    Full in the passage of the vale above,\r\n    A sable, silent, solemn forest stood,\r\n    Where nought but shadowy forms was seen to move,\r\n    As Idlesse fancied in her dreaming mood;\r\n    And up the hills, on either side, a wood\r\n    Of blackening pines, aye waving to and fro,\r\n    Sent forth a sleepy horror through the blood;\r\n    And where this valley winded out below,\r\n    The murmuring main was heard, and scarcely heard, to flow.\r\n\r\n    A pleasing land of drowsy-head it was,\r\n    Of dreams that wave before the half-shut eye;\r\n    And of gay castles in the clouds that pass,\r\n    For ever flushing round a summer sky:\r\n    There eke the soft delights, that witchingly\r\n    Instil a wanton sweetness through the breast,\r\n    And the calm pleasures, always hovered nigh;\r\n    But whate’er smacked of noyance or unrest,\r\n    Was far, far off expelled from this delicious nest.\r\n\r\n    Joined to the prattle of the purling rills,\r\n    Were heard the lowing herds along the vale,\r\n    And flocks loud bleating from the distant hills,\r\n    And vacant shepherds piping in the dale:\r\n    And now and then sweet Philomel would wail,\r\n    Or stock-doves plain amid the forest deep,\r\n    That drowsy rustled to the sighing gale;\r\n    And still a coil the grasshopper did keep;\r\n    Yet all these sounds yblent inclined all to sleep.\r\n                                       _The Castle of Indolence_\r\n\r\nThomson also wrote some dramas, including one bad tragedy, _Sophanisba_\r\n(1729); and in collaboration with Mallet he produced the masque\r\n_Alfred_ (1740), which happens to contain the song _Rule, Britannia_.\r\nThe song is usually said to be Thomson’s.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLIVER GOLDSMITH (1728–74)\r\n\r\nAs another typical example of the transition poet we take Goldsmith,\r\nwhose work was produced a full generation after that of Thomson.\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= Much of Goldsmith’s early life is obscure, and our\r\nknowledge of it rests upon his own unsupported and hardly reliable\r\nevidence. He was born at Pallas, a small village in County Longford,\r\nin Ireland, and he was the son of the poor but admirable curate of\r\nthe village. His father, the village, and various local features are\r\nduly registered, and unduly idealized, in the poem _The Deserted\r\nVillage_. In 1745 Goldsmith proceeded to Trinity College, Dublin;\r\ngraduated, after some misadventures; and then tried various careers\r\nin turn--law, medicine, and playing the flute--at various places,\r\nincluding Dublin, Edinburgh, Leyden, Venice, and Padua. At the\r\nlast-mentioned place he graduated, according to his own account, as\r\na doctor, and claimed title as such. In truth, a settled career was\r\nbeyond Goldsmith’s capacity. He had all the amiable vices of the stage\r\nIrishman: he was shiftless and improvident, but generous and humane;\r\nunstable and pitifully puerile in mind, but with bright, piercing\r\nflashes of humor and insight. During his years of wandering he roved\r\nover Europe, playing the flute for a living; then in 1756 he returned\r\nto England, poor, unknown, but undaunted.\r\n\r\nThen followed desperate attempts at making a living. In succession he\r\nwas chemist, printer’s reader, usher in a school, and finally (the last\r\nrefuge of the literary down-at-heels) publisher’s hack and a denizen\r\nof Grub Street. In time, however, by their sheer merit, his writings\r\ndrew upon him the regard of famous persons, including Dr. Johnson and\r\nCharles James Fox, the eminent politician. Once recognition came, it\r\ncame with a rush; money and praise poured in; but his feckless habits\r\nkept him poor, and he drifted about in mean London lodgings till his\r\ndeath in 1774. It was said that he brought his doom upon himself by\r\nprescribing for his own ailment. He left debts for two thousand pounds.\r\nDuring his latter years he was a member of Johnson’s famous club,\r\nwhere his artless ways--his bickerings, witticisms, and infantile\r\nvanity--were the cause of the mingled amusement, admiration, and\r\ncontempt of his fellow-members.\r\n\r\n=2. His Poetry.= Though his poetical production is not large, it\r\nis notable. His first poem, _The Traveller_ (1764), deals with\r\nhis wanderings through Europe. The poem, about four hundred lines\r\nin length, is written in the heroic couplet, and is a series of\r\ndescriptions and criticisms of the places and peoples of which he\r\nhad experience. The descriptions, though often superficial and\r\nhalf-informed, are fired with the genius of the man, and are arresting\r\nand noteworthy. His critical comments, which require on his part clear\r\nthinking and some knowledge of social and economic facts, are of hardly\r\nany value. Similar drawbacks are seen in his only other poem of any\r\nlength, _The Deserted Village_ (1770). In this poem, as he deals with\r\nthe memories of his youth, the pathetic note is more freely expressed.\r\nHis natural descriptions have charm and genuine feeling; but his\r\nremedies for the agricultural depression of Ireland are innocently\r\nempty of the slightest practical value.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar humor and pathos of Goldsmith are hard to analyze. Both\r\nemotions arise for simple situations, and are natural and free from\r\nany deep guile, yet they have a certain agreeable tartness of flavor,\r\nand show that Goldsmith was no fool in his observation of mankind.\r\nOften the humor is so dashed with pathos that the combined effect is\r\nattractive to a very high degree. The passage given below illustrates\r\nhis artless emotion naturally expressed:\r\n\r\n    In all my wanderings round this world of care,\r\n    In all my griefs--and God has given my share--\r\n    I still had hopes my latest hours to crown,\r\n    Amidst these humble bowers to lay me down;\r\n    To husband out life’s taper at the close,\r\n    And keep the flame from wasting by repose:\r\n    I still had hopes, for pride attends us still,\r\n    Amidst the swains to show my book-learned skill,--\r\n    Around my fire an evening group to draw,\r\n    And tell of all I felt, and all I saw;\r\n    And as a hare whom hounds and horns pursue,\r\n    Pants to the place from whence at first he flew,\r\n    I still had hopes, my long vexations past,\r\n    Here to return--and die at home at last.\r\n                                  _The Deserted Village_\r\n\r\nGoldsmith’s miscellaneous poems are important, for they include some\r\nof his characteristic humorous and pathetic writing. The ballad called\r\n_The Hermit_ is done in the sentimental fashion, the witty _Elegy on\r\nthe Death of a Mad Dog_ is suggestive of Swift without Swift’s savage\r\nbarb, and the fine lines beginning “When lovely woman stoops to folly”\r\nare among the best he ever wrote.\r\n\r\n=3. His Drama.= Goldsmith wrote two prose comedies, both of which\r\nrank high among their class. The first, called _The Good-natured Man_\r\n(1768), is not so good as the second, _She Stoops to Conquer_ (1773).\r\nEach, but especially the latter, is endowed with an ingenious and\r\nlively plot, a caste of excellent characters, and a vivacious and\r\ndelightful style. Based on the Restoration comedy, they lack the\r\nRestoration grossness. The second play had an immense popularity, and\r\neven yet it is sometimes staged.\r\n\r\n=4. His Prose.= The prose is of astonishing range and volume. Among\r\nhis works of fiction we find _The Citizen of the World_ (1759), a\r\nseries of imaginary letters from a Chinaman, whose comments on English\r\nsociety are both simple and shrewd. This series was contributed to _The\r\nPublic Ledger_, a popular magazine. He wrote many other essays in the\r\nmanner of Addison, almost as well done as those of Addison. His other\r\nimportant work of fiction is his novel _The Vicar of Wakefield_ (1766),\r\nwhich is in the first rank of the eighteenth-century novels. The plot\r\nof the novel is simple, but fairly well handled, the characters are\r\nhuman and attractive, and the book has all the Goldsmith qualities of\r\nhumor and pathos.\r\n\r\nWe give an example of his style. The passage is taken from one of his\r\nessays, in which he sketches the character of a man who, while he\r\npretends to be hard-hearted, is in reality of a generous disposition.\r\nThe humor is typical; it is artless, but it is acute and pervading, and\r\nshows us quite plainly that the writer was by no means the zany that\r\nBoswell (who disliked Goldsmith) desired us to imagine in his _Life\r\nof Johnson_.\r\n\r\n   He was proceeding in this strain, earnestly to dissuade me from\r\n   an imprudence of which I am seldom guilty, when an old man, who\r\n   still had about him the remnants of tattered finery, implored\r\n   our compassion. He assured us that he was no common beggar,\r\n   but forced into the shameful profession, to support a dying\r\n   wife, and five hungry children. Being prepossessed against such\r\n   falsehoods, his story had not the least influence upon me; but\r\n   it was quite otherwise with the man in black; I could see it\r\n   visibly operate upon his countenance, and effectually interrupt\r\n   his harangue. I could easily perceive that his heart burned to\r\n   relieve the five starving children, but he seemed ashamed to\r\n   discover his weakness to me. While he thus hesitated between\r\n   compassion and pride, I pretended to look another way, and he\r\n   seized the opportunity of giving the poor petitioner a piece of\r\n   silver, bidding him at the same time, in order that I should\r\n   hear, go work for his bread, and not tease passengers with such\r\n   impertinent falsehoods for the future.\r\n                                                      _The Bee_\r\n\r\nIn addition, Goldsmith produced a great mass of hack-work, most of\r\nwhich is worthless as historical and scientific fact, but all of\r\nwhich is enlightened with the grace of his style and personality.\r\nSome of these works are _An Inquiry into the Present State of\r\nPolite Learning in Europe_ (1759), his first published book;\r\n_The History of England_ (1762); and _The History of Earth and\r\nAnimated Nature_, a kind of text-book on natural history, which was\r\nunfinished when he died.\r\n\r\n=5. Summary.= Goldsmith’s work is so varied and important that it is\r\nnecessary to summarize briefly. The following are its main features:\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Variety._ In his projected Latin epitaph on Goldsmith, Johnson\r\ngives prominence to the statement that Goldsmith touched on nearly\r\nevery type of writing and adorned them all:\r\n\r\n    Qui nullum fere scribendi genus\r\n              Non tetigit,\r\n    Nullum quod tetigit non ornavit.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Its _high quality_ is also apparent. In matters of knowledge\r\nGoldsmith was deficient, but in grace, charm, and amiable good-humor he\r\nis in the first flight of our writers.\r\n\r\n(_c_) As a _transitional poet_ he is worthy of careful observation.\r\nIn the mechanics of poetry--such as meter, rhyme, and rhetorical\r\ndevices--he follows the older tradition; but in his broad humanity of\r\noutlook, in his sympathetic treatment of natural scenes, and in the\r\nsimplicity of his humor and pathos he is of the coming age.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER TRANSITIONAL POETS\r\n\r\n=1. Thomas Gray (1716–71).= Gray was born in London, the son of a\r\nmoney-scrivener, a kind of lawyer, who was in affluent circumstances.\r\nGray, however, owed his education largely to the self-denial of his\r\nmother; he was educated at Eton and Cambridge, at the latter of which\r\nplaces he met Horace Walpole. With Walpole he toured Italy; then,\r\nreturning to the university, he took his degree, finally settling down\r\nto a life that was little more than an elegant futility. He was offered\r\nthe Laureateship, but refused it (1757); he obtained a professorship\r\nat Cambridge, but he never lectured. He wrote a little, traveled a\r\nlittle; but he was a man of shrinking and fastidious tastes, unapt for\r\nthe rough shocks of the world, and, fortunately for himself, able to\r\nwithdraw beyond them.\r\n\r\nHis first poem was the _Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College_\r\n(1747), which contained gloomy moralizings on the approaching fate\r\nof those “little victims,” the schoolboys. Then, after years of\r\nrevision and excision, appeared the famous _Elegy written in a Country\r\nChurchyard_ (1751). This poem was smooth and graceful; it contained\r\nfamiliar sentiments turned into admirable, quotable phrases; and so,\r\nwhile it was agreeably familiar, it was fresh enough to be attractive.\r\nIts popularity has been maintained to the present day. His _Pindaric\r\nOdes_ (1757) were unsuccessful, being criticized for their obscurity.\r\n_The Bard_ and _The Progress of Poesy_, the two Pindaric Odes in the\r\nbook, certainly require some elucidation, especially to readers not\r\nfamiliar with history and literature. At the first glance Gray’s\r\nodes are seen to have all the odic splendor of diction; in fact, the\r\nadornment is so thickly applied that it can almost stand alone, like\r\na robe stiff with gems and gold lace. Yet the poems have energy and\r\ndignity. Johnson, who had a distaste for both the character and the\r\nwork of Gray, cavils at the work, saying that it has a strutting\r\ndignity. “He is tall by walking on tiptoe. His art and his struggle are\r\ntoo visible.”\r\n\r\nThe prose work of Gray is notable. It consists partly of letters\r\nwritten during his travels, describing the scenes he visits. In them\r\nhe shows vigor of style, a sharp eye and a generous admiration for the\r\nreal beauties of nature. His descriptions, such as those of the Lake\r\nDistrict, are quite admirable, and well in advance of the general taste\r\nof his age.\r\n\r\nIn spite of its slender bulk, Gray’s achievement both in prose and\r\nverse is of great importance. He explored the origins of romance in\r\nthe early Norse and Celtic legends; his sympathies with the poor and\r\noppressed were genuine and emphatically expressed; and his treatment of\r\nnature was a great improvement upon that of his predecessors.\r\n\r\nJohnson’s final estimate of Gray is not unfair, and we can leave the\r\npoet with it: “His mind had a large grasp; his curiosity was unlimited,\r\nand his judgment cultivated; he was likely to love much where he loved\r\nat all, but he was fastidious and hard to please.”\r\n\r\n=2. William Collins (1721–59).= Collins was born at Chichester,\r\nand was educated at Winchester and Oxford, but all his life he was\r\nweighted with the curse of insanity, and for this reason he had to take\r\nuntimely leave of the university. He tried to follow a literary career\r\nin London, but with scant success, being arrested for debt. He was\r\nreleased by the generosity of his publishers, and a fortunate legacy\r\nrelieved him from the worst of his financial terrors. He lapsed into a\r\nmild species of melancholia, finally dying in his native city at the\r\nearly age of thirty-eight.\r\n\r\nThe work of Collins is very small in bulk, and even of this scanty\r\nstock a fair proportion shows only mediocre ability. His _Persian\r\nEclogues_ (1742) are in the conventional style of Pope, and though\r\nthey profess to deal with Persian scenes and characters, the Oriental\r\nsetting shows no special information or inspiration. The book that\r\ngives him his place in literature is his _Odes_ (1747), a small octavo\r\nvolume of fifty-two pages. The work is a collection of odes to Pity,\r\nFear, Simplicity, Patriotism, and kindred abstract subjects. Some of\r\nthe odes are overweighted with the cumbrous creaking machinery of the\r\nPindaric; but the best of them, especially the _Ode to Evening_ (done\r\nin unrhymed verse), are instinct with a sweet tenderness, a subdued and\r\nshadowy pathos, and a magical enchantment of phrase. In the same book\r\ntwo short elegies, one beginning “How sleep the brave” and the other on\r\nJames Thomson (“In yonder grave a Druid lies”), are as captivating,\r\nwith their misty lights and murmuring echoes of melancholy, as the\r\nbest of Keats. In the finest work of Collins, with his eager and\r\nwistful searching, with what Johnson morosely called his “flights of\r\nimagination that pass the bounds of nature,” we are ushered over the\r\nthreshold of romance.\r\n\r\n=3. William Cowper (1731–1800).= Cowper was born at Great\r\nBerkhampstead, in Hertfordshire, where his father was rector. He was\r\nto have been a barrister, and was actually called to the Bar (1754),\r\nbut a great and morbid timidity of disposition, which increased till it\r\nbecame religious and suicidal mania, hampered him cruelly through life.\r\nFamily influence obtained for him a good post on the clerical staff of\r\nthe House of Lords, but his extreme shyness made him quite unfit for\r\nthis semi-public appointment. The consequent disappointment disordered\r\nhis wits, and he attempted suicide, but was fortunately prevented. The\r\nlatter part of his life was spent chiefly at Olney, in Buckinghamshire,\r\nwhere his good friends the Unwins treated him with great kindness and\r\ngood sense. His feeling of gratitude for their care, expressed or\r\nimplicit in many of his poems and letters, is one of the most touching\r\nfeatures in the literature of the time. This comparatively happy\r\nstate of affairs did not last till the end, for the years immediately\r\npreceding his death were much clouded with extreme mental and bodily\r\naffliction.\r\n\r\nCowper’s poems were produced late in life, but in bulk the work is\r\nlarge. It is curiously mixed and attractive in its nature. His _Poems_\r\n(1782) is his first attempt at authorship. The book contains little\r\nthat is noteworthy. The bulk of it is taken up with a collection of set\r\npieces in heroic couplets, quite in the usual manner, on such subjects\r\nas _The Progress of Error, Truth, Hope, and Charity_. At the very end\r\nof the volume a few miscellaneous short pieces are more encouraging\r\nas novelties. One of them is the well-known poem containing the\r\nreflections of Alexander Selkirk (“I am monarch of all I survey”). His\r\nnext work is _The Task_ (1785), a long poem in blank verse, dealing\r\nwith simple and familiar themes and containing many fine descriptions\r\nof country scenes. In places the style is marked by the prevailing\r\nartificial tricks, and as a whole the poem is seldom inspired with any\r\ndeep or passionate feeling; but his observation is acute and humane, it\r\nincludes the homeliest detail within its kindly scope, and he gives us\r\nreal nature, like Thomson in _The Seasons_. At the end of this volume\r\nthe ballad of _John Gilpin_ finds a place. It is an excellent example\r\nof Cowper’s prim but sprightly humor, an extraordinary gift for a\r\nman of his morbid temperament. Other short poems were added to later\r\neditions of his first volume. These include the _Epitaph on a Hare_,\r\ncuriously and touchingly pathetic; lines _On the Receipt of my Mother’s\r\nPicture_, which reveal only too painfully the suppressed convulsions of\r\ngrief and longing that were stirred within him by memories of the past;\r\nand _The Castaway_, written in a lucid interval just before the end,\r\nand sounding like the wail of a damned spirit. The poem gives a tragic\r\nfinality to his life. It describes the doom of a poor wretch swept\r\noverboard in a storm, and concludes:\r\n\r\n    No poet wept him; but the page\r\n      Of narrative sincere,\r\n    That tells his name, his worth, his age,\r\n      Is wet with Anson’s tear;\r\n    And tears by bards or heroes shed\r\n    Alike immortalise the dead.\r\n\r\n    I therefore purpose not, or dream,\r\n      Descanting on his fate,\r\n    To give the melancholy theme\r\n      A more enduring date:\r\n    But misery still delights to trace\r\n    Its semblance in another’s case.\r\n\r\n    No voice divine the storm allay’d,\r\n      No light propitious shone,\r\n    When, snatch’d from all effectual aid,\r\n      We perished, each alone:\r\n    But I beneath a rougher sea,\r\n    And whelm’d in deeper gulfs than he.\r\n\r\nCowper’s letters, private epistles addressed to various personal\r\nfriends, are among the most delightful of their kind. They show the man\r\nat his best--almost jovial in a delicate fashion, keenly observant,\r\nand with a genuine gift for narrative. The style is so clear that the\r\ndisposition of the writer shines through it with unruffled benignity.\r\n\r\nThough Cowper comes late among the transition poets, he does not travel\r\nvery far on the road to novelty. His mind is over-timorous, and he\r\nlacks robustness of temper. But in his feeling for nature, in the ease\r\nand versatility of his poetical work, in his undoubted lyrical gift\r\n(rarely expressed), his work marks an advance far beyond that of the\r\nclassicists.\r\n\r\n=4. George Crabbe (1754–1832).= Crabbe comes very late among the\r\npoets now under review, but in method he is largely of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. He was born in Suffolk, at Aldeburgh, where his father had\r\nbeen a schoolmaster and a collector of customs. He was apprenticed to\r\na surgeon, but later left his native town to seek fame as an author in\r\nLondon (1780). He had little success at first, but gradually attracted\r\nattention. He fixed on a settled career by taking holy orders, and\r\nobtained the patronage of several influential men. Ultimately he\r\nobtained the valuable living of Trowbridge (1814), where he died as\r\nlate as 1832, only a few months before Sir Walter Scott.\r\n\r\nHis chief poetical works are _The Library_ (1781), _The Village_\r\n(1783), which made his name as a poet, _The Borough_ (1810), and\r\n_Tales in Verse_ (1812). The poems in their succession show little\r\ndevelopment, resembling each other closely both in subject and style.\r\nThey are collections of tales, told in heroic couplets with much\r\nsympathy and a good deal of pathetic power, dealing with the lives\r\nof simple countryfolk such as Crabbe encountered in his own parish.\r\nThere is a large amount of strong natural description, though it is\r\nsubsidiary to the human interest in the stories themselves. Crabbe\r\nhas often been criticized for being too gloomy and pessimistic; he is\r\npessimistic in the sense that he is stubbornly alive to the miseries\r\nof the poor, and he is at a loss how to relieve them. His work was\r\nwarmly recognized by Wordsworth and other thinkers who had the welfare\r\nof the poor at heart. Crabbe, however, cannot be classed as a great\r\npoet; he lacks the supreme poetic gift of transforming even squalor and\r\naffliction into things of splendor and appeal; but he is sympathetic,\r\nsincere, and an acute observer of human nature.\r\n\r\n=5. Mark Akenside (1721–70).= Akenside was born at Newcastle,\r\nstudied medicine at Edinburgh, and graduated at Leyden in 1744. He\r\nstarted practice at Northampton, but did not succeed. Later he had\r\nmore success in London. In the capital he took to political writing,\r\nin which he was moderately proficient, and he obtained a pension as\r\na reward. He was a well-known character, and is said to have been\r\ncaricatured by Smollett in _Peregrine Pickle_.\r\n\r\nHis best political poem is his _Epistle to Curio_ (1744), which\r\ncontains some brilliant invective against Pulteney. His best-known book\r\nis _The Pleasures of the Imagination_ (1744), a long and rambling\r\nblank-verse poem. The style is somewhat Miltonic in its energy and its\r\nturn of phrase, but it is deficient in the Miltonic genius. The poem\r\nhas some loud but rather fine descriptive passages, especially those\r\ndealing with his native Tyne, for the beauties of which he shows a\r\nlaudable enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n=6. Christopher Smart (1722–71).= Smart was born in Kent, and was\r\neducated at Cambridge, where he graduated. He was a man of unbalanced\r\nmind, which, leading him into many extravagances, brought him finally\r\nto a madhouse and a miserable death in a debtor’s prison.\r\n\r\nThe poem connected with his name is _The Song to David_ (1763), which\r\nis said to have been partly written on the walls of the madhouse\r\nin which he was confined. The poem, consisting of nearly a hundred\r\nsix-line stanzas, is a wild, rhapsodical effusion, full of extravagance\r\nand incoherence, but in places containing bursts of tremendous poetic\r\npower. The following stanzas, the last in the poem, give an idea of\r\nthese poetical bomb-shells:\r\n\r\n    Glorious the sun in mid career;\r\n    Glorious the assembled fires appear;\r\n      Glorious the comet’s train:\r\n    Glorious the trumpet and alarm;\r\n    Glorious the Almighty’s stretched-out arm;\r\n      Glorious the enraptured main:\r\n\r\n    Glorious the northern lights astream;\r\n    Glorious the song, when God’s the theme;\r\n      Glorious the thunder’s roar:\r\n    Glorious hosanna from the den;\r\n    Glorious the catholic amen;\r\n      Glorious the martyr’s gore:\r\n\r\n    Glorious--more glorious is the crown\r\n    Of Him that brought salvation down,\r\n      By meekness called thy Son;\r\n    Thou that stupendous truth believed,\r\n    And now the matchless deed’s achieved,\r\n      Determined, Dared, and Done.\r\n\r\n=7. William Shenstone (1714–63).= Born at the Leasowes, in\r\nWorcestershire, Shenstone was educated at Oxford. After leaving the\r\nuniversity he retired to his estate, which he beautified in the fashion\r\nof the time. He was a man of an agreeable nature, but was shy and\r\nretiring, and spent nearly all his life in the country.\r\n\r\nHis published works consist chiefly of odes, elegies, and what he\r\ncalled _Levities, or Pieces of Humour_ (often dreary enough), and _The\r\nSchoolmistress_ (1742). His poems are largely pastoral, but they are by\r\nno means the artificial pastoral of Pope. He studies nature himself,\r\nand does not derive his notions from books. In this matter he resembles\r\nCowper. _The Schoolmistress_, which by a notable advance is written in\r\nthe Spenserian stanza, deals in rather a sentimental fashion with the\r\nteacher in his first school; it is sympathetic in treatment, and in\r\nstyle is an interesting example of the transition.\r\n\r\n=8. Charles Churchill (1731–64).= Churchill was educated at Westminster\r\nSchool and at Cambridge, took orders (1756), and obtained a curacy.\r\nWhen he was about twenty-seven years old he suddenly started on a wild\r\ncourse of conduct, abandoned his curacy, took to politics and hack\r\njournalism, and to drinking and debauchery. He died at Boulogne at the\r\nage of thirty-three.\r\n\r\nHe lives in literature as a satirical poet, and the best of his work\r\nis in _The Rosciad_ (1761), a bitter attack on the chief political and\r\nsocial figures of the time. The poem, which is written in the Dryden\r\nheroic couplet, was greeted as the work of a new Dryden, but it has\r\nlittle of that poet’s superb elevation and contempt. It is vigorous and\r\nacute, but it is too often cheap and nasty. It had much popularity,\r\nbut when the topical need for it was over it had no permanent value.\r\nChurchill continued to satirize the age in a wild indiscriminate\r\nfashion in poems called _Night_ (1761), _The Ghost_ (1763), and _The\r\nProphecy of Famine_ (1763).\r\n\r\n=9. Robert Blair (1699–1746).= Blair was born at Edinburgh, and became\r\na clergyman in East Lothian. The poem that brought him his transitory\r\nreputation was _The Grave_ (1743). It is a long blank-verse poem of\r\nmeditation on man’s mortality. It does not make cheerful reading, and\r\nthe sentiments are quite ordinary. It has, however, a certain strength\r\nand dignity, and the versification shows skill and some degree of\r\nfreshness. The poem is reminiscent of Young’s _Night Thoughts_.\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT BURNS (1759–96)\r\n\r\nIn this section we shall deal with those poets who wrote in the middle\r\nand later years of the eighteenth century, and who abandoned the\r\nclassical tradition. In their generation they came too early to be\r\ndefinitely included in the school of Wordsworth and Coleridge, but in\r\ntheir work they are often as romantically inclined as any of their\r\ngreat successors. We begin with Burns, one of the latest, and probably\r\nthe greatest, of Wordsworth’s poetical forbears. With the appearance of\r\nBurns we can say that the day of Romanticism is come. There had been\r\nfalse dawns and deceptive premonitions, but with him we have, in the\r\nwords of Swinburne,\r\n\r\n    A song too loud for the lark,\r\n    A light too strong for a star.\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= He was born in a small clay-built cottage, the\r\nwork of his father’s hands, in the district of Kyle, in Ayrshire. His\r\nfather, a small farmer, was a man of an unbending disposition, and\r\nthe boy had to toil with the rest of the family to wring subsistence\r\nfrom the soil. He had not much formal education, and all his life he\r\ntried spasmodically to improve it; but it was mainly the force of his\r\nown natural ability that permitted him to absorb the moderate amount\r\nof learning he did acquire. As he grew older he showed himself to be\r\nthe possessor of a powerful and lively mind, which was often afflicted\r\nwith spasms of acute mental depression. The audacity of his temper\r\nsoon brought him into extravagances of conduct which were visited by\r\nthe censure and punishment of the rigid Scottish Church. For Burns’s\r\nown sake it is unfortunate that his memory has been pursued with an\r\ninfatuation of hero-worship that seeks to extenuate and even to deny\r\nfacts that are grave and indisputable. One can only say that his chief\r\nweaknesses--drink and dissipation--were largely the faults of his time.\r\nHe was no worse than many other men of his age; but his poetic gifts\r\nproclaimed and perhaps exaggerated his vices, of which he repented when\r\nhe was sober and unwisely boasted when he was otherwise.\r\n\r\nHis life was hard and bitter; his different attempts at farming and at\r\nother occupations met with no success, and he determined to seek his\r\nfortune in the West Indies (1786). In the nick of time he learned that\r\nthe small volume of verse that he had recently issued at Kilmarnock was\r\nattracting much attention, and he was persuaded to remain in Scotland\r\nand discover what fame had in store for him. The reputation of his\r\npoems rose with prodigious rapidity, and within a year there was a\r\ndemand for an Edinburgh edition. He was in Edinburgh in 1787, where he\r\nbecame a nine days’ wonder to the lion-hunting society of the capital\r\ncity. He then obtained a small post in the Excise, and, taking a farm\r\nnear Dumfries, married and essayed to lead a regular life. He found\r\nthis impossible, for fame brought added temptation. His farming was a\r\nfailure, and the income from his poems and from his post in the Excise\r\nwas insufficient to keep him decently. At the age of thirty-seven he\r\ndied at Dumfries, of premature old age.\r\n\r\n=2. His Poetry.= His sole poetical work of any magnitude is his volume\r\nof _Poems_ (1786), which he edited five times during his lifetime, with\r\nnumerous additions and corrections on each occasion. At different times\r\nhe contributed to _The Scots Musical Museum_ and to Thomson’s _Select\r\nScottish Melodies_. After the poet’s death his literary editor, Dr.\r\nCurrie, published (1800) a large number of additional pieces, along\r\nwith a considerable amount of correspondence.\r\n\r\nWe have thus one tale, _Tam o’ Shanter_, which was included in the\r\nthird edition of the poems, that of 1793; one longish descriptive\r\npiece, _The Cotter’s Saturday Night_; more than two hundred songs,\r\nranging in quality from very good to middling; and a great number of\r\nshort epistles, epigrams, elegies, and other types of miscellaneous\r\nverse.\r\n\r\n=3. Features of his Poetry.= The poetry is of such a miscellaneous\r\ncharacter, and its composition was often so haphazard in the matter of\r\ntime, that it is almost impossible to give a detailed chronology of it.\r\nWe shall therefore take it in the mass, and attempt the difficult task\r\nof giving an analysis of its various features.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The best work of Burns was almost entirely _lyrical_ in motive.\r\nHe is one of the rare examples, like Shelley, of the born singer who\r\ncan give to human emotion a precious and imperishable utterance. He\r\nwas essentially the inspired egoist: what interested him was vivid and\r\nquickening; what lay outside his knowledge and experience was without\r\nlife or flavor. He thought of reviving the Scottish drama, but, even\r\nif he had entered on the project, it is doubtful if he would have\r\nsucceeded, for he lacked the faculty of putting himself completely in\r\nanother man’s place. His narrative gift, as it is revealed in _Tam o’\r\nShanter_, becomes fused with the heat of some lyrical emotion (in this\r\ncase that of drunken jollity), and then it shines with a clear flame.\r\nBut with the departure of the lyrical emotion the narrative impulse\r\nends as well.\r\n\r\n(_b_) While keeping within the limits of the lyric he traverses\r\nan _immense range_ of emotion and experience. The feelings he\r\ndescribes are those of the Scottish peasant, but the genius of the poet\r\nmakes them germane to every member of the human race; he discovers\r\nthe touch of nature that makes the whole world kin. Here we have the\r\n“passion and apathy, and glory and shame” that are the inspiration of\r\nthe lyrical poet, and we have them in rich abundance.\r\n\r\n(_c_) His _humor and pathos_ are as copious and varied as his\r\nsubject-matter. His wit can be rollicking to coarseness, as it is in\r\n_The Jolly Beggars_; and there are no poems richer in bacchanalian\r\nflavor than _Willie brewed a Peck o’ Maut_ and _Tam o’ Shanter_. He can\r\nrun to the other extreme of emotion, and be graceful and sentimental,\r\nas in _Afton Water_ and _My Luve is like a Red, Red Rose_. We have\r\nbeautiful homely songs in _John Anderson, my Jo_ and _O’ a’ the Airts_;\r\nand he can be bitter and scornful in such poems as _The Unco Guid_ and\r\n_The Holy Fair_. His pathos ranges from the piercing cry of _Ae Fond\r\nKiss_, through the pensive pessimism of _Ye Banks and Braes_, to the\r\ntempered melancholy of _My Heart’s in the Hielands_. The facility of\r\nthis precious lyrical gift became a positive weakness, for he wrote too\r\nfreely, and much of his songwriting is of mediocre quality.\r\n\r\nWe give brief extracts to illustrate these features of his poetry. The\r\nfirst shows him in his mood of vinous elation; in the second he is\r\nacutely depressed and almost maudlin; the third for pure loveliness is\r\nalmost unexcelled.\r\n\r\n    (1) O, Willie brewed a peck o’ maut,\r\n          And Rob and Allan cam’ to see;\r\n        Three blither hearts, that lee-lang night,\r\n          Ye wad na find in Christendie.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Chorus_\r\n\r\n        We are na fou, we’re nae that fou,\r\n          But just a drappie in our ee;\r\n        The cock may craw, the day may daw,\r\n          And aye we’ll taste the barley bree.\r\n\r\n        Here are we met, three merry boys,\r\n          Three merry boys, I trow, are we;\r\n        And mony a night we’ve merry been,\r\n          And mony mae we hope to be.\r\n\r\n        It is the moon--I ken her horn,\r\n          That’s blinkin’ in the lift sae hie;\r\n        She shines sae bright to wyle us hame,\r\n          But, by my sooth, she’ll wait a wee!\r\n\r\n    (2) Thou ling’ring star, with less’ning ray,\r\n          That lov’st to greet the early morn,\r\n        Again thou usher’st in the day\r\n          My Mary from my soul was torn.\r\n        O Mary! dear departed shade!\r\n          Where is thy place of blissful rest?\r\n        Seëst thou thy lover lowly laid?\r\n          Hear’st thou the groans that rend his breast?\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n        Still o’er these scenes my mem’ry wakes,\r\n          And fondly broods with miser care!\r\n        Time but th’ impression stronger makes,\r\n          As streams their channels deeper wear.\r\n        My Mary, dear departed shade!\r\n          Where is thy place of blissful rest?\r\n        Seëst thou thy lover lowly laid?\r\n          Hear’st thou the groans that rend his breast?\r\n                                        _To Mary in Heaven_\r\n\r\n    (3) O, my luve is like a red, red rose,\r\n          That’s newly sprung in June;\r\n        O, my luve is like the melodie\r\n          That’s sweetly played in tune.\r\n\r\n        As fair art thou, my bonny lass,\r\n          So deep in luve am I;\r\n        And I will luve thee still, my dear,\r\n          Till a’ the seas gang dry.\r\n\r\n        Till a’ the seas gang dry, my dear,\r\n          And the rocks melt wi’ the sun:\r\n        And I will luve thee still, my dear,\r\n          While the sands o’ life shall run.\r\n\r\n        And fare thee well, my only luve!\r\n          And fare thee well a while!\r\n        And I will come again, my luve,\r\n          Though it were ten thousand mile.\r\n\r\n(_d_) The poet’s _political and religious views_ have been given\r\nprominence by his admirers, but they scarcely deserve it. His politics,\r\nas expressed in such poems as _A Man’s a Man for a’ That_, are merely\r\nthe natural utterances of a strong and sensitive mind deeply alive to\r\nthe degradation of his native people. His religious views, in so far as\r\nthey are colored by his unhappy personal experiences with the Scottish\r\nChurch, are of value solely as the inspiration of capital satirical\r\nverse, but in _The Cotter’s Saturday Night_ Burns pays a spontaneous\r\nand beautiful tribute to the piety of the Scottish peasant. The\r\nfollowing extract from _Holy Willie’s Prayer_ sufficiently reveals his\r\npersonal bias:\r\n\r\n    Lord, bless Thy chosen in this place,\r\n    For here Thou hast a chosen race:\r\n    But God confound their stubborn face,\r\n            And blast their name,\r\n    Wha bring Thy elders to disgrace,\r\n            And public shame.\r\n\r\n    Lord, mind Gaw’n Hamilton’s deserts,\r\n    He drinks, and swears, and plays at cartes,\r\n    Yet has sae mony takin’ arts,\r\n            Wi’ great and sma’,\r\n    Frae God’s ain priests the people’s hearts\r\n            He steals awa’.\r\n\r\n    But, Lord, remember me and mine,\r\n    Wi’ mercies temp’ral and divine,\r\n    That I for gear and grace may shine,\r\n            Excelled by nane,\r\n    And a’ the glory shall be Thine.\r\n            Amen, amen!\r\n\r\n(_e_) His _style_ is noteworthy for the curious double tendency that is\r\ntypical of the transition. When he writes in the “correct” manner he\r\nhas all the petty vices of the early school. The opening lines of his\r\n_Address to Edinburgh_ are:\r\n\r\n    Edina! Scotia’s darling seat!\r\n      All hail thy palaces and tow’rs,\r\n    Where once beneath a monarch’s feet\r\n      Sat Legislation’s sov’ran pow’rs!\r\n\r\nHere we see a paltry classicism and a metrical scrupulousness\r\n(leadingto the mutilation of words like “pow’rs”) that were far below\r\nBurns’s notice. The latter vice will be seen even in such poems as _To\r\nMary in Heaven_, quoted above. But when he shakes himself free from\r\nsuch trifling arts his style is full and strong, and as redolent of the\r\nsoil as his own mountain daisy.\r\n\r\n(_f_) As the _national poet_ of Scotland his position is unique. He is\r\nfirst, and the rest nowhere. His rod, like Aaron’s, has swallowed up\r\nthe rods of the other Scottish poets; so that in the popular fancy he\r\nis the author of any striking Scottish song, such as _Annie Laurie_ or\r\n_Auld Robin Gray_. His dominating position is due to three factors:\r\n\r\n(1) He has a matchless gift of catching traditional airs and wedding\r\nthem to words of simple and searching beauty. It is almost impossible\r\nto think of _Auld Lang Syne_ or _Scots wha hae_ or _Green grow the\r\nRashes, O!_ without their respective melodies being inevitably\r\nassociated with them. And these tunes were born in the blood of the\r\nScottish peasant.\r\n\r\n(2) He rejoices in descriptions of Scottish scenery and customs. _The\r\nCotter’s Saturday Night_ is packed with such features, and all through\r\nhis work are glimpses of typical Scottish scenes. The opening stanzas\r\nof _A Winter Night_ are often quoted to show his descriptive power:\r\n\r\n    When biting Boreas, fell and doure,\r\n    Sharp shivers thro’ the leafless bow’r;\r\n    When Phœbus gives a short-liv’d glow’r,\r\n                  Far south the lift,\r\n    Dim-dark’ning thro’ the flaky show’r,\r\n                  Or whirling drift:\r\n\r\n    Ae night the storm the steeples rocked,\r\n    Poor Labour sweet in sleep was locked,\r\n    While burns, wi’ snawy wreeths up-choked,\r\n                  Wild-eddying swirl,\r\n    Or thro’ the mining outlet bocked,[168]\r\n                  Down headlong hurl.\r\n\r\n(3) Lastly, he came just at the time when the Scottish tongue, as a\r\nseparate literary medium, was fast vanishing. The Edinburgh society\r\nthat prided itself on being the equal of the literary society of London\r\nwas soon to pass away with the greatest of Edinburgh writers. Burns\r\ncaptured the dialect of his fellows, and gave it permanence.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER POETS OF THE NEW SCHOOL\r\n\r\n=1. James Macpherson (1738–96).= This writer was born at Kingussie,\r\nin the county of Inverness, and was educated for the Church. He never\r\nbecame a regular minister, for at the age of twenty he was producing\r\nbad poetry, and soon after he definitely adopted a literary career. He\r\ntraveled in the Highlands of Scotland and abroad, settled in London\r\n(1764), and meddled in the politics of the time. Then he entered\r\nParliament, realized a handsome fortune, and died in his native parish.\r\n\r\nAfter producing some worthless verse in the conventional fashion, in\r\n1760 he issued something very different. It was called _Fragments of\r\nAncient Poetry translated from the Gaelic_. The work received a large\r\nshare of attention, and a subscription was raised to allow him to\r\ntravel in the Highlands to glean further specimens of native poetry.\r\nThe fruits of this were seen in _Fingal_ (1762) and _Temora_ (1763).\r\nMacpherson declared that the books were his translations of the poems\r\nof an ancient Celtic bard called Ossian. Immediately a violent dispute\r\nbroke out, many people (including Johnson) alleging that the books were\r\nthe original compositions of Macpherson himself. The truth is that he\r\ngave substance to a large mass of misty Gaelic tradition, and cast the\r\nstories into his peculiar prose style.\r\n\r\nThe controversy hardly matters to us here. What matters is that the\r\ntales deal largely with the romantic adventures of a mythical hero\r\ncalled Fingal. They include striking descriptions of wild nature,\r\nand they are cast in a rhythmic and melodious prose that is meant to\r\nreproduce the original Gaelic poetical measure. As an essay in the\r\nRomantic method these works are of very high value. (See p. 349.)\r\n\r\n=2. Thomas Chatterton (1752–70).= Chatterton was born at Bristol,\r\nand was apprenticed to an attorney. At the age of eighteen he went to\r\nLondon to seek his fortune as a poet. Almost at once he lapsed into\r\npenury, and, being too proud to beg, poisoned himself with arsenic. He\r\nwas eighteen years old.\r\n\r\nThe brevity and pathos of Chatterton’s career have invested it with a\r\nfame peculiar in our literature. He is held up as the martyr of genius,\r\nsacrificed by the callousness of the public. His fate, however, was\r\nlargely due to his own vanity and recklessness, and his genius has\r\nperhaps been overrated. In 1768, while still at Bristol, he issued\r\na collection of poems which seemed archaic in style and spelling.\r\nThese, he said, he had found in an ancient chest lodged in a church in\r\nBristol; and he further stated that most of them had been written by a\r\nmonk of the fifteenth century, by name Thomas Rowley. The collection\r\nreceived the name of _The Rowley Poems_, and includes several ballads,\r\none of which is _The Battle of Hastings_, and some descriptive and\r\nlyrical pieces, such as _Songs to Ælla_. A slight knowledge of Middle\r\nEnglish reveals that they are forgeries thinly disguised with antique\r\nspelling and phraseology; but, especially after their author’s death,\r\nthey gained much currency, and had some influence on their time. There\r\nis much rubbish in the poems, but in detached passages there is real\r\nbeauty, along with a marvelous precocity of thought.\r\n\r\n=3. William Blake (1757–1827).= Blake was a Londoner, being born the\r\nson of a City hosier. At the age of ten he was an artist; at the age of\r\ntwelve he was a poet; and thereafter his father apprenticed him to an\r\nengraver. All his life Blake saw visions and dreamed dreams, hovering\r\non the brink of insanity; and his mental peculiarities are abundantly\r\nrevealed in the two arts that he made his own. His engravings and his\r\npoems, conceived on wild and fantastic lines, kept him fully occupied\r\nall his life, though they brought him neither money nor fame. But\r\nhis desires were easily satisfied, and he died poor and unknown, but\r\ncheerful and serene, in the city of his birth.\r\n\r\nHis chief poetical works are _Poetical Sketches_ (1783), _Songs\r\nof Innocence_ (1789), and _Songs of Experience_ (1794). They are\r\nextraordinary compositions, full of unearthly visions, charming\r\nsimplicity, and baffling obscurity. His genius is undoubted, but it is\r\nwayward and fitful, the sport of his unbalanced mind. His astonishing\r\nlines on the tiger are well known, and are a good specimen of his\r\npoetical gifts:\r\n\r\n    Tiger, tiger, burning bright\r\n    In the forests of the night,\r\n    What immortal hand or eye\r\n    Could frame thy fearful symmetry?\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    And what shoulder and what art\r\n    Could twist the sinews of thy heart?\r\n    And, when thy heart began to beat,\r\n    What dread hand and what dread feet?\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    When the stars threw down their spears,\r\n    And water’d heaven with their tears,\r\n    Did He smile His work to see?\r\n    Did He who made the lamb make thee?\r\n\r\n=4. Robert Fergusson (1750–74).= Fergusson was born in Edinburgh, and\r\nreceived his education at the university of that city, but soon fell\r\ninto loose and disreputable habits. He contributed much to the local\r\npress, and acquired some reputation as a poet of the vernacular. His\r\nirregular habits led to the madhouse, in which he died at the early age\r\nof twenty-four.\r\n\r\nFergusson is chiefly notable as the forerunner of Burns, who was\r\ngenerous in his praise of the earlier poet. His best poems are short\r\ndescriptive pieces dealing with Scottish life, such as _The King’s\r\nBirthday_, _To the Tron Kirk_, and _The Farmer’s Ingle_. This last poem\r\nperhaps suggested Burns’s _Cotter’s Saturday Night_. Fergusson gives\r\nclear and accurate descriptions, and his use of the vernacular Scots\r\ntongue is vigorous and natural, thus providing Burns with a model for\r\nhis best style. (See p. 346.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMUEL RICHARDSON (1689–1761)\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= Richardson was born in Derbyshire, the son of a\r\njoiner, by whom he was apprenticed to a London printer. Richardson\r\nwas an industrious youth, and in the course of time rose high in the\r\npursuit of his occupation. He became a master-printer, produced the\r\njournals of the House of Commons, and became printer to the King. He\r\nwas a man of retiring and almost effeminate habits, but was generous\r\nand well liked.\r\n\r\n=2. His Novels.= Richardson’s first attempts at writing fiction\r\nbegan at the age of thirteen, when he was the confidant of three\r\nilliterate young women, for whom he wrote love-letters. This practice\r\nafterward stood him in good stead. He was over fifty years old before\r\nhe printed a novel of his own, called _Pamela_ (1740). The book,\r\nwhich takes the form of a series of fictitious letters, deals with\r\nthe fortunes of Pamela, a poor and virtuous maid of low degree, who\r\nmarries and afterward reforms her wicked master. The work was instantly\r\nsuccessful, exhausting five editions during the first year of its\r\nissue. The characters, especially the chief female character, slowly\r\nbut accurately fabricated during the gradual evolution of the simple\r\nplot, were new to the readers of the time, and mark a great step\r\nforward in the history of the English novel. Richardson’s next novel,\r\nwhich was also constructed in the form of letters, was _Clarissa\r\nHarlowe_ (1749). This treats of characters higher in the social\r\nscale, with indifferent success, and the end is made tragical. The\r\nheroine is a young lady of rank and fortune who is persecuted by a\r\nvillain called Lovelace, and who dies finally of a broken heart.\r\nHis third and last novel, also in letter-form, was _Sir Charles\r\nGrandison_ (1753), dealing chiefly with persons still higher in\r\nthe social world. Richardson contemplated calling the book _A Good\r\nMan_, for he intended the hero to be the perfection of the manly\r\nvirtues. But Sir Charles is too good, and succeeds only in being\r\ntedious and unreal. The character of the social _milieu_ in which\r\nthe action is cast also weighs heavily upon Richardson, with the\r\nresult that this book, which he intended to be his masterpiece, is the\r\nhollowest of the three.\r\n\r\n=3. Features of his Novels.= Richardson’s works are largely the\r\nreflection of the man himself, and, in spite of their faults and\r\nlimitations, are of immense importance in the development of the novel.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Their most prominent feature is their _immense length_. In the\r\nlast two works this is most noticeable.\r\n\r\n(_b_) In spite of the great length of the books, the _plots_ have\r\nlittle complexity; the length is due to an enormous accumulation of\r\ndetail, both of character and incident, which is ingenious, but clogs\r\nthe course of the story. He is really an adept in the minute analysis\r\nof motive and emotion, which gradually evolves a character that is\r\nentire and convincing, and he fills in his sketch with a multitude of\r\ntiny strokes.\r\n\r\n(_c_) His novels convey the general impression of a certain kind\r\nof bloodlessness--a literary anemia--that is due to several causes.\r\nHis themes are those of love-making; they are handled with a great\r\nparade of morality, but have nevertheless a simpering prudishness that\r\nconveys a stealthy suggestion of immorality. Then his good people are\r\nlaboriously virtuous; his villains are stuffily vile; he is devoid\r\nof humor; the action is too frequently indoors; the sentiment is\r\nprotracted and sickly. After a spell of reading such work one is glad\r\nto escape into the open air.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Yet his merits are very real, and the cumbrous machinery\r\nof the letter-series assists him. His character-drawing is among the\r\nbest of his time, and is still among the most remarkable in English;\r\nhe is specially happy in his treatment of feminine characters; his use\r\nof dialogue shows an advance, though it might be even more frequently\r\nemployed. He gives a good start to the modern novel, though it is still\r\na long distance from maturity.\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY FIELDING (1707–54)\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= A cadet of an ancient family, Fielding was born in\r\nSomersetshire, was educated at Eton, and studied law at Leyden. Lack\r\nof funds stopped his legal studies for a time; he took to writing\r\nplays for a living, but the plays were of little merit; then, having\r\nmarried, he resumed his studies and was called to the Bar. After some\r\ntime in practice he was appointed (1749) Bow Street magistrate, a post\r\nwhich brought him a small income (“of the dirtiest money on earth,”\r\nas he said) and much hard work. His magisterial duties, however, had\r\ntheir compensations, for they gave him a close view of many types of\r\nhuman criminality which was of much use to him in his novels. Fielding\r\nhimself was no Puritan, and his own excesses helped to undermine his\r\nconstitution. In the hope that it would improve his health, he took a\r\nvoyage to Portugal (1754); but he died some months after landing, and\r\nwas buried at Lisbon.\r\n\r\n=2. His Novels.= In 1742 appeared _Joseph Andrews_, which begins in\r\na loud guffaw of laughter--not unkind, but not very delicate--at the\r\nnamby-pamby Pamela of Richardson. In the story Joseph Andrews, the\r\nhero, is a footman, and the brother of Pamela. Along with a poor and\r\nsimple curate called Abraham Adams he survives numerous ridiculous\r\nadventures. In a short time Fielding forgets about the burlesque,\r\nbecomes interested in his own story, and we then see a novel of a\r\nnew and powerful kind. From the very beginning we get the Fielding\r\ntouch: the complete rejection of the letter-method; the bustle and\r\nsweep of the tale; the broad and vivacious humor; the genial and\r\nhalf-contemptuous insight into human nature; and the forcible and\r\npithy prose style. His next works were _A Journey from this World to\r\nthe Next_ (1743) and _Jonathan Wild the Great_ (1743). _Jonathan Wild_\r\nis the biography of the famous thief and highwayman who was hanged at\r\nNewgate. The story is one long ironical comment upon human action. In\r\nit Fielding deliberately turns morality inside out, calling good by the\r\nname of evil, and evil by the name of good. In the hands of a lesser\r\nwriter such a method would at length become teasing and troublesome;\r\nbut Fielding, through the intensity of his ironic insight, gives us new\r\nand piercing glimpses of the ruffian’s mentality. We give an extract to\r\nillustrate Fielding’s ironic power, which in several respects resembles\r\nthat of Swift:\r\n\r\n   In Wild everything was truly great, almost without alloy, as his\r\n   imperfections (for surely some small ones he had) were only such\r\n   as served to denominate him a human creature, of which kind none\r\n   ever arrived at consummate excellence. Indeed, while greatness\r\n   consists in power, pride, insolence, and doing mischief to\r\n   mankind--to speak out--while a great man and a great rogue are\r\n   synonymous terms, so long shall Wild stand unrivalled on the\r\n   pinnacle of GREATNESS. Nor must we omit here, as the\r\n   finishing of his character, what indeed ought to be remembered\r\n   on his tomb or his statue, the conformity above mentioned of his\r\n   death to his life; and that Jonathan Wild the Great, after all\r\n   his mighty exploits was, what so few GREAT men can\r\n   accomplish--hanged by the neck till he was dead.\r\n                                          _Jonathan Wild the Great_\r\n\r\n\r\nHis greatest novel, _Tom Jones_ (1749), completes and perfects his\r\nachievement. In the book we have all his previous virtues (and some of\r\nhis weaknesses), with the addition of greater symmetry of plot, clearer\r\nand steadier vision into human life and human frailty, and a broader\r\nand more thickly peopled stage. His last novel, _Amelia_ (1751), had as\r\nthe original of the heroine Fielding’s first wife, and the character\r\nof the erring husband Booth is based upon that of Fielding himself.\r\nThis novel, though possessing power and interest, lacks the spontaneity\r\nof its great predecessor. The last work he produced was his _Voyage\r\nto Lisbon_, a diary written during his last journey. It possesses a\r\npainful interest, for it reveals a strong and patient mind, heavy with\r\nbodily affliction, yet still lively in its perception of human affairs.\r\n\r\n=3. Features of his Novels.= (_a_) Like Richardson, Fielding had a\r\ngenius for sounding the emotions of the human heart, but his methods\r\nare different. Richardson pores over human weaknesses with puckered\r\nbrow and with many a sigh; Fielding looks, laughs, and passes on. He\r\ndoes not seek to analyze or over-refine; and so his characters possess\r\na breadth, humanity, and attraction denied to Richardson’s. Even a\r\nsneaking rogue like Blifil in _Tom Jones_ has a Shakespearian roundness\r\nof contour that keeps him from being quite revolting.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Fielding is breezy, bustling, and energetic in his _narrative_.\r\nHe shows us life on the highway, in the cottage, and among the streets\r\nof London. Coleridge truly said that to take up Fielding after\r\nRichardson is like emerging from the sick-room on to the open lawn.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Fielding’s _humor_ is boisterous and broad to the point of\r\ncoarseness--a kind of over-fed jollity. But it is frank and open, with\r\nnone of the stealthy suggestiveness of Richardson. In dealing with this\r\naspect of Fielding’s work (an aspect frequently repulsive to the more\r\nsqueamish taste of the moderns) we must make allowance for the fashion\r\nof his time, which united a frankness of incident with a curious\r\ndecorum of speech. He had also in him a freakishness of wit, the excess\r\nof his grosser mood, which led to fantastic interludes and digressions\r\nin his novels. For instance, in describing the numerous scuffles among\r\nhis characters, he frequently adopts an elaborate mock-heroic style\r\nnot quite in accordance with later taste. Fielding’s comic characters,\r\nsuch as Partridge, the humble companion of Tom Jones, are numerous,\r\ndiversified, and exceedingly likeable and lively.\r\n\r\n(_d_) A word must be given to his _style_. He breaks away from the\r\nmannered, artificial style of the earlier novelists, and gives us the\r\ngood “hodden grey” of his own period. His style has a slight touch of\r\narchaism in the use of words like “hath,” but otherwise it is fresh and\r\nclear. His use of dialogue and conversation is of a similar nature.\r\n\r\nWe add an extract to illustrate Fielding’s easy style, his almost\r\nhaphazard cast of sentence, and his use of natural dialogue:\r\n\r\n   As soon as the play, which was _Hamlet, Prince of Denmark_,\r\n   began, Partridge was all attention, nor did he break silence\r\n   till the entrance of the ghost; upon which he asked Jones:\r\n   “What man that was in the strange dress; something,” said he,\r\n   “like what I have seen in a picture. Sure it’s not armour, is\r\n   it?” Jones answered: “That is the ghost.” To which Partridge\r\n   replied, with a smile: “Persuade me to that, sir, if you can.\r\n   Though I can’t say I ever actually saw a ghost in my life, yet\r\n   I am certain I should know one if I saw him better than that\r\n   comes to. No, no, sir; ghosts don’t appear in such dresses as\r\n   that neither.” In this mistake, which caused much laughter in\r\n   the neighbourhood of Partridge, he was suffered to continue till\r\n   the scene between the ghost and Hamlet, when Partridge gave\r\n   that credit to Mr Garrick which he had denied to Jones, and\r\n   fell into so violent a trembling that his knees knocked against\r\n   each other. Jones asked him what was the matter, and whether\r\n   he was afraid of the warrior upon the stage. “O la! sir,” said\r\n   he, “I perceive now it is what you told me. I am not afraid of\r\n   anything, for I know it is but a play; and if it was really a\r\n   ghost, it could do one no harm at such a distance, and in so\r\n   much company; and yet if I was frightened, I am not the only\r\n   person.” “Why, who,” cries Jones; “dost thou take me to be such\r\n   a coward here besides thyself?” “Nay, you may call me coward if\r\n   you will; but if that little man there upon the stage is not\r\n   frightened, I never saw any man frightened in my life. Ay, ay;\r\n   go along with you! Ay, to be sure! Who’s fool, then? Will you?\r\n   Who ever saw such foolhardiness? Whatever happens, it is good\r\n   enough for you. Oh! here he is again! No further! No, you’ve\r\n   gone far enough already; further than I’d have gone for all the\r\n   king’s dominions!” Jones offered to speak, but Partridge cried:\r\n   “Hush, hush, dear sir; don’t you hear him?” And during the\r\n   whole speech of the ghost, he sat with his eyes fixed partly on\r\n   the ghost, and partly on Hamlet, and with his mouth open; the\r\n   same passions, which succeeded each other in Hamlet, succeeding\r\n   likewise in him.\r\n                                                    _Tom Jones_\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER NOVELISTS\r\n\r\n=1. Tobias Smollett (1721–71).= Smollett was a Scotsman, being\r\nborn in Dumbartonshire. Though he came of a good family, from an early\r\nage he had to work for a living. He was apprenticed to a surgeon, and,\r\nbecoming a surgeon’s mate on board a man-of-war, saw some fighting and\r\nmuch of the world. He thus stored up abundant raw material for the\r\nnovels that were to follow. When he published _Roderick Random_\r\n(1748) the book was so successful that he settled in London; and the\r\nremainder of his life is mainly the chronicle of his works.\r\n\r\n_Roderick Random_ is an example of the “picaresque” novel: the hero is\r\na roving dog, of little honesty and considerable roguery; he traverses\r\nmany lands, undergoing many tricks of fortune, both good and bad. The\r\nstory lacks symmetry, but it is nearly always lively, though frequently\r\ncoarse, and the minor characters, such as the seaman Tom Bowling, are\r\nof considerable interest. His other novels are _Peregrine Pickle_\r\n(1751), _Ferdinand_, _Count Fathom_ (1753), _Sir Launcelot Greaves_\r\n(1762), and _The Expedition of Humphrey Clinker_ (1771).\r\n\r\nThe later books follow the plan of the first with some fidelity. Most\r\nof the characters are disreputable; the plots are as a rule formless\r\nnarratives of travel and adventure; and a coarse and brutal humor is\r\npresent all through. Smollett, however, brings variety into his novels\r\nby the endless shifting of the scenes, which cover nearly all the\r\nglobe, by his wide knowledge and acute perception of local manners and\r\ncustoms, and by his use of a plain and vigorous narrative style. His\r\ncharacters, especially his female characters, are crudely managed, but\r\nhis naval men--comprising Commodore Trunnion, Lieutenant Hatchway, and\r\nBoatswain Pipes--form quite a considerable gallery of figures. Smollett\r\nis the first of our novelists to introduce the naval type.\r\n\r\n=2. Laurence Sterne (1713–68).= Sterne was born at Clonmel, was\r\neducated at Cambridge, took orders, and obtained a living in Yorkshire\r\n(1740). His habits were decidedly unclerical, even though we judge them\r\nby the easy standard of the time. He temporarily left his living for\r\nLondon to publish _Tristram Shandy_ (1759). Then he toured abroad,\r\nreturned to England to write his second novel, and died in London while\r\nvisiting the city on business connected with the production of his book.\r\n\r\nHis two novels are _Tristram Shandy_ (1759–67) and _A Sentimental\r\nJourney_ (1768). The first made him famous, and rather turned his\r\nhead, confirming him in some of his worst mannerisms. Both novels are\r\nbundles of episodes and digressions, often irritatingly prolonged. The\r\ncharacters are elaborately handled, caressed, and bewept. Perhaps the\r\nmost famous of them is “my uncle Toby,” with his Corporal Trim. Both\r\nbooks are saturated with a sentiment that modern taste can only call\r\nsloppiness. This sentiment, however, does not prevent a sniggering\r\nindecency from appearing in the narrative. The style is distinguished\r\nby many antics, such as exclamation, inversion, and unfinished\r\nsentences. These mannerisms have long made Sterne distasteful to all\r\nbut highly trained palates, but no one can deny him great ingenuity\r\nand industry, which can gradually unswathe characters and incidents\r\nfrom their trappings of talk and digression, an acute perception of\r\ncharacter, and an immense opinion of his own importance.\r\n\r\nThe following is an exciting incident that occurred just after the\r\nbirth of Tristram Shandy. Susannah, the serving-maid, rouses Mr. Shandy\r\nwith the news that the child is in a fit. Observe the staccato dialogue\r\nand the ingenious variation of the paragraph. The humor is typical of\r\nSterne.\r\n\r\n   “Bless me, sir,” said Susannah, “the child’s in a fit”--“And\r\n   where’s Mr Yorick?”--“Never where he should be,” said Susannah,\r\n   “but his curate’s in the dressing-room, with the child upon his\r\n   arm, waiting for the name--and my mistress bid me run as fast as\r\n   I could to know, as Captain Shandy is the godfather, whether it\r\n   should not be called after him.”\r\n\r\n   “Were one sure,” said my father to himself, scratching his\r\n   eyebrow, “that the child was expiring, one might as well\r\n   compliment my brother Toby as not--and ’t would be a pity in\r\n   such a case, to throw away so great a name as Trismegistus upon\r\n   him--But he may recover.”\r\n\r\n   “No, no”--said my father to Susannah, “I’ll get up”--“There’s\r\n   no time,” cried Susannah, “the child’s as black as my shoe.”\r\n   “Trismegistus,” said my father--“But stay--thou art a leaky\r\n   vessel, Susannah,” added my father; “can’st thou carry\r\n   Trismegistus in thy head the length of the gallery without\r\n   scattering?”--“Can I?” cried Susannah, shutting the door in a\r\n   huff--“If she can, I’ll be shot,” said my father, bouncing out\r\n   of bed in the dark, and groping for his breeches.\r\n\r\n   Susannah ran with all speed along the gallery.\r\n\r\n   My father made all possible speed to find his breeches.\r\n\r\n=3. Horace Walpole (1717–97).= Walpole was the son of Sir Robert\r\nWalpole, the famous Whig minister. He touched upon several kinds of\r\nliterature, his letters being among the best of their kind. His one\r\nnovel, _The Castle of Otranto_ (1764), is of importance, for it was\r\nthe first of the productions of a large school (sometimes called\r\nthe “terror school”) of novelists who dealt with the grisly and\r\nsupernatural as their subject. Walpole’s novel, which he published\r\nalmost furtively, saying, like Chatterton, that the work was of\r\nmedieval origin, described a ghostly castle, in which we have\r\nwalking skeletons, pictures that move out of their frames, and other\r\nblood-curdling incidents. The ghostly machinery is often cumbrous, but\r\nthe work is creditably done, and as a return to the romantic elements\r\nof mystery and fear the book is noteworthy.\r\n\r\n=4. Other Terror Novelists.= (_a_) =William Beckford (1759–1844).=\r\nThe one novel now associated with Beckford’s name is _Vathek_ (1784).\r\nBeckford, who was a man of immense wealth and crazy habits, drew\r\nlargely upon _The Arabian Nights_ for material for the book. The\r\ncentral figure of the novel is a colossal creature, something like\r\na vampire in disposition, who preys upon mankind and finally meets\r\nhis doom with suitable impressiveness. Beckford had a wild, almost\r\nstaggering, magnificence of imagination, and his story, though crude\r\nand violent in places, does not lack a certain reality.\r\n\r\n(_b_) =Mrs. Ann Radcliffe (1764–1823).= This lady was the most popular\r\nof the terror novelists, and published quite a large number of books\r\nthat followed a fairly regular plan. Among such were her _A Sicilian\r\nRomance_ (1790), _The Romance of the Forest_ (1791), and the most\r\npopular of them all, _The Mysteries of Udolpho_ (1794). Her stories\r\ntook on almost a uniform plot, involving mysterious manuscripts,\r\nhaunted castles, clanking chains, and cloaked and saturnine strangers.\r\nAt the end of all the horrors Mrs. Radcliffe rather spoils the effect\r\nby giving away the secrets of them, and revealing the fact that the\r\nterrors were only illusions after all. Nowadays the novels appear tame,\r\nbut they showed the way to a large number of other writers, for they\r\nwere fresh to the public of their time.\r\n\r\n(_c_) =Matthew Gregory Lewis (1775–1818).= Lewis is perhaps the crudest\r\nof the terror school, and only one book of his, _The Monk_ (1795), is\r\nworth recording. Lewis, who is lavish with his horrors, does not try to\r\nexplain them. His imagination is grimmer and fiercer than that of any\r\nof the other writers of the same class, and his book is probably the\r\n“creepiest” of its kind.\r\n\r\n=5. Henry Mackenzie (1745–1831).= This novelist is the most\r\nconsiderable of the sentimental school, who took Sterne for their\r\nmaster. His best-known work is _The Man of Feeling_ (1771), in which\r\nmaudlin sentiment has free play. To his contemporaries Mackenzie was\r\nknown as “the Man of Feeling.”\r\n\r\n=6. Frances Burney (1752–1840)=, whose married name was =Madame\r\nd’Arblay=, is rather an important figure, for she exercised a\r\nconsiderable influence on her age. Her diaries and letters are\r\nclever and informative, and her two best novels, _Evelina_ (1778)\r\nand _Cecilia_ (1782), are lively and acute representations of\r\nfashionable society. Johnson, with his heavy jocularity, called her a\r\n“character-monger,” meaning that her chief effects were obtained in the\r\nportraying of character. In the construction of _Evelina_ she returns\r\nto the clumsy letter-method of Richardson, but she has a wit of an\r\nagreeably acid flavor. She is no mean predecessor of Jane Austen. (See\r\np. 354.)\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD GIBBON (1737–94)\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= Gibbon, who was born at Putney, was a sickly child,\r\nand, according to his own grateful acknowledgment, he owed his\r\nlife to the exertions of his aunt, Catherine Porten. He had little\r\nregular schooling, but from his early years he was an eager reader of\r\nhistory. At the age of fifteen he entered Magdalen College, Oxford,\r\nan institution of which he always spoke afterward with aversion and\r\ncontempt. “To the University of Oxford,” he writes, “I acknowledge\r\nno obligation, and she will as readily renounce me as a son, as I am\r\nwilling to disclaim her as a mother.” His private historical studies\r\nled him to become a Roman Catholic when he was sixteen years old, to\r\nthe great horror of his father, and resulted in his expulsion from the\r\nuniversity. His father packed him off to Lausanne, in Switzerland, in\r\nthe hope that the Protestant atmosphere of the place would wean him\r\nfrom his new faith.\r\n\r\nFrom his stay in Lausanne began Gibbon’s long and affectionate\r\nacquaintance with French language and learning, two sources from\r\nwhich he was to draw the chief inspiration for his masterpiece. He\r\nreturned to England in 1758, and had a brief and mixed experience in\r\nthe Militia; afterward he toured the Continent, visiting the famous\r\n_salons_ of Paris and seeing Rome. Returning to England after some\r\nyears, he entered Parliament (1774), hoping for political preferment.\r\nIn this he was only moderately successful, for he was a lukewarm and\r\nrather cynical politician. He returned to Lausanne, where he completed\r\nhis great work in June 1787. He finally came back to England, and died\r\nin lodgings in London.\r\n\r\n=2. His Works.= His first projected book, _A History of Switzerland_\r\n(1770), was never finished. Then appeared the first volume of _The\r\nDecline and Fall of the Roman Empire_ (1776). At nearly regular\r\nintervals of two years each of the other five volumes was produced, the\r\nlast appearing in 1788. His _Autobiography_, which contains valuable\r\nmaterial concerning his life, is his only other work of any importance,\r\nand it is written with all his usual elegance and suave, ironic humor.\r\n\r\nTo most judges _The Decline and Fall_ ranks as one of the greatest\r\nof historical works, and is a worthy example of what a history ought\r\nto be. In time it covers more than a thousand years, and in scope it\r\nincludes all the nations of Europe. It sketches the events leading\r\nup to the dissolution of the Roman Empire, and traces the rise of\r\nthe states and nations that previously formed the component parts of\r\nthe Roman world, concluding with the fall of Constantinople in the\r\nfifteenth century. For this great task Gibbon’s knowledge is adequate;\r\nrecent specialized research has rarely been able to pick holes in his\r\nnarrative. Moreover, he had also that infallible sense of proportion\r\nwhich is the mark of the born historian: he knows what and when to\r\nomit, to condense, or give in full. In consequence his gigantic\r\nnarrative has the balance and the beauty that result from a single\r\nand indivisible _mind_ directing it, and suggests in plan and\r\nworkmanship a vast cathedral.\r\n\r\nException has been taken to Gibbon’s humor, and with some reason.\r\nHis skeptical bias, the product of his studies in French, pervades\r\nthe entire work. This mental attitude need be no disadvantage to the\r\nhistorian, for it leads him to scrutinize his evidence very severely.\r\nBut in the case of Gibbon it is troublesome at times, especially when\r\nhe deals with the rise of the Christian faith. In the chapters devoted\r\nto the early Christians he sets the facts down solemnly, but all the\r\ntime he is subtly and sneeringly ironical, a characteristic that\r\naroused the great indignation of Johnson. At many other points when\r\nrecording disagreeable incidents Gibbon reveals a sniggering nastiness\r\nof humor unworthy of so great a writer.\r\n\r\nHis prose style, deliberately cultivated as being most suited to\r\nhis subject, is peculiar to himself. It is lordly and commanding,\r\nwith a full, free, and majestic rhythm. Admirably appropriate to its\r\ngigantic subject, the style has nevertheless some weaknesses. Though\r\nit never flags, and rarely stumbles, the very perfection of it tends\r\nto monotony, for it lacks ease and variety. The extract shows the\r\nelaborate construction of the sentences and the rolling character of\r\nthe rhythm:\r\n\r\n   Three days Mahomet and his companion were concealed in the\r\n   cave of Thor, at the distance of a league from Mecca; and in\r\n   the close of each evening, they received from the son and\r\n   daughter of Abubeker a secret supply of intelligence and food.\r\n   The diligence of the Koreish explored every haunt in the\r\n   neighbourhood of the city; they arrived at the entrance of the\r\n   cavern; but the providential deceit of a spider’s web and a\r\n   pigeon’s nest is supposed to convince them that the place was\r\n   solitary and inviolate. “We are only two,” said the trembling\r\n   Abubeker. “There is a third,” replied the prophet; “it is\r\n   God himself.” No sooner was the pursuit abated, than the two\r\n   fugitives issued from the rock, and mounted their camels; on\r\n   the road to Medina they were overtaken by the emissaries of the\r\n   Koreish; they redeemed themselves with prayers and promises from\r\n   their hands. In this eventful moment the lance of an Arab might\r\n   have changed the history of the world. The flight of the prophet\r\n   from Mecca to Medina has fixed the memorable era of the Hegira,\r\n   which, at the end of twelve centuries, still discriminates the\r\n   lunar years of the Mahometan nations.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER HISTORIANS\r\n\r\n=1. David Hume (1711–76).= Born and educated at Edinburgh, Hume first\r\ndistinguished himself as a philosopher, publishing the _Treatise on\r\nHuman Nature_ (1739–40) and _Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary_\r\n(1741). Later he turned to historical work, writing _The History of\r\nEngland_, in six volumes, which appeared between the years 1754 and\r\n1762. At first the work was coldly received, for it traversed the\r\npopular Whig notions, but in time the book raised Hume to the position\r\nof the leading historian of the day. He died in the same year that\r\nwitnessed the issue of the first volume of _The Decline and Fall_.\r\n\r\nAs a historian Hume makes no pretense at profound research, so that his\r\nwork has little permanent value as history. He possesses a clear and\r\nlogical mind and a swift and brilliant narrative style. In the history\r\nof literature his work is of importance as being the first of the\r\npopular and literary histories of the country.\r\n\r\n=2. William Robertson (1721–93).= Robertson also was a Scot, being\r\nborn in the country of Midlothian. After leaving the university he\r\nentered the Scottish Church. He had an active and successful career\r\nas a historian, producing among other works _The History of Scotland_\r\n(1759), _The History of Charles V_ (1769), and _The History of America_\r\n(1777).\r\n\r\nThe range of Robertson’s subject-matter shows that he could have been\r\nno deep student of any particular epoch of history. He aimed at a\r\nplain and businesslike narrative of events, taking the average man’s\r\nview of the facts he chronicled, and, with perhaps the exception of\r\nhis pronounced bias in favor of Mary Queen of Scots, he is never\r\nconspicuously personal in his opinions.\r\n\r\n=3. James Boswell (1740–95)= was born in Edinburgh of a good\r\nScottish family. He studied law, but his chief delight was the pursuit\r\nof great men, whose acquaintance he greedily cultivated.\r\n\r\nHe lives in literature by his supreme effort, _The Life of Samuel\r\nJohnson_ (1791), which ranks as one of the best biographies in\r\nexistence. Boswell sought and obtained Johnson’s friendship; endured\r\nany humiliation for the sake of improving it; and for twenty-one\r\nyears, by means of an astonishing amount of patience, pertinacity, and\r\nsheer thick-skinned imperviousness to slight and insult, obtained an\r\nintimate personal knowledge of Johnson’s life and habits. Boswell has\r\nsuffered at the hands of Macaulay, who has pictured him as being a\r\nknavish buffoon. No doubt he had glaring faults; but on the other hand\r\nhe had great native shrewdness, a vigorous memory, a methodical and\r\ntireless industry which made him note down and preserve many details\r\nof priceless value, and a natural genius for seizing upon points of\r\nsupreme literary importance. All these gifts combine to make his book a\r\nmasterpiece.\r\n\r\nThe following extract illustrates Boswell’s acute perception, his eye\r\nfor detail, and his limpid and vivacious style:\r\n\r\n   That the most minute singularities which belonged to him, and\r\n   made very observable parts of his appearance and manner, may not\r\n   be omitted, it is requisite to mention, that while talking or\r\n   even musing as he sat in his chair, he commonly held his head to\r\n   one side towards his right shoulder, and shook it in a tremulous\r\n   manner, moving his body backwards and forwards, and rubbing his\r\n   left knee in the same direction, with the palm of his hand. In\r\n   the intervals of articulating he made various sounds with his\r\n   mouth, sometimes as if ruminating, or what is called chewing\r\n   the cud, sometimes giving half a whistle, sometimes making his\r\n   tongue play backwards from the roof of his mouth, as if clucking\r\n   like a hen, and sometimes protruding it against his upper gums\r\n   in front, as if pronouncing quickly under his breath, _too,\r\n   too, too_: all this accompanied sometimes with a thoughtful\r\n   look, but more frequently with a smile. Generally when he had\r\n   concluded a period, in the course of a dispute, by which time he\r\n   was a good deal exhausted by violence and vociferation, he used\r\n   to blow out his breath like a whale. This I suppose was a relief\r\n   to his lungs; and seemed in him to be a contemptuous mode of\r\n   expression, as if he had made the arguments of his opponent fly\r\n   like chaff before the wind.\r\n                                           _The Life of Samuel Johnson._\r\n\r\n\r\nEDMUND BURKE (1729–97)\r\n\r\nBurke shares with Gibbon the place of the greatest prose stylist of\r\nthe period now under review. He is, moreover, recognized as one of the\r\nmasters of English prose.\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= Born in Dublin, Burke was educated at Trinity College,\r\nDublin, and then removed to London to study law in the Middle Temple.\r\nHe soon showed that his real bent lay toward politics and literature,\r\nand it was not long before he published some books that attracted a\r\ngood deal of attention and admitted him into the famous Johnson Club.\r\nIn politics he attached himself to the Whig party, obtained some\r\nsmall appointments, and became member for Wendover (1765). Both as an\r\norator and as a pamphleteer he was a powerful advocate for his party,\r\nand very soon his splendid gifts won for him a leading place in the\r\nHouse of Commons. His style of oratory, often labored, rhetorical, and\r\ntheatrical, exposed him to much censure and ridicule, and his speeches\r\nwere frequently prolonged to the point of dullness. But at its best his\r\neloquence was powerful in attack and magnificent in appeal, rising to\r\nthe very summit of the orator’s art. When the Whigs attained to office\r\nin 1783 Burke was appointed Paymaster of the Forces. He was leader in\r\nthe prosecution of Warren Hastings, making a speech of immense length\r\nand power (1788). On the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789 he\r\nleft his party and attacked the revolutionaries with all his great\r\nenergy. In 1794, broken in health, he retired from Parliament, but\r\ncontinued to publish pamphlets till his death in 1797.\r\n\r\n=2. His Works.= The considerable sum of Burke’s achievement can\r\nfor the sake of convenience be divided into two groups: his purely\r\nphilosophical writings, and his political pamphlets and speeches.\r\n\r\n(_a_) His philosophical writings, which comprise the smaller division\r\nof his product, were composed in the earlier portion of his career. _A\r\nVindication of Natural Society_ (1756) is a parody of the style and\r\nideas of Bolingbroke, and, though it possesses much ingenuity, it has\r\nnot much importance as an original work. _A Philosophical Inquiry into\r\nthe Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful_ (1756) is his\r\nmost considerable attempt at philosophy. As philosophy the book is only\r\nmiddling, for its theory and many of its examples are questionable, but\r\nit has the sumptuous dressing of Burke’s language and style.\r\n\r\n(_b_) His political works are by far his most substantial claim to\r\nfame. In variety, breadth of view, and illuminating power of vision\r\nthey are unsurpassed in the language. The chief of the many works are\r\n_Thoughts on the Present Discontents_ (1770), a resounding attack\r\non the Tory Government then in power; _Reflections on the French\r\nRevolution_ (1790), which marked his departure from his old party and\r\nhis fierce challenge to the extreme revolutionary policy; _Letter to\r\na Noble Lord_ (1796); and _Letters on a Regicide Peace_ (1797). In\r\naddition we have much purely oratorical work, such as the notable\r\nspeeches on the American question and his great philippic against\r\nWarren Hastings.\r\n\r\n=3. Features of his Work.= Though the occasion of Burke’s political\r\nwritings has vanished, the books can still be read with profit and\r\npleasure. Burke was the practical politician, applying to the problems\r\nof his day the light of a clear and forcible intelligence; yet, above\r\nthis, he had an almost supreme faculty for discerning the eternal\r\nprinciples lying behind the shifting and troubled scenes of his time.\r\nHe could distill from the muddy liquid of contemporary party strife the\r\nclear wine of wisdom, and so deduce ideas of unshakable permanence.\r\nThus pages of his disquisition, scores of his dicta, can still be\r\napplied almost without qualification to the problems of any civilized\r\nstate and time. A good deal of the writing is of an inferior quality;\r\nit can be flashy, labored, and dull; but as a whole it possesses the\r\nfoundations of sanity and wisdom.\r\n\r\nWe have in addition the permanent attraction of Burke’s style. His\r\nprose is marked by all the devices of the orator: much repetition,\r\ncareful arrangement and balance of parts, copious use of the rhetorical\r\nfigures (such as metaphor, simile, epigram, and exclamation),\r\nvariation of the sentence, homely illustrations, and a swift but steady\r\nrhythm. When he overdoes these devices he is garish and vulgar, but\r\nfor the most part his style impresses the reader with an effect of\r\nelevation, strength, and noble perspicuity.\r\n\r\nIn the extract now given, note that the actual vocabulary does not\r\nabound in long Latinized words as in the case of Johnsonese. The ornate\r\neffect is produced rather by the elevation of the sentiment and the\r\nsweeping cadence of the style.\r\n\r\n   On the scheme of this barbarous philosophy, which is the\r\n   offspring of cold hearts and muddy understandings, and which\r\n   is as void of solid wisdom as it is destitute of all taste and\r\n   elegance, laws are to be supported only by their own terrors,\r\n   and by the concern which each individual may find in them from\r\n   his own private speculations, or can spare to them from his\r\n   own private interests. In the groves of _their_ Academy,\r\n   at the end of every vista, you see nothing but the gallows!\r\n   Nothing is left which engages the affections on the part of the\r\n   commonwealth. On the principles of this mechanic philosophy, our\r\n   institutions can never be embodied, if I may use the expression,\r\n   in persons, so as to create in us love, veneration, admiration,\r\n   or attachment. But that sort of reason which banishes the\r\n   affections is incapable of filling their place. These public\r\n   affections, combined with manners, are required sometimes as\r\n   supplements, sometimes as correctives, always as aids, to law.\r\n   The precept given by a wise man, as well as a great critic, for\r\n   the construction of poems is equally true as to states: “Non\r\n   satis est pulchra esse poemata, dulcia sunto.” There ought to\r\n   be a system of manners in every nation which a well-formed mind\r\n   would be disposed to relish. To make us love our country, our\r\n   country ought to be lovely.\r\n                           _Reflections on the French Revolution_\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER PROSE-WRITERS\r\n\r\n=1. Adam Smith (1723–90).= This author was born at Kirkcaldy, in\r\nFifeshire, and completed his education at Glasgow and Oxford. He was\r\nappointed professor at Glasgow University, whence he issued his famous\r\nbook _The Wealth of Nations_ (1776).\r\n\r\nIn the history of economics the work is epoch-making, for it lays the\r\nfoundations of modern economic theory. In the history of literature it\r\nis noteworthy because it is another example of that spirit of research\r\nand inquiry that was abroad at this time, playing havoc with literary\r\nconvention as well as with many other ideas. The book is also a worthy\r\nexample of the use of a plain businesslike style in the development of\r\ntheories of far-reaching importance.\r\n\r\n=2. William Paley (1743–1805)= may be taken as the typical theological\r\nwriter of the age. He was a brilliant Cambridge scholar, and obtained\r\nhigh offices in the Church, finally becoming an archdeacon. His chief\r\nbooks are _Moral and Political Philosophy_ (1785), _Horæ Paulinæ_\r\n(1790), and _A View of the Evidences of Christianity_ (1794). His style\r\nis lively and attractive, and he possessed much vigor of character and\r\nintellect.\r\n\r\n=3. The Earl of Chesterfield (1694–1773)= was of the famous Stanhope\r\nfamily. In his day he was an illustrious wit and man of fashion, and\r\nheld high political offices. He is an example of the aristocratic\r\namateur in literature, and he wrote elegant articles for the\r\nfashionable journals, such as _The World_.\r\n\r\nHis _Letters to his Son_, which were published shortly after his death\r\nin 1773, caused a great flutter. They appeared diabolically cynical\r\nand immoral, and as such they were denounced by Johnson. No doubt they\r\naffect the tired cynicism of the man of the world, but that does not\r\nprevent them from being keen and clever, and underneath their bored\r\nindifference to morality they reveal a shrewd judgment of men and\r\nmanners. (See p. 342.)\r\n\r\n=4. William Godwin (1756–1836)= is a prominent example of the\r\nrevolutionary man of letters of the time. He was the son of a\r\ndissenting minister, and intended to follow the same profession, but\r\nvery soon drifted away from it. He then devoted himself to the pursuit\r\nof letters, in which he developed his extreme views on religion,\r\npolitics, sociology, and other important themes. His _Political\r\nJustice_ (1793) was deeply tinged with revolutionary ideas, and had a\r\ngreat effect on many young and ardent spirits of the age, including\r\nShelley. His novel _Caleb Williams_ (1794) was a dressing of the same\r\ntheories in the garb of fiction. Godwin is worth notice because he\r\nreveals the spread of the revolutionary doctrines that were so strongly\r\nopposed by Burke.\r\n\r\n=5. Gilbert White (1720–93)= deserves mention as the first naturalist\r\nwho cast his observations into genuine literary form. He was born\r\nat Selborne, Hampshire, studied at Oxford, and took holy orders. He\r\nsettled at his native place, and published _The Natural History of\r\nSelborne_ (1789). The book is a series of genuine letters written to\r\ncorrespondents who are interested in the natural history of the place.\r\nWhite reveals much closeness and sympathy of observation, and he can\r\ncommand a sweet and readable style. He shows the “return to nature” in\r\na practical and praiseworthy form. (See p. 355.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF LITERARY FORMS\r\n\r\nThis, being an age of transition, is an age of unrest, of advance and\r\nretreat, of half-lights and dubious victories. But if we bring together\r\nthe different types of literature, and mark how they have developed\r\nduring the period, we can see that the trend of the age is quite clear.\r\n\r\n=1. Poetry.= In 1740 we have Pope still alive and powerful, and Johnson\r\nan aspiring junior; in 1800, with Burns and Blake, Romanticism has\r\nunquestionably arrived. This great change came gradually, but its\r\nstages can be observed with some precision.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The first symptom of the coming change was the _decline of the\r\nheroic couplet_, the dominance of which passed away with its greatest\r\nexponent, Pope. Toward the middle of the century a large number of\r\nother poetical forms can be observed creeping back into favor.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The change was first seen in the free use of the _Pindaric ode_\r\nin the works of Gray and Collins, which appeared in the middle years of\r\nthe century. The Pindaric ode is a useful medium for the transitional\r\nstage, for it has the double advantage of being “classical” and of\r\nbeing free from the more formal rules of couplet and stanza. Gray’s\r\n_The Bard_ (1757) and Collins’s ode _The Passions_ (1747) are among the\r\nbest of the type.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Another omen was the revival of the _ballad_, which was due to\r\nrenewed interest in the older kinds of literature. The revived species,\r\nas seen in Goldsmith’s _The Hermit_ and Cowper’s _John Gilpin_, has not\r\nthe grimness and crude narrative force of the genuine ballad, but it\r\nis lively and often humorous. Another ballad-writer was =Thomas Percy\r\n(1729–1811)=, who, in addition to collecting the _Reliques_ (1765),\r\ncomposed ballads of his own, such as _The Friar of Orders Grey_.\r\nChatterton’s _Bristowe Tragedy_ has much of the fire and somberness of\r\nthe old ballads.\r\n\r\n(_d_) The _descriptive and narrative poems_ begin with the\r\nold-fashioned _London_ (1738) of Johnson; the development is seen in\r\nGoldsmith’s _Traveller_ (1764) and _Deserted Village_ (1770), in which\r\nthe heroic couplet is quickened and transformed by a real sympathy\r\nfor nature and the poor; the advance is carried still further by the\r\nblank-verse poems of Cowper (_The Task_) and Crabbe (_The Village_)\r\nand the Spenserian stanzas of minor poets like Shenstone (_The\r\nSchoolmistress_).\r\n\r\n(_e_) Finally there is the rise of the _lyric_. The Pindarics of\r\nCollins and Gray are lyrics in starch and buckram; the works of\r\nChatterton, Smart, Macpherson, Cowper, and, lastly, of Burns and Blake\r\nshow in order the lyrical spirit struggling with its bonds, shaking\r\nitself free, and finally soaring in triumph. Romanticism has arrived.\r\n\r\n=2. Drama.= In this period nothing is more remarkable than the poverty\r\nof its dramatic literature. Of this no real explanation can be given.\r\nThe age was simply not a dramatic one; for the plays that the age\r\nproduced, with the exceptions of a few notable examples of comedy, are\r\nhardly worth noticing.\r\n\r\nTragedy comes off worst of all. The sole tragedy hitherto mentioned in\r\nthis chapter is Johnson’s _Irene_ (1749), which only the reputation of\r\nits author has preserved from complete oblivion. A tragedy which had a\r\ngreat vogue was _Douglas_ (1754), by =John Home (1722–1808)=. It is now\r\nalmost forgotten. =Joanna Baillie (1762–1851)= produced some historical\r\nblank-verse tragedies, such as _Count Basil_ (1798) and _De Montfort_\r\n(1798). Her plays make fairly interesting reading, and some of their\r\nadmirers, including Scott, said that she was Shakespeare revived.\r\n\r\nAmong the comedies we have the sprightly plays of Goldsmith, already\r\nnoticed, Fielding’s _Tom Thumb_, and the work of =Richard Brinsley\r\nSheridan (1751–1816)=.\r\n\r\nSheridan was an Irishman, and became a prominent wit and politician.\r\nHis wit is admirably revealed in his three brilliant prose comedies.\r\n_The Rivals_ (1775), _The School for Scandal_ (1777), and _The\r\nCritic_ (1779). The three all resemble the best of the Restoration\r\ncomedies, without the immorality that taints their models. The plots\r\nare ingenious and effective, though they depend largely on a stagy\r\ncomplexity of intrigue; the characters, among whom are the immortal\r\nfigures of Mrs. Malaprop, Bob Acres, and Sir Fretful Plagiary, are\r\nstage types, but they are struck off with daring skill; and the\r\ndialogue is often a succession of brilliant repartees. The worst that\r\ncan be said against the plays is that they are artificial, and that the\r\nvery cleverness of them becomes fatiguing. With the work of Sheridan\r\nthe artificial comedy reaches its climax.\r\n\r\n=3. Prose.= The prose product of the period is bulky, varied, and\r\nof great importance. The importance of it is clear enough when we\r\nrecollect that it includes, among many other things, possibly the best\r\nnovel in the language (_Tom Jones_), the best history (_The Decline and\r\nFall_), and the best biography (_The Life of Doctor Johnson_).\r\n\r\n(_a_) _The Rise of the Novel._ There are two main classes of fictional\r\nprose narratives, namely, the tale or romance and the novel. The\r\ndistinction between the two need not be drawn too fine, for there is a\r\nlarge amount of prose narrative that can fall into either group; but,\r\nbroadly speaking, we may say that the tale or romance depends for its\r\nchief interest on incident and adventure, whereas the novel depends\r\nmore on the display of character and motive. In addition, the story\r\n(or _plot_, or _fable_) of the novel tends to be more complicated than\r\nthat of the tale, and it often leads to what were called by the older\r\nwriters “revolutions and discoveries”--that is, unexpected developments\r\nin the narrative, finishing with an explanation that is called the\r\n_dénouement_. The tale, moreover, can be separated from the romance:\r\nthe plot of the tale is commonly matter-of-fact, while that of the\r\nromance is often wonderful and fantastic.\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that the modern novel has its roots in the\r\nmedieval romances, such as _Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_ and\r\nthose dealing with the legends of King Arthur. Another source of the\r\nnovel were the collections of ballads telling of the adventures of\r\npopular heroes of the type of Robin Hood. These romances were written\r\nin verse; they were supplied with stock characters, like the wandering\r\nknight, the distressed damsel, and the wicked wizard; they had stock\r\nincidents, connected with enchanted castles, fiery dragons, and\r\nperilous ambushes; and their story rambled on almost interminably. They\r\nwere necessary to satisfy the human craving for fiction, and they were\r\noften fiction of a picturesque and lively kind.\r\n\r\nThe age of Elizabeth saw the rise of the prose romance. We have\r\nexamples in the _Euphues_ (1579) of Lyly and the _Arcadia_ of Sidney.\r\nAs fiction these tales are weighed down with their fantastic prose\r\nstyles, and with their common desire to expound a moral lesson. Their\r\ncharacters are rudimentary, and there is little attempt at a plot and\r\nlove-theme. Yet they represent an advance, for they are fiction.\r\n\r\nThey are interesting from another viewpoint. They show us that curious\r\ndiffidence that was to be a drag on the production of the novel even as\r\nlate as the time of Scott. Authors were shy of being novelists for two\r\nmain reasons: first, there was thought to be something almost immoral\r\nin the writing of fiction, as it was but the glorification of a pack\r\nof lies; and, secondly, the liking for fiction was considered to be the\r\ncraving of diseased or immature intellects, and so the production of it\r\nwas unworthy of reasonable men. Thus if a man felt impelled to write\r\nfiction he had to conceal the narrative with some moral or allegorical\r\ndressing.\r\n\r\nA new type of embryo novel began to appear at the end of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, and, becoming very popular during the seventeenth, retained\r\nits popularity till the days of Fielding and Smollett.\r\n\r\nThis class is known as the _picaresque_ novel, a name derived from the\r\nSpanish word _picaron_, which means a wandering rogue. As the name\r\nimplies, it is of Spanish origin. For hero it takes a rascal who leads\r\na wandering life, and has many adventures, most of them of a scandalous\r\nkind. The hero is the sole link between the different incidents, and\r\nthere is much digression and the interposing of other short narratives.\r\nIn Spain the picaresque type originated in parodies of the old\r\nromances, and of such parodies the greatest is the _Don Quixote_ (1604)\r\nof Cervantes. In France the type became common, the most famous example\r\nof it being the _Gil Blas_ (1735) of Le Sage.\r\n\r\nIn England the picaresque novel had an early start in _Jack Wilton,\r\nor The Unfortunate Traveller_, by Nash, (1567–1601), whose work often\r\nsuggests that of Defoe. Nash’s work is crude, but it has vigor and some\r\nwit. A later effort in the same kind is _The English Rogue_ (1665), by\r\nRichard Head. The book is gross and scandalous to an extreme degree,\r\nbut it has energy, and, as it takes the hero to many places on the\r\nglobe, the reader obtains interesting glimpses of life in foreign parts.\r\n\r\nAnother type that came into favor was the heroic romance. This\r\nwas based on the similar French romances of Mademoiselle Scudéri\r\n(1607–1701) and others. This class of fiction was the elegant variety\r\nof the grosser picaresque novel, and it was much duller. The hero of\r\na heroic romance was usually of high degree, and he underwent a long\r\nseries of romantic adventures, many of them supernatural. There was\r\nmuch love-making, involving long speeches containing “noble sentiments,\r\nelegantly expressed.” The length of these romances was enormous; the\r\n_Grand Cyrus_ of Mademoiselle Scudéri ran to ten large volumes. Popular\r\nEnglish specimens were Ford’s _Parismus, Prince of Bohemia_ (1598)\r\nand _Parthenissa_ (1654), by Roger Boyle. It is worth noting that the\r\nartificial heroic romance collapsed about the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, whereas the picaresque class, which in spite of its grave\r\nfaults was a human and interesting type of fiction, survived and\r\ninfluenced the novel in later centuries.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the seventeenth century the novel is dimly taking shape.\r\n=Aphra Behn (1640–89)= wrote stories that had some claims to plot,\r\ncharacter-drawing, and dialogue. Her _Orinooko, or The Royal Slave_\r\nshows some power in describing the persecution of a noble negro, a\r\nkind of Othello, at the hands of brutal white men. The work of Bunyan\r\n(1628–88) was forced to be allegorical, for the Puritans, of whom he\r\nwas one, abhorred the idea of writing fiction, which they regarded as\r\ngilded lies. Yet _The Pilgrim’s Progress_ abounds in qualities that go\r\nto make a first-rate novel: a strong and smoothly working plot, troops\r\nof human and diverse characters, impressive descriptive passages, and\r\nsimple dialogue dramatically sound. His other works, notably _The Life\r\nand Death of Mr. Badman_, are also very close to the novel proper.\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century we see another development in the Coverley\r\npapers (1711) of Steele and Addison. There is little plot in this\r\nessay-series, and only a rudimentary love-theme; but the allegorical\r\nfabric is gone, there is much entertaining character-sketching, and\r\nthe spice of delicate humor. We should note also that we have here the\r\nbeginnings of the society and domestic novel, for the papers deal with\r\nordinary people and incidents.\r\n\r\nThe genuine novel is very near indeed in the works of Defoe\r\n(1659–1731). His novels are of the picaresque type in the case of\r\n_Captain Singleton_ (1720), _Moll Flanders_ (1722), and _Colonel Jack_\r\n(1722). They have many of the faults of their kind: the characters\r\nare weakly drawn, the plots are shaky and sprawling, and much of the\r\nincident is indecorous; yet they have a virile and sustaining interest\r\nthat is most apparent in the best parts of _Robinson Crusoe_ (1719).\r\n\r\nThen, toward the middle of the century, came the swift and abundant\r\nblossoming of the novel, raising the type to the rank of one of the\r\nmajor species of literature. The time was ripe for it. The drama,\r\nwhich had helped to satisfy the natural human desire for a story,\r\nwas moribund, and something had to take its place. Here we can only\r\nsummarize very shortly the work of the novelists already discussed in\r\nthis chapter. Richardson’s _Pamela_ (1740) had the requisites of plot,\r\ncharacters, and dialogue, and these of high merit; but the diffidence\r\nof the early fiction-writer possessed him, and he had to conceal\r\nthe novel-method under the clumsy disguise of a series of letters.\r\nFielding’s robust common sense had no such scruples, and his _Tom\r\nJones_ (1749) shows us the novel in its maturity. Later novelists could\r\nonly modify and improve in detail; with Fielding the principles of the\r\nnovel were established.\r\n\r\nThe modifications of Fielding’s immediate successors can be briefly\r\nnoticed. Smollett reverted to the picaresque manner, but he added the\r\nprofessional sailor to fiction, and gave it types of Scottish character\r\nthat Scott was to improve upon; Sterne made the novel sentimental and\r\nfantastic, and founded a sentimental school; the Radcliffe novels,\r\npopular toward the end of the century, made fiction terrific; while\r\nin _The Vicar of Wakefield_ (1766) Goldsmith showed us what the novel\r\ncan do in respect of a simple yet effective plot, human and lovable\r\npersonages, dialogue of a dramatic kind, and a tender and graceful\r\nhumor. Johnson’s _Rasselas_ (1759), which reverted to the methods\r\nof _Euphues_, was pure reaction, but it possesses an interest as a\r\nreversion to a long-dead type.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The Rise of the Historical Work._ The development of history\r\ncame late, but almost necessarily so. The two main requirements of\r\nthe serious historian are knowledge of his subject and maturity of\r\njudgment. Before the year 1750 no great historical work had appeared\r\nin any modern language. Raleigh’s _History of the World_ (1614) is not\r\na real history; it is only the fruit of the mental exertions of an\r\nimprisoned man who seeks relaxation. Clarendon’s _History of the Great\r\nRebellion_, which was not published till 1704, is largely the record of\r\nhis own personal experiences and opinions. He makes little attempt at\r\nan impartial and considered judgment or at placing the rebellion in its\r\nproper perspective.\r\n\r\nThe general advance in knowledge and the research into national affairs\r\nwhich were the features of eighteenth-century culture quickly brought\r\nthe study of history into prominence. France led the way, and the\r\nScots, traditionally allied to the French, were the first in Britain\r\nto feel the influence. Hence we have Hume’s _History of England_\r\n(1754) and the works of Robertson. These books excelled in ease and\r\nsense, but the knowledge displayed in them was not yet sufficient to\r\nmake them epoch-making. Gibbon’s _Decline and Fall_ (1776) in\r\nknowledge, in method, and in literary style is as near perfection as\r\nhuman frailty can attain. Thus within twenty or thirty years the art\r\nof writing history in English advanced from a state of tutelage to\r\ncomplete development.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Letter-writing._ The habit of writing letters became very\r\npopular during the eighteenth century, and flourished till well\r\ninto the nineteenth, when the institution of the penny post made\r\nletter-writing a convenience and not an art. It was this popularity of\r\nthe letter that helped Richardson’s _Pamela_ into public favor.\r\n\r\nA favorite form of the letter was a long communication, sometimes\r\nwritten from abroad, discussing some topic of general interest. Such\r\na letter was semi-public in nature, and was meant to be handed round\r\na circle of acquaintances. Frequently a series of letters was bound\r\ninto book-form. Collections of this kind were the letters of Lady\r\nMary Wortley Montagu (1689–1762), written to Pope and others from\r\nConstantinople, and of Thomas Gray, from the Lake District and the\r\nContinent. Sometimes the letters contain comments on political and\r\nsocial matters, as in the famous compositions of Lord Chesterfield to\r\nhis son, which we have already noticed. We give an extract from one of\r\nChesterfield’s letters, for it is valuable as an example of witty and\r\npolished prose. A letter of the type of Chesterfield’s is really an\r\nessay which is given a slightly epistolary form.\r\n\r\n                                    LONDON, _May 27, 1753_\r\n   ... You are now but nineteen, an age at which most of your\r\n   countrymen are illiberally getting drunk in Port at the\r\n   University. You have greatly got the start of them in learning;\r\n   and, if you can equally get the start of them in the knowledge\r\n   and manners of the world, you may be very sure of outrunning\r\n   them in Court and Parliament, as you set out so much earlier\r\n   than they. They generally begin but to see the world at\r\n   one-and-twenty; you will by that age have seen all Europe.\r\n   They set out upon their travels unlicked cubs; and in their\r\n   travels they only lick one another, for they seldom go into\r\n   any other company. They know nothing but the English world,\r\n   and the worst part of that too, and generally very little of\r\n   any but the English language; and they come home, at three or\r\n   four-and-twenty, refined and polished (as is said in one of\r\n   Congreve’s plays) like Dutch skippers from a whale-fishing.\r\n   The care which has been taken of you, and (to do you justice)\r\n   the care you have taken of yourself, has left you, at the age\r\n   of nineteen only, nothing to acquire but the knowledge of the\r\n   world, manners, address, and those exterior accomplishments.\r\n   But they are great and necessary acquisitions, to those who\r\n   have sense enough to know their true value; and your getting\r\n   them before you are one-and-twenty, and before you enter upon\r\n   the active and shining scene of life, will give you such an\r\n   advantage over all your contemporaries, that they cannot\r\n   overtake you: they must be distanced. You may probably be placed\r\n   about a young prince, who will probably be a young king. There\r\n   all the various arts of pleasing, the engaging address, the\r\n   versatility of manners, the brilliant, the Graces, will outweigh\r\n   and yet outrun all solid knowledge and unpolished merit. Oil\r\n   yourself therefore, and be both supple and shining, for that\r\n   race, if you would be first, or early, at the goal.\r\n\r\nA type of letter which is frankly a work written for publication is\r\nwell represented by the famous _Letters of Junius_, which caused a\r\ngreat stir in their day. They are what are called “open letters”--that\r\nis, they are for general perusal, while they gain additional point by\r\nbeing addressed to some well-known personage. The public, as it were,\r\nhas the satisfaction of looking over the shoulder of the man to whom\r\nthey are addressed. “Junius” is now supposed to have been =Sir Philip\r\nFrancis (1740–1818)=, though the identity of the writer was long\r\nconcealed. They began to appear in _The Public Advertiser_ in 1769, and\r\nby their immensely destructive power they shook the Government to its\r\nbase. In force and fury they resemble Swift’s _Drapier’s Letters_, but\r\nthey tend to become petty and spiteful.\r\n\r\nThe more intimate and private letters of this period, of which there\r\nis a large and interesting collection, are of a deeper significance to\r\nus now, for they contain a human interest by revealing the nature of\r\nthe people who wrote them. In _The Life of Doctor Johnson_ Boswell\r\npublished many of Johnson’s letters, the most famous of which is that\r\ncontaining the snub to Chesterfield. It is quoted in the exercises\r\nattached to this chapter. Horace Walpole, as we have already noted\r\n(p. 323), left a voluminous correspondence which for wit, vivacity,\r\nand urbane and shallow common sense is quite remarkable. The private\r\nletters of Cowper are attractive for their easy and unaffected grace\r\nand their gentle and pervasive humor. We add an extract from a letter\r\nby Cowper. The style of it should be compared with that of Chesterfield.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        (_To William Hayley._)\r\n\r\n                                 WESTON, _February 24, 1793_\r\n   ... Oh! you rogue! what would you give to have such a dream\r\n   about Milton, as I had about a week since? I dreamed that\r\n   being in a house in the city, and with much company, looking\r\n   toward the lower end of the room from the upper end of it, I\r\n   descried a figure which I immediately knew to be Milton’s.\r\n   He was very gravely, but very neatly attired in the fashion\r\n   of his day, and had a countenance which filled me with those\r\n   feelings which an affectionate child has for a beloved father,\r\n   such, for instance, as Tom has for you. My first thought was\r\n   wonder, where he could have been concealed so many years; my\r\n   second, a transport of joy to find him still alive; my third,\r\n   another transport to find myself in his company; and my fourth,\r\n   a resolution to accost him. I did so, and he received me with a\r\n   complacence, in which I saw equal sweetness and dignity. I spoke\r\n   of his _Paradise Lost_, as every man must, who is worthy\r\n   to speak of it at all, and told him a long story of the manner\r\n   in which it affected me, when I first discovered it, being at\r\n   that time a schoolboy. He answered me by a smile and a gentle\r\n   inclination of his head. He then grasped my hand affectionately,\r\n   and with a smile that charmed me, said, “Well, you for your part\r\n   will do well also”; at last recollecting his great age (for I\r\n   understood him to be two hundred years old), I feared that I\r\n   might fatigue him by much talking; I took my leave, and he took\r\n   his, with an air of the most perfect good breeding. His person,\r\n   his features, his manner, were all so perfectly characteristic,\r\n   that I am persuaded an apparition of him could not present him\r\n   more completely. This may be said to have been one of the dreams\r\n   of Pindus,[169] may it not?... With Mary’s kind love, I must now\r\n   conclude myself, my dear brother, ever yours,\r\n                                                      LIPPUS[170]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) _The Periodical Essay._ Compared with the abundance of the\r\nearlier portion of the century, the amount produced later seems of\r\nlittle importance. The number of periodicals, however, was as great as\r\never. Johnson wrote _The Rambler_ and _The Idler_, and contributed also\r\nto _The Adventurer_ and others; Goldsmith assisted _The Bee_ during\r\nits brief career. _The Connoisseur_, to which Cowper contributed for\r\na space, _The Mirror_ and _The Lounger_, published in Edinburgh by\r\nMackenzie, “the Man of Feeling,” _The Observer_ and _The Looker On_ all\r\nimitated _The Spectator_ with moderate success, but show no important\r\ndevelopment in manner or matter.\r\n\r\n(_e_) _Miscellaneous Prose._ The amount of miscellaneous prose is\r\nvery great indeed, and a fair proportion of it is of high merit. We\r\nhave already given space to the political and philosophical writings\r\nof Burke, whose work is of the highest class, as represented in _The\r\nSublime and Beautiful_ and _Reflections on the French Revolution_.\r\nPolitical writing of a different aim is seen in Godwin’s _Political\r\nJustice_; and the religious writings of Paley, the critical writings of\r\nPercy, and the natural history of Gilbert White are all to be included\r\nin this class.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF LITERARY STYLE\r\n\r\n=1. Poetry.= In poetical style the transitional features are well\r\nmarked. The earlier authors reveal many artificial mannerisms--for\r\nexample, extreme regularity of meter and the frequent employment of the\r\nmore formal figures of speech, such as personification and apostrophe.\r\nThe Pindaric odes of Gray and Collins are examples of the transitional\r\nstyle:\r\n\r\n    Ye distant spires! ye antique towers!\r\n      That crown the watery glade,\r\n    Where grateful Science still adores\r\n      Her Henry’s holy shade;\r\n    And ye that from the stately brow\r\n    Of Windsor’s heights the expanse below\r\n      Of grove, of lawn, of mead survey,\r\n    Whose turf, whose shade, whose flowers among\r\n    Wanders the hoary Thames along\r\n      His silver-winding way.\r\n               GRAY, _Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College_\r\n\r\nIn this verse there are the conventional personifications of Science\r\nand the Thames, and such stock phrases as “the watery glade.” The whole\r\npoem, however, is infused with a new spirit of mingled energy and\r\nmeditation.\r\n\r\nAs the century draws to a close we have many of the newer styles\r\nappearing: the more regular blank verse of Cowper; the lighter heroic\r\ncouplet of Goldsmith; the archaic medley of Chatterton; and the intense\r\nsimplicity of Burns and Blake. As a further example of the new manner\r\nwe quote a few stanzas from a poem by Fergusson, who, dying in the year\r\n1774 (ten years before the death of Johnson), wrote as naturally as\r\nBurns himself:\r\n\r\n    As simmer rains bring simmer flowers,\r\n    And leaves to cleed the birken bowers;\r\n    Sae beauty gets by caller showers\r\n                      Sae rich a bloom,\r\n    As for estate, or heavy dowers\r\n                      Aft stands in room.\r\n\r\n    What makes auld Reekie’s dames so fair\r\n    It canna be the halesome air;\r\n    But caller burn, beyond compare,\r\n                      The best o’ ony,\r\n    That gars them a’ sic graces skair[171]\r\n                      An’ blink sae bonny.\r\n\r\n    On Mayday, in a fairy ring,\r\n    We’ve seen them roun’ Saint Anthon’s spring,\r\n    Frae grass the caller dew-draps wring,\r\n                      To weet their e’en,\r\n    An’ water, clear as crystal spring,\r\n                      To synd[172] them clean.\r\n                                        _Caller Water_\r\n\r\n=2. Prose.= As in poetry, we have in prose many men and many\r\nmanners. The simplest prose of the period is found chiefly in the works\r\nof the novelists, of whom Fielding and Smollett are good examples.\r\nSmollett’s prose, as in the following example, is almost colloquial in\r\nits native directness.\r\n\r\n   After we had been all entered upon the ship’s books, I inquired\r\n   of one of my shipmates where the surgeon was, that I might\r\n   have my wounds dressed, and had actually got as far as the\r\n   middle deck (for our ship carried eighty guns) in my way to the\r\n   cockpit, when I was met by the same midshipman, who had used\r\n   me so barbarously in the tender: he, seeing me free from my\r\n   chains, asked, with an insolent air, who had released me? To\r\n   this question, I foolishly answered with a countenance that too\r\n   plainly declared the state of my thoughts; “Whoever did it, I am\r\n   persuaded did not consult you in the affair.” I had no sooner\r\n   uttered these words, than he cried, “Damn you, I’ll teach you to\r\n   talk so to your officer.” So saying, he bestowed on me several\r\n   severe stripes, with a supple jack he had in his hand: and going\r\n   to the commanding officer, made such a report of me, that I was\r\n   immediately put in irons by the master-at-arms, and a sentinel\r\n   placed over me.\r\n                                               _Roderick Random_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe excellent middle style of Addison, the prose-of-all-work, survives,\r\nand will continue to survive, for it is indispensable to all manner of\r\nmiscellaneous work. Goldsmith’s prose is one of the best examples of\r\nthe middle style, and so is the later work of Johnson, as well as the\r\nwritings of the authors of miscellaneous prose already mentioned in\r\nthis chapter. The following passage from Goldsmith shows his graceful\r\nturn of sentence and his command of vocabulary. The style is clearness\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n   The next that presented for a place, was a most whimsical figure\r\n   indeed. He was hung round with papers of his own composing, not\r\n   unlike those who sing ballads in the streets, and came dancing\r\n   up to the door with all the confidence of instant admittance.\r\n   The volubility of his motion and address prevented my being able\r\n   to read more of his cargo than the word _Inspector_, which\r\n   was written in great letters at the top of some of the papers.\r\n   He opened the coach-door himself without any ceremony, and was\r\n   just slipping in, when the coachman, with as little ceremony,\r\n   pulled him back. Our figure seemed perfectly angry at this\r\n   repulse, and demanded gentleman’s satisfaction. “Lord, sir!”\r\n   replied the coachman, “instead of proper luggage, by your bulk\r\n   you seem loaded for a West India voyage. You are big enough,\r\n   with all your papers, to crack twenty stage-coaches. Excuse me,\r\n   indeed, sir, for you must not enter.”\r\n                                                      _The Bee_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe more ornate class of prose is represented by the _Rambler_\r\nessays of Johnson and the writings of Gibbon and Burke. Of the three\r\nJohnsonese is the most cumbrous, being overloaded with long words and\r\ncomplicated sentences, though it has a massive strength of its own.\r\nGibbon bears his mantle with ease and dignity, and Burke has so much\r\nnatural vitality that his style hardly weighs upon him at all; he does\r\nstumble, but rarely, whereas it is sometimes urged as a fault of the\r\nprose of Gibbon that it is so uniformly good that the perfection of it\r\nbecomes deadening.\r\n\r\n\r\n         TABLE TO ILLUSTRATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF LITERARY FORMS\r\n\r\n

+----+----------+---------------------+-------------+------------+------------+--------------+-----------+-------------+\r\n\r\nA fresh and highly interesting style is the poetic prose of\r\nMacpherson’s _Ossian_. Macpherson’s style is not ornate, for\r\nit is drawn from the simplest elements; it possesses a solemnity of\r\nexpression, and so decided a rhythm and cadence, that the effect is\r\nalmost lyrical. In the passage now given the reader should note that\r\nthe sentences are nearly of uniform length, and that they could easily\r\nbe written as separate lines of irregular verse:\r\n\r\n    Her voice came over the sea. Arindal my son descended from\r\n    the hill; rough in spoils of the chase. His arrows rattled by his\r\n    side; his bow was in his hand; five dark grey dogs attend his\r\n    steps. He saw fierce Erath on the shore; he seized and bound\r\n    him to an oak. Thick wind the thongs of the hide around his\r\n    limbs; he loads the wind with his groans. Arindal ascends the\r\n    deep in his boat, to bring Daura to land. Amar came in his\r\n    wrath, and let fly the grey-feathered shaft. It sunk, it sunk in\r\n    thy heart, O Arindal my son; for Erath the traitor thou diedst.\r\n    The oar is stopped at once; he panted on the rock and expired.\r\n    What is thy grief, O Daura, when round thy feet is poured thy\r\n    brother’s blood! The boat is broken in twain. Amar plunges\r\n    into the sea, to rescue his Daura, or die. Sudden a blast from\r\n    the hill came over the waves. He sunk, and he rose no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               EXERCISES\r\n\r\n    1. The first extract given below is in Johnsonese, the second\r\n    is written in Johnson’s later manner. Compare the\r\n    two with regard to their vocabulary and sentence-construction,\r\n    and say which is the more ornate and which is the\r\n    clearer and more vigorous. Which of the two do you\r\n    prefer?\r\n\r\n    (1) In this work, when it shall be found that much is omitted,\r\n    let it not be forgotten that much likewise is performed; and\r\n    though no book was ever spared out of tenderness to the author,\r\n    and the world is little solicitous to know whence proceeded the\r\n    faults of that which it condemns, yet it may gratify curiosity to\r\n    inform it, that the English Dictionary was written with little\r\n    assistance of the learned, and without any patronage of the great;\r\n    not in the soft obscurities of retirement, or under the shelter of\r\n    academic bowers, but amid inconvenience and distraction, in sickness\r\n    and in sorrow. It may repress the triumph of malignant\r\n    criticism to observe, that if our language is not here fully displayed,\r\n    I have only failed in an attempt which no human powers\r\n    have hitherto completed. If the lexicons of ancient tongues, now\r\n    immutably fixed, and comprised in a few volumes, be yet, after\r\n    the toil of successive ages, inadequate and delusive; if the aggregated\r\n    knowledge and co-operating diligence of the Italian\r\n    academicians did not secure them from the censure of Beni; if\r\n    the embodied critics of France, when fifty years had been spent\r\n    upon their work, were obliged to change its economy, and give\r\n    their second edition another form, I may surely be contented without\r\n    the praise of perfection.\r\n                                 JOHNSON, _Preface to “Dictionary,”_ 1755\r\n\r\n\r\n   (2) It is not to be inferred that of this poetical vigour Pope\r\n   had only a little, because Dryden had more; for every other\r\n   writer since Milton must give place to Pope; and even of Dryden\r\n   it must be said, that if he has brighter paragraphs he has not\r\n   better poems. Dryden’s performances were always hasty, either\r\n   excited by some external occasion, or extorted by domestic\r\n   necessity; he composed without consideration, and published\r\n   without correction. What his mind could supply at call, or\r\n   gather in one excursion, was all that he sought, and all that he\r\n   gave. The dilatory caution of Pope enabled him to condense his\r\n   sentiments, to multiply his images, and to accumulate all that\r\n   study might produce or chance might supply. If the flights of\r\n   Dryden therefore are higher, Pope continues longer on the wing.\r\n   If of Dryden’s fire the blaze is brighter, of Pope’s the heat is\r\n   more regular and constant. Dryden often surpasses expectation,\r\n   and Pope never falls below it. Dryden is read with frequent\r\n   astonishment, and Pope with perpetual delight.\r\n                             JOHNSON, _Lives of the Poets_, 1780\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Compare the following passage with the example of Johnsonese\r\ngiven in the last question. Which is the more abstract, and which\r\nis the more ornate? Is there any resemblance between the two in\r\nsentence-construction and vocabulary?\r\n\r\n   There are few great personages in history who have been more\r\n   exposed to the calumny of enemies, and the adulation of friends,\r\n   than Queen Elizabeth, and yet there is scarce any whose\r\n   reputation has been more certainly determined by the unanimous\r\n   consent of posterity. The unusual length of her administration,\r\n   and the strong features of her character, were able to overcome\r\n   all prejudices; and obliging her detractors to abate much of\r\n   their invectives, and her admirers somewhat of their panegyrics,\r\n   have at last, in spite of political factions, and, what is\r\n   more, of religious animosities, produced an uniform judgment\r\n   with regard to her conduct. Her vigour, her constancy, her\r\n   magnanimity, her penetration, vigilance, address, are allowed\r\n   to merit the highest praises, and appear not to have been\r\n   surpassed by any person who ever filled a throne: a conduct less\r\n   rigorous, less imperious, more sincere, more indulgent to her\r\n   people, would have been requisite to form a perfect character.\r\n   By the force of her mind, she controlled all her more active\r\n   and stronger qualities, and prevented them from running into\r\n   excess. Her heroism was exempt from all temerity, her frugality\r\n   from avarice, her friendship from partiality, her active temper\r\n   from turbulency and a vain ambition. She guarded not herself\r\n   with equal care or equal success from lesser infirmities--the\r\n   rivalship of beauty, the desire of admiration, the jealousy of\r\n   love, and the sallies of anger.\r\n                                    HUME, _The History of England_\r\n\r\n\r\n3.

(_a_) Classify the styles of the following extracts into plain,\r\nornate, or middle, and give reasons for your classification in each\r\ncase. (_b_) How far does the style of each suit the subject? (_c_) Give\r\na short account of each of the authors represented. (_d_) How far does\r\nthe style in each case reveal the character of the author?\r\n\r\n   (1) Sir, your throne cannot stand secure upon the principles\r\n   of unconditional submission and passive obedience; on powers\r\n   exercised without the concurrence of the people to be governed;\r\n   on Acts made in defiance of their prejudices and habits; on\r\n   acquiescence procured by foreign mercenary troops, and secured\r\n   by standing armies. These may possibly be the foundation of\r\n   other thrones; they must be the subversion of yours. It was\r\n   not to passive principles in our ancestors, that we owe the\r\n   honour of appearing before a sovereign, who cannot feel that\r\n   he is a prince without knowing that we ought to be free. The\r\n   Revolution was a departure from the ancient course of the\r\n   descent of this monarchy. The people, at that time, re-entered\r\n   into their original rights; and it was not because a positive\r\n   law authorised what was then done, but because the freedom\r\n   and safety of the subject, the origin and cause of all laws,\r\n   required a proceeding paramount and superior to them. At that\r\n   ever-memorable and instructive period, the letter of the law\r\n   was superseded in favour of the substance of liberty. To the\r\n   free choice, therefore, of the people, without either king\r\n   or parliament, we owe that happy establishment, out of which\r\n   both King and Parliament were regenerated. From that great\r\n   principle of liberty have originated the statutes, confirming\r\n   and ratifying the establishment from which your majesty derives\r\n   your right to rule over us. Those statutes have not given us our\r\n   liberties; our liberties have produced them.

The kestrel,\r\n   or windhover, has a peculiar mode of hanging in the air in\r\n   one place, his wings all the while being briskly agitated.\r\n   Hen-harriers fly low over heaths or fields of corn and beat the\r\n   ground regularly like a pointer or setting-dog. Owls move in a\r\n   buoyant manner, as if lighter than the air; they seem to want\r\n   ballast. There is a peculiarity belonging to ravens that must\r\n   draw the attention even of the most incurious--they spend all\r\n   their leisure time in striking and cuffing each other on the\r\n   wing in a kind of playful skirmish; and, when they move from\r\n   one place to another, frequently turn on their backs with a\r\n   loud croak and seem to be falling to the ground. When this odd\r\n   gesture betides them, they are scratching themselves with one\r\n   foot, and thus lose the centre of gravity. Rooks sometimes dive\r\n   and tumble in a frolicsome manner; crows and daws swagger in\r\n   their walk; wood-peckers fly _volatu undoso_, opening and\r\n   closing their wings at every stroke, and so are always rising or\r\n   falling in curves.\r\n                              WHITE, _The Natural History of Selborne_\r\n\r\n\r\n5.

We give first Johnson’s famous letter in which he refuses to accept\r\nthe tardy patronage of Lord Chesterfield. Show how the style is\r\nappropriate to the subject, and how the letter reveals the life and\r\ncharacter of Johnson. Compare the style and temper of this letter with\r\nthose of the one that follows. In this extract Horace Walpole describes\r\nthe burial of George II. From this brief extract, what can you tell of\r\nthe character of Walpole?\r\n\r\n\r\n(1)\r\n                                             _February 7, 1755_\r\n\r\n    MY LORD,\r\n   I have been lately informed, by the proprietor of _The World_,\r\n   that two papers, in which my _Dictionary_ is recommended to the\r\n   public, were written by your Lordship. To be so distinguished is\r\n   an honour which, being very little accustomed to favours from\r\n   the great, I know not well how to receive or in what terms to\r\n   acknowledge.\r\n\r\n   When, with some slight encouragement, I first visited your\r\n   Lordship, I was overpowered, like the rest of mankind, by the\r\n   enchantment of your address, and could not forbear to wish\r\n   that I might boast myself _le vainqueur du vainqueur de la\r\n   terre_,--that I might obtain that regard for which I saw the\r\n   world contending; but I found my attendance so little encouraged\r\n   that neither pride nor modesty would suffer me to continue\r\n   it. When I had once addressed your Lordship in public, I had\r\n   exhausted all the art of pleasing which a retired and uncourtly\r\n   scholar can possess. I had done all that I could; and no man is\r\n   well pleased to have his all neglected, be it ever so little.\r\n\r\n   Seven years, my Lord, have now passed since I waited in your\r\n   outward rooms, or was repulsed from your door; during which time\r\n   I have been pushing on my work through difficulties, of which\r\n   it is useless to complain, and have brought it at last to the\r\n   verge of publication, without one act of assistance, one word of\r\n   encouragement, or one smile of favour. Such treatment I did not\r\n   expect, for I never had a patron before. The shepherd in Virgil\r\n   grew at last acquainted with Love, and found him a native of the\r\n   rocks. Is not a patron, my Lord, one who looks with unconcern on\r\n   a man struggling for life in the water, and when he has reached\r\n   ground, encumbers him with help?\r\n\r\n   The notice you have been pleased to take of my labours, had it\r\n   been early, had been kind; but it has been delayed till I am\r\n   indifferent, and cannot enjoy it; till I am solitary, and cannot\r\n   impart it; till I am known, and do not want it. I hope it is\r\n   no very cynical asperity, not to confess obligations when no\r\n   benefit has been received; or to be unwilling that the public\r\n   should consider me as owing that to a patron, which Providence\r\n   has enabled me to do for myself.\r\n\r\n   Having carried on my work thus far with so little obligation to\r\n   any favourer of learning, I shall not be disappointed though\r\n   I should conclude it, if less be possible, with less; for I\r\n   have been long wakened from that dream of hope in which I once\r\n   boasted myself with so much exultation,\r\n                             My Lord,\r\n        Your Lordship’s most humble, most obedient Servant,\r\n                                                     SAM. JOHNSON\r\n\r\n\r\n(2)\r\n                           ARLINGTON STREET, _November 13, 1760_\r\n   ... Do you know, I had the curiosity to go to the burying\r\n   t’other night; I had never seen a royal funeral; nay, I walked\r\n   as a rag of quality, which I found would be, and so it was, the\r\n   easiest way of seeing it. It is absolutely a noble sight. The\r\n   Prince’s Chamber, hung with purple, and a quantity of silver\r\n   lamps, the coffin under a canopy of purple velvet, and six vast\r\n   chandeliers of silver on high stands, had a very good effect.\r\n   The Ambassador from Tripoli and his son were carried to see\r\n   that chamber. The procession through a line of foot-guards,\r\n   every seventh man bearing a torch, the horse-guards lining the\r\n   outside, their officers with drawn sabres and crape sashes\r\n   on horseback, the drums muffled, the fifes, bells tolling,\r\n   and minute guns, all this was very solemn. But the charm was\r\n   the entrance of the Abbey, where we were received by the Dean\r\n   and Chapter in rich copes, the choir and almsmen all bearing\r\n   torches; the whole Abbey so illuminated, that one saw it to\r\n   greater advantage than by day; the tombs, long aisles, and\r\n   fretted roof, all appearing distinctly, and with the happiest\r\n   chiaroscuro. There wanted nothing but incense, and little\r\n   chapels here and there, with priests saying mass for the repose\r\n   of the defunct--yet one could not complain of its not being\r\n   catholic enough. I had been in dread of being coupled with some\r\n   boy of ten years old--but the heralds were not very accurate,\r\n   and I walked with George Grenville, taller and older enough to\r\n   keep me in countenance.\r\n                                                        WALPOLE\r\n\r\n\r\n7. From a scrutiny of the subject and style of the following extracts\r\nassign the authorship of each. State clearly the reasons that lead you\r\nto select the particular author. Write a brief appreciation of the\r\nstyle of each extract.\r\n\r\n   (1) Mr Davies mentioned my name; and respectfully introduced\r\n   me to him. I was much agitated; and recollecting his prejudice\r\n   against the Scotch, of which I had heard much, I said to Davies,\r\n   “Don’t tell where I come from.”--“From Scotland,” cried\r\n   Davies, roguishly. “Mr Johnson,” said I, “I do indeed come from\r\n   Scotland, but I cannot help it.” I am willing to flatter myself\r\n   that I meant this as light pleasantry to soothe and conciliate\r\n   him, and not as a humiliating abasement at the expense of my\r\n   country. But however that might be, this speech was somewhat\r\n   unlucky; for with that quickness of wit for which he was so\r\n   remarkable, he seized the expression “come from Scotland,” which\r\n   I used in the sense of being of that country; and, as if I had\r\n   said that I had come away from it, or left it, retorted, “That,\r\n   sir, I find, is what a very great many of your countrymen cannot\r\n   help.” This stroke stunned me a good deal; and when we had sat\r\n   down, I felt myself not a little embarrassed, and apprehensive\r\n   of what might come next.\r\n\r\n   (2) I have presumed to mark the moment of conception: I shall\r\n   now commemorate the hour of my final deliverance. It was on the\r\n   day, or rather night, of the 27th of June, 1787, between the\r\n   hours of eleven and twelve, that I wrote the last lines of the\r\n   last page, in a summer-house in my garden. After laying down my\r\n   pen I took several turns in a _berceau_, or covered walk\r\n   of acacias, which commands a prospect of the country, the lake,\r\n   and the mountains. The air was temperate, the sky was serene,\r\n   the silver orb of the moon was reflected from the waters,\r\n   and all nature was silent. I will not dissemble the first\r\n   emotions of joy on recovery of my freedom, and, perhaps, the\r\n   establishment of my fame. But my pride was soon humbled, and a\r\n   sober melancholy was spread over my mind, by the idea that I had\r\n   taken an everlasting leave of an old and agreeable companion,\r\n   and that, whatsoever might be the future fate of my history, the\r\n   life of the historian must be short and precarious.\r\n\r\n    (3) An’ now, auld Cloots,[188] I ken ye’re thinkin,\r\n        A certain Bardie’s rantin, drinkin,\r\n        Some luckless hour will send him linkin,[189]\r\n                      To your black pit;\r\n        But, faith! he’ll turn a corner jinkin,\r\n                      An’ cheat you yet.\r\n\r\n        But, fare you weel, auld Nickie-ben!\r\n        O wad ye tak a thought an’ men’!\r\n        Ye aiblins[190] might--I dinna ken--\r\n                      Still hae a stake--\r\n        I’m wae to think upo’ yon den,\r\n                      E’en for your sake!\r\n\r\n   (4) “I fought just as well,” continued the Corporal, “when the\r\n   regiment called me Trim, as when they called me James Butler.”\r\n   ... “And for my own part,” said my uncle Toby, “though I\r\n   should blush to boast of myself, Trim;--yet, had my name been\r\n   Alexander, I could have done no more at Namur than my duty.” ...\r\n   “Bless your Honour!” cried Trim, advancing three steps as he\r\n   spoke, “does a man think of his Christian name when he goes upon\r\n   the attack?” ... “Or when he stands in the trench, Trim?” cried\r\n   my uncle Toby, looking firm.... “Or when he enters a breach?”\r\n   said Trim, pushing in between two chairs.... “Or forces the\r\n   lines?” cried my uncle, rising up, and pushing his crutch like a\r\n   pike.... “Or facing a platoon?” cried Trim presenting his stick\r\n   like a firelock.... “Or when he marches up the glacis?” cried my\r\n   uncle Toby, looking warm and setting his foot upon his stool.\r\n\r\n8. How far are the statements in the following passage correct? Give\r\nexamples of what Macaulay refers to, and say if his remarks are\r\nexaggerated in any form.\r\n\r\n   Johnson came up to London precisely at the time when the\r\n   condition of a man of letters was most miserable and degraded.\r\n   It was a dark night between two sunny days.... A writer had\r\n   little to hope from the patronage of powerful individuals.\r\n   The patronage of the public did not yet furnish the means of\r\n   comfortable subsistence.... If he had lived thirty years earlier\r\n   he would have sat in parliament, and would have been entrusted\r\n   with embassies to the High Allies.\r\n                                                        MACAULAY\r\n\r\n\r\n9. State how far the principles set out in the passage below are\r\nfollowed in the novel of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n   A novel is a large diffused picture, comprehending the\r\n   characters of life, disposed in different groups and exhibited\r\n   in various attitudes, for the purposes of an uniform plan. This\r\n   plan cannot be executed with propriety, probability, or success,\r\n   without a principal personage to attract the attention, unite\r\n   the incidents, unwind the clue of the labyrinth, and at last\r\n   close the scene, by virtue of his own importance.\r\n                             SMOLLETT, _Ferdinand, Count Fathom_\r\n\r\n\r\n10. “The eighteenth century established a prose style.” (Craik.)\r\nDiscuss this statement on some such lines as the following: (_a_) Was\r\nthere no “established” style in prose before the eighteenth century?\r\n(_b_) Who “established” it then? (_c_) What are the peculiarities of\r\nthe new prose style? (_d_) What are the purposes for which it was used?\r\n(_e_) Has it been perpetuated? (_f_) Who has used it?\r\n\r\n11. Matthew Arnold calls Burns “a beast with splendid gleams.” Why a\r\n“beast”? And what does he mean by the “gleams”? Is the criticism fair\r\nto Burns?\r\n\r\n12.

The European War.= The close of the eighteenth century saw\r\nEngland and France engaged in open warfare (1793). Many causes\r\ncontributed to set the war in motion, and many more kept it intractably\r\nin operation. Hostilities dragged on till 1815, in the end bringing\r\nabout the extinction of the French Republic, the birth of which was\r\ngreeted so joyfully by the English Liberals, the rise and destruction\r\nof the power of Napoleon, and the restoration of the Bourbon dynasty.\r\nThese events had their effects in every corner of Europe, and in none\r\nmore strongly than in England.\r\n\r\n=2. The Reaction.= It has been well said: “At the beginning of\r\nevery revolution men hope, for they think of all that mankind may\r\ngain in a new world; in its next phase they fear, for they think of\r\nwhat mankind may lose.” This was the case with the French Revolution.\r\nThe elder writers of the period, with Wordsworth and Coleridge as\r\nconspicuous examples, hailed the new era with joy. Then, as the\r\nRevolution proceeded to unexpected developments, there came in turn\r\ndisappointment, disillusion, dejection, and despair, and, notably in\r\nthe case of Wordsworth, the rejection of youthful ideas and the soured\r\nadoption of the older reactionary faith. The younger writers, such as\r\nLeigh Hunt, Shelley, and Keats, still adhered to the Revolutionary\r\ndoctrines, but the warmth of the early days had already passed away.\r\n\r\n=3. Social Conditions.= The conclusion of the long war brought\r\ninevitable misery; low wages, unemployment, and heavy taxation gave\r\nrise to fiery resentment and fierce demands on the part of the people.\r\nMen like Shelley and Ebenezer Elliott called aloud for social justice;\r\nin gentler mood Mrs. Hemans and Tom Hood bewailed the social misery. We\r\nhave the massacre of Peterloo and the wild rioting over the Reform Bill\r\nand the Corn Laws.\r\n\r\nThe Reform Bill (1832) was a grudging concession to the general\r\ndiscontent. To conservative minds, like those of Scott and the maturer\r\nWordsworth, the Bill seemed to pronounce the dissolution of every\r\nsocial tie. But the Bill brought only disappointment to its friends. In\r\nthe next chapter we shall see how the demand for social amelioration\r\ndeepened and broadened, and colored the literature of the time.\r\n\r\nThe interest in social conditions became intensified toward the end\r\nof the nineteenth century, until it has grown to be one of the chief\r\nfeatures of modern literature.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RETURN TO NATURE\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter we noted the beginnings and development of the new\r\nfeeling for nature. This chapter sees the full effects of the movement,\r\nand the subsequent reaction that followed.\r\n\r\n=1. Abundant Output.= Even the lavishness of the Elizabethans\r\ncannot excel that of this age. The development of new ideas brings\r\nfresh inspiration for poetry, and the poetical sky is bright with\r\nluminaries of the first magnitude. In prose we may note especially the\r\nfruitful yield of the novel, the rejuvenation of the essay, and the\r\nunprecedented activity of critical and miscellaneous writers. This is\r\nthe most fertile period of our literature.\r\n\r\n=2. Great Range of Subject.= The new and buoyant race of writers,\r\nespecially the poets, lays the knowledge and experience of all ages\r\nunder a heavy toll. The classical writers are explored anew, and are\r\ndrawn upon by the genius of Keats and Shelley; the Middle Ages inspire\r\nthe novels of Scott and the poems of Coleridge, Southey, and many more;\r\nmodern times are analyzed and dissected in the work of the novelists,\r\nthe satires of Byron, and the productions of the miscellaneous writers.\r\nThis is indeed the return to nature, for all nature is scrutinized and\r\nsummed up afresh.\r\n\r\n=3. Treatment of Nature.= If for the moment we take the restricted\r\nmeaning of the word, and understand by “nature” the common phenomena of\r\nearth, air, and sea, we find the poetical attitude to nature altering\r\nprofoundly. In the work of Cowper, Crabbe, and Gray the treatment is\r\nprincipally the simple chronicle and sympathetic observation of natural\r\nfeatures. In the new race of poets the observation becomes more matured\r\nand intimate. Notably in the case of Wordsworth, the feeling for\r\nnature rises to a passionate veneration that is love and religion too.\r\nTo Wordsworth nature is not only a procession of seasons and seasonal\r\nfruition: it is the eye of all things, natural and supernatural, into\r\nwhich the observant soul can peer and behold the spirit that inhabits\r\nall things. Nature is thus amplified and glorified; it is to be sought,\r\nnot only in the flowers and the fields, but also in\r\n\r\n                          the light of setting suns,\r\n    And the round ocean and the living air,\r\n    And the blue sky, and in the mind of man.\r\n\r\n=4. Political and Periodical Writing.= The age did not produce a\r\npamphleteer of the first class like Swift or Burke, but the turbulence\r\nof the period was clearly marked in the immense productivity of its\r\npolitical writers. The number of periodicals was greatly augmented, and\r\nwe notice the first of the great daily journals that are still a strong\r\nelement in literature and politics. _The Morning Chronicle_ (1769)\r\nand _The Morning Post_ (1772) were started by Henry Bate, _The Times_\r\n(1785) by John Walter. Of a more irresponsible type were the Radical\r\n_Political Register_ (1802) of Cobbett and _The Examiner_ (1808) of\r\nLeigh Hunt. A race of powerful literary magazines sprang to life: _The\r\nEdinburgh Review_ (1802), _The Quarterly Review_ (1809), _The London\r\nMagazine_ (1817), _Blackwood’s Magazine_ (1817), and _The Westminster\r\nReview_ (1827). Such excellent publications reacted strongly upon\r\nauthorship, and were responsible for much of the best work of Hazlitt,\r\nLamb, Southey, and a host of other miscellaneous writers.\r\n\r\n=5. The Influence of Germany.= The increasing bitterness of the long\r\nwar with France almost extinguished the literary influence of the\r\nFrench language, which, as was indicated in the last chapter, had been\r\naffecting English literature deeply. In the place of French, the study\r\nof German literature and learning came rapidly into favor. The first\r\npoetical work of Scott is based on the German, and the effects of\r\nthe new influence can be further observed in the works of Coleridge,\r\nShelley, Byron, and many more. In the course of time German increased\r\nits hold upon English, until by the middle of the nineteenth century it\r\nwas perhaps the dominating foreign tongue.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM WORDSWORTH (1770–1850)\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= Wordsworth was born at Cockermouth, a town which is\r\nactually outside the Lake District, but well within hail of it. His\r\nfather, who was a lawyer, died when William was thirteen years old. The\r\nelder Wordsworth left a modest sum of money, which was not available\r\nat the time of his death, so that William had to depend on the\r\ngenerosity of two uncles, who paid for his schooling at Hawkshead, near\r\nLake Windermere. Subsequently Wordsworth went to Cambridge, entering\r\nSt. John’s College in 1787. His work at the university was quite\r\nundistinguished, and having graduated in 1791 he left with no fixed\r\ncareer in view. After spending a few months in London he crossed over\r\nto France (1791), and stayed at Orléans and Blois for nearly a year.\r\nAn enthusiasm for the Revolution was aroused in him; he himself has\r\nchronicled the mood in one of his happiest passages:\r\n\r\n    Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,\r\n    But to be young was very heaven.\r\n\r\nHe returned to Paris in 1792 just after the September massacres, and\r\nthe sights and stories that greeted him there shook his faith in\r\nthe dominant political doctrine. Even yet, however, he thought of\r\nbecoming a Girondin, or moderate Republican, but his allowance from\r\nhome was stopped, and he returned to England. With his sister Dorothy\r\n(henceforward his lifelong companion) he settled in a little cottage\r\nin Dorset; then, having met Coleridge, they moved to Alfoxden, a house\r\nin Somersetshire, in order to live near him. It was there that the\r\ntwo poets took the series of walks the fruit of which was to be the\r\n_Lyrical Ballads_.\r\n\r\nAfter a visit to Germany in 1798 the Wordsworths settled in the Lake\r\nDistrict, which was to be their home for the future. In turn they\r\noccupied Dove Cottage, at Town-End, Grasmere (1802), Allan Bank (1808),\r\nGrasmere Parsonage (1811), and lastly the well-known residence of\r\nRydal Mount, which was Wordsworth’s home from 1813 till his death.\r\nShortly after he had moved to Rydal Mount he received the sinecure of\r\nDistributor of Stamps for Westmorland, and was put out of reach of\r\npoverty.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of his life was a model of domesticity. He was carefully\r\ntended by his wife and sister, who, with a zeal that was noteworthy,\r\nthough it was injudicious, treasured every scrap of his poetry that\r\nthey could lay their hands on. His great passion was for traveling. He\r\nexplored most of the accessible parts of the Continent, and visited\r\nScotland several times. On the last occasion (1831) he and his daughter\r\nrenewed their acquaintance with Scott at Abbotsford, and saw the great\r\nnovelist when he was fast crumbling into mental ruin. Wordsworth’s\r\npoetry, which at first had been received with derision or indifference,\r\nwas now winning its way, and recognition was general. In 1839 Oxford\r\nconferred upon him the degree of D.C.L.; in 1842 the Crown awarded him\r\na pension of £300 a year; and on the death of Southey in 1843 he became\r\nPoet Laureate.\r\n\r\nLong before this time he had discarded his early ideals and become the\r\nupholder of conservatism. Perhaps he is not “the lost leader” whose\r\nrecantation Browning bewails with rather theatrical woe; but he lived\r\nto deplore the Reform Bill and to oppose the causes to which his early\r\ngenius had been dedicated. Throughout his life, however, he never\r\nwavered in his faith in himself and his immortality as a poet. He\r\nlived to see his own belief in his powers triumphantly justified. It\r\nis seldom indeed that such gigantic egoism is so amply and so justly\r\nrepaid.\r\n\r\n=2. His Poetry.= He records that his earliest verses were written at\r\nschool, and that they were “a tame imitation of Pope’s versification.”\r\nThis is an interesting admission of the still surviving domination of\r\nthe earlier poet. At the university he composed some poetry, which\r\nappeared as _The Evening Walk_ (1793) and _Descriptive Sketches_\r\n(1793). In style these poems have little originality, but they already\r\nshow the Wordsworthian eye for nature. The firstfruits of his genius\r\nwere seen in the _Lyrical Ballads_ (1798), a joint production by\r\nColeridge and himself, which was published at Bristol.\r\n\r\nRegarding the inception of this remarkable book both Wordsworth and\r\nColeridge have left accounts, which vary to some extent, though not\r\nmaterially. Coleridge’s may be taken as the more plausible. He says in\r\nhis _Biographia Literaria_:\r\n\r\n   It was agreed that my endeavours should be directed to persons\r\n   and characters supernatural, or at least romantic, yet so as\r\n   to transfer from our inward nature a human interest and a\r\n   semblance of truth sufficient to procure for these shadows of\r\n   the imagination that willing suspension of disbelief for the\r\n   moment which constitutes poetic faith. Mr Wordsworth was to give\r\n   the charm of novelty to things of everyday life by awakening\r\n   the mind’s attention to the loveliness and wonders of the world\r\n   before us.\r\n\r\nThis volume is epoch-making, for it is the prelude to the Romantic\r\nmovement proper. Wordsworth had the larger share in the book. Some of\r\nhis poems in it, such as _The Thorn_ and _The Idiot Boy_, are condemned\r\nas being trivial and childish in style; a few, such as _Simon Lee_ and\r\n_Expostulation and Reply_, are more adequate in their expression; and\r\nthe concluding piece, _Tintern Abbey_, is one of the triumphs of his\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\nDuring his visit to Germany in 1798–99 Wordsworth composed such typical\r\npoems as _Lucy Gray_, _Ruth_, and _Nutting_, which along with a large\r\nnumber of the same kind were issued in two volumes in 1807. This work,\r\nwhich comprises the flower of his poetry, was sharply assailed by the\r\ncritics; but on the whole it amended the puerilities of the earlier\r\nvolume, and set in motion the steady undercurrent of appreciation that\r\nwas finally to overwhelm his detractors. While he was in Germany he\r\nplanned _The Prelude_, which was not concluded till 1805, and remained\r\nunpublished during his lifetime. _The Prelude_, which dealt with his\r\neducation and early ideals, was meant to be the introduction to an\r\nenormous blank-verse poem, chiefly on himself. The entire work was to\r\nbe called _The Recluse_, and _The Excursion_ (1814) was the second and\r\nonly other completed part of it. It is on the whole fortunate that the\r\nentire poem was never finished. _The Excursion_ is in itself a huge\r\npoem of nine books, and long stretches of it are dull and prosaic. It\r\nis inferior to _The Prelude_, which, though it is unequal in style,\r\nhas some of the very best Wordsworthian blank verse; and it is only\r\nreasonable to imagine that further instalments of _The Recluse_ would\r\nmark an increasing decline in poetic merit.\r\n\r\nAfter the publication of _The Excursion_ Wordsworth’s poetical power\r\nwas clearly on the wane, but his productivity was unimpaired. His later\r\nvolumes include _The White Doe of Rylstone_ (1815), _The Waggoner_\r\n(1819), _Peter Bell_ (1819), _Yarrow Revisited_ (1835), and _The\r\nBorderers_ (1842), a drama. The progress of the works marks the decline\r\nin an increasing degree. There are flashes of the old spirit, such as\r\nwe see in his lines upon the death of “the Ettrick Shepherd”; but the\r\nfire and stately intonation become rarer, and mere garrulity becomes\r\nmore and more apparent.\r\n\r\n=3. His Theory of Poetry.= In the preface to the second edition of the\r\n_Lyrical Ballads_ Wordsworth set out his theory of poetry, and to this\r\ntheory he continued to do lip-service, while in practice he constantly\r\nviolated it. The Wordsworthian dogma can be divided into two portions,\r\nconcerning (_a_) the subject and (_b_) the style of poetry.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Regarding subject, Wordsworth declares his preference for\r\n“incidents and situations from common life”; to obtain such situations\r\n“humble and rustic life is generally chosen, because in that condition\r\nthe essential passions of the heart find a better soil.” In this\r\nrespect Wordsworth was staunch to his declared opinions, because the\r\nmajority of his poems deal with humble and rustic. life, including his\r\nown.\r\n\r\n(_b_) With regard to style, Wordsworth declares that the language\r\nof poetry ought to be “the language really used by men,” especially\r\nby rustics, because the latter “speak a plainer and more emphatic\r\nlanguage.” A little reflection will show that this contention is\r\nat best only half true, and Wordsworth laid himself open to deadly\r\ncriticism. It was this part of his theory, moreover, that he himself\r\nconstantly violated. Coleridge, who was Wordsworth’s great friend, but\r\nwho held his critical faith higher than personal predilection, had but\r\nto quote Wordsworth’s own poems to condemn him. No doubt Wordsworth in\r\nsuch pieces as _Lucy Gray_ and _We are Seven_ does use the language\r\nof ordinary men; but in his greatest poems he prefers a language of\r\na certain stiff ornateness, fired and fused by the passion of his\r\nimaginative insight. As Coleridge pointed out, it is not likely that a\r\nrustic would say\r\n\r\n              The sounding cataract\r\n    Haunted me like a passion.\r\n\r\nYet this expression is typical of Wordsworth’s style at its best.\r\n\r\n=4. Features of his Poetry.= (_a_) _Its Inequality and its\r\nLimitations._ All the critics of Wordsworth are at pains to point out\r\nthe mass of inferior work that came from his pen. Matthew Arnold,\r\none of the acutest of the poet’s admirers, closes the record of\r\nWordsworth’s best work with the year 1808, even before the composition\r\nof _The Excursion_. This poem is long, meditative, and often prosaic,\r\nand these tendencies become more marked as the years pass. Before the\r\nyear 1808 he had produced poems as intensely and artistically beautiful\r\nas any in the language. It was hard, however, for Wordsworth to\r\nappreciate his limitations, which were many and serious. He had little\r\nsense of humor, a scanty dramatic power, and only a meager narrative\r\ngift, but he strove to exploit all these qualities in his work. His one\r\ndrama, _The Borderers_, was only a partial success, and his narrative\r\npoems, like _Ruth_ and _The White Doe of Rylstone_, are not among the\r\nbest of his work.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Its Egoism._ In a person of lesser caliber such a degree of\r\nself-esteem as Wordsworth’s would have been ridiculous; in his case,\r\nwith the undoubted genius that was in the man, it was something almost\r\nheroic. Domestic circumstances--the adoration of a couple of women and\r\nthe cloistral seclusion of the life he led--confirmed him in the habit\r\nof taking himself too seriously. The best of his shorter poems deal\r\nwith his own experiences; and his longest works, _The Prelude_ and\r\n_The Excursion_, describe his career, both inward and outward, with\r\na fullness, closeness, and laborious anxiety that are unique in our\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\n(_c_) In spite of this self-obsession he is curiously deficient in the\r\npurely _lyrical_ gift. He cannot bare his bosom, as Burns does; he\r\ncannot leap into the ether like Shelley. Yet he excels, especially in\r\nthe face of nature, in the expression of a reflective and analytic mood\r\nwhich is both personal and general. The following lyric illustrates\r\nthis mood to perfection:\r\n\r\n    My heart leaps up when I behold\r\n      A rainbow in the sky:\r\n    So was it when my life began;\r\n    So is it now I am a man;\r\n    So be it when I shall grow old,\r\n      Or let me die!\r\n    The Child is father of the Man;\r\n    And I could wish my days to be\r\n    Bound each to each by natural piety.\r\n\r\nSometimes he does touch on intimate emotions, but then he tends to\r\nbe diffident and decorous, hinting at rather than proclaiming the\r\npassions that he feels. The series of _Lucy_ poems are typical of\r\ntheir kind:\r\n\r\n    She dwelt among the untrodden ways\r\n      Beside the springs of Dove,\r\n    A Maid whom there were none to praise,\r\n      And very few to love.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    She lived unknown, and few could know\r\n      When Lucy ceased to be;\r\n    But she is in her grave, and, oh,\r\n      The difference to me!\r\n\r\nSuch a lyrical gift, reflective rather than passionate, finds a\r\ncongenial mode of expression in the sonnet, the most complicated and\r\nexpository of the lyrical forms. In his sonnets his lyrical mood burns\r\nclear and strong, and as a result they rank among the best in English\r\npoetry.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _His Treatment of Nature._ His dealings with nature are his chief\r\nglory as a poet.\r\n\r\n(1) His treatment is accurate and first-hand. As he explained, he wrote\r\nwith his eye “steadily fixed on the object.” Even the slightest of his\r\npoems have evidence of close observation:\r\n\r\n      The cattle are grazing,\r\n      Their heads never raising;\r\n    There are forty feeding like one.\r\n\r\nThe most polished of his poems have the same stamp, as can be seen in\r\n_Resolution and Independence_. “The image of the hare,” he says with\r\nreference to this poem, quoted below, “I then observed on the ridge of\r\nthe Fell.”\r\n\r\n    There was a roaring in the wind all night;\r\n    The rain came heavily and fell in floods;\r\n    But now the sun is rising calm and bright;\r\n    The birds are singing in the distant woods;\r\n    Over his own sweet voice the Stock-dove broods;\r\n    The Jay makes answer as the Magpie chatters;\r\n    And all the air is filled with pleasant noise of waters.\r\n\r\n    All things that love the sun are out of doors;\r\n    The sky rejoices in the morning’s birth;\r\n    The grass is bright with rain-drops;--on the moors\r\n    The hare is running races in her mirth;\r\n    And with her feet she from the plashy earth\r\n    Raises a mist, that, glittering in the sun,\r\n    Runs with her all the way, wherever she doth run.\r\n\r\n(2) This personal dealing with Nature in all her moods produces a joy,\r\na plenteousness of delight, that to most readers is Wordsworth’s most\r\nappealing charm. Before the beauty of nature he is never paltry; he is\r\nnearly always adequate; and that is perhaps the highest achievement\r\nthat he ever desired. The extracts just quoted are outstanding examples\r\nof this aspect of his poetry.\r\n\r\n(3) In his treatment of nature, however, he is not content merely to\r\nrejoice: he tries to see more deeply and to find the secret springs of\r\nthis joy and thanksgiving. He says:\r\n\r\n    To me the meanest flower that blows can give\r\n    Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.\r\n\r\nHe strives to capture and embody in words such deep-seated emotions,\r\nbut, almost of necessity, from the very nature of the case, with little\r\nsuccess. He gropes in the shadows, and comes away with empty hands. He\r\ncannot solve the riddle of\r\n\r\n              those obstinate questionings\r\n    Of sense and outward things,\r\n    Fallings from us, vanishings.\r\n\r\nYet, with a remarkable fusion of sustained thought and of poetic\r\nimagination, he does convey the idea of “the Being that is in the\r\nclouds and air,” the soul that penetrates all things, the spirit,\r\nthe mystical essence, the divine knowledge that, as far as he was\r\nconcerned, lies behind all nature. Lastly, in one of the most exalted\r\npoetical efforts in any language, he puts into words the idea of the\r\ncontinuity of life that runs through all existence:\r\n\r\n    Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:\r\n    The Soul that rises with us, our life’s Star,\r\n      Hath had elsewhere its setting,\r\n        And cometh from afar;\r\n      Not in entire forgetfulness,\r\n      And not in utter nakedness,\r\n    But trailing clouds of glory do we come\r\n      From God, who is our home.\r\n                    _Ode: Intimations of Immortality_\r\n\r\n(_e_) In _style_ Wordsworth presents a remarkable contrast, for\r\nhe ranges from the sublime (as in the extract last quoted) to the\r\nridiculous:\r\n\r\n    In the sweet shire of Cardigan,\r\n    Not far from pleasant Ivor-hall,\r\n    An old Man dwells, a little man,--\r\n    ’Tis said he once was tall.\r\n    Full five-and-thirty years he lived\r\n    A running huntsman merry;\r\n    And still the centre of his cheek\r\n    Is red as a ripe cherry.\r\n                               _Simon Lee_\r\n\r\nThis verse illustrates the lower ranges of his style, when he is\r\nhag-ridden with his theories of poetic diction. The first two lines\r\nare mediocre; the second pair are absurd; and the rest of the verse\r\nis middling. This is simplicity overdone; yet it is always to be\r\nremembered that at his best Wordsworth can unite simplicity with\r\nsublimity, as he does in the lyrics we have already quoted. He has\r\na kind of middle style; at its best it has grace and dignity, a\r\nheart-searching simplicity, and a certain magical enlightenment\r\nof phrase that is all his own. Not Shakespeare himself can better\r\nWordsworth when the latter is in a mood that produces a poem like the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n    “She shall be sportive as the fawn\r\n    That wild with glee across the lawn,\r\n    Or up the mountain springs;\r\n    And hers shall be the breathing balm,\r\n    And hers the silence and the calm,\r\n    Of mute insensate things.\r\n\r\n    “The floating clouds their state shall lend\r\n    To her; for her the willow bend;\r\n    Nor shall she fail to see\r\n    Even in the motions of the Storm\r\n    Grace that shall mould the Maiden’s form\r\n    By silent sympathy.\r\n\r\n    “The stars of midnight shall be dear\r\n    To her; and she shall lean her ear\r\n    In many a secret place\r\n    Where rivulets dance their wayward round,\r\n    And beauty born of murmuring sound\r\n    Shall pass into her face.”\r\n                       _The Education of Nature_\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE (1772–1834)\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= Coleridge was born in Devonshire, and was the youngest\r\nof the thirteen children of the vicar of Ottery St. Mary. As a child\r\nhe was unusually precocious: “I never thought as a child,” he says,\r\n“never had the language of a child.” When he was nine years old his\r\nfather died, and then at the age of ten he obtained a place in Christ’s\r\nHospital, where he astonished his schoolmates, one of whom was Charles\r\nLamb, with his queer tastes in reading and speculation. He went to\r\nCambridge (1791), where he was fired with the revolutionary doctrines.\r\nHe abandoned the university and enlisted in the Light Dragoons, but a\r\nfew months as a soldier ended his military career. In 1794 he returned\r\nto Cambridge, and later in the year became acquainted at Oxford with\r\nSouthey, with whom he planned the founding of an ideal republic in\r\nAmerica. With Southey he lived for a space at Bristol, and there he\r\nmet Southey’s wife’s sister, whom he eventually married. At Bristol\r\nColeridge lectured, wrote poetry, and issued a newspaper called _The\r\nWatchman_, all with the idea of converting humanity; yet in spite of\r\nit all humanity remained unperturbed in its original sin. At this time\r\n(1797) he met Wordsworth, and, as has already been noticed, planned\r\ntheir joint production of the _Lyrical Ballads_, which was published at\r\nBristol.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief spell as a Unitarian minister, Coleridge, who was now\r\ndependent on a small annuity from two rich friends, studied German\r\nphilosophy on the Continent; returned to England (1799), and for a\r\ntime lived in the Lake District; tried journalism and lecturing; and\r\nin general pursued a restless and unhappy existence. As a writer and\r\nlecturer he was already failing, and failing fast. His work languished,\r\nand his ability and energy were relaxed. The cause of this early\r\ndecline lay in his habit of opium-taking, which was now apparently\r\npast mending. He parted from his wife and children, leaving them to\r\nthe charity of his friends. Till 1816 he drifted about in London, a\r\nmoral and physical wreck, his rare genius revealing itself only in\r\nfitful gleams. In 1816, after repeated efforts to rid himself of the\r\nfoul fiend that would not let him be, he entered the house of a Mr.\r\nGillman, in Highgate. This provided for him a kind of refined and\r\nsympathetic inebriates’ home. Here he gradually shook himself free from\r\nopium-taking, and he spent the last years of his life in an atmosphere\r\nof subdued content, visited by his friends, and conversing interminably\r\nin that manner of wandering but luminous intelligence that marked his\r\nlater years. From the house in Highgate he issued a few books that,\r\nwith all their faults, are among the best of their class.\r\n\r\n=2. His Poetry.= The real blossoming of Coleridge’s poetical genius\r\nwas brief indeed, but the fruit of it was rich and wonderful. With the\r\nexception of a very few pieces, the best of his poems were composed\r\nwithin two years, 1797–98.\r\n\r\nHis first book was _Poems on Various Subjects_ (1797), issued at\r\nBristol. The miscellaneous poems that the volume contains have only\r\na very moderate merit. Then, in collaboration with Wordsworth, he\r\nproduced the _Lyrical Ballads_. This remarkable volume contains\r\nnineteen poems by Wordsworth and four by Coleridge; and of these four\r\nby far the most noteworthy is _The Rime of the Ancient Mariner_.\r\n\r\nWordsworth has set on record the origin of the _Ancient Mariner_.\r\nHe and Coleridge discussed the poem during their walks on the Quantock\r\nHills. The main idea of the voyage, founded on a dream of his own,\r\nwas Coleridge’s; Wordsworth suggested details, and they thought of\r\nworking on it together. Very soon, however, Coleridge’s imagination was\r\nfired with the story, and his friend very sensibly left him to write\r\nit all. Hence we have that marvelous series of dissolving pictures,\r\nso curiously distinct and yet so strangely fused into one: the voyage\r\nthrough the polar ice; the death of the albatross; the amazing scenes\r\nduring the calm and the storm; and the return home. In style, in swift\r\nstealthiness of narrative speed, and in its weird and compelling\r\nstrength of imagination the poem is without a parallel.\r\n\r\nIn 1797 Coleridge also wrote _Christabel_ and _Kubla Khan_. Both\r\nof these poems remained unfinished, and lay unpublished till 1816.\r\n_Christabel_ is the tale of a kind of vampire which, by taking the\r\nshape of a lovely lady, wins the confidence of the heroine Christabel.\r\nThe tale is barely begun when it collapses. Already Coleridge’s fatal\r\nindecision is declaring itself. The poem is long enough, however, to\r\nshow us Coleridge’s superlative power as a poet. There are passages\r\nof wonderful beauty and of charming natural description, though they\r\nscarcely reach the heights of the _Ancient Mariner_. The meter, now\r\nknown as the _Christabel_ meter, is a loose but exceedingly melodious\r\nform of the octosyllabic couplet. It became exceedingly popular, and\r\nits influence is still unimpaired. We give a brief extract to show the\r\nmeter, and also to give a slight idea of the poet’s descriptive power:\r\n\r\n    There is not wind enough to twirl\r\n    The one red leaf, the last of its clan,\r\n    That dances as often as dance it can,\r\n    Hanging so light, and hanging so high,\r\n    On the topmost twig that looks up at the sky.\r\n\r\n_Kubla Khan_ is the echo of a dream--the shadow of a shadow. Coleridge\r\navers that he dreamt the lines, awoke in a fever of inspiration,\r\nthrew the words on paper, but before the fit was over was distracted\r\nfrom the composition, so that the glory of the dream never returned\r\nand _Kubla Khan_ remained unfinished. The poem, beginning with a\r\ndescription of the stately pleasure-dome built by Kubla Khan in Xanadu,\r\nsoon becomes a dreamlike series of dissolving views, grows wilder\r\nand wilder into a dervish-dance of the imagination, and collapses in\r\nmid-career.\r\n\r\nIn the same year Coleridge composed several other poems, including\r\nthe fine _Frost at Midnight_, _Love_, and the _Ode to France_. In\r\n1802 he wrote the great ode _Dejection_, in which he already bewails\r\nthe suspension of his “shaping spirit of Imagination.” Save for a few\r\nfragments, such as the beautiful epitaph _The Knight’s Tomb_, the\r\nremainder of his poems are of poorer quality and slight in bulk. His\r\nplay _Remorse_ was, on the recommendation of Byron, accepted by the\r\nmanagement of the Drury Lane Theatre and produced in 1813. It succeeded\r\non the stage, but as literature it is of little importance.\r\n\r\n=3. Features of his Poetry.= Within its peculiar limits his poetical\r\nwork, slight though it is, is of the highest.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The most conspicuous feature of the poems is their intense\r\n_imaginative power_. Sometimes this riots into excess. It exploits\r\nthe weird, the supernatural, and the obscure. Yet, such is the power\r\nof true imagination, it can produce what Coleridge calls “that\r\nwilling suspension of disbelief,” and for the moment he can compel us\r\nto believe it all. He sees nature with a penetrating and revealing\r\nglance, drawing from it inspiration for the stuff of his poetry. He is\r\nparticularly fine in his descriptions of the sky and the sea and the\r\nwider and more remote aspects of things.\r\n\r\n(_b_) No poet has ever excelled Coleridge in _witchery of language_.\r\nHis is the song the sirens sang. The _Ancient Mariner_ has more than\r\none passage like the following:\r\n\r\n    And now ’twas like all instruments,\r\n    Now like a lonely flute;\r\n    And now it is an angel’s song,\r\n    That makes the heavens be mute.\r\n    It ceased; yet still the sails made on\r\n    A pleasant noise till noon,\r\n    A noise like of a hidden brook\r\n    In the leafy month of June,\r\n    That to the sleeping woods all night\r\n    Singeth a quiet tune.\r\n\r\nThe epitaph we have mentioned is another fine example:\r\n\r\n    Where is the grave of Sir Arthur O’Kellyn?\r\n    Where may the grave of that good man be?\r\n    By the side of a spring, on the breast of Helvellyn,\r\n    Under the twigs of a young birch tree.\r\n    The oak that in summer was sweet to hear,\r\n    And rustled its leaves in the fall of the year,\r\n    And whistled and roared in the winter alone,\r\n    Is gone,--and the birch in its stead is grown.--\r\n    The knight’s bones are dust,\r\n    And his good sword rust:--\r\n    His soul is with the saints, I trust.\r\n\r\nThe reader of such passages can discover something of the secret of\r\ntheir charm by observing the dexterous handling of the meter, the\r\nvowel-music, and other technical features, but in the last analysis\r\ntheir beauty defies explanation: it is there that genius lies.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Along with his explosive fervor Coleridge preserves a fine\r\n_simplicity of diction_. He appeals directly to the reader’s\r\nimagination by writing with great clearness. In this respect he\r\noften closely resembles Wordsworth. His meditative poem _Frost at\r\nMidnight_ strongly shows this resemblance:\r\n\r\n      Therefore all seasons shall be sweet to thee,\r\n    Whether the summer clothe the general earth\r\n    With greenness, or the redbreast sit and sing\r\n    Betwixt the tufts of snow on the bare branch\r\n    Of mossy apple-tree, while the nigh thatch\r\n    Smokes in the sun-thaw; whether the eave-drops fall\r\n    Heard only in the trances of the blast,\r\n    Or if the secret ministry of frost\r\n    Shall hang them up in silent icicles,\r\n    Quietly shining to the quiet moon.\r\n\r\n=4. His Prose.= The same blight that afflicted Coleridge’s poetry\r\nlies upon his prose. It is scrappy, chaotic, and tentative. In bulk it\r\nis large and sprawling; in manner it is diffuse and involved; but in\r\nits happier moments it possesses a breadth, a depth, and a searching\r\nwisdom that are as rare as they are admirable.\r\n\r\nMost of his prose was of journalistic origin. In theme it is chiefly\r\nphilosophical or literary. In 1796 he started _The Watchman_, a\r\nperiodical, ambitious in scope, which ran to ten numbers only. To\r\nthis journal Coleridge contributed some typical essays, which, among\r\nmuch that is both obscure and formless, show considerable weight and\r\nacuteness of thought. He followed with much more miscellaneous prose,\r\nsome of it being written for _The Morning Post_, to which he was for\r\na time a contributor. In 1808 he began a series of lectures on poetry\r\nand allied subjects, but already the curse of opium was upon him, and\r\nthe lectures were failures. While he resided in the Lake District\r\nhe started _The Friend_ (1809), which was published at Penrith, but\r\nlike _The Watchman_ it had a brief career. Then in 1817, when he had\r\nshaken himself free from opium, he published _Biographia Literaria_ and\r\n_Sibylline Leaves_.\r\n\r\n_Biographia Literaria_ is his most valuable prose work. It pretends\r\nto record his literary upbringing, but as a consecutive narrative it\r\nis quite worthless. After sixteen chapters of philosophizing, almost\r\nentirely irrelevant, he discusses the poetical theory of his friend\r\nWordsworth, and then in the last seven chapters of the book he gives\r\na remarkable demonstration of his critical powers. He analyzes the\r\nWordsworthian theory in masterly fashion, and, separating the good from\r\nthe bad, upon the sounder elements bases a critical dogma of great and\r\npermanent value. These last chapters of the book, which are the most\r\nenduring exposition of the Romantic theory as it exists in English,\r\nplace Coleridge in the first flight of critics.\r\n\r\nIn addition, he gave another series of lectures (1818), and wrote\r\n(1825) _Aids to Reflection_. But he seemed to be incapable of writing\r\na work of any size. After his death his _Table Talk_ was published,\r\ngiving fleeting glimpses of a brilliant and erratic mind.\r\n\r\nWe give a short extract from his prose. This shows not only his sincere\r\nand temperate admiration for the poems of Wordsworth, but also the\r\nnature of his prose style. As a style it is not wholly commendable. It\r\nis too involved, and clogged with qualifications and digressions; but,\r\nthough he develops his ideas in a curious indirect fashion, he makes\r\nrapid progress.\r\n\r\n   Had Mr Wordsworth’s poems been the silly, the childish things,\r\n   which they were for a long time described as being; had they\r\n   been really distinguished from the compositions of other poets\r\n   merely by meanness of language and inanity of thought; had they\r\n   indeed contained nothing more than what is found in the parodies\r\n   and pretended imitations of them; they must have sunk at once,\r\n   a dead weight, into the slough of oblivion, and have dragged\r\n   the preface along with them. But year after year increased the\r\n   number of Mr Wordsworth’s admirers. They were found, too, not\r\n   in the lower classes of the reading public, but chiefly among\r\n   young men of strong sensibility and meditative minds; and their\r\n   admiration (inflamed perhaps in some degree by opposition) was\r\n   distinguished by its intensity, I might almost say, by its\r\n   _religious_ fervour. These facts, and the intellectual\r\n   energy of the author, which was more or less consciously felt,\r\n   where it was outwardly and even boisterously denied, meeting\r\n   with sentiments of aversion to his opinions, and of alarm at\r\n   their consequences, produced an eddy of criticism, which would\r\n   of itself have borne up the poems by the violence with which it\r\n   whirled them round and round. With many parts of this preface,\r\n   in the sense attributed to them, and which the words undoubtedly\r\n   seem to authorise, I never concurred; but on the contrary\r\n   objected to them as erroneous in principle, and as contradictory\r\n   (in appearance at least) both to other parts of the same\r\n   preface, and to the author’s own practice in the greater number\r\n   of the poems themselves. Mr Wordsworth in his recent collection\r\n   has, I find, degraded this prefatory disquisition to the end of\r\n   his second volume, to be read or not at the reader’s choice. But\r\n   he has not, as far as I can discover, announced any change in\r\n   his poetic creed.\r\n                                            _Biographia Literaria_\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD BYRON (1788–1824)\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= George Gordon Byron, sixth Lord Byron, was as proud\r\nof his ancestry as he was of his poetry, and his ancestors were as\r\nextraordinary as was his poetry. They stretched back to the Norman\r\nConquest, and included among them a notorious admiral, Byron’s\r\ngrandfather. The poet’s father was a rake and a scoundrel. He married\r\na Scottish heiress, Miss Gordon of Gight, whose money he was not long\r\nin squandering. Though the poet was born in London, his early years\r\nwere passed in Aberdeen, his mother’s native place. At the age of ten\r\nhe succeeded his grand-uncle in the title and in the possession of\r\nthe ruinous Abbey of Newstead, and Scotland was left behind for ever.\r\nHe was educated at Harrow and Cambridge, where he showed himself to\r\nbe heir to the ancestral nature, dark and passionate, but relieved by\r\nhumor and affection. All his life through Byron cultivated the somber\r\nand theatrical side of his disposition, which latterly became a byword;\r\nbut there can be little doubt that his “Byronic” temperament was not\r\nentirely affected. His mother, a foolish, unbalanced woman, warped\r\nthe boy’s temper still more by her frequent follies and frenzies. The\r\nrecollection of the tortures he underwent in the fruitless effort to\r\ncure him of a malformity of his foot remained with him till his death.\r\n\r\nLeaving the university (1807), he remained for a while at Newstead,\r\nwhere with a few congenial youths he plunged into orgies of puerile\r\ndissipation. In the fashion of the time, he gloried in the reputation\r\nhe was acquiring for being a dare-devil, but he lived to pay for it.\r\nWearying of loose delights, he traveled for a couple of years upon the\r\nContinent. He had previously taken his seat in the House of Lords, but\r\nmade no mark in political affairs.\r\n\r\nThen with a sudden bound he leaped into the limelight. His poem on his\r\ntravels became all the rage. He found himself the darling of society,\r\nin which his youth, his title, his physical beauty, his wit, and his\r\npicturesque and romantic melancholy made him a marvel and a delight.\r\nHe married a great heiress (1814), but after a year his wife left him,\r\nfor reasons that were not publicly divulged. Regarding his conduct dark\r\nrumors grew apace; his popularity waned, and in the face of a storm\r\nof abuse he left England for good (1816). For the last eight years of\r\nhis life he wandered about the Continent, visiting Italy, and there\r\nmeeting Shelley. Finally the cause of Greek independence caught his\r\nfancy. He devoted his money, which was inconsiderable, and the weight\r\nof his name, which was gigantic, to the Greeks, who proved to be very\r\nungrateful allies. He died of fever at Missolonghi, and his body was\r\ngiven a grand funeral in the England that had cast him out.\r\n\r\n=2. His Poetry.= Byron’s first volume was a juvenile effort, _Hours\r\nof Idleness_ (1807), which was little more than the elegant trifling\r\nof a lord who condescends to be a minor poet. This frail production\r\nwas roughly handled by _The Edinburgh Review_, and Byron, who never\r\nlacked spirit, retorted with some effect. He composed a satire in the\r\nstyle of Pope, calling it _English Bards and Scotch Reviewers_ (1809).\r\nThe poem is immature, being often crudely expressed, and it throws\r\nabuse recklessly upon good writers and bad; but in the handling of\r\nthe couplet it already shows some of the Byronic force and pungency.\r\nThe poem is also of interest in that it lets us see how much he is\r\ninfluenced by the preceding age.\r\n\r\n      Next view in state, proud prancing on his roan,\r\n    The golden-crested haughty Marmion,\r\n    Now forging scrolls, now foremost in the fight,\r\n    Not quite a felon, yet but half a knight,\r\n    The gibbet or the field prepared to grace;\r\n    A mighty mixture of the great and base.\r\n    And think’st thou, Scott! by vain conceit perchance,\r\n    On public taste to foist thy stale romance,\r\n    Though Murray with his Miller may combine\r\n    To yield thy muse just half-a-crown per line?\r\n\r\nThen followed the two years of travel, which had their fruit in the\r\nfirst two cantos of _Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage_ (1812). The hero\r\nof the poem is a romantic youth, and is very clearly Byron himself.\r\nHe is very grand and terrible, and sinister with the stain of a dark\r\nand awful past. He visits some of the popular beauty-spots of the\r\nContinent, which he describes in Spenserian stanzas of moderate skill\r\nand attractiveness. The poem is diffuse, but sometimes it can be terse\r\nand energetic; the style is halfheartedly old-fashioned, in deference\r\nto the stanza. Byron is to do much better things, but already he shows\r\na real appreciation of nature, and considerable dexterity in the\r\nhandling of his meter.\r\n\r\n      On, on the vessel flies, the land is gone,\r\n      And winds are rude in Biscay’s sleepless bay.\r\n      Four days are sped, but with the fifth, anon,\r\n      New shores descried make every bosom gay;\r\n      And Cintra’s mountain greets them on their way,\r\n      And Tagus dashing onward to the deep,\r\n      His fabled golden tribute bent to pay;\r\n      And soon on board the Lusian pilots leap.\r\n    And steer ’twixt fertile shores where yet few rustics reap.\r\n\r\n_Childe Harold_ brought its author a dower of fame, which in the next\r\nfew years he was to squander to the uttermost. In the intervals of\r\nsociety functions he produced poetic tales in astonishing profusion:\r\n_The Giaour_ and _The Bride of Abydos_ in 1813, _The Corsair_ and\r\n_Lara_ in 1814, _The Siege of Corinth_ and _Parisina_ in 1815. These\r\ntales deal with the romantic scenes of the East; they almost uniformly\r\nreproduce the young Byronic hero of _Childe Harold_; and to a great\r\nextent they are mannered and stagy. Written in the couplet form, the\r\nverse is founded on that of the metrical tales of Scott, whom Byron was\r\nnot long in supplanting in popular favor, although the masculine fervor\r\nof Scott’s poems is lacking from his work. In sentiment his lines are\r\noften sickly enough, yet they sometimes have a vehemence that might be\r\nmistaken for passion, and a tawdriness that imitates real beauty.\r\n\r\nIn 1816 Byron was hounded out of England, and his wanderings are\r\nchronicled in the third (1816) and fourth (1817) cantos of _Childe\r\nHarold’s Pilgrimage_. In meter and general scheme the poem is\r\nunaltered, but in spirit and style the new parts are very different\r\nfrom the first two cantos. The descriptions are firmer and terser, and\r\nare often graced with a fine simplicity; the old-fashioned mannerisms\r\nare entirely discarded; and the tone all through is deeper and more\r\nsincere. There is apparent an undercurrent of bitter pessimism that is\r\nonly natural under the circumstances, though he dwells too lengthily\r\nupon his misfortunes. The following stanza is a fair specimen of this\r\nlater and simpler style:\r\n\r\n      They keep his dust in Arqua, where he died;\r\n      The mountain village where his latter days\r\n      Went down the vale of years, and ’tis their pride--\r\n      An honest pride--and let it be their praise,\r\n      To offer to the passing stranger’s gaze\r\n      His mansion and his sepulchre; both plain\r\n      And venerably simple, such as raise\r\n      A feeling more accordant with his strain\r\n    Than if a pyramid formed his monumental fane.\r\n\r\nDuring these years on the Continent he was not idle. Some of his longer\r\npoems are _The Prisoner of Chillon_ (1816) and _Mazeppa_ (1819), the\r\nlast of his metrical tales. He also composed a large number of lyrics,\r\nmost of them only mediocre in quality; and he added several great\r\nsatirical poems, the most notable of which are _Beppo_ (1818), _The\r\nVision of Judgment_ (1822), directed mainly against Southey, and, the\r\nlongest of all, _Don Juan_.\r\n\r\nIn range, in vigor, and in effectiveness _Don Juan_ ranks as one of\r\nthe greatest of satirical poems. It was issued in portions during the\r\nyears 1819–24, just as Byron composed it. It is a kind of picaresque\r\nnovel cast into verse. The hero, like that of the picaresque novel,\r\nhas many wanderings and adventures, the narration of which might go\r\non interminably. At the time of its publication it was denounced by a\r\nshocked world as vile and immoral, and to a great extent it deserves\r\nthe censure. In it Byron expresses the wrath that consumes him, and\r\nall the human race comes under the lash. The strength and flexibility\r\nof the satire are beyond question, and are freely revealed in bitter\r\nmockery, in caustic comment, and in burning rage. The stanzas, written\r\nin _ottava rima_, are as keen and supple as a tempered steel blade.\r\nThe style is a kind of sublimated, half-colloquial prose, showing a\r\ndisdainful abrogation of the finer poetical trappings; but in places it\r\nrises into passages of rare and lovely tenderness. When affliction came\r\nupon him, in the words of Lear he had vowed a vow:\r\n\r\n                          No, I’ll not weep;\r\n    I have full cause of weeping, but this heart\r\n    Will break into a hundred thousand flaws\r\n    Or ere I’ll weep.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes the poet prevails over the satirist, and the mocking\r\nlaughter is stifled with the sound of bitter weeping.\r\n\r\nThe first extract given below shows Byron in his bitter and cynical\r\nmood; the tone of the second and third is far removed from such\r\nasperity:\r\n\r\n    (1) Ovid’s a rake, as half his verses show him,\r\n          Anacreon’s morals are a still worse sample,\r\n        Catullus scarcely has a decent poem,\r\n          I don’t think Sappho’s Ode a good example,\r\n        Although Longinus tells us there is no hymn\r\n          Where the sublime soars forth on wings more ample;\r\n        But Virgil’s songs are pure, except that horrid one\r\n        Beginning with “Formosum Pastor Corydon.”\r\n\r\n        Lucretius’ irreligion is too strong\r\n          For early stomachs to prove wholesome food;\r\n        I can’t help thinking Juvenal was wrong,\r\n          Although no doubt his real intent was good,\r\n        For speaking out so plainly in his song,\r\n          So much indeed as to be downright rude;\r\n        And then what proper person can be partial\r\n        To all those nauseous epigrams of Martial?\r\n\r\n    (2) Round her she made an atmosphere of life;\r\n          The very air seemed lighter from her eyes,\r\n        They were so soft and beautiful, and rife\r\n          With all we can imagine of the skies,\r\n        As pure as Psyche ere she grew a wife--\r\n          Too pure even for the purest human ties;\r\n        Her overpowering presence made you feel\r\n        It would not be idolatry to kneel.\r\n\r\n        Her eyelashes, though dark as night, were tinged--\r\n          It is the country’s custom--but in vain;\r\n        For those large black eyes were so blackly fringed,\r\n          The glossy rebels mocked the jetty stain,\r\n        And in her native beauty stood avenged:\r\n          Her nails were touched with henna; but again\r\n        The power of art was turned to nothing, for\r\n        They could not look more rosy than before.\r\n\r\n    (3) Thus lived--thus died she; never more on her\r\n          Shall sorrow light or shame. She was not made\r\n        Through years or moons the inner weight to bear,\r\n          Which colder hearts endure till they are laid\r\n        By age in earth: her days and pleasures were\r\n          Brief, but delightful--such as had not stayed\r\n        Long with her destiny; but she sleeps well\r\n        By the sea-shore whereon she loved to dwell.\r\n\r\n        That isle is now all desolate and bare,\r\n          Its dwelling down, its tenants passed away;\r\n        None but her own and father’s grave is there\r\n          And nothing outward tells of human clay;\r\n        Ye could not know where lies a thing so fair;\r\n          No one is there to show, no tongue to say\r\n        What was; no dirge except the hollow seas\r\n        Mourns o’er the beauty of the Cyclades.\r\n\r\n=3. His Drama.= Byron’s dramas are all blank-verse tragedies that were\r\ncomposed during the later stages of his career, when he was in Italy.\r\nThe chief are _Manfred_ (1817), _Marino Faliero_ (1820), _The Two\r\nFoscari_ and _Cain_ (1821), and _The Deformed Transformed_ (1824). In\r\nnearly all we have a hero of the Byronic type. In _Cain_, for example,\r\nwe have the outcast who defies the censure of the world; in _The\r\nDeformed Transformed_ there are thinly screened references to Byron’s\r\nown deformity. In this fashion he showed that he had little of the real\r\ndramatic faculty, for he could portray no character with any zeal\r\nunless it resembled himself. The blank verse has power and dignity, but\r\nit lacks the higher poetic inspiration.\r\n\r\n=4. Features of his Poetry.= (_a_) For a man of his egotistical temper\r\nByron’s _lyrical gift_ is disappointingly meager. He wrote many tuneful\r\nand readable lyrics, such as _She walks in Beauty_ and _To Thyrza_. His\r\nfavorite theme draws on variations of the following mood:\r\n\r\n    Do thou, amid the fair white walls,\r\n      If Cadiz still be free,\r\n    At times, from out her latticed halls,\r\n      Look o’er the dark blue sea;\r\n\r\n    Then think upon Calypso’s isles,\r\n      Endeared by days gone by;\r\n    To others give a thousand smiles,\r\n      To me a single sigh.\r\n\r\nIn such lyrics he is merely sentimental, and the reader cannot avoid\r\nthinking that he is posturing before the world. When he attempts more\r\nelevated themes, as he does in _The Isles of Greece_, he is little\r\nbetter than a poetical tub-thumper. Of the genuine passionate lyric\r\nthere is little trace in his poems.\r\n\r\n(_b_) His _satirical power_ is gigantic. In the expression of his\r\nscorn, a kind of sublime and reckless arrogance, he has the touch\r\nof the master. Yet in spite of his genius he has several defects.\r\nIn the first place, his motive is to a very large extent personal,\r\nand so his scorn becomes one-sided. It is, however, a sign of the\r\nessential bigness of his mind that he hardly ever becomes mean and\r\nspiteful. Secondly, he lacks the deep vision of the supreme satirist,\r\nlike Cervantes, who behind the shadows of the crimes and follies\r\nof men can see the pity of it all. In the third place, he is often\r\ndeliberately outrageous. When he found how easily and deeply he could\r\nshock a certain class of people he went out of his way to shock them,\r\nand succeeded only too well. No doubt this satisfied Byron’s injured\r\nfeelings, but it is a rather cheap and juvenile proceeding, and\r\ndetracts from the solid value of his work.\r\n\r\n(_c_) He treats _nature_ in a rather lordly fashion, more as a humble\r\nhelper in his poems than as a light and inspiration. In his later poems\r\nhe agreeably modified this attitude; and his passion for the sea never\r\npaled.\r\n\r\n(_d_) His _style_ has been sufficiently revealed in the extracts we\r\nhave given. He could modulate it with great skill to the purpose in\r\nhand. Dignified in his dramas, melodious in his songs, vigorous in his\r\nnarratives, and stinging in his satires, he is hardly ever dull, seldom\r\nobscure, and always the master of his medium.\r\n\r\n(_e_) A word is necessary regarding the fluctuations of his\r\n_reputation_. In his earlier manhood he was reckoned among the great\r\npoets; he lived to hear himself denounced, and his poetry belittled.\r\nAfter his death Victorian morality held up hands in horror over his\r\niniquity, and his real merits were steadily decried. Since those days\r\nhis reputation has been climbing back to take a stable position high\r\nabove the second-rate poets. In some European countries he still\r\nranks second to none among English poets. He broke down the labored\r\ninsularity of the English, and he gave to non-English readers a clear\r\nand forcible example of what the English language can accomplish.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY (1792–1822)\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= Shelley was born in Sussex, the heir to a baronetcy\r\nand a great fortune. He was educated at Eton and Oxford, but from a\r\nvery early age showed great eccentricity of character. He frequented\r\ngraveyards, studied alchemy, and read books of dreadful import. While\r\nhe was at the university he wrote several extraordinary pamphlets, one\r\nof which, _The Necessity of Atheism_, caused him to be expelled from\r\nOxford. He had already developed extreme notions on religion, politics,\r\nand morality generally, a violence that was entirely theoretical, for\r\nby nature he was among the most unselfish and amiable of mankind.\r\nHis opinions, as well as an early and unhappy marriage which he\r\ncontracted, brought about a painful quarrel with his relatives. This\r\nwas finally composed by the poet’s father, Sir Timothy Shelley, who\r\nsettled an annuity upon his son. The poet immediately took to the life\r\nthat suited him best, ardently devoting himself to his writing, and\r\nwandering where the spirit led him. In 1816 his first wife committed\r\nsuicide; and Shelley, having married the daughter of William Godwin,\r\nsettled in Italy, the land he loved the best. The intoxication of\r\nRome’s blue sky and the delicious unrestraint of his Italian existence\r\nset his genius blossoming into the rarest beauty. In the full flower\r\nof it he was drowned, when he was only thirty years old, in a sudden\r\nsquall that overtook his yacht in the Gulf of Spezzia. His body--a fit\r\nconsummation--was burned on the beach where it was found, and his ashes\r\nwere laid beside those of Keats in the Roman cemetery that he had nobly\r\nhymned. It is impossible to estimate the loss to literature that was\r\ncaused by his early extinction. The crudeness of his earlier opinions\r\nwas passing away, his vision was gaining immeasurably in clearness and\r\nintensity, and his singing-robes seemed to be developing almost into\r\nseraph’s wings. In his case the grave can indeed claim a victory.\r\n\r\n=2. His Poetry.= His earliest effort of any note is _Queen Mab_ (1813).\r\nThe poem is clearly immature; it is lengthy, and contains much of\r\nShelley’s cruder atheism. It is written in the irregular unrhymed meter\r\nthat was made popular by Southey. The beginning is worth quoting, for\r\nalready it reveals a touch of the airy music that was to distinguish\r\nhis later work:\r\n\r\n        How wonderful is Death,\r\n        Death and his brother Sleep!\r\n    One, pale as yonder waning moon\r\n        With lips of lurid blue;\r\n    The other, rosy as the morn\r\n        When throned on ocean’s wave\r\n        It blushes o’er the world:\r\n    Yet both so passing wonderful!\r\n\r\n_Alastor, or The Spirit of Solitude_ (1816) followed. It is a kind\r\nof spiritual autobiography. The chief character is a wild youth who\r\nretires into the wilderness and stays there under highly romantic\r\ncircumstances. The poem is too long and formless, and in places the\r\nexpression becomes so wild as to be only a foamy gabble of words. It is\r\nwritten in blank verse that shows Shelley’s growing skill as a poet.\r\nAfter this came _Laon and Cynthia_ (1817), afterward called _The Revolt\r\nof Islam_. It has the fault of its immediate predecessor--lack of grip\r\nand coherence; but it is richer in descriptive passages, and has many\r\noutbursts of rapturous energy.\r\n\r\nThen Shelley left for Italy. The first fruits of his new life were\r\napparent in _Prometheus Unbound_ (1819). This wonderful production\r\nis a combination of the lyric and the drama. The story is that of\r\nPrometheus, who defied the gods and suffered for his presumption.\r\nThere is a small proportion of narrative in blank verse, but the\r\nchief feature of the poem is the series of lyrics that both sustain\r\nand embellish the action. As a whole the poem has a sweep, a soar,\r\nand an unearthly vitality that sometimes staggers the imagination. It\r\nis peopled with spirits and demigods, and its scenes are cast in the\r\ninaccessible spaces of sky, mountain, and sea.\r\n\r\nIn _The Cenci_ (1819) Shelley started to write formal drama. In this\r\nplay he seems deliberately to have set upon himself the restraints\r\nthat he defied in _Prometheus Unbound_. The plot is not of the sky and\r\nthe sea; it is a grim and sordid family affair; in style it is neither\r\nfervent nor ornate, but bleak and austere. Yet behind this reticence of\r\nmanner there is a deep and smoldering intensity of passion and enormous\r\nadequacy of tragic purpose. Many of the poet’s admirers look upon it as\r\nhis masterpiece; and there can be little doubt that, with the exception\r\npossibly of the _Venice Preserved_ of Otway, it is the most powerful\r\ntragedy since the days of Shakespeare. The last words of the play,\r\nwhen the heroine goes to her doom, are almost heart-breaking in their\r\nsimplicity:\r\n\r\n    _Beatrice._ Give yourself no unnecessary pain,\r\n        My dear Lord Cardinal. Here, mother, tie\r\n        My girdle for me, and bind up this hair\r\n        In any simple knot; ay, that does well.\r\n        And yours I see is coming down. How often\r\n        Have we done this for one another! Now\r\n        We shall not do it any more. My lord,\r\n        We are quite ready. Well, ’tis very well.\r\n\r\nThe poems of this period are extraordinary in their number and quality.\r\nAmong the longer ones are _Julian and Maddalo_ (1818) and _The Masque\r\nof Anarchy_ (1819). The latter, inspired by the news of the massacre\r\nof Peterloo, expresses Shelley’s revolutionary political views, and is\r\nvery severe on Lord Castlereagh. The beginning of the poem is startling\r\nenough:\r\n\r\n    I met Murder on the way,\r\n    He had a mask like Castlereagh;\r\n    Very smooth he looked, yet grim,\r\n    Seven bloodhounds followed him.\r\n\r\nIn _The Witch of Atlas_ (1820) and _Epipsychidion_ (1821) Shelley rises\r\nfurther and further into the ether of poetical imagination, until he\r\nbecomes almost impossible of comprehension. _Adonais_ (1821) is a\r\nlament for the death of Keats. In plan the poem is crazily constructed,\r\nbut it glows with some of the most splendid of Shelley’s conceptions:\r\n\r\n      He has outsoared the shadow of our night.\r\n      Envy and calumny and hate and pain,\r\n      And that unrest which men miscall delight,\r\n      Can touch him not and torture not again.\r\n      From the contagion of the world’s slow stain\r\n      He is secure; and now can never mourn\r\n      A heart grown cold, a head grown grey, in vain--\r\n      Nor, when the spirit’s self has ceased to burn,\r\n    With sparkless ashes load an unlamented urn.\r\n\r\n      He lives, he wakes--’tis Death is dead, not he;\r\n      Mourn not for Adonais.--Thou, young Dawn,\r\n      Turn all thy dew to splendour, for from thee\r\n      The spirit thou lamentest is not gone!\r\n      Ye caverns and ye forests, cease to moan!\r\n      Cease, ye faint flowers and fountains; and, thou Air,\r\n      Which like a mourning veil thy scarf hadst thrown\r\n      O’er the abandoned Earth, now leave it bare\r\n    Even to the joyous stars which smile on its despair!\r\n\r\nWith the longer poems went a brilliant cascade of shorter lyrical\r\npieces. To name them is to mention some of the sweetest English lyrics.\r\nThe constantly quoted _Skylark_ and _Cloud_ are among them; so are some\r\nexquisite songs, such as _Lines to an Indian Air_, _Music, when soft\r\nvoices die_, _On a Faded Violet_, _To Night_, and the longer occasional\r\npieces--for example, _Lines written among the Euganean Hills_, and\r\nthe _Letter to Maria Gisborne_. Of his many beautiful odes, the most\r\nremarkable is _To the West Wind_. The stanzas have the elemental rush\r\nof the wind itself, and the conclusion, where Shelley sees a parallel\r\nto himself, is the most remarkable of all:\r\n\r\n    Make me thy lyre, ev’n as the forest is:\r\n    What if my leaves are falling like its own!\r\n    The tumult of thy mighty harmonies\r\n\r\n    Will take from both a deep autumnal tone,\r\n    Sweet though in sadness. Be thou, Spirit fierce,\r\n    My spirit! be thou me, impetuous one!\r\n\r\n    Drive my dead thoughts over the universe,\r\n    Like wither’d leaves, to quicken a new birth;\r\n    And, by the incantation of this verse,\r\n\r\n    Scatter, as from an unextinguish’d hearth\r\n    Ashes and sparks, my words among mankind!\r\n    Be through my lips to unawaken’d earth\r\n\r\n    The trumpet of a prophecy! O Wind,\r\n    If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?\r\n\r\n=3. His Prose.= Shelley began his literary career with two boyish\r\nromances, _Zastrozzi_ and _St. Irvyne_. These books were written when\r\nhe was still at school, and are almost laughably bad in style and\r\nstory. The only other prose work that is worth mention is his short\r\nessay _The Defence of Poetry_. The work is soundly written, and is a\r\nstrong exposition of the Romantic point of view. His published letters\r\nshow him to have been a man of considerable common sense, and not\r\nmerely the crazy theorist of popular imagination. His prose style is\r\nsomewhat heavy, but always clear and readable.\r\n\r\n=4. Features of his Poetry.= (_a_) His _lyrical power_ is equal to\r\nthe highest to be found in any language. It is now recognized to be\r\none of the supreme gifts in literature, like the dramatic genius of\r\nShakespeare. This gift is shown at its best when it expresses the\r\nhighest emotional ecstasy, as in the lyrics of _Prometheus Unbound_.\r\nIt is a sign of his great genius that, in spite of the passion that\r\npervades his lyrics, he is seldom shrill and tuneless. He can also\r\nexpress a mood of blessed cheerfulness, a sane and delectable joy. To\r\nthe Spirit of Delight he says:\r\n\r\n    I love Love, though he has wings,\r\n      And like light can flee,\r\n    But above all other things,\r\n      Spirit, I love thee.\r\n    Thou art love and life! O come,\r\n    Make once more my heart thy home.\r\n\r\nHe can also express the keenest note of depression and despair, as in\r\nthe lyric _O World! O Life! O Time!_\r\n\r\n(_b_) In his _choice of subject_ he differs from such a poet as Burns,\r\nwho is almost the only other poet who challenges him as master of the\r\nlyric. Shelley lacks the homely appeal of Burns; he loves to roam\r\nthrough space and infinity. In his own words he\r\n\r\n    Feeds upon the aerial kisses\r\n    Of shapes that haunt thought’s wildernesses.\r\n\r\nHe rejoices in nature, but nature of a spiritual kind, which he peoples\r\nwith phantoms and airy beings:\r\n\r\n    I love all that thou lovest,\r\n      Spirit of Delight!\r\n    The fresh Earth in new leaves drest,\r\n      And the starry night;\r\n    Autumn evening, and the morn\r\n    When the golden mists are born.\r\n\r\n    I love snow, and all the forms\r\n      Of the radiant frost:\r\n    I love waves, and winds, and storms,\r\n      Everything almost\r\n    Which is nature’s, and may be\r\n    Untainted by man’s misery.\r\n\r\n(_c_) His _descriptive power_ at once strikes the imagination. The\r\neffect is instantaneous. His fancy played among wild and elemental\r\nthings, but it gave them form and substance, as well as a radiant\r\nloveliness. His favorite device for this purpose is personification, of\r\nwhich the following is an excellent example:\r\n\r\n    For Winter came; the wind was his whip;\r\n    One choppy finger was on his lip;\r\n    He had torn the cataracts from the hills,\r\n    And they clanked at his girdle like manacles.\r\n                                 _The Sensitive Plant_\r\n\r\nWe add another extract to show his almost unearthly skill in\r\nvisualizing the wilder aspects of nature. Note the extreme simplicity\r\nand ease of the style:\r\n\r\n    We paused among the pines that stood\r\n      The giants of the waste,\r\n    Tortured by storms to shapes as rude\r\n      As serpents interlaced.\r\n                             _The Pine Forest_\r\n\r\n(_d_) His _style_ is perfectly attuned to his purpose. Like all\r\nthe finest lyrical styles, it is simple, flexible, and passionate.\r\nSometimes, as in _The Cenci_, it rises to a commanding simplicity. The\r\nextracts already given sufficiently show this.\r\n\r\n(_e_) Shelley’s _limitations_ are almost as plain as his great\r\nabilities. His continual rhapsodizings tend to become tedious and\r\nbaffling; in his narrative he is diffuse and argumentative; he lacks\r\nhumor; and his political poetry is often violent and unreasonable.\r\n\r\n(_f_) _His Reputation._ During his lifetime Shelley’s opinions obscured\r\nhis powers as a poet. Even to Scott, who with all his Tory prejudices\r\nwas liberal enough in his views on literature, he was simply “that\r\natheist Shelley.” After his death his reputation rose rapidly, and by\r\nthe middle of the nineteenth century his position was assured. By the\r\ncurious alternation that seems to affect popular taste, his fame since\r\nthat time has paled a little; but no fluctuations in taste can ever\r\nremove him from his place among the great.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN KEATS (1795–1821)\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= Keats was born in London, the son of the well-to-do\r\nkeeper of a livery stable. He was educated at a private school at\r\nEnfield, and at the age of fifteen was apprenticed to a surgeon. In\r\n1814 he transferred his residence to London, and followed part of the\r\nregular course of instruction prescribed for medical students. Already,\r\nhowever, his poetical bent was becoming apparent. Surgery lost its\r\nslight attraction, and the career of a poet became a bright possibility\r\nwhen he made the acquaintance of Leigh Hunt (1815), the famous Radical\r\njournalist and poet, whose collisions with the Government had caused\r\nmuch commotion and his own imprisonment. Keats was soon intimate with\r\nthe Radical brotherhood that surrounded Leigh Hunt, and thus he became\r\nknown to Shelley and others. In 1817 he published his first volume of\r\nverse, but it attracted little notice, in spite of the championship\r\nof Hunt. By this time the family tendency to consumption became\r\npainfully manifest in him, and he spent his time in searching for\r\nplaces, including the Isle of Wight and the suburbs of London, where\r\nhis affliction might be remedied. While he was staying in London he\r\nbecame acquainted with Fanny Brawne, and afterward was engaged to\r\nher for a time. His malady, however, became worse, and the mental and\r\nphysical distress caused by his complaint, added to despair regarding\r\nthe success of his love-affair, produced a frantic state of mind\r\npainfully reflected in his letters to the young lady. These letters\r\nwere foolishly printed (1879), long after the poet’s death.\r\n\r\nHis second volume of verse, published in 1818, was brutally assailed by\r\n_The Quarterly Review_ and (to a lesser degree) by _Blackwood’s\r\nMagazine_. These Tory journals probably struck at him because of\r\nhis friendship with the radical Leigh Hunt. Keats bore the attack with\r\napparent serenity, and always protested that he minded it little; but\r\nthere can be little doubt that it affected his health to some degree.\r\nIn 1820 he was compelled to seek warmer skies, and died in Rome early\r\nin the next year, at the age of twenty-five.\r\n\r\n=2. His Poetry.= When he was about seventeen years old Keats\r\nbecame acquainted with the works of Spenser, and this proved to be\r\nthe turning-point in his life. The mannerisms of the Elizabethan\r\nimmediately captivated him, and he resolved to imitate him. His\r\nearliest attempt at verse is his _Imitation of Spenser_ (1813), written\r\nwhen he was eighteen. This and some other short pieces were published\r\ntogether in his _Poems_ (1817), his first volume of verse. This book\r\ncontains little of any outstanding merit. The different poems, which\r\ninclude the pieces _On Death_, _To Hope_, and _Sleep and Poetry_,\r\nfollow the methods of Shenstone, Gray, and Byron. Of a different\r\nquality was his next volume, which bore the title of _Endymion_ (1818).\r\nProbably based partly on Drayton’s _Man in the Moon_ and Fletcher’s\r\n_Faithful Shepherdess_, this remarkable poem of _Endymion_ professes to\r\ntell the story of the lovely youth who was kissed by the moon-goddess\r\non the summit of Mount Latmos. Keats develops this simple myth into an\r\nintricate and flowery tale of over four thousand lines. The work is\r\nclearly immature, and flawed with many weaknesses both of taste and\r\nof construction, but many of the passages are most beautiful, and\r\nthe poem shows the tender budding of the Keatsian style--a rich and\r\nsuggestive beauty obtained by a richly ornamented diction. The first\r\nline is often quoted, and it contains the theory that Keats followed in\r\na subconscious fashion during most of his poetical career:\r\n\r\n    A thing of beauty is a joy for ever.\r\n\r\nThe crudeness of the work laid it temptingly open to attack, and, as we\r\nhave noticed, the hostile reviews found it an easy prey.\r\n\r\nKeats’s health was already failing, but the amount of poetry he wrote\r\nis marvelous both in magnitude and in quality. His third and last\r\nvolume, published just before he left England, contains a collection of\r\npoems of the first rank, which were written approximately in the order\r\nthat follows.\r\n\r\n_Isabella, or The Pot of Basil_ (1818), is a version of a tale from\r\nBoccaccio, and deals with the murder of a lady’s lover by her two\r\nwicked brothers. The poem, which is written in _ottava rima_, marks\r\na decided advance in Keats’s work. The slips of taste are fewer; the\r\nstyle is richer and deeper in tone; and the conclusion, though it is\r\nsentimentally treated, is not wanting in pathos.\r\n\r\n_The Eve of St. Agnes_ (1818) has for a plot the merest incident\r\ndealing with the elopement of two lovers. The tale is so sumptuously\r\nadorned with the silks and jewels of poetical imagination that it\r\nis almost lost in the decoration. This is sometimes considered his\r\nmasterpiece; it is certainly the most typical of his poems. The\r\nrichness of fancy and pictorial effect mark the summit of the poet’s\r\nart. It is somewhat hectic and overloaded, but its faults are quite\r\nvenial. We add one of its exquisite Spenserian stanzas:\r\n\r\n      Full on this casement shone the wintry moon,\r\n      And threw warm gules on Madeleine’s fair breast,\r\n      As down she knelt for heaven’s grace and boon;\r\n      Rose-bloom fell on her hands, together prest,\r\n      And on her silver cross soft amethyst,\r\n      And on her hair a glory, like a saint:\r\n      She seemed a splendid angel, newly drest,\r\n      Save wings, for heaven:--Porphyro grew faint:\r\n    She knelt, so pure a thing, so free from mortal taint.\r\n\r\n_Hyperion_ (1818) is of a different type. For this poem Keats adopts\r\nblank verse, and for theme he goes to the primeval warfare between\r\nearly deities, such as Saturn and Thea, and younger divinities, such\r\nas Apollo and Minerva. The poem remains unfinished, owing, it is\r\nstated, to the poet’s discouragement over the reception of _Endymion_.\r\nIt is doubtful if Keats could ever have finished it. The scale of the\r\nstory is so gigantic, and the style is pitched at such an altitude of\r\nsublimity that Keats appears to have been lacking in mere physical\r\nfitness to carry it to a conclusion. In the fragment that we have an\r\nobservant reader can see that the poet’s grip is loosening, and his\r\nbreath failing, before the effort ceases entirely. Keats, with his\r\nusual insight, appropriately writes the poem in a style of bleak and\r\nalmost terrible simplicity. The opening lines are among the best:\r\n\r\n    Deep in the shady sadness of a vale,\r\n    Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn,\r\n    Far from the fiery noon, and eve’s one star,\r\n    Sat gray-haired Saturn, quiet as a stone,\r\n    Still as the silence round about his lair;\r\n    Forest on forest hung about his head\r\n    Like cloud on cloud. No stir of air was there,\r\n    Not so much life as on a summer’s day\r\n    Robs not one light seed from the feathered grass,\r\n    But where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest.\r\n    A stream went voiceless by, still deadened more\r\n    By reason of his fallen divinity\r\n    Spreading a shade: the Naiad ’mid her reeds\r\n    Pressed her cold finger closer to her lips.\r\n\r\nNext was written _The Eve of St. Mark_ (1819), which also remains\r\nunfinished. The tale shows how far even Keats can improve upon himself.\r\nIt is adorned with brilliant descriptive passages, and the strokes are\r\nmore dashing than usual. The earlier languor and sentimentality are\r\nalmost eliminated:\r\n\r\n    The bells had ceased, the prayers begun,\r\n    And Bertha had not yet half done\r\n    A curious volume, patched and torn,\r\n    That all day long, from earliest morn,\r\n    Had taken captive her two eyes,\r\n    Among its golden broideries;\r\n    Perplexed her with a thousand things,\r\n    The stars of heaven, and angels’ wings,\r\n    Martyrs in a fiery blaze,\r\n    Azure saints and silver rays,\r\n    Moses’ breastplate, and the seven\r\n    Candlesticks John saw in heaven,\r\n    The winged Lion of St Mark,\r\n    And the Covenantal Ark,\r\n    With its many mysteries,\r\n    Cherubim and golden mice.\r\n\r\nThe story of _Lamia_ (1819) is taken from Burton’s _Anatomy of\r\nMelancholy_, and tells of a beautiful enchantress. It is the weakest of\r\nall the longer poems, and the lapses are more numerous. The language\r\nbecomes mannered and overdone:\r\n\r\n    He answered, bending to her open eyes,\r\n    Where he was mirrored small in paradise,--\r\n    “My silver planet, both of eve and morn!\r\n    Why will you plead yourself so sad forlorn,\r\n    While I am striving how to fill my heart\r\n    With deeper crimson, and a double smart?\r\n    How to entangle, trammel up and snare\r\n    Your soul in mine, and labyrinth you there,\r\n    Like the hid scent in an unbudded rose?”\r\n\r\nIn this passage we observe the strength of Keats running to seed.\r\nPhrases like “plead yourself” and “labyrinth you” go beyond the limits\r\nof poetical license; and the whole passage in conception resembles\r\nthe conceits of the Caroline poets rather than the finer and stronger\r\nflights of imagination of which Keats was so thoroughly capable.\r\n\r\nTogether with the longer poems are many shorter pieces of supreme\r\nbeauty. The great odes--_To a Nightingale_, _On a Grecian Urn_, _To\r\nAutumn_--were nearly all written in 1819. Among the other shorter poems\r\n_La Belle Dame sans Merci_, a kind of lyrical ballad, is considered to\r\nbe one of the choicest in the language.\r\n\r\nIn 1819 Keats collaborated in a drama, _Otho the Great_, and began\r\nanother, _King Stephen_, which he did not complete. Neither effort\r\nis of much consequence. _The Cap and Bells_, a longish fairy-tale\r\nwhich also is unfinished, is much below the level of his usual work.\r\n\r\n=3. Features of his Poetry.= (_a_) His _style_ should be considered\r\nfirst, for Keats is above all a stylist. The typical Keatsian poetry\r\nis, one imagines, the ideal of what is popularly considered to be\r\n“poetry”: it is gorgeously attractive, with its melodic beauty and\r\nsensuous passion; soft and caressing, like velvet; and richly colored\r\nand odorous. At its very best the spell of it works like a divine\r\nenchantment; but at even a little less than the best it becomes\r\nunctuous, sickly, and stuffily uncomfortable. There can be little\r\ndoubt that Keats’s physical malady shows itself in his writings. With\r\nall their genius, they are the work of an unhealthy brain. His heroes\r\nare languid and neurotic creatures, and his style is attuned to their\r\nswoons and faintings. A stanza from _Isabella_ will illustrate what has\r\nalready been exemplified in the verse we have quoted from _The Eve of\r\nSt. Agnes_:\r\n\r\n    So once more had he waked and anguished\r\n      A dreary night of love and misery,\r\n    If Isabel’s quick eye had not been wed\r\n      To every symbol on his forehead high;\r\n    She saw it waxing very pale and dead,\r\n      And straight all flushed; so, lisped tenderly,\r\n    “Lorenzo!”--here she ceased her timid quest,\r\n    But in her tone and look he read the rest.\r\n\r\n(_b_) His _descriptive and romantic quality_ is of the highest. He\r\nmodeled his work upon that of Spenser, but before he had finished\r\nhe almost bettered his model. In beauty and splendor he is nearly\r\nunrivaled. He ranges among classical and medieval subjects, and\r\ndistills from them the essence of their beauty. For example, he knew no\r\nGreek, but he could reproduce the full charm of the Greek seaboard:\r\n\r\n    Who are these coming to the sacrifice?\r\n      To what green altar, O mysterious priest,\r\n    Lead’st thou that heifer lowing at the skies,\r\n      And all her silken flanks with garlands drest?\r\n    What little town by river or sea-shore,\r\n      Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel,\r\n        Is emptied of its folk, this pious morn?\r\n    And, little town, thy streets for evermore\r\n      Will silent be; and not a soul to tell\r\n        Why thou art desolate, can e’er return.\r\n                                      _Ode on a Grecian Urn_\r\n\r\n(_c_) Keats’s _lyrical faculty_ is limited. When brooding over his woes\r\nhe can utter a complaint on the true lyrical note. Hence we obtain\r\nsuch results as his wonderful last sonnet and _La Belle Dame sans\r\nMerci_, which is a lyric thinly disguised as a ballad. He was perhaps\r\nphysically unable to experience the healthier joys of Burns, and so was\r\nincapable of expressing them.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _His Influence._ A single glance at the table at the head of this\r\nchapter will show how piteously short was his poetical career; but,\r\nshort as it was, his labor created a larger school than that of any of\r\nhis contemporaries. His tradition was carried on by Tennyson and the\r\nPre-Raphaelites, and to this day his influence is strong in English\r\npoetry.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER POETS\r\n\r\n=1. Robert Southey (1774–1843).= Southey was born at Bristol,\r\neducated at Westminster School and at Oxford, and settled down to lead\r\nthe laborious life of a man of letters. He produced a great mass of\r\nwork, much of which is of considerable merit, and he ranked as one of\r\nthe leading writers of his age. Most of his work was written at Greta\r\nHall, near Keswick, where he lived most of his life. He was made Poet\r\nLaureate in 1813. His reputation, especially as a poet, has not been\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nHis poems, which are of great bulk, include _Joan of Arc_ (1798),\r\n_Thalaba the Destroyer_ (1801), _The Curse of Kehama_ (1810), and\r\n_Roderick the Goth_ (1814); they are pretentious in style and subject,\r\nbut are now almost forgotten. Some shorter pieces, such as _The\r\nHolly-tree_, _The Battle of Blenheim_, and _The Inchcape Rock_, are\r\nstill in favor, and deservedly so.\r\n\r\nHis numerous prose works include _The History of Brazil_ (1810–19) and\r\n_The Peninsular War_ (1822–33). The slightest of them all, _The Life\r\nof Nelson_ (1813), is the only one now freely read. It shows Southey’s\r\neasy yet scholarly style at its best.\r\n\r\n=2. Walter Savage Landor (1775–1864).= Landor had a long life, for\r\nhe was born five years after Wordsworth, and lived to see the full\r\nyield of the Victorian era. Of an ancient family, he was born in\r\nWarwickshire, and was educated at Rugby and Oxford. Later he was fired\r\nwith republican ideas, abandoned his projected career in the British\r\nArmy, and supported the revolutionaries in Spain. In temper he was\r\nimpulsive to the point of mania; and his life is marked by a succession\r\nof violent quarrels with his friends and enemies. The middle years of\r\nhis life were passed in Italy. He returned to England in 1838, and\r\nlived in Bath until 1858. In this year his pugnacity involved him in an\r\naction for damages, in which as defendant he cut a lamentable figure.\r\nPoor and dishonored, he forsook England, and settled again in Florence,\r\nwhere he died.\r\n\r\nHis _Gebir_ (1798) is a kind of epic poem written in blank verse. It\r\nis “classical” in its stiff and formal style; but it has a stately\r\nbeauty and much powerful natural description. _Count Julian_ (1812),\r\na tragedy, has much the same qualities, good and bad, as _Gebir_. His\r\nshorter pieces, especially the eight-line lyric _Rose Aylmer_, have\r\nmore ease and passion, and are gracefully expressed.\r\n\r\nHis bulkiest prose work is his _Imaginary Conversations_, which was\r\npublished at intervals from 1824 to 1846. The volumes record imaginary\r\ndialogues between all kinds of people on a great variety of subjects.\r\nThey have Landor’s chief defect, a stony lifelessness; but in style\r\nthey are stately, strong, and scholarly, with frequent passages of\r\nnoble description. All his life he continued to issue essays and\r\npamphlets. A collection of them, called _Dry Sticks_ (1858), as has\r\nbeen noticed, brought upon his head the weight of the law. Landor\r\nprofessed to despise popularity; he was moody, crotchety, and often\r\ndeliberately perverse. Posterity has repaid him by consigning him to an\r\noblivion that only the devotion of a small but eminent band of admirers\r\nkeeps from being absolute.\r\n\r\n=3. Thomas Moore (1779–1852).= Moore was born in Dublin, took his\r\ndegree at Trinity College, and studied law in the same city. He too\r\nwas imbued with revolutionary notions, and attempted to apply them to\r\nIreland, but with no success. He obtained a valuable appointment in\r\nthe Bermudas, the duties of which were discharged by a deputy, who in\r\nthis case proved faithless and caused Moore financial loss. Moore was\r\na friend of Byron and a prominent literary figure of the time. Most of\r\nhis life was passed as a successful man of letters.\r\n\r\nHis poems were highly successful during his lifetime, but after his\r\ndeath there was a reaction against them. His _Irish Melodies_ are set\r\nto the traditional musical airs of Ireland. They are graceful, and\r\nadapt themselves admirably to the tunes. Moore, however, lacked the\r\ndepth and far-ranging strength of Burns, and so he failed to do for\r\nIreland what the Ayrshire poet did for Scotland: he did not raise\r\nthe national sentiment of Ireland into one of the precious things of\r\nliterature. His _Lalla Rookh_ (1817) is an Oriental romance, written\r\nin the Scott-Byron manner then so popular. The poem had an immense\r\nsuccess, which has now almost totally faded. It contains an abundance\r\nof florid description, but as poetry it is hardly second-rate. Moore’s\r\npolitical satires, such as _The Twopenny Postbag_ (1813), _The Fudge\r\nFamily in Paris_ (1818), and _Fables for the Holy Alliance_ (1823), are\r\nkeen and lively, and show his Irish wit at its very best.\r\n\r\nHis prose works include his _Life of Byron_ (1830), which has taken\r\nits place as the standard biography of that poet. It is an able and\r\nscholarly piece of work, and is written with much knowledge and\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\n=4. Thomas Campbell (1777–1844).= Campbell was born in Glasgow, of\r\na poor but ancient family. After studying at Glasgow University he\r\nbecame tutor to a private family; but his _Pleasures of Hope_ (1799)\r\nbrought him fame, and he adopted the career of a poet. He visited the\r\nContinent, and saw much of the turmoil that there reigned. Returning,\r\nhe settled in London, where he was editor of _The New Monthly Magazine_\r\nfrom 1820 to 1830.\r\n\r\nHis longer poems are quite numerous, and begin with the _Pleasures\r\nof Hope_, which consists of a series of descriptions of nature in\r\nheroic couplets, written in a style that suggests Goldsmith. Other\r\nlonger poems include _Gertrude of Wyoming_ (1809), a longish tale\r\nof Pennsylvania, written in Spenserian stanzas, and _The Pilgrim of\r\nGlencoe_ (1842). Campbell, however, is chiefly remembered for his\r\nstirring songs, some of which were written during his early Continental\r\ntour and were published in newspapers. His most successful are _Ye\r\nMariners of England_ and _The Battle of the Baltic_, which are\r\nspirited without containing the bluster and boasting that so often\r\ndisfigure the patriotic song.\r\n\r\n=5. Samuel Rogers (1763–1855).= Rogers was born in London, the son of a\r\nrich banker. He soon became a partner in his father’s firm, and for the\r\nrest of his life his financial success was assured. His chief interest\r\nlay in art and poetry, which he cultivated in an earnest fashion. He\r\nwas a generous patron of the man of letters, and was acquainted with\r\nmost of the literary people of the time. His breakfasts were famous.\r\n\r\nHis _Pleasures of Memory_ (1792) is a reversion to the typical\r\neighteenth-century manner, and as such is interesting. He could\r\ncompose polished verses, but he was little of the poet. Other works are\r\n_Columbus_ (1812), _Jacqueline_ (1814), a tale in the Byronic manner,\r\nand _Italy_ (1822).\r\n\r\nRogers was a careful and fastidious writer, but his excellence does not\r\ngo much further. His name is a prominent one in the literary annals of\r\nthe time, but his wealth rather than his merit accounts for this.\r\n\r\n=6. Leigh Hunt (1784–1859)=, unlike Rogers, was not a wealthy amateur\r\nwho could trifle for years with mediocre production; he was of the\r\narena, taking and giving hard knocks in both political and literary\r\nscuffles. He was born in Middlesex, educated at Christ’s Hospital, and\r\nwhile still in his teens became a journalist, and remained a journalist\r\nall his life. His Radical journal _The Examiner_ (1808) was strongly\r\ncritical of the Government, and Hunt’s aptitude for abuse landed him\r\nin prison for two years. His captivity, as he gleefully records, made\r\na hero of him; and most of the literary men who prided themselves upon\r\ntheir Liberalism--among them being Wordsworth, Byron, Moore, Keats, and\r\nShelley--sought his friendship. Hunt had a powerful influence on Keats,\r\nand published some of the latter’s shorter poems in _The Examiner_. He\r\ntried various other journalistic ventures, but none of them had the\r\nsuccess of _The Examiner_; his attempted collaboration in journalism\r\nwith Byron was a lamentable failure. He died, like Wordsworth and\r\nothers, a respectable pensioner of the Government he had once so\r\nstrongly condemned.\r\n\r\nHe much fancied himself as a poet, and popular taste confirmed him\r\nin his delusion. The best of his longer poems is _Rimini_ (1811), an\r\nItalian tale in verse. The poem is of interest because its flowing\r\ncouplets were the model for Keats’s _Endymion_. Hunt’s shorter\r\npieces--for example, _Abou Ben Adhem_--are often graceful, but their\r\npoetical value is not very high.\r\n\r\nHis prose includes an enormous amount of journalistic matter, which\r\nwas occasionally collected and issued in book form. Such was his _Men,\r\nWomen, and Books_ (1847). His _Autobiography_ (1850) contains much\r\ninteresting biographical and literary gossip. He is an agreeable\r\nessayist, fluent and easygoing; his critical opinions are solid\r\nand sensible, though often half-informed. He wrote a novel, _Sir\r\nRalph Esher_ (1832), and a very readable book on London called _The\r\nTown_ (1848). Hunt is not a genius, but he is a useful and amiable\r\nsecond-rate writer.\r\n\r\n=7. James Hogg (1770–1835).= Hogg became known to the world as “the\r\nEttrick Shepherd,” for he was born of a shepherd’s family in the valley\r\nof the Ettrick, in Selkirkshire. He was a man of much natural ability,\r\nand from his infancy was an eager listener to the songs and ballads of\r\nhis district. He was introduced to Walter Scott (1802) while the latter\r\nwas collecting the Border minstrelsy, and by Scott he was supported\r\nboth as a literary man and as a farmer. Many of his admirers assisted\r\nhim in the acquisition of a sheep-farm, but Hogg proved to be a poor\r\nfarmer. He was known to most of the members of the Scottish literary\r\ncircle, but his shiftless and unmanageable disposition alienated most\r\nof his friends. He died in his native district.\r\n\r\nHogg had little education and very little sense of discrimination, so\r\nthat much of his poetry is very poor indeed. Sometimes, however, his\r\nnative talent prevails, and he writes such poems as _Kilmeny_ and _When\r\nthe Kye comes Hame_. The latter is a lyric resembling those of Burns in\r\nits humor and simple appeal. In _Kilmeny_ (in _The Queen’s Wake_) he\r\nachieves what is commonly held to be the true Celtic note: the eerie\r\ndescription of elves and the gloaming, and murmuring and musical echoes\r\nof things half seen and half understood. Some of his books are _The\r\nForest Minstrel_ (1801), _The Queen’s Wake_ (1813), and _The Brownie of\r\nBodsbeck_ (1818), the last being a prose tale.\r\n\r\n=8. Ebenezer Elliott (1781–1849).= Elliott was born at Masborough,\r\nin Yorkshire, and worked as an iron-founder. The struggles of the poor,\r\noppressed by the Corn Laws, were early borne in upon him, and his\r\npoetical gift was used in a fierce challenge to the existing system.\r\nLike Crabbe, he devoted himself to the cause of the poor; and it\r\nis a tribute to his merit as a poet that, in spite of his bristling\r\nassertiveness, he produced some work of real value. He became known as\r\nthe “Corn Law Rhymer,” and he lived to see the abolition of the laws\r\nthat he had always attacked.\r\n\r\nHis best book is _Corn Law Rhymes_ (1830), which includes the powerful\r\nand somber _Battle-song_. This poem is a kind of anthem for the poor,\r\nand breathes a spirit of fierce unrest.\r\n\r\n=9. Felicia Hemans (1793–1835).= Mrs. Hemans’s maiden name was\r\nBrowne, and she was born at Liverpool. Later she removed to Wales,\r\nwhere a large part of her life was spent. At the age of fifteen she\r\nbegan to write poetry, and persisted in the habit all her life. She\r\nmarried somewhat unhappily, but she lived to be a highly popular\r\npoetess, and produced a large amount of work. She died in Dublin.\r\n\r\nNobody can call Mrs. Hemans a great poetess, but her verses are facile\r\nand fairly melodious, and she can give simple themes a simple setting.\r\nOne can respect the genuine quality of her emotions, and the zeal with\r\nwhich she expressed them. Some of her better lyrics--for example,\r\n_The Stately Homes of England_, _The Graves of a Household_, and _The\r\nPilgrim Fathers_--are in their limited fashion well done.\r\n\r\n=10. Thomas Hood (1799–1845).= Hood was a native of London, and became\r\na partner in a book-selling firm. He took to a literary career, and\r\ncontributed to many periodicals, including _The London Magazine_. For a\r\ntime he edited _The New Monthly Magazine_, but he was much troubled by\r\nillness, and died prematurely.\r\n\r\nHood first gained notoriety with some humorous poems, published\r\nunder the title of _Whims and Oddities_ (1826). To modern taste the\r\nhumor is rather cheap, for it consists largely of verbal quibblings,\r\nsuch as the free use of the pun. It seemed to be acceptable to the\r\npublic of the time, for the book had much success. Other volumes in\r\nthe same vein were _The Comic Annual_, _Up the Rhine_ (1839), and\r\n_Whimsicalities_ (1843). Hood, in spite of his smartness, could not\r\nkeep free of vulgarity, and his wit often jars. As a kind of tragic\r\nrelief Hood sometimes produced poems of a tearful intensity, such as\r\n_The Death-bed_ and _The Bridge of Sighs_. One could believe that his\r\ngrief was genuine if he did not dwell so much upon it. His _Song of\r\nthe Shirt_, first published in _Punch_ in 1845, is rather a versified\r\npolitical pamphlet than a real poem, but it is powerful verse, and\r\none can forgive much on account of the motive, which was to help\r\nthe sweated sempstress. His _Dream of Eugene Aram_ (1829) was an\r\nattempt at the horrible, and was long a _bravura_ piece for aspiring\r\nelocutionists. It is a middling specimen of poetical rhetoric.\r\n\r\n=11. John Clare (1793–1864)= was a true peasant poet, and in his day he\r\nhad a great popularity. After his death his works fell into neglect,\r\nbut recently (1920) a reissue of his poems, some of them new to the\r\npublic, has recalled attention to the considerable value of much that\r\nhe wrote. He was born near Peterborough, his father being a cripple and\r\na pauper. At the age of thirteen he saved sufficient money to buy a\r\ncopy of _The Seasons_, which fired his poetic ability. His _Collection\r\nof Original Trifles_ (1817) attracted notice, and his _Poems_ (1820)\r\nwas much praised. The patronage of rich admirers put him above poverty,\r\nbut a tendency to insanity developed, and, like Christopher Smart, he\r\ndied in a madhouse.\r\n\r\nClare’s poems are seen at their best when they deal with simple rustic\r\nthemes, and then they are quite charming. He rejoices in the ways of\r\nanimals and insects. He is not a great poet, but there are many poets\r\nwith flaunting credentials who have less claims to consideration than\r\nhe.\r\n\r\n=12. James Smith (1775–1837)= and =Horace Smith (1779–1849)=, two\r\nbrothers, collaborated in the production of a work that was one of\r\nthe “hits” of the period. This book was _Rejected Addresses_ (1812).\r\nWhen the Drury Lane Theatre was burned down and rebuilt the management\r\noffered a prize for the best poem to be recited on the opening\r\nnight. The Smiths hit on the idea of making parodies of the notable\r\npoets of the time and pretending that they were the rejected poems\r\nof the writers mentioned. The result is the classical collection of\r\nparodies in English. Scott, Wordsworth, and other well-known authors\r\nare imitated, usually with much cleverness. The Wordsworth poem is\r\nrecited by Nancy Lake, a girl of eight, who is drawn upon the stage in\r\na perambulator:\r\n\r\n    My brother Jack was nine in May,\r\n    And I was eight on New Year’s Day;\r\n      So in Kate Williams’ shop\r\n    Papa (he’s my papa and Jack’s)\r\n    Bought me, last week, a doll of wax,\r\n      And brother Jack a top.\r\n\r\n\r\nWALTER SCOTT (1771–1832)\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= Scott was born in Edinburgh, of an ancient stock of\r\nBorder freebooters. At the age of eighteen months he was crippled\r\nfor life by a childish ailment; and though he grew up to be a man of\r\ngreat physical robustness he never lost his lameness. He was educated\r\nat the High School of Edinburgh and at the university; and there he\r\ndeveloped that powerful memory which, though it rejected things of no\r\ninterest to it, held in tenacious grasp a great store of miscellaneous\r\nknowledge. His father was a lawyer, and Scott himself was called to\r\nthe Scottish Bar (1792). As a pleader he had little success, for he\r\nwas much more interested in the lore and antiquities of the country.\r\nHe was glad, therefore, to accept a small legal appointment as Sheriff\r\nof Selkirkshire (1799). Just before this, after an unsuccessful\r\nlove-affair with a Perthshire lady, he had married the daughter of\r\na French exile. In 1806 he obtained the valuable post of Clerk of\r\nSession, but for six years he received no salary, as the post was still\r\nheld by an invalid nominally in charge.\r\n\r\nIn 1812, on receipt of his first salary as Clerk of Session, he\r\nremoved from his pleasant home of Ashiestiel to Abbotsford, a\r\nsmall estate near Melrose. For the place he paid £4000, which he\r\ncharacteristically obtained half by borrowing and half on security\r\nof the poem _Rokeby_, still unwritten. During the next dozen\r\nyears he played the laird at Abbotsford, keeping open house, sinking\r\nvast sums of money in enlarging his territory, and adorning the house\r\nin a manner that was frequently in the reverse of good taste. In\r\n1826 came the crash. In 1801 he had assisted a Border printer, James\r\nBallantyne, to establish a business at Edinburgh. In 1805 Scott became\r\nsecretly a partner. As a printing firm the concern was a fair success;\r\nbut in an evil moment, in 1809, Scott, with another brother, John\r\nBallantyne, started a publishing business. The new firm was poorly\r\nmanaged from the beginning; in 1814 it was only the publication of\r\n_Waverley_ that kept it on its legs, but the enormous success\r\nof the later Waverley Novels gave it abounding prosperity--for the\r\ntime. Then John Ballantyne, a reckless fellow, plunged heavily into\r\nfurther commitments, which entailed great loss; Scott in his easy\r\nfashion also drew heavily upon the firm’s funds; and in 1826 the whole\r\nerection tumbled into ruin. With great courage and sterling honesty\r\nScott refused to take the course that the other principals accepted\r\nnaturally, and compound with his creditors. Instead he attempted what\r\nturned out to be the impossible task of paying the debt and surviving\r\nit. His liabilities amounted to £117,000, and before he died he had\r\ncleared off £70,000. After his death the remainder was made good,\r\nchiefly from the proceeds of Lockhart’s _Life_, and his creditors\r\nwere paid in full.\r\n\r\nThe gigantic efforts he made brought about his death. He had a slight\r\nparalytic seizure in 1830. It passed, but it left him with a clouded\r\nbrain. He refused to desist from novel-writing, or even to slacken the\r\npace. Other illness followed, his early lameness becoming more marked.\r\nAfter an ineffectual journey to Italy, he returned to Abbotsford, and\r\ndied within sound of the river he loved so well.\r\n\r\n=2. His Poetry.= Scott’s earliest poetical efforts were translations\r\nfrom the German. _Lenore_ (1799), the most considerable of them, is\r\ncrude enough, but it has much of his later vigor and clatter. In 1802\r\nappeared the first two volumes of _The Minstrelsy of the Scottish\r\nBorder_. In some respects the work is a compilation of old material;\r\nbut Scott patched up the ancient pieces when it was necessary, and\r\nadded some original poems of his own, which were done in the ancient\r\nmanner. The best of his own contributions, such as _The Eve of St.\r\nJohn_, have a strong infusion of the ancient force and fire, as well as\r\na grimly supernatural element.\r\n\r\nIn _The Lay of the Last Minstrel_ (1805) there is much more\r\noriginality. The work is a poem of considerable length, professing to\r\nbe the lay of an aged bard who seeks shelter in the castle of Newark.\r\nAs a tale the poem is confused and difficult; as poetry it is mediocre;\r\nbut the abounding vitality of the style, the fresh and intimate local\r\nknowledge, and the healthy love of nature made it a revelation to a\r\npublic anxious to welcome the new Romantic methods. The poem was a\r\ngreat and instant success, and was quickly followed up with _Marmion_\r\n(1808).\r\n\r\nIn popular estimation _Marmion_ is held to be Scott’s masterpiece.\r\nThe story deals with Flodden Field, and is intricate in detail, as\r\nScott labors to obtain a _dénouement_. For several cantos the tale\r\nis cumbered with the masses of antiquarian and topical matter with\r\nwhich Scott’s mind was fully charged. Once the narrative is within\r\ntouch of Flodden it quickens considerably. The conclusion, dealing\r\nwith the death of Marmion and the close of the battle, is one of the\r\ntriumphs of martial verse:\r\n\r\n    But as they left the dark’ning heath,\r\n    More desperate grew the strife of death.\r\n    The English shafts in volleys hail’d,\r\n    In headlong charge their horse assail’d;\r\n    Front, flank, and rear, the squadrons sweep\r\n    To break the Scottish circle deep,\r\n      That fought around their King.\r\n    But yet, though thick the shafts as snow,\r\n    Though charging knights like whirlwinds go\r\n    Though bill-men ply the ghastly blow,\r\n      Unbroken was the ring;\r\n    The stubborn spear-men still made good\r\n    Their dark impenetrable wood,\r\n    Each stepping where his comrade stood,\r\n      The instant that he fell.\r\n    No thought was there of dastard flight;\r\n    Link’d in the serried phalanx tight,\r\n    Groom fought like noble, squire like knight,\r\n      As fearlessly and well;\r\n    Till utter darkness closed her wing\r\n    O’er their thin host and wounded King....\r\n\r\nNext came _The Lady of the Lake_ (1810), a still greater success, but\r\nclumsy in plot and heavy with unpoetical matter. The poem made the\r\nfortune of the Trossachs. In _Rokeby_ (1813) the scene shifts to the\r\nNorth of England. As a whole this poem is inferior to its predecessors,\r\nbut some of the lyrics have a seriousness and depth of tone that are\r\nquite uncommon in the spur-and-feather pageantry of Scott’s verse. _The\r\nBridal of Triermain_ (1813) and _The Lord of the Isles_ (1814) mark a\r\ndecline in quality.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the longer poems Scott composed many lyrics, and\r\ncontinued to write such till late in his career. Most of them are\r\npassable in a tuneful and picturesque fashion; and in a few, such as\r\n_Proud Maisie_ and _A Weary Lot is Thine_, he attains to something\r\nfiner and deeper. A ballad from _Rokeby_ has an intensity that gives it\r\na strongly lyrical cast. The conclusion is as follows:\r\n\r\n    “With burnish’d brand and musketoon\r\n      So gallantly you come,\r\n    I read you for a bold Dragoon,\r\n      That lists the tuck of drum.”\r\n    “I list no more the tuck of drum,\r\n      No more the trumpet hear;\r\n    But when the beetle sounds his hum,\r\n      My comrades take the spear.\r\n\r\n    “And O! though Brignall banks be fair,\r\n      And Greta woods be gay,\r\n    Yet mickle must the maiden dare,\r\n      Would reign my Queen of May!\r\n\r\n    “Maiden! a nameless life I lead,\r\n      A nameless death I’ll die;\r\n    The fiend whose lantern lights the mead\r\n      Were better mate than I!\r\n    And when I’m with my comrades met\r\n      Beneath the green-wood bough,\r\n    What once we were we all forget,\r\n      Nor think what we are now.\r\n\r\n    “Yet Brignall banks are fresh and fair,\r\n      And Greta woods are green,\r\n    And you may gather garlands there,\r\n      Would grace a summer queen.”\r\n\r\nAs a poet Scott’s reputation has depreciated and continues to\r\ndepreciate. His faults, like his merits, are all on the surface: he\r\nlacks the finer poetical virtues, such as reflection, melody, and\r\ndelicate sympathy; he (in poetry) is deficient in humor; he records\r\ncrude physical action simply portrayed. Even the vigor that is often\r\nascribed to him exists fitfully, for he loads his narrative with\r\noverabundant detail, often of a technical kind. When he does move\r\nfreely he has the stamp, the rattle, and the swing of martial music.\r\nOne must nevertheless do credit to the service he did to poetry by\r\ngiving new zest to the Romantic methods that had already been adopted\r\nin poetry.\r\n\r\n=3. His Prose.= About 1814 Scott largely gave up writing poetry, and\r\nsave for a few short pieces wrote no more in verse. There are two\r\nchief reasons for his desertion of the poetical form. With his native\r\nshrewdness he saw that he had marketed as much verse as the public\r\ncould absorb; and, secondly, as he confessed in the last year of his\r\nlife, Byron had “bet” him by producing verse tales that were fast\r\nswallowing up the popularity of his own. In 1814 Scott returned to\r\na fragment of a Jacobite prose romance that he had started and left\r\nunfinished in 1805. He left the opening chapters as they stood,\r\nand on to them tacked a rapid and brilliant narrative dealing with\r\nthe Forty-five. This made the novel _Waverley_, which was issued\r\nanonymously in 1814. Owing chiefly to its ponderous and lifeless\r\nbeginning, the book hung fire for a space; but the remarkable remainder\r\nwas almost bound to make it a success. After _Waverley_ Scott went on\r\nfrom strength to strength: _Guy Mannering_ (1815), _The Antiquary_\r\n(1816), _The Black Dwarf_ (1816), _Old Mortality_ (1816), _Rob Roy_\r\n(1818), _The Heart of Midlothian_ (1818), _The Bride of Lammermoor_\r\n(1819), and _The Legend of Montrose_ (1819). All these novels deal\r\nwith scenes in Scotland, but not all with historical Scotland. They\r\nare not of equal merit, but even the weakest, _The Black Dwarf_,\r\nis astonishingly good. Scott now turned his gaze abroad, producing\r\n_Ivanhoe_ (1820), the scene of which is pitched in early England; then\r\nturned again to Scotland and suffered failure with _The Monastery_\r\n(1820), though he triumphantly rehabilitated himself with _The Abbot_\r\n(1820), a sequel to the last. Henceforth he ranged abroad or stayed\r\nat home as he fancied in _Kenilworth_ (1821), _The Pirate_ (1822),\r\n_The Fortunes of Nigel_ (1822), _Peveril of the Peak_ (1823), _Quentin\r\nDurward_ (1823), _St. Ronan’s Well_ (1824), _Redgauntlet_ (1824),\r\n_The Betrothed_ (1825), and _The Talisman_ (1825). By this time such\r\nenormous productivity was telling even on his gigantic powers. In the\r\nlater books the narrative is often heavier, the humor more cumbrous,\r\nand the descriptions more labored.\r\n\r\nThen came the financial deluge, and Scott began a losing battle against\r\nmisfortune and disease. But even yet the odds were not too great for\r\nhim; for in succession appeared _Woodstock_ (1826), _The Fair Maid of\r\nPerth_ (1828), _Count Robert of Paris_ (1831), and _Castle Dangerous_\r\n(1831). The last works were dictated from the depths of mental and\r\nbodily anguish, and the furrows of mind and brow are all over them. Yet\r\nfrequently the old spirit revives and the ancient glory is renewed.\r\n\r\nIt should never be forgotten that along with these literary] labors\r\nScott was filling the office of Clerk of Session, was laboriously\r\nperforming the duties of a Border laird, and was compiling a mass\r\nof miscellaneous prose. Among this last are his editions of Dryden\r\n(1808) and Swift (1814), heavy tasks in themselves; the _Lives of the\r\nNovelists_ (1820); the _Life of Napoleon_ (1827), a gigantic work\r\nthat cost him more labor than ten novels; and the admirable _Tales\r\nof a Grandfather_ (1827–29). His miscellaneous articles, pamphlets,\r\njournals, and letters are a legion in themselves.\r\n\r\n=4. Features of his Novels.= (_a_) _Rapidity of Production._ Scott’s\r\ngreat success as a novelist led to some positive evils, the greatest\r\nof which was a too great haste in the composition of his stories.\r\nHis haphazard financial methods, which often led to his drawing upon\r\nfuture profits, also tended to overproduction. Haste is visible in the\r\nconstruction of his plots, which are frequently hurriedly improvised,\r\ndeveloped carelessly, and finished anyhow. As for his style, it is\r\nspacious and ornate, but he has little ear for rhythm and melody, and\r\nhis sentences are apt to be shapeless. The same haste is seen in the\r\nhandling of his characters, which sometimes finish weakly after they\r\nhave begun strongly. An outstanding case of this is Mike Lambourne in\r\n_Kenilworth_.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if Scott would have done any better if he had taken\r\ngreater pains. He himself admitted, and to a certain extent gloried in,\r\nhis slapdash methods. So he must stand the inevitable criticisms that\r\narise when his methods are examined.\r\n\r\n(_b_) His _contribution to the novel_ is very great indeed. To the\r\nhistorical novel he brought a knowledge that was not pedantically\r\nexact, but manageable, wide, and bountiful. To the sum of this\r\nknowledge he added a life-giving force, a vitalizing energy, an\r\ninsight, and a genial dexterity that made the historical novel an\r\nentirely new species. Earlier historical novels, such as Clara Reeve’s\r\n_Old English Baron_ (1777) and Miss Porter’s _Scottish Chiefs_\r\n(1810), had been lifeless productions; but in the hands of Scott the\r\nhistorical novel became of the first importance, so much so that for a\r\ngeneration after his time it was done almost to death. It should also\r\nbe noted that he did much to develop the domestic novel, which had\r\nseveral representatives in the Waverley series, such as _Guy Mannering_\r\nand _The Antiquary_. To this type of fiction he added freshness, as\r\nwell as his broad and sane handling of character and incident.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _His Shakespearian Qualities._ Scott has often been called the\r\nprose Shakespeare, and in several respects the comparison is fairly\r\njust. He resembles Shakespeare in the free manner in which he ranges\r\nhigh and low, right and left, in his search for material. On the other\r\nhand, in his character-drawing he lacks much of the Elizabethan’s deep\r\npenetration, though he has much of Shakespeare’s genial, tolerant\r\nhumor, in which he strongly resembles also his great predecessor\r\nFielding. It is probably in this large urbanity that the resemblance to\r\nShakespeare is observed most strongly.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _His Style._ The following extract will give some idea of Scott’s\r\nstyle at its best. It lacks suppleness, but it is powerful, solid, and\r\nsure. In his use of the Scottish vernacular he is exceedingly natural\r\nand vivacious. His characters who employ the Scottish dialect, such\r\nas Cuddie Headrigg or Jeanie Deans, owe much of their freshness and\r\nattraction to Scott’s happy use of their native speech:\r\n\r\n   Fergus, as the presiding judge was putting on the fatal cap of\r\n   judgment, placed his own bonnet upon his head, regarded him with\r\n   a steadfast and stern look, and replied in a firm voice: “I\r\n   cannot let this numerous audience suppose that to such an appeal\r\n   I have no answer to make. But what I have to say you would\r\n   not bear to hear, for my defence would be your condemnation.\r\n   Proceed, then, in the name of God, to do what is permitted to\r\n   you. Yesterday and the day before you have condemned loyal and\r\n   honourable blood to be poured forth like water. Spare not mine.\r\n   Were that of all my ancestors in my veins, I would have perilled\r\n   it in this quarrel.” He resumed his seat, and refused again to\r\n   rise.\r\n\r\n   Evan Maccombich looked at him with great earnestness, and,\r\n   rising up, seemed anxious to speak; but the confusion of the\r\n   court and the perplexity arising from thinking in a language\r\n   different from that in which he was to express himself, kept him\r\n   silent. There was a murmur of compassion among the spectators,\r\n   from the idea that the poor fellow intended to plead the\r\n   influence of his superior as an excuse for his crime. The judge\r\n   commanded silence, and encouraged Evan to proceed.\r\n\r\n   “I was only ganging to say, my lord,” said Evan, in what he\r\n   meant to be an insinuating manner, “that if your excellent\r\n   Honour and the honourable court would let Vich Ian Vohr go\r\n   free just this once, and let him gae back to France, and no to\r\n   trouble King George’s government again, ony six o’ the very best\r\n   of his clan will be willing to be justified in his stead; and if\r\n   you’ll just let me gae down to Glennaquoich, I’ll fetch them up\r\n   to ye mysell, to head or hang, and you may begin wi’ me the very\r\n   first man.”\r\n                                                      _Waverley_\r\n\r\n\r\nJANE AUSTEN (1775–1817)\r\n\r\n=1. Her Life.= Jane Austen was the daughter of a Hampshire clergyman.\r\nShe was educated at home; her father was a man of good taste in the\r\nchoice of reading material, and Jane’s education was conducted on sound\r\nlines. Her life was unexciting, being little more than a series of\r\npilgrimages to different places of residence, including the fashionable\r\nresort of Bath (1801). On the death of the rector his wife and two\r\ndaughters removed to the neighbourhood of Southampton, where the\r\nmajority of Jane Austen’s novels were written. Her first published\r\nworks were issued anonymously, and she died in middle age, before her\r\nmerits had received anything like adequate recognition.\r\n\r\n=2. Her Novels.= The chronology of Miss Austen’s novels is not\r\neasy to follow, for her earliest works were the last to be published.\r\nIn what follows we shall take the books approximately in their order of\r\ncomposition, not of publication.\r\n\r\nHer first novel was _Northanger Abbey_, which was finished in 1798,\r\nbut not published till 1818, after her death. The book begins as a\r\nburlesque of the Radcliffe type of the terror novel, which was then\r\nall the rage. The heroine, after a visit to Bath, is invited to an\r\nabbey, where she imagines romantic possibilities, but is in the end\r\nludicrously undeceived. The incidents in the novel are ingloriously\r\ncommonplace, and the characters flatly average. Yet the treatment is\r\ndeft and touched with the finest needle-point of satiric observation.\r\nThe style is smooth and unobtrusive, but covers a delicate pricking of\r\nirony that is agreeable and masterly in its quiet way. Nothing quite\r\nlike it had appeared before in the novel.\r\n\r\nIn _Pride and Prejudice_ (1797) the same methods are to be seen. We\r\nhave the same middle-class people pursuing the common round. The\r\nheroine is a girl of spirit, but she has no extraordinary qualities;\r\nthe pride and prejudice of rank and wealth are gently but pleasingly\r\ntitillated, as if they are being subjected to an electric current of\r\ncarefully selected intensity. In unobtrusive and dexterous art the book\r\nis considered to be her masterpiece.\r\n\r\n_Sense and Sensibility_ (1798) was her third novel, and it followed\r\nthe same general lines as its predecessors. Then came a long pause,\r\nfor she could find no publisher to issue her work. The first to see\r\nprint was the last mentioned, which appeared in 1811. Stimulated to\r\nfurther effort, in quick succession she wrote _Mansfield Park_ (1814),\r\n_Emma_ (1816), and _Persuasion_ (1818). The latter group are of the\r\ntype of the others; if there is development it is seen in the still\r\nmore inflexible avoidance of anything that is unusual or startling. The\r\nnovels are all much the same, yet subtly and artistically different.\r\n\r\n=3. Features of her Novels.= (_a_) _Her Plots._ Her plots are severely\r\nunromantic. Her first work, beginning as a burlesque of the horrible\r\nin fiction, finishes by being an excellent example of her ideal novel.\r\nAs her art develops, even the slight casualties of common life--such\r\nan incident, for example, as the elopement that appears in _Pride and\r\nPrejudice_--become rarer; with the result that the later novels, such\r\nas _Emma_, are the pictures of everyday existence. Only the highest art\r\ncan make such plots attractive, and Jane Austen’s does so.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Her _characters_ are developed with minuteness and accuracy.\r\nThey are ordinary people, but are convincingly alive. She is fond of\r\nintroducing clergymen, all of whom strike the reader as being exactly\r\nlike clergymen, though each has his own individual characteristics. She\r\nhas many characters of the first class, like the servile Mr. Collins\r\nin _Pride and Prejudice_, the garrulous Miss Bates in _Emma_, and the\r\nselfish and vulgar John Thorpe in _Northanger Abbey_. Her characters\r\nare not types, but individuals. Her method of portrayal is based upon\r\nacute observation and a quiet but incisive irony. Her male characters\r\nhave a certain softness of thew and temper, but her female characters\r\nare almost unexceptionable in perfection of finish.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Her _place in the history of fiction_ is remarkable. Her\r\nqualities are of a kind that are slow to be recognized, for there is\r\nnothing loud or garish to catch the casual glance. The taste for this\r\nkind of fiction has to be acquired, but once it is acquired it remains\r\nstrong. Jane Austen has won her way to a foremost place, and she will\r\nsurely keep it.\r\n\r\nWe add a short extract to illustrate her clear and careful style, her\r\nskill in handling conversation, and the quiet irony of her method.\r\n\r\n   (_Catherine Morland, the heroine of the novel, is introduced\r\n   to the society of Bath, where she cuts rather a lonely figure\r\n   till she meets a young man called Tilney--“not quite handsome,\r\n   but very near it.” The following is part of their conversation\r\n   at a dance._)\r\n\r\n   After chatting some time on such matters as naturally arose from\r\n   the objects around them, he suddenly addressed her with--“I have\r\n   hitherto been very remiss, madam, in the proper attentions of a\r\n   partner here; I have not yet asked you how long you have been in\r\n   Bath; whether you were ever here before; whether you have been\r\n   at the Upper Rooms, the theatre, and the concert; and how you\r\n   like the place altogether. I have been very negligent--but are\r\n   you now at leisure to satisfy me in these particulars? If you\r\n   are I will begin directly.”\r\n\r\n   “You need not give yourself that trouble, sir.”\r\n\r\n   “No trouble, I assure you, madam.” Then forming his features\r\n   into a set smile, and affectedly softening his voice, he added,\r\n   with a simpering air, “Have you been long in Bath, madam?”\r\n\r\n   “About a week, sir,” replied Catherine, trying not to laugh.\r\n\r\n   “Really!” with affected astonishment.\r\n\r\n   “Why should you be surprised, sir?”\r\n\r\n   “Why, indeed!” said he, in his natural tone; “but some emotion\r\n   must appear to be raised by your reply, and surprise is more\r\n   easily assumed, and not less reasonable, than any other.--Now\r\n   let us go on. Were you never here before, madam?”\r\n\r\n   “Never, sir.”\r\n\r\n   “Indeed! Have you yet honoured the Upper Rooms?”\r\n\r\n   “Yes, sir, I was there last Monday.”\r\n\r\n   “Have you been to the theatre?”\r\n\r\n   “Yes, sir, I was at the play on Tuesday.”\r\n\r\n   “To the concert?”\r\n\r\n   “Yes, sir, on Wednesday.”\r\n\r\n   “And are you altogether pleased with Bath?”\r\n\r\n   “Yes--I like it very well.”\r\n\r\n   “Now I must give one smirk, and then we may be rational again.”\r\n                                              _Northanger Abbey_\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER NOVELISTS\r\n\r\n=1. Maria Edgeworth (1767–1849).= This novelist was born in County\r\nLongford, Ireland. Her life is largely the catalogue of her books,\r\nwhich are numerous, varied, and in quality very unequal. Her best\r\nnovels deal with Irish life. They were warmly praised by Scott,\r\nwho declared that they gave him ideas for his own stories. _Castle\r\nRackrent_ (1800) is successful in its dealing with Irish characters;\r\n_Lenora_ (1806) shows a good deal of power; _Tales of Fashionable Life_\r\n(1809) contains much of her best work, including _The Absentee_, which\r\nis commonly considered her masterpiece. Other works are _Patronage_\r\n(1814), _Harrington_ (1817), and _Ormand_ (1817). Her type of fiction\r\nis lively and agreeable, except when she indulges in a shallow kind of\r\nmoralizing. In her day her popularity ran a close second to Scott’s,\r\nbut now only a slight flicker survives.\r\n\r\n=2. John Galt (1779–1839)= was born in Ayrshire, and there he passed\r\nthe early years of his life, afterward removing to Greenock. He\r\nstudied for the Bar, but delicate health drove him abroad. After\r\nmuch traveling he settled in Scotland, and produced a large amount of\r\nliterary work. He engaged unsuccessfully in business transactions,\r\nthen took once more to writing novels and to journalism. He died at\r\nGreenock, where his career had commenced.\r\n\r\nThe best of his novels are _The Ayrshire Legatees_ (1820), in the form\r\nof a letter-series, containing much amusing Scottish narrative; _The\r\nAnnals of the Parish_ (1821), his masterpiece, which is the record of a\r\nfictitious country minister, doing in prose very much what Crabbe had\r\ndone in verse; _The Entail_ (1821); and _The Provost_ (1822). Galt had\r\na vigorous style and abundant imagination, with a great deal of humor\r\nand sympathetic observation. He is too haphazard and uneven to be a\r\ngreat novelist, though he has value as a painter of Scottish manners.\r\n\r\n=3. William Harrison Ainsworth (1805–82)= was an early imitator of\r\nScott. He wrote a great number of novels, which cover many periods\r\nof English history. The first was _Sir John Chiverton_ (1825), but\r\nhe scored his great success with the Dick Turpin romance _Rookwood_\r\n(1834). A few of the many others were _Jack Sheppard_ (1839), an\r\nimmense success, _The Tower of London_ (1840), _Old St. Paul’s_ (1841),\r\n_Windsor Castle_ (1843), _The Star Chamber_ (1854), _The Constable of\r\nthe Tower_ (1861), and _Preston Fight_ (1875). Ainsworth possesses\r\nlittle of Scott’s genius, for his handling of history is crude and\r\nheavy, and consists of throwing in large, undigested lumps of history.\r\nHe is feeble in his treatment of his characters, but when he is in\r\nthe right vein he can give the reader a vigorous narrative and a fair\r\nquality of description.\r\n\r\n=4. George P. R. James (1801–60)= was another follower of the method of\r\nScott, and he was responsible for a hundred and eighty-nine volumes,\r\nchiefly novels. He was born in London; traveled abroad; settled down\r\nto novel-writing; on the strength of some serious historical work was\r\nappointed Historiographer Royal; entered the consular service; and died\r\nat Venice.\r\n\r\n_Richelieu_ (1828), which bears a strong resemblance to _Quentin\r\nDurward_, was his earliest, and is by many considered to be his best,\r\nnovel. Others include _Darnley_ (1830), _De l’Orme_ (1830), _The Gipsy_\r\n(1835), and _Lady Montague’s Page_ (1858). As was almost inevitable\r\nwith such mass-production, he makes his novels on a stock pattern. He\r\nis fond of florid pageantry, and can be rather ingeniously mysterious\r\nin his plots. He has little power in dealing with his characters, and\r\nno imaginative grasp of history. In style he is undistinguished, but\r\nfluent and clear.\r\n\r\n=5. Charles Lever (1806–72).= Lever was born in Dublin, was educated at\r\nTrinity College and Göttingen, and became a physician. The success of\r\nhis novels caused him to desert his profession, and in the course of\r\ntime (1842) he became editor of _The Dublin University Magazine_, which\r\nhad published his first stories. In his latter years he lived abroad,\r\nwas appointed consul in Sardinia (1858), and after some other changes\r\ndied when consul at Trieste.\r\n\r\n_Harry Lorrequer_ (1839), his first novel, made a great hit. It is\r\na novel of the picaresque type, dealing with the adventures of the\r\nhare-brained but lovable hero. _Charles O’Malley_ (1841) is of the same\r\nspecies, and others are _Jack Hinton_ (1842) and _Tom Burke of Ours_\r\n(1844). The scenes of these novels are pitched in Ireland; there is\r\nlittle plot, what there is consisting of the scrapes of the heroes; the\r\nhumor is rough-and-tumble, though agreeably lively; and the heroes,\r\nwho are all much the same, are amiable fellows, with a propensity\r\nfor falling into trouble and falling out of it. A later class of\r\nLever’s novels was more of the historical cast, and includes _The\r\nO’Donovan_ (1845) and _The Knight of Gwynne_ (1847). Others dealt with\r\nthe Continent, and include _The Dodd Family Abroad_ (1854) and _The\r\nFortunes of Glencore_ (1857). These latter are more stable and serious,\r\nand as novels are better than the earlier groups.\r\n\r\n=6. Frederick Marryat (1792–1848)= followed the Smollett tradition\r\nof writing sea-stories. He was born in London, entered the Navy at an\r\nearly age (1806), and saw some fighting just before the conclusion of\r\nthe Napoleonic Wars. He saw further service in different parts of the\r\nworld, rose to be a captain, and spent much of his later life writing\r\nthe novels that have given him his place in literature.\r\n\r\nHis earliest novel was _The Naval Officer_ (1829), a loose and\r\ndisconnected narrative, which was followed by _The King’s Own_ (1830),\r\na much more able piece of work. From this point he continued to produce\r\nfiction at a great rate. The best of his stories are _Jacob Faithful_\r\n(1834), _Peter Simple_ (1834), _Japhet in Search of a Father_ (1836),\r\n_Mr. Midshipman Easy_ (1836), and _Masterman Ready_ (1841). All his\r\nbest books deal with the sea, and have much of its breeziness. Marryat\r\nhas a considerable gift for plain narrative, and his humor, though\r\nit is often coarse, is entertaining. His characters are of the stock\r\ntypes, but they are lively and suit his purpose, which is to produce a\r\ngood yarn.\r\n\r\n=7. Michael Scott (1789–1835)= was another novelist whose favorite\r\ntheme was the sea. Scott was not a sailor like Marryat, but a merchant,\r\nfirst in Jamaica and then in his native city of Glasgow. His two tales,\r\n_Tom Cringle’s Log_ (1829) and _The Cruise of the Midge_ (1834), were\r\npublished in _Blackwood’s Magazine_. They have attempts at fine writing\r\nwhich Marryat did not aspire to, and are none the better for it, for\r\nScott seldom succeeds in being impressive. His actual nautical details\r\nlack the intimacy and freshness of Marryat’s. He was, however, a gifted\r\nstory-teller, and his tales are rarely dull.\r\n\r\n=8. Benjamin Disraeli (1804–81), Lord Beaconsfield=, was a Londoner of\r\nJewish race, and after many struggles and failures rose to be leader of\r\nthe Tory party in Parliament and Prime Minister. His political career\r\ndoes not concern us here.\r\n\r\nHe began his literary career as a novelist. _Vivian Grey_ (1826)\r\nsoon set the fashionable world talking of its author. It dealt with\r\nfashionable society, it was brilliant and witty, and it had an easy\r\narrogance that amused, incensed, and attracted at the same time.\r\nThe general effect of cutting sarcasm was varied, but not improved,\r\nby passages of florid description and sentimental moralizing. His\r\nnext effort was _The Voyage of Captain Popanilla_ (1829), a modern\r\n_Gulliver’s Travels_. The wit is very incisive, and the satire, though\r\nit lacks the solid weight of Swift’s, is sure and keen. Disraeli\r\nwrote a good number of other novels, the most notable of which were\r\n_Contarini Fleming_ (1831), _Henrietta Temple_ (1837), _Coningsby_\r\n(1844), _Sybil_ (1845), and _Tancred_ (1847). These last books, written\r\nwhen experience of public affairs had added depth to his vision and\r\nedge to his satire, are polished and powerful novels dealing with\r\nthe politics of his day. At times they are too brilliant, for the\r\ncontinual crackle of epigram dazzles and wearies, and his tawdry taste\r\nleads him to overload his ornamental passages. Disraeli also carried\r\nfurther the idea of _Captain Popanilla_ by writing _Alroy_ (1832),\r\n_Ixion in Heaven_ (1833), and _The Infernal Marriage_, which are half\r\nallegorical, half supernatural, but wholly satirical romances. In style\r\nthe prose is inflated, but the later novels sometimes have flashes of\r\nreal passion and insight.\r\n\r\n=9. Edward Bulwer-Lytton (1805–73)= was the son of General Bulwer.\r\nOn the death of his mother he succeeded to her estate and took the\r\nname of Lytton, later becoming Lord Lytton. He was at first educated\r\nprivately, and then at Cambridge, where he won a prize for English\r\nverse. He had a long and successful career both as a literary man and\r\nas a politician. He entered Parliament, was created in turn a baronet\r\nand a peer, and for a time held Cabinet rank.\r\n\r\nHis earliest efforts in literature were rather feeble imitations of\r\nthe Byronic manner. His first novel was _Falkland_ (1827), which\r\nwas published anonymously, and then came _Pelham_ (1828). These are\r\npictures of current society, and are immature in their affectation\r\nof wit and cynicism. They contain some clever things, but they lack\r\nthe real merit of the early novels of Disraeli. Another of the same\r\nkind was _Devereux_ (1829). _Paul Clifford_ (1830) changed the scene\r\nto the haunts of vice and crime, but was not at all convincing.\r\nLytton now took to writing historical novels, the best of which were\r\n_The Last Days of Pompeii_ (1834), _Rienzi_ (1835), and _Harold_\r\n(1848). They are rather garish, but clever and attractive, and they\r\nhad great popularity. He did not neglect the domestic novel, writing\r\n_The Caxtons_ (1849) and _My Novel_ (1853); and the terror and\r\nsupernatural species were ably represented by _A Strange Story_ (1862)\r\nand _The Coming Race_ (1871). Lytton is never first-rate, but he is\r\nastonishingly versatile, and, considering the speed of his production,\r\nhis books are of a high quality. His plays, such as _Richelieu_ (1839)\r\nand _Money_ (1840), had great success.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES LAMB (1775–1834)\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= Lamb was born in London, his father being a kind of\r\nfactotum to a Bencher of the Middle Temple. The boy, who was a timid\r\nand retiring youth, was educated at Christ’s Hospital, where he was a\r\nfellow-pupil of Coleridge, whose early eccentricities he has touched\r\nupon with his usual felicity. He would have entered the Church, but\r\nan impediment in his speech made such a course impossible; instead he\r\nobtained a clerkship first in the South Sea House, then (1792) in the\r\nEast India House, where the remainder of his working life was spent.\r\nThere was a strain of madness in the family which did not leave him\r\nuntouched, for in 1795–96 he was under restraint for a time. In the\r\ncase of his sister, Mary Lamb, the curse was a deadly one. In September\r\n1796 she murdered her mother in a sudden frenzy, and thereafter she\r\nhad intermittent attacks of insanity. Lamb devoted his life to the\r\nwelfare of his afflicted sister, who frequently appears in his essays\r\nunder the name of Cousin Bridget. After more than thirty years’ service\r\nLamb retired (1825) on a pension, and the last ten years of his life\r\nwere passed in blessed release from his desk. He was a charming man,\r\na delightful talker, and one of the least assuming of writers. His\r\nreputation, based upon his qualities of humor, pathos, and cheery\r\ngoodwill, is unsurpassed in our literature.\r\n\r\n=2. His Essays.= Lamb started his literary career as a poet, producing\r\nshort pieces of moderate ability, including the well-known _The Old\r\nFamiliar Faces_ and _To Hester_. He attempted a tragedy, _John Woodvil_\r\n(1801), in the style of his favorite Elizabethan playwrights, but it\r\nhad no success on the stage. His _Tales from Shakespeare_ (1807),\r\nwritten in collaboration with his sister, are skillfully done, and are\r\nagreeable to read. His critical work, narrow in scope, is remarkable\r\nfor its delicate insight and good literary taste. All these writings,\r\nhowever, are of little importance compared with his essays.\r\n\r\nThe first of his essays appeared in _The London Magazine_ in 1820,\r\nwhen Lamb was forty-five years old. It was signed “Elia,” a name\r\ntaken almost at random as that of an old foreigner who used to haunt\r\nthe South Sea House. The series continued till October 1822, and was\r\npublished as _The Essays of Elia_ (1823). A second series lasted from\r\nMay 1824 to August 1825, and was published under the title of _The Last\r\nEssays of Elia_ (1833).\r\n\r\nThe essays are unequaled in English. In subject they are of the usual\r\nmiscellaneous kind, ranging from chimneysweeps to old china. They are,\r\nhowever, touched with personal opinions and recollections so oddly\r\nobtruded that interest in the subject is nearly swamped by the reader’s\r\ndelight in the author. No essayist is more egotistical than Lamb; but\r\nno egotist can be so artless and yet so artful, so tearful and yet so\r\nmirthful, so pedantic and yet so humane. It is this delicate clashing\r\nof humors, like the chiming of sweet bells, that affords the chief\r\ndelight to Lamb’s readers.\r\n\r\nIt is almost impossible to do justice to his style. It is\r\nold-fashioned, bearing echoes and odors from older writers like Sir\r\nThomas Browne and Fuller; it is full of long and curious words; and\r\nit is dashed with frequent exclamations and parentheses. The humor\r\nthat runs through it all is not strong, but airy, almost elfish, in\r\nnote; it vibrates faintly, but in application never lacks precision.\r\nHis pathos is of much the same character; and sometimes, as in\r\n_Dream-Children_, it deepens into a quivering sigh of regret. He\r\nis so sensitive and so strong, so cheerful and yet so unalteringly\r\ndoomed to sorrow.\r\n\r\nThe extract given below deals with the playhouse, which was one of\r\nhis greatest passions. The reader can easily observe some of the\r\nabove-mentioned features of his style.\r\n\r\n   In those days were pit orders. Beshrew the uncomfortable manager\r\n   who abolished them!--with one of these we went. I remember\r\n   the waiting at the door--not that which is left--but between\r\n   that and an inner door in shelter--O when shall I be such an\r\n   expectant again!--with the cry of nonpareils, an indispensable\r\n   playhouse accompaniment in those days. As near as I can\r\n   recollect, the fashionable pronunciation of the theatrical\r\n   fruiteresses then was, “Chase some oranges, chase some\r\n   num-parels, chase a bill of the play;”--chase _pro_ chuse.\r\n   But when we got in, and I beheld the green curtain that veiled\r\n   a heaven to my imagination, which was soon to be disclosed--the\r\n   breathless anticipations I endured! I had seen something like it\r\n   in the plate prefixed to _Troilus and Cressida_, in Rowe’s\r\n   Shakespeare--the tent scene with Diomede--and a sight of that\r\n   plate can always bring back in a measure the feeling of that\r\n   evening.--The boxes at that time, full of well-dressed women of\r\n   quality, projected over the pit; and the pilasters reaching down\r\n   were adorned with a glistering substance (I know not what) under\r\n   glass (as it seemed), resembling--a homely fancy--but I judged\r\n   it to be sugar-candy--yet, to my raised imagination, divested\r\n   of its homelier qualities, it appeared a glorified candy!--The\r\n   orchestra lights at length arose, those “fair Auroras!” Once the\r\n   bell sounded. It was to ring out yet once again--and, incapable\r\n   of the anticipation, I reposed my shut eyes in a sort of\r\n   resignation upon the maternal lap. It rang the second time. The\r\n   curtain drew up--I was not past six years old--and the play was\r\n   _Artaxerxes_!\r\n                                                 _My First Play_\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS DE QUINCEY (1785–1859)\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= De Quincey was born at Manchester, where his father\r\nwas a rich merchant. The elder De Quincey left considerable property,\r\nbut De Quincey himself was improvident and unreliable in his financial\r\naffairs. He was educated first at Manchester Grammar School and then\r\nat Oxford. There he studied for a long time (1803–8), distinguishing\r\nhimself by his ability in Greek. While he was an undergraduate (1804)\r\nhe first became acquainted with opium, soaking his tobacco in the drug\r\nand then smoking it in order to alleviate the pains of neuralgia. His\r\nmoney was always easily spent, and his early struggles were a painful\r\neffort to make both ends meet. He earned a precarious livelihood by\r\njournalism, and lived for a long time (1809–30) in the Lake District,\r\nbecoming intimate with the local literary celebrities. During this time\r\nhis devotion to the drug was excessive, but he produced a large amount\r\nof work. Then, becoming loosely attached to the staff of _Blackwood’s\r\nMagazine_, he removed to Edinburgh. In this neighborhood he remained\r\ntill the end of his long life, and was buried in the Scottish capital.\r\n\r\n=2. His Works.= De Quincey is one of the authors whose work is to\r\nbe rigorously sifted. He wrote a large amount of prose; most of it is\r\nhack-work, a fair proportion is of good quality, and a small amount is\r\nof the highest merit. He wrote no book of any great length, in this\r\nrespect resembling another opium-eater, Coleridge.\r\n\r\nThe book that made his name was his _Confessions of an English\r\nOpium-Eater_ (1821), which appeared in _The London Magazine_. The work,\r\nwhich is chaotic in its general plan, is a series of visions that melt\r\naway in the manner of dreams. Much is tawdry and unreal, but the book\r\ncontains passages of great power and beauty. The remainder of his\r\nwork is a mass of miscellaneous production, the best of which is _The\r\nEnglish Mail-coach_, _Suspiria de Profundis_, and _Murder considered as\r\nOne of the Fine Arts_.\r\n\r\nA great part of his work is dreary and diffuse, and vitiated by a humor\r\nthat is extremely flat and ineffective. He displays a wide range of\r\nknowledge, though it is often flawed with inaccuracy. In style he is\r\napt to stumble into vulgarity and tawdriness; but when inspiration\r\ndescends upon him he gives to the English tongue a wonderful strength\r\nand sweetness. In these rare moments he plunges into an elaborate style\r\nand imagery, but never loses grip, sweeping along with sureness and\r\nease. In rhythm and melody he is almost supreme; he can “blow through\r\nbronze” and “breathe through silver,” and be impressive in both.\r\n\r\nThe passage we now give is among his most impressive efforts. It has\r\nthe unity and passion of the lyric, and its effect is both thrilling\r\nand profound. Observe the studied rhythm, often ejaculatory, the deep\r\nand solemn beauty, and the simplicity of diction. This is poetic prose\r\nat its best:\r\n\r\n   As a final specimen, I cite one of a different character, from\r\n   1820.\r\n\r\n   The dream commenced with a music which now I often heard in\r\n   dreams--a music of preparation and of awakening suspense; a\r\n   music like the opening of the coronation anthem, and which,\r\n   like _that_, gave the feeling of a vast march--of infinite\r\n   cavalcades filing off--and the tread of innumerable armies. The\r\n   morning was come of a mighty day--a day of crisis and of final\r\n   hope for human nature, then suffering some mysterious eclipse,\r\n   and labouring in some dread extremity. Somewhere, I knew not\r\n   where--somehow, I knew not how--by some beings, I knew not\r\n   whom--a battle, a strife, an agony was conducting--was evolving\r\n   like a great drama, or piece of music; with which my sympathy\r\n   was the more insupportable from my confusion as to its place,\r\n   its cause, its nature, and its possible issue. I, as is usual in\r\n   dreams (where, of necessity, we make ourselves central to every\r\n   movement), had the power, and yet had not the power, to decide\r\n   it. I had the power, if I could raise myself, to will it; and\r\n   yet again had not the power, for the weight of twenty Atlantics\r\n   was upon me, or the oppression of inexpiable guilt. “Deeper than\r\n   ever plummet sounded,” I lay inactive.\r\n\r\n   Then, like a chorus, the passion deepened. Some great interest\r\n   was at stake; some mightier cause than ever yet the sword\r\n   had pleaded, or trumpet had proclaimed. Then came sudden\r\n   alarms: hurryings to and fro: trepidations of innumerable\r\n   fugitives, I knew not whether from the good cause or the\r\n   bad: darkness, and lights: tempest, and human faces; and at\r\n   last, with the sense that all was lost, female forms, and the\r\n   features that were worth all the world to me, and but a moment\r\n   allowed,--and clasped hands, and heart-breaking partings, and\r\n   then--everlasting farewells! and with a sigh, such as the caves\r\n   of hell sighed when Sin uttered the abhorred name of Death, the\r\n   sound was reverberated--everlasting farewells! and again, and\r\n   yet again reverberated--everlasting farewells!\r\n\r\n   And I awoke in struggles, and cried aloud--“I will sleep no\r\n   more!”\r\n                       _The Confessions of an English Opium-Eater_\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM HAZLITT (1778–1830)\r\n\r\nThe period now under review is very rich in critical and miscellaneous\r\nwork. Of the writers of literary criticism Hazlitt may be taken as\r\nrepresentative.\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= Hazlitt was born in Shropshire, the son of a\r\nUnitarian minister. His first intention was to be a painter, but he\r\nabandoned the idea and took to letters as a profession. He was a\r\nfriend of Coleridge, with whom he shared an ardent admiration for\r\nrevolutionary principles. This enthusiasm, and others of a similar\r\nnature, Hazlitt was not slack in expressing; and this habit, added to a\r\nbrawling acerbity of temper, made his life largely a series of quarrels\r\nand controversies.\r\n\r\n=2. His Works.= His output was very large, and included many political\r\nworks. Those that are of importance here are _The Characters of\r\nShakespeare’s Plays_ (1817), _Lectures on the English Poets_ (1818),\r\nand _The Spirit of the Age_ (1825). His longest work was the _Life of\r\nNapoleon_ (1828) but it was of no great value.\r\n\r\nHazlitt’s criticism, though it is limited in scope to English\r\nliterature, shows great ability, shrewd insight, and sanity in its\r\nenthusiasms. It is far more precise and equable than that of Coleridge,\r\nbroader and more incisive than Lamb’s, and much more reasoned and\r\nscientific than De Quincey’s. It is often spoilt by his political\r\nviews, but when they are allowed for it can be trusted to a great\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nHis style is admirable for his purpose. It is readable and clear,\r\nand when necessary it can rise into expressing the keen zest that\r\nHazlitt felt for the good and the wholesome in English literature. The\r\nfollowing extract is of interest as a comparison of Addison and Steele:\r\n\r\n   It may be said, that all this is to be found, in the same or a\r\n   greater degree, in the _Spectator_. For myself, I do not think\r\n   so; or, at least, there is in the last work a much greater\r\n   proportion of commonplace matter. I have, on this account,\r\n   always preferred the _Tatler_ to the _Spectator_. Whether\r\n   it is owing to my having been earlier or better acquainted\r\n   with the one than the other, my pleasure in reading these two\r\n   admirable works is not at all in proportion to their comparative\r\n   reputation. The _Tatler_ contains only half the number of\r\n   volumes, and, I will venture to say, at least an equal quantity\r\n   of sterling wit and sense. “The first sprightly runnings” are\r\n   there--it has more of the original spirit, more of the freshness\r\n   and stamp of nature. The indications of character and strokes\r\n   of humour are more true and frequent; the reflections that\r\n   suggest themselves arise more from the occasion, and are less\r\n   spun out into regular dissertations. They are more like the\r\n   remarks which occur in sensible conversation, and less like a\r\n   lecture. Something is left to the understanding of the reader.\r\n   Steele seems to have gone into his closet chiefly to set down\r\n   what he observed out of doors. Addison seems to have spent most\r\n   of his time in his study, and to have spun out and wire-drawn\r\n   the hints, which he borrowed from Steele, or took from nature,\r\n   to the utmost. I am far from wishing to depreciate Addison’s\r\n   talents, but I am anxious to do justice to Steele, who was,\r\n   I think, upon the whole, a less artificial and more original\r\n   writer. The humorous descriptions of Steele resemble loose\r\n   sketches, or fragments of a comedy; those of Addison are rather\r\n   comments, or ingenious paraphrases, on the genuine text.\r\n                                   _The English Comic Writers_\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER WRITERS OF MISCELLANEOUS PROSE\r\n\r\n=1. Francis Jeffrey (1773–1850)=, one of the founders of _The\r\nEdinburgh Review_, was born at Edinburgh, educated at the high\r\nschool and university of his native city, and was called to the\r\nScottish Bar. Though for many years an industrious writer for his\r\njournal, he maintained a considerable legal practice, and distinguished\r\nhimself in politics as an ardent Whig and a supporter of the Reform\r\nBill of 1832. When, after the passage of the Bill, his party came into\r\noffice he was rewarded by being appointed Lord Advocate. This meant the\r\nabandonment of his position on the _Review_, though he always kept\r\na paternal eye on its progress. He was finally appointed to the Bench,\r\nwith the title of Lord Jeffrey.\r\n\r\n_The Edinburgh Review_ was at first a joint production of a group\r\nof young and zealous Whigs, including Sydney Smith and Dr. John Brown.\r\nAfter the first number Jeffrey was in sole control, and he drew around\r\nhim a band of distinguished contributors, including at one time Sir\r\nWalter Scott and Lockhart. The journal led the way among the larger\r\nreviews, and was noted for its briskness. It was not above prejudice,\r\nas was shown in its opposition to the Lake School, but it did much to\r\nraise the standard of criticism, and it succeeded in bringing much\r\ntalent to light, including the early efforts of Macaulay.\r\n\r\n=2. Sydney Smith (1771–1845)= was for a time a colleague of Jeffrey.\r\nHe was born in Essex, and was the son of a clergyman. He was educated\r\nat Winchester and Oxford, and became a clergyman in his turn. After\r\ntraveling on the Continent as a tutor, he settled for a time at\r\nEdinburgh, and assisted in the launching of _The Edinburgh Review_\r\n(1802). He took a large share in the political squabbles of the time,\r\nand wrote much on behalf of the Whig party.\r\n\r\nHis works consist of many miscellaneous pieces, most of them of a\r\npolitical character. The most noteworthy of them is a collection called\r\n_The Letters of Peter Plymley_ (1807), which deals with Catholic\r\nEmancipation. A more general selection from his writings was published\r\nin 1855, and his _Wit and Wisdom_ in 1861. Nowadays it is somewhat\r\ndifficult to account for his great influence, for he has left so little\r\nof real merit; but to his own contemporaries he was a very important\r\nperson. He was admired and feared as a wit, and some of his best\r\nwitticisms have been preserved. He was always a gentlemanly opponent,\r\nalways easy but deadly in the shafts leveled against his political\r\nfoes. He wrote the prose of an educated man, and is clear and forcible.\r\n\r\n=3. John Wilson (1785–1854)=, who appears in literature as\r\n=Christopher North=, was born at Paisley, the son of a wealthy\r\nmanufacturer. He was educated at Glasgow and Oxford, wrote poetry,\r\nand for a time settled in the Lake District. He lost most of his\r\nmoney, tried practice as a barrister, and then joined the staff of\r\n_Blackwood’s Magazine_. He was appointed in 1820 Professor of\r\nMoral Philosophy at Edinburgh University.\r\n\r\nHis early poems, _The Isle of Palms_ (1812) and _The City of the\r\nPlague_ (1816), are passable verse of the romantic type. His\r\nnovels--for example, _The Trials of Margaret Lyndsay_ (1823)--are\r\nsentimental pictures of Scottish life. His longest work, and the one\r\nthat perpetuates his name, is his _Noctes Ambrosianæ_ (beginning in\r\n1822), which had a long and popular run in _Blackwood’s_. This is\r\nan immensely long series of dialogues on many kinds of subjects.\r\nThe characters are the members of a small club who meet regularly,\r\nconsume great quantities of meat and drink, and frequently indulge in\r\nimmoderate clowning. The talk is endless, and is often tedious in the\r\nextreme. At times Wilson rises into striking descriptive passages,\r\nmore florid and less impressive than De Quincey’s, but beautiful in a\r\nsentimental fashion. His taste, however, cannot be trusted, and his\r\nhumor is too often crude and boisterous.\r\n\r\n=4. John G. Lockhart (1794–1854)= was born at Cambusnethan, educated at\r\nGlasgow and Oxford, and became a member of the Scottish Bar. He soon\r\n(1817) became a regular contributor to _Blackwood’s Magazine_, sharing\r\nin its strong Tory views and its still stronger expression of them. He\r\nrather gloried in these literary and political fisticuffs, which in one\r\ncase led to actual bloodshed, though he did not participate in it. In\r\n1820 he married Scott’s favorite daughter Sophia, and lived to be the\r\nbiographer of his famous father-in-law. He was editor of _The Quarterly\r\nReview_ from 1826 till 1852.\r\n\r\nLockhart wrote four novels, the best of which are _Valerius_ (1821)\r\nand _Adam Blair_ (1822). They are painstaking endeavors, but they\r\nlack the fire of genius, and are now almost forgotten. His poetry is\r\nquite lively and attractive, especially his _Spanish Ballads_ (1821).\r\n_Peter’s Letters to his Kinsfolk_ (1819) is a collection of brilliant\r\nsketches of Edinburgh society. Lockhart’s fame, however, rests on _The\r\nLife of Scott_ (1837–38), which was first published in seven volumes.\r\nThis book ranks as one of the great biographies in the language. Though\r\nit is full of intimate and loving detail, it possesses a fine sense\r\nof perspective and coherence; and while it is influenced by a natural\r\npartiality for its subject, the story is judiciously told. In this book\r\nLockhart casts aside his aggressiveness of manner. His descriptions,\r\nas, for example, that of the death of Scott, have a masterly touch.\r\n\r\n=5. William Cobbett (1762–1835)= was born at Farnham, Surrey, and\r\nwas the son of a farm-laborer. He enlisted in the Army, rose to be\r\nsergeant-major, emigrated to America, where he took to journalism, and\r\nreturned to England, to become actively engaged in politics. In 1835 he\r\nwas elected to Parliament, but was not a success as a public man. He\r\nwas a man of violent opinions, boxed the political compass, and died an\r\nextreme Radical.\r\n\r\nHe was an assiduous journalist, beginning with _Peter Porcupine’s\r\nJournal_ (1801). His other paper was his _Political Register_, which he\r\nbegan in 1802 and carried on till 1835. His further literary work is\r\ncontained in his _Rural Rides in England_. He writes with an unaffected\r\nsimplicity that reminds the reader of Bunyan, and his descriptions of\r\ncontemporary England are clear and forcible.\r\n\r\n=6.= The =historians= belonging to this period are both numerous and\r\nimportant, but we can mention only a few.\r\n\r\n(_a_) =Henry Hart Milman (1791–1868)= was educated at Eton and Oxford,\r\nand afterward wrote some plays, including the tragedy _Fazio_ (1817).\r\nHis chief historical works are _The History of the Jews_ (1829) and\r\n_The History of Latin Christianity_ (1856). Milman is a solid and\r\nreliable historian, with a readable style.\r\n\r\n(_b_) =George Grote (1794–1871)= was a London banker, and entered\r\npolitics. His _History of Greece_ (1846–56) is based on German\r\nresearch, and is well informed and scholarly. The work, however, is\r\nsometimes considered to be too long and tedious in its detail.\r\n\r\n(_c_) =Henry Hallam (1777–1859)= was a member of the Middle Temple,\r\nbut he practiced very little. He wrote on both literary and historical\r\nsubjects, and contributed to _The Edinburgh Review_. His historical\r\nworks include _A Constitutional History of England_ (1827) and _An\r\nIntroduction to the Literature of Europe_ (1838–39). Hallam acquired\r\na great and deserved reputation for solid scholarship. Like Gibbon,\r\nhe tried to attune his style to his subject, and wrote in a grave and\r\nimpressive manner, but, lacking the genius of Gibbon, he succeeded only\r\nin making his style lifeless and frigid.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF LITERARY FORMS\r\n\r\nThe amount of actual development during this period was not so great\r\nas the immense output. Authors were content with the standard literary\r\nforms, and it was upon these as models that the development took place.\r\n\r\n=1. Poetry.= (_a_) This was indeed the golden age of the _lyric_,\r\nwhich reflected the Romantic spirit of the time in liberal and varied\r\nmeasure. It comprised the exalted passion of Shelley, the meditative\r\nsimplicity of Wordsworth, the sumptuous descriptions of Keats, and the\r\ngolden notes of Coleridge. It is to be noted that in form the lyric\r\nemployed the ancient externals of the stereotyped meters and rhymes.\r\nThere was some attempt at rhymeless poems in the work of Southey and\r\nthe early poems of Shelley, but this practice was never general.\r\n\r\n(_b_) With _descriptive and narrative poems_ the age was richly\r\nendowed. One has only to recall Byron’s early work, Keats’s tales,\r\nColeridge’s supernatural stories, and Scott’s martial and historical\r\nromances to perceive how rich was the harvest. Once more the poets\r\nwork upon older methods. The Spenserian stanza is the favorite model,\r\nbut the ballad is nearly as popular. These older types suffered some\r\nchange, as was almost inevitable with such inspired minds at work\r\nupon them. The Spenserian manner was loosened and strengthened; it was\r\ngiven richer and more varied beauties in _The Eve of St. Agnes_, and\r\na sharper and more personal note in the _Childe Harold_ of Byron. In\r\nthe case of Wordsworth we observe the frequent use of blank verse for\r\nmeditative purposes, as in _The Prelude_.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Satirical poems_ were numerous; and their tone was fierce, for\r\nthe success of the French Revolution led to the expression of new hopes\r\nand desires. Outstanding examples were Byron’s _Don Juan_ and _The\r\nVision of Judgment_ and Shelley’s _Masque of Anarchy_.\r\n\r\n=2. Drama.= Drama was written as freely as ever, but rather as a form\r\nof literary exercise than as a serious attempt at creating a new\r\ndramatic standard. Tragedy almost monopolized the activities of the\r\nmajor poets. Of all the tragedies Shelley’s _Cenci_ came first in power\r\nand simplicity. Byron’s tragedies had little merit as dramas; and\r\nWordsworth’s _Borderers_ and Coleridge’s _Remorse_ added little to the\r\nfame of their authors.\r\n\r\nThe comic spirit in drama was in abeyance. Shelley’s _Œdipus Tyrannus,\r\nor Swellfoot the Tyrant_, is almost the only instance of it worth\r\nmention, and this was a poor specimen of that writer’s creative power.\r\n\r\n=3. Prose.= (_a_) _The Novel._ Of the different kinds of prose\r\ncomposition, the novel showed in this period the most marked\r\ndevelopment. This was largely due to the work of Scott and Jane Austen,\r\nwho respectively established the historical and domestic types of novel.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the work of Scott, we can here only briefly summarize\r\nwhat has already been said. He raised the historical novel to the rank\r\nof one of the major kinds of literature; he brought to it knowledge,\r\nand through the divine gift of knowledge made it true to life; he fired\r\nhistorical characters with living energy; he set on foot the device\r\nof the unhistorical hero--that is, he made the chief character purely\r\nfictitious, and caused the historical persons to rotate about it; he\r\nestablished a style that suited many periods of history; and pervading\r\nall these advances was a great and genial personality that transformed\r\nwhat might have been mere lumber into an artistic product of truth and\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nMiss Austen’s achievement was of a different kind. She revealed the\r\nbeauty and interest that underlie ordinary affairs; she displayed the\r\ninfinite variety of common life, and so she opened an inexhaustible\r\nvein that her successors were assiduously to develop.\r\n\r\nMost of the other novelists of the time were either imitators of Scott,\r\nlike James and Ainsworth, or a combination of Scott and Miss Austen,\r\nlike Bulwer-Lytton. Disraeli developed a rather different species in\r\nhis brilliant society novels, which depended for their chief effects\r\non satiric insight and caustic epigram. _Tancred_ is probably the\r\nbest of this species.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Periodical Literature._ At the beginning of this chapter we\r\nnoted the chief members of a great new community of literary journals.\r\nThese periodicals were of a new type. Previous literary journals, like\r\n_The Gentleman’s Magazine_ (1731), had been feeble productions, the\r\nwork of elegant amateurs or underpaid hack-writers. Such papers had\r\nlittle weight. The new journals were supreme in the literary world;\r\nthey attracted the best talent; they inspired fear and respect; and\r\nin spite of many defects their literary product was worthy of their\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _The Essay._ Finding a fresh outlet in the new type of\r\nperiodical, the essay acquired additional importance. The purely\r\nliterary essay, exemplified in the works of Southey, Hazlitt,\r\nand Lockhart, increased in length and solidity. It now became a\r\nreview--that is, a commentary on a book or books under immediate\r\ninspection, but in addition expounding the wider theories and opinions\r\nof the reviewer. This new species of essay was to be developed still\r\nfurther in the works of Carlyle and Macaulay.\r\n\r\nThe miscellaneous essay, represented in the works of Lamb, likewise,\r\nacquired an increased dignity. It was growing beyond the limits set by\r\nAddison and Johnson. It was more labored and aspiring, and contained\r\nmany more mannerisms of the author. This kind also was to develop in\r\nthe hands of the succeeding generation.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Other prose works must receive scanty notice. The art of\r\nletter-writing still flourished, as can be seen in the works of Byron,\r\nShelley, and Lamb. Lamb in particular has a charm that reminds the\r\nreader of that of Cowper. Byron’s letters, though egotistical enough,\r\nare breezy and humorous.\r\n\r\nBiographical work is adequately represented in _The Life of Byron_,\r\nby Moore, and _The Life of Scott_, by Lockhart. These books in their\r\ngeneral outlines follow the model of Boswell, though they do not\r\npossess the artless self-revelation of their great predecessor.\r\nThere is an advance shown by their division into chapters and other\r\nconvenient stages, a useful arrangement that Boswell did not adopt.\r\n\r\nThe amount of historical research was very great, and the historians\r\nranged abroad and tilled many fields; but in their general methods\r\nthere was little advance on the work of their predecessors.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF LITERARY STYLE\r\n\r\n=1. Poetry.= This period being instinct with the spirit of revolt,\r\nit may be taken for granted that in poetic style there is a great range\r\nof effort and experiment. The general tendency is toward simplicity\r\nof diction and away from the mannerisms of the eighteenth century. In\r\nthe case of the major poets, the one who comes nearest in style to the\r\neighteenth century is Byron; next to him, in spite of his theories of\r\nsimplicity, comes Wordsworth, who has a curious inflation of style that\r\nis kept within bounds only by his intense imaginative power. The best\r\nwork of Coleridge and Shelley is marked by the greatest simplicity;\r\nbut, on the other hand, Keats is too fond of golden diction to resist\r\nthe temptation to be ornate.\r\n\r\n=2. Prose.= In this period we behold the dissolution of the more\r\nformal prose style of the previous century. With this process the\r\njournalists and miscellaneous prose-writers have much to do. In the\r\nplace of the older type we see a general tendency toward a useful\r\nmiddle style, as in the books of Southey and Hazlitt. Outside this\r\nmass of middle prose we have a range from the greatest simplicity to\r\nthe highest efforts of poetic prose. At one end of the scale we have\r\nthe perfectly plain style of Cobbett. The passage we give (from the\r\n_Rural Rides_) could not be simpler, but it is energetic and\r\nexpressive:\r\n\r\n   When I returned to England in 1800, after an absence from the\r\n   country parts of it for sixteen years, the trees, the hedges,\r\n   even the parks and woods, seemed so small! It made me laugh to\r\n   hear little gutters, that I could jump over, called rivers. The\r\n   Thames was but a ‘creek!’ But when in about a month after my\r\n   arrival in London, I went to Farnham, the place of my birth,\r\n   what was my surprise! Every thing was become so pitifully small!\r\n   I had to cross in my postchaise the long and dreary heath of\r\n   Bagshot. Then at the end of it, to mount a hill called Hungry\r\n   Hill: and from that hill I knew that I should look down into the\r\n   beautiful and fertile vale of Farnham. My heart fluttered with\r\n   impatience, mixed with a sort of fear, to see all the scenes of\r\n   my childhood; for I had learned before the death of my father\r\n   and mother.\r\n\r\nFrom Cobbett we range through a large number of writers, like Lockhart\r\nand Miss Austen, who write in the usual middle style to the more\r\nlabored manner of Scott, who in his descriptive passages adopts a kind\r\nof Johnsonese. When he writes in the Scots dialect he writes simply\r\nand clearly, but in his heavier moods we have a style like that which\r\nfollows. Note the long and complicated sentences, and the labored\r\ndiction.\r\n\r\n   The brow of the hill, on which the Royal Life-Guards were now\r\n   drawn up, sloped downwards (on the side opposite to that which\r\n   they had ascended) with a gentle declivity for more than a\r\n   quarter of a mile, and presented ground which, though unequal in\r\n   some places, was not altogether unfavourable for the manœuvres\r\n   of cavalry, until near the bottom, when the slope terminated\r\n   in a marshy level, traversed through its whole length by what\r\n   seemed either a natural gully or a deep artificial drain, the\r\n   sides of which were broken by springs, trenches filled with\r\n   water, out of which peats and turf had been dug, and here\r\n   and there by some straggling thickets of alders, which loved\r\n   the moistness so well that they continued to live as bushes,\r\n   although too much dwarfed by the sour soil and the stagnant\r\n   bog-water to ascend into trees. Beyond this ditch or gully the\r\n   ground arose into a second heathy swell, or rather hill, near to\r\n   the foot of which, and as if with the object of defending the\r\n   broken ground and ditch that covered their front, the body of\r\n   insurgents appeared to be drawn up with the purpose of abiding\r\n   battle.\r\n                                                 _Old Mortality_\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Scott the evolution of style can be traced through the mannered,\r\nhalf-humorous ornateness of Lamb to the florid poetic prose of Wilson\r\nand the dithyrambic periods of De Quincey. As a final specimen we give\r\nan extract from the _Noctes Ambrosianæ_. The style is fervidly\r\nexclamatory, but it lacks the depth of De Quincey’s at its best.\r\n\r\n   _Shepherd._ Oh that I had been a sailor! To hae\r\n   circumnavigated the world! To hae pitched our tents, or built\r\n   our bowers, on the shores o’ bays sae glittering wi’ league-long\r\n   wreaths o’ shells, that the billows blushed crimson as they\r\n   murmured! To hae seen our flags burning meteor-like, high up\r\n   among the primeval woods, while birds, bright as bunting, sat\r\n   trimming their plumage amang the cordage, sae tame in that\r\n   island where ship had haply never touched before, nor ever might\r\n   touch again, lying in a latitude by itself, and far out of the\r\n   breath o’ the tradewinds! Or to hae landed with a’ the crew,\r\n   marines and a’--except a guard on shipboard to keep aff the\r\n   crowd o’ canoes--on some warlike isle, tossing wi’ the plumes on\r\n   chieftain’s heads, and sound--sound--sounding wi’ gongs! What’s\r\n   a man-o’-war’s barge, Mr Tickler, beautiful sight tho’ it be, to\r\n   the hundred-oared canoe o’ some savage Island-king!\r\n\r\n\r\n         TABLE TO ILLUSTRATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF LITERARY FORMS\r\n\r\n    +----+------------------------------------------------+--------------------------+-----------------------------------------+\r\n    |    |                     POETRY                     |           DRAMA          |                  PROSE                  |                         |                          |                                         |\r\n    |    +-------------+---------------------+------------+------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+\r\n    |DATE|             |                     | Satirical  |            |             |             |             |             |\r\n    |    |    Lyric    |Narrative-Descriptive|    and     |   Comedy   |   Tragedy   |    Novel    |    Essay    |Miscellaneous|\r\n    |    |             |                     | Didactic   |            |             |             |             |             |\r\n    +----+-------------+---------------------+------------+------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+\r\n    |    |             |                     |            |            |             |             |             |             |\r\n    |    |             |                     |            |            |             |             |             |             |\r\n    |    |Wordsworth[198]|                   |            |            |             |             |             |             |\r\n    |    |             |Southey              |            |            |             |J.

Below are given two extracts on autumn, one written by Keats and one\r\nby Shelley. Compare them carefully with regard to selection of details,\r\nstyle, and meter. How far does each reflect the nature of its author?\r\n\r\n    (1) Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness!\r\n        Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;\r\n        Conspiring with him how to load and bless\r\n        With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eaves run;\r\n        To bend with apples the moss’d cottage-trees,\r\n        And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;\r\n        To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells\r\n        With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,\r\n        And still more, later flowers for the bees,\r\n        Until they think warm days will never cease;\r\n        For Summer has o’er-brimmed their clammy cells.\r\n                                          KEATS, _Ode to Autumn_\r\n\r\n    (2) The warm sun is failing, the bleak wind is wailing,\r\n        The bare boughs are sighing, the pale flowers are dying,\r\n                    And the Year\r\n        On the earth her death-bed, in a shroud of leaves dead,\r\n                    Is lying.\r\n                Come, Months, come away,\r\n                From November to May,\r\n                In your saddest array;\r\n                Follow the bier\r\n                Of the dead cold Year,\r\n        And like dim shadows watch by her sepulchre.\r\n                                     SHELLEY, _Autumn: A Dirge_\r\n\r\n2. From an examination of the following extracts, and from what has\r\nalready been said regarding their respective authors, write a brief\r\naccount of the style of the authors. How do the extracts compare as\r\nregards clearness, lucidity, and melody?\r\n\r\n   (1) During the first year that Mr Wordsworth and I were\r\n   neighbours, our conversations turned frequently on the two\r\n   cardinal points of poetry, the power of exciting the sympathy of\r\n   the reader by a faithful adherence to the truth of nature, and\r\n   the power of giving the interest of novelty by the modifying\r\n   colours of imagination. The sudden charm, which accidents of\r\n   light and shade, which moonlight or sunset diffused over a known\r\n   and familiar landscape, appeared to represent the practicability\r\n   of combining both. These are the poetry of nature. The thought\r\n   suggested itself (to which of us I do not recollect) that a\r\n   series of poems might be composed of two sorts. In the one, the\r\n   incidents and agents were to be, in part at least, supernatural;\r\n   and the excellence aimed at was to consist in the interesting of\r\n   the affections by the dramatic truth of such emotions, as would\r\n   naturally accompany such situations, supposing them real. And\r\n   real in this sense they have been to every human being who, from\r\n   whatever source of delusion, has at any time believed himself\r\n   under supernatural agency. For the second class, subjects were\r\n   to be chosen from ordinary life; the characters and incidents\r\n   were to be such, as will be found in every village and its\r\n   vicinity, where there is a meditative and feeling mind to seek\r\n   after them, or to notice them, when they present themselves.\r\n                                   COLERIDGE, _Biographia Literaria_\r\n\r\n\r\n   (2) I thought that it was a Sunday morning in May, that it was\r\n   Easter Sunday, and as yet very early in the morning. I was\r\n   standing, as it seemed to me, at the door of my own cottage.\r\n   Right before me lay the very scene which could really be\r\n   commanded from that situation, but exalted, as was usual,\r\n   and solemnised by the power of dreams. There were the same\r\n   mountains, and the same lovely valley at their feet; but the\r\n   mountains were raised to more than alpine height, and there\r\n   was interspace far larger between them of meadows and forest\r\n   lawns; the hedges were rich with white roses; and no living\r\n   creature was to be seen, excepting that in the green churchyard\r\n   there were cattle tranquilly reposing upon the verdant graves,\r\n   and particularly round about the grave of a child whom I had\r\n   tenderly loved, just as I had really beheld them, a little\r\n   before sunrise in the same summer, when that child died.\r\n                                           DE QUINCEY,\r\n                      _The Confessions of an English Opium-Eater_\r\n\r\n\r\n   (3) When a child, what a mysterious pleasure it was to witness\r\n   their operation!--to see a chit no bigger than one’s-self enter,\r\n   one knew not by what process, into what seemed the _fauces\r\n   Averni_--to pursue him in imagination, as he went sounding\r\n   on through so many dark stifling caverns, horrid shades!--to\r\n   shudder with the idea that “now, surely, he must be lost for\r\n   ever!”--to revive at hearing his feeble shout of discovered\r\n   daylight--and then (O fulness of delight!) running out of doors,\r\n   to come just in time to see the sable phenomenon emerge in\r\n   safety, the brandished weapon of his art victorious like some\r\n   flag waved over a conquered citadel! I seem to remember having\r\n   been told that a bad sweep was once left in a stack with his\r\n   brush, to indicate which way the wind blew. It was an awful\r\n   spectacle certainly; not much unlike the old stage direction in\r\n   _Macbeth_, where the “Apparition of a child crowned, with a\r\n   tree in his hand, rises.”\r\n                         LAMB, _The Praise of Chimney-Sweepers_\r\n\r\n\r\n   (4) If a young reader should ask, after all, What is the best\r\n   way of knowing bad poets from good, the best poets from the\r\n   next best, and so on? the answer is, the only and two-fold\r\n   way; first, the perusal of the best poets with the greatest\r\n   attention; and second, the cultivation of that love of truth\r\n   and beauty which made them what they are. Every true reader of\r\n   poetry partakes of a more than ordinary portion of the poetic\r\n   nature; and no one can be completely such, who does not love,\r\n   or take an interest in everything that interests the poet, from\r\n   the firmament to the daisy--from the highest heart of man, to\r\n   the most pitiable of the low. It is a good practice to read\r\n   with pen in hand, marking what is liked or doubted. It rivets\r\n   the attention, realises the greatest amount of enjoyment, and\r\n   facilitates reference. It enables the reader also, from time to\r\n   time, to see what progress he makes with his own mind, and how\r\n   it grows up to the stature of its exalter.\r\n                                          LEIGH HUNT, _Letters_\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Each of the following extracts from narrative poetry is an example\r\nof the Romantic style. How is the Romantic spirit revealed in each, and\r\nhow far is each different from the others?\r\n\r\n    (1) The moving Moon went up the sky,\r\n        And nowhere did abide:\r\n        Softly she was going up,\r\n        And a star or two beside--\r\n\r\n        Her beams bemock’d the sultry main,\r\n        Like April hoar-frost spread;\r\n        But where the ship’s huge shadow lay,\r\n        The charmed water burnt alway\r\n        A still and awful red.\r\n\r\n        Beyond the shadow of the ship,\r\n        I watch’d the water-snakes:\r\n        They mov’d in tracks of shining white,\r\n        And when they rear’d, the elfish light\r\n        Fell off in hoary flakes.\r\n\r\n        Within the shadow of the ship\r\n        I watch’d their rich attire:\r\n        Blue, glossy green, and velvet black,\r\n        They coil’d and swam; and every track\r\n        Was a flash of golden fire.\r\n            COLERIDGE, _The Rime of the Ancient Mariner_\r\n\r\n    (2) And still she slept an azure-lidded sleep,\r\n        In blanched linen, smooth, and lavendered,\r\n        While he forth from the closet brought a heap\r\n        Of candied apple, quince, and plum, and gourd,\r\n        With jellies soother than the creamy curd,\r\n        And lucent syrops, tinct with cinnamon,\r\n        Manna and dates, in argosy transferred\r\n        From Fez; and spiced dainties, every one,\r\n      From silken Samarcand to cedared Lebanon.\r\n                         KEATS, _The Eve of St. Agnes_\r\n\r\n    (3) Like adder darting from his coil,\r\n        Like wolf that dashes through the toil,\r\n        Like mountain-cat who guards her young,\r\n        Full at Fitz-James’s throat he sprung;\r\n        Received, but recked not of a wound,\r\n        And locked his arms his foeman round.\r\n        Now, gallant Saxon, hold thine own!\r\n        No maiden’s hand is round thee thrown!\r\n        That desperate grasp thy frame might feel,\r\n        Through bars of brass and triple steel!\r\n        They tug, they strain; down, down they go,\r\n        The Gael above, Fitz-James below!\r\n        The Chieftain’s gripe his throat compressed,\r\n        His knee was planted on his breast;\r\n        His clotted locks he backward threw,\r\n        Across his brow his hand he drew,\r\n        From blood and mist to clear his sight,\r\n        Then gleamed aloft his dagger bright!\r\n                        SCOTT, _The Lady of the Lake_\r\n\r\n    (4) While thus they spake, the angelic caravan,\r\n          Arriving like a rush of mighty wind,\r\n        Cleaving the fields of space, as doth the swan\r\n          Some silver stream (say Ganges, Nile, or Inde,\r\n        Or Thames, or Tweed), and ’midst them an old man\r\n          With an old soul, and both extremely blind,\r\n        Halted before the gate, and in his shroud\r\n        Seated their fellow traveller on a cloud.\r\n\r\n        But bringing up the rear of this bright host\r\n          A Spirit of a different aspect waved\r\n        His wings, like thunder-clouds above some coast\r\n          Whose barren beach with frequent wrecks is paved;\r\n        His brow was like the deep when tempest-toss’d;\r\n          Fierce and unfathomable thoughts engraved\r\n        Eternal wrath on his immortal face,\r\n        And _where_ he gazed a gloom pervaded space.\r\n                           BYRON, _The Vision of Judgment_\r\n\r\n4. The two following extracts represent two styles used by Scott. How\r\nfar is each appropriate to the characters, the period, and the occasion\r\nof each novel? Which seems the more natural? How does this compare with\r\nShakespeare’s use of prose and blank verse in his plays?\r\n\r\n   (1) “Od, here’s another,” quoth Mrs Mailsetter. “A\r\n   ship-letter--post-mark, Sunderland.” All rushed to seize\r\n   it.--“Na, na, leddies,” said Mrs Mailsetter, interfering; “I hae\r\n   had eneugh o’ that wark--ken ye that Mr Mailsetter got an unco\r\n   rebuke frae the secretary at Edinburgh, for a complaint that\r\n   was made about the letter of Aily Bisset’s that ye opened, Mrs\r\n   Shortcake?”\r\n\r\n   “Me opened!” answered the spouse of the chief baker of Fairport;\r\n   “ye ken yoursel’, madam, it just cam open o’ free will in my\r\n   hand--what could I help it?--folk suld seal wi’ better wax.”\r\n\r\n   “Weel I wot that’s true, too,” said Mrs Mailsetter, who kept a\r\n   shop of small wares, “and we have got some that I can honestly\r\n   recommend, if ye ken onybody wanting it. But the short and the\r\n   lang o’t is, that we’ll lose the place gin there’s ony mair\r\n   complaints o’ the kind.”\r\n\r\n   “Hout, lass--the provost will take care o’ that.”\r\n\r\n   “Na, na--I’ll neither trust to provost nor bailie,” said the\r\n   postmistress,--“but I wad ay be obliging and neighbourly,\r\n   and I’m no again your looking at the outside of a letter\r\n   neither.--See, the seal has an anchor on’t--he’s done’t wi’ ane\r\n   o’ his buttons, I’m thinking.”\r\n                                              _The Antiquary_\r\n\r\n\r\n   (2) “And these are all nobles of Araby?” said Richard, looking\r\n   around on wild forms with their persons covered with haiks,\r\n   their countenances swart with the sunbeams, their teeth as\r\n   white as ivory, their black eyes glancing with fierce and\r\n   preternatural lustre from under the shade of their turbans, and\r\n   their dress being in general simple, even to meanness.\r\n\r\n   “They claim such rank,” said Saladin; “but, though numerous,\r\n   they are within the conditions of the treaty, and bear no arms\r\n   but the sabre--even the iron of their lances is left behind.”\r\n\r\n   “I fear,” muttered De Vaux in English, “they have left them\r\n   where they can be soon found.--A most flourishing House of\r\n   Peers, I confess, and would find Westminster Hall something too\r\n   narrow for them.”\r\n\r\n   “Hush, De Vaux,” said Richard, “I command thee.--Noble\r\n   Saladin,” he said, “suspicion and thou cannot exist on the same\r\n   ground.--Seest thou,” pointing to the litters--“I too have\r\n   brought some champions with me, though armed, perhaps, in breach\r\n   of agreement, for bright eyes and fair features are weapons\r\n   which cannot be left behind.”\r\n                                                    _The Talisman_\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Compare Wordsworth’s view of nature with that of Byron, as revealed\r\nin the two following extracts. Which view seems to be the deeper and\r\nclearer? How far does each reflect the life and habits of the author?\r\n\r\n    (1)                     The sounding cataract\r\n        Haunted me like a passion; the tall rock,\r\n        The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,\r\n        Their colours and their forms, were then to me\r\n        An appetite; a feeling and a love\r\n        That had no need of a remoter charm,\r\n        By thought supplied, or any interest\r\n        Unborrowed from the eye. That time is past,\r\n        And all its aching joys are now no more,\r\n        And all its dizzy raptures. Not for this\r\n        Faint I, nor mourn, nor murmur; other gifts\r\n        Have followed,--for such loss, I would believe,\r\n        Abundant recompense. For I have learned\r\n        To look on nature, not as in the hour\r\n        Of thoughtless youth, but hearing oftentimes\r\n        The still, sad music of humanity,\r\n        Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power\r\n        To chasten and subdue.\r\n                                 WORDSWORTH, _Tintern Abbey_\r\n\r\n    (2) And I have loved thee, Ocean! and my joy\r\n        Of youthful sports was on thy breast to be\r\n        Borne like thy bubbles, onward: from a boy\r\n        I wantoned with thy breakers, they to me\r\n        Were a delight; and if the freshening sea\r\n        Made them a terror,’twas a pleasing fear,\r\n        For I was as it were a child of thee,\r\n        And trusted to thy billows far and near,\r\n      And laid my hand upon thy mane--as I do here.\r\n                       BYRON, _Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage_\r\n\r\n6.

An Era of Peace.= The few colonial wars that broke out during\r\nthe Victorian epoch did not seriously disturb the national life.\r\nThere was one Continental war that directly affected Britain--the\r\nCrimean War--and one that affected her indirectly though strongly--the\r\nFranco-German struggle; yet neither of these caused any profound\r\nchanges. In America the great civil struggle left scars that were soon\r\nto be obliterated by the wise statesmanship of her rulers. The whole\r\nage may be not unfairly described as one of peaceful activity. In the\r\nearlier stages the lessening surges of the French Revolution were still\r\nleft; but by the middle of the century they had almost completely died\r\ndown, and other hopes and ideals, largely pacific, were gradually\r\ntaking their place.\r\n\r\n=2. Material Developments.= It was an age alive with new activities.\r\nThere was a revolution in commercial enterprise, due to the great\r\nincrease of available markets, and, as a result of this, an immense\r\nadvance in the use of mechanical devices. The new commercial energy was\r\nreflected in the Great Exhibition of 1851, which was greeted as the\r\ninauguration of a new era of prosperity.\r\n\r\n=3. Intellectual Developments.= There can be little doubt that\r\nin many cases material wealth produced a hardness of temper and an\r\nimpatience of projects and ideas that brought no return in hard cash;\r\nyet it is to the credit of this age that intellectual activities\r\nwere so numerous. There was quite a revolution in scientific thought\r\nfollowing upon the works of Darwin and his school, and an immense\r\noutburst of social and political theorizing which was represented in\r\nEngland by the writings of men like Herbert Spencer and John Stuart\r\nMill. In addition, popular education became a practical thing. This\r\nin its turn produced a new hunger for intellectual food, and resulted\r\nin a great increase in the productions of the Press and of other more\r\ndurable species of literature.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY FEATURES OF THE AGE\r\n\r\nThe sixty years (1830–90) commonly included under the name of the\r\nVictorian age present many dissimilar features; yet in several respects\r\nwe can safely generalize.\r\n\r\n=1. Its Morality.= Nearly all observers of the Victorian age are\r\nstruck by its extreme deference to the conventions. To a later age\r\nthese seem ludicrous. It was thought indecorous for a man to smoke in\r\npublic and (much later in the century) for a lady to ride a bicycle.\r\nTo a great extent the new morality was a natural revolt against the\r\ngrossness of the earlier Regency, and the influence of the Victorian\r\nCourt was all in its favor. In literature it is amply reflected.\r\nTennyson is the most conspicuous example in poetry, creating the\r\npriggishly complacent Sir Galahad and King Arthur. Dickens, perhaps the\r\nmost representative of the Victorian novelists, took for his model the\r\nold picaresque novel; but it is almost laughable to observe his anxiety\r\nto be “moral.” This type of writing is quite blameless, but it produced\r\nthe kind of public that denounced the innocuous _Jane Eyre_ as\r\nwicked because it dealt with the harmless affection of a girl for a\r\nmarried man.\r\n\r\n=2. The Revolt.= Many writers protested against the deadening\r\neffects of the conventions. Carlyle and Matthew Arnold, in their\r\ndifferent accents, were loud in their denunciations; Thackeray never\r\ntired of satirizing the snobbishness of the age; and Browning’s cobbly\r\nmannerisms were an indirect challenge to the velvety diction and\r\nthe smooth self-satisfaction of the Tennysonian school. As the age\r\nproceeded the reaction strengthened. In poetry the Pre-Raphaelites, led\r\nby Swinburne and William Morris, proclaimed no morality but that of\r\nthe artist’s regard for his art. By the vigor of his methods Swinburne\r\nhorrified the timorous, and made himself rather ridiculous in the eyes\r\nof sensible people. It remained for Mr. Hardy (whom we reserve for the\r\nnext chapter) to pull aside the Victorian veils and shutters and with\r\nthe large tolerance of the master to regard men’s actions with open\r\ngaze. To the present day, sometimes wisely, often unwisely, poet and\r\nnovelist have carried on the process; and the end is not yet.\r\n\r\n=3. Intellectual Developments.= The literary product was\r\ninevitably affected by the new ideas in science, religion, and\r\npolitics. _The Origin of Species_ (1859) of Darwin shook to its\r\nfoundations scientific thought. We can perceive the influence of such a\r\nwork in Tennyson’s _In Memoriam_, in Matthew Arnold’s meditative\r\npoetry, and in the works of Carlyle. In religious and ethical thought\r\nthe “Oxford Movement,” as it was called, was the most noteworthy\r\nadvance. This movement had its source among the young and eager\r\nthinkers of the old university, and was headed by the great Newman, who\r\nultimately (1845) joined the Church of Rome. As a religious portent\r\nit marked the widespread discontent with the existing beliefs of the\r\nChurch of England; as a literary influence it affected many writers\r\nof note, including Newman himself, Froude, Maurice, Kingsley, and\r\nGladstone.\r\n\r\n=4. The New Education.= The Education Acts, making a certain\r\nmeasure of education compulsory, rapidly produced an enormous reading\r\npublic. The cheapening of printing and paper increased the demand for\r\nbooks, so that the production was multiplied. The most popular form\r\nof literature was the novel, and the novelists responded with a will.\r\nMuch of their work was of a high standard, so much so that it has been\r\nasserted by competent critics that the middle years of the nineteenth\r\ncentury were the richest in the whole history of the novel.\r\n\r\n=5. International Influences.= During the nineteenth century the\r\ninteraction among American and European writers was remarkably fresh\r\nand strong. In Britain the influence of the great German writers was\r\ncontinuous, and it was championed by Carlyle and Matthew Arnold.\r\nSubject nations, in particular the Italians, were a sympathetic theme\r\nfor prose and verse. The Brownings, Swinburne, Morris, and Meredith\r\nwere deeply absorbed in the long struggle of the followers of Garibaldi\r\nand Cavour; and when Italian freedom was gained the rejoicings were\r\ngenuine.\r\n\r\n=6. The Achievement of the Age.= With all its immense production,\r\nthe age produced no supreme writer. It revealed no Shakespeare, no\r\nShelley, nor (in the international sense) a Byron or a Scott. The\r\ngeneral literary level was, however, very high; and it was an age,\r\nmoreover, of spacious intellectual horizons, noble endeavor, and bright\r\naspirations.\r\n\r\n\r\nALFRED, LORD TENNYSON (1809–92)\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= Alfred Tennyson, the son of a clergyman, was born at\r\nhis father’s living at Somersby in Lincolnshire. After some schooling\r\nat Louth, which was not agreeable to him, he proceeded to Cambridge\r\n(1828). At the university he was a wholly conventional person, and\r\nthe only mark he made was to win the Chancellor’s Prize for a poem\r\non Timbuctoo. He left Cambridge without taking a degree; but before\r\ndoing so he published a small volume of mediocre verse. During the\r\nnext twenty years he passed a tranquil existence, living chiefly with\r\nhis parents, and writing much poetry. Pleasant jaunts--to the Lake\r\nDistrict, to Stratford-on-Avon, and other places--varied his peaceful\r\nlife, and all the while his fame as a poet was making headway. In\r\n1844 he lost most of his small means in an unlucky speculation, but\r\nin the nick of time (1845) he received a Government pension. He was\r\nappointed Poet Laureate (1850) in succession to Wordsworth, married,\r\nand removed to Freshwater, in the Isle of Wight, which was his home for\r\nthe next twenty years. In his later years recognition and applause came\r\nincreasingly upon him, and he was regarded as the greatest poet of his\r\nday. In 1884 he was created a baron, sat in the House of Lords, and for\r\na time took himself rather seriously as a politician, falling out with\r\nGladstone over the Irish question. He died at Aldworth, near Haslemere,\r\nin Surrey, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\n=2. His Poetry.= When he was seventeen years old Tennyson collaborated\r\nwith his elder brother Charles in _Poems by Two Brothers_ (1826).\r\nThe volume is a slight one, but in the light of his later work we\r\ncan already discern a little of the Tennysonian metrical aptitude\r\nand descriptive power. His prize poem of _Timbuctoo_ (1829) is not\r\nmuch better than the usual prize poem. His _Poems, Chiefly Lyrical_\r\n(1830), published while he was an undergraduate, are yet immature, but\r\nin pieces like _Isabel_ and _Madeleine_ the pictorial effect and the\r\nsumptuous imagery of his maturer style are already conspicuous.\r\n\r\nHis volume of _Poems_ (1832) is of a different quality, and marks a\r\ndecided advance. In this book, which contains _Mariana in the South_\r\nand _The Palace of Art_, we see the Tennysonian features approaching\r\nperfection. _Poems_ (1833), with such notable items as _Œnone_ and\r\n_The Lotos-Eaters_, advances still further in technique. Then in 1842\r\nhe produced two volumes of poetry that set him once and for all among\r\nthe greater poets of his day. The first volume contains revised forms\r\nof some of the numbers published previously, the second is entirely\r\nnew. It opens with _Morte d’Arthur_, and contains _Ulysses_, _Locksley\r\nHall_, and several other poems that stand at the summit of his\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\nThe later stages of his career are marked chiefly by much longer poems.\r\n_The Princess_ (1847) is a serio-comic attempt to handle the theme\r\nthat was then known as “the new woman.” For the sake of his story\r\nTennyson imagines a ladies’ academy with a mutinously intellectual\r\nprincess at the head of it. For a space a tragedy seems imminent, but\r\nin the end all is well, for the Princess is married to the blameless\r\nhero. The poem is in blank verse, but interspersed are several\r\nsingularly beautiful lyrics. The humor is heavy, but many of the\r\ndescriptions are as rich and wonderful as any Tennyson ever attempted.\r\n\r\n_In Memoriam_ (1850) caused a great stir when it first appeared.\r\nIt is a very long series of meditations upon the death of Arthur\r\nHenry Hallam, Tennyson’s college friend, who died at Vienna in 1833.\r\nTennyson brooded over the subject for years; and upon this elegiac\r\ntheme he imposed numerous meditations on life and death, showing how\r\nthese subjects were affected by the new theories of the day. To a later\r\ngeneration his ideas appear pallid enough; but at the time they marked\r\na great advance upon the notions of the past. The poem is adorned with\r\nmany beautiful sketches of English scenery; and the meter--now called\r\nthe _In Memoriam_ meter--which is quite rare, is deftly managed.\r\n\r\n_Maud and Other Poems_ (1855) was received with amazement by the\r\npublic. The chief poem is called a “monodrama”; it consists of a series\r\nof lyrics which reflect the love and hatred, the hope and despair, of\r\na lover who slays his mistress’s brother, and then flies broken to\r\nFrance. The whole tone of the work is forced and fevered, and it ends\r\nin a glorification of war and bloodshed. It does not add to Tennyson’s\r\nfame.\r\n\r\nBeginning in 1859, Tennyson issued a series of _Idylls of the\r\nKing_, which had considered and attempted a great theme that Milton\r\nabandoned--that of King Arthur and the Round Table. Many doting\r\nadmirers saw in the _Idylls_ an allegory of the soul of man; but in\r\neffect Tennyson drew largely upon the simple tales of Malory, stripping\r\nthem of their “bold bawdry” to please his public, and covering them\r\nwith a thick coating of his delicate and detailed ornamentation. It is\r\ndoubtful if this unnatural compound of Malory-Tennyson is quite a happy\r\none, but we do obtain much blank verse of noble and sustained power.\r\n\r\nThe only other poem of any length is _Enoch Arden_ (1864), which\r\nbecame the most popular of all, and found its way in translation into\r\nforeign languages. The plot is cheap enough, dealing with a seaman,\r\nsupposedly drowned, who returns and, finding his wife happily married\r\nto another man, regretfully retires without making himself known. The\r\ntale, as ever, is rich with Tennysonian adornment. In particular, there\r\nis a description of the tropical island where Enoch is wrecked that is\r\namong the highest flights of the poet:\r\n\r\n    The mountain wooded to the peak, the lawns\r\n    And winding glades high up like ways to Heaven,\r\n    The slender coco’s drooping crown of plumes,\r\n    The lightning flash of insect and of bird,\r\n    The lustre of the long convolvuluses\r\n    That coiled around the stately stems, and ran\r\n    Even to the limit of the land, the glows\r\n    And glories of the broad belt of the world,\r\n    All these he saw; but what he fain had seen\r\n    He could not see, the kindly human face,\r\n    Nor ever hear a kindly voice, but heard\r\n    The myriad shriek of wheeling ocean-fowl,\r\n    The league-long roller thundering on the reef.\r\n\r\nHis last poems contain a harsher note, as if old age had brought\r\ndisillusion and a peevish discontent with the pleasant artifices that\r\nhad graced his prime. Even the later instalments of the _Idylls of the\r\nKing_ contain jarring notes, and are often fretful and unhappy in tone.\r\nAmong the shorter poems, _Locksley Hall Sixty Years after_ (1885) and\r\n_The Death of Œnone_ (1892) are sad echoes of the sumptuous imaginings\r\nof the years preceding 1842.\r\n\r\n=3. His Plays.= Tennyson’s dramas occupied his later years. He wrote\r\nthree historical plays--_Queen Mary_ (1875), _Harold_ (1877), and\r\n_Becket_ (1884). The last, owing chiefly to the exertions of Sir Henry\r\nIrving, the actor-manager, was quite a stage success. None, however,\r\nranks high as a real dramatic effort, though all show much care and\r\nskill. _The Falcon_ (1879) is a comedy based on a story from Boccaccio;\r\n_The Cup_ (1880) is based on a story from Plutarch, and scored a\r\nsuccess, also through the skill of Irving. _The Foresters_ (1892),\r\ndealing with the familiar Robin Hood theme, was produced in America.\r\n\r\n=4. His Poetical Characteristics.= (_a_) _His Craftsmanship._ No one\r\ncan deny the great care and skill shown in Tennyson’s work. His method\r\nof producing poetry was slowly to evolve the lines in his mind, commit\r\nthem to paper, and to revise them till they were as near perfection\r\nas he could make them. Consequently we have a high level of poetical\r\nartistry. No one excels Tennyson in the deft application of sound to\r\nsense and in the subtle and pervading employment of alliteration and\r\nvowel-music. Such passages as this abound in his work:\r\n\r\n    Myriads of rivulets hurrying thro’ the lawn,\r\n    The moan of doves in immemorial elms,\r\n    And murmuring of innumerable bees.\r\n                                   _The Princess_\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps not the highest poetry, but shows only a kind of\r\nmanual, or rather aural, dexterity; yet as Tennyson employs it, it is\r\neffective to a degree.\r\n\r\nHis excellent craftsmanship is also apparent in his handling of\r\nEnglish meters, in which he is a tireless experimenter. In blank verse\r\nhe is not so varied and powerful as Shakespeare, nor so majestical\r\nas Milton, but in the skill of his workmanship and in his wealth of\r\ndiction he falls but little short of these great masters.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _His Pictorial Quality._ In this respect Tennyson follows the\r\nexample of Keats. Nearly all of his poems, even the simplest, abound in\r\nornate description of natural and other scenes. His method is to seize\r\nupon appropriate details, dress them in expressive and musical phrases,\r\nand thus throw a glistening image before the reader’s eye:\r\n\r\n    The silk star-broider’d coverlid\r\n      Unto her limbs itself doth mould\r\n    Languidly ever; and, amid\r\n      Her full black ringlets downward rolled,\r\n    Glows forth each softly-shadowed arm\r\n      With bracelets of the diamond bright:\r\n    Her constant beauty doth inform\r\n      Stillness with love, and day with light.\r\n                               _The Sleeping Beauty_\r\n\r\n    Till now the doubtful dusk reveal’d\r\n      The knolls once more where, couched at ease,\r\n      The white kine glimmered, and the trees\r\n    Laid their dark arms about the field:\r\n\r\n    And sucked from out the distant gloom\r\n      A breeze began to tremble o’er\r\n      The large leaves of the sycamore,\r\n    And fluctuate all the still perfume.\r\n                                 _In Memoriam_\r\n\r\nSuch passages as these reveal Tennyson at his best; but once again the\r\ndoubt arises as to whether they represent the highest poetry. They show\r\ncare of observation and a studious loveliness of epithet; but they lack\r\nthe intense insight, the ringing and romantic note, of the best efforts\r\nof Keats.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Tennyson’s _lyrical quality_ is somewhat uneven. The slightest\r\nof his pieces, like _Blow, bugle, blow_, are musical and attractive;\r\nbut on the whole his nature was too self-conscious, and perhaps his\r\nlife too regular and prosperous, to provide a background for the true\r\nlyrical intensity of emotion. Once or twice, as in the wonderful\r\n_Break, break, break_ and _Crossing the Bar_, he touches real greatness:\r\n\r\n    Break, break, break,\r\n      On thy cold gray stones, O Sea!\r\n    And I would that my tongue could utter\r\n      The thoughts that arise in me.\r\n\r\n    O well for the fisherman’s boy,\r\n      That he shouts with his sister at play!\r\n    O well for the sailor lad,\r\n      That he sings in his boat on the bay!\r\n\r\n    And the stately ships go on\r\n      To their haven under the hill;\r\n    But O for the touch of a vanished hand,\r\n      And the sound of a voice that is still!\r\n\r\n    Break, break, break,\r\n      At the foot of thy crags, O Sea!\r\n    But the tender grace of a day that is dead\r\n      Will never come back to me.\r\n\r\nThis lyric has a brevity, unity, and simple earnestness of emotion that\r\nmake it truly great.\r\n\r\n(_d_) The extracts already given have sufficiently revealed the\r\nqualities of his _style_. It can be quite simple, as in _The Brook_\r\nand _Will Waterproof’s Lyrical Monologue_; but his typical style shows\r\na slow and somewhat sententious progress, heavy with imagery and all\r\nthe other devices of the poetical artist. In particular, he is an\r\nadept at coining phrases--“jewels five words long,” as he himself\r\naptly expressed it; and he is almost invariably happy in his choice of\r\nepithet.\r\n\r\n(_e_) His _reputation_ has already declined from the idolatry in which\r\nhe was held when he was alive. He himself foresaw “the clamour and the\r\ncry” that was bound to arise after his death. To his contemporaries he\r\nwas a demigod; but younger men strongly assailed his patent literary\r\nmannerisms, his complacent acceptance of the evils of his time, his\r\nflattery of the great, and his somewhat arrogant assumption of the\r\nairs of immortality. Consequently for twenty years after his death his\r\nreputation suffered considerably. Once more reaction has set in, and\r\nhis detractors have modified their attitude. He is not a supreme poet;\r\nand whether he will maintain the primacy among the singers of his own\r\ngeneration, as he undoubtedly did during his lifetime, remains to be\r\nseen; but, after all deductions are made, his high place in the Temple\r\nof Fame is assured.\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT BROWNING (1812–89)\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= Browning was born at Camberwell, his father being\r\nconnected with the Bank of England. The future poet was educated\r\nsemi-privately, and from an early age he was free to follow his\r\ninclination toward studying unusual subjects. As a child he was\r\nprecocious, and began to write poetry at the age of twelve. Of his\r\npredecessors Shelley in particular influenced his mind, which was\r\nunformed and turbulent at this time with the growing power within.\r\nAfter a brief course at London University, Browning for a short period\r\ntraveled in Russia (1833); then he lived in London, where he became\r\nacquainted with some of the leaders of the literary and theatrical\r\nworlds. In 1834 he paid his first visit to Italy, a country which was\r\nfor him a fitful kind of home. In 1845 he visited Elizabeth Barrett,\r\nthe poetess, whose works had strongly attracted him. A mutual liking\r\nensued, and then, after a private marriage, a sort of elopement\r\nfollowed, to escape the anger of the wife’s stern parent. The remainder\r\nof Browning’s life was occupied with journeys between England and\r\nFrance and Italy, and with much poetical activity. His wife died at\r\nFlorence in 1861, leaving one son. Browning thereupon left the city\r\nfor good and returned to England, though in 1878 he went back once\r\nmore to Italy. His works, after suffering much neglect, were now being\r\nappreciated, and in 1867 Oxford conferred upon him the degree of D.C.L.\r\nHe died in Italy, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\n=2. His Poems and Plays.= His first work of any importance is\r\n_Pauline_ (1833). The poem is a wild imitation of the more\r\nextravagant outbursts of Shelley, whom it praises effusively. The work\r\nis crude and feverish, and at the time it attracted little notice.\r\n_Paracelsus_ (1835) reveals Browning’s affection for unusual\r\nsubjects. The poem, a very long one, is composed largely of monologues\r\nof the medieval charlatan whose name forms the title. The work gave\r\nthe public its first taste of Browning’s famous “obscurity.” The style\r\nis often harsh and rugged, but the blank verse contains many isolated\r\npassages of great tenderness and beauty. There are in addition one or\r\ntwo charming lyrics that are as limpid as well-water:\r\n\r\n    Thus the Mayne glideth\r\n    Where my love abideth.\r\n    Sleep’s no softer: it proceeds\r\n    On through lawns, on through meads,\r\n    On and on, whate’er befall,\r\n    Meandering and musical,\r\n    Though the niggard pasturage\r\n    Bears not on its shaven ledge\r\n    Aught but weeds and waving grasses\r\n    To view the river as it passes,\r\n    Save here and there a scanty patch\r\n    Of primrose too faint to catch\r\n    A weary bee.\r\n\r\nHis next effort was the play _Strafford_ (1837), which was written\r\nat the suggestion of the actor Macready, and was fairly successful.\r\n_Sordello_ (1840) established Browning’s reputation for obscurity. The\r\npoem professes to tell the life-story of a Mantuan troubadour, but most\r\nof it is occupied with long irrelevant speeches and with Browning’s\r\ncommentary thereon. _Pippa Passes_ (1841) is in form a drama. In\r\nplot it is highly improbable, as it is based on several coincidences\r\nthat all happen in one day. The work is rather more terse than its\r\npredecessors, and the purple patches are more numerous. Pippa’s songs,\r\nmoreover, are often of great beauty. In _Dramatic Lyrics_ (1842) there\r\nare many examples of clear and forcible work, including his Cavalier\r\nlyrics and such well-known pieces as _Home Thoughts from Abroad_.\r\nOther works of this period include _The Return of the Druses_ (1843),\r\na play; _Dramatic Romances_ (1846), which shows the Browning obscurity\r\nand virility at their best and worst; _Luria_ (1846), perhaps the\r\nweakest of his tragedies, resembling _Othello_ in some respects;\r\n_Men and Women_ (1855), consisting of dramatic monologues, some of\r\ngreat power and penetration; _Dramatis Personæ_ (1864), containing\r\nmore monologues; _Balaustion’s Adventure_ (1871), a transcript from\r\nEuripides; and the longest of all his works, _The Ring and the Book_\r\n(1868–69), with which the period closes.\r\n\r\n_The Ring and the Book_ is (the word is so apt as to be inevitable)\r\na literary “stunt.” It is the story of the murder of a young wife,\r\nPompilia, by her worthless husband, in the year 1698, and the same\r\nstory is told by nine different people, and continues for twelve books.\r\nThe result is a monument of masterly discursiveness.\r\n\r\nIn the later stages of his career Browning’s mannerisms are accentuated\r\nin the dreary wildernesses of _Prince Hohenstiel-Schwangau_ (1871),\r\n_Red Cotton Night-Cap Country_ (1873), _The Inn Album_ (1875), and _La\r\nSaisiaz_ (1878). It is difficult to understand the use of such poems,\r\nexcept to give employment to the Browning Societies that were springing\r\nup to explain them. But his better qualities are shown in _Fifine at\r\nthe Fair_ (1872), which is still too long; _Dramatic Idylls_ (1879–80);\r\n_Jocoseria_ (1883); _Ferishtah’s Fancies_ (1884); and _Parleyings with\r\nCertain People_ (1887). His long life’s work has a powerful close in\r\n_Asolando_ (1889), which, along with much of the tired disillusion of\r\nthe old man, has in places the firmness and enthusiasm of his prime.\r\nThe last verses he ever wrote describe himself in the character he most\r\nloved to adopt:\r\n\r\n    One who never turned his back but marched breast forward,\r\n      Never doubted clouds would break,\r\n    Never dreamed, though right were worsted, wrong would triumph,\r\n      Held we fall to rise, are baffled to fight better,\r\n        Sleep to wake.\r\n\r\n    No, at noonday in the bustle of man’s worktime\r\n      Greet the unseen with a cheer!\r\n    Bid him forward, breast and back as either should be,\r\n      “Strive and thrive!” cry, “Speed,--fight on, fare ever\r\n        There as here!”\r\n\r\n=3. Features of his Work.= (_a_) _His Style._ Browning’s style\r\nhas been the subject of endless discussion, for it presents a\r\nfascinating problem. Within itself it reveals the widest range. Its\r\nfamous “obscurity” was so pronounced that it led to the production\r\nof “Browning dictionaries” and other apparatus to disclose the deep\r\nmeanings of the master. This feature of his work is partly due to his\r\nfondness for recondite subjects, to his compression and also to his\r\ndiffuseness of thought and language, and to his juggling with words\r\nand meters. It often leads to such passages as the following, which is\r\nnothing less than jockeying with the English language:\r\n\r\n    Now, your rater and debater\r\n    Is baulked by a mere spectator\r\n    Who simply stares and listens\r\n    Tongue tied, while eye nor glistens\r\n    Nor brow grows hot and twitchy,\r\n    Nor mouth, for a combat itchy,\r\n    Quivers with some convincing\r\n    Reply--that sets him wincing?\r\n    Nay, rather, reply that furnishes\r\n    Your debater with what burnishes\r\n    The crest of him, all one triumph,\r\n    As you see him rise, hear him cry “Humph!\r\n    Convinced am I? This confutes me.\r\n    Receive the rejoinder that suits me!\r\n    Confutation of vassal for prince meet--\r\n    Wherein all the powers that convince meet,\r\n    And mash my opponent to mincemeat!”\r\n                                   _Pacchiarotto_\r\n\r\nIn contrast with this huddle of words, Browning can write clearly and\r\nwith perfect cohesion and directness, as may easily be seen in such\r\nwell-known poems as _How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix_,\r\n_Time’s Revenges_, and _The Glove_. His middle style, common in his\r\nblank verse and his lyrics, is somewhat like that of Byron in its fine\r\nprosaic aptness:\r\n\r\n    This flower she stopped at, finger on lip,\r\n      Stooped over, in doubt, as settling its claim;\r\n    Till she gave me, with pride to make no slip,\r\n      Its soft meandering Spanish name:\r\n\r\n    What a name! Was it love or praise?\r\n      Speech half-asleep or song half-awake?\r\n    I must learn Spanish, one of these days,\r\n      Only for that slow sweet name’s sake.\r\n                                        _Garden Fancies_\r\n\r\n(_b_) _His Descriptive Power._ In this respect Browning differs widely\r\nfrom Tennyson, who slowly creates a lovely image by careful massing of\r\ndetail. Browning, however, makes one or two dashing strokes, and, by\r\nhis complete mastery of phrase, the picture is revealed:\r\n\r\n    Yon otter, sleek-wet, black, lithe as a leech;\r\n    Yon auk, one fire-eye in a ball of foam,\r\n    That floats and feeds; a certain badger brown\r\n    He hath watched hunt with that slant white-wedge eye\r\n    By moonlight; and the pie with the long tongue\r\n    That pricks deep into oakworts for a worm,\r\n    And says a plain word when she finds her prize.\r\n                                   _Caliban upon Setebos_\r\n\r\nThis love for the picturesque leads him into many crooked byways\r\nof life, manners, and history, often with results that dismay his\r\nwarmest admirers. Frequently, however, the stubborn thistle of his\r\nstyle blossoms into glossy purples. For example, in _The Ring and the\r\nBook_, we often light upon a tender passage like the following, which\r\nrefreshes the whole arid page around it:\r\n\r\n    So, when the she-dove breeds, strange yearnings come\r\n    For the unknown shelter by undreamed-of shores,\r\n    And there is born a blood-pulse in her heart\r\n    To fight if needs be, though with flap of wing,\r\n    For the wool-flock or the fur-tuft, though a hawk\r\n    Contest the prize.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _His Teaching._ Much play has been made with this side of his\r\nwritings. But, after analysis, his teaching can with fairness be summed\r\nup in the simple exhortation to strive, hope, and fear not. A fair\r\nproportion of his poems are inspired with the facile optimism that led\r\nhim to cry,\r\n\r\n    God’s in his heaven,\r\n    All’s right with the world,\r\n\r\nbut his sager mind let him perceive that much of the world was wrong.\r\nHe had generous enthusiasms, such as that for the cause of Italian\r\nliberty; several strong prejudices, such as that against spiritualism;\r\nbut on the whole his is a fair reflex of the average mind of his day,\r\nwith the addition of much reading and observation and the priceless\r\nboon of genuine poetical genius.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _His Reputation._ Recognition was slow in coming, but like\r\nWordsworth he lived to see his name established high among his fellows.\r\nHe wrote too freely, and often too carelessly and perversely, and much\r\nof his work will pass into oblivion; but the residue will be of quality\r\nhigh enough to make his fame secure.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER POETS\r\n\r\n=1. Elizabeth Barrett Browning (1806–61)=, whose maiden name was\r\nElizabeth Barrett, was the daughter of a West India planter, and was\r\nborn at Durham. She began to write poems at the age of eight; her first\r\npublished work worth mentioning was _An Essay on Mind_ (1826),\r\nwhich is of slight importance. When she was about thirty years old\r\ndelicate health prostrated her, and for the rest of her life she was\r\nalmost an invalid. In 1846, when she was forty, she and Robert Browning\r\nwere married, and stole off to Italy, where they made Florence their\r\nheadquarters. She was a woman of acute sensibilities, and was fervid\r\nin the support of many good causes, one of which was the attainment\r\nof Italian independence. On the death of Wordsworth in 1850 it was\r\nsuggested that the Laureateship should be conferred upon her, but the\r\nproject fell through. After a very happy married life she died at\r\nFlorence.\r\n\r\nOnly the chief of her numerous poetical works can be mentioned here.\r\nAfter her first work noted above there was a pause of nine years; then\r\nappeared _Prometheus Bound_ (1835). Other works are _The Seraphim_\r\n(1838), _Sonnets from the Portuguese_ (1846), _Casa Guidi Windows_\r\n(1851), _Aurora Leigh_ (1857), an immense poem in blank verse,\r\nand _Last Poems_ (1861). She wrote many of her shorter pieces for\r\nmagazines, the most important contributions being _The Cry of the\r\nChildren_ (1841) for _Blackwood’s_ and _The Great God Pan_ (1860) for\r\nthe _Cornhill_. As a narrative poet Mrs. Browning is a comparative\r\nfailure, for in method she is discursive and confused, but she has\r\ncommand of a sweet, clear, and often passionate style. She has many\r\nslips of taste, and her desire for elevation sometimes leads her into\r\nwhat Rossetti called “falsetto masculinity,” a kind of hysterical\r\nbravado.\r\n\r\n=2. Matthew Arnold (1822–88)= was a writer of many activities, but it\r\nis chiefly as a poet that he now holds his place in literature. He\r\nwas the son of the famous headmaster of Rugby, and was educated at\r\nWinchester, Rugby, and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he gained the\r\nNewdigate Prize for poetry. Subsequently he became a Fellow of Oriel\r\nCollege (1845). In 1851 he was appointed an inspector of schools, and\r\nproved to be a capable official. His life was busily uneventful, and in\r\n1886 he resigned, receiving a pension from the Government. Less than\r\ntwo years afterward he died suddenly of heart disease.\r\n\r\nHis poetical works are not very bulky. _The Strayed Reveller_ (1848)\r\nappeared under the _nom de plume_ of “A”; then followed _Empedocles\r\non Etna_ (1853), _Poems_ (1854), and _New Poems_ (1868). None of\r\nthese volumes is of large size, though much of the content is of a\r\nhigh quality. For subject Arnold is fond of classical themes, to\r\nwhich he gives a meditative and even melancholy cast common in modern\r\ncompositions. In some of the poems--as, for example, in the nobly\r\npessimistic _Scholar-Gipsy_--he excels in the description of typical\r\nEnglish scenery. In style he has much of the classical stateliness and\r\nmore formal type of beauty, but he can be graceful and charming, with\r\nsometimes the note of real passion. His meditative poetry, like _Dover\r\nBeach_ and _A Summer Night_, resembles that of Gray in its subdued\r\nmelancholy resignation, but all his work is careful, scholarly, and\r\nworkmanlike.\r\n\r\nHis prose works are large in bulk and wide in range. Of them all\r\nhis critical essays are probably of the highest value. _Essays in\r\nCriticism_ (1865) contains the best of his critical work, which is\r\nmarked by wide reading and careful thought. His judgment, usually\r\nadmirably sane and measured, is sometimes distorted a little by his\r\nviews on life and politics. Arnold also wrote freely upon theological\r\nand political themes, but these were largely topics of the day, and his\r\nworks on such subjects have no great permanent value. His best books of\r\nthis class are _Culture and Anarchy_ (1869) and _Literature and Dogma_\r\n(1873).\r\n\r\n=3. Edward Fitzgerald (1809–83)=, like Thomas Gray, lives in general\r\nliterature by one poem. This, after long neglect, came to be regarded\r\nas one of the great things in English literature. He was a man of\r\noriginal views and retiring habits, and spent most of his life in his\r\nnative Suffolk. In 1859 he issued the _Rubáiyát_ of the early Persian\r\npoet Omar Khayyám. His version is a very free translation, cast into\r\ncurious four-lined stanzas, which have an extraordinary cadence, rugged\r\nyet melodious, strong yet sweet. The feeling expressed in the verses,\r\nwith much energy and picturesque effect, is stoical resignation.\r\nFitzgerald also wrote a prose dialogue of much beauty called\r\n_Euphranor_ (1851); and his surviving letters testify to his quiet and\r\ncaustic humor.\r\n\r\n=4. Arthur Hugh Clough (1819–61)= was born at Liverpool, and educated\r\nat Rugby, where Dr. Arnold made a deep impression upon his mind. He\r\nproceeded to Oxford, where, like his friend Matthew Arnold, he later\r\nbecame a Fellow of Oriel College. He traveled much, and then became\r\nWarden of University Hall, London. This post he soon resigned, and\r\nsome public appointments followed. He died at Florence, after a long\r\npilgrimage to restore his failing health. His death was bewailed by\r\nArnold in his beautiful elegy _Thyrsis_.\r\n\r\nClough’s first long poem was _The Bothie of Tober-na-Vuolich_ (1848),\r\nwhich is written in rough classical hexameters and contains some fine\r\ndescriptions of the Scottish Highlands. He wrote little else of much\r\nvalue. His _Amours de Voyage_ (1849) is also in hexameters; _Dipsychus_\r\n(1850) is a meditative poem. His poetry is charged with much of the\r\ndeep-seated unrest and despondency that mark the work of Arnold. His\r\nlyrical gift is not great, but once at least, in the powerful _Say not\r\nthe Struggle Naught Availeth_, he soared into greatness.\r\n\r\n=5. Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828–82)= was the eldest of the\r\nPre-Raphaelite school of artists and poets. He himself was both artist\r\nand poet. He was the son of an Italian refugee, and early became an\r\nartist. In art, as in poetry, he broke away from convention when he saw\r\nfit. His poetical works are small in bulk, consisting of two slight\r\nvolumes, _Poems_ (1870) and _Ballads and Sonnets_ (1881).\r\n\r\nOf the high quality of these poems there can be little question. With\r\na little more breadth of view, and with perhaps more of the humane\r\nelement in him, he might have found a place among the very highest.\r\nFor he had real genius, and in _The Blessed Damozel_ his gifts are\r\nfully displayed: a gift for description of almost uncanny splendor, a\r\nbrooding and passionate introspection, often of a religious nature,\r\nand a verbal beauty as studied and melodious as that of Tennyson--less\r\ncertain and decisive perhaps, but surpassing that of the older poet in\r\nunearthly suggestiveness. In his ballads, like _Rose Mary_ and _Troy\r\nTown_, the same powers are apparent, though in a lesser degree; these\r\nhave in addition a power of narrative that is only a very little short\r\nof the greatest. An extract appears on p. 515.\r\n\r\n=6. Christina Georgina Rossetti (1830–94)= was a younger sister of\r\nthe poet last named, and survived him by some years. Her life was\r\nuneventful, like her brother’s, and was passed chiefly in London.\r\n\r\nHer bent was almost entirely lyrical, and was shown in _Goblin\r\nMarket_ (1862), _The Prince’s Progress_ (1866), _A Pageant_ (1881),\r\nand _Verses_ (1892). Another volume, called _New Poems_ (1896),\r\nwas published after her death, and contains much excellent early\r\nwork. Her poetry, perhaps less impressive than that of her brother\r\nin its descriptive passages, has a purer lyrical note of deep and\r\nsustained passion, with a somewhat larger command of humor, and a\r\ngift of poetical expression as noble and comprehensive as his own.\r\nThey resemble each other in a curious still undertone of passionate\r\nreligious meditation joined to a fine simplicity of diction.\r\n\r\n=7. William Morris (1834–96)= produced a great amount of poetry, and\r\nwas one of the most conspicuous figures in mid-Victorian literature. He\r\nwas born near London, the son of a wealthy merchant, and was educated\r\nat Marlborough and Oxford. His wealth, freeing him from the drudgery\r\nof a profession, permitted him to take a lively and practical interest\r\nin the questions of his day. Upon art, education, politics, and social\r\nproblems his great energy and powerful mind led him to take very\r\ndecided views, sometimes of an original nature. Here we are concerned\r\nonly with his achievement in literature.\r\n\r\nAt an early period he was drawn into the Pre-Raphaelite movement,\r\nfor he was keenly alive to its studied beauty and rather extreme\r\nmedievalism. _The Defence of Guenevere_ (1858), written in this\r\nmanner, was received with neglect. The poems are laboriously fantastic,\r\nbut they show great beauty and a sense of restrained passion. _The\r\nLife and Death of Jason_ (1866) is a long narrative poem on a\r\nfamiliar theme, written in the heroic couplet in a manner suggestive\r\nof Chaucer, but easy and melodious to an extent that makes the tale\r\nalmost monotonous. _The Earthly Paradise_ (1868–70) develops this\r\nnarrative method still further, and is a collection of twenty-four\r\ntales on various subjects of classical and medieval origin. In meter\r\nthe poems vary, but the couplet is prominent. In range and vivacity\r\nthe work is extraordinary, and the framework into which the tales are\r\nset is both ingenious and beautiful. _Poems by the Way_ (1891)\r\ncontains some fine miscellaneous pieces. A brief extract from his poems\r\nwill be found on p. 514.\r\n\r\nMorris also busied himself with the composition of long prose tales,\r\nproduced in great quantity during the later years of his life. The\r\ntales are written in a curious headlong, semi-rhythmical, semi-archaic\r\nstyle. Much reading of it tends to give the reader mental indigestion,\r\nbut the vigor and skill of the prose are very considerable. Some of the\r\ntales are _The House of the Wolfings_ (1889), _The Roots of the\r\nMountains_ (1890), _The Story of the Glittering Plain_ (1891),\r\nand _The Sundering Flood_ (1898).\r\n\r\n=8. Algernon Charles Swinburne (1837–1909)= had a long life and his\r\npoetical work was in proportion to it. Of aristocratic lineage, he was\r\neducated at Eton and Oxford. He left Oxford (1860) without taking a\r\ndegree, and for the rest of his life wrote voluminously, if not always\r\njudiciously. He was a man of quick attachments and violent antagonisms,\r\nand these features of his character did much to vitiate his prose\r\ncriticisms, of which he wrote a large number. In his later years, from\r\n1879 onward, he lived with his friend Theodore Watts-Dunton at Putney\r\nHill, where he died.\r\n\r\n_Atalanta in Calydon_ (1865), an attempt at an English version of an\r\nancient Greek tragedy, was his first considerable effort in poetic\r\nform, and it attracted notice at once. At a bound the young poet had\r\nattained to a style of his own: tuneful and impetuous movement, a\r\ncunning metrical craftsmanship, and a mastery of melodious diction.\r\nThe excess of these virtues was also its bane, leading to diffuseness,\r\nbreathlessness, and incoherence. _Poems and Ballads_ (1866), a second\r\nextraordinary book, was, owing to its choice of unconventional\r\nsubjects, criticized as being wicked. In it the Swinburnian features\r\nalready mentioned are revealed in a stronger fashion. Only a few of his\r\nlater poetical works can be mentioned here: _Songs before Sunrise_\r\n(1871), a collection of poems chiefly in praise of Italian liberty,\r\nsome of them of great beauty, but marred by his reckless defiance of\r\nthe common view; _Erectheus_ (1876), a further and less successful\r\neffort at Greek tragedy; and _Tristram of Lyonesse_ (1882), a narrative\r\nof much passion and force, composed in the heroic couplet. Some of\r\nhis shorter poems were reproduced in two further series of _Poems and\r\nBallads_ in 1878 and 1889, but they are inferior to those of his prime.\r\n\r\nSwinburne wrote a large number of plays, of which the most noteworthy\r\nare _The Queen Mother and Rosamond_ (1860), with which he began his\r\ncareer as an author; three plays on the subject of Mary Queen of Scots,\r\ncalled _Chastelard_ (1865), _Bothwell_ (1874), and _Mary Stuart_\r\n(1881); _Locrine_ (1887); and _The Sisters_ (1892). The gifts of\r\nSwinburne are lyrical rather than dramatic, and his tragedies, like\r\nthose of most of his contemporaries, are only of literary importance.\r\nHis blank verse is strongly phrased, and in drama his diffuseness--that\r\ndesire for mere sound and speed which was his greatest weakness--has\r\nlittle scope.\r\n\r\n=9. Arthur Edward O’Shaughnessy (1844–81)= was born in London, of Irish\r\ndescent. In 1861 he joined the staff of the British Museum Library,\r\nwhere a promising career was cut short by his early death. He wrote\r\nlittle, and his books came close upon each other: _The Epic of Women_\r\n(1870), _Lays of France_ (1872), _Music and Moonlight_ (1874), and\r\n_Songs of a Worker_ (1881), the last appearing after his death. His\r\nlonger poems have a certain haziness and incoherence, but the shorter\r\npieces have a musical and attractive style and a certain half-mystical\r\nwistfulness. His ode beginning “We are the music-makers” is often\r\nquoted, and other poems quite as good are _A Neglected Heart_ and\r\n_Exile_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DICKENS (1812–70)\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= Dickens was born near Portsea, where his father\r\nwas a clerk in the Navy Pay Office. Charles, the second of eight\r\nchildren, was a delicate child, and much of his boyhood was spent at\r\nhome, where he read the novels of Smollett, Fielding, and Le Sage. The\r\nworks of these writers were to influence his own novels very deeply.\r\nAt an early age also he became very fond of the theater, a fondness\r\nthat remained with him all his life, and affected his novels to a\r\ngreat extent. In 1823 the Dickens family removed to London, where\r\nthe father, an improvident man of the Micawber type, soon drew them\r\ninto money difficulties. The schooling of Charles, which had all\r\nalong been desultory enough, was temporarily suspended. The boy for a\r\ntime worked in a blacking factory while his father was an inmate of\r\nthe debtors’ prison of the Marshalsea. After a year or so financial\r\nmatters improved; the education of Charles was resumed; then in 1827\r\nhe entered the office of an attorney, and in time became an expert\r\nshorthand-writer. This proficiency led (1835) to an appointment as\r\nreporter on the _Morning Chronicle_. In this capacity he did much\r\ntraveling by stage-coach, during which a keen eye and a retentive\r\nmemory stored material to exploit a greatness yet undreamed of.\r\nPreviously, in 1833, some articles which he called _Sketches by\r\nBoz_ had appeared in _The Monthly Magazine_. They were brightly\r\nwritten, and attracted some notice.\r\n\r\nIn 1836 Messrs. Chapman and Hall, a firm of publishers, had agreed to\r\nproduce in periodical form a series of sketches by Seymour, a popular\r\nblack-and-white artist. The subjects were of a sporting and convivial\r\nkind, and to give them more general interest some story was needed to\r\naccompany them. Dickens was requested to supply the “book,” and thus\r\noriginated _The Pickwick Papers_ (1836). Before the issue of the\r\nsecond number of the prints Seymour committed suicide, and Hablot\r\nK. Browne, who adopted the name of “Phiz,” carried on the work. His\r\nillustrations are still commonly adopted for Dickens’s books.\r\n\r\n_The Pickwick Papers_ was a great success; Dickens’s fame was secure,\r\nand the rest of his life was that of a busy and successful novelist.\r\nHe lived to enjoy a reputation that was unexampled, surpassing even\r\nthat of Scott; for the appeal of Dickens was wider and more searching\r\nthan that of the Scottish novelist. He varied his work with much\r\ntraveling--among other places to America (1842), to Italy (1844), to\r\nSwitzerland (1846), and again to America (1867). His popularity was\r\nexploited in journalism, for he edited _The Daily News_ (1846), and\r\nfounded _Household Words_ (1849) and _All the Year Round_ (1859). In\r\n1858 Dickens commenced his famous series of public readings. These were\r\nactings rather than readings, for he chose some of the most violent or\r\naffecting scenes from his novels and presented them with full-blown\r\nhistrionic effect. The readings brought him much money, but they\r\nwore him down physically. They were also given in America, with the\r\ngreatest success. He died in his favorite house, Gad’s Hill Place, near\r\nRochester, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\n=2. His Novels.= _Sketches by Boz_ (1833), a series dealing with London\r\nlife in the manner of Leigh Hunt, is interesting, but trifling when\r\ncompared with _The Pickwick Papers_ (1836), its successor. The plot of\r\nthe latter book is rudimentary. In order to provide an occasion for\r\nSeymour’s sketches Dickens hit upon the idea of a sporting club, to\r\nbe called the Pickwick Club. As the book proceeds this idea is soon\r\ndropped, and the story becomes a kind of large and genial picaresque\r\nnovel. The incidents are loosely connected and the chronology will not\r\nbear close inspection, but in abundance of detail of a high quality,\r\nin vivacity of humor, in acute and accurate observation, the book is\r\nof the first rank. It is doubtful if Dickens ever improved upon it.\r\nThen, before _Pickwick_ was finished, _Oliver Twist_ (1837) appeared\r\npiecemeal in _Bentley’s Miscellany_; and _Nicholas Nickleby_ (1838)\r\nwas begun before the second novel had ceased to appear. The demand for\r\nDickens’s novels was now enormous, and he was assiduous in catering for\r\nhis public. For his next novels he constructed a somewhat elaborate\r\nframework, calling the work _Master Humphrey’s Clock_; but he sensibly\r\nabandoned the notion, and the books appeared separately as _The Old\r\nCuriosity Shop_ (1840), which was an immense success, and _Barnaby\r\nRudge_ (1841), a historical novel. In 1842 he sailed to America,\r\nwhere his experiences bore fruit in _American Notes_ (1843) and\r\n_Martin Chuzzlewit_ (1843). These works were not complimentary to the\r\nAmericans, and they brought him much unpopularity in the United States.\r\n_A Christmas Carol_ (1843) and _Dombey and Son_ (1848) appeared next,\r\nthe latter being written partly at Lausanne. Then in 1849 he started\r\n_David Copperfield_, which contains many of his personal experiences\r\nand is often considered to be his masterpiece, though for many critics\r\n_The Pickwick Papers_ retains its primacy.\r\n\r\nFrom this point onward a certain decline is manifest. His stories\r\ndrag; his mannerisms become more apparent, and his splendid buoyancy\r\nis less visible. _Bleak House_ (1852) and _Hard Times_ (1854) were\r\nwritten for his _Household Words_; _Little Dorrit_ (1856) appeared in\r\nmonthly parts; _A Tale of Two Cities_ (1859) and _Great Expectations_\r\n(1860) were for _All the Year Round_. After producing _Our Mutual\r\nFriend_ (1864) he paid his second visit to America, and was received\r\nvery cordially. He returned to England, but did not live to finish _The\r\nMystery of Edwin Drood_, which was appearing in monthly parts when he\r\ndied.\r\n\r\n=3. Features of his Novels.= (_a_) _Their Popularity._ At the age of\r\ntwenty-six Dickens was a popular author. This was a happy state of\r\naffairs for him, and to his books it served as an ardent stimulus. But\r\nthere were attendant disadvantages. The demand for his novels was so\r\nenormous that it often led to hasty and ill-considered work: to crudity\r\nof plot, to unreality of characters, and to looseness of style. It led\r\nalso to the pernicious habit of issuing the stories in parts. This in\r\nturn resulted in much padding and in lopsidedness of construction. The\r\nmarvelous thing is that with so strong a temptation to slop-work he\r\ncreated books that were so rich and enduring.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _His Imagination._ No English novelist excels Dickens in the\r\nmultiplicity of his characters and situations. _Pickwick Papers_,\r\nthe first of the novels, teems with characters, some of them finely\r\nportrayed, and in mere numbers the supply is maintained to the very end\r\nof his life. He creates for us a whole world of people. In this world\r\nhe is most at home with persons of the lower and middle ranks of life,\r\nespecially those who frequent the neighborhood of London.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _His Humor and Pathos._ It is very likely that the reputation of\r\nDickens will be maintained chiefly as a humorist. His humor is broad,\r\nhumane, and creative. It gives us such real immortals as Mr. Pickwick,\r\nMrs. Gamp, Mr. Micawber, and Sam Weller--typical inhabitants of the\r\nDickensian sphere, and worthy of a place in any literary brotherhood.\r\nDickens’s humor is not very subtle, but it goes deep, and in expression\r\nit is free and vivacious. His satire is apt to develop into mere\r\nburlesque, as it does when he deals with Mr. Stiggins and Bumble. As\r\nfor his pathos, in its day it had an appeal that appears amazing to a\r\nlater generation, whom it strikes as cheap and maudlin. His devices are\r\noften third-rate, as when they depend upon such themes as the deaths of\r\nlittle children, which he describes in detail. His genius had little\r\ntragic force. He could describe the horrible, as in the death of Bill\r\nSikes; he could be painfully melodramatic, as in characters like Rosa\r\nDartle and Madame Defarge; but he seems to have been unable to command\r\nthe simplicity of real tragic greatness.\r\n\r\n(_d_) His _mannerisms_ are many, and they do not make for good in his\r\nnovels. It has often been pointed out that his characters are created\r\nnot “in the round,” but “in the flat.” Each represents one mood, one\r\nturn of phrase. Uriah Heep is “’umble,” Barkis is “willin’.” In this\r\nfashion his characters become associated with catch-phrases, like the\r\npersonages in inferior drama. Dickens’s partiality for the drama is\r\nalso seen in the staginess of his scenes and plots.\r\n\r\n(_e_) In time his _style_ became mannered also. At its best it is not\r\npolished nor scholarly, but it is clear, rapid, and workmanlike, the\r\nstyle of the working journalist. In the early books it is sometimes\r\ntrivial with puns, Cockneyisms, and tiresome circumlocutions. This\r\nheavy-handedness of phrase remained with him all his life. In his more\r\naspiring flights, in particular in his deeply pathetic passages, he\r\nadopted a lyrical style, a kind of verse-in-prose, that is blank verse\r\nslightly disguised. We add a passage of this last type. It can be\r\nscanned in places like pure blank verse:\r\n\r\n   For she was dead. There, upon her little bed, she lay at rest.\r\n   The solemn stillness was no marvel now.\r\n\r\n   She was dead. No sleep so beautiful and calm, so free from trace\r\n   of pain, so fair to look upon. She seemed a creature fresh from\r\n   the hand of God, and waiting for the breath of life; not one who\r\n   had lived and suffered death.\r\n\r\n   Her couch was dressed with here and there some winter berries\r\n   and green leaves, gathered in a spot she had been used to\r\n   favour. “When I die, put near me something that has loved the\r\n   light, and had the sky above it always.” Those were her words.\r\n                                            _The Old Curiosity Shop_\r\n\r\n\r\nWe give also a specimen of the typical Dickensian style. The reader\r\nshould observe in it the qualities of ease, perspicuity, and humor:\r\n\r\n   The particular picture on which Sam Weller’s eyes were fixed,\r\n   as he said this, was a highly coloured representation of a\r\n   couple of human hearts skewered together with an arrow, cooking\r\n   before a cheerful fire, while a male and female cannibal in\r\n   modern attire: the gentleman being clad in a blue coat and white\r\n   trousers, and the lady in a deep red pelisse with a parasol\r\n   of the same: were approaching the meal with hungry eyes, up a\r\n   serpentine gravel path leading thereunto. A decidedly indelicate\r\n   young gentleman, in a pair of wings and nothing else, was\r\n   depicted as superintending the cooking; a representation of the\r\n   spire of the church in Langham Place, London, appeared in the\r\n   distance; and the whole formed a “valentine,” of which, as a\r\n   written inscription in the window testified, there was a large\r\n   assortment within, which the shopkeeper pledged himself to\r\n   dispose of, to his countrymen generally, at the reduced rate of\r\n   one and sixpence each.\r\n                                             _The Pickwick Papers_\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY (1811–63)\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= Thackeray was born at Calcutta, and was descended\r\nfrom an ancient Yorkshire family. His father having died in 1816, the\r\nboy was sent to England for his education; and on the voyage home\r\nhe had a glimpse of Napoleon, then a prisoner on St. Helena. His\r\nschool was the Charterhouse, and his college was Trinity College,\r\nCambridge, which he entered in 1829. Both at school and college he\r\nstruck his contemporaries as an idle and rather cynical youth, whose\r\nmain diversions were sketching and lampooning his friends and enemies.\r\nFor a time Thackeray had some intention of becoming an artist, and\r\nstudied art in Paris. Then the loss of his entire fortune drove him\r\ninto journalism for a living. He contributed both prose and light\r\nverse to several periodicals, including _Punch_ and _Fraser’s\r\nMagazine_, winning his way slowly and with much difficulty, for\r\nhis were gifts that do not gain ready recognition. It was not till\r\nnearly the middle of the century that _Vanity Fair_ (1847) brought\r\nhim some credit, though at first the book was grudgingly received.\r\nThenceforward he wrote steadily and with increasing favor until his\r\ndeath, which occurred with great suddenness. Before his death he had\r\nenjoined his executors not to publish any biography, so that of all\r\nthe major Victorian writers we have of him the scantiest biographical\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\n=2. His Novels.= For a considerable number of years Thackeray was\r\ngroping for a means of expression, and wavered between verse, prose,\r\nand sketching. His earliest literary work consisted of light and\r\npopular contributions to periodicals. The most considerable of these\r\nare _The Yellowplush Papers_ (1837), contributed to _Fraser’s Magazine_\r\nand dealing with the philosophy and experiences of Jeames, an imaginary\r\nfootman, and _The Book of Snobs_ (1846), which originally appeared in\r\n_Punch_ as _The Snob Papers_. Snobs, who continued to be Thackeray’s\r\npet abhorrence, are defined by him as those “who meanly admire mean\r\nthings,” and in this early book their widespread activities are closely\r\npursued and harried. _The History of Samuel Titmarsh_ (1841), _The\r\nGreat Hoggarty Diamond_ (1841), and _The Fitzboodle Papers_ (1842)\r\nappeared first in _Fraser’s Magazine_. They are deeply marked with\r\nhis biting humor and merciless observation of human weaknesses, but\r\nthey found little acceptance. _The Memoirs of Barry Lyndon_ (1842) is\r\na distinct advance. It is a species of picaresque novel, telling of\r\nthe adventures of a gambling rascal, an amiable scapegrace who prowls\r\nover Europe. In range the book is wider, and the grasp of incident and\r\ncharacter is more sure. In _Vanity Fair_ (1847) the genius of Thackeray\r\nreaches high-water mark. In theme it is concerned chiefly with the\r\nfortunes of Becky Sharp, an adventuress. In dexterity of treatment, in\r\nan imaginative power that both reveals and transforms, and in a clear\r\nand mournful vision of the vanities of mankind the novel is among the\r\ngreatest in the language. _Pendennis_ (1848) continues the method of\r\n_Vanity Fair_. Partly autobiographical, it portrays life as it appears\r\nto the author. Thackeray refuses to bow to convention and precedent,\r\nexcept when these conform to his ideals of literature. In this book\r\nThackeray openly avows his debt to Fielding, the master whom he equals\r\nand in places excels. _Henry Esmond_ (1852) is a historical novel\r\nof great length and complexity, showing the previous excellences of\r\nThackeray in almost undiminished force, as well as immense care and\r\nforethought, a minute and accurate knowledge of the times of Queen\r\nAnne, and an extraordinary faculty for reproducing both the style and\r\nthe atmosphere of the period. By some judges this book is considered to\r\nbe his best. His novel _The Newcomes_ (1854) is supposed to be edited\r\nby Pendennis. In tone it is more genial than its predecessors, but it\r\nends tragically with the death of the aged Colonel Newcome. With _The\r\nVirginians_ (1857) the list of the great novels is closed. This book,\r\na sequel to _Henry Esmond_, is a record of the experiences of two lads\r\ncalled Warrington, the grandsons of Henry Esmond himself. In the story,\r\na pale shadow of her former self, appears Beatrix Esmond, the fickle\r\nheroine of the earlier book.\r\n\r\nIn 1860 Thackeray was appointed first editor of _The Cornhill\r\nMagazine_, and for this he wrote _Lovel the Widower_ (1860), _The\r\nAdventures of Philip_ (1861), and a series of essays, charming and\r\nwitty trifles, which were reissued as _The Roundabout Papers_ (1862).\r\nBoth in size and in merit these last novels are inferior to their\r\npredecessors. At his death he left an unfinished novel, _Denis Duval_.\r\n\r\nLike Dickens, Thackeray had much success as a lecturer on both\r\nsides of the Atlantic, though in his methods he did not follow his\r\nfellow-novelist. Two courses of lectures were published as _The English\r\nHumourists_ (1852) and _The Four Georges_ (1857). All his life he\r\ndelighted in writing burlesques, the best of which are _Rebecca and\r\nRowena_ (1850), a comic continuation of _Ivanhoe_, and _The Legend of\r\nthe Rhine_ (1851), a burlesque tale of medieval chivalry.\r\n\r\n=3. His Poetry.= On the surface Thackeray’s verse appears to be\r\nfrivolous stuff, but behind the frivolity there is always sense,\r\noften a barb of reproof, and sometimes a note of sorrow. _The Ballads\r\nof Policeman X_ is an early work contributed in numbers to _Punch_.\r\nOthers, such as _The White Squall_ and _The Ballad of Bouillabaisse_,\r\nhave more claim to rank as poetry, for they show much metrical\r\ndexterity and in places a touch of real pathos.\r\n\r\n=4. Features of his Works.= (_a_) _Their Reputation._ While Dickens\r\nwas in the full tide of his success Thackeray was struggling through\r\nneglect and contempt to recognition. Thackeray’s genius blossomed\r\nslowly, just as Fielding’s did; for that reason the fruit is more\r\nmellow and matured, and perhaps on that account it will last the\r\nlonger. Once he had gained the favor of the public he held it, and\r\namong outstanding English novelists there is none whose claim is so\r\nlittle subject to challenge.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _His Method._ “Since the writer of _Tom Jones_ was buried,” says\r\nThackeray in his preface to _Pendennis_, “no writer of fiction among us\r\nhas been permitted to depict to the best of his power a MAN. We must\r\nshape him and give him a certain conventional temper.” Thackeray’s\r\nnovels are a protest against this convention. He returns to the\r\nFielding method: to view his characters steadily and fearlessly, and to\r\nset on record their failings as well as their merits and capacities.\r\nIn his hands the results are not flattering to human nature, for most\r\nof his clever people are rogues and most of his virtuous folk are\r\nfools. But whether they are rogues, or fools, or merely blundering\r\nincompetents, his creations are rounded, entire, and quite alive and\r\nconvincing.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _His Humor and Pathos._ Much has been made of the sneering\r\ncynicism of Thackeray’s humor, and a good deal of the criticism is\r\ntrue. It was his desire to reveal the truth, and satire is one of his\r\nmost potent methods of revelation. His sarcasm, a deadly species, is\r\nhusbanded for deserving objects, such as Lord Steyne and (to a lesser\r\ndegree) Barnes Newcome. In the case of people who are only stupid, like\r\nRawdon Crawley, mercy tempers justice; and when Thackeray chooses to\r\ndo so he can handle a character with loving tenderness, as can be seen\r\nin the case of Lady Castlewood and of Colonel Newcome. In pathos he\r\nis seldom sentimental, being usually quiet and effective. But at the\r\nthought of the vain, the arrogant, and the mean people of the world\r\nThackeray barbs his pen, with destructive results.\r\n\r\n(_d_) His _style_ is very near to the ideal for a novelist. It is\r\neffortless, and is therefore unobtrusive, detracting in no wise from\r\nthe interest in the story. It is also flexible to an extraordinary\r\ndegree. We have seen how in _Esmond_ he recaptured the Addisonian\r\nstyle; this is only one aspect of his mimetic faculty, which in his\r\nburlesques finds ample scope. We add a typical specimen of his style:\r\n\r\n   As they came up to the house at Walcote, the windows from within\r\n   were lighted up with friendly welcome; the supper-table was\r\n   spread in the oak-parlour; it seemed as if forgiveness and love\r\n   were awaiting the returning prodigal. Two or three familiar\r\n   faces of domestics were on the look-out at the porch--the old\r\n   housekeeper was there, and young Lockwood from Castlewood in\r\n   my lord’s livery of tawny and blue. His dear mistress pressed\r\n   his arm as they passed into the hall. Her eyes beamed out on\r\n   him with affection indescribable. “Welcome,” was all she said:\r\n   as she looked up, putting back her fair curls and black hood. A\r\n   sweet rosy smile blushed on her face: Harry thought he had never\r\n   seen her look so charming. Her face was lighted with a joy that\r\n   was brighter than beauty--she took a hand of her son who was in\r\n   the hall waiting his mother--she did not quit Esmond’s arm.\r\n                                                     _Henry Esmond_\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE MEREDITH (1828–1909)\r\n\r\nOf the later Victorian novelists Meredith takes rank as the most\r\nnoteworthy.\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= The known details of Meredith’s earlier life are\r\nstill rather scanty, and he himself gives us little enlightenment. He\r\nwas born at Portsmouth, and until he was sixteen he was educated in\r\nGermany. At first he studied law, but, rebelling against his legal\r\nstudies, took to literature as a profession, contributing to magazines\r\nand newspapers. Like so many of the eager spirits of his day, he was\r\ndeeply interested in the struggles of Italy and Germany to be free.\r\nFor some considerable time he was reader to a London publishing house;\r\nthen, as his own books slowly won their way, he was enabled to give\r\nmore time to their composition. In 1867 he was appointed editor of\r\n_The Fortnightly Review._ He died at his home at Boxhill, Surrey.\r\n\r\n=2. His Poetry.= During all his career as a novelist Meredith published\r\nmuch verse. _Chillianwallah_ (1849), his first published work, contains\r\nmuch spirited verse; other works are _Modern Love_ (1862), _Ballads and\r\nPoems_ (1887), and _Poems_ (1892). Like his novels, much of Meredith’s\r\npoetry is almost willfully obscure, as it undoubtedly is in _Modern\r\nLove_; but in the case of such poems as _The Nuptials of Attila_ he\r\nis clear and vigorous. He loved nature and the open air, and in poems\r\nlike the beautiful _Love in the Valley_ such affection is brightly\r\nvisible. Like Swinburne, he was always eager to champion the cause of\r\nthe oppressed.\r\n\r\n=3. His Novels.= Meredith’s first novel of importance is _The Ordeal\r\nof Richard Feverel_ (1859). Almost at one stride he attains to his\r\nfull strength, for this novel is typical of much of his later work. In\r\nplot it is rather weak, and almost incredible toward the end. It deals\r\nwith a young aristocrat educated on a system laboriously virtuous;\r\nbut youthful nature breaks the bonds, and complications follow. Most\r\nof the characters are of the higher ranks of society, and they are\r\nsubtly analyzed and elaborately featured. They move languidly across\r\nthe story, speaking in a language as extraordinary, in its chiseled\r\nepigrammatic precision, as that of the creatures of Congreve or Oscar\r\nWilde. The general style of the language is mannered in the extreme; it\r\nis a kind of elaborate literary confectionery--it almost seems a pity\r\non the part of the hasty novel-reader to swallow it in rude mouthfuls.\r\nNevertheless, behind this appearance of artificiality there ranges a\r\nmind both subtle and sure, an elfish, satiric spirit, and a passionate\r\nideal of artistic perfection. Such a novel could hardly hope for a\r\nready recognition; but its ultimate fame was assured.\r\n\r\nThe next novel was _Evan Harrington_ (1860), which contains some\r\ndetails of Meredith’s own family life; then followed _Emilia in\r\nEngland_ (1864), the name of which was afterward altered to _Sandra\r\nBelloni_, in which the scene is laid partly in Italy. In _Rhoda\r\nFleming_ (1865) Meredith tried to deal with plebeian folks, but with\r\nindifferent success. The heroines of his later novels--Meredith was\r\nalways careful to make his female characters at least as important as\r\nhis male ones--are aristocratic in rank and inclinations. _Vittoria_\r\n(1867) is a sequel to _Sandra Belloni_, and contains much spirited\r\nhandling of the Italian insurrectionary movement. Then came _The\r\nAdventures of Harry Richmond_ (1870), in which the scene is laid in\r\nEngland, and _Beauchamp’s Career_ (1874), in which Meredith’s style\r\nis seen in its most exaggerated form. In _The Egoist_ (1879), his\r\nnext novel, Meredith may be said to reach the climax of his art. The\r\nstyle is fully matured, with much less surface glitter and more depth\r\nand solidity; the treatment of the characters is close, accurate,\r\nand amazingly detailed; and the Egoist himself, Sir Willoughby\r\nPatterne--Meredith hunted the egoist as remorselessly as Thackeray\r\npursued the snob--is a triumph of comic artistry. The later novels\r\nare of less merit. _The Tragic Comedians_ (1880) is chaotic in plot\r\nand over-developed in style; and the same faults may be urged against\r\n_Diana of the Crossways_ (1885), though it contains many beautiful\r\npassages; _One of our Conquerors_ (1890) is nearly impossible in plot\r\nand style, and _The Amazing Marriage_ (1895) is not much better.\r\n\r\nWe add a short typical specimen of Meredith’s style. Observe the\r\nstudied precision of phrase and epithet, the elaboration of detail, and\r\nthe imaginative power.\r\n\r\n   She had the mouth that smiles in repose. The lips met full on\r\n   the centre of the bow and thinned along to a lifting dimple;\r\n   the eyelids also lifted slightly at the outer corners and\r\n   seemed, like the lip into the limpid cheek, quickening up the\r\n   temples, as with a run of light, or the ascension indicated\r\n   off a shoot of colour. Her features were playfellows of one\r\n   another, none of them pretending to rigid correctness, nor\r\n   the nose to the ordinary dignity of governess among merry\r\n   girls, despite which the nose was of fair design, not acutely\r\n   interrogative or inviting to gambols. Aspens imaged in water,\r\n   waiting for the breeze, would offer a susceptible lover some\r\n   suggestion of her face; a pure smooth-white face, tenderly\r\n   flushed in the cheeks, where the gentle dints were faintly\r\n   intermelting even during quietness. Her eyes were brown, set\r\n   well between mild lids, often shadowed, not unwakeful. Her hair\r\n   of lighter brown, swelling above her temples on the sweep to\r\n   the knot, imposed the triangle of the fabulous wild woodland\r\n   visage from brow to mouth and chin, evidently in agreement\r\n   with her taste; and the triangle suited her; but her face was\r\n   not significant of a tameless wildness or of weakness; her\r\n   equable shut mouth threw its long curve to guard the small\r\n   round chin from that effect; her eyes wavered only in humour,\r\n   they were steady when thoughtfulness was awakened; and at such\r\n   seasons the build of her winter-beechwood hair lost the touch\r\n   of nymph-like and whimsical, and strangely, by mere outline,\r\n   added to her appearance of studious concentration. Observe the\r\n   hawk on stretched wings over the prey he spies, for an idea of\r\n   this change in the look of a young lady whom Vernon Whitford\r\n   could liken to the Mountain Echo, and Mrs Mountstuart Jenkinson\r\n   pronounced to be “a dainty rogue in porcelain.”\r\n                                                       _The Egoist_\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER NOVELISTS\r\n\r\n=1. Charlotte Brontë (1816–55)= is the most important of three\r\nsisters, the other two being =Emily Brontë (1818–48)= and =Anne\r\nBrontë (1820–49)=. They were the daughters of an Irish clergyman who\r\nheld a living in Yorkshire. Financial difficulties compelled Charlotte\r\nto become a schoolteacher and then (1832) a governess. Along with Emily\r\nshe visited Brussels in 1842, and then returned home, where family\r\ncares kept her closely tied. Later her books had much success, and so\r\nshe was released from many of her financial worries. She was married in\r\n1854, but died in the next year. Her two younger sisters, brilliant but\r\nerratic creatures, had predeceased her.\r\n\r\nThe three sisters began their career jointly with a volume of verse, in\r\nwhich they respectively adopted the names of Currer, Ellis, and Acton\r\nBell. The poems, which appeared in 1846, are unusually fine in parts,\r\nespecially the pieces ascribed to Emily. Charlotte’s first novel, _The\r\nProfessor_, which was written before the poems were published, had\r\nno success, and was not published till after her death. _Jane Eyre_\r\n(1847), which was given to the world after _The Professor_ had failed\r\nto find a publisher, created a stir by its unusual candor, passion, and\r\npower. It was based on the work of Thackeray, whom Miss Brontë, in the\r\nsecond edition of the book, acknowledged as her Master in the art of\r\nfiction. Her other novels were _Shirley_ (1849) and _Villette_ (1853).\r\n\r\nThe truth and intensity of Charlotte’s work are unquestioned: she can\r\nsee and judge with the eye of a genius. But these merits have their\r\ndisadvantages. In the plots of her novels she is largely restricted to\r\nher own experiences; her high seriousness is unrelieved by any humor;\r\nand her passion is at times overcharged to the point of frenzy. But to\r\nthe novel she brought an energy and passion that gave to commonplace\r\npeople and actions the wonder and beauty of the romantic world.\r\n\r\nEmily wrote a novel, _Wuthering Heights_ (1847), a wild effort, hit or\r\nmiss, at the tragical romance. Where she is successful she attains to\r\na tragical emphasis that is almost sublime; but as a whole the book is\r\ntoo unequal to rank as very great.\r\n\r\nThe third sister, Anne, in her short life wrote two novels, _Agnes\r\nGrey_ (1847) and _The Tenant of Wildfell Hall_ (1847). They are much\r\ninferior to the novels of her sisters, for she lacks nearly all their\r\npower and intensity.\r\n\r\n=2. Charles Reade (1814–84)= was born in Oxfordshire, being the\r\nyoungest son of a squire. He was educated at Iffley and Oxford, and\r\nthen, entering Lincoln’s Inn, was called to the Bar. He was only\r\nslightly interested in the legal profession, but very fond of the\r\ntheater and traveling. After 1852 he settled down to the career of the\r\nsuccessful man of letters. He died at Shepherd’s Bush.\r\n\r\nHe began authorship with the writing of plays. As a playwright he had\r\na fair amount of success, his most fortunate production being _Masks\r\nand Faces_ (1852), written in collaboration with Tom Taylor. _Peg\r\nWoffington_ (1853) was his first novel, and was followed by _Christie\r\nJohnstone_ (1853), which deals with Scottish fisherfolk. _It’s Never\r\ntoo Late to Mend_ (1856), sometimes considered to be his masterpiece,\r\ntreats of prisons and of life in the colonies. _The Cloister and the\r\nHearth_ (1861), one of his best novels, is a story of the later Middle\r\nAges, and shows the author’s immense care and knowledge; _Hard Cash_\r\n(1863) is an attack upon private lunatic asylums; and _Griffith Gaunt_\r\n(1866), _Foul Play_ (1869), and some other inferior books are in the\r\nnature of propaganda against abuses of the time.\r\n\r\nWhen he is at his best Reade tells a fine tale, for he can move with\r\nspeed and describe with considerable power. But he tends to overload\r\nhis narrative with historical and topical detail, of which he collected\r\ngreat masses. His style, too, is frequently marred by annoying tricks\r\nof manner, such as over-emphasis and mechanical repetition. Since his\r\nown day his reputation has declined.\r\n\r\n=3. Anthony Trollope (1815–82)= is another Victorian novelist who\r\njust missed greatness. The son of a barrister, he was born in London,\r\neducated at Harrow and Winchester, and obtained an appointment in the\r\nPost Office. After an unpromising start he rapidly improved, and rose\r\nhigh in the service.\r\n\r\nIn all Trollope wrote over fifty novels, the best of which are _The\r\nWarden_ (1855), _Barchester Towers_ (1857), _Doctor Thorne_ (1858),\r\n_Framley Parsonage_ (1861), and _The Last Chronicle of Barset_ (1867).\r\nHe is at his best when he deals with the lives of the clergymen of\r\nthe town that he calls Barchester, which has been identified with\r\nSalisbury. His novels, owing to the rapidity of their output, tend\r\nto become mechanical and ill constructed; but he has a genial humor,\r\na lively narrative method, and much shrewd observation. _Barchester\r\nTowers_ contains several characters not unworthy of Dickens.\r\n\r\n=4. Wilkie Collins (1824–89)= is considered to be the most successful\r\nof the followers of Dickens. At one time, about 1860, his vogue was\r\nnearly as great as that of Dickens himself. Collins was born in London,\r\nand was a son of a famous painter. After a few years spent in business\r\nhe took to the study of the law, but very soon abandoned that for\r\nliterature. He was a versatile man, dabbling much in journalism and\r\nplay-writing.\r\n\r\nCollins specialized in the mystery novel, to which he sometimes added\r\na spice of the supernatural. In many of his books the story, which is\r\noften ingeniously complicated, is unfolded by letters or the narratives\r\nof persons actually engaged in the events. To a certain extent this\r\nmethod is cumbrous, but it allowed Collins to draw his characters\r\nwith much wealth of detail. His characters are often described in the\r\nDickensian manner of emphasizing some humor or peculiarity. He wrote\r\nmore than twenty-five novels, the most popular being _The Dead Secret_\r\n(1857), _The Woman in White_ (1860)--the most successful of them\r\nall--_No Name_ (1862), and _The Moonstone_ (1868). _The Moonstone_ is\r\none of the earliest and the best of the great multitude of detective\r\nstories that now crowd the popular press. Collins was in addition one\r\nof the first authors to devote himself to the short magazine story;\r\nAfter Dark is a little masterpiece.\r\n\r\n=5. George Eliot=--the pen name of =Mary Ann Evans (1819–80)=--was\r\nduring her lifetime reckoned to be among the greatest authors, but\r\ntime has dealt rather unkindly with her reputation. Even yet, however,\r\nshe ranks among the greatest of women novelists. The daughter of a\r\nWarwickshire land-agent, she was born near Nuneaton, and after being\r\neducated at Nuneaton and Coventry lived much at home. Her mind was\r\nwell above the ordinary in its bent for religious and philosophical\r\nspeculation. In 1846 she translated Strauss’s _Life of Jesus_, and on\r\nthe death of her father in 1849 she took entirely to literary work.\r\nShe was appointed assistant editor of the _Westminster Review_ (1851),\r\nand became the center of a literary circle. In later life she traveled\r\nextensively, and married (1880) Mr. J. W. Cross. She died at Chelsea in\r\nthe same year.\r\n\r\nHer first fiction consisted of three short stories published in\r\n_Blackwood’s Magazine_ and reissued under the title of _Scenes from\r\nClerical Life_ (1857). _Adam Bede_ (1859), her second book, was\r\nbrilliantly successful. It is a story of country life, subtly yet\r\npowerfully told. To this succeeded _The Mill on the Floss_ (1860),\r\npartly autobiographical. This book is longer and heavier than its\r\npredecessor, but it has much tragic force and acute observation, and\r\na placidly caustic humor. _Silas Marner_ (1861) is shorter, crisper,\r\nand exceedingly effective, but _Romola_ (1863), a laborious story of\r\nmedieval Florence, is overweighted with learning and philosophizing.\r\nAfter this point the decline is rapid in _Felix Holt_ (1866),\r\n_Middlemarch_ (1872), _Daniel Deronda_ (1876), and _The Impressions of\r\nTheophrastus Such_ (1879).\r\n\r\nIn some respects George Eliot is first rate: in humorous observation\r\nof country folk, in keen analysis of motive, and in a curious kind of\r\ngrim subdued passion. But she lacks fire and rapidity, and is deficient\r\nin the warmer kind of humanity. The consequence is that, especially in\r\nthe later books, when the heart became subordinated to the head, her\r\npeople are icily unreal. In these last books, moreover, she allowed her\r\nreligious, racial, and political theories to run away with her, and\r\nthus to ruin her work as artistic fiction.\r\n\r\n=6. Charles Kingsley (1819–75)= was a Devonshire man, being born at\r\nHolne and brought up at Clovelly. He completed his education at Oxford\r\n(1842), where he was very successful as a student, and took orders.\r\nDuring his early manhood he was a strenuous Christian Socialist,\r\nand for the first few years of his curacy he devoted himself to the\r\ncause of the poor. All his life was spent, first as curate and then\r\nas rector, at Eversley, in Hampshire. In the course of time his books\r\nbrought him honors, including the professorship of history at Oxford\r\nand a chaplaincy to the Queen.\r\n\r\nHis first novels, _Alton Locke_ (1849) and _Yeast_ (1849), deal in a\r\nrobust fashion with the social questions of his day. They are crude\r\nin their methods, but they were effective both as fiction and social\r\npropaganda. _Hypatia_ (1853) has for its theme the struggle between\r\nearly Christianity and intellectual paganism; in workmanship it is less\r\nimmature, but the cruelly tragic conclusion made it less popular than\r\nthe others. _Westward Ho!_ (1855), a tale of the good old days of Queen\r\nElizabeth, marks the climax of his career as a novelist. At first the\r\nbook strikes the reader as being wordy and diffuse, and all through it\r\nis marred with much tedious abuse of Roman Catholics; but once the tale\r\nroams abroad into exciting scenes it moves with a buoyant zest, and\r\nreflects with romantic exuberance the spirit of the early sea-rovers.\r\n_Two Years Ago_ (1857) and _Hereward the Wake_ (1866) did not recapture\r\nthe note of their great predecessor.\r\n\r\nKingsley excels as the manly and straightforward story-teller.\r\nHis characters, though they are clearly stamped and visualized,\r\nlack delicacy of finish, yet they suit his purpose excellently. In\r\ntreatment he revels in a kind of florid description which is not always\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nAs a poet Kingsley achieved some remarkable results, especially in his\r\nshort poems. Of these a few, including the familiar _Sands of Dee_,\r\n_The Three Fishers_, and _Airly Beacon_, are of the truly lyrical cast:\r\nshort, profoundly passionate, and perfectly phrased. His longer poems,\r\nsuch as _The Saint’s Tragedy_ (1848), are not nearly so good. Kingsley\r\ncould write also a rhythmic semi-poetical prose, as is seen in his book\r\nof stories from the Greek myths called _The Heroes_ (1856) and to a\r\nless degree in his delightful fantasy _The Water Babies_ (1863).\r\n\r\n=7. Walter Besant (1836–1901)= is a good example of the class of light\r\nnovelist that flourished in the later Victorian epoch. He was born at\r\nPortsmouth, educated at London and Cambridge, held a professorship\r\nin Mauritius, and then, returning to England (1868), settled down to\r\nthe life of a novelist. Along with =James Rice (1844–82)= he wrote\r\nmany novels, including _Ready-Money Mortiboy_ (1872) and _The Golden\r\nButterfly_ (1876). These books do not aspire to be great literature,\r\nbut they are healthy and amusing productions.\r\n\r\n=8. George Borrow (1803–81)= had a curious career which did not lose\r\nits interest from his method of telling its story. He was born in\r\nNorfolk, and was the son of a soldier. From his earliest manhood he led\r\na wandering life, and consorted with queer people, of whose languages\r\nand customs he was a quick observer. At one stage of his career he\r\nwas a colporteur for the Bible Society, visiting Spain and Morocco\r\n(1835–39). Then he married a lady with a considerable income, and died\r\na landed proprietor in comfortable circumstances.\r\n\r\nHis principal books were _The Bible in Spain_ (1843), telling of his\r\nadventures as an agent of the Bible Society; _Lavengro_ (1851) and _The\r\nRomany Rye_ (1857), dealing with his life among the gypsies; and _Wild\r\nWales_ (1862). His books are remarkable in that they seriously pretend\r\nto tell the actual facts of the author’s life, but how much is fact and\r\nhow much is fiction will never be accurately known, so great is his\r\npower of imagination. Taken as mere fiction, the books exert a strong\r\nand strange fascination on many readers. They have a naïve simplicity\r\nresembling that of Goldsmith, a wry humor, and a quick and natural\r\nshrewdness. As a blend of fact and fiction, of hard detail and misty\r\nimagination, of sly humor and stockish solemnity, the books stand apart\r\nin our literature.\r\n\r\n=9. Richard D. Blackmore (1825–1900)= was born in Berkshire, and\r\neducated at Tiverton and Oxford. He was called to the Bar, but forsook\r\nthe law for the occupation of a farmer, which suited him much better.\r\nHe died at Teddington-on-Thames.\r\n\r\nHe began authorship by writing verse of little value; then turned to\r\nwriting novels, which are much worthier as literature. The best of\r\nthese are _Lorna Doone_ (1869), an excellent historical romance of\r\nExmoor, _The Maid of Sker_ (1872), and _Cripps the Carrier_ (1876).\r\nBlackmore had little skill in contriving plots, and many of his\r\ncharacters, especially his wicked characters, carry little conviction.\r\nYet he has a rare capacity for tale-telling, a real enthusiasm for\r\nnature, and a romantic eloquence of style that falls little short of\r\ngreatness. _Lorna Doone_ stands high among historical novels.\r\n\r\n=10. Robert Louis Stevenson (1850–94)= was born at Edinburgh, and\r\nwas called to the Scottish Bar. He had little taste for the legal\r\nprofession, and a constitutional tendency to consumption made an\r\noutdoor life necessary. He traveled much in an erratic manner, and\r\nwrote for periodicals. Then, when his malady became acute, he migrated\r\nto Samoa (1888), where the mildness of the climate only delayed a death\r\nwhich came all too prematurely. He lies buried in Samoa.\r\n\r\nHis first published works were of the essay nature, and included _An\r\nInland Voyage_ (1879), _Travels with a Donkey_ (1879), and _Virginibus\r\nPuerisque_ (1881). His next step was into romance, in which he began\r\nwith _The New Arabian Nights_ (1882), and then had real success with\r\n_Treasure Island_ (1883), a stirring yarn of pirates and perilous\r\nseas. Then came _Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_ (1886), a fine example of\r\nthe terror-mystery novel, and several historical novels: _Kidnapped_\r\n(1887), _The Black Arrow_ (1888), _The Master of Ballantrae_ (1889),\r\nand _Catriona_ (1893), which was a sequel to _Kidnapped_. With the\r\nexception of _The Black Arrow_, the historical novels deal with\r\nScotland in the eighteenth century. At his death he left a powerful\r\nfragment, _Weir of Hermiston_.\r\n\r\nIn the novel Stevenson carries on the tradition of George Meredith. He\r\napplies to the novel a cultivated style and a laborious craftsmanship.\r\nThese features would in themselves have made his novels unattractive,\r\nbut to them he added a pawky sense of humor, a swift and brilliant\r\ndescriptive faculty, and a wide knowledge of and a deep regard for\r\nthe lore of his native land. Compared with Scott he seems cramped\r\nand finicking in his methods, and his outlook is sometimes crude and\r\njuvenile, but his finer qualities more than atone for his shortcomings.\r\n\r\nStevenson’s poetry is charming and dexterous, excelling in its\r\ntreatment of child-nature. His best volumes are _A Child’s Garden of\r\nVerses_ (1885), _Underwoods_ (1887), and _Ballads_ (1889).\r\n\r\n=11. Samuel Butler (1835–1902)= was born in Nottinghamshire, and\r\neducated at Shrewsbury and Cambridge. In 1860 he emigrated to New\r\nZealand, where a few years’ successful sheep-farming allowed him to\r\nreturn to England and live a modest literary life. Butler was a man who\r\nharbored unusual ideas on music, art, education, and social conditions\r\nin general. His mind was at once cultured and credulous; and his gift\r\nof pungent language gave him much influence among the more ardent and\r\nadvanced minds of his day.\r\n\r\nHis first work, _Erewhon_ (1872), appeared originally in a\r\nnewspaper in New Zealand. It is a combination of _Gulliver’s\r\nTravels_ and _Utopia_ adapted to modern life, and full of\r\nButler’s odd prejudices and sardonic wit. Its acute thinking and solid\r\nnarrative gifts are also very apparent. His great novel _The Way of\r\nAll Flesh_ was published posthumously in 1903. It is modern enough\r\nin its keen satire upon conventional education and parental methods\r\nof control and in its candid personal disclosures. As time goes on the\r\nwork will probably take its place as one of the outstanding novels of\r\nthe period.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS CARLYLE (1795–1881)\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= Carlyle, who was born at Ecclefechan, in\r\nDumfriesshire, was the son of a stonemason. He was educated at Annan\r\nand at Edinburgh University, and, giving up his intention of entering\r\nthe Church, became for a time a schoolteacher in Kirkcaldy. After a few\r\nyears’ teaching, during which he saved a little money, he abandoned the\r\nprofession and removed to Edinburgh, where he did literary hack-work\r\nfor a living. At this time (1818) he was poor in means and wretched\r\nin health, and his spiritual and bodily torments are revealed in\r\n_Sartor Resartus_. In 1828 he married Jane Welsh, an able woman\r\nwho possessed a little property of her own; and after a brief spell\r\nof married life in Edinburgh they removed to Craigenputtock, a small\r\nestate in the wilds of Dumfriesshire owned by Mrs. Carlyle. Here they\r\nlived unhappily enough, but here Carlyle wrote some of his best-known\r\nbooks. In 1834 they removed to London, and settled permanently\r\nin Chelsea. Carlyle’s poverty was still acute, and as a means of\r\nalleviating it he took to lecturing. He was moderately successful\r\nin the effort. Then his books, at first received with complete\r\nindifference or positive amazement and disgust, began to find favor,\r\nand for the last twenty years of his life he was prominent among the\r\nintellectual leaders of the time. His wife died in 1866, and in his\r\nlatter years he was much afflicted with illness and by his deep concern\r\nfor the state of public affairs. He died at Chelsea, and was buried\r\namong his own people at Ecclefechan.\r\n\r\n=2. His Works.= Carlyle’s earliest work consisted of translations,\r\nessays, and biographies. Of these the best are his translation of\r\nGoethe’s _Wilhelm Meister_ (1824), his _Life of Schiller_ (1825),\r\nand his essays on Burns and Scott. Then _Sartor Resartus_ (1833)\r\nappeared piecemeal in _Fraser’s Magazine_. It is an extraordinary book,\r\npretending to contain the opinions of a German professor; but under\r\na thin veil of fiction Carlyle discloses his own spiritual struggles\r\nduring his early troubled years. The style is violent and exclamatory,\r\nand the meaning is frequently obscured in a torrent of words, but\r\nit has an energy and a rapturous ecstasy of revolt that quite take\r\nthe breath away. Carlyle then turned to historical writing, which he\r\nhandled in his own unconventional fashion. His major historical works\r\nare _The French Revolution_ (1837), a series of vivid word-pictures\r\nrather than sober history, but full of audacity and color; _Oliver\r\nCromwell’s Letters and Speeches_ (1845), a huge effort relieved from\r\ntedium only by Carlyle’s volcanic methods; _The Life of John Sterling_\r\n(1851), a slight work, but more genial and humane than his writing\r\nusually is; and _The Life of Frederick II_ (1865), enormous in scale\r\nand heavy with detail. His works dealing with contemporary events are\r\nnumerous, and include _Chartism_ (1839), _Past and Present_ (1843), and\r\n_Latter-day Pamphlets_ (1850). The series of lectures he delivered in\r\n1837 was published as _Heroes and Hero-worship_ (1840).\r\n\r\n=3. Features of his Works.= (_a_) _His Teaching._ It is now a little\r\ndifficult to understand why Carlyle was valued so highly as a sage in\r\nmoral and political affairs. Throughout his works there is much froth\r\nand thunder, but little of anything that (to a later age) is solid and\r\ncapable of analysis. Carlyle, however, was a man of sterling honesty,\r\nof sagacious and powerful mind, which he applied without hesitation\r\nto the troubles of his time. His influence, therefore, was rather\r\npersonal, like that of Dr. Johnson, and cannot be accurately gauged\r\nfrom his written works. His opinions were widely discussed and widely\r\naccepted, and his books had the force of _ex cathedra_ pronouncements.\r\nIn them he sometimes contradicted himself, but he did great service\r\nin his denunciation of shams and tyrannies, and in his tempestuous\r\nadvocacy of hard work and clear thinking.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _His Historical Method._ Carlyle’s method was essentially\r\nbiographical--he sought out the “hero,” the superman who could\r\nbenevolently dominate his fellows, and compel them to do better.\r\nSuch were his Cromwell and his Frederick. His other aim was to make\r\nhistory alive. He denounced the “Dryasdust” who killed the living\r\nforce in history. To achieve his purpose he sought out and recorded\r\ninfinite detail of life and opinion, and by means of his own masculine\r\nimagination and pithy style he brought the subject vividly before his\r\nreader’s eye.\r\n\r\n(_c_) His _style_ is entirely his own. At the first glance a\r\ntypical passage seems rude and uncouth: with many capital letters in\r\nthe German fashion, with broken phrases and ejaculations, he proceeds\r\namid a torrent of whirling words. Yet he is flexible to a wonderful\r\ndegree: he can command a beauty of expression that wrings the very\r\nheart: a sweet and piercing melody, with a suggestion, always present,\r\nyet always remote, of infinite regret and longing. In such divine\r\nmoments his style has the lyrical note that requires only the lyrical\r\nmeter to become great poetry.[223]\r\n\r\nThe following are two specimens of his style. The first, based on\r\nGerman models, is in his cruder early manner; the second is more\r\nmatured and restrained. Note in this the quizzical humor.\r\n\r\n    (1) “_Es leuchtet mir ein_, I see a glimpse of it!” cries he\r\n   elsewhere: “there is in man a HIGHER than Love of Happiness: he\r\n   can do without Happiness, and instead thereof find Blessedness!\r\n   Was it not to preach-forth this same HIGHER that sages and\r\n   martyrs, the Poet and the Priest, in all times, have spoken and\r\n   suffered; bearing testimony, through life and through death,\r\n   of the Godlike that is in Man, and how in the Godlike only has\r\n   he Strength and Freedom? Which God-inspired Doctrine art thou\r\n   also honoured to be taught; O Heavens! and broken with manifold\r\n   merciful Afflictions, even till thou become contrite, and learn\r\n   it! O, thank thy Destiny for these; thankfully bear what yet\r\n   remain: thou hadst need of them; the Self in thee needed to be\r\n   annihilated. By benignant fever-paroxysms is Life rooting out\r\n   the deep-seated chronic Disease, and triumphs over Death. On the\r\n   roaring billows of Time, thou art not engulfed, but borne aloft\r\n   into the azure of Eternity. Love not Pleasure; love God. This\r\n   is the EVERLASTING YEA, wherein all contradiction is solved:\r\n   wherein whoso walks and works, it is well with him.”\r\n                                                _Sartor Resartus_\r\n\r\n\r\n   (2) The good man,[224] he was now getting old, towards sixty\r\n   perhaps; and gave you the idea of a life that had been full of\r\n   sufferings; a life heavy-laden, half-vanquished, still swimming\r\n   painfully in seas of manifold physical and other bewilderment.\r\n   Brow and head were round, and of massive weight, but the face\r\n   was flabby and irresolute. The deep eyes, of a light hazel,\r\n   were as full of sorrow as of inspiration; confused pain looked\r\n   mildly from them, as in a kind of mild astonishment. The whole\r\n   figure and air, good and amiable otherwise, might be called\r\n   flabby and irresolute; expressive of weakness under possibility\r\n   of strength. He hung loosely on his limbs, with knees bent,\r\n   and stooping attitude; in walking, he rather shuffled than\r\n   decisively stept; and a lady once remarked, he never could\r\n   fix which side of the garden walk would suit him best, but\r\n   continually shifted, in cork-screw fashion, and kept trying\r\n   both. A heavy-laden, high-aspiring, and surely much-suffering\r\n   man. His voice, naturally soft and good, had contracted\r\n   itself into a plaintive snuffle and sing-song; he spoke as if\r\n   preaching,--you would have said, preaching earnestly and also\r\n   hopelessly the weightiest things. I still recollect his “object”\r\n   and “subject,” terms of continual recurrence in the Kantean\r\n   province, and how he sang and snuffled them into “om-m-mject,”\r\n   “sum-m-mject,” with a kind of solemn shake or quaver, as he\r\n   rolled along. No talk, in his century or in any other, could be\r\n   more surprising.\r\n                                   _The Life of John Sterling_\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS BABINGTON MACAULAY (1800–59)\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= Macaulay was born in Leicestershire, his father being\r\nZachary Macaulay, the earnest upholder of negro emancipation. Macaulay\r\nwas educated privately, and then at Cambridge. From his infancy he was\r\nremarkable for his precocity and his prodigious memory. At Cambridge he\r\ntwice won the Chancellor’s Medal for English verse; and after taking\r\nhigh honors he was called to the Bar. By this time his father’s\r\nbusiness had collapsed, and Macaulay had to depend partly upon his pen\r\nfor a living. At first he contributed to _Knight’s Quarterly_, but\r\nlater he began writing his famous essays for _The Edinburgh Review_.\r\nHaving entered Parliament as a Whig (1830), a very promising political\r\ncareer seemed to be opening before him when he accepted a lucrative\r\nlegal post in India. He was in India for four years; then, returning to\r\nEngland, he re-entered political life, and became in turn Secretary of\r\nState for War and Paymaster of the Forces. In 1857 he was raised to the\r\npeerage, and died when he was still busy with his _History_.\r\n\r\n=2.= His =poetry= was nearly all written early in his career, and most\r\nof it is included in his _Lays of Ancient Rome_ (1842). In style the\r\npoems resemble the narrative poems of Scott, and in subject they are\r\nbased upon the legends of early Rome, the best-known dealing with the\r\nstory of Horatius. His verse is virile stuff, moving with vigor and\r\nassurance, and is full of action and color. Like his prose, however, it\r\nis hard and brassy, and quite lacking in the softer qualities of melody\r\nand sweetness and in the rich suggestiveness of the early ballad. It\r\nis not great poetry, but it will always be popular with those who like\r\nplenty of action and little contemplation.\r\n\r\n=3. His Prose Works.= Before he left for India Macaulay had written\r\ntwenty-two essays for _The Edinburgh Review_; he added three during his\r\nstay in India, and finished eleven others after he returned to England.\r\nWith the five biographies that he contributed to _The Encyclopedia\r\nBritannica_, these include all his shorter prose works. The essays\r\nare of two kinds--those dealing with literary subjects, such as those\r\non Milton, Byron, and Southey, and the historical studies, including\r\nthe famous compositions on Warren Hastings and Lord Clive. His method\r\nof essay-writing was as follows: he brought under review a set of\r\nvolumes that had already been published on the subject, then, after\r\na survey, long or short as the case might be, of these volumes, gave\r\nhis own views at great length. His opinions were often one-sided, and\r\nhis great parade of knowledge was often flawed with actual error or\r\ndistorted by his craving for antithesis and epigram; but the essays\r\nare clearly and ably written, and they disclose an eye for picturesque\r\neffect that in places is almost barbaric.\r\n\r\nHis _History of England_, the first volume of which was published in\r\n1849, was unfinished at his death. After two long preliminary chapters,\r\nit began with the Whig revolution of 1688, and Macaulay intended\r\nto carry the story down to his own time. But he managed to compass\r\nwithin the three completed volumes only the events of a few years.\r\nHis historical treatment is marked by the following features: (_a_)\r\nThere are numerous and picturesque details, which retard his narrative\r\nwhile they add to the general interest. (_b_) The desire for brilliant\r\neffect resulted in a hard, self-confident manner, and in a lack of\r\nbroader outlines and deeper views. These defects have deprived his\r\n_History_ of much of its permanent value. (_c_) To this he added such\r\na partiality for the Whig point of view that his statements, though\r\nthey are always interesting and illuminating, are generally distrusted\r\nas statements of fact. To sum up, he said, “I shall not be satisfied\r\nunless I produce something which shall for a few days supersede the\r\nlast fashionable novel on the tables of young ladies.” He had full\r\nreason to be satisfied; his book had an instant and enormous success,\r\nwhich, however, has been followed by distrust and neglect.\r\n\r\nThe extract given below gives some idea of his style. It is entirely\r\ndirect and clear, and free from any shade of doubt and hesitancy.\r\nObserve the use of the short detached sentence, and the copious and\r\nexpressive vocabulary:\r\n\r\n   Then was committed that great crime, memorable for its singular\r\n   atrocity, memorable for the tremendous retribution by which\r\n   it was followed. The English captives were left at the mercy\r\n   of the guards, and the guards determined to secure them for\r\n   the night in the prison of the garrison, a chamber known by\r\n   the fearful name of the Black Hole. Even for a single European\r\n   malefactor, that dungeon would, in such a climate, have been\r\n   too close and narrow. The space was only twenty feet square.\r\n   The air-holes were small and obstructed. It was the summer\r\n   solstice, the season when the fierce heat of Bengal can scarcely\r\n   be rendered tolerable to natives of England by lofty halls and\r\n   by the constant waving of fans. The number of the prisoners was\r\n   one hundred and forty-six. When they were ordered to enter the\r\n   cell, they imagined that the soldiers were joking; and, being\r\n   in high spirits on account of the promise of the Nabob to spare\r\n   their lives, they laughed and jested at the absurdity of the\r\n   notion. They soon discovered their mistake. They expostulated;\r\n   they entreated; but in vain. The guards threatened to cut down\r\n   all who hesitated. The captives were driven into the cell at the\r\n   point of the sword, and the door was instantly shut and locked\r\n   upon them.\r\n                                                 _Essay on Clive_\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN RUSKIN (1819–1900)\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= Ruskin was born in London, of Scottish parentage,\r\nand was educated privately before he went to Oxford. During his\r\nboyhood he often traveled with his father, whose business activities\r\ninvolved journeys both in England and abroad. After leaving the\r\nuniversity Ruskin, who did not need to earn a living, settled down\r\nto a literary career. He was not long in developing advanced notions\r\non art, politics, economics, and other subjects. In art he was in\r\nparticular devoted to the cause of the landscape-painter Turner, and\r\nin social and economic theories he was an advocate of an advanced form\r\nof socialism. To the present generation his ideas appear innocuous, or\r\neven inevitable, but by the public of his own day they were received\r\nwith shocked dismay. At first the only notice he received was in the\r\njeers of his adversaries; but gradually his fame spread as he freely\r\nexpounded his opinions in lectures and pamphlets, as well as in his\r\nlonger books. In 1869 he was appointed Slade Professor of Fine Arts at\r\nOxford. Illness, however, which was aggravated by hard work and mental\r\nworries, led him to resign (1879) after a few years; and though shortly\r\nafterward (1883) he resumed the post, it had at last to be abandoned.\r\nHe retired to Brantwood, on Coniston Water, in the Lake District, where\r\nhe lived till his death, his later years being clouded by disease and\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\n=2. His Works.= Ruskin’s works are of immense volume and complexity.\r\nThey were often issued in a haphazard fashion, and this makes it all\r\nthe more difficult to follow the order of their publication. For a\r\nstart he plunged into what turned out to be the longest of his books,\r\n_Modern Painters_, the first volume of which was issued in 1843 and\r\nthe fifth and last in 1860. This work, beginning as a thesis in\r\ndefense of the painting of Turner, develops Ruskin’s opinions on many\r\nother subjects. The first volume was not long in attracting notice,\r\nchiefly owing to its sumptuous style, which was of a kind unknown in\r\nEnglish for centuries. _The Seven Lamps of Architecture_ (1849) is a\r\nshorter and more popular work, which once again expounds his views on\r\nartistic matters. _The Stones of Venice_ (1851–53), in four volumes,\r\nis considered to be his masterpiece both in thought and style. It is\r\nless diffuse than _Modern Painters_; there is a little more plan in the\r\nimmense array of discursive matter; and the luxuriance of the style is\r\nsomewhat curtailed. His other writings are of a miscellaneous kind,\r\nand comprise _The Two Paths_ (1859), a course of lectures; _Unto this\r\nLast_ (1860), a series of articles on political economy which began\r\nto appear in _The Cornhill Magazine_, but were stopped owing to their\r\nhostile reception; _Munera Pulveris_ (1862), also an unfinished series\r\nof articles on political economy, published in _Fraser’s Magazine_, and\r\nalso withdrawn owing to their advanced views; _The Crown of Wild Olive_\r\n(1864), a series of addresses; _Sesame and Lilies_ (1865), a course of\r\nthree lectures, which is now the most popular of his shorter works; and\r\n_Præterita_, which first began to appear in 1855, and which is a kind\r\nof autobiography.\r\n\r\n=3. His Style.= Ruskin himself often deplored the fact that people\r\nread him more for his style than for his creed. His views, which he\r\nargued with power and sincerity, must in time give way to others; many\r\nof them are now self-evident, so rapid sometimes is the progress of the\r\nhuman intellect; but his prose style, an art as delicate and beautiful\r\nas any of those he spent his life in supporting, will long remain a\r\ndelectable study. For its like we must return to the prose of Milton\r\nand Clarendon, and refine and sweeten the manner of these early masters\r\nto reproduce the effect that Ruskin achieves. In its less ornate\r\npassages Ruskin’s diction is marked by a sweet and unforced simplicity;\r\nbut his pages abound in purple passages, which are marked by sentences\r\nof immense length, carefully punctuated, by a gorgeous march of image\r\nand epithet, and by a sumptuous rhythm that sometimes grows into actual\r\nblank verse capable of scansion. In his later books Ruskin to a certain\r\nextent eschewed his grandiose manner, and wrote the language of the\r\nBible, modernized and made supple; but to the very end he was always\r\nable to rise to the lyrical mood and fill a page with a strong and\r\nsonorous sentence.\r\n\r\nThe paragraph given below, it will be noticed, is one sentence. Observe\r\nthe minute care given to the punctuation, the aptness of epithet, and\r\nthe rhythm, which in several places is so regular that the matter can\r\nbe scanned like poetry.\r\n\r\n   Then let us pass farther towards the north, until we see the\r\n   orient colours change gradually into a vast belt of rainy green,\r\n   where the pastures of Switzerland, and poplar valleys of France,\r\n   and dark forests of the Danube and Carpathians stretch from the\r\n   mouths of the Loire to those of the Volga, seen through clefts\r\n   in gray swirls of rain-cloud and flaky veils of the mist of\r\n   the brooks, spreading low along the pasture lands: and then,\r\n   farther north still, to see the earth heave into mighty masses\r\n   of leaden rock and heathy moor, bordering with a broad waste of\r\n   gloomy purple that belt of field and wood, and splintering into\r\n   irregular and grisly islands amidst the northern seas, beaten by\r\n   storm, and chilled by ice-drift, and tormented by furious pulses\r\n   of contending tide, until the roots of the last forests fall\r\n   from among the hill ravines, and the hunger of the north wind\r\n   bites their peaks into barrenness; and, at last, the wall of\r\n   ice, durable like iron, sets, deathlike, its white teeth against\r\n   us out of the polar twilight.\r\n                                            _The Stones of Venice_\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER WRITERS OF MISCELLANEOUS PROSE\r\n\r\n=1. John Addington Symonds (1840–93)= was among the foremost of the\r\nliterary critics who flourished after the middle of the century. He\r\nwas the son of a Bristol physician, and was educated at Harrow and\r\nOxford. A tendency to consumption checked whatever desire he had to\r\nstudy the law, and much of his life was spent abroad.\r\n\r\nA large proportion of his work was contributed to periodicals, and was\r\ncollected and issued in volume form. The best collection is _Studies of\r\nthe Greek Poets_ (1873). His longest work is _The Renaissance in Italy_\r\n(1875–86), in which he contests Ruskin’s views on art. In style he is\r\noften ornate and even florid, and in treatment he can be diffuse to\r\ntediousness; but as a critic he is shrewd and well informed.\r\n\r\n=2. Walter Horatio Pater (1839–94)= was, both as a stylist and as a\r\nliterary critic, superior to Symonds. Born in London, he was educated\r\nat Canterbury and Oxford, becoming finally a Fellow of Brasenose.\r\nHe devoted himself to art and literature, producing some remarkable\r\nvolumes on these subjects.\r\n\r\nHis first essays appeared in book-form as _Studies in the History of\r\nthe Renaissance_ (1878), and were concerned chiefly with art; _Marius\r\nthe Epicurean_ (1885) is a remarkable philosophical novel, and is the\r\nbest example of his distinguished style; _Imaginary Portraits_ (1887)\r\ndeals with artists; and _Appreciations_ (1889) is on literary themes,\r\nand is prefaced by an important essay on style.\r\n\r\nPater’s individual style is among the most notable of the latter\r\npart of the century. It is the creation of immense application and\r\nforethought; every word is conned, every sentence proved, and every\r\nrhythm appraised, until we have the perfection of finished workmanship.\r\nIt is never cheap, but firm and equable, with the strength and\r\nmassiveness of bronze. Its very perfections are a burden, especially\r\nin his novel; it tends to become frigid and lifeless, and the subtle\r\ndallyings with refinements of meaning thin it down to mere euphuism. In\r\nthe novel the action is chilled, and the characters frozen until they\r\nresemble rather a group of statuary than a collection of human beings.\r\n\r\n=3. James Anthony Froude (1818–94)= was born near Totnes, where his\r\nfather was archdeacon. After three years at Westminster School he\r\nproceeded to Oxford, where he was not long in feeling the effects of\r\nthe High Church movement led by Newman. From this he afterward broke\r\naway, and was elected to a fellowship at Exeter College. He toiled\r\nardently at literary work, contributing freely to _The Westminster\r\nReview_ and other magazines. In 1860 he became editor of _Fraser’s\r\nMagazine_.\r\n\r\nFroude was a man of strong opinions, to which he gave free expression\r\nboth by voice and pen, and his career was often marked with\r\ncontroversy. His handling of the life of Carlyle provoked much angry\r\ncomment. In the course of time his true merits came to be valued\r\nadequately, and after being appointed to several Government commissions\r\nhe was elected (1892) Regius Professor of History at Oxford.\r\n\r\nFroude’s miscellaneous work was published in four volumes called\r\n_Short Studies on Great Subjects_ (1867–83). His _History of England_\r\n(1856–69) was issued in twelve volumes. In period it covers the time of\r\nthe Reformation, and in method it follows the lead of Carlyle in its\r\ngreat detail and picturesque description. In its general attitude it is\r\nan indirect, and therefore an unfair, attack upon the High Church views\r\nof Newman. The work, nevertheless, is composed with much vigor, and is\r\nin the main accurate, though slightly lax in detail. Other books are\r\n_The English in Ireland_ (1871–74), _Cæsar_ (1879), _Oceana_ (1886),\r\nand an Irish novel, _The Two Chiefs of Dunboy_ (1889). His biography of\r\nCarlyle was issued during the period 1882–84.\r\n\r\n=4. The Historians.= The nineteenth century produced many historical\r\nwriters, of whom only a very few can find a place here.\r\n\r\n(_a_) =Alexander Kinglake (1809–91)= was born near Taunton, and\r\neducated at Eton and Cambridge. He was called to the Bar, and\r\npracticed with some success, but in 1856 he retired to devote himself\r\nto literature. He saw much of the world, and watched the progress of\r\nthe war in the Crimea. In 1857 he became Member of Parliament for\r\nBridgwater.\r\n\r\nHis _History of the Crimean War_ (1863–87) is enormously bulky and full\r\nof detail. In attitude it is too favorable to the British commander,\r\nLord Raglan, and in style it is tawdry; at its best, however, it is a\r\npicturesque narrative. His other work of note is _Eothen_ (1844), a\r\nclever account of Eastern travel.\r\n\r\n(_b_) =John Richard Green (1837–83)= was born and educated at Oxford,\r\nand became a curate in the East End of London. He was delicate in\r\nhealth, and was compelled to retire from his charge in 1869. His last\r\nyears were spent in writing his historical works.\r\n\r\nOf these works the best is _A Short History of the English People_\r\n(1874), which at once took rank as one of the few popular text-books\r\nwhich are also literature. It is devoted to the history of the _people_\r\nand not to wars and high politics. It is told with a terse simplicity\r\nthat is quite admirable. _The Making of England_ (1882) and _The\r\nConquest of England_ (1883) are the only two other works he lived to\r\nfinish.\r\n\r\n(_c_) =Edward Augustus Freeman (1823–92)= was celebrated as the chief\r\nopponent of Froude. He was educated privately, and then at Oxford,\r\nwhere he became a Fellow of Trinity College and Regius Professor\r\nof Modern History (1884). He wrote many historical works, the most\r\nvaluable of which are _The History of the Norman Conquest_ (1867–79)\r\nand _The Reign of William Rufus_ (1882). Freeman specialized in certain\r\nperiods of English history, which he treated laboriously and at great\r\nlength. This, as well as his arid style, makes his history unattractive\r\nto read, but he did much solid and enthusiastic work for the benefit of\r\nhis students and successors.\r\n\r\n=5. The Scientists.= The nineteenth century beheld the exposition\r\nof scientific themes raised to the level of a literary art.\r\n\r\n(_a_) =Hugh Miller (1802–56)= was a natural genius, self-taught and\r\nself-inspired. He was born at Cromarty, in the north of Scotland, and\r\nbecame a stonemason, in which capacity he studied geology. In 1835 he\r\nbecame an accountant in a bank. He wrote much for the periodical press,\r\nand his writing attracted considerable notice. Latterly he suffered\r\nfrom mental disorder, and in the end committed suicide.\r\n\r\n_The Old Red Sandstone_ (1841) contains much patient observation of\r\ngeological fact, and is still regarded as a valuable contribution to\r\nthe subject; _The Testimony of the Rocks_ (1857) appeared after his\r\ndeath. He wrote a little fiction of mediocre quality, published as\r\n_Tales and Sketches_ (1863). Miller’s style is unforced and often\r\nimpressive, and for sincerity, piety, and homely wisdom his books leave\r\nlittle to be desired.\r\n\r\n(_b_) =Charles Darwin (1809–82)= is one of the greatest names in\r\nmodern science. He was born at Shrewsbury, where he received his early\r\neducation, passing later to Cambridge. In 1831 he became naturalist in\r\n_The Beagle_, a man-of-war that went around the world on a scientific\r\nmission. This lucky chance determined his career as a scientist. The\r\nremainder of his life was laboriously uneventful, being devoted almost\r\nwholly to biological and allied studies.\r\n\r\nHis chief works are _The Voyage of the Beagle_ (1836), a mine of\r\naccurate and interesting facts; _The Origin of Species_ (1859),\r\nwhich is to modern science what _The Wealth of Nations_ is to modern\r\neconomics--the foundation of belief; and _The Descent of Man_ (1871).\r\nWe cannot discuss his theories of evolution, but as general literature\r\nhis books possess a living interest owing to their rich array of\r\ngarnered evidence and their masterly gifts of exposition and argument.\r\n\r\n(_c_) =Thomas Henry Huxley (1825–95)= was one of the ablest and most\r\nenergetic of Darwin’s supporters. He was born at Ealing, and became a\r\nsurgeon in the Navy. His first post was on Nelson’s _Victory_. Like\r\nDarwin, he traveled abroad on a warship, _The Rattlesnake_, and during\r\nthese four years (1846–50) he saw and learned much. Retiring from\r\nthe Navy, he took enthusiastically to scientific research, and became\r\nPresident of the Royal Society and a prominent public figure in the\r\nheated discussions concerning the theories that were then so new and\r\ndisturbing.\r\n\r\nHuxley produced no work in the same class as _The Origin of Species_.\r\nHis work consisted of lectures and addresses, which were issued in\r\nvolume form as _Man’s Place in Nature_ (1863), _Lay Sermons and\r\nAddresses_ (1870), and _American Lectures_ (1877).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF LITERARY FORMS\r\n\r\nThe Victorian epoch was exceedingly productive of literary work of a\r\nhigh quality, but the amount of actual innovation is by no means great.\r\nWriters were as a rule content to work upon former models, and the\r\nimprovements they did achieve were often dubious and unimportant.\r\n\r\n=1. Poetry.= (_a_) The _lyrical_ output is very large and varied, as\r\na glance through the works of the poets already mentioned will show.\r\nIn form there is little of fresh interest. Tennyson was content to\r\nfollow the methods of Keats, though Browning’s complicated forms and\r\nSwinburne’s long musical lines were more freely used by them than by\r\nany previous writers.\r\n\r\n(_b_) In _descriptive and narrative poetry_ there is a greater advance\r\nto chronicle. In subject--for example, in the poems of Browning and\r\nMorris--there is great variety, embracing many climes and periods; in\r\nmethod there is much diversity, ranging from the cultured elegance of\r\nTennyson’s English landscapes to the wild impressionism of Whitman\r\nin America. The Pre-Raphaelite school, also, united several features\r\nwhich had not been seen before in combination. These were a fondness\r\nfor medieval themes treated in an unconventional manner, a richly\r\ncolored pictorial effect, and a studied and melodious simplicity. The\r\nworks of Rossetti, Morris, and Swinburne provide many examples of this\r\ndevelopment of poetry. On the whole we can say that the Victorians were\r\nstrongest on the descriptive side of poetry, which agreed with the\r\nmore meditative habits of the period, as contrasted with the warmer and\r\nmore lyrical emotions of the previous age.\r\n\r\nThere were many attempts at purely narrative poetry, with interesting\r\nresults. Tennyson thought of reviving the epic, but in him the\r\nepical impulse was not sufficiently strong, and his great narrative\r\npoem was produced as smaller fragments which he called idylls.\r\nBrowning’s _Ring and the Book_ is curious, for it can be called a\r\npsychological epic--a narrative in which emotion removes action from\r\nthe chief place. In this class of poetry _The Earthly Paradise_ of\r\nWilliam Morris is a return to the old romantic tale as we find it in\r\nthe works of Chaucer.\r\n\r\n=2. Drama.= Nearly all the major poets of the period wrote tragedy\r\non the lines of the accepted models. Few of these attained to real\r\ndistinction; they were rather the conscientious efforts of men who\r\nwere striving to succeed in the impossible task of really reviving the\r\npoetical drama. Of them all, Swinburne’s tragedies, especially those\r\nconcerned with Mary Queen of Scots, possess the greatest warmth and\r\nenergy; and Browning’s earlier plays, before he over-developed his\r\nstyle, have sincerity and sometimes real dramatic power. As for comedy,\r\nit was almost wholly neglected as a purely literary form.\r\n\r\nA development to be noticed is the popularity of the _dramatic\r\nmonologue_. In _Ulysses_, _Tithonus_, and other pieces Tennyson\r\nachieved some of his most successful results; and Browning’s host of\r\nmonologues, wide in range and striking in detail, are perhaps his\r\ngreatest contribution to literature. The method common to this kind of\r\nmonologue was to take some character and make him reveal his inmost\r\nself in his own words.\r\n\r\n=3. Prose.= (_a_) By the middle of the nineteenth century the _novel_,\r\nas a species of literature, had thrust itself into the first rank. We\r\nshall therefore consider it first.\r\n\r\nIn the novels of Thackeray and Dickens the various qualities of the\r\ndomestic novel are gathered together and carried a stage forward.\r\nDickens did much to idealize the England of his day, and to depict\r\nthe life of the lower and middle classes with imagination and humor.\r\nAs a satirist and an observer of manners Thackeray easily excels his\r\ncontemporaries. The other novelists were to a great extent gleaners\r\nin the spacious field that was reaped by the two greater writers.\r\nCharlotte Brontë supplied a somber passion that colored the drabness of\r\nher life; Trollope specialized with his parsons; Collins wrote mystery\r\nstories. Of the rest, George Eliot showed a closeness of application\r\nto the mental process of her characters that was carried further in\r\nthe work of Meredith, and has led to the “psychological” novels of the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nIn _Esmond_ the historical novel made an advance. Here Thackeray was\r\nnot content to master the history of the period he described; he sought\r\nto reproduce also the language and atmosphere. This is an extremely\r\ndifficult thing to achieve, and is possible only in novels dealing with\r\na limited period of time, but Thackeray scored a remarkable success.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The development of the _Short story_, as a separate species of\r\nliterature, will be touched upon in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n(_c_) In the case of the _essay_ we have to note the expansion of the\r\nliterary type into the treatise-in-little. This method was made popular\r\nby Macaulay, and continued by Carlyle, Symonds, Pater, and many others.\r\nOf the miscellaneous essayists, both Dickens, in some parts of _The\r\nUncommercial Traveller_, and Thackeray, in _The Roundabout Papers_,\r\nsuccessfully practiced the shorter Addisonian type; and this again was\r\nenlarged and made more pretentious by Ruskin, Pater, and Stevenson.\r\n\r\n(_d_) The _lecture_ becomes a prominent literary species for a time.\r\nCarlyle, Thackeray, Dickens, and many others both in England and\r\nAmerica published lectures in book-form. Earlier critics like Hazlitt\r\nand Coleridge had done so; but, almost for the first time, Ruskin gave\r\na distinct style and manner to the lecture.\r\n\r\n(_e_) The _historians_ are strongly represented. Carlyle and Macaulay,\r\nin spite of their great industry and real care for history, have\r\nnow fallen behind in the race as historians, and survive chiefly as\r\nstylists. The new method that arose was typified in the solid and\r\nvaluable work of =William Stubbs (1825–1901)=, =Edward A. Freeman\r\n(1823–92)=, and =Samuel R. Gardiner (1829–1902)=. These historians\r\navoided the charms of literary style, concentrated upon some aspect of\r\nhistory, and, basing their results upon patient research into original\r\nauthorities, produced valuable additions to human knowledge.\r\n\r\n(_f_) We have already noticed that in this period the _scientific\r\ntreatise_ attained to literary rank. We may mention as early examples\r\nof this type Sir Thomas Browne’s curious treatise on _Urne Buriall_,\r\nBurton’s _Anatomy of Melancholy_, and the graceful essays of Berkeley.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF LITERARY STYLE\r\n\r\nWith such an amount of writing as characterizes this age it is quite\r\ncertain that both in prose and poetry a wide range of style will be\r\nobservable.\r\n\r\n=1. Poetry.= In the case of poetry the more ornate style was\r\nrepresented in Tennyson, who developed artistic schemes of vowel-music,\r\nalliteration, and other devices in a manner quite unprecedented. The\r\nPre-Raphaelites carried the method still further. In diction they were\r\nsimpler than Tennyson, but their vocabulary was more archaic and their\r\nmass of detail more highly colored. The style of Browning was to a\r\ncertain extent a protest against this aureate diction. He substituted\r\nfor it simplicity and a heady speed, especially in his earlier\r\nlyrics; his more mature obscurity was merely an effect of his eager\r\nimagination and reckless impetuosity. Matthew Arnold, in addition, was\r\ntoo classical in style to care for over-developed picturesqueness, and\r\nwrote with a studied simplicity. On the whole, however, we can say\r\nthat the average poetical style of this period, as a natural reaction\r\nagainst the simpler methods of the period immediately preceding, was\r\nornate rather than simple.\r\n\r\n=2. Prose.= With regard to prose, the greater proportion by far is\r\nwritten in the middle style, the established medium in journalism, in\r\nall manner of miscellaneous work, and in the majority of the novels.\r\nOutside this mass of middle prose, the style of Ruskin stands highest\r\nin the scale of ornateness; of a like kind are the scholarly elegance\r\nof Pater and the mannered dictions of Meredith and Stevenson. The style\r\nof Carlyle and that of Macaulay are each a peculiar brand of the middle\r\nstyle, Macaulay’s being hard, clear, and racy, and Carlyle’s gruff and\r\ntempestuous, with an occasional passage of soothing beauty.\r\n\r\nOf the simpler writers there is a large number, among whom many\r\nnovelists find a place. We have space here to refer only to the\r\neasygoing journalistic manner of Dickens and to the sub-acid flavor of\r\nthe prose of Thackeray.\r\n\r\nWe add a specimen of Stevenson’s prose style. This style, which\r\nin its mannered precision is typical of many modern prose styles,\r\nis noteworthy on account of its careful selection of epithet, its\r\nclear-cut expressiveness, and its delicate rhythm.\r\n\r\n   But Hermiston was not all of one piece. He was, besides, a\r\n   mighty toper; he could sit at wine until the day dawned, and\r\n   pass directly from the table to the Bench with a steady hand and\r\n   a clear head. Beyond the third bottle, he showed the plebeian\r\n   in a larger print; the low, gross accent, the low, foul mirth,\r\n   grew broader and commoner; he became less formidable, and\r\n   infinitely more disgusting. Now, the boy had inherited from\r\n   Jean Rutherford a shivering delicacy, unequally mated with\r\n   potential violence. In the playing-fields, and amongst his\r\n   own companions, he repaid a coarse expression with a blow; at\r\n   his father’s table (when the time came for him to join these\r\n   revels) he turned pale and sickened in silence. Of all the\r\n   guests whom he there encountered, he had toleration for only\r\n   one: David Keith Carnegie, Lord Glenalmond. Lord Glenalmond was\r\n   tall and emaciated, with long features and long delicate hands.\r\n   He was often compared with the statue of Forbes of Culloden in\r\n   the Parliament House; and his blue eye, at more than sixty,\r\n   preserved some of the fire of youth. His exquisite disparity\r\n   with any of his fellow-guests, his appearance, as of an artist\r\n   and an aristocrat stranded in rude company, rivetted the boy’s\r\n   attention; and as curiosity and interest are the things in the\r\n   world that are the most immediately and certainly rewarded, Lord\r\n   Glenalmond was attracted to the boy.\r\n                                                _Weir of Hermiston_\r\n\r\n\r\n         TABLE TO ILLUSTRATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF LITERARY FORMS\r\n\r\n    +-------------+-----------------------------+---------------------+------------------------------------+\r\n    |             |           POETRY            |         DRAMA       |               PROSE                |\r\n    |             |--------------+--------------+------------+--------+------------+---------+-------------+\r\n    |    DATE     |    Lyrical   |  Narrative-  |  Tragedy   | Comedy |    Novel   |  Essay  |Miscellaneous|\r\n    |             |              |  Descriptive |            |        |            |         |             |\r\n    +-------------+--------------+--------------+------------+--------+------------+---------+-------------+\r\n    |             |              |              |            |        |            |Carlyle  |Macaulay     |\r\n    |             |Tennyson[225] |              |            |        |            |         |             |\r\n    |             |              |Tennyson[226] |            |        |            |         |Carlyle[227] |\r\n    |             |              |Browning[228] |            |        |            |         |             |\r\n    |             |              |              |            |        |Dickens[229]|Macaulay |             |\r\n    |1840         |E.B.

In the following extracts point out the features of subject and\r\nstyle that are characteristic of their respective authors. In each case\r\nsay how far the style suits the subject.\r\n\r\n   (1) Day has bent downwards. Wearied mortals are creeping home\r\n   from their field labour; the village artisan eats with relish\r\n   his supper of herbs, or has strolled forth to the village\r\n   street for a sweet mouthful of air and human news. Still\r\n   summer-eventide everywhere! The great sun hangs flaming on the\r\n   utmost Northwest; for it is his longest day this year. The\r\n   hill-tops rejoicing will erelong be at their ruddiest, and blush\r\n   Good-night. The thrush, in green dells, on long-shadowed leafy\r\n   spray, pours gushing his glad serenade, to the babble of brooks\r\n   grown audibler; silence is stealing over the Earth.\r\n                                  CARLYLE, _The French Revolution_\r\n\r\n\r\n   (2) Monmouth was startled by finding that a broad and profound\r\n   trench lay between him and the camp which he had hoped to\r\n   surprise. The insurgents halted on the edge of the rhine and\r\n   fired. Part of the royal infantry on the opposite bank returned\r\n   the fire. During three-quarters of an hour the roar of the\r\n   musketry was incessant. The Somersetshire peasants behaved\r\n   themselves as if they had been veteran soldiers, save only that\r\n   they levelled their pieces too high.\r\n                              MACAULAY, _The History of England_\r\n\r\n\r\n   (3) We may not measure to the full the depth of this heavenly\r\n   gift, in our own land; though still, as we think of it longer,\r\n   the infinite of that meadow sweetness, Shakespeare’s peculiar\r\n   joy, would open on us more and more, yet we have it but in\r\n   part. Go out, in the spring time, among the meadows that slope\r\n   from the shores of the Swiss lakes to the roots of their lower\r\n   mountains. There, mingled with the taller gentians and the white\r\n   narcissus, the grass grows deep and free; and as you follow\r\n   the winding mountain paths, beneath arching boughs all veiled\r\n   and dim with blossom--paths that for ever droop and rise over\r\n   the green banks and mounds sweeping down in scented undulation,\r\n   steep to the blue water, studded here and there with new-mown\r\n   heaps, filling all the air with fainter sweetness--look up\r\n   towards the higher hills, where the waves of everlasting green\r\n   roll silently into their long inlets among the shadows of the\r\n   pines; and we may, perhaps, at last know the meaning of those\r\n   quiet words of the 147th Psalm, “He maketh grass to grow up on\r\n   the mountains.”\r\n                                      RUSKIN, _Modern Painters_\r\n\r\n\r\n    (4)     Rats!\r\n        They fought the dogs and killed the cats,\r\n          And bit the babies in the cradles,\r\n        And ate the cheeses out of the vats,\r\n          And licked the soup from the cooks’ own ladles,\r\n        Split open the kegs of salted sprats,\r\n        Made nests inside men’s Sunday hats,\r\n        And even spoiled the women’s chats,\r\n          By drowning their speaking\r\n          With shrieking and squeaking\r\n        In fifty different sharps and flats.\r\n                       BROWNING, _The Pied Piper of Hamelin_\r\n\r\n3.

It is a time of unrest, of a hardening of temper, of\r\nthe decay of the larger Victorian ideals, and of the growth of a more\r\ncritical, cynical, and analytic spirit. The period, one will find, is\r\nnot very rich in literature of the highest class; and looking back over\r\nour literature, and studying the rise and fall of the literary impulse,\r\nthe alternation of rich harvest with lean years, one is tempted to\r\nregard the post-Victorian age as an interval between two epochs,\r\nbetween the great Victorian age and another, still to be, that will be\r\nas truly great.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY FEATURES OF THE AGE\r\n\r\n=1. Decline of Poetry.= For almost the first time in the history\r\nof English literature the poetical product must be relegated to a\r\nsubordinate position. Much verse, some of great charm and considerable\r\npower, has been written, but very little of real outstanding literary\r\nimportance. It is this decided decline in the poetical spirit that must\r\nmake the period take an inferior place in our literary history. Even\r\nthe Great War failed to produce a poet who might proclaim its ideals\r\nas Wordsworth did those of the French Revolution. One is reluctantly\r\ndriven to conclude that the divine poetical impulse was not there.\r\n\r\n=2. The Domination of the Novel.= Comparatively late in its\r\nappearance, the novel has now become the most prominent of the\r\nliterary forms. The output is enormous, the general level quite\r\nhigh, and the scope of its subject almost all-embracing. The growth\r\nof the popular press, including the cheap magazine specializing in\r\nthe production of fiction, the cheapening of books and journals, the\r\nincreasing use of shorthand and the typewriter, all combine to add to\r\nthe torrent of fiction.\r\n\r\n=3. Modern “Realism.”= The tendency of the time is to avoid\r\nsentiment, and to look upon life critically and even cynically. There\r\nis a supercilious attitude toward enthusiasm, which is banned as\r\nbeing “Victorian,” a word which has assumed a derogatory meaning.\r\nIn the domain of fiction this feeling is the strongest. Victorian\r\nconvention is anathema; all subjects are explored, and handled with\r\na frankness that would have horrified the moralists of the earlier\r\nage. A particularly strong school of novelists is interested in social\r\nsubjects, and is affected with the prevailing economic unrest.\r\n\r\n=4. Foreign Influences.= In other countries the same tendency\r\ntoward realism is apparent, and has helped the movement in England.\r\nIn Europe there were two geniuses of international importance, and\r\nboth of them were fired with revolutionary social ideals: Henrik Ibsen\r\n(1828–1906), the Norse dramatist, and Leo Tolstoï (1828–1910), the\r\nRussian novelist. The influence of Ibsen went right to the roots of\r\nEnglish drama, and the works of Tolstoï awoke English readers to the\r\nimportance of Russian fiction, which is strongly realistic. French\r\nnovelists of the realistic school, such as Émile Zola (1840–1902), had\r\ntheir share in the development of the English novel.\r\n\r\n=5. The Celtic Revival.= The revival of Irish literature is of\r\nmuch interest. It began in the effort of a group of writers to preserve\r\nand reanimate Irish sentiment and (to a certain extent) the Irish\r\nlanguage. It has affected all branches of literature: it has affected\r\npoetry, producing poems such as those of Mr. Yeats; it has created\r\na type of drama, and a theater in which to act it; its dramatists\r\ninclude Mr. Synge, Lady Gregory, and (partly) Mr. Shaw; it has added a\r\nnovelist of importance in George Moore; and it has a worthy example of\r\na man of letters in George Russell, whose _nom de plume_ is “A. E.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS HARDY\r\n\r\nWe shall deal with three outstanding novelists, each of whom is\r\nrepresentative of a different class. We shall have space sufficient for\r\na small number only of the other novelists.\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= Thomas Hardy was born (1840) in Dorsetshire, and\r\nafter being educated locally finished his studies at King’s College,\r\nLondon. He adopted the profession of an architect, being specially\r\ninterested in the architecture of early churches. Ambitious to achieve\r\nfame as an author, he began, as so many other literary aspirants have\r\ndone, with poetry. In this branch of literature he met with scant\r\nrecognition; so, when he was over thirty years old, he took to the\r\nwriting of novels. These too had no popular success, though they did\r\nnot go unpraised by discerning critics. Nevertheless, Hardy continued\r\nuninterruptedly to issue works of fiction, which gradually but surely\r\nbrought him fame. He was enabled to abandon his profession as an\r\narchitect and retire to his native Dorchester, where he lived the life\r\nof a literary recluse. Popular applause, which he had never courted, in\r\nthe end came in full measure. On the occasion of his eightieth birthday\r\nthe greatest literary figures of the day united to do him homage, and\r\nthe King, with characteristic felicity, sent a message of gracious\r\ncompliment. Some years previously (1910) he had received the Order of\r\nMerit, no inappropriate distinction.\r\n\r\n=2. His Poetry.= As early as 1865, and thence onward, Mr. Hardy\r\nissued fugitive pieces of poetry, which were at length collected\r\nand published as _Wessex Poems_ (1898). Many of the poems,\r\nnone of which is very long, are of the dramatic monologue type. The\r\ntypical Hardy note is apparent in nearly all of them; a careful and\r\nmeasured utterance, a stern eye for the tragedy of common things,\r\nand a somber submission to the dictates of an unkind fate. One or two\r\nof them are brighter, with a wry kind of humor, like the well-known\r\n_Valenciennes_. A second collection, _Poems of the Past and\r\nPresent_ (1901), has a deeper and more sardonic note, but the\r\nfeeling of pitiful regret is still predominant. This is particularly so\r\nin the poems on the South African War. _The Dead Drummer_, a poem\r\nof this group, three brief stanzas in length, tells of Drummer Hodge\r\nslain and buried in the veld. The Hardy attitude is almost perfectly\r\nrevealed in the last stanza:\r\n\r\n    Yet portion of that unknown plain\r\n      Will Hodge for ever be;\r\n    His homely northern breast and brain\r\n      Grow up a southern tree;\r\n    And strange-eyed constellations reign\r\n      His stars eternally.\r\n\r\nIn _The Dynasts_, which was published in several parts between\r\n1903 and 1908, we meet with Mr. Hardy’s most ambitious poetical effort.\r\nIn scope the poem is vast, for it deals with the Napoleonic wars, with\r\nall Europe for its scene. In length it is prodigious, and before the\r\nreader has reached the end he is overwhelmed with the magnitude of\r\nit. In form it is dramatic, in the sense that Shelley’s _Prometheus\r\nUnbound_ is dramatic; the scene shifts from point to point, the\r\nhistorical figures utter long monologues, and superhuman intelligences,\r\nsuch as Pity and the Spirit of the Years, add commentaries upon the\r\nactivities of mankind. Above and behind all of it broods a sense of\r\nstern fatalism--the Immanent Will, as the author calls it; and in\r\nfront of this enormous curtain of fate and futility even the figure of\r\nNapoleon is dwarfed and impotent.\r\n\r\n_Satires of Circumstance_ (1914) is another collection of shorter\r\npieces. The satires themselves, which occupy quite a small portion of\r\nthe book, are almost brutal and rancorous in their choice and treatment\r\nof unhappy incidents. No doubt their author judges such a tone to be\r\nnecessary in the production of satire. The effect is very impressive.\r\nFor example, in the short piece called _In the Cemetery_ he begins:\r\n\r\n    “You see those mothers squabbling there?”\r\n    Remarks the man of the cemetery.\r\n    “One says in tears, ‘_’Tis mine lies here!_’\r\n    Another, ‘_Nay, mine, you Pharisee!_’\r\n    Another, ‘_How dare you move my flowers\r\n    And put your own on this grave of ours!_’\r\n    But all their children were laid therein\r\n    At different times, like sprats in a tin.”\r\n\r\nAnd the cemetery man goes on to say that all the bodies had been\r\nremoved to make room for a drain-pipe, and that the quarreling was\r\ntaking place over the drain-pipe.\r\n\r\nA further group of poems in this same volume is called _Poems of\r\n1912–1913_. In this group of poems, which are elegiac in nature,\r\nMr. Hardy’s lyrical genius develops a late but splendid bloom. It is\r\nunique in our history for a poet over seventy years old to surpass all\r\nthe efforts of his prime. In the depth of their emotion and the terse\r\nadequacy of their style they represent the consummation of his poetry.\r\nWe quote briefly:\r\n\r\n    (1) I found her out there\r\n        On a slope few see,\r\n        That falls westwardly\r\n        To the sharp-edged air,\r\n        Where the ocean breaks\r\n        On the purple strand,\r\n        And the hurricane shakes\r\n        The solid land.\r\n\r\n    (2) Nobody says: Ah, that is the place\r\n        Where chanced, in the hollow of years ago,\r\n        What none of the Three Towns cared to know--\r\n        The birth of a little girl of grace--\r\n        The sweetest the house saw, first or last;\r\n              Yet it was so\r\n              On that day long past.\r\n\r\n        Nobody thinks: There, there she lay\r\n        In a room by the Hoe, like the bud of a flower,\r\n        And listened, just after the bed time hour,\r\n        To the stammering chimes that used to play\r\n        The quaint Old Hundred-and-Thirteenth tune\r\n              In Saint Andrew’s tower\r\n              Night, morn, and noon.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n        Nay: one there is to whom these things,\r\n        That nobody else’s mind calls back,\r\n        Have a savour that scenes in being lack,\r\n        And a presence more than the actual brings;\r\n        To whom to-day is beneaped and stale,\r\n              And its urgent clack\r\n              But a vapid tale.\r\n                                             _Places_\r\n\r\n=3. His Novels.= Mr. Hardy’s first novel, _Desperate Remedies_\r\n(1871), is, even as a first attempt, a little disappointing. _Under\r\nthe Greenwood Tree_ (1872) is an improvement, and in its sweet and\r\nfaithful rendering of country life suggests _Silas Marner_. Next\r\nappeared _A Pair of Blue Eyes_ (1873), much more powerful, in which\r\ncoincidences combine to produce a pitifully tragic conclusion. This\r\nis a fine specimen of the Hardy “pessimism.” By this time Mr. Hardy\r\nhad matured his style and developed his views, and the succeeding\r\nnovels display a masterly power that rarely deserts him: _Far from the\r\nMadding Crowd_ (1874), _The Hand of Ethelberta_ (1876), _The Return of\r\nthe Native_ (1878), _The Trumpet-Major_ (1879), _A Laodicean_ (1881),\r\n_Two on a Tower_ (1882), _The Mayor of Casterbridge_ (1885), and _The\r\nWoodlanders_ (1887). Then Mr. Hardy’s career as a novelist culminated\r\nin two novels which have already taken rank among the great books\r\nof the language: _Tess of the d’Urbervilles_ (1891) and _Jude the\r\nObscure_ (1894). The first is the story of a woman (“a pure woman,” the\r\nnovelist calls her), of a noble line long decayed, who, as the victim\r\nof a malign and persistent destiny, commits murder and perishes on\r\nthe scaffold; the second is the life-history of an obscure craftsman,\r\nfired by the noblest ideals, who struggles to attain to better things,\r\nbut dies broken and disappointed, like Job cursing the day he was\r\nborn: drab and somber tales, lit by rare gleams of delicious humor and\r\nsentiment, and lifted to the level of great art by boundless insight\r\nand pity. After this _The Well Beloved_ (1897) was of the nature of an\r\nanti-climax, and Mr. Hardy wrote no more novels.\r\n\r\n=4. Features of his Novels.= (_a_) _Their Literary Quality._ Of the\r\nnovelists of his time Mr. Hardy is the most assiduous in his attention\r\nto the practices of his great literary predecessors, such as Sophocles,\r\nShakespeare, and Shelley. This, perhaps, gives his novels rather a\r\nheavy touch, so that he will never find a facile popularity; but he is\r\nnever cheap and never tawdry, he builds broad and square, and his work\r\nwill surely endure.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Their English Quality._ Like Chaucer and Shakespeare, Mr.\r\nHardy, though he includes all humanity in his outlook, is profoundly\r\nand essentially English. His works embrace English folk and strike\r\ntheir roots deep into English soil. His most successful creations are\r\nthose of peasants bred in his own native shire, or in the adjacent\r\nshires. Hence he has given us a notable gallery of men and women who\r\nare true to their breed and satisfying in their actuality. The scene\r\nof the majority of his novels is a section of England that he calls\r\nWessex. This includes approximately all the south and west of England\r\nsouth of a line joining Oxford and Bristol. Within this boundary he\r\nmoves with ease and precision, and there he finds adequate literary\r\nsustenance. From a man of the caliber of Mr. Hardy such parochialism\r\nhardly requires an apology, but if it does he has given it fully. We\r\nquote a passage in which he defends his practice, and which in addition\r\nprovides a good specimen of his expository prose:\r\n\r\n   It has sometimes been conceived of novels that evolve their\r\n   action on a circumscribed scene--as do many (though not all) of\r\n   these--that they cannot be so inclusive in their exhibition of\r\n   human nature as novels wherein the scenes cover large extents\r\n   of country, in which events figure amid towns and cities,\r\n   even wander over the four quarters of the globe. I am not\r\n   concerned to argue this point further than to suggest that\r\n   the conception is an untrue one in respect of the elementary\r\n   passions. But I would state that the geographical limits of the\r\n   stage here trodden were not absolutely forced upon the writer\r\n   by circumstances; he forced them upon himself from judgment.\r\n   I considered that our magnificent heritage from the Greeks in\r\n   dramatic literature found sufficient room for a large proportion\r\n   of its action in an extent of their country not much larger\r\n   than the half-dozen counties here reunited under the old name\r\n   of Wessex, that the domestic emotions have throbbed in Wessex\r\n   nooks with as much intensity as in the palaces of Europe, and\r\n   that, anyhow, there was quite enough human nature in Wessex for\r\n   one man’s literary purpose. So far was I possessed by this idea\r\n   that I kept within the frontiers when it would have been easier\r\n   to overleap them and give more cosmopolitan features to the\r\n   narrative.\r\n                             _General Preface to the Wessex Edition_\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Their Pessimism._ It cannot be denied that the novels are\r\nsomewhat oppressive in the gloom of their atmosphere. As a novelist\r\nMr. Hardy seems to conceive mankind as overlooked by a deliberately\r\nfreakish and malignant Fate. His characters are consistently\r\nunfortunate when they deserve it least. In places, as in the case of\r\nTess, he appears to bear down the scales, throwing against them the\r\nweight of repeated unhappy coincidences. Such a dismal method would\r\nin the end be repulsive to the reader’s sense of pity and justice if\r\nMr. Hardy did not add to it a certain largeness and detachment of view\r\nand a somber but sympathetic clarity of vision that make the reader’s\r\nobjections seem paltry and spiritless.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Their Humor and Pathos._ In many places, as in the rustic\r\nscenes of _The Mayor of Casterbridge_, the novels have a delicacy and\r\nacuteness of humor that strongly resembles that of George Eliot. At\r\nother times the humor is hard and heavy, as it is in his satires; at\r\nothers, again, it has an odd grotesqueness. A short poetical extract\r\nwill illustrate the last type:\r\n\r\n    That night your great guns, unawares,\r\n    Shook all our coffins as we lay,\r\n    And broke the chancel window-squares.\r\n    We thought it was the Judgment-day\r\n    And sat upright. While drearisome\r\n    Arose the howl of wakened hounds:\r\n    The mouse let fall the altar-crumb,\r\n    The worms drew back into the mounds.\r\n                               _Channel Firing_\r\n\r\nHis pathos is deep, sure, and strong, never degenerating into\r\nmawkishness or sentimentality. The conclusion of _Tess of the\r\nd’Urbervilles_ is a pattern of the dignified expression of sorrow:\r\n\r\n   Upon the cornice of the tower a tall staff was fixed. Their eyes\r\n   were riveted on it. A few minutes after the hour had struck\r\n   something moved slowly up the staff, and extended itself upon\r\n   the breeze. It was a black flag.\r\n\r\n   “Justice” was done, and the President of the Immortals,\r\n   in Æschylean phrase, had ended his sport with Tess. And\r\n   the d’Urberville knights and dames slept on in their tombs\r\n   unknowing. The two speechless gazers bent themselves down to\r\n   the earth, as if in prayer, and remained thus a long time,\r\n   absolutely motionless: the flag continued to wave silently. As\r\n   soon as they had strength they arose, joined hands again, and\r\n   went on.\r\n\r\n(_e_) _His Style._ Like many other great novelists, Mr. Hardy has no\r\noutstanding tricks of style. The general impression given is one of\r\nimmense strength and dignity. His vocabulary is copious, but handled\r\nwith scholarly care and accuracy. He is apt in phrase and pithy in\r\nexpression, and in moments of emotion his prose moves with a strong\r\nrhythmic beauty. In his poetry the style may sometimes be crabbed and\r\nunorthodox, but only to suit a definite satiric purpose. We may sum up\r\nby saying that in his style, as in all the other constituents of his\r\nwriting, he is always the sane and catholic artist.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSEPH CONRAD (1857–1924)\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= “Joseph Conrad” is the pen-name of =Teodor Jozef\r\nKonrad Korzeniowski=, who was born in the south of Poland in 1857.\r\nHis father was implicated in the Nationalist plots of the Poles, and\r\nthe son shared some of his father’s wanderings and exile. For a time\r\nthe boy was educated at Cracow, but very soon an obstinate love of\r\nthe sea manifested itself; and in 1874, in spite of all obstacles,\r\nhe shipped as a seaman at Marseilles. His earliest seafaring was\r\ndone in the Mediterranean. In 1878 he satisfied a lifelong desire by\r\nvisiting England and making his first practical acquaintance with the\r\nEnglish language. He had long wished to sail under the English flag,\r\nand for the remainder of his career he continued to do so. Till 1894\r\nhe led the life of a deep-sea sailor, rising from the position of an\r\nordinary seaman to that of a master-mariner in the Mercantile Marine.\r\nBad health, partly occasioned by a voyage up the Congo, stopped his\r\nseafaring; and then his first novel was accepted by a London publisher.\r\nHenceforth he was able to devote himself to writing novels, for his\r\nbooks, after a moderate beginning, have brought him a rapidly widening\r\ncircle of readers.\r\n\r\n=2. His Novels.= Mr. Conrad’s first novel, _Almayer’s Folly_, was begun\r\nabout 1889 and not finished till 1894, when it was published. In some\r\nrespects the novel is immature, for it is halting in plot, and there\r\nis a tendency to fumble in the handling of some of the characters; but\r\nthe power and originality of the work are unquestionable. The scene\r\nis that of an Eastern river, fatally beautiful, haunted with disease,\r\ndeath, and the destinies of mysterious men. The principal characters\r\nare wild and diabolical, of strange race and stranger desires. Over the\r\nwhole of the book hangs the glamour of a style quite new to English\r\nprose: rich and exotic as a tropical blossom, subtly pervasive and\r\npowerful, languorous and debilitating, but most fascinating. The\r\nbook is typical of the remainder of Mr. Conrad’s novels; he was to\r\nimprove upon it; but only in degree, not in substance. We have space\r\nto mention only the more important of his later works: _An Outcast of\r\nthe Islands_ (1896), a kind of sequel to the first book; _The Nigger\r\nof the Narcissus_ (1898), a brighter tale, full of the glory of the\r\ndeep seas; _Lord Jim_ (1900), an astonishing story, detailed with\r\nmicroscopic care, of a broken sailor who “makes good”; _Youth_ (1902),\r\nperhaps Mr. Conrad’s masterpiece--briefer, more direct, and instinct\r\nwith the beauty of romantic youth; _Nostromo_ (1903), a tale of South\r\nAmerican politics and treasure-hunting; _The Secret Agent_ (1907), in\r\nwhich the novelist leaves his favorite Eastern scenes for the grimmer\r\npurlieus of London; _’Twixt Land and Sea_ (1912), three short stories,\r\ncontaining some of his best work; _Chance_ (1914); _Within the Tides_\r\n(1915); _Victory_ (1915); _The Shadow Line_ (1917); _The Arrow of Gold_\r\n(1919), in which the interest shifts to Spain and the Carlist plotters;\r\nand _The Rescue_ (1920). In addition there are several other volumes\r\nof short stories; two volumes of memories and impressions, extremely\r\nvaluable as specimens of the Conrad manner, called _The Mirror of the\r\nSea_ (1906) and _Some Reminiscences_ (1912); and two volumes written\r\nin collaboration with Ford Madox Hueffer, _The Inheritors_ (1901) and\r\n_Romance_ (1903).\r\n\r\n=3. Features of his Novels.= (_a_) _Their Exotic Quality._ Just as Mr.\r\nHardy is probably the most English of the greater novelists, so Mr.\r\nConrad is, in no disparaging sense of the term, the most un-English.\r\nNo other novelist can so well convey the charm and repulsiveness of\r\nalien regions. The impression is borne upon the reader through every\r\nconstituent of the novels. The setting, in the best examples, is among\r\ntropical islands, or upon the deep seas. The characters are men and\r\nwomen thoroughly in tune with the scene: nautical people, generally\r\nof mixed or alien breed--Danish, Malay, or Italian. Even when Mr.\r\nConrad introduces English scenes and people in some fashion they always\r\nsucceed in conveying the impression of being un-English.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The _style_ of the books, moreover, adds to the prevailing\r\nfeeling. It is haunting and beautiful, sumptuous in detail, delicate in\r\nrhythm, but curiously and decidedly exotic.\r\n\r\nA brief extract cannot do justice to the style of Mr. Conrad, but we\r\nshall quote two passages in illustration. The first shows his prose in\r\nits less happy mood: somewhat mechanical and cumbrous in its imagery,\r\nand forced and overloaded with epithet. The second is much better.\r\nHere every word is necessary and appropriate, the rhythm is free, and\r\nthe music sweet and persuasive.\r\n\r\n   (1) Shaw tried to speak. He swallowed great mouthfuls of tepid\r\n   water which the wind drove down his throat. The brig seemed\r\n   to sail through undulating waves that passed swishing between\r\n   the masts and swept over the decks with the fierce rush and\r\n   noise of a cataract. From every spar and every rope a ragged\r\n   sheet of water streamed flicking to leeward. The overpowering\r\n   deluge seemed to last for an age; became unbearable--and, all\r\n   at once, stopped. In a couple of minutes the shower had run its\r\n   length over the brig and now could be seen like a straight grey\r\n   wall, going away into the night under the fierce whispering\r\n   of dissolving clouds. The wind eased. To the northward, low\r\n   down in the darkness, three stars appeared in a row, leaping\r\n   in and out between the crests of the waves like the distant\r\n   heads of swimmers in a running surf; and the retreating edge of\r\n   the cloud, perfectly straight from east to west, slipped along\r\n   the dome of the sky like an immense hemispheric iron shutter\r\n   pivoting down smoothly as if operated by some mighty engine. An\r\n   inspiring and penetrating freshness flowed together with the\r\n   shimmer of light through the augmented glory of the heaven, a\r\n   glory exalted, undimmed, and strangely startling as if a new\r\n   universe had been created during the short flight of the stormy\r\n   cloud. It was a return to life, a return to space; the earth\r\n   coming out from under a pall to take its place in the renewed\r\n   and immense scintillation of the universe.\r\n\r\n   The brig, her yards slightly checked in, ran with an easy motion\r\n   under the topsails, jib, and driver, pushing contemptuously\r\n   aside the turbulent crowd of noisy and agitated waves. As the\r\n   craft went swiftly ahead she unrolled behind her over the uneasy\r\n   darkness of the sea a broad ribbon of seething foam shot with\r\n   wispy gleams of dark discs escaping from under the rudder.\r\n   Far away astern, at the end of a line no thicker than a black\r\n   thread, which dipped now and then in its long curve in the\r\n   bursting froth, a toy-like object could be made out, elongated\r\n   and dark, racing after the brig over the snowy whiteness of her\r\n   wake.\r\n                                                     _The Rescue_\r\n\r\n\r\n   (2) The _Narcissus_, left alone, heading south, seemed to stand\r\n   resplendent and still upon the restless sea, under the moving\r\n   sun. Flakes of foam swept past her sides; the water struck her\r\n   with flashing blows; the land glided away, slowly fading; a few\r\n   birds screamed on motionless wings over the swaying mastheads.\r\n   But soon the land disappeared, the birds went away; and to the\r\n   west the pointed sail of an Arab dhow running for Bombay rose\r\n   triangular and upright above the sharp edge of the horizon,\r\n   lingered, and vanished like an illusion. Then the ship’s wake,\r\n   long and straight, stretched itself out through a day of immense\r\n   solitude. The setting sun, burning on the level of the water,\r\n   flamed crimson below the blackness of heavy rainclouds. The\r\n   sunset squall, coming up from behind, dissolved itself into the\r\n   short deluge of a hissing shower. It left the ship glistening\r\n   from trucks to water-line, and with darkened sails. She ran\r\n   easily before a fair monsoon, with her decks cleared for the\r\n   night; and, moving along with her, was heard the sustained and\r\n   monotonous swishing of the waves, mingled with the low whispers\r\n   of men mustered aft for the setting of watches; the short plaint\r\n   of some block aloft; or, now and then, a loud sigh of wind.\r\n                                     _The Nigger of the Narcissus_\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Their Graphic Power._ The strongest appeal of Mr. Conrad’s\r\nnovels is to the eye and the ear. His pictures of seafaring life and of\r\nlife connected with the sea have never been surpassed. Their veracity\r\nand beauty are due to his personal acquaintance with the subject; to\r\na scrupulous and artistic selection of detail, often of the technical\r\nkind that the sailor loves; and, once more, to the charm of the\r\nexpression. In addition, his faculty of graphic description is often\r\nrevealed in the deft manner in which he can outline some personality\r\nthat flits across the pages of a story:\r\n\r\n   He held up his head in the glare of the lamp--a head vigorously\r\n   modelled into deep shadows and shining lights--a head powerful\r\n   and misshapen with a tormented and flattened face--a face\r\n   pathetic and brutal: the tragic, the mysterious, the repulsive\r\n   mask of the nigger’s soul.\r\n                                     _The Nigger of the Narcissus_\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Their Narrative Method._ Mr. Conrad has evolved a narrative\r\nmethod of his own, which, while it is usually successful in his\r\nown hands, would probably be disastrous in hands less careful and\r\nadroit. The method is, first, indirect. The author’s favorite device\r\nis to create some character (a Captain Marlow often appears for this\r\npurpose) who relates the story, or part of the story, in his own\r\nwords. Often another story crops up in the original story, adding\r\ncomplications, with, as can be seen in _Lord Jim_, results that are\r\na little bewildering. Secondly, the greatest attention is given to\r\ndetails. The motives and impressions of the characters are discussed\r\nand analyzed, and their trivial actions faithfully recorded. Moreover,\r\nMr. Conrad delights in leading his characters into morasses of doubt\r\nand hesitation. He may be called the novelist of doubt and hesitation,\r\nso skilled is he in the elaborate suggestion of such emotions.\r\nConsequently many a Conrad story, like one of his ships, is becalmed\r\nin its career, and stirs uneasily without making much progress. Hence\r\nhe who runs must not read Conrad. This author demands a reader who is\r\npatient and wary, and who follows the course of the narrative very\r\ncarefully, for he has a troublesome habit of inserting important matter\r\nin the midst of less essential details. If the reader will but observe\r\nthese cautions, he will be led, deviously perhaps, but none the less\r\ncertainly, into many regions of delightful romance.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERBERT GEORGE WELLS\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= Mr. Wells was born in Kent in the year 1866. His\r\nearly education was private, and later he studied at London University.\r\nHere he finally graduated in science, zoology and kindred subjects\r\nbeing his special choice. But he had his living to earn while he\r\ncarried on his studies, and the experiences of these early years are\r\nreflected in his novels. Teaching, lecturing, and journalistic work\r\nfollowed; but literature was not long in exercising its fascination,\r\nand an early measure of success was soon his portion. Henceforth he\r\ndevoted himself to the writing of books, which command a wide public\r\nboth in England and America.\r\n\r\n=2. His Works.= For the literary historian the books of Mr. Wells\r\nprovide an interesting study, as, in the course of their production,\r\nthey register a clear development of manner. The books themselves are\r\nso numerous that here we can mention only the more important among them.\r\n\r\nAs was only to be expected, Mr. Wells began by utilizing his scientific\r\ntraining as an adjunct to his story-telling. His first efforts in\r\nfiction were a series of scientific romances, extremely ingenious in\r\ntheir mingling of fact and fiction, rapidly and felicitously narrated,\r\nand casting shrewd side-glances at many social problems. The best of\r\nthis class were _The Time Machine_ (1895), _The Invisible Man_ (1897),\r\nand _The Food of the Gods_ (1904). The second stage of the novelist’s\r\ncareer (slightly overlapping the first stage) was represented by a\r\nseries of genuine novels, which reveal considerable talent in the\r\nmanipulating of plot, a faculty, amounting to positive genius, for\r\ndepicting ordinary people with zest, accuracy, and humor, and a clear\r\nand flexible style admirably in keeping with his subject. _Love and\r\nMr. Lewisham_ (1900), _Kipps_ (1905), and _The History of Mr. Polly_\r\n(1910) were representative of this group. In the third stage problems\r\nof modern society, social, religious, political, and commercial, which\r\nhad all along strongly attracted the attention of Mr. Wells, elbowed\r\nthemselves into the midst of the fictitious material, claiming an\r\nequal place. Of such a nature were _Tono-Bungay_ (1909), which is\r\nalmost an epical treatment of modern commercialism, _Ann Veronica_\r\n(1909), concerning a modern love-affair, and _The New Machiavelli_\r\n(1911), on contemporary politics. In the fourth stage the discursive\r\nand dogmatic elements take the principal place, subordinating the\r\nfictitious portions, as can be seen in _Boon_ (1915), an extraordinary\r\nbook, crammed with excellent lively literary criticism, but chaotic,\r\nsplenetic, and irresponsible; _Mr. Britling Sees It Through_ (1916), a\r\nbook treating of the Great War, with an able beginning, but a hazy and\r\nunsatisfactory conclusion; and _Joan and Peter_ (1918), also dealing\r\npartly with the War, but much concerned with educational matters.\r\nA collection of short stories, _The Country of the Blind_ (1911),\r\ncontains, along with much that is scamped and trashy, some first-rate\r\nwork, notably in the tale that gives the title to the book.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his numerous works of fiction Mr. Wells has written\r\nbooks that are almost entirely pamphlets, expressing his ideas on\r\nsocial and other problems; _The Island of Doctor Moreau_ (1896), _A\r\nModern Utopia_ (1905), and _New Worlds for Old_ (1908) are only a\r\nfew out of many. He has also, with much hardihood and considerable\r\nsuccess, given the world _The Outline of History_ (1920), a work\r\nthat antagonized the pedants and charmed and instructed the ordinary\r\nintelligent man.\r\n\r\n=3. Features of his Novels.= (_a_) _Their “Modern” Quality._ Possessed\r\nof an eager and inquiring mind, of great energy, and of a wide public\r\nready to give ear to his opinions, Mr. Wells has come more and more\r\nto use the novel as a means of voicing his hopes, his criticisms, and\r\nhis fears. Such a course must in the end bring about the decay of his\r\nnovels as works of art. It is possible, indeed, that his later works\r\nwill rapidly fall into oblivion, as did the later novels of George\r\nEliot, who pursued a course in some respects similar to that of Mr.\r\nWells. No one, however, can question the force and vivacity of his\r\nexpressed opinions, and the eager reception that awaits them in many\r\nquarters. To many of his time he is the sage and prophet, as Carlyle,\r\nin his own fashion, was to the Victorian age; and as the need for\r\nCarlyle passed away with the problems that he handled, so, perhaps,\r\nwill the need for the pen of Mr. Wells. It is possible that _Kipps_\r\nwill be widely read when such works as _The Soul of a Bishop_ have been\r\nentirely forgotten.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Their Literary Quality._ In addition to his intellectual gifts,\r\nMr. Wells possesses an imagination of great power and grasp. This\r\nappears all through his works, being perhaps most prominent in the\r\nearlier romances, such as _The First Men in the Moon_, and in the\r\nearlier novels. In the novels the strength of Mr. Wells’s imagination\r\nbecomes a positive drawback when it leads to overproduction, which in\r\nits turn brings a certain mechanical quality in the plot and in the\r\ncentral characters. His descriptions, however, alike of homely English\r\nscenes and of the most fantastic and barbarous regions, are brilliantly\r\ndashing and real. Like Dickens, he excels in the creation of ordinary\r\nfolks, of the type of tradesmen and clerks, upon whom he expends a\r\nwealth of observation and humorous comment.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Their Humor._ Freshness and abundance are the outstanding\r\nqualities of Mr. Wells’s humor. Sometimes he is almost juvenile in\r\nhis high spirits. In its more sober moments the humor is the urbane\r\nacceptance of men’s little weaknesses, somewhat patronizing perhaps,\r\nbut sharply scrutinizing and faithfully recording. In other moods it is\r\nsatirical, and then it is swift and destructive. In its more reckless\r\nphase it passes into jeering and irreverent laughter. The humor of Mr.\r\nWells is a powerful weapon, and he is somewhat careless in his handling\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _His Style._ The clearness and rapidity of Mr. Wells’s style has\r\nundoubtedly led to a lack of taste and balance and (in the mind of the\r\nreader) to a sense of improvisation. In its more careless passages\r\nit conveys the impression of a brilliant but shallow loquacity. The\r\nstyle, nevertheless, has some great and positive virtues: an instant\r\ncommand of epithet, a vivid pictorial quality, and sometimes a rich\r\nsuggestiveness of romance. As an example of this last quality, the\r\nlove-passages in _The Country of the Blind_ are idyllically beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe two brief extracts that follow illustrate two different aspects\r\nof his style. The first is a picture of a tropical scene, the style\r\nresembling in some respects that of Mr. Conrad. It lacks the intimate\r\ndetail of Mr. Conrad’s descriptions, but it is much less labored. The\r\nsecond is an example of the pictorial narrative power that is Mr.\r\nWells’s chief claim to literary greatness:\r\n\r\n   (1) Here and there strange blossoms woke the dank intensities\r\n   of green with a trumpet-call of colour. Things crept among the\r\n   jungle and peeped and dashed back rustling into stillness.\r\n   Always in the sluggishly drifting, opaque water were eddyings\r\n   and stirrings; little rushes of bubbles came chuckling up\r\n   lightheartedly from this or that submerged conflict and\r\n   tragedy; now and again were crocodiles like a stranded fleet of\r\n   logs basking in the sun. Still it was by day, a dreary stillness\r\n   broken only by insect sounds and the creaking and flapping of\r\n   our progress, by the calling of the soundings and the captain’s\r\n   confused shouts; but in the night as we lay moored to a clump\r\n   of trees the darkness brought a thousand swampy things to life,\r\n   and out of the forest came screamings and howlings, screamings\r\n   and yells that made us glad to be afloat. And once we saw\r\n   between the tree stems long blazing fires. We passed two or\r\n   three villages landward, and brown-black women and children came\r\n   and stared at us and gesticulated, and once a man came out in a\r\n   boat from a creek and hailed us in an unknown tongue; and so at\r\n   last we came to a great open place, a broad lake rimmed with a\r\n   desolation of mud and bleached refuse and dead trees, free from\r\n   crocodiles or water birds or sight or sound of any living thing,\r\n   and saw far off, even as Nasmyth had described, the ruins of\r\n   the deserted station and hard by two little heaps of buff-hued\r\n   rubbish under a great rib of rock. The forest receded. The land\r\n   to the right of us fell away and became barren, and far off\r\n   across a notch in its backbone was surf and the sea.\r\n                                                   _Tono-Bungay_\r\n\r\n\r\n   (2) There was a fumbling at the latch of the front door.\r\n\r\n   “’Ere’s my lord,” said Mrs Coombes. “Went out like a lion and\r\n   comes back like a lamb, I’ll lay.”\r\n\r\n   Something fell over in the shop: a chair, it sounded like.\r\n   Then there was a sound as of some complicated step exercise in\r\n   the passage. Then the door opened and Coombes appeared. But\r\n   it was Coombes transfigured. The immaculate collar had been\r\n   torn carelessly from his throat. His carefully brushed silk\r\n   hat, half-full of a crush of fungi, was under one arm; his\r\n   coat was inside out, and his waistcoat adorned with bunches of\r\n   yellow-blossomed furze. These little eccentricities of Sunday\r\n   costume, however, were quite overshadowed by the change in his\r\n   face; it was livid white, his eyes were unnaturally large and\r\n   bright, and his pale blue lips were drawn back in a cheerless\r\n   grin. “Merry!” he said. He had stopped dancing to open the door.\r\n   “Rational ’njoyment. Dance.” He made three fantastic steps into\r\n   the room and stood bowing.\r\n\r\n   “Jim!” shrieked Mrs Coombes, and Mr Clarence sat petrified, with\r\n   a drooping lower jaw.\r\n\r\n   “Tea,” said Mr Coombes. “Jol’ thing, tea. Tose-stools, too.\r\n   Brosher.”\r\n\r\n   “He’s drunk,” said Jennie in a weak voice. Never before had she\r\n   seen this intense pallor in a drunken man, or such shining,\r\n   dilated eyes.\r\n                                               _The Purple Pileus_\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER NOVELISTS\r\n\r\n=1. George Gissing (1857–1903)= was born at Wakefield, and concluded\r\nhis education at Owens College, Manchester. He took to literature, but\r\nwith little success, and for years lived in dire poverty. In time his\r\nbooks met with a somewhat wider acceptance, though they were never\r\npopular; and his scholarship and the high quality of his literary\r\ncriticism always commanded respect. He died in the Pyrenees, whither\r\nfailing health had compelled him to go.\r\n\r\nHis novels are almost entirely devoted to the lives of the poorer\r\nclasses: _Workers of the Dawn_ (1880), _The Unclassed_ (1884), _Demos_\r\n(1889), _Grub Street_ (1891), and _The Odd Women_ (1893) are only a\r\nselection from his books. His _Private Papers of Henry Ryecroft_ (1903)\r\nis partly autobiographical, and is an excellent example of his style.\r\nHe handles his subjects with a depressing fidelity that will always\r\nrestrict his novels to a narrow circle of readers. He lacks Mr. Hardy’s\r\nElizabethan largeness of vision, and will not rank as a really great\r\nwriter, but he deserves honorable mention as a novelist who in poverty\r\nand distress would not bow the knee to false gods, who steadily kept in\r\nview the highest ideals, and who died true to his literary faith.\r\n\r\n=2. George Moore=, born in Mayo in the year 1857, is the son of\r\na landowner in that county. He was educated at Oscott, and then for\r\nsome years studied art in Paris. During those years he imbibed that\r\npassion for French art and French fiction that was never to leave him.\r\nAs an artist he had no success; but as a novelist, after a moderate\r\nbeginning, he has won the admiration of an important section of the\r\nreading public. He is a man of varied but unstable enthusiasms, which\r\nare reflected in his novels. In the course of time he was caught up in\r\nthe Celtic Revival, which he valiantly served with his pen, though he\r\nwas not backward in candid criticism of it.\r\n\r\nMr. Moore began authorship with two volumes of verse, the first of\r\nwhich was _Flowers of Passion_ (1878). Neither of them was of any\r\ngreat merit. He started his career as a novelist as disciple of the\r\ngreat French realist Zola, publishing in this manner _A Mummer’s Wife_\r\n(1884). This novel, a squalid tale unrelieved by any bright touches,\r\nfollowed the example of Zola with much audacity, and shocked the more\r\nstaid opinion in England. Other stories of the same kind followed, the\r\nmore noteworthy being _A Drama in Muslin_ (1886) and _The Confessions\r\nof a Young Man_ (1888). His more mature works, though they never lacked\r\nfrankness, were rather more restrained in manner; characteristic\r\nspecimens were _Esther Waters_ (1894) and _Sister Teresa_ (1901).\r\nSubsequently he wrote some attractive books of reminiscence, of which\r\nthe best is _Hail and Farewell_, published in three volumes between the\r\nyears 1911 and 1914.\r\n\r\nIn his later books Mr. Moore’s style is delightfully sweet and clear.\r\nThe earlier books, in which he followed his model with a devoted\r\nfidelity, are devoid of the ornaments of style. In humor he is often\r\nwhimsical and charming, though his wit seldom lacks the sharp touch of\r\nsatire.\r\n\r\n=3. Rudyard Kipling= was born (1865) at Bombay, where his father was an\r\nofficial. He was educated in Devonshire, and wished to join the Army,\r\na project that had to be abandoned. Returning to India, he joined the\r\neditorial staff of the Lahore _Civil and Military Gazette_ and of _The\r\nPioneer_. For these journals he began writing short stories, which very\r\nsoon attracted an attention that became worldwide. After some years’\r\nresidence in the United States, Mr. Kipling settled in England. For a\r\ntime his popularity was immense, and received international recognition\r\nin the award of the Nobel Prize for literature (1907). Passing years\r\nhave dimmed his brightness, and recently his voice has fallen nearly\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\nMr. Kipling first became known as a writer of short stories, and it is\r\nupon the short story that his fame will probably rest. As the writer\r\nof such a type of fiction he is very well equipped: he has a genius\r\nfor terse narrative, a swift eye for dramatic incident and detail, a\r\ncapacity for touching off men’s characters, and a style which, though\r\nit may be cocksure and jerky, is none the less attractive and intensely\r\nindividual. _Plain Tales from the Hills_ (1887) and _Soldiers Three_\r\n(1888) are among the most enjoyable of the volumes of short stories. In\r\nhis longer tales he is less at his ease. _The Light that Failed_ (1891)\r\nis not a great success; but _Kim_ (1901), a kind of picaresque Indian\r\ntale, is crammed with a rich abundance of observation and description.\r\nThe two _Jungle Books_ (1894 and 1895) are among the most delightful of\r\nbooks written for children.\r\n\r\nAs a poet of Army life and of British Imperialism Mr. Kipling was\r\nlong a notable figure. The climax came during the South African War\r\nof 1899–1902; after that the patriotic poem began to suffer eclipse.\r\nA good deal of Mr. Kipling’s poetry is brazen and commonplace, but it\r\nrarely lacks energy and picturesqueness. In such pieces as _Mandalay_,\r\nhowever, he touches the deeper springs of humanity, and becomes a real\r\npoet; and in _The Recessional_ (1897), a short poem that in essence\r\nexpresses the negation of all his usual teachings, he has attained to\r\npoetical greatness.\r\n\r\n=4. Arnold Bennett=, whose full name is Enoch Arnold Bennett, was born\r\nin North Staffordshire in 1867. He was educated at Newcastle, and\r\nstudied for the law, which he later forsook for journalism (1893). He\r\nwas on the staff of _Woman_ till 1900, when his books claimed all his\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nMr. Bennett’s most notable contribution to the novel is a group of\r\ninterrelated stories dealing with his native Staffordshire. These\r\nstories, very full in detail, are realistic presentations of the\r\nsqualid life of the pottery district; the personages introduced are\r\ncommonplace, and the style, though it does not lack vivacity and humor,\r\nis studiously subdued. _Anna of the Five Towns_ (1902), _The Old Wives’\r\nTale_ (1908), _Clayhanger_ (1910), _Hilda Lessways_ (1911), and _These\r\nTwain_ (1916) represent this group. _The Card_ (1911) is lighter and\r\nmore humorous; and _The Pretty Lady_ (1918), rather unequal, contains\r\nsome telling reflections upon modern society.\r\n\r\nLike Mr. Hardy, Mr. Bennett has essayed to render with artistic\r\ncompleteness the life of one section of England; unlike Mr. Hardy,\r\nhowever, he tends to become swamped with detail, so that he fails to\r\ngive his works unity and singleness of purpose. In addition, his style\r\nhas a certain aridity and a lack of flavor and attraction. On the other\r\nhand, he writes with clearness and care, his humor is reticent but\r\nkeenly penetrating, and his character-drawing able and realistic.\r\n\r\n=5. Compton Mackenzie= may be taken as the latest type of novelist\r\nwho will claim our attention. Born at West Hartlepool in 1883, he was\r\nthe son of Mr. Edward Compton, the well-known actor. He was educated\r\nat St. Paul’s School and at Oxford, and then became associated with\r\nliterature and the stage. He served in the South African War, and in\r\nthe Great War he was with the Naval Division in the Dardanelles.\r\n\r\nAfter publishing _Poems_ (1907), Mr. Mackenzie produced _The Passionate\r\nElopement_ (1911), a novel of much promise, that was realized in\r\n_Carnival_ (1912), a story dealing partly with theatrical life, and\r\nrevealing much shrewd insight and satirical humor. Like Thackeray and\r\nMr. Bennett, Mr. Mackenzie developed the novel series, introducing the\r\nsame people into several successive stories. _Sinister Street_ (1914),\r\n_Guy and Pauline_ (1915), _Sylvia Scarlett_ (1918), and _Sylvia and\r\nMichael_ (1919), are more or less closely interrelated in theme. _Poor\r\nRelations_ (1919) revealed a rich and somewhat unexpected vein of light\r\ncomedy, which Mr. Mackenzie did not improve upon in _Rich Relatives_\r\n(1921). Much of Mr. Mackenzie’s work is of unnecessary length, and\r\nmuch of it, in comformity with the modern manner, is laboriously and\r\nsomewhat unpleasantly detailed in its revelation of personal and social\r\nrelations; but his writing is seldom lacking in competence; it has\r\nease, versatility, and a certain cool urbanity; and at its best it\r\nreaches a high level.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE BERNARD SHAW\r\n\r\n=1. His Life.= Mr. Shaw, born in Dublin in 1856, is the son of a\r\nretired civil servant. His early education was received in Dublin, and\r\nat the age of fifteen he was earning his living as a clerk. Coming to\r\nLondon (1876), he tried novel-writing as an alternative to clerking,\r\nbut with no success at all. He was one of the first members (1884) of\r\nthe Fabian Society, and took a vigorous part in its socialistic work.\r\nA witty and voluble speaker, not without moments of real eloquence, he\r\nwas much in demand as a lecturer. In 1885 he began his connection with\r\njournalism, and was successively on the staff of several London papers,\r\nwriting on music, painting, and the drama. In music he was a strong\r\nadvocate of Wagner. The dramatic works of the great Norwegian Ibsen\r\nwere for long his pet subject. During the years 1895–98 his dramatic\r\narticles in _The Saturday Review_ attracted much attention owing\r\nto the freshness of their opinions and the vitality of their style.\r\nAbout this time he started to write and produce plays of his own; and\r\nwith them he began his long verbal contest with the British public\r\nover their failure to appreciate the merit of his work. In the end,\r\nowing partly to his own voluble persistence, but chiefly to the virtues\r\ninherent in his dramas, he won the day; so that a new play by Mr. Shaw,\r\nif indeed it does not command a wide acceptance of its views, is at\r\nleast received as a powerful and stimulating addition to the dramatic\r\nliterature of our time.\r\n\r\n=2. His Novels.= Mr. Shaw began his career as an author by\r\nwriting four novels which were rejected by every publisher in London,\r\nand subsequently saw the light in obscure periodicals of socialistic\r\nsympathies. The best of the four are _The Irrational Knot_ (1880)\r\nand _Cashel Byron’s Profession_ (1882). He republished the books\r\nin 1901, calling them “Novels of my Nonage.” To readers acquainted with\r\nthe later writings of Mr. Shaw there are several familiar features\r\nplainly to be seen: the straight, clean thrust of the style, the\r\nbold and dramatic portraiture of the characters, and the irreverent\r\nmishandling of treasured institutions. There is even the note typical\r\nof the earliest plays--a curious frigidity and barrenness of emotion,\r\nas if the novelist had made a vow to cut sentiment clean out of his\r\nbooks. The crude socialism preached in the stories probably scared the\r\npublishers; for, though they by no means represent even the average of\r\nMr. Shaw’s work, they are always readable and often amusing.\r\n\r\n=3. His Plays.= As a playwright Mr. Shaw began as a disciple of\r\nIbsen. In his early attempts he succeeded in reproducing the cold and\r\nintellectual realism of the great Norwegian, but he quite failed to\r\ncatch the humane and intensely romantic idealism that lies deep within\r\nthe heart of the Ibsen plays. _Widowers’ Houses_ (1885), a didactic\r\nplay on the subject of slum-property, was a discouraging beginning to\r\nhis play-writing. It was hard and repulsive in sentiment; it lacked\r\nthe later Shavian high spirits and verbal acrobatics; and it appealed\r\nonly to a small circle of enthusiasts. _The Philanderer_ (1893) was\r\nmuch lighter and more attractive, though it did not lack harsher\r\ntouches, almost callous in their nonchalance; it showed, however,\r\nthe beginning of that mastery of the technique of the stage that was\r\nhenceforth to distinguish nearly all Mr. Shaw’s plays. _Mrs. Warren’s\r\nProfession_ (1893), grimmer and abler, was refused a license by the\r\ncensor of plays; and then with _Arms and the Man_ (1894) Mr. Shaw had\r\nhis first successful bout with the British public. In the play the\r\nsatiric intention was obvious, for the “glories” of war were freely\r\nridiculed; but the satire was so overlaid with a briskness of action,\r\nwith a rocketing interchange of witticisms, and with an almost reckless\r\ndisplay of high spirits that both the general public and the cautious\r\ncritics were taken by storm. From this point Mr. Shaw never looked\r\nback, and his plays appeared in a steady procession. We can mention\r\nonly the more important of them: _Candida_ (1894), an attempt at the\r\nromantic sentimental comedy, only too rare with Mr. Shaw; _You Never\r\nCan Tell_ (1896), purely and hilariously comic, and masterly from\r\nbeginning to end; _Cæsar and Cleopatra_ (1898), quaintly serio-comic,\r\nbut picturesque and brilliant; _Man and Superman_ (1903), containing\r\nmany of its author’s opinions expressed with startling audacity, but\r\ntoo long and voluble; _John Bull’s Other Island_ (1904), on the Irish\r\nquestion; _The Doctor’s Dilemma_ (1906), very censorious on the medical\r\nprofession; and _Androcles and the Lion_ (1912). At this point the\r\nWar intervened, and the effects of it on Mr. Shaw’s acutely sensitive\r\nmind, along with the pressure of increasing years, can be seen in the\r\nstyle of the later plays. One can detect a certain waning strength.\r\nThe energy and gayety are still visible, but they appear fitfully; the\r\nhigh scorn is apt to degenerate into querulousness; and there is a\r\nhardening of temper, for which the dramatist tries to atone by fits of\r\npuerile burlesque. _Heartbreak House_ (1917) is abrupt and even savage\r\nin places; and _Back to Methuselah_ (1920), in spite of its infinity of\r\nrange and the brilliance of disconnected passages, is heavy with the\r\nweight of mortality.\r\n\r\nWe have still to mention Mr. Shaw’s prefaces, which are remarkable\r\nfeatures of his plays. As the plays successively appeared, the prefaces\r\nincreased in length, till they began to rival in importance the\r\nplays themselves. Each of them is a tractate on some question that\r\nfor the time engrossed the attention of the playwright. For example,\r\nthe preface to _Cæsar and Cleopatra_ deals in Shavian fashion with\r\nShakespeare, that to _Androcles and the Lion_ with early Christianity,\r\nand that to _Back to Methuselah_ with what he calls Creative Evolution.\r\nThe prefaces are diffuse, paradoxical, and egotistical; but they are\r\nbrilliant and incisive, and they represent the best of Mr. Shaw’s\r\nnon-dramatic prose.\r\n\r\n=4. Features of his Plays.= (_a_) _Their Wit._ The distinction between\r\nwit and humor is commonly expressed by saying that humor appeals to\r\nthe emotions, whereas wit touches only the intellect: humor deals\r\nwith incidents and actions, wit with words and phrases. Mr. Shaw\r\nranks among the greatest wits in the language. He delights in the\r\nquick cut and thrust of verbal sword-play, in the clever distortion\r\nof a phrase, and in the brilliant paradoxical sally of the intellect.\r\nIt is this wittiness that has given him his commanding position in\r\nforeign countries. It is not that Mr. Shaw is inhumanly devoid of\r\nemotion and sympathy, but he is afraid of such emotions, and often\r\ndeliberately stifles them. In _Candida_ he attains to a high level of\r\ndelicate sentimentality, but in _How He lied to Her Husband_ he jeers\r\nat the admirers of his own handiwork. In his later plays he wearies a\r\nlittle over this exuberant play of wit. In _Back to Methuselah_, for\r\nexample, perhaps the most attractive feature is a mood of sere romantic\r\nmelancholy.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _His Contribution to the Drama._ Mr. Shaw’s long experience as a\r\ndramatic critic taught him at least what he was to avoid. When he began\r\nhis career as a dramatist the theater was given up to the production\r\nof frivolous and even immoral pieces. Mr. Shaw vitalized this stuffy\r\natmosphere, gave to play-writing a strong and vigorous tone, and\r\nadded to it a spirit of broad comedy. From the purely formal point of\r\nview, he employed all the devices of stagecraft to give his plays an\r\nattractive and realistic setting. As regards the literary side of his\r\nplays, he marks in his work a great increase in the importance given\r\nto the stage-directions. Like Ibsen, he elaborates this feature of his\r\nplays till on the printed page they are almost as important as the\r\ndialogue. He is reverting to the precepts of Aristotle, who maintained\r\nthat the drama is an affair of _action_, not of speech. Consequently\r\nMr. Shaw’s plays often read like an interesting hybrid between the\r\nnovel and the drama. We add an extract to illustrate this combination\r\nof speech and action:\r\n\r\n   _Behind the Emperor’s box at the Coliseum, where the\r\n   performers assemble before entering the arena. In the middle\r\n   a wide passage leading to the arena descends from the floor\r\n   level under the imperial box. On both sides of this passage\r\n   steps ascend to a landing at the back entrance to the box. The\r\n   landing forms a bridge across the passage. At the entrance to\r\n   the passage are two bronze mirrors, one on each side._\r\n\r\n   _On the west side of this passage, on the right hand of\r\n   anyone coming from the box and standing on the bridge, the\r\n   martyrs are sitting on the steps. Lavinia is seated half-way\r\n   up, thoughtfully trying to look death in the face. On her left\r\n   Androcles consoles himself by nursing a cat. Ferrovious stands\r\n   behind them, his eyes blazing, his figure stiff with intense\r\n   resolution. At the foot of the steps crouches Spintho, with his\r\n   head clutched in his hands, full of horror at the approach of\r\n   martyrdom._\r\n\r\n   _On the east side of the passage the gladiators are standing\r\n   and sitting at ease, waiting, like the Christians, for their\r\n   turn in the arena. One (Retiarius) is a nearly naked man with a\r\n   net and trident. Another (Secutor) is in armour with a sword.\r\n   He carries a helmet with a barred visor. The Editor of the\r\n   gladiators sits on a chair a little apart from them._\r\n\r\n   _The Call Boy enters from the passage._\r\n\r\n   _The Call Boy._ Number six. Retiarius _versus_ Secutor.\r\n\r\n   _The gladiator with the net picks it up. The gladiator with\r\n   the helmet puts it on; and the two go into the arena, the\r\n   net-thrower taking out a little brush and arranging his hair\r\n   as he goes, the other tightening his straps and shaking his\r\n   shoulders loose. Both look at themselves in the mirrors before\r\n   they enter the passage._\r\n\r\n_Lavinia._ Will they really kill one another?\r\n\r\n_Spintho._ Yes, if the people turn down their thumbs.\r\n\r\n_The Editor._ You know nothing about it. The people indeed! Do you\r\nsuppose we would kill a man worth perhaps fifty talents to please the\r\nriff-raff? I should like to catch any of my men at it.\r\n\r\n_Spintho._ I thought----\r\n\r\n_The Editor_ [_contemptuously_]. You thought! Who cares what\r\n_you_ think? _You’ll_ be killed all right enough.\r\n\r\n_Spintho_ [_groans and again hides his face_].!!!...\r\n\r\n_Lavinia._ Does the Emperor ever interfere?\r\n\r\n_The Editor._ Oh yes; he turns his thumb up fast enough if the\r\nvestal virgins want to have one of his pet fighting men killed.\r\n                                          _Androcles and the Lion_\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) _His Defects._ As a dramatist Mr. Shaw has many faults.\r\nWhen he is anxious to expound one of his opinions he subordinates the\r\ndramatic interest and permits his characters to become merely the\r\nmouthpieces of his views. Jack Tanner, the chief character in _Man\r\nand Superman_, is the stock example of such a personage. Nearly all\r\nhis characters, moreover, though they are galvanically active, hardly\r\nimpress the reader as being actually alive. Like Dickens, Mr. Shaw is\r\nskillful in the creation of freaks and oddities, but he is weak in the\r\npresentation of living and ordinary people.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _His Opinions._ Like Mr. Wells, Mr. Shaw holds decided\r\nviews on many subjects, from phonetics to the construction of the\r\nuniverse, and he is not backward in expressing them. More than once he\r\nhas declared that he would never have written a word if he had not some\r\nmessage to convey. He has, however, a curious method of exposition,\r\nwhich he has purposely developed in order to shock his opponents into\r\nattention: a jesting, paradoxical mishandling of the truth, often\r\nglaringly personal, and stated with almost brutal clearness. As a\r\nresult Mr. Shaw rarely finds himself taken seriously by the superficial\r\nreader, though the deep underlying seriousness of his opinions is\r\nnearly always perceptible to the attentive mind. It has often been\r\nurged that his opinions are purely destructive; and his efforts to\r\nprovide alternatives to the institutions he condemns are not always of\r\nthe happiest.\r\n\r\n(_e_) _His Style._ Like his great fellow-countryman Swift,\r\nMr. Shaw has a powerful and logical mind, with the same fierce satiric\r\npurpose and (it may be added) the same type of Irish nationalism. His\r\nprose is more amusing, less destructive, more diffuse, and less simple\r\nthan that of the great Dean. In his dramatic dialogue, however, Mr.\r\nShaw is pithy, direct, and absolutely clear. The example already given\r\nshows its character.\r\n\r\nWe add a brief specimen of his expository prose. It is the peroration\r\nto a long preface, and therefore somewhat more elevated in style\r\nthan the average. It contains a characteristic mock-serious personal\r\nreference which sheds light on Mr. Shaw’s own opinion of his work.\r\n\r\n   I now find myself inspired to make a second legend of Creative\r\n   Evolution without distractions and embellishments. My sands\r\n   are running out; the exuberance of 1901 has aged into the\r\n   garrulity of 1920; and the war has been a stern intimation that\r\n   the matter is not one to be trifled with. I abandon the legend\r\n   of Don Juan with its erotic associations, and go back to the\r\n   legend of the Garden of Eden. I exploit the eternal interest of\r\n   the philosopher’s stone which enables men to live for ever. I\r\n   am not, I hope, under more illusion than is humanly inevitable\r\n   as to the crudity of this my beginning of a Bible for Creative\r\n   Evolution. I am doing the best I can at my age. My powers are\r\n   waning; but so much the better for those who found me unbearably\r\n   brilliant when I was in my prime. It is my hope that a hundred\r\n   apter and more elegant parables by younger hands will soon leave\r\n   mine as far behind as the religious pictures of the fifteenth\r\n   century left behind the first attempts of the early Christians\r\n   at inconography. In that hope I withdraw and ring up the curtain.\r\n                              _Preface to “Back to Methuselah”_\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER DRAMATISTS\r\n\r\n=1. Oscar O. W. Wilde (1856–1900)= was the son of a famous Irish\r\nsurgeon, and was educated at Dublin and Oxford. At Oxford he\r\ndistinguished himself both as a scholar and as an eccentric. In the\r\nlatter capacity he posed as an “æsthete” in opposition to the common\r\ntype of “athlete,” wearing fantastic garments, and behaving with an\r\nextraordinary combination of folly, extravagance, and presumption.\r\nOn leaving the university he dabbled in literature in an amateurish\r\nfashion, writing poems, novels, and plays, and contributing to\r\nmagazines and reviews. His opinions--he held that “morality” does not\r\nexist in “art”--led to much heated discussion, and to many charges\r\nbeing made against his moral character. Wilde instituted proceedings\r\nfor libel, which in turn brought to light many unpleasant facts against\r\nhim, and in the end landed him in jail (1895). On regaining his liberty\r\n(1897) he lived a wandering life on the Continent, and died miserably\r\nin Paris.\r\n\r\nWilde’s early poems and novels, an example of which latter is _The\r\nPicture of Dorian Gray_ (1891), are sumptuous in detail, cynically\r\nphrased, and richly ornamented in style;[237] but over them all\r\nis a curious taint, a faint malodorous corruption, that repels\r\nthe healthy-minded reader. His plays, however, almost escape this\r\ninfection. In tone they are hard and cynical, and in the portrayal\r\nof character they are exceedingly weak, but they are brilliant with\r\nepigram and telling phrase, are ingeniously contrived, and have many\r\nclever situations. They are the cleverest society comedies since the\r\ndays of Wilde’s great fellow-country-man Sheridan. The best of them are\r\n_Lady Windermere’s Fan_ (1892) and _The Importance of Being Earnest_\r\n(1895).\r\n\r\n=2. John Galsworthy= (born in 1867) in drama takes the place occupied\r\nin the novel by Gissing. In sincerity, in his close scrutiny of the\r\nvexed problems of to-day, and in his deep sympathy for the poor and\r\nwretched Mr. Galsworthy much resembles the earlier novelist. As a\r\nplaywright, however, he is too deeply engrossed with his problems to do\r\ncomplete justice to his talents. He is too serious, his humor is wan\r\nand meager, and the severe detachment of his plays makes them rather\r\ncold and depressing. _The Silver Box_ (1906) deals with the inequality\r\nof “justice” as it is administered in the police courts; _Joy_ (1907),\r\n_Strife_ (1909), and _Justice_ (1910) discuss various social and\r\ndomestic problems; and _The Skin Game_ (1920) deals with the post-war\r\nprofiteer.\r\n\r\nMr. Galsworthy has written a considerable number of novels, which\r\nculminate in _The Forsyte Saga_ (1922). This immense work includes\r\nthree longish novels and two shorter tales, all of which had previously\r\nbeen published individually. In its breadth and power of comprehension,\r\nand in its keen and destructive vision into social and personal\r\nweaknesses, the book takes rank as one of the most noteworthy of the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\n=3. Sir James Barrie= was born in 1860 at Kirriemuir, a small town\r\nin Forfarshire. Educated at Dumfries and at Edinburgh University, he\r\nbecame a journalist, settling ultimately in London. His early sketches\r\nand novels, such as _Auld Licht Idylls_ (1888), _A Window in Thrums_\r\n(1889), and _Sentimental Tommy_ (1896), squared with the average\r\nEnglishman’s notions of Scotland, and were exceedingly successful.\r\nThe element of pathos was heavily drawn upon, and their quaint and\r\nattractive humor--a delicate compound of fancy, pathos, and whimsical\r\nsentiment--was something quite new of its kind.\r\n\r\nHis plays strongly resemble the novels. In them he displays a sweet\r\nethereal fancy that adds to the humor and pathos. _The Admirable\r\nCrichton_ (1903) is fresh and delightful; _Peter Pan_, a golden venture\r\ninto unashamed nonsense, is to the stage what _Alice in Wonderland_\r\nis to literature--a children’s classic; and _Quality Street_ (1901),\r\n_What Every Woman Knows_ (1908), _A Kiss for Cinderella_ (1916), _Dear\r\nBrutus_ (1917), and _Mary Rose_ (1920) have the sweetly sensitive\r\ntears-in-laughter that make the Barrie plays quite different from all\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n=4. John M. Synge (1871–1909)= deserves mention as being the most\r\nimportant playwright of the purely Celtic school. He was always in\r\ndelicate health, and his period of play-writing was very brief. During\r\nthe years of his literary output he lived in close association with\r\nIrish peasantry, especially that of the Aran Islands, where the Celtic\r\nspirit is least affected by modern movements.\r\n\r\n_The Shadow of the Glen_ (1903) and _Riders to the Sea_ (1904) are\r\nshort plays of one act; and with the longer plays called _The Well\r\nof the Saints_ (1905), _The Playboy of the Western World_ (1907),\r\n_The Tinker’s Wedding_ (1909), and _Deirdre of the Sorrows_ (1910),\r\nthey represent his published works. All portray the life of the Irish\r\npeasant; but it is the peasant as viewed from the outside by the\r\ncultured literary man. The observation is often keen, and the satiric\r\nintention apparent; but the peasant remains an idealized literary\r\nfigure, and his language is idealized language. As acting plays,\r\nmoreover, they are heavy and lifeless, for Synge was little skilled\r\nin stage technique. Their real importance lies in their style: a\r\nslow-moving, wonderful prose, rich in poetic embellishment and sonorous\r\nrhythms, and full of the typical Celtic mysticism. Consequently Synge’s\r\nplays will be read far more than they will be acted. A specimen of his\r\nstyle will be found on p. 568.\r\n\r\n\r\nWRITERS OF MISCELLANEOUS PROSE\r\n\r\n=1. Gilbert K. Chesterton= was born in London in the year 1874. He\r\nwas educated at St. Paul’s School, then studied art, but ultimately\r\nbecame a journalist. He wrote much literary and miscellaneous prose\r\nfor journals, and distinguished himself as a writer of much ingenuity,\r\ntopsy-turvy humor, and a robust, rampageous style. His books of verse,\r\nsuch as _Gray-beards at Play_ (1900), _The Wild Knight_ (1900), and\r\n_Wine, Water, and Song_ (1915), are quite excellent in their way:\r\nclever and vigorous, skillfully constructed, and genuinely funny. His\r\nnovels are fine-spun webs of ingenious nonsense, and include _The\r\nClub of Queer Trades_ (1905) and _The Man Who was Thursday_ (1908).\r\nHis literary and miscellaneous work, often apparently willful and\r\ninconsequent, is usually sane and substantial at bottom. His critical\r\nwork is well represented by his books on Dickens and Browning, and\r\nhis miscellaneous writing, gloriously Chestertonian, by _Tremendous\r\nTrifles_ (1909) and _A Shilling for my Thoughts_ (1916).\r\n\r\n=2. Hilaire Belloc=, the son of a Frenchman, was born in France in\r\n1870. He was educated in England, served two years with the French\r\nArtillery, and finished his education at Oxford University. Mr. Belloc\r\nhas contributed to most kinds of literature. His serious verses are\r\nnoteworthy for their ease and vigor, and his nonsense verses, such as\r\n_A Bad Child’s Book of Beasts_, are excellent fooling. As a humorist\r\nMr. Belloc specializes in a super-solemnity of manner while he is\r\nstating the most ridiculous problems. His humor, however, rarely lacks\r\nthe sharp stab of satire. His novels, like those of Disraeli, are a\r\nshrewd commentary upon our political life. They have an unwinkingly\r\nsolemn humor, biting scorn scarcely concealed, and a clear and incisive\r\nstyle. _Mr. Clutterbuck’s Election_ (1908) and _A Change in the\r\nCabinet_ (1909) come high in the thin ranks of the first-rate political\r\nnovel. His miscellaneous work is often clever, whimsically learned,\r\nand often distinguished by the same parade of grave nonsense. _On\r\nNothing_ (1908) sets him high among modern essayists. His two travel\r\nvolumes, _The Path to Rome_ (1902) and _The Pyrenees_ (1909), in spite\r\nof their somewhat labored mannerisms, deserve to become classical.\r\n\r\n=3. Lord Morley (1838–1923)= is the sole writer of serious\r\nmiscellaneous prose that we have space to mention. He was born at\r\nBlackburn, took his degree at Oxford, and became a journalist of a\r\nRadical and philosophical type. He was in turn editor of more than one\r\nimportant review, entered Parliament (1883), and was closely associated\r\nwith Mr. Gladstone during the struggles over the Irish Home Rule Bills.\r\nHe held high offices under the Liberal Government, was created Viscount\r\nMorley of Blackburn (1908), and on the outbreak of war in 1914 retired\r\nfrom public life.\r\n\r\nLord Morley wrote a great deal of literary, philosophical, and\r\nmiscellaneous work, distinguished by its scholarly care and accuracy,\r\nby a deep but placable seriousness, and by a strong and flexible style.\r\nHis monographs on _Voltaire_ (1872), _Burke_ (1879), and _Walpole_\r\n(1889) are models of what such brief works ought to be; his _Life of\r\nCromwell_ (1900) is a sane and scholarly treatment of a difficult\r\nsubject; and his monumental _Life of Gladstone_ (1903), though it lacks\r\nproportion in some respects, is a well-filled storehouse of historical\r\nfact, and, on this side of idolatry, a reverent tribute to a great man.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POETS\r\n\r\nIn the section that follows we have made a careful selection from the\r\npoets of the period. Many more names might have been included, of a\r\nvalue and interest little inferior to those given a place. In any case,\r\na selection such as this must be in the nature of an experiment, for\r\ntime alone will sift out the poems of permanent value.\r\n\r\n=1. Sir William Watson= was born in 1858, the son of a Yorkshire\r\nfarmer, and was educated privately. His life has been devoted\r\nto letters: a devotion that was recognized by Mr. Gladstone, who\r\ntransferred to him (1893) the Civil List pension that had been granted\r\nto Tennyson. He was knighted in 1917.\r\n\r\nHis fairly abundant poetry includes _The Prince’s Quest_ (1880),\r\nafter the manner of Tennyson; _Wordsworth’s Grave_ (1890), the\r\nstyle of which suggests the meditative poetry of Matthew Arnold;\r\n_Lacrymæ Musarum_ (1893), which contains a fine elegy on the death\r\nof Tennyson; _The Muse in Exile_ (1913); and _The Superhuman\r\nAntagonists_ (1919). Sir William Watson is at his best as an elegiac\r\npoet, when, though he is apt to become diffusely meditative, he writes\r\nwith sincerity and a scholarly enthusiasm. In the heroic vein, such as\r\nhe attempted in the last poem mentioned above, he is merely violent,\r\nwithout being impressive. His political poetry, such as _The Year of\r\nShame_ (1897), is strong rhetorical verse, palpably sincere, but of\r\nno high poetical merit.\r\n\r\n=2. Francis Thompson (1859–1907)= had a career suggestive of that\r\nof the poets of the eighteenth century. He was born in Lancashire, and\r\nwas dedicated to the profession of medicine. He abandoned medicine, and\r\nwent to London as a friendless literary adventurer. Then followed the\r\ntragically familiar tale of loneliness, poverty, opium, and disease.\r\nAfter a time (1893) his poems drew a little attention to himself, and\r\nhe was rescued just in time from the fate of Chatterton. His health,\r\nhowever, was never fully restored, and finally he died of consumption.\r\n\r\nIn style and temper Thompson is a strange blend of the poets of\r\npast epochs. He has the rapt religious enthusiasm and the soaring\r\nimagination of the Metaphysical poets, as can be clearly seen in his\r\ntruly magnificent _Hound of Heaven_; or again, as in _The\r\nDaisy_, he is the inspired babbler of the type of William Blake. In\r\none sense he wrote too much, when he marred his splendid lyrical energy\r\nwith too abundant detail; in another sense he wrote too little, for the\r\nfire that was within him was extinguished before it could burn clear.\r\nHe is not quite another Coleridge, hag-ridden with opium, but at least\r\nhe is a lyrical poet far above mediocrity.\r\n\r\n=3. John Masefield= (born 1874) has contributed much poetry to modern\r\nliterature. Quite a budget of long descriptive-narrative poems has come\r\nfrom him, including _The Widow in the Bye Street_ (1912), a grimly\r\nrealistic tale; _Dauber_ (1913), full of the splendor and terror of\r\nthe sea; and _Reynard the Fox_ (1920), a bustling tale of the foxhunt.\r\nThese long poems are well informed and masterfully narrated, with many\r\npurple passages of description, and in the grimmer incidents a strong\r\nfidelity to fact that does not stop short of strong language. Mr.\r\nMasefield’s shorter poems, though they do not include any great lyrics,\r\nare dignified, reticent, and tuneful. He is undoubtedly at his best\r\nwhen he writes of the sea, a subject that was never far from the hearts\r\nof his great poetical predecessors.\r\n\r\n=4. William H. Davies= was born at Newport, Monmouthshire, in 1870. In\r\nhis youth he emigrated to America, where he became a tramp, and then\r\nserved as a cattleman on a steamer. An accident in which he lost a\r\nfoot made him incapable of hard physical work, so for a living he sang\r\nin the streets and lived in common lodging-houses. His first volume\r\nof verse, _The Soul’s Destroyer_ (1906), rescued him from penury. His\r\n_Collected Poems_ (1916) and _Forty New Pieces_ (1918) contain his best\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nLike Burns, Mr. Davies is the natural, untaught lyrical genius. His\r\ncapacity is neither so deep nor so intense as that of Burns, but\r\nwithin his limits he can write poems of great beauty. When he writes\r\nof nature he almost recreates the spirit of Wordsworth, he shows such\r\ninsight, freshness, and ease. His artless simplicity is at times almost\r\ngrotesque, yet the reader cannot help admitting that it is in keeping\r\nwith his subject. This marked naïveté, however, is often given a queer\r\nmetaphysical twist; or it sometimes rises, with a mighty rhythm,\r\ninto passages of noble harmony. At least half a dozen of his shorter\r\npieces--the expressive _Thunderstorms_; the exquisite _Moon_, so old in\r\ntheme and so original in expression; the dainty _Sweet Stay-at-Home_,\r\nwith its haunting Caroline meter and phrasing; the absolutely perfect\r\n_The White Cascade_, eight lines long; the provokingly beautiful\r\n_Dreams of the Sea_, that one cries out upon as being too wonderful\r\nto be merely imitative of the grand Marlowe manner; and the amazing\r\nverses, Elizabethan to the core, beginning _When I Am Old_--are stamped\r\nwith immortality. The temptation to quote is irresistible:\r\n\r\n    (1) When I am old, and it is spring,\r\n          And joy leaps dancing, wild and free,\r\n        Clear out of every living thing,\r\n          While I command no ecstasy;\r\n        And to translate the songs of birds\r\n        Will be beyond my power in words:\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n        For when these little songs shall fail,\r\n          These happy notes that to the world\r\n        Are puny mole-hills, nothing more,\r\n          That unto me are Alps of gold--\r\n        That toad’s dark life must be my own,\r\n        Buried alive inside a stone.\r\n\r\n    (2) Thou knowest the way to tame the wildest life,\r\n          Thou knowest the way to bend the great and proud:\r\n        I think of that Armada whose puffed sails,\r\n          Greedy and large, came swallowing every cloud.\r\n\r\n        But I have seen the sea-boy young and drowned,\r\n          Lying on shore, and, by thy cruel hand,\r\n        A seaweed beard was on his tender chin,\r\n          His heaven-blue eyes were filled with common sand.\r\n\r\n        And yet, for all, I yearn for thee again,\r\n          To sail once more upon thy fickle flood:\r\n        I’ll hear thy waves wash under my death-bed,\r\n          Thy salt is lodged for ever in my blood.\r\n                                      _Dreams of the Sea_\r\n\r\n=5. John Drinkwater= (born 1882) was educated at Oxford High School,\r\nand for a time worked in insurance offices. He has done much to revive\r\nthe modern drama, helping to found the Birmingham Repertory Theatre.\r\nAs a poet he is representative of the work of his day: meditative\r\nrather than passionate, descriptive rather than narrative, and always\r\nclear, competent, and precise. He is one of the best of modern\r\nblank-verse writers. His shorter poems will be found in his _Poems of\r\n1908–1914_ (1914) and _Swords and Ploughshares_ (1915).\r\n\r\n=6. Rupert C. Brooke (1887–1915)= was educated at Rugby and Cambridge,\r\nand for a time traveled in America. In 1914 he enlisted in the Royal\r\nNaval Division, took part in the fighting at Antwerp, and died of fever\r\nwhile on active service in the Dardanelles.\r\n\r\nBrooke’s lamentably early death gave rise to a quite natural tendency\r\nto overpraise his poetry. The exaggerated estimates made at his death\r\nmust be revised, and real justice done to his name. As a poet he is\r\nnot consistently great, but he is always readable, often delightfully\r\nmannered and humorous (as in the poem called _Heaven_), and on at least\r\none occasion, in the splendid sonnet called _The Soldier_, touches\r\ngreatness. His sonnets are perhaps his best achievement. In this very\r\ndifficult species of composition he has the requisite technical skill\r\nand delicate ear for rhythm, and he can catch the unmistakable surge\r\nand swell that mark the successful sonnet.\r\n\r\nWe quote from his piece called _Heaven_. In felicity of phrasing and\r\naptness of humor it is of the best Metaphysical tradition.\r\n\r\n    But somewhere, beyond Space and Time,\r\n    Is wetter water, slimier slime!\r\n    And there (they trust) there swimmeth One\r\n    Who swam ere rivers were begun,\r\n    Immense, of fishy form and mind,\r\n    Squamous, omnipotent, and kind;\r\n    And under that Almighty Fin,\r\n    The littlest fish may enter in.\r\n    Oh! never fly conceals a hook,\r\n    Fish say, in the Eternal Brook,\r\n    But more than mundane weeds are there,\r\n    And mud, celestially fair;\r\n    Fat caterpillars drift around,\r\n    And Paradisal grubs are found;\r\n    Unfading moths, immortal flies,\r\n    And the worm that never dies.\r\n    And in that Heaven of all their wish,\r\n    There shall be no more land, say fish.\r\n\r\n=7. William B. Yeats= was born in Dublin in 1865, and was educated\r\nboth in London and in his native city. He studied art, but his real\r\nbent was literary. He was one of the chief supporters of the Celtic\r\nRevival, helped to found the Irish Literary Theatre (1899), wrote plays\r\nfor it, and discovered other literary talent, including that of Mr.\r\nSynge.\r\n\r\nMr. Yeats’s poetry was published in several volumes, and was issued in\r\na collected edition in 1908. _The Wanderings of Oisin_ (1889) was his\r\nfirst volume, and among the rest we may mention _The Countess Cathleen_\r\n(1892), a romantic drama, _The Wind among the Reeds_ (1899), containing\r\nsome of his best lyrics, and _The Wild Swans of Coole_ (1917). Of his\r\npoetical plays _The Land of Heart’s Desire_ (1894) is perhaps the best,\r\nand of the prose dramas _Cathleen ni Hoolihan_ (1902) is a fine example.\r\n\r\nMr. Yeats is a fastidious poet, writing little and revising often.\r\nAs a consequence the average merit of his poetry is very high; and\r\nsometimes, as in the often-quoted _Lake Isle of Innisfree_, he breathes\r\nthe pathos and longing that are generally regarded as typical of\r\nthe Celtic spirit. His style has the usual Celtic peculiarities: a\r\nmeditative and melancholy beauty, a misty idealism, and a sweet and\r\ndignified diction. Mr. Yeats is the most important of the modern Irish\r\npoets.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF LITERARY FORMS\r\n\r\n=1. The Novel.= In mass of production the novel easily outdoes all\r\nother species of literature; in general workmanship it has advanced\r\nexceedingly; and in importance it probably deserves to take the first\r\nplace. We shall comment briefly upon a few of the outstanding lines of\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _The Novel as Propaganda._ The “purpose novel” has long been a\r\nfeature of our literature, but was never so prominent as it is to-day.\r\nIt seems as if the novel were swallowing up the duties of the sermon,\r\nthe pamphlet, and the text-book. Of all the subjects that are discussed\r\nsocial and religious questions are the most popular.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The Realism of the Novel._ This will probably be regarded\r\nas typical of the age. The realistic novel certainly forms a large\r\nproportion of the whole. In subject it deals with modern life in all\r\nits complexity; in detail it seeks to reflect faithfully the world we\r\nlive in; and in style it is studiously subdued. How much this modern\r\ndevelopment makes for the improvement of the novel is a question still\r\nunsolved. In the hands of a novelist of the caliber of Mr. Hardy\r\nrealism becomes actual beauty, and George Gissing and Mr. Galsworthy\r\nare able to make it artistically important. In lesser hands, however,\r\nrealism is apt to degenerate into squalor and ugliness, and the\r\nstudious simplicity of style becomes a dreary burden.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _The Romantic Novel._ Along with the flood of realistic novels,\r\nthere is a steady stream of the romantic kind. Mr. Kipling, who seems\r\nto delight in such mundane things as machinery, is concerned with\r\nshowing the intense romantic beauty behind them. Other writers, such as\r\n=Maurice Hewlett= and =Kenneth Grahame=, are openly absorbed in things\r\nthat are remote and beautiful--the essential qualities of the romance.\r\nOn the other hand, it is unfortunately true that the historical novel\r\nshows hardly a flicker of life.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _The Commercializing of the Novel._ It is a common habit to decry\r\nthe age one lives in, and the present age is no exception. It is freely\r\ndeclared that, in spite of the importance attained by the novel, there\r\nare few great novelists, and that the level of merit, such as it is,\r\nwill rapidly fall. The decline, moreover, is (it is declared) due to\r\nthe stress that is being laid upon the commercial value of fiction.\r\nNovels are now expensive things to publish; to make each one of them\r\nworth publishing a large circulation must be assured; to ensure\r\nthis circulation the novel must appeal to the vulgar taste, and must\r\navoid originality and teasing literary devices--these are the charges\r\nlevelled against the modern novel. Such assertions are exaggerated, but\r\nthere is no doubt that the persistent desire to turn the novel into a\r\ncommercial chattel will lead to its decline as literature.\r\n\r\n=2. The Short Story.= This type of fiction has become so important that\r\nit is here necessary to give a very brief sketch of its development.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Definition._ To define a “short” story, we must clearly come to\r\nsome conclusion as to length. We can approximately define this length\r\nby saying that a short story should be capable of being read at one\r\nbrief sitting.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Medium of Publication._ At the very outset a difficulty met\r\nthe writer of the short story: how was he to get his work published?\r\nThe short story is not long enough to appear as a book by itself.\r\nThere were two ways of overcoming the difficulty: by inserting (or\r\ninterpolating) the short story in the midst of a long one, or by using\r\nit as an item in a magazine. We shall trace the development of both\r\nthese methods. The publication of collections of short stories in\r\nvolume form is a comparatively modern practice.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _The Interpolated Story._ This was the earliest form of the\r\nshort story. As early as the romance of _Don Quixote_ we have one or\r\nmore of the characters of the main story relating some short tale that\r\nacts as a foil to the principal narrative. The interpolated story is\r\na common device in the picaresque novel, and it is freely employed by\r\nDefoe, Fielding, Smollett, and Sterne. Scott, in his famous _Wandering\r\nWillie’s Tale_, which is introduced in _Redgauntlet_, continues the\r\npractice; and as late as Dickens we have the common use of short\r\nstories, some of them of very inferior quality, in _The Pickwick\r\nPapers_. At this point the interpolated story becomes quite rare in\r\ngood fiction, for the magazine has appeared on the scene and has\r\nprovided the natural medium for the genuine short story. In many cases\r\nthe interpolated tale is of great merit, but it spoils the unity of the\r\nmain story, and so it is better out of the way.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _The Magazine Short Story._ The development of the popular\r\nmagazine led to the establishment of this class of tale. In English\r\nits history can be said to begin with Addison, whose Coverley papers\r\nare really a collection of short stories; the record continued through\r\nthe eighteenth century in the miscellaneous work of Goldsmith and Dr.\r\nJohnson. During the first half of the nineteenth century there was\r\na decline in the production of the short story. The lighter type of\r\nmagazine was not yet in favor, and the more ponderous journals, like\r\n_The Quarterly Review_ and _The Edinburgh Review_, which specialized in\r\nliterary and political articles, held the stage. _Blackwood’s Magazine_\r\nand _The London Magazine_ encouraged the more popular kinds of fiction.\r\nAmong their contributors were James Hogg, De Quincey, and Charles\r\nLamb. Some of the essays of these writers, such as Lamb’s famous tale\r\nof roast pig, are short stories thinly disguised. Another contributor\r\nof the same kind was =Douglas Jerrold (1803–57)=, whose _Cakes and\r\nAle_ (1842) is one of the first collections of short stories and\r\nsketches. After the middle of the century there was a rapid increase in\r\npart-fiction magazines, such as Dickens’s _All the Year Round_ (1859)\r\nand Thackeray’s _Cornhill Magazine_ (1860). As the century drew near\r\nits close the number of lighter magazines largely increased, until\r\nnowadays we have a large proportion entirely given over to the supply\r\nof fiction. Nearly all the writers of the modern epoch have taken to\r\nthe short story, and most of them have issued this class of their work\r\nin volume form. To the names already mentioned in this chapter we may\r\nadd those of =Sir Arthur Conan Doyle= (born 1859) and =W. W. Jacobs=\r\n(born 1863). The former struck a rich vein in the popular detective\r\nstory, and the latter specialized in the humorous presentation of the\r\nlongshoreman.\r\n\r\n=3. The Drama.= (_a_) _The Poetical Drama._ In this class of drama\r\nthere is little to set on record. The blank-verse tragedy is\r\nstill written with skill and enthusiasm, but there is little of\r\noutstanding merit, and nothing of originality. The poetical dramas\r\nof Mr. Yeats--for example, _The Countess Cathleen_ (1892) and _The\r\nShadowy Waters_ (1900)--have all his mystical beauty, and are the most\r\noriginal of their class. =Stephen Phillips (1868–1915)= achieved some\r\ndistinction, and even considerable stage success, with his smooth\r\nand Tennysonian blank-verse tragedies, such as _Paolo and Francesca_\r\n(1899), _Ulysses_ (1902), and _The Virgin Goddess_ (1910). Mr. Hardy’s\r\n_Dynasts_ is dramatic only in form; it is rather a philosophical poem\r\nwith a dramatic setting.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The Prose Drama._ In this age the activity of the prose drama is\r\nsecond only to that of the novel. The mood of the time is essentially\r\ncritical, and the prose drama is an excellent medium for expressing\r\nsuch a mood. Among the earliest of the modern dramatists is =Sir\r\nArthur Pinero= (born 1855), and we can trace the development through\r\nthe work of Mr. Galsworthy, already mentioned, and of =St. John Hankin\r\n(1869–1909)= and =Granville Barker= (born 1877). Their plays have the\r\nnote of the realistic novel in the emphasis they lay upon common life\r\nand common speech. The plays of Mr. Shaw, by reason of their wit and\r\nhigh spirits, stand rather apart from this class; and the brilliance of\r\nthe Wilde comedies is that of a past age.\r\n\r\n=4. Poetry.= (_a_) The main poetical tendency of the time is toward the\r\n_lyric_, especially toward a chastened and rather tepid form of it. Of\r\nthis class, the lyrics of Sir William Watson are fairly typical. Mr.\r\nDavies’s best pieces, and some of Mr. Hardy’s, are good examples of the\r\nsimple and direct lyric, and Francis Thompson excels in the descriptive\r\nstyle.\r\n\r\n(_b_) In the class of _descriptive-narrative poetry_ we have the\r\nsea-pieces of Mr. Masefield and the rustic poetry of Mr. Drinkwater. To\r\nthese we must add the work of =Ralph Hodgson= (born 1871), several of\r\nwhose poems, in particular _The Bull_ and _The Song of Honour_, have\r\nsome of the ecstatic energy of the young Coleridge.\r\n\r\n(_c_) In addition to what we may call the standard types of poetry,\r\nthere are experiments in _vers libre_, or _free verse_ (that is,\r\nrhymeless verse of the type of Matthew Arnold’s _The Strayed\r\nReveller_), and the more daring efforts of others who defy the\r\nconventions of rhyme, meter, and even intelligibility. Experiments such\r\nas these are all for the good of poetry, which, if it is to live at\r\nall, must live by progressing. So far, the attempts of the innovators\r\nhave produced nothing that is really noteworthy; and with that we must\r\nleave them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF LITERARY STYLE\r\n\r\n=1. Poetry.= As can easily be understood, in such a troubled age\r\nthere is little uniformity in style. The average verse is distinguished\r\nby a correct and scholarly diction, somewhat ornate, but clear and ably\r\nused. Of the highly ornate style there is little to mention, except the\r\nmore elaborate compositions of Francis Thompson; but from the scholarly\r\nelegance of =Dr. Bridges= (born 1844) we may run down the scale\r\nof simplicity through the mannered graces of Mr. Kipling, the crabbed\r\nsatiric verses of Mr. Hardy, the high simplicity of Mr. Davies, to\r\nthe sweet child-verse of =Walter de la Mare= (born 1873), whose\r\n_Songs of Childhood_ (1902), _Peacock Pie_ (1913), and other\r\nvolumes are the almost perfect expression of artless youth. When we\r\narrive here we cannot allow to pass unnoticed the lyrics of =James\r\nStephens= (born 1882), whose poems of country life are simplicity\r\nitself, but full of the deepest sympathy. His short poem called _The\r\nSnare_ is a little masterpiece.\r\n\r\nWhen simplicity develops further it becomes realism, and in poetry\r\nthe prevailing taste is revealed. The European War, as was natural,\r\nproduced a crop of realistic poems. Of this kind are the verses of\r\n=Siegfried Sassoon= (born 1886), whose war-poems are distinguished\r\nby a passionate desire to get to grips with reality.\r\n\r\n=2. Prose.= In this age, as in most other ages, there is much\r\nlamentation over the decay of English prose. There is probably a great\r\ndeal of truth in the charge that our prose is lapsing into slovenly\r\nways, and there is no doubt that the stress of modern methods leads to\r\nhaphazard and makeshift production. On the other hand, we have but to\r\nglance at the names that have a place in this chapter to find exponents\r\nof prose styles who represent the best traditions: the reverent respect\r\nshown for English in the ornate prose of Mr. Conrad; the massive\r\nmiddle prose of Mr. Hardy; the sonorous and poetical mannerisms of the\r\nCelts; the eighteenth-century grace and precision of Lord Morley; the\r\nswift, clean swoop of the Shavian manner; and the quick ease of Mr.\r\nWells. Surely such an age is not unblessed. With regard to the future\r\nnone dare dogmatize; but, with a confidence born of the knowledge of\r\nnineteen centuries, one can look forward undismayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    GENERAL QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES\r\n\r\n       NOTE.--_In answering some of the following questions the\r\n             General Tables (Appendix I) will be of use._\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

Now glowed the firmament\r\n        With living sapphires; Hesperus, that led\r\n        The starry host, rode brightest till the moon,\r\n        Rising in clouded majesty, at length\r\n        Apparent queen, unveiled her peerless light\r\n        And o’er the dark her silver mantle threw.\r\n                                   MILTON, _Paradise Lost_\r\n\r\n    (2) At length a pleasant instantaneous gleam\r\n        Startles the pensive traveller while he treads\r\n        His lonesome path, with unobserving eye\r\n        Bent earthwards; he looks up--the clouds are split\r\n        Asunder,--and above his head he sees\r\n        The clear Moon, and the glory of the heavens.\r\n        There, in a black-blue vault she sails along,\r\n        Followed by multitudes of stars, that, small\r\n        And sharp and bright, along the dark abyss\r\n        Drive as she drives: how fast they wheel away,\r\n        Yet vanish not!--the wind is in the tree,\r\n        But they are silent;--still they roll along\r\n        Immeasurably distant; and the vault,\r\n        Built round by those white clouds, enormous clouds,\r\n        Still deepens its unfathomable depth.\r\n        At length the Vision closes; and the mind,\r\n        Not undisturbed by the delight it feels,\r\n        Which slowly settles into peaceful calm,\r\n        Is left to muse upon the solemn scene.\r\n                                WORDSWORTH, _The Prelude_\r\n\r\n    (3) And from the reading, and that slab I leant\r\n        My elbow on, the while I read and read\r\n        I turned, to free myself and find the world,\r\n        And stepped out on the narrow terrace, built\r\n        Over the street and opposite the church,\r\n        And paced its lozenge brickwork sprinkled cool;\r\n        Because Felice-church-side stretched, a-glow\r\n        Through each square window fringed for festival,\r\n        Whence came the clear voice of the cloistered ones\r\n        Chanting a chant made for midsummer nights--\r\n        I know not what particular praise of God,\r\n        It always came and went with June. Beneath\r\n        I’ the street, quick shown by openings of the sky\r\n        When flame fell silently from cloud to cloud,\r\n        Richer than that gold snow Jove rained on Rhodes,\r\n        The townsmen walked by twos and threes, and talked,\r\n        Drinking the blackness in default of air--\r\n        A busy human sense beneath my feet:\r\n        While in and out the terrace-plants, and round\r\n        One branch of tall datura, waxed and waned\r\n        The lamp-fly lured there, wanting the white flower.\r\n        Over the roof o’ the lighted church I looked\r\n        A bowshot to the street’s end, north away\r\n        Out of the Roman gate to the Roman road\r\n        By the river, till I felt the Apennine.\r\n                           BROWNING, _The Ring and the Book_\r\n\r\n2.

Who\r\n   deserved the most blame, in mine opinion, it is doubtful and\r\n   so difficult, that I dare not presume to give verdict. For love\r\n   being the cause for which so many mischiefs have been attempted,\r\n   I am not yet persuaded whether of them was most to be blamed,\r\n   but certainly neither of them was blameless.\r\n                                    LYLY, _Euphues and his England_\r\n\r\n\r\n   (2) A doubtful truce restored the appearances of concord, till\r\n   the death of Abu Taleb abandoned Mahomet to the power of his\r\n   enemies, at the moment when he was deprived of his domestic\r\n   comforts by the loss of his faithful and generous Cadijah. Abu\r\n   Sophian, the chief of the branch of Ommiyah, succeeded to the\r\n   principality of the republic of Mecca. A zealous votary of\r\n   the idols, a mortal foe of the line of Hashem, he convened an\r\n   assembly of the Koreishites and their allies, to decide the fate\r\n   of the apostle. His imprisonment might provoke the despair of\r\n   his enthusiasm; and the exile of an eloquent and popular fanatic\r\n   would diffuse the mischief through the provinces of Arabia.\r\n   His death was resolved; and they agreed that a sword from each\r\n   tribe should be buried in his heart, to divide the guilt of the\r\n   blood, and baffle the vengeance of the Hashemites. An angel or a\r\n   spy revealed their conspiracy; and flight was the only resource\r\n   of Mahomet. At the dead of night, accompanied by his friend\r\n   Abubeker, he silently escaped from his house: the assassins\r\n   watched at the door; but they were deceived by the figure of\r\n   Ali, who reposed on the bed, and was covered with the green\r\n   vestment of the apostle.\r\n              GIBBON, _The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_\r\n\r\n\r\n   (3) There was no sleeping in the daytime on the planter’s\r\n   clearing: the wages were too high to risk. Deesa sat on Moti\r\n   Guj’s neck and gave him orders, while Moti Guj rooted up the\r\n   stumps--for he owned a magnificent pair of tusks; or pulled at\r\n   the end of a rope--for he had a magnificent pair of shoulders;\r\n   while Deesa kicked behind the ears and said he was the king of\r\n   elephants. At evening time Moti Guj would wash down his three\r\n   hundred pounds’ weight of green food with a quart of arrack,\r\n   and Deesa would take a share and sing songs between Moti Guj’s\r\n   legs till it was time to go to bed. Once a week Deesa led Moti\r\n   Guj down to the river, and Moti Guj lay on his side luxuriously\r\n   in the shallows, while Deesa went over him with a coir-swab and\r\n   a brick.... Then Deesa would look at his feet, and examine his\r\n   eyes, and turn up the fringes of his mighty ears in case of\r\n   sores or budding ophthalmia. After inspection, the two would\r\n   “come up with a song from the sea,”\r\n\r\n   Moti Guj all black and shining, waving a torn tree branch twelve\r\n   feet long in his trunk, and Deesa knotting up his own long wet\r\n   hair.\r\n                                  KIPLING, _Moti Guj--Mutineer_\r\n\r\n\r\n   (4) As the dawn was just breaking he found himself close to\r\n   Covent Garden. The darkness lifted, and, flushed with faint\r\n   fires, the sky hollowed itself into a perfect pearl. Huge carts\r\n   filled with nodding lilies rumbled slowly down the polished\r\n   empty street. The air was heavy with the perfume of the flowers,\r\n   and their beauty seemed to bring him an anodyne for his pain. He\r\n   followed into the market, and watched the men unloading their\r\n   waggons. A white-smocked carter offered him some cherries. He\r\n   thanked him, and wondered why he refused to accept any money for\r\n   them, and began to eat them listlessly. They had been plucked at\r\n   midnight, and the coldness of the moon had entered into them.\r\n   A long line of boys carrying crates of striped tulips, and of\r\n   yellow and red roses, defiled in front of him, threading their\r\n   way through the huge jade-green piles of vegetables. Under the\r\n   portico, with its grey sun-bleached pillars, loitered a group of\r\n   draggled, bareheaded girls, waiting for the auction to be over.\r\n   Others crowded round the swinging doors of the coffee-house in\r\n   the Piazza. The heavy cart-horses slipped and stamped upon the\r\n   rough stones, shaking their bells and trappings. Some of the\r\n   drivers were lying asleep on a pile of sacks. Iris-necked and\r\n   pink-footed, the pigeons ran about picking up seeds.\r\n                                WILDE, _The Picture of Dorian Gray_\r\n\r\n\r\n3.

E’en beasts couch, hide by hide,\r\n        In a growling, grudged agreement: so, father and son aye curled\r\n        The closelier up in their den because the last of their kind in\r\n          the world.\r\n                                          BROWNING, _Halbert and Hob_\r\n\r\n(3) (_A newcomer overhears some men discussing his wife._)\r\n\r\n        “And he knows nothing of her past;\r\n        I am glad the girl’s in luck at last;\r\n        Such ones, though stale to native eyes,\r\n        Newcomers snatch at as a prize.”\r\n\r\n        “Yes, being a stranger he sees her blent\r\n        Of all that’s fresh and innocent,\r\n        Nor dreams how many a love-campaign\r\n        She had enjoyed before his reign!”\r\n\r\n        That night there was the splash of a fall\r\n        Over the slimy harbour-wall:\r\n        They searched, and at the deepest place\r\n        Found him with crabs upon his face.\r\n                      HARDY, _Satires of Circumstance_\r\n\r\n    (4) Some ancient man with silver locks\r\n        Will lift his weary face to say:\r\n        “War was a fiend who stopped our clocks\r\n        Although we met him grim and gay.”\r\n        And then he’ll speak of Haig’s last drive,\r\n        Marvelling that any came alive\r\n        Out of the shambles that men built\r\n        And smashed, to cleanse the world of guilt.\r\n        But the boys, with grin and sidelong glance,\r\n        Will think, “Poor grandad’s day is done.”\r\n        And dream of those who fought in France\r\n        And lived in time to share the fun.\r\n                       SASSOON, _Songbooks of the War_\r\n\r\n7.

If I go back to mine own country, that is\r\n   prepared for fire and brimstone; and I shall certainly perish\r\n   there. If I can get to the celestial city, I am sure to be in\r\n   safety there. I must venture. To go back is nothing but death;\r\n   to go forward is fear of death, and life everlasting beyond it.\r\n   I will yet go forward.” So Mistrust and Timorous ran down the\r\n   hill; and Christian went on his way. But thinking again of what\r\n   he heard from the men, he felt in his bosom for his roll, that\r\n   he might read therein and be comforted; but he felt and found it\r\n   not.\r\n\r\n   (2) His prose is the model of the middle style: on grave\r\n   subjects not formal, on light occasions not grovelling; pure\r\n   without scrupulosity, and exact without apparent elaboration;\r\n   always equable and always easy, without glowing words or pointed\r\n   sentences. Addison never deviates from his track to snatch a\r\n   grace; he seeks no ambitious ornaments and tries no hazardous\r\n   innovations. His page is always luminous, but never blazes in\r\n   unexpected splendour.\r\n\r\n   (3) Two men I honour, and no third. First, the toilworn\r\n   Craftsman that with earth-made Implement laboriously conquers\r\n   the Earth, and makes her man’s. Venerable to me is the hard\r\n   Hand; crooked, coarse; wherein notwithstanding lies a cunning\r\n   virtue, indefeasibly royal, as of the Sceptre of this Planet.\r\n   Venerable too is the rugged face, all weather-tanned, besoiled,\r\n   with its rude intelligence; for it is the face of a Man living\r\n   manlike. O, but the more venerable for thy rudeness, and even\r\n   because we must pity as well as love thee! Hardly-entreated\r\n   Brother! For us was thy back so bent, for us were thy straight\r\n   limbs and fingers so deformed: thou wert our Conscript, on whom\r\n   the lot fell, and fighting our battles wert so marred.\r\n\r\n11.
