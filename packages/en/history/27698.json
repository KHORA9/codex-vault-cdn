GAYLORD, ESQ.,\r\n\r\n_COUNSELLOR AT LAW_,\r\n\r\nOF CLEVELAND, OHIO,\r\n\r\nTO WHOSE BROTHERLY CARE IT IS LARGELY DUE THAT I LIVED TO\r\nTRANSLATE THEM,\r\n\r\nTHESE VOLUMES\r\n\r\nARE AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATOR’S PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur literature is rich enough in works on the principles of Political\r\nEconomy. So far as the translator is informed, however, it possesses none\r\nin which the science is treated in accordance with the historical method.\r\nWe may therefore venture to express the hope that this translation will\r\nfill a place hitherto unoccupied in the literatures of England and\r\nAmerica, and fill it all the more efficiently and acceptably, as Professor\r\nROSCHER is the founder and still the leader of the historical school of\r\nPolitical Economy. Were this the only recommendation of our undertaking,\r\nit would not be a useless one. But a glance at Professor ROSCHER’S book\r\nwill convince even the most hasty reader that its pages fascinate by their\r\ninterest and are rich in treasures of erudition which should not remain\r\ninaccessible to the English student from being locked up in a foreign\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\nThe present translation has received, throughout, the revision of the\r\nauthor, and should any imperfections remain in the rendering of his\r\nthought into English, the blame is certainly not his, for his revision has\r\nbeen most minute.\r\n\r\nThe three appendices have been supplied by Professor ROSCHER expressly for\r\nthis edition. As they are intended to form a part of the work on the\r\nPolitical Economy of Industry and Commerce, on which he is now engaged, he\r\nauthorizes their publication in English, only by the publishers of this\r\nedition of his principles; and only for the purpose of being added to the\r\npresent translation. He desires especially that their appearance in their\r\npresent shape should not in any way interfere with any of his rights in\r\nhis forthcoming volume, and that they should not be translated into any\r\nlanguage nor translated back into German.\r\n\r\nThe essay of Mr. WOLOWSKI, on the historical method in Political Economy\r\nconstitutes no part of Professor ROSCHER’S book, and neither he nor its\r\nauthor, but only the translator, is responsible for its appearance here.\r\nIn it the reader will find a short sketch of the life of Professor\r\nROSCHER, brought down to the date at which the essay was written. The\r\ntranslator has little to add to that sketch, all the information he\r\npossesses in addition to what it contains being embraced in the following\r\nlines from a letter received by him from the author in answer to a request\r\nthat he would supply the biographical data not to be found in WOLOWSKI’S\r\nessay: “You might perhaps say ... that I have repeatedly declined calls to\r\nthe Universities of Munich, Vienna and Berlin, but that I have never\r\nregretted remaining in Leipzig.”\r\n\r\nThe acknowledgments of the translator are due, in the first place, to the\r\neminent author himself, for the revision of the plate-proof of the entire\r\nwork, and then to Professor WILLIAM F. ALLEN, of the University of\r\nWisconsin, for his interest in the progress of the enterprise, and for\r\nmany valuable suggestions; also to Professor W. G. SUMNER, of Yale\r\nCollege, for some excellent hints as to the best translation of certain\r\nwords in the Appendix on Paper Money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR’S PREFACE. (1ST EDITION.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMy _System der Volkswirthschaft_ shall, _Deo volente_, be completed in\r\nfour parts. The second shall contain the national economy of agriculture\r\nand the related branches of natural production; the third, the national\r\neconomy of industry and commerce; the fourth, of the economy of the state\r\nand of the commune (_Gemeindehaushalt_). While the entire work shall\r\nconstitute one systematic whole, each part shall have its own appropriate\r\ntitle, constitute an independent treatise, and be sold separately.\r\n\r\nOf the peculiar method which I have followed in this work, and which will\r\nproduce still better fruits in the succeeding volumes, I have given a\r\nsufficient explanation in §§ 26 ff., and all I desire now is to say a few\r\nwords on the relation the notes bear to the text. The careful reader will\r\nsoon be convinced that of the many citations in this work, not one has\r\nbeen made from a vain desire of the display of erudition. Part of them\r\nserves as the necessary proof of surprising facts adduced, but which are\r\nlittle known. Another part of them is intended to incite the reader to the\r\nstudy of certain questions nearly related to those treated in the text,\r\nbut which are still different from them. The object of the greater number\r\nis to supply information concerning the history of economic principles. As\r\nfar as the sources at my command permitted, I have endeavored to point out\r\nthe first germs, the chief stages of development, the contrasts, and,\r\nfinally, what has been thus far attained in economic science. This\r\nsometimes required some little victory over self, inasmuch as I was\r\nconscious of having independently discovered certain facts, when I\r\nafterwards found that some old and long-forgotten writer had made similar\r\nobservations. Thus, this work may serve both as a handbook and as a\r\nhistory of the literature of Political Economy. Students of the science\r\nknow how little has thus far been done by writers in this direction. And\r\nhence I shall be very grateful to those who labor in the same field, if\r\nthey will, either by writing to me personally, or through the medium of\r\nthe press, inform me when I have erred in ascribing a truth, or a\r\nscientifically important error, to its earliest author.\r\n\r\nI have already said in the title that this work is intended not for the\r\nlearned only, but for all educated men, for men of a serious turn of mind,\r\nwho desire truth and science for their own sake. Like that ancient\r\nhistorian, whom I honor above all others as my teacher, I desire that my\r\nwork should be useful to those, ὅσοι βουλήσοντοι τῶν τε γενομένων τὸ σαφὲς\r\nσκοπεῖν καὶ τῶν μελλόντων ποτὲ αὖθις κατὰ τὸ ἀνθρώπειον τοιούτων καὶ\r\nπαραπλησίων ἔσεσθαι. (_Thucydides_ I, 22.)\r\n\r\nUNIVERSITY OF LEIPZIG,\r\n\r\n_End of May, 1854._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE AUTHOR’S PREFACES. (2D TO 11TH EDITION.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preface to the second edition is dated October, 1856; that to the\r\nthird, April, 1858; that to the fourth, April, 1861; that to the fifth,\r\nNovember, 1863; that to the sixth, November, 1865; that to the seventh,\r\nNovember, 1868; that to the eighth, August, 1869; that to the ninth,\r\nMarch, 1871; that to the tenth, May, 1873; that to the eleventh\r\n(unaltered), December, 1873. Each successive edition, nearly, has been\r\nannounced as an improved and enlarged one; and the tenth edition contains\r\none hundred and fifty-six pages more than the first, although in places, a\r\nlarge number of abbreviations had been made from previous editions. There\r\nare many things in some of the previous editions which criticism induced\r\nme, long since, to change. I have considered it my duty to the public, who\r\ngave my work so warm and friendly a reception, to take into consideration,\r\nin each successive edition, not only my own new investigations, but those\r\nalso of all others with which I became acquainted, and, whenever possible,\r\nto correct statistical illustrations from the latest sources. I have\r\nespecially, in each following edition, enriched a number of paragraphs\r\nwith here and there historical, ethnographic and statistical features.\r\nPlutarch is certainly right, spite of the fact that pedants may abuse him\r\nfor it, when he says, that trifling acts, a word and even a jest, are\r\noften more important, as characterizing the life of a people or an age,\r\nthan great battles which cost the lives of tens of thousands of men.\r\n\r\nI have changed the titles “Ricardo’s Law of Rent,” and “The Malthusian Law\r\nof the Increase of Population,” which I formerly used, for others. But I\r\nwould not be misunderstood here. I hold it to be a duty of reverence in\r\nthe learned—as it has long been practiced in the case of the natural\r\nsciences—in the sciences of the human mind to call the natural laws,\r\nmethods etc., in acquainting us with which, some one particular\r\ninvestigator has won very distinguished merit, by the name of that\r\ninvestigator. In the case of the law of rent, the application of this rule\r\nwould as unquestionably entitle Ricardo to this honor as it would Malthus\r\nin that of the increase of population, spite of the fact that Ricardo may\r\nnot have succeeded in finding the best possible form of the abstraction,\r\nand although Malthus even, in a one-sided reaction against a former still\r\ngreater one-sidedness, was not always able to steer clear of positive and\r\nnegative errors. Recent science has endeavored, and successfully, to\r\nexamine the facts which contradict the Ricardoan and Malthusian\r\nformulations of the laws in question, and to extend the formulas\r\naccordingly. I have myself contributed hereto to the extent of my ability.\r\nBut, in the interval, it is not hard to comprehend that, while this\r\nprocess of elucidation is going on, most scholars, those especially\r\npossessed more of a dogmatic than of a historical turn of mind, should\r\nestimate these two leaders more in accordance with their few defects than\r\nwith the great merits of their discoveries. If, therefore, I now drop the\r\ntitle “Malthusian law,” it is to guard hasty readers from the illusion\r\nthat §§ 242 seq. teach what the great crowd understand by Malthusianism;\r\nwhen they might, perhaps, omit that portion entirely. For my own part, I\r\nhave no doubt that, when the process of elucidation above referred to\r\nshall have been thoroughly finished, the future will accord both to\r\nRicardo and Malthus their full meed of honor as political economists and\r\ndiscoverers of the first rank.(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY ESSAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreliminary Essay On The Application Of The Historical Method To The Study\r\n                          Of Political Economy,\r\n\r\n                             By M. Wolowski,\r\n\r\n                    Member Of The Institute Of France.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “_Nunquam bene percipiemus usu necessarium nisi et noverimus jus\r\n    illud usu non necessarium. Nexum est et colligatum alterum alteri.\r\n    Nulli sunt servi nobis, cur quæstiones de servis vexamus? Digna\r\n    imperito vox._”—_Cuj._, vii, in titul. Dig. De Justitia et\r\n    Jure.(2)\r\n\r\n\r\n    “_Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto._”—_Terence._(3)\r\n\r\n\r\n    “_Ista præpotens, ac gloriosa philosophia._”—_Cicero_, De Or., I,\r\n    43.(4)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is no foolish desire to make a vain display of citations, that induces\r\nus, at the beginning of this essay, intended to point out the results of\r\nthe application of a new method to the study of Political Economy, to\r\ninvoke the authority of a poet and moralist, of a jurisconsult and of a\r\nphilosopher. The writer finds in the words just quoted the loftiest\r\nexpression of the thought which dictates these lines, viz.: that the\r\nimpartial researches of history, a profound feeling of man’s moral and\r\nmaterial wants, and the light of philosophy, should govern in the teaching\r\nof a science, the object of which is to show us how those things which are\r\nintended to satisfy our wants are produced and distributed among the\r\nseveral classes or individuals of a nation; how they are exchanged one\r\nagainst another, and how they are consumed.\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth century affords us something more than the admirable\r\nspectacle of the rapid and fertile development of mechanical power and\r\nnatural forces. This is but one of the aspects, we might even say but one\r\nof the results, of the general progress of the human mind. The renovation\r\nof moral and intellectual studies has served as a starting point for the\r\napplication to facts of the conquests of thought. Science has preceded\r\nart.\r\n\r\nIn the foremost rank of the studies just referred to is _philosophy_,\r\nwhich initiates us into the knowledge of human nature, the basis of right,\r\nand which translates its legitimate aspirations into a language which we\r\ncan understand; _history_, that _prophetess_ of the truth, as one of the\r\nancients called it, which places before us the faithful picture of times\r\npast, not by simply putting together a skeleton of facts, but by following\r\nthe living progress of events and the organic development of institutions.\r\nSuch, at least, has been the work of those noble minds who have\r\nconsecrated their energies to the resuscitation of ages past, in their\r\ntrue shape, and such is the service for which we are indebted to them for\r\nthe successful accomplishment of the reformation of historical studies,\r\nwhich they attempted with such rare devotion and such marvelous sagacity.\r\n\r\nThis renovation of history has exerted the most fertile influence in the\r\nregion of philosophy, in that of law, and we believe that it will prove no\r\nless useful in that of Political Economy. It has served to put us on our\r\nguard against being easily misled by _a priori_ notions.\r\n\r\nBy exhibiting to us the results of the life and of the experience of\r\ncenturies, by teaching us by what steps the human mind has risen to its\r\npresent eminence, and what the education given it in the past has been, it\r\nhas enabled us to ascend from phenomena to the principles which preside\r\nover them; from facts to the law; and it has substituted for arbitrary\r\nassumptions and purely ideal systems, the slow but progressive work of the\r\ngenius of nations. Not that it turns a deaf ear to the exalted lessons of\r\nphilosophy, nor that it denies the _eternal relations resulting from the\r\nnature of things_. Far from it. On the contrary, it supplies a solid basis\r\nto intellectual investigations, and, so to speak, an answer for all the\r\nmoral sciences, to this saying of Rœderer: “Politics is a field which has\r\nbeen traversed thus far only in a balloon; it is time to put foot on solid\r\nground.”\r\n\r\nNeither does history, as thus understood, confine itself to mere\r\ndescription; it also assumes the office of judge. While it pulls down much\r\nthat passion and inaccuracy have reared, and thus restores respect for the\r\npast, it does not turn that past into a fetish. It looks it boldly in the\r\nface and questions it, instead of prostrating itself before it and\r\nworshipping it with downcast eyes. Thus, by plainly showing us the many\r\nbonds which tie us to it, it escapes at once both the rashness of\r\nimpatience and the wearisomeness of routine.\r\n\r\nThe impartiality it inculcates is not indifference; and there is no danger\r\nthat the justice it metes out to past ages shall degenerate into a vain\r\nscepticism or a convenient optimism.\r\n\r\nThe study of history, thus understood, has another advantage; it accustoms\r\nus to those patient and disinterested investigations, to those lengthy\r\nlabors, the positive result of which at first escapes us for a time, only\r\nto burst on our eyes, with so much more brilliancy, when rigorous research\r\nhas succeeded in discovering it. It frees us from the deadly constraint of\r\nimmediate utility.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more fatal to science than the feverish impatience for\r\nresults which obtains only too much in our own days, and which induces\r\npeople to run after him who is in the greatest hurry, and which leads to\r\nhasty conclusions.\r\n\r\n“Research undertaken from a disinterested love of science,” says the\r\nlearned Hugo, one of the masters of the historical school of law in\r\nGermany,(5) “that research which at first promises no other advantage but\r\ntruth and the culture of the mind, is precisely that which brings us the\r\nrichest rewards. Would we not be behind, in all the sciences, if we had\r\nclung only to those principles, the utility of which in practice was\r\nalready known? Do we not, to-day, from many a discovery, reap advantages\r\nof which its author never dreamed?”\r\n\r\nDoubtless this tendency, unless restrained by other demands, is not exempt\r\nfrom danger. We may be carried away by the attraction peculiar to these\r\nnoble studies, withdraw into antiquity and fall into a species of\r\nhistorical mysticism which ends in the affirmation, that whatever has been\r\nis true, absolutely, and which, instead of confining itself to the\r\nexplanation of transitory phenomena, invests them with all the dignity of\r\nprinciples. We shall endeavor to avoid the peril pointed out by\r\nMallebranche. “Learned men study rather to acquire a chimerical greatness\r\nin the imagination of other men, than to acquire greater breadth and\r\nstrength of mind themselves. They make their heads a kind of store-room,\r\ninto which they gather, without order or discrimination, everything which\r\nhas a look of erudition,—I mean to say everything which may seem rare or\r\nextraordinary and excite the wonder of other people. They glory in getting\r\ntogether, in this archæological museum, antiques with nothing that is rich\r\nor solid about them, and the price of which depends on nothing but fancy,\r\nchance or passion.”\r\n\r\nA display of erudition may obscure the truth, and bury it under its\r\nweight, instead of bringing it out into relief. By concentrating the mind\r\non the material vestiges of the past, it may withdraw it from the\r\nintellectual movement of the present, and give us a race of scholars, of\r\ngreat merit, doubtless, but who move about like strangers among their\r\ncontemporaries.\r\n\r\nWithout a sense for the practical, and without ideas of an elevated\r\nnature, a person may, indeed, be a man of erudition—he cannot be a\r\nhistorian. As the proverb says, the forest cannot be seen, for the trees.\r\nThat this noble study may bear its best and most useful fruit; that is,\r\nthat it should preserve us against ambitious _formulas_ and destructive\r\nchimeras, we must pursue another way.\r\n\r\n“The world,” says Montaigne, “is incapable of curing itself. It is so\r\nimpatient of what burthens it, that it thinks only of how it shall rid\r\nitself of it, without inquiring at what price. A thousand examples show us\r\nthat it cures itself ordinarily at its own cost. The getting rid of the\r\npresent evil is not cure, unless there be a general amendment of\r\ncondition. Good does not immediately succeed evil. One evil, and a worse,\r\nmay follow another, like Cæsar’s assassins, who brought the republic to\r\nsuch a pass, that they had reason to repent the meddling with it.” Such,\r\ntoo frequently, is the lot of those who, abandoning themselves to their\r\nimagination, and without consulting the past, mix together promises of\r\nliberty and the despotism of Utopias which they would impose on nations\r\nunder pretext of enfranchising them. Despising the work of the ages, they\r\nthink they can build upon a soil shaken by destruction and crumbled, until\r\nit may be likened to moving sand.\r\n\r\nContempt for the past is associated with a passion for reform. Men think\r\nof destroying that which should only be transformed. They condemn\r\neverything that has been, unconditionally, and launch out towards a new\r\nfuture. The suffering which has been gone through irritates and troubles\r\nthe mind. The work of pulling down is so easy, it is supposed that the\r\nwork of building up is equally so. Hence systems rise, as if the world\r\nwere to begin anew. The pride of liberty and of human action becomes the\r\nprinciple of science; and, like all new principles, it pretends to\r\nexclusive and absolute dominion. Rationalism governs; abstract philosophy\r\nignores the traditions and the requirements of the life of nations; and\r\nfinds now in it, as in geometry, nothing but principles and deductions.\r\nThe memory of recent oppression causes us to act as Tarquin did, and to\r\nlevel down the higher classes instead of elevating the inferior. Liberty\r\nand equality then govern by their negative side, instead of exercising the\r\npositive and beneficent influence they should have, to develop all forces\r\nto their utmost, to ennoble the mind, to give more elasticity to the soul\r\nand greater vigor to thought, to give birth to those varied forms and to\r\nthat moral energy, which should bring us nearer to final equality in the\r\nbosom of God.(6)\r\n\r\nWe forget that no one is born _free_, and that every one ought to endeavor\r\nto become so,\r\n\r\n\r\n    Feindlich ist des Mannes Streben\r\n    Mit zermalmender Gewalt\r\n    Geht der Wilde durch des Leben\r\n    Ohne Rast und Aufenthalt,\r\n\r\n    —_Schiller_.\r\n\r\n\r\nand make himself worthy of liberty, by the exercise of manly virtue!\r\nBecause the form has been changed, we believe that we have changed human\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand, why, where these ideas prevail, the study of the\r\npast should be neglected and despised. Efforts are made to avoid it. Why,\r\nit is asked, revive memories of oppression and misery? The old world is\r\nwrecked. It is annihilated. Peace to its ashes! Or else, after it has been\r\ndestroyed, it is sought for again; and, under pretext of eradicating the\r\nevils existing in it, an attack is made on the eternal basis on which\r\nhuman society rests, on the laws not made by man, and which it is not\r\ngiven to man to change. The world becomes one vast laboratory, in which\r\nthe rashest experiments are multiplied in number, in which mankind is but\r\nclay in the hands of the potter which every pretended “thinker” may mould\r\nat will, by giving him the false appearances of independence and of an\r\nemancipated being.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, if the will of man be all-powerful, if states are to be\r\ndistinguished from one another only by their boundaries, if everything may\r\nbe changed like the scenery in a play by a flourish of the magic wand of a\r\nsystem, if man may arbitrarily make the right, if nations can be put\r\nthrough evolutions like a regiment of troops; what a field would the world\r\npresent for attempts at the realization of the wildest dreams, and what a\r\ntemptation would be offered to take possession, by main force, of the\r\ngovernment of human affairs, to destroy the rights of property and the\r\nrights of capital, to gratify ardent longings without trouble, and provide\r\nthe much coveted means of enjoyment. The Titans have tried to scale the\r\nheavens, and have fallen into the most degrading materialism. Purely\r\nspeculative dogmatism sinks into materialism.\r\n\r\nAll is changed, both men and things. Yet we hear the same old style of\r\ndeclamation. There are those who wish to plough up the soil which the\r\nharrow of the revolution went over yesterday; and they believe they are\r\nmarching in the way of progress. They do not see that they have mistaken\r\ntheir age, and that the bold attempts of the past have now come to possess\r\na directly opposite meaning. Without stopping to inquire to what side the\r\nnew world inclines, they repeat the same words, and swear _in verba\r\nmagistri_, and go the road of destruction, believing themselves to be\r\ncreating the world anew!\r\n\r\nNothing is more natural than that these excesses should produce other\r\nexcesses, in a contrary direction. Moved by hatred or fear of\r\nrevolutionary absolutism, nations seek an asylum in governmental\r\nabsolutism, or they retrograde towards the middle ages, and consider the\r\nmutual bond of protection and dependence of that period as the ideal and\r\nthe realization of true liberty. History is no longer the organic\r\ndevelopment of social life, and man, like a soldier that thoughtlessly and\r\ncapriciously has gone beyond his place of supplies, is obliged to retrace\r\nhis steps. The reaction is clearly defined. The past is opposed to the\r\npresent, not as a lesson to be turned to advantage, but as a model which\r\nmust be hastily accepted; and men become revolutionary in a backward\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nHowever, history, rigorously studied, knows neither these complaisances\r\nnor these weaknesses. It does not descend to the apotheosis of a past\r\nwhich cannot return again. The real historical spirit consists in rightly\r\ndiscerning what belongs to each epoch. Its object is, by no means, to call\r\nback the dead to life, but to explain why and how they lived. In harmony\r\nwith a healthy philosophy, it assigns a limit to the vagaries of arbitrary\r\nwill, beyond which the latter cannot go. It unceasingly calls us back,\r\nfrom the heights of abstraction, to positive facts and things.\r\n\r\nIn the creation of systems, only one thing was wont to be forgotten, men,\r\nwho were treated, in them, like so many ciphers; for intellectual\r\ndespotism has this in common with all despotic authority. History teaches\r\nus that we can reach nothing great or lasting, but by addressing ourselves\r\nto the soul. If the soul decays, there can be no longer great thoughts or\r\ngreat actions. Society lives by the spirit which inhabits it. It may, for\r\nan instant, submit to the empire of force, but, in the long run, it\r\nhearkens only to the voice of justice. It was thus that the greatest\r\nrevolution which history records, that of Christianity, was accomplished.\r\nIt addressed itself only to the soul; but by changing the hearts of men,\r\nit transformed society entirely.\r\n\r\nThe violent struggle between an imperious dogmatism and an unintelligent\r\nand mistaken attempt at a retrogressive movement is resolved into a higher\r\nview, which permits the union of conservatism and progress. Violent\r\nattempts and rash endeavors made, threatened to bring contempt on the\r\nnoblest teachings of philosophy, and to make them repulsive to man; and,\r\non the other hand, a blind respect for the institutions consecrated by\r\nhistory threatened to stifle all examination and all freedom of judgment.\r\n\r\nBut a healthier doctrine has permitted us to understand, that we are\r\ncontinuing the work of preceding generations; that we are developing the\r\ngerms which they successively sowed; that we are perfecting that which\r\nthey had only sketched, and that we are letting drop that which has no\r\nsupport in the social condition of man. Every thing is connected; each\r\nthing is linked to every other; nothing is repeated. The hopes of sudden\r\nand total renovation, based on absolute formulas, vanish before the touch\r\nof this solid study. This shows us how firm and unshaken are those reforms\r\nwhich have begun by taking hold of the minds of men, the precise spirit of\r\nwhich had penetrated into the souls of whole nations before they had\r\nmanifested themselves in facts.\r\n\r\nLaw and Economy constitute a part of the life of nations in the same way\r\nthat language and customs do. The power of history in no way contradicts\r\nthe supremacy of reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese two tendencies, the rationalistic and the historical, are everywhere\r\nfound face to face. They carry on an eternal warfare, which is renewed in\r\nevery age, under new names and new forms. Accomplished facts and\r\nrenovating thought divide the world between them. They at one time\r\nmoderate its speed, and at others, spur it on its way. But these two\r\nforces, instead of compromising the destinies of humanity by their\r\nopposing action, maintain and balance them, as the contrary impulses given\r\nby the hand of the Great Architect has peopled the universe with worlds\r\nwhich gravitate in space.\r\n\r\nVictor Cousin, a very competent authority on the subject, has said that\r\nthe history of philosophy is the torch of philosophy itself. The\r\nremarkable works which have enriched it in this direction are well known.\r\nHistory, on its side, is enlightened by philosophy. Thus, it teaches us\r\nnot to despise facts, but at the same time not to be slaves to precedent.\r\nIt does equal justice to the incredulous and to the fanatic, to too supple\r\npractitioners and to intractable theorizers.\r\n\r\nWe may doubtless say with Henri Klimrath, who, in connection with a few\r\nothers, had undertaken the work of the restoration of historical study in\r\nits application to French law, that there is an absolute, true, beautiful,\r\ngood and just, the _ratio recta summi Jovis_,(7) the supreme reason\r\nfounded in the nature of things.(8) The eternal truths taught by\r\nphilosophy constitute the higher law, a law which dates not from the day\r\non which it was reduced to writing, but from the day of its birth; and it\r\nwas born with the divine intelligence itself. “_Qui non tum denique\r\nincipit lex esse, cum scripta est, sed tum cum orta est. Orta autem simul\r\nest cum mente divina._”(9) And Troplong rightly adds: “There are rules\r\nanterior to all positive laws. I cannot grant that the action of\r\nconscience and the idea of right are the work of the legislator. It is not\r\nlaw that made the family, property, liberty, equality, the idea of good\r\nand evil. It may, indeed, give organization to all these things, but in\r\ndoing so, it is only working on the foundation which nature has laid, and\r\nit is perfect in proportion as it comes nearer to the eternal, immutable\r\nlaws which the Creator has engraved on our hearts. What changes is not the\r\neternal law, the revelation of which comes to man incessantly and by a\r\nnecessary action, but the form in which humanity clothes it, the\r\ninstitutions which man builds on its immutable foundation.”(10)\r\n\r\nWe therefore believe in the law of nature, and regret that our opinion is\r\nnot shared by Mr. Roscher, at least that he does not explicitly enough\r\nexpress his faith in it, nor apply it broadly enough in the beautiful work\r\nwhich we are happy to render accessible to the French public.(11) We\r\nbelieve in it in its philosophical sense, and not simply in the juridical\r\nsense attached to it by Ulpian. “Let us not,” observes Portalis, “confound\r\nthe physical order of nature, common to all animated beings, with the\r\nnatural law which is peculiar to man. We call _natural law_, the\r\nprinciples which govern man considered as a moral being, that is, as an\r\nintelligent and free being, intended to live in the society of other\r\nbeings, intelligent and free like himself.”(12) Ulpian’s famous tripartite\r\ndivision, of natural law, the law of nations, and the civil law, is proof,\r\nfrom the meaning he attaches to them, either of a misunderstanding or of\r\nthe imperfect idea which the Stoics had conceived of the essence of\r\nnatural law. In vain Cujas exhausted all the resources of his noble\r\nintellect to explain it.(13)\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to draw a distinction between physical law and the law\r\n(_droit_) of intelligent beings. Doubtless the existence of men as well as\r\nthat of animals is limited by time. They both live and die; but the soul\r\nescapes the necessities of material nature.\r\n\r\nThe moment there is question of _right_, intelligence governs, reason\r\ncomes into play, and the science of right and wrong is appealed to as a\r\nguide. Hence the _natural_ law of the human species is not the physical\r\nlaw which all creatures obey.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary for us to insist upon these principles. It was necessary\r\nfor us to show that there is a law independent of positive and local law,\r\na law which is not the expression of an arbitrary will, but an emanation\r\nfrom the nature of things.(14)\r\n\r\nHence come the features in common which we meet with everywhere, and the\r\nvariable forms which develop law in harmony with the special conditions of\r\neach civil society.\r\n\r\nWe must descend into the very depths of human nature to discover these\r\neternal and permanent laws; and if the mere effort of the mind should not\r\nreach them directly, they might be discovered in the phenomena of the life\r\nof nations. History affords us the counter-proof and confirmation of the\r\nphilosophical doctrine.\r\n\r\nThe development of society does not afford a mathematical expression of\r\nthese higher truths. It gives them a form which is unceasingly modified in\r\nthe written law. The person who discovers in them nothing but an absolute\r\nrule, looks upon the changes as evidences of caprice and error. He alone\r\nunderstands the revolutions of things who knows their cause and the\r\nnecessity which produces them.\r\n\r\nSolon was right when he gave the Athenians not the most perfect laws, but\r\nthe best which they could bear.\r\n\r\nIt is not in the attempts contemporary with the infancy of society, or\r\nnearly so, that we are to look for the complete realization of the\r\nprecepts of the natural law; for principles obey the rule laid down by\r\nAristotle. “The nature of each thing is precisely that which constitutes\r\nits end; and when each being has attained its entire development, we say\r\nthat that is its own proper nature.”(15)\r\n\r\nThe ideas of natural law are purified in proportion as society grows\r\nenlightened and free; but the truth appears only successively in the\r\nphases it passes through. It allows us to grasp one aspect of itself after\r\nanother, but does not surrender itself entirely, at any one moment, to the\r\ninvestigations of the historian or the jurisconsult.\r\n\r\nHistory and philosophy interpenetrate and complement one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two schools, that of philosophy and that of history have met in our\r\nday, in the field of law. Who is there that does not remember the great\r\nand noble contest carried on, about the beginning of this century, between\r\ntwo descendants of Frenchmen who had sought a refuge in Germany, and who\r\nunited in their own persons, and in so marvelous a manner, the different\r\naptitudes of the country they owed their origin to, and of the land that\r\ngave them birth,—between Thibaut and Savigny?\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to find a scientific question of a higher character,\r\ndebated by champions more worthy to throw light upon it.\r\n\r\nThe _Code Napoléon_ had appeared. It had, to use Rossi’s happy expression,\r\ntransferred into law the social revolution produced by the destruction of\r\nprivilege. It was the practical formula expressive of the conquests which\r\nhad been made.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy of the eighteenth century had previously inspired the\r\nPrussian Code. And yet, it was on the question of codification that this\r\nmemorable controversy was carried on. The two principal combatants, while\r\nmanfully battling, the one against the other, continued to hold each other\r\nin high esteem, and the profound study of law was developed in the midst\r\nof the _melée_.\r\n\r\nWe cannot delay long on this subject, nor analyze the arguments advanced\r\nby Thibaut(16) and Savigny.(17) What interests us at present is not so\r\nmuch the question debated, as the intellectual movement to which it gave\r\nbirth. Savigny sustained the ancient law, Thibaut attacked it. Numerous\r\nand distinguished jurisconsults ranged themselves on the one side and the\r\nother. A new school grew up which, with the most brilliant success, made\r\nlaw throw light on history and history on law.\r\n\r\nThe application of the historical method to the study of law was\r\nproductive of the most happy results.\r\n\r\nWithout acknowledging it to themselves, the chiefs of the contending\r\nparties were each obeying a political impulse. Savigny was by his birth\r\nand his tastes carried into the camp of conservatism; Thibaut, led by his\r\nconvictions, into the liberal ranks. Nevertheless, the natural elevation\r\nof their genius preserved them from all exaggeration. The glorious\r\ndefender of tradition preserved a liberal spirit, and the ardent advocate\r\nof reform desired no upheaval.\r\n\r\nIn what more nearly concerns the question with which we are now occupied,\r\nSavigny—while he maintained that law was something contingent, human,\r\nnational; and while he brought out into relief the practical and exalted\r\ncharacter of its successive developments which introduced reform and\r\nguarded against revolution—developments which, not confiding in the letter\r\nof the written law, unceasingly feed the living and created law, that law\r\ncalled in the energetic language of a great jurisconsult, a law _écrit es\r\ncoeurs des citoyens_—is far from denying the importance of a high and\r\nhealthy philosophy which directs man in the uninterrupted labor to which\r\nhe is called, in the sphere of jurisprudence.\r\n\r\nMen can no more renounce law than language, the forms of which last they\r\nhave gradually modified in order to better translate their thoughts into\r\nwords. The legislator’s task is the successive elaboration of obligatory\r\nprovisions. He will sometimes oppose and sometimes second the natural\r\nprogress of law; but, in doing so, it will ever be necessary for him to\r\nascend to the nature of things, and grasp their relations, if he would not\r\ngo astray in practice, or lose himself among the successive and partial\r\nchanges to which the illustrious Berlin professor would confine the\r\nlegitimate ambition of legislative power. To go beyond this, in an age\r\nlike ours, seemed to him to be a work of destruction. However, far from\r\ndenying the influence of thought, and therefore of philosophy, acting\r\nwithin its sphere, Savigny invokes its fertile aid.\r\n\r\nThibaut, on the other hand, with more confidence in the powers of the\r\nspirit of modern times, did not believe a good codification to be\r\nimpossible. His starting point had been a cry for national independence.\r\nHe well knew how much veneration was due those institutions which were the\r\nslow and progressive work of national genius, and what was the power they\r\npossessed. He wished, therefore, to reform, not to abolish them. He well\r\nunderstood that the greatness of the _Code Napoléon_ itself, and the\r\nrespect which it inspired were due to the fact that its roots ran deep\r\ninto the soil of the past, even while the modern idea it contained shone\r\nlike a bright light in the world of things. Hence, without contesting the\r\nvalue of history, he refused to acknowledge its right to exclusive\r\nreign.(18)\r\n\r\nThe life and activity prevailing in the study of law, and the brilliant\r\nsuccesses that study has recently achieved, are due, in great part, to the\r\nillustrious representatives of the historical school. We may add, here,\r\nthat the French historical school, which has so worthily inherited the\r\nspirit of Montesquieu, has not achieved less in this direction than the\r\nolder German school. It has reconciled the opposing but not mutually\r\nhostile, tendencies of Savigny and Thibaut. It has conscientiously\r\nscrutinized facts to show their concatenation, and to allow their meaning\r\nand bearing to be clearly grasped. A French jurisconsult, who is at the\r\nsame time our highest authority in the natural law, opened the way by his\r\nexcellent essays on the necessity of reforming the historical studies\r\napplicable to law; on the influence of the legists on French\r\ncivilization(19) etc.; and by his prefaces, equal in value to whole works,\r\non hypothecation, sales, loans, partnership, charter-parties etc. He may\r\ntruly be said to have renewed the ancient and prolific alliance of history\r\nand law.\r\n\r\nInstead of pursuing a pure abstraction, this historical school has\r\nconfined itself to the knowledge of the life of man and the evolution of\r\nsociety. It has applied to law, with what success is well known, the\r\nprinciple which has regenerated the social sciences, philosophy, letters,\r\nhistory, Political Economy,—sciences which are, so to speak, different\r\nprovinces of one intellectual empire, which interpenetrate one another\r\nwithout being confounded one with another, between which no jealous\r\nbarrier should be raised, and between which reciprocity of exchange should\r\nbe encouraged by the suppression of factitious duties, which have existed\r\nonly too long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe need not dwell any longer on the character of the historical method as\r\napplied to law, nor on the services it has already rendered. On this\r\npoint, there can be no two opinions. And, if any one wonders that we\r\nshould speak of it at all, in a work on Political Economy, we can only say\r\nto him, that we have done so to call his attention to an instructive\r\nprecedent, and for the further reason that the same method is peculiarly\r\nwell adapted to the study of Political Economy. Its advantages are the\r\nsame here, its tendencies the same, and the same motives exist to induce\r\nus to use it here. In describing the successive phases of the question in\r\nthe case of law, we have performed an important part of the task we had\r\nimposed upon ourselves, of vindicating the employment of the historical\r\nmethod, in the sphere of Political Economy.\r\n\r\nThe study of history is the best and most powerful antidote against social\r\nromances and ideal fancies. François Beaudouin was right when he said:\r\n“_Cæca sine historia jurisprudentia_;” and we are very sure that, without\r\nhistory as an element in it, Political Economy runs a great risk of\r\nwalking blindfold.\r\n\r\nThe human mind has need of being able to know where it is at any moment,\r\nsurrounded, as it is, by so many roads, running in so many different\r\ndirections. It ought to account to itself for its progress, its deviations\r\nfrom the right path, and for its mistakes.(20) History alone can throw any\r\nlight on questions which are not simply intellectual curiosities, but\r\nwhich, rather, are most deeply concerned with the vital interests of\r\nsociety. It confirms the noble teachings of philosophy, by showing how our\r\nlife is made up of one unchanging tissue of relations, and how man, even\r\nif he may vary their colors, and change their design, cannot renew their\r\ntexture.\r\n\r\nIt teaches us to admire nothing, and to despise nothing, beyond measure.\r\nIt enlightens us concerning questions of a very complicated nature.\r\nWitnessing the evolutions of humanity, following the development of social\r\nfacts and theories, we better discern principles, and grow wary in\r\nrelation to the alchemists of thought, who imagine that society may be\r\nmade to undergo a transformation between the rising and the setting of the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nAs there is a natural law, so, too, there are certain principles of\r\nPolitical Economy which emanate from philosophy, and may be reduced to one\r\nsupreme principle; that of liberty and responsibility. The domain of\r\nPolitical Economy is the _labor_ of generations. But we reject with all\r\nour strength, the materialistic doctrine which, inexplicably confusing\r\nmatters, endeavors to assimilate ideas so distinct as intelligence and\r\nthings; and which would descend so low as to employ the dynamometer to\r\nmeasure the creative force of man and its results, and which sees only\r\nfigures where there is a living soul.\r\n\r\nMan is an intelligent being, served by organs,(21) by _personal_ organs,\r\nwith which the Creator has endowed him, by giving him a body provided with\r\nmarvellous aptitudes, by _external_ organs which he finds in nature\r\nsubjected to his power. Man was created in the image of God, say the\r\nScriptures, and these words contain a deep meaning. He alone, of all\r\nterrestrial beings, possesses a spark of divine intelligence. He alone has\r\nbeen called to pursue the magnificent work of creation, by giving a new\r\nface to a world to which he cannot add so much as an atom.\r\n\r\n_Labor_ is nothing but the action of spirit on itself and on matter.(22)\r\nHence its dignity and grandeur. Hence, also, the difficulties in the way\r\nof economic studies; since, to consider them only as concerned with\r\nquestions of material production, is to forget that the products of\r\nindustry are made for man, not man for industrial products; to ignore the\r\nclose relationship between their fruitful investigations and the whole\r\ncircle of the moral sciences; to debase them and to mutilate them.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment that science concerns itself with man only, and the action\r\nof the mind; from the moment that its end becomes not simply material\r\nenjoyment, but moral elevation, the questions it discusses become indeed\r\nmore complex, but the answer, when found, is more prolific in results.\r\nWealth, then, is treated only as one of the forces of civilization. Other\r\ninterests than purely material ones occupy the first place. This\r\nmatter-of-fact philosophy which, according to Bacon’s precept, seeks to\r\nimprove the conditions of life, bears in mind, that the most fruitful\r\nsource of material development lies in intellectual development. It humbly\r\nrecognizes that it is not the first-born of the family, and draws new\r\nstrength from this avowal. From the moment that it is the mind which\r\n_produces_ and which governs the world, intellectual and moral perfection\r\nbecome the cause and effect of material progress. “But seek ye first the\r\nkingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added\r\nunto you.”\r\n\r\nThe increase of production, then, appears an instrument of elevation in\r\nthe moral order.(23) It is energy of soul, intelligence and manly virtue\r\nwhich constitute the chief source of the wealth of nations; which create\r\nit, develop it, and preserve it. Wealth increases, declines, and\r\ndisappears with the increase, decline and disappearance of these noble\r\nattributes of the soul.\r\n\r\nLabor is the child of thought. Nothing happens in the external world which\r\nwas not first conceived in the mind. The hand is the servant of the\r\nintellect; and its work is successful, beautiful or useful in proportion\r\nto the activity and development of the intellect, and in proportion as the\r\njust, the beautiful and the good exert their power over it.\r\n\r\nProduction is, therefore, not a material, but a spiritual, work. How,\r\nthen, can acts and their morality be separated? How not understand that\r\nthe market of labor has its own distinct laws, and that education, even\r\nfrom a material stand-point, becomes the highest interest and the most\r\nimportant duty of society, since on it depends the efficiency of labor?\r\n\r\nFrom the time that, after a long series of years, the doctrine of\r\nChristianity had permeated the law of the civilized world; from the time\r\nthat the teaching of Paul, that all men are children of one Father, took\r\nform and body, and that the principle of the equality of all men before\r\ntheir Maker, was supplemented by the doctrine and by the practice of that\r\nequality before the laws, the thinking masses have endeavored to discover\r\nthe wherefore of their actions, and the why of their sufferings. They have\r\ncalled the past to account, and inquired why they have obtained so limited\r\na share.\r\n\r\nThe people, therefore, think; and it is, therefore, a matter of importance\r\nthat they should think aright. It is of importance, that they should be\r\nguarded against fallacious Utopian promises. Henceforth, there is no\r\nsecurity for the stability of the world but in the contentment of minds.\r\nThere is no rest for mankind, unless men will understand the conditions of\r\ntheir destiny; unless, instead of running,\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Toujours insatiable et jamais assouvis,”\r\n\r\n\r\nafter the intoxicating cup of material enjoyment—for wants not governed by\r\nthe intellect and the heart are infinite in number, and the gratification\r\nof one gives birth to another—they submit to the law of sacrifice, and\r\ngive play to the noblest faculty with which the Creator has endowed us,\r\nmoral empire over self.\r\n\r\nWe shall meet on this road, hard of ascent, not only peace of soul, but\r\ngoods, more real and more numerous, than those with which the allurements\r\nof error would dazzle our eyes. The greatest obstacles to be overcome are\r\nnot material ones, but moral difficulties. As Franklin says, in substance,\r\nhe that tells you you can succeed, in any way but by labor and economy, is\r\na quack.\r\n\r\nBut labor is more productive in proportion as it is more intelligent, as\r\nhand and mind keep pace with each other, as good moral habits generate\r\norder and voluntary discipline.\r\n\r\nEconomy is sacrifice, binding the present to the future, widening the\r\nhorizon of thought, inspiring foresight, lengthening the lever of human\r\nactivity, by providing it with new instruments.\r\n\r\nLife ceases to be a worry about how the body shall be sustained, and the\r\nmaterial world becomes the shadow of the spiritual. The former is made to\r\nserve the latter, and man’s free effort lifts him into a higher region of\r\nthought, and into a larger field of action. The more mind there is put\r\ninto a piece of work, says Channing, the more it is worth.\r\n\r\nWe, men of to-day, are lookers-on at a marvelous spectacle. Steam furrows\r\nthe earth. Industry has taken an immense start. Mechanical force bends the\r\nmost rebellious materials. Chemistry, physics and the natural sciences are\r\ndiscovering a new world. But whence all this? What is the principle of\r\nthis new life? We answer: intellectual and moral progress. Mind has grown;\r\nthe soul has been expanded. God has permitted man to be free, and\r\nfurnished him with the means to be so.\r\n\r\nThus man, as Mignet has said, becomes that mighty creature to whom God has\r\ngiven the earth for the vast theater of his action, the universe as the\r\ninexhaustible object of his knowledge, the forces of nature for the\r\ngrowing service of his wants, by allowing him, by ever increasing\r\ninformation, to obtain an ever increasing amount of well-being.\r\n\r\nMan is free.—1789 put in action the sublime precept of the gospel. He\r\nholds his destiny in his own hands. But the rights which he enjoys impose\r\nnew duties on him. If _equality_ be the sentiment which predominates in\r\nour day, we should take care not to confound it with the leveling of\r\nCommunism. Nor is it externally to us, but within ourselves, that it\r\nshould be developed, by intellectual and moral culture.\r\n\r\nHistory preserves the student from being led astray by a too servile\r\nadherence to any system. It exposes the folly of the “social contract,”\r\nand of the idyllic dreams of the advantages of savage life. It shows that\r\nnature, instead of being prodigal of her treasures, distributes them with\r\na niggardly hand, and that it is necessary to conquer her by labor,\r\nintelligence and patience before we can control her.\r\n\r\nIt shows us human liberty growing stronger every day, thanks to moral and\r\nintellectual progress, supported by the two powerful props of property,\r\nthe complement of man, the material reflection of his spiritual power; and\r\ncapital, the fruit of abstinence, the symbol of moral power and the result\r\nof enlightened activity.\r\n\r\nHistory walks with a firm step, because it feels secure in a knowledge of\r\nthe laws of human nature, and in its experience of the successive\r\nmanifestations of social life. Instead of the vagueness of ideal\r\nconceptions, it allows us to grasp and to appreciate what is real in life.\r\nIt does not confine itself to the study of man. It makes us acquainted\r\nwith _men_, whose wants extend and are ennobled in proportion to the\r\nperfection of their faculties. The feelings and the intellect are\r\nsimultaneously developed in man. The savage is the most egotistical of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nHence, we believe that Political Economy cannot dispense with the services\r\nof morals and philosophy, of history and law; for these are branches of\r\none common trunk, through all of which the self-same sap circulates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe isolation of the theory of Political Economy is peculiar to our own\r\nday. In more remote times, we find this study confounded with the other\r\nmoral sciences, of which it was an integral part. When the genius of Adam\r\nSmith gave it a distinct character, he did not desire to separate it from\r\nthose branches of knowledge without which it could only remain a bleached\r\nplant from the absence of the sunlight of ethics.\r\n\r\nWe must renounce the singular idea,(24) that thousands of years could pass\r\naway without leaving any trace of what enlightened men had thought and\r\nelaborated in the matter of Political Economy, among so many nations, and\r\nthat people should never have thought of cultivating this rich\r\nintellectual domain, while in every other direction, it is easy for us to\r\nascend by a road already cleared up to the most remote antiquity.\r\n\r\nIt has already been acknowledged, that the _classic domain_, fertilized by\r\nintellectual culture on a large scale and on a small one, was exceedingly\r\nrich in valuable indications, although they do not present themselves\r\nunder the distinct form, which later affected the different branches of\r\npublic life.\r\n\r\nAs to the pretended _primitive simplicity_ of the middle ages, which it is\r\nclaimed, prevailed during that period, a species of economic vegetation,\r\nthose who maintain it forget the long series of communistic theories\r\nwhich, at near intervals, found expression in many a bloody struggle, and\r\nwhose repression required the combined efforts of Church and State.\r\n\r\nDoubtless, it is not in their modern forms that the elements of\r\npolitico-economical science are to be found, in the past. But when we\r\nsucceed in reuniting the scattered and broken parts; when we have made our\r\nway into the customs, decrees, ordinances, capitularies, laws and\r\nregulations of those times; when, so to speak, we come, unaware, upon the\r\nlife of nations, in the most ingenuous and confidential documents which\r\nreflect it most faithfully because most simply, we may well be astonished\r\nat the results obtained. Where we expected, perhaps, to find only\r\nerudition, we reap a rich harvest of lessons which are all the more\r\nvaluable for being disinterested.\r\n\r\nLegislative and administrative acts frequently develop real economic\r\ndoctrines. It is easy to discover in them the onward course of a theory\r\nwhich plunges directly into practical applications.\r\n\r\nWhat results might we not expect from these efforts, if the genius of\r\ninvestigation and of divination, which has so elevated historical studies\r\nin our day, should have an observing and penetrating eye in this\r\ndirection! How limited was the field on which Guérard erected the\r\nscientific monument which he has left us in his _Polyptique d’Irminon_;\r\nand how precious are the lessons he leaves us, since we have here to do,\r\nnot with the history of professed doctrines or unlooked-for events, but\r\nwith the historical development of economic society which shows us the\r\nliving march of principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nPolitical Economy is not, as we have just said, a new science. It has been\r\na distinct science only a short time. Until the eighteenth century, it was\r\nconfounded with philosophy, morals, politics, law and history. But it does\r\nnot follow, that, because it has grown so in importance, as to deserve a\r\nplace of its own, its intimate relationship with the noble studies which\r\nhad until then absorbed it should cease. There is another consequence also\r\nto be deduced from this. From the moment that Political Economy ceases to\r\nbe considered a new science, it finds a long series of ancestors behind\r\nit, since it is compelled to investigate a past to which so many bonds\r\nunite it. This duty may increase its difficulties, but, at the same time,\r\nit singularly adds to the attractions of a study which, instead of\r\npresenting us only with the arid deductions of dogmatism, comes to us with\r\nall the freshness and all the color of life.\r\n\r\nWe may allow those who make Political Economy simply a piece of arithmetic\r\nto ignore these retrospective studies and their importance; for\r\nmathematics has little to do with history. But it is otherwise with the\r\nlife of nations. These would discover whence they come, in order to learn\r\nwhither they are tending.\r\n\r\nThey are not obeying a vain interest of curiosity, as J. B. Say supposed,\r\nwhen, in sketching a short history of the progress of Political Economy,\r\nhe said: “However, every kind of history has a right to gratify\r\ncuriosity.” It is a thing to be regretted, that this eminent thinker could\r\nthus ignore one of the essential elements of the science to which he\r\nrendered such great and unquestioned services. A sense for the historical\r\nwas wanting in him. “The history of a science,” he writes,(25) “is not\r\nlike the narration of things that have happened. What would it profit us\r\nto make a collection of absurd opinions, of decried doctrines which\r\ndeserved to be decried? It would be at once useless and fastidious to thus\r\nexhume them in case we perfectly knew the public economy of social bodies.\r\nIt can be of little concern to us to learn what our predecessors have\r\ndreamed about this subject, and to describe the long series of mistakes in\r\npractice which have retarded man’s progress in the research after truth.\r\nError is a thing to be forgotten, not learned.” As if that which was once\r\nto be found in time is not to-day to be found in space; as if there ever\r\nwas an institution that did not have its _raison d’ etre_ and had not\r\nconstituted a resting place in the search after a higher truth or of a\r\nmore intelligent and salutary application of an old one! There are a great\r\nmany actual systems and a great many present facts which can be understood\r\nonly by the help of history; and how frequently would not an acquaintance\r\nwith history serve to keep us from taking for marvelous inventions the\r\nantiquated machinery of other ages, whose only advantage and only merit\r\nare that they have remained unknown. How much of the pretended daring of\r\ninnovators has been old trumpery which the wisdom of the times had cast\r\noff as rubbish. Besides, as Bacon has said: “Verumtamen sæpe necessarium\r\nest, quod non est optimum.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not the result of mere chance that the greatest economists have been\r\nboth historians and philosophers. We need only mention Adam Smith, Turgot,\r\nMalthus, Sismondi, Droz, Rossi and Léon Faucher. It is too frequently\r\nforgotten that the father of modern Political Economy, Adam Smith, looked\r\nupon the science as only one part of the course of moral philosophy which\r\nhe taught at Glasgow, and which embraced four divisions:\r\n\r\n1. _Universal theology._—The existence and attributes of God; principles\r\nor faculties of the human mind, the basis of religion.\r\n\r\n2. _Ethics._—Theory of the moral sentiments.\r\n\r\n3. _Moral principles relating to justice._—In this, as we learn from one\r\nof Adam Smith’s pupils in a sketch preserved by David Stewart, he followed\r\na plan which seems to have been suggested to him by Montesquieu. He\r\nendeavored to trace the successive advances of jurisprudence from the most\r\nbarbarous times to the most polished. He carefully showed how the arts\r\nwhich minister to subsistence, and to the accumulation of property, act on\r\nlaws and governments, and are productive of advances and changes in them\r\nanalogous to those they experience themselves.\r\n\r\nIn the first part of his course, as we learn from the same authority, he\r\nexamined the various political regulations not founded on the principle of\r\njustice but in expediency, the object of which is to increase the wealth,\r\nthe power and the prosperity of the state. From this point of view, he\r\nconsidered the political institutions relating to commerce, finance, the\r\necclesiastical and military establishments. His lectures on the different\r\nsubjects constitute the substance of the work he afterwards published on\r\nthe wealth of nations. A pupil of Hutcheson, Adam Smith always applied the\r\nexperimental method, “which, instead of losing itself in magnificent and\r\nhazardous speculations, attaches itself to certain and universal facts\r\ndiscovered to us by our own consciousness, by language, literature,\r\nhistory and society.”(26) Before taking the professorship of philosophy,\r\nAdam Smith had taught belleslettres and rhetoric in Edinburgh, in 1748. He\r\nhad written a work on the origin and formation of languages; and it was\r\nbecause he had profoundly studied the moral sciences that it was given to\r\nhim to inaugurate a new science and to become a great economist. Mr.\r\nCousin has laid great stress on Adam Smith’s taste and talent for history.\r\n“Whatever the subject he treats, he turns his eyes backward over the road\r\ntraversed before himself, and he illuminates every object on his path by\r\nthe aid of the torch which reflection has placed in his hand. Thus, in\r\nPolitical Economy, his principles not only prepare the future but renew\r\nthe past, and discover the reason, heretofore unknown, of ancient facts\r\nwhich history had gathered together without understanding them. It is not\r\nsaying enough to remark that Adam Smith possessed a great variety of\r\nhistorical information; we must add that he possessed the real historical\r\nspirit.” Thanks to this eminent faculty of his, the Glasgow philosopher\r\nacquired great influence over minds. In 1810, when the French empire had\r\nreached the zenith of its greatness, Marwitz wrote: “There is a monarch as\r\npowerful as Napoleon: Adam Smith.” We need not recall Turgot’s historical\r\nresearches.\r\n\r\nMalthus’ chief title to distinction, his work on Population, is as much a\r\nhistorical work as a politico-economical one; and it is not sufficiently\r\nknown that he was professor of history and Political Economy in the\r\ncollege of the East India Company at Aylesbury.\r\n\r\nWe need say no more on this subject. The works of the other writers whom\r\nwe have mentioned are too well known to permit any one to think that they\r\nexcluded history and moral science from the study of Political Economy.\r\nHence the school which has risen up in Germany,(27) and which is\r\nendeavoring to do for Political Economy what Savigny, Eichhorn, Schrader,\r\nMommsen, Rudorff, and so many other illustrious scholars have done for\r\njurisprudence, cannot be rightly accused of rashness. It has done nothing\r\nbut unfurl the noble banner borne by the most venerated masters of the\r\nscience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the head of this school stands William Roscher, professor of Political\r\nEconomy at the University of Leipzig, whose excellent work, The Principles\r\nof Political Economy, in which he follows _the historical method_, we have\r\njust translated. William Roscher is (1857) scarcely forty years of age. He\r\nwas born at Hanover, October 21, 1817. His laborious and simple life is\r\nthat of a worthy representative of the science. “You ask me,” he wrote us\r\nrecently, “to give you some information concerning the incidents of my\r\nlife. I have, thank God, but very little to tell you. Lives whose history\r\nit is interesting to relate are seldom happy lives.” He confined himself\r\nto giving us a few dates which are, so to say, the landmarks of a career\r\nfull of usefulness. Roscher, from 1835 to 1839, studied jurisprudence and\r\nphilology at the universities of Göttingen and Berlin. The learned\r\nteachers who exercised the greatest influence on his intellectual\r\ndevelopment were the historians Gervinus and Ranke, the philologist K. O.\r\nMüller and the Germanist Albrecht. It is easy to see that he went to a\r\ngood school, and that he profited by it. He was made doctor in 1838;\r\nadmitted in 1840 as _Privat-docent_ at Göttingen; appointed in 1843\r\nprofessor extraordinary at the same university, and called in 1844 to fill\r\nthe chair of titular professor at Erlangen. Since 1848 he has acted in the\r\nsame capacity in the University of Leipzig, where he was for six years\r\nmember of the Poor Board, where he teaches also in the agricultural\r\ncollege. His fame has grown rapidly. Many of the German universities have\r\nemulated one another for the honor of possessing him, but he has not been\r\nwilling to leave Leipzig. His first remarkable work was his doctor’s\r\nthesis: _De historicæ doctrinæ apud sophistas majores vestigiis_, written\r\nin 1838. In 1842, he published his excellent work, which has since become\r\nclassical: “The Life, Labors and age of Thucydides.”(28) From that time,\r\nimportant works, all bearing the stamp of varied and profound scientific\r\nacquirements, and of an erudition remarkable for sagacity and elegance,\r\nhave followed one another without interruption. In 1843, he treated the\r\nquestion of luxury(29) with a master hand, and laid the foundation of his\r\ngreat work—only the first part of which has thus far appeared—at the same\r\ntime tracing on a large scale the programme of a course of Political\r\nEconomy according to the historical method.(30) In 1844, he published his\r\nhistorical study on Socialism and Communism,(31) and in 1845 and 1846, his\r\nideas on the politics and the statistics of systems of agriculture. He is,\r\nbesides, author of an excellent work on the corn-trade;(32) of a\r\nremarkable book on the colonial system;(33) of a sketch on the three forms\r\nof the state;(34) of a memoir on the relations between Political Economy\r\nand classical antiquity;(35) of a work of the greatest interest, on the\r\nhistory of economic doctrines in England in the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies—a work full of the most curious researches;(36) of a book on the\r\neconomic principle of forest economy,(37) and lastly, of the great work,\r\nthe first part of which we have translated, under the title of The\r\nPrinciples of Political Economy, and which is to be completed by the\r\nsuccessive publication of three other volumes, on the Political Economy of\r\nAgriculture, and the related branches of primitive production, the\r\nPolitical Economy of Industry and Commerce, and one on the Political\r\nEconomy of the State and the Commune. This work, when completed, will be a\r\nreal cyclopedia of the science.(38)\r\n\r\nSide by side with William Roscher, we must mention a young economist,\r\nKnies, formerly professor at the University of Marburg, but whom political\r\npersecution compelled to accept a secondary position at the gymnasium of\r\nSchaffhausen, for a time, and who fills, to-day, in the University of\r\nFreiburg, in Breisgau, a position more worthy of his great talent. We\r\nhope, in a work which we intend to publish, on Political Economy in\r\nGermany, to make the public acquainted with the works of this writer. They\r\ndeserve to attract the most serious attention. We know of few works which\r\nequal his Political Economy, written on the historical method.(39) We\r\nshall also have something to say of another economist, formerly professor\r\nat Marburg, a victim, also, of the power of the elector of Hesse,\r\nHildebrand, now professor at the University of Zurich. His\r\nNational-Œkonomie(40) is a book replete with interest, and we have nowhere\r\nmet with a better criticism of Proudhon’s system, than in its pages. If\r\nthe new school had produced but these three men, it would still have left\r\nits impress on the history of the science.\r\n\r\nOther works, no less important, will claim our attention in the book to\r\nwhich we have already devoted many years of labor. If we carry out our\r\nintention, we shall review the works of a great many scholars, of great\r\nmerit, whose names only are, unfortunately, known outside of Germany. The\r\nworks of Rau, of Hermann, of Robert Mohl, of Hannsen, Helferich, Schütz,\r\nKosegarten, Wirth etc., are a rich mine, from which we hope to draw much\r\nvaluable information. Nor shall we neglect the original productions of J.\r\nMoser, the Franklin of Germany, nor the quaint, but sometimes striking,\r\nideas of Adam Müller. Lastly, our learned friend, Professor Stein of\r\nVienna, will afford us an opportunity to show forth the merit of important\r\nand extensive works, animated by the philosophic spirit. For the present,\r\nwe must confine ourselves to a view of the application of the historical\r\nmethod to Political Economy.\r\n\r\nThere is a rather widespread prejudice existing against this order of\r\nworks, a souvenir of the struggle carried on formerly, between Thibaut and\r\nSavigny, which inclines people to suppose that the historical school leans\r\ntowards the political doctrines of the past, and that it is hostile to the\r\nliberal spirit of modern times. Nothing can be farther from the truth. The\r\nnames of Roscher, Knies and Hildebrand are sufficient to remove this\r\nprejudice. Their works, inspired by an enlightened love for progress, do\r\nnot allow of such a misconstruction. The historical point of view does not\r\nconsist in the worship of the past, any more than in the depreciation of\r\nthe present. It does not view the succession of phenomena as a fluctuation\r\nof events without unity or purpose. On the contrary, the historical method\r\nharmonizes wonderfully well with the wants of genuine progress. The\r\nchanges accomplished bear testimony to the free and creative power of man,\r\nacting within the limit permitted to it by the degrees of intelligence\r\nreached, of the development of morals, and of individual liberty. The\r\nphilosophy of Political Economy, which is the result of this calm\r\nteaching, free from the passions of party—for science acknowledges no\r\nadherence to party—is like that of law, opposed to the, more or less,\r\ningenious or rash dreams, which build the world over again in thought. In\r\nshowing how, at all times, humanity has understood and applied the\r\nprinciples which govern the production of wealth, it may say, with the\r\nRoman jurisconsult: “Justitiam namque colimus ... æquum ab iniquo\r\nseparantes ... veram nisi fallor philosophiam, non simulatam affectantes.”\r\n“The human mind,” says Rossi, “endeavoring to attain to a knowledge of\r\nitself, estimating its strength, taking a method, and applying it with a\r\nconsciousness of its mode of procedure to the knowledge of all things;\r\nsuch is philosophy. Without it, there is no science in any branch of human\r\nknowledge.” Thus do we rise, with the aid of a critical mind, by careful\r\ninvestigation and great sagacity, to the truths founded on observations\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is another method, which, starting out from principles, evident of\r\nthemselves, develops science by way of conclusions drawn, after the manner\r\nof the geometricians. The apparent severity and simplicity of this method\r\nare very seductive, and very dangerous, when we have to deal not with\r\nfigures, but with men; when the varied, complex and delicate exigencies\r\nwhich accumulate when human nature comes into play do not exactly square\r\nwith the formula; and, when instead of dealing with abstractions, we have\r\nto tackle realities. One of our venerated teachers, the illustrious Rossi,\r\nthought he might remove the difficulty by drawing a distinction between\r\n_pure_ Political Economy and _applied_ Political Economy. It is not\r\nwithout a certain amount of hesitation that we dare differ with so high an\r\nauthority; but confess we must, this distinction is far from satisfying\r\nus. The doubt it has left in our mind has been the principal cause which\r\nhas inclined us to the historical method. “Rational Political Economy,”\r\nsays Rossi, “is the science which investigates the nature, the causes and\r\nthe movement of wealth, by basing itself on the general and constant facts\r\nof human nature, and of the external world. In applied Political Economy,\r\nthe science is taken as the mean. Account is taken of external facts.\r\nNationality, time and place play an important part.”\r\n\r\nLet us for a moment accept these definitions; what is the consequence?\r\nThat there are two sciences, the one of which, purely speculative, has\r\nmore to do with philosophy than with the permanent conflicts which agitate\r\nthe world; the other of which could not alone furnish us with rules in\r\npractice, nor with a formulary for the measures to be taken in a given\r\ncase, since such a pretension would be both vain and ridiculous, but which\r\nwould inform the practical judgment of men charged with the solution of\r\nthe numberless difficult and complicated questions which come up every\r\nday. If pure science refuses to interfere in the affairs of this world;\r\nif, as the learned originator of the doctrine we are just now considering\r\ngives us to understand, it would compromise the solution of questions by\r\nthe intoxication of logic, and the ambition of perfect system; if,\r\nconsequently, it is to be worshipped like a motionless and inactive\r\ndivinity, how could this platonic satisfaction suffice us? Would not the\r\nopponents of economic doctrines be disposed to acknowledge all the\r\nprinciples, provided the consequences to be drawn from them were left to\r\nthemselves; and would they not come to us, bristling with arguments drawn\r\nfrom the circumstances of nationality, time and space, to refute the\r\npossibility of applying pure science?\r\n\r\n\r\n    On ne vaincra jamais les Romains que dans Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis, therefore, is the ground we must explore. We must develop applied\r\nPolitical Economy which takes cognizance of external circumstances. To do\r\nthis, no one will question that the best and most decisive of methods is\r\nthe historical, which concerns itself with time, space and nationality,\r\nand which leads to proper reformation where reformation is wanted.\r\n\r\nMoreover, principles will be no less firmly established by historical\r\ninduction than by dogmatic deduction, and, moreover, science will be\r\ninseparable from art. We are not of those who deny principles, or who\r\nchallenge them. What we desire is, that they should not be worshiped as\r\nfetiches, but that they should enter into the very life-blood of nations.\r\n\r\nFurther: the abstract deductions of pure science do not leave us without\r\ndisquietude, since they treat man much more like a material than like a\r\nmoral force. Under the vigorous procedure of speculative mathematics, man\r\nbecomes a constant quantity for all times and all countries, whereas he\r\nis, in reality, a variable quantity. All the elements put in play are\r\nideal entities, the reverse of which we find in poetry, where\r\n\r\n\r\n    Tout prend un corps, une ame, un esprit, un visage!\r\n\r\n\r\nand where everything loses the character of life, and is transformed into\r\ninanimate units. Man is something different from the sum of the services\r\nhe may be made to render, and from the sum of enjoyments which may be\r\nprocured for him. We must not run the risk of lowering him to the level of\r\na living tool; and from the moment that we are required to take his moral\r\ndestiny into account, what becomes of abstract calculation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have been wrong, says Rossi, in reproaching Quesnay for his famous\r\n_laissez faire, laissez passer_, which is pure science. We, also, are of\r\nopinion that the reproach was ill founded, for it proceeded from a wrong\r\nconception of the principle itself. But it seems to us that, far from\r\ncondemning this doctrine in its serious application, the historical method\r\nmay serve to explain and to justify it. Employing less of rigidity and\r\ndryness in form, it reaches consequences more in harmony with social life.\r\nBut it is not to be imagined that we do not meet in this way with many\r\nancient and glorious precedents. The great principles of industrial\r\nliberty, as well as those of commercial liberty, originated in France.\r\nForbonnais was right when he said: “We may congratulate ourselves on being\r\nable to find, in our old books and ancient ordinances, wherewith to\r\nvindicate for ourselves the right to that light which we generally\r\nsupposed to have been revealed to the English and Dutch before us.” The\r\nfurther Forbonnais carried his researches into our annals, the greater the\r\nnumber of traces of opposition to the prejudices in favor of exclusion and\r\nmonopoly, so long made principles of administrative policy, did he\r\nfind.(41)\r\n\r\nThe famous axiom, _laissez faire_, and _laissez passer_, the subversive\r\ntendencies of which people affect to condemn, was not invented by Quesnay.\r\nHe only gave a scientific bearing to what was the inspiration of a\r\nmerchant called Legendre. The latter, consulted by Colbert on the best\r\nmeans of protecting commerce, dropped these words which have since become\r\nso celebrated.\r\n\r\nWe must not lose sight of their real meaning, nor misunderstand the\r\nintention which dictated them. What Quesnay said was this: “Let everything\r\nalone which is injurious, neither to good morals, nor to liberty, nor to\r\nproperty, nor to personal security. Allow everything to be sold which has\r\nbeen produced without crime.” And he added: “Only freedom judges aright;\r\nonly competition never sells too dear, and always pays a reasonable and\r\nlegitimate price.” Far from being the absence of rule, liberty is the rule\r\nitself. To _laisser faire_ the good is to prevent evil.(42)\r\n\r\nThere is need of institutions to complete the exercise of the independence\r\nacquired by labor, and of laws to regulate that exercise. The _laisser\r\nfaire_ and _laisser passer_ of economists is, in no way, like the absolute\r\nformula, which some have denounced and others sought to utilize, as\r\nrelieving authority of all care and all intervention.\r\n\r\nTo understand this maxim aright, we must go back to the oppressive regime\r\nof ancient society. Quesnay’s formula was, first of all, a protest against\r\nthe restraints which hampered the free development of labor. But it did\r\nnot tend to abrogate the office of legislator, nor to deprive society or\r\nthe individual of the support of the public power which watches over the\r\nfulfillment of our destiny.\r\n\r\nIt may have seemed convenient to find in the gravity of a\r\npolitico-economical principle, an excuse for the sweets of legislative and\r\nadministrative _far niente_, but it is generally conceded that the role of\r\nauthority has grown, rather than diminished, under the regime of the\r\nliberty of labor. The task is, in our days, a hard one, both for\r\nindividuals and nations; for liberty dispenses its favors only to the\r\nmasculine virtues of a laborious and an enlightened people.\r\n\r\nLiberty is not license. It refuses to bend under the yoke, but it submits\r\nto rule. The mission of authority is not to constrain, but to counsel; not\r\nto command, but to help accomplish; not to absorb individual activity, but\r\nto develop it. It does not pretend to raise a convenient indifference on\r\nthe part of government, nor the indolent withdrawal of all protective\r\ninfluence to the dignity of a principle. To say, on the other hand, that\r\nthe _laisser faire_ and _laisser passer_ of the economists means: Let\r\nrobbery alone; let fraud alone etc., is to amuse one’s self playing upon\r\nwords, and to argue in a manner unworthy of any serious answer. Under\r\npretext of painting a picture of economic doctrine, we are given its\r\ncaricature. Such has never been the system, to the elaboration of which\r\nthe purest hearts and noblest intellects have devoted themselves. A\r\nnegation does not constitute the science of Political Economy.\r\n\r\nIt is very convenient to inclose humanity within a circle of action, drawn\r\nwith rigorous precision, and to govern movements seen in advance. But such\r\nartificial conceptions mutilate the activity of man. To guarantee man all\r\nliberty, and prevent its abuse—such are the data of the problem. The work\r\nis a great and difficult one. Far from yielding in point of elevation to\r\nideal systems, it is superior to them in extent and variety of\r\ncombinations. Those who ignore its bearing, yield, it may be, to a certain\r\nindolence of intellect. Restrained within its natural limits, the famous\r\n_laisser faire_ and _laisser passer_ of the Physiocrates deserves even\r\nto-day our respect and our confidence. It ought to be preserved in the\r\ngrateful memory of men, side by side with the maxim which Quesnay\r\nsucceeded in having printed at Versailles, by the hand of Louis XV\r\nhimself: “Pauvres paysans, pauvre royaume; pauvre royaume, pauvre\r\nsouverain.”(43)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo return to the question of method. Rossi made use of an ingenious\r\nexample to explain his thought:(44) “Are,” he inquires, “these deductions\r\n[of pure science] perfectly legitimate; are these consequences always\r\ntrue? It is incontestably true that a projectile, discharged at a certain\r\nangle, will describe a certain curve; this is a mathematical truth. It is\r\nequally true, that the resistance offered to the projectile by the medium\r\nthrough which it moves modifies the speculative result in practice, to\r\nsome extent; this is a truth of observation. Is the mathematical deduction\r\nfalse? By no means; but it supposes a vacuum. I hasten to acknowledge it.\r\nSpeculative economy also neglects certain facts and leaves certain\r\nresistances out of account.” Now, from the moment that we have to deal\r\nwith human interests, it is not possible to suppose a vacuum, to neglect\r\nthe most vulgar facts, and the most common instances of resistance, nor to\r\nlose one’s self in abstraction. The correctives of applied Political\r\nEconomy either may not wipe out this original sin, or else they run great\r\ndanger of covering up the principles themselves. In ballistics, again, we\r\nmay measure the resistance which the medium in which we are obliged to\r\noperate, makes the force of impulsion and the target both obey the same\r\nlaw, and yield to the same process of calculation. But is it thus when you\r\ntouch upon man’s innermost and most sensitive part? Is there not danger\r\nthat the hypotheses may be deceitful, and that you may be accused of\r\ntoiling in a vacuum? We well know the solid reason that may be opposed to\r\nsarcasm of this nature; but is it expedient to lay one’s self open to it?\r\n\r\nMoreover, the consequences are not great enough to warrant us to expose\r\nourselves to the danger. The principles of pure science are very small in\r\nnumber. They might even, be easily reduced to one, of which M. Cousin has\r\nbeen the eloquent interpreter—human liberty. This liberty has no need of\r\nPolitical Economy to shine with the luster of evidence; nothing can\r\nprevail against it. We can prove that it is as fecund as it is\r\nrespectable; but if the science of wealth should endeavor to demonstrate\r\nthe contrary, the primordial bases of society, liberty, property and the\r\nfamily would not be less sacred nor less necessary, for they are the right\r\nof humanity. They could not be put aside, even under pretext of any\r\nmechanism which would claim to produce more.(45) These sovereign\r\nprinciples of economy flow from the moral law, and they have no reason to\r\ndread the power of facts, for the prosperity of nations depends on the\r\nrespect with which they are surrounded and the guarantees by which they\r\nare protected.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of the moral law; and, indeed, in our opinion, it is\r\nimpossible to banish it from the domain of public economy. Any other point\r\nof view seems to us too narrow. And when we see eminent men go astray in\r\nthe pursuit of an ideal which fails to take the human soul into account,\r\nand which finds nothing but equations where there are feelings and ideas,\r\nwe cannot help thinking that they are unfaithful to the thought of the\r\nfounder of the science, Adam Smith. Man is not simply a piece of\r\nmachinery. He does not blindly submit to external impulse. Rather is he\r\nhimself, the greatest of impulses. But to govern things, he must first\r\nlearn to conquer himself. Personal interest is the powerful motive which\r\nhe obeys. Man does not live alone, in a state of isolation, in the world.\r\n_Væ soli!_ He lives in society and profits by the relations which he forms\r\nwith other beings, intelligent like himself, and for whom he has a natural\r\nfeeling of sympathy.\r\n\r\nThe good that comes to them yields satisfaction to him, and the evil that\r\nbefalls them falls on him likewise. He cannot turn back entirely upon his\r\nown personality. Besides his own interest, he feels and shares another\r\ninterest—the interest of all. Personal interest is perfectly legitimate.\r\nThe love of self cannot be condemned. The Savior himself has enjoined us\r\nto love our neighbor as ourselves. To love him more than ourselves is a\r\nvery high and beautiful virtue. It is the self-abnegation which inspired\r\nChristian heroes. But heroism is rare, and cannot be imposed, nor taken,\r\nas a rule. Personal interest is a powerful stimulant, and the superior\r\nharmony of social relations makes it contribute to the general good.\r\n\r\nWhat must be condemned is a fatal deviation of this sentiment which\r\ndestroys its effect and narrows its actions. What we need to prevent is\r\nthe degeneration of personal interest into an egotism which parches,\r\ninstead of fertilizing, and which compromises the future by the exclusive\r\nsearch after present advantage; for egotism is short-sighted. On the other\r\nhand, the broader and more generous feeling which inclines us to\r\nsympathize with our fellow beings in their sorrows, and to unite our\r\ndestiny to theirs; that is, the feeling of the general interest, has a\r\nlimit too.\r\n\r\nIt would be falsified if it absorbed the individual; if it destroyed the\r\nmost powerful motive-force by drying up the abundant source of activity;\r\nif it attacked moral energy by enervating responsibility; if it extended\r\nthe circle of results obtained to such an extent that scarcely any one\r\nshould feel the rebound.\r\n\r\nThe evil produced by egotism, that sad travesty of personal interest,\r\nappears under a form quite as formidable when the general interest takes\r\nthe form of communism. The coöperation of personal interest and of the\r\ngeneral interest is always necessary, both for individual profit and\r\nsocial advantage. There is as much danger in annihilating the individual\r\nas in exalting him. History furnishes us with memorable examples of this.\r\nIt does not allow us to go astray in the narrow ways of a peevish and\r\njealous personality, nor to lose ourselves in the vague labyrinth of a\r\nchimerical and false communism. The latter would destroy what constitutes\r\nthe power and dignity of man. It would wipe out the most prominent\r\nfeatures of his noble nature, by destroying the support of energy and\r\nactivity and the food of moral force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, we are told, Political Economy is only the science of selfishness;\r\nAdam Smith is the prophet of individualism; grow rich _per fas et nefas_\r\nis its ultimate teaching. Such a judgment is evidence of much levity and\r\nlittle enlightenment. How could the man who conceived the study of human\r\ninterests on so large a scale, the philosopher who acknowledged Hutcheson\r\nas his master and gave his ideas a still more expansive character, be the\r\napostle of egotism; and how can the science which he founded be its\r\ngospel? There is here an error of fact and a defect of appreciation.\r\nHutcheson had based moral philosophy on the feeling which, according to\r\nhim, engendered all the other virtues, on benevolence, which is\r\ndisinterested, busied with the welfare of others, with the public weal and\r\nthe general interest. Adam Smith went further, and sought to base it on a\r\nstill more energetic feeling, on sympathy.\r\n\r\nThe first sentence of his Theory of the Moral Sentiments, which is a full\r\nresumé of his theory, is as follows: “How selfish soever man may be\r\nsupposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature which interest\r\nhim in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him,\r\nthough he derives nothing from it, except the pleasure of seeing it.” And\r\nthis is no empty declaration on his part. It is the thought which of all\r\nin his book is nearest to his heart; and hence he energetically assails\r\nthose philosophers who look upon self-love and the refinements of\r\nself-love as the universal cause of all our sentiments, and seek to\r\nexplain sympathy by self-love.\r\n\r\nLa Rochefoucauld, Mandeville and Helvetius never met with a more\r\ndetermined or energetic adversary. Nowhere have the sweet and amiable\r\nvirtues, such as ingenuous condescension, indulgent humanity, and the\r\nrespectable and severe virtues, such as disinterestedness and self-control\r\nwhich subject our movements to the requirements of the dignity of our\r\nnature, been better understood or interpreted. Adam Smith is the\r\nphilosopher of sympathy.(46) His theory triumphs over the cowardly and\r\nshameful egotism which concentrates the moral life of the individual in\r\nhimself, and separates it from the life of the human race of the _outré_\r\nstoicism which refuses the aid of sentiment to reason.(47) According to\r\nhim, the law of private morals is sympathy; the law of natural\r\njurisprudence, justice; the law of the production of wealth, free labor.\r\nBut while he defended this principle with energy, he did not become guilty\r\nof a real recantation by worshiping the idol he had just overthrown. He\r\nwould have been culpable of the strangest of all contradictions if he had\r\nmade the vice which he had just lacerated the very pivot of another part\r\nof his teaching.\r\n\r\nWe regret that this essay, which has already very much exceeded the limits\r\nwe assigned it in the beginning, will not permit us to reproduce here\r\nKnies’ beautiful demonstration, in which he so learnedly and eloquently\r\nvindicates Adam Smith from this strange imputation, thereby placing\r\nPolitical Economy on its true basis, the basis of morals, by removing in a\r\ndecisive way, all pretext of error and all means of subterfuge. This part\r\nis one of the best features in his most excellent work on “Political\r\nEconomy, from the historical Point of View.” We shall return to this\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is there that political economists have not been charged with? They\r\nhave been accused, above all, of a cold heartedness and cruelty, and the\r\nsentence passed on them has been resumed in these words: “Political\r\nEconomy has no bowels!” Indeed, the representative of the science, who has\r\nbeen most attacked and who has been held up as a picture of impassible\r\ninsensibility; on whom have been heaped the most bloody outrages, is\r\nMalthus. Let us hear him. He tells us in his work on Political Economy,\r\nthat if a country had no other means to grow rich, except by seeking for\r\nsuccess in the struggle with other countries, at the cost of a reduction\r\nof the wages of labor, he would unhesitatingly say: Away with such riches;\r\nthat it is much to be desired that the working classes should be well\r\nremunerated, and this for a reason much more important than all the\r\nconsiderations relating to wealth; that is, the happiness of the great\r\nmass of society. And he goes on to say, that he knows nothing more\r\ndetestable than the idea of knowingly condemning the laboring classes to\r\ncover themselves with rags, to lodge in wretched huts, to enable us to\r\nsell a few more stuffs and calicoes to foreign countries. Certain it is,\r\nthat no defender, however determined, of the laboring classes, has said\r\nanything stronger or more deeply felt. The reason is, that nothing was\r\nmore foreign to Malthus’ ideas than the systematic rigidity of\r\nmathematical theories of wealth; that, a minister of the Gospel, he had\r\nmeditated on its high precepts. His whole doctrine is based on the moral\r\nidea. “He was profoundly convinced that there are principles in Political\r\nEconomy which are true only in as far as they are restricted within\r\ncertain limits. He saw the principal difficulty of the science in the\r\nfrequent combination of complicated causes, in the action and reaction of\r\ncauses on one another, and in the necessity of setting limits or making\r\nexceptions to a great number of important propositions.” Here we are ever\r\nbrought back to the undulating ground of living science, instead of having\r\nto follow the rectilineal way traced out by the dead letter. We are always\r\ndriven back, whatever may be pretended to the contrary, to the realities\r\nof which history alone possesses the secret. The idea of wealth cannot\r\nabsorb everything when there is question of judging and enlightening men.\r\nTo do this, it is necessary to know the various phases of social\r\nhousekeeping, what nations have thought of economic interests which have\r\nnever ceased to interest them greatly, what they have attempted and what\r\nthey have attained.\r\n\r\nHence, we must turn over the leaves of the book of the past, and study its\r\neconomic aspect, as we have studied its political and literary aspect. We\r\nmust follow living nations through their divers periods of development,\r\nand fathom the causes of the destruction of those that are dead. When we\r\nare dealing with the comparative study of the economic destinies of\r\nnations, our investigations are limited to a small number of individual\r\nnations—a further reason not to omit any, and above all, to scrutinize, as\r\nan anatomist would with his scalpel, the principle of life of those which\r\nare no more. We may, by accounting to ourselves for the immense variety of\r\nphenomena which are brought to light by the _application_ of principles to\r\nfacts, and in which nothing is absolute or permanent, in which, on the\r\ncontrary, everything is relative and successive, acquire that sureness of\r\ntouch and correctness of vision which are among the most valuable\r\nconquests of science.\r\n\r\nIt would be a mistake to suppose that theory simplifies practical\r\nsolutions. Far from providing us with a sort of formulary, it teaches us\r\nto put our finger on a number of difficulties. It brings to the surface\r\nthe many aspects and fertile and varied considerations, the examination of\r\nwhich is the mission of the real statesman and legislator. In this way,\r\nthe action of thought and the power of the moral idea are revealed with\r\nmost _éclat_. Man ceases to be an inert element, and manifests himself as\r\na sensible being, and the sublime thought of Pascal: “Humanity is like one\r\nman who lives and learns always,” is verified by the result. The wish to\r\nviolently abdicate the past, it would be vain and rash to attempt to\r\nrealize. The lessons it transmits to us are as instructive as the picture\r\nit unrolls before our eyes is attractive. We have no longer but to see and\r\nhear, to be cured of the most generous impatience with what is, and to\r\nretreat from the most perilous attempts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe unvarying testimony of ages affirms the continued and gradual\r\namelioration of man by individual energy and moral thought.(48) Want and\r\nsuffering have urged him forward. Foresight, labor, sacrifice and virtue\r\nhave in part redeemed him. No right has been lessened or usurped, and\r\nevery step in civilization has been a step in the way of freedom. Instead\r\nof making the latter responsible for a material and moral wretchedness\r\nwhich it is called upon to cure, we may prove, that, in proportion as real\r\nliberty and legal guarantees increase, evil diminishes.\r\n\r\nWe do not desire to yield to a convenient optimism, and deny the\r\nsufferings which weigh only too heavily on the world. We are far from\r\nhaving reached the end assigned to our efforts; but let not the hope we\r\nentertain of further progress blind us to that which has already been\r\naccomplished. This latter shows us that we are on the right road, and that\r\nwe have not done unwisely in giving free rein to the human faculties.\r\nSudden changes are made only in theaters. In the real world, the march of\r\nprogress is slow and laborious. It may be accelerated by a happy hit; but\r\nit would be vain to try to hurry it.\r\n\r\nMan still suffers. No one desires to deny the evil, but only to estimate\r\nits extent. Yet it cannot be gainsaid that its fatal empire is narrowing\r\ninstead of enlarging. Especially is it the progress accomplished in the\r\nhigher regions of intellect and of the feelings which here exerts its\r\nbeneficent influence. On our moral greatness depends our material power.\r\nThe elevation or debasement of character, the energy or debility of the\r\nwill—such is the first source of good or evil. The world, a Chalmers\r\nrightly says, is so constituted that we should be materially happy if we\r\nwere morally good.\r\n\r\nIndustrial progress helps, we have said, towards moral perfection. It is\r\nnot the source of that perfection, but its instrument; for ignorance and\r\nmisery, its habitual attendants, are poor advisers. Political Economy\r\nshows how the goods of this world are multiplied. It shows how modest\r\ncomfort may become more and more general, and thus an impetus be given to\r\nall noble virtues without awakening a blind passion for riches. It teaches\r\nmoderation instead of exciting covetousness, nor does it come in conflict\r\nwith the sublime words of Saint Augustine: “The family of men, living by\r\nfaith, use the goods of the earth as strangers here, not to be captivated\r\nby them or turned away by them from the goal to which they tend, which is\r\nGod, but to find in them a support which, far from aggravating, lightens\r\nthe burthen of this perishable body which weighs down the soul.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nLooked at from below, all things diverge. Looked at from above, all things\r\nrun into one another and combine with one another. It is one of the great\r\nmerits of the historical method, that it raises the point of observation\r\nand gives the observer the support of tradition and good sense, that\r\nmaster of life; that it prevents a divorce between different branches of\r\nknowledge of the same order, which constitute but one intellectual family,\r\nwhich there is no question of confounding, and which it would be dangerous\r\nto isolate.\r\n\r\nAristotle, that universal genius, had discovered Political Economy, and it\r\nwas the historical method which revealed it to him. Be it added, that the\r\ngreat philosopher had seen but one phase of the science, chrematistics,\r\nand that his ideas here bear the impress of the age in which he lived.\r\nAristotle, however, distinguished this science from all others and from\r\ndomestic economy, which is so akin to it. Doubtless, he did not found the\r\nmodern study of Political Economy, but his powerful intellect gave him a\r\npresentiment of it.\r\n\r\nThe honor of producing at once, Adam Smith, Quesnay and Turgot belongs to\r\nthe eighteenth century. It was in the course of philosophy at Glasgow that\r\nthis study found a definite place. The illustrious founder of the science\r\nof Political Economy did not contemplate dissolving the ancient alliance\r\nbetween it and the moral sciences, history, philosophy, jurisprudence,\r\nbelles-lettres—all of which he had explored and studied profoundly. Let\r\nthose whose ambition it is to walk, even at a distance, in the footsteps\r\nof Adam Smith, not forget what was the cradle of the noble study to which\r\nthey have devoted their intellects.\r\n\r\nL. WOLOWSKI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Chapter I.\r\n\r\n\r\nFundamental Ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Section I.\r\n\r\n\r\nGoods—Wants.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe starting point, as well as the object-point of our science is Man.(49)\r\n\r\nEvery man has numberless wants, physical and intellectual.(50)(51) Wants\r\nare either necessaries, decencies (_Anstandsbedürfnisse_) or luxuries. The\r\nnon-satisfaction of necessary wants causes disease or death; that of the\r\nwants of decency endangers one’s social position.(52) The much greater\r\nnumber, and the longer continuance of his wants are among the most\r\nstriking differences between man and the brute:(53) wants such as\r\nclothing, fuel,(54) tools, and those resulting from his much longer period\r\nof infancy; which last, together with other causes, has contributed so\r\nlargely to make marriage necessary and universal. While the lower animals\r\nhave no wants, but necessities, and while their aggregate-want, even in\r\nthe longest series of generations, admits of no qualitative increase, the\r\ncircle of man’s wants is susceptible of indefinite extension.(55) And,\r\nindeed, every advance in culture made by man finds expression in an\r\nincrease in the number and in the keenness of his rational wants. No man\r\nwho distinguishes himself in anything, but feels spurred thereto by a\r\npeculiar want; and this want is both the cause and the effect of the power\r\nwhich is peculiar to him. No one but the poet feels the want of poetizing;\r\nno one but the philosopher, of philosophizing. In every particular,\r\nintellectual or physical, in which the man is in advance of the child, he\r\nexperiences new wants unknown to the child. Our education consists, for\r\nthe most part, in awakening wants and providing for their satisfaction.\r\n\r\nGoods are anything which can be used, whether directly or indirectly, for\r\nthe satisfaction of any true(56) or legitimate human want,(57) and whose\r\nutility, for this purpose, is recognized. Hence, the idea goods is an\r\nessentially relative one. Every change in man’s wants, or knowledge, is\r\naccompanied by a rapid, corresponding change, either in the limits of the\r\ncircle(58) of goods, or in their relative importance. Thus, the tobacco\r\nplant has, probably, existed thousands of years. It became goods, however,\r\nonly from the time that man recognized its use for smoking, snuffing etc.,\r\nand experienced the want of it for these purposes. In a similar way, the\r\nlimestone of the Solenhofen quarries has become _goods_, of considerable\r\nimportance, only since the invention of lithography; decaying bones, only\r\nsince that of bone-dust manure; caoutchouc since about 1825, and\r\ngutta-percha, only since 1844. On the other hand, charms,(59) philters,\r\nand even relics, since the decay of faith in their efficacy, have lost the\r\nquality of goods. If the aggregate income of all mankind were, by some\r\nsudden revolution, to be equally divided among all, diamonds, for\r\ninstance, would greatly decline in value, for the reason that it is\r\ndependent, in great part, on the wants generated by vanity, or by the\r\ndesire of outshining others. Beer, tobacco etc., would rise in the scale\r\nas goods, because the circle of those to whose wants they minister would\r\nhave been very greatly extended. On the whole, advancement in civilization\r\nhas uniformly the effect, of itself, to increase the quantity and number\r\nof goods, the wants and knowledge of men being thereby increased. We\r\nshould reach the ideal here, if all men experienced only true or\r\nlegitimate wants, but these completely; if they could see their way,\r\nclearly, to the satisfaction of them, and find the means of satisfying\r\nthem with just the amount of effort most conducive to their\r\nphysico-intellectual development.(60)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section II.\r\n\r\n\r\nGoods.—Economic Goods.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy economy (_Wirthschaft_=husbandry or housekeeping), we mean the\r\nsystematized activity of man, to satisfy his need (_Bedarf_=requisite) of\r\nexternal goods.(61) This treatise is concerned only with economic goods\r\n(ends or means of economy).(62) The greater the advance of civilization or\r\nhuman culture, the less apt are men to pursue the satisfaction of their\r\nwants, isolated from their fellows, or, in other words, to carry on their\r\neconomies or husbandries apart from one another. The more numerous the\r\nwants of men, and the more different in kind their faculties are, the more\r\nnatural does exchange(63) become. Since all goods derive their character\r\nas goods from the fact that they are destined to satisfy human wants, the\r\nvery possibility of exchange must greatly increase the possibility of\r\nthings to become goods. Think of the machinist, whose products are used\r\nonly by the astronomer, while the latter is never in a way to manufacture\r\nthem for himself. (_Hufeland._) Commerce is the series of combinations,\r\ncreated by the interchange of services: “a living net of relations, which\r\nwants and services are ever weaving and unweaving.” (_Hermann._) As a\r\nrule, with an advance in civilization, there is an increase in the number\r\nof goods, which become economic goods, and in the number of economic goods\r\nwhich become commercial goods (objects or means promotive of\r\ncommerce).(64) But this is to be considered a real advancement only to the\r\nextent that that which is obtained is superior to that which was possessed\r\nbefore, in consequence of the specialization of callings or the greater\r\ndivision of labor (§ 48 ff.). When a little street Arab exacts money from\r\na stranger for pointing out the way, we rightly censure him; but no one\r\nwould find it improper if he should first fit himself to play the part of\r\na guide, and then live by his calling.(65)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section III.\r\n\r\n\r\nGoods.—The Three Classes Of Goods.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll economic goods are divided into three classes:\r\n\r\nA. _Persons or personal services._ It is entirely repugnant to the feeling\r\nof humanity to regard a man’s person in its entirety as an instrument\r\nintended to satisfy the wants of another.(66) Yet this happens wherever\r\nslavery exists; in its coarsest form, in cannibalism. Among civilized\r\nnations, we can speak, under this head, only of individual services or\r\ncapabilities of persons; or, indeed, of the aggregate of the services\r\nrendered by them during a time determined at pleasure, or a short\r\ntime.(67)\r\n\r\nB. _Things_, both moveable and immovable.(68)\r\n\r\nC. _Relations_ to persons or things which may frequently be estimated just\r\nas accurately as material goods. (The _res incorporales_ of the Roman\r\nlaw.) I need only mention what is called good-will, which freely, and to\r\nthe advantage of customers themselves, but still with a limited amount of\r\ncertainty, attaches to certain localities, and for which tavern-keepers,\r\nsometimes, as in theaters, dépôts and clubs, pay so enormous a rent.(69)\r\nWhen a newspaper is sold, the purchaser frequently buys nothing but the\r\nexisting relations between his colaborers, subscribers etc. No small part\r\nof the value of a good business firm consists in the confidence with which\r\nit inspires all who deal with it, thus sparing them a world of care and\r\ntrouble.(70) A general may be of incalculable value to an army which he\r\nhas himself helped organize. In another, or in the service of a country\r\nnot his own, he might be entirely valueless, incapable of accomplishing\r\nanything.(71) With the progress of civilization, as man becomes more\r\nsocial, the number of valuable relations increases, while that of\r\nlegalized monopolies is wont to decrease. (_Schäffle._)(72)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf Value.—Value In Use.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe economic value of goods is the importance they possess for the\r\npurposes of man, considered as engaged in economy (housekeeping,\r\nhusbandry.(73))\r\n\r\nLooked at from the point of view of the person who wishes to employ them\r\nin his use directly, doubtless the oldest point of view, value appears\r\nfirst as value in use; and here, according to the difference of subjective\r\npurposes it is intended to subserve, we may speak of production value or\r\nenjoyment-value; and of this last, in turn, as utilization-value, or\r\nconsumption-value. The value in use of goods, is greater in proportion as\r\nthe number of wants they are calculated to satisfy are more general and\r\nmore urgent, and in proportion as they are gratified by them more fully,\r\nsurely, durably, easily and pleasantly.(74) Hence, it is seldom possible\r\nto find an accurate mathematical expression of the relation which exists\r\nbetween the value in use of different goods.(75) Thus, it is possible to\r\nestimate the nutritive power of different kinds of goods, the value of\r\nwheat or of hay for instance, but not the goodness or quality of their\r\ntaste, of the attractiveness of their appearance, etc.\r\n\r\nBut, the more men become used to comparing the aggregate of human wants,\r\nand the aggregate of the goods which minister to the satisfaction of these\r\nwants, as if they were two great wholes, gradually shading each into the\r\nother, the more does the value in use of the different kinds of goods\r\nassume, for purposes of social rating or estimation, a fungible\r\ncharacter.(76) If a new kind of goods be produced or discovered, which\r\nsatisfies the same wants in a more complete manner than another, the\r\nlatter, although it has suffered no change, generally loses in the value\r\nput upon it, especially if the new goods can be produced in any desired\r\nquantity. An instance of this is the change effected in the value of the\r\ndyers weed, woad, by the introduction of indigo.\r\n\r\nThings present in quantities greater than the amount necessary to supply\r\nthe want they satisfy, preserve their full value in use, to the limit of\r\nthat want, after which they are simply an element of possible future\r\nvalue, dependent on an increase of the want; but they have no value for\r\npresent use.(77)\r\n\r\nThe economic valuation of goods, however, is by no means exhausted, so far\r\nas the isolated individual housekeeper is concerned, by the mere\r\nestablishing of its value in use. As the systematic effort of every\r\nrational individual in his household management is directed towards the\r\nobtaining, by a minimum of sacrifice of pleasure and energy, a maximum\r\nsatisfaction of his wants, even an Adam or a Crusoe is, in his economy,\r\ncompelled to estimate not only what the goods to be acquired accomplish\r\n(value in use) but also what they will cost—cost-value. Even the most\r\nindispensable kind of goods, for instance atmospheric air, is considered\r\nto have no value, when it can be obtained in sufficient quantity, without\r\nany sacrifice whatever.(78)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Section V.\r\n\r\n\r\nValue.—Value In Exchange.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe value in exchange of goods, or the quality which makes them\r\nexchangeable against other goods, is based on a combination of their value\r\nin use with their cost-value, such as men in their intercourse with one\r\nanother will make.(79) Without value in use, value in exchange(80) is\r\nunthinkable.\r\n\r\nBut there are many, and even indispensable goods which are not at all\r\nsusceptible of being exchanged; for instance, the light and heat of the\r\nsun, the open sea etc.(81) Other goods, although capable of being\r\nexchanged, have no value in exchange, because they exist in\r\nsuperabundance, and may be obtained by everyone, without trouble and\r\nwithout reward; for instance, drinking-water in most places, ice in\r\nwinter, and wood in the primeval forest.(82) Moreover, the idea of such\r\n“free goods” is in great part relative. The water of a river may, for\r\ndrinking purposes, be “free” goods, and yet, for purposes of irrigation,\r\nhave great value in exchange. (_John Stuart Mill_).\r\n\r\nBut, goods, to obtain value in exchange, must, in addition to their value\r\nin use, a value which must be recognized(83) by a certain number of\r\npersons, at least, have the capacity of becoming the exclusive property of\r\nsome one individual, and therefore of being alienated or transferred; and\r\nthis alienation or transfer must be desired because of the difficulty to\r\nbecome possessed of them in any other way.(84)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nValue.—Alleged Contradiction Between Value In Use And Value In Exchange.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecent, and especially socialistic,(85) writers have alluded to the great\r\n“contradiction” between value in use and value in exchange. This\r\ncontradiction, however, vanishes when the above idea of economy, and the\r\ntwo sides or aspects, which economic value presents, are kept steadily in\r\nview. It is said, for instance, that a pound of gold has a much greater\r\nvalue in exchange than a pound of iron; while the value in use of iron, is\r\nincomparably greater than that of gold. I question this latter statement.\r\nTrue it is, that the need of iron is much more universal and urgent than\r\nthe need of gold. On the other hand, a pound of gold yields satisfaction\r\nto the want of that metal, much greater than is yielded by a pound of\r\niron, to the want of iron. We may speak of a contradiction between value\r\nin use and value in exchange, at the farthest, only in case the existing\r\nquantity of an article in trade, which can be done without, is not\r\nestimated correspondingly lower than the whole existing supply of a thing\r\nwhich is indispensable. But this is a case which cannot often occur. When,\r\nfor instance, wheat is very dear, as in years of scarcity, people prefer\r\nto pay a very high price for it rather than to dispense, even in part,\r\nwith its use; and so of all the necessaries of life. As people progress in\r\neconomic culture, they become more expert in adapting the value in\r\nexchange of related goods, not only to their cost-value, but also to their\r\nvalue in use.(86)(87)\r\n\r\nThe lower the state of a nation’s economy, the more isolated men live from\r\none another, the greater is the prominence given by them to value in use,\r\nas compared with value in exchange, a fact which makes a valuation of\r\nresources, which shall be universally applicable, a more difficult\r\nmatter.(88)(89)(90)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nResources Or Means (Vermögen).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Resources_, or _means_, in the sense in which we here use the term, are\r\nthe aggregate of economic goods owned by a physical or legal person, after\r\ndeduction is made of the person’s debts, and all valuable and rightful\r\nclaims have been added.(91) Hence, there are private resources,\r\ncorporative resources, municipal resources, etc., state resources,\r\nnational resources and the world’s resources. In estimating the resources\r\nof a whole people, it is, of course, necessary to make deduction of the\r\ndebts due by the individual members of the nation to their fellow\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nValuation Of Resources.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has often been made a question, whether the valuation of resources\r\nshould be based on the value in use, or the value in exchange of their\r\nconstituent parts.(92) The latter has, of course, no interest, except in\r\nso far as we are concerned with the possibility of obtaining the control\r\nof part of the resources, or means, of another, by the surrender of a part\r\nof one’s own goods. In estimating the value of private resources, which\r\nrequire to be made continually an object of trade, this point is, of\r\ncourse, of the greatest importance. If certain of their component\r\nelements, lands, for instance, belonging to a _fidei commissum_, are\r\nincapable of entering immediately into the market, at least the revenue\r\nthey yield is measured by its value in exchange.\r\n\r\nIt is quite otherwise, even with the resources of a whole nation. Such\r\nresources are, evidently, much more independent, and have much less need\r\nof being exchanged against their equals, than private resources. The\r\nforeign commerce, of the greatest and most advanced nations, has,\r\nhitherto, been but a small quota of their internal commerce.(93) A\r\nvaluation, therefore, based on value in exchange, however interesting it\r\nmight be to enable us to determine how property is shared by the different\r\nclasses and persons that compose the nation, would afford but little\r\ninformation concerning the absolute amount of the national wealth. This,\r\nof course, applies in a much higher degree to the resources of the whole\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIf, now, we were to estimate the resources of an entire people, or even of\r\nthe world, by summing up the value in exchange of their several component\r\nparts, many very important elements would be left out of the account\r\nentirely; as for instance, harbors, navigable streams, numberless\r\nrelations which have, indeed, no value in exchange whatever, but which are\r\nof the highest importance, because promotive of the economy of the nation.\r\nThe same may be said of made roads of every description, the\r\npolitico-economical value of which may be much greater than the value in\r\nexchange of their stock, than their cost of production etc. The increase\r\nof the value in exchange of any of the branches of the resources of a\r\nphysical or legal person contributes towards really enriching the nation\r\nor the world, only in case that the increased value in exchange is based\r\non an increased utility in quality or quantity. Should an earthquake\r\nsuddenly dry up a number of our springs, and thus give value in exchange\r\nto the drinking water from the remaining ones, we should, indeed, witness\r\nthe introduction of a new object into the list of exchangeable goods; the\r\nowners of springs would be able to command a larger portion of the\r\nnational resources, but at the expense of the rest of the population; and\r\nthe whole country would have become poorer in goods by the catastrophe.\r\nEven the value in exchange of the national resources would not be\r\nincreased; for all other goods, which, hitherto, as compared with water,\r\nhad an unlimited capacity for exchange, would lose just as much of that\r\ncapacity as water had gained, as compared with them.(94) On the other\r\nhand, if a new mineral spring should be discovered, the great value in use\r\nof the water of which gave it value in exchange, the resources of the\r\nnation would be really increased, not only in point of utility, but in\r\nexchange value; for no other goods, formerly known, would, in consequence\r\nof the discovery, lose in their exchange power.(95)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nWealth.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe possession of large and also of potentially lasting resources;\r\nobjectively, such resources themselves, we call wealth. But it must be\r\nlarge in a two-fold sense; large as compared with the rational wants of\r\nits possessor, and large, also, as compared with the resources of other\r\npeople, especially with the resources of those in the same condition of\r\nlife. To be called rich, it is not enough “to have a sufficiency,” (the\r\nindividual side); it is necessary to have more than others.(96) If all men\r\nwere possessed of a great deal, but all of an exactly equal amount, each\r\nwould be compelled, it may be conjectured, to be his own chimney-sweep,\r\nhis own scavenger and “boot-black.” And how could anyone, then, be\r\nproperly called wealthy? This is the social side of the idea of\r\nwealth.(97) Hence, a person, with the same resources, might be very\r\nwealthy in a provincial town, while, in the capital, he could enjoy only\r\nmoderate comfort.(98)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Section X.\r\n\r\n\r\nWealth.—Signs Of National Wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe should have a very imperfect idea of the wealth of a people (§ 8) if we\r\nshould estimate it at the value in exchange of the sum(99)-total of the\r\ncomponent parts of the national resources. By the following signs,\r\nhowever, an approximative notion of the value in use of the resources of a\r\nnation may be obtained:\r\n\r\nA. When, even the lower classes, who compose everywhere the greatest\r\nportion of the people, are comfortable, in a condition worthy of human\r\nbeings. Thus, C. Dupin is surprised at the great quantities of meat,\r\nbutter, cheese and tea entered on the accounts of the poor-houses in\r\nEngland, and the great care taken to have these of the best quality.(100)\r\nA good symptom of such a state of things is a high average duration of\r\nhuman life, especially when there is a relatively large number of births.\r\n(§ 246.)\r\n\r\nB. When a considerable outlay, devoted to the satisfaction of the more\r\nrefined wants, is voluntarily made, and by those only possessed of a\r\nproper economic sense. Thus, in England, the various mission, bible, and\r\ntract societies had, in 1841, an aggregate income of £630,000. The\r\nexpeditions in search of Franklin cost over a million pounds sterling. The\r\nstate outlay also belongs to this category, provided, that taxes are\r\ncollected and loans obtained, without any noticeable oppression. The sum\r\nof 20,000,000 pounds sterling, voted, in 1833, by the British Parliament\r\nfor the abolition of slavery, is one of the happiest signs of the national\r\nwealth of England.(101)\r\n\r\nC. A large number of valuable buildings, and permanent improvements; for\r\ninstance, roads of every description, works for purposes of irrigation and\r\ndrainage. Thus, in London, from September, 1843, to September, 1845, there\r\nwere constructed squares and streets with an aggregate length of 11.1\r\ngeographical miles. The number of newly built houses in London, between\r\n1843 and 1847, was nearly 27,000. And so, in England and Wales there are\r\n492 geographical miles of navigable canals, while their navigable rivers\r\nare estimated to have a length of only 449 miles. The number of miles of\r\nrailroad, in the British Empire, in 1865, was 2,897 geographical miles,\r\nand they cost 459 million of pounds; in 1870, it was 3,270 geographical\r\nmiles, at an aggregate cost of 650 millions sterling.\r\n\r\nD. The frequent occurrence of heavy commercial payments, which finds\r\nexpression especially in the magnitude and costliness of the most usual\r\nmedium of exchange. Thus, all payments are made in England in paper (for\r\nsums of at least five pounds sterling) or in gold coin. Silver is used\r\nonly as small change, like copper in most other countries. (_Infra_, §\r\n118, seq.)(102)\r\n\r\nE. Frequent loans to foreign nations. Hence, Storch divides all countries\r\ninto borrowing or poor countries, loaning or rich countries, and\r\nindependent countries which hold a middle place between the two\r\nformer.(103)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf Economy (Husbandry).\r\n\r\n\r\nAll normal economy(104) (husbandry) aims at securing a maximum of personal\r\nadvantage with a minimum of cost or outlay.(105) And there are always two\r\nintellectual incentives at the foundation of this economy. There is,\r\nfirst, self-interest, the positive manifestation of which is the effort to\r\nacquire as much of the world’s goods as possible, and the negative\r\nexpression of which, the effort to lose as little of them as\r\npossible—acquisitiveness—saving. Self-interest, losing its moral, and\r\nassuming a guilty, character, degenerates into egotism; acquisitiveness,\r\ninto covetousness; and the disposition to save, into avarice—the\r\n_solipsismus_ of Kant. The incentive to ameliorate one’s condition is\r\ncommon to all men, no matter how varied the form or different the\r\nintensity of its manifestation. It guides us all from the cradle to the\r\ngrave. It may be restricted within certain limits, but never entirely\r\nextinguished. It is, in the domain of economy, what the instinct of\r\nself-preservation is to our physical existence, a powerful principle of\r\ncreation, preservation and of renewed life (I. Thessal., 4, 11,\r\nseq.).(106) Then there is the incentive of the demand of God’s voice\r\nwithin us, the voice of conscience, whether we call it, in philosophic\r\noutline “the adumbration of the ideas of equity, right, benevolence, of\r\nperfection and inner freedom,” or, framing our lives in accordance with\r\nthem, the striving after the Kingdom of God.(107) It matters not, how much\r\nthe image of God may have been disfigured in most men, there is no one in\r\nwhom the longing for it has so far disappeared as to leave no trace\r\nbehind. This puts bounds to our self-interest, and transmutes it into an\r\nearthly means to enable us to approximate to an eternal ideal.\r\n\r\nAs, in the structure of the world, the apparently opposing tendencies of\r\nthe centrifugal and centripetal forces produce the harmony of the spheres,\r\nso, in the social life of man, self-interest and conscience produce in him\r\nthe feeling for the common good.(108) This sentiment of the common\r\ninterest is the foundation on which rise in successive gradation, the life\r\nof the family, of the community, of the nation and of humanity, the last\r\nof which should be coincident with the life of the Church. It, alone, can\r\nrealize the kingdom of heaven on earth. Through this sentiment alone can\r\nreligion be made active and moral. Only through it, can self-interest be\r\nmade really sure and always to the purpose. Even the most calculating mind\r\nmust acknowledge, that numberless institutions, relations etc., are useful\r\nand even necessary to many individuals, which can be established or\r\nmaintained only from a sense of the general welfare, for the reason that\r\nno one individual could make the sacrifice required to establish or\r\nmaintain them. And so, since commerce has wrought the interests of all men\r\ninto one great piece of net-work, the best means of obtaining wherewith to\r\nsatisfy our own wants is to help others satisfy theirs. Self-interest\r\ncauses every one to choose the course in life in which he shall meet with\r\nthe least competition and the most abundant patronage; in other words,\r\nthat which answers to the most pressing and least satisfied want of the\r\ncommunity. As a rule, the physician who cures the greatest number of\r\npatients with the greatest skill, and the manufacturer who produces the\r\nbest goods cheapest, will grow to be the richest. It is, moreover, easy to\r\nsee that, according as the circle of common interests grows smaller, it\r\napproximates to self-interest; and to “the Kingdom of God”(109) as it\r\ngrows larger. And yet, all these circles respectively condition one\r\nanother. Cosmopolitanism or church-zeal, without love of country;\r\npatriotism, without fidelity to the community in which one lives, or love\r\nof one’s family, are more than suspicious. The reverse is also true. This\r\nis a chief connecting link between the great apparent opposites.(110)(111)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomy.—Grades Of Economy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to this feeling for the common weal, the eternal and destructive\r\nwar—the _bellum omnium contra omnes_—which an unscrupulous self-interest\r\nwould not fail to generate among men engaged in the isolated prosecution\r\nof their own economic interests, ceases in the higher, well-ordered\r\norganization(112) of society. On it are based the various forms of economy\r\nin common: family-economy, corporation or association-economy, municipal\r\neconomy, and national economy.(113) And these forms of economy in common\r\nare so essentially the condition and complement of individual economy,\r\nthat the latter, without them, could either not be maintained at all, or,\r\nat least, only in the very lowest stage of civilization.\r\n\r\nAlthough the higher science of Political Economy has, nearly always, been\r\nconceived(114) as treating of the aggregate national activity of a people,\r\nthere have been many, recently, who consider Political Economy as no real\r\nwhole, but only as a mere abstraction. This is true, especially of many\r\nunconditional free-trade theorizers, partly from a repugnance toward the\r\ngovernmental guardianship of private businesses or economy. It is true,\r\nalso, of certain philosophers who consider the idea, “the people,” as\r\nmerely nominal.(115) There are, however, two things necessary to warrant\r\nus to call a thing made up of a number of parts, one real whole: the parts\r\nand the whole must have a reciprocal action upon one another, and the\r\nwhole, as such, must have a demonstrable action of its own. (_Drobisch._)\r\nIn this sense, “the people” is, unquestionably, a reality, and not alone\r\nthe individuals who constitute the “people.” Besides, it is truly said\r\nthat all husbandry or economy supposes a will (“systematized activity”\r\netc., _supra_, § 2). Such a will is ascribed to individuals, to legal\r\npersons, to the state, but not, however, to “the people,” as a whole. But\r\nthis will need not be an entirely conscious one, as is plain from the case\r\nof the less gifted and less cultured individuals engaged in household\r\neconomy. The systemization in the public economy of a people finds its\r\nclearest expression in economic laws, and in the institutions of the\r\nstate. But it finds expression, also, without the intervention of the\r\nstate, in the laws established by use, and by the opinions of jurists or\r\ncourts, in community of speech, of customs and tastes etc.: things which\r\nhave an important economic meaning, which depend on the common nature of\r\nthe land, of race and history, and which influence the state, at least as\r\nmuch as they are influenced by it.(116)(117)\r\n\r\nThe most that can be said, at present, so far as an economy of mankind, or\r\na world-economy, is concerned, is, that it may be shown that important\r\npreparations have been made for it. We are approaching more nearly to it\r\nby the ways of the more and more cosmopolitan character of science, the\r\nincreasing international coöperation of labor, the improvement in the\r\nmeans of transportation, growing emigration, the greater love of peace,\r\nand the greater toleration of nations etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nPolitical Economy.—The Economic Organism.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea conveyed by the word _organism_, is doubtless, one of the most\r\nobscure of all ideas; and I am so far from desiring to explain(118) by\r\nthat idea, the meaning of public or national economy, that I would only\r\nuse the word _organism_ as the shortest and most familiar expression of a\r\nnumber of problems, which it is the purpose of the following investigation\r\nto solve.\r\n\r\nThere are two points, especially, of importance here. In the motion of any\r\nmachine, it is possible to distinguish with the utmost accuracy, between\r\nthe cause and the effect of the motion: the blowing of the wind, for\r\ninstance, is simply and purely, the cause of the friction of the\r\nmill-stones in a wind-mill, and is not in the least influenced or\r\nconditioned by the latter. But, in the public economy of every people,\r\npatient thought soon shows the observer, that the most important\r\nsimultaneous events or phenomena mutually condition one another. Thus, a\r\nflourishing state of agriculture is impossible without flourishing\r\nindustries; but, conversely, the prosperity of the latter supposes the\r\nprosperity of the former, as a condition precedent. It is as in the human\r\nbody. The motions of respiration are produced by the action of the spinal\r\ncord; and the spinal cord, in turn, continues to work only through the\r\nblood, that is, by the help of respiration. In all cases like this, we are\r\nforced, when accounting for phenomena, to move about in a circle, unless\r\nwe admit the existence of an organic life, of which every individual fact\r\nis only the manifestation.(119)(120)\r\n\r\nIt is, also, undeniable, that human insight into the operation and utility\r\nof a machine must always precede the existence of the machine itself. This\r\nhuman insight is parent to the plan, and the plan, in turn, is parent to\r\nthe machine. The very reverse of this is true in the case of organisms,\r\nthose “divine machines” as Leibnitz called them. Men had digested food and\r\nreproduced their kind, thousands of years before physiologists had\r\nattained to a true theory of digestion or reproduction. I do not, indeed,\r\nby any means, pretend, that the public economy of nations is governed by\r\nnatural necessity, in the same degree, as for instance, the human body. We\r\nshall find, however, that the minute arbitrary variations usual here and\r\nthere in the course of its development, generally compensate for one\r\nanother, in accordance with the law of large numbers. Here, too, we find\r\nharmonies, frequently of wonderful beauty, which existed long before any\r\none dreamt of them; innumerable _natural laws_,(121) whose operation does\r\nnot depend on their recognition by individuals, and, over which, only he\r\ncan obtain power who has learned to obey them. (_Bacon_)(122)(123)(124)\r\nBut it should never be lost sight of, that the natural laws governing the\r\npublic economy of a people, like those of the human mind, are\r\ndistinguished in one very essential point from those of the material\r\nworld. They have to do with free rational beings, who, because they are\r\nthus free and rational, are responsible to God and their conscience, and\r\nconstitute in their aggregate a species capable of progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrigin Of A Nation’s Economy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe public economy of a people has its origin simultaneously with the\r\npeople. It is neither the invention of man nor the revelation of God. It\r\nis the natural product of the faculties and propensities which make man\r\nman.(125) Just as it may be shown, that the family which lives isolated\r\nfrom all others, contains, in itself, the germs of all political\r\norganization,(126) so may it be demonstrated, that every independent\r\nhousehold management contains the germs of all politico-economical\r\nactivity. The public economy of a nation grows with the nation. With the\r\nnation, it blooms and ripens. Its season of blossoming and of maturity is\r\nthe period of its greatest strength, and, at the same time, of the most\r\nperfect development of all its more important organs.(127) In respect to\r\nit, the economic endeavors of any epoch may be said to be represented by\r\ntwo great parties, the one progressive, the other, conservative. The\r\nformer would hasten the period of the nation’s richest and most varied\r\ndevelopment, the latter postpone its departure as long as possible; and\r\nhence it comes, that a people’s economic decline is sometimes taken for\r\nprogress, by the former class, and their progress for decline, by the\r\nlatter. As a rule, the union and equilibrium of these parties are wont to\r\nbe the greatest at the period of maturity, because, then, intelligence and\r\nthe spirit of sacrifice for the common good are most general.(128)\r\n\r\nFinally, the public economy of a nation declines with the people.\r\n(_Infra_, § 263 ff.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiseases Of The Social Organism.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the public economy of a people be an organism, we must expect to find\r\nthat the perturbations, which affect it, present some analogies to the\r\ndiseases of the body physical. We may, therefore, hope to learn much that\r\nmay be of use in practice, from the tried methods of medicine.(129) In the\r\ndiseases of the body economic, it is necessary to distinguish accurately,\r\nbetween the nature of the disease and its external symptoms, although it\r\nmay be necessary to combat the latter directly, and not merely with a view\r\nto alleviation. Following the example of the physician, we should\r\nparticularly direct our attention to the curative method which nature\r\nitself would pursue, were art not to intervene. “The curative power of\r\nnature is no peculiar power; it is the result of a series of happy\r\nadjustments, by means of which the morbid perturbation itself sets in\r\nmotion the springs which may either destroy the evil or paralyze its\r\naction. It is, in fact, nothing but the original power which formed the\r\nbody and preserves its life in contact with the external causes of\r\nperturbation and the internal disorder provoked by these causes.”\r\n(_Ruete._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Chapter II.\r\n\r\n\r\nPosition Of Political Economy In The Circle Of Related Sciences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nPolitical Or National Economy.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the science of national,(130) or Political Economy, we understand the\r\nscience which has to do with the laws of the development of the economy of\r\na nation, or with its economic national life. (Philosophy of the history\r\nof Political Economy, according to von Mangoldt.) Like all the political\r\nsciences, or sciences of _national life_, it is concerned, on the one\r\nhand, with the consideration of the individual man, and on the other, it\r\nextends its investigations to the whole of human kind.(131)\r\n\r\nNational life, like all life, is a whole, the various phenomena of which\r\nare most intimately connected with one another. Hence it is, that to\r\nunderstand one side of it scientifically, it is necessary to know all its\r\nsides. But, especially, is it necessary to fix one’s attention on the\r\nfollowing seven: language, religion, art, science, law, the state and\r\neconomy.(132) Without language, all higher mental activity is unthinkable;\r\nwithout religion, all else would lose its firmest foundation and highest\r\naim. Through art, alone, do all these sides attain to beauty; through\r\nscience, alone, to clearness. Law arises, the moment conflicts of will\r\nbecome inevitable and an adjustment is desired. The state has to do with\r\nthem, in so far as they have any external force or validity. Indeed, there\r\nis no human relation, not even the highest and the sweetest, but has its\r\neconomic interests. It is, therefore, natural, that each of the sciences\r\nwhich relate to these various regions of human life should, in part,\r\npresuppose all others, and, in part, serve as a basis for them.(133)\r\n\r\nBut in the midst of this universal relationship, it is easy to see that\r\nlaw, the state and economy constitute a family, as it were apart and more\r\nclosely connected. (The social sciences, in the narrower sense of the\r\nexpression.)\r\n\r\nThey are confined almost exclusively to what Schleiermacher has called\r\n“effective action” (_wirksame Handeln_), while art and science belong\r\nalmost entirely to the “action of representation” (_darstellenden\r\nHandeln_); and religion and language combine both kinds. Law, the state,\r\nand economy too, have their roots so deep in the physical and intellectual\r\nimperfection of man, that we can scarcely imagine their continuance beyond\r\nhis life on earth (Gospel of Matthew, 22, 30). But within these limits,\r\ntheir several provinces and the subjects with which they are concerned are\r\nalmost coincident. They only consider these from different points of view:\r\nthe science of politics from that of sovereignty; the science of Political\r\nEconomy from that of the satisfaction of the requirement of external goods\r\nby the people; the science of law from that of the prevention or the\r\npeaceable adjustment of conflicts of will. As every economic act,\r\nconsciously or unconsciously, supposes forms of law, so, by far the\r\ngreater number of the laws relating to rights, and the greater number of\r\njudgments in the matter of rights, contain an economic element. In\r\nnumberless cases, the science of law gives us only the external _how_; the\r\ndeeper _why_ is revealed to us by the science of Political\r\nEconomy.(134)(135) And, as to the state, who, for instance, can appreciate\r\nthe political significance of a nobility, without understanding the\r\neconomic character of rent, and of the possession of large landed estates?\r\nWho can politically appreciate the inferior classes of society, unless\r\ninitiated into a knowledge of the laws that govern wages and population?\r\nIt were much easier to cultivate psychology without physiology! “The state\r\nis society protected by force” (_Herbart_). There are two bases to all\r\nmaterial power:(136) wealth and warlike ability (χρήματα—ναυτικά,\r\naccording to Thucydides); and how much the latter has need of the former\r\nis well expressed by the familiar saying of Montecuccoli: “Money is not\r\nonly the first, but the second and third condition of war.”(137)\r\n\r\nFrederick the Great calls finance the pulse of the state, and Richelieu,\r\nthe point of support which Archimedes was in search of, to move the world.\r\nIn all modern nations, the history of the debates on the raising of\r\nrevenue and of the passing of budgets is, at the same time, the history of\r\nparliamentary life; and most great revolutions, the Reformation of the\r\nsixteenth century not excepted, if not caused have been promoted, by\r\nfinancial embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nSciences Relating To National Life.—The Science Of Public Economy.—The\r\nScience Of Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf, by the public economy of a nation, we understand economic legislation\r\nand the governmental guidance or direction of the economy of private\r\npersons,(138) the science of public economy becomes, so far as its form is\r\nconcerned, a branch of political science, while as to its matter, its\r\nsubject is almost coincident with that of Political Economy. Hence it is,\r\nthat so many writers use the terms public economy, or the economy of the\r\nstate (_Staatswirthschaft_), and National Economy (_Volkswirthschaft_), as\r\nsynonymous.(139) The hypothesis, in accordance with which, this science\r\nshould discard all consideration of the state, or should refuse to\r\npresuppose its formation,(140) would lead us into an ideal region,\r\ndifficult to define, probably entirely impossible, and inaccessible to\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nJust as clear, is the close connection between politics and Political\r\nEconomy, in the case of the science of finance, or of the science of\r\ngovernmental house-keeping, otherwise the administration of public\r\naffairs. The latter, evidently, so far as its end is concerned, belongs to\r\npolitics, but so far as the means to that end are concerned, to National\r\nEconomy. As the physiologist cannot understand the action of the human\r\nbody, without understanding that of the head; so we would not be able to\r\ngrasp the organic whole of national economy, if we were to leave the\r\nstate, the greatest economy of all, the one which uninterruptedly and\r\nirresistibly acts on all others, out of consideration.(141)\r\n\r\nBy the term _police_, we mean the state power whose office it is, without\r\nmediation, to prevent all disturbances of external order among the\r\npeople.(142) It may extend its action into all the domains of national\r\nlife mentioned above, whenever external order is there threatened, or\r\ncalls for protection; but its action is important especially in the\r\ndomains of law and economy. The science of the _police power_, therefore,\r\nof all those doctrines resulting from investigation into national life,\r\ntakes up only one phase of each of them; and the phases of doctrine thus\r\ntaken up, it combines into a whole, for practical ends. Its relation to\r\nthose sciences is like that of surgery to the medical sciences, or like\r\nthe science of legal procedure to the science of law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nSciences Relating To National Life.—Statistics.\r\n\r\n\r\nStatistics we call the picture or representation of social life at given\r\nperiods of time, and especially at the present time, drawn on a scale in\r\naccordance with the laws of development discovered by means of the\r\ntheoretical sciences above named; as it were, a section through the\r\nstream. (_Schlözer_ calls them: history standing still.)(143) Statistics,\r\nas thus defined, are as far removed from saying too much as from saying\r\ntoo little. To give a complete tableau of their object, statistics should,\r\nof course, take in the life of a people, in all its aspects. But they\r\nshould look upon such facts only as their own property, the meaning of\r\nwhich they are able to understand; that is, such only as can be ranged\r\nunder known laws of development. Unintelligible facts are collected only\r\nin the hope of penetrating into their meaning in the future, by comparing\r\nthem with one another. In the meantime, they are to the statistician only\r\nwhat unfinished experiments are to the investigator of nature.\r\n\r\nThe view is daily gaining ground, that statistics should be\r\noccupied—without, however, confining themselves to them—with present\r\nfacts, with “facts affecting society and the state, which are susceptible\r\nof being expressed in figures.”(144) The more deceptive the immediate\r\nobservation of an individual, isolated fact is, in cases where a great\r\nnumber of simultaneous or scattered individual isolated facts of national\r\nlife should be observed, the more important it is to discover proper\r\nnumerical relations, by noting all the like acts or experiences of men,\r\nthe time and place in question, and the relation of the aggregate of these\r\nphenomena, to the sum-total of the population, or to the sum-total of\r\ncorresponding phenomena in other places. When this is done, and the facts\r\nare completely enumerated and correctly recorded, there is no danger of\r\nsubjective error. And this species of “political and social measuring,” as\r\nHildebrand calls it, may be applied, not only to quantities, but to all\r\nqualities accessible to the observation of the senses; since the\r\nindividual or isolated qualities of the things enumerated, may be again\r\nmade objects of enumeration. Without doubt, this mode of numerical\r\nprocedure is the most perfect for all those divisions of statistics in\r\nwhich it can be followed; and hence, it should be our endeavor to make the\r\nnumerical side of statistics as comprehensive as possible. But, one side\r\nof a science is not a science itself. As there is no natural science\r\nproper called microscopy, embracing all the observations made by means of\r\nthe microscope, so care should be taken not to deduce the principle of a\r\nscience from the chief instrument it employs. There will always be many\r\nand important facts in national life which can not be subjected to\r\nnumerical calculation, although they may be established with the usual\r\namount of historical certainty. Were statistics to be limited, in the\r\nmanner mentioned above, they would remain a collection of fragments, and\r\ninstead of being a science, properly so-called, become a method.(145)\r\n\r\nBesides, it is evident, that, of statistics in general, economic\r\nstatistics constitute a chief part, and precisely the part most accessible\r\nto numerical treatment. As these economic statistics need to be always\r\ndirected by the light of Political Economy, they also furnish it with rich\r\nmaterials for the continuation of its structure, and for the strengthening\r\nof such foundations as it already has. They, are, moreover, the\r\nindispensable condition of the application of economic theorems to\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrivate Economy—Cameralistic Science.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe meaning of the term cameralistic science (_Cameralwissenschaft_) can\r\nbe explained only by the history of the cameralistic system.(146) From the\r\nend of the middle ages, we find, in most German countries, an institution\r\ncalled the Council (_Kammer_) whose province it was to administer the\r\npublic domain, and to watch over regal rights. At first, a mere\r\ngovernmental commission, it was not long before it developed into an\r\nindependent board. This change had taken place in Burgundy as early as the\r\nyear 1409. It was in that country that the emperor Maximilian became\r\nacquainted with the institution; and by the erection of the aulic councils\r\nat Innspruck and Vienna (1498 and 1501), he gave the principal impulse to\r\nthe imitation of it in Germany. As, at that time, the division of labor\r\nwas very little developed, and personal and collegial authority all the\r\nmore developed in consequence, it is easy to conceive that a great part of\r\nall the new and rapidly increasing business of police administration was\r\nconfided to these councils. They were charged especially with what is\r\nknown to-day as economic police (_Wirthschaftspolizei_) and an important\r\npart of the administration of justice, in its lower departments, was\r\nturned over to their subordinates. The most eminent men who wrote, in the\r\nseventeenth century, on cameralistic matters, laid great stress on the\r\npoint, that it was the duty of the aulic councils to entertain not only\r\nfiscal questions, but that it was within their province also, to determine\r\nquestions of economic police.(147) The interest of absolute princes must\r\nhave greatly favored these cameralistic institutions, for they were in\r\ntheir hands docile tools, which escaped the annoying intervention of the\r\nstates of their realms.\r\n\r\nBy degrees, the knowledge necessary to these council officials, and which\r\nfound no place in the lectures on law, were formed into a special body of\r\ndoctrine. After such men as Morhof and Thomasius had prepared the\r\nway,(148) Frederick William I., himself a clever cameralist, and author of\r\nthe masterly financial system of Prussia, took the important step of\r\nfounding, at Halle and Frankfurt on the Oder, special chairs of economy\r\nand cameralistic science; which, considering the time, were very ably\r\nfilled by Gasser and Dithmar. (1727.) There was thus formed in the German\r\nuniversities a distinct school of cameralists, which, through Jung, Rössig\r\nand Schmalz, reached to the nineteenth century. The term cameralistic\r\nscience, the creature of chance, was used, it must be said, with very\r\nvarious limits to its meaning.(149)\r\n\r\nHowever, Political Economy in Germany developed out of the science of law\r\nand the cameralistic sciences, while in England and Italy it had its\r\norigin chiefly in the study of questions of finance and foreign commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section XX.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrivate Economy. (Continued.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we abstract from cameralistic science as it was understood in the last\r\ncentury, what it has in common with all economy,(150) and therefore with\r\npublic economy, next that which belongs to the aggregate of governmental\r\neconomy, there remains only a number of rules, such as those which govern\r\nthe principal branches of private business, and which indicate how they\r\nare to be carried on with the greatest advantage to those who engage in\r\nthem. Such are forest and rural economy, mining science, technology,\r\nincluding architecture, and all that concerns founderies, and commercial\r\nscience. Now that the expression cameralistic science is altogether\r\nobsolete, the aggregate of these might be designated by the name private\r\neconomy. Obviously, we should have here, neither a simple nor pure\r\nscience, but only a compilation of natural-philosophical and economic\r\nlemmas. Thus, in agriculture, for instance, a knowledge of the different\r\nkinds of soil, of the tillage of land, of the different plants and animals\r\netc., belongs to the domain of natural science; while all that relates to\r\nthe cost of production, the employment of capital, the wages of labor, the\r\nexchange of products, net product and the price of land, are purely\r\npolitico-economical. The political economists also require a knowledge of\r\nthe natural side of the cameralistic sciences. Such a knowledge is\r\nindispensable to every detailed and living theory, and especially to the\r\napplication of economic science to practice. The great difference lies in\r\nthis, that the cameralist interests himself in the production of material\r\ngoods for their own sake, while the political economist regards them only\r\nin their relations to national life.(151)\r\n\r\nIt would seem, moreover, that political economists, especially in Germany,\r\nhave attached too much importance to putting formal bounds to their\r\nspecial science. Why not rather follow the example of the students of\r\nnature who care little whether this or that discovery belongs to physics\r\nor chemistry, to astronomy or mathematics, provided, only, very many and\r\nimportant discoveries are made?(152)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Political Economy Treats Of.\r\n\r\n\r\nPolitical Economy treats chiefly of the material interests of nations. It\r\ninquires how the various wants of the people of a country, especially\r\nthose of food, clothing, fuel, shelter, of the sexual instinct etc., may\r\nbe satisfied; how the satisfaction of these wants influences the aggregate\r\nnational life, and how in turn, they are influenced by the national life.\r\n(Gospel of Matth., 4, 4.) This alone suffices to enable us to estimate the\r\nimportance of the science. The relation of virtue to wealth is likened by\r\nBacon to that of an army to its baggage. In Xenophon’s opinion, wealth is\r\nreally useful only to him who knows how to make a good use of it. From an\r\neconomic point of view, the happiest man is he who has accumulated most,\r\nhonorably, and used it best.(153) That, even in a material sense, the\r\nintellect of a people is their most important element, is evident from the\r\nexample of the Chinese, who were so long acquainted with printing, powder,\r\nand the mariner’s compass, without, by their means, attaining to\r\nintelligent public opinion, forming a good army, or coming to an\r\nunderstanding of the art of navigation, to any great extent.\r\n\r\nThe undervaluing of economic matters, for which ages of inferior\r\ncultivation, our own middle ages for instance, are now praised and now\r\nblamed, was really a rare exception even during these ages.(154) Other\r\nkinds of acquisition and enjoyment then occupied the foreground; but there\r\nnever was a time, when gain and enjoyment in general were not favorite\r\nobjects of pursuit, and held in high esteem. The physical wants of\r\nuncultured men cry out much louder than intellectual ones. (§ 2, 14.)(155)\r\nOn the other hand, in over-cultivated ages, when decay begins, an\r\nover-estimation of material things is wont to become general.(156) The\r\nmere servants of mammon, whether as political economists or as private\r\nindividuals, may see their depravity faithfully reflected in communism as\r\nin a mirror. We should not overlook the fact that it is with whole nations\r\nas with the individual man who amasses his own fortune. He reaches the\r\nculminating point of his wealth generally after he has passed the prime of\r\nlife. The most flourishing period of a nation’s existence is wont just to\r\nprecede its decay, and to introduce it.(157) Hence, here nothing could be\r\nmore untrue, as Macchiavelli has remarked, than the general opinion that\r\nmoney is the sinew of war.(158)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Chapter III.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Methods Of Political Economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormer Methods.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe methods(159) which would apply to any science of national life,\r\nprinciples borrowed from any other science, are now generally looked upon\r\nas obsolete. This is true, especially, of the theological method which\r\nprevailed, almost exclusively during the middle ages,(160) and of the\r\njuridical method of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nIt would be much more in harmony with the intellectual tendencies of the\r\ntime, to adopt a mathematical mode of treatment in Political Economy,\r\ninvolving, as such a mode of treatment does, not the matter of the\r\nscience, but only a formal principle. That which is general in Political\r\nEconomy has, it must be acknowledged, much that is analogous to the\r\nmathematical sciences. Like the latter, it swarms with abstractions.(161)\r\nJust as there are, strictly speaking, no mathematical lines or points in\r\nnature, and no mathematical lever, there is nowhere such a thing as\r\nproduction or rent, entirely pure and simple. The mathematical laws of\r\nmotion operate in a hypothetical vacuum, and, where applied, are subjected\r\nto important modifications, in consequence of atmospheric resistance.\r\nSomething similar is true of most of the laws of our science; as, for\r\ninstance, those in accordance with which the price of commodities is fixed\r\nby the buyer and seller. It also, always supposes the parties to the\r\ncontract to be guided only by a sense of their own best interest, and not\r\nto be influenced by secondary considerations. It is not, therefore, to be\r\nwondered at, that many authors have endeavored to clothe the laws of\r\nPolitical Economy in algebraic formulæ.(162) And, indeed, wherever\r\nmagnitudes and the relations of magnitudes to one another are treated of,\r\nit must be possible to subject them to calculation. Herbart has shown that\r\nthis is so in the case of psychology;(163) and all the sciences which\r\ntreat of national life, especially our own, are psychological.(164) But\r\nthe advantages of the mathematical mode of expression diminish as the\r\nfacts to which it is applied become more complicated. This is true even in\r\nthe ordinary psychology of the individual. How much more, therefore, in\r\nthe portraying of national life! Here the algebraic formulæ would soon\r\nbecome so complicated, as to make all further progress in the operation\r\nnext to impossible.(165) Their employment, especially in a science whose\r\nsphere it is, at present, to increase the number of the facts observed, to\r\nmake them the object of exhaustive investigation, and vary the\r\ncombinations into which they may be made to enter, is a matter of great\r\ndifficulty, if not entirely impossible.(166) For, most assuredly, as our\r\nscience has to do with men, it must take them and treat them as they\r\nactually are, moved at once by very different and non-economic motives,\r\nbelonging to an entirely definite people, state, age etc. The abstraction\r\naccording to which all men are by nature the same, different only in\r\nconsequence of a difference of education, position in life etc., all\r\nequally well equipped, skillful and free in the matter of economic\r\nproduction and consumption, is one which, as Ricardo and von Thünen have\r\nshown, must pass as an indispensable stage in the preparatory labors of\r\npolitical economists. It would be especially well, when an economic fact\r\nis produced by the cooperation of many different factors, for the\r\ninvestigator to mentally isolate the factor of which, for the time being,\r\nhe wishes to examine the peculiar nature. All other factors should, for a\r\ntime, be considered as not operating, and as unchangeable, and then the\r\nquestion asked, What would be the effect of a change in the factor to be\r\nexamined, whether the change be occasioned by enlarging or diminishing it?\r\nBut it never should be lost sight of, that such a one is only an\r\nabstraction after all, for which, not only in the transition to practice,\r\nbut even in finished theory, we must turn to the infinite variety of real\r\nlife.(167)\r\n\r\nThere are two important inquiries in all sciences whose subject matter is\r\nnational or social life: 1. What _is_? (What has been? How did it become\r\nso? etc.) 2. What _should be_? The greater number of political economists\r\nhave confounded these questions one with the other, but not all to the\r\nsame extent.(168)\r\n\r\nWhen a careful distinction is made between them, the contrast between the\r\n(realistic) physiological or historical, and the idealistic methods is\r\nbrought out.(169)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Idealistic Method.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny one who has read a goodly number of idealistic works treating of\r\npublic economy (the state, law etc.) cannot have failed to be struck by\r\nthe enormous differences, and even contradictions, as to what theorizers\r\nhave considered desirable and necessary. There is scarcely an important\r\npoint which the highest authorities may not be cited for or against. We\r\nmust not close our eyes to this fact. “The giddiness that comes from\r\ncontemplating the depths of knowledge is the beginning of philosophy, as\r\nthe god Thaumas was, according to the fable, the father of Iris.”\r\n(_Plato._) In a precisely similar manner, the student of public economy\r\n(politics, the philosophy of law etc.) must familiarize himself with the\r\nvariations that have taken place in what men, at different periods of\r\nhistory, have required of the state and public economy, until he is lost\r\nin wonder at the contemplation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Idealistic Method. (Continued.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to fail to notice at once that those ideal descriptions\r\nwhich have enjoyed great fame and exerted great influence, depart very\r\nlittle from the real conditions of the public economy (of the state, law\r\netc.) surrounding their authors.(170) This is not mere chance. The power\r\nof great theorizers, as, indeed, of all great men, lies, as a rule, in\r\nthis, that they satisfy the want of their own time to an unusual extent;\r\nand it is the peculiar task of theorizers to give expression to this want\r\nwith scientific clearness, and to justify it with scientific depth. But\r\nthe real wants of a people will, in the long run, be satisfied in\r\nlife,(171) so far as this is possible to the moral imperfection of man. We\r\nshould at least be on our guard when we hear it said that whole nations\r\nhave been forced into an “unnatural” course by priests, tyrants and\r\ncavilers. For, to leave human freedom and divine Providence out of\r\nconsideration entirely, how is such a thing possible? The supposed tyrants\r\nare generally part and parcel of the people themselves; all their\r\nresources are derived from the people. They must have been new\r\nArchimedeses standing outside of their own world. (Compare, however,\r\n_infra_, § 263.)\r\n\r\nIt is true, that if the result of the growth of generations be to\r\ngradually produce a different people, these different men may require\r\ndifferent institutions. Then a struggle arises between the old and those\r\nof the younger generation; the former wish to retain what has been tested\r\nby time, the latter to seek for the satisfaction of their new wants by new\r\nmeans. As the sea always oscillates between the flowing and ebbing of the\r\ntides, so the life of nations, between periods of repose and of crisis:\r\nperiods of repose, when existing forms answer to the real substance of\r\nthings, and of crisis, when the changed substance or contents seeks to\r\nbuild up a new form for itself. Such crises are called _reforms_ when they\r\nare effected in a peaceful way, and in accordance with positive law. When\r\naccomplished in violation of law, they are called revolutions.(172)\r\n\r\nThat every revolution, it matters not how great the need of the change\r\nproduced by it, is as such an enormous evil, a serious, and sometimes,\r\nfatal disease of the body politic, is self-evident. The injury to morals\r\nwhich the spectacle of victorious wrong almost always produces can be\r\nhealed, as a rule, only in the following generation. Where law has been\r\nonce trampled on, the “right of the stronger” will prevail; and the\r\nstronger is, to some extent, the most unscrupulous and reckless in the\r\nchoice of the means to be employed. Hence, the well-known fact, that in\r\nrevolutionary times the worst so frequently remain the victors. The\r\ncounter-revolution which is wont to follow on the heels of revolution, and\r\nwith a corresponding violence, is a compensation only to the most\r\nshortsighted. It allows the disease, the familiarizing of the people with\r\nthe infringement of law, to continue, until the hitherto sound parts are\r\nattacked. Hence, a people should, if they would have it go well with them,\r\nin the changes in the form of things which they make, take as their model\r\nTime, whose reforms are the surest and most irresistible, but, at the same\r\ntime, as Bacon says, so gradual that they cannot be seen or observed at\r\nany one moment. It is true, that, as all that is great is difficult, so\r\nalso is the carrying out of uninterrupted reform. Its carrying out,\r\nindeed, supposes two things: a constitution so wisely planned as to keep\r\nthe doors open both to the disappearing institutions of the past and to\r\nthe coming institutions of the future; and, among all classes of the\r\npeople, a moral control of themselves, so absolute that, no matter what\r\nthe inconvenience, or how great the sacrifice, legal ways shall alone be\r\nused. In this manner, two of the greatest and apparently most\r\ncontradictory wants of every legal or moral person, the want of\r\nuninterrupted continuity and that of free development, may be satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section XXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Idealistic Method. (Continued.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is doubtless true that all economic laws, and all economic institutions\r\nare made for the people, not the people for such laws and institutions.\r\nTheir mutability is, therefore, by no means such an evil as mankind should\r\nendeavor to remove, but is wholesome and laudable, so far as it runs\r\nparallel with the transformation of the people, and the changes which\r\ntheir wants have undergone.(173) Hence, there is no reason why the most\r\nvarious ideal systems should contradict one another. Any one of them may\r\nbe right, but, of course, only for one people and one age. In this case,\r\nthe only error would be, if they should claim to be universally\r\napplicable. There can no more be an economic ideal adapted to the various\r\nwants of every people, than a garment which should fit every individual.\r\nThe leading-strings of children and the staff of age would be great\r\nannoyances to the man. “Reason becomes nonsense and beneficence a\r\ntorment.” Hence, whoever would elaborate the ideal of the best public\r\neconomy—and the greater number of political economists have really wished\r\nto do this—should, if he would be perfectly true, and at the same time\r\npractical, place in juxta position as many different ideals as there are\r\ndifferent types of people.(174) He would, moreover, have to revise his\r\nwork every few years; for, in proportion as a people change, and new wants\r\noriginate, the economic ideal suitable to them must change also. But it is\r\nimpossible to accomplish this on so large a scale. Besides, to appreciate\r\nthe present thus instantaneously, and to perfectly feel the pulse of time\r\nthus uninterruptedly, requires a species of talent different from what\r\neven the most distinguished scientists are wont to possess; talents of an\r\nentirely practical nature, such as become a great minister of the interior\r\nor of finance. And it is an acknowledged fact, that even the cleverest of\r\nsuch practicioners, as the younger Pitt said of himself, generally feel\r\ntheir way instinctively, and do not see it with the clearness necessary to\r\nindicate it to others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section XXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Historical Method—The Anatomy And Physiology Of Public Economy.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe refuse entirely to lend ourselves in theory to the construction of such\r\nideal systems. Our aim is simply to describe man’s economic nature and\r\neconomic wants, to investigate the laws and the character of the\r\ninstitutions which are adapted to the satisfaction of these wants, and the\r\ngreater or less amount of success by which they have been attended.(175)\r\nOur task is, therefore, so to speak, the anatomy and physiology of social\r\nor national economy!\r\n\r\nThese are matters to be found within the domain of reality, susceptible of\r\ndemonstration or refutation by the ordinary operations of science;\r\nentirely true or entirely false, and, therefore, in the former case, not\r\nliable to become obsolete. We proceed after the manner of the investigator\r\nof nature. We, too, have our dissecting knife and microscope, and we have\r\nan advantage over the student of nature in this, that the self-observation\r\nof the body is exceedingly limited, while that of mind is almost\r\nunlimited. There are other respects, however, in which he has the\r\nadvantage over us. When he wishes to study a given species, he may make a\r\nhundred or a thousand experiments, and use a hundred or a thousand\r\nindividuals for his purpose. Hence, he can easily control each separate\r\nobservation, and distinguish the exception from the rule. But, how many\r\nnations are there which we can make use of for purposes of comparison?\r\nTheir very fewness makes it all the more imperative to compare them all.\r\nDoubtless, comparison cannot supply the place of observation; but\r\nobservation may be thus rendered more thorough, many-sided, and richer in\r\nthe number of its points of view. Interested alike in the differences and\r\nresemblances, we must first form our rules from the latter, consider the\r\nformer as the exceptions, and then endeavor to explain them. (_Infra_, §\r\n266).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section XXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvantages Of The Historical Or Physiological Method.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thorough application of this method will do away with a great number\r\nof controversies on important questions.(176) Men are as far removed from\r\nbeing devils as from being angels. We meet with few who are only guided by\r\nideal motives, but with few, also, who hearken only to the voice of\r\negotism, and care for nothing but themselves. It may, therefore, be\r\nassumed, that any view current on certain tangible interests which concern\r\nman very nearly, and which has been shared by great parties and even by\r\nwhole peoples for generations, is not based only on ignorance or a\r\nperverse love of wrong. The error consists more frequently in applying\r\nmeasures wholesome and even absolutely necessary under certain\r\ncircumstances, to circumstances entirely different. And here, a thorough\r\ninsight into the conditions of the measure suffices to compose the\r\ndifferences between the two parties. Once the natural laws of Political\r\nEconomy are sufficiently known and recognized, all that is needed, in any\r\ngiven instance, is more exact and reliable statistics of the fact\r\ninvolved, to reconcile all party controversies on questions of the\r\npolitics of public economy, so far, at least, as these controversies arise\r\nfrom a difference of opinion. It may be that science may never attain to\r\nthis, in consequence of the new problems which are ever arising and\r\ndemanding a solution. It may be, too, that in the greater number of party\r\ncontroversies, the opposed purposes of the parties play a more important\r\npart even than the opposed views. Be this as it may, it is necessary,\r\nespecially in an age as deeply agitated as our own, when every good\r\ncitizen is in duty bound to ally himself to party, that every honest\r\nparty-man should seek to secure, amid the ocean of ephemeral opinions, a\r\nfirm island of scientific truth, as universally recognized as truth as are\r\nthe principles of mathematical physics by physicians of the most various\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Section XXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvantages Of The Historical Method. (Continued.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother characteristic feature of the historical method is that it does\r\naway with the feeling of self-sufficiency, and the braggadocio which cause\r\nmost men to ridicule what they do not understand, and the higher to look\r\ndown with contempt on lower civilizations. Whoever is acquainted with the\r\nlaws of the development of the plant, cannot fail to see in the seed the\r\ngerm of its growth, and in its flower, the herald of decay. If there were\r\ninhabitants of the moon, and one of them should visit our earth, and find\r\nchildren and grown people side by side, while ignorant of the laws of\r\nhuman development, would he not look upon the most beautiful child as a\r\nmere monster, with an enormous head, with arms and legs of stunted growth,\r\nuseless genitals, and destitute of reason? The folly of such a judgment\r\nwould be obvious to every one; and yet we meet with thousands like it on\r\nthe state and the public economy of nations when in lower stages of\r\ncivilization, and this, even among the most distinguished writers.(177)\r\n\r\nWe may, indeed, make a critical comparison of different forms, each of\r\nwhich answers perfectly to its object or contents; but such a comparison\r\ncan possess historical objectivity, only when it is based on a correct\r\nview of the peculiar course of development followed by the people in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThe forms of the period of maturity may be considered the most perfect;\r\nearlier forms as the immature, and the later as those of the age of\r\ndecline.(178) But it is a matter of the greatest difficulty, accurately to\r\ndetermine the culminating point of a people’s civilization. The old man\r\nbelieves, as a rule, that the times are growing worse, because he is no\r\nlonger in a way to utilize them; the young man, as a rule, that they are\r\ngrowing better, because he hopes to turn them to account. It is, however,\r\nalways a purely empirical question; and in the solution of it, the\r\nobserver’s eye may acquire a singular acuteness by the comparative study\r\nof as many nations as possible, especially of those which have already\r\npassed away.(179)\r\n\r\nCould anyone contemplate the history of mankind as a a whole, of which the\r\nhistories of individual nations are but the parts, the successive steps in\r\nthe evolution of humanity would of course afford him a similar objective\r\nrule for all these points in which whole peoples permanently differ from\r\none another.(180)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section XXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Practical Character Of The Historical Method In Political Economy.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore I close, I must refer to a possible objection which may be made to\r\nhistorical or physiological Political Economy: that it may indeed be\r\ntaught, but that it cannot be a practical science. If it be assumed that\r\nthose principles only are practical, which may be applied immediately by\r\nevery reader, in practice, this work must disclaim all pretensions to that\r\ntitle. I doubt very much if, in this sense, there is a single science\r\nsusceptible of a practical exposition.(181) Genuine practitioners, who\r\nknow life with its thousands of relations by experience, will be the first\r\nto grant that such a collection of prescriptions, when the question is the\r\nknowledge and guidance of men, would be misleading and dangerous in\r\nproportion as such prescriptions were positive and apodictic, that is\r\nnon-practical and doctrinarian.\r\n\r\nOur endeavor has been, not to write a practical book, but to train our\r\nreaders to be practical. To this end, we have sought to describe the laws\r\nof nature which man cannot control, but, at most, only utilize. We call\r\nthe attention of the reader to the different points of view, from which\r\nevery economic fact must be observed, to do justice to every claim. We\r\nwould like to accustom the reader, when he is examining the most\r\ninsignificant politico-economical fact, never to lose sight of the whole,\r\nnot only of public economy but of national life. We are very strongly of\r\nthe opinion, that only he can form a correct judgment and defend his views\r\nagainst all objections, on such questions as to where, how and when\r\ncertain liens and charges, monopolies, privileges, services etc., should\r\nbe abolished, who fully understands why they were once imposed or\r\nintroduced. Especially, do we not desire to impress a certain number of\r\nrules of action on those who have confided themselves to our guidance,\r\nafter having first demonstrated their excellence. Our highest ambition is\r\nto put our readers in a way to discover such rules of direction for\r\nthemselves, after they have conscientiously weighed all the facts,\r\nuntrammeled by any earthly authority whatever.(182)(183)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Book I.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRODUCTION OF GOODS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Chapter I.\r\n\r\n\r\nFactors Of Production.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section XXX.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeaning Of Production.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo create new matter is more than it is given to man to do. Hence, by the\r\nterm production, in its widest sense, we mean simply the bringing forth of\r\nnew goods—the discovery of new utilities, the change or transformation of\r\nalready existing goods into new utilities,(184) the creation of means for\r\nthe satisfaction of human wants, out of the aggregate of matter originally\r\npresent in the world. (_Producere!_) We confine ourselves, however, in\r\nthis to economic goods, as defined in § 2. In a secondary and more limited\r\nsense, production is an increase of resources, in so far as the goods\r\nproduced satisfy a greater human want, than those employed in the\r\nproduction itself.(185)(186)(187)\r\n\r\nIt would, however, be an error to suppose, that the creation of certain\r\nutilities for the producer himself, or for others, constitutes the only\r\nend of economic production. The more perfect economic production becomes,\r\nthe greater grows the pleasure the producer feels in his products, which\r\npleasure is at once the effect and the cause of his success. Hence,\r\nproduction is to a great extent its own end. That this is so in the case\r\nof artists is well known. “If you want only progeny from her, a mortal can\r\nbeget them as well. Let him who rejoices in the goddess, not seek in her\r\nthe woman,” says Schiller. There is not a really clever workman but has\r\nsomething artistic in his mode of production. And even the meanest\r\nproductive activity, provided it is neither over-driven nor misdirected,\r\nmust of itself exert a good influence on the physical and moral\r\ndevelopment or preservation of the producer. An idle brain is the devil’s\r\nworkshop.(188)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section XXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Factors Of Production.—External Nature.(189)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe division of natural forces which formerly obtained, into organic,\r\nchemical and mechanical, is of no great importance in Political Economy.\r\nThe tendency is more and more to resolve organic forces partly into\r\nchemical and partly into mechanical. Between mechanical and chemical\r\nforces, again, the boundary is not fixed, heat being always capable of\r\nproducing motion, and motion always of producing heat. Hence, it is all\r\nthe more important for us to find a division of the economic gifts\r\n(matter, forces(190) and relations) of external nature, into such as are\r\ncapable of acquiring exchange value, and such as are not. (See § 5.)\r\n\r\nA. Those gifts of nature which, because they cannot be appropriated by any\r\none, or which at least are inexhaustible as compared with the wants of\r\nman, and therefore never have a direct value in exchange, belong either to\r\nthe class of _free_ goods, in the fullest sense of the word, as, for\r\ninstance, sunlight and the atmosphere (_supra_, § 5);(191) or they\r\nconstitute, by reason of their peculiar and intransmissible connection\r\nwith the whole country, an essential element of the national resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section XXXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nExternal Nature.—The Sea.—Climate.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the last category belongs, for instance, the sea, the only natural\r\nboundary of a country, which from a military point of view, constitutes a\r\nprotection to it, without, at the same time, disturbing peaceful traffic.\r\n(_Riedel._) Here, also belong ocean currents, especially when uniformly\r\nsupported by regular winds,(192) the ebb and flow of the tides, which\r\nconstitute a piece of commercial machinery of the very greatest\r\nimportance, particularly when they affect the waters of rivers to a great\r\ndistance.(193) In this age, when the love of travel is so great and so\r\nuniversal, what prices are paid in many places by strangers for the beauty\r\nof a landscape, to its owner.\r\n\r\nSpecial mention should be here made of climate, and of its heat or\r\nmoisture. The lines called isothermal, that is, lines of equal annual\r\nheat, are, therefore, of greatest importance to public economy, because\r\nthe “zones of production” depend mainly on them.(194) However, we are\r\nconcerned here, not only with the average temperature of the whole year,\r\nbut especially with the distribution of heat among the several parts of\r\nthe day and the different seasons of the year, and the maximum summer heat\r\nand winter cold (the isothermal and iso-cheimenal lines). Coast lands are\r\nwont to have a milder winter and a cooler summer than continental ones\r\nwith an equal average yearly heat. This produces a great difference in\r\nvegetation, because there are a great many plants which can endure the\r\nwinter’s cold very well, but require a hot summer; and _vice versa_.(195)\r\nWere it not for this fact, in connection with the winter-sleep of plants,\r\na large portion of the north would be entirely uninhabitable. Besides, the\r\ntemperature of a place does not depend exclusively on its latitude, or on\r\nits height above the sea-level.(196) The humidity of the climate is, as a\r\nrule, great in proportion to the quantity of water in its neighborhood,\r\nand to the height of its temperature; although, for instance, in Europe,\r\nthe number of rainy days increases, the further we advance towards the\r\nnorth.(197) Although the distance of a place from the equator and its\r\nheight above the level of the sea have, in many respects, a similar effect\r\n(vertical, horizontal isothermal lines and zones of production),\r\nmountainous regions are uniformly distinguished by a greater degree of\r\nhumidity, which makes them better adapted for pasturage and\r\nforest-culture. But the flora of a locality, being the resultant of all\r\nits conditions, affords us a much better criterion of the value of the\r\nclimate for economic purposes, than the most accurate thermometric\r\nobservations. Other things being equal, the productive force of nature\r\noperates, doubtless, with most energy, in warm climates. The more remote a\r\ncountry is from the equator, the more is its fertility confined to its\r\nlowest parts.(198) Greater heat will, as a rule, ripen the same product\r\nsooner, and thus permit the same land to be used several times in the same\r\nyear.(199) Each individual harvest, as a rule, is more abundant,(200) and\r\nthe products better in many respects. The fruit, for instance, and wine,\r\ncontain more sugar,(201) and oleaginous plants contain more oil. Lastly,\r\nsince nature in warm countries is so much more generous, it may be\r\nutilized by man with less regard for consequences. There is less need of\r\nextensive woods, of large winter supplies, especially for animals;(202)\r\nfewer buildings are demanded, and there is also less demand for human and\r\nbrute labor, since the work of plowing, sowing etc., extends over a\r\ngreater portion of the year.(203) It is true, on the other hand, that also\r\nthe destructive force of nature is greater in warmer than in colder\r\ncountries. (§ 209.)(204)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Section XXXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nExternal Nature.—Gifts Of Nature With Value In Exchange.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Those gifts of external nature which may become objects of private\r\nproperty, and at the same time possess sufficient relative scarcity to\r\ngive them value in exchange, are either movable, and exhaustible in a\r\ngiven place, or firmly connected with the land. The first category\r\nembraces, for instance, such wild animals and plants as serve some useful\r\npurpose, minerals, above all, fossil combustible matter(205)—the “black\r\ndiamonds,” coal, of which, with its canals, Franklin said that it had made\r\nEngland what it is. The economical effect of their moveable character is\r\nbest seen, when the use made of an ordinary stratum of coal is compared\r\nwith that of a protracted subterranean fire in a coal mine.(206) The\r\nlatter can be directly useful only to those in its immediate vicinity.\r\nEvery lower layer of the burning coal would be less useful. An increase of\r\nits actual power by accumulation in time or place is scarcely possible. In\r\nall these respects, the movable coal is incomparably better adapted to the\r\nsatisfaction of man’s wants. It may be said that the capacity of heat for\r\ndrying, distilling, melting and hardening purposes, of imparting rapid\r\nmotion to heavy objects by the production of confined steam, is, at least,\r\na thousand times as great when a thousand bushels of coal are consumed as\r\nwhen one is consumed. In most cases even the concentration of a large\r\nquantity of coal will increase, the result not only absolutely, but\r\nrelatively.(207)(208)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section XXXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nExternal Nature. (Continued.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe materials, forces and relations or conditions of external nature,\r\nimmovably connected with parts of the land, even when in themselves\r\nexhaustless, either allow only of a definite amount of economic\r\nutilization, as, for instance, the mechanical force of a given waterfall,\r\nwhich can drive only a definite number of mills of a definite size;(209)\r\nor their increased utilization is accompanied by difficulties which\r\nincrease with still greater rapidity. This last is the case, especially in\r\nthe employment of land for agricultural purposes. It is, according to\r\nSenior, one of the four fundamental axioms of Political Economy, that\r\nadditional labor, spent on a given quantity of land, produces, as a rule,\r\na relatively smaller yield; assuming, of course, that the art of\r\nagriculture remains the same. It is not possible to determine either\r\ngenerally, or in particular cases, the precise point at which agriculture\r\nshould stop, to prevent relatively smaller returns from increased\r\nexpenditure of labor and capital. Improvements in the art of agriculture\r\nmay remove it a great distance. But, that there is such a point admits of\r\nno doubt. No one will believe that an acre of land can be made to produce\r\na quantity of the means of subsistence sufficient to support all Europe,\r\nno matter what the amount of seed used, or of manure etc. employed.(210)\r\nThis is most apparent in forest-economy, where the absolute increase of\r\nthe so-called wood-capital becomes, after a certain time, smaller from\r\nyear to year.(211)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section XXXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nExternal Nature.—Elements Of Agricultural Productiveness.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn treating of the agricultural productiveness of a piece of land, it is\r\nnecessary to distinguish three things,—its bearing-capacity, its capacity\r\nfor cultivation, and its direct capacity to afford food to plants.(212)\r\nPlants grow by drawing a part of the elements which enter into their\r\ncomposition from the atmosphere, and a part from the earth through the\r\nagencies of sunlight and of water. While the air, the sun’s heat, and in\r\nmost parts of the world, water, are free and inexhaustible goods, the\r\nearth’s supply of food for plants must be considered as analogous, so far\r\nas its exhaustibility and capacity to be appropriated are concerned, to\r\nthe beds of coal and of ore etc. which occur in mining districts. This is\r\ncertainly true, with a few important differences, however, as for\r\ninstance, that, as a rule, it is impossible, except through the\r\ncultivation of plants, to obtain from the earth the stores of plant food\r\nwhich it contains;(213) and that it is possible to husbandry to replace\r\nthe portion of these stores taken from the earth by the harvest, through\r\nthe agency of manures.(214)\r\n\r\nIncomparably more important in the economic valuation of a piece of land\r\nis its capacity for cultivation, because this depends much less on the\r\ngood or bad quality of the husbandman’s art. I mean here the so-called\r\nphysical constitution of the vegetable soil; its water-holding power, its\r\nconsistency (light or heavy soil) on which the difficulty of working it\r\ndepends; its ability to dry, in a shorter or longer time, and its\r\naccompanying diminution in volume; its ability to draw moisture from the\r\natmosphere and to absorb the various kinds of gases; its heat-absorbing\r\nand heat-containing power (hot, warm and cold soils).(215) Much depends\r\nhere on the depth of the vegetable soil and on the constitution of the\r\nsub-soil, which, for instance, when it is very permeable, improves a very\r\nmoist soil, but in the form of meadow iron-ore (_Wiesenerz_), works great\r\ninjury. The vertical form of the land is also a very important element in\r\nestimating the natural fertility of the soil. In mountainous districts,\r\nthe quantity of land which can be used (and with what labor!) is wont to\r\nbe relatively smaller than in low lands. Hence it is, that the former\r\nbecome too small for their inhabitants; who, therefore, swarm over the\r\nplains lying before them either as settlers or conquerors.(216) In the\r\neastern hemisphere, the northern slopes of mountain regions are most\r\nunfavorably situated, although the southern slopes are frequently\r\nsubjected to more trying and more sudden variations of thawing and\r\nfreezing weather.(217)\r\n\r\nBut all these more special qualities of the soil must be distinguished\r\nfrom their general basis, the bearing or carrying capacity which land\r\npossesses as a mere superficies, and which the most naked rock (Malta!),\r\nand the bed of a flowing stream (the floating gardens of China!) possess\r\nto some extent, since there is a possibility of establishing a\r\nplant-feeding surface on them. This bearing capacity, which in most\r\ninstances is given only by nature, and which can be added to only to a\r\nvery limited extent and at great outlay, is wont, when the population is\r\nvery dense, to acquire considerable exchange value in the\r\nvicinity.(218)(219)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section XXXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nExternal Nature.—Further Divisions Of Nature’s Gifts.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gifts of nature, we further divide into those which can be directly\r\nenjoyed and those which are of use only indirectly, by facilitating\r\nproduction. (Natural means of enjoyment,—means of acquisition.)(220) An\r\nextreme superfluity of the former is as disastrous to civilization as a\r\ntoo great scarcity of them. How simple the economy of a tropical country!\r\nA banana field will support twenty-five times as many men as a wheat field\r\n(_K. Ritter_); and with infinitely less labor; for all that is needed is\r\nto cut the stems with their ripened fruit, to loosen the earth a little\r\nand very superficially, when new stems shoot up.(221) At the base of the\r\nmountains of Mexico, a father needs labor only two days in the week to\r\nsupport his family. Hence, nothing so much excites the wonder of the\r\ntraveler there as the diminutiveness of the cultivated ground surrounding\r\neach Indian hut.(222) But in these earthly paradises, where, as Byron\r\nsaid, even bread is gathered like fruit, the powers of man slumber as\r\ncertainly as they grow torpid in polar deserts.(223) The sentence: “In the\r\nsweat of thy brow shalt thou eat bread,” has been a blessing to mankind.\r\nAthens was not only the literary and political, but also the economic\r\ncapital of Greece; and yet Attica was one of the most sterile countries in\r\nthe world.(224) Unfortunate Messina, on the other hand, was the most\r\nfertile province of Greece. In modern times, no countries of equal extent\r\nhave produced as many great captains, statesmen, savants and artists as\r\nHolland, whose securest portions are as unfertile as those which are\r\nfertile are threatened by the sea. On the other hand, how lately and\r\nimperfectly has the so-called black-earth of southern Russia fallen under\r\nthe influence of civilization!(225)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Section XXXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nExternal Nature.—The Geographical Character Of A Country.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe geographical character of a country is, as a rule,(226) most\r\nintimately connected, not only with its flora and fauna, but also with the\r\ncharacter of its people. One of the crowning glories of the progress of\r\nmodern science is, that it has recognized anew the power of this wonderful\r\norganism, and that it has made geography an explanatory medium between\r\nnature and history. The conditions most favorable to the development of\r\ncivilization are found in a well developed country which slopes gradually\r\nthrough a series of intermediate terraces from a mountain summit to a\r\nplain; especially when they are connected with one another by a good\r\nsystem of streams; since here the opposite peculiarities of the\r\npopulations of the highlands and coast-lands(227) tend to produce a\r\nnationality both one and varied. Where the transitions are too abrupt, as\r\nfor instance, in New Holland, they easily impede inter-communication; and,\r\nstill more, where the several parts of the country are of very great\r\nextent; as, for example, the desert of North Africa, the plateau of South\r\nAfrica or that of Central Asia. Europe is favored above all other parts of\r\nthe world by the happy combination of mountain and plain.(228) We might\r\npursue the parallel existing between the soil and the character of a\r\npeople into the minutest details, and discover, even in the difference\r\nbetween Spanish, French, German and Hungarian wines, a reflection of the\r\ndifferent characters of the people.(229)\r\n\r\nBut whence is this? Can it be that dead nature has thus irresistibly\r\naffected the living mind? We do not need to give a materialistic answer to\r\nthe question.(230) Almost every people has migrated at some period of its\r\nexistence. Urged on by their peculiar tastes and tendencies, they settled\r\nin the places most in harmony with their character. A higher hand was over\r\nthem; one which, we should unreservedly trust, placed them in such\r\nexternal circumstances as were most favorable to the development of all\r\ntheir faculties.\r\n\r\nBut the influences of man on nature are no less notable than those of\r\nnature upon man. The greater number of domestic animals and plants which\r\nEurope possesses to-day, it has been obliged to introduce from other parts\r\nof the globe.(231) In the interior of Gaul, the vine rarely ripened, at\r\nthe time of Christ.(232) On the other hand, Mesopotamia, formerly one of\r\nthe gardens of the world, is now covered with dried-up canals, filled a\r\nlittle below the surface with heaps of brick and broken vases, the remains\r\nand other vestiges of a once dense population. Its former rich alluvial\r\nsoil, now almost calcined, produces at present scarcely anything except a\r\nfew saline plants, mimosas etc.(233) The higher the civilization of a\r\npeople, the less does it depend on the nature of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Section XXXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf Labor.—Divisions Of Labor.\r\n\r\n\r\nMan’s capacity for most economic labor is so closely connected with the\r\nexquisite articulation of the human hand, that Buffon could say without\r\nexaggeration that reason and the hand made man man.(234) But it is true of\r\neconomic labor, as of all other labor, that it is more efficient in\r\nproportion as mind predominates over matter.\r\n\r\nThe best division of economic labor is the following:(235)\r\n\r\nA. Discoveries and inventions.(236)\r\n\r\nB. Occupation of the spontaneous gifts of nature, as, for instance, of\r\nwild plants, wild animals, and of minerals.(237) Where this is the only\r\nkind of economic labor, man is necessarily dependent on nature in a high\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nC. The production of raw materials; that is, a direction given to nature\r\nin order to the production of raw materials, by stock-raising,\r\nagriculture, forest-culture etc., but not by mining.\r\n\r\nD. The transformation (_Verarbeitung_) of raw material by means of\r\nmanufactories, factories, the trades etc.\r\n\r\nE. The distribution of stores of goods among those who are to use them\r\ndirectly, whether from people to people or from place to place\r\n(wholesale), or among the individuals of the same place (retail).(238) To\r\nthis class also belong leasing, renting, loaning, etc.\r\n\r\nF. Services, in the more limited sense of the term, which embraces\r\npersonal as well as incorporeal goods; as, for instance, the labors of the\r\ndoctor, teacher; virtuoso, of the statesman, judge, and of preachers,\r\nwhose office it is, by way of eminence, to produce and preserve the\r\nimmaterial wealth, known as the State and the Church.(239)\r\n\r\nThe order followed in the above classification is that in which the\r\ndifferent classes of labor are wont to be historically developed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section XXXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nLabor.—Taste For Labor.—Piece-Wages.\r\n\r\n\r\nMan’s taste for labor is conditioned especially by the extent to which,\r\nand the security with which, he may hope to enjoy the fruit of his labor\r\nhimself. Hence it is that, as a rule, the slave (§ 71, ff.) and socager\r\nwork least willingly, the day laborer with less industry than the\r\npiece-worker,(240) who is at the same time more satisfied with himself,\r\nand gives most satisfaction to his master,(241) since he acquires more\r\nboth for himself and for his master. The superiority of piece-paid labor\r\nis greater in proportion as the workman calculates his own advantage. It\r\nis, therefore, smallest in the case of ingenuous uneducated workmen, and\r\nin that of the really conscientious.(242) The fear of seeing one’s\r\ncondition grow worse, through want of industry, exerts an influence\r\nprecisely similar to the hope of improving it. In both respects, free\r\ncompetition (§ 97) must be considered one of the principal means of\r\nfurthering the taste for labor.(243)\r\n\r\nAmong the causes which have contributed to make England the first country\r\nin the world, viewed from a politico-economical stand-point, English\r\nwriters on Political Economy have pointed out as one of the principal, the\r\nprevalence there of piece-wages.(244) Payment by the piece should, of\r\ncourse, be practiced, only in cases in which the work may be broken up\r\ninto a series of isolated tasks, and is completed by such a series. Hence,\r\nit is not applicable where a great many different things are required of\r\nthe same workman; nor in relations in which continuity, as, for instance,\r\nof the inclination or disposition of the workman is the chief thing.(245)\r\nThe further the division of labor is carried in our day, the greater the\r\npart money plays in our social economy, and the more lasting relations are\r\ndissolved, the more general becomes piece-work, which, with all its\r\nmaterial advantages, has, speaking morally, its dark side.\r\n(_Atomism!_)(246) In a great many branches of manufactures it has been\r\nrelinquished because the excellence of his work suffered from the\r\nworkman’s haste, and because he could not be properly controlled.(247) It\r\nis rather the quantity than the quality of work which increases with\r\npiece-work, and where the quality of the work is what is desired, this\r\nsystem has not the same field. And where it obtains, as, for instance, in\r\nthe case of ordinary type-setters, resort is had to payment by the day for\r\ncompositors engaged on mathematical treatises, fac-similes, inscriptions\r\netc. On the side of the workman, it is generally only the idle and awkward\r\nwho oppose piece-work on principle. It is a subject of regret that the\r\nbest and most industrious workmen are carried away by it to an extent\r\ndetrimental to their health.(248) However, many of the deficiencies of the\r\npiece-wage principle may be removed by agreements made with whole groups\r\nof workmen; provided, always, that the groups are not too large to prevent\r\nthe mutual knowledge and surveillance of their members.(249) The quantity\r\nof work is greatest, its quality best, and the material(250) employed used\r\nmost sparingly, when the workman works on his own account, or has a share\r\nin the profits. This last is proper only in those branches of the business\r\nthe success of which depends on the quality of the work. To compel the\r\nworkman to share in the profits alone will not do, because he is generally\r\ntoo poor to run any risk or to do long without his earnings. The system of\r\npaying “commissions,” therefore, is to be recommended all the more\r\nstrongly, since it is a combination of fixed wages with a share in the\r\nprofits. This system is very prevalent in North America, where a great\r\ndeal has to be confided to the workmen. It is practiced, also, in the\r\nwhale fisheries, and on the Greek ships in the Levant engaged in coasting,\r\nwhere much more depends on the care of the sailors than on the ability of\r\nthe captain.(251) It presupposes good workmen, equal almost to their\r\nmaster in education,(252) for instance, in the case of overseers of labor;\r\nsince every better inducement to the taste for labor which is not only\r\njuster but more complicative, is not only a condition but also the effect\r\nof higher culture. But if the economy of a people is ripe for share-wages,\r\nand masters begin to introduce them in earnest in individual cases, the\r\nwork produced will be improved to such a degree that it can not be long\r\nbefore all others will be necessitated to follow them.(253)\r\n\r\nIf,  however, workmen are to enjoy the fruit of their industry, it is\r\nnecessary, first of all, that public order should be secure. Even the most\r\nindustrious become discouraged where despotism or anarchy prevails. On the\r\nother hand, even the greatest security is no sufficient incentive to a\r\nnation of fatalists.(254)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section XL.\r\n\r\n\r\nLabor.—Labor-Power Of Individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe average labor-power of individuals varies very much in different\r\nnations.(255) The reason of this is, in part, doubtless a difference in\r\nnatural endowments. Thus, for instance, no people surpass the English and\r\nAnglo-American in energy, none the German in intelligence in work or the\r\nFrench in taste. Where we can assume that the same meaning is attached to\r\nthe expression, “military capacity,” by the different recruiting bureaus,\r\nimportant conclusions as to the physical labor-power of different\r\nlocalities may be drawn from the ratio existing between the number of\r\nthose fit for military service and those who are legally liable to\r\nmilitary duty.(256)\r\n\r\nBut these conclusions are greatly modified by the state of civilization\r\nand that of society. Where the laboring classes are despised and paid in a\r\nmanner unworthy of human beings, the badness of their work will be in\r\nkeeping with the estimation in which it is held. The reverse of this,\r\nalso, is usually true under different circumstances. (§ 173.) Thus, it has\r\nbeen noticed in France, that native workmen, provided with as substantial\r\nfood as English workmen, are scarcely inferior to the the latter in the\r\ntechnic value of their labor.(257) A Mecklenburg day laborer eats almost\r\ntwice as much as a Thuringian workman, but then he accomplishes almost\r\ntwice as much. Hence, employers gain in the long run by paying their\r\nworkmen well. As civilization advances, the same number of workmen become,\r\nnot only more industrious and more capable, but the same quantity and\r\nquality of labor becomes, as a rule, cheaper.(258)\r\n\r\nThe moral culture of a people exerts the greatest influence here. In every\r\nprivate undertaking, a great part of the expense attending it, and in\r\nevery state, a great part of the expense of its police system, and of its\r\nsystem of administering justice, is occasioned only by the dishonesty of\r\nmen. If all this expense could be dispensed with, and full confidence\r\nplaced in individuals, it would be possible to devote much more time and\r\nenergy to positively useful labor.(259) In estimating the labor-power of\r\ndifferent nations or different periods of time, the division of population\r\naccording to age is also of importance. As a rule, the labor-power of\r\nmales is greatest from the age of twenty-five to the age of forty-five.\r\nThe more numerous, therefore, the class of the population between these\r\nages is, the more favorably, other things being equal, is it situated as\r\nregards labor.(260)(261) But, as a rule, the relative number of full-grown\r\npeople is greatest in highly civilized nations. (§ 248.)(262)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section XLI.\r\n\r\n\r\nLabor.—Effect Of The Esteem In Which It Is Held.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs civilization advances, labor becomes more honorable. All barbarous\r\nnations despise it as slavish. _Pigrum et iners videtur sudore adquirere\r\nquod possis sanguine parare_: has been the motto of all medieval times. In\r\nheathen Iceland, the owner of a piece of land might be deprived of it by\r\nan adversary who could overpower him in single combat. This mode of\r\nacquisition was considered more honorable than purchase. It was Thor’s own\r\nform of investiture. The ideas of the Romans on rightful acquisition may\r\nbe inferred from the word _mancipium_ (manu capere).(263) Pure\r\nChristianity, on the other hand, preached the honorableness of labor from\r\nthe first (Thess. 4, 11; II. Thess. 3, 8 seq.; Eph. 4, 28). And so in the\r\ntime of the Reformation,(264) when Christendom was returning to its\r\nprimitive purity.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with this is the fact, that the most cultivated nations, and\r\nthe same may be said of individuals, value time most highly. “Time is\r\nmoney.” (_Benjamin Franklin._) An English proverb calls time the stuff of\r\nwhich life is made.(265) While in negro nations, individuals do not even\r\nknow their own age; while in Russia, there are very few clocks to strike\r\nthe hours, even in the towers of churches, in England, a watch is\r\nconsidered an indispensable article of apparel, even for very young people\r\nand for some of the lower orders of society.(266) Railroads operate in\r\nthis respect as a kind of national clock. The introduction of machinery\r\nand the more minute division of labor, make punctuality a necessity. While\r\nSouth Americans and West Indians are frightfully careless in their every\r\nmovement, a carelessness which betrays itself even in their drawling\r\nspeech,(267) the life of a New Englander has been compared to the rush of\r\na locomotive. In the markets of Central Asia, nothing strikes the European\r\nwith so much surprise as the little value put upon time by the merchants\r\nof India and Bucharia, who are fully satisfied when, after endless\r\nwaiting, they succeed in obtaining a somewhat higher price for their\r\nwares.(268)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section XLII.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf Capital.—The Classes Of Goods Of Which A Nation’s Capital Is Made Up.\r\n\r\n\r\nCapital(269) we call every product laid by for purposes of further\r\nproduction. (§ 220).(270)\r\n\r\nHence, the capital of a nation consists especially of the following\r\nclasses of goods:\r\n\r\nA. _Soil-improvements_, for instance, drainage and irrigation works,\r\ndikes, hedges etc., which are, indeed, sometimes so far part of the land\r\nitself that it is difficult to distinguish them from it.(271) To this\r\nclass belong all permanent plantations.\r\n\r\nB. _Buildings_, which embrace workshops and storehouses as well as\r\ndwellings; also artificial roads of all kinds.\r\n\r\nC. _Tools, machines and utensils_ of every description;(272) the latter\r\nespecially for personal service, and for the preservation and\r\ntransportation of other goods. A machine is distinguished from a tool in\r\nthat the moving power of the former is not communicated to it immediately\r\nby the human body, which only directs it; while the latter serves as a\r\nspecies of equipment, or as a better substitute for some member of man’s\r\nbody.(273) To be of advantage, these three kinds of capital must save more\r\nlabor or fatigue than it has cost to produce them. Tools are, however,\r\nolder than machines. The aborigines of Australia used only a lance and a\r\nclub in hunting; the somewhat more civilized American Indians, the bow and\r\narrow; Europeans use firearms: in all of which a gradual progress is\r\nobservable. Of the blind forces which communicate motion to machines,\r\nwater was the first used, then the wind, and last of all, steam.(274)\r\n\r\nD. _Useful and laboring animals_, in so far as they are raised, fed and\r\ndeveloped by human care.\r\n\r\nE. _Materials for transformation_ (_Verwandlungsstoffe_): either the\r\nprincipal material which constitutes the essential substance of a new\r\nproduct, the yarn of the weaver for instance, the raw wool, silk or cotton\r\nof the spinner; or the secondary material which, indeed, enters into the\r\nwork, but only for purposes of ornamentation, as gold-leaf, lac, colors\r\netc.\r\n\r\nF. _Auxiliary substances_, which are consumed in production, but do not\r\nconstitute a visible part of the raw product,(275) as coal in a smithy,\r\npowder in the chase or in mining, muriatic acid, in the preparation of\r\ngelatin, chlorine in bleaching etc.\r\n\r\nG. _Means of subsistence_ for the producers, which are advanced to them\r\nuntil production is complete.\r\n\r\nH. _Commercial stock_, which the merchant keeps always on hand to meet the\r\nwants of his customers.\r\n\r\nI. _Money_ as the principal tool in every trade that is made.\r\n\r\nK. There is also what may be called _incorporeal capital_ (quasi-capital\r\naccording to _Schmitthenner_), which is as much the result of production\r\nas any other capital, and is used in production, but which, for the most\r\npart, is not exhausted by use. There are species of this kind of capital\r\nwhich may be transferred, as for instance, the good will of a\r\nwell-established firm. Others are as inseparably connected with human\r\ncapacity for labor as soil-improvements with a piece of land; e.g., the\r\ngreater dexterity acquired by a workman through scientific study, or the\r\ngreater confidence he has acquired by long trial.(276) The state itself is\r\nthe most important incorporeal capital of every nation, since it is\r\nclearly indispensable, at least indirectly, to economic production.(277)\r\n\r\nThe greater portion of the national capital is in a state of constant\r\ntransformation. It is being continually destroyed and reproduced. But from\r\nthe stand-point of private economy, as well as from that of the whole\r\npeople, we say that capital is preserved, increased or diminished\r\naccording as its value is preserved, increased or diminished.(278)\r\n_Pretium succedit in locum roi et res in locum pretii._ “The greater part\r\nin value of the wealth now existing in England, has been produced by human\r\nhands within the last twelve months. A very small proportion indeed of\r\nthat large aggregate was in existence ten years ago; of the present\r\nproductive capital of the country, scarcely any part except farm-houses\r\nand a few ships and machines; and even these would not, in most cases,\r\nhave survived so long, if fresh labor had not been employed within that\r\nperiod in putting them into repair.... Capital is kept in existence from\r\nage to age like population, not by preservation, but by reproduction.”\r\n(_J. S. Mill_.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section XLIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nCapital.—Productive Capital.\r\n\r\n\r\nCapital, according to the employment that can be given it, may be divided\r\ninto such as affects the production of material goods, and such as affects\r\npersonal goods or useful relations. The former, under the name of\r\nproductive capital, is, in recent politico-economical literature, usually\r\nopposed to capital in use.(279) Evidently any one of the two kinds of\r\ncapital mentioned above, may be used for both purposes.(280) Indeed, the\r\ntwo classes are, in many respects, coincident. Thus, a livery-stable\r\ncarriage or a circulating library is productive capital to its proprietor,\r\nand capital in use(281) (_Gebrauchskapital_) to the nation in general;\r\nalthough the circulating library from which an Arkwright obtains technic\r\ninformation, or the livery-stable vehicle which carries a Borsig to his\r\ncounting-room, has certainly been used in the production of material\r\ngoods. Almost all capital in use may be converted into productive capital,\r\nand hence, the former might be called quiescent capital, and the latter\r\nworking capital.(282) One of the principal differences between productive\r\ncapital and capital in use is, that the former, even when most judiciously\r\nemployed, does not so immediately replace itself, as the latter, by its\r\nreturns.(283) On the other hand, the real dividing line between capital in\r\nuse, and objects consumed which are not capital, is, and it is in complete\r\nharmony with our definition of capital, that the latter are subject not\r\nonly to a more speedy destruction and one which is always contemplated,\r\nwhile in the case of the former, its destruction is only the unintended\r\nreverse-side of its use.\r\n\r\nAmong a highly civilized people, a great amount of capital in use, as\r\ncompared with the productive capital of the country, may be considered a\r\nsure sign of great wealth. When this is the case, the people, without\r\nlosing the desire of further acquisition, think that they have enough to\r\nrichly enjoy the present. I need only call to mind the munificence\r\ndisplayed by the middle classes in England, in their silver plate and\r\nother domestic utensils. But the people of Russia, and Mexico also, can\r\nmake no mean display of silverware.(284) Here luxury is only a symptom of\r\nthe disinclination or inability of the inhabitants of the country to use\r\ntheir capital in the production of wealth. How much richer would Spain be\r\nto-day, if it had employed the idle capital spent in the ornamentation of\r\nits churches in constructing roads and canals!(285) Most nations in a low\r\nstate of civilization suffer from the absence of legal guarantees. Each\r\none is compelled to turn his property into a shape in which it can be most\r\neasily transferred from one place to another and hidden. This is the\r\nprincipal reason why the Orientals possess, relatively speaking, so many\r\nprecious stones and so much of the precious metals. The same cause\r\naccounts for the simplicity of their dwellings.(286) On the other hand,\r\nproductive capital is to be found in the greatest proportion among\r\ncivilized nations which are making very rapid strides towards wealth, the\r\npeople of the United States, for instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section XLIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nCapital.—Fixed Capital, And Circulating Capital.\r\n\r\n\r\nCapital, according as it is employed, is divided into fixed capital and\r\ncirculating capital. Fixed capital may be used many times in production by\r\nits owner; circulating capital only once. The value of the latter kind of\r\ncapital passes wholly into the value of the new product. In the case of\r\nthe former kind of capital, only the value of its use passes into the new\r\nproduct. (_Hermann._) Hence, the farmer’s beasts of burthen belong to his\r\nfixed capital; their food, and his cattle intended for the slaughter, to\r\nhis circulating capital. In a manufactory of machines, a boiler intended\r\nfor sale is circulating capital; while a similar one, held in reserve for\r\nthe machines used in production, is fixed capital. Ricardo attributes a\r\nsomewhat different meaning to these two terms: he calls fixed capital that\r\nwhich is slowly consumed, and circulating, that which disappears\r\nrapidly.(287) Fixed capital is, indeed, produced and preserved by\r\ncirculating capital; but it is, for the most part, transformed again into\r\ncirculating capital.(288) Besides, it is only by means of the latter, that\r\nthe former can be productively employed.(289) The relative importance of\r\nfixed and circulating capital to a country depends upon whether the\r\ncountry is an advanced or only an advancing one. A people with very much\r\nand very fixed capital are indeed very rich; but run the risk of offering\r\nmany vulnerable points to an aggressive enemy, and of thus turning the\r\neasily jeopardized mammon into an idol. To make a passing sacrifice of the\r\ncountry that the people and the state may be saved, as did the Scythians\r\nagainst Darius, the Athenians against Xerxes, and the Russians against\r\nNapoleon, becomes difficult, in proportion as the nation has become richer\r\nin fixed capital.(290) But, as the destination of the latter is changed\r\nwith much greater difficulty than that of circulating capital, highly\r\ncultivated nations would find it very hard to satisfy new wants, if they\r\ncould not always appropriate the results of additional savings to the\r\nproduction of new fixed capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section XLV.\r\n\r\n\r\nCapital.—How It Originates.\r\n\r\n\r\nCapital is mainly the result of saving which withdraws new products from\r\nthe immediate enjoyment-consumption of their possessor, and preserves\r\nthem, or at least their value, to serve as the basis of a lasting\r\nuse.(291) As capital represents the solidarity of the economic past,\r\npresent and future, it, as a rule, reaches back into the past and forward\r\ninto the future, through a period of time longer in proportion as its\r\namount and efficiency are greater.(292) Those producers, too, whose\r\nproducts perish rapidly may, also, effect savings by exchanging their\r\nproducts and capitalizing their counter-value. Thus, the actor, whose\r\nplaying leaves after it nothing but a memory, may use the wheat received\r\nby him from a farmer who came to listen to him, in the employment of an\r\niron-worker, and invest the product permanently in a railroad. The\r\ntransformation may be effected by means of money, bonds etc., but it is\r\nnone the less real on that account. Order, foresight and self-restraint\r\nare the intellectual conditions precedent of saving and capital. The\r\nchildish and hail-fellow-well-met disposition which cares only for the\r\npresent is inimical to it. True, the desire of saving can be developed\r\nonly where there are legal guarantees to ownership;(293) guarantees which\r\nare both the conditions precedent and the effect of all economic\r\ncivilization.(294) The Indians, Esquimaux etc., had to be taught for the\r\nfirst time by the missionaries and merchants—and it was with the greatest\r\ndifficulty it was done—to save their booty, and spare the natural sources\r\nof their acquisition. Originally, they were, in the heat and excitement of\r\ntheir wild hunting and fishing, wont to destroy on the spot what they\r\ncould not enjoy in the moment.(295) In the lowest stages of civilization,\r\nthe first saving of capital of any importance is effected frequently\r\nthrough robbery or in the way of slavery.(296) In both cases, it is the\r\nstronger who compel the weaker to consume less than they produce. See\r\n_infra_, § 68. Where civilization is at its highest, the inclination to\r\nsave, as a rule, is very marked.(297) It begins to decline where a people\r\nare themselves declining in civilization, and especially where legal\r\nguarantees have lost their force.\r\n\r\nBut capital may be increased even without personal sacrifice; as for\r\ninstance, by mere occupation, as of certain goods, not hitherto recognized\r\nas such. Thus, also, by the establishment of valuable relations, the\r\nadvantages of which either become the common good of all; or which,\r\nbecause at the exclusive command of one individual, obtain value in\r\nexchange. The progress of civilization itself may increase the value of\r\nexisting capital. Thus, for instance, a house, considered as capital, may\r\ndouble in value if a frequented street be opened in its neighborhood. To\r\nthis category belong all improvements in the arts which enable existing\r\ncapital to achieve more than it could before. The invention of the compass\r\nincreased the value of the capital employed in the merchant marine to an\r\nextent that cannot be calculated.(298) The increase of capital effected by\r\nsaving soon finds a limit unless such limit is widened by the progress of\r\ncivilization.(299)(300)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Chapter II.\r\n\r\n\r\nCo-Operation Of The Factors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section XLVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Productive Coöperation Of The Three Factors.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll economic production generally demands the coöperation of the three\r\nfactors: external nature, labor and capital. But with the political\r\neconomist, labor is the principal thing; and not merely because all\r\ncapital presupposes labor, nor because every combination of the three\r\nfactors is an act of labor; but, in general, because “the human mind’s\r\nidea of means and ends makes all goods goods for the first time.”\r\n(_Hufeland._)\r\n\r\nLeaving the free forces of nature, surrounded by which we live and work,\r\nout of consideration, and also the fact that all raw material is due to\r\nnature, land is the indispensable foundation of all economy. But how\r\nlittle can unassisted nature do to satisfy human wants! How much less to\r\nproduce goods possessed of value in exchange! A virgin forest, for\r\ninstance, sold in its natural state, has, indeed, value in exchange, but\r\nonly because it is taken into account that it can be cleared, and that\r\nthere are means of transportation already existing.(301) The greater part\r\nof the forces of nature are latent to nomads and nations of hunters. When\r\nlabor develops, they are set free to assist it.(302) It is very seldom\r\nthat any thing can be produced without capital. Even the poorest gatherer\r\nof wild berries needs a basket and must be clothed.(303) Were there no\r\ncapital, every individual would have to begin at the very beginning every\r\nmoment. Life would be possible only in a tropical climate. No man, since\r\nthe days of Adam, has been able to labor, except on the condition that a\r\nconsiderable advance of capital had been made upon him. There is not a\r\nnail in all England, says Senior, which cannot directly or indirectly\r\ndirectly be traced back to savings made before the Norman conquest.(304)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section XLVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nProductive Co-Operation Of The Three Factors. The Three Great Periods Of A\r\nNation’s Economy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe relation of the three factors to one another is necessarily very\r\ndifferent in different branches of production. For instance, in the case\r\nof cattle-raising on a prairie, labor does very little, land almost\r\neverything. Hence an extensive, thinly populated country is best adapted\r\nto this species of production. But where land is scarce, as in wealthy and\r\npopulous cities, human activity should be directed into those branches of\r\nindustry which need capital and labor, as manufactures and the trades. (§\r\n198.)(305)\r\n\r\nLooked at from this point of view, the history of the development of the\r\npublic economy of every people may be divided into three great periods. In\r\nthe earliest period, nature is the element that predominates everywhere.\r\nThe woods, waters and meadows afford food almost spontaneously to a scanty\r\npopulation. This is the Saturnian or golden age of which the sagas tell.\r\nWealth, properly speaking, does not exist here, and those who do not\r\npossess a piece of land run the risk of becoming completely dependent on,\r\nor even the slave of a land owner. In the second period, that through\r\nwhich all modern nations have passed since the later part of the middle\r\nages, the element, labor, acquires an ever increasing importance. Labor\r\nfavors the origin and development of cities as well as exclusive rights,\r\nthe rights of boroughs and guilds by means of which labor is, so to speak,\r\ncapitalized. A middle class is formed intermediate between the serfs and\r\nthe owners of the soil. In the third period, capital, if we may so speak,\r\ngives tone to everything. The value of land is vastly increased by the\r\nexpenditure of capital on it, and in manufactures, machine labor\r\npreponderates over the labor of the human hand.(306) The national wealth\r\nundergoes a daily increase; and it is the “capitalism” which first gives\r\nan independent existence to the economic activity of man; just in the same\r\nway that law is, as it were, emancipated from land-ownership, from the\r\nchurch and the family only in the constitutional state\r\n(_Rechtsstaat_).(307) But, during this period, the middle class with its\r\nmoderate ease and solid culture may decrease in numbers, and colossal\r\nwealth be confronted with the most abject misery.(308) Although these\r\nthree periods may be shown to exist in the history of all highly civilized\r\ncountries, the nations of antiquity, relatively speaking, never advanced\r\nfar beyond the second, even in their palmiest days. A great part of that\r\nwhich is accomplished among us by means of capital and of machines, the\r\nGreeks and Romans performed by the labor of slaves. Leaving Christianity\r\nout of the question, nearly all the minor differences between the public\r\neconomy of the ancients and that of the moderns may be reduced to this\r\nfundamental distinction.(309)(310)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Section XLVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nCritical History Of The Idea Of Productiveness.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this chapter, the dogma-historical (_dogmengeschichtliche_) part is of\r\nthe utmost importance, because it treats of the connection between the\r\ndeepest fundamental notions and the principal branches of practical life.\r\nIt is clear that every political economist must construct his exposition\r\nof productiveness on his prior notions of goods and value. We must,\r\ntherefore, draw a distinction between expositions which are logical but\r\naltogether too narrow, and wholly erroneous ones.(311)\r\n\r\nThus, the Mercantile System admits every mode of applying the three\r\nfactors of production, but considers them really productive only in so far\r\nas they increase the quantity of the precious metals possessed by the\r\nnation, either through the agency of mining at home, or by means of\r\nforeign trade. This view stands and falls with the altogether too limited\r\nidea of national wealth before mentioned (§ 9), which this system\r\nadvocated.(312) The majority of the followers of the Mercantile System\r\nascribe more power to industry to attract gold and silver from foreign\r\nparts, than to agriculture, and to the finer kinds of industry than to the\r\ncoarser; to active and direct trade, more than to passive and indirect\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section XLIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nCritical History Of The Idea Of Productiveness.—The Doctrine Of The\r\nPhysiocrates.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of the Physiocrates is to be explained in part by a very\r\nnatural reaction from the narrow-heartedness of the Mercantile System, and\r\nat the same time, by a presentiment, misunderstood, of the true theory of\r\nrent. (§ 150 ff.). Of the six classes of labor mentioned above (§ 38),\r\nthose only are called productive which increase the quantity of raw\r\nmaterial useful for human ends. All the other classes, it matters not how\r\nuseful, are called sterile, salaried, because they draw their income only\r\nfrom the superabundance of land-owners and the workers of the soil.\r\nTradesmen, in the narrower sense of the term, produce only a change in the\r\nform of the material, the higher value of which depends on the quantity of\r\nother material consumed for the purposes of the tradesman’s labor. If any\r\nof this material is saved, the value of their products sinks, although to\r\nthe advantage of the economy of the whole nation. In any case, industry\r\ncould create no wealth, but only make existing wealth more lasting. It\r\nmight, so to speak, accumulate the value of the quantity of food consumed\r\nduring the building of a house in the house itself.(313)\r\n\r\nBut if tradesmen really earned, in the value of their products, only what\r\nthey had consumed during their labor, it would be difficult for them to\r\nfind employers to provide them with capital. Everyone will acknowledge,\r\nthat a Thorwaldsen and an ordinary stone-cutter, with the same block of\r\nmarble, the same implements, the same food, would necessarily, after the\r\nsame time, turn out exceedingly different values.(314) And, even in the\r\ncase that industry should add to the raw material only precisely the same\r\namount of value as had been consumed by the workmen, can it be said that\r\nthe work ceases to be productive simply because it is consumed by the\r\nworkmen themselves? If that were so, agriculture even, would, in most\r\ncountries with a low civilization, be unproductive.(315)\r\n\r\nCommerce, according to the theory of the Physiocrates, only transfers\r\nalready existing wealth from one hand to another. What the merchants gain\r\nby it is at the cost of the nation. Hence, it is desirable that this loss\r\nshould be as small as possible. Hence sterility!(316) But, the more\r\nimportant branches of business, especially wholesale trade, are connected\r\nwith a transportation of goods (_Verri_), either from one place or from\r\none period of time, into another. Here the genuine merchant speculates\r\nessentially on the difference of the values in use which are afterwards\r\ngreater than before.(317) The ice shipped yearly from Boston to tropical\r\nlands met a much more urgent and wide-spread want there than it would if\r\nit had remained at home. And thus the storage of grain in large quantities\r\nafter a bountiful harvest withdraws, indeed, an object of enjoyment from\r\nthe consumption of the people; but its sale, after a bad harvest,\r\nundoubtedly increases their enjoyment in a much greater degree than it was\r\nbefore diminished. Besides, the condition of both parties to the contract\r\nis usually improved in all normal trade. (_Condillac._)(318) No one parts\r\nwith exchangeable goods unless they are of less use to him than the ones\r\nhe receives in return.(319) And so, the value in use of a nation’s\r\nresources is really increased by commerce. To the other attributes of\r\ngoods it adds one of the principal conditions of all use, accessibility\r\n(_Kudler_), with which it either newly endows them, or which it increases\r\nin degree. To this end, the merchant makes use of tools, just as the\r\nmanufacturer does. What spinning-wheels, looms and workshops are to the\r\nlatter, ships, warehouses, cranes etc., are to the former. If production\r\nbe not complete until the thing produced is made fit for its last end,\r\nconsumption, commerce may be looked upon as the last link in the chain of\r\nproductive labor. It, at the same time, constitutes a series of\r\nintermediate links; as without it no division of labor is possible, and\r\nwithout a division of labor, no higher economic productiveness.(320) How\r\ncommerce may increase the value in exchange of goods, and without in any\r\nway injuring the purchaser, needs no further illustration.(321)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Section L.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven Adam Smith called services, in the narrower sense of the term (§ 3),\r\nthe grave and important ones of the statesman, clergyman and physician, as\r\nwell as the “frivolous” ones of the opera singer, ballet-dancer and\r\nbuffoon, unproductive. The labor of none of these can be fixed or\r\nincorporated in any particular object.(322)(323) But how strange it is\r\nthat the labor of a violin-maker is called productive, while that of the\r\nviolin-player is called unproductive; although the product of the former\r\nhas no other object than to be played on by the latter? (_Garnier_.) Is it\r\nnot strange that the hog-raiser should be called productive, and the\r\neducator of man unproductive (_List_); the apothecary, who prepares a\r\nsalve which alleviates for the moment, productive, the physician,\r\nunproductive, spite of the fact that his prescription in relation to diet,\r\nor his surgical operation, may radically cure the severest disease?\r\n\r\nIf the productiveness of an employment of the factors of production be\r\nmade to depend on whether it is attended by a material result, no one will\r\ndeny that the labor of the plowman, for instance, is productive; and no\r\none, of Adam Smith’s school, at least, that that of the clerk, who orders\r\nthe raw material for the owner of the manufactory, is. They have\r\nparticipated indirectly in the production. But, has not the servant of the\r\nstate, who protects the property of its citizens, or the physician, who\r\npreserves the health of the producer, an equally mediate but indispensable\r\nshare in it? The field-guard who keeps the crows away, every one calls\r\nproductive; why, not, then, the soldier, who keeps away a far worse enemy\r\nfrom the whole land? (_McCulloch._) But the entire division of business\r\ninto two branches, the one directly, and the other indirectly productive,\r\ncan be defended only as respects certain kinds of goods.\r\n(_Schmitthenner._) The labor of the judge, for instance, is only\r\nindirectly productive in the manufacture of shoes, inasmuch as he\r\nguarantees the payment of the shoemaker’s account. On the other hand, the\r\nshoemaker contributes only very indirectly to the general security which\r\nthe law affords, by protecting the judge’s foot.(324)\r\n\r\nNor can any effectual inferiority of service be claimed, simply because\r\nthe productive power of one branch of business is, measured by the\r\nduration of its results, greater than another.(325) What is more\r\nperishable than a loaf of bread bought for dinner? What more imperishable\r\nthan the _monumentum ære perennius_ of a Horace? The labor expended on\r\npersons and on relations (_Verhältnissen_) is, both as to the extent and\r\nduration of its results, much less capable of being estimated than any\r\nother; but its capacity of accumulation and its power of propagation are\r\ngreater than any other. It is in the domain of the “immaterial,” that man\r\nis most “creative.” (_Lueder._)(326) Finally, neither should the greater\r\nindispensableness of the more material branches of business be too\r\ngenerally asserted. Agriculture produces grain which is indispensable, and\r\ntobacco which is not; industry, cloth, as well as lace; commerce draws\r\nfrom the same part of the world rhubarb and edible bird’s-nests; and so,\r\nto _services_ belong the indispensable ones of the educator and judge, as\r\nwell as those of the rope-dancer and bear-leader, which can be dispensed\r\nwith.(327) Indeed, the dividing line between material and intellectual\r\nproduction cannot, by any means, be closely drawn.(328)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section LI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greater number of recent writers(329) have, therefore, come to be of\r\nthe opinion that every useful business which ministers to the whole\r\npeople’s requirement of external goods possesses economic\r\nproductiveness.(330) But it makes a great difference to science, whether a\r\nview is considered true because no one has suggested a doubt of its\r\ncorrectness, or because all doubts as to its truth have been triumphantly\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section LII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIdea Of Productiveness.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt should never be lost sight of, that the public economy of a people\r\nshould be considered an organism, which, when its growth is healthy,\r\nalways develops more varied organs, but always in a due proportion, which\r\nare not only carried by the body, but also in turn serve to carry it. The\r\naggregate of the wants of the entire public economy etc., is satisfied by\r\nthe aggregate activity of the people. Every individual who employs his\r\nlands, labor or capital for the whole, receives his share of the aggregate\r\nproduce, whether he contributed or not to the creation of the kind of\r\nproduce in which he is paid. Thus, in a pin-manufactory, the workman who\r\nis occupied solely in making the heads of pins is not paid in pins or\r\npin-heads, but in a part of the aggregate result of the manufacture, in\r\nmoney. Every department of business, therefore, for the achievements of\r\nwhich there is a rational demand, and which are remunerated in proportion\r\nto their deserts, has labored productively. It is unproductive only when\r\nno one will need what it has brought forth, or when no one will pay for\r\nit; but, in this case, what is true of the writer without readers—that he\r\nis unproductive—and of the singer without hearers, is equally true of the\r\npeasant whose corn rots in his granary, because he can find no sale for\r\nit.(331)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section LIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this matter, again, there is an important difference to be observed\r\nbetween private or individual economy and economy in its widest sense, in\r\nthe sense of a world-economy. The productiveness of labor is estimated in\r\nthe case of the former, according to the value in exchange of its result;\r\nin the case of the latter, according to its value in use. There is a great\r\nnumber of employments which are very remunerative to private individuals,\r\nbut which are entirely unproductive, and even injurious, so far as mankind\r\nis concerned; for the reason that they take from others as much as, or\r\neven more than they procure to those engaged in them. Here belong, besides\r\nformal crimes against property, games of chance,(332) usurious\r\nspeculations (§ 113) and measures taken to entice customers away from\r\nother competitors. Again, scientific experiments, means of communication\r\netc., may be entirely unproductive in the individual economy of the\r\nundertaker, and yet be of more profit to mankind in general, than they\r\nhave cost the former.(333) In this respect the nation’s economy holds a\r\nmiddle place between individual economy and the world’s economy.(334)\r\nStrictly speaking, only those employments should be called productive\r\nwhich increase the world’s resources. Hence, the work of government should\r\nbe called so, only in so far as its expenses are covered by the taxes paid\r\nwillingly by the more reasonable portion of the citizens; and also only in\r\nso far as its work is really necessary to the attainment of its end.(335)\r\nThe productiveness of an employment supposes, also, that it is not carried\r\non at the cost of other employments which it is more difficult to do\r\nwithout. In a healthy nation we may, in this matter, rely, to a certain\r\nextent, on the judgment of public opinion, which knows how to appreciate,\r\nat their just value, professional gamblers, pettifoggers and the luxury of\r\nsoldiers. The greater, freer and more cultivated a nation is, the more\r\nprobable is it that the productiveness of private economy is also\r\nnational-economical productiveness, and that national-economical\r\nproductiveness is world-economical productiveness.(336)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section LIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportance Of A Due Proportion In The Different Branches Of\r\nProductiveness.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch always depends on the due proportion of the different branches of\r\nproductiveness to one another. Thus, Spain, for instance, has remained\r\npoor under the most advantageous circumstances in the world,(337) because\r\nit allowed a disproportionate preponderance of personal services. The\r\ncharacter of the Spanish people has always given them a leaning towards\r\naristocratic pride and economic idleness. Tradesmen, in that country,\r\nsought, as a rule, to amass merely enough to enable them to live on the\r\ninterest of their capital; after which they, by way of preference, removed\r\nit into some other province, where they might be considered as among the\r\nnobility; or they withdrew into a monastery. Even in 1781, the Madrid\r\nAcademy thought it incumbent on it to propose a prize for the best essay\r\nin support of the thesis: “The useful trades in no way detract from\r\npersonal honor.”(338) During the century in which the country was in its\r\ngreatest glory, the whole people were bent on being to all Europe what\r\nnobles, officers and officials are to a single nation. “Whoever wishes to\r\nmake his fortune,” said Cervantes, “let him seek the church, the sea\r\n(i.e., go as an adventurer to America) or the king’s palace.” Under Philip\r\nIII., there were in Spain nine hundred and eighty-eight nunneries, and\r\nthirty-two thousand mendicant friars. The number of monasteries trebled\r\nbetween 1574 and 1624, and the number of monks increased in a yet greater\r\nratio. A great many of its manufactories, much of its commerce, and not a\r\nfew of its most important farms were controlled by foreigners, especially\r\nby Italians. There were, it seems, in 1610, one hundred and sixty thousand\r\nforeign tradesmen living in Castile. In 1787, there were still 188,625\r\npriests, monks, nuns, etc.; 280,092 servants; 480,589 nobles; 964,571 day\r\nlaborers; 987,187 peasants; 310,739 mechanics and manufacturers; 34,339\r\nmerchants.(339) As a counterpart to this, the United States had, in 1840,\r\nabout 77.5 per cent. of its population engaged in agriculture, 16.8 in\r\nmanufactures and mining, 4.2 in shipping and commerce, 1.3 in the learned\r\nprofessions.(340)\r\n\r\nWe might be tempted, in view of this contrast, to return once more to the\r\nunproductiveness of personal services. It is not, however, the direction\r\ngiven to the forces of production, but the squandering of them, that is\r\ninjurious. When the Magyar, through mere vanity, drives a yoke of from\r\nfour to six horses where two are enough; or when, as in 1831, Irish\r\nagriculture employed 1,131,715 workmen to produce a value of thirty-six\r\nmillion pounds sterling, while that of Great Britain(341) produced one\r\nhundred and fifty millions a year, and employed only 1,055,982 workmen,\r\nthese causes are as sure to impoverish the country, as the waste of the\r\nSpaniards in supporting such an army of clergy and servants. Of course,\r\nthe temptation to waste wealth on parks is greater than to waste it in\r\nvegetable gardens! The probability that a man will ruin himself by keeping\r\ntoo many servants is greater than that he will do the same by employing\r\ntoo many operatives.(342) And all the more, as there are many and\r\nespecially important services which regulate their own remuneration: thus,\r\nas a rule, those of the statesman, those of the military in times of war,\r\nand those of the priest in the age of superstition.(343)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section LV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Degree Of Productiveness.\r\n\r\n\r\nConcerning the degree of productiveness, it may be remarked that that\r\napplication of the factors of production is most productive, which, with\r\nthe least expenditure of means, satisfies the greatest want in the economy\r\nof a people. Here, there is a continual change, corresponding precisely to\r\nthe change in wants and faculties. After a bad harvest, for instance, the\r\nlabor which procures grain from foreign countries or the supplies of\r\nformer years, is most productive; and, after an earthquake which has\r\ndestroyed a large city, the labor of the builder. Agriculture is, as a\r\nrule, the more productive labor of undeveloped nations, and industry of\r\nhighly developed nations.(344)(345)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Chapter III.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Organization Of Labor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section LVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment Of The Division Of Labor.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe larger a tree grows to be, the more boughs and branches does it put\r\nforth. The more perfect any species of animal is, the more does it stand\r\nin need of a special organ for each special purpose. And thus the division\r\nof labor has developed and kept pace with the development of human\r\nsociety. While Crusoe was obliged to provide for all his wants by his own\r\nlabor, we find that in the wildest Indian family the male is employed in\r\nwar, the chase, in fishing, in the manufacture of arms and boats, and in\r\nthe transportation of the latter during long marches; the female, on the\r\nother hand, in the preparation of food, in the hewing of wood, the curing\r\nof skins, the sewing of clothes, in the building and preservation of the\r\nwig-wam, the care of children, and the carriage of baggage when on the\r\nmarch.(346) These occupations, at first entirely domestic, became, by\r\ndegrees, separate industries, which are constantly subject to further\r\nsubdivision.(347)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section LVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment Of The Division Of Labor.—Its Extent At Different Periods.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the middle age of a people, the division of labor is not carried to any\r\ngreat extent. The courtiers of King Frotho III. advised him to marry,\r\n“since otherwise his majesty’s ragged linen would never be mended.” Saint\r\nDunstan, although he occupied a high position in politics and in the\r\nChurch, was an excellent blacksmith, bell-founder and designer of ladies’\r\nrobes. Chriemhild in the Nibelungenlied was an industrious and skillful\r\nmilliner. In the corresponding period of Grecian and Roman history, we\r\nfind Penelope and Lucretia at the loom, Nausicaa, a laundress, the\r\ndaughter of the king of the Lestrigons, fetching water from the spring,\r\nOdysseus, a carpenter, a queen of Macedonia as a cook, and finally the\r\ndistaff of Tanaquil.(348) In the highlands of Scotland, in 1797, there\r\nwere a great many peasants all of whose clothing was home-made, with the\r\nexception of their caps; nothing coming from abroad except the tailor, his\r\nneedles and iron tools generally. But the peasant himself was the weaver,\r\nfuller, dyer, tanner, shoemaker etc. of his own family:(349) every man\r\njack of all trades.(350)\r\n\r\nIn present England, on the other hand, the manufacture of watches is\r\ndivided into one hundred and two branches which have to be specially\r\nlearned; only the so-called “watch-finisher” carries on other branches\r\nbesides. In Wolverhampton, it may happen that a man, employed in the\r\nmanufacture of keys, may not be able to make a whole key after an\r\napprenticeship of ten years, for the reason that during all that time he\r\nmay have been engaged only in filing.(351) In English agriculture there\r\nare, according to German notions, very few complete wholes. A well-marked\r\ndistinction exists there between the cultivators of corn and breeders of\r\ncattle; and the latter are again divided into breeders of young cattle,\r\ninto fatteners of cattle etc. Its industries are, in large part, separated\r\ninto provinces. Thus, linen manufactures are confined almost exclusively\r\nto Leeds and Dundee, woolen manufactures, to Leeds,(352) cotton\r\nmanufactures, to Manchester, and Glasgow, pottery to Stafford, coarse iron\r\nto South Wales, hardwares to Birmingham, cutlery to Sheffield. And so in\r\nthe different quarters of the city. Thus, in large towns, the banks,\r\nstores, offices etc., are found in one portion, with scarcely any\r\nintervening dwelling houses.\r\n\r\nOn the division of labor depends all differences of estate and class, and\r\nall human culture. It cannot be claimed that a division of labor does not\r\nexist among animals;(353) but those animals among which something\r\nanalogous to a division of labor among men exists, are raised far above\r\nall others by their human-like economy and the relative importance of\r\ntheir achievements.(354)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section LVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvantages Of The Division Of Labor.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe advantages of all suitable division of labor, consequent upon the\r\nnatural differences of human faculties and dispositions, are the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\nA. _The greater skill of the workman._ Even physically, many capacities\r\nare, by an indefinite number of repetitions of the same operation,\r\nenhanced to an extraordinary degree; which, however, renders the\r\nperformance of other operations more difficult. Thus, the man who has\r\ndeveloped his muscles and hardened his hands working in a smithy, renders\r\nhimself incapable of becoming a violin-player or an operating\r\noculist.(355) Here belongs especially the possibility of turning every\r\nkind of labor-power to greatest account. Even children(356) and old men\r\nmay be made, in this way, to play a part in the production of goods. It\r\nbecomes practicable, too, to relieve men endowed with superior faculties\r\nfrom common labor, and allow them to devote themselves exclusively to the\r\ndevelopment of the peculiar powers with which nature has gifted them.(357)\r\n\r\nB. _A great saving of time and trouble._ The simpler the operation\r\nperformed by a single workman, the more easily is it learned; the smaller\r\nis the price paid or apprenticeship, which depends on this, at least, that\r\nbeginners perform poorer work and are paid more poorly. “The shortest way\r\nto the end is most easily found when the end itself is near, and can be\r\nkept continually in view.” (_J. B. Say_.) Where the same workman combines\r\ndifferent operations, a great deal of time is lost in changing tools etc.\r\nBesides, it always takes some time for a workman to get rightly under way\r\nof his work. The person who changes thus frequently becomes more easily\r\nindolent. Lastly, there is a great number of operations which demand the\r\nsame aggregate amount of effort, no matter what the number of objects on\r\nwhich they are performed. It is thus, for instance, with shepherds,\r\nmail-carriers etc.(358) The post carries a thousand letters with almost as\r\nmuch ease as one; and the entire life of a wholesale dealer would scarcely\r\nsuffice to carry all the letters which he mails in a single day, to their\r\nplace of destination. During the middle ages, every man was obliged to\r\nwatch over his own personal safety and the maintenance of his own rights;\r\nwhile in 1850, in Great Britain, twenty-one million people are protected\r\nin their persons and property, in an infinitely more effectual manner, and\r\nat less cost, by fifteen thousand soldiers, and by a much smaller number\r\nof policemen, whose place it is to preserve public order. (_Senior_.)\r\nSomething similar takes place among merchants, and it may be admitted as\r\ncorrect in principle, that every new intermediary, freely recognized by\r\nboth sides in commerce,(359) makes labor better or less expensive.\r\n\r\nC. As the land of a country is, in a sense, the natural extension of the\r\nnational body, _the international division of labor_ affords an indirect\r\nmeans, but frequently an indispensable one, of procuring the products of\r\nforeign countries and climates.(360) If the English people wished to\r\nobtain themselves, and without having recourse to any intermediary, the\r\nquantity of tea which they annually consume, it is possible that its whole\r\nagricultural population would not suffice to procure it; while, at\r\npresent, it is obtained by the labor of forty-five thousand industrial\r\nworkmen. (_Senior_.) Moreover, the division of labor increases not only\r\nthe aptitude of the workman but also his incentive to productive labor,\r\nsince it guarantees to every one the certainty of being able, by means of\r\nexchange, to enjoy the productions of every other person.(361)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section LIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nConditions Of The Division Of Labor.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is by its division, that labor, considered as a factor of production,\r\nis raised to the highest degree of efficiency. Its results in any given\r\nindustry are, therefore, more important in proportion as the element labor\r\npredominates in it. Hence, these results are much smaller, in agriculture,\r\nfor instance, than in the trades, or in personal services.(362) The most\r\nexpert sower or harvester cannot be employed the whole year through in\r\nsowing or harvesting. Some kind of rotation of crops, some kind of\r\ncombination of tillage and stock-raising is necessary to every\r\nagriculturist. On this depends the importance of the technic secondary\r\nindustries of agriculture, which are, in principle, opposed to the\r\ndivision of labor. Hence, too, almost any person engaged in a trade, no\r\nmatter of what kind, supposes a greater number of customers than a tiller\r\nof the land of the same rank.\r\n\r\nThe more labor is divided, the greater is the amount of capital necessary\r\nto it.(363) It may be even said, that all preparatory labor becomes\r\ncapital in its relation to subsequent labor. If ten isolated workmen can\r\nproduce ten dozen articles of any kind, daily, and, after the introduction\r\nof a more efficient division of labor, fifty dozen, the employer must\r\nprovide them, in the latter case, not only with five times as much\r\ncapital, but probably with fifty times as much, as then, five hundred\r\ndozen are making continually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section LX.\r\n\r\n\r\nInfluence Of The Extent Of The Market On The Division Of Labor.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it is the extent of the market especially which determines the limits\r\nof the division of labor; for there is a direct and necessary relation\r\nbetween the division of labor and the exchange of its surplus. Hence, the\r\ndivision of labor may be carried farthest in the case of those products\r\nwhich are most easily transported from place to place, and which, at the\r\nsame time, possess the utility that is most widely recognized. The\r\nsmallness of the market may depend upon the scantiness of the population,\r\nor upon its scattered condition;(364) upon their smaller ability to pay,\r\nor upon the bad means of communication at their disposal.(365) Hence it\r\nis, that in villages, small cities, and still more on isolated farms, many\r\nbranches of business are carried on by one person, which are divided among\r\nmany in larger cities; and this is especially true in the case of\r\nbusinesses which have a chiefly local demand.(366) While, in small places,\r\nthe barber is also frequently the physician, in larger ones there are\r\ndentists, oculists, accoucheurs, surgeons etc.(367); and while, in the\r\nformer, the tavern keeper is both dry goods merchant and grocer, there\r\nare, in the latter, tea merchants, cigar-dealers, dealers in mourning\r\ngoods (in London childbed-linen warehouses) etc., and hotels for all the\r\ndifferent classes of travelers. There can be a distinct class of porters,\r\nhack-men etc., only where commerce is very active.(368) And even in cities\r\nlike Paris, where the costly industries that minister to luxury, that of\r\nthe jeweler, for instance, admit of only a limited division of labor, this\r\neffect depends on the smallness of the market; a market, indeed, which\r\ngeographically may extend over the whole earth, but which, in an economic\r\nsense, must always remain small, on account of the small number of\r\ncustomers who have the ability to pay for their products. The real wonders\r\nproduced by the division of labor and the employment of machinery we must\r\nlook for in the manufacture of the cheapest and commonest\r\ncommodities.(369)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section LXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Division Of Labor—Means Of Increasing It.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhoever, therefore, would increase the division of labor among the people,\r\nmust, first of all, extend their market; and this is done most efficiently\r\nby improving the means of communication. Even in our day, it is over the\r\nwater-highroads that the heaviest articles are carried with the least\r\nexpenditure of force;(370) but where civilization is not advanced, these\r\nhighroads possess still greater advantages, because of their safety,\r\nconvenience and priority. And here is the explanation of the intimate\r\nconnection of the beginnings of all civilizations with the existence, near\r\nthe scene of such beginnings, of good natural water-roads. “Even the\r\nwildest inhabitant of the sea coast very soon obtains the idea of\r\ndistance, which is altogether wanting to the inhabitant of the primeval\r\nforest. No sooner does he catch sight of the far-off island than his\r\nyearning after the distant assumes a well-defined character. Bits of wood\r\nfloating past him suggest to his mind the best material to buoy himself up\r\nupon the water, and a fish the best form for his craft.” (_Klemm._) Hence\r\nthe Mediterranean sea, especially the eastern portion, with the various\r\npeoples and products of its coasts, with its numerous islands, peninsulas\r\nand bays, its easy navigation, but little influenced by the tides or by\r\nocean currents, was the principal seat of ancient civilization.(371) The\r\nliteral meaning of Attica is coast-land. (_Strabo._) The colonization of a\r\nnew country is wont, where possible, to begin on the coast, especially on\r\nislands near the coast; and to follow the course of rivers into the\r\ninterior. Even whole continents occupy, for the most part, in the history\r\nof the world, the position assigned them by their coast-development.(372)\r\nWhile it is hard to determine whether, in the case of the European\r\ncontinent, its limbs predominate or its trunk, Africa may be said to be a\r\ntrunk without members. Its islands, most of them insignificant in\r\nthemselves, are almost entirely cut off from it by ocean currents. This\r\nexplains why Madagascar had not, by any means, the influence on African\r\ncivilization which Crete, Sicily and Britain have had on the civilization\r\nof Europe. Asia occupies, in this respect, about a middle position between\r\nEurope and Africa. The trunk of that continent bears to its members about\r\nthe proportion of 670,000 to 150,000 square miles. And what is worst of\r\nall, the middle of the whole is an almost insurmountable wall between\r\nnorth, south, east and west Asia. Hence the tenacious peculiarity and\r\nisolated development of the Chinese, Malayan, Indian and Arabic\r\ncivilizations; while the three peninsulas of southern Europe, for\r\ninstance, have affected one another so largely, and in so many different\r\nways.(373) The northern hemisphere compared with the southern, presents a\r\ncontrast similar to that between Europe and Africa, or of the rich\r\ncoast-groups of the Atlantic compared with the poor ones of the\r\nPacific.(374) But it is most especially, large, well-watered plains that\r\nare best adapted to the construction of roads, and thus to facilitate the\r\ndivision of labor. And while we find, in many countries, that the\r\nmountainous regions reached a certain stage of development earlier than\r\nany others, because they were more easily protected by military force, we\r\nfind, too, that even here, plains, have, for the most part, had the\r\nlargest share of power and of civilization (northern Italy, northern\r\nFrance, the plains of Switzerland and north Germany). See § 36.(375) We\r\nmust not, however, fail to consider the reverse side of the picture of the\r\ngreat highways of the world. The same reasons that raise them to the\r\ndignity of lines of commerce, make them lines of war; and even the\r\ncontagion of great plagues and of the ruling vices follows, as a rule, the\r\navenues of trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section LXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Reverse, Or Dark Side Of The Division Of Labor.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are hardships often attending the highly developed division of\r\nlabor, the dark and bright sides of which are most strikingly observable\r\nonly in large cities. However, when it is charged with adding to the\r\nnatural inequality of men, the accusation can be met only by the answer,\r\nthat, without the division of labor, we should be all equally poor and\r\nequally coarse; for each one would be absorbed by the necessity of\r\nproviding for his lower wants, and no one would be in a way to develop his\r\nhigher faculties. Even the poorest man has more enjoyment in consequence\r\nof the division of labor, than he could have living in a state of\r\nisolation from his fellow men. The most wretched among us, the invalid\r\nwithout property of any kind, the father of a family with more children\r\nthan he can support, would simply starve in the primeval forest.\r\n\r\nThose socialists who never tire of preaching “association,” overlook for\r\nthe most part, the great, free association which our needs, wants or\r\ntastes are ever changing, and which is given us, as of course, by the\r\ndivision of labor.(376) Yet the skill produced by the division of labor is\r\nunavoidably connected with a corresponding one-sidedness. The Russians,\r\nfor instance, are exceedingly apt, but they rarely distinguish themselves\r\nin any thing.(377) Love of his avocation, or pride in it, is a thing\r\nunknown to the Russian workman. He shirks all continuous labor.(378)\r\nExperience has shown that the Neapolitans and Italians, in general,\r\nexhibit great skill when they work alone; but that when a great many of\r\nthem work together, they become rapidly confused. The English, on the\r\nother hand, are slow to learn anything new, or to overcome unlooked for\r\ndifficulties; but they have no equals as workmen in organized\r\nindustries.(379) The difficulty experienced in seeking a new calling,\r\nwhere a high division of labor obtains, arises as much from the fact that\r\neach person here has received a more one-sided training, as from the\r\nnecessity he is under of competing from the first with only consummate\r\nworkers. Rousseau’s school has laid too much stress on the tendency of\r\nhigher civilization to diminish individual independence. _Quand on sait\r\ncreuser un canot, battre l’ennemi, construire une cabane, vivre de peu,\r\nfaire cent lieues dans les forêts sans autre guide que le vent et le\r\nsoleil, sans autre provision qu’un arc et des flêches; c’est __ alors\r\nqu’on est un homme!_(380) We might reply that to build a steamship or a\r\npalace, and to travel around the world are far better. (_Dunoyer._) Even\r\nphysically, civilized man is superior to the savage, as might be inferred\r\nfrom the greater average duration of life of the former. Of course,\r\nextremes should not be compared, nor should we contrast the frame of a\r\nweaver or student with that of a savage chief.(381)\r\n\r\nIn a similar way, the one-sidedness of the international division of labor\r\nmay be pregnant with great danger to national independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section LXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nDark Side Of The Division Of Labor.—Its Gain And Loss.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere, indeed, the one-sidedness produced by the division of labor goes so\r\nfar as to cause the degeneration(382) of the workman’s personality, the\r\nhuman loss of the nation is greater than the material gain purchased by\r\nit. Thus the occupation of polishing metals or gilding, when continued for\r\na long time without interruption, invariably ruins the health. What must\r\nbe the aspect of the soul of a workman who, for forty years has done\r\nnothing but watch the moment when silver has reached the degree of fusion\r\nwhich precedes vaporization! who is blind to all else, but receives a good\r\nfat salary for his services.(383) Schleiermacher rightly declared all\r\nhuman action which is purely mechanical, through which man becomes a\r\nliving tool (slave!) immoral. When the division of labor has reached this\r\npoint, machines should take the place of men. The morality of a profession\r\nmay be measured by the degree in which it corresponds with the universal\r\ncalling of the race.(384) It is not, therefore, a piece of inconsistency\r\nbut rather a deeply felt want, when, where civilization is at its highest,\r\nso many demands are made that the division of labor should take a\r\nretrograde path. The practice of gymnastic exercises by the sedentary\r\nclasses, universal military duty, the participation of citizens in\r\nmunicipal government and in political affairs, of laymen in the government\r\nof the church, of the wealthy in the administration of charity; all these\r\nthings are, from a materialistic stand-point, considered a great\r\nsquandering of time. It may be, that, if the division of labor were more\r\nrigidly carried out, we might, by its means, obtain more perfect results\r\nwith less economic expense. But the whole man is of more importance than\r\nthe sum of his achievements and enjoyments. (Luke, 9:25.) Wo to the nation\r\nwhere only jurists have a developed sense of the right, where political\r\njudgment and cultivated patriotism are the portion of only officials and\r\nplacemen, where only the standing army has warlike courage, and the clergy\r\nonly conscious religiousness; where parents leave all care for education\r\nto the teachers of the various branches of learning, and where physical\r\nvigor is to be found only among the proletarians. Hence there is nothing\r\nmore ruinous than premature one-sided education in a single trade or\r\nprofession—a thing which often happens from poverty before the foundations\r\nof the general education becoming a human being have been laid. The higher\r\na man’s position, the more should he, so to speak, be a representative of\r\nthe whole human race. Who, for instance, would wish to see a ruler brought\r\nup as men are to a special branch of science or to a special\r\nprofession?(385)(386) The best corrective for the one-sidedness produced\r\nby a high division of labor consists in the extension and many-sided\r\nemployment of leisure time, both of which are made more easy by the same\r\nhigh civilization which always accompanies the division of labor.(387)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section LXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Co-Operation Of Labor.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe coöperation or combination(388) of labor must, however, always\r\ncorrespond to the division of labor. Both are but different sides of the\r\none idea of social labor; the separation of different kinds of labor, in\r\nso far as they would disturb one another, and the union or combination of\r\nthem so far as they help one another.(389) The vintner or grower of flax\r\nwould necessarily die of hunger if he could not certainly count on the\r\ngrower of corn. The workman in a pin-factory, who prepares only the heads\r\nof pins, must be sure of his colleagues who sharpen the points, if his\r\nlabor would not be entirely in vain. The labor of the merchant is not even\r\nthinkable without that of the different producers between whom he\r\nmediates. Where the production of a certain article depends on the\r\nservices of six different kinds of labor, one of which, however, demands\r\nthrice the time, and another twice the time of the rest, it is clear,\r\nthat, in order that the business may be properly carried on, so many\r\nworkmen should be employed that their number divided by 9 should leave no\r\nremainder. (_Rau._) The union or combination of different kinds of labor\r\nis most perfect when the workmen live nearest together; when, therefore,\r\nthey are not separated by great difficulties of transportation; or in\r\ndifferent countries, in which case, a war might tear all to pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section LXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Principle Of Stability, Or Of The Continuity Of Work.\r\n\r\n\r\nCoöperation in time is of equal importance: the principle of the\r\nstability, or of the continuity of labor. When a workman dies, it is\r\nnecessary to be able to calculate on a substitute. It is well known that\r\nit is much harder to begin a business, than it is, afterwards, to improve\r\nand enlarge it; and this, the more complicated it is. A new enterprise\r\nwill take root easily, only where there are several similar ones already\r\nin existence; a new manufacturing establishment, for instance, where by\r\nthe existence of other such establishments, the requisite habits of the\r\nworkmen, of capitalists and of the public in general, have been previously\r\ndeveloped. The skill of workmen is propagated especially by observation\r\nand the personal emulation of the young; whence it is, that the\r\nintroduction of new industries is best made by the immigration of skilled\r\nworkmen.(390) Hence the baleful influence of such interruptions, as for\r\ninstance, the repeal of the edict of Nantes. Hence too, it is, that\r\ndespotism and the reign of the populace are so unfavorable to the economy\r\nof a country, where there can be no guarantee of a consistent observance\r\nand development of the laws. To the best applications of the principle of\r\nthe continuity of labor belong the church-building of the middle ages, the\r\nnational canals, the street and fortification systems of modern times; all\r\nof which have been created only by the coöperation of several generations\r\nto the same end.(391) The most striking means by which such a coöperation\r\nhas been advanced in modern times is public credit, “a draft on\r\nposterity;” yet, all saving is, in principle, the same. The most powerful\r\nelement in the coöperation in time of labor is the economy in common of\r\nthe family, although it differs in degree, according to the different\r\nkinds of family inheritance. Where, as among the English middle classes,\r\nit is customary to secure the business property of the family to one child\r\nby will, and to entrust the conduct of the business, during the life of\r\nthe father, to the devisee, to provide for the other children by\r\ninsurance, by savings etc., made from the surplus of the business, there\r\nmay be old firms which remain always new, however; because they combine\r\nthe experience of age with the energy of youth, and are never broken up by\r\na division of the inheritance. But the compulsory equality of heirs, which\r\nactually obtains in France, compels almost every new generation to begin\r\nwith a new firm. (See § 85 seq.)(392)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section LXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvantage Of Large Enterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the results of the division and coöperation of labor rests the superior\r\nadvantage of all great undertakings, and they are, therefore, smaller in\r\nagriculture than in industry. “It is harder to acquire the first thousand\r\nthan the second million.” Abstraction made of the conditions of capital\r\nand of the market, the limit up to which the growing magnitude of an\r\nenterprise becomes more advantageous, lies in the increasing difficulty of\r\nsuperintendence. Numberless commercial improvements, such as the\r\npost-office, railroads, telegraphs, exchange, banks etc., have operated\r\npowerfully to extend these limits. It is frequently possible, even in\r\nsmall enterprises, to secure the advantages of large enterprises, by\r\nassociation among those concerned. They must, of course, possess the\r\nnecessary capital. If they have not got it, as property, they must borrow\r\nit. It is, of course, peculiarly difficult here to preserve the necessary\r\nunity, without which the coöperation of labor becomes the confusion of\r\nlabor. The more moral and intelligent the participants are and the simpler\r\nthe business, the more extensive may it become, and the more probable will\r\nbe its success. (§ 90.)(393)(394)(395)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Chapter IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nFreedom And Slavery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section LXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Origin Of Slavery.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn institution like that of personal bondage, which, it can be shown, has\r\nexisted, among all nations of which history gives us information, at one\r\ntime or another, must have very general causes. Among these may be\r\nmentioned especially subjection through war. It is not possible to\r\ncalculate how much the principle, that it was proper to reduce the man to\r\nslavery whom it was considered right to kill, contributed to make war less\r\nbloody in an uncivilized age.(396) A nation of hunters is almost compelled\r\nto grant no quarter; the conqueror would be obliged either to feed his\r\nprisoner or to put arms in his hands. It is certainly a great humanitarian\r\nadvance, when this state of things is superseded by slavery among nomadic\r\nnations.(397)\r\n\r\nIn times of peace, economic dependence is the result of poverty, excessive\r\ndebt etc.(398) Where there is no division of labor, the individual has no\r\nmeans of supplying his wants, except by cultivating a spot of ground. But,\r\nhow can the poor wretch who has neither capital(399) nor land exchange\r\nanything of value for either? Such an advance, where there is no security\r\nin law, can be made only on the credit of a very important pledge. But the\r\nman who is destitute of all property can offer nothing but the productive\r\npower of himself or of his family.(400) And so it is with the small landed\r\nproprietor who has lost all his capital;(401) for, considering the\r\nsuperabundance of land, the part which he possesses has value in exchange\r\nonly to the extent that it is joined with the certainty of being\r\ncultivated; and here is the origin of the _glebæ adscriptio_. The\r\nhereditary transmission of the relation to the children seems to be\r\nequally useful to them; or who, were this not the case, would think of\r\nproviding them with food? It also frequently happens that poor parents\r\nprefer to sell their children to seeing them starve.(402) Hence the\r\nstrange fact that most nations have the most rigid system of slavery\r\nprecisely at the time that the soil produces food most readily. We need\r\nonly cite the instance of the South Sea Islands, at the time of their\r\ndiscovery. In many negro countries, where the people have not yet learned\r\nto use animals for transportation, the lowest classes, although they enjoy\r\na nominal liberty, are used as beasts of burden.(403)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Section LXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all very low stages of civilization, the greatest absence of the\r\nfeeling of wants, and the greatest indolence, are wont to prevail, and in\r\nthe highest degree. As soon as their merest necessities are provided for,\r\nmen begin to look upon labor as a disgraceful occupation, and indolence as\r\nthe highest kind of enjoyment. (§ 41, 213 ff.) Sustained and voluntary\r\nefforts, in any number, then become possible only by the creation of new\r\nwants; but these new wants suppose a higher civilization. Escape from this\r\nsorry circle is then effected in the most humane manner, through the\r\nagency of foreign teachers; inasmuch as the representatives of a more\r\nhighly cultivated people (missionaries, merchants etc.), by their own\r\nexample, make the nation acquainted with more wants, and at the same time\r\nhelp toward their satisfaction.(404) But, in the case of nations whose\r\ncivilization is completely isolated, or having intercourse only with\r\nothers equally low, progress is the creature of force exclusively. The\r\nbarbarous isolation of families ceases when the strongest and most\r\npowerful force the weaker into their service. It is now that _the division\r\nof labor really begins_: the victor devotes himself entirely to work of a\r\nhigher order, to statesmanship, war, worship etc.; the very doing of which\r\nis generally a pleasure in itself. The vanquished perform the lower. The\r\none-half of the people are forced to labor for something beyond their own\r\nbrute wants. And it is, here as elsewhere, the first step that costs.(405)\r\n(§ 45.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section LXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrigin Of Slavery.—Want Of Freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that slavery, at this stage, is so oppressive\r\neven to those who have been deprived of their freedom. The feeling of\r\nmoral degradation which slavery, abstraction even made of its abuses,\r\nawakens in us, is unknown in a very uncivilized age.(406) The child\r\nwillingly obeys the orders of strangers, and is hired out to service by\r\nhis parents etc. The want or craving for liberty keeps pace with the\r\nintellectual growth of a people. The systematic over-working of servants\r\nor slaves, in the interest of their masters, is scarcely thinkable in an\r\nuncultured age, when, in the absence of commercial intercourse, every\r\nfamily consumes what it produces.(407) The only thing which the slave has\r\nto fear is an occasional outburst of tyranny on the part of the master, a\r\nthing which is far from unfrequent in all the relations of low\r\ncivilizations. Fear restrains masters to a certain extent; for, in those\r\nearly days, how few were the institutions of state which could protect\r\nthem against the vengeance of their slaves!(408)(409)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section LXX.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmancipation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs states grow greater and men’s manners gentler, the ranks of slavery are\r\nless and less liable to be recruited through the agency of war.(410) It\r\nthen becomes necessary to have recourse to the family to keep up their\r\nnumber, which makes their condition much more endurable, and which\r\nsupposes that it has been made more endurable in other respects\r\nbeforehand. Modern states, are, as a rule, larger than the ancient were.\r\nThe Germans had, long before the time of Charlemagne, treated prisoners of\r\nwar of German origin more mildly than those of Gallic or Slavic\r\norigin.(411) The condition of the latter even improved from the time that\r\nnations began to think of making permanent conquests. Since the Slavic\r\nwars of the tenth century, certainly since the Lithuanian contests, it\r\nseems that prisoners of war were not reduced to slavery.(412) Chivalry,\r\nand allowing prisoners to go free, on their word of honor, contributed\r\nlargely to this result.\r\n\r\nThe more productive agriculture is, the more numerous the wants of land\r\nowners, the more extensive the division of labor and commercial\r\nintercourse become, the easier it is for a large class of the community to\r\nobtain support for themselves and families without cultivating land of\r\ntheir own. (Wages.) When exchanges through the medium of money become\r\ncustomary, the chief argument for slavery disappears; and the strong, rich\r\nand able man can, without having recourse to force, command the labor of\r\nother men. Every further advance in economic culture must necessarily help\r\nforward in this direction. Thus, without the plow, for instance, we should\r\nall be really only so many _glebæ adscripti_. It is due especially to the\r\never increasing perfection of tools, machines and operations, that the\r\nslave of antiquity was transformed into the serf of the middle ages, and\r\nafterwards into the day laborer of modern times.(413) It is more\r\nparticularly to be remarked, that machines, since 1750, “first made the\r\nconstitutional liberty of many, instead of the feudal freedom of a few,\r\npossible.” (_Schäffle._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section LXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisadvantages Of Slavery.\r\n\r\n\r\nSlavery promotes the division of labor only in the very beginning. The\r\nmore dependent the slave is, the worse he works. Whatever he spoils or\r\nallows to go to waste injures only his master. Hence it is that\r\nslave-husbandry is only one degree removed from what the Germans call\r\n_Raubbau_, and which means, as nearly as we can translate it, the most\r\nthoughtless and wasteful management possible.(414) Whatever he consumes is\r\nsimply so much gain to himself. Industry and skill are injurious to him,\r\nbecause, if remarkable for these qualities, his master exacts more work\r\nfrom him and is more adverse to setting him at liberty. Instead of the\r\nnumberless incentives of the free workman: care for the future, for his\r\nfamily, honor and comfort, the slave is generally moved by one—the fear of\r\nill-treatment, and to this he gradually becomes insensible.(415) The\r\ndivision of labor demanded by manufactures, and which is to be found for\r\nthe most part only where each person is at liberty to choose his own\r\navocation, is scarcely supposable where slavery, in the strict sense of\r\nthe word, prevails. The same is true of the spirit of invention and\r\nimprovement.(416) And even where the milder _glebæ __ adscriptio_ obtains,\r\nthe division of labor is much hindered. Hence, competent judges all agree\r\non the badness of slave labor;(417) which, as for instance in the United\r\nStates, was used only where the slaves were crowded together in large\r\nnumbers and could therefore be easily superintended. And not only are the\r\nslaves themselves indolent, but their masters as well; more particularly\r\nin slave countries where all labor is considered disgraceful. What must be\r\nthe national husbandry of a people, one half of whom refuse to do anything\r\nthat is right and proper, through malice, and the other half through\r\npride! As soon as, on account of increased population and consequent\r\nincreased consumption, this enormous waste of force can be endured no\r\nlonger, free workmen become more profitable, not only to themselves and to\r\nthe whole community, but to the greater number of the individuals who\r\ncompose it.(418) On the Bernstoff estates the quantity of rye harvested\r\nbefore and after emancipation was as 3:8-⅓; of barley-corn as 4:9-⅓; of\r\noat-grain as 2-⅔:8.(419)\r\n\r\nThe owners of serfs, especially, are apt to be very wasteful of their\r\nlabor, because they imagine that they obtain it gratis. Tucker has made a\r\ncurious calculation tending to show that when civilization reaches a\r\ncertain point, the master’s self-interest leads to emancipation. In\r\nRussia, where there are seventy-five persons to the English square mile,\r\nit seemed to him that serfdom was still a good economic speculation. In\r\nwestern Europe, where there were one hundred and ten persons to the square\r\nmile, freedom, in all relations of master and servant, he considered more\r\nadvantageous to all parties. Emancipation began in England in the\r\nfourteenth century, when that country had a population of forty to the\r\nsquare mile, and was completed in the seventeenth, when the population was\r\nninety-two to the square mile.(420) Tucker concludes, that the turning\r\npoint comes, when the population is relatively to the number of square\r\nmiles as 66:1.(421) Such a calculation cannot, of course, be universally\r\ntrue. The free workman can usually command a much larger portion of the\r\nsum total of economic profits than can the slave or serf, who must be\r\nsatisfied with the minimum necessary to support life.(422) Hence, free\r\nlabor is more profitable to masters only when production in general is so\r\nmuch enhanced thereby that a greater quantity of goods falls to their\r\nshare also. But this will always be the case where workmen are capable of\r\ndevelopment.(423)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section LXXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nEffect Of An Advance In Civilization On Slavery.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the same degree of servitude becomes more and more\r\noppressive to the bondman as civilization advances. The greater his\r\nintellectual progress, the more does he feel the want of liberty, and the\r\nmore keenly he experiences the degradation of his condition. The\r\ndevelopment of luxury digs a gulf between master and servant which grows\r\nwider every day. (§ 227 ff.) As commerce extends, it becomes more\r\nprofitable for the master to exact excessive work from his slave. In the\r\nWest Indies, it was a problem which every slaveholder solved for himself,\r\nwhether, by immoderately increased production, which cost the lives of\r\nmany slaves, the gain in sugar was greater than the loss occasioned by the\r\nconsequent death of the negroes.(424) When, with the advance of\r\ncivilization, the state guarantees to all more certain protection of their\r\nrights than they enjoyed in a less advanced stage of social improvement,\r\nthe last check on masters, the fear of the vengeance of their slaves, is\r\nremoved.(425) Demoralization naturally increases in the same proportion;\r\nand that of the master as well as that of his servants.(426)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Section LXXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis explains why it is that, in all countries, the power of the state, in\r\na period of transition towards a higher civilization, has endeavored to\r\nrender slavery milder. Great credit is due the Church in this regard. It\r\nsoon extinguished slavery entirely in Scandinavia,(427) and in portions of\r\nEurope it abolished at least the sale of prisoners to foreign\r\ncountries.(428) The _Concilium Agatheuse_, in the year 506, decreed that\r\nserfs should not be killed by their masters at pleasure,(429) but that\r\nthey should be brought before a tribunal of justice. (The manorial\r\ntribunals of more recent times.) Moreover, the numberless holidays of the\r\nchurch operated greatly in favor of the bondmen. Pope Alexander III.\r\nrecommended their gradual emancipation.(430) One of the principal steps in\r\nthe way of progress was made when they could no longer be sold singly, but\r\nonly with the village or on the estate to which they belonged.(431) The\r\nfeudal aristocracy improved the condition of the bondmen by reducing a\r\ngreat number of freemen to their level.(432) This could not be effected\r\nwithout a real amelioration of slavery; and, later, when the feudal\r\naristocracy declined, the older serfs were, with those who had been\r\nformerly free, raised from their abject condition. The sense of chivalry\r\nwould not permit a lord to be served by a bondman. The old adage “the serf\r\nlives to serve and serves to live,” by degrees, lost its force. Serfs were\r\nrequired to perform certain tasks on the lands of their master and to pay\r\nhim a certain quantity of the produce of their own. Heriots\r\n(_mortuarium_), which became usual from the 8th century (_J. Grimm_), may\r\nbe considered evidence that even bondmen were permitted to acquire and\r\nhold property in their own right. Thus was one of the chief disadvantages\r\nof slavery, in an economic sense, removed.(433) It may be affirmed, as\r\ncharacteristic of the aristocracy of feudal times, that they treated\r\nthose, who like the serfs were entirely at their mercy, with much more\r\nconsideration than those who were free, and, although dependent on them,\r\nhad certain rights guaranteed by contract. The absolute monarchy found in\r\nnearly all nations, at the opening of modern times, was forced by its\r\nstruggle with the mediæval aristocracy to favor the emancipation of the\r\nserfs and of the lower classes. Even in Russia, Iwan III. (1462-1505)\r\nseems to have restored to the peasantry the right of migration, of which\r\nthey had been deprived by the invasion of the Mongols, nor did they lose\r\nit again until the great troubles at the beginning of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, which gave the ruling power to the nobility.(434)\r\n\r\nWhere civilization has reached its highest development, the irresistible\r\npower of public opinion, governed by the ideas of the universal\r\nbrotherhood of man and of democratic equality, causes the abolition of all\r\nirredeemable and of all hereditary relations of servitude.(435)(436)(437)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section LXXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt cannot be doubted, that an entirely direct leap from complete servitude\r\nto complete freedom may be attended by many evils. No man is “born\r\nfree,”(438) but only with a faculty for freedom; but this faculty must be\r\ndeveloped. The knowledge and respect for law, and the self-control, which\r\nare the conditions and limits of freedom, are never acquired without\r\nlabor, seldom without the making of grave mistakes, and never except\r\nthrough the practice of them. As a rule, both parties, masters as well as\r\nservants, would like to get rid immediately of all the inconveniences of\r\nthe former condition and yet continue to enjoy its advantages. The\r\nservant, for instance, will now yield no more the specific obedience of\r\nformer times, but demands still specific mildness from the land-owner, or\r\nloaner of capital, his former master. It is inevitable that there should\r\nbe complaints on both sides.(439) But in the higher stages of economic\r\nculture, the relation of paternal protection and childlike obedience\r\nbetween the different classes of the people, which, even in medieval\r\ntimes, never obtained in all its purity, is certainly unrecallable. Hence\r\nit is, that all hope of a better condition of things is based only on\r\nthis, that the lower classes may as soon as possible attain to true\r\nindependence.(440)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section LXXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven in antiquity, the principal nations of the world could not keep the\r\nhumanizing influence of civilization from making itself felt on their\r\nslaves. And if they did not go so far as to bring about the total\r\nabolition of slavery, it is unhesitatingly to be attributed to their\r\nreligious inferiority.(441) In Athens, during the Peloponnesian war, it\r\nwas almost impossible to distinguish the slaves from the poorer freemen by\r\ntheir looks or dress. Their treatment was mild in proportion as desertion\r\nwas easier by reason of the smallness of the state or the frequency of\r\nwar. It was forbidden to beat them; and only a court of justice could\r\npunish them with death.(442) Emancipation, in individual cases, was very\r\nfrequent, and the names of Agoratos and of the law-reviser Nicomachos show\r\nhow great a part an emancipated slave might play in the nation.(443) The\r\nhelot system of the Lacedemonians preserved much longer a great deal more\r\nof medieval barbarism; but even here, we may infer from the frequent\r\nuprisings and emancipations of the helots, from their services in war\r\netc., that their lot was made less hard than it had been.(444)\r\n\r\nAmong the Romans, with whom war and conquest were so long considered(445)\r\nthe principal means of acquisition, slavery was relatively very hard.(446)\r\nBut, later, there came to be several different grades of slavery (_servi\r\nordinarii_ and _mediastini_ etc.); and in slavery, every gradation denotes\r\nsome amelioration of condition.(447) The slave obtained the right to\r\npossess resources of his own (_peculium_).(448) In addition to this,\r\nemancipation became much more frequent in the later republic; so much so,\r\nthat Augustus considered it necessary to pass laws taxing frivolous\r\nemancipation. (_L. Aelia Sentia_ and _Furia_.)(449) Where men like\r\nTerence, Roscius, Tiro, Phædrus and the father of Horace rose from the\r\ncondition of slavery, the treatment of slaves cannot have been entirely\r\nbrutalizing.(450) Under the emperors who oppressed the free citizens,\r\nlegislation was directed more than ever towards the protection of the\r\nslaves.(451) Instead of permanent slavery, a condition of things was\r\nintroduced and became more general every day, one in which the bondman\r\nmight contract a legal marriage, have property of his own, and in which he\r\nwas protected against an arbitrary increase of the quota he had to pay his\r\nmaster, whether in money or produce, although he still remained bound to\r\nthe land. This class was formed not only of the _originarii_, or those\r\nborn into it, but also of a large number of impoverished freemen,\r\nbarbarian prisoners of war etc.(452)(453)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Section LXXVI. (Appendix To Chapter IV.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Domestic Servant System.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn most countries the servant system developed itself gradually out of\r\nserfdom, or of some condition of tutelage analogous thereto. This is seen\r\nmost clearly in the long continuance of forced service, by which the\r\nsubjects of the lord of the fee were compelled to allow their children to\r\nremain in the court of the lord as servants, either without any\r\nremuneration whatever, or for very low wages fixed by long continued\r\ncustom.(454) Here, also, belongs the right of correction, so generally\r\naccorded to masters in former times. In the higher stages of civilization,\r\nthe whole relation is wont to be resolved more and more into freedom of\r\ncompetition; and this process is wont to take place earliest and most\r\nstrikingly in the cities. Where vast numbers of men are brought together,\r\ndemand and supply of services meet most easily. The nearer in the course\r\nof this development the servant system approaches to piece-wages and\r\nday-wages, the shorter does the customary (presumptive) duration of the\r\ncontract last,(455) the more voluntary is the period of leave-taking by\r\nboth parties;(456) the more does the entire relation tend to be limited to\r\nsingle acts of service agreed upon in advance (§ 39), and the more\r\nfrequently do both parties endeavor to supply the place of the domestic\r\nservants by workmen who receive wages and live outside of the family.(457)\r\nThe extreme of this direction at present is the servant-institutes in\r\ncities, the more movable and more democratic character of which finds\r\nexpression in this, that they have extended the use of personal services\r\nto a lower circle of consumers than could previously have thought of\r\nemploying them. In English agriculture this transition was completed\r\nmainly in the third decade of this century. The change was unquestionably\r\nfavorable to the improvement of the art of agriculture, but it was\r\nfrequently damaging to the social relation existing between the rich and\r\nthe poor in the country.(458) In Germany, the sale of the public domains,\r\nconscription and _Landwehr_ duty have operated in this direction.(459)\r\nHence it is, for instance, that in Prussia, the servants, in 1816, were\r\n15.18 per cent. of the entire male population over 14 years of age, and\r\n17.84 per cent. of the entire female population over 14 years of age. In\r\n1861, on the other hand, there were only 11.88 and 12.93 per cent.,\r\nrespectively, while the number of day laborers and workmen, in the same\r\ntime, increased from 16.29 per cent. males, and 10.87 per cent. females,\r\nto 20.95 and 16.65 per cent., respectively.(460) In most civilized\r\ncountries, the grade of society from which servants are recruited grows\r\nlower and lower as the spirit of independence extends to the deeper strata\r\nof humanity.(461)\r\n\r\nThe servant class may continue a long time yet to be a school of\r\ndevelopment for those of the lower classes, who, ripe in body, are not\r\nintellectually independent; just as the duty of bearing arms has been a\r\nschool of improvement for all male youth. Life-long servants are as seldom\r\nto be desired as life-long soldiers.\r\n\r\nIn most places, the long transition period from complete bondage to free\r\ncompetition was governed by a police system of wardship, which was very\r\nunfavorable to the servant class. Such especially was the provision that\r\nall young people of the lower classes, who could not expressly show that\r\nthey were employed under the paternal roof or at some trade, should be\r\ncompelled to seek some outside or inland work;(462) such also was the\r\nstrict prohibition of “usurious” wage-claims, and the “decoying” of\r\nservants from their masters.(463) Besides, a great many provisions\r\nrelating to servants, and based on views belonging to an older economic\r\ncondition, were intended to throw obstacles in the way of farm hands and\r\ncountry servants(464) becoming servants in towns; and, on the other hand,\r\nto facilitate the speedy abandonment of service in all cases in which the\r\nservant desired to marry.(465) All these preferences in favor of one class\r\nof contractors, and at the cost of another, are radically opposed to the\r\nmodern political spirit. The laws relating to servants are wont, in our\r\nday, to have but one object, the prevention, by registration with the\r\npolice, of fraud and breach of contract, and of all strife and litigation\r\nby the legally formulating of the conditions which are very frequently\r\ntacitly understood.\r\n\r\nThe ideal of the relation of master and servant is attained when it is\r\nconsidered by both as a part of the life of a Christian family.(466)\r\nHence, benevolence on the one side and devotedness on the other, fidelity\r\non both sides, disinterested care for the present and future interests\r\neach of the other _tanquam sua_; and especially for each other’s eternal\r\nfuture. Whether this state of mutual feeling is best furthered by the\r\npatriarchal system, by a police system, or by free competition, it is\r\nscarcely possible to say. It may, however, be affirmed that it depends\r\nupon a mutual and continued denial of self not easy to attain. Where it\r\nreally prevails, all the advantages of the piece-work system are obtained\r\nin a worthy and organic manner, and without its atomistic drawbacks.(467)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Chapter V.\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunity Of Goods And Private Property. Capital—Property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Section LXXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nCapital.—Importance Of Private Property.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs human labor can attain its full development, only on the supposition\r\nthat personal freedom is allowed to develop to its full economic\r\nimportance and dimensions, so capital can develop its full productive\r\npower only on the supposition of the existence of the freedom of personal\r\nproperty. Who would save anything, that is, give up present enjoyment, if\r\nhe were not certain of future enjoyment?(468) The legitimacy of private\r\nproperty has, since the time of Locke,(469) been based, by the greater\r\nnumber of political economists, on the right inherent in every workman,\r\neither to consume or to save the product of his labor. But it should not\r\nbe forgotten here that, at least in the higher stages of the economy of a\r\nnation, scarcely any work or saving is possible without the coöperation of\r\nsociety. And society must be conceived not only as the sum-total of the\r\nnow living individuals that compose it, but in its entire past, present\r\nand future, and also as being led and borne onward by eternal ideas and\r\nwants.(470)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Section LXXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nSocialism And Communism.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn opposition to this, the idea of a community of goods has found favor,\r\nespecially in times when the four following conditions met:(471)\r\n\r\nA. _A well-defined, confrontation of rich and-poor._ So long as there is a\r\nmiddle class of considerable numbers between them, the two extremes are\r\nkept, by its moral force, from coming into collision. There is no greater\r\npreservative against envy of the superior classes and contempt for the\r\ninferior, than the gradual and unbroken fading of one class of society\r\ninto another. _Sperate miseri, cavete felices!_ In such a state of social\r\norganization, we find the utmost and freshest productive activity at every\r\nround of the great ladder. Those at the bottom are straining every nerve\r\nto rise, and those higher up, not to fall below. But where the rich and\r\nthe poor are separated by an abyss which there is no hope of ever\r\ncrossing, how pride on the one side and envy on the other rage! and\r\nespecially in the _foci_ of industry, the great cities, where the deepest\r\nmisery is found side by side with the most brazen-faced luxury, and where\r\nthe wretched themselves conscious of their numbers, mutually excite their\r\nown bad passions. It cannot, unfortunately, be denied, that when a nation\r\nhas attained the acme of its development, we find a multitude of\r\ntendencies prevailing to make the rich richer and the poor, at least\r\nrelatively poorer, and thus to diminish the numbers of the middle class\r\nfrom both sides; unless, indeed, remedial influences are brought to bear\r\nand to operate in a contrary direction.(472)\r\n\r\nB. _A high degree of the division of labor_, by which, on the one hand,\r\nthe mutual dependence of man on man grows ever greater, but by which, at\r\nthe same time, the eye of the uncultured man becomes less and less able to\r\nperceive the connection existing between merit and reward, or service and\r\nremuneration. Let us betake ourselves in imagination to Crusoe’s island.\r\nThere, when one man, after the labor of many months, has hollowed out a\r\ntree into a canoe, with no tools but an animal’s tooth, it does not occur\r\nto another who, in the meantime was, it may be, sleeping on his bear-skin,\r\nto contest the right of the former to the fruit of his labor. How\r\ndifferent this from the condition of things where civilization is\r\nadvanced, as it is in our day; where the banker, by a single stroke of his\r\npen, seems to earn a thousand times more than a day-laborer in a week;\r\nwhere, in the case of those who loan money on interest, their debtors too\r\nfrequently forget how laborious was the process of acquiring the loaned\r\ncapital by the possessors, or their predecessors in ownership. More\r\nespecially, we have, in times of “over-population,” whole masses of honest\r\nmen asking not alms, but only work, an opportunity to earn their bread,\r\nand yet on the verge of starvation.(473)\r\n\r\nC. _A violent shaking or perplexing of public opinion in its relation to\r\nthe feeling of Right, by revolutions_, especially when they follow rapidly\r\none on the heels of another, and take opposite directions. On such\r\noccasions, both parties have generally prostituted themselves for the sake\r\nof the favor of the masses; and the latter have become conscious of the\r\nchanges which the force of their arms may effect. In this way, it is\r\nimpossible that until order is again entirely established, the reins of\r\npower should not be slackened in many ways at the demands of the\r\nmultitude. In this way, too, they are stirred up to the making of\r\npretentious claims which it is afterwards very difficult to silence. In\r\nevery long and far-reaching revolution, whether undertaken in the interest\r\nof the crown, the nobility or the middle classes, we find, side by side\r\nwith the seed it intended to sow, the tares of communism sprout up.\r\n\r\nD. _Pretensions of the lower classes in consequence of a democratic\r\nconstitution._ Communism is the logically not inconsistent exaggeration of\r\nthe principle of equality. Men who always hear themselves designated as\r\n“the sovereign people,” and their welfare as the supreme law of the state,\r\nare more apt than others to feel more keenly the distance which separates\r\ntheir own misery from the superabundance of others. And, indeed, to what\r\nan extent our physical wants are determined by our intellectual mould! The\r\nGreenlander feels comfortable in his mud hut, with his oil-jug. An\r\nEnglishman in the same condition would despair.(474)(475)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section LXXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nSocialism And Communism. (Continued.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat has just been said will serve to explain why, in the following four\r\nperiods of the world’s history, socialistic and communistic ideas have\r\nbeen most widespread: among the ancients at the time of the decline of\r\nGreece,(476) and in that of the degeneration of the Roman Republic;(477)\r\namong the moderns in the age of the Reformation,(478) and again, in our\r\nown day.(479)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section LXXX.\r\n\r\n\r\nSocialism And Communism. (Continued.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe thus see, that the attempts made by socialism and communism are, by no\r\nmeans, phenomena unheard of in the past, and peculiar to modern times, as\r\nthe blind adherents and opponents of them would have us believe. They are\r\nrather diseases of the body social, which have affected every highly\r\ncivilized nation at certain periods of its existence. If the body be too\r\nweak to react healthily and curatively (§ 84), the evil is very apt to\r\nlead to the decline of all true freedom and order. The communist, viewing\r\nall other things, especially the organization of the state, only as\r\ninstruments to supply his material and absolute wants, considers the\r\nliberal either as a fool who is ever pursuing the phantoms of the brain,\r\nor as a knave who covers his own selfishness under the mask of the public\r\nwelfare.(480) Hence the adherents of communism are satisfied with any form\r\nof government which seems to offer them most, and this a ruthless\r\ndespotism can do, at least, for the moment. And, although they are ever\r\nready for any revolution in the form of government, and easily to be won\r\nover to it, they are most readily captivated by a despotic revolution. On\r\nthe other hand, when communism seriously threatens all that constitutes\r\nthe wealth of a people, the owners of that wealth are compelled to fly to\r\nany refuge which holds out the promise to protect them from it, although\r\nby seeking that same refuge they may destroy their own political\r\nfreedom.(481) The Achean league, which under the leadership of Aratos, the\r\n“enemy of tyrants,” had come into existence, promising so much hope,\r\nbeheld itself later, and mainly through fear of the contagious effects of\r\nSpartan socialism under Cleomenes, compelled to unite with the\r\nMacedonians, that is, to give themselves up entirely. (§ 204).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section LXXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunity Of Goods.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now, for the present, turn our gaze from the frightful revolution,\r\ndestructive of all civilization, which would necessarily precede the\r\nestablishment of a community of goods,(482) and inquire what would be the\r\nconsequences. Among angels (“gods and sons of gods” of Plato) and mere\r\nanimals, a community of goods might, perhaps, exist without producing\r\ninjury. And so, too, it might exist among men bound one to the other by\r\nthe bonds of the truest love. The life of every model family is\r\naccompanied by a species of community of goods.(483) But in more extensive\r\nsocial organizations, this love is never found except as an element of the\r\nmost exalted religious enthusiasm, which, as a rule, is of very short\r\nduration; of which the Acts of the Apostles (II, 44 ff, 32 ff, V, I, II)\r\naffords us the best known and most beautiful example.(484)\r\n\r\nWhere this love does not exist, each participant in the community of goods\r\nwill, as a rule, seek to do the least and enjoy the most possible.(485) In\r\na society of one hundred thousand members, each individual would be\r\ninterested in the results of its aggregate frugality only indirectly, and\r\nonly to the extent of a one-hundred thousandth part of the whole; that is,\r\npractically, not at all.(486) Individual selfishness would expend itself\r\nentirely on the division of what the whole community produced. It would,\r\nconsequently, and almost always be detrimental to the whole, and to the\r\nother individuals of the society; whereas, at present, it does so only in\r\nexceptional cases. When Louis Blanc, as Mably had before him, recommended\r\nthat the _point d’ honneur_ should take the place of the _interêt\r\npersonnel_, as a spur to production, and a check on consumption, and cited\r\nthe army as an illustration of its workings, he forgot, among other\r\nthings, the thirty cases in which the _code militaire_ pronounces sentence\r\nof death on the violators of its provisions. And, as a matter of fact, the\r\nMünster Anabaptists could not help punishing with death every\r\ntransgression of their communistic precepts.(487) If, in a community in\r\nwhich the principles of communism were rigorously carried out, all the\r\nburthens and enjoyments of life were equal, and equally divided according\r\nto the ideas of the crowd, men like Thaer, Arkwright, and others of their\r\nclass, who now provide bread for hundreds of thousands from their studies\r\nand laboratories, would then be able, at most, with a rake and shovel, to\r\nprovide food for three or four. The division of labor, with its infinite\r\namount of productive force, would, for the most part, cease. Nor would the\r\nconsequence be that the humbler classes would be freed from work of a\r\ncoarse, mechanical, unintellectual and severe nature; but that the higher\r\nclasses would be dragged down to engage in it likewise. And what an\r\nincrease there would be in the number of consumers at the same time! Every\r\nman would, with a light heart, follow the most imperious of human impulses\r\nif the whole community were to educate his children. But we have seen that\r\na community of goods is desired most urgently in times of over-population.\r\nHence, here it would make the evil greater yet, by increasing consumption\r\nand diminishing production.\r\n\r\nWhere there are now one thousand wealthy persons, and one hundred thousand\r\nproletarians, there would be, after one generation, no one wealthy and two\r\nhundred thousand proletarians. Misery and want would be universal.(488)\r\nFor the purpose of giving the crowd a very agreeable,(489) but rather\r\nshort-lived period of pleasure, a period simply of transition, almost all\r\nthat constitutes the wealth of a nation, all the higher goods of life,\r\nwould have to be cast to the waves, and henceforth all men would have to\r\ncontent themselves with the gratifications afforded by potatoes, brandy\r\nand the pleasures of the most sensual of appetites. And then, the equal\r\neducation of all, demanded by the communists, would have no result but\r\nthis, that no one would acquire a higher scientific training.(490) But,\r\nafter all, there lurks concealed in communism much more of envy than is\r\ngenerally supposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Section LXXXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Organization Of Labor.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost theoretical adherents of the doctrine of a community of goods,\r\nfeeling(491) more or less the weight of the above objections, have\r\nsupplemented it with the idea of an organization of labor(492) or the\r\ncentralized superintendence of all production and consumption, either by\r\nthe government already existing, or by one to be created anew. Such a\r\ngovernment would be, of course, a despotism such as the world has scarcely\r\nyet seen, a Cæsaro-Papacy, usurping both the place and power of Father of\r\nthe universal Family.(493) But the evils mentioned above would be entailed\r\nnone the less. Every incentive which now moves man to industry or\r\nfrugality would disappear, and nothing remain but universal philanthrophy;\r\nor, if you will, but patriotism, virtues which are not wanting even now.\r\nEven guardianship of the government newly created would be carried on in a\r\nvery loose manner; for it would be exercised without any feeling of\r\npersonal interest, even in the most favorable case supposable. It is well\r\nknown and easily understood, that state industries are never engaged in,\r\nin the long run, with the same zeal, nor crowned with the same success, as\r\ncompeting private industries. It is well known, too, how intimate the\r\nconnection is between the political freedom of a people and their economic\r\nproduction; that, for instance, England’s greater wealth, as compared with\r\nthat of Turkey, depends, most largely, on the freedom that obtains in the\r\nformer country and the servitude that prevails in the latter.(494) And we\r\nmay inquire just here, what the result would be, if the despotism of\r\ngovernment should go ten times farther that it has ever gone in Turkey,\r\nwhen, moreover, the despot who led the state, was not an individual with\r\nhis few officials, but the whole crowd, with its million eyes and million\r\nhands. It would, practically, be to give every producer an escort of a\r\npoliceman and a revenue agent, as if he were a prisoner.\r\n\r\nAnd where would be the gain? A division of wealth which would seem unjust\r\nto many would exist now as well as before, because the idle and the\r\nunskillful would receive the same reward as the most industrious and\r\nskillful.(495) The opposition of one class of society to another, so much\r\ncomplained of, would continue. The only difference would be, that whereas,\r\nit now comes from the weak, it would then come from the strong.(496)\r\nCompulsory association is certainly more prolific in strife and crime than\r\nis a state of society in which everybody manages his own affairs.\r\n\r\nA journey on foot, in company with others, is allowed, on all hands, to be\r\na very good test of friendship. But, a community of goods would, in the\r\nstrictest sense of the word, be a journey on foot through the whole of\r\nlife with numberless “friends.” Here, every one would believe himself\r\nentitled to possess whatever pleased him. And, who would decide; since so\r\nmany communists preach the dissolution and extinction of all government,\r\nand the reign of anarchy? Besides, there can be no doubt, that the\r\ndifference of human talents and human wants, would soon, spite of every\r\nlaw, lead to a difference in property again. Hence, that first revolution\r\nwould have to be repeated from time to time—a real Sisyphus labor! No\r\nsooner have the bees produced anything, than the drones come, and divide\r\nanew!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Section LXXXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Organization Of Labor. (Continued.)\r\n\r\n\r\nExperience, however, teaches us, that, in all the lower stages of\r\ncivilization, a community of goods exists to a greater or lesser\r\nextent.(497) The institution of private property has been more fully\r\nevolved out of this condition of things, only in proportion as well-being\r\nand culture have been developed as cause and effect of such well-being.\r\nThus, among most nations of hunters and fishermen, the idea of private\r\nproperty was unknown when these nations were first discovered. This is,\r\nindeed, very natural. Their chief spring of production flows as if of\r\nitself, apparently inexhaustible; and the hunter can hardly think of such\r\na thing as saving any of his booty.(498) And, among nomadic nations, the\r\nland is a great meadow held in common; and the industry of plunder is\r\nconsidered, as it is in all inferior stages of civilization, especially\r\nhonorable.(499) The _conquistadores_ of Peru found there something very\r\nlike a community of goods, under the despotic guardianship of the state,\r\nviz.: a yearly division of all lands among the people, in proportion to\r\ntheir rank; the cultivation of these lands in common, under the\r\nsuperintendence of the state, and to the sound of music. But, at the stage\r\nof civilization that Peru was then in, land is about the only resource\r\npossessed. The results were the usual ones. A country like Peru, with only\r\none city, no beasts of burthen, no plows, no trades and no commerce,\r\ncannot possibly be rich.(500) That the constitution of Lycurgus\r\nestablished a sort of community of goods among the Spartans, is well\r\nknown. I need only recall the public education, the meals in common, the\r\nauthorization of stealing,(501) the prohibition of trade, of the precious\r\nmetals and fine furniture, the equal division of property and the\r\ninalienable character of the land(502) etc. With such laws, Sparta could\r\nneither be, nor desire to become, wealthy. Of all Greek states of any\r\nhistorical importance, it preserved longest the economic peculiarities\r\nbelonging to a low stage of civilization. Among most modern nations, the\r\nfundamental idea of their land laws, which had their origin in the middle\r\nages, is, that each family is only the usufructuary, and that the\r\ncommunity is the sovereign proprietor of the soil. This community of\r\nlanded possession finds expression, among other things, in the vast extent\r\nof communal woods and pasturages, in the varied intersecting of parcels of\r\nland one by the other, which, indeed, change proprietors from time to\r\ntime, and in the common working of the land, carried as far as possible\r\netc.(503) In all medieval times,(504) not only the individual is\r\nconsidered an owner of the land, but, over and above him, the family. At\r\nthe same time, we are wont to find existing an amount of mortmain property\r\nin the hands of corporations, monastery lands, crown lands and domains of\r\nvery great importance.(505) All these institutions have declined in number\r\nand shown a disposition to disappear, in proportion as national husbandry\r\nor economy has grown more productive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Section LXXXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Organization Of Labor. (Continued.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this tendency we find, indeed, another, and a no less powerful one,\r\nopposed. Everywhere as civilization advances, the sphere of action of the\r\nstate grows larger, and the ends it serves more numerous.\r\n\r\nIn its origin, government was established to preserve only the external\r\nsecurity of its subjects. By degrees, it comes to look after their\r\ninternal legal security, by enforcing internal peace, prohibiting revenge\r\nfor bloodshed etc. It next extends its care to the well-being, the\r\nculture, and even to the comfort of the people. But the claims of the\r\nstate must grow in the same proportion as the service it renders. While\r\nLowe, in 1822, estimated the yearly net income of the British people at\r\n£251,000,000; the government expenses,(506) in 1813 and 1814, averaged\r\n£106,000,000, and these sums were voluntarily devoted to public purposes\r\nby parliament. And so, between 1685 and 1841, the population of England\r\nmore than trebled its numbers, But, in the same period of time, the outlay\r\nof the state increased forty fold. (_Macaulay_.) Simultaneously with this\r\ndevelopment of things, it becomes more and more usual by the exercise of\r\nthe power of eminent domain and others like it, to sacrifice private\r\nrights, acquired by the very best of titles, to the preponderating common\r\ngood. We may allude, further, to the duty, universally imposed in modern\r\ntimes, of performing military service, to the national systems of public\r\ninstruction in so many countries; to the large number of societies,\r\njoint-stock companies, popular holidays; but particularly to the\r\nassociations for insurance of every description. And so it may, indeed, be\r\nclaimed that we have come nearer to a community of goods than could have\r\nbeen dreamed of a hundred years ago.(507) And yet, these are, for the most\r\npart, institutions in which we find reflected the peculiar strength and\r\nsolidity of our age. Whoever wishes to compare the power of one people\r\nwith that of another, must take into account not only the elements which\r\nconstitute their intellectual and physical force, but especially their\r\ninclination to permit these elements to coöperate for public\r\npurposes.(508)\r\n\r\nWe may now inquire: At what point does this increasing community cease to\r\nbe a gain? This is as easily determined generally, as it is difficult to\r\nsay what the limit to it is in particular instances. Progress in the\r\ndirection of a community of interests of this nature is beneficial, only\r\nso long but certainly as long as it corresponds with the feeling\r\nentertained by the community, that they have interests in common. Hence it\r\nis, that such a noble kind of communism reigns in art and literature, one\r\nwhich causes the stronger to willingly labor for the weaker, and with the\r\ngreatest success.(509) And so, too, the christian care of the poor, even\r\nwere it carried to the height of the Gospel counsels (Luke, 3:11), would\r\nbe no direct obstacle in the way of the development of a nation’s public\r\neconomy, provided it were given, and accepted, only as christian\r\nbenevolence. Every approximation towards a community of goods should be\r\neffected by the love of the rich for the poor, not by the hatred of the\r\npoor for the rich. If all men were true Christians, a community of goods\r\nmight exist without danger. But then, also, the institution of private\r\nproperty would have no dark side to it. Every employer would give his\r\nworkmen the highest wages possible, and demand in return only the smallest\r\npossible sacrifice.(510)(511)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section LXXXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Right Of Inheritance.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe right of inheritance to resources has its origin in a combination of\r\nthe idea of the family with the idea of property. And, indeed, this\r\ncombination of ideas is a very natural one. The larger portion of mankind\r\nconsider the pleasures of the family as the highest attainable, and\r\nendeavor, whenever their economic means make it at all possible, to secure\r\nthem. At the same time, the selfishness of most men is not confined to\r\ntheir own persons, but extends also to their posterity. Hence it is that\r\nbed and board, _eonnubium_ and _commercium_, have, from time immemorial,\r\nbeen considered correlative ideas; and, to all the more logical\r\nsocialists, a community of wives (or celibacy)(512) is as dear as a\r\ncommunity of goods.(513) (§ 245.) And in practice, the greater number of\r\nnations of hunters, who, according to our conceptions, have no knowledge\r\nof a real family and no knowledge of property, have a custom of burying\r\nwith the dead the things they used, to kill their cattle etc., or to\r\ndeprive minor children of their inheritance.(514)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Section LXXXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomic Utility Of The Right Of Inheritance.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe certainty, that the material welfare of their children depends, in\r\ngreat part, on their industry and frugality, is one of the most powerful\r\nincentives to good, in the case of most men. And this is the basis of the\r\neconomic utility of the family right of inheritance.(515) There is\r\nscarcely any other institution which opposes over-population with such\r\nefficiency, for the reason, that the obstacle placed in its way here is\r\nplaced very directly, at the point where it can make itself felt most,\r\nviz.: in the life of the family itself. The weaker the family feeling, the\r\nless does the abolition of the right of inheritance interfere with the\r\neconomic interests of a nation. Hence, for instance, it is, that taxes\r\nimposed upon legacies, bequests, testamentary gifts etc., are less\r\nobjectionable in proportion as they affect only those in the more remote\r\ndegrees of relationship in which inheritance is something merely\r\naccidental. While, when a nation is yet in the intermediate stages of\r\ncivilization, the _family_ right of inheritance seems to be very strong,\r\nespecially as regards landed property, a consequence of the fact, that a\r\nsuperior kind of title to such property is recognized to exist in the\r\nfamily; at a period, when individualism becomes more developed, the\r\nliberty of devise by will is wont to prevail more and more.(516) Then the\r\nright of inheritance becomes, so to speak, a more elevated species of\r\npersonal property, a prolongation of the same beyond the grave. Should\r\ntestamentary freedom be too much hampered, selfishness would manifest\r\nitself in a way much more detrimental to economic interests, viz.: in the\r\nconsumption of wealth, during the lifetime of its owner. Every man would\r\nbe but a life annuitant of his own property.\r\n\r\nBut, at the same time, in periods of moral decline, complete freedom may\r\ndegenerate so as to produce evils equally great. The wealthy Bœotians, in\r\nthe later days of Hellenic history, were wont to form themselves into\r\ndissolute drinking companies; and not only the childless, but even fathers\r\nof families made over their property to these companies, limiting their\r\noffspring to a portion which it was made their duty to let them have. It\r\nwas so in Rome, also, in Cicero’s time, when every acquaintance of\r\nstanding took it very ill if not remembered in the will of the testator,\r\nand where Octavian, for instance, in the last twenty years of his reign,\r\nreceived about 70,000,000 thalers through legacies left him by his\r\n“friends.”(517) Here, the repeal of the law making it obligatory on\r\ntestators to leave a certain proportion of their wealth to their children\r\nwould remove the last safe-guard of their material welfare.(518)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Section LXXXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nLanded Property.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs land, in its uncultivated state, has neither been produced by man, nor\r\ncan be entirely consumed by him, the above demonstration of the necessity\r\nof private property cannot without any more ado, be extended to land.(519)\r\nHence, individual property in land is everywhere much more recent than\r\nindividual property in capital.(520)\r\n\r\nBut a certain expenditure of capital and labor is necessary that land may\r\nbe used productively, and, in most instances, this employment of capital\r\nand labor is of long duration, irrevocable in the very nature of things,\r\nand one the fruits of which can be reaped only after some time has\r\nelapsed. Now, this cooperation of capital and labor is such, that no one\r\nwould undertake to employ them in the cultivation of the land, had he not\r\nthe strongest assurance of possessing it. Hence, agriculture in its most\r\nrudimentary stage supposes ownership of the land, at least from the time\r\nthat it is “tickled with the hoe,” until it “smiles with the harvest;” or,\r\nto express it more accurately, all the time intervening between the work\r\nof the plow and the labor of the sickle. The more, afterwards, population\r\nand civilization increase, the more products must be wrung from the soil.\r\nBut this can be accomplished only by means of its more _intensive_\r\ncultivation (higher farming), by lavishing a greater amount of capital and\r\nlabor on it, and, as a rule, by extending the circle of agricultural\r\noperations by means of combinations more and more artificial. Hence, the\r\nprogress of civilization demands an ever increasing fixity, and a more\r\npronounced shaping of landed property (the _specification_ of jurists), in\r\nthe interests of all who share in this progress, and even of those who own\r\nno landed property themselves. Were there no property in land, every one\r\nwould find it more difficult and laborious to gratify his want of\r\nagricultural products;(521) and the products themselves would be of an\r\ninferior kind.\r\n\r\nThus, for instance, in Camargo, the lackmus was formerly prepared from\r\nplants to be had “free” in the woods. It was then, however, much dearer\r\nthan it is now that the plants are artificially raised on landed\r\nproperty.(522) It is otherwise with the fisheries. The appropriation of\r\nrivers or seas would not tend to increase the abundance of their products,\r\nand hence this appropriation is, on the whole, rare.(523)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Section LXXXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nLanded Property. (Continued.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhenever this admixture of capital and labor with land has taken place to\r\nno great extent, private property in land is not found developed in any\r\ndegree. Thus, there are even now many half-civilized countries in which\r\nthe land is forfeited because not tilled for many years, and where it may\r\nbe occupied by the first person who will cultivate it.(524) In Europe,\r\ncommon possession of forests and pasture lands asserted itself much longer\r\nthan that of arable land, because, in the case of the former, labor and\r\ncapital play a much less important part in the management of them. And\r\nyet, even in the case of arable land etc., and, in the highest stages of\r\ncivilization, the property-quality is yet less developed than the\r\nproperty-quality of capital. How seldom do we find _fidei commissa_ of\r\ncapital, or capital juridically tied up. We find that the law of all\r\nancient nations drew a marked distinction between moveable and immoveable\r\nproperty, and that the power of disposing of the former by sale, pledge,\r\nin dowry, partition etc., was a much freer one. And even now, the police\r\npower which may be exercised over moveable property is much more\r\nrestricted than that over houses and land.(525) The justice of the\r\nexclusive right of possession to what one has earned and saved is obvious\r\nto every one. On the other hand, the appropriation of “original and\r\nindestructible natural forces” has its basis not so much in justice as in\r\nthe general good; and the state has always considered itself entitled to\r\nattach to the “monopoly of land,” which it accorded to the first\r\npossessor, all kinds of limitations and conditions in the interest of the\r\ncommon good, and sometimes to consider private property in land in the\r\nlight of a semi-public function.(526) I may instance the feudal principles\r\nof the latter portion of the middle ages, which are so far removed from\r\nour ideas of private property in land; and yet, of which many echoes are\r\nheard, even in our day, and are not without their influence in practice.\r\nThus, further, for instance, even in England, the greater number of the\r\npoor-rates, of taxes for the support of the established church, the\r\nmaintenance of public highways etc., are heaped upon the rent of land.\r\nMany socialists have proposed to make the state the sole proprietor of the\r\nsoil,(527) sometimes adding the condition, that the previous private\r\nowners should be compensated in capital, when it would be at least\r\nsupposable that private capital might be enticed to cultivate it, if long\r\nand sure leases of it were made. This would be a “good” demesne-husbandry,\r\nextending over the entire country. We need only glance at those kingdoms\r\nin which something analogous is to be found, especially the despotisms of\r\nthe east,(528) to divine that such a system does not suffice to insure the\r\nreal productiveness of a nation’s economy.(529)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Chapter VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Section LXXXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredit In General.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredit(530) is the power of disposition over the goods of another,(531)\r\nvoluntarily granted in consideration of the mere promise of the\r\ncounter-value.(532) As Franklin says: A good pay is master of another\r\nman’s purse. Hence, it is evident that whoever would obtain credit must be\r\nbelieved to possess the ability as well as the intention to fulfill his\r\npromise. Where this belief is based simply on the opinion entertained of\r\nthe person of the debtor, we speak of personal credit,(533) in\r\ncontradistinction especially to the credit based on bailment, pledge,\r\nhypothecation etc. The longer the time between the making of the promise\r\nand the period fixed for its fulfillment, the less certain is the latter,\r\nwhere the security is simply the person of the debtor. It is chiefly in\r\nvery uncivilized nations and also in nations in their decrepitude, and\r\nduring periods of anarchy, and in despotisms, that personal security\r\nstands higher than any other. The same is true, though for other reasons,\r\nin very energetic civilized nations, where the people put a high estimate\r\non the element of labor in their economy, among whose members legal\r\nsecurity is, indeed, found, but where the peculiar sensitiveness of\r\nspeculation would be too much hampered by the more sluggish nature of\r\nother credits; as, for instance, in North America, and even in ancient\r\nRome. Civilized nations that have reached the stationary economic state,\r\non this account much prefer the greater security and the absence of care\r\nwhich accompany non-personal credit.(534) In estimating the ability of the\r\ndebtor to meet his promise, we must take into account, especially, the\r\ndisposable character of his resources; otherwise it would be impossible to\r\nunderstand why the merchant may so frequently obtain a loan on his stock\r\nequal to its whole value, while the owner of land can place it as security\r\nonly to the extent of half its value.\r\n\r\nCredit, on the whole, grows in importance with an advance in civilization,\r\nand this is true especially of credit intended for productive purposes.\r\nThis is a consequence of the greater division of labor which causes\r\nunfinished products to be put on the market more and more\r\nfrequently,—products which come to have a value only after some time, but\r\nwhich, when that time has elapsed, have present value. And, indeed, as the\r\nworld advances and civilization grows, it becomes much easier to forecast\r\nthe future with certainty. The future, also, then becomes more a source of\r\nsolicitude, and fixed capital, as a consequence, plays a part which grows\r\ndaily more important. The limit to the development of credit is this: it\r\nis safe only when the debtor invests his borrowed goods in the production\r\nof, to say the least, their equivalent. This is why the personality of the\r\nstate, clothed with immortality and with a formally boundless power of\r\ntaxation, is so often seduced into engaging in transactions of credit\r\nwhich are never self-discharged.(535) The social diseases of panics and of\r\nextravagant enterprises stand in the same relation to credit that unbelief\r\nand superstition do to true religion.(536) (_Schäffle_.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section XC.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredit—Effects Of Credit.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs regards the effects of credit, we may remark, that it is as powerless\r\ndirectly to produce new capital as is the division of labor to produce new\r\nworkmen. To every credit of the creditor corresponds a debit of the\r\ndebtor. As Turgot said: _Tout credit est un emprunt_.(537)(538)(539) But,\r\non the other hand, credit facilitates the transmission of the elements of\r\nproduction, especially of capital, from one hand to another.(540) When,\r\ntherefore, the debtor employs the capital that he has borrowed, more\r\nproductively than the creditor would have done, the whole country is a\r\ngainer; as it is a loser, on the contrary, when a person engaged in\r\nindustry advances to the idler, the frugal man to the spendthrift, the\r\nsolid man to the wild speculator. In declining nations, where every new\r\ndevelopment hastens decay, the latter alternative may be the prevailing\r\none; and, especially here, may the usurious giving of credit by the shrewd\r\nto the simple lead to ruinous debtor-slavery. Among a vigorous and\r\nenergetic people, the former is apt to govern, as it is only by the\r\nproductive employment of the loans made that they are permanently enabled\r\nto pay interest. Here credit is an invaluable means, not only of putting\r\nidle capital in motion, and of making active capital still more active,\r\nbut especially of concentrating capital, by which it may gain as much in\r\nproductive power as labor does by the coöperation of labor. This is\r\neffected, very frequently, by means of joint-stock companies, the\r\nprinciple of which recommends them especially in enterprises where\r\nstationary capital is required rather than circulating capital, and where\r\ncapital generally plays a greater part than labor; and where this labor\r\ncan be subjected to provisions which may be accurately laid down\r\nbeforehand; as, for instance, in the case of docks, insurance companies,\r\nbanks,(541) etc. Banks, then, become real reservoirs of capital, provided\r\nthey are properly and judiciously established and managed; real reservoirs\r\nwhich receive in one place the capital which is superfluous elsewhere, in\r\norder to supply some other place with that which is necessary to it. The\r\nmore confidence increases, the more are even the smallest driblets of\r\ncapital awakened from their slumbers, and made active and productive. It\r\nis only by means of credit that the help of foreign capital can be\r\nobtained for home production. Indeed, credit, considered as an exchange of\r\nprobable future goods against actually existing goods, is one of the\r\nprincipal functions of the temporal solidarity of the economy of nations.\r\n(_Schäffle_.) Without credit, there would be very little place for\r\nspeculation proper.\r\n\r\nWe may see how the possibility of giving and receiving credit promotes\r\nwealth, by contemplating the poorer classes, whose poverty, both as cause\r\nand effect, is very closely related to the absence of credit. And here we\r\nhave a suggestion of the reverse to the bright side of the picture of\r\ncredit, analogous to that mentioned in § 62 of the coöperation of labor,\r\nviz.: that it tends to intensify inequality among men. The man who is\r\ndistinguished by the amount of his wealth, or by his position is naturally\r\nknown to a much wider circle than others are. From which it follows, that\r\nhe may, by the way of credit, increase his power, already so much greater\r\nin the economic world, by a much larger multiplier.(542) Hence, it need\r\nnot surprise us, that the great obtain credit from those in a lower\r\nposition, at least as frequently as they give them credit in turn.\r\n\r\nOn the side of the creditor, the possibility of making loans is a powerful\r\nincentive to frugality. Were there no credit, those who were not in a\r\ncondition to employ their capital productively would make savings only\r\nwithin very narrow limits.(543)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section XCI.\r\n\r\n\r\nDebtor Laws.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrivate credit is always conditioned, and in a great many ways, by the\r\nsituation of the whole nation’s business; in other words, by their\r\npolitico-economical situation. It is especially in the higher stages of\r\ncivilization, that one bankrupt may easily drag numberless others down\r\nwith him; and where the laws are bad or powerless, not even the wealthiest\r\nman can predicate his own solvency for any length of time in advance. One\r\nof the most important conditions of credit is the certainty that, if the\r\ndebtor’s good will to meet his obligations should fail, it shall be\r\nsupplied by the compulsory process of the courts. Hence, the importance of\r\na judicial procedure, at once impartial, enlightened, prompt and\r\ncheap.(544) The more vigorous the laws relating to debt are in preventing\r\ndishonesty on the part of the debtor, the more advantageous are they to\r\nhonorable and honest debtors. Adam Smith has rightly said, that in\r\ncountries in which creditors are not completely protected by the courts,\r\nthe honorable man who borrows money is in the same condition as the\r\nnotoriously dishonest man or the spendthrift, in better governed\r\ncountries. He finds it more difficult to borrow and is obliged to pay a\r\nhigher rate of interest.(545) Rigorous debtor laws, on the other hand,\r\ndiminish in the whole nation the amount of “bad debts,” that is, a not\r\ninsignificant portion of the cost of production. They, at the same time,\r\npromote, as far as it is in the power of laws to do it, national honor and\r\nthe mutual confidence of man in man. The excellence of their debtor laws,\r\nin their most flourishing period, was one of the principal elements which\r\ncontributed to make Athens and Rome of such importance in the history of\r\nthe world.(546)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section XCII.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory Of Credit Laws.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the history of laws relating to credit, we may distinguish, in a great\r\nmany countries, three stages of development.\r\n\r\nA. The laws, in the first stage, are very severe. In the Germanic middle\r\nage the insolvent was disgraced. He became the slave of his creditor (_zu\r\nHand und Halfter_), who might imprison him, fetter him (_stöcken und\r\nblöcken_), and probably kill him. A Norwegian law allowed the creditor,\r\nwhen his debtor would not work and his friends would not ransom him, to\r\ntake him before the court, and “to lop off from his body what part he\r\nwill, above or below.”(547) To judge of these provisions correctly, it is\r\nnecessary to bear in mind the many ways in which family resources were at\r\nthis time bound and tied up, and not forget “the power of defiance in\r\nthese iron natures.”(548) (_Niebuhr_.)\r\n\r\nB. The canon law introduced milder principles. Gregory the Great had\r\nalready prohibited the holding on to the body of the debtor.(549) On this\r\naccount, during the latter portion of the middle ages, it was customary to\r\nstipulate by contract that the provisions of the ancient law should govern\r\nin this matter, to submit to imprisonment etc.(550) The influence of the\r\nRoman law made it gradually more usual, in the case of insolvent debtors,\r\nto demand no more from them than the assignment of their property for the\r\nbenefit of their creditors. This, however, led to numerous frauds; and\r\nthese became more frequent in proportion as the laws governing the\r\nproperty of parties while the marriage relation existed between them, and\r\nas executions against landed property etc. were defective.\r\n\r\nC. Hence, in more highly civilized times, there has been a return to the\r\nseverity of earlier ages. Persons engaged in commerce, especially those\r\nwhose capital is so volatile, and to whom time is a thing so precious, can\r\nscarcely dispense willingly with personal imprisonment for debt. Hence,\r\nlegislation on bills of exchange, sanctioned especially by imprisonment of\r\nthe person, plays a very important part in the commercial cities of the\r\nseventeenth century, as it did, naturally, much earlier in Italy and the\r\nNetherlands.(551) Modern laws in many cases punish the bankrupt whenever\r\nan examination of his books, kept after approved methods, does not\r\ndemonstrate his innocence.(552) The great facility of fraudulent\r\nbankruptcy, where commerce has attained a high degree of development and\r\ncomplication; the absence of honor shown in engaging in speculation for\r\none’s own gain with a stranger’s capital, and without the real owner’s\r\nknowledge; the comparatively small number of blameless and irreproachable\r\nbankruptcies,(553) certainly justify these provisions.(554)(555)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section XCIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeans Of Promoting Credit.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most efficient means of promoting credit consists in\r\nlegislation intended to dry up the source of bad debts, by placing\r\nobstacles in the way of reckless or usurious credits for objects of luxury\r\nor pleasure, to bad customers.(556) But the application of these laws\r\nshould be clear and simple as to their matter, and require no inquiries,\r\nrelating to the person, impracticable for a business man to make.(557)\r\nThus, for instance, a short period of limitation established by statute in\r\nthe matter of advances made for ordinary money-claims is a beneficial\r\nrestraint, as well on the creditor as on the debtor, since it prevents the\r\naccumulation of a multitude of small debts which almost imperceptibly but\r\nat the same time irresistibly overpower the debtor under their\r\nweight.(558) Another efficient means is associations of business men to\r\ncirculate lists of bad debtors, and to prosecute their own demands in\r\ncommon.(559) On the other hand, experience has shown that imprisonment for\r\ndebt, as a means of enforcing a creditor’s claim, where the amount of the\r\ndebt is very small and such as only very poor debtors are apt to incur, is\r\nof little service. It is even injurious, because a great many sellers\r\nwould rely on that means of compelling payment in the future instead of\r\ndemanding it immediately, as they should do in the interest both of\r\nthemselves and of their customers. As a rule, it is only rich creditors\r\nwho can resort to it with success, a class who compel payment through this\r\nmeans by wringing it from the debtor’s relations more frequently than from\r\nthe debtor himself. The working out of debts in correctional institutions\r\nseems, for the same reasons, to fail of its object, since even well\r\ngoverned institutions scarcely cover their current expenses from the\r\nincome derived from this source.(560) The inequitable character of\r\nimprisonment for debt lies in this, that it punishes the unfortunate\r\ndebtor as severely as it does the malicious one. It must be clearly\r\ndistinguished from the imprisonment recognized by the courts as a\r\npunishment for reckless or fraudulent bankruptcy.(561) We must pass a\r\njudgment similar to that on the imprisonment of the person of the debtor\r\non the seizure of his wages not yet due, so far, at least, as an amount\r\nabsolutely necessary to save himself and family from want, is not\r\nexcepted. The prohibition of such seizure, beyond this, would amount to a\r\ndeclaration that all workmen without capital, even the best, should be\r\nconsidered unworthy of credit.(562) We may also include in this category\r\nsuch laws as except from execution the necessary tools of a tradesman,\r\nsince to deprive him of them would be to prevent his employing even his\r\nlabor to satisfy(563) his creditors’ claims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section XCIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters Of Respite (Specialmoratorien).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Special letters of respite_ (_Specialmoratorien_) are a suspension of the\r\nlaws relating to debt, made in favor of an individual. (_Quinquennalia._)\r\nThey were intended to protect not only the debtor, but also the aggregate\r\nof creditors against the short-sighted severity of one of their number.\r\nThey were wont to be given especially when the debtor showed that\r\nimmediate execution would not only have the effect of ruining himself, but\r\nof sending his creditors away empty handed; while, if time were given him,\r\nhe would be able to satisfy every one.(564) But the granting of such\r\nletters has, in recent times, been prohibited(565) in nearly all countries\r\nas arbitrary, and as a species of cabinet-justice. Nor should the granting\r\nof them be compared with the pardoning power. In the case of a pardon, the\r\noffended State forgives. In this case it sacrifices the unquestionable\r\nright of one party to the very doubtful advantage of another. Where such\r\nletters are granted in great numbers, credit cannot fail to suffer.\r\n“_Quinquinnellen gehören in die Hollen!_”\r\n\r\nYet in troublous times, when a great many debtors are insolvent at the\r\nsame time, the question of modifying the laws relating to debt,\r\ntemporarily, has been mooted. It has been urged on such occasions, that it\r\nwould be a matter of enormous difficulty to treat, _lege artis_, thousands\r\nas bankrupts at once; that thousands of businesses would have to be\r\nclosed, their stocks cast upon the market at mock prices, and their\r\nemployees thrown out of employment. But, if certain privileges were to be\r\naccorded to all who should declare themselves unable to meet their\r\nobligations before a certain day, it would be known, at least, that the\r\nothers were in a solid condition; and this would have the effect to\r\nstrengthen the credit which had been before universally shaken. We must,\r\nhowever, leaving all cases of abuse out of the question, remember, that a\r\nreally unrightful favor, granted to the debtor, may possibly entail the\r\nruin of his creditor. Besides, the uncertainty of the law would have a\r\nmuch worse effect on credit than uncertainty as to the personal status of\r\nindividuals.(566) Where, as is the case generally in inferior stages of\r\ncivilization, debtors and creditors form two distinct classes, the\r\nquestion of right is not, indeed, changed, but there is a solid basis\r\nafforded for the political admeasurement of opposing interests. In another\r\nwork I have shown how, after great wars, land owners, who became involved\r\nin debt, have been protected against capitalists. (See _Roscher_,\r\nNationalökonomik des Ackerbaues, § 137, ff.)(567)(568)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Book II.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CIRCULATION OF GOODS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Chapter I.\r\n\r\n\r\nCirculation In General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section XCV.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeaning Of The Circulation Of Goods.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe more highly developed the division of labor is, the more frequent and\r\nnecessary do exchanges become. While the hermit engaged in production\r\nthinks only of his own wants, and the mere housekeeper of the wants of his\r\nhousehold, the man who is part of a nation and who plays a part in its\r\ngeneral economy, must bear in mind the MARKET in which goods of one kind\r\nare exchanged against goods of other kinds. The greater, more various and\r\nmore changeable the conditions of this market are, the greater are the\r\nintellectual faculties demanded to engage in it successfully, and to the\r\nadvantage of everybody concerned in it.(569) Goods intended to be\r\nexchanged are called commodities. By the circulation of commodities is\r\nmeant their going over from one owner to another.(570) Among the principal\r\ncauses of circulation, we may mention the difference in the nature and\r\ncivilization of countries and peoples, the distinction between city and\r\ncountry, the division of people into classes etc.(571) The rapidity of\r\ncirculation depends, on the one hand, on the quantity of commodities, and\r\non the other, on the degree to which the division of labor has been\r\ncarried. In both respects it is, therefore, an important indication of the\r\nwealth of the nation, and of the world.\r\n\r\nDifferent commodities have very different degrees of capacity for\r\ncirculation (_Circulationsfähigkeit_), that is, of certainty of finding\r\npurchasers, and of facility of seeking purchasers. The smaller, compared\r\nwith its value, the volume and weight of a commodity are; the longer and\r\nmore conveniently it can be stored away; the more invariable and\r\nwell-known are its value in use and value in exchange: the more readily\r\ndoes it go from one place to another, the more easily is it transmitted\r\nfrom one period of time to another and from the possession of one person\r\ninto the possession of another. Thus, for instance, the precious metals\r\ncirculate more rapidly than industrial products; these in turn more than\r\nraw material,(572) and immovable property circulates least rapidly of all.\r\nAn improvement in the means of transportation naturally increases the\r\ncapacity of circulation of the entire wealth of a people, and especially\r\nof those commodities which were not before transferable as well as of\r\nthose of which the cost of transportation constituted a peculiarly large\r\ncomponent part of the price.(573) The greater the capacity for circulation\r\nof any kind of goods, the greater is the power of control of its owner in\r\nthe world of trade. If we compare two men, each of whom possesses a\r\nmillion of dollars, but one of whom has that million in money and the\r\nother in land, we shall find that the former is able, for present\r\npurposes, such as loaning to the state in case of need, aiding a\r\nconspiracy etc., to command resources much more readily and effectively\r\nthan the latter. Under the ordinary circumstances of a nation’s economy,\r\nwe find that the owner of money is very seldom in want of bread, fuel or\r\nclothing, whereas very many owners of other property may be in want of\r\nmoney.(574) True, resources which may, so to speak, take the offensive\r\nmost energetically, offer less resistance to unforeseen misfortune. The\r\npossessor of such resources is in a condition to lose his all on the turn\r\nof a single die. As civilization advances, the circulating capacity of a\r\nnation’s wealth increases.(575)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section XCVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nRapidity Of Circulation.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith an advance in a people’s public economy, we find an increased\r\nrapidity of circulation connected, both as cause and effect. Every\r\nimprovement, every thing which shortens the process of production, must\r\nfacilitate and accelerate the circulation of commodities. And so, the\r\nperfecting of the means of transport of commodities, of the media of\r\nexchange and of credit, an increase in the number of middlemen who make it\r\ntheir business to purchase in order to sell again. On the other hand, the\r\nmore rapid the circulation of wealth, the more can it promote production.\r\nThe more rapidly, for instance, the manufacturer of cloth exchanges his\r\nwares for money, the more rapidly may he employ the money in the purchase\r\nof new tools and the hiring of new labor; and the sooner may he appear in\r\nthe market with new cloth. It is here precisely as it is in agriculture,\r\nwhich is more productive where the seed returns several times in a year\r\n(several crops(576)) to the hand of the peasant than it is where this\r\nhappens only once. The nearer the members of the commercial organism are\r\nto one another, the more rapid is circulation wont to be. Hence, it is\r\nmore rapid in industry than in agriculture; in retail trade than in\r\nwholesale; in large cities than in the country; among a dense population\r\nthan among a sparse population.\r\n\r\nThe _regularity_ of circulation increases with economic culture. Its\r\nconcentration at large terminal points, its interruption by bad seasons of\r\nthe year, belong to the lower stages of the political economy of a people;\r\nalthough bad harvests, floods, wars, revolutions etc. may, at any time,\r\nlead to a sluggishness or to an arrest of circulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section XCVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nFreedom Of Competition.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it is especially the freedom of circulation that increases with an\r\nadvance in civilization, and this advance, like the two preceding, first\r\naffects the home or inland circulation. Freedom of competition, the\r\nfreedom of commerce and industry, technical expressions used to designate\r\nfreedom in general in the domain of a nation’s economy, is the natural\r\nconclusion drawn from the principles of individual independence and of\r\nprivate property. Hence its development is as slow as the development of\r\nthese, and attains its full growth only in highly cultivated nations,\r\ntheir colonies and dependencies. In very low stages of economic\r\ndevelopment, the circulation of goods is hampered by the absence of legal\r\nsecurity; later, by privileges accorded to a great number of families,\r\ncorporate bodies, municipalities, classes, etc., and later yet by the\r\nmighty guardianship which the state exercises by its power of legislation\r\nand even of education.(577) Each one of these epochs constitutes the end\r\nof the preceding one, and is milder than it was. Finally comes the period\r\nof complete freedom, when every man is permitted to manage his own affairs\r\neven with injury to himself, provided the injury is confined to himself.\r\n\r\nThe later times of the Roman Empire are the best illustration of how, with\r\nthe decline of the conditions which must precede freedom of competition,\r\nthat freedom itself decays.(578)\r\n\r\nFreedom of competition unchains all economic forces, good and bad. Hence,\r\nwhen the former preponderate, it hastens the time of a people’s grandeur,\r\nas it does their decline where the latter gain the upper hand.(579) We may\r\nsay of economic freedom what may be said of all other freedom, that the\r\nremoval of external constraint can be justified and produces the greater\r\ngood of the greater number only where a stern empire over self takes its\r\nplace. Without this it would not prevent or avoid idleness, usury or\r\nover-population. Freedom must not be simply negative. It must be positive.\r\nIf on account of the immaturity or over-maturity of a people, there be no\r\nsturdy middle class among them, unlimited competition may become what\r\nBazard calls a general _sauve-qui-peut_ (let the devil take the hindmost);\r\nwhat Fourier designates as a _morcellement industriel_, and a _fraude\r\ncommerciale_; what M. Chevalier denominated “a battle-field on which the\r\nlittle are devoured by the big;” and in such case, as Bodz-Reymond says,\r\nthe word competition, meaning simply that each one is permitted to run in\r\nwhatever direction he may see a door open to him, is but another and a new\r\nexpression for vagabondizing. But here the evil does not lie in too great\r\ncompetition, but in this, that on one side there is too little\r\ncompetition.(580) The opposing principle of competition is always\r\nmonopoly, that is, as John Stuart Mill says, the taxation of industry in\r\nthe interest of indolence and even rapacity; and protection against\r\ncompetition is synonymous with a dispensation from the necessity to be as\r\nindustrious and clever as other people.\r\n\r\nA protection of this nature, sufficiently effective to attain its end,\r\nwould not fail to arrest the efforts of those who had accomplished\r\nsomething, and even to turn them backward. That freedom of competition is\r\na species of declaration of war,(581) among men considered as producers,\r\nis certain; but, at the same time, it makes all men considered as\r\nconsumers members of one society, in which all the members are equally\r\ninterested, a fact too much overlooked by socialists.(582) It is the means\r\nespecially by which the greatest and ever increasing portion of the forces\r\nof nature are raised to the character of the free and common property of\r\nthe human race.(583) “Man is not the favorite of nature in the sense that\r\nnature has done everything for him, but in the sense that it has endowed\r\nhim with the ability to do everything for himself. The right of freedom of\r\ncompetition may, therefore, be considered both the protection and the\r\nimage of this provision of nature.” (_Zachariä._)(584)\r\n\r\nThe person, therefore, who claims or asserts an exception from the rule of\r\nfree competition, has to prove his position in every individual case,\r\nsince the burthen of proof is on him. But the duty of interference on the\r\npart of the state is positively pointed out where any interest common to\r\nthe whole people is not in a condition to assert itself; and negatively,\r\nwhen the custom which hitherto had prevented an undoubted abuse has grown\r\ntoo weak to continue to perform that service. In _both_ regards I would\r\ncall attention to the protection of factory children against the\r\nconcurrent selfishness of their parents and masters.(585)(586) _Supra_, §\r\n39.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Section XCVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Goods Are Paid For.—The Rent For Goods.\r\n\r\n\r\nPayment for goods (§ 1 ff.) of any kind can be made only in other\r\ngoods.(587)(588) Hence, the greater, more varied, and the better adapted\r\nto satisfy wants, production is, the more readily does any product find a\r\nremunerative market; more readily in England, for instance, in spite, or\r\nrather, because of, the great competition there, than in Greenland or\r\nMadagascar. From this it follows that, as a rule, a person is in a better\r\ncondition to purchase more goods in proportion as he has produced more\r\nhimself. According to official accounts, the average value of a harvest of\r\nwheat and potatoes in Prussia was formerly 332,500,000 thalers. In the\r\nyear 1850, however, it was only 262,000,000 thalers. As a matter of\r\ncourse, the country people in that year could not purchase from the cities\r\nas much as in ordinary years, by a difference of 70,000,000 thalers. This\r\nillustrates how every class of people, who live by finding a free market\r\nfor their products, are interested in the prosperity of all other classes.\r\nAs Bastiat says: “All legitimate interests are harmonious.” The more\r\nflourishing a city, the better off are the towns around it, which furnish\r\nit with provisions; and the richer these towns, the more flourishing is\r\nthe industry of the city which ministers to their wants.(589) It is\r\nimportant that this fact should be borne steadily in mind, especially in\r\ntimes of advanced civilization, when the feeling that we all have\r\ninterests in common, is too apt to grow dormant. Nothing can better serve\r\nto awaken it again when it has become so. A nation, says Louis Blanc, in\r\nwhich one portion of the people is oppressed by another, is like a man\r\nwounded in the leg. The healthy limb is prevented by the sick one from\r\nperforming its functions.(590)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section XCIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nFreedom Of Competition And International Trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes the same rule apply to the commercial intercourse of nations? Where\r\nthe feeling that all mankind constitute one vast family is stronger than\r\nthat of their political and religious diversity; where the sense of right\r\nand the love of peace have extinguished every dangerous spark of ambition\r\nfor empire and all warlike jealousy; where, especially, their economic\r\ninterests are rightly understood on both sides, a real conflict between\r\nthe interests of two nations must always be a phenomenon of rare\r\noccurrence, and an exception to the general rule, which should not be\r\nadmitted until it has been clearly demonstrated to exist.(591) Highly\r\ncultivated nations generally look upon the first steps in the civilization\r\nof a foreign people with a more favorable eye than they do on the\r\nsubsequent progress which brings such nations nearer to themselves.(592)\r\nYet the realization of the above mentioned conditions on all sides is\r\nsomething so improbable, unpatriotic “philanthropy” something so\r\nsuspicious,(593) the greater number of mankind so incapable of development\r\nexcept under the limitations of nationality, that I should observe the\r\ntotal disappearance of national jealousies only with solicitude. Nothing\r\nso much contributed to the Macedonian and Roman conquests as the\r\ncosmopolitanism of the later Greek philosophers.(594)\r\n\r\nAs all commerce is based on the mutual dependence of the contracting\r\nparties, we need not be surprised to find international commerce so\r\ndependent. But this dependence need not, by any means, be equally great on\r\nboth sides. Rather is the individual or the nation which stands in most\r\nurgent need of foreign goods or products the most dependent. Hence, it\r\nseems that, in the commercial intercourse between an agricultural and an\r\nindustrial people, in which the former furnish food and the raw material\r\nof manufactures, and the latter manufactured articles, the latter are the\r\nmore dependent. In case of war, for instance, it is much easier to\r\ndispense for a long time with manufactured articles than with most\r\narticles of food.(595) However, this condition of things is very much\r\nmodified, for the better, by all those circumstances on which the dominant\r\nactive commerce of a nation depends. It is, for instance, much easier for\r\nthe English, on account of their greater familiarity with, and knowledge\r\nof the laws and nature of commerce, on account of their business\r\nconnections, their capital, credit and means of transportation, but more\r\nparticularly on account of the greater capacity of circulation of their\r\nnational resources, to find a new market in the stead of one that has been\r\nclosed to them, than it is for the Russians with their much more\r\nimmoveable system of public economy.(596) It is true, however, that an\r\neffective blockade, which excluded both of these nations from all the\r\nmarkets of the world, would be much more injurious to England than to\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Chapter II.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Section C.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrices In General.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe price of a commodity is its value in exchange expressed in the quantum\r\nof some other definite commodity, against which it is exchanged or to be\r\nexchanged. Hence, it is possible for any commodity to have as many\r\ndifferent prices as there are other kinds of commodities with which it may\r\nbe compared.(597) But whenever price is spoken of, we think only of a\r\ncomparison of the commodity whose value is to be estimated, with the\r\ncommodity which, at that time and place, is most current and has the\r\ngreatest capacity for circulation. (Money.)(598) When two commodities have\r\nchanged their price-relation to each other, it is not possible, from the\r\nsimple fact of such change of relation, to determine on which side the\r\nchange has taken place. If we find that a commodity A stands to all other\r\ncommodities, C, D, E etc., in the same relation as to price as before,\r\nwhile commodity B, compared with the same, has changed its place in the\r\nscale of prices, we may infer that B, and not A, has left its former\r\nposition.(599)\r\n\r\nThe words costly and dear, as contradistinguished from common and cheap,\r\nboth indicate a high price. We, however, call a commodity costly whose\r\nprice, compared with that of other similar commodities, is high. On the\r\nother hand, we call a commodity dear when we compare it with itself, and\r\nwith its own average price in other places and at other times.(600)\r\n\r\nIn individual cases, the price of a commodity is determined most usually,\r\nand at the same time most superficially, by custom; people ask and pay for\r\na commodity what others have asked and paid for it. If we go deeper and\r\ninquire what originated this customary price and may continually change\r\nit, we come to the struggle of interests between buyers and sellers. And\r\nif science would analyze the ultimate elements of the incentives to this\r\nstruggle and the forces engaged in it, it is necessary that it should keep\r\nin view the entire economy of the nation, and even all national life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section CI.\r\n\r\n\r\nEffect Of The Struggle Of Opposing Interests On Price.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo where in the public economy of a people are the workings of\r\nself-interest so apparent as in the determination of prices. When the\r\nprice of a commodity is once fixed by the conflict of opposing\r\ninterests,(601) the self-seeking of every individual dictates that he\r\nshould thereby gain as much as possible of the goods of others, and lose\r\nas little as possible of his own. In this struggle, the victory is\r\ngenerally to the stronger, and the price is higher or lower, according to\r\nthe superiority of the buyer or seller.(602) But who, in such case, is the\r\nstronger? Political or physical superiority can turn the balance one way\r\nor another only in very barbarous times, and especially in times when\r\nlegal security is small.(603) As a rule, it is the party in whom the\r\ndesire of holding on to his own commodities is strongest, and who is least\r\nmoved by the want of the wares of others. As in every conflict, confidence\r\nin self, sometimes even unbounded confidence in self, is an important\r\nelement of success. A party to a contract of sale or barter, who considers\r\nhis immediate position decidedly stronger than that of the other party,\r\nwill scarcely depart from his demands. Hence it is, that in exchange, one\r\nparty so frequently holds back until the other has expressed his\r\nterms.(604) How different is the price of the same pieces of land which a\r\nnew railroad enterprise is compelled to pay and the prices it would get\r\nfor them, from the adjoining owners, in case of the dissolution of the\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nBut the struggle to raise prices or to lower them, which is always going\r\non, undergoes modifications of every description among all really\r\ncommercial nations, partly through the influence of the public conscience,\r\nwhich brands as inhuman and blameworthy the spoilation of the opposing\r\nparty by acts which the laws do not reach. And this consideration by the\r\npublic conscience is all the more severe in proportion as real competition\r\nin the article sold is wanting.(605) But the chief modification in this\r\nstruggle is produced by the fact, that where civilization has advanced\r\nfarthest, every commodity is offered for sale by a great many and wanted\r\nby a great many.(606) As soon as several seek the same object, there\r\nnaturally results a rivalry among them, which induces each to attain the\r\ndesired end, even by the making of greater sacrifices than others. The\r\ngreater the supply of a commodity is, as compared with the demand for it,\r\nthe lower is its price; the greater the demand as compared with the\r\nsupply, the higher it is. And, indeed, there is question here, not only of\r\nthe _mass_ of things supplied or demanded, but also of the _intensity_ of\r\nthe supply and demand.(607)\r\n\r\nIf the exchange-force of both contractants be equal, or, in other words,\r\nif both, with equal knowledge, are interested in the completion of the\r\nexchange, there results from this attitude of the parties toward each\r\nother, what is called an equitable, or average price, in which both meet\r\nwith their deserts. Here each is a gainer, since each has parted with the\r\ncommodity which was less necessary to him, and received in exchange the\r\ncommodity which was more necessary to him. Looked at, however, from the\r\nstand-point, not simply of a nation’s but of the world’s economy, the\r\nvalue given and the value received are equal.(608)(609)\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the price-relation of two commodities is determined by this\r\nrelation of demand and supply,—by the desire to possess and the difficulty\r\nof obtaining them. We must, therefore, examine on what deeper relations\r\nsupply and demand themselves depend.(610) In the case of the purchaser,\r\nthe value in use of the commodity and his own ability to pay constitute\r\nthe maximum limit of its price, which price may, however, be modified by\r\nthe cost of producing it(611) elsewhere or at another time. In the case of\r\nthe seller, the cost of production is the minimum limit, which may,\r\nhowever, be extended by the cost of procuring the commodity by the\r\npurchaser at another time or place.(612)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section CII.\r\n\r\n\r\nDemand.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purchaser in his demand is wont to consider principally the value in\r\nuse of a commodity, according as it, in a higher or lower degree,\r\nministers to a necessary want, to a decency or to a luxury. The difference\r\nof opinion as to which of these categories any given want belongs depends\r\nnot only on the nature of the country and the customs of its people, but,\r\nfor the most part, also, on the prejudices of class and on personal\r\nindividuality.(613) A reasonable man will employ only the surplus of the\r\nfirst class in the satisfaction of wants of the second, and again only the\r\nsurplus of the second in the satisfaction of wants of the third.(614)\r\n\r\nIf the value in use of a commodity rises or falls, and surrounding\r\ncircumstances remain unchanged, its price also rises or falls.(615)(616)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section CIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nDemand.—Indispensable Goods.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the supply of articles of luxury diminishes, the price of them, it is\r\ntrue, rises. But as now there is a number of purchasers no longer able to\r\npay for them, the demand for them also decreases, and their price, as a\r\nconsequence, rises in a less degree than might be inferred from the amount\r\nand condition of the supply merely. And so, on the other hand, an increase\r\nof the supply which lowers the price is wont, in the case of pleasures\r\ncapable of a wide extension, such as are ministered to by fine roots,\r\nvegetables, etc., to produce an increase of the demand, and this operates\r\nto arrest the falling price.\r\n\r\nIt is quite otherwise, in the case of indispensable goods, as for\r\ninstance, wheat. When there is a want of such an article, men prefer to\r\ndispense with all other articles, to some extent, rather than to practice\r\nfrugality in bread; and all the more, as bread is not so much used as\r\nconsumed rapidly, while clothes and metallic articles last a long time.\r\nAnd even after an over-abundant harvest, leaving voluntary waste out of\r\nthe question, consumption is increased by a finer separating of the flour,\r\nan increase in the amount of corn fed to cattle, and the distillation of\r\nspirits. Hence, demand and supply by no means run in parallel lines at\r\nevery moment; and indispensable articles tend to greater perturbations in\r\nprice than those which can be dispensed with.(617)(618) The price of\r\ngrain, especially, varies in a ratio very different from the inverse ratio\r\nof the amount of the harvest;(619) although a formula therefor expressed\r\nin figures, like that of Gregory King, can never be applicable\r\nuniversally.(620) Farmers must everywhere and always withhold a certain\r\namount of their harvest for seed, for home use etc., from the market. Only\r\nabsolute necessity can induce them to draw on the quantity thus laid by.\r\nBut the ratio of this part to the whole is very different in different\r\ncountries.(621) In the higher stages of civilization, where payment in\r\nmoney has taken the place of payment in produce, and all other kinds of\r\npayment, and where the cultivator of the ground pays the wages of his\r\nlaborers almost exclusively in money, so that they, like all others,\r\npurchase what bread they require in the market; a given deficit in the\r\nharvest must be spread over a much larger market supply; and prices,\r\ntherefore, remain much less affected than in the lower stages of\r\ncivilization.(622) And so, it is clear that a like bad harvest must affect\r\nprices very differently, if there be a large importation or exportation of\r\nthe means of subsistence, and if several bad harvests, or several harvests\r\nyielding more than the average have preceded.\r\n\r\nIn another respect yet, the price of indispensable commodities is very\r\nsensitive, because here the mere fear of a future want of them has a far\r\ndeeper and wider influence, than has the fear of want of articles of\r\nluxury. No matter how good the wheat crop may have been, if the weather\r\nafterwards interferes with its harvesting, the price of wheat, in\r\ncountries in which the spirit of speculation is on the alert, will\r\ncertainly rise, because the prospect of the future crop then becomes\r\nsomewhat doubtful.(623)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section CIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nInfluence Of Purchaser’s Solvability On Prices.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purchaser, besides the value in use of the goods he desires to buy,\r\nconsiders his own solvability (_Zahlungsfähigkeit_ = ability to pay). It\r\nis only solvent demand which can influence prices.(624) For instance,\r\namong a people made up almost entirely of proletarians, there will be a\r\ngreat many cases of starvation and death after a bad harvest, but the\r\nprice of corn will undergo only a slight increase.(625) But where the\r\ngreater number of inhabitants own property, and where the wealthy come to\r\nthe help of the poorer classes by means of poor-rates and acts of\r\nbenevolence, it is scarcely possible to assign limits to the increase of\r\nthe price of corn. By a necessary connection, when indispensable articles\r\ngrow dear, the demand for articles that can be dispensed with generally\r\ndecreases, and _vice versa_.(626) Every merchant, engaged in an extensive\r\nbusiness, is interested in knowing in advance the results of the corn\r\ncrop. The higher the price of a commodity rises, the narrower, of course,\r\ngrows the circle of those who can pay for it.(627)(628)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section CV.\r\n\r\n\r\nSupply.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the case of isolated chance exchanges, the seller, too, takes into\r\nconsideration, first of all, value in use, and compares the satisfaction\r\nwhich the commodity to be parted with and that to be received are able to\r\nafford. It is true that in making this estimate, he is subject in the\r\nhighest degree to error and deception.(629) In the well ordered trade of a\r\nnation whose economy is highly developed, the seller, who had this very\r\ntrade in view in his production, is wont to consider almost exclusively\r\nthe value in exchange of his commodity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section CVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cost Of Production.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs no one is willing to lose anything, every seller will consider what his\r\ngoods have cost him, and the cost of producing or procuring them as the\r\nminimum price to be asked for them.(630) At the same time, the idea\r\ncovered by the expression cost of production, although it always embraces\r\nwhatever disappears from the resources of the producer to enter into\r\nproduction, varies very much according as it is considered from the point\r\nof view of the individual’s, the nation’s or the world’s economy.\r\n\r\nAn individual who pays taxes to his government, and who has rented land\r\nand employed labor and capital to engage in production, must indeed,\r\nbesides the capital he has used in such production, call all his outlay in\r\ninterest, wages, rent, and taxes, by the name of cost of production;(631)\r\nsince, unless they all come back to him in the price of the commodity, the\r\nentire enterprise can only injure him.(632) He will, of course, add an\r\nequitable profit to remunerate him for his enterprise, since without such\r\nprofit, he would not be able to live or produce; or else, he would be\r\ncompelled to consume his capital. The moment the current rates of\r\ntaxation, interest, wages and rent change in a country, the cost of\r\nproduction is also changed in the case of the individual engaged in\r\nproduction, however unaltered the technic process may remain.(633) But\r\ntaking the nation, or all mankind into consideration, we must not lose\r\nsight of the fact that these three great sources of income, as well as\r\ntaxation, are not, rightly speaking, sources from which income flows, but\r\nrather channels through which the aggregate income of the nation or the\r\nworld is distributed among individuals.(634) Hence the wages of labor, for\r\ninstance, which afford the means of living to the greater part of the\r\npopulation, cannot possibly be looked upon simply as a factor in economic\r\nproduction. The people considered in their entirety have the soil gratis.\r\nAll saving made from rent, interest on capital, or wages, is nothing but a\r\nchange of the proportion in which the results of production were\r\ndistributed hitherto among coöperators in production. Such a change may be\r\neither advantageous or the reverse; but it is not a diminution of the\r\namount of sacrifice which the people in general must make for purposes of\r\nproduction. Hence, in a politico-economical sense, to the cost of\r\nproduction, belongs only the capital necessarily expended in production,\r\nand which has disappeared as a part of the nation’s resources, abstraction\r\nmade of the personal sacrifices in behalf of production.(635) The value of\r\nthe circulating capital which in the process is entirely used up, must, of\r\ncourse, be entirely restored in the price, that of the fixed capital used\r\nonly to the extent that it has been used.(636)\r\n\r\nThe risk, which the producer runs until the commodity produced is actually\r\nconsumed must also be borne in mind.(637) There are things which are a\r\nreal risk in small enterprises that by the intervention of an insurance\r\ncompany, or where the enterprises are large and insure themselves, become\r\na more or less variable portion of the cost of production. The price of\r\nthe product, in the latter instance, rises, by this means, very regularly.\r\nIn the former case, the rise depends partly on the feeling of the people\r\nwhether their pleasure in gain is greater than their grief over a\r\ncorresponding loss.(638)\r\n\r\nThose enterprises which necessarily produce different products at the same\r\ntime deserve special consideration.(639) Here we may speak of “_united_\r\ncosts of production,” and all that is needed is that the aggregate of\r\nthese costs should be covered by the aggregate price of both products.\r\nThis complicates to a certain extent the calculations which the seller\r\nmust make to determine his minimum demand for each product. To ascertain\r\nthis, he must subtract from the united costs of production the amount of\r\nvalue which he expects with certainty for the other product.(640)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section CVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nEquilibrium Of Prices.\r\n\r\n\r\nGoods whose cost of reproduction,(641) that is, the highest necessary cost\r\nof reproduction is the same, have uniformly the same value in exchange.\r\nEvery deviation from this level immediately sets forces in motion which\r\nendeavor to restore the level, just as the water of the sea seeks its\r\nlevel, notwithstanding the mountains and abysses which the winds bring\r\nforth from its bosom.(642)(643)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section CVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nEffect Of A Rise Of Price Much Above Cost.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the market price rises high above the cost of production, producers\r\nmake a profit greater than the average profit made in the country. This\r\ninduces them, by the appropriation of new land and the employment of new\r\nlabor and capital, to increase their business. Other parties also engage\r\nin this profitable department of trade. This competition not only makes\r\nthe means of production dearer, but must eventually, by increasing the\r\ndemand, reduce the price of the product to the ordinary level of profit,\r\nthat is to an equilibrium with other commodities.(644) Hence, in the\r\nbeginning, every diminution of the cost of production(645) turns to the\r\nadvantage of the producer; but afterwards and permanently to that of the\r\nconsumers: an economic law exceedingly beneficent in its operations, and\r\nnot unlike the action of positive legislation in the matter of patents.\r\nThere is no greater stimulus to the making of improvements than the\r\ncertainty of reward to the person who first introduces one. The moment,\r\nhowever, that the improvement is imitated by all producers, the advantage\r\ngained by it becomes the common good of the whole nation.(646) These are,\r\nas J. B. Say says, conquests made over the gratuitous productive force of\r\nnature. As a consequence, the value in use of a people’s resources\r\nincreases; generally, also, their value in exchange, in so far as the\r\nproduction of the now cheaper goods increases in a degree greater than\r\ntheir cost of production has diminished.(647)\r\n\r\nAs to the alternative so frequently discussed, whether it is preferable to\r\nmake a large percentage of profit on the sale of a small quantity of\r\ngoods, or a small percentage on a large quantity, we find that, in the\r\nlower stages of civilization, the former is preferred, and the latter in\r\nthe higher.(648) And, indeed, the latter is not only more humane, but, in\r\nthe long run, it is more profitable to the person who adopts it as his\r\nrule in business. In the case of commodities, he now runs but little risk\r\nfrom a change of fashion, because the fashions of the masses change much\r\nless rapidly than those of the upper circles of society. In the case of\r\nindispensable goods, on the other hand, he may now calculate with more\r\ncertainty on the increase of population, and, therefore, on a future\r\nmarket for his wares. Competition, which in former times, devoted all its\r\nefforts to bringing about the exclusion, by law, of all rivals, is now\r\nengaged, principally, in devising means of surpassing them by superiority\r\nof workmanship, and in thus increasing the power of the real sources of a\r\nnation’s wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section CIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nEffect Of A Decline Of Price Below Cost.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the market price sinks below the cost of production, the producer\r\nnaturally suffers a loss, and diminishes his stock as soon as possible.\r\nThat whole establishments engaged in industry should forsake a branch of\r\nit which is suffering from depression and enter a flourishing one, must\r\never remain a rare exception.(649) But the discouraged manufacturer may\r\ndelay renewing his stock on hand,(650) replacing his machinery by new\r\nmachinery; he may dismiss some of his workmen and diminish the number of\r\ndays during which the others shall work. Moreover, most industries are\r\noperated by means of borrowed capital, capital which must therefore, be\r\nreturned to the lender. Under certain circumstances, however, the industry\r\nmay be continued for some time, even at a real loss,(651) so long as the\r\nloss of interest etc., which would follow the entire suspension of the\r\nwork, exceeds the loss produced by the lowering of price, but hardly any\r\nlonger. If the supply of the commodity the price of which has fallen has\r\nbeen diminished, the subsequent result depends on the causes which, in the\r\nfirst place, brought about the fall in price. If the diminution in price\r\nwas caused solely by a too great supply, when this superabundant supply is\r\ngotten rid of, the price will rise again.(652) If it were produced by a\r\ndecrease in the value in use of the commodity, the diminution of the\r\nsupply can restore the former state of things only in so far as at least a\r\npart of the purchasers ascribe to the commodity the same value in use as\r\nbefore.(653) Lastly, if the lowering of the price came from a decrease in\r\nthe number of buyers, or from a decrease in their ability to purchase, the\r\nformer price will be restored when production has been adapted to a\r\ncorrespondingly smaller circle of consumers.(654) This last is true\r\nespecially when the price, without having suffered any absolute change,\r\nhas become relatively too low, on account of an increase in the cost of\r\nproduction.(655)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Chapter CX.\r\n\r\n\r\nDifferent Cost Of Production Of The Same Goods.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost goods are produced at the same time, but under different\r\ncircumstances, at a very different cost. In order to estimate the\r\ninfluence of this fact upon price, we must distinguish between those\r\ncommodities the cheapest manner of the production of which may be extended\r\nat pleasure, and those in the production of which it is necessary, in\r\norder to satisfy the aggregate want of them, to call in the dearest mode\r\nof production to aid the cheapest.\r\n\r\nIn the former instance, the price of commodities is naturally regulated by\r\nthe least cost of production. The person who is unable to sustain this\r\ncompetition permanently, would do a great deal better to abandon the\r\nindustry altogether; for it is not in his power to raise the price by\r\ndiminishing the supply; more powerful rivals would then only need to\r\ncorrespondingly increase theirs.(656)\r\n\r\nIf the same law were applicable, in the latter case, producers placed in a\r\nless favorable situation would be compelled to immediately abandon the\r\nmarket. The market, in consequence, would no longer be able to provide for\r\nthe aggregate need; and the price of the commodity would continue to rise\r\nuntil the producers who had been driven from the market returned to it\r\nagain. Hence, here, price in the long run is determined by the cost of the\r\nproduction of the commodity, produced under the least advantageous\r\nconditions, while such production is necessary in order to satisfy the\r\naggregate need. The person engaged in production under more advantageous\r\nconditions receives in the same price of the goods, which are cheaper to\r\nhim, an excess of profit; one which is greater in proportion as his\r\nsituation, _vis-a-vis_ of production, is superior to that of his less\r\nfavored competitors.(657)(658)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section CXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nDifferent Cost Of Production Of The Same Goods. (Continued.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHence the price of a commodity and the ratio between its supply and demand\r\nmutually condition each other. On the height of the price depends, in\r\ngreat part, how many purchasers shall resolve to make an effectual demand;\r\nbut, at the same time, to what amount of cost of production, sellers shall\r\nextend their supply.(659) We can speak of an equilibrium between supply\r\nand demand only when the former corresponds with the _wish_ of those who\r\nare ready to make good the full cost of production. (_Malthus._) It has\r\nbeen asked, indeed, whether it were more natural and better that demand\r\nshould precede supply or supply demand.(660) But the inquiry is an\r\nillogical one, when expressed in so general a manner, since supply and\r\ndemand are only two sides of the same transaction. But, we may say that in\r\nthe case of indispensable goods, the want of them (demand) is always felt\r\nsooner than the excess of them (supply), and that in the case of goods\r\nwhich may be dispensed with, including, originally, money, the reverse is\r\ntrue. Besides, a person engaging in the production of any kind of goods,\r\ncan, as a rule, only seldom directly investigate the relation between\r\nsupply and demand. Generally, he can do no more than compare the market\r\nprice of the commodity with the cost at which he can produce it. Many\r\nmistakes are inevitable here; but the making of them is the necessary\r\nsacrifice which must be endured to purchase the more than counterbalancing\r\nadvantages of free competition.(661)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section CXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nExceptions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rule that goods which have the same cost of production have also equal\r\nvalue in exchange, is applicable only to the extent that it is possible to\r\ntransfer the factors of production at will from one branch of production\r\nto another. Where this really free competition does not exist, the price\r\ndepends entirely on the quantity of the supply, compared with the\r\nsolvability or capacity to pay of the purchaser; and hence, it may\r\nsometimes rise far above the cost of production (monopoly-price), and\r\nsometimes sink far below it (forced price, or under-price).(662) Such\r\nhindrances to competition depend, in part, upon natural causes. Thus, in\r\nthe case of the works of art of a deceased artist, which cannot be\r\nincreased in number;(663) or in that of living celebrities who cannot\r\nextend their mental activity in the same degree that their reputation has\r\ngrown. So, also, in the case of precious stones, which are sometimes found\r\nfree, and therefore cost nothing, but which, at the same time, have a high\r\nprice.(664) Many valuable agricultural products are, together with their\r\nproduction, limited to a definite and sometimes very small district.(665)\r\nIt is to be regarded as a modification of such natural monopolies when\r\nsubstitutes for a kind of goods which diminish, at least in part, the\r\ndemand for them, are found, at a cheaper price; for instance, ordinary\r\ntable-wines in the stead of fine wines. The rule applies much more\r\nstrictly to those goods which, on account of their greater quantity, can\r\nreplace inferior ones,(666) than it does to those where this is not\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe principal cause of forced or under-prices (_Schleuderpreise_) is the\r\nfacility with which the product deteriorates, and must, therefore, find a\r\nquick sale, especially when its storage or transportation is attended by\r\nfurther difficulties.(667) But, very durable commodities are also subject\r\nto under-prices, and especially those which last longest, because the\r\nsupply of them can be diminished only very slowly. Thus, for instance,\r\nhouses, in a declining city. Distress-prices are found most usually in the\r\ncase of such commodities as are produced without any intention to produce\r\nthem, as for instance, rags and excrementitious substances. The more the\r\nmere forces of nature preponderate in production, the less can the supply\r\nbe increased or decreased at pleasure, the more frequently, as a\r\nconsequence, do we find monopoly-prices and under-prices. (Compare § 131\r\nff.) Thus the production of wheat is invariably connected with the order\r\nof the seasons. Between seed-time and harvest, there are a number of\r\nmonths which neither capital nor skill can shorten to any extent. The\r\ncultivation of land, to be very much greater and more lasting, supposes so\r\nmany conditions precedent, increase of live stock, buildings etc., that it\r\ncan be attained only after a series of years. Hence it happens that wheat,\r\nmuch more than manufactured products, is subject to oppressively high\r\nprices and oppressively low ones, during a long period of time. No matter\r\nwhat the influence of the forces operating in the opposite direction may\r\nbe, the price of wheat depends most largely on the result of the last\r\ncrop.(668)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section CXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nExceptions. (Continued.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOther impediments in the way of freedom of competition have their origin\r\nin social conditions. The rule governing prices applies only where the\r\nvendor and purchaser are equally ready to exchange. But in every case in\r\nwhich the producer carries on his business, not for the sake of free gain,\r\nbut simply to obtain a means of livelihood, it may be subject to many\r\nimportant exceptions.(669) The richer a seller is, the longer can he wait\r\nfor a favorable opportunity to sell. Thus, for instance, wheat is somewhat\r\nlower in price at times when payments are universally made than at other\r\nseasons of the year, because a great many country people are then\r\ncompelled to sell. Where the country population are universally needy, it\r\nsinks after a harvest to an unusually low figure, and in spring rises\r\nagain very high.\r\n\r\nSometimes price is affected by the agreements of the purchaser or seller,\r\nbut most readily by those of middlemen between consumer and producer.(670)\r\nCustoms peculiar to whole classes may exert the same influence, and such\r\ncustoms are especially powerful in the lower stages of business and\r\nindustrial development. They, even at the present time, take the place,\r\nfrequently, of freedom of competition in retail business, in the book\r\nbusiness, and in the determination of lawyers’ and doctors’ fees, as well\r\nas in the distribution of a nation’s income among the three great branches\r\nof its general economy,(671) deciding, instead of competition, how much\r\nshall go to each. Wherever there are guilds, communities, castes etc. with\r\nlegal privileges; wherever there are difficulties placed in the way of\r\nexportation and importation; wherever preëmption rights or\r\nmonopolies,(672) in the strict sense of the word, exist, the leveling ebb\r\nand flow of the elements of production may be still more seriously\r\ninterfered with. Legislation(673) of this sort injures the non-privileged\r\nportion of the population more than it helps the privileged portion. (See\r\n§ 97.)(674)\r\n\r\nThe word _usury_, so arbitrarily used in every-day language, should be\r\nadmitted in science only to designate a famine-price, fraudulently and\r\nintentionally caused or intensified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section CXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrices Fixed By Government.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo power can, of course, fix the price of a commodity in the long run,\r\nwhich cannot at the same time fix the relation of supply and demand.\r\nHence, set prices fixed by governmental authority can be made to play a\r\npart in practice only in so far as they do not establish a price in\r\nopposition to the real state of things, only to the extent that they give\r\nundoubted expression to it in a manner in harmony with natural conditions.\r\nWith this restriction, set or fixed prices may, in the absence of real\r\ncompetition, which can always best determine prices, be useful to both\r\nparties; otherwise one party would at one time, and the other at another,\r\nprofit by an unjust advantage; but it would not be long before both would\r\nsuffer from the perturbation caused thereby in all commercial\r\ntransactions. How pleasant it is for a traveler in Switzerland, or even in\r\nItaly, to find set prices established there.(675) Especially where\r\ncompetition is prevented by state privileges, the establishment of set\r\nprices by the state for the protection of the public may be\r\nnecessary.(676) It is more difficult to fix a set price for a commodity in\r\nproportion to its complexity and to its variableness in quality; and where\r\nthere are different grades of quality of the same commodity, and the\r\ntransition from one grade to another is almost imperceptible, such price\r\nis easily evaded.(677) In the case of every enterprise carried on by many\r\nin common, where no competition is possible, it is necessary to supply the\r\ndefect by means similar to the establishment of fixed prices; as in the\r\ncase of government, by fees for governmental services, and the coöperation\r\nof a chamber of deputies in the imposition of taxes and the determination\r\nof official salaries etc.(678)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section CXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nInfluence Of Growing Civilization On Prices.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the whole, prices become more and more regular as national-economic\r\ncivilization advances. Progress in civilization tends to bring the parties\r\nengaged in the struggle for prices that is buyers and sellers, nearer to\r\none another, in so far as it uniformly decreases the cost of production,\r\nand increases the purchaser’s ability to pay.(679) (See § 101.) The more\r\nuniversal division of labor makes commercial intercourse more necessary to\r\nevery one, at the same time that it makes it more of a habit to him; and\r\nhence exchange ceases more and more to be a matter of caprice or chance.\r\nThe better means of transportation and communication render it easier, in\r\nevery way, for supply and demand to meet. With the advance of general\r\nenlightenment and education, an acquaintance with commodities also becomes\r\nmore general, and every purchaser is on a better way to be able to\r\nestimate the cost of production which the seller has to bear. Hence,\r\nfraudulent prices and prices founded in error become less frequent; and\r\nall this is helped forward by the greater accuracy of weights and\r\nmeasures. The increase of population makes competition more active in all\r\nbranches of trade, while at the same time, with the greater freedom of\r\ncirculation, a number of causes which previously operated to produce very\r\nhigh prices in one place and very low ones in another are removed.(680)\r\nBut especially, the growth of a distinct class of merchants leads to a\r\nuniformity in price. This class are incited by their own interest to\r\npurchase at low prices and sell at high prices. Thus, their competition in\r\nthe former case raises prices, and lowers them in the latter.(681) In all\r\nlower stages of civilization, the custom of making offers and beating down\r\nin price plays a great part, while where culture is higher, the system of\r\nfixed prices (but not by government) gains ground continually. Here\r\nTurgot’s principle is applicable, viz.: that the current price of an\r\narticle is tacitly understood when one asks a merchant the price of his\r\nwares.(682)\r\n\r\nThis proposition is true in the case of individuals, as well as of classes\r\nand of whole nations.(683) It is plain, that under a system of fixed\r\nprices we can more certainly discover what the equitable price is, than in\r\nthe heat of higgling which besides consumes a great deal of precious time.\r\nLastly, one of the principal requisites of a well developed scale of\r\nprices is national honor, and this, doubtless, increases in the higher\r\nstages of civilization, not only because of the greater moral culture\r\nwhich then prevails, but also and especially because that which\r\nconstitutes a people’s real and best interests is better understood.(684)\r\nAmong declining nations, many of these developments take a retrogressive\r\nroad. The very great distinction between rich and poor, between educated\r\nand uneducated, again produces great fluctuations in price. A proletarian\r\npeople who have sunk so low as to live on potatoes will suffer much more\r\nfrom variations in price and of the means of subsistence than a people who\r\nlive on wheat; for the reason that it is so difficult to export or to\r\npreserve(685) potatoes. Nor can it be doubted, that the greatest possible\r\nconstancy of prices is the most beneficial condition that the general\r\neconomy of a people can be in. Where prices change while the cost of\r\nproduction remains the same, one person can only gain what the other has\r\nlost. But such unmerited gains and undeserved losses have an invariable\r\ntendency to destroy the deepest roots of a people’s economic activity; and\r\nintentional speculation based upon such change usually assumes an immoral\r\ncharacter. (Stock-jobbing.)(686) Even if Macleod be right, that an\r\nincrease or decrease in prices is to be regarded as a warning of excess,\r\nthe former of excess of consumption, the latter of production, no one will\r\ndoubt that it is the interest of every organism to confine pain within the\r\nsmallest possible limits, even if its consequences are so beneficial to\r\nthe preservation of the whole body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Chapter III.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoney In General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section CXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstrument Of Exchange. Measure Of Value. Barter.\r\n\r\n\r\nWherever the division of labor is very highly developed, the continuance\r\nof barter, or the direct exchange of one object of consumption for\r\nanother, presents difficulties well nigh insurmountable. How difficult it\r\nwould be always to find the person who could supply us with precisely what\r\nwe wanted, and at the same time have need of what we had a surplus\r\nof.(687) But how much less frequently would it happen that one’s want and\r\nanother’s surplus would correspond exactly the one to the other in\r\nquantity; that, for instance, the manufacturer of nails, desirous of\r\nexchanging his nails for a cow, should meet a cattle-dealer who should\r\nwant exactly as many nails as a cow is worth! Here there is one chief\r\ndifficulty in the way, viz.: that there are so many commodities which\r\ncannot be divided without causing a diminution or even a destruction of\r\ntheir value; and that others cannot be stored away in any quantity without\r\nbecoming a very heavy burthen to their owner. How useful it would\r\ntherefore be, if there was one commodity which should be acceptable to\r\nevery person, at all times, especially if in addition to this, it\r\npossessed the qualities of durability, capacity for transportation and for\r\nbeing stored up and preserved. Any person who possessed a proper supply of\r\nthis one commodity would then be certain of being able to obtain all other\r\nexchangeable commodities through its instrumentality; and every seller\r\nwould be satisfied to exchange what he had to dispose of against this\r\n“universal commodity.” If two values are equal to a third, they are equal\r\nto each other. It is, therefore, a simple matter to use this most current\r\nof all commodities, with which all others are most frequently compared, as\r\na measure of the relative values of all other exchangeable commodities.\r\nThere is need of such a measure, and it is analogous to the want\r\nexperienced by the mathematician who has a column of fractions to sum up,\r\nand who does it by first reducing them all to a common denominator.\r\n(_Storch._)(688) A person entrusted with the duty of assessing the values\r\nof two hundred different articles would be obliged, if he had no such\r\nmeasure to use, to burthen his memory with at least 19,900(689) different\r\nratios. With it, he need carry only 199 in his head.\r\n\r\nSuch a commodity, universally in favor, and which, on that account, is\r\nemployed as an intermediary in the effecting of exchanges of the most\r\nvaried nature, in the measuring of all exchange-values and as a\r\nvalue-carrier (_Werthträger_) in time(690)(691) and space, we call money.\r\n(_Merce universale: Berri; produit préféré: Ganilh; marchandise\r\nintermédiare; Bastiat._)(692)\r\n\r\nThe more enlightened portions of every business community gradually come\r\nto require payment in the commodity which has for the time being the\r\ngreatest circulating capacity. If to this be added the sanction of the\r\ngovernment, and if the government itself recognizes this same “universal\r\ncommodity” as the means of payment of all debts, or as “legal tender”\r\n(_puissance libératoire_), where no other is expressly agreed upon, the\r\n“universal commodity” in question then becomes money in the fullest sense\r\nof the idea conveyed by the word.(693)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section CXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nEffect Of The Introduction Of Money.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the introduction of money, most exchanges are divided into two halves:\r\npurchase and sale.(694) We may also say with Schlözer, that by its means,\r\nexchange, for the first time, becomes a sale, and obscure value in\r\nexchange, clear and definite price. (_Permatio vicina emtioni_). Were\r\nthere no money, the party to an exchange, occupying the most advantageous\r\neconomic position, would possess a much greater superiority over the other\r\nthan he does now. Many a bread-buyer, especially, would be half starved\r\nbefore he could agree with the seller on the quantity of bread to be\r\nreceived in exchange for the commodity he had to dispose of. The producer\r\nof the means of subsistence would here possess an extreme advantage, since\r\nthe urgent necessity of the exchange for the one party, and the power of\r\nthe other to postpone it, would make the determination of the price an\r\nentirely arbitrary matter.(695) Hence, the development of money as the\r\ninstrument of trade, keeps pace with the development of individual\r\nliberty. Payment of wages in money makes the workman more responsible for\r\nhis husbandry etc., but at the same time, freer, than payment in produce.\r\nNow, also, a higher division of labor becomes possible; for the easier it\r\nis to obtain everything else for money, the easier it is for each person\r\nto devote himself exclusively to one branch of business.(696) Without\r\nmoney, too, only ready commodities could be exchanged one against another.\r\nOnly when money has become the instrument of trade, is it possible to\r\nseparate the net from the gross returns, and, therefore, to manage income\r\nproperly. (_Schäffle_). Now, also, it becomes for the first time really\r\nremunerative to produce more than one needs for his own use, and to save.\r\nWithout money, the owner of any one kind of capital, who could not employ\r\nit himself, would be obliged, if he desired to loan it, to find not only a\r\nperson who was in need of capital, but one who needed the very kind of\r\ncapital he had. For instance, the person who had one horse too many, would\r\nbe obliged to look for another who was in need of one etc. And how\r\ndifficult a task it would be to determine the amount of interest, if it\r\nhad to be paid in produce or kind, and even to make a return in produce or\r\nkind of capital which had been presumably used. (_Storch_). Moveable\r\nproperty or resources can attain importance only after the introduction of\r\ngood money, since, previous to such introduction, it was by reason of its\r\ngreat variety,(697) and of its perishable nature, immensely inferior to\r\nlanded property. Hence it is, that money, in a nation’s economy, is what\r\nthe blood is in the life of the animal. It is, so to speak, the common\r\nreservoir in which all food is first dissolved, and by which, at a later\r\nstage, the elements of nutrition and preservation are distributed to the\r\nseveral organs.(698) There is, indeed, no machine which has saved as much\r\nlabor as money. (_Lauderdale_). It is true that the shadows which wealth\r\nis wont to cast, extravagance, avarice and inequality of every kind, may\r\nreadily grow longer and darker in consequence of the introduction of\r\nmoney.(699) But may not the knife which, in the hands of the surgeon, does\r\nso much for life, become an instrument of danger in the hands of a child?\r\nThe invention of money has been rightly compared to the invention of\r\nwriting with letters.(700) We may, however, call the introduction of money\r\nas the universal medium of exchange (money-economy),(701) in which goods\r\nintended for use are exchanged against money(702)—instead of barter\r\n(barter economy), which is a system of public economy (_Schäffle_), in an,\r\nas yet, very little developed form, man being there less sociable with his\r\nfellow men—one of the greatest and most beneficent advances ever made by\r\nthe race.(703)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Section CXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Different Kinds Of Money.\r\n\r\n\r\nVery different kinds of commodities have, according to circumstances, been\r\nused as money; but uniformly only such as possess a universally recognized\r\neconomic value.(704) On the whole, people in a low stage of civilization\r\nare wont to employ, mainly, only ordinary commodities, such as are\r\ncalculated to satisfy a vulgar and urgent want, as an instrument of\r\nexchange. As they advance in civilization, they, at each step, choose a\r\nmore and more costly object, for this purpose,(705) and one which\r\nministers to the more elevated wants.\r\n\r\nA. Races of hunters, at least in non-tropical countries, usually use skins\r\nas money; that is the almost exclusive product of their labor, one which\r\ncan be preserved for a long period of time, which constitutes their\r\nprincipal article of clothing and their principal export in the more\r\nhighly developed regions.(706)\r\n\r\nB. Nomadic races and the lower agricultural races,(707) pass, by a natural\r\ngradation, to the use of cattle as money; which supposes rich pasturages\r\nat the disposal of all. If it were otherwise, there would be a great many\r\nto whom payments of this kind had been made, who would not know what to do\r\nwith the cattle given them, on account of the charges for their\r\nmaintenance.(708)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section CXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Metals As Money.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. That metals were used for the purpose of money much later than the\r\ncommodities above mentioned, and the precious metals in turn later than\r\nthe non-precious metals, cannot by any means be shown to be universally\r\ntrue. Rather is gold in some countries to be obtained by the exercise of\r\nso little skill, and both gold and silver satisfy a want(709) so live and\r\ngeneral, and one so early felt, that they are to be met with as an\r\ninstrument of exchange in very early times.(710) In the case of isolated\r\nraces, much depends on the nature of the metals with which the geologic\r\nconstitution of the country has furnished them.(711) In general, however,\r\nthe above law is found to prevail here. The higher the development of a\r\npeople becomes, the more frequent is the occurrence of large payments; and\r\nto effect these, the more costly a metal is, the better, of course, it is\r\nadapted to effect such payments. Besides, only rich nations are able to\r\npossess the costly metals in a quantity absolutely great.(712) Among the\r\nJews, gold as money, dates only from the time of David.(713) King Pheidon,\r\nof Argos, it is said, introduced silver money into Greece, about the\r\nmiddle of the eighth century before Christ. Gold came into use at a much\r\nlater period.(714) The Romans struck silver money, for the first time, in\r\n209 before Christ, and, in 207, the first gold coins.(715) Among modern\r\nnations, Venice (1285) and Florence seem to have been the first to have\r\ncoined gold in any quantity.(716) Henry III. of England (ob. 1272), was\r\nthe first to coin gold, but with so little success, that for a long time\r\nafter, Edward III. (ob. 1377) was regarded as the first English monarch\r\nwho had coined gold.(717) How little a barbarous people are in a condition\r\nto make use of very costly material as money, is proved by the account\r\nwhich Tacitus gives of the ancient Germans, who preferred silver to gold\r\nin trade.(718) England presents us with an instance of the other extreme.\r\nSince 1816, silver, in that country, has been used only as a species of\r\nchange, and the circulation of gold governs in almost all commercial\r\ntransactions.(719)\r\n\r\nD. The local usage of some countries has raised many other commodities to\r\nthe dignity of instruments of exchange, especially where the population\r\nare poor and the metals which might be used as money have not existed in\r\nsufficient quantities or in the requisite proportion. But people have\r\nalways limited themselves in the material of their money to such\r\ncommodities as are universally acceptable, as uniform as may be, and\r\ncurrent as articles of export or import.(720)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section CXX.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoney—The Precious Metals.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the precious metals are uniformly preferred in highly cultivated\r\nnations(721) as the instrument of exchange, depends on the greatness and\r\nuniformity of their value in exchange, but especially on their durability\r\nand pliancy as to form.\r\n\r\nThis value in exchange is great, because their beauty, which consists in\r\ntheir luster and their sonorous ring,(722) gives them great value in use;\r\nand because, at the same time, their rarity in nature makes the supply of\r\nthem relatively small,(723) and not susceptible of increase at\r\npleasure.(724) As they contain so large a value in so small a volume, they\r\nare adapted to transportation from one place to another, with but little\r\ndifficulty—a matter of the greatest importance in an instrument of\r\nexchange.(725) Hence, it is much easier to keep the demand for them and\r\nthe supply of them at a level all over the world, than it is the demand\r\nand supply of most other commodities. And this all the more as there are\r\nnot different kinds of gold and silver, but only different qualities of\r\ntheir fineness.(726) It also contributes to the uniformity of their value\r\nin exchange, that they minister mainly only to wants of luxury. The most\r\nindispensable commodities are subject to the greatest variations in price\r\n(see § 103), whereas, in the case of the precious metals, the diversity of\r\nuses to which they may be turned contributes greatly to render their\r\nvalue, as instruments of exchange, more equable. If the supply of them be\r\nsmall, gold and silver vessels are less in demand; a part of the old ones\r\nare melted down, and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nIn durability, the precious metals surpass almost all other commodities.\r\nThey are not at all affected by air or water, and they can be corroded\r\nonly by very few fluids. Fire may, indeed, change their form, but scarcely\r\nin any degree the value of the material of gold, and that of silver very\r\nlittle, and then only when it is subjected to a very powerful blast or\r\ndraught of air.(727)(728) Hence, while by laying them by, they suffer\r\nvirtually nothing at all (a most valuable article is an article to deposit\r\nsavings in), their wear and tear from use may be very much decreased by an\r\nadmixture with other metals in the proper proportion.(729) This durability\r\ncontributes largely to keep the price of the precious metals more uniform.\r\nBy the time that the wheat crop is rightly harvested, the great bulk of\r\nthe previously stored wheat is, as a rule, consumed; and, therefore, the\r\nsupply of wheat depends almost entirely on the yield of the last crop. On\r\nthe other hand, it is probable that there is many a piece of money, the\r\nraw material of which was dug from Thracian gold mines in the time of King\r\nPhilip or from the silver mines of Spain during the reign of Hannibal, in\r\ncirculation to-day. Compared with the immeasurable stores of gold and\r\nsilver which have gone on accumulating for thousands of years, the new\r\nyield of them, in any one year, is lost like a drop in a bucket. Hence,\r\nonly when the yield of the mines has continued for a very long time, or\r\nwhen it is exceedingly great or remarkably small, can the price of their\r\nproducts change to any great extent.(730) Even during the revolution in\r\nprices, between 1492 and 1560, the yearly decline in their prices was only\r\none-half of one per cent. per annum.\r\n\r\nTheir great pliability of form has, too, very important advantages for our\r\npurpose: first, that they can be divided very accurately into very small\r\nparts, and that the volume of every part corresponds exactly to the value\r\nof the part;(731) and secondly, that they take an impression at very\r\nlittle cost, an impression which is an authoritative and trustworthy\r\nexpression of their weight and quality, thus saving the commercial public\r\nthe perilous trouble of weighing and testing them every time they are\r\nused.(732)(733)(734) This duty the state, as a rule, assumes. (Coinage.)\r\nWhen its authority, however, is not recognized, as is generally the case\r\nin international trade, gold and silver bars are even now used, and have,\r\ntherefore, to be weighed and tested.(735)(736)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section CXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nValue In Use And Value In Exchange Of Money.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe original value in use of the precious metals, to satisfy certain wants\r\nof luxury in the most aesthetic and the most substantial manner, continues\r\nstill; but with the advance of civilization, the employment of gold and\r\nsilver for this purpose has fallen farther and farther behind the more\r\nrecent employment of these metals as the best material for money. And\r\nsince now the services rendered by money may be divided into two classes:\r\nstoring up or preservation, and the transmission (division, concentration)\r\nof values,(737) the former always plays a greater part in the earlier\r\nstates of the development of trade by money; and the latter plays the\r\nlarger part in the later stages of the same development. We may best\r\ncompare money to the other machines or instruments of commerce.(738)\r\n\r\nThe person who, in times when there is a dearth of goods, and especially\r\nof capital, complains of a want of money, commits the same error as if he\r\nascribed a scarcity or absence of grain, when it exists, to a too small\r\nnumber of wagons to carry it, or to the narrowness of country highways.\r\nThe inference may, indeed, be sometimes well-founded, but certainly only\r\nby way of exception; and yet it is generally the first which\r\npolitico-economical quacks think of in practice.(739) Like all tools or\r\ninstruments, money constitutes a part of an individual’s or a nation’s, or\r\nof the world’s capital. Considered from the point of view of private\r\nbusiness or economy, money is circulating capital, but from the point of\r\nview of the world’s economy, it is fixed capital.(740)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section CXXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nValue In Exchange Of Money.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe value in exchange of money is said to be high when all other\r\ncommodities estimated in money are cheap; and low in the opposite case. We\r\nhave here to do with the application of the most general of all laws of\r\nprice; therefore, with the demand and supply of money. The demand for it\r\ndepends on the wants and the means of payment of its purchasers.\r\nTherefore, if a country has little trade, it will, on this account, need\r\nonly few instruments of trade, that is, of little money to effect\r\nexchanges. If it be poor in other goods, it will get little money in\r\nexchange. In the former respect, there is a beneficent principle of\r\nequalization or compensation which decreases the price-variations of\r\nmoney, no matter of what kind, in the necessity, when the number of\r\nbusiness transactions remains the same and money becomes cheaper, to use\r\nmore of it, and less when it becomes dearer.(741) The supply of money is,\r\nin the long run, dependent chiefly on the cost of production. But since\r\nthe cost of production in different mines is very different, the value in\r\nexchange of the precious metals is determined by the cost of producing\r\nthem from the poorest mines which must be worked in order to supply the\r\naggregate want of them. (See § 110.)(742) The more unfavorable the\r\nconditions of their production are, the greater is the quantity of\r\ncommodities which must be given for a pound of gold, silver etc.; that\r\nproducers may not be deterred from the prosecution of their work. The\r\nextremes of the value in exchange of money are dependent on the use for\r\nwhich it is intended. That value cannot rise higher than to the point at\r\nwhich single pieces of money become inconvenient on account of their\r\nsmallness, nor sink lower than the point at which a similar inconvenience\r\nis produced by their too great size. In both instances, it would become\r\nnecessary to have recourse to other instruments of exchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Section CXXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Quantity Of Money A Nation Needs.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow great the amount of money needed in the entire economy of any state\r\nis, cannot be always rightly determined, either by the amount of the\r\nnational resources, or by the number of the population.(743) It is a very\r\neasy thing to refute the opinion, that the aggregate amount of cash money\r\nin a country constitutes an equivalent of the aggregate amount of all\r\nother commodities to be found there at any time, in such a way that the\r\ntwo pans of this great scales (_Locke_) hang always in a state of\r\nequilibrium, and that an increase of the amount of money, the amount of\r\nall other commodities remaining the same, must be productive of an exactly\r\ncorresponding decrease in the value of each piece of money.(744) Think\r\nonly of the great many commodities which are obtained and consumed without\r\nany exchange whatever! Rather does the amount of money necessary to keep\r\nthe value in exchange of the money employed in a people’s public economy\r\nunaltered,(745) depend on the cooperation of the following conditions:\r\n\r\nA. _The number and extent of such commercial transactions as are effected\r\nby means of money_;(746) a relation which, evidently, increases (see § 56,\r\nff.) with every advance in the division of labor. Hence the transition\r\nfrom serfdom and socage service to free labor, from domestic-servant labor\r\nto day-labor and piece-work, from feudal military service to that of paid\r\nand standing armies, from land-privileges and allowances in produce, such\r\nas fire-bote etc., to the payment of officials in money, from dues in\r\nproduce to taxes in money, and regular lease-hold interests, from\r\nrequisitions to loans of money; in a word, from the barter-economy\r\n(_Naturalwirthschaft_) of the middle ages to the trade by means of money\r\nin the higher stages of civilization, that is, from the “feudal” to the\r\n“commercial” system must, of itself, increase the money-need\r\n(_Geldbedarf_) of a people.\r\n\r\nB. _The rapidity of the circulation of money_; because, in most commercial\r\ntransactions, one dollar which circulates ten times a year really performs\r\nthe same service as ten dollars which go from hand to hand once in a year;\r\njust as the economic use of a ship employed in the transportation of\r\ncommodities does not depend on its commodiousness alone but on its\r\nrapidity also.(747) The economic use of money does not depend on its\r\namount simply. Says _Sismondi_: “The amount of the medium of circulation\r\nin a state must be equal to the sum of the payments made in it in a given\r\ntime, divided by the sum of the times the former has, on an average,\r\nchanged owners within that time.”(748) Under given economic circumstances,\r\nthe rapidity of the medium of circulation is, taken all in all, not by any\r\nmeans an arbitrary matter. It will happen very seldom that one man will\r\npurchase or consume a commodity in order that another may not want\r\nmoney.(749) Were the greater number of money-earners (and in nations with\r\na healthy economic life this number is always made up of men noted for the\r\ngood management of their own affairs) inclined to pay out the money which\r\nthey had taken in, rapidly, a very active production would prevail\r\neverywhere; and this, in turn, supposes general commercial freedom and\r\ngreat legal security. The less these conditions are developed, the more\r\ndifficult it becomes, not only to lay out the money received to-day\r\nproductively to-morrow, but the more imperatively does a proper foresight\r\ndemand, that a reserve-fund should be maintained for times of necessity.\r\n(See § 43.)(750) Even in the same age and among the same people, money\r\nmoves most slowly under the influences of troublesome and critical epochs;\r\nfor the dangers of war and sedition, of impending burdensome taxation,\r\ncommercial gluts and numerous cases of bankruptcy uniformly operate to\r\nmake the possessors of money hold anxiously to their present supply.(751)\r\n\r\nIn less civilized countries, the same condition of things leads the people\r\neven to bury their money-treasures. In large cities, the circulation of\r\nmoney is generally more rapid than in the country districts; in a thickly\r\npopulated than in a thinly populated country; and in trade than in\r\nagriculture.(752) Every improvement in the means of intercommunication\r\ntends to facilitate it. The rich man possesses, as a rule, less money,\r\nrelatively speaking, than the poorer man. Hence, a more equable division\r\nof a nation’s resources among the people would increase the amount of\r\nmoney needed.(753) While the concentration, as to time, of circulation\r\ninto few great terms of payment is calculated of itself to cause a large\r\nsum of money to remain idle in the interval,(754) its concentration in\r\nspace in large commercial cities must dispense with the necessity of a\r\ngreat number of instruments of exchange. In England, it is customary for\r\nevery man in comfortable circumstances, as soon as he receives any money,\r\nto deposit with a banker, and to make all his payments by means of checks\r\nupon the latter. Cash money is now employed by Londoners only in payment\r\nof wages, and in trade between retail dealers and consumers. The banker is\r\nthere the common cashier of a great number of private individuals, and is\r\nin a condition to make their payments for them with a much smaller amount\r\nof money, especially when they are to be made by one of his depositors to\r\nanother.(755) This “union of money-chests” (_Kassenvereinigung_) has been\r\neffected also on a larger scale; inasmuch as bankers, in greater or\r\nsmaller numbers, are wont to have one bank as a center; and the country\r\nbanks, in turn, to be in constant relation with the great moneyed\r\ninstitutions of London, subject to a species of general superintendence by\r\nthe Bank of England. These great monetary institutions have, so to speak,\r\na common rendezvous at the Clearing-House, where the greater part of their\r\npayments are made by a mere off-setting of debits and credits;(756) and\r\nthis bank is, as it were, the cashier-in-chief of the nation, and in\r\npossession of almost the entire cash stores of the English people.(757)\r\n\r\nC. _The quantity and rapidity of circulation of the representatives of\r\nmoney._ These, in so far as they are worthy of the name here given them,\r\ndepend on the credit of those who issue them; that is, on the certainty\r\nthat they shall, at the time fixed, be redeemed in money. To this category\r\nbelong the paper money of the state which bears no interest, and the\r\ntreasury-notes of the state which do bear interest, bank notes, bills of\r\nexchange, promissory notes, book-credits of private persons, sometimes\r\neven certificates of the storage of goods in public stores. It is\r\nestimated, that, at the present time, nine-tenths of all the payments made\r\nin Great Britain are effected without the aid of money, or even of\r\nbank-notes.(758) The capacity of a person to make purchases does not\r\ndepend simply on the amount of money he possesses, but on his credit\r\nlikewise. The person who buys on credit, contributes as much to raise the\r\nprice of commodities as the person who buys for cash; with this exception,\r\nhowever, that when the former eventually fails to redeem his promise to\r\npay, the price raised by him quickly falls again.(759) And, indeed, all\r\nthe various forms of credit, mentioned above, agree essentially in this,\r\nhowever they may differ from one another in costliness and rapidity of\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section CXXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Quantity Of Money A Nation Needs. (Continued.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the three conditions above mentioned, it is evident that the first\r\noperates on the amount of money needed, in a direction opposite to that of\r\nthe other two. The usual course of development is this: among an advancing\r\npeople, the number of money transactions increases at first; later, when\r\neducation has become general, and the people have grown habituated to the\r\ngiving and receiving of credit, the circulation of money is accelerated,\r\nand an increase of the substitutes for money effected. Hence, it is\r\nperfectly natural that the money-need of a people whose public economy is\r\nonly half developed, should, in proportion to the number of inhabitants,\r\nbe greater, not only than that of a people whose economy is wholly\r\nundeveloped, but also, than that of a people whose public economy has been\r\ncarried to the highest point of perfection.(760)(761)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section CXXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nUniformity Of The Value In Exchange Of The Precious Metals.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe peculiar properties of the precious metals described above (§ 120),\r\nexplains satisfactorily enough, why, at the same time, but in different\r\ncountries, they have more nearly the same value in exchange than any other\r\ncommodity whatever. Like a fluid in tubes which communicate with one\r\nanother, the precious metals seek the one same level of value the whole\r\nworld over.(762) Only, it must not be supposed that every absolute or\r\nrelative increase of the amount of money in a country must produce\r\nimmediately a corresponding diminution of the value of money; and in\r\naddition to this cause an exportation of money.(763) If the number of\r\ntrade-transactions increases in the same proportion as the amount of\r\nmoney, the value of money remains entirely unaffected.(764) The same thing\r\noccurs when the increased influx of money, instead of overflowing the\r\nchannels of circulation, only swells the volume in the ready-money\r\nreservoirs. By means of these stores of ready money, very large payments\r\nmay be made by one nation to another, without changing the circulation,\r\nor, therefore, the value of money, in the slightest degree, on either\r\nside.(765) If, indeed, such payments should continue for a long time to\r\nflow in the same direction, they would certainly influence the\r\ncirculation, and then produce a current in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nHowever, it may happen, that the value of money in different countries may\r\nbe permanently different, when there are lasting difficulties in the way\r\nof the leveling influence of the incoming or outgoing current of money.\r\nThus, the precious metals maintain a high value in those countries\r\nespecially which can obtain them only by giving commodities difficult of\r\ntransportation for them. If, for instance, an Englishman, anxious to take\r\nadvantage of the high value of money in Poland, should cause Polish\r\narticles, such as wheat, wood, wool etc., to be imported into England,\r\nthey would reach their destination very much increased in price, because\r\nof the great cost of transportation. Whether Poland or England would have\r\nto bear this cost depends on the relations of supply and demand. Certain\r\nit is, however, that the migration of money is hereby rendered exceedingly\r\ndifficult, forbidden even within the limits of certain value-differences,\r\nespecially where the means of communication are universally bad. And so,\r\nthe smaller the number of countries which minister to the want of\r\ncommodities of precious-metal districts, the more must other nations\r\nobtain the money they need only at second and third hand; by means of\r\nwhich, naturally, money itself is made dearer each time. Now, it is, as a\r\nrule, nations in a low stage of civilization, that engage in the\r\nexportation of raw material, and they are the worst adapted to engaging\r\ndirectly in the carrying on of trade. When, therefore, they do not possess\r\ngold or silver mines themselves, money-value is, as a rule, highest with\r\nthem; especially as the absence of legal security and protection, which\r\ngenerally obtains there, makes the value in use of the precious metals one\r\nof great urgency to them.(766)(767)\r\n\r\nDirect legislative or governmental provisions may operate in the same\r\ndirection; as, for instance, the Japanese embargo laws which, not long\r\nsince, limited all foreign trade to two foreign nations.(768) I intend to\r\ntreat of the influence of taxation on the value of money, in a future work\r\nto be written by me, on the Political Economy of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section CXXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nUniformity Of The Value In Exchange Of The Precious Metals. (Continued.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMost nations can satisfy their want of the precious metals, only through\r\nthe medium of foreign trade. Hence they very naturally look upon the cost\r\nof production of the articles of export by the exchange of which they\r\nobtain the precious metals either directly or indirectly, as the cost of\r\nproduction of these metals themselves. But, the rule that all commodities\r\nof equal cost of production have equal value in exchange is applicable\r\nonly within the limits of the same economic territory (§ 107), for it is\r\nfrequently physically impossible, and still more frequently rendered\r\ndifficult, by laws, customs and states of mind to transfer factors of\r\nproduction from one country to another simply on account of the more\r\nadvantageous market they would there find. Thus, for instance, when\r\nEngland exchanges its cotton and woolen goods, and steel instruments for\r\nMexican silver, the cost of production of the two equivalents may be very\r\ndifferent, and the one party in this trade may permanently make a larger\r\nprofit than the other.(769) According to § 101, that party will be most\r\nfavored in whom the desire of holding to his own commodities is farthest\r\nfrom being out-weighed by his desire to obtain the other. But, at bottom,\r\nsilver is no very indispensable article. Especially in highly civilized\r\ncommercial communities, it is easiest to obtain substitutes for it, while\r\nthe principal articles of English export are, for the most part, objects\r\nwith which to satisfy wants rather urgent in their nature, very general,\r\nand of rapid growth; and which, besides, are not, to any extent, difficult\r\nof transportation. It is not a matter of surprise, therefore, that English\r\ncommodities, in silver countries, are generally sold above the mean price\r\nbetween the English cost of production and the Mexican, for instance, or\r\nthe cost of procuring them elsewhere; and that silver, on the other hand,\r\nis sold in England, under the same. But this lowers the price of the\r\nprecious metals of the latter country in general. Hence a change in the\r\nchannels of international trade, which in most countries is the only\r\nsource of gold and silver, may make the price of the precious metals\r\ndearer in one place and cheaper in another, even when the conditions of\r\nthe production of mines remain entirely unaltered.(770) In an isolated\r\ncountry, any amount of gold and silver whatever would, finally, as soon as\r\nthe people had grown accustomed to it, suffice for all the wants of\r\ncirculation. But, in commerce with the rest of the world, the greater\r\nquantity and greater cheapness of the precious metals, that is of those\r\ncommodities which are most current and are possessed of the greatest\r\namount of economic energy, must, without fail, be of the greatest\r\nadvantage to a country; and this irrespective of the fact that they are\r\nunder certain circumstances the symptom of an especially highly developed\r\npublic economy. If we suppose two nations, A and B, equal in every other\r\npoint, but that A has twice as much money as B, and that prices are twice\r\nas high there as in B; yet, with the same effort or sacrifice, A could\r\nlevy twice as many taxes as B. In case of a war between them, A might pay\r\nin ready money for the necessities of an army which had invaded B, with\r\none-fourth the sacrifice which B would have to make to support its army in\r\nA, if we reverse the case, and suppose that B had invaded A.(771)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Chapter IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory Of Prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Section CXXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeasure Of Prices,—Constant Measure.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we had a measure of prices with the same universality of application\r\nand the same unchangeableness as the measure of length, which is\r\ndetermined by astronomical calculation, we should be able, not only to\r\nclearly understand all the data relating to value, that is to say, a not\r\nunimportant portion of historical science, but we should, moreover, have a\r\npractical means to condition and fix even perpetual annuities, in such a\r\nway, that they would always afford the same economic and purchasing power\r\nto the person receiving them. No wonder, therefore, that political\r\neconomists since Petty’s time have zealously labored to find a _constant_\r\nmeasure of prices.(772) If by this we understand a species of goods such\r\nthat it should always maintain equal exchange-power, as compared with all\r\nother commodities, the idea of a “constant” measure of prices is\r\nunthinkable. We would have to suppose here, that not a single kind of\r\ngoods varied in its price; since, otherwise, at least as compared with\r\nthose that varied in price, the measure of prices would itself be\r\nvariable.(773) But we may, indeed, search for a kind of goods such that\r\nits inherent elements and the elements peculiar to it, so far as it is\r\nitself concerned, and which go to determine price, should exert the same\r\nuniform influence at all times. If there be such a kind of goods, and its\r\nvalue in exchange as compared with other kinds of goods were to vary, we\r\nshould be certain, at least, that the cause of the change was not in it,\r\nbut in them; that _it_ had not grown dearer or cheaper, but that they had\r\ngrown cheaper or dearer. Such a kind of goods would have these two\r\ncharacteristics: A. A given amount of it would, under all circumstances,\r\nhave the same value in use for the same number of persons. B. It would\r\nrequire, under all circumstances, the same cost to produce it, and\r\ntherefore the supply might always keep pace exactly with the number of\r\nthose who demanded it.(774) In this way the supply and demand of this kind\r\nof goods, abstraction made of the quantity of counter-values, would\r\npreserve forever the same invariable relation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Section CXXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nValue In Exchange Estimated In Labor.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdam Smith is of opinion that different kinds of goods, no matter how far\r\nremoved from one another they may be in time or space, have equal value in\r\nexchange, when an equal quantum of human labor may be purchased by their\r\nmeans. He adopts, because of the great differences in work, the average\r\nwork of the common manual laborer. One work-day, and the sacrifice of\r\n“rest, freedom and happiness” therewith connected, are, under all\r\ncircumstances, attended with the same inconvenience (value). If at one\r\ntime this day’s labor will exchange for more, and at another for less, of\r\nany kind of goods, it is only because the price of the latter has fallen\r\nor risen.(775)\r\n\r\nBut we may ask whether the same sacrifice of liberty is as great a\r\nhardship to a Russian as to a Bedouin; or whether the sacrifice of an\r\nequal amount of rest is as hard for the New Englander as it is for a Turk,\r\nor as difficult to endure on a hot day in July as in the cold of winter.\r\nBesides, we have here to do primarily only with value in exchange; and\r\nthat value in the case of day-laborers’ work is subject to very great\r\nfluctuations.\r\n\r\nThe elements on which the demand and supply of labor depend are not, in\r\nthemselves, invariable, nor do their variations usually compensate for one\r\nanother. In progressive nations, the value in use of day-laborers’ work\r\nincreases as well as the capacity of their employers to pay them; but, at\r\nthe same time, as a rule, and at least relatively speaking, the supply of\r\nlabor diminishes on account of the increase in the cost of production of\r\nworkmen. Precisely the reverse of this happens in nations in their\r\ndecline, and in over-populated nations. The workman is subjected to the\r\nnecessity of accepting distress-prices for his work, and especially of\r\naccepting them for a long space of time.(776) How often it happens that,\r\nif only transitorily, when wages are declining, work improves, and _vice\r\nversa_.(777)\r\n\r\nRicardo’s school employs, as the measure of the price of various kinds of\r\ngoods, the quantity of work by which the goods themselves are\r\nproduced.(778) It is evident that the same amount of common labor produces\r\nvery different results, according as it is well or badly conducted. Hence\r\nRicardo must have used the word labor in the sense of labor ideally\r\nadapted to its end. But in this way it would be impossible to reduce all\r\nthe different kinds of labor to a common denominator.(779) Nor could the\r\npeculiar effects of capitalization, or the influence of the natural or\r\nartificial limitations of competition be estimated in terms of such a\r\nmeasure. (See §§ 47, 107, 189.)(780)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section CXXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Precious Metals The Best Measure Of Prices.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is no more possible to find a constant measure of prices than it is to\r\nsquare the circle. (_J. B. Say._) If the two magnitudes to be compared are\r\nseparated from each other in space but not in time, the precious metals\r\nconstitute not only the best measure of their prices, but also a very good\r\none. But the precious metals are subject to very sensible and accidental\r\nvariations in price in long periods of time. If, therefore, we would\r\ncompare sums of money belonging to different times with one another, we\r\nmust first construct a price-current list of all the more important\r\narticles of commerce for the time in question, and in the quantities they\r\nare needed in every day life. We would next have to calculate the average\r\nof these mean prices, and thus to determine the relative value of the\r\namounts to be estimated.(781) The person who should limit his comparison\r\nto a few species of commodities, says von Mangoldt, would lose in\r\nexactness what he gained in comprehensibility.\r\n\r\nIn every such list, the wages of a day would occupy a very important\r\nplace. The desire of exerting an influence over the lives and actions of\r\nother men, and the desire of relatively greater social distinction as\r\ncompared with the social distinction of others, is very general; and there\r\nis scarcely any better evidence that it has been attained than the\r\npossession of the power of controlling a large number of days’ work. The\r\nman who can keep one thousand day laborers is certainly, in a\r\npolitico-economical sense, an important personage. Besides, the height of\r\nday-wages has the most direct influence on the price of many other\r\ncommodities.(782)\r\n\r\nNo less important is the price of wheat, or rather of the principal\r\narticle of food of the people, for the time being, with which the price of\r\ninland raw material—in so far as it can be produced from the same soil\r\nalternately with wheat—and, in the long run, also the wages of labor, are\r\nso essentially connected.(783) The same indispensable necessity of wheat\r\nwhich causes its price to fluctuate so largely from year to year, and from\r\nmonth to month, promotes the uniformity of its average price,(784) when\r\nmany years are taken into the account.(785)(786) (_Malthus._) If, by\r\nreason of great progress made in the art of agriculture, the cost of the\r\nproduction of wheat should fall to one-half of what it was, a large\r\nincrease of population would certainly not be delayed long. And so, on the\r\nother hand, there would be a decrease of population if, by the destruction\r\nof artificial means of irrigation, or other steps in the direction of a\r\nretrogressive civilization, the cost of the production of wheat were to be\r\npermanently increased.\r\n\r\nBut even the average price of wheat, during a long series of years, is not\r\nentirely invariable. The increasing consumption compels the nation, as a\r\nwhole, to provide for its requirement of wheat from less fertile sources,\r\nwhich increases its price generally. It is true that the progress of the\r\nscience of agriculture and of the corn-trade counteract this tendency,\r\nretard the advance of the price of wheat, and may, for a time, produce an\r\nopposite tendency. It is true, also, that the people are induced by their\r\nmost general and vital interests to take advantage of this possibility.\r\nBut spite of the frequency of exceptions to it, the rule remains.(787) If,\r\ntherefore, we wished to so fix a perpetual annuity that it should always\r\nbe worth as much money as a certain quantity of wheat had cost, on an\r\naverage, during the three preceding decades, the thing-value of this\r\nannuity would, on the whole, rise with an advance in civilization.(788) To\r\nobtain something that would remain the same, it would be necessary to\r\ncombine wheat with at least one chief commodity, the intrinsic basis of\r\nthe price of which had a development independent of the price of grain;\r\nbut the whole to be made payable in money. The precious metals are, in\r\nmany respects, so diametrically opposed in properties to wheat, in their\r\ndispensableness, transportable character and durability, for instance,\r\nthat these two classes of commodities are best adapted to act as\r\ncounter-balances to each other.(789)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section CXXX.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory Of The Prices Of The Chief Wants Of Life.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe higher civilization advances, the dearer all those commodities in the\r\nproduction of which the factor nature with value in exchange predominates\r\nare apt to become; and the cheaper, on the other hand, all those in which\r\nlabor and capital play the principal productive part.(790) This is\r\naccounted for, not only by the almost unlimited capacity of labor and\r\ncapital to be increased, while the natural forces which have value in\r\nexchange are susceptible of increase to so small an extent; but also, and\r\nespecially, because new additions of labor and capital are wont to cause\r\nrelatively smaller results in the production of raw material, and\r\nrelatively larger ones in industry and commerce. (§ 33, ff).(791)\r\n\r\nHence, from the relations the prices of the different classes of\r\ncommodities bear to one another, we may draw important conclusions as to\r\nthe degree of civilization which a country has attained. The above law\r\nalso affords an explanation of the fact, that a young nation, which has\r\nmade no great strides in the way of development, and in which, of course,\r\nthe production of raw material preponderates, draw their commercial and\r\nmanufactured necessaries, by way of preference, from precisely the most\r\nhighly civilized foreign nations. The latter are in a condition, and\r\naccustomed, to give the largest quantity and the best quality of\r\nmanufactured articles for a required quantity of raw material; and, of\r\ncourse, _vice versa_. Hence, in this intercourse of nations, the most\r\nurgent want, and the completest and easiest possibility of satisfying it,\r\nmeet.(792) Only very highly civilized mother-countries can hold fast to\r\ncolonial possessions in our day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section CXXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory Of The Prices Of The Chief Wants Of Life. (Continued.)\r\n\r\n\r\nA. In the case of a great many raw materials, we repeatedly find the\r\nfollowing to be the course of development. In the lower stages of\r\ncivilization, they grow of themselves, and in such quantities that a small\r\namount of labor, and that only the labor of occupation, more than suffices\r\nto satisfy the small demand for them. Here, naturally enough, the price of\r\nraw materials is very low. After this, it rises with every advance made in\r\ncivilization, for two reasons: first, because the demand becomes greater\r\nand greater; and then, because the naturally free sources of production,\r\ncalled into requisition by other wants, now flow less and less\r\nabundantly.(793) This rise in price continues until the point is reached\r\nat which it becomes customary, instead of the mere occupation of the free\r\ngifts of nature, to bring forth the commodities in question by the more\r\nlaborious process of production proper. From this time forward, the usual\r\nseeking of prices for a level requires that our commodity should, like all\r\nothers which suppose an equal sacrifice of the means of production, claim\r\nan equal value in exchange. If from any peculiar causes, the production of\r\nthis commodity is not at all possible, or if it is capable of no great\r\nextension, its price, which would under the circumstances, be limited only\r\nby the purchasing power of the buyer, might attain the utmost extreme\r\nreached in prices under the spur of vanity or of the mere love of the\r\ncommodity itself. The latter is true especially in the case of\r\nvenison;(794) the former, in the case of the tame cattle,(795) fresh-water\r\nfish,(796) and wood.(797)(798)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Section CXXXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory Of The Prices Of The Chief Wants Of Life. (Continued.)\r\n\r\n\r\nB. The rise in prices is observed earliest in that class of goods in\r\nquestion which by reason of their small volume and their comparatively\r\ngreat value, and by reason of the greater capacity to be kept in a state\r\nof preservation for a longer time, are best adapted to seeking a more\r\nfavorable market. This applies particularly to the skins, fleece, hair,\r\nfeathers, teeth, horns, etc., of animals, in which, in the breeding of\r\nstock, etc. people in a low stage of civilization are much more apt to\r\nspeculate than in their meat. Here it is considered, and rightly so, to be\r\nmuch more profitable to raise many animals which are badly cared for, than\r\na few, that are well cared for; for the care bestowed on animals has, as a\r\nrule, much more influence on the body itself than on their covering.(799)\r\nIn fisheries, caviar, sturgeon-bladders, oil and whalebone;(800) and in\r\nforest-culture, pitch, tar, potash and, to some extent, building material\r\netc., play the same part.(801)\r\n\r\nConversely, the price of those portions which are most difficult of\r\ntransportation, by reason of their volume or of the difficulty of\r\npreserving them, rises latest. To this category belongs milk, the\r\nproduction of which in a fresh state can be made an object of economic\r\nspeculation, only where civilization is at its very highest, and\r\nespecially in the vicinity of large cities.(802) It is indeed possible by\r\nits transformation into butter or cheese to preserve milk and make it\r\ncapable of transportation. But to carry on such a business for the\r\npurposes of trade, a care and a cleanliness are needed which are national\r\ncharacteristics only of a highly civilized people (§ 229), and the\r\npreparation of a superior quality of cheese, which is always a very long\r\nprocess, is conditioned by the employment of capital long in advance of a\r\nreturn, and which no poor nation is in a condition to make.(803) Cows are\r\nprimarily milk-producing animals.(804) Hence their price, as a rule, rises\r\nlater than that of oxen, but, in the higher stages of civilization, it\r\nrises much more surprisingly. Something analogous is true of those\r\nproducts which result from what remains after the production of other\r\ngoods or commodities. As long as this alone supplies the demand, the cost\r\nof production of the former commodity is almost nothing, and hence its\r\nprice is very low. For this reason hogs are relatively cheap in two very\r\ndifferent periods of a people’s national economy, in a very low stage of\r\ncivilization where forests are plentiful and they are fattened on acorns\r\nand the nuts of the beech, and also when they may be considered as a\r\ncollateral product of some great industry, such as distilleries and\r\ndairy-farming; and when raised by a numerous, especially a rural\r\npopulation of small means and laborers, in order to turn to advantage, in\r\nthe former instance, the remains of production, and in the latter of\r\nconsumption.(805) Where neither of these two reasons obtains, the price of\r\nhogs is wont to increase largely with an advance in\r\ncivilization.(806)(807)(808) (See Roscher, Nationalökonomik des\r\nAckerbaues, §§ 177 ff.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Section CXXXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory Of The Prices Of The Chief Wants Of Life. (Continued.)\r\n\r\n\r\nC. Those raw materials which, from the very first, have been obtained by\r\nthe means of production properly so called, maintain a much greater\r\nuniformity in price. In the lower stages of civilization, they are never\r\nfound permanently in excess; and as the economy of a people advances, the\r\ngrowing dearth of natural forces may be more or less counterbalanced by\r\nthe greater cheapness of capital and labor. This is true, especially of\r\nwheat. (See § 129, and Roscher, Nationalökonomik des Ackerbaues, p.\r\n43.)(809)\r\n\r\nD. In the case also of those raw materials which are objects of\r\noccupation, and never of real production, as, for instance, minerals, a\r\nprogressive public economy, by altering the different elements of price in\r\nan opposite direction, may leave their price on the whole unchanged. Here,\r\nindeed, the discovery of new and especially of rich natural stores may\r\nexert an incalculable influence; but such “accidents” underlie the laws of\r\nhuman development only to the extent that those ages which are\r\nintellectually most active are those also which are most industrious and\r\nfortunate in the discovery of their natural resources.(810)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Section CXXXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory Of The Prices Of The Chief Wants Of Life. (Continued.)\r\n\r\n\r\nE. The products of industry become cheaper and cheaper as economic culture\r\nadvances; whereas, for instance, in England, towards the end of the middle\r\nages, a single shirt was considered of importance enough to be made not\r\nunfrequently an object of testamentary bequest.(811) And, indeed, the\r\nprice of industrial products sinks lower the more important the part\r\nplayed in their production by capital and the division of labor is as\r\ncompared with the part played by the raw material.(812) On this account,\r\nin recent times, fine cloths have grown, relatively speaking, much cheaper\r\nthan coarse ones.(813) Lead, which during the middle ages in England was\r\nmuch cheaper than iron, because of the difficulty of mining the latter,\r\nhas become much dearer in our days.(814) Conversely, where raw material\r\nplays the most important part in manufactures, the price of the\r\nmanufactured article may increase with an advance in civilization. Hence,\r\narticles made of wood are procured at the cheapest rates in mountainous\r\ncountries, where the division of labor is not carried very far, but where\r\nthe raw material is cheap.(815)\r\n\r\nF. But the price of commodities decreases, especially in the higher stages\r\nof civilization, to the extent that it is dependent on commerce.(816) Here\r\ncapital and human labor almost exclusively are effective, and the modern\r\nimprovements of communication, legal security and competition are\r\nespecially striking.(817)\r\n\r\nG. Since personal services are, as a rule, performed and received only by\r\nindividuals, the principle in accordance with which labor in general\r\nbecomes cheaper in the higher stages of civilization, does not apply to\r\nthem to any great extent.(818) Yet we may claim that advancing\r\ncivilization has pretty universally a twofold influence on the price paid\r\nfor personal services. In the first place, freedom of competition, with\r\nthe more accurate and equitable determination of price which it produces\r\n(in contradistinction to servitude, privilege and custom) always tends to\r\nobtain the upper hand; and further, by the growing combination of labor\r\nand of use (§§ 56, ff. 207), a better and better and more clearly defined\r\ngradation between ordinary services and those of a higher order is\r\neffected. When the latter cannot be increased at pleasure, the price paid\r\nfor them may, as the wealth of consumers increases, become, from motives\r\nof vanity or of custom (_Gebrauchsgründen_), almost unlimited. The dancing\r\nmaid, to whom Herod (Mark, 6, 23) promised even the half of his kingdom,\r\nis both in a politico-economical and in a moral sense a warning example to\r\nover-refined nations.(819)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section CXXXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory Of The Values Of The Precious Metals.—In Antiquity And In The\r\nMiddle Ages.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to write a real history of the values of the precious\r\nmetals in ancient and medieval times: the sources of information are too\r\nfew. But it does seem possible to suggest some fragments and something of\r\nthe development of that history,(820) at least in outline.\r\n\r\nThus, for instance, the supply of the precious metals furnished by the\r\nmines, in the earlier times of ancient history, was kept from entering the\r\nmarket by the system which then prevailed everywhere, of hoarding treasure\r\nby the state, by the temples etc., and later by great reserves of treasure\r\nkept by individuals.(821) The revolutions in prices in ancient times were\r\nproduced as frequently by the sudden opening of such reservoirs, as by the\r\ndiscovery of richer sources. Thus, for instance, such events as the\r\ndissipation of Pericles’ treasures, the subsidies of the Persian kings,\r\nthe spoliation of many temples in consequence of declining religiousness,\r\nthe distribution of Persian treasures by Alexander the Great,(822) had a\r\nvast influence on the undeniable rise in the price of Greek commodities in\r\nthe century succeeding the Peleponnesian war.(823) Later, it is said that\r\nin Rome, the price of pieces of land was doubled by the influx of Egyptian\r\nwar-booty.(824) It is a remarkable proof of the undeveloped condition of\r\ntrade in the earlier periods of ancient history, that the perturbations in\r\nprices were, apparently, at least, so entirely local. Phœnicia, Palestine\r\netc., must have experienced, in the age of Solomon, a formal deluge of the\r\nprecious metals, while Greece, for instance, was then, and for centuries\r\nafter, extremely poor in them.(825) It is not, on the whole, to be\r\ndoubted, that the value in exchange of the precious metals was on a\r\ncontinual decline until the most flourishing time of the Roman\r\nemperors.(826) During the middle ages, it seems to have stood much higher\r\nagain; because the great loss of treasure caused by the migration of\r\nnations etc., the almost complete cessation of production at the mines,\r\nand the slowness of the circulation of money, played a much more important\r\npart than the decrease of trade.(827)(828)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Section CXXXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nEffect On The Discovery Of American Mines Etc. On The Value Of The\r\nPrecious Metals.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe discovery of America influenced the market of the precious metals less\r\nby the peculiar wealth of the mines in that part of the world than by\r\ntheir almost incredible number.(829) The sources of wealth that the\r\nconquistadores first lighted upon were, however, much over-estimated.(830)\r\nThe production of the American mines first assumed great importance after\r\nthe discovery of Potosi, in 1545, which was soon followed by the working\r\nof the American mines at Guanaxuato. (1558.) Coincident with this was the\r\nextraordinary “chance” of Medina’s invention, in 1557; by means of which,\r\nit became possible to separate silver from foreign elements by the cool\r\nprocess of amalgamation, instead of melting it as had hitherto been done;\r\nan invention all the more important in America, for the reason that in\r\nthat country, where there is so much rich ore, there is scarcely any fuel,\r\nin the neighborhood(831) of where it is found. During the first hundred\r\nyears the mines of Peru occupied the most prominent place; whereas they\r\nwere afterwards completely overshadowed by the Mexican.(832) According to\r\nHumboldt,(833) the annual export of gold and silver from America to\r\nEurope, between 1492 and 1500, amounted to 250,000 piasters; between 1500\r\nand 1545, to 3,000,000;(834) from that time to 1600, to 11,000,000; in the\r\nseventeenth century, to about 16,000,000; during the first half the\r\neighteenth century to 22,500,000; during the second half, to 35,300,000.\r\n\r\nThe production of gold in Brazil began to be important after the\r\ncommencement of the eighteenth century,(835) and the working of the\r\nMexican silver mines of Valencia, Biscaina etc. from the middle of the\r\nsame century. In the beginning of the nineteenth century, Mexico produced,\r\nannually, 537,512 kilogrammes of silver, and 1,609 kilogrammes of gold;\r\nPeru, 140,078 and 782 of silver and gold respectively; Buenos Ayres,\r\n110,764 and 506; Chili, 6,827 and 2,807; New Granada, 4,714 kilogrammes of\r\ngold; Brazil, 3,700 kilogrammes of gold; the whole of America together,\r\n795,581 kilogrammes of silver and 14,018 kilogrammes of gold, worth about\r\n60,750,000 thalers.(836) During the uprisings between 1810 and 1825, which\r\nseparated Spanish America from the mother country, the production of the\r\nmines diminished as surprisingly as it had increased in the previous\r\ngeneration by reason of the greater liberality of Spanish colonial\r\npolicy.(837) Since that time, a certain increase has, indeed, been\r\nnoticed, which, however, had not immediately before the discovery of the\r\ngold mines of California by any means attained the height reached in 1808,\r\nbut only an annual production of 701,570 kilogrammes of silver, and of\r\n15,215 kilogrammes of gold, with an aggregate value of more than\r\n56,000,000 thalers.(838)\r\n\r\nIn Europe, also, the obtaining of the precious metals during the fifteenth\r\nand sixteenth centuries took a great stride, especially in Germany;(839)\r\nbut, on the other hand, the Spanish gold and silver mines were closed in\r\n1535 by a law. In the seventeenth century, there was another lull,\r\nfollowed, at the end of the eighteenth, by a second period of activity\r\nwhich has not yet closed. The great development of the production of gold\r\nin the Ural mines since 1819, and in the Altai mines since 1829,(840) the\r\nrevival of the production of silver in the old Spanish mines since\r\n1835,(841) and Pattinson’s discovery, by means of which the poorest lead\r\nores containing silver may be refined, are here of great importance.(842)\r\nShortly before 1848, it was estimated that all the mines of the old world\r\nproduced annually about 274,000 kilogrammes of silver, and 56,000\r\nkilogrammes of gold, with an aggregate value of over 69,000,000\r\nthalers.(843)(844)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Section CXXXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nRevolution In Prices At The Beginning Of Modern History.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mere discovery of new and richer mines need not, of itself, lower the\r\nprice of the precious metals. Their price depends on their cost of\r\nproduction; and it may be very much increased, even under the most\r\nfavorable natural conditions, by the unskillfulness of labor, the dearness\r\nof the means of subsistence, of machinery and of auxiliary substances, by\r\ninsecurity to property or to the person; by war, oppressive taxes(845)\r\netc. The new mines can produce a decline in the price of the precious\r\nmetals only to the extent that, for the same amount of capital and labor\r\nexpended, they, spite of all such deductions, produce a greater\r\nresult.(846)\r\n\r\nI opine that the price of metallic money, since the discovery of America,\r\nhas diminished until the present time in the ratio of from three to four\r\nto one.(847) The prices of wheat in France, from 1800 to 1850, were about\r\nseven times as great as in the second half of the fifteenth century; and\r\nin England about six times as great. But, it is not to be overlooked here,\r\nhow wheat may have grown dearer in itself (_an sich_) and how gold\r\ndeclined considerably less than silver. True, this decline of the precious\r\nmetals was not an entirely steady one. We meet at the beginning of the\r\nmodern era with a real revolution in prices. The prices of rye, in lower\r\nSaxony, from 1525 to 1550, were twice as high as from 1475 to 1500.\r\nAccording to Garnier, the French prices of wheat, from 1450 to 1500, were,\r\non an average, 408 francs of the present time per _setier_; from 1501 to\r\n1520, 5 francs; from 1522 to 1540, 11.26 francs; from 1541 to 1560, 11.69\r\nfrancs; from 1561 to 1580, 21.33 francs; from 1581 to 1600, 32.51 francs;\r\nduring the first half of the seventeenth century, 22.77 francs; in the\r\nsecond half, 26.83 francs; from 1701 to 1750, 19.64 francs. Similarly in\r\nEngland, where wheat cost, from 1560 to 1600, 2.64 times as much as from\r\n1450 to 1500.(848)\r\n\r\nNow, the increased production of the mines cannot be the only cause of\r\nthis great perturbation in prices. It commenced, in most countries, at a\r\ntime when the supplies from America were still too small to account for\r\nsuch an effect. One of the chief causes of the phenomenon was, that\r\nprecisely at this period, there was in so many nations a transition from a\r\nsluggish circulation of money, made still more sluggish by the custom\r\nwhich everywhere prevailed of hoarding treasure, to a rapid circulation,\r\nwhich was made still more rapid by the use of all kinds of substitutes for\r\nmoney. (§ 123).(849) In the earliest ripe fruit of European civilization\r\n(Italy), this transition had long been accomplished; and, on that account,\r\nthe value in exchange of the precious metals was there, for a long time\r\nprevious, comparatively low.(850)\r\n\r\nFrom the second third of the seventeenth century, the value of the medium\r\nof circulation seems, on the whole, to have remained stationary.(851)\r\nTooke seeks to demonstrate the steady decline of the value of money until\r\nlate in the eighteenth century, from the fact that the wages of labor\r\nincreased during that time; but I should rather connect the latter\r\nphenomenon with the simultaneous elevation of the classes engaged in\r\nmanual labor. And so Adam Smith infers a rise in the price of money after\r\nthe beginning of the eighteenth century, from the prices of wheat;(852)\r\nbut it would be better to consider the cause of this to be the unusually\r\nlong series of good crops.(853) An equally unusually long series of bad\r\nharvests, during the second half of the century, accounts satisfactorily\r\nfor the simultaneous rise of the medium prices of corn. The great war\r\nwhich lasted from 1793 to 1815, too, according to a very prevalent\r\nopinion, must have caused the value of money to decline; a fact which is\r\ngenerally accredited to the increase of paper money in so many states.\r\n\r\nEvery great war may very easily have for effect to slacken the speed of\r\nthe circulation of money, to promote the hoarding and even the burial of\r\ntreasure for a rainy day, and to paralyze credit and its power to supply\r\nthe place of money. Hence, it seems preferable to seek for the cause of\r\nthe variations in price, during the great war, in the commodities\r\nthemselves whose price was affected; since their production must have been\r\nenormously disturbed. It rendered the brawniest men and the most powerful\r\nhorses unproductive, and even employed them as agents of destruction. It\r\ninterrupted trade in a thousand ways, or drove it into unnatural channels,\r\nand turned the intellectual interests of nations into every direction save\r\nthat of economic industry. To this must be added the absence of security\r\neverywhere.(854)\r\n\r\nThe cessation of these restrictions upon production, in consequence of the\r\nrestoration of peace throughout the world and the great progress\r\nafterwards made in almost all branches of industry, explain why, from 1818\r\nto 1848, the precious metals have apparently stood higher than during the\r\nperiod immediately preceding.(855)(856)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Section CXXXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nRevolution In Prices.—Influence Of The Non-Monetary Use Of Gold And\r\nSilver.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo understand why so great an increase in the production of the precious\r\nmetals produced so small a decline of their value in exchange, we must\r\nturn our attention to the other and further uses of gold and silver. The\r\namount devoted to these uses can never be very accurately determined,\r\nsince governmental stamping of every new gold or silver article would\r\nafford no evidence as to the number of such articles manufactured out of\r\nold articles etc.(857) Certain it is, however, that the aggregate amount\r\nof gold and silver thus employed, increases with the increase of luxury\r\nand wealth among modern nations, and that a quantity of the precious\r\nmetals thus used, especially when used for purposes of gilding for\r\ninstance, is irrestorably lost.(858) In addition to this, there is the\r\nwear and tear of coin in circulation, which is naturally greater in the\r\ncase of large pieces than of small, and, therefore, in the case of silver\r\nthan of gold. There is, further, the damage caused by the loss of coin in\r\nconflagrations and shipwrecks, and that occasioned by buried and forgotten\r\ntreasure.(859)\r\n\r\nBut, lastly, the principal cause consists in the powerful increase of the\r\ndemand for money, which, during the last two centuries, the great impulse\r\ngiven to the rapidity of circulation, and the great increase in the\r\nsubstitutes for money, have scarcely been able to outweigh. Besides the\r\ngreat growth of population and of wealth, at least in Europe and the new\r\nworld, I need call attention only to the immense advance made in the\r\ndivision of labor, and to the transition from trade by barter to trade\r\nthrough the instrumentality of money. The entire war and merchant marine\r\nof England, about 1602, had, according to Anderson, a capacity of only\r\n45,000 tons,—that is, not one-fifth of what the small city of Bremen has\r\nnow; a capacity which at the close of the year 1873 amounted to 237,206\r\ntons—while in 1872 its merchant marine alone had a capacity of 7,213,000\r\ntons. The aggregate foreign trade of England, France, Russia and the\r\nUnited States, in 1750, amounted to about 260,000,000 thalers; in 1864, it\r\nwas over 5,400,000,000, and between 1871 and 1872, in one year, over\r\n9,000,000,000 thalers. Nor should it be forgotten that Europe’s trade with\r\nthe East, since the beginning of the sixteenth century, increased\r\nimmensely. This, at present, produces uniformly a very “unfavorable\r\nbalance” for Europe, which can be made up for only by very large shipments\r\nof silver to foreign parts.(860) If China and India were suddenly to draw\r\non us for other commodities instead of gold and silver, the result would\r\nbe a great revolution in prices in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Section CXXXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory Of Prices.—Californian And Australian Discoveries.\r\n\r\n\r\nTengoborski is of opinion, that the flow of gold from Siberia alone would\r\nhave been absorbed by the ever-increasing want of civilized nations of\r\nmoney; but that the coincident discoveries in California and Australia, in\r\nSeptember 1847, and February 1851, must sooner or later produce a\r\nrevolution in prices. And, indeed, the fecundity of these countries is\r\nunparalleled. North America, which in 1846 produced only 3,600 pounds of\r\ngold, according to Sœtbeer, produced in the years from 1849 to 1863,\r\nrespectively, 118,000, 148,000, 178,000, 195,000, 180,000, 165,000,\r\n165,000, 165,000, 160,000, 145,000, 125,000, 120,000, 115,000 and 110,000.\r\nAustria produced in the years from 1851 to 1863 respectively, 27,000,\r\n196,000, 250,000, 160,000, 170,000, 195,000, 180,000, 175,000, 160,000,\r\n150,000, 160,000, 160,000, 170,000, pounds of gold.\r\n\r\nFrom 1864 to 1867, the aggregate production of gold in the world was,\r\naccording to the last mentioned authority, a yearly average of 188.4\r\nmillions of thalers, and of silver, 94.8 millions. In Europe, Russia not\r\nincluded, the production was, in 1863, 3,960 pounds of gold and 405,000\r\npounds of silver; in the Russian Empire, 46,500 pounds of gold and 40,000\r\nof silver; in Mexico 12,000 pounds of gold and 1,250,000 pounds of silver;\r\nin South and Central America, 12,500 pounds of gold and 520,000 pounds of\r\nsilver; in Africa, India and Lesser Asia, 30,000 pounds of gold and 40,000\r\npounds of silver—a total of 384,000 pounds of gold, and 2,905,000 pounds\r\nof silver. F.X. Neumann(861)(862) estimates that the whole world produced,\r\nin the years 1868-1870, annually, 192.8 million thalers of gold, and 94\r\nmillion thalers of silver; and in 1873, of both metals, 291 million\r\nthalers.\r\n\r\nThe question, whether in this second half of the nineteenth century, we\r\nare to have a revolution in prices similar to that which took place in the\r\nsixteenth century can be answered only hypothetically. The gold diggings\r\nnow most productive will, probably, as we may judge from analogous cases\r\nin the past, be soon exhausted.(863) But it is entirely possible that, for\r\na long series of years, other diggings will be found equally rich. It is\r\nalmost certain that the restless activity of the English and of North\r\nAmericans will not cease until they have exhausted the favors of\r\nnature.(864) Every improvement in agriculture, in the means of\r\ncommunication, and in the public security of the gold lands, makes the\r\ncost of production smaller. There are doubtless in other countries a great\r\nmany _placers_ which need only to be touched with the finger of European\r\ncivilization to produce gold in abundance.(865) It would, indeed, be\r\nnecessary that this same civilization should make these same countries\r\nbetter markets for the precious metals by increasing their demand.\r\n\r\nSo far as silver is concerned, there can be no question that America\r\npossesses mines unlimited in extent, and, as yet, almost untouched. “The\r\ntime will come,” says Duport,(866) “a century sooner or later, when the\r\nproduction of silver will have no other limits than those put to it by the\r\ncontinual decline in the price of silver.” There seems, also, to be no\r\nlack of quicksilver, especially in California; and the cost of its\r\nproduction hitherto may be lessened very much by the labor of better\r\nworkmen, machines and means of transportation.(867) All this supposes\r\ngreat progress of the mining countries in civilization in general; and\r\nyet, thus far, Mexico’s republican independence etc., as compared with the\r\nlater years of the Spanish colonial system there, is a great\r\nretrogression. The conquest of Spanish America by the United States would\r\ngive a vast impetus to economic improvement; and here, again, the increase\r\nof production would be attended by an increased demand.\r\n\r\nBut especially must the demand for the precious metals, which naturally\r\nincreases with the wealth, commerce and luxury of nations, constitute a\r\ndecisive element in answering our question. Nothing, for instance, were a\r\nreduction in prices impending, would promote it so much as a series of\r\ndevastating wars or revolutions in Europe. Moreover, it should not be\r\nforgotten, that the money market is now almost commensurable with the\r\nworld, and will soon embrace it within its limits; and that market\r\nembraces not only the precious metals but the numberless representatives\r\nof money and media of credit. The basin, therefore, to which the gold and\r\nsilver streams of the world are tributary is immeasurably greater than it\r\nwas in the sixteenth century; its level cannot be changed as readily, and\r\nan equal addition made every year to its previous contents can increase it\r\nonly by a small amount.(868) Nor could a considerable decline of the value\r\nof the precious metals be readily produced without making the circulation\r\nof money slower, and the employment of means of credit relatively less\r\nfrequent, in consequence of which, the further decline would, to a certain\r\nextent, be arrested.(869) In the case of other commodities a decline of\r\nprices leads only probably to an absolutely greater demand; in the case of\r\nmoney, it leads to a demand necessarily greater. That the money market in\r\nour days can stand pretty rude shocks is evident from the fact, among\r\nothers, that the price of gold is so high as compared with that of\r\nsilver.(870)(871)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section CXL.\r\n\r\n\r\nRevolution In Prices.—Its Influence On The National Resources.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ulterior consequences of such a revolution in prices would contribute\r\nto the real wealth of a people only in the sense that they would place\r\nsuch a people in a way, with less sacrifice, to employ the precious metals\r\non a large scale in ministering to the luxuries of life. This small\r\nadvantage itself would be counterbalanced by the depreciation of the\r\nmetallic stock, and especially by the necessity of henceforth devoting a\r\nlarger quantity of gold and silver to the purposes of circulation.(872)\r\nBut such a revolution would produce a sudden reverse in the distribution\r\nof a nation’s wealth among its constituent members. All those who, by\r\nvirtue of contracts antecedently made, have payments to effect, are\r\nbenefited to the extent of the difference between the old and the actual\r\nprice, while those who are to receive such payments lose to the same\r\nextent.(873) Therefore, those engaged in industrial enterprises improve\r\ntheir condition, because they immediately increase(874) the prices of\r\ntheir own productions; and, for a time at least, continue the use of\r\ncapital borrowed from others, of land leased or rented etc. at the old\r\nprices.(875)\r\n\r\nBesides, at the beginning, and before a corresponding depreciation of its\r\nvalue has taken place, an increase of money produces as a rule a low rate\r\nof interest (§ 185), and an itch to buy on the part of the public. All\r\nthis may serve as a powerful stimulant to production on a large\r\nscale.(876) Those most certain to suffer loss are officials(877) with a\r\nfixed salary, and so-called annuitants, creditors of the nation and of\r\nindividuals. Even bankers, too, have no means to fix the value of their\r\nwares which they see disappearing, so to speak under their eyes.(878) Of\r\nland owners, those who are in debt gain, that is especially the poorer,\r\nand the more speculative among them.(879) On the other hand, owners of\r\nlarge estates who have alienated their tithe-rights, or right to\r\nvassal-service etc. for capital, or for fixed sums to be paid at regular\r\nintervals, that is, in a great many places the great mass of the nobility,\r\nundergo a not insignificant social fall.\r\n\r\nThe condition of those who earned a living by manual labor no doubt\r\ndeteriorated in the sixteenth century, as may be inferred from the\r\nextraordinary activity of public charity in that period.\r\n\r\nBetween 1500 and 1550, silver purchased, in Orleans, from 4.1 to 4.5 times\r\nas much common labor as it does now, while silver, as compared with the\r\naverage price of twenty-seven commodities, has grown cheaper in the ratio\r\nof only from 2.6 to 2.7:1. (_Mantellier._) It was impossible for this\r\nclass to raise the price of their wares as rapidly as that of the medium\r\nof circulation declined, because they could not wait, nor hold back their\r\ncommodity even for a moment. (§ 164.)(880) This would, indeed, be very\r\ndifferent in our day. Wages, because of the facilities, both physical and\r\nmoral, which have everywhere been placed in the way of emigration, were\r\nnecessarily one of these articles which rose soonest in price, as compared\r\nwith money.(881) Lastly, the state itself profits by the diminished\r\nthing-value, that is, real value of its public debt;(882) but it loses, at\r\nthe same time, on all taxes, duties etc., which are not estimated at a\r\ncertain percentage of the value of the articles taxed.(883) As a rule,\r\ntherefore, it would need to impose new taxes. Now, the parliamentary right\r\nto impose taxes, however extensive it may juridically be, is, ordinarily,\r\nof great importance in practice only when there is question of increasing\r\nthe existing burthen. Hence, this right, wherever it exists, is brought\r\ninto the utmost activity by a revolution in prices.(884)(885)\r\n\r\nHowever, the new additions of gold and silver to the already existing\r\nsupply may not immediately produce a corresponding depreciation of the\r\nvalue of the precious metals. If the first receivers of the additional\r\nsupply of money exchange it rapidly for other goods, it will probably\r\nbring them the former value in exchange of the metal. Not until it has\r\npassed into a third or fourth person’s hands is the depreciation apt to be\r\nperceptible. It is, therefore, in this case, a great advantage to be the\r\nfirst hand. The world-threatening power of Spain, in the seventeenth\r\ncentury, was very essentially promoted by the American gold and silver\r\nmines;(886) nor is it a matter of less significance to-day, that the great\r\nmineral wealth of the world belongs to Siberia, California and Australia;\r\nthat is, especially to Russia and to countries colonized by Great Britain.\r\nFurther, as to the classes into which a nation is divided, it was only the\r\ncrown, the Church and a comparatively small number of officials, soldiers\r\nand officers who controlled Spanish America;(887) and who can tell how the\r\nabsolute monarchy of Spain was strengthened by this fact? In the\r\nseventeenth century, on the other hand, it is principally manufacturers\r\nand merchants, and more especially yet, workmen, who reap the immediate\r\nadvantages of new discoveries of gold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section CXLI.\r\n\r\n\r\nEffect Of An Enhancement Of The Price Of The Precious Metals.\r\n\r\n\r\nA great enhancement of the precious metals would naturally and necessarily\r\nproduce a revolution in prices in a direction(888) opposite to the one\r\njust described, and one which would be much more injurious to a nation’s\r\neconomy. Such a revolution would weigh most heavily on the most sensitive,\r\nand the momentarily most productive classes of the people, inasmuch as the\r\nprice of the ready product as compared with advances made for the purposes\r\nof production would be a declining one; and it would benefit those classes\r\nwho live in leisure on the fruits of previous labor. There would, at the\r\nsame time, be a perceptible growth of consumption in certain departments,\r\nuseful, no doubt, in themselves, but apt to degenerate into excess, and\r\nwhich are, therefore, most easily cared for. (§ 212, seq.) To this extent,\r\nthe gold discoveries of the nineteenth century, without which an\r\nenhancement of the price of money would undoubtedly have taken place, have\r\nwarded off a great economic malady from the nations. Moreover, this\r\ninverted revolution in prices may be moderated by governmental measures,\r\nsuch as a diminution of taxes, emissions of paper money etc.(889)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Section CXLII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Price Of Gold As Compared With That Of Silver.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe price of gold as compared with that of silver does not, by any means,\r\ndepend entirely on the ratio of the quantities of the two to each other.\r\nRather is it, in the long run, determined by the average cost of\r\nproduction necessary at those gold and silver mines which exist under the\r\nmost disadvantageous conditions, but which it is still necessary to work\r\nin order to satisfy the aggregate requirement of these metals. On the\r\nwhole, with an advance of economic civilization, the dearness of gold as\r\ncompared with that of silver has been enhanced. The former, in the middle\r\nages, was worth from ten to twelve times as much as the latter,(890) while\r\nnow it is worth from fifteen to almost sixteen times as much.(891) In the\r\nsame period of time, also, gold in highly civilized countries is wont to\r\nbe comparatively dearer.(892)\r\n\r\nThese facts are explained as well by the demand as by the supply. As the\r\nproduction of gold requires so little skill or capital, and that of silver\r\nso much of both, the former may be considered a natural product to a\r\ngreater extent than the latter, and therefore, the rule laid down in § 130\r\nis applicable to it. (_Senior._) Besides, in the higher stages of\r\ncivilization, especially when the precious metals are cheap, larger\r\npayments are usual, to the making of which, gold is certainly best\r\nadapted; just as in every day trade merchants are wont to accept a gold\r\npiece in payment, even at something of a premium, while the peasantry\r\nhesitate to do so.(893)\r\n\r\nIt is very much of a question whether gold or silver is, on the whole,\r\nsubject to greater variations in price. The fact that gold is more\r\nstrictly a natural product would of itself constitute a powerful element\r\nof variation. (§ 112). But, on the other hand, its greater durability and\r\nthe greater care bestowed on its preservation, have for effect to make the\r\nexisting quantity preponderate in importance over its annual increase. The\r\ndemand for gold varies more suddenly than the demand for silver. In case\r\nof war or sedition, the former is more easily carried away or hidden. It\r\nis also more desirable for the state for its military fund. On the other\r\nhand, on account of its greater capacity for transportation, it may follow\r\nsuch claims when made on it, more easily, from country to country. On the\r\nwhole, I am inclined to think that, for short periods of time, silver\r\nmaintains its value better, and gold for longer ones.(894)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Section CXLIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Price Of Gold As Compared With That Of Silver. (Continued.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the gold-production of California should be attended(895) by a notable\r\ndepression of the value of that metal, it becomes a question whether or\r\nnot silver would be necessarily depreciated with it. Senior claims that it\r\nwould not, for the reason that the two precious metals do not, for most\r\npurposes, act as substitutes each of the other. If a country needed 1,000\r\npounds of gold and 15,000 pounds of silver as money,(896) and these two\r\nsums of metal were equal in value, an increase of gold by one-half, which\r\nwould depreciate its price in relation to silver to 10:1, would not\r\noverflow the channels of circulation. The 1,500 pounds of gold are now\r\nalso equal to only 15,000 pounds of silver, and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nI would put very important limitations to this assertion. Even a moderate\r\ndepreciation of gold would drive out the silver from all those countries\r\nwhich had a mixed coinage made up of the two metals; and hence the supply\r\nof silver would be increased in the other countries. And so it is quite\r\npossible, up to a certain point, that the larger silver coin should be\r\nreplaced by small gold ones, ten and five franc pieces etc. Rau is\r\ncertainly right in his surmise that a general rise in the price of\r\ncommodities as compared with coin, the result of a great increase of gold,\r\nwould go farthest in countries in which the gold is the medium of\r\ncirculation, begin later in those which had a mixed circulation, and\r\ncontinue for the the shortest time in those countries which, by force of\r\nlaw, had a silver circulation only.(897)(898)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Appendix I.\r\n\r\n\r\nPaper Money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Section I.\r\n\r\n\r\nPaper Money And Money-Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nPaper money must be distinguished from other value-paper or\r\nmoney-paper,(899) which may also run to the possessor or holder, and not\r\nunfrequently serve as a medium of payment. In the case of these bonds or\r\nobligations,(900) their circulating capacity is a secondary matter, and\r\nthe principal thing the authentication of an economic legal relation;\r\nwhereas paper money is intended principally, if not exclusively, to act as\r\nmoney.(901) Money-paper appears in a great many different forms, but it\r\nnearly always bears interest. Its value depends in great part on the rate\r\nand certainty of its interest. On the other hand, the endeavor to insure a\r\nmore favorable reception for paper money by the promise of interest has\r\nbeen exceedingly seldom successful.(902) And in reality, good prospects as\r\nto interest (_Zinsaussichten_) and ease of transfer from one hand to\r\nanother are two qualities which lie in very different directions.(903)\r\n\r\nThe many recent writers who claim for paper money the marks of\r\nirredeemableness and forced circulation, confound the unfortunately too\r\nfrequent degeneration of an institution with its real nature. They\r\ncontradict, too, usage of speech, which, in countries where silver is the\r\nstandard, unhesitatingly calls gold coins money, although they cannot be\r\nforced on any one.(904) The paper money issued by the state deserves,\r\nindeed, the appellation in the fullest measure; but starting from this\r\npoint we find a number of grades in a downward direction, which may still\r\nbe called money;(905) and we shall see especially that the differences\r\nbetween state paper money and bank notes so widely asserted are, in great\r\nmeasure, differences not of kind but of degree.\r\n\r\nThe idea of replacing the precious metals as a medium of circulation by a\r\nless costly material, even the ancients were acquainted with; but with the\r\nexception of the Carthaginians, they scarcely ever made any use of it\r\nexcept in cases of need and transitorily.(906)\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the middle ages in Europe; as in general all greater\r\ndevelopment of the credit-system—and all paper money is credit-money—has a\r\nnatural growth only in the higher stages of civilization.(907)(908)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section II.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvantages And Disadvantages Of Paper Money.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere it is at all possible to give paper money the same purchasing power\r\nas metallic money possesses, it is unquestionable that the former must\r\nhave many advantages over the latter. True, paper money is very\r\ninconvenient for small amounts;(909) but all the more convenient for large\r\namounts, as well for purposes of counting as for purposes of the storing\r\nup of values and for transmission from place to place; a matter of greater\r\nimportance in proportion to the badness of a country’s means of\r\ntransportation, and to the cheapness of the metal of its currency\r\nhitherto.(910) It seems a still more important matter to most people that\r\npaper money dispenses with the use of a great quantity of the precious\r\nmetals for purposes of circulation, which can now either be turned into\r\nutensils, etc. in the country itself or used in foreign countries to make\r\ninvestments of capital there, or in the purchase of commodities.(911) In\r\nnational economies whose commerce is a growing one, the same advantage\r\nfinds a negative expression in this, that they are not compelled to\r\nsatisfy the increasing demand for money by procuring costly metals.(912)\r\nOf the individual members of the nation, all these advantages of\r\nconvenience will be experienced by those who employ the paper money. The\r\neconomical or saving advantages of paper money are appropriated by the\r\nissuers to themselves, in the form of a non-interest bearing loan, which\r\nthey make to those owners of money or to those who are entitled to a\r\nmoney-claim and to whom the paper money is acceptable instead of cash\r\nmoney.(913) A diminution for instance of the number of bank notes or of\r\nstate paper money does not diminish the available capital of the people.\r\nIts only effect is that a smaller portion of it is at the disposal of the\r\nbank or of the government.\r\n\r\nBut in contrast with these advantages are the great disadvantages, since\r\npaper money is wanting in most of those properties which originally made\r\nthe precious metals the best instruments of exchange and the best measures\r\nof value. In addition to this, paper money may be increased at pleasure,\r\nand at almost no cost; and an occasional surplus of it cannot flow either\r\ninto other branches of employment (as a surplus of metallic money may into\r\nutensils, ornamentation, etc.) nor into other countries. And thus the\r\nconstancy of value of paper money, that is, one of the chief requisites of\r\nall good money, is imperiled in the highest degree. True, the\r\npayment-power, or “legal tender” character given such money by the state\r\nmay certainly supplement in some way its matter and form-value. But this\r\nsupplement or addition constitutes, in the case of large amounts(914) a\r\nsmall quota; or else the quantity of money as compared with the amount of\r\nmoney needed for commerce would have to be fixed very accurately; a thing\r\nof peculiar difficulty in the case of paper money, which is almost\r\ncostless.(915)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section III.\r\n\r\n\r\nKinds Of Redemption.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile precious metal money carries, so to speak, by far the greater\r\nportion of its value in itself, and this to such an extent that it appears\r\non the inscription found on its face, the inscription found on paper money\r\nis almost the only reason of its value.(916) (Credit-value.) The issuer\r\npromises in one form or another, expressly or tacitly, that he intends to\r\nredeem the note, almost valueless in itself, in real goods; and the value\r\nof this promise depends on the probability of its fulfillment.(917) The\r\nonly fully satisfactory kind of redemption consists in this, that every\r\nholder of the paper money may, immediately on demand, obtain its nominal\r\nvalue in good current metallic money. This only can, in the long run, keep\r\npaper money up to its full nominal value. But experience teaches that even\r\nwith less perfect modes of redemption, paper money may maintain a part of\r\nits nominal value, and a part greater in proportion as the following\r\nconditions are approximated to: freedom from personal considerations, the\r\nimmediateness of the redemption, and currency of the goods by means of\r\nwhich redemption is effected. Thus, for instance, the acceptance of paper\r\nmoney for all debts due the state, in countries where taxation is heavy,\r\nwhere there are large state industries etc.; where the lands of the state\r\nare farmed out etc., has a great influence on its course of exchange.\r\nRedemption in parcels of land is a very imperfect one, not only on account\r\nof the great differences in the value of pieces of land according to\r\nquality, situation, the times etc., but also because only a very small\r\nnumber of men, especially where money is the usual medium of exchange, are\r\nin a condition to accept parcels of land.(918) It is a question whether\r\nthe threat of punishing the refusal to accept paper money, or to accept it\r\nat its full nominal value, can be called a negative mode of redemption.\r\nCertain it is, however, that it is the most barbarous and in the long run\r\nthe least efficient mode, one in which the issuer calculates only on the\r\nfear of those who accept it; and, what is most demoralizing, on the hope\r\nthey entertain that they in turn shall be able to dispose of it to others\r\nas timid.(919)(920)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompulsory Circulation.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen paper money which is not completely redeemable—and it is scarcely\r\npossible that in the long run it should be thus redeemable—has sunk below\r\nits nominal value, the result in the case of all private paper money is\r\nthe bankruptcy (_Vermögensbruch_) of the individual issuing it; in the\r\ncase of state paper money, the legal provision that it shall have a\r\ncompulsory circulation (_Zwangcourse_; _cours forcé_).(921) To what extent\r\nthe real rate of exchange of paper money shall fall in any case depends\r\nnot only on the amount issued as compared with the wants of trade, but\r\nalso and still more on the degree of confidence which the state of public\r\naffairs inspires.(922) The first consequence attending a depreciated\r\ncurrency is, that the good precious metal money is withdrawn from\r\ncirculation and even from the country; for the reason that it cannot\r\nmaintain its true value side by side with the paper money; the usual\r\neffect in all untenable mixed standards or currencies.(923) A second, and\r\nworse consequence is the unrightful revolution produced in so many income\r\nand property relations, based on old contracts, to the advantage of the\r\ndebtor, to the disadvantage of the creditor, and of those who receive\r\nnominally fixed salaries.(924) These consequences are in kind similar to\r\nthose produced by the clipping of the coin; but in degree they are much\r\nmore dangerous.(925) Besides, the depreciation of paper produces, by no\r\nmeans, an equal rise in the prices of all commodities. The prices of those\r\ncommodities, the sellers of which are most favorably situated in the\r\nstruggle for prices, rise earliest and highest. This is true especially of\r\nforeign commodities, also of those inland commodities which can be easily\r\nexported, and most particularly of those commodities which have the\r\ngreatest capacity for circulation, for instance, gold and silver.(926)\r\nHence, it would be a great mistake in countries where there is an\r\nirredeemable paper currency with compulsory circulation, to measure its\r\npurchasing power at a special discount as compared with the precious\r\nmetals. Therefore, a depreciated paper currency has transitorily an effect\r\non industry similar to that of a protective tariff, and even as the\r\npayment of export premiums; inasmuch as it enables manufacturers to permit\r\na part of their cost of production, viz.: that which they have to pay\r\ntheir workmen, their older creditors, and in part, also, their furnishers\r\nof raw material, to rise in a less degree than the paper money has\r\ndeclined in value.(927) This is indeed a very inequitable advantage\r\naccorded to private individuals in the face of the universal distress of\r\nthe country.(928)(929) And these bad consequences are aggravated by the\r\ndownward-path principle which a depreciated paper money always involves.\r\nThe state whose financial distress introduced the evil, sees a great\r\nportion of its revenues melt away before its eyes;(930) while in what\r\nconcerns its outlay, nothing is more calculated to mislead it than such an\r\nimagined creation out of nothing. And a thing which greatly contributes to\r\nthis its the frightful sensitiveness of a depreciated paper currency in\r\nthe presence of complications of foreign politics, a quality which may\r\ncause the government as many inconveniences from without as the issue of\r\nits paper money produced conveniences to it at home.(931) Hence recourse\r\nis had to additional issues of paper, which are easily increased in the\r\nsame measure as the rate of exchange (_Cours_) has declined.(932) Great\r\nprivate interests operate in the same direction. Between the increase of\r\nthe volume of the paper currency in circulation and its consequent\r\ndepreciation, some time always elapses; and in the mean time, either the\r\npurchasing power of the money-owner or his loaning capital is really\r\ngreater than before. The former increases the demand for commodities, the\r\nlatter facilitates their coming into existence. However, the flight of\r\nspeculation with which the increase of paper money is wont to be\r\naccompanied(933) in the beginning depends on an error shared by many men\r\nas to its true value. Hence it does not last long, and the critical\r\nshriveling up of the inflated bubbles is greater in proportion to what the\r\nprevious dimensions of these bubbles were. And now many believe that the\r\nnation’s business or economy might be kept on its course by new emissions\r\nof paper money; and the wise ones hope, at least, to be able thereby to\r\npostpone the catastrophe long enough to enable themselves to get their\r\nproperty into a safe condition. And in fact, the restoration of a\r\ndepreciated currency is accompanied by crises entirely similar to those\r\nwhich followed its first decline; only they are in an opposite\r\ndirection.(934) And hence conscientious statesmen are frequently deterred\r\nfrom seeking to effect such a restoration. Yet the darkest side of a paper\r\ncurrency severed of due connection with precious metal-money consists in\r\nthe frequent and violent fluctuations of value to which it is\r\nsubject.(935) The consequence of these fluctuations is, that every\r\ncommercial transaction, every credit-transaction, and even every act of\r\nsaving, in which money plays any part, is made to bear the impress of a\r\ngame of chance;(936) a consequence of far and deep reaching influence,\r\nespecially in the higher stages of civilization, where the importance of\r\ncommerce, of the credit-system, and of money-economy as\r\ncontradistinguished from barter-economy is so great; producing there a\r\nstate of uncertainty which is otherwise peculiar only to barbarous\r\nmedieval times.(937) All this discourages the best business men and the\r\nbest husbandmen more than it does any other class of people, and\r\ndemoralizes the whole economy of a nation; and demoralizes it the more in\r\nproportion as it is easier for the state to influence the value of paper\r\nmoney as compared with specie, and as its influence is more\r\nirresistible.(938) The compulsory circulation of paper money is a much\r\nmore powerful and yet a much more simple screw by means of which to\r\npractice extortion than is the most burdensome taxation or forced loan,\r\nand at the same time the most comprehensive power which a government can\r\npossess to carry out both these measures. (_Ad. Wagner._)\r\n\r\nAll the horrors of the later Roman republic, the draining of the provinces\r\nby robber-governors with their publicans and sinners, the building up of\r\nmonstrous fortunes without any production proper, but through usury and\r\nrapine alone: all this is made to revive again through the instrumentality\r\nof the national-economic disease called a paper crisis, in a less violent\r\nform, indeed, but in one which is much more insidious and scarcely less\r\npernicious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Section V.\r\n\r\n\r\nResumption Of Specie Payments.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe healing of such a paper-money disease as we have described, it has\r\nbeen endeavored to effect in three ways more particularly.\r\n\r\nA. By the reduction or bringing back of the depreciated paper money to its\r\nfull nominal value. And this is best done by gradually drawing paper money\r\ninto the state treasury by means of taxation or by loans, and refusing to\r\nallow such paper money to be again issued. The consequent rise in the rate\r\nat which the outstanding paper money notes exchange against specie is\r\nproduced not only by the diminution of the quantity of paper in\r\ncirculation, but also by the increasing confidence in the future which\r\nsuch a governmental measure inspires.(939) While this mode of procedure\r\nhas in the abstract most in its favor, yet it is not to be recommended in\r\npractice except where the depreciation of paper money has either not gone\r\nvery far or where it has existed only a short time.(940) Otherwise the\r\nrevolution in all property-relations and the disturbance of all rightful\r\nspeculation—always dangerous and easily abused—produced by the\r\ndepreciation would be repeated by the restoration of values, with this\r\ndifference only that the disturbance would be produced the second time in\r\nan opposite direction. And that those who were previously injured should\r\nnow be compensated for the damage sustained in the first instance is\r\nimpossible in proportion as the depreciation has been of longer duration.\r\nMany of the sufferers from the effects of depreciation are now compelled,\r\neven as tax-payers, to contribute to the enrichment of the speculators who\r\nhave accumulated the depreciated paper into their own hands.\r\n\r\nB. The extreme opposite of such a course would consist in this, that the\r\ndepreciated paper should be allowed to go on sinking lower and lower until\r\nit was practically worthless, whereupon a new currency, whether of metal\r\nor paper, would have to appear like a new world after the waters of a\r\ndeluge had been abated. Hence, therefore, one of two things: universal\r\nbankruptcy entered into with the clearest purpose, or the resignation of\r\ndespair!(941)\r\n\r\nC. The middle course between these two has, therefore, been most\r\nfrequently pursued, viz.: _the legal reduction_ of the value of the coin\r\n(_gesetzliche Devalvirung_), which consists in reducing the nominal value\r\nof paper money to its current value at the moment the law goes into force,\r\nand by redeeming it either in specie or in other paper to be issued in\r\nsmaller quantities.(942) Although this has been not seldom based on the\r\nfalse principle that the value of every separate amount of money is\r\ninversely as the aggregate amount of all the money in circulation; yet it\r\ncannot be questioned that it is only the open declaration of the state\r\nbankruptcy which the whole measure involves, and which in most instances\r\nhas already happened beyond repair. Here there is no new and dangerous\r\ndisturbance of the nation’s economy whatever; and the fluctuations of\r\nvalue in the future which are inseparable from the gradual contraction of\r\nthe volume of paper, continued until it has reached its nominal value, are\r\navoided: this last, of course, only on the supposition that either the\r\npure metallic or the redeemable paper currency is rigidly adhered to.(943)\r\nBut the problem, how to protect both parties(944) to contracts entered\r\ninto at a rate of the currency different from that under which they are to\r\nbe performed, from all damage, is one which will never be perfectly\r\nsolved. Hence, of the different measures to economically preserve a state\r\nin cases of extraordinary need, the emission of paper money with\r\ncompulsory circulation is much more universally disastrous to the people\r\nthan the effecting of loans at the very highest rate of interest, and even\r\nthan being in arrears in the matter of paying the officials and creditors\r\nof the state.(945)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Section VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nPaper Money—A Curse Or A Blessing?\r\n\r\n\r\nConsidering the double-edged-sword character of this mighty\r\ninstrument,(946) and the frightful consequences which its abuse produces,\r\nit is easy to conceive why so many political economists have expressed\r\nsuch serious doubts as to whether, on the whole, the invention of paper\r\nmoney has been more of a curse or of a blessing to mankind. The\r\ncontroversy is an idle one to a certain extent, since no mature nation (or\r\nindividual), and no nation which considers itself mature will renounce the\r\npossibility of a brilliant growth simply because it fears that it may not\r\nbe able to withstand the temptations to dangerous abuse connected\r\ntherewith. Politically, the best safeguard against such temptation is a\r\nso-called moderate constitution, which compels the supreme power in the\r\nstate by wise and appropriate counterweights, to allow all rightful\r\ninterests to assert themselves, or at least to find expression; and itself\r\nto make use not only of the most skillful but also of the most highly\r\nesteemed instruments and measures. Such a constitution, indeed, cannot be\r\nmade; it must be the ripe fruit of a long continued and well conducted\r\nnational life.(947) Of the extremes of forms of government, unlimited\r\nmonarchy and democracy are about equally exposed to the paper-money\r\ndisease.(948) Aristocracies are less exposed to it, for the reason that\r\nfrom their very nature they eschew centralization; and the paper-money\r\nsystem is intimately connected with the latter. Nothing so strengthens the\r\ncentral authority as the paper-prerogative with an unlimited power over\r\nthe prices of all commodities; and, on the other hand, whenever paper\r\nmoney is to have a wide field for action, there is supposed(949) a\r\nfar-reaching and intimate interwearing of the different members of the\r\nnation’s economy with one another. And in what concerns the various\r\neconomic stages, paper money is far removed from all medieval times; and\r\nfor the same reasons that make external commerce here preponderant and\r\ncondense all commerce into caravans, staple-towns, fairs, and recommend\r\nthe collection of treasure etc.(950) Later, on the other hand, we find two\r\nstages especially adapted to paper money. We have first, as yet\r\nundeveloped but intellectually active (and therefore desirous of progress)\r\ncolonial countries, possessed in abundance of natural means of production\r\nwithout however being able to concentrate them into the hands of an\r\nundertaker (_Unternehmer_) for want of money.(951) Here both the saving of\r\nthe precious metals and the facilitation of transportation effected by\r\nmeans of paper money are of greatest utility. And then we have very highly\r\ndeveloped and rich countries; not only because their economic popular\r\neducation may protect them against the dangers of paper money, but because\r\nthe rich man has relatively least need of money and may dispense with\r\nstores of specie most readily, because of his influence over the supply of\r\nothers.(952)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n    1 The author’s preface to the twelfth edition is confined to pointing\r\n      out the improvements etc., made in the eleventh.

And if there be new laws to construe, how could his evil\r\n      genius deter him from the necessary knowledge of ancient laws? Is\r\n      there a single jurisconsult, who, in the hope of a better future,\r\n      despises the meaning and spirit of that which still exists? I do not\r\n      know even one.... And when I am accused of passing by the\r\n      institutions of the past with coldness and hatred in my heart,\r\n      because I was one of the first to express the hope of a better\r\n      future, a charge is laid at my door which is perfectly\r\n      incomprehensible ... I am reproached with despising the history of\r\n      law. It is a slander on me. Although I have only laughed at these\r\n      reports, one man’s mistake grieved me; for that man’s name was\r\n      Niebuhr.... When he [Niebuhr] returned from Italy to devote himself\r\n      entirely to science, in his retreat at Bonn, he passed through\r\n      Heidelberg, where he remained five or six days. During a great part\r\n      of that time we came frequently together. He was at first a little\r\n      cold; but Cicero made us friends. After a happy word let drop\r\n      concerning that writer, he asked me what I thought of him. I\r\n      answered laconically: ‘If they were burning all the Latin authors,\r\n      and I were permitted to grant a pardon to one of them, I should say,\r\n      without hesitation: Spare the works of Cicero.’ He joyfully\r\n      exclaimed: ‘I have at last found a man who judges rightly of Cicero.\r\n      I share your admiration for him, and that is the reason I have given\r\n      my boy the name of Marcus.’ The ice was now broken, and he frankly\r\n      told me that he could not understand how I could be an inveterate\r\n      enemy of Roman law and of the history of law. I gave him to\r\n      understand that I had simply been slandered, and I added, that, in\r\n      order to live entirely with the classics, I had always refused to\r\n      give legal advice, or act as a counsellor, although I might have\r\n      made a fortune in that way. I told him that I owed my gayety and\r\n      vigor, in great part, to my love for the classics of all ages, even\r\n      those outside the domain of jurisprudence; but that I held, above\r\n      all things, to the good qualities of the German nation, and that I\r\n      did not hesitate to say with Facciolatus: ‘Expedit omnes gentes\r\n      Romanis legibus operam dare, suis vivere.’\r\n\r\n      “When he heard those words of mine, he exclaimed with his usual\r\n      energy and vivacity: ‘Habes me consentientem, labes me\r\n      consentientem.’ From that moment all coldness between us was at an\r\n      end, and we approached, without any embarrassment, a host of\r\n      questions in one conversation in which I endeavored, as I had\r\n      before, to learn from him.\r\n\r\n      “Thus I receive with sincere gratitude, all the works, both useful\r\n      and profound, which have appeared in our day on the history of law.\r\n      It would be folly in me to deny the impetus which the study of\r\n      positive law has received. New sources have been discovered. Their\r\n      newness and importance have excited the zeal of many scholars who\r\n      have studied them profoundly; a fact which made a review of the\r\n      older sources, still by far the most important, necessary. These two\r\n      circumstances soon rendered it imperative to proceed to the making\r\n      of scrupulous dogmatic researches. Thus there now is a new life\r\n      among jurisconsults, and a great activity, which, it is my hope, may\r\n      continue long.”\r\n\r\n   19 Revue de Législ. et de Jurisprudence, 1834-35.\r\n\r\n_   20 Rossi._\r\n\r\n_   21 M. de Bonald._\r\n\r\n_   22 M.

This\r\n      school is continually gaining in extent, and has found, both in\r\n      Germany and in France, the most distinguished disciples—men who\r\n      honor Roscher as their teacher and master, the leader whose beacon\r\n      light they follow.

These are conceded to him on every hand; and it does not\r\n      detract from him, or alter the fact that he possesses them, that,\r\n      here and there, an ill-humored or maliciously snappish critic calls\r\n      them in question.” It should be borne in mind here that Wolowski\r\n      wrote in 1857; Contzen, like Wolowski, a politico-economical writer\r\n      of mark, in 1876.—_Translator’s note._\r\n\r\n   28 Leben, Werk und Zeitalter des Thukydides.\r\n\r\n_   29 Rau’s_ Archiv., Heidelberg.

There\r\n      being no exact equivalent in English for the word _Bedarf_ in this\r\n      connection, this note is appended.—_Translator._\r\n\r\n   52 According to _Boisguillebert_ (ob. 1714) Traité des Grains, I., c.\r\n      4, the wants _nécessaire_, _commode_, _délicat_, _superflu_,\r\n      _magnifique_, arise in successive order with increasing welfare or\r\n      prosperity, and are surrendered in a reverse order, with increasing\r\n      need. _Tucker_ distinguishes necessaries, comforts, and conveniences\r\n      of the respective conditions, elegancies and refinements, and\r\n      lastly, “grand and magnificent.” (Two Sermons, 1774, 29 ff.); _F. B.\r\n      W. Hermann_, loc. cit, 1st, ed., 1832, 68; necessary goods (Güter\r\n      der Nothdurft), goods that contribute to pleasure and recuperation,\r\n      to culture and splendor.\r\n\r\n   53 Compare _Tucker_, On the Naturalization Bill (1751 seq.), IV, note.\r\n\r\n   54 No people without fire (Prometheus!); and it seems that broiling was\r\n      the earliest mode of preparing food; then followed baking in heated\r\n      cavities, and lastly came boiling in vessels. (_Klemm_, Allgemeine\r\n      Kulturgeschichte, I, 180, 343.)\r\n\r\n   55 There is an interesting attempt by _Faucher_, in the\r\n      Vierteljahrsschrift für Volkswirthschaft und Kulturgeschichte, 1868,\r\n      III, 148 ff., to determine the relative place of our various wants\r\n      according to their capacity for extension or contraction.\r\n\r\n   56 The qualification “true,” excludes from the circle of goods, not\r\n      only all those things which might satisfy only irrational or immoral\r\n      wants (compare _Mischler_, Grundsätze der Nationalökonomie, 1856, I,\r\n      187), but also vindicates the fundamental idea of the whole system\r\n      of Political Economy, as a subject of moral as well as of\r\n      psychological investigation.\r\n\r\n   57 Even _Aristotle_ (Eth. nicom. V, 8), considers that all things\r\n      intended to enter into commerce, should be susceptible of comparison\r\n      with one another, and that the measure of this comparison is _want_,\r\n      which is the foundation of all association among men.\r\n\r\n   58 An Arab helped pillage a caravan, and carried away, as his share of\r\n      the booty, a chest of pearls. He thought it a box of rice, and gave\r\n      them to his wife to cook, but finding they did not boil tender, he\r\n      threw them away. (_Niebuhr_, Beschreibung von Arabien, 383). See a\r\n      similar anecdote in _Ammian. Marcell._, _XXII_. Compare _Strabo_,\r\n      _VIII_, 381.\r\n\r\n   59 As soon as the Persians renounce the superstition that the daily\r\n      contemplation of a turquoise is a talisman against the \"evil eye\"\r\n      (_K. Ritter_, Erdkunde, VIII, 327), that precious stone will lose\r\n      much of its value. On the other hand, the amulets of antiquity,\r\n      although they have long lost the quality of goods as objects of\r\n      superstition, have now a real value for the archæologist.\r\n\r\n   60 Since observation shows, that, as time runs on, matter tends more\r\n      and more to become _goods_, the blind forms of motion in nature to\r\n      become useful labor and useful sustenance, impersonal and objectless\r\n      existence to be transformed into personal property and personal\r\n      culture, _Schäffle_ inclines to the belief that the whole mechanism\r\n      of unconsciously governing nature is destined ultimately to aid in\r\n      the realization of moral good, which alone is really valuable. Das\r\n      gesellschaftliche System der menschlichen Wirthschaft, III, Auff.,\r\n      1873, I, 3.\r\n\r\n_   61 Hermann_, loc. cit, 1st ed., I, calls internal goods whatever each\r\n      of us finds in himself, the free gift of nature; also that which we\r\n      develop in ourselves by our own free action; and external, whatever\r\n      we create or obtain, through the external world, as a means of\r\n      satisfying our wants. The internal goods of one man may be external\r\n      goods to another, as, for instance, when the former conveys them\r\n      directly to the latter to be enjoyed, by words, demeanor, etc., or\r\n      indirectly, in combination with other external goods.\r\n\r\n   62 The exclusion of all else, has, indeed, been called one-sidedness\r\n      and materialism. But, as _Senior_ says, no one blames the writer on\r\n      tactics, because he confines his attention to military subjects; nor\r\n      is the objection raised, that by so doing, he is encouraging eternal\r\n      war. On the other hand, _J. B. Storch_ (1815) devoted a special\r\n      division of his work to the consideration of “internal goods”\r\n      (health, knowledge, morality, security, leisure,.etc.). See _Rau’s_\r\n      translation of his Manual, II, 337 ff. Compare _Gioja_, Nuovo\r\n      Prospetto delle Scienze economiche, 1815 ff. VIII.\r\n\r\n   63 The inclination to exchange is, according to _Adam Smith_, one of\r\n      the most important marks which distinguish man from the brute.\r\n      (Wealth of Nations, I, ch. 2). But see _Büsch_, Geldumlanf (1780),\r\n      I, § 29, on exchange among the lower animals.\r\n\r\n   64 Observed by _Aristot._ Polit. I, ch. 6.\r\n\r\n   65 The efforts of political economists to select from among the\r\n      infinite number of goods, those which should constitute the subject\r\n      of their investigations, have taken two directions in recent times.\r\n      _Bastiat_ here confines himself too exclusively to commerce. The\r\n      political economist should concern himself only with wants and\r\n      satisfactions, where the labor, which is the connecting link between\r\n      them, is undertaken by some other person for a consideration. Thus\r\n      the ordinary act of respiration lies outside the circle, that of the\r\n      diver, which is paid for, does not. (Harmonies économiques, 1850, 68\r\n      ff.) But even Robinson Crusoe had his own system of economy. Are the\r\n      products which the farmer consumes in his own home, the work he does\r\n      himself, any the less matters of economic moment than the products\r\n      he sells, or the labors of his servants? _Schäffle_ is right when he\r\n      says that ordinary respiration is no economic function, because it\r\n      is an unconscious necessity of nature. But his definition is too\r\n      broad, inasmuch as he places the essence of the economic character\r\n      of goods or of an act, in the conscious adaptation of means to human\r\n      ends. (Tübinger Progr. z. 27 Sept. 1862, 9, 24 seq.) To take a walk\r\n      is no economic operation, although it may be the best means to a\r\n      very important end,—health. The same goods or the same act may have,\r\n      frequently, according to the end proposed, an economic or\r\n      non-economic character. The beauty of the human body, for instance,\r\n      however systematically made use of for purposes of vanity, is not\r\n      economic _goods_. But it is an economic speculation, base though it\r\n      be, when a man relies on his handsome figure to secure a wealthy\r\n      wife, or, for purposes of gain, allows her to pose as a model to\r\n      artists or to take part in _tableaux vivants_. According to _C.\r\n      Menger_, Grundsätze der Volkswirthschaftslehre (1871) I, 51 ff.,\r\n      there are no economic goods, but those the disposable supply of\r\n      which is, at most, equal to the quantity that is required. But is\r\n      not the largest navigable stream, even in the most thinly populated\r\n      country, an economic good?\r\n\r\n_   66 Hegel_, Rechtsphilosophie, § 67. Even the use of a corpse as\r\n      manure, or for any mercantile purpose, is repugnant to our feelings,\r\n      “because of the dignity of personality.” (_Schäffle_, National\r\n      Œkonomie, 1860, 28.) In this respect, prostitution is a remnant of\r\n      slavery. _Schäffle_ is right, when he says that to repay personal\r\n      services with material commodities which do not afford as much food\r\n      etc., as the former have cost in expenditure of vital energy, is a\r\n      slow and frequently a very cruel kind of cannibalism. (Kapitalismus\r\n      und Socialismus, 1870, 18).\r\n\r\n_   67 Bornitz_, De rerum Sufficientia in Republica procuranda, 1625,\r\n      gives in this encyclopædia of political science, together with a\r\n      dissertation on agriculture, commerce and manufactures, a complete\r\n      survey of the _ministeria_. Several modern writers refuse to look\r\n      upon personal services, or the ability to render such services, as\r\n      elements of wealth: compare _Kaufmann_, Untersuchungen im Gebiete\r\n      der politischen Œkonomie, 1830, II, Heft I. They demonstrate,\r\n      however, no more than this, that that class of goods has something\r\n      very peculiar. Thus _Malthus_, Principles of Political Economy\r\n      (1820), chap. I, sect. I, objects that they cannot be inventoried or\r\n      taxed; but can material goods be so completely? Can all the parts of\r\n      the wealth of a nation be so inventoried and taxed? _Rau_, Lehrbuch\r\n      der pol. Œkonomie (1826) I, § 46, remarks that the personal aptitude\r\n      to perform services dies with the person, and that personal services\r\n      cannot be stored up (?), etc. I appeal simply to the definition I\r\n      have given above of economic goods, and which applies equally to\r\n      services of every kind which can be performed for other people.\r\n      Besides, those who oppose this view are unable to give a\r\n      satisfactory explanation of all the phenomena of commerce. Of\r\n      course, the qualification “recognized as useful” is of the utmost\r\n      importance as a mark to determine what is goods. But a prima donna,\r\n      or a world-renowned physician, cast naked by shipwreck on the shores\r\n      of North America, is certainly, better off than a blind beggar, his\r\n      fellow sufferer. Compare _Storch_, Handbuch II, 335 ff. and his\r\n      Considérations sur la Nature du Revenu National.\r\n\r\n_   68 Ad. Müller_ compares persons, so far as they render any kind of\r\n      service, to things, and, so far as they are required to be preserved\r\n      in their individuality, to persons. The children in the “status” of\r\n      a country gentleman, for instance, are treated more as persons, and\r\n      domestics, more like things; the land partakes of a species of\r\n      personality, but not the implements of labor. (Nothwendigkeit einer\r\n      theolog. Grundlage der Staatswissenschaft, 1819, 48.)\r\n\r\n   69 The privilege of selling refreshments in the garden of the Palais\r\n      Royal was formerly let for 38,000 francs a year.\r\n\r\n   70 See the cases cited by _Hermann_, Staatswirtsch. Untersuchungen, 6\r\n      ff. and by _Bernoulli_, Schweiz. Archiv. für Statistik und N. Œkon.\r\n      II, 55. Think of the firm of J. M. Farina! In Athens, good stands\r\n      were leased at a very high rent, even where there was no investment\r\n      of the lessee’s capital. (_Demosthenes_, pro. Phorm., 948; adv.\r\n      Steph. I, iiii.) There is, again, the sale of inventions, while they\r\n      are still “mere ideas.” According to _Schäffle_, Theorie der\r\n      ausschliessendnen Verhältnisse, 1857, II ff., the value in exchange\r\n      of these relations depends on the extra income which is assured in\r\n      fact, or in law, against diminution, by the exclusion of\r\n      competition. He, therefore, recommends, instead of the word\r\n      “relations,” “custom,” or “publicum.” But these words, by no means,\r\n      exhaust the meaning expressed by “relation.” Thus, the good\r\n      administration of public affairs, although it has no value in\r\n      exchange, is one of the most valuable economic goods which a people\r\n      can possess.\r\n\r\n   71 The relation mentioned above of a general to an army may even have\r\n      great value in exchange. Instance, the Italian condottieri in the\r\n      fifteenth century!\r\n\r\n   72 Relations which take from one man, as much as they afford to their\r\n      possessor, are of value as components of a man’s private fortune,\r\n      but not of the wealth of the nation. To this class belong debts due\r\n      from persons or from things, compulsory custom or good-will of every\r\n      description; as for instance, the seventy-two places of the _agents\r\n      de change_ in Paris, each of which was worth more than a million of\r\n      francs; or the right of navigating the Elbe as far as Magdeburg,\r\n      which, about the beginning of this century, was worth in every\r\n      instance about 10,000 thalers. (_Krug_, Abriss. der St. Œkonomie,\r\n      62.)\r\n\r\n_   73 Schäffle_, N. Œkonomie, 10. In the German language, this same word\r\n      is used to designate utility, and sometimes useful objects (so\r\n      called values). A clear distinction, however, should be made between\r\n      utility and value in use. Utility is a quality of things themselves,\r\n      in relation, it is true, to human wants. Value in use is a quality\r\n      imputed to them, the result of man’s thought, or of his view of\r\n      them. Thus, for instance, in a beleagured city, the stores of food\r\n      do not increase in utility, but their value in use does. Compare\r\n      _Schäffle_, System, III, I, 170.\r\n\r\n_   74 Genovesi_, Economia civile (1869), II, I, 7. _L. Say_, De la\r\n      Richesse individuelle et de la Richesse publique (1827), 29,\r\n      estimates the value of goods according to the degree of discomfort\r\n      attendant on the privation of them.\r\n\r\n_   75 Friedländer_ has, however, made a general attempt in this\r\n      direction. Theorie des Werthes (Dorpat, 1852). But says _Th. Fix_\r\n      (Journal des Economistes, 1844, IX, 12): “It is as impossible to\r\n      establish a scale of values, as it is to find an exact mathematical\r\n      and permanent measure of our wants, passions, desires, tastes and\r\n      fancies.”\r\n\r\n   76 Compare _Knies_, Geld und Credit, 1873, I, 126 ff. The very\r\n      respectable attempt made by _A. Samter_, Sociallehre (1875), with\r\n      the idea society-value (_Gesellschaftswerth_) covers too nearly the\r\n      idea of value in exchange. Further research will here have to be\r\n      made, with the idea of “impotent need,” inasmuch as, from a high\r\n      ethical, national-dietetical point of view, the question is asked\r\n      whether, to what extent, and how, “impotent need” may be made a\r\n      potent one.\r\n\r\n_   77 Friedländer_, loc. cit, 50. If too many copies of the very best\r\n      book be published, there is a certainty that a number of them will\r\n      remain little better than waste paper.\r\n\r\n_   78 Schäffle_, System, II, aufl., 55. See also his Kapitalismus und\r\n      Socialismus, 1870, 31, 35, 43.\r\n\r\n   79 Thus _Kleinwächter_ (Hildebrand’s Jahrbücher für N. Oek. und\r\n      Statistik, 1867, II, 318), defines value in exchange=value in use +\r\n      costliness. According to Schäffle, it is “a covert comparison\r\n      between the cost-value and the value in use of the two kinds of\r\n      goods to be exchanged.” (Kapitalismus und Socialismus, 35.)\r\n\r\n   80 An intermediate dealer can, so far as he is himself concerned,\r\n      attribute value in exchange to goods only to the extent that they\r\n      have use for the last person who has acquired them. Hence, _Storch_\r\n      calls _value in use_ immediate, and _value in exchange_, mediate\r\n      value. As the English are always wont to express the immediate in\r\n      words of Germanic origin, and the mediate in words borrowed from the\r\n      Latin, _Locke_ calls value in use “worth,” and value in exchange,\r\n      simply “value.” (_K. Marx_, Das Kapital. Kritik der politischen\r\n      Œkonomie, 1867, I, 2.)\r\n\r\n   81 It is, of course, otherwise when, for instance, a beautiful sea\r\n      view, or a desirable position as regards air and sunshine, is\r\n      connected with a piece of land.\r\n\r\n   82 In Ravenna a cistern had greater value in exchange than a vineyard:\r\n      _Martial_, III, 56. In Paris, too, drinking water, which is\r\n      transported only with considerable trouble, costs 1-1/3 thalers per\r\n      cubic meter. We may also mention snow and ice in summer, which last\r\n      sells in the capitals of southern Europe at 0.34, silber groschens\r\n      per pound. According to _Carey_, “utility” is the measure of man’s\r\n      power over nature, “value,” the measure of nature’s power over man.\r\n      He very inaccurately adds, that both are always in an opposite\r\n      direction. (Principles of Social Science, 1861, VI, ch. 9.)\r\n\r\n   83 Hence _Ad. Müller_ calls value in use, individual value, and value\r\n      in exchange, social value. The Germans call the value of goods whose\r\n      value in use is recognized by only one person, _Affectionswerth_,\r\n      (affection-value) a value which influences its value in exchange\r\n      only when the individual who holds it in high esteem is not himself\r\n      the possessor of the goods. An instance of this latter is a piece of\r\n      paper covered with notes, intelligible only to the maker of them.\r\n\r\n   84 The very important difference between value in use and value in\r\n      exchange was recognized oven by Aristotle. _Aristot._ Pol. I, 9.\r\n      _Hutchinson_, System of Moral Philosophy (1755), II, 53 ff. The\r\n      Physiocrates speak very frequently of _valeur usuelle_ and _vénale_,\r\n      on which, according to _Dupont_, Physiocratie, CXVIII, the\r\n      difference between _biens_ and _richesses_ is based. _La valeur d’un\r\n      septicr de blé, considéré comme richesse ne consiste que dans son\r\n      prix._ (_Quesnay_, éd. Daire, 300.) _Turgot_ distinguishes between\r\n      “_valeur estimative_” and “_échangeable_ or _appréciative_;” the\r\n      former designating the relation between the amount of energy,\r\n      physical and mental, which one is willing to spend in order to\r\n      obtain the goods, to the sum total of his energies, physical and\r\n      mental; the latter the relation between the aggregate like energy of\r\n      two persons which they are willing to spend in order to procure each\r\n      of the goods to be exchanged, and the sum total of their energies in\r\n      general. (Valeurs et Monnaies, p. 87, seq., éd. Daire.) _Ad. Smith_,\r\n      in his Wealth of Nations, I, ch. 4, shows that he knew the\r\n      difference between value in use and value in exchange; but he\r\n      afterwards drops the consideration of the former, altogether. In\r\n      this respect he has had only too faithful and one-sided followers\r\n      among his countrymen, so that _Ricardo_, Principles, ch. 28, asks\r\n      what value in exchange can have in common with the capacity of\r\n      commodities to serve as food or clothing. (See, however, ch. XIX\r\n      seq.) Many “free traders” would have no objection to interpose, if a\r\n      people should abandon the cultivation of wheat, etc., to devote\r\n      themselves exclusively to the manufacture of point lace, provided\r\n      the latter had a greater value in exchange. The two degrees of the\r\n      idea of value have been examined with much thoroughness by\r\n      _Hufeland_ in his Neue Grundlegung der Staatswirthschaftskunst\r\n      (1807), I, 118 ff.; _Lotz_, Revision der Grundbegriffe (1811 ff.),\r\n      I, 31, ff.; _Storch_, Handbuch, I; _Rau_, Lehrbuch, I, 56, ff.;\r\n      _Thomas_, Theorie des Verkehrs, I, p. 11; _Knies_, Tübing. Zeitschr.\r\n      1855; _Bastiat’s_ declaration (Harmonies, p. 171 ff.): that\r\n      “_valeur_” (by which Bastiat means only value in exchange), = _le\r\n      raport de deux services échangés_, contains a two-fold error: the\r\n      ambiguity of the word _services_, which applies equally to a\r\n      yielding or affording of utility, as to useful labor, and the error\r\n      that the labor necessary to produce a commodity, and of which the\r\n      purchaser is relieved, alone determines its value in exchange.\r\n      Compare _infra_ §§ 47, 107, 110, 115 ff., and _Knies_, loc. cit., p.\r\n      644 ff.\r\n\r\n_   85 Proudhon_, Système des Contradictions économiques, 1846, ch. 2.\r\n\r\n   86 In France, according to _Cordier_ (Mémoire sur l’Agriculture de la\r\n      Flandre Française), the wheat harvest yielded, in\r\n\r\n      1817, forty-eight million hectolitres, with a value in exchange of\r\n      two thousand and forty-six million francs; in\r\n\r\n      1818, fifty-three million hectolitres, with a value in exchange of\r\n      one thousand and four hundred and forty-two million francs; in\r\n\r\n      1819, sixty-four million hectolitres, with a value in exchange of\r\n      one thousand and one hundred and seventy million francs.\r\n\r\n      A rise in the value in exchange of wheat, such as was witnessed in\r\n      1817, is synonymous with a decline in the value in exchange of\r\n      money, and of all those goods whose money price has not risen. It is\r\n      no objection to the views here advocated, that when the necessaries\r\n      of life are very scarce, the want of clothing, furniture, articles\r\n      of luxury etc., is not felt so keenly as at other times, and that\r\n      the value in use of these commodities really falls; and _vice\r\n      versa_.\r\n\r\n   87 Compare _B. Hildebrand_, N. Œkonomie der Gegenwart und Zukunft,\r\n      1848, I, p. 316 ff. _Knies_, loc. cit.\r\n\r\n   88 The greater importance attached, in our days, to value in exchange,\r\n      than to value in use, is seen especially in the attitude which the\r\n      buyer, who is possessed of the more current commodity (money),\r\n      assumes toward the seller,—an attitude not unlike that of a patron\r\n      towards his client. In the interior of Africa, the possessor of\r\n      money, as such, would scarcely look down on the possessor of the\r\n      means of subsistence. The South American Indians are ready to render\r\n      an amount of service for a little brandy, which it would be in vain\r\n      to ask them to perform for ten times its value in gold. (Ausland,\r\n      Jan. 15, 1870.) The miser estimates the possibility of being able to\r\n      procure for himself, for one dollar, a hundred different articles\r\n      worth a dollar each, to be worth one hundred dollars.\r\n\r\n   89 When the wants of a person or of a people change, it is possible for\r\n      the value in use of one kind of goods, which had the greater\r\n      prominence before, to take the place occupied previously by its\r\n      value in exchange; and _vice versa_. Thus, the youth sells the\r\n      plaything he used in childhood; the man, the educational apparatus\r\n      of his earlier years; the old man, the implements that enabled him\r\n      to acquire wealth, and which he can no longer use except with great\r\n      effort. (_Menger_, Grundsätze, I, 220 ff.)\r\n\r\n_   90 Rau_ (Lehrbuch, I, § 61 ff.) distinguishes between the concrete or\r\n      quantitative value which a certain kind of goods may have for a\r\n      certain person, under certain circumstances, and the abstract or\r\n      species-value which a whole class of commodities may have for men in\r\n      general.\r\n\r\n      But _F. J. Neumann_, (Tübinger Zeitschrift, 1872, p. 288 ff.)\r\n      objects, that even the abstract value of a commodity always suggests\r\n      the relation of a definite number of concrete men to a definite\r\n      quantity of goods; else, by the expression, value of goods, is to be\r\n      understood not what it is generally meant to signify, but only the\r\n      capacity to satisfy a single want.\r\n\r\n_   91 Storch_, Ueber die Natur des Nationaleinkommens (1824, 1825), 5,\r\n      defines (_Vermögen_) thus: a source of income, permanent in its\r\n      nature, and capable of being transmitted, the possessor of which\r\n      does not need to work, on its account. Hence he does not approve of\r\n      the expression “the people’s resources” (_Volksvermögen_).\r\n\r\n   92 See especially _Lord Lauderdale_, Inquiry into the Nature and Origin\r\n      of Public Wealth, 1804, ch. 2. _Storch_, loc. cit.\r\n\r\n_   93 Moreau de Jonnès_, Le Commerce au 19. Siècle (1825) I, 114 ff.,\r\n      says that the United States imported from abroad 9.6, France 6, and\r\n      Great Britain 5.8 per cent. of their annual consumption; and\r\n      exported respectively 10.4, 6.2, 9.8 per cent. of their annual\r\n      production. The recent free trade tendencies, and the improvement in\r\n      the international means of transportation, have certainly increased\r\n      the relative importance of foreign commerce. In the kingdom of\r\n      Saxony (1853), _Engel_ estimates that 10/47 of the whole production\r\n      of the country was destined for foreign countries, and that 10/47 of\r\n      the consumption was imported.\r\n\r\n   94 When the land of a country becomes dearer, simply on account of the\r\n      increase of population, or goods, the quantity of which is\r\n      susceptible of increase, because the cost of production has been\r\n      increased, this cannot be considered an increase in the wealth of\r\n      the people, (_v. Mangoldt._)\r\n\r\n   95 Neither is value in exchange a quality inherent in goods, but only a\r\n      relation between them and other goods. Hence it is absurd to speak\r\n      of a rise or fall of all values in exchange. If the goods A lose in\r\n      capacity to be exchanged against goods B, goods B of course increase\r\n      in exchange power as compared with A, and _vice versa_. It is\r\n      necessary to guard against being misled here by the intervention of\r\n      money, that is, by the custom universal among men of employing a\r\n      definite kind of goods as a medium of exchange for all others. Yet\r\n      there are many writers who have been thus misled. Thus _Galiani_,\r\n      Delia Moneta (1750), II, p. 2, who regards the lasting increase of\r\n      the prices of all commodities as an infallible sign of national\r\n      prosperity. To the same effect is the motto of the Physiocrates:\r\n      _Abondance et cherté c’est opulence_. In its coarsest form, in\r\n      _Saint Chamans_, Nouv. Essai sur la Richesse des Nations (1824),\r\n      456, who would have that which is now the free gift of nature, to\r\n      come to us or be produced only as the reward of toil. _Verri_, on\r\n      the other hand, Meditazioni sull. econ. pol. (1771), ch. V, thinks\r\n      that the number of buyers in a country should be as small as\r\n      possible, and that of sellers as great as possible, in order that\r\n      thus prices might be low; (as if every buyer was not, _eo ipso_,\r\n      also a seller.)\r\n\r\n_   96 Kaufmann_, Untersuchungen, I, p. 165 seq. Also, _Verri_,\r\n      Meditazioni, XVII, 2.\r\n\r\n   97 The differences characteristic of poverty, indigence, managing to\r\n      live, fortune and wealth, cleverly treated by _von Justi_,\r\n      Staatswirthschaft, I, p. 449, seq. _Rau_, Lehrbuch I, § 76, seq.,\r\n      establishes the following gradation: privation and wretchedness,\r\n      poverty, indigence, “getting on,” comfort, wealth, superfluity. _L.\r\n      Say_ calls those who can satisfy the wants of luxury rich;\r\n      well-to-do, those who can command the comforts of life; and\r\n      wretched, those who cannot obtain a sufficiency of the objects of\r\n      prime necessity. In France, the limits of these situations are\r\n      marked by an income of respectively 60,000, 6,000 and 900 francs per\r\n      family, so that a family with an income of only 300 francs per year\r\n      is in a condition of wretchedness. (Traité de la Richesse, 1827, I\r\n      ff., 71 ff.)\r\n\r\n_   98 Palmieri_, Ricchezza nazionale, Introd. The greater number of the\r\n      definitions of wealth are rather onesided than false. _Socrates_,\r\n      for instance, looks only at the relation existing between means and\r\n      their owner’s wants. (_Xenoph._ Memor., IV, 2, 37, seq. Œconom. II,\r\n      2 ff.). _Plato_, on the other hand, as the socialists are wont to\r\n      do, looks to the excess over that possessed by others. (Legg. V,\r\n      742, seq.). _Xenophon’s_ observations, Hiero, 4, on the nature of\r\n      wealth, are many-sided and beautiful. _Aristotle_ distinguishes\r\n      between natural and artificial wealth: πλῆθος ὀργάνων οἰκονομακῶν\r\n      καὶ πολιτικῶν—πλῆθος νομίσματος. (Polit, I, 3, 9, 16.) Compare\r\n      _Cicero_, Parad. VI. The dominant idea of the so-called Mercantile\r\n      System is thus expressed in a Saxon pamphlet of 1530\r\n      (Müntzbelangende Antwort, etc.): “Money is the real watchword; where\r\n      there is much money, there is wealth, it is clear.” Compare\r\n      _Luther_, Werke, Irmisch edition, XXII, p. 200 seq. See some\r\n      excellent remarks in opposition hereto, in the Saxon pamphlet,\r\n      Gemeyne Stimmen von der Müntz, 1530. _Schröder_, Fürstliche\r\n      Schatz-und Rentkammer, 1686, ch XXIX. “A country grows rich in\r\n      proportion as it draws gold or money, either from the earth or from\r\n      other countries; poor, in proportion as money leaves it. The wealth\r\n      of a country must be estimated by the quantity of gold and silver in\r\n      it.” See a very passionate argument against this view in\r\n      _Boisguillebert_, Dissertation sur la Nature des Richesses, written\r\n      sometime between 1697 and 1714. _Berkeley_, Querist (1735), Nos.\r\n      562, 542. Among Englishmen, the correct view was prevalent much\r\n      earlier, especially among the founders of the American colonial\r\n      empire. See _Hachluyt_, Voyages (1600) III, 22 ff. 45 ff. 152 ff.\r\n      165 ff. 182 ff. 266 ff; but especially the work “Virginia’s Verger”\r\n      in “Purchas Pilgrims” (1625), IV, p. 809 ff. However, several\r\n      Spaniards were led by hard experience to adopt a view opposed to the\r\n      Midas-view (compare _Aristotle_, Polit. I, ch. 3, 16), by which the\r\n      first American explorers were carried away: _Garcilasso de la Vega_\r\n      (1609), Comment. reales II, ch. 6; _Saavedra Faxardo_, Idea\r\n      Principis christiani (1640) Symb. 69: _potissimæ divitiæ ac opes\r\n      terræ fructus sunt, nec ditiores in regnis fodinæ, quam agricultura;\r\n      plus emolumenti, acclivia montis Vesuvii latera adverunt, quam\r\n      Potosus mons_. Contemporary with those Englishmen, was the Italian,\r\n      _Giov. Botero_, who called attention to the fact, that France and\r\n      Italy were the countries of Europe richest in gold, although they\r\n      possessed no mines of the precious metal themselves: Della Ragion di\r\n      Stato (1591) p. 88 ff. Also _Sully_, who called agriculture and\r\n      cattle-breeding the breasts of the state, the real mines and pearls\r\n      of Peru. (Economies royales I, ch. 81. See however, II, p. 381).\r\n      _Montchrêtien_, Traité d’Économie politique (1615) 81, 172 seq.\r\n      According to _Sir D. North’s_ Discourses upon Trade, 1691, wealth is\r\n      synonymous with freedom from want, and the ability to procure many\r\n      comforts, while _Temple_ (ob. 1700, Works I, 140 seq.) looks\r\n      entirely at the subjective side of wealth. _Pollexfen_, “England and\r\n      East India inconsistent in their Manufactures” (1697), considers\r\n      gold and silver as the only real wealth. To this definition Davenant\r\n      (ob. 1714), opposes another. Wealth, according to him, is whatever\r\n      places prince or people in a condition of superabundance, peace and\r\n      security. See his Works, I, p. 381 seq. He even reckons intellectual\r\n      powers, alliances etc., among the national wealth. Compare _W.\r\n      Roscher_, Zur Geschichte der englischen Volkswirthschaftslehre 1851,\r\n      in the acts of the royal Saxon Academy of Sciences, vol. III.\r\n      _Vauban_ (Dime royale 1707), Daire’s edition, says: “The real wealth\r\n      of a people consists in an abundance of those things, the use of\r\n      which is so necessary to sustain the life of man, that they cannot\r\n      at all be dispensed with.” By the wealth of a people _Galiani_,\r\n      Della Moneta II, c. 2, understands the aggregate of all lands,\r\n      houses, movable property, money, etc. which belong to them, but,\r\n      that the chief element of wealth, and the condition precedent of all\r\n      others, is men themselves. Hence, the process of the impoverishment\r\n      of a people in their decline, takes the following course: money\r\n      first emigrates, next, population diminishes, afterwards, the houses\r\n      fall in ruin, finally, the land itself becomes a waste. According to\r\n      _Broggia_, wealth is _un avanzo osia valore di tutto cio che avanza\r\n      al proprio consumo e bisogno_, Delle Monete, 1743, IV, 307, 314;\r\n      Cust. _Palmieri_ (ob. 1794), also says: _il superfluo constituisce\r\n      la richezza_. (Publica Felicità.) According to _Turgot_, Sur la\r\n      Formation et Distribution des Richesses 1771, § 90, the wealth of a\r\n      nation consists in the net proceeds of landed property capitalized\r\n      at the ordinary price of land, and then of the aggregate of all the\r\n      movable property of the country. _Büsch_, Geluumlauf III, § 27,\r\n      considers a certain duration of the produce or revenue as an\r\n      essential element in the idea of wealth. _Lauderdale_, Inquiry, ch.\r\n      II, distinguishes national wealth and private wealth; the former\r\n      embracing all that man covets as agreeable or desirable; while it is\r\n      one of the marks of the latter, that there should be no general\r\n      superfluity of it on hand. Several modern English economists call\r\n      wealth only that, the production of which cost human labor. Thus,\r\n      _Malthus_, Definitions (1827) p. 234. _Torrens_, Production of\r\n      Wealth, 1821, ch. I. When _Rossi_, Cours d’Economie politique, 1835,\r\n      L. 2, says: _tout chose propre à satisfaire aux besoins de l’homme\r\n      est richesse_, he demonstrates how the frequent inaccuracy of the\r\n      French language stands in the way of a close analysis. The greater\r\n      number of more recent definitions are true of resources rather than\r\n      of wealth. _Bastiat_ distinguishes between _richesse effective_ and\r\n      _relative_, the former being based on _utilité_, the latter on\r\n      _valeur_. (Harmonies, ch. 6.)\r\n\r\n   99 The national wealth of Athens, at the time of the hundredth\r\n      Olympiad, is estimated by _Böckh_ (Staatshaushalt der Athen, I, p.\r\n      636, 2d ed.) to have been from thirty to forty thousand talents,\r\n      besides the non-taxable property of the state. That of Great Britain\r\n      is estimated at about 8,000 million pounds sterling. (Athenæum 5\r\n      March, 1853.) _Wolowski_ estimated that of France at, at least, 116\r\n      milliards of francs, with an annual increase of 1-½ milliards, (L’or\r\n      et l’Argent, 1870. Enquête, 59.) _David A. Wells_ estimated that of\r\n      the United States, in 1860, slaves not included, at 14,183 million\r\n      dollars, or $451.20 per capita, whereas in England, the per capita\r\n      wealth was about $1,000. (_Hildebrand’s_ Jahib., 1870, I, 431.) The\r\n      national wealth of the kingdom of Saxony is equal to 600 million\r\n      thalers immovable, and 600 million movable, property. (_Engel_,\r\n      Statist. Zeitschr. August, 1856). That of Würtemberg=2,710 million\r\n      florins, of which 700 millions represent movable goods, and 100\r\n      million, claims on foreign countries. (Statistisches Handbuch,\r\n      1863.)

Compare Matthew, 6:33, also I. Timothy, 5:8.) _Adam\r\n      Müller_ in his Nothwendigkeit einer theolog. Grundlage, 49 seq., is\r\n      a strong advocate of all this, but a rather narrow one. The farmer,\r\n      he says, should first work for the love of God, then for the fruit,\r\n      that is, for the gross product, and lastly for the net product. His\r\n      work is a trust. _Müller_ considers the business relations of men,\r\n      as they exist at present, as “the comfortless mutual slavery of\r\n      all.” (Nothwendigkeit einer theolog. Grundlage, 49 ff.) The\r\n      economist, _Ch.

And, in reality, it is\r\n      necessary that, in order not to permit the drowsy conscience to fall\r\n      too far behind self-interest, which is always awake, it should\r\n      create lasting institutions and regulations above and beyond the\r\n      caprice of the individual or of the moment; for instance, in the\r\n      family, marriage, education etc.\r\n\r\n  109 The more private interest ceases to be momentary, and becomes\r\n      life-long and even hereditary, the better does it harmonize with the\r\n      feeling of the common interest.\r\n\r\n_  110 Perin_ says (1, 93), that the conflict of interest is reconciled in\r\n      the seeking for the attainment of the supreme good, that is God,\r\n      “who gives himself to all in equal measure, and yet always remains\r\n      the same, and out of whose fulness all may draw, and yet no one’s\r\n      share grows less.” But the same is true of all ideal goods, and of\r\n      every form of the feeling for the common interest, the highest of\r\n      which is, indeed, religiousness.\r\n\r\n  111 According to _Kant_, Anthropologie, p. 239, the desire of comfort\r\n      and well-being, and the inclination to virtue, when the former is\r\n      properly restrained by the latter, produce the highest degree of\r\n      moral, united to the highest degree of physical, good. It is well\r\n      known, that during the middle ages, in all countries except Italy\r\n      and, even up to the seventeenth century, the moral sciences were\r\n      under a one-sided theological influence, whose ascetic condemnation\r\n      of self-interest may have been well enough during a period of\r\n      violence. By virtue of a very natural reaction, and as a protest of\r\n      individualism against the constraint of absolute monarchy, the\r\n      materialists of the eighteenth century endeavored to discover, even\r\n      in the most exalted phenomena of human society, only the expression\r\n      of an enlightened self-interest. See _Mandeville’s_ Fable of the\r\n      Bees, or private Vices public Virtues (1723), but especially,\r\n      _Helvétius_, De l’Esprit (1758). _Voltaire_ says, that, in all the\r\n      celebrated maxims of _De Rochefoucauld_ (1665) there is but one\r\n      truth contained, _que l’amour propre est le mobile de toutes nos\r\n      actions_. (But see, per contra, _Pufendorf_, Jus Naturæ et Gentium,\r\n      1672, II, 3, 15.) This tendency was opposed, especially by the\r\n      English, who could not be blind to the influence exerted in public\r\n      life by the feeling for the common good. _David Hume_, Treatise on\r\n      Human Nature (1739), III, 54, is of opinion that the interests of\r\n      others are, on the whole, in the case of nearly every man stronger\r\n      than even his own self interest. _Hutcheson_, System of Moral\r\n      Philosophy (1755), speaks of the innate principle of benevolence.\r\n      Man is not a perfect whole; a part belongs to his own person, part\r\n      to his family, part to the nation, part even to all humanity.\r\n      _Burke_, Inquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and\r\n      Beautiful (1756), distinguishes two fundamental principles of\r\n      action, that of self-preservation and that of society. On the former\r\n      is based the sense of the sublime; on the latter, of the beautiful.\r\n      According to _Ferguson_, History of Civil Society, (1767), I, 3, 4,\r\n      the “sense of union” is frequently strongest where the advantage\r\n      drawn from the connection is smallest; for instance, it is weakest\r\n      in highly cultured commercial countries. _Adam Smith_, Theory of\r\n      Moral Sentiments (1768), has been as one-sided in reducing\r\n      everything to “sympathy,” as he has been in his Wealth of Nations in\r\n      reducing everything to “self-interest;” but not without the\r\n      consciousness, that to explain the reality, it is necessary to take\r\n      both into consideration (_Buckle_). It would, indeed, be just as\r\n      preposterous to base economy on self-interest alone, as to base\r\n      marriage merely on the sexual appetite. Recently, _Hermann_,\r\n      Staatswirthschaftliche Untersuchungen, 1st ed., part 1st, discovers\r\n      in self-interest, and in the feeling for the common good, the two\r\n      springs of all economy. He would even base the so-called theoretic\r\n      Political Economy, on the study of self-interest, its practice in\r\n      that of the common good. _M. Chevalier_, Cours d’Economie politique,\r\n      1844, II, 412 ff., understands something very like this by the\r\n      contrast between liberty and centralization. The _antagonisme_ and\r\n      _association_ of _Bazard_, Exposition de la Doctrine de Saint Simon\r\n      (1829), p. 144 ff. Closer investigation will show, however, that\r\n      self-interest, which must not be confounded with egotism, and the\r\n      common interest, are neither coördinate nor exhaustive opposites.\r\n      Compare the beautiful contrast drawn by _Goethe_ (Pocket edition of\r\n      1833, vol. 46, 97), between “Pietät” and “Egoisterei.”\r\n\r\n_  112 Paul_, I. Corinth. 12, gives the most beautiful model description\r\n      of a social organism. Compare, however, the fable of Menenius\r\n      Agrippa in _Livy_, II, 32.\r\n\r\n  113 Excellent beginnings of a general theory of economies in common in\r\n      _Schäffle_, N. Œkonomie, II, Aufl., 62 ff., 331 ff.\r\n\r\n  114 The French and English, with their strong political bias, use the\r\n      expressions respectively _economie politique_ and Political Economy.\r\n      In Germany, where the terms the people (_Volk_) and the state\r\n      (_Staat_) are much less nearly coextensive, the words\r\n      _Volkswirthschaft_ and _Nationalökonomie_ are preferred. But even\r\n      _Hufeland_, who first gave currency to the term _Volkswirthschaft_\r\n      (Grundlegung, I, 14), called attention to the peculiarity “that the\r\n      term economy suggests that there is one who economizes and guides,\r\n      an economist in chief, and that such a one is, even according to the\r\n      most correct opinion, wanting in the public economy of a people.”\r\n\r\n  115 According to _Th. Cooper_, Lectures on the Elements of Political\r\n      Economy, (1726), 1, 15 ff. 117, the wealth of society is nothing but\r\n      the aggregate wealth of all the individuals that compose it. Each\r\n      individual looks out best for his own interests, and, hence, that\r\n      nation must be the richest, in which each individual is most\r\n      completely left to himself. (If this were so, savage nations would\r\n      be the richest!) _Cooper_ goes so far as to disapprove of the\r\n      protection afforded to commerce on the high seas by a national navy;\r\n      no naval war is worth what it costs, and merchants should protect\r\n      themselves. He says, too, that the word “nation” is an invention of\r\n      the grammarians, made to save the trouble of circumlocution, a\r\n      nonentity! _Adam Smith_ is, as might be expected, far removed from\r\n      such absurdities. (Compare Wealth of Nations, IV, ch. 2, and the end\r\n      of the fourth book.) But, even he is of opinion that men, in the\r\n      study of their own advantage are led “naturally, or rather\r\n      necessarily” (IV, ch. 2), to the employment which is most useful to\r\n      society. But here _Adam Smith_ overlooks the fact, that every\r\n      individual nation strives after earthly immortality, and is, in\r\n      consequence, frequently compelled to make immediate sacrifices for\r\n      the sake of a distant future, a thing which can never be to the\r\n      private interest of the mortal individuals who compose it. And thus,\r\n      _D. North_, Discourses upon Trade (1691), 13 seq., says, that in\r\n      commercial matters, different nations stand in precisely the same\r\n      relation to the whole world, that individual cities do to the\r\n      kingdom, and individual families to the city. Similarly,\r\n      _Boisguillebert_, Factum de la France, ch. 10, 327, Daire’s edition.\r\n      _Benjamin Franklin_ (ob. 1790), Political Papers, § 4. And _J. B.\r\n      Say_, Traité d’Economie politique (1802) I, 15: every nation is, in\r\n      relation to neighboring nations, in the situation of a province in\r\n      relation to neighboring provinces. Unfortunately, such doctrine is\r\n      only too palpably refuted by every war! _J. Bentham’s_ saying: _Les\r\n      intérêts individuels sont les seuls intérêts réels_ (Traité de\r\n      Législation, I, 229). _Infra_ § 98.\r\n\r\n      Among those who, in antiquity, most energetically maintained that\r\n      the idea of national economy is not a merely nominal one, is _Plato_\r\n      (De Republ., IV, 420, I, 462); more recently, _Fichte_ (Der\r\n      geschlossene Handelstaat, 1800), although, in general, the\r\n      socialists attach as little importance to nationality as their most\r\n      decided opponents. Adam Müller is a writer who deserves recognition\r\n      for his advocacy of national economy, and of the state as a whole,\r\n      paramount to individuals, and even generations. He gives war the\r\n      credit of causing the scientific knowledge of the state to cast\r\n      deeper roots, and of enlightening individuals in the most forcible\r\n      way, that they are parts of one great whole. (Elemente der\r\n      Staatskunst, 1809, I, 7, 113). He calls public economy, as a whole,\r\n      the product of all products. What, he inquires, is the use of all\r\n      wealth, if it does not guarantee itself? And this, it can do, only\r\n      through the organization of the whole people, that is, through the\r\n      nation (I, 202). _Adam Smith’s_ theory of labor would be correct if\r\n      it considered the entire national life of a people itself as one\r\n      huge piece of labor. (II, 265). And so, Müller directs his polemics\r\n      against Adam Smith’s premise of a merely mercantile world-market.\r\n      (II, 290). Similarly, the protective tariff theoreticians, _Ganieh_,\r\n      Théorie de l’Economie politique (1822), II, 198 ff. and _Fr. List_,\r\n      Nationales System der politischen Oek. (1842), I, 240 ff. _Colton_,\r\n      Political Economy of the United States, 1853. _Sismondi_, Nouveaux\r\n      Principes (1819), I, 197, ridicules the opinion which resolves the\r\n      public interest into merely private interests: It is A’s interest to\r\n      rob B; B, the weaker, is equally interested to let himself be\r\n      robbed, that he may fare no worse. But the state—?!\r\n\r\n  116 National wars are really no mere operations of the will of the\r\n      state! Since 1800, Ireland, and, since 1858, even British India,\r\n      constitute one state with England, and yet how different are the\r\n      economic tendencies of these different countries of which the\r\n      individual husbandman or business man must take cognizance!\r\n\r\n  117 One might also deny the reality of a stream, considered as a whole,\r\n      since its bed, no one calls a stream, and its watery contents change\r\n      every moment. And yet, it is well known to scientific geography that\r\n      every stream has its own individual character.\r\n\r\n  118 This would be to be guilty of explaining _ignotum_ per _ignotius_.\r\n      And yet, there are a great many modern writers who imagine that they\r\n      have said something all-sufficient, when they have told us that the\r\n      state is an organism. As early a writer as _Hufeland_ (N.\r\n      Grundlegung, I, 113), enters his protest against such abuses. The\r\n      person who would operate with this notion, should, at least, have\r\n      read the acute observations, so well calculated to dissipate\r\n      preconceived opinions, made by _Lotze_, in his Allgemeine\r\n      Physiologie des körperlichen Lebens, 1-165. The organic conception\r\n      of national life, the life of a whole people, where the individual\r\n      organs are free and rational beings, is evidently a much more\r\n      difficult one to form than that of the animal or human body.\r\n\r\n  119 I first called attention, in my work on the life-work and age of\r\n      _Thucydides_, to the fact that that great historian always accounts\r\n      for causes in the following manner: A. is produced by B., and B. by\r\n      A. (_Roscher_, Leben Work und Zeitalter des Thukydides, 199 ff.;\r\n      compare especially _Thucyd._, I, 2, 7, seq.) Such a circle is not a\r\n      vicious one. All first class historians have thus explained\r\n      historical phenomena. The one-sided deduction of A. from B., and B.\r\n      from C., etc., which the so-called pragmatic writers like\r\n      _Polybius_, for instance, is the result of overlooking all\r\n      reciprocal action. _Scialoja_, Principii (1840), p. 60, makes a\r\n      somewhat similar observation for Political Economy.\r\n\r\n  120 Whether we call the unknown and inexplicable ground back of all\r\n      analysis, and which our analysis cannot reach, vital force, generic\r\n      form, spirit of the nation, or God’s thought, is for the present a\r\n      matter of scientific indifference. All the more necessary are the\r\n      self-knowledge and honesty, in general, which admit the existence of\r\n      this background, and which do not, by denying it, deny the\r\n      connection of the whole, which is, for the most part, much more\r\n      important than the analyzed parts. But I must at the same time,\r\n      enter my energetic protest against the imputations of heresy made by\r\n      those who do not comprehend the sacred duty of science, by never\r\n      ceasing investigation, to push farther back the bounds of this\r\n      inexplicable background.\r\n\r\n  121 When _Hildebrand_, for instance, objects to the application of the\r\n      expression “natural law” to the economic actions of man, for the\r\n      reason that it conflicts with human freedom and man’s capacity for\r\n      progress (Jahrbücher der N. Œek. und Statistik., 1863, Heft., I), I\r\n      cannot agree with him. I use the expression “natural law” wherever I\r\n      observe uniformity, explicable in its broader connections, and not\r\n      dependent on human design. That there are such uniformities there\r\n      can be no question. I need only mention the philological law of the\r\n      so-called “permutation of consonants,” which individuals follow when\r\n      speaking—certainly not through compulsion,—and, by means of which,\r\n      the progress of the speaking aggregate is made manifest. Or, I might\r\n      call attention to the well known fact, that, in populous countries\r\n      marriages and crimes, which are for the most part free, are divided\r\n      among the different age-classes in a proportion much more uniform,\r\n      from year to year, than are deaths, which are not free. I adhere all\r\n      the more firmly to the expression “natural law,” because no one\r\n      takes offense at or objects to the expression, “nature of the human\r\n      soul.” But to this very nature of the human soul belong the freedom\r\n      and responsibility of the individual, as well as the capacity of the\r\n      species for progress. Compare _A. Wagner_, on Law in the Apparently\r\n      capricious Actions of Man (_Die Gesetzmässigkeit in den scheinbar\r\n      willkürlichen menschlichen Handlungen_, 1864, p. 63 seq.), in which,\r\n      however, he only goes so far as to show that law and freedom coexist\r\n      side by side as indubitable facts, while the seeming contradiction\r\n      between the two remains. _Drobisch’s_ Moralische Statistik und die\r\n      menschliche Willensfreiheit, 1867, is an important contribution to\r\n      the literature of this question.\r\n\r\n_  122 Whately_, in his fourth lecture (Lectures, 1831), shows in a very\r\n      clear way, how London is supplied and provisioned by men with no\r\n      object in view but their own personal interest, each of whom is\r\n      possessed of but a very limited knowledge of the aggregate wants of\r\n      its inhabitants, and yet they work into one another’s hands, in the\r\n      interests of the whole, purely instinctively, and infinitely better,\r\n      perhaps, than the operations of the most skillful governmental\r\n      commission, organized for the same purpose.\r\n\r\n  123 Alphonsus of Castile, the king astrologer of the thirteenth century,\r\n      is reported to have said, that the universe would have been much\r\n      better constituted, if the Creator had asked his advice beforehand.\r\n      Astronomers like Newton and Gauss have, certainly, judged otherwise.\r\n\r\n_  124 MacCulloch_ remarks, that there is an essential difference between\r\n      the physical and the moral and political sciences in this, that the\r\n      principles of the former apply in all cases, those of the latter,\r\n      only in the greater number of cases—a thought very ably developed by\r\n      _Knies_, loc. cit., _passim_. If, with _Newmarch_, (London\r\n      Statistical Journal, 1861, p. 460 seq.), we could grant, that there\r\n      is no “law,” except where it is possible to predict each individual\r\n      occurrence under it, there would be no such thing even as the “laws”\r\n      of the probability of life. The word “element,” also, means\r\n      something very different in Political Economy from what it does in\r\n      chemistry: a combination which might be broken up, but which that\r\n      science leaves it to other sciences to do. The “element” of\r\n      Political Economy is Man. Compare _Pickford_, Einleitung in die\r\n      politische Œk., 1860, 17.\r\n\r\n  125 It is in this sense that _Aristotle_ (Polit., I, p. 1, 9 Schn.)\r\n      says: φανερὸν, ὅτι τῶν φύσει ἡ πόλις ἐστὶ, καὶ ὅτι ἄνθρωπος φύσει\r\n      πολιτικὸν ζῶον. According to _L. Stein, Lehrbuch der\r\n      Volkswirthschaft_, 1858, 33, the political economy of a people\r\n      begins at the point where the overplus of individuals begins.\r\n\r\n  126 Compare _K. L. von Haller_, Restauration der Staatswissenchaft, I,\r\n      p. 446 ff.\r\n\r\n  127 As _Sallust_ characterizes the political apogee of the Romans:\r\n      _Optimis moribus et maxima concordia egit populus Romanus inter\r\n      secundum atque postremum bellum Carthaginiense._ See _Augustin_\r\n      (Civ. Dei II, 18). _Puchta_ (Institutionen, I, f. 83), with a great\r\n      deal of good sense, distinguishes in every people their individual\r\n      character from that which they share in common with all mankind. The\r\n      latter exists among savage nations, only as a germ buried under the\r\n      overpowering weight of that which is special to them. The period of\r\n      the perfect equilibrium of both elements is coincident with that of\r\n      a people’s real culture. In the further course of development, the\r\n      latter, more general element becomes gradually over-powerful,\r\n      destroys the individual, and thus dissolves nationality.\r\n\r\n  128 Thus formulated, the principles of the two great parties, evidently,\r\n      no more contradict one another than their ordinary watchwords,\r\n      “freedom” and “order,” are in contrast with one another. Hence all\r\n      the great statesmen of the best periods of history have adopted the\r\n      middle course recommended by Aristotle.\r\n\r\n  129 See _Lotze_, Allgemeine Pathologie, 1842. _Ruete_, Lehrbuch der\r\n      allgemeinen Therapie, 1852. These analogies, obviously, should not\r\n      be pushed too far. One of the most essential differences between the\r\n      two consists in this, that in the diseases of the body politic,\r\n      physicians and nurses are themselves part of the diseased organism.\r\n\r\n  130 See _Ahren’s_ very beautiful exposition, Organische Staatslehre,\r\n      1850, I, 77. National economy (_Nationalökonomie_=public economy);\r\n      national economics (_Nationalökonomik_=the science of public\r\n      economy). The latter term was first proposed, in Germany, in 1849,\r\n      by _Uhde_; the former was naturalized therein 1805: _v. Soden_,\r\n      Nationalökonomie, 1805; _Jacob_, Grundsätze der N. Œk., 1806. In\r\n      Italy, _G. Ortes_ used it as early as 1774, in his Dell Economia\r\n      nazionale, and in England it was employed, even in 1867, by\r\n      _Ferguson_, History of Civil Society, III, p. 4. Holland.\r\n      Volkshuyshoudkunde. As a rule, outside of Germany, the term\r\n      political economy, _économie politique_, one which is somewhat\r\n      calculated to mislead the student, is used. (Thus _Montchrêtien\r\n      sieur de Vatteville_, Traité de l’Economie _politique_, 165; later\r\n      _J. J. Rousseau_, Discours sur l’Economie politique, later yet the\r\n      Traités d’E. p., _Maillardère_, _Page_ and _J. B. Say_, 1801-1803).\r\n      Political Economy (_Sir J. Stewart_, Inquiry into the principles of\r\n      P. E., 1767); also Public Economy (_Petty_, several Essays, 1682,\r\n      35); _Economia politica_ or _pubblica_ (the latter by _Verri_ and\r\n      _Beccaria_). The title _Economia civile_ (_Genovesi_, Lezioni, d’Ec.\r\n      civ. 1769), has found few adherents. It has, however, been used\r\n      recently by _Cernuschi_: Illusions des Sociétés coöperatrices\r\n      (1866). The term, _Economie sociale_ has been used all the more in\r\n      France (Dunoyer, Nouveau Traité d’Ec. soc., 1830), since recommended\r\n      by _J. B. Say_, and employed by _Buat_ (Des vrais Principes de\r\n      l’Origine et de la Filiation du Mot Economie politique, in the\r\n      Journal des Economistes, 1852.)\r\n\r\n_  131 Stein_, Lehrbuck der V. W., prefaces his “Science of Public\r\n      Economy” (pp. 329-358), by a “Science of Economy” (pp. 96-328),\r\n      which, however, treats individual economies only as the elements of\r\n      the national economy. A science of household or isolated individual\r\n      economy could, of course, treat only of the economic relations of\r\n      anchorites. Those who object that Political Economy is not a real\r\n      whole will be satisfied with the definition of it given by _F. I.\r\n      Neumann_: “The Science of the bearing of household or separate\r\n      economies to one another, and to the state as a whole.” (Tüb.\r\n      Zeitschr., 1872, 267.)\r\n\r\n  132 In so far as these various institutions are concerned, with objects\r\n      beyond the human, or supernatural, only the manner in which they are\r\n      accepted, or in which they are made use of, is an expression of\r\n      national life.\r\n\r\n  133 Thus, _J. Tucker_ thinks that religion, the state and commerce, are\r\n      only the parts of one same general plan: no institution, therefore,\r\n      can be called appropriate, within the limits of the province of any\r\n      one of these, if it be clearly in opposition to the other two,\r\n      because the harmony of God’s work can not be broken up. (Four Tracts\r\n      and two Sermons on political and commercial Subjects, 1774, Serm.\r\n      I.)\r\n\r\n_  134 Riedel_ (National Œkonomie, 1838, I, p. 178 seq.), gives a good\r\n      illustration of the difference between the manner in which law and\r\n      Political Economy look at the same question. The law (to avoid\r\n      strife, or to settle controversies) looks upon the debtor as the\r\n      owner of the capital, and lets him run all the risk; Political\r\n      Economy, on the other hand, looking deeper into the nature of the\r\n      contract, reaches an entirely opposite result. The mere jurist has a\r\n      dangerous tendency to undervalue the reign of the laws of nature;\r\n      the mere political economist, just as readily, undervalues the\r\n      element of free will. (_Arnold_, Cultur und Recht I, 97.) In this\r\n      respect, the two sciences complement each other very well. _Roesler_\r\n      (_Hildebrand’s_ Jahrb., 1868, II, and 1869, I.) shows, and he does\r\n      not exaggerate the fact, that political economists have made\r\n      altogether too little use of the results of the science of law.\r\n\r\n  135 Jurists will always experience the want of divesting their isolated\r\n      ideas of their purely accidental character, by grouping them\r\n      together in such a manner as to make them constitute a complete and\r\n      independent whole. One must be possessed of profound knowledge to\r\n      perceive their necessary connection from an historico-juridical\r\n      point of view. Political Economy, with its characteristic accuracy\r\n      and practical utility, can best take its place, at the present time.\r\n      It is in the greater number of legal questions, the systematically\r\n      elaborated science of “the nature of the thing.” See the able\r\n      beginnings of a policy of legislation and higher history of law,\r\n      based on Political Economy, by _H. Dankwardt_: N.

In France, the\r\n      expression _économie de l’état_, is very seldom used. _Gavard_,\r\n      Principes del’E. d’Etat, 1796.\r\n\r\n_  140 Pölitz_, Staatswissenschaften im Lichte unserer Zeit, II, 3.\r\n      Compare _Lotz_, Handbuch der Staatswirthschaft (2d ed., 1837), I, 10\r\n      ff.\r\n\r\n  141 Our view of Political Economy holds a middle place between opposed\r\n      extremes. The view expressed by _Whately_, Lectures on Political\r\n      Economy (1831), No. 1, and covered by the proposed term\r\n      “catalactics,” is by far too narrow. Similarly, _Macleod_, Elements\r\n      of Political Economy, 1858, I, 11. A like objection may be raised to\r\n      the earlier title of _Pritzwitz’s_ book: Die Kunst reich zu\r\n      werden,—the art of growing rich. On the other hand, _Dunoyer_,\r\n      Liberté du Travail (1845), L. IX, ch. I, goes too far altogether:\r\n      “not only in what manner a nation grows rich, but according to what\r\n      laws it best succeeds, in the execution of all its functions.” And\r\n      so _Storch_, Handbuch, translated into German by _Rau_, I, 9. Many\r\n      modern writers define Political Economy simply as the theory of\r\n      society; for instance, _Scialoja_, Principj. dell’Economia sociale,\r\n      1840. _Cibrario_, E. polit. del medio Evo, III, 1842.\r\n\r\n  142 For the many and various definitions of the police power, see _von\r\n      Berg_, Handbuch des Polezeirechts, I, 1-12; _Butte_, Versuch der\r\n      Begründung eines System der Polezei (1807), 6 ff.; _Rosshirt_, Ueber\r\n      den Begriff der Staatspolizoi (1817), 34 ff. One of the principal\r\n      difficulties is, that the practical domain of the police power is,\r\n      in consequence of the successive grades of civilization through\r\n      which a people passes, subject to greater modifications than any\r\n      other state power. We call attention especially to the expressions\r\n      “without mediation, to prevent,” and “external order,” in our\r\n      definition. The church, the school, the administration of justice\r\n      etc., act mediately towards the prevention of such disturbances; and\r\n      there are many other institutions which offer immediate protection\r\n      to order of a higher and more intellectual nature.\r\n\r\n  143 See the great number of earlier definitions collected in _R. von\r\n      Mohl_, Gesch. und Literatur der Staatswissenschaften III, pp. 637\r\n      ff. There are two principal groups of them, the one of which\r\n      considers it as the science of things of political note, the other\r\n      as the science of actual or past conditions.\r\n\r\n  144 See _Dufau_, Traité de Statistique, 1840; _Moreau de Jonnès_,\r\n      Elements de Statistique, 1847; _Knies_, Die Statistik als\r\n      selbstständige Wissenschaft, 1850. _B. Hildebrand_, in his\r\n      Jahrbüchern, 1866, I etc., but especially _Quetelet’s_ works. For\r\n      the contrary view, see _Fallati_, Einleitung in die Wissenschaft der\r\n      Statistik der St., 1843; _Jonak_, Theorie der Statistik, 1856, and\r\n      _Heeren_, in the Gött. Gelehrten Anzeigen, 1806, No. 84, 1807, 1302.\r\n\r\n  145 So thinks _v. Rümelin_ (Tübinger Zeitschr., 1863, 653 ff.); and he\r\n      recommends in place of statistics an independent branch of learning\r\n      bordering on history and geography, to be called demography. His\r\n      statistics is a science auxiliary to all the experimental sciences\r\n      of man, just as criticism and hermeneutics are a methodological\r\n      science auxiliary to many sciences, otherwise different. It would be\r\n      difficult to justify the use of the name statistics for such a\r\n      science, as such a science corresponds to neither of the two\r\n      meanings of the word _status_ (state—condition).\r\n\r\n  146 The ancients understood by the term καμάρα _camera_, covered places\r\n      such especially as were vaulted, also vaults of the most varied\r\n      kind. Compare _Herod_, I, 199; _Diod._, II, 9; _Strabo_, XI, 495;\r\n      _Arrian_, Exp. _Alex._, VII, 5, 55; _Dio Cass_. XXXVI, 32;\r\n      _Sallust_, B. C., 55; _Cicero_, ad Q. fratrem III, 1; _Plin._, H. N.\r\n      XXX, 27; _Seneca_, Epist., 86; _Tacit._ Hist. III, 47; _Sueton_,\r\n      Nero, 34. During the middle ages, the meaning treasure-chamber\r\n      (_Schatzkammer_) became predominant: _camera est locus, in quem\r\n      thesaurus recoilligitur, vel conclave, in quo pecunia reservatur_\r\n      (_Ocham_, Cap. Quid sit Scaccarium). It gradually became synonymous\r\n      with finance,—from the time of Charlemagne, or at least since Louis\r\n      II. (Charter of 874). See _Ducange_, Glossarium, v. Camera, and\r\n      _Muratori_ Antiquitt. Ital., I, 932 ff.\r\n\r\n  147 “A husbandman must plow and manure his land if he would reap a\r\n      harvest from it. He must fatten his cattle if he would slaughter\r\n      them; and furnish his cows with good fodder if he would have them\r\n      give good milk. In like manner, a prince should begin by assuring\r\n      his subjects healthy and abundant food, if he would take anything\r\n      from them.” _von Schröder_, Fürstl. Schatz-und Rentkammer (1686),\r\n      preface, § 11. _Von Horneck_ before him, Oesterreich über alles wann\r\n      es nur will, p. 220, ed. of 1707, had expressed the idea that the\r\n      watchful solicitude for the public economy of the country was no\r\n      _parergon_, no _appendix_, to the council (_Kammer_), but its real\r\n      basis, and that it embraced many subjects which had nothing in\r\n      common with the cameralia (“_Cameralien_”).\r\n\r\n_  148 Morhof_, Polyhistor (1688), III. _Thomasius_, 1728, Cautelæ circa\r\n      præcognita Jurisprudentiæ (1710), ch. 17.

Œk. in Deutschland,\r\n      328 ff.\r\n\r\n  149 While _Dithmar_ (1731) distinguishes economy-police and cameralistic\r\n      sciences and restricts the latter to finance and taxation; _Darjes_\r\n      (1756) comprises under the name of cameralistic science, economy\r\n      (municipal and rural), and police, as well as cameralistic subjects\r\n      in the strict sense of the term, that is, the public, domain and\r\n      regal rights. While _Nau_ (1791), in his “Ersten Linien der C.,”\r\n      treats only of the branches of private economy, _Schmalz_, (1797)\r\n      treats also of national or public economy, and _Rössig_ (1792)\r\n      divides cameralistic science into the doctrine of the public demesne\r\n      and regal rights (cameralistic science in the narrower sense), and\r\n      the doctrine of taxation and police.\r\n\r\n  150 Thus, for instance, all that concerns domestic economy, book-keeping\r\n      and private financial administration.\r\n\r\n_  151 John Stuart Mill_, Principles of Political Economy (1848), I, p.\r\n      25, draws a distinction between the physical conditions which\r\n      influence the economic situation of a people, and the moral and\r\n      psychological conditions; which last have their origin in social\r\n      institutions or in the fundamental principles of human nature. Only\r\n      the latter belong to the domain of Political Economy. According to\r\n      _J. B. Say_, Traité, Introd., this science embraces at once\r\n      agriculture, manufactures and commerce, but only in their relation\r\n      to the increase or diminution of wealth, and does not concern itself\r\n      with the means employed to reach the desired end. As a rule, says\r\n      _Arndt_ (Naturgemässe Volkswirthschaft, 1851, p. 16), it takes into\r\n      consideration not so much things themselves as their exchange value.\r\n      _Lotz_ (Handbuch, I, p. 6 seq.), in like manner, defines Political\r\n      Economy—the science of the one activity which constitutes the basis\r\n      of all industries etc. _F. G. Schulze_ (Ueber volkswirthschaftliche\r\n      Begründung der Gewerbswissenschaften, 1826), characterizes Political\r\n      Economy as the science of the fundamental conditions of the\r\n      well-being of a people, in so far as they lie in human nature.\r\n\r\n      When _Adam Smith_ (book IV, c. II) says that the government in\r\n      respect to matters of economy is inferior to the first best person\r\n      engaged in industrial pursuits, he is right only from a technic\r\n      point of view. And when _Stewart_, on the other hand, vindicates for\r\n      the state the office of a pater-familias (book II, ch. 13), he\r\n      evidently means only in national economical matters.\r\n\r\n  152 See also _Rau_ (Ueber die Cameralwissenschaft, Entwickelung ihres\r\n      Wesens und ihrer Theile, 1825); _Baumstark_ (Cameralistische\r\n      Enclycopädie, 1835).\r\n\r\n_  153 Xenoph._ Œconom.

Hence it was an error of the stoics to despise them\r\n      under all circumstances. (Summa Theol. II, 2.

See the magnificent\r\n      description by Demosthenes, in which he shows the over-estimation of\r\n      material things to be the principal cause of the decline of Athens,\r\n      and in which he lays great stress on the fact, that Athens, on its\r\n      decay, had a larger population, more wealth, ships, and evidences of\r\n      external power, than in its golden age. (Phil., III, 120 seq.) Also\r\n      Phil., IV, 144, cautions us against the Manchester criterion of\r\n      national prosperity. See _Plato_, De Rep., VIII. In Rome, the\r\n      principle _ommia venalia esse_ was a chief element in the total\r\n      decline and fall of the republic. (_Sallust_, Cat., 10 ff., Jug., 8\r\n      ff.) In an age when people think they can do everything with money,\r\n      the ruin of all things is the last end of mercantile, financial and\r\n      political speculation. (_Condillac_, Le Commerce et le Gouverment,\r\n      1776, II, 18.)\r\n\r\n  157 Under Pericles, the Athenian treasury of the state contained at most\r\n      9,700 talents. (_Thucyd._ II, 13.) On the other hand, Alexander the\r\n      Great had a treasure of 180,000 talents accumulated in the citadel\r\n      of Ecbatana. (_Strabo_, XV, 731); Ptolomy II. left after him 740,000\r\n      talents. (_Appian._ præf. 10, _Droysen_, Geschichte des Hellenismus\r\n      II, 44 ff.) In Nero’s time there was many a freedman’s daughter who\r\n      owned a looking glass worth a greater sum than the senate had\r\n      appropriated as a dowry to the daughter of the great Scipio.\r\n      (_Seneca_, Quæst. Natur. I, 17. Compare Cons, ad Helviam, 12.)\r\n      _McCulloch_ says that an intelligent despotism can enrich a nation\r\n      as well as freedom. (In his Discourse on the Rise, etc. of Polit.\r\n      Econ., 1825, 77 seq.)\r\n\r\n_  158 Bacon_ (Sermones, 56) says that youthful states distinguish\r\n      themselves specially by their warlike instincts; mature states in\r\n      literature; old and decaying ones in industry and commerce.\r\n      _Davenant_ very happily remarks, that the development of commerce\r\n      among a people has an ambiguous value. It, indeed, increases wealth,\r\n      but, at the same time, it may introduce luxury, covetousness and\r\n      fraud, destroy virtue, do away with simplicity of manners and\r\n      customs, and then it inevitably ends in internal or external\r\n      slavery. (Works II, 275.) The simplicity of the patriarchal state,\r\n      however, cannot last always, if for no other reason, because of the\r\n      emulation of foreign nations. (1, 348, ff.) The impoverishment of\r\n      even the wealthiest nation is certainly inevitable when its morality\r\n      declines. It is especially true, that the public economy of a people\r\n      can be prosperous only where political liberty obtains, and this,\r\n      independent of the fact that wealth without freedom has no value.\r\n      (II, 336 ff., 380, ff., 285.) According to _Ferguson_, private\r\n      wealth, honestly acquired, used rightly and with moderation, managed\r\n      with a sense of independence, may be to those who possess it, an\r\n      element of self-confidence and of liberty, provided they loosen\r\n      their purse strings not through vanity or for their personal\r\n      gratification, but for commendable party purposes. But in periods of\r\n      decay, even a greater amount of wealth is very far from producing\r\n      these results. (History of Civil Society, VI, 5.) _Whately_, on the\r\n      contrary, maintains that only personal wealth—never national\r\n      wealth—has a disastrous influence on morals. Lectures, No. 2.\r\n\r\n  159 “The method of a science is of much greater importance than any\r\n      individual discovery, however wonderful.” (_Cuvier._)\r\n\r\n  160 Thus, for instance, _G. Biel_ (ob. 1495), the “last of the\r\n      schoolmen,” gives us his doctrine of Political Economy, in a work on\r\n      Dogmatic Theology, in the chapter on Penance, his starting point\r\n      being the inquiry, how the economic damage caused by the sinner may\r\n      be repaired. _Roscher_, Geschichte der Nationalökonomik in\r\n      Deutchland, 1074, I, 23. The Melittotheologia, Arachnotheologia of\r\n      later times! A recent attempt in this direction has been made by\r\n      _Ad. Müller_, Nothwendigkeit einer theologischen Grundage der\r\n      gesammten Staatswissenschaften und der Staatswirthschaft\r\n      insbesondere (1819), i.e., “necessity of a theological basis for all\r\n      political science, and especially for Political Economy.” He divides\r\n      political science into two parts: the science of law, and the\r\n      science of wisdom, embracing under the latter denomination,\r\n      politics, Political Economy, etc. Law emanates from God, as supreme\r\n      judge; the science of wisdom from God, as our Supreme Father.\r\n\r\n  161 Abstraction is indulged in on a large scale, when a number of\r\n      elements which are always found combined in life, are here separated\r\n      and examined apart. It is precisely thus that anatomy proceeds,\r\n      dissecting each member of the human frame, separating the bones,\r\n      ligaments and muscles from one another, thus becoming the necessary\r\n      preparatory school to physiology.\r\n\r\n  162 Thus, for instance, _Canard_, Principes d’Economie politique (1801).\r\n      Also _Kröncke_, in several of his works, and _Count Buquoy_, in his\r\n      Theorie der Nationalwirthschaft (1816), p. 333 ff.; _Lang_,\r\n      Grundlinien einer politischen Arithmetik, Charkow, 1811, and more\r\n      especially _v.

See my criticism of his method in _Birnbaum’s_ Georgika, 1869,\r\n      77 ff. _Voa Thünen’s_ first volume is an essay towards a geometrical\r\n      exposition of the science.

The\r\n      duration of a feeling is treated as an abscissa, its intensity as\r\n      the ordinate of a curve, and its quantity as the area. Future\r\n      feelings are reduced to present ones, by allowing for their\r\n      distance, and the uncertainty of their occurrence. All this,\r\n      however, is rather curious than scientifically useful.\r\n\r\n_  163 Herbart_, Ueber die Möglichkeit und Nothwendigkeit, Mathematik auf\r\n      Psychologie anzuwenden; Kleinere Schriften, II, 417.\r\n\r\n  164 How detrimental it is to ignore the psychological nature of\r\n      Political Economy is evident from the errors of _Karl Marx_, who\r\n      personifies things in a manner almost mythological. Thus, according\r\n      to him, modesty should be ascribed to a coat which exchanges for a\r\n      piece of linen, and purpose to the linen, etc. (Das Kapital, 1867,\r\n      I, 19, 22, seq.) The greatest fault of this intelligent but not very\r\n      acute man, his inability to reduce complicated phenomena to their\r\n      constituent elements, is greatly increased by his way of thus\r\n      looking at things.\r\n\r\n  165 Compare _J. B. Say_, Traité I, introd. Thus, it would be certainly\r\n      possible to describe every individual’s physiognomy by means of a\r\n      very complicated mathematical formula, and yet there is no one who\r\n      would not prefer the usual mode of taking pictures. The simple\r\n      motions of the heavenly bodies, on the contrary, are always treated\r\n      mathematically. (_Lotze_, Allgemeine Physiologie, 322 ff.)\r\n\r\n  166 When _Fawcett_ says that all “principles of Political Economy are\r\n      describing tendencies instead of actual results” (Manual of\r\n      Political Economy, 1863, p. 90), our method, the historical, would\r\n      give also the theory of the latter.\r\n\r\n  167 This was lost sight of by most writers during the second half of the\r\n      eighteenth century, because they looked upon that equality as the\r\n      really oldest condition, and its restoration the ideal to be striven\r\n      for. How much of this still clings to the present free-trade school;\r\n      see in _Roscher_, Gesch. der N. Œk. in Deutschland, 10, 17 ff.\r\n\r\n  168 Thus, for instance, _Ricardo_ examines, almost exclusively, the\r\n      actual condition of things, while the socialists confine themselves,\r\n      still more exclusively, to the investigation of how things should\r\n      be. It has been very usual in Germany since _Rau_ wrote, to draw a\r\n      distinction between theoretical and practical Political Economy.\r\n      There are many who think that a good manual of practical Political\r\n      Economy, dropping the introduction, demonstrations etc., would be\r\n      also a good code of law, of universal application. _Mercier de la\r\n      Rivière_ has said that he wished to propose an organization which\r\n      should be necessarily productive of all the happiness which can be\r\n      enjoyed on earth. (Ordre essentiel et naturel (1767), Disc. prélim.)\r\n      Compare, also, _Sismondi_, N. Principes, I, ch. 2.\r\n\r\n  169 The word method is used in an essentially different sense, when the\r\n      inquiry is, whether the inductive or deductive method is followed in\r\n      Political Economy. _J. S. Mill_ calls Political Economy, and,\r\n      indeed, all “sociology,” a concrete deductive science, whose _a\r\n      priori_ conclusions, based on the laws of human nature, must be\r\n      tested by experience, either by comparing them with the concrete\r\n      phenomena themselves, or with their emperical laws. It, in this,\r\n      resembles astronomy and physics. (System of Logic VI, ch. 9. Essays\r\n      on some unsettled questions of Political E., No. 5.) According to\r\n      this, an economic fact can be said to have received a scientific\r\n      explanation only when its deductive and inductive explanations have\r\n      met and agreed. “Only those principles which, after they have been\r\n      obtained by the one, are confirmed by the other method, can be said\r\n      to have a scientific basis.” (_von Mangoldt_, Grundriss, 8.) While I\r\n      agree to this view, it seems necessary to me to mention points\r\n      wherein caution is necessary: A. Even the deductive explanation of\r\n      economic facts is based on observation, namely, on the\r\n      self-observation of the person accounting for them, who, consciously\r\n      or unconsciously, must always inquire: If I had experienced or\r\n      accomplished the same fact, what should I have thought, willed and\r\n      felt? The man who cannot translate himself into the souls of others,\r\n      will give a wrong explanation of most economic facts. In the\r\n      question, for instance, of the determination of the price of an\r\n      article, the person who can look into the mind of one of the\r\n      contracting parties only, will give a one-sided explanation of the\r\n      facts. B. Moreover, every explanation, that is, satisfactory\r\n      connection of the fact seeking explanation with other facts which\r\n      are already clear, can be only provisional. The wider our horizon\r\n      grows, the deeper should our solution of all questions become. A\r\n      hundred years hence, should science increase in the mean time, the\r\n      solutions which are satisfactory to us will be looked down upon by\r\n      our posterity, as the speculations of our fathers antecedent to Adam\r\n      Smith’s time are looked down upon by us.\r\n\r\n_  170 Tanquam e vinculis sermocinantur_, says _Bacon_ (De Dignit. et\r\n      Augm. Scient., III, 3), of those who have written in a not\r\n      non-practical way on the laws. _Hugo_, also (Naturrecht, 1819, p.\r\n      9), calls attention to the resemblance of the so-called laws of\r\n      nature, to the positive law in force at the time. As to political\r\n      idealism, see _Roscher_: De historicæ doctrinæ apud sophistas\r\n      majores vestigiis (Gött. 1838, 26 ff.). The only exceptions to this\r\n      rule are the eclectics, who form their own system from the blossoms\r\n      of all foreign ones, a system, indeed, without root, and which\r\n      therefore must soon wither.\r\n\r\n  171 In this place, naturally, such an assertion can be made only as a\r\n      programme to be carried out, the proof whereof is to be sought in\r\n      the rest of the work. By “the people,” we do not mean the governed,\r\n      to the exclusion of the governing classes, but both classes\r\n      together. We attach to the expression the most extensive meaning\r\n      possible. We do not limit it to the present generation, but intend\r\n      it to cover all the generations from the beginning of a people’s\r\n      history to its end.\r\n\r\n  172 The custom, which has become general, of calling all democratic\r\n      movements, and them only, revolutions (thus _Stahl_: Was ist\r\n      Revolution? 1852, and many other writers of an entirely opposite\r\n      tendency, especially in France), is not warranted. It is true that\r\n      democratic (and imperial) revolutions are more frequent than others\r\n      in our times, just as aristocratic revolutions were in the middle\r\n      ages, and monarchical at the beginning of modern history. The\r\n      essence of revolution, however, is in the operation of change\r\n      contrary to positive law, acknowledged as such by the consciousness\r\n      of the people.\r\n\r\n  173 Compare, especially, the first pages of _Sir J. Stewart_, Principles\r\n      of Polit. Economy.\r\n\r\n  174 See _Colton_, Public Economy of the United States, p. 28, who,\r\n      indeed, unwarrantedly, refers to the whole of Political Economy,\r\n      what properly belongs to its precepts.\r\n\r\n_  175 Je n’impose rien, je ne propose même rien: j’expose._ (_Ch.\r\n      Dunoyer_). _Cherbuliez_, Précis de la Science économique, 1862, p. 7\r\n      ff., has exaggerated this idea in a strangely non-practical manner.\r\n      That the historical method does not differ essentially from the\r\n      statistical as recently recommended, see _Roscher_, Gesch. der Nat.\r\n      Œk., 1035 seq.\r\n\r\n_  176 Storch_, Handbuch, II, 222.\r\n\r\n_  177 Ad. Müller_, an essentially mediæval mind, is guilty of this same\r\n      braggadocio in an opposite direction, when he calls the “present\r\n      with its political disorders simply an intermediate state,—the\r\n      transmission of the natural or unconscious wisdom of the fathers,\r\n      through the inquisitiveness of their children to the rational\r\n      acknowledgment of that wisdom by their grandsons.” (Theorie des\r\n      Geldes, 1816, pref.)\r\n\r\n  178 Thus, for instance, it can not be said that a model university is\r\n      better than a model public school; and yet the former is higher,\r\n      because the age to which it is adapted is doubtless intellectually\r\n      higher.\r\n\r\n_  179 Knies_ (Polit. Œk., 256 seq.) remarks, that it would be a great\r\n      mistake, and it is the mistake of the majority, to consider what has\r\n      been achieved or striven for in the present, as the absolute _non\r\n      plus ultra_, and thus to look upon all future generations as called\r\n      upon to play the parts of apes and ruminators; a remark worthy to be\r\n      taken to heart.\r\n\r\n  180 I have, myself, no doubt, that up to the present time, mankind, as a\r\n      whole, has, from the beginning of historical knowledge, always\r\n      advanced. In individual cases, their movement has been interrupted\r\n      by so many pauses, and even by so many occasional retrogressions,\r\n      that great care must be taken not to infer superior excellence from\r\n      mere subsequency.\r\n\r\n_  181 Buckle_ writes of people whose knowledge is about limited to that\r\n      which they see going on under their eyes, and who are called\r\n      practical, only because of their ignorance; and he adds that,\r\n      although they assume to despise theory, they are in fact slaves of\r\n      theory, of others’ theories.\r\n\r\n  182 Compare this whole chapter with _Roscher_, Leben Werk und Zeitalter\r\n      des Thukydides, 1842, pp. 25, 239-275; _Roscher_, Grundries zu\r\n      Vorlesungen über die Staatswirthschaft nach geschichtlicher Methode,\r\n      1843, preface; _Roscher_ Geschichte der Nat. Œk. in Deutchland\r\n      (1874), 882 f., 1017 seq., and D. Vierteljahrsschrift, ff. See also\r\n      _J. Kautz’s_ learned and accurate Theorie und Geschichte der N.\r\n      Œkonomik, vol. I, 1858, II, 1860. I find no real contradiction\r\n      between the views here expressed and those of _Kautz_, when he (I,\r\n      pp. 313 ff.) introduces history and ethico-practical reason with\r\n      their ideals as sources of Political Economy, to the end that the\r\n      science may be something more than simply a picture, namely, a model\r\n      of economic life. Apart from the fact that it is only the\r\n      ethico-practical reason that can understand history at all, the\r\n      ideals of a period constitute one of the most important elements of\r\n      its history. The aspirations of an age find in them their best\r\n      expression. The historical political, economist as such, is\r\n      certainly not disinclined to form plans of reform, nor can it be\r\n      said that he is not adapted to the performance of such a task. Only,\r\n      he will scarcely recommend his reforms as absolutely better than\r\n      what they are intended to supplant. He will confine himself to\r\n      showing that there is a want which may, probably, be best satisfied\r\n      by what he proposes. See _Sartorius_, Einladungsblätter zu\r\n      Vorlesungen über die Politik, 1793.\r\n\r\n  183 “There is a book which youth may use to grow old, and the old to\r\n      remain young—History.” (_K. S. Zaccharia_).\r\n\r\n  184 Especially when natural science begins to be “a practical science.”\r\n      (_L. Stein_).\r\n\r\n  185 The difference between the broader and narrower sense of production,\r\n      corresponds essentially with that of gross and net income (§ 145).\r\n      Compare also §§ 206, 211 ff.\r\n\r\n_  186 Von Mangoldt_ distinguishes the coming into existence of free\r\n      values of the production undertaken for an economic purpose.\r\n      (Grundriss, 9.)\r\n\r\n_  187 Gioja_, Nuovo Prospetto delle Scienze economiche (1815), I, 49 ff.\r\n      Besides positive production, there is a latent production, which\r\n      prevents the decay of goods. It is not possible to make as exact an\r\n      estimate of the latter as of the former; and much more depends in\r\n      the latter case than in the former on continuity and proper\r\n      extension. Hence, latent production is especially a state concern.\r\n      (_Knies_, Telegraph als Verkehrsmittel, 1857, 232.)\r\n\r\n  188 See _Schäffle_, in the Tübinger Univ. Programm, September 27, 1862,\r\n      on the disastrous effect on the community of idleness. The leading\r\n      of a happy life the Greeks called very appropriately, εὐπράττειν\r\n      (_Garve_).\r\n\r\n  189 We use the expression “external nature” through the whole of this\r\n      work in contradistinction not only to the soul, but also to man’s\r\n      body, designating his entire physico-intellectual activity by the\r\n      term “labor-force” (_Arbeits kraft_).\r\n\r\n  190 By the expression “natural forces,” we designate the economically\r\n      useful changes of matter, changes of place as well as of\r\n      composition, which are made without man’s cooperation; for instance,\r\n      the gigantic machinery which supplies the greater part of mankind\r\n      with water to drink, for domestic and other purposes—the evaporation\r\n      of the sea, the formation of clouds, rain, springs, rivers etc. See\r\n      _Bastiat_, Harmonies, 277. Thus the sun’s rays are indirectly the\r\n      cause, not only of vegetation, but also of all wind and steam\r\n      forces.\r\n\r\n  191 Spite of this “freedom,” it may well happen that these gifts of\r\n      nature can be utilized, in many cases, only on condition of some\r\n      expenditure. The photographer can compel the sunlight to work for\r\n      him only by means of a camera obscura, and the smithy the\r\n      atmosphere, only by means of a bellows. But neither will ever\r\n      successfully make an item, in their accounts with their customers,\r\n      of the services of the sun or air.\r\n\r\n  192 The most important ocean currents may be explained by two causes:\r\n      the flowing of the water from the polar seas to the equator (polar\r\n      current), and the revolution of the earth about its axis\r\n      (equinoctial current); besides which, there are the reflex currents\r\n      produced by the horizontal form of the coast-lands. Thanks to these\r\n      natural ocean highways, England is nearer to almost all the\r\n      important mercantile coasts of the world by 300 geographical miles\r\n      than the Eastern States of the American Union. The only exception is\r\n      the Atlantic coast of America north of the Equator. North Americans\r\n      to pass the line, or to double one of the two great capes, are\r\n      obliged first to traverse the ocean as far as the Azores. On the\r\n      other hand, the western coast of South America is very widely\r\n      separated from Mexico, for instance, by its ocean currents. The\r\n      colonization of America by Europe, instead of by China, is a\r\n      consequence of the direction of ocean currents, as is also the fact\r\n      that America has now the fairest prospect of influencing the\r\n      civilization of China and Japan. What an influence the warm gulf\r\n      stream has on the mild climate of north-western Europe!\r\n\r\n  193 While the Mississippi has no ebb or flow whatever, the influence of\r\n      the ocean is felt in the Hudson, which is 60 geographical miles\r\n      long, a distance of 29 miles from its mouth.\r\n\r\n  194 Thus, _A. Young_, Travels in France I, 293 ff., has defined, with\r\n      approximate accuracy, the limits within which the vine, maize and\r\n      the olive grow. And so _von Cancrin_, Dorpater Jahrbuch IV, 1,\r\n      distinguishes the ice zone, the reindeer-moss (a lichen on which the\r\n      reindeer live in winter) zone, the forest zone, the zone within the\r\n      limits of which cattle are raised; that in which the culture of rye\r\n      begins, that in which it becomes permanent; the wheat, fruit-tree,\r\n      vine, maize, olive, sugar cane and silk-worm zones. The United\r\n      States are divided into cattle-raising, wheat-raising,\r\n      cotton-raising, rice-raising and sugar-raising zones. Even in\r\n      Europe, beyond the 60th parallel of north latitude, wheat can\r\n      scarcely be cultivated; the polar limits of rye raising extend, at\r\n      most, six or seven degrees farther. Towards the north, barley\r\n      extends sometimes as far as the 70th degree. Here agriculture almost\r\n      ceases, and the inhabitants are compelled to confine themselves to\r\n      animal substances for food. On the other hand, these three cereals\r\n      are not adapted to a tropical climate, while the bread-fruit tree,\r\n      for instance, does not thrive at more than 22 degrees from the\r\n      Equator, nor the banana at more than 35. Compare _Grisebach_, Die\r\n      Vegetation der Erde nach ihrer klimatischen Anordnung. II, 1871.\r\n\r\n  195 Thus rye and wheat thrive in many parts of Siberia (Iakutzk) at an\r\n      annual temperature of - 7.50, while in Iceland no cereals ripen at\r\n      an annual temperature of + 4°. But in the former place the summer\r\n      heat is + 16.2°; the winter cold, - 39.2°; in Iceland, + 12° and -\r\n      1.6°. In England, the myrtle, laurel, camelia and fuchsia stand the\r\n      winter well; while the vine no where ripens. On the other hand,\r\n      Astrakan and Hungary are vine growing countries, although the former\r\n      is as cold in winter as North Cape, and although the cold is more\r\n      intense in Hungary than in the Faroe Islands, where neither the oak\r\n      nor the beech grow any longer. No good wine is produced on the\r\n      western coast of France, north of 47° 20’ north latitude; in\r\n      Champagne, north of 49°, or in the Rheingau, north of 51°. In\r\n      Norway, the average heat is greater on the coast than in the heart\r\n      of the country where, however, grain ripens, while it does not on\r\n      the coast; for the mildness of the winter, no matter how great, can\r\n      make no compensation for the want of heat. On the other hand, the\r\n      cattle on the coast can remain much longer out of doors, and the sea\r\n      seldom freezes in such a way as to interfere with the fisheries.\r\n      _Blom_, Norwegen I, 39. _Boussingnault_ (Economie rurale considérée\r\n      dans ses Rapports avec la Chimie, II) has made some interesting\r\n      attempts to calculate by a mathematical process the amount of heat\r\n      necessary to vegetable, during the period of vegetation. Thus, for\r\n      instance, wheat requires about 12° (Réaumur) of heat during 140\r\n      days; that is, nearly 140 x 12° = 1680° Réaumur. In Venezuela, the\r\n      sugar cane requires a longer time to grow in a higher and therefore\r\n      cooler position than in a lower and warmer, and the length of time\r\n      required is in proportion to the height.\r\n\r\n  196 Hence it is that the isothermal lines are not parallel with the\r\n      equator or with one another. The greater number of these have two\r\n      northern and two southern summits; the former on the western coasts\r\n      of Europe and America, and the latter in eastern North America, and\r\n      in the interior of Asia.\r\n\r\n  197 The quantity of rain which falls every year is, at St. Petersburg\r\n      and Pesth, from 16 to 17 inches; at Berlin 19, Mannheim 21, Tübingen\r\n      26: in the interior of France 16-24; on the French coast 25, on the\r\n      eastern coast of England 24, on the western coast 35, in Milan 36,\r\n      Genoa 44, on the coast of most tropical lands 70-120. On the\r\n      political-economical influences of most climates, see _Gobbi_, Ueber\r\n      die Abhängikeit der Populationskräfte von den einfachen\r\n      Grundfstoffen, 1842.\r\n\r\n  198 The snow limit at Mageröe in Norway is 2,200, in Iceland 2,900, in\r\n      the northern Ural 4,500, in the Alps 8,200, in the Caucasus 10,400,\r\n      and Quito 14,850 feet high. Hence it is that mountainous countries\r\n      which produce nothing in the north, make magnificent vineyards in\r\n      warmer countries.\r\n\r\n  199 In central Germany, even a second crop can be produced after the\r\n      corn harvest. In Arabia, the same seed produces three harvests,\r\n      because the grain which falls at the time of harvesting to the\r\n      ground, germinates immediately and suffices for new seed.\r\n      (_Niebuhr_, Beschreibung, 154.)\r\n\r\n  200 Thus in the northern states of the American union, wheat yields a\r\n      return of only from four to five times the amount sown; in France,\r\n      5-6 times (_Lavoisier_): in Chili, 12 times; in northern Mexico, 17\r\n      times; in Peru, 18 and 20 times; in southern Mexico, 25 and even 35\r\n      times; in Germany, maize seed yields at best one hundred fold, while\r\n      in the torrid zone there is a return of from three hundred to four\r\n      hundred fold, generally.\r\n\r\n  201 Andalusian corn produces in the mill only one-half as much\r\n      bran-waste as Baltic wheat produces. _Bourgoing_, Tableau de\r\n      l’Espagne, II, 155. Baltic wheat contains 6-7 per cent, of azote,\r\n      and Algerian, 20-25 Per cent. (_Kabsch_, Pflanzenleben der Erde,\r\n      1865.)\r\n\r\n  202 In Europe the blossoming season is retarded four days for each\r\n      degree of northern latitude. (_Schübler_.) As we advance towards the\r\n      north, the difference becomes less noticeable, but more so as we go\r\n      towards the south. In mountainous countries a similar difference is\r\n      observable, produced by a like climatic influence. It is from about\r\n      10 to 12 days, for a height of from 500 to 600 feet. (_Wolff_,\r\n      Naturgesetzliche Grundlagen des Ackerbaues I, p. 332 ff.) In the\r\n      cantons, in which the Swiss confederation had its origin, the\r\n      pasturage of the Alps lasts generally thirteen weeks, but in the\r\n      higher Alps it lasts only from six to seven weeks. (_Businger_, C.\r\n      Unterwalden., p. 52.)\r\n\r\n  203 In central Italy, winter wheat may be sown in October, November or\r\n      December; summer wheat, in February or March. (_Sismondi_, Tableau\r\n      de l’Agriculture Toscane, p. 35.) In Judæa, it was possible to\r\n      harvest figs ten months in the year. (_Joseph_, Bell. Jud., Ill, p.\r\n      10.) On the other hand, there is Jemtland, where the peasant in many\r\n      places surrounds the northern portion of his cornfield with fagots,\r\n      and lights them in August when the north wind blows, to protect his\r\n      land from the frost; and where the expression “green years” is used\r\n      to designate those in which the harvest has to be reaped before it\r\n      is ripe. (_Forsell_, Statistik von Schweden, 24.) In the valuation\r\n      made of the lands of the kingdom of Saxony, for assessment purposes,\r\n      the cost of supporting a yoke of oxen in the lowest country is\r\n      estimated at only three-fourths of what it is in the highest\r\n      localities, because in the former, 200 work days can be calculated\r\n      upon in the year, in the latter only 159. In central Russia, the\r\n      greater part of the labor of agriculture, sowing and harvesting, has\r\n      to be finished within the space of four months. In central Germany,\r\n      they are spread over seven months. Other things being equal, seven\r\n      horses and ploughmen are needed in Russia where only four are called\r\n      for in central Germany, (_von Haxthausen_, Studien I, 174.) On the\r\n      impediments put in the way of agriculture by the climate of eastern\r\n      Prussia, see _Meitzen_, Boden und landwirthsch. Verhältnisse des\r\n      preussichen Staats, 1868, I, Abschn., 6.\r\n\r\n  204 “In both hemispheres, the zone in which the temperature decreases\r\n      most rapidly lies between the 40th and 50th degrees of north\r\n      latitude. This circumstance must have a happy influence on the\r\n      culture and industry of the nation inhabiting the neighborhood of\r\n      that zone. Here is the point where the regions of the vine touch\r\n      upon those of the olive. Nowhere in the world, do the products of\r\n      the vegetable kingdom, and the most varied wonders of agriculture,\r\n      follow with such rapidity on one another. The great variety of\r\n      products enlivens the commerce and increases the industrial activity\r\n      of agricultural nations.” (_Humboldt_.) It is true, however, that\r\n      tropical countries possess, also, in their mountainous parts, the\r\n      _tierra fria_, _templada_ and _caliente_, superimposed the one on\r\n      the other.\r\n\r\n  205 The aggregate coal supply of Great Britain (1869) was 2,180 millions\r\n      cwt.; of Belgium (1862), 207 millions; of France (1868) 256\r\n      millions; of Prussia (1870), 600 millions, of Austria (1870),\r\n      including brown lignite coal, 158 millions; of Russia (1868), only a\r\n      little over 9 millions. The great English coal field, in the\r\n      counties of Durham and Northumberland, embraces 732 English square\r\n      miles; that of South Wales, 1,200, with a depth of 95 feet, so that\r\n      the geographical square mile contains here 679 millions of tons,\r\n      each of twenty cwt. To obtain the same quantity of combustible\r\n      material as was furnished to Prussia, in 1865, by its coal, it would\r\n      be necessary to use up 6,331 square miles of forest, (_von Dèchen_,\r\n      in _Engel’s_ Zeitschrift, 1867, 258.) The supply of coal is, of\r\n      course, exhaustible while, for instance, turf-fields replace\r\n      themselves by slow degrees. Compare _Griesbach_, über die Bildung\r\n      des Torfs, in the Göttinger Studien, 1845, vol. I. The importance of\r\n      the coal-fields of the United States, which are twenty-two times as\r\n      large as those of Great Britain, in the distant future, cannot be\r\n      over-estimated.\r\n\r\n  206 I need only call attention to the earth-fire (_Erdbrand_) for the\r\n      purpose of forcing the growth of garden plants in the neighborhood\r\n      of Zwickau, which is said to have existed since 1505.\r\n\r\n  207 Thus, in Watt’s steam engines of the larger kind, an hourly\r\n      consumption of ten pounds of coal is needed to produce a force\r\n      equivalent to that of one horse, while in the smallest machines of\r\n      only one horse power, twenty-two pounds are needed. See _Prechtl_,\r\n      Technolo. Encyklopädie, III, 669.\r\n\r\n  208 It is easy to see that it is the most important substances needed in\r\n      industry which are mentioned in this section. Many political\r\n      economists have considered the principal difference between\r\n      agriculture and the industries and economies of towns to lie in the\r\n      contrast here referred to. Thus, _A. Sena_, Sulle Cause che possono\r\n      far abbondare li Regni d’oro e d’argento, dove non sono miniere,\r\n      1613, I, 3. See the description of the difference between land and\r\n      machines in _Malthus_, Principles, III, 5; _Senior_, Outlines, 86.\r\n      But it is nothing more than a difference of gradation. Even in the\r\n      most active of businesses there is a limit which the accumulation of\r\n      means of production cannot pass without a relative diminution of the\r\n      income. This boundary is imposed by the limited nature of those\r\n      organic beings which must contribute to production either actively\r\n      or passively. Thus, for instance, a manufacturing establishment or\r\n      commercial business can be enlarged with advantage only so long as\r\n      it is still possible for one superintendent to conduct it. And so,\r\n      when cattle are furnished with very abundant and substantial food, a\r\n      pound of meat costs the producer a much higher price than when they\r\n      are more moderately supplied: sometimes in the ratio of 1.95:0.98.\r\n      _Boussingault_, Economie rurale, II. Where there is absolute\r\n      over-feeding, the producer must suffer loss. But, even inorganic\r\n      nature imposes its own limits here; as, for instance, when ships,\r\n      machines etc., on account of the insufficient strength of the\r\n      materials of which they are made, cannot be constructed beyond a\r\n      certain size. But all these limits are much narrower than those\r\n      imposed by the quality of immovability.\r\n\r\n_  209 Senior_, Outlines, 26, 81 ff. See _Stewart_, Principles, II, ch.\r\n      11; _Ortes_, E. N., I, 18, II, 18 ff. This most important principle\r\n      in Political Economy is thus illustrated by _John Stuart Mill_,\r\n      Principles, book I, ch. 12. “The limitation to production from the\r\n      properties of the soil is not like the obstacle opposed by a wall,\r\n      which stands immovable in one particular spot, and offers no\r\n      hindrance to motion short of stopping it entirely. We may rather\r\n      compare it to a highly elastic and extendible band, which is hardly\r\n      ever so violently stretched, that it could not possibly be stretched\r\n      any more, yet the pressure of which is felt long before the final\r\n      limit is reached, and felt more severely the nearer that limit is\r\n      approached.” This is, if possible, more obvious in building than in\r\n      agriculture, both as to the construction of new stories and the\r\n      excavation of deeper cellars.\r\n\r\n_  210 Ad. Mayer_, Das Düngerkapital und der Raubbau (Heidelberg, 1869),\r\n      sees the only conditions of production which man cannot increase at\r\n      will exclusively in the sun’s rays, the employment of which also\r\n      depends on the quantity of land. Thus would he explain _Senior’s_\r\n      law.\r\n\r\n  211 See the tables of increase in _Cotta_, Anweisung zum Waldbau, p.\r\n      228. _Count Buquoy_, Theorie der N. Wirthschaft, p. 54, ridicules\r\n      the absurd procedure of a great many farmers, as if by forcing the\r\n      ploughshare deeper into the soil, they could compel it to produce a\r\n      double return, and asks: if one should dig a square foot of land to\r\n      the center of the earth and manure it, who would take it off his\r\n      hands? As to the effect of manure, _Kuhlmann’s_ investigations have\r\n      shown that 300 kilogrammes of guano produced in three years an\r\n      increase per _hectare_ in the yield, of 2,469 kilogrammes of hay;\r\n      while 600 kilogrammes produced an increase of only 2,870\r\n      kilogrammes. _Schübler_, found that where salt had been used for\r\n      manuring purposes, 40 kilogrammes produced a maximum of fertility\r\n      from which point forward every increase in the amount of salt was\r\n      attended by diminished returns, and finally led to complete\r\n      barrenness. See _Wolff_, Naturgesetzliche Grundlagen, I, 408, 412,\r\n      502. Constantly increased irrigation would convert the land into a\r\n      swamp instead of indefinitely adding to its fertility. Nor can\r\n      abundant sowing be of any use when it reaches such a point that the\r\n      plants stand so closely together as to interfere with their proper\r\n      development.\r\n\r\n  212 These differences correspond with the differences in the kinds of\r\n      deterioration to which land is liable from rivers, floods, lava,\r\n      etc., soil-exhaustion, and the growing wild of the land.\r\n\r\n  213 From a technic point of view, it would, perhaps, be practicable, in\r\n      most instances, to obtain the phosphoric acid immediately from the\r\n      land and transfer it to other land; but the relation of the cost to\r\n      the result makes it impossible from an economical point of view.\r\n\r\n  214 It most certainly is always an uncommon advantage that certain kinds\r\n      of soil, rich in kali and decayed vegetable matter, yield a long\r\n      series of harvests without the addition of manure, provided, always,\r\n      that a short interval is allowed to the process of decay to replace\r\n      the exhausted plant-food. Thus in many volcanic regions. Compare on\r\n      similar districts in the Deccan: _Rilter_, Erdkunde, V, 714.\r\n\r\n  215 According to _Schübler_, the absorption of water by 100 parts of\r\n      earth is, in the case of quartz-sand, 25 per cent. of its weight;\r\n      for clay, 70 per cent.; for calcareous earth, 85 per cent.; humus,\r\n      190 per cent.; and for 100 parts of their value, respectively, 37.9,\r\n      66.2, and 69.2 per cent. The consistency of the four kinds of earth,\r\n      in a dry state, is in the proportion of 0.100, 5, 8.7; their\r\n      adhesion in a moist state, to iron agricultural implements, is in\r\n      that of 0.17, 1.12, 0.65, 0.40. Of 100 parts of water mixed with\r\n      these kinds of earth, the evaporation in four hours, at a\r\n      temperature of 18° 75’ (centigrade) is 88.4, 31.3, 28 and 20.5 per\r\n      cent, respectively. The diminution of volume when the moist earth\r\n      dries, under the same degree of temperature, is, 0, 18.3, 5 and 20.\r\n      Their relative absorption of atmospheric moisture for 48 hours is as\r\n      0, 24, 17.5 and 55; their absorption of oxygen in 30 days is\r\n      respectively 1.6, 15.3, 10.8 and 2.03 per cent.; and, lastly, their\r\n      heat-holding power is in the ratio of 95.6, 66.7, 61.8, 49.\r\n\r\n  216 In Austria, below the Enns, only 3.8 per cent. of the soil is\r\n      barren; in the Tyrol, 29 per cent.; in Dalmatia, 48.1 per cent.\r\n      (_Springer_). In the French Pyrenees, 43 per cent. is considered\r\n      incapable of cultivation; in the Alps, in Landes and Morbihan, 42\r\n      per cent.; in the departments of Nord and Somme, 1.3 per cent.\r\n      (_Schnitzler_). _Franscini_ considers 36 per cent. of Switzerland\r\n      unfit for tillage. The idea “barren” is a very vague one, and hence\r\n      a comparison of different countries on this point should not be made\r\n      without great caution.\r\n\r\n_  217 Wolff_, loc. cit., 353 ff. As to the manner in which soil and\r\n      climate mutually improve or injure one another, see _Schwerz_,\r\n      Prackt. Ackerbau I, 12.\r\n\r\n  218 In this respect, also, the fundamental difference between\r\n      agriculture and industry is very important, inasmuch as the products\r\n      of the former, equal in value to those of the latter, require a very\r\n      large supporting or bearing surface; those of industry, a very small\r\n      one. If _Nobbe’s_ “water-cultivation” should ever come to assume any\r\n      great practical importance, agriculture would approach to industry\r\n      in this respect.\r\n\r\n_  219 Wolkoff_ has called special attention to mere _emplacement_:\r\n      Lectures d’Economie polítique rationelle (1861), pp. 90 seq., 157\r\n      seq. _Bastiat’s_ rather broad and enthusiastic assertion, that no\r\n      mere product of nature possesses value (in contradistinction to\r\n      utility), an exaggeration of his very honorable contest with the\r\n      socialists (1848!), is refuted by daily experience, as when, for\r\n      instance, discoveries are made accidentally of metallic veins,\r\n      coal-fields etc., which immediately acquire great exchange value.\r\n\r\n_  220 Aristotle_ distinguishes between ἀπολαυστικὰ and κάρπιμα. (Rhet.,\r\n      I, 5.)\r\n\r\n_  221 Humboldt_, Essai politique, súr la N. Espagne, IV, 9, in which he\r\n      estimates the relation of the culture of the banana to that of\r\n      wheat, in respect of mere quantity, to be as 4,000 to 30,—“probably\r\n      the best gift of nature to awakening man, and the object of the most\r\n      ancient cultivation.”\r\n\r\n  222 It was said that in Easter Island, three days’ labor sufficed for a\r\n      man’s maintenance through the whole year. A similar gift of nature\r\n      to tropical lands is the date tree. It is turned to so many\r\n      different uses that the Arabs of the coast of the Persian Gulf say\r\n      that it is possible to construct a ship, rig it, supply and freight\r\n      it, from date trees. Houses are built of palm wood, covered with\r\n      palm leaves, furnished with palm mats, lighted with palm chips, and\r\n      heated with palm coals. The whole architecture of these countries is\r\n      fashioned by the date tree. Date wine is the favorite intoxicating\r\n      beverage. There is a proverb current there that a good housewife can\r\n      vary the preparation of the date for her guests every day in the\r\n      month. Even the pulp is eaten. Each tree yields an average of 50-250\r\n      lbs. of dates; and a tree may last over 200 years. An acre may\r\n      contain more than 200 trees. The labor of cultivation is very\r\n      slight, although it demands more care than the banana. Compare\r\n      _Ritter_, Erdkunde, XII, 763. An acre planted with the sago-palm\r\n      yields as much nourishment as 163 acres of wheat land. (Reise der\r\n      Frigatte Novara, II, 113.)\r\n\r\n  223 See _D. Hume_, Discourses No. I (On Commerce). While in hot\r\n      countries “the sun does more work for man, it diminishes human\r\n      strength itself.” (_M. Wirth_.) That, however, such people, to their\r\n      surplus of the natural means of enjoyment and the consequent\r\n      laziness and absence of care, add the bright side of a joyous\r\n      disposition, is well shown by _Goethe_, Werke (16 mo., 1840), XXIII,\r\n      246.\r\n\r\n  224 Noticed even by _Thucyd._, I, 2. See also _Euripides’_ comparison of\r\n      Sparta and Messina, in _Strabo_, VIII, 366.\r\n\r\n  225 We find, in a great many countries, that their northern portions are\r\n      endowed more sparingly by nature with means of enjoyment\r\n      (_Genussmitteln_) than southern portions, but more abundantly with\r\n      means of acquisition. (_Erwerbsmitteln_.) Hence, the former are\r\n      latest to develop; but once developed, they assume a much higher\r\n      place in civilization than the latter. This is true of Italy, Spain,\r\n      Portugal, France, the Netherlands, and the United States, and of\r\n      North America in general, as compared with South America. Something\r\n      similar may be seen in the contrast between Austria and Prussia. The\r\n      latter is colder and less fertile, but far superior to the former in\r\n      extent of coast, in rivers, and fossilized combustible matter.\r\n\r\n  226 The rule is not without its exceptions. Thus, for instance, Borneo\r\n      and New Guinea are physically very like each other, but zoölogically\r\n      two different worlds; the former belonging to India and the latter\r\n      to Australia.\r\n\r\n  227 Even language, which is the most general and most accurate\r\n      expression of the intellectual genius of a people, presents a\r\n      strikingly analogous contrast in mountainous and coast countries.\r\n      Thus, compare the Ionic, Latin, Low German, Danish and Portuguese,\r\n      with the Doric, Oscan, High German, Swedish and Spanish.\r\n\r\n  228 See _Strabo_, II, 126. seq.\r\n\r\n  229 The most striking instance, illustrative of the manner in which the\r\n      nature of a country influences the character of a people is afforded\r\n      by the difference in the development of the Aryans in India and\r\n      Persia, especially when their sojourn in the territory of the Indus\r\n      before that near the Ganges is looked upon as an intermediate stage.\r\n\r\n  230 French writers, especially, have exaggerated the influence of nature\r\n      over man.

Hence the Indians call the elephant, the\r\n      animal gifted with a hand. _Buffon’s_ view is exaggerated by\r\n      Helvetius in the interests of materialism. _Aristotle_, (De partt.\r\n      anim.

When nature’s\r\n      spontaneous gifts are exhausted, this _occupation_ readily becomes\r\n      _production_.\r\n\r\n_  238 Industrie voituriére_, according to _Dunoyer_; _industria\r\n      traslocatrice_ in opposition to _trasformatrice_, according to\r\n      _Scialoja_. _Ortes_ distinguishes only four classes: _agricoltori_,\r\n      _artefici_, _dispensatori_ and _administratori_, or _raccoglitori_,\r\n      _manifattori_, and _difensori di bene_ (E. N. I, 2; III, 14). _A.\r\n      Walker_, Science of Wealth (1867), p. 34, knows only three classes:\r\n      transmutation, transformation, transportation.\r\n\r\n  239 This is not to be understood in the sense, that there ever was a\r\n      period in which these sciences were unknown. We need only mention\r\n      the position occupied by the priest and knight in the middle ages.\r\n      But, looked upon as economic labor, intended only for purposes of\r\n      free commerce, they have become very important only within a\r\n      relatively recent period of time. Thus, for instance, there was in\r\n      Lower Austria, in 1866, one lawyer or notary to every 6,569\r\n      inhabitants; in Bohemia, to every 14,860; in Galicia, to every\r\n      22,361; in the whole of Cis-Leithanian Austria, 12,259. In 1865,\r\n      there was in Prussia, one to every 11,149; in Bavaria, to every\r\n      7,350; in Hanover, to every 4,946; in 1862, in Baden, one to every\r\n      4,992; in 1867, in Saxony, one to every 3,048. _Hildebrand’s_\r\n      Tagebuch, 1868, I, 234.

The verb “to plow” is, according to comparative philologists,\r\n      of more recent origin than “to weave.” (_Lassen_, Indische Alterth.\r\n      I, 814 ff.) And yet agriculture, in the sense above indicated,\r\n      undoubtedly precedes industry.\r\n\r\n  240 Observed by _Geiler v. Kaisersberg_. Compare _Schmoller_ in the\r\n      Tübinger Zeitschr., 1860, 483. Hour wages occupy a middle place\r\n      between day wages and piece wages.\r\n\r\n  241 Thus the introduction of piece wages into lower Silesia has\r\n      increased the daily earnings of workmen by one-third, one-half, and\r\n      even more. _Engel’s_ Stastist. Zeitschr. (1868), p. 327. The\r\n      investigations of the German agricultural congress on the condition\r\n      of agricultural laborers in the German empire (report of _v. d.\r\n      Goltz_, 1875) show that in all Germany on an average, the daily\r\n      earnings of a contract workman (_Accordlöhner_) is to the daily\r\n      summer wages of a day laborer as 15:10 (1420). On the other hand,\r\n      _Brassey_, in the construction of a railway, found that the same\r\n      workmen engaged in grading, digging, etc., cost 18 pence per yard\r\n      when paid by the day, and 7 pence when paid by the piece. (Work and\r\n      Wages, 266.) Swiss experience is, that production became 20 per\r\n      cent. cheaper under the piece wages system. (_Böhmert_, Beitr.,\r\n      109.)\r\n\r\n  242 According to _v. d. Goltz’s_ Enquête, the earnings of workmen by the\r\n      piece, compared with the wages paid workmen by the day in summer, is\r\n      especially high in middle Franconia (16.5:10); in the Leipzig circle\r\n      of the German empire (16.6), in the Braunschweig plain (16.8),\r\n      within the jurisdiction of Hildesheim (18.1), of the Bavarian\r\n      Palatinate (18.6), in Rhenish Hesse (23.2), especially low in\r\n      Stettin (13.2:10), in Stralsund (12.4), in Schleswig Holstein (12),\r\n      in Osnabrück, (11.7.)\r\n\r\n  243 According to _v. Flotow_, Anleitung zur Fertigung der\r\n      Ertragsanschlage, I, 80, four days of serf labor are equivalent to\r\n      only three of a free day laborer. According to _v. Jacob_, Ueber die\r\n      Arbeit Leibeigener und freier Bauern (1815), 21, two day laborers\r\n      are equal to three serfs, and one farm horse is equal to two\r\n      employed by serfs. It is as impossible to obtain accurate general\r\n      estimates here, as in the case of slave labor. As a rule, hope is\r\n      not only a more humane but a sharper spur to action. But if force is\r\n      employed at all, there is no doubt that the greater it is, the more\r\n      effectual it is. Wherever the right of corporal punishment has been\r\n      taken from the masters, the technic value of serfdom has uniformly\r\n      decreased. In the English West Indies, formerly, philanthropic\r\n      masters who treated their negroes with unwonted gentleness, obtained\r\n      from them, as a rule, very poor economic results. While each of the\r\n      slaves expressed the greatest indignation at the idleness of the\r\n      others when they had “so good a master,” they were all equally and\r\n      excessively lazy. The weekly production of a plantation sank rapidly\r\n      under this system from thirty-three hogsheads to twenty-three, and\r\n      finally to thirteen. _Math. Levis_, Journal of a West India\r\n      Proprietor, 1834; Edinburg Review, XLV, 410. For the same reason,\r\n      the negroes in the Spanish colonies, who were treated much more\r\n      gently than those owned by other European nationalities produced\r\n      much worse work. See, however, _Columella_, De Re rust., I, 8.\r\n\r\n  244 According to _Howlett_, The Insufficiency of the Causes to which the\r\n      Increase of our Poor Rate have been ascribed (1788), piece wages had\r\n      become usual “a few years ago.” Very recently the trades unions have\r\n      again restricted the system of piece wages (§ 176).\r\n\r\n  245 This system is inapplicable in the case of domestic servants\r\n      (_Gesinde_) who are a part of the household, and who afford to their\r\n      masters, besides their services, the advantage of having a person at\r\n      their disposal always about them, and whose wages are therefore in\r\n      great part their board and lodging. Still less can it apply to the\r\n      case of the family physician, whose services consist not simply in\r\n      writing prescriptions, but who is also the professional family\r\n      friend. The same may be said of the state official, clergyman etc.,\r\n      from whom it is demanded that he should sacrifice his entire life to\r\n      the service of the public. Against adopting piece wages in the case\r\n      of state officials, it may be further urged that no case at law, no\r\n      act of public life is precisely similar to any other. It cannot be\r\n      applied to that of soldiers, because they are called upon for action\r\n      only after a long term of peace, during all of which they must keep\r\n      themselves in readiness for war. (_Schäffle_, N. Œk., II, 388.) It\r\n      has also been the practice of courts, until recently, on account of\r\n      their dignity, to pay their mechanics not by the piece, wherever\r\n      that was practicable, but by a fixed salary. An able professor in a\r\n      university is of use to it not only by his lectures, but by his\r\n      reputation and example etc.; hence, here, a combination of piece\r\n      wages and of a regular salary is preferred. As to services, the\r\n      permanency of which constitutes their essential character,\r\n      remuneration is also wont to be permanent or hereditary, as in the\r\n      case of very many public officers, while civilization is as yet\r\n      unadvanced. Later, in proportion as the progress of civilization\r\n      makes itself felt, this hereditariness is wont to be confined to the\r\n      sovereign. For an opposite view, see _Boxhorn_, Institutt. politt.\r\n      (1663), 41.\r\n\r\n  246 Thus, the Chinese, who, by a ridiculous exaggeration bordering on\r\n      caricature of many of our recent tendencies, may afford us a warning\r\n      reflection of ourselves in our present state of civilization, rarely\r\n      labor efficiently when not watched. Only by means of piece wages or\r\n      the share-system can they be induced to do good work. _R. M.\r\n      Micking_; Recollections of Manilla and the Phillippine Islands,\r\n      1851.\r\n\r\n  247 Day laborers, for instance, must be watched over during the harvest,\r\n      to prevent their idling away their time, and piece-workers to\r\n      prevent their continuing to work in spite of wet weather, binding\r\n      sheaves, for instance, which causes the sheaves to rot. In England,\r\n      it is considered almost an impossibility to induce laborers to cut\r\n      wheat close enough to the soil. (_Sinclair_, Code of Agriculture,\r\n      102.) The haste of piece-workers, in the harvest of the rape,\r\n      occasions great loss, by the fall of the seed. In Russia the\r\n      removing of the hide from animals is paid for by the piece, and the\r\n      laborers injure a very large number of skins in their haste.\r\n      _Steinhaus_, Russlands industrielle und commercielle Verhältnisse,\r\n      425. Piece-wages are to be entirely discountenanced in the reeling\r\n      of silk. See _Bernouilli_, Technologie, II, 215. A yearly salary is\r\n      to be recommended in the tending of cattle, because here a certain\r\n      connection (_Anschluss_) with individuals is desirable. In building\r\n      trades, contractors in England prefer a regular salary; but they\r\n      employ model workmen, the so-called “bell horses,” to whom they pay\r\n      a large salary, and who keep the others on the strain by their\r\n      example, and who on that account are very much hated by their\r\n      colleagues.\r\n\r\n_  248 Adam Smith_, W. of Nations, I, ch. 8. _Howlett_, also, l. c.,\r\n      thinks that piece-wages increase the earnings of workmen, but at the\r\n      expense of their capacity for constant labor. _Count Görtz_, in his\r\n      Reise, 328, relates with what fatal effect piece-work in Demarara\r\n      tells on white laborers and their horses. After the February\r\n      Revolution, Parisian workmen demanded the abolition of piece-wages,\r\n      and obtained it in several manufactories. Revue des deux Mondes,\r\n      March 15, 1848.\r\n\r\n  249 In several Swiss factories, understrappers receive a salary, while\r\n      _monteurs_ work by groupe-contract. (_Böhmert_, Arbeiterverältnisse\r\n      und Fabrikeinrichtungen der Schw., II, 70.) Sub-contracting, where\r\n      the contract is generally made with only one person, for the most\r\n      part of more than average capacity, and this latter contracts with\r\n      other workmen on his own account entirely, is considered by\r\n      philanthropic employers of labor as one of the worst kinds of\r\n      remuneration. The more democratic system of gang-contract is much\r\n      better, although even here, it is very easy for the weaker members\r\n      of a good gang to overwork themselves. (Edinburg Review, October,\r\n      1873, 365.)\r\n\r\n  250 Especially important in chemical factories. The expense of greasing\r\n      on the Rhenish railways fell, through premiums offered as rewards\r\n      for saving, from 27,000 thalers to 5,000, in spite of an increase in\r\n      the amount of traffic. (_v. Mangoldt_, Volkswirthschaftslehre, 349.)\r\n      This was, besides, the most effectual way of controlling the theft\r\n      of material.\r\n\r\n  251 In the cachelot fishery, the captain receives one-sixteenth, the\r\n      master, one twenty-fifth, the second master, one thirty-fifth, the\r\n      boatswain, one-sixtieth, each sailor, one eighty-fifth of the\r\n      profit. (_Humboldt_, N. Espagne, IV, 10.) This system is very common\r\n      in North America. See _Carey_ in _J. S. Mill’s_ Principles, V, ch.\r\n      9, 7. In heathen Iceland, mariners were always paid a certain quota\r\n      of the profits. _Leo_, in _Raumer’s_ historischem Taschenbuch, 1835,\r\n      524. The same was often the case in China. _McCulloch_, Comm.\r\n      Diction. v. Canton. In England, its employment was rendered very\r\n      difficult by the laws of partnership, which made each individual,\r\n      except in great chartered societies, responsible for all kinds of\r\n      debts contracted by the rest of the firm. _J. S. Mill_, B. IV, ch.\r\n      7, 5.\r\n\r\n  252 The house painter Leclaire, in Paris, obtained very high results in\r\n      this respect. _Leclaire_, Répartition des Bénéfices du Travail,\r\n      1842. He retained for his own services as contractor the sum of\r\n      6,000 francs, and paid each workman the salary he had hitherto\r\n      received. What remained was, at the end of the year, equally divided\r\n      among all. _Leclaire_ assures us that he was always satisfied with\r\n      the system. The paying of a proportion of the general profits to\r\n      laborers is advisable only in case their ability of surveying the\r\n      whole is not much inferior to that of their employers. Where a\r\n      special proportion is paid, in special branches of business, it is\r\n      sufficient if their supervision extends over that particular branch.\r\n      But a sharing in the profits of business always supposes a\r\n      corresponding supervision of the business itself, and also the\r\n      keeping of accounts.\r\n\r\n  253 A very good remedy against indigence among the lower classes.\r\n      (_Umpfenbach_, National Œkonomie, 1867, 214.) But whether it will\r\n      ever be possible to make the remuneration of the navvy or that of a\r\n      type-setter depend on the final success of his work, _qnœre_.\r\n\r\n_  254 Tournefort_, speaking of the fatalism of the Turks, says that they\r\n      always and everywhere leave the world as they found it. According to\r\n      their own proverb, no grass grows again where the Osman has set\r\n      foot.\r\n\r\n  255 The experiments made with the dynamometer in 1800 ff. show that the\r\n      average _force manuelle_ of an inhabitant of Van Dieman’s Land is to\r\n      that of an inhabitant of New Holland, of Timor, of a French marine,\r\n      and of an English colonist in Australia, in the ratio of 50, 51, 58,\r\n      69, 71 kilogrammes. _Péron_, Voyage de Découverte aux Terres\r\n      australes, 2d ed., II, 417. It was found more recently in the\r\n      American army, that the average lifting-power of white soldiers was\r\n      314 to 343 -lbs.; of white marines, 307; students, 308; negroes,\r\n      323; mulattos, 348; and Indians, 419. _Gould_, Investigations in the\r\n      Military and Anthropolog.

According to English manufacturers, an English laborer\r\n      accomplishes almost as much again as a French one(?), and the latter\r\n      in turn more than an Irishman. An English contractor, who had worked\r\n      in French manufactories, expressed his opinion concerning the French\r\n      to this effect: “It cannot be called work they do; it is only\r\n      looking at it and wishing it done.” _Senior_, Outlines, 149. Thus,\r\n      for instance, a good English spinner with a machine of 800 spindles\r\n      could produce 66 lbs. of yarn, No. 40, while a Frenchman could\r\n      produce only 48 lbs. (_M. Mohl_, Reise durch Frankreich, 535;\r\n      compare _Dingler_, Polyt. Journal, I, 63 seq.) That the Americans\r\n      also are inferior to the English in strength and dexterity is\r\n      attested by the American _Hewitt_. See _Brentano_, Arbeitergilden,\r\n      II, 231. A Berlin wood-sawyer accomplished as much in ten days as a\r\n      West Prussian from Labiau in twenty-seven days. _J. G. Hoffmann._\r\n      English farmers on the Hellespont prefer to pay Greek laborers £10\r\n      per year “besides their keep,” rather than £3 to Turkish laborers.\r\n      (_Lord Carlisle_, Diary in Turkish and Greek Waters, 1854, p. 77\r\n      seq.) In Paulo-pinang, the Malayan agricultural laborer receives\r\n      $2-½ per month, the Malabar, $4, the Chinese, $6; for which\r\n      compensation they work respectively 26, 28 and 30 days. _Ritter_,\r\n      Erdkunde, v, 54.\r\n\r\n  256 Little light can be thrown on this subject by a comparison of\r\n      different countries. Thus, in France, there are 614 persons in every\r\n      1,000 examined fit for military service; in Bavaria, 705; in\r\n      Denmark, 523; in Austria, 498; in Prussia, 284; in Saxony, 259; in\r\n      England, where the conscription is from among the lowest classes,\r\n      665; and in Württemberg, 490. (_Wappäus_, Allg.\r\n      Bevölkerungsstatistik, II, 71, 140.) _Massy_, Remarks on the\r\n      Examination of Recruits, 1854. (_Memminger_, Würt. Jahrb., 1843,\r\n      103.) The comparison of different parts of the same state is much\r\n      more instructive. Thus, in Saxony, cities afford only 197, and the\r\n      flat country only 265 per 1,000 (Sächs. statist. Ztschr., 1856, No.\r\n      4 ff.); and in France there are among those of illegitimate birth a\r\n      very large number unfit for military service. (Journ. des Econ.,\r\n      1850, XXV, 69.) According to the Austrian Annual of military\r\n      statistics, there were in 1870, on an average, throughout the entire\r\n      monarchy, 211 per 1,000 of those liable to enter the ranks of the\r\n      military, fit for service; in the Innsbruck command, 325; in\r\n      Lemberg, 179.\r\n\r\n_  257 M. Chevalier_, Cours, I, 115. _Adam Smith_, B. I, ch. 8, noticed\r\n      the great industry of well paid workmen. Among the uneducated, labor\r\n      must almost necessarily be repulsive in proportion as it is illy\r\n      remunerated.\r\n\r\n  258 Thus _A. Young_ remarked that wages in Ireland are wretchedly low,\r\n      while labor is far from being cheap. In his “Evidence in Respect to\r\n      the Occupation of Land in Ireland,” II, 135, he says that a Scotch\r\n      day laborer at 1s. per day is cheaper than an Irish day laborer at\r\n      ½s. According to _McCulloch_, “Statis. Account of the British\r\n      Empire,” I, 666, industrial labor in Germany and France is dearer\r\n      than in England, because in the former countries there are, _ceteris\r\n      paribus_, twice as many laborers employed in most manufactures. See\r\n      _Senior_, Lectures on Wages, 1830, 11, and the reports of the\r\n      committees of parliament, _passim_ on French manufactures (1825).\r\n      The same has been experienced in the agricultural history of\r\n      Schleswig-Holstein. See _Hanssen_, Archiv. der Politisch. Œk. IV,\r\n      421. _La main d’œuvre est chère en Russie dès qu’il s’agit d’une\r\n      certaine capacité et d’un certain degré d’instruction\r\n      professionelle, tandis que celle de l’ouvrier ordinaire n’est nulle\r\n      part aussi bas._ (_Tégoborsky._)\r\n\r\n  259 Thus even _Columella_, R. R. I, 9. _J. S. Mill_, Principles, I, ch.\r\n      7, 5.\r\n\r\n  260 Thus, for instance, the Lex Visigoth., VIII, 4, 16, graduates the\r\n      fine to be paid by the murderer according to the age of his victim.\r\n      It increases up to the 20th year in the case of males, and\r\n      diminishes after the 50th. In the case of females, the maximum is\r\n      attained between the ages of 15 and 40. Similarly even _Moses_, Book\r\n      III, 27.\r\n\r\n  261 As to what concerns the two sexes, the _force rénale_ of adult males\r\n      is twice that of females in the human species. The difference\r\n      between them in youth is not so great. The force _manuelle_ of the\r\n      two sexes at the age of 30 is as 9:5. (_Quételet_, Sur l’Homme II,\r\n      p. 73 ff.) The numerical ratio of one sex to the other varies but\r\n      little among those nations which have attained a certain degree of\r\n      civilization. See _infra_, § 245.\r\n\r\n  262 It is of great importance to calculate here the number of days in\r\n      the year in which the laborer is compelled to be idle on account of\r\n      sickness. _Fenger_, (Quid faciant ætas annique tempus ad frequentiam\r\n      et diuturnitatem morborum, Hafniæ 1840), finds the following result:\r\n\r\n      Between 15 and 19 years, 7.2 days.  Between 35 and 39 years, 7.8\r\n      days.\r\n      Between 20 and 24 years, 10.3 days. Between 40 and 44 years, 8.3\r\n      days.\r\n      Between 25 and 29 years, 9.5 days. Between 45 and 49 years, 11.6\r\n      days.\r\n      Between 30 and 34 years, 7.6 days. Between 50 and 59 years, 14.1\r\n      days.\r\n\r\n      According to _Villermé_, in the Annales d’Hygiène, II,\r\n\r\n      At 60 years, 16 days. At 67 years, 42 days.\r\n      At 65 years, 31 days. At 70 years, 75 days.\r\n\r\n      The latter table is the result of a comparison made of the tables of\r\n      seventy Scotch mutual aid societies.

Until within a short time every possible meaning of the\r\n      word _capital_ was to be found in the dictionary of the French\r\n      Academy, its scientific politico-economical meaning alone excepted.\r\n      During the middle ages, the Latin _capitale_ was used to signify\r\n      both loaned money and cattle. (_Ducange_, s.v.) When culture was at\r\n      its highest in Greece, _Demosthenes_ entertained very good ideas of\r\n      the nature of capital which he sometimes calls ἀφορμὴ, sometimes\r\n      ἔρανος, the meaning of which he extends also to the incorporeal\r\n      capital of a good reputation. (Adv. Mid., 574; pro Phorm, 947.) The\r\n      same may be said of the Roman in conception of _peculium_. See\r\n      _Hildebrand’s_ Jahrbb., 1866, I. 338. On the beginnings of the\r\n      present idea of capital among the later schoolmen, see _Funck_,\r\n      Tübinger Ztschr., 1869, 149. The diary of _Lucas Rems_, 1491-1541\r\n      (ed. _Greiff_, 1861), calls commercial capital, in most instances,\r\n      the chief good (_Hauptgut_) p. 37; also _Cavedal_. The words money\r\n      and capital, interest and the price of money are now confounded in\r\n      daily life, as they were formerly by most writers. In the 17th\r\n      century, _Child_ and _Locke_ may be mentioned as instances. _Hobbes_\r\n      had some faint notion of the productive power of capital.

Young_,\r\n      Political Arithmetics (1774), 1, ch. 7. _Hume_, on the other hand,\r\n      Discourses (1752), No. 4 (on interest), shows, that the rate of\r\n      interest is dependent, not as _Locke_ supposed, on the abundance or\r\n      scarcity of money, but on the state of profit and on the relation\r\n      between the demand and supply of capital. Similarly, _J. Massie_, An\r\n      Essay on the governing Causes of the Rate of Interest (1750).\r\n      _Quesnay_, Dialogue sur le Commerce, 173 (ed. Daire), shows that he\r\n      had a very clear conception of the operation, and of the principal\r\n      component parts of capital. _Turgot_, Sur la Formation et la\r\n      Distribution des Richesses, § 14, 54-79, came very near the truth,\r\n      and yet missed it. He recognized the necessity of advances which, as\r\n      a rule, are the result of saving, in every case of production. He\r\n      also distinguishes in the product of the soil, besides the _produit\r\n      net_ and the _subsistance du laboureur_, the _profit_ of the latter.\r\n      He likewise points out a great number of differences between the\r\n      “price of money” considered in its relation to trade, and in its\r\n      relation to loans. He explains the interest on capital, as\r\n      _Schröder_, in his Schatz-und Rentkammer, 231, and _Benjamin\r\n      Franklin_, in his Inquiry into the Nature of a Paper Currency (1729)\r\n      had done before, by the fact that the owner of capital can purchase\r\n      a piece of land with his capital, and thus draw an income without\r\n      working. Money, he said, was indeed not productive, but neither was\r\n      any other thing that could be loaned or leased, with the exception\r\n      of land and cattle. _Adam Smith_ deserves the greatest credit for\r\n      his analysis of the idea of capital, although he opposes “capital”\r\n      to what the Germans call capital-in-use, the “stock for immediate\r\n      consumption.” When _Canard_, Principes d’Economie politique (1801)\r\n      and _J. B. Say_, Cours pratique, 1828, I, 285, included man’s power\r\n      of labor in capital, they took a retrograde step. “Labour is\r\n      Capital, primary and fundamental.” _Colton_, 275. Every grown-up\r\n      individual, says _McCulloch_, Principles, 1825, II, ch. 2, may be\r\n      looked upon as a machine which has cost several years of continued\r\n      care and a considerable sum for its construction. It is only another\r\n      side of this same perversity, when _McCulloch_ seeks to force the\r\n      results produced by animals and machines into the definition of\r\n      labor. _Schlozer_, Anfangsgründe (1805), I, 21, goes so far as to\r\n      call the soul, raw material, which receives productive power from\r\n      the labor of the teacher! For a calculation of the money value of\r\n      man in the different ages of life, see Statis. Journ. XVI, 43 ff.\r\n      See, on the other hand, _Malthus_, Definitions, ch. 7; and _Rossi_,\r\n      in the Journal des Economistes, VI, 113. Nor does the view of\r\n      _Ganilh_, Systèmes d’Economie politique (1809), I, 243; of _Ad.\r\n      Müller_, Concordia, 93 ff., 211; of _Hermann_, “Staatswirth”\r\n      Untersuchungen, No. 3; of _Dunoyer_, Liberté du Travail, L. VI; of\r\n      _Bastiat_, _Carey_ and others, who include pieces of land in\r\n      themselves under the head of capital, seem to be better founded.\r\n      _Hermann_ defines capital the durable basis of every utility\r\n      possessed of value in exchange. _Schäffle_ reckons land as nature\r\n      offers it to us, among _free_ goods. From the moment that labor and\r\n      capital are spent upon it, it becomes immovable capital, but he\r\n      concedes that it still preserves many essential points which\r\n      distinguish it from other capital. (N. Œk. Theorie der\r\n      ausschliessenden Absatzverhältnisse, 1867, 65 ff., 89 ff.) These\r\n      differences appear to me to be still more important than that which\r\n      land and capital have in common; especially as the historic\r\n      development of their relations proceeds for the most part in\r\n      opposite directions. Thus, for instance, as civilization advances,\r\n      land is wont to become dearer and capital cheaper. How difficult\r\n      would it be to introduce clearness into the ideas of _intensive_ and\r\n      _extensive_ agriculture, if land were accounted capital! And it is\r\n      not only always theoretically, but also very often, in practice,\r\n      possible to separate the value of a given piece of land from the\r\n      most durable capital-improvements (_Kapitalmeliorationen_) made on\r\n      it. It is only necessary to call to mind the area of buildings.\r\n\r\n_  270 Marx_ makes a very arbitrary assertion when he says that only the\r\n      capital operating in trade, and even only that operating in trade\r\n      where money is used as the instrument of exchange, can properly be\r\n      called capital; and that, therefore, the modern biography of capital\r\n      dates only from the 16th century, (Das Kapital I, 106 ff.)\r\n\r\n  271 See, on the other hand, _Wolkoff_, Lectures d’Economie politique\r\n      rationelle, 167.\r\n\r\n_  272 Hermann_ (II ed., 238 ff.) distinguishes especially _preparatory\r\n      contrivances_ auxiliary to labor, such as stationary structures\r\n      etc., vessels, tools, machines and instruments for measuring etc.\r\n\r\n  273 Thus, for instance, the plow and the gun are machines, the spade and\r\n      the blow-pipe are tools. A hammer may be considered as a hard,\r\n      insensible fist; the bellows as a pair of very strong and durable\r\n      lungs. Tongs take the place of fingers, just as a spoon does of the\r\n      empty hand, and the knife the place of the teeth. A great number of\r\n      machines, on the other hand, may be compared to a complete workman.\r\n      Thus, the action of the mill which grinds grain has very little\r\n      resemblance to the blowing of the wind or the running of the water,\r\n      whereas the rising and falling of the pestle in the small mortar for\r\n      throwing grenades corresponds to the motion of the arm. (_Rau_,\r\n      Lehrbuch I, § 125.) The infinite number of functions of which our\r\n      members are capable is related to their inability to attain alone\r\n      the greater number of their ends. Hence animals which require no\r\n      tools can undertake to achieve very few things. “Man is a\r\n      tool-making animal.” (_B. Franklin._)\r\n\r\n  274 This is seen most clearly in the history of the grinding of corn. In\r\n      the time of Moses, and even of Homer, there were only hand-mills,\r\n      and originally only mortars. Later, mills set in motion by\r\n      horse-power were employed. Shortly after Cicero’s time, mills driven\r\n      by water-power came into use. _Brunck_, Analecta, II, 119, Ep. 39.\r\n      Mills built on pontoons do not date farther back than the time of\r\n      Belisarius. Wind-mills have been known since the ninth century;\r\n      Dutch wind-mills, only since the middle of the 16th century. See\r\n      _Beckman_, Beiträge zur Geschichte der Erfindungen II, I ff.\r\n\r\n  275 Compare _Plato_, Polit., 280.\r\n\r\n  276 Thus, _Ganilh_, Théorie de l’Economie politique I, 133, calls the\r\n      knowledge, talents and probity of merchants, as well as their\r\n      reputation, valuable parts of their capital in trade. See, also,\r\n      _Möser_, Patriot. Ph. II, 26. See some happy observations on the\r\n      intellectual capital of nations, as consisting of “known and unknown\r\n      preparatory labor through their history,” in _Lotze_, Mikrokosomos\r\n      II, 353 seq.\r\n\r\n  277 Compare _Dietzel_, System der Staatsanleihen (1856), 71 ff. And,\r\n      earlier yet, _Ad. Müller_ had looked upon taxes not in the light of\r\n      an insurance premium, but as “the interest of the invisible and yet\r\n      absolutely necessary intellectual capital of the nation.” (Elemente,\r\n      III, 75.) Of course, the State is much more than a species of\r\n      capital; just as a Gothic cathedral is something more than a piece\r\n      of masonry, but does not on that account cease to be a piece of\r\n      masonry.\r\n\r\n_  278 J. B. Say_, Traité d’Economie Politique I, ch. 10. Only think of\r\n      what is known in physiology as the change or transformation of\r\n      matter (_Stoffwechsel!_).\r\n\r\n  279 Productive capital has been rendered into German by the word\r\n      _Erwerbstamm_, by the author of “Staatswirthschaft nach\r\n      Naturgesetzen,” 1819. _Malthus_, Definitions, ch. 10, and _Rau_,\r\n      Lehrbuch, I, § 51, call productive capital alone, capital. According\r\n      to _M. Chevalier_, goods lose their quality of capital as soon as\r\n      they come into the hands of a consumer. _Schäffle_, N. Œk., II,\r\n      aufl., 59, calls capital in use _Genussvermögen_ (resources intended\r\n      for enjoyment) and productive capital, _Kapitalvermögen_\r\n      (capital-resources). On the other hand, _J. B. Say_, Traité, I, 13;\r\n      _McCulloch_, Principles, II, 2, 3, _Hermann_, Staatswirthschaft.\r\n      Untersuchungen, p. 60 ff., and _v. Mangoldt_,\r\n      Volkswirthschaftslehre, 122, divide capital into capital in use and\r\n      productive capital, according as it provides the possessor with that\r\n      which he may turn to account directly or indirectly by becoming the\r\n      owner of goods through its means. _Aristotle_ distinguishes between\r\n      ὄργανα and κτήματα, the former relating to ποίησις; for instance, a\r\n      shuttle; the latter to πράξις, as, for instance, bedding and\r\n      articles of dress. (Polit., I, 2, 5.)\r\n\r\n  280 Thus, for instance, class A embraces parks and forests; B, theaters,\r\n      churches, manufactories, arsenals, granaries, public walks and\r\n      roads. Walks can, besides, be used for the cultivation of fruit, and\r\n      roads for pleasure trips.\r\n\r\n  281 Translated “capital de consommation” by Wolowski, p. 96 of his\r\n      Roscher’s Principles.—_Translator’s note._\r\n\r\n  282 Dead, or better, dormant capital is such productive capital as, for\r\n      the time being, remains unused, and which, therefore, does not yield\r\n      even personal enjoyment. The sum total of this kind of capital is\r\n      very much diminished by the agency of savings banks. Loaned capital\r\n      which has been employed unproductively evidently constitutes no\r\n      longer a part of the wealth of a people. See _infra_, § 189.\r\n\r\n_  283 Wolkoff_ is so far right, when in his Lectures, p. 142, he calls\r\n      the return of capital in use not _revenu_, but _déstruction\r\n      graduelle_. _Schäffle_ is right, too, and entirely so, when he says\r\n      that only such an increase of the property, intended for enjoyment\r\n      simply, is anti-economic, as does not make the personal capacities\r\n      of labor (_Arbeitsvermögen_) as much more productive than they would\r\n      otherwise be.

In the patriarchal age of\r\n      the Jews, there was a relatively very large quantity of ornamental\r\n      objects in gold and silver: _Michælis_, De Pretiis Rerum apud\r\n      Hebræos, in the Comm. Soc. Götting., III, 151 ff., 160. Conservative\r\n      Sparta, in the middle age of its history, was certainly not rich,\r\n      and yet it had more gold and silver than any other Grecian state:\r\n      _Plato_, Alcib., I, 123. According to _St. John_, The Hellenes, III,\r\n      142, the ancients had relatively much more of the precious metals in\r\n      the form of objects for ornament than the moderns. The Romans, with\r\n      their usual good sense, did not make use of silver as an article of\r\n      luxury until they had attained great wealth. See _Cato_, R. R., ch.\r\n      23, and _Seneca_, De Vita beata, ch. 21. Then the Carthaginian\r\n      ambassadors railed at their hosts because they found the same pieces\r\n      of table silver in all the houses to which they were invited. The\r\n      younger Scipio, even, did not possess more relatively than 32 pounds\r\n      of silver ware. _Mommsen_, Römische Geschichte, II, 383. The\r\n      relatively great importance of the stores for domestic use,\r\n      nevertheless, runs through the whole of Roman history. The title _de\r\n      penu legato_, in the Pandects (Digest, XXIII, 9), points to this,\r\n      during the reign of the emperors, and in earlier times, the\r\n      derivation of _penates_ from _penu_. See _Rodbertus_, in\r\n      _Hildebrand’s_ Jahrbuch, 1870, I, 365. Immense importance of the\r\n      ring in the old north countries: _Weinhold_, Altnord.

According to _Giustiniani_, cardinal Wolsey owned articles of\r\n      silver to the value of 1,500,000 ducats, and the greater number of\r\n      the lords of the time were equally well provided with them.\r\n\r\n  286 The Bedouins are fond of decorating their wives and children with\r\n      all the jewels that they possess, both on holidays and other days,\r\n      so that they sometimes have four or six bracelets on each arm and\r\n      fifteen ear-rings in each ear. _Burckhardt_, Bemerkungen, 188.\r\n      _Wellsted_ (Roederer’s translation), I, 224.

In East India\r\n      even the most wretched towns have their silver workers. The emirs of\r\n      Scinde, with an annual income of £300,000, had a treasure worth\r\n      £20,000,000, nearly £7,000,000 of which were in jewels. _Ritter_,\r\n      Erdkunde VII, p. 185. On the upper Ganges more jewels and other\r\n      ornaments are worn than on the lower, where the wealthy prefer to\r\n      spend their capital on landed estates. _Ritter_, VI, 1143.\r\n\r\n  287 The first beginnings of this division are to be found in _Quesnay_\r\n      (Analyse du Tableau économique, 1758), in which he develops the\r\n      difference between _avances primitives_ and _avances annuelles_. See\r\n      also _Adam Smith_, W. of N., II, ch. 1, who, however, reduces the\r\n      difference between them mainly to the relations of possession, and\r\n      hence includes grain and seed in fixed capital. _Hermann_, Staatsw.\r\n      Untersuch., 269 ff.; _Ricardo_, Principles, ch. 1, sec. 2;\r\n      _Schmitt-henner_, Staatswissenschaften, I, 387, divides capital into\r\n      I, _infungible_, that is, 1, fixed in the strict sense of the word;\r\n      2, transportation-capital; II, _fungible_, 1, transformable capital;\r\n      a, material (raw material, auxiliary material etc.), b, formed\r\n      products; 2, circulating capital; a, wares; b, money. _A. Walker_,\r\n      S. of W., 57, calls circulating capital that which may be easily\r\n      transferred from one branch of production to another; fixed, that\r\n      which can be used with advantage only for the purpose for which it\r\n      was originally intended.\r\n\r\n  288 Old wood-work is burned; old iron utensils sold; also houses when\r\n      pulled down. _Emminghaus_, Allg.

In any\r\n      case, the production would be proportioned only to the borrowed\r\n      seed, cattle, etc. (_Sismondi_, Richesses commerciale, 1803, I, p.\r\n      61.)\r\n\r\n  290 That the Athenians left everything in the lurch to oppose Xerxes,\r\n      much more readily than under Pericles, even, the flat country of\r\n      Attica. _Büchsenschütz_ (Besitz und Erwerb im griech. Alterthum,\r\n      589) explains by the fact that in the interval between the two\r\n      periods, fixed capital increased largely. In rude ages under the\r\n      appellation of a community or nation was understood a number of men;\r\n      and the state, while its members remained, was accounted entire.\r\n      With polished and mercantile states, the case is sometimes reverted.\r\n      The nation is a territory cultivated and improved by its owners;\r\n      destroy the possession even while the master remains, the state is\r\n      undone. _Ferguson_, Hist. of civil Society, V, 4; _v. Mangoldt_,\r\n      Volkswirthschaftslehre, 159. Fixed capital is not so sure of being\r\n      completely used up as circulating. On this point see _Schäffle_, N.\r\n      Œk., 53.\r\n\r\n  291 If the aggregate productive activity of man be designated by the\r\n      word labor (just as everything produced on a piece of land is\r\n      inaccurately called its product), then all capital may be considered\r\n      as the unconsumed result of labor. The recent socialistic theory\r\n      that considers capital as the wages which have been earned but not\r\n      paid, is a gross misconception of this truth. This is the origin\r\n      only of the capital of oppressors and deceivers, and of theirs only\r\n      in part. See _infra_, § 189.\r\n\r\n  292 “While we are clothed in our winter garments, the spring stuffs are\r\n      already in the shops of retail dealers; the light material of next\r\n      summer’s wear is already manufacturing, and the wool for our next\r\n      winter’s clothing spun.” Think of the study in advance which the\r\n      physician must have gone through, whom we summon to us at a moment’s\r\n      notice! _Menger_, Grundsätze, I, § 33. seq.\r\n\r\n  293 Thus in dangerous callings, as for instance, among soldiers and\r\n      sailors, there is very little saving. The same may be said of times\r\n      of plague. See _J. Rae_, New Principles on the Subject of Political\r\n      Economy, 1834.\r\n\r\n  294 That we keep our property under lock and key, while it was customary\r\n      in Plato’s time to seal it up, is in itself a great advance.

This is in part related to his confounding land with capital\r\n      (103 seq.). On the other hand, _P. L._ (_v. Lilienfeld_), Gedanken\r\n      über die Staatswissenschaft der Zukunft (1873), distinguishes\r\n      between the external and internal creation of capital in human\r\n      society; the latter based on the condition of every organic being,\r\n      by virtue of which the present is generated by the past, and\r\n      generates the future. The intercellular substance of plants, the\r\n      honey-comb of bees, and the blood in the animal body, correspond to\r\n      the capital of a nation.\r\n\r\n_  298 Hermann_, St. Untersuchungen, 289 ff.; _List_, System der\r\n      politischen Œkonomie, I, 325 ff. Thus, for instance, capitalization\r\n      among a race of hunters may be continued longest by the creation of\r\n      herds; that of a race of shepherds by the building of houses, and by\r\n      land-improvements; that of an agricultural people by the\r\n      establishment of trades, artificial roads, etc. As to how, in\r\n      general the accumulation of goods to any great extent, supposes\r\n      exchange, and as to how, first of all, with exchange through the\r\n      existence of a superabundance wealth may originate, see _Hermann_,\r\n      loc. cit., II, Aufl., 25 ff.\r\n\r\n  299 The annual increase of the capital of France during the later years\r\n      of Louis Philippe’s reign, was estimated at from 200 to 300 million\r\n      of francs; during the best years of Napoleon III’s reign, at 600\r\n      million.

A war carried on on English soil would\r\n      doubtless be more destructive of capital than one waged in Russia;\r\n      but Russia would recover from one like that of 1854-55 with much\r\n      greater difficulty because of the small tendency of its people to\r\n      amass capital. In countries in which the middle classes\r\n      preponderate, the influence of the amassing of capital on foreign\r\n      politics is one that favors peace. In despotic or democratic\r\n      countries, it may as readily favor war.\r\n\r\n  300 The “absolute formation” of capital above described is, of course,\r\n      the only one in the general economy of mankind. In the economy of\r\n      individuals, we frequently meet with another which is only\r\n      “relative,” as when the increase of one’s resources is attended by\r\n      as great or even greater decrease of another’s. This is the case,\r\n      for instance, where privileges or monopolies are granted. The same\r\n      phenomenon is found also in the intercourse of economies of\r\n      different nations. _Supra_, § 64.\r\n\r\n  301 Thus _Cicero_, De Off., II, 3, 4. Nature may indeed produce mere\r\n      value in use without the coöperation of labor, in the narrow sense\r\n      of the word; as, for instance, a forest which protects a district\r\n      from avalanches etc. But “everything which has been transformed into\r\n      goods tends constantly to return to its natural state, and to\r\n      withdraw itself from the life of goods.” _Stein_, Lehrbuch.\r\n\r\n  302 Compare _List_, System der Polit. Œkon. But see also the very fine\r\n      discussion of _J. S. Mill_, Principles, IV, ch. VI, 2, on the\r\n      dreariness of nature, when taken exclusive possession of by man;\r\n      “with every rood of land brought into cultivation which is capable\r\n      of growing food for human beings; every flowery waste or natural\r\n      pasture plowed up; all quadrupeds or birds which are not\r\n      domesticated for man’s use, exterminated as his rivals for food;\r\n      every hedgerow or superfluous tree rooted out, and scarcely a place\r\n      left where a wild shrub or flower could grow, without being\r\n      eradicated as a weed, in the name of improved agriculture.”\r\n\r\n  303 In Paris, in 1820, the necessary tools of a rag-gatherer cost 6-¼\r\n      francs. _Garnier_, Elements d’Econ.-polit., 43.\r\n\r\n  304 It is not to be overlooked that all labor expended for a distant end\r\n      also falls under the head of capital. See _Droz_, Economie\r\n      politique, 1829, I, 6.\r\n\r\n  305 For a good exposition as to how England has need of more\r\n      agricultural products, the East Indies of more capital, and the West\r\n      Indies of more labor, see _Fawcett_, Manual of P. E., 110.\r\n\r\n  306 It is a very significant fact, that, at present, in certain European\r\n      countries, in Germany for instance, the laborer is called a _taker_,\r\n      and the capitalist a _giver_ of work. The expressions employed by\r\n      _Canard_, _Say_ and _Hermann_, teach a similar lesson.\r\n\r\n_  307 Schäffle_, Kapitalismus und Socialismus, 124 seq.\r\n\r\n  308 It is evident, that, absolutely considered, the predominating factor\r\n      of an earlier period may continue to increase during the following:\r\n      and, as a rule, it does continue to increase.\r\n\r\n  309 I need cite only the instance of the slaves, who called out the\r\n      hours, thus performing the functions of a clock: _Martial_, VIII.\r\n      67; _Juvenal_, X. 216; _Petron._ 26; of the turning of water wheels,\r\n      in Egypt and Babylon, by human hands. _Strabo_, XVI. 738, XVII.,\r\n      807. Among the ancients, it required one shepherd, and shepherd boys\r\n      besides, to take care of twenty sheep. (_Geopon._ XVIII, 1.) In\r\n      highly cultivated regions, the number ran up to fifty. (_Demosth._,\r\n      adv. Euerg. et Mnes., 1155.) It seldom passed eighty (_Varro_, De re\r\n      rust., II. 10, 10. 2, 20), or one hundred (_Cato_, R.R. c. 10);\r\n      while, recently, five men are sufficient to take care of eighteen\r\n      hundred sheep. See _Roscher’s_ discourse on the relation of\r\n      Political Economy to classical antiquity, in the reports of the\r\n      Royal Saxon Science Association, May, 1849. Also _D. Hume_,\r\n      Discourses, No. 10.\r\n\r\n  310 The productive power of each of the factors of production has been\r\n      over-estimated by some schools. After _Gratian_ (c. i, C. XIII. qu.\r\n      i), had clearly recognized the necessary coöperation of the three\r\n      elements, there was in the one-sidedness with which the Reformers\r\n      emphasized God’s blessing as the only source of wealth, a great\r\n      over-estimation of the factor nature. The Mercantile System\r\n      over-estimated the factor capital, in one of its most obvious\r\n      component parts, money. In later times again: “_La terre est la\r\n      source ou la matière d’où l’on tire la ichesse; le travail de\r\n      l’homme est la forme qui la produit. Tous les hommes d’un état\r\n      subsistent et s’enrichissent aux dépens des propriétaires des\r\n      terres._” (_Cantillon_, Sur la Nature du Commerce, 1755, I. 33, 55.)\r\n      _La terre est l’unique source des richesses._ (_Quesnay_, Maximes\r\n      générales de Gouvernement, 1758, ch. 3.) In another place, indeed,\r\n      the same writer says: _les revenus sont le produit des terres et des\r\n      hommes (Grains_, p. 276, Daire), and _Mirabeau_ frequently laid\r\n      stress on the necessary coöperation of labor and capital.\r\n      (Landwirthschaftsphilosophie, translation by _Wichmann,_ I, 5.)\r\n      _Turgot_, Sur la Formation et Distribution des Richesses, § 7. For\r\n      an excellent refutation of this “Physiocratic” one-sidedness, which,\r\n      if all men are endowed by nature with equal rights, leads to\r\n      socialism, see _Canard_, Principes, 6. According to _Gioja_, N.\r\n      Prospetto, I. 35, the part played by labor, in the production of\r\n      _Parmesan_ cheese, is a thousand times as great as that played by\r\n      the soil; and in the production of a Dutch tulip, a hundred thousand\r\n      times as great. The English are wont, similarly, to over-estimate\r\n      the relative power of labor. (_Ponocratie_, after _Ancillon_, Essais\r\n      philosophiques, 1817, II. 327.) “Commerce and trade first spring\r\n      from the labour of men.” (_North_, Discourses upon Trade, 112.)\r\n      Thus, _Locke_ (1690), Of Civil Government, II, 5, 40 ff., is of\r\n      opinion, that, at least 9/10 of the value of the products of the\r\n      soil, useful to man, are to be ascribed to labor, and, in the case\r\n      of most, even 99/100. And so, _Berkeley_ (1735), Querist, No. 38\r\n      seq. This view is advocated in its boldest form,—a thing unusual in\r\n      the case of the independent disciples of a great master—by\r\n      _McCulloch_, Principles, II, ch. i, that it is to labor, and to\r\n      labor alone, that man owes everything that possesses any value in\r\n      exchange. Similarly, _J. Mill_, Elements (1824), III, 2. The\r\n      consequences which socialism might draw from these premises are\r\n      self-evident. _Karl Marx’s_ whole system, for instance, rests,\r\n      without any attempt at demonstration, on the assumption that the\r\n      Ricardo school is right. Much more moderate views are met with\r\n      earlier. Thus, _Hobbes_, De Cive, XIII, 14, and _Leviath_., 24 (1642\r\n      and 1651), calls _labor et parsimonia_ necessary sources of wealth;\r\n      _proventus terræ et aquæ_ useful ones; and _Petty_, On Taxes (1679),\r\n      47, says: “Labour is the father and active principle of wealth, as\r\n      lands are the mother. Land and labour together are the sources of\r\n      all wealth; without a competency of lands there would be no\r\n      subsistence, and but a very poor one without labour.” _Harris_, Upon\r\n      Money and Coins, 1757, P.I. _Adam Smith_, also, in spite of the well\r\n      known passage at the beginning of his work, very frequently lays\r\n      stress on “the annual produce of land and labour.” (See the passages\r\n      collected in _Leser_, Begriff des Reichthums bei A.S., 97.)\r\n      According to _Leibniz, regionis potentia consistit in terra, rebus,\r\n      hominibus_. (ed. Dutens, IV. 2, 531.) _Ricardo’s_ school is wont to\r\n      bring capital under the head of labor, as saved-up labor. This is\r\n      about as correct as to say, that all that a grown man does, his\r\n      parents had done. (_Umpfenbach_, Nat. Œk., 64.) There is only one\r\n      way in which labor, and even then the expression is not exactly\r\n      correct, can be looked upon as the only factor in production; and\r\n      that is to presuppose the forces of nature as matters of course\r\n      (_als sich von selbst verstehend_), and to call the aggregate use\r\n      made of them by the human mind, labor. Or we might say with old\r\n      _Epicharmos_, that the gods sell all goods for labor. (_Xenoph_.,\r\n      Memor. II. 1.) Moreover, even in purely intellectual productions, in\r\n      poetical productions for instance, nature, labor and experience, the\r\n      culture inherited from former ages (a kind of intellectual capital)\r\n      uniformly coöperate. But how almost completely valueless in\r\n      literature are all entirely pure (empty!) productions of the fancy!\r\n\r\n  311 Before the predominance of the Mercantile System, _Montchrétien_\r\n      very cleverly called all trades: _parcelles et fragments de cette\r\n      sagesse divine que Dieu nous communique par le moyen de la raisen_.\r\n      By means of the three estates; _labourers, artisans, merchands, tout\r\n      état est nourri; par eux tout profit se fait. L’utilité règle les\r\n      rangs des arts_. (Traité, 12, 45, 66.) The teaching of _P. Gregorius\r\n      Tolosanos_ (ob. 1597) on the different classes of society and the\r\n      different callings of men, is still more in keeping with the present\r\n      doctrine of production; only, in the moralizing tone of the time, he\r\n      speaks rather of their dignity than of their influence in creating\r\n      wealth: De Rep. I, 195. See, also, the earlier views of _Franc.\r\n      Patricius_ (ob. 1494), De Rep. I, 4, 7, 8.\r\n\r\n  312 Compare _A.

See, also, _infra_,\r\n      § 116. First thoroughly refuted by _W. Petty_, Political Anatomy of\r\n      Ireland, 67, 82.

And later,\r\n      especially, _Ad. Smith_, W. of N. IV., ch. 1 ff. _Adam Smith’s_\r\n      doctrine of productive and unproductive labor is to be found\r\n      already, in this period, in _Petty_, Several Essays, 127 ff.\r\n      Political Anatomy, 185 ff; also, in the anonymous work, A Discourse\r\n      of Trade, Coyn and Paper Credit, London (1697), 44, 159.\r\n\r\n_  313 Quesnay_, Dialogue sur les Travaux des Artisans, 210 ff.; 289 éd.\r\n      Daire; _Turgot_, Sur la Formation etc., § 8; _Dupont_,\r\n      Correspondence avec J.B.

Similarly even _Aristotle_,\r\n      Oec., I, 2, says, that commerce, wage-labor and war win from men,\r\n      with or without their will; but that only agriculture obtains booty\r\n      from nature. And so _Cicero_ says of merchants: _nihil proficiunt,\r\n      nisi admodum mentiantur_. De Off., I, 42. The same view seems to\r\n      have prevailed during the middle ages. See _Thom. Aquin._, De Rebus\r\n      publicis, II, 3, 5 seq. _Luther_ entertained a like notion (Vom\r\n      Kaufhandel und Wucher, 1524). He prefers agriculture to the trades.\r\n      See the Irmischer edition of his works, XXII, 284; XXXVI, 172; LXI,\r\n      352. _Calvin_ considered commerce both useful and honorable; so that\r\n      _ex ipsius mercatoris diligentia atque industria_, its profit may be\r\n      greater than that of agriculture. (Opp. ed. Amstelod, 1664, IX,\r\n      223.) _Asgill_, Several Assertions proved in order to create another\r\n      Species of Money than Gold (1691): “what we call commodities is\r\n      nothing but land severed from the soil; man deals in nothing but\r\n      earth.” Concerning _Cantillon_, compare § 47, note 4. How violent an\r\n      innovation the Physiocratic theory was in its time may be inferred\r\n      from what _Zincke_ writes in the Leipzig Sammlungen, X, 551 ff.\r\n      (1753), p. 20, XIII, 861.\r\n\r\n_  314 Quesnay_, l. c., 189, does not ignore that many workmen earn more\r\n      than the cost of their necessary subsistence; but he claimed that\r\n      this was a result of a natural or legal monopoly of the same. The\r\n      dearer labor was, the more productive it seemed. Per contra, see\r\n      _Dohm_ on the Physiocratic system, in the Deutsch.

X,\r\n      Livre 19, spite of the similarity of their and Quesnay’s views,\r\n      acknowledged on this account, the productiveness of industry. For\r\n      some remarkable examples illustrative of how it may increase the\r\n      value in exchange of raw material, see the anonymous work, Paying\r\n      Old Debts without New Taxes, London, 1723. See also _Algarotti_ (ob.\r\n      1794), 318, in _Custodi_, Economisti classici italiani, Parte\r\n      moderna, I. Thus a cwt. of coarse cast iron is converted, in a\r\n      Berlin manufactory, into 88,440 shirt buttons worth 6-⅔ silver\r\n      groschens each. Hence the value is raised from 1-2 thalers to 19,653\r\n      thalers. The increase of the value in use by industrial labor is\r\n      self-evident.\r\n\r\n_  316 Quesnay_, Dialogue sur le Commerce.\r\n\r\n  317 Recognized very early by _Ad. Contzen_, Politicorum, Lib. VIII, C.\r\n      10 (1629).\r\n\r\n  318 This did not escape the notice of Frederick II. _Von Raumer_,\r\n      Hohenstaufen, III, 535.\r\n\r\n_  319 Condillac_ acknowledges the productive power both of industry and\r\n      of commerce; and that the service rendered by the state is at least\r\n      economically indispensable. (Le Commerce et le Gouvernment, 1776, I,\r\n      6, 7, 10.) _Beccaria_, Economia pubblica (1769 ff.), IV, 4, 24.\r\n      _Boisguillebert_ (ob. 1714), Sur la Nature des Richesses,\r\n      illustrated the utility of commerce by the picture of a number of\r\n      men bound to pillars, one hundred steps apart, one with a\r\n      superabundance of food but naked, a second with a superabundance of\r\n      fuel, a third with a superabundance of clothing etc.; all of whom\r\n      perish, because unable to exchange their respective surpluses with\r\n      one another. According to _Lotz_, Revision, I, 217, “buying dear,”\r\n      apart from real fraud, means only a decrease of possible gain.\r\n\r\n_  320 Verri_, Meditazioni, XXIV, instead of calling the merchant\r\n      productive, calls him a mediator between producers and consumers. It\r\n      would be just as reasonable to call the shoemaker a mediator between\r\n      the production and consumption of leather; or the cloth merchant,\r\n      who cuts the material from the piece, an assistant preparatory to\r\n      the tailor. The labor of commerce is especially like that of the\r\n      fisherman or the turf digger, because they produce only in so far as\r\n      they transfer goods from inaccessible to accessible places. See,\r\n      however, _Rau_, Lehrbuch, I, § 103. See the demonstration of the\r\n      productive power of commerce in general, as well as of what is, by\r\n      way of preference, called industry, in _Ad. Smith_, W. of N., IV,\r\n      ch. 9. A much more fundamental refutation of the Physiocratic\r\n      Principle is to be found in _Jacob_, N. Œk., 204 ff.\r\n\r\n  321 In 1843, about 55,000 tons of ice were shipped from Boston. Less\r\n      than 25 cents per ton was paid for the ice in the first instance.\r\n      When packed on board ship, it was worth $2.55 per ton. The ultimate\r\n      sale brought $3,575,000. Ausland, 1844, No. 278. The ancients were\r\n      acquainted with a similar production of ice, the value in exchange\r\n      of which might be almost entirely reduced to the labor of commerce.\r\n      See _Xenoph._, Memor., II, I, 30; Athen. III 97: Proverbs of\r\n      Solomon, 25, 13.\r\n\r\n  322 W. of N., ch. 3. See, however, _Garnier’s_ French translation of Ad.\r\n      Smith, Préf. p. IX and V, note 20. Similarly, _Malthus_, Principles,\r\n      ch. 1, Lect. 21. Definitions, ch. 7, 10.\r\n\r\n_  323 Bacon_ had already said of the nobility, clergy and literateurs:\r\n      _sorti reipublicæ nihil addunt_ (Serm., 15, 29); in opposition to\r\n      which, _Hobbes_ justly remarks, that even human labor may, like\r\n      other things, be exchanged against goods of all sorts. (Leviathan,\r\n      24.) In the work, Discourse of Trade, Coyn and Credit, p. 44 ff.,\r\n      and p. 156, the absolute necessity of “head-work” as well as bodily\r\n      labor, is conceded; but it is insisted that physicians, clergymen\r\n      and jurists can never enrich a country, and that a relatively large\r\n      number of them would even conduce to national poverty. (See\r\n      _Roscher_, Geschichte der englischen Volkswirthschaftslehre, 138.)\r\n      _David Hume_ considers merchants as productive, but says that a\r\n      doctor or lawyer can grow rich only at the expense of some one else.\r\n      (Discourses, No. 4, On Interest.) _Ferguson_ very cleverly compares\r\n      such a valuation of national wealth to that of a miser. Hist. of\r\n      Civil Society, VI, I.\r\n\r\n  324 Similarly _Lauderdale_, Inquiry, 355; _Lotz_, Handbuch der\r\n      Staätswirthschaft, I, § 39, and _Rau_, Lehrbuch I, § 195, concede\r\n      only indirect productiveness to commerce. It may be shown, in a\r\n      great many instances, that such productiveness exists side by side\r\n      with direct productiveness, on account of the thousand ways in which\r\n      all economic threads are interwoven with one another. Thus _Paley_\r\n      remarks in his work on the Principles of Morals and Politics, that a\r\n      tobacco manufacturer even may contribute indirectly to the\r\n      cultivation of grain; an actor, to industry etc.\r\n\r\n  325 Thus _Sismondi_, Nouveaux Principes, II, ch. 1, and, earlier,\r\n      _Mengotti_ Colbertismo, 317. (Cust.) See, on the other hand,\r\n      _Hermann_, Staatsw. Untersuchungen, 34 ff. Even _J.B. Say_ does no\r\n      manner of justice, in this respect, to personal services. He speaks\r\n      _of produits qui ne s’attachent à rien qui s’évanouissent à mésure\r\n      qu’ils naissent, qu’il est impossible d’accumuler, qui n’ajoutent\r\n      rein à la richesse nationale_. Compare Catéchisme (3d ed.) 52 ff.,\r\n      174 ff. On the other hand _Dunoyer_, Libertê du Travail, L.V.,\r\n      remarks that here labor and its result are made to change places;\r\n      the former like all labor is very perishable, the latter as lasting\r\n      as in the case of other kinds of labor. In the one case the utility\r\n      is fixed in things, in the other in persons. _Ad. Müller_, Elemente\r\n      der Staatskunst passim, calls special attention to how the kinds of\r\n      labor, called unproductive by _Adam Smith_, preserve the state, and\r\n      in that way, all individual exchangeable goods. Similarly, _Storch_,\r\n      Handbuch, I, 347; _Steinlein_, Handbuch, I, 460. _Lauderdale_ (443),\r\n      however, is correct when he says, that the continued duration of the\r\n      product of labor depends, usually, more on the caprice of consumers\r\n      than on the nature of the labor.\r\n\r\n_  326 Garnier_ calls attention to the fact, that there is a great\r\n      quantity of material products, such as laces, perfumes etc., that\r\n      can scarcely be ever used in further production, and, generally\r\n      speaking, one’s resources for the most part are not kept in lasting\r\n      goods, but are preserved by the change of technic forms in\r\n      production. _Hermann_, I, Aufl., 115.\r\n\r\n  327 When _Schön_, Nat. Œkonomie, 33, ridicules the idea of the\r\n      productiveness of personal services, by citing the instance of\r\n      prostitution carried on as a trade, he forgets that many material\r\n      goods also may conduce to the moral damage of the purchaser of them.\r\n      It is said that there are in France 3,500 retailers and colporteurs\r\n      of immoral writings and pictures, who sell yearly nine million\r\n      numbers or pieces, at a cost of six million francs! (Moniteur, 9\r\n      Avril, 1853.)\r\n\r\n  328 Compare _Schäffle_, Theorie der ausschliessenden Absatzverhältnise,\r\n      1867, 135. seq.\r\n\r\n  329 Many of the socialists take a retrograde step in this respect, in as\r\n      much as they consider only manual labor productive. _Fourier’s_\r\n      school particularly, declaim passionately against the\r\n      unproductiveness of commerce and of most personal services. Compare\r\n      _V. Considérant_, Destinée sociale, 1851, I, 44.\r\n\r\n  330 Besides the above, see _Gioja_, N. Prospetto, I, 246 ff.;\r\n      _Scialoja_, 42; _J. B. Say_, Traité, I, ch. 2; _Hufeland_, N.\r\n      Grundlegung, I, 42, 54; _Gr. Soden_, Nat. Œkonomie, I, 142 ff.\r\n      _Hermann_, St. Untersuchungen, 20 ff., distinguishes three\r\n      politico-economical points of view; that of the producer, that of\r\n      the consumer, and that of the whole nation’s economy. The producer\r\n      calls his labor productive, in case he receives back his outlay of\r\n      capital with the rate of profit usual in the trade of the country.\r\n      To this point of view, therefore, every service which is paid for,\r\n      according to wish, seems productive. On the other hand, the consumer\r\n      ascribes productiveness to all those kinds of labor the achievements\r\n      of which he may use, and which he can obtain at a convenient price.\r\n      Whenever, therefore, he pays for a service voluntarily, he\r\n      acknowledges its productiveness. Lastly, from a national-economical\r\n      point of view, all labor is considered productive which increases\r\n      the quantity of goods exposed for sale in the market; and this,\r\n      personal services do. The technic productiveness, which depends on\r\n      the execution of the technic ideas floating before the mind of the\r\n      workman, must be distinguished from this economic productiveness. It\r\n      is possible that, technically labor may be very productive, and yet\r\n      cause economic loss; for instance, the fine arts and the so-called\r\n      master pieces of the trades! See _Seneca_, De Benef., II, 33. _H._\r\n      (33) furnishes a very good refutation of the doctrine that a great\r\n      deal depends on whether the labor has been paid from capital or from\r\n      income. _Eiselen_, Volkswirthschaft (1843), 27 ff., remarks, that\r\n      the laborer, for instance, who grows corn, must besides look after\r\n      his health and the preservation of his house; this is a part of his\r\n      necessary aggregate labor. Why, then, should it be called\r\n      unproductive when such secondary labor is performed by particular\r\n      persons? Otherwise the farmer would have no time whatever for his\r\n      principal business! Edinburgh Review, 1804, IV, 343 ff.;\r\n      _Wakefield_, An Essay upon Political Economy, 1804, who is concerned\r\n      mainly with the theory of the productiveness of labor. _L.\r\n      Lauderdale_ says, that when the nation’s wealth is estimated\r\n      according to its value in use, all useful labor is productive; and\r\n      that when estimated according to its value in exchange, all labor\r\n      that is paid is productive. (Inquiry, ch. 3.) _Stein_ (Lehrbuch, 68;\r\n      Tüb. Zeitschr., 1868, 230) conditions the notion of productiveness\r\n      by the presence of a superfluity of values. But, it may be asked,\r\n      does a family, which does no more than support itself, labor\r\n      unproductively? (Compare, however, § 30.) _J. S. Mill_ took a\r\n      surprisingly retrograde step in the doctrine on this point, in his\r\n      Principles, I, ch. 3. Compare his Essays on some unsettled Questions\r\n      of Political Economy, No. 3. A still more surprising exaggeration in\r\n      _de Augustinis_ Instituzzioni di Economia sociale (Napoli 1837), who\r\n      goes so far as to call a person guilty of arson a productive person\r\n      because he has produced for himself “the pleasure of destruction”!\r\n      More recently, _von Mangoldt_ distinguishes between economic labor\r\n      and the labor of culture: the latter is incorporated into the man\r\n      himself, the former one employed on the external world, in order to\r\n      transform it in a way corresponding to human wants. Viewed from the\r\n      stand-point of Political Economy, the latter only is productive.\r\n      (Volkswirthschaftslehre, 1865, 26 ff.)\r\n\r\n  331 We might, indeed, compare original production, that which preceded\r\n      all other, to eating; the trades, to digestion; commerce, to the\r\n      movements of the several members of the body; personal services to\r\n      inspiration, and yet all are equally necessary to the life of the\r\n      body! Thus, _Gamilh_ compares agriculture to the root of a tree of\r\n      which the service rendered by the state is the top. The growth of\r\n      the latter contributes, as well as that of the former, to the\r\n      nutrition of the whole, and is far removed from exhausting the tree.\r\n      Théorie de l’ E.P., II, 46 ff. “Natural production” would, indeed,\r\n      accomplish very little without the legal protection guaranteed by\r\n      the state, or without the tools furnished by industry etc. But it\r\n      is, besides, in most instances, a distortion of the truth to speak\r\n      of productive and unproductive men or classes of men. These\r\n      expressions are proper only when applied to individual kinds of\r\n      labor. See _Murhard_, Ideen über Nat. Œk., 88 ff. Persons seriously\r\n      ill are temporarily unproductive, and children who die early, are\r\n      unproductive for their whole life.\r\n\r\n  332 Not, however, in the case in which the loser estimates the pleasure\r\n      of the play higher than the loss.\r\n\r\n_  333 J. B. Say_, Traité, I. ch. 1.\r\n\r\n_  334 v. Cancrin_, Œkonomie der menschlichen Gesellschaften, 1845, 10,\r\n      speaks, in this case, of privative production. Among the Socialists,\r\n      _Bazard’s_ expression _l’exploitation de l’homme par l’homme_, has\r\n      found loud echo; instead of which only _l’exploitation du globe par\r\n      l’homme_ should be allowed to obtain. (Exposition de la Doctrine de\r\n      St. Simon, 24.) But _von Schröder_ had already warned the world of\r\n      “imagined food” which led only to idleness. (F. Schatz- und\r\n      Rentkammer, 191, 363.)\r\n\r\n  335 Therefore, there should not be too many nor too highly salaried\r\n      offices. See _Storch_, Nationaleinkommen, 33 ff.\r\n\r\n  336 See _v. Mangoldt_, Volkswirthschaftslehre, 29 ff.\r\n\r\n_  337 Remained_, and not _become_, poor, as is generally supposed; for\r\n      the enormous wealth of Spain, under Ferdinand and Isabella, as well\r\n      as during the early period of Charles V. is only a _fable convenue_.\r\n      Charles V. said: France has a superabundance of everything, and\r\n      Spain is in want of everything. See also the embassy report of\r\n      _Navagero_ (1526), Viaggio fatto in Spagna e in Francia (Venet.,\r\n      1563), and _Ranke_, Fürsten und Volker, I, 393 ff.\r\n\r\n  338 The prize was won by _Arreta de Monteseguro_. The author of the\r\n      history of Portuguese Asia, translated by _Stevens_, is of opinion\r\n      (III, ch. 6), that commerce is not a proper subject for serious\r\n      history to treat.\r\n\r\n  339 There is a very fine description of this spirit in _Clenard_, Epist.\r\n      I. ad Latomum (1535 ff.) Compare _Juvellanos_, in _Laborde_,\r\n      Itinéraire déscriptif, IV, 176. _Townsend_, Journey through Spain,\r\n      II, 207, 117. _Buckle_, History of Civilization, II, ch. I. The\r\n      census of 1788 gave the number of priests and monks, soldiers,\r\n      mariners, nobles, lawyers, tax-gatherers, authors, students and\r\n      domestics, at 1,221,000, in a total of 3,800,000 men; from which\r\n      number there was a multitude of beggars, vagrants etc. to be\r\n      deducted. _Laborde_, Itinéraire, II, 32 ff. The seventeen\r\n      universities and the numberless small Latin schools, with their\r\n      gratuitous instruction, and their many scholarships, misled a\r\n      disproportionately large number to engage in study. At the beginning\r\n      of this century, there were at least 200,000 priests, nuns\r\n      (_Geistliche_), etc., in a population of from three to three and a\r\n      half millions only. (_Ebeling_, Erdbeschreibung von Portugal, 66.)\r\n      _Senior_ shows that the poverty of the Osman is caused by too many\r\n      state employees, tax-farmers and retail merchants. (Journal kept in\r\n      Turkey and Greece, 1857-58.) Thus, also, _J. Tucker_, Four Tracts,\r\n      1774, 18, contrasts men engaged in industry with rich idlers, whose\r\n      increase, possibly by immigration, would make the people a nation of\r\n      “gentlemen and ladies, footmen, grooms, laundresses etc.”\r\n      _Schmitthener_, N. Œk., 656, calls a condition such as that of\r\n      Spain, “national-economical phthisis.”\r\n\r\n_  340 Tucker_, Progress of the U.S., 137. The following data also will\r\n      serve for a comparison: In Belgium, in 1856, it was estimated that,\r\n      leaving persons _sans profession_ out of consideration, 45.6 per\r\n      cent. were agriculturists, 37.2 industrials, 6.7 in commerce, 2.8 in\r\n      the liberal professions, 1.5 _force publique_, 2.1 _propriétaires,\r\n      rentiers, pensionnés_, 3.7 _domesticité_. In Prussia, in 1871, of\r\n      the entire male population, 28.6 per cent. were engaged in\r\n      agriculture, forest-culture, hunting and fishing: 32.3 per cent. in\r\n      mining, industry, building, and in founderies: 8.56 in trade and\r\n      commerce; 20.3 in personal services and handiwork not belonging to\r\n      any of the groups above mentioned; 2.3 in the army and navy; 3.7 in\r\n      other callings; 2.7 were renters, pensioners, and persons who lived\r\n      by selling or renting houses, reserving lodgings for themselves\r\n      therein, and persons who gave no account of their calling. (Preuss.\r\n      statisc. Zeitschr., 1875, 32. ff.) It is, however, surprising that\r\n      _Engel’s_ Amtl. Jahrbuch, III, 1867, gives only 48 per cent. as\r\n      belonging to the first category, and 25 to the second. In the\r\n      kingdom of Saxony in 1861, 25.1 per cent. of the population were\r\n      agriculturists and foresters; 56.1 were engaged in industry; 7.7 in\r\n      trade and commerce; 6.8 in art, science, the service of the state\r\n      and of private persons; while 4.1 per cent were without any\r\n      particular calling, or returned none. Bavaria, in 1852, had 67.9 per\r\n      cent. of its population engaged in agriculture; 22.7 in the trades\r\n      and in manufactures; 5.5 per cent., persons living on the interest\r\n      of their money, and by performing the higher class of personal\r\n      services; 1.9 in the army; and 2 per cent. of listed poor. In\r\n      _Hermann_, Beiträge zur Statistik des Königreichs Bayern. In France,\r\n      according to the official reports, there were:\r\n\r\n      _Agriculteurs_ 61.46 per cent. in 1851, 51.49 per cent. in 1866;\r\n      _Industriels et commerçants_ 25.95 per cent. in 1851, 32.78 per\r\n      cent. in 1866;\r\n      _Professions libérales_ 9.73 per cent. in 1851, 9.48 per cent. in\r\n      1866.\r\n\r\n      To which it must be added, that, in 1851, there were 2.86 _sans\r\n      profession ou dont les professions n’ont pu être constatées_; and\r\n      that, in 1866, on the other hand, there were 2.87 per cent. in\r\n      _professions se rattachant à l’agriculture, industrie et commerce.\r\n      (Legoyt.)_ In England and Wales, leaving the domestic class out of\r\n      consideration (women without an independent means of employment,\r\n      school children, servant girls etc.), and also the “indefinite\r\n      class,” there were, in 1861, 25.3 per cent. of the population\r\n      engaged in agricultural pursuits; 60.7 in industrial; 7.8 in\r\n      commercial; and 6.06 in professional pursuits. In Italy, omitting\r\n      housewives, children and infirm persons, there were, in 1862, 57.4\r\n      per cent. of the population engaged in agriculture; 22.9 in\r\n      industrial pursuits; 4 in commerce; and 3.9 per cent. in the army\r\n      and in the liberal professions.

Time thieving is also more frequent among servants. There\r\n      is scarcely anything in agriculture analogous to the lazzaroni who\r\n      wait all day to help a gondola to land, to unload a coach, etc.\r\n      There is more in the chase, in the fisheries, or in the cattle\r\n      raising.\r\n\r\n  343 Compare _Bastiat_, Harmonies économiques, ch. 17. Hence _Sismondi_\r\n      accounts it one of the chief merits of the constitutional state,\r\n      that in it, the _population gardienne_ does not regulate its own\r\n      remuneration. (N.P., I, 144.) _Saint Simon_, indeed, says that the\r\n      French members of the _Chambre_, in his time, drew a revenue from\r\n      the state, three times as large as from their own resources, and\r\n      were, therefore, deeply interested in increasing the budget. (Vues\r\n      sur la Propriété et la Législation, 1818.) I would call attention\r\n      also to the national over-estimation and over-crowding of learned\r\n      callings from which Germany suffered, even as far back as the time\r\n      of Louis XIV. (_v. Schröder_, Fürstl. Schatz-und Rentkammer, 302\r\n      ff.); to the disproportionate number of keepers of public houses,\r\n      which is related to the system of popular assemblies, and is a\r\n      regular attendant upon Democracy (_Bronner_, Der C. Aargau, I, 451.)\r\n      Taxation-legislation may here become a good means of popular\r\n      education.\r\n\r\n  344 This was recognized very early by _Gregor. Tolsan_, l.c. _Ad.\r\n      Müller_, Elemente, II, 255. _Storch_, Handbuch, II, 229 ff.\r\n      (_Schleiermacher_, Christ. Sitte, 668.) _A. Smith,_ W. of N., II,\r\n      ch. 5, ascribed greater productiveness to agricultural than to\r\n      industrial labor; in the former case, not only human labor was put\r\n      in operation, but the forces of nature were compelled to coöperate\r\n      with them. Similarly, _Malthus_, Additions (1817) to the Essay on\r\n      the Principle of Population, B. III, ch. 8-12. Principles of P. E.,\r\n      217 ff. Both thus explain the rent of land, and so far as products,\r\n      which have only value in exchange are concerned, they are right.\r\n      Hence it is all the more surprising that _Carey_, the zealous\r\n      advocate of a protective tariff and opponent of rent, comes back in\r\n      this to Adam Smith. Principles of Social Science, 1858, II, 35, and\r\n      passim. Compare also _J. B. Say_, Traité, II, ch. 8; _Sismondi_, N.\r\n      P., II, ch. 5. For the best refutation of this view, see _Ricardo_,\r\n      Principles, ch. 2, 3. Does not all labor put the force of nature in\r\n      operation? _Ad opera nihil aliud potest homo, quam ut corpora\r\n      naturalia admoveat, reliqua natura intus transigit._ (_Bacon._)\r\n      Similarly, _Verri_, Meditazioni, III, 1. An expression escapes even\r\n      _Ricardo_ himself (ch. 7), to the effect, that capitalists are the\r\n      producing class.\r\n\r\n  345 Relying on very superficial statistics of England and France,\r\n      _Ganilh_ advocates a theory of the productive forces of the several\r\n      branches of economy the very reverse of _Adam Smith’s_. He places\r\n      foreign trade first; then follow wholesale trade, industry and\r\n      agriculture. (Théorie, I, 240 seq.)\r\n\r\n  346 Ausland, 1846, No. 54. Expressions still used in Europe, such as\r\n      _Spindelmagen_ (spindle-relation), _Kunkellehen_ (apron-string-hold)\r\n      etc., for instance, suggest this most ancient and purely family\r\n      division of labor. The lower classes of the population, even in the\r\n      most civilized countries, are wont to preserve some of the peculiar\r\n      customs of very primitive times. Hence it is that among\r\n      proletarians, the division of labor between males and females is\r\n      still very small. The employments usual at different stages of life\r\n      among men, and the costumes worn by them are much more uniform than\r\n      among the higher classes. See _Riehl_, Die Familie, 1855, passim.\r\n\r\n  347 As _Dankwardt_ shows, the _jus civile_ of the earliest Roman time is\r\n      based on the condition of isolated labor, the later _jus gentium_,\r\n      on the division of labor.

In countries with an unadvanced\r\n      civilization, the little division of labor that exists is also very\r\n      awkwardly regulated. Thus in Russia, weak children are very\r\n      frequently put to work on farms, while powerful men are found in the\r\n      city offering all kinds of eatables and the pictures of saints for\r\n      sale.

To him\r\n      we are indebted almost entirely for our knowledge of the natural\r\n      laws developed in § 59 seq.\r\n\r\n  355 According to _Adam Smith_, a nailer can make 2,300 nails (_Rau_ says\r\n      3,000 shoemaker’s tacks in the Odenwalde) per day; a smith who is\r\n      only occasionally employed in the manufacture, from 800 to 1,000;\r\n      and smiths who never made nails before, from 200 to 300. A clever\r\n      filer makes 200 strokes in a minute; a skilled comb-maker can make\r\n      in a day from 60 to 70 combs of such fineness that there are from 40\r\n      to 48 teeth to the inch in them; eight Liege brick-makers, working\r\n      together, produce 4,800 bricks per day; children employed in a\r\n      needle manufactory, in making the eyes of needles, grow so skillful\r\n      at it that they can make a small hole in the finest hair and draw\r\n      another hair through it. _Rau_, Lehrbuch I, § 115. The old proverb,\r\n      “practice makes perfect,” is followed even by thieves in their great\r\n      division of labor. See _Thiele_, Die jüdischen Gauner I, 87.\r\n      _Fregier_, Des Classes Dangéreuses.\r\n\r\n  356 Children, with their thinner fingers, can point twice as many\r\n      needles in the same time as a grown person.\r\n\r\n  357 The manufacture of English needles demands, on the part of workmen,\r\n      degrees of skill so different that their pay varies from 6 pence to\r\n      20 shillings per day. If the most skillful workman were to\r\n      manufacture whole needles alone, he would partly be obliged to be\r\n      satisfied with one-fortieth of what he might otherwise receive.\r\n      _Babbage_, loc. cit.\r\n\r\n  358 In the case of machines and in the chemical branches of industry,\r\n      the labor increases in a much smaller ratio than the material used\r\n      in production.\r\n\r\n  359 In opposition to monopolies, and to practical constraint which has\r\n      its source in ignorance etc.\r\n\r\n  360 Hence _Torrens_ calls foreign trade the “territorial division of\r\n      labour.” (Essay on the Production of Wealth (1821), 155 ff.)\r\n\r\n  361 See _Bastiat_, Harmonies, ch. 1, for a very beautiful exposition of\r\n      the doctrine that each man receives much more from society than he\r\n      accomplishes on his part, for it.\r\n\r\n  362 The working together of a great number of persons is often carried\r\n      on to the detriment of agriculture, for each then waits for all the\r\n      others to work, throws all the blame on them etc. (_Columella_, I,\r\n      9.) As many a housekeeper must have observed, two seamstresses or\r\n      ironers accomplish, in a day, less than one, in two days. Of course,\r\n      this rule does not apply in the case of work which cannot be\r\n      performed by one man, under any circumstances, or the magnitude of\r\n      which would easily discourage him, and in which mutual aid is easily\r\n      obtained; as in the raising of heavy loads, the construction of\r\n      roads, dikes etc.\r\n\r\n_  363 Ad. Smith_, B., II, Introd. _Hufeland_, Neue Grundlegung, I, 215.\r\n      In many instances, a division of labor, of course, favors the saving\r\n      of capital. If every workman needed all the tools necessary to the\r\n      work in which he participates, three-fourths of them would have to\r\n      lie idle at present. _J. Rae_, New Principles on the Subject of\r\n      Political Economy, 164.\r\n\r\n  364 This necessity is observable, although in a peculiar form, even\r\n      where what has been called the “despotic organization of labor”\r\n      prevails, instead of freedom.\r\n\r\n  365 In the highlands of Scotland, in Adam Smith’s time, there were no\r\n      smiths who manufactured nails only; for the reason that no smith had\r\n      a market for more than 1,000 nails a year, that is not for so many\r\n      as might be manufactured in a single day.\r\n\r\n  366 It is of course very different when there is question of a foreign\r\n      market, even if it be only indirectly. Thus, for instance, there are\r\n      in the Hartz mountains, persons who are simply post-makers,\r\n      trough-makers, chess-wood-makers, block-hewers, shingle-makers etc.\r\n\r\n  367 Too much should not be inferred from the existence among the\r\n      Egyptians of physicians, specialists for the several members of the\r\n      body. _Herodot._, II, 84. Something analogous is to be found even\r\n      among barbarous nations; but it is accounted for entirely by the\r\n      superstition of the people. See _Klemm_, Kulturgeschichte, I, 266.\r\n\r\n  368 In the whole of Hesse, there were under Philip the Magnanimous, only\r\n      two apothecaries, one at Cassel and one at Marburg. _Rommel_, Gesch.\r\n      v. Hessen, IV, p. 419, note. And there were no bakers among the\r\n      Romans before the time of the war with Perseus. All the bread needed\r\n      by the family was baked by the wife or by female domestics. _Plin._,\r\n      H. N. XVIII, 28. The common oven in new towns marks the period of\r\n      transition. Even yet, in the central part of France, there are\r\n      localities where each family bakes its own bread for a whole month\r\n      in advance; and, in the Alpine departments for even a year in\r\n      advance. _M. Chevalier_, Cours II, 366.\r\n\r\n  369 It is obvious from the foregoing that, in decaying nations, in which\r\n      the market contracts and capital decreases, the division of labor\r\n      also must grow less.\r\n\r\n  370 According to _Arago_, a horse uses the same amount of force to draw\r\n      20 cwt. along an ordinary road that he does to draw 200 over a\r\n      railroad track, or 1,200 on a canal. He could carry scarcely 2 or 3\r\n      on his back! Moniteur, 1838, No. 116. It is, however, certain that\r\n      the introduction of our railroads has somewhat detracted from the\r\n      advantages of coasts.\r\n\r\n  371 Compare _Humboldt_, Essai politique sur l’Ile de Cuba, II, 205.\r\n\r\n_  372 Strabo_, II, 121 ff. In Europe, there is one mile of coast to every\r\n      31 square miles in the interior; in North America, to 56; in South\r\n      America, 91; in Asia, 100; in Africa, 142. (_Humboldt._)\r\n\r\n  373 If the original connection of the Caspian sea and the sea of Aral\r\n      with the Frozen Ocean were still in existence, it is probable that\r\n      an Asiatic Scandinavia would have been formed in consequence.\r\n\r\n  374 What is true of the sea in this respect may be claimed, also, though\r\n      in a less degree, for the streams that carry the civilizing fruits\r\n      of the coasts far into the interior. Nearly all large cities not\r\n      situated on the harbors of coasts derive their importance from\r\n      rivers; especially when they have been built on spots adapted by\r\n      nature to the transhipment of merchandise. That Venice finally\r\n      eclipsed Genoa is to be ascribed, in greatest part, to its control\r\n      of an important stream, the Po. The economic importance of Holland,\r\n      of Hamburg and Bremen will, in the long run, bear the same relation\r\n      to one another as the geographical importance of the valleys of the\r\n      Rhine, Elbe and Weser. As nothing is more disastrous to a nation\r\n      than the loss of its coast (we need only cite the efforts of the\r\n      Lybian kings and, later, of Philip of Macedon to conquer the Greek\r\n      colonies on their coasts; and in more recent times, of Russia before\r\n      Peter the Great, or of the Zollverein without the shores of the\r\n      German sea), so, also, the economic and political influence of a\r\n      stream increases as one approaches its mouth. Hence the\r\n      justification of the great interest taken by Germany and Austria in\r\n      the question of the Danubian principalities. The United States\r\n      recognized this fact when they purchased Louisiana for 80,000,000\r\n      francs. _Bignon_, Hist. de France III, 111 seq. Readers of history\r\n      are familiar with the important part played by the three Asiatic\r\n      Mesopotamias: that between the Euphrates and the Tigris; that\r\n      between the Ganges and the Brahmapootra; that between the Hoang-Ho\r\n      and the Yang-tse-Kiang, to which finally the Punjab might be added.\r\n      This relation is recognized by popular consciousness, in the case of\r\n      the Ganges, by the belief in the sacredness of the stream. No river\r\n      has had so much influence on civilization as the Nile: its\r\n      periodical risings have made the labor of agriculture\r\n      extraordinarily easy; their extent and regularity favored the\r\n      progress of astronomy; the flooding over of the land led to geodesy;\r\n      the hydraulic labors necessitated by the rising of the waters\r\n      produced a school of architecture to which the river furnished an\r\n      excellent means of transportation for the enormous masses to be\r\n      moved. _K. Ritter_, Erdkunde, I, p. 880 seq; VI, p. 1,168 seq. In\r\n      this matter, also, America and Europe have the advantage over Asia\r\n      and Africa. While the Danube is, in places, scarcely three German\r\n      miles from the Rhine—which, however, flows in an almost opposite\r\n      direction—in Asia, the eastern streams are separated from the\r\n      western, and the northern from the southern, by a strip of land\r\n      difficult to be traveled, and about 300 German miles in extent.\r\n      Besides, the principal streams of northern Asia have their exit into\r\n      the Frozen Ocean, a fact which diminishes their importance greatly.\r\n      The source of the Missouri is only about one mile distant from the\r\n      Columbia river, although the two flow towards opposite seas.\r\n\r\n  375 The law governing the march of civilization from the mountain to the\r\n      plain and to coast lands was observed even by _Strabo_, XIII, 592,\r\n      and partly by _Plato_, De Leg., 677 ff.\r\n\r\n  376 Thus, for instance, that all the customers of a shoemaker together\r\n      form a shoe-association etc. _Dunoyer_, Liberté du Travail, L.

There is certainly a\r\n      misunderstood truth in this saying. It is assuredly very salutary,\r\n      in the actual state of society, in which every one’s business is\r\n      transacted for him by some one else, that a time should occasionally\r\n      come when no one can take our place, and a man can only call upon\r\n      himself.

The working together of wife\r\n      and child, introduced recently by manufacturers, cannot be\r\n      considered as a higher grade of the division of labor, but only as a\r\n      very unfavorable change in the kind of it; inasmuch as it were\r\n      better to employ the women in their domestic avocations and to leave\r\n      children to their studies and their sports. Among the higher\r\n      classes, it should be made the part of female education, to\r\n      counterbalance, in the family, the effects of the ever increasing\r\n      division of labor among the male portion, by the development of that\r\n      which is universally human—art, sociability, house-keeping etc.\r\n\r\n_  384 Schleiermacher_, Christliche Sitte, 465 ff., 676 ff., 154 ff. From\r\n      a similar feeling, although much exaggerated, the Greeks of the\r\n      classic age proper considered all callings followed for gain\r\n      dishonorable, not excepting even those of the physician and of the\r\n      teacher. _Plato_, de Rep., I, 347 ff. _Aristot._, Rhet., I, 9, 27:\r\n      μηδεμίαν ἐργάζεσθαι βὰναυσον τέχνην, ἐλευθέρον γάρ τὸ μὴ πρὸς ἄλλον\r\n      ζην.\r\n\r\n  385 As, for instance, the superintendent of a manufactory must have a\r\n      better general training, but can get along with less of a special,\r\n      than his workmen.\r\n\r\n_  386 Thucydides_ says of the contemporaries of Pericles: “The same men\r\n      devote themselves, among us, in part to domestic and political\r\n      business; in part, others who busy themselves with agriculture and\r\n      industry have no mean knowledge of the affairs of state. We call\r\n      those who take no part in the former not people loving their ease,\r\n      but useless men.” (II, 40.) During the succeeding period, Athens was\r\n      destroyed mainly by the ever increasing division of labor between\r\n      citizens and soldiers. For, “to separate the arts which form the\r\n      citizen and the statesman, the arts of policy and war, is an attempt\r\n      to dismember the human character, and to destroy those very arts we\r\n      mean to improve.” (_Ferguson._) We know from _Valerius Maximus_,\r\n      that the Roman soldiers from the time of Marius had, doubtless, a\r\n      better technic training than their ancestors who who defeated\r\n      Hannibal; but was it in a military or political sense that they were\r\n      thus better trained? The beautiful definition of Cato intimates\r\n      something of the same nature; the good orator was _vir bonus dicendi\r\n      peritus_. (_Quintilian_, XII, I.) And so _Garve_, Versuche, IV, 51\r\n      ff., expects from the political elevation of citizenship, of those\r\n      possessed of the right of citizens, not only usefulness in a\r\n      particular direction but the development of the whole man, a thing\r\n      hitherto expected only of the nobility.\r\n\r\n  387 As one’s peculiar calling does not take up all his life, we must\r\n      draw a clear distinction between the one-sidedness of labor and the\r\n      one-sidedness of life, (_von Mangoldt_, Volkswirthschaftslehre,\r\n      227.) Only the last is to be avoided at all hazards; and we find it\r\n      in the middle ages, with its limited divisions of labor, perhaps\r\n      more frequently than where civilization has attained a higher stage.\r\n      During the middle ages, it was not unusual to make feelings which\r\n      every one should cultivate at times, if only temporarily, the\r\n      lasting calling of some. Thus one prayed his whole life long, or was\r\n      engaged in contemplation, and relieved others of the necessity of\r\n      performing these duties. The consequence was, that the latter sank\r\n      as deeply in worldliness and want of the interior spirit as the\r\n      former were plunged in idleness and hypocrisy. But, on the other\r\n      hand, when, in our day, the printer relieves the writer of a portion\r\n      of the labor which might be his, the personal development of neither\r\n      suffers.\r\n\r\n_  388 L’uomo è un’ tal potenza, che unita all’ altra non fa un eguale\r\n      alla somma, ma al quadrato della somma._ (_Genovesi._) As to how the\r\n      action of every individual man is a species of division and union of\r\n      different kinds of labor, see _Stein_, Lehrbuch, 24.\r\n\r\n  389 Compare _Ad. Müller_, Elemente der Staatskunst, III, 1809. _Fr.\r\n      List_, System der polit. Œkonomie, 222 ff., 409 ff. _Wakefield_, in\r\n      his edition of Adam Smith, distinguishes two degrees of coöperation,\r\n      simple and complex. In the case of simple labor, the same sort of\r\n      work is performed at the same time and place by several individuals,\r\n      as, for instance, by a lot of hod-carriers in building. In the other\r\n      case, there are different kinds of work performed at different times\r\n      and places, but all intended for the one greater end. Agriculture\r\n      affords room for the first especially, and it is known also to a\r\n      great number of animal species.\r\n\r\n  390 Flemish weavers in England, French refugees in Protestant countries;\r\n      German miners in Spain, Scandinavia, Hungary and America.\r\n\r\n  391 This, so very largely developed in Egypt and India, where the\r\n      principle of caste obtains, is very little developed in the\r\n      despotisms of Asia. The great princes, in the latter countries,\r\n      build largely from vanity only. Hence their successors seldom\r\n      complete their works, and scarcely repair them. Nowhere else are\r\n      there so many half completed and yet decaying buildings. _Klemm_,\r\n      Kulturgeschichte, VIII, 86. _Riedel_, N. Œkonomie I, 259, very\r\n      correctly remarks that such kinds of coöperation as contribute most\r\n      to the propagation of skill, both in commerce and manual labor, have\r\n      less real division of labor, and vice versa.\r\n\r\n  392 Compare _Leplay_, La Réforme sociale en France (1864).\r\n\r\n  393 Concerning association in general, see _M. Chevalier_, Cours, III,\r\n      Leçon, 24, 25. On this subject so much talked of in our day, see,\r\n      more in detail, concerning its application to agriculture, my work,\r\n      Nationalökonomik des Ackerbaues, 4, § 39, 47 ff.; 68, 133 ff.; on\r\n      its application to industry, especially where there is question of\r\n      the relation of handiwork and manufactures to large factories; see\r\n      _Roscher_, Ansichten der Volkswirthschaft, II, Aufl., 1861,\r\n      Abhandlung, IV, V.\r\n\r\n_  394 Adam Smith_ remarked that the laws of the division of labor obtain\r\n      also in intellectual works; and indeed, among all nations in a very\r\n      low grade of civilization, the germs of all art and science are\r\n      found connected with theology; and later, the germs of all poetry\r\n      and history with the epic. The expression: _non defuit homini, sed\r\n      scientiæ, quod nescivit Salmasius_, is a clear proof of the\r\n      insignificance of the science of the time. Think of the increase\r\n      during the last hundred years of the branches of study in our German\r\n      universities. There are now thirty-four regular professors in the\r\n      Leipzig philosophical faculty, where then there were only nine. But\r\n      here also the principle proves true, that an excessive division of\r\n      labor, where the broader connection and the deeper foundation of all\r\n      sciences disappear from the consciousness, undermines intellectual\r\n      health and freedom. And the injury here is greater and more\r\n      irreparable than in the domain of mere physical labor. See\r\n      _Hufeland_, N. Grundlegung, I, 207 ff. If we have just become\r\n      Alexandrians, we have, however, no Aristotle to hope for.\r\n      _Jurisprudentia est divinarum atque humanarum rerum notitia, justi\r\n      atque injusti scientia_ (_Ulpian_). It is remarkable that nations\r\n      who possess no real national literature of their own, when they once\r\n      get beyond the bounds of utter barbarism, learn foreign languages\r\n      etc., most easily.\r\n\r\n  395 The socialistic utopia of _Ch. Fourier_ (Théorie des quatre\r\n      Mouvements, 1808. Théorie de l’Unité universelle, 1822. Le nouveau\r\n      Monde industriel et sociétaire, 1829) are based upon the following\r\n      fundamental ideas. A. The present civilization is that of a\r\n      topsy-turvy world, especially in so far as it ascribes a “moral” (a\r\n      word always used by him in an ironical sense) self-government to\r\n      man. In Fourier’s world, on the other hand, every man is supposed,\r\n      at all times, to give free rein to every _passion_; and the play of\r\n      these gratifications constitutes the _harmonie_, in which the\r\n      poorest find more enjoyment than do kings at the present time. (See\r\n      § 207 of this work.) B. The main thing to further this is a radical\r\n      reform in the division and cooperation of labor as they exist at\r\n      present. Instead of the present villages and cities, we should have\r\n      only phalansteries, each with 2,000 inhabitants, and situated in the\r\n      center of the land cultivated by them. Instead of the present\r\n      nations and states, we should have a universal confederate republic,\r\n      hierarchically graded, with French as the universal language.\r\n      According to the demands of the _passion papillonne_, each one\r\n      should carry on the most different kinds of business side by side,\r\n      and each one of them at most two hours per day; i.e., every one\r\n      should be a dilettante, no one a master, and everything should be\r\n      done as badly as possible. _Proudhon_, Contradictions économiques,\r\n      ch. 3, objects to this, that a workman must, in some way, be held\r\n      responsible for his work. _Fourier_ himself calculates that, in his\r\n      _harmonie_ all pleasures are productive labor; and that by this\r\n      constant change, one might be satisfied with from 4-½ to 5-½ hours\r\n      of sleep, and that even children 2-½ years old might take part in\r\n      the work. Thus, there would be a great rivalry between apple-growers\r\n      and pear-growers, so great “that more intrigues in attack and\r\n      defense [_passion cabaliste_] would arise there than in all the\r\n      cabinets of Europe,” in the settling of which the growers of quinces\r\n      would act as intermediaries. There are, in addition to all this,\r\n      wonderful aids; a fructifying crown of light rises over the north\r\n      pole; oranges bloom in Siberia; the sea becomes as delicious as\r\n      lemonade; dangerous animals die, and in their stead anti-lions and\r\n      anti-whales come into being, animals useful to man, which draw his\r\n      ships for him during calms. These ideas are by no means retracted in\r\n      _Fourier’s_ later works, See Nouveau Monde (Oeuvres) IV, 447. The\r\n      propositions of _Robert Owen_, A new View of Society (1812), have\r\n      much similarity with those of Fourier. They differ only in the\r\n      absence of the French barrack-like character of the phalanxes, and\r\n      the fantastic character of the presentation of the doctrine. He\r\n      would have all the land divided into districts of 1,000 acres each;\r\n      each district to have a four-cornered town with 1,000 inhabitants,\r\n      following a system of production and consumption in common, but not\r\n      with full equality; carrying on both agriculture and other business.\r\n      A principal feature here is an entirely new system of education. The\r\n      author says that man has hitherto been the slave of an execrable\r\n      trinity: positive religion, personal property and indissoluble\r\n      wedlock.

Among negro\r\n      nations deprivation of freedom is one of the most usual punishments\r\n      for crime; but the criminal has the option of substituting his wife\r\n      or child for himself. _L.A. de Oliveira Mendez_, in the Memor.\r\n      econom. of the Royal Academy of Lisbon, vol.

In Chili, the poorest country people who were not\r\n      entirely white, sold their children in the towns, where they grew up\r\n      with the families of their masters, and were then kept as servants\r\n      in a state of semi-serfdom. There is, it is true, no law governing\r\n      this condition of things. (_Pöppig_, Reise, I, 201 ff.)\r\n\r\n_  403 Ritter_, XIII, 727.

But compare, however, _Humboldt_,\r\n      Neuspanien, IV, 263. This condition of things has been produced in\r\n      Peru, also, by the payment of one or two years’ wages in advance.\r\n      (_Pöppig_, Reise, II, 225.)\r\n\r\n  404 Thus _Forbonnais_, Eléments du Commerce (1854) I, 364, says of trade\r\n      with savages: _il fait naître dans ces nations le goût du superflu\r\n      et des commodités, qui multiplie le, échanges et leur donne le goût\r\n      du travail._\r\n\r\n  405 In very uncivilized nations, among whom serfdom is not known, we\r\n      generally find the slavery of woman and the temporary bondage of the\r\n      son-in-law in order to secure the daughter in marriage.

(_Kohl_, Reise durch Russland II, 8, 300.) The\r\n      Livonian peasants have become poorer since their emancipation.\r\n      (_Cancrin_, Œkonomie der menschlichen Gesellschaften, 41). Many of\r\n      the serfs refused to accept emancipation. (_Büsch_, Geldumlauf,\r\n      Einleitung, § 6.) And so _Martius_, Reise in Brasilien II, 552 ff.,\r\n      assures us that the negro slaves in Brazil are as a rule a very\r\n      merry set. He is also of the opinion that they are better clothed,\r\n      lodged, fed and employed than in their own country. For the\r\n      remarkable official defense of North American slavery directed by\r\n      _Calhoun_, to Lord Aberdeen, see the Allg. Zeitung, 1844, No. 145.\r\n      In this document, we find a comparison instituted between the free\r\n      negroes of the north and the slaves of the south. In the north,\r\n      there was one deaf-mute, a case of blindness and of insanity in\r\n      every 96; in the south, in every 672; a pauper, invalid and prisoner\r\n      in every 6 at the north, in every 54 at the south. In Maine, 1/12th\r\n      of the negroes were afflicted by disease; in Florida, 1/1105th(?).\r\n      The fact that the slave population of the United States increased,\r\n      between 1840 and 1860, from 2,873,698 to 4,441,830, while the free\r\n      negro population of Jamaica, between 1833 and 1843, underwent a\r\n      frightful decrease, is to the same purport. However, too much must\r\n      not be inferred from all this, as the negroes in America are very\r\n      far from being the children of the soil.\r\n\r\n  407 The servants in the Odyssey who cared for hogs and cattle etc. were\r\n      certainly in a better condition in many respects than the peasants\r\n      of Attica, who were free, but buried in debt until the time of\r\n      Solon. Concerning the mildness of the treatment of slaves in very\r\n      early Roman times, see _Plutarch_, Coriol., 24, and _Cato_, I, 3, 20\r\n      ff.; _Cato_, de Re rust, 5, 56 ff.; _Macrob._, Stat.

See especially the beautiful passages in\r\n      _Philemon_: _Meineke_, Comicorum jr., 364, 410. _Aristotle_ even\r\n      thinks that there are cases in which master and slave might be\r\n      brought together by a mutual want, each of the other. The former\r\n      wants hands to execute the work of his brain; the latter a guiding\r\n      brain for his hands. Where the degree of dependence corresponds\r\n      exactly to the difference of ability, _Aristotle_, leaving its\r\n      abuses out of the question, declares slavery to be just. See, also,\r\n      Eth. Nicom., VIII, 11. Similarly the Pythagorean _Bryson_ in\r\n      _Stobœus_, Florid. LXXXV, 15. But _Aristotle_ would hold up\r\n      emancipation to all slaves as a reward they might have in prospect.\r\n      Polit VII, 9, 9; Œcon. I, 5. It is characteristic of the many\r\n      testaments of philosophers, found in _Diogenes Laertius_, that they\r\n      contain declarations giving slaves their freedom. The Essenes and\r\n      Therapeutics condemned slavery under all circumstances. _Philo._,\r\n      Opp. II, pp. 458, 482, Opp. I. See _Seneca_, De Benef. III, 20. The\r\n      _jus naturale_ of the age of the Cæsars recognized the freedom and\r\n      equality of man. Digest, XII, 664., L. 17, 32. The New Testament\r\n      does not reject it absolutely, but would sanctify it as well as all\r\n      other relations in life. Compare Luke, 17, 7; Eph. 6 5 ff.; Coloss.\r\n      3, 22; Tit. 2, 9. More especially, I Timothy, VI, 1 ff. It was not\r\n      until the ninth century that the opinion that slavery was\r\n      anti-Christian because men were all made in the image of God, arose.\r\n      _Planck_, Geschichte der kirchlichen Gesellschaftsverfassung, II,\r\n      350. Sachsenspiegel, III, 42. A writer as recent as _Pufendorf_\r\n      explains slavery as arising from a free contract; _faciam, ut des._\r\n      Jus naturæ (1672) VI, 3. More recently _Linguet_, Théorie des Lois\r\n      civiles (1767), V, ch. 30, and _Hugo_, Naturrecht, § 186 ff. have\r\n      endeavored to prove that slaves are in a condition preferable to\r\n      that of poor free men. And so _Möser_ Patriot Phantasien, II,. p.\r\n      154, seq. Those who with _Thaer_ separate the element of production,\r\n      “labor” from that of “intelligence,” justify slavery on the same\r\n      principle that Aristotle did, without knowing it. Per contra, see\r\n      _F. G. Schultze_, N. Œkonomie (1856), 418.\r\n\r\n_  410 Turgot_, Sur la Formation etc., § 21. The universal empire of the\r\n      Romans demonstrated this. Then it was, for instance, that during the\r\n      wars of Lucullus, a slave cost only four drachmas. (_Appian._, Bell.\r\n      Mithr., 78.) _Sardi venales_: on account of the glutting of the\r\n      market with Sardinian slaves, made through the victory of Tib.\r\n      Gracchus, 177, before Christ. Many of the lesser wars of the Romans\r\n      can be looked upon only as slave-hunts. But the great wars also were\r\n      followed by uprisings of slaves on account of the many new slaves\r\n      which they made. Thus 198 in Latium, 196 in Etruria. (_Bücher_,\r\n      Aufstände der unfreien Arbeiter von, 143-129, v. Chr., 1874.) During\r\n      the relatively peaceful periods which preceded many of the Roman\r\n      revolutions, pirates delivered over great masses of slaves. It\r\n      frequently happened that several thousand slaves were led to Delos\r\n      and sold in a single day. (_Strabo_, XIV, 668.) As emancipation was\r\n      a measure which people could not make up their minds to adopt, these\r\n      pirates satisfied a “want” for a time, and this partly explains the\r\n      otherwise incomprehensible forbearance of the state towards them.\r\n\r\n_  411 Gregor.

It is a strange fact that\r\n      prisoners of war were in several remarkable instances sold as slaves\r\n      in Italy during the fifteenth century. (_Sismondi_, Hist. des\r\n      Républiques italiennes, IX, p. 312 seq.; XI, p. 138 seq.) And even\r\n      in the sixteenth century, the pope allowed those of states opposed\r\n      to him to be treated in this way. _Sismondi, supra_, XI, 251; XIII,\r\n      485. _Raynold_, Ann. eccl. 1506, § 25 ff.\r\n\r\n  413 This graduation of slave, serf and workman, has been carried out\r\n      especially by _Saint Simon_, Oeuvres, 328 ff. Even _Proudhon_ admits\r\n      that the condition of the lower classes is better now than formerly.\r\n      (Contradictions économiques, ch. X, 2.) Compare _M. Chevalier_,\r\n      Cours, I. Leçons 1 and 2, where he shows that our productive power\r\n      has increased during the last four or five centuries in the\r\n      production of iron in the proportion of 1 to from 25 to 30; in the\r\n      preparation of flour since the time of Homer in the proportion of\r\n      1:144; in the production of cotton during the last 70 years in the\r\n      proportion of 1:320. _Aristotle_ predicted, long ago, that “when the\r\n      shuttle would move of itself, and plectra of themselves strike the\r\n      lyre, we should need no more slaves.” Polit., 2, 5. Every step of\r\n      true progress brings us nearer the fulfillment of the prophecy.\r\n\r\n  414 The North American planters employed coarse tools rather than fine\r\n      ones, mules rather than horses, because their slaves took so little\r\n      care of them.\r\n\r\n  415 It can never obtain as much labor from the slave, as the fear of\r\n      losing his situation and of not being able to obtain another, will\r\n      from the free workman. (_Hume._) _Marlo_, Weltœkonomie, 1848, I, 2,\r\n      38, grants this to be true only where all the forces of nature are\r\n      appropriated by occupation, and the number of workmen is greater\r\n      than the want of workmen.\r\n\r\n  416 Even in Brazil, only free men are, as a rule, employed as sugar\r\n      refiners, distillers, teamsters etc. (_Koster_, Travels in Brazil,\r\n      1816, 362.) _Storch_, Russland unter Alexander I, Heft, 23, p. 255,\r\n      cites the opinion of an eminent Russian manufacturer, that it would\r\n      first be necessary to liberate the serf factory-hands. Masters have\r\n      generally given up employing their own serfs in manufactures,\r\n      allowed them to seek work for themselves, and only required them to\r\n      pay them a species of tax. When this plan was adopted, it was found\r\n      that they worked much better, (_v. Haxthausen_, Studien I, 61, 116.)\r\n      It was a consequence of slavery that, in antiquity, the very wealthy\r\n      purchased so little: _omnia domi nascuntur_!

The transformation of the serfs into hereditary\r\n      farmers cost _Count Bernstorff_ 100,000 thalers; but the revenue\r\n      derived from his lands increased in consequence, in twenty-four\r\n      years, from 3,000 to 27,000 thalers. An English mower can mow a\r\n      field two and three times as great as a Russian mower in a given\r\n      time.

When\r\n      _Hume_, Discourses, No. 11, Populousness of ancient Nations,\r\n      demonstrates the greater cost of slavery from the fact that the\r\n      master of slaves must either breed or buy them, he forgets that in\r\n      the case of free workmen he is obliged to provide also for the\r\n      support of the workman’s children.

Even the Stoics were not agreed, whether it was right, in case\r\n      of shipwreck, to sacrifice a cheap slave in order to save a valuable\r\n      horse. (_Cicero_, de Off. III, 23.) Whether the self-interest of\r\n      masters is an inducement to the mild treatment of their slaves\r\n      depends on the price for which fresh slaves may be obtained. This is\r\n      a strong reason why a high degree of civilization, where there are\r\n      not counteracting influences, must make slavery less endurable. The\r\n      more valuable slaves are, the worse is their condition. In the\r\n      unfertile Bahamas, the price was £21; in Demarara, £86. In the\r\n      former place they were required to do little work and were well fed\r\n      and well clothed. Hence their numbers have increased there, while in\r\n      Demarara they have decreased. (Edinburgh Rev., XLVI, 496, 180.)\r\n\r\n  425 Proverb: _quot servi totidem hostes._ (_Macrob._, Sat.

The _leno_ of ancient comedy was a slave trader!\r\n      Compare L. 27, Digest, V, 3. In the English negro colonies, it was\r\n      not unusual for the guests of the planters, even in the best\r\n      families, on retiring, to ask the accompanying servant for a girl,\r\n      with as little concern as they would in England for a light.

The children\r\n      of a slave and of a free person were born free. Emancipation was\r\n      considered a Christian act, to be performed for “the salvation of\r\n      one’s soul.” Voluntary slavery was prohibited in 1266, and Magnus\r\n      Erichson forbade slavery generally from the year 1335.

In\r\n      Poland, where all were originally equal land-owners, many sank\r\n      gradually through poverty to the condition of the so-called\r\n      _kinetes_, who, although personally free, were not very far removed\r\n      from slaves. Beginning with the thirteenth century, a great number\r\n      of immunities, after the model of those accorded in Germany, were\r\n      granted, by means of which they lost, for the most part, their\r\n      direct subjection to the emperor and the empire alone. This was soon\r\n      followed as a consequence by their personal oppression. (_Röpell_,\r\n      Geschichte von Polen, I, p. 308 seq., and p. 570 seq.) In Bohemia,\r\n      the old form of serfdom had so far disappeared in the fourteenth\r\n      century, that it might be said it was known only to history. But\r\n      during the reign of the weak king, Ladislaus II, a new species of\r\n      serfdom came into vogue, the result of the preponderance of the\r\n      aristocratic element. _Palacky_, Gesch. von Böhmen, II, p. 33 seq.;\r\n      III, 31 seq. Aristocratic Denmark, before the peasant war of\r\n      1255-1258, subjected the free peasantry who had been leaseholders\r\n      for a term of years to unlimited socage duty. Waldemar III, reduced\r\n      to the same kind of service the land-owning peasantry, which\r\n      especially from the date of Margaret’s reign, developed into a\r\n      species of _glebæ adscriptio_. From the sixteenth century, when the\r\n      royal power almost disappeared, these public privileges were\r\n      abandoned to the nobility to such an extent that, in 1650, there\r\n      were scarcely 5,000 free peasants. _Dahlmann_, III, p. 73 seq.\r\n      However the severity of _traeldom_ made way in the fourteenth\r\n      century for the _vornedskap_ (modified bondage), a milder species of\r\n      vassalage. See _Kolderup Rosenvinge_, Grundriss der dänischen\r\n      Rechtsgeschichte, § 94.\r\n\r\n  433 The French expression _mainmorte_ comes originally from the\r\n      deprivation of the right of inheritance. In Beaumanoir’s time, 1283,\r\n      it was customary, after a number of serfs had lived together for a\r\n      year and a day, for their chattels movable to become the common\r\n      property of the community. (_Warnkönig_, Französische\r\n      Rechtsgeschichte, II, 157.)\r\n\r\n  434 In France, Louis X. made it a fiscal speculation to sell serfs their\r\n      liberty in whole districts, even against their will. His edict,\r\n      Ordonnances, I, 583, recognizes that all men are by nature free, and\r\n      that France is not without reason called the land of the Franks etc.\r\n      Even in 1298, Philip IV. had exchanged the serfdom to the crown of\r\n      several provinces for a land duty. The last ruler of Dauphiny gave\r\n      all the serfs of the crown their liberty gratis, in 1394.\r\n      (_Sugenheim_, p. 130.) When the so-called _coutumes_ were written,\r\n      there were only nine provincees in which by local law serfdom was\r\n      permitted. The defeat of the _jacquerie_ injured the cause of\r\n      emancipation in France in the same way that the suppression of the\r\n      war of the peasants did in Germany. About 1779, _mainmorte_ was\r\n      abolished in all lands of the crown, and its proof made almost\r\n      impossible in all others. (_Warnkönig_, II, 151 seq.) Yet it is said\r\n      that there were 150,000 _serfs de corps_ in France in 1789.\r\n      (_Cassagnac_, Causes de la Revolution, III, 11.) Koloman, who died\r\n      in 1114, forbade the slave trade in Hungary, and labored to raise\r\n      all Christian slaves to _conditionarii_ (renters). But the right of\r\n      migration was abolished in 1351. King Sigismund, and still more,\r\n      Matthias Corvinus, restored it, after the suppression of the war of\r\n      the peasants, but in 1514 it was again lost until 1586. Further\r\n      progress was arrested until the Urbarium of Maria Theresa.\r\n\r\n  435 In Italy, Frederick II. liberated all the serfs of the crown.\r\n      (Constitutt. Regni Sicil., 164.) A model instance of emancipation at\r\n      Bologna in 1256. The serfs of the state were simply set at liberty;\r\n      the freedom of those of private persons was purchased with the money\r\n      of the state, and a small corn-tithe laid on the emancipated as a\r\n      compensation for the expense incurred in their behalf. In the\r\n      future, there was not to be a bondman on Bologna territory. The\r\n      motives which led to this measure are a strange admixture of\r\n      Christianity and Democracy. (_Muzzi_, Annali di Bologna, 1840, I,\r\n      479.) Italy, at the end of the fourteenth century, was entirely free\r\n      from Christian serfdom. (_Muratori_, Antt. Ital., I, 798.) In the\r\n      canton of Berne, Switzerland, slavery was gradually abolished, the\r\n      process commencing about the beginning of the fifteenth century. It\r\n      continued, however, in the case of ordinary masters until 1798.\r\n      _Sugenheim_, p. 530 seq. In England, Alfred the Great’s efforts\r\n      towards the gradual abolition of slavery (_Wilkins_, Leges, 29)\r\n      remained without result. The steps taken by William I, towards a\r\n      much narrower end, however, seem to have been more successful.\r\n      (Leges Will. Conq., 225, 229; _Turner_, Hist. of England, I, 135.)\r\n      From the time of the Norman conquest, prisoners of war ceased to\r\n      recruit the ranks of slavery. Under Henry III and Edward I, socage\r\n      tenants became more and more frequent; but, before long, their\r\n      duties became less onerous, and might be discharged by others hired\r\n      for the purpose, instead of by themselves. The first remarkable\r\n      vestige of a class working for wages is met with in the law of 1351,\r\n      which may be considered an effort made by the nobility to oppose the\r\n      tendencies in favor of emancipation, which were a consequence of the\r\n      development of cities. (_Eden_, State of the Poor, I, 7, 12, 30,\r\n      41,) _Infra_, § 175. Although the peasant war under Wat Tyler and\r\n      Straw, who wished to abolish servitude at a blow, failed of its\r\n      object, we find that there were a great many instances of\r\n      emancipation by individuals in the fourteenth and fifteenth\r\n      centuries when death or sickness overtook them, in which they\r\n      declared the moral unfitness of slavery. (_Wycliffe_: “When Adam\r\n      dalve and Eve span, who was then the gentleman?”) Elizabeth\r\n      liberated the last serfs of the crown. Compare 12 Charles II, ch.\r\n      24, 1660. Emancipation in the lowlands of Scotland was completed in\r\n      1574. (_Tytler_, Hist. of Scotland, II, 260.)\r\n\r\n  436 Modern Emancipation Laws: in Prussia, 1719, 1807, 1819; Lausitz;\r\n      1820, Westphalia; in Austria, 1781 (Bohemia and Moravia), 1782\r\n      (other German countries and Galicia); 1785 (Hungaria);\r\n      Schleswig-Holstein, 1804, after many of the landed gentry had\r\n      voluntarily emancipated their own serfs; in Bavaria, in 1808; in the\r\n      kingdom of Westphalia, in 1808; in Hessen-Darmstadt, in 1811; in\r\n      Württemberg, in 1817; in Baden, in 1783, 1820 in newly acquired\r\n      countries; in Mecklenburg, in 1820; in the kingdom of Saxony, in\r\n      1832; in Hanover, in 1833. The law of 1702, abolishing serfdom in\r\n      Denmark, was evaded until 1788, and in part, even until 1800 by the\r\n      _Schollband_ (clod-bond) introduced in its stead. The only Christian\r\n      people in Europe, who, until recently, kept serfs, was the Russian.\r\n      The serfs of Russia, in 1834, numbered 22,000,000, i.e., about 40\r\n      per cent. of the entire population. In the meantime, the law of\r\n      February 19, 1861, passed after four years of preparation, fixed the\r\n      date of emancipation at the beginning of the year 1863. Slavery has\r\n      been abolished in the United States since January 1, 1863; first of\r\n      all in all portions of the country engaged in rebellion.\r\n\r\n  437 There is a very interesting discussion in the Journ. des Economistes\r\n      for June 1863, of the question whether the owners of serfs are\r\n      entitled to compensation on their emancipation, by _Laboulaye_,\r\n      _Wolowski_, _Lavergne_, _Garnier_, _Simon_ and others. In the United\r\n      States it would have required $2,000,000,000 to fully compensate the\r\n      slave-holders for depriving them of their slaves. (Quart. R., Jan.,\r\n      1874, 142.) Compare my view, _Roscher_, Nationalökonomi des\r\n      Ackerbaues, § 124.\r\n\r\n  438 Leave a new-born child to its “natural freedom” for twenty-four\r\n      hours, and it will in all probability be dead at the end of the\r\n      time!\r\n\r\n  439 Compare Edinburgh Review, LXXXIII, 64 ff., April, 1851, 333.\r\n      _Klein’s_ Annalen XXV, 70, ff. Even in the fifth book of Moses, 15,\r\n      13, ff., we see that experience had taken into consideration that a\r\n      freed serf without capital or landed property might very readily be\r\n      in a worse condition than he was before. In the United States, the\r\n      anticipation that the emancipated negroes might diminish in numbers\r\n      has not been realized. The census of 1870 showed a negro population\r\n      of 4,880,000, nearly ten per cent. more than in 1860. The increase\r\n      of the number of churches, schools and savings banks also bears\r\n      testimony to the prosperity of the negro. (_R.

In the “Frogs” of\r\n      Aristophanes, the relation between the slave Xanthias and his master\r\n      is eloquent testimony to the good treatment he received.

Aristoph._ Equitt. 1309. _Plutarch_, Thes. 36.)\r\n\r\n  443 Slaves might purchase their own freedom with their _peculium_. See\r\n      Petit. Legg., Art. II, 179. There were many who lived entirely on\r\n      their own account, paying a certain duty or tax to their masters,\r\n      and who were well able to make savings. _R. F. Hermann_,\r\n      Privatalterthümer, § 13, 9, 58, 11 ff. See the instance in _Plato_,\r\n      De Rep.

(_Philostr._ Apoll.\r\n      VIII, 7, 12.) The case cited in _Demosth_. adv. Nicostr. 1249 ff.,\r\n      is all the stronger on this account.\r\n\r\n  444 Under Cleomenes, many purchased their freedom with their own means.\r\n      _Plutarch_, Cleom. 23.

I, 1. It was customary to promise slaves\r\n      their freedom as soon as they had acquired a certain _peculium_.\r\n      (_Dionys. Hal._, Antt. Rom., IV, 24. _Tac._, Ann., XIV, 42.) Humane\r\n      masters permitted their slaves to dispose freely of their _peculium_\r\n      by will. (_Plin._, Ep., VIII, 16.) There were many of the Romans who\r\n      gave their slaves a fixed salary, from which they could make\r\n      savings. (_Senec._, Epist., 80, 7.) Shepherds raised some sheep for\r\n      themselves alone. (_Plaut._, Asin., III, 1, 36; _Varro_, R. R., I,\r\n      17, 7.) Premiums were offered for certain products (_Athen._, VI,\r\n      274 d), and there were cases even in which businesses were farmed\r\n      out to slaves. (Corp. Inscr. Gr., No. 4,713 f.) The _servi publici_\r\n      had the right to dispose of the half of what they owned, by will.\r\n      (_Ulpian_, XX, 16.) Contracts of loan were sometimes made between\r\n      master and slave. (_Plut._, Cato, I, 21, L., 49, § 2, Digest, XV,\r\n      1.)\r\n\r\n  449 Compare _Tacit._, Ann., XIII, 26 seq.

The high prices, 100,000, and even 200,000 sesterces,\r\n      paid for slaves, suppose a very high degree of education.\r\n      (_Martial_, I, 59; III, 62; XI, 70; _Seneca_, Ep., 27.) But even\r\n      _Cicero_ was ashamed of his affliction over the death of an\r\n      exceptionally clever slave. (Ad. Att., I, 12.)\r\n\r\n  451 At an earlier period, even the censor had punished cruel masters.\r\n      But most of what was done to prevent the arbitrary condemnation to\r\n      death of slaves, their castration etc., and to give them rights\r\n      against their masters for libidinous acts towards them, for cruelty\r\n      and insufficient support, or the furnishing them with bad food, was\r\n      done after the time of Hadrian. (Compare _Seneca_, de Benef., III,\r\n      22; de Ira, III, 40, _Sueton._, Claud, 25, Dom., 7; _Spartian._,\r\n      Hadr., 18; _Gaius_, I, 53; L., 1, § 2, Digest, I, 6; L., 1, § 8, D.,\r\n      I, 12; L., 1, § 2, D., XLVII, 8; L., 1; Cod., IX, 14; Contra, see\r\n      _Dio Cass_, I, V, 17.)

For Attica alone, the\r\n      estimates vary between 110,000 (_Letronne_, in the Mem. de\r\n      I’Académie des Inscr., 1822, 192, ff.) and 400,000 (_Athen._ 1. c.),\r\n      while the free men are estimated at from 130,000 to 150,000. In\r\n      Rome, during the time from the expulsion of the kings until the\r\n      destruction of Carthage, the number of the slaves remained about the\r\n      same. (_Blair_, State of Slavery among the Romans, 1833, 10, 15.) On\r\n      the other hand, _Dureau de la Malle_ is of opinion, that in 576\r\n      B.C., the number of slaves was to the number of free men as 1 to 25,\r\n      and in 225 B.C. (including the metics), as 22 to 27. (Economie\r\n      polit. des Romains I 270 ff., 296.) Compare _Cato_, de Re. rust. I,\r\n      3, IV, X, 1 XI; 1, XVII, XVIII, 1. In Germany, the number of\r\n      bondmen, from the eighth to the tenth century, was estimated to be\r\n      at least as great as that of free men. (_Grimm_, D.\r\n      Rechtsaltherthümer, 334.) Among the Anglo Saxons, before the Norman\r\n      conquest, it was much higher, even three-fourths of the entire\r\n      population. (_Turner_, Hist. of the A. S., VIII, 9.)

(I, 2, 15 ed., Bas.) Frederick\r\n      the Great’s ordinance of 1769, on this subject, forbade any one to\r\n      enter into service for a shorter time than this (II, § 1 ff.), while\r\n      the Saxon ordinance of 1835, on the same matter, allowed engagements\r\n      by the month, in cities. _Darjes_, Erste Gründe der\r\n      Cameralwissenschaften, 2d ed. (1768), p. 432, demands that servants\r\n      should always hire themselves for at least four or five years, and\r\n      that their masters should have, during the whole of this time, the\r\n      right to enforce the contract. In North America, however, service by\r\n      the month has become customary and general, and no notice of the\r\n      dissolution of the contract is, as a rule, required.

In Switzerland, contracts for\r\n      service by the week are frequently made even by country servants.\r\n      (_Böhmert_, Arbeiterverhh., II, 157.)\r\n\r\n  456 In the south of England, farm hands were used to change service only\r\n      at Michaelmas. The choice of such a date made farmers very dependent\r\n      on them, as it fell in harvest time. (_Marshall_, Rural Economy of\r\n      the Southern Countries, II, 233.) A similar complaint in Cleves.\r\n      (_Schwerz_, Rheinischwestphälische Landw., 21 ff.) In Jülich, a half\r\n      year’s notice was required, during which time the servant who had\r\n      received it, performed his work with disgust, and stirred up his\r\n      fellow servants against their master. (_Schwerz_, II, 87.)\r\n\r\n  457 The families of day laborers, to whom the owner of the land gives\r\n      the use of a house, small garden, a cow etc., constitute such a\r\n      transition; and also, workmen who are fed. In Brandenburg, in 1644,\r\n      only married persons or widowers with children were permitted to\r\n      work as day laborers. (_Mylius, C. C. March._, V, 1, 3, 11.)\r\n\r\n_  458 Wakefield_, Swing Unmasked, or the Causes of rural Incendiarism,\r\n      1831.\r\n\r\n  459 By means of the former, the number of independent small householders\r\n      was much increased in the country. Masters feel indisposed to hire\r\n      young men liable to be subjected to military duty, because they may\r\n      be called away at the moment their services are most needed. The\r\n      returning soldier, as a rule, feels above doing menial service.\r\n      (_Schwerz_, passim, I, 191 ff., 236.) On this account, servants’\r\n      wages in Cleves rose much higher than those of day laborers. (194.)\r\n      In Belgium, a farm hand cost, on an average, 400 francs a year; a\r\n      day laborer, counting 300 working days to the year, only 339 francs.\r\n      (_Horn_, Statist. Gemälde, 175.) In the Palatinate, day laborers who\r\n      receive nothing but their wages cost their masters less than those\r\n      who receive only their food; and servants are the dearest of all.\r\n      (_Hanssen,_ Archiv der Politischen Œkonomie, N. F. X, 243.) If\r\n      servants were relatively more poorly paid in 1813 than day laborers\r\n      (_Lotz_, Revision, III, 147), it was because of the at least\r\n      temporary retrogression of civilization which every great war\r\n      causes.\r\n\r\n_  460 Engel_, Preuss. Statist. Jahrb., II, 261. Services which contribute\r\n      to personal convenience are naturally committed much less frequently\r\n      to independent day laborers than those which aid in production\r\n      proper. Hence it is, that, as civilization advances, house-servants,\r\n      especially of the female sex, constitute an ever-increasing portion\r\n      of the total number of servants. In Prussia, in 1816, the number of\r\n      servants who ministered to personal comfort was only 4.19 per cent.\r\n      of the total number of servants engaged in industry; of female\r\n      servants, it was 13.4 per cent. In 1861, on the other hand, the\r\n      percentages were 8.4 and 37.2. In Great Britain, of the total number\r\n      of servants over 20 years of age, only 2 per cent. were engaged in\r\n      personal services. In 1841, they were 3-½ per cent. (_Meidinger_.)\r\n      In France, in 1851, 2.5 per cent. of the whole population were in\r\n      _domesticité_.

The\r\n      _Gesindeordnung_ (service regulation) of Frederick the Great,\r\n      threatened with the house of correction the receivers, and under\r\n      certain circumstances also the givers of wages higher than the fixed\r\n      rate of wages; but as a “matter of course,” the payment of wages\r\n      less than this was permitted. (V, § 7) Great care was taken that\r\n      wages greater than the law allowed should not be evaded by the\r\n      payment of _arrha_ or payment in produce. The same law forbade the\r\n      deprivation of the servant of his right to determine the service by\r\n      making of loans to him on long time (II, § 7.) Even _v. Berg_,\r\n      Handbuch des deutschen Polizeirechts, calls it a duty of the public\r\n      authorities charged with the protection of property and of the\r\n      public security, to see to it that there be no lack of good\r\n      servants, and that the public (as if those who sell their services\r\n      were not a part of it) should not be made the victims of exorbitant\r\n      demands in the matter of servants’ wages. _Jung_, more humane,\r\n      demands that the authorities shall protect, especially, the weaker\r\n      party. (Grundlehre der Staatswirthschaft, 1792, 700.) In Prussian\r\n      legislation, the Silesian rescript of March 13, 1809, is the\r\n      beginning of the new order of things. (_Rabe_, Samml. preuss.\r\n      Gesetze, X, 59 ff.) The _Obertribunal_, or high court, decided, in\r\n      1874, that the bringing back of absconding servants by the police,\r\n      which the law concerning servants of 1810 provided for, should not\r\n      be allowed to occur any more.\r\n\r\n  464 Ordinance of the elector of Saxony of 1766, prohibiting the\r\n      inhabitants of cities to take an apprentice from among the\r\n      peasantry, unless he had served at least four years as a farm hand,\r\n      beginning with his fourteenth year.

Mendelssohn_,\r\n      Jerusalem (1783), 32; _Thiers_, Du Droit de la Propriété (1849).\r\n\r\n  470 Modern writers, in their attempt to find a philosophical basis for\r\n      the right of property, have taken two principal directions, the\r\n      first a juridical, the second a political one. The axiom, _res\r\n      nullius cedit primo occupanti_ (compare L. 3, Digest, XLI, 1),\r\n      explains only the smallest part of the relations of property, and\r\n      that only because of a very fortuitous circumstance. According to\r\n      _Hobbes_ (Leviathan, 24), property has its origin in the recognition\r\n      of it by the power of the state, by the _autorité publique_, the\r\n      _gouvernement_ (_Bossuet_, Politique tirée de l’Ecriture, Sainte, L.\r\n      3, 4), or as _Montesquieu_ (Esprit des Lois XXVI., 15) more mildly\r\n      expresses it, in the laws. The application of this principle would,\r\n      on account of the extreme changeableness of the laws of every state,\r\n      lead to most extreme insecurity, and to a steady oscillation from\r\n      one Utopia to another, from one revolution to another, if it were\r\n      not, at the same time, recognized that each one had a just title to\r\n      the acquisitions he had made, not because the law, for the time\r\n      being existing, acknowledged the right, but because they were the\r\n      product of his labor and saving. The theory which bases the right of\r\n      property on contract cannot be objected to with as much reason.\r\n      Thus, _Hugo Grotius_, Jus Belli et Pacis, II, 2, who even justifies\r\n      the occupation of things without an owner, on the supposition of the\r\n      existence of an implied contract. It is very characteristic of the\r\n      English, that in their political language, the words “liberty” and\r\n      “property” are so frequently found in each other’s company. In one\r\n      of his classic speeches made by Fox in 1784, he gives a definition\r\n      of liberty which begins with the words, “It consists in the safe and\r\n      sacred possession of a man’s property” etc. The recent doctrine, not\r\n      unfrequently to be met with, that every man has a right to an amount\r\n      of property corresponding to his wants, may be used to sanction all\r\n      kinds of socialistic inferences. An entirely bewildered and\r\n      bewildering description is to be found in _Proudhon’s_ Qu’est ce que\r\n      la Propriété, 1848, as the precursor of which _Brissot’s_ Recherches\r\n      philosophiques sur le Droit de Propriété et le Vol, may be\r\n      considered. In medieval times, there are always a multitude of other\r\n      titles to property besides production and saving. The title which is\r\n      held in highest esteem for the time being is always because of this\r\n      very extreme vis-a-vis of all other titles, strengthened and made\r\n      general.\r\n\r\n  471 The word socialism brought into use by _L. Reybaud_ is as ambiguous\r\n      as the word communism is simple and intelligible. But most\r\n      socialists agree that actual “society” (which is indeed to be\r\n      distinguished from the state) is, together with its foundations, the\r\n      existing relations of property and the family, entirely wrong. A\r\n      radical reconstruction, they say, is needed to remove forever the\r\n      chief evil of this system, viz.: the glaring difference between the\r\n      rich and the poor, the educated and the uneducated. The difference\r\n      between the doctrines of the socialists and of Political Economy\r\n      does not, by any means, consist in this, that the former concerns\r\n      itself more with the welfare of the lower classes, or even that it\r\n      gives wider scope to economy in common. But socialism is, indeed, a\r\n      living or housekeeping in common (_Gemeinwirthschaft_), which goes\r\n      far beyond the feeling for the common interest (_Gemeinsinn_). Such\r\n      economy in common is always opposed to freedom, and, at its first\r\n      introduction, contrary to law. It can guarantee no compensation to\r\n      those who have suffered from violence or force, because it leads to\r\n      a thoughtless and wasteful exhaustion of the nation’s resources,\r\n      inasmuch as it weakens the incentive to industry and frugality.\r\n      Political Economy, on the other hand, recommends an _expropriation_\r\n      when the incentives to industry and frugality are thereby\r\n      strengthened; and the increased resources thus obtained serve it, as\r\n      full compensation to those whose property has been _expropriated_.\r\n\r\n  472 See _Roscher_, Betrachtungen über Socialismus und Communismus,\r\n      Berliner Zeitschrift für Geschichtwissenschaft, 1845, III, 422 ff.\r\n\r\n_  473 Vivre en travaillant ou mourir en combattant_—the device on the\r\n      flags of the mutinous silk-weavers at Lyons, in 1832.\r\n\r\n  474 We are so assured by _Vauban_ (Dime Royale, 34 seq), of the later\r\n      years of the reign of Louis XIV, that nearly 1/10 of the French\r\n      people begged, that 5/10 could give no alms, because they were\r\n      themselves on the very brink of indigence; 3/10 were _fort malaisés,\r\n      embarassés de dettes et de procès_; scarcely one per cent. could be\r\n      said to be _fort à leur aise_. How much better off is the present\r\n      Parisian workman! And yet, at that time, there was not the least\r\n      spread of communistic doctrines. It is indeed seldom that completely\r\n      down-trodden men react against their wretchedness with great energy.\r\n\r\n  475 “If my _caprice_ be the source of law, then my _enjoyment_ may be\r\n      the source of the division of the nation’s resources.” _Stahl_,\r\n      Rechtsphilosophie, II, 2, 72.\r\n\r\n  476 That the socialism of _Plato_, De Repub., V, was no mere fancy, is\r\n      proved by the polemic which _Aristophanes_ directs against it in his\r\n      Ecclesiazuses. See also _Aristot._, Polit., II, 2, Schn. In the\r\n      contemporary practice of the Greeks, with the increasing\r\n      democratization of the state, it became more and more usual for it\r\n      to bear the expense of the outlay for the means of subsistence of\r\n      the great crowd. (See _Plutarch_, Cimo, 10.) Every act of public\r\n      life was paid for. Citizens were paid for attending popular meetings\r\n      three oboli per day, while the pay of the soldiers was six, and that\r\n      of the sailors three. (_Thucyd._, III, 17; VII, 27; VIII, 45.) The\r\n      pay of the commonest day laborer was from three to four oboli per\r\n      day. _Aristophan._, Eccl., 310, and _Pollux_, VII, 29. The number of\r\n      magistrates was very large, in order that as many as possible might\r\n      participate in this species of remuneration. Thus, in Athens, when\r\n      it had only about 20,000 inhabitants, there were 6,000 judges. In\r\n      addition to all this, there were numberless feasts, plays, banquets\r\n      etc., which were offered to the people gratis. The wealthy who were\r\n      compelled to meet all the expense thus incurred, lived in such a\r\n      state of terror of the populace, that they considered their own\r\n      impoverishment as a species of deliverance. (_Xenoph._, Conviv., 4,\r\n      and _Lysias_, pro Bonis.) _Isocrates_ called it much more dangerous\r\n      to be rich than to commit a crime, since in the latter case one\r\n      might obtain a pardon or a mild punishment. (De Permut., p. 160.)\r\n      (_Lysias_, De Invalido, de sacra Olea, seq.) There is little\r\n      difference between this state of things and a semi-community of\r\n      goods. Only that, indeed, the great mass of the slaves were excluded\r\n      from enjoying them. The contrast which somewhat later distinguished\r\n      the Cynics from the Cyreno-Epicureans affords a striking analogy to\r\n      that which, in our own times, exists between the pure socialists and\r\n      the worshipers of mammon after the fashion of Doctor Ure. Concerning\r\n      the Utopia of _Iambulos_, see _Diodor._, II, 55 ff.\r\n\r\n  477 Our sources of information concerning the division of the Roman\r\n      republic into a moneyed oligarchy, and the proletariat are very\r\n      numerous. Compare _infra_, § 205. The speeches of the Gracchi (e.g.\r\n      _Plut._, T. Gracchus, 9), and still more the violent discourses of\r\n      Catiline’s conspiracy (_Sallust_, Cat., 20, 23, 37-39), remind us\r\n      very forcibly of the shibboleths of modern socialism. We very\r\n      frequently meet with the expression of a longing desire to return to\r\n      the most uncivilized and hoary past, when there was no money and no\r\n      wealth—an aspiration which lies at the very foundation of communism.\r\n      Thus _Virgil_, Geo., I, 125, ff., _Tibull._ I, 3, 35, ff. _Propert._\r\n      II, 13, III, 5, 11; _Seneca_, Epist., 90; _Senec._, Oct. II,\r\n      _Hippol._, II, 2; _Plin._, H. N. XXXII, 3. On the other hand, the\r\n      practice of supporting the populace at the expense of great\r\n      candidates or of the state, was developed to a very great extent.\r\n      The masses lived very largely by the sale of their right of suffrage\r\n      to the highest bidder. At the election of consuls in the year 54,\r\n      500,000 thalers were offered to the century called on to vote first.\r\n      (_Cicero_, ad Quintum II, 15; ad. A.H. IV, 15.) Even _Cato_ had a\r\n      part in such bribery. (_Sueton._, Caes., 19.) In the social reform\r\n      of the younger Gracchus, besides the limitation of large\r\n      land-ownership, the principal points were the following: the sale of\r\n      wheat under the market price, but only to the inhabitants of Rome\r\n      itself; the construction of great highways in Italy; colonization at\r\n      the expense of the state, and the increase of soldiers’ pay.\r\n      (_Ritsch_, Gracchen, 392 ff.) The socialistic plans of Rullus went\r\n      much further. Were his agrarian laws put in execution, he would have\r\n      confiscated very nearly the entire country in the interest of the\r\n      poor, and of their demagogues! (_Cicero_, De Lege agrar.) Rome twice\r\n      experienced a social revolution of the most frightful character, one\r\n      by which a great portion of all private goods fell into the hands of\r\n      the propertyless (soldiers), who knew nothing of how to turn it to\r\n      account or to invest it—under Sulla, and then under the later\r\n      Triumviri. (Compare _Appian_, Bell, civil., V, 5, 22.) Complaints\r\n      concerning the latter, in _Horat._, Epist., I, 2, 49; _Virgil_,\r\n      Buc., IX, 28; _Tibull._ I, 1, 19, IV, 1, 182; _Propert._, IV, 1,\r\n      129. The elder Gracchus had promised compensation to the last\r\n      possessors. _Tabulæ novæ_ of Cinna, Catiline, Cælius, Dolebella.\r\n      Clodius introduced the distribution of wheat, which according to\r\n      Cicero pro Sext., 25, ate up almost one-fifth of the public\r\n      revenues. About 320,000 persons were, in this way, supported for a\r\n      long period of time (_Sueton._, Caes, 41, _Dio C._, XLIII, 21; L.\r\n      LV, 10), but only in such a manner as to keep them from starvation.\r\n      (_Sallust_, 268 ed. Bip.) To all this was soon added distributions\r\n      of salt, meal and oil, also free baths, numberless public plays,\r\n      colossal banqueting, payment of one year’s rent etc. _Panem et\r\n      circenses!_ (Juvenal, X, 80 seq.) The mere distribution of money\r\n      under Augustus, in which from 200,000 to 320,000 men participated,\r\n      cost each time from 2,500,000 to 6,000,000 thalers. (Monum Ancyr.,\r\n      372 Wolf.) Extraordinary assistance was, by way of preference,\r\n      accorded to colonies of the poor. (_Sueton._, Caes, 42.) Concerning\r\n      this entire policy, see _Plin._, Paneg., 26 ff. Even in\r\n      Constantinople, at the time of its foundation, large distributions\r\n      of bread were made at the expense of Egypt, although there could\r\n      scarcely be any real pauperism in that new and flourishing city.\r\n      (_Theod._, Cod., XIII, 4, XIV 16; _Socrat._, II, 13.) I can only\r\n      allude to the plan proposed by the emperor Gallien by the\r\n      neo-platonist Plotin, to found a city in which the ideas of Plato’s\r\n      republic should be carried out. (Porphyr., V, Plotin., 8.)\r\n\r\n  478 During the two centuries of which the Reformation constituted the\r\n      middle point, the transition from the peasant system of agriculture\r\n      to the large farming system of modern times bore very heavily on the\r\n      inferior classes. Such, too, was the operation of the fall in price\r\n      of the precious metals. (§ 140.) The suppression of the many\r\n      monasteries caused an increase in the wretchedness of the poor; and\r\n      the numerous poor-laws enacted in England, Spain etc., were not\r\n      sufficient to supply a remedy. The feeling of the people during this\r\n      period of tribulation found expression in the War of the Peasants,\r\n      in the sect of Anabaptists, in the many reformations and\r\n      counter-reformations, in the revolt of the Netherlands, in the\r\n      conflicts for the crown in France and England etc. In Italy, the\r\n      contrast existing between the moneyed oligarchy and the proletariat\r\n      had been developed several centuries, but from the middle of the\r\n      sixteenth century, it had become much more oppressive by reason of\r\n      the universal impoverishment of the country. For an account of the\r\n      pantheistic “Brethren and Sisters of the Free Spirit,” with their\r\n      community of goods and of women, see _Ullmann_, Reformatoren vor der\r\n      Reformation, II, 18 ff. They were very numerous from the thirteenth\r\n      to the fifteenth century in Italy and France, as well as in Germany,\r\n      and lead us to the Adamites in the Hussite war. (_Aschbach_,\r\n      Geschichte K. Sigismunds, III, 109.) Earlier yet, we have the sect\r\n      of the Giovannali, who had their property and women in common, and\r\n      who, in 1355, had won the third of Corsica, but who were afterwards\r\n      suppressed by Genoa and the Church. (_Lebret_, Geschichte von\r\n      Italien, VI, 208 ff.) The coarse socialist, _John Balle_, bears\r\n      about the same relation to Wycliffe, that Münzer and Bockholt did to\r\n      Luther. (_Walsingham_, Hist. Angliæ in _Camden, Scriptt._, 275.)\r\n      Hans Böheim of Würzburg, 1476, seems to be the direct precursor of\r\n      Münzer. (_Ullmann_, I, 421 ff.) It was almost as usual in Luther’s\r\n      time, as in 1848, or in our day, to hear of the deep demoralization\r\n      of trade—the _Fuggerei_ of the Germany of the time—and of the\r\n      universal system of fraud that prevailed. See the citations in\r\n      _Hagen_, Deutschland’s Verhältnisse im Reform-Zeitalter, II, 313 ff.\r\n      Münzer’s fundamental principle: _Omnia simul communia!_ _Sebastian\r\n      Frank_, Chronica, Zeytbuch und Geschychtbibel etc., 1551, fol. VI,\r\n      16, 27, 116, 194, 414, 433. John Bockholt’s life presents us with a\r\n      striking contrast. While they were bringing his perfumed women,\r\n      sparkling with jewels, to his rose-covered bed, hung with curtains\r\n      of gold cloth, on which he was reclining, his subjects were a prey\r\n      to the horrors of famine, to such an extent that they were compelled\r\n      to salt the bodies of children who had died of starvation. How\r\n      frightful the end of this communistic benefactor of mankind!\r\n      Libertine community of goods and women. (_Calvin_, Instructio adv.\r\n      Libertinos, cap. 21.)

Even under Cromwell, there were many Englishmen who believed\r\n      that farmers were no longer obliged to pay rent to land-owners. On\r\n      the sect of Levellers, see _Walker_, History of the Independency,\r\n      II, 152. Even in _Erasmus_, we find some sympathy with communism.\r\n      (Enchirid. milit. Christ, 80.) _Contra_, see _Melanchthon_, Prolegg.\r\n      in Cic. de Off., Corp. Reform, XVI, 549 ff. The most remarkable\r\n      systematic works of this period are _Thomas More’s_, Utopia, 1516,\r\n      and _Campanella’s_ Civitas, solis, 1620. _Thomas More_ bluntly says\r\n      that all existing governments are in fact only permanent\r\n      conspiracies of the rich to further their own interests under the\r\n      mask of the common good, and to despoil labor. The abolition of\r\n      money, which should be continued in use only to carry on foreign\r\n      war, would, he contends, remove all misery. There was no really\r\n      private property in his Utopia. There should be a rigid\r\n      superintendence of all work by the public authorities, whose duty it\r\n      should be to see to it, that no one should abandon agricultural\r\n      pursuits. All should eat at a common table and dress after the same\r\n      fashion. Internal commerce should give way to a mutual exchange of\r\n      gifts under the supervision of the state. _Campanella_, besides a\r\n      community of goods, recommends continually varying occupation, to\r\n      last not more than four hours daily; education in common, especially\r\n      by means of pictures, popular encyclopedias etc., all under the\r\n      supreme guidance of a despotism to be composed of the wise, some\r\n      secular and some spiritual, operating through the confessional.\r\n      Socialists nearly always succeed better in the critical part of\r\n      their works than in the positive. Compare _R. Mohl_, Geschichte und\r\n      Literatur der Staatswissenschaften, § 1, 165 ff.\r\n\r\n  479 Considering the aversion exhibited against private property by _J.\r\n      J. Rousseau_, and the unlimited power which he accords to the\r\n      majority for the time being in the state (Contrat Social, 1761, II,\r\n      ch. 4), it cannot be denied that his freedom and equality contain,\r\n      to say the least, germs of communism by no means insignificant. But,\r\n      he would, in the present state of civil society, have a feeling of\r\n      respect for the rights of property implanted in the mind of the\r\n      child very early, and even before the feeling of liberty is\r\n      developed. (Emile, 1762, Livre II.) About the same time _Morelly_\r\n      published his Basiliade ou Naufrage des Iles flottantes, 1753, a\r\n      political romance in the interest of communism. See the same\r\n      author’s Code de la Nature, 1755. _Mably_, in his two works, Doutes\r\n      proposés aux Economistes, 1768, and La Législation ou Principes des\r\n      Lois, 1776, recommended the abolition of all inequality and a real\r\n      community of goods. The introduction of property seems to him, _une\r\n      faute qu’il était presque impossible de faire_. Even _Beccaria_\r\n      calls property a dreadful but perhaps a necessary right which has\r\n      left to the unfortunate nothing but a naked existence. (Dei Delitti\r\n      e delle Pene, 1765, cap. 22.) The French Reign of Terror came pretty\r\n      near carrying these ideas into effect. We need only refer to the\r\n      abolition of the census, the payments made to the workingmen who\r\n      attended the section meetings, two francs per diem, the enormous\r\n      extension of confiscation, requisitions and forced loans, the\r\n      revolution effected in the fortunes of individuals by the system of\r\n      issuing assignats, the maximum affixed to the price of all the\r\n      necessaries of life, the abolition of indirect taxes, and of what\r\n      remained of the economic institutions handed down from the middle\r\n      ages. According to _St. Just_: _l’opulence est une infamie; il ne\r\n      faut ni riches ni pauvres_. The Cahier des Pauvres demands, first of\r\n      all, that salaries “should no longer be estimated in accordance with\r\n      the murderous principles of unbridled luxury.” See Forster’s letter\r\n      dated November 15, 1793. (Sämmtl. Schriften, IX, 125.) On the\r\n      conspiracy of Baboeuf, who was executed in 1796, and who wanted to\r\n      see the completest equality and community of labor, of enjoyment and\r\n      education, the abolition of large cities etc., see _Buonarotti_, La\r\n      Conjuration de B., 1821. This book contributed powerfully towards\r\n      the revival of communistic ideas after the July revolution. Among\r\n      modern communists who are to be distinguished from the more ancient,\r\n      especially by the industrial coloring given to their theories,\r\n      _Cabet_, Voyage en Icarie, 1840, II, holds a very prominent place.\r\n      He declares the abolition of religion, of the family and of the\r\n      state, to be open questions, and desires to bring the practice of a\r\n      community of goods to a successful issue only through the peaceful\r\n      channel of conviction.\r\n\r\n      Compare _Reybaud_, Etudes sur les Réformateurs contemporains ou\r\n      Socialistes modernes, 1840. _L. Stein_, Der Socialismus und\r\n      Communismus des heutigen Frankreich. See, also, the learned history\r\n      of socialistic systems in _Marlo’s_ Weltökonomie, I, 2, 435 ff.; and\r\n      in what concerns the most recent time, _R. Meyer_, Der\r\n      Emancipationskampf des vierten Standes, II, 1874, seq.; a book\r\n      which, in spite of its many defects, both doctrinal and\r\n      journalistic, is as rich in thought, and in the knowledge of the\r\n      subject it treats of, as it is permeated by a love of truth\r\n      regardless of consequences. Among the opponents of socialism and\r\n      communism, _Malthus_, On Population, B. III, ch. 3, and _B.\r\n      Hildebrand_, Die Nationalökonomie der Gegenwart und Zukunft, vol. I,\r\n      1848, hold a very distinguished place. _J. S. Mill_, Principles, II,\r\n      ch. 1, 3, calls attention to the fact that hitherto the principle of\r\n      free property has never been consistently carried out. The first\r\n      social arrangement of modern society was almost everywhere the\r\n      result of conquest and violence, large traces of which yet remain.\r\n      Things have always been made property which ought not to be\r\n      property. Governments have endeavored to intensify the darkness of\r\n      the dark side of property, and favored the concentration instead of\r\n      the diffusion of wealth etc. Hence, no one can claim that the social\r\n      wrongs, so-called, had their origin in property as such. _Schäffle_,\r\n      Kapitalismus und Socialismus, 1870, has made a very note-worthy\r\n      effort to recognize whatever of truth there is in socialism, and to\r\n      combat its errors.\r\n\r\n_  480 Saint Simon’s_ reproach to the liberals, that their fundamental\r\n      principle was: _ôte-toi de là, que je m’y mette_, is well known.\r\n\r\n  481 Compare _Malthus_, Additions to the Essay on Population, 1817, IV,\r\n      ch. 7.\r\n\r\n  482 The _travailleurs égalitaires_ wished to murder not only the king,\r\n      the court, and the ministry, but also the Liberals and all owners of\r\n      property.\r\n\r\n  483 As soon, indeed, as this true love disappears in the married state,\r\n      the community of goods even there degenerates only too easily into a\r\n      spoliation of the better party by the worse.\r\n\r\n  484 The community of goods of the first Christians at Jerusalem, so\r\n      frequently cited and extolled (_James_, I, 1), was only a community\r\n      of use, not of ownership (Acts IV, 32), and, throughout, a voluntary\r\n      act of love, not a duty (V. 4), least of all, a _right_ which the\r\n      poorer might assert. Spite of all this, that community of goods\r\n      produced a chronic state of poverty in the church of Jerusalem.\r\n      Hence, Paul had collections taken up for them on all sides, without,\r\n      however, anywhere establishing a similar institution. (Romans, 15,\r\n      26; I. Corinth., 16, 1.) Compare _Mosheim_, De vera Natura\r\n      Communionis Bonorum in Ecclesia Hierosol., in his Dissertatt. ad\r\n      Histor. Eccles. pertinentes, II, 1 ff. As to whether _Barnabas_\r\n      (Epist., 19) desired to say anything more, compare Epist. ad\r\n      Diognetum, 5. For a real recommendation of a community of goods, on\r\n      economic grounds, see _Joh. Chrysostom._, in Acta Apost., Hom. XI.\r\n      Also _Clemens Rom._ c. 2 C. 12, qu. 1. Community of goods among the\r\n      Essenes: _Philo._ Opp. II. 457 ff. _Joseph. Bell_, Jud., II. 8.\r\n      _Bellermann_, Geschichtliche Nachrichten über die Essener. (1821.)\r\n      In many monasteries, there has been and is a species of community of\r\n      goods. There was once a singular contest on this subject, carried on\r\n      between the Minorites and the Pope, in the time of Louis of Bavaria.\r\n      The Minorites claimed that property was a thing, so much to be\r\n      condemned, that even food, at the moment of eating it, did not\r\n      belong to the person using it. The Pope taught on the other hand,\r\n      that even Christ and the Apostles possessed property, part personal\r\n      and part in common. (_Raynaldi_, Ann. eccl., XV, 241, 285 ff.)\r\n      Community of goods of the Homiliates, later of the Brothers of\r\n      Common Life, after the manner of the monks, but of a much higher\r\n      kind. (_Ullmann_, Reformatoren v.d. Reform, II, 62 ff.) The first\r\n      settlers of New Haven, Connecticut, held their property in common.\r\n      Land was divided among families in proportion to the number of\r\n      persons in them, and of the number of cattle they had brought with\r\n      them; and all sales and purchases were made on account of the whole\r\n      community. And so in Massachusetts during the first seven years of\r\n      the colony’s existence. (_Ebeling_, Geschichte und Erdbeschreib. der\r\n      Vereinigten Staaten, II, 391, I, 557.) _Herrnhut_ community of goods\r\n      in Pennsylvania, from 1742 to 1762, but which was done away with\r\n      when the number of colonists became too great. (_Ebeling_, IV, 717.)\r\n      Community of goods of the Shakers and Lutheran Rappers.\r\n      (_Buckingham_, Eastern States, II, 214, 427. _Prinz Neuwied_, Reise\r\n      in Nord Amerika, I, 136, ff.) Russian sects with community of goods.\r\n      (_v. Haxthausen_, I, 366, 407.) _Harless_, christliche Ethik § 501,\r\n      distinguishes very well between the “anti-christian” and “pseudo\r\n      christian” stand point, from which it is sought to establish the\r\n      doctrine of a community of goods. The Christian view of this subject\r\n      (compare Ephes., 4, 28, I; Thess., 4, 11, II, 3, 12; Matth., 6, 24;\r\n      Pet. 4, 10; Matth., 26, 7-11) is accused of hypocrisy by many\r\n      socialists. It is very easy, they say, when one is himself in\r\n      comfortable circumstances, to represent to the poor that their\r\n      poverty is a school for heaven, and to preach a contempt for riches\r\n      etc. They entirely forget, that the first promulgation of the Gospel\r\n      was made at a time when the worst kind of pauperism prevailed; and\r\n      that even the Master Himself, and the greater number of His Apostles\r\n      belonged to the lowest stratum of society. _Luke_, 9, 58. Many of\r\n      the Fathers of the Church, however, in their exhortations to\r\n      benevolence, used language in which modern Socialists have found a\r\n      rich mine which they have sedulously worked. (Compare\r\n      _Villegardelle_, Histoire des Idées sociales, 1846, 61 ff.)\r\n\r\n  485 Even _Aristotle_ says that what is common to many is a matter of\r\n      little concern to any one. (Polit., II, 1.) _Bastiat_ remarks: “We\r\n      compete to-day to see who works most and best. Under another regime,\r\n      we should emulate one another to see who should work least and\r\n      worst.” (Harmonies Econ., ch. VIII.) When the first settlers of\r\n      Virginia, in 1611, gave up the system of common labor and of\r\n      joint-stock companies, as much work was performed in a day as\r\n      formerly in a week, or as much by three workmen as formerly by\r\n      thirty. (_Purchas_, Pilgrims, iv, 1866. _Bancroft_, History of the\r\n      United States, I, 161.) Even in New England, therefore among men\r\n      both steady and accustomed to labor, who for conscience sake had\r\n      sacrificed so much, a community of goods was accompanied\r\n      uninterruptedly by famine. A change for the better took place, for\r\n      the first time in 1623 with the introduction of the institution of\r\n      private property which was followed in 1624 by the right of\r\n      inheritance. (_Bancroft_, I, 340.) The military colonies of Algeria,\r\n      also, in which husbandry in common was carried on, begged, at the\r\n      end of a year, that the system should be abandoned, for the reason\r\n      that it was good for nothing but to generate idlers; and yet, these\r\n      colonists were all powerful men of about the same age, and\r\n      accustomed to order and service in common. They were, moreover,\r\n      assisted by the nation with pay and food. Compare _Bugeaud’s_\r\n      account: Revue des deux Mondes, June 1, 1848. “The French\r\n      associations (after 1848), whose object was labor in common, have\r\n      nearly all died out.” _M. Chevalier_ in the Journal des Débats, Feb.\r\n      3, 1851. In the United States, sixteen phalansteries of Fourierites,\r\n      founded between 1840 and 1846, had all collapsed in 1855. (_D.\r\n      Vierteljahrsschrift_, October, 1855, 205 ff.)\r\n\r\n  486 Even in New Harmony, the members considered the task which they had\r\n      to perform to obtain food, clothing and shelter, as villeinage in\r\n      the worst sense of the term. (_H. Bernhard v. Weimar_, Nordamerikan.\r\n      Reise, V, 134 ff.; 151, 310, ff.) It is very inconsistent in\r\n      socialists to continue the proprietorship and heirship of the state.\r\n      To be consistent they should give both these rights only to mankind\r\n      as a whole. Compare _Kiraly_, Ueber Socialismus und Comm., 1868, 35.\r\n\r\n  487 It would not be entirely fair to take a partisan view of the\r\n      _ateliers nationaux_ of 1848, and claim them as a practical\r\n      refutation of socialistic utopias, since no serious experiment was\r\n      made with them. Compare _E. Thomas_, Histoire des Ateliers nationaux\r\n      considérés sous le double Point de Vue politique et social, 1848.\r\n\r\n  488 Socialists generally overlook the fact, that the greater number of\r\n      enjoyments from which the poorer classes are excluded, by the right\r\n      of property, would not exist at all were it not for that very right.\r\n      (_Spittler_, Politik, 356 ff.) This remark may also be made of\r\n      _Hugo’s_ ingenious objections. (Naturrecht, § 208 ff.) One of the\r\n      most effective pieces of socialistic declamation is that the lower\r\n      classes have a much shorter average of life than the upper. Hence\r\n      the institution of private property is charged with being a species\r\n      of spoliation of the poor of so many years of life, and the entire\r\n      “present society” condemned on that account. Here again it is not\r\n      borne in mind, that a few centuries ago the general average of life\r\n      was probably still smaller; and that it was precisely the growth and\r\n      development of “present society” that lengthened the days of the\r\n      poorer classes even, although it may have lengthened those of the\r\n      rich in a still greater proportion. See § 246.\r\n\r\n  489 But a community of goods would not, by a great deal, accomplish as\r\n      much as is generally supposed. In Prussia, for instance, in 1867,\r\n      only about three per cent. of the entire number of families in the\r\n      community had a yearly income of 1,000 thalers; only nine per cent.\r\n      had 500 thalers or more, and only 6,465 returned an income of more\r\n      than 4,000 thalers, while only 590 returned one of 16,000 thalers.\r\n      (Preuss. statist. Ztschr, 1868, 83. _Held_, Die Einkommensteuer, 197\r\n      ff) How little, therefore, could the poor here gain by the\r\n      spoliation of the rich! Besides, the purely personal consumption of\r\n      the rich is, after all, not so great; and if all luxury were\r\n      abandoned, an innumerable number of men would lose their gains.\r\n      (Compare _Ad. Smith_, Wealth of Nations, I, ch. 11, 2.) It would be\r\n      to kill the hen that had hitherto laid the golden egg in order to\r\n      divide its flesh a little more equally.\r\n\r\n_  490 Babeuf_ declared all arts and sciences to be evils. He would have\r\n      no one learn anything but Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, and a little\r\n      of the Geography of France; and have the strictest censorship\r\n      enforced to keep every one within these limits. Compare the able\r\n      criticism of _Proudhon_, Contradictions, ch. 12.\r\n\r\n  491 According to _Umpfenbach_, Nationalökonomie, 201, where a community\r\n      of goods obtains, there can be but the alternative, viz.: whether\r\n      each person or each family shall receive just the same amount. (The\r\n      former would be more in harmony with principle, but what an\r\n      over-population would be the consequence!) Precisely so, too, if\r\n      each person were to come and take his own portion (anarchy!), or if\r\n      it were parcelled out to each by a board of distributors\r\n      (despotism!).\r\n\r\n  492 This expression came into vogue, principally, through _L. Blanc_,\r\n      Organization du Travail (1841), the leading ideas in which work are\r\n      the following: The suppression of competition by the establishment\r\n      of state industries; equality of remuneration for labor; equality\r\n      and legislative determination of the rate of interest; the choice of\r\n      superintendents by the workmen. With many modern socialists, the\r\n      shibboleth is not so much _liberté_ as _solidarité_. Besides,\r\n      _Fichte’s_ Naturrecht (1796), and his geschlossener Handelsstaat,\r\n      are, without doubt, among the most remarkable works favoring an\r\n      “organization of labor.” They aim at the destruction of the present\r\n      social system, which, at most, needs only to be reformed and\r\n      rejuvenated; and to galvanize the dead body into a new and different\r\n      life (Medea’s magic cauldron!). Compare _Corvaja_, Bancocrazia o il\r\n      gran Libro sociale, 1840.\r\n\r\n  493 Cabet’s Icarian colony in America numbered 298 adults and only 107\r\n      children. Yet spite of this condition, so favorable to production,\r\n      it did but a very sorry business. Its government was very similar to\r\n      that of a house of correction or a penitentiary. Even in religious\r\n      matters, spite of all pretended toleration, those members who did\r\n      not agree with Cabet were described in the official weekly paper as\r\n      _des infames ou des aveugles_. (D. Vierteljahrsschrift, 1855,\r\n      October, 205 ff.)\r\n\r\n  494 An eastern sage says, that land possesses the ideal of legal\r\n      security through which a beautiful woman, decked with pearls, might\r\n      travel without danger. What would such a sage say of a European\r\n      country, in which even orphan children have their property not only\r\n      preserved to them, but find it increased from having been placed at\r\n      interest, as soon as they reach their majority? (_Barrow_.)\r\n\r\n  495 “The equality of communism is the worst species of inequality,\r\n      because it guarantees to one for two hours of poor labor as much as\r\n      it does to an other for four hours of good work.” (_Bastiat_,\r\n      Harmonies économiques, ch. 8.)\r\n\r\n_  496 Proudhon_, Qu’est-ce que la Propriété, 283, says, very justly, that\r\n      “a community of goods is the spoliation of the strong by the weak.”\r\n\r\n  497 Called a negative community of goods, by _Zacchariä_, Vierzig Bücher\r\n      vom Staate, IV, 146, in contradistinction to the positive and\r\n      universal community of gain, as desired by the communists.\r\n\r\n  498 Community of goods and of women among the Ichthyophages on the Red\r\n      Sea, who lived in caves, went naked for the most part, plundered all\r\n      shipwrecked people, and never reached an advanced age. _Diodor._,\r\n      III, 15 ff. _Peripl._, Maris Erythr., 12.

Among the\r\n      inhabitants of the Aleutian islands, at least in times of scarcity\r\n      of food, the produce of the fisheries is divided according to their\r\n      need. (_V. Wrangell_, 185.) The organization of labor is rigidly\r\n      enforced among the Otomacs, on the banks of the Orinoco, and they\r\n      are, nevertheless, more civilized than their neighbors. (_Depons_,\r\n      Voyage, I, 295.) A community of goods must, however, be considered\r\n      an advance, in the case of an isolated people; and it is an error to\r\n      look upon it as the most primitive condition, as does, for instance,\r\n      _Ambrosius_, De off. Minist. I, 28, and _Frederick II_, in the\r\n      preface to his general code. (Allgemein. Gesetzbuche, 1231.)

(_Robertson_,\r\n      History of America, § VII.) Hence, the agriculture of the country\r\n      was so unimportant that the little army of the _conquistadores_\r\n      frequently produced a famine by their marches.\r\n\r\n  501 The Tcherkesses considered robbery honorable provided the robber was\r\n      not caught _in flagrante_. Compare _Koch_, Reise in den kaukasischen\r\n      Isthmus, I, 370 ff. _Bell_, Journal of a Residence in Circassia, I,\r\n      181, II, 201. The organized robber bands of ancient Egypt, when it\r\n      was so highly civilized (_Diodor._, I, 80) may, on the other hand,\r\n      be accounted for by similar conditions actually existing in the\r\n      large cities of our own day.\r\n\r\n  502 What a frightful organization of labor we find in Sparta, combined\r\n      with a community of goods! Let us recall the exposing of children\r\n      authorized by law, the mode of education which must have cost the\r\n      life of all whose constitution was weak, the _cryptia_, the stern\r\n      hierarchy of age etc. _Plut._, Inst. Lac. 2, appreciates the bad\r\n      taste of the black broth at its true value. The Cretan community of\r\n      goods was based chiefly on the unnatural relation created by the\r\n      authorities known as paiderastia; and which was a very efficient\r\n      means to prevent over-population. (_Plat._, De Legg, I, 636.\r\n      _Arist._, Polit. II, 8.)\r\n\r\n  503 Remarkable reasons therefor in _Cæsar_, Bell. Gall., VI, 22.\r\n\r\n  504 There are, especially in Russia, a multitude of such institutions\r\n      among the inhabitants of the country still. See _Roscher_,\r\n      Nationalökonomik des Ackerbaues, § 71 ff.\r\n\r\n  505 In the Corpus Juris Canonici, that crown of medieval theology,\r\n      politics and jurisprudence, the ideal of a community of goods\r\n      occupies a place almost as prominent as in the works of modern\r\n      socialists. The only difference is, that in the former the\r\n      opposition to private property arises from a one-sided religiousness\r\n      and contempt of the world, while, in the latter, it arises generally\r\n      from irreligiousness and over-estimation of worldly goods.\r\n\r\n  506 This does not include the cost of the schools, churches and\r\n      benevolent institutions.\r\n\r\n  507 According to _Lassalle_, System der erworbenen Rechte, 1861, § 259,\r\n      history shows that law, as civilization advances, curtails more and\r\n      more the proprietary sphere of private individuals, inasmuch as it\r\n      tends more and more to place a greater number of objects outside the\r\n      circle of individual ownership.\r\n\r\n  508 Saint Simonism is a warning example of this tendency. Saint Simon\r\n      never lost an opportunity to give vent to his utter contempt for the\r\n      liberals, and for constitutional government—_ce bátard du régime\r\n      féodal et du régime industriel_; and to counsel the crown, after the\r\n      example of Louis XI. to place itself at the head of the working\r\n      class, and in opposition to the middle class. (Oeuvres de _Saint\r\n      Simon_, éd. 1841, 44, 148, 209.) _Bazard_, Exposition, 76, demanded\r\n      that all antagonism between the temporal and spiritual powers, all\r\n      opposition for the sake of freedom, _méfiance organisée_ of\r\n      parliaments, and all competition, should cease. Even education he\r\n      would have bestowed according to _capacité_, which he would have\r\n      determined by the _chefs légitimes de la société_ (280). To the\r\n      criminal court should be referred all cases of _delicts_, that is,\r\n      all inopportune acts, even in the scientific and artistic\r\n      departments. They should be tried after the manner of the “courts of\r\n      trade;” that is, in a summary way, without appeal, and by experts\r\n      (317 ff). All the relations of property should be determined by the\r\n      _décision arbitrale des chefs d’industrie_ (326). _Bazard_\r\n      everywhere insists that the reign of genius and of self-sacrifice on\r\n      the one hand, and on the other of confidence and obedience, is the\r\n      only true policy (330). Saint Simonism was nearly related to\r\n      Bonapartism.\r\n\r\n_  509 Schäffle_, Nat. Œk., III, Aufl., I, 61.\r\n\r\n  510 If we remove in thought, all injurious elements from a community of\r\n      goods, and add to it all the incentives and restraints necessary to\r\n      be added, we shall have a state of things entirely similar to that\r\n      in a nation whose public and private affairs are carried on in\r\n      accordance with the principles of a healthy system of Political\r\n      Economy as understood to-day. (Edinburgh Review, January, 1851.)\r\n\r\n  511 How true freedom is accompanied by what _Bastiat_ calls “true Saint\r\n      Simonism and true communism,” see _infra_, § 210.\r\n\r\n  512 The experiments of a community of goods, which have proved\r\n      successful in practice, were all based on the more or less complete\r\n      celibacy of the members of the societies. Compare _Hermann_,\r\n      Staatsw. Unters., II, Aufl., 45.\r\n\r\n  513 Thus _Proudhon_ (Contradictions, ch. 5) says that the many\r\n      socialists, who would construct their societies after the type of\r\n      the family, as the _molscule organique_, are all wrong. The family\r\n      has a “monarchical, patriarchal” character. In it, the principle of\r\n      authority is formed and preserved. On it, ancient and feudal society\r\n      was based; and “precisely against this old patriarchal constitution,\r\n      modern democracy protests and revolts.” _Fourier_ calls marriage,\r\n      _un groupe essentiellement faux: faux par le nombre borné à deux,\r\n      par l’absence de liberté et par les dissidences du goṅt, qui\r\n      éclatent dès le premier jour_. (Nouveau Monde, 57.)\r\n\r\n  514 On the Indians of North America, see _Schoolraft_, Information\r\n      respecting the Indian Tribes of the United States, II, 194; on the\r\n      South American _d’Orbigny_, Voyage, IV, 220, and passim, on the\r\n      South Sea Islanders, the Novara-Reise, II, 418; on the ancient\r\n      Albanians, _Strabo_, XI, 503.\r\n\r\n  515 The hereditary transmission of property to posterity has an obvious\r\n      tendency to make a man a good citizen. It ranges his passions on the\r\n      side of duty, and induces him to make himself profit the common\r\n      good, and it assures him that his reward shall not die with himself,\r\n      but that it shall be handed down to those to whom he is joined by\r\n      the dearest and most tender feelings. (See _Blackstone’s_\r\n      Commentaries, II, 11.) Without the right of inheritance, credit is\r\n      scarcely possible, since with the death of the debtor the only stay\r\n      of the creditor would cease.\r\n\r\n  516 Testamentary freedom (which obtained in places there about the\r\n      beginning of the eighteenth century) prevails completely in England\r\n      at present, contrary to the principle of the Roman law requiring an\r\n      obligatory portion (_la légitime_) to be left to the heirs, which is\r\n      still binding in France, but in a very much developed form. The\r\n      consequence is that last testaments are as frequent in England as\r\n      they are rare in France. There were, in Paris, in 1825, 7,649\r\n      judicial, and only 1,081 testamentary partitions of property.\r\n      (_Monnier_.) In Great Britain, in 1838, the number of testamentary\r\n      alienations of property taxed stood to those in which there was no\r\n      will, in the proportion of 8:3; and the values of the alienated\r\n      property as 10:1. (_Porter_.) Among a people noted for their high\r\n      moral tone, testamentary freedom is a powerful means of\r\n      strengthening paternal authority on the one hand, and of keeping\r\n      alive, in the minds of parents, on the other, a sense of\r\n      responsibility for the future of their children. Compare\r\n      _Helferich_, Tübinger Zeitschr., 1854, 143, ff.\r\n\r\n_  517 Polyb._, XX, 6. Hence it was, that all (?) the wealth of Thebes,\r\n      when it was destroyed by Alexander the Great, was only 440 talents.\r\n      (Athen., IV, 148.) _Drumann_, Gesch. Roms. etc., VI, 333 ff.\r\n      _Cicero_, Phil., II, 16. _Hoeck_, Röm. Gesch., I, 2, 118. _Sueton._,\r\n      Octav., 66. An especially scandalous instance in _Petron._, 140. For\r\n      a masterly theory of legacy-hunting, see _Horat._, Sat., II, 5.\r\n      Compare _Lucian_, Dialogues of the Dead, 5-9. _Petronius_ speaks of\r\n      a _turba hæredipetarum_. (124.)\r\n\r\n  518 Even the revolutionary shibboleth, _paternité_, really means nothing\r\n      more than the equal right of inheritance of all, i.e., the abolition\r\n      of the right of inheritance! (_R. Meyer_.) The strongest attack,\r\n      from a scientific point of view, made on the right of inheritance in\r\n      more recent times, comes from Saint Simonism. The founder himself,\r\n      after a life rich in experience but poor in action, spent in the\r\n      search of much but in the finding of little, succeeded only in\r\n      arraying the industrial and proprietary classes against each other,\r\n      in declaring the poorest class to be the most important of all, and\r\n      in basing the new _religion of love_ on the emancipation of labor.\r\n      His disciples went further. In order to abolish all the privileges\r\n      of birth, _Bazard_, Exposition de la Doctrine de Saint Simon, 1831,\r\n      p. 172, ff., taught that it was not enough to distribute public\r\n      employments according to merit, and in the interest of the people\r\n      generally, but that the distribution of property should be made in\r\n      accordance with the same principle. The inequality of ownership\r\n      should correspond with the inequality of merit. Every one may,\r\n      during his life, keep what he had acquired himself, but give it to\r\n      the state at death. Thus would a reconciliation be effected between\r\n      the general interest and private interest; and the public revenue,\r\n      supplied in this way, might easily be employed in place of the\r\n      revenue raised by such taxation as weighs most heavily on the\r\n      inferior classes. _F. Huet_, also, Le Regne social du Christianisme,\r\n      1853, III, 5, would have all private property, after the death of\r\n      the owner, fall _également à tous les jeunes travailleurs_. The\r\n      practical consequences of this system may now be seen in Turkey.\r\n      There, the principal military fiefs are held in this way. Hence it\r\n      is, that the Turkish owner of such a fief builds as little as\r\n      possible. When one of his walls threatens to fall, it is kept\r\n      standing by means of props. If it falls in fact, the only\r\n      consequence is that there are fewer rooms in the house, and the\r\n      owner settles beside the ruins. (_Denon_, I, p. 193.) In the Butan,\r\n      there exists a species of practical Saint Simonism. _Robinson_,\r\n      Descriptive Account of Assan, 1841.\r\n\r\n  519 It was chiefly fear of the consequences of the declamations of the\r\n      socialists and their declamation against “monopoly” that induced\r\n      _Bastiat_ to reduce all the value of landed property to that of the\r\n      capital employed in its manuring, improvement etc. (Harmonies, ch.\r\n      9.) We may, however, unreservedly grant him that, as a rule, until\r\n      the time of its original possession by man, land had no _valeur_\r\n      whatever (278).\r\n\r\n_  520 Kant_ thinks the very contrary: Metaph.

B. Say_).\r\n\r\n_  522 Schubert_, Reise durch Frankreich und Italien, I, 188.\r\n\r\n  523 “Without labor, the earth bestows nothing on man but a stopping\r\n      place. Hence, the reasons for private property do not extend so far\r\n      as to prove that the great land and water highways should not be\r\n      reserved as common property, and as a home to every man.”\r\n      (_Zachariä_, vom Staate, VII, 43.)\r\n\r\n  524 This is the practice in Taway. _Ritter_, Erdkunde, V, 130.

(_Fraser_, Journey in Chorasan, ch. 7.) Especially\r\n      after the Mongolian devastation about the beginning of the\r\n      fourteenth century, it was decreed that land which had remained\r\n      uncultivated for a long time should belong to the person who made it\r\n      productive. (_d’Ohsson_, Hist. des Mongols, IV, 418.) Similarly, in\r\n      the time of the ancient Persians (_Polyb._, X, 28, 3), the harvest\r\n      for the first five years belonged to the person who first irrigated\r\n      the land. On the upper Euphrates, likewise, the land is very often\r\n      neither sold nor leased. Anyone who will till it and pay one-tenth\r\n      of the produce to the bey may have it for nothing. (_Ritter_, X,\r\n      669; compare VIII, 468; IX, 900.) So, too, among the Fulah and\r\n      Mandingo negroes, and even among the Tscherkessans. (_Klemm_,\r\n      Kulturgeschichte, III, 337 ff.) As the latest stages of development\r\n      so often present instances of a reversion to the earliest, we find\r\n      that Theodosius and Valentinian decreed that the _agri deserti_\r\n      should, after two years’ cultivation, belong to the possessor. L. 8,\r\n      Cod. Just., XI, 58.\r\n\r\n  525 Thus anyone may burn his own coat or throw it in the water; but no\r\n      one may set fire to his own house or drown his land by the\r\n      destruction of a dam. Even the non-user of a large area, in a\r\n      thickly populated region, would scarcely be permitted. The taking of\r\n      property by the state, at the present day in times of peace, is\r\n      confined almost exclusively to land.\r\n\r\n  526 Thus _P. v. Arnim_, in a work entitled “Ideen zu einer vollständigen\r\n      landwirthschaftlichen,” Buchführung, 1805, a treatise on\r\n      “agricultural book-keeping,” considers the farmer as a state\r\n      official who should cultivate whatever he believed in conscience, or\r\n      what the state declared to be, most necessary. He suggests that the\r\n      state should subject all new purchasers of land to an examination to\r\n      ascertain whether they are rich and noble enough to act in this way.\r\n\r\n  527 Thus, for instance, _Herbert Spencer_, Social Statics, 1851, 114\r\n      ff., and to some extent _Spinoza_, Tract. polit., VI, 2. There are\r\n      now in England several Land-Tenure-Reform-Associations, some of\r\n      which would “expropriate” all land and vest the title in the state.\r\n      The programme of the others embraces not only opposition to the\r\n      right of primogeniture, to family _fidei commissa_ and the assertion\r\n      of the right of freedom of trade in land, and of a more democratic\r\n      use of common lands, but also the appropriation by the state of the\r\n      increase in the rent of land which is caused by no labor of the\r\n      landlord, but solely by the increase of population and of the wealth\r\n      of the community or of the nation. _Newmarch_, on the other hand,\r\n      very correctly remarks, that since it is impossible to draw a line\r\n      of demarkation showing the increase of the value of land growing out\r\n      of the increase of population etc., the owner of land in making\r\n      improvements would never know whether he made them for himself or\r\n      for the state. (Statist. Journal, 1871, 488 ff.) Compare _Wolkoff_,\r\n      Sur la Rente foncière, 1854, and _H. H. Gossen_, Entwickelung der\r\n      Gesetze des menschlichen Verkehrs (1854).\r\n\r\n  528 In Congo and on the gold coast of Guinea the land, in whole\r\n      villages, is tilled in common and the harvest distributed among the\r\n      families per capita. Wherever absolutism reigns, the prince is also\r\n      the owner of all the land. (_Klemm_, III, 337.) In China, where the\r\n      original tenure in common of the land by all was broken through in\r\n      the third century before Christ, all the land of the country now\r\n      belongs, strictly speaking, to the state; and the possessor of land\r\n      who permits it to go untilled is punished. (_Plath._ in the\r\n      phil.-hist. Sitzungsberichten der Münchener Akad., 1873, 793 ff.) In\r\n      Corea, private property in land is unknown; arable land is divided\r\n      by the state according to the number in a family. (_Ritter_, IV,\r\n      633.) The example, on the largest scale, of a country without\r\n      private property in land is the British East Indies. Compare the\r\n      paper by _Ch. Campbell_, in the Essays published by the Cobden Club;\r\n      System of Land Tenure in various Countries, 1870.\r\n\r\n  529 The legal and economic difference between property in land and\r\n      property in capital is well defined by _J. S. Mill_, Principles, II,\r\n      ch. 2, 6. “The reasons which form the justification, in an\r\n      economical point of view, of property in land, are only valid in so\r\n      far as the proprietor of the land is its improver. In no sound\r\n      theory of private property was it ever contemplated that the\r\n      proprietor of land should be merely a sinecurist quartered on it.”\r\n      He here alludes specially to Ireland. The Fourierist, _Considérant_,\r\n      distinguishes accurately between the capital produced by labor and\r\n      saving, and the increase of the value of land caused by capital and\r\n      labor, and its original value. Only the first two elements can\r\n      justly be made property. But as, for prudential reasons, it is\r\n      necessary to grant individuals the right of private property in\r\n      land, those who are not such proprietors must, as a compensation for\r\n      the common property which they have lost, be guaranteed the right to\r\n      labor. (Théorie du Droit de Propriété et du Droit au Travail.) In\r\n      England, the opinion that the compulsory support of the poor was\r\n      introduced in compensation to them for the establishment of private\r\n      property in land has met with considerable favor. _Bishop Woodward_,\r\n      On the Expediency of a Regular Plan for the Maintenance of the Poor\r\n      in Ireland, 1775. Compare _Eden_, State of the Poor, I, 413.\r\n      However, the poor rates, in a country like England, are much more\r\n      than an equivalent of what its soil could produce without the\r\n      assistance of capital.\r\n\r\n  530 The principal classical work on this subject is _Nebenius_, Der\r\n      öffentliche Credit, 1820, 2d ed., 1829. Previously, _Salmasius_, De\r\n      Modo Usurarum, 1639; and even _Demosthenes_, adv. Dionysiod, 1283.\r\n      Compare further _Schäffle_, in the Deutsch. Vierteljahrsschrift, No.\r\n      106, II, 289 ff.\r\n\r\n  531 Compulsory loans by the state, for instance, occupy an intermediate\r\n      position between taxes and credit-operations, properly so called.\r\n\r\n  532 Besides loans proper, all payments in advance, or delays made in the\r\n      payments of earnest-money, all leases and lettings, which\r\n      _Courcelle-Seneuil_ calls _un médiocre degré de crédit_, insurances\r\n      and even all contracts for wages where the payment is delayed for a\r\n      long period of time, are species of credit. For a nice distinction\r\n      between leasing (_Pacht_) and letting (_Miethe_), see _Knies_,\r\n      Tübinger Ztschr., 1860, 180 ff., and the Freiburger Univ. Programm.,\r\n      9. September, 1862. _D. Wakefield_, Essay upon Political Economy,\r\n      1804, 35, distinguishes between “loan-credit” which is given to a\r\n      poor man in the hope of his paying it by means of his labor, and\r\n      “exchange-credit,” or credit between property owners.\r\n      _Cieszkowski’s_ definition: _le crédit c’est la métamorphose des\r\n      capitaux stables et engagés en capitaux circulants et dégagés_. (Du\r\n      Crédit et de la Circulation, 2d ed., 1847.) According to _Knies_,\r\n      Tübinger Ztschr., 1859, 568, every credit-operation is an exchange\r\n      or sale of services, one of which is to be performed in the present,\r\n      and the counter-service of the other party in the future. According\r\n      to _Macleod_, it is “a sale of debts.”\r\n\r\n  533 Personal credit, of course, preponderates in commerce. Hence it is,\r\n      that in mercantile life, information concerning the personal status,\r\n      reputation etc. of his colleagues, plays so important a part with\r\n      the merchant. This information was made more accessible in England\r\n      by the Lloyd institution. On similar North American institutions,\r\n      see _Tellkampf_, Beiträge, I, 51. Credit given on security is a\r\n      modification, sometimes of personal and sometimes of real credit.\r\n      Compare, _infra_, the theory on bankers, brokers etc.\r\n\r\n  534 In despotisms, credit is almost entirely personal. _Montesquieu_\r\n      Esprit des Lois, L.V., 15. In New York, says _M. Chevalier_, a\r\n      merchant with resources worth 200,000 francs, can do a business of\r\n      from 1,000,000 to 1,500,000 francs. In Paris, under similar\r\n      circumstances, the same man would find it difficult to be credited\r\n      to the extent of 500,000 francs. In Holland, two hundred years ago,\r\n      a person who hypothecated his property was obliged to pay a higher\r\n      rate of interest than in business (_Becher_, Polit.

In Zurich, it was encouraged by\r\n      the prohibition of loaning money out of the country. (_Büsch_,\r\n      Geldumlauf, III, 40.)\r\n\r\n_  535 Schäffle_, Nat.

This is a dangerous error, since to every\r\n      credit there is a set-off in the nature of a debit of an equal\r\n      amount; and the evidences of debt are nothing but claims on the\r\n      future revenue of the state. This was fully recognized by\r\n      _Cantillon_, 291 ff. One of the principal advocates of that view\r\n      among writers on Political Economy is the vivacious, acute and\r\n      practically not unskillful, but sophistically superficial _Macleod_.\r\n      (Elements of Political Economy, 1858, ch. 3, Dictionary, 1862, v.\r\n      Credit.) The creditor’s assignable right of demand, he considers\r\n      immaterial capital. While bills of lading, warehouse receipts, dock\r\n      yard receipts etc., only represent goods, the bank note is new\r\n      goods. Even metallic money has only a credit-value, inasmuch as it\r\n      can be used only to effect exchanges. To the - of the creditor may\r\n      correspond a + of the debtor; but the latter is negative only in the\r\n      sense that we speak of negative electricity, a negative\r\n      thermometrical degree. When an estate is leased, the owner has, in\r\n      his demand for rent, a vendible _plus_; but the lessee no\r\n      corresponding _minus_. (Not so. To the same extent that the\r\n      proprietor has his future payments on the lease discounted, the\r\n      present sale-value of his estate is diminished; or if it is not\r\n      sold, the last party obtaining the discount has made his available\r\n      capital as much less by the advance as that of the lessor has been\r\n      increased.) The “discounting of the future,” that is, the apparent\r\n      capitalization of hopes, so much in vogue at the present time, may\r\n      be a great spur to production as it may also be to baseless\r\n      extravagance.\r\n\r\n  538 Many theoreticians ascribe a direct creation of new capital to\r\n      credit, in so far as the capacity of the evidences of debt to\r\n      circulate as a medium of exchange effects a real saving, and permits\r\n      the former very costly and intrinsically valuable instruments of\r\n      exchange to be used in some other way.

But here, too, there is, immediately, only a transfer of\r\n      already existing capital. The person, for instance, who accepts a\r\n      bank note for payment, loans a part of his capital to the bank; and\r\n      the advantage to the whole community of such credit-operations\r\n      consists chiefly in this: that so large a quantity of cash-capital\r\n      which lay idle in banks etc., may be used more productively.\r\n\r\n  539 When _Roesler_ says that credit is capital, the product of saving,\r\n      and very serviceable in further production (_Grands._, 300), he\r\n      confounds credit itself with the foundations of credit, which are,\r\n      indeed, in large part material or moral capital.\r\n\r\n  540 Compare Discourse on Trade, Coyn and Paper-Credit, London, 1697, 72\r\n      ff.\r\n\r\n  541 Compare _Buron_, Guerre au Crédit, 1868. _Schäffle_, Tüb. Ztsch.,\r\n      1869, 296 ff. With a thorough understanding of its\r\n      politico-economical bearing, _O. Michaelis_, (Berliner V. Jahrsschr.\r\n      1863, IV, 121,) says: The capital-value of my credit is not equal to\r\n      the nominal value of my evidences of indebtedness [notes etc.], but\r\n      to the capitalized amount of the extra surplus which I have obtained\r\n      in my business by means of credit, after deduction is made of the\r\n      costs and of the risk-premium.\r\n\r\n  542 We shall, in the books to follow this, inquire with great care, what\r\n      are the means best calculated to remedy this dangerous tendency. We\r\n      need only remark here, that it is to be found in a judicious\r\n      association of small capitalists, and also in the capitalization, so\r\n      to speak, of personal qualities. A well organized society of\r\n      work-men, without capital, may indeed obtain credit, as for\r\n      instance, the Schultze-Delitsch societies, the Russian\r\n      _artel-schnicks_ (market-aid societies) etc. prove. (_Frühauf_, Die\r\n      russ. Artels in _Faucher’s_ Vierteljahrsschrift, 1868, I, 106 ff.)\r\n      We may also mention the greater credit accorded to a land-owner the\r\n      moment he becomes a member of a land-loan association as compared\r\n      with what he could obtain before he had joined it. The popular\r\n      belief of the ancient Egyptians afforded them a very great\r\n      instrument of credit in the pledging of the remains of their\r\n      ancestors. (_Herodot._, II, 136.)\r\n\r\n_  543 B. Hildebrand_ is of opinion that the Political Economy of the\r\n      future may be characterized as credit-economy, in the same way as\r\n      the Economy of the present may be called money-economy, and that of\r\n      the past as barter-economy of barter. (National Œkonomie der\r\n      Gegenwart und Zukunft, I, 276 ff.) _Hildebrand’s_ view is correct in\r\n      so far as that, with every advance in civilization, credit comes to\r\n      have absolutely and relatively an ever increasing importance,\r\n      although in the middle ages, especially under feudal forms\r\n      (_Lehensformen_), there were numberless operations in credit.\r\n      Otherwise, however, _Hildebrand’s_ three kinds of economy are, by no\r\n      means, coördinated. While barter and purchase through the\r\n      instrumentality of money, in every instance, entirely exclude each\r\n      other, it is impossible to imagine a credit-transaction of which the\r\n      promise of a barter-performance or of a money-performance does not\r\n      constitute the base. During a “money-economical\r\n      (_geldwirthschaftlichen_) period” [i.e., one during which money is\r\n      the medium of exchange, and not notes; and when barter does not\r\n      obtain.—_Translator_.] the service rendered by money as a medium of\r\n      exchange may, for the most part, be supplanted by credit. Money, as\r\n      a measure of value, still remains the substratum of credit itself.\r\n      (See _Knies_ in the Tübinger Ztschr., 1860, 154 ff.; and in the\r\n      Freiburger Programm, 9 Sept., 1862, 19.) Earlier yet, _A. Wagner_,\r\n      Beitr. zur Lehre von den Banken, 1857 ff. Among the most practical\r\n      propositions of Saint Simonism is that of a _système genéral des\r\n      banques_, intended to administer all the goods of the nation, and to\r\n      loan them to individuals engaged, in production. (_Bazard_, 205 ff.)\r\n\r\n  544 It is destructive of credit to allow the debtor to await several\r\n      decrees or judgments before his liability is established; to allow\r\n      him, on easy terms, delays, reversals of judgment, the costs of the\r\n      case etc. The term within which a creditor might bring in his claim\r\n      before the meeting of creditors in the Amsterdam Boedel-chamber was\r\n      formerly thirty-three and a third years. (_Büsch_, Darst. der\r\n      Handlung, Zusatz, 82.) In the presidency of Bengal there were, in\r\n      1819, 81,000 cases in arrears, and in 1829, 140,000. Westminister\r\n      Review, XIX, 142.\r\n\r\n  545 And yet _Melon_ is of opinion that the state should favor the debtor\r\n      as much as possible. (Essai politique sur le Commerce, ch. 12, 18.)\r\n      This was the view entertained on this subject by the older\r\n      practitioners. In Bengal, the _dhura_, a species of “judgment of\r\n      God,” in which the party who could hold out longest against hunger\r\n      was declared the victor, was the only means to compel a debtor to\r\n      pay his debt. As a consequence, the Bengal peasant could not borrow\r\n      money at less than 60 per cent. per annum. Edinburgh Review, XXII,\r\n      67.

In Naples, even as recently as\r\n      1804, no debtor could be arrested during the last six months of the\r\n      queen’s pregnancy.

In Schwytz,\r\n      the rate of interest is so high, because the law allows the debtor\r\n      to pay his creditor, whether the latter will or not, in articles of\r\n      household furniture, clothes etc., estimated at a very high value.\r\n      (_Hermann_, Staatsw. Untersuchungen, 202.) It has now become quite\r\n      usual in the United States, on account of the many delays granted to\r\n      the debtor by “democratic” laws introduced there, instead of mere\r\n      mortgage, to give full warranty deeds when capital is loaned. By\r\n      this means, the creditor is in danger, when misfortune overtakes\r\n      him, to see himself compelled to let his property go at one-fourth\r\n      of its value.\r\n\r\n  546 See the Heliast oath in _Demosth._, adv.

According to _Droz_, the question is not one of weighing\r\n      “freedom” against “miserable money,” but the deprivation of a few of\r\n      that freedom and the non-fulfillment of obligations entered into,\r\n      that is against the destruction of public confidence.\r\n\r\n  555 A similar development among the Greeks:\r\n\r\n      A.

The chief characteristic of the ancient law in this matter was\r\n      the eventual sale of the person of the debtor on the getting of the\r\n      loan (_nexum_); the power of the creditor to put the _addictus_ to\r\n      death or to sell him in foreign parts; finally, the _in partes\r\n      secanto_, in the concourse of creditors. Without these rigorous\r\n      provisions, the borrower might easily have evaded his debts, by the\r\n      emancipation of his son and turning over his property to him.\r\n      (_Niebuhr_, Rom.

Later, we find nothing of the execution of the debtor, or of the\r\n      sale of his person; but he might be compelled to do slave labor for\r\n      his creditor without any protection against ill-treatment. Slavery\r\n      for debt was restricted by the Lex Poetelia. (_Niebuhr_, III, p.\r\n      178; _Mommsen_, III, 494.) The Prætorian law introduced the custom\r\n      of putting the creditor in possession of the goods of the debtor,\r\n      with power of sale, which proceeding rendered the debtor infamous.\r\n      See several passages in _Walter._, Röm Rechtsgesch, 763 ff;\r\n      _Tertull._, Apol., 4; Tab.

(_McCulloch_, Commercial Dictionary.) The ruinous credit\r\n      given by the Jews to the Westphalian peasants begins with an account\r\n      for the goods which they have succeeded in pressing upon them, after\r\n      five or six years have elapsed. The Jew seldom sues accounts at law;\r\n      but he besieges the debtor and discovers where his last head of\r\n      cattle and his last little supply of provisions are to be found. As\r\n      he is willing to accept everything that has any value, sometimes in\r\n      payment of arrears, and sometimes in payment for some new piece of\r\n      trash, he is sure to obtain his dues in the end, but not until his\r\n      victim, who is sunk deeper and deeper in the abyss of debt by every\r\n      “accommodation,” is entirely ruined. (_Schmerz_, Rheinish-Westphäl.\r\n      L.W., 396 ff.)\r\n\r\n  557 In the lower and middle stages of civilization, we find a multitude\r\n      of laws by which minors, students etc., but especially land-owners\r\n      are limited to a minimum of credit, which, however, varies very much\r\n      with the person, and is subjected to a number of embarrassing forms,\r\n      the consent of a third person, for instance etc. (Compare Bayerische\r\n      L.O. von 1553, fol. 83.) Such laws, however, give as much room to\r\n      the play of dishonesty as they take away from that of want of\r\n      reflection.\r\n\r\n  558 On the municipal regulations (_Städteordnungen_) of the 14th and\r\n      15th centuries, which compelled Jewish creditors especially to have\r\n      their evidences of indebtedness redeemed within from every two to\r\n      five years, see _Stobbe_, Juden im Mittelalter, 129.

According to the other provisions of the laws in North\r\n      America, some book accounts were required to be sued on within six\r\n      and others within seventeen years. (_Ebeling_, Gerchichte und\r\n      Erdberschreibung der v. Staaten, II, 247, 298.) The Prussian law of\r\n      March 31, 1838, provides a period of limitation of three years for\r\n      all ordinary commercial debts. A similar law was passed in the\r\n      Kingdom of Saxony, in 1846. In London, there has been found a great\r\n      number of hatters, tailors, boot and shoe dealers etc., whose books\r\n      showed credits of more than £4,000, most of them not to exceed over\r\n      £10. How much of all this must be lost entirely, and how that loss\r\n      must increase the sums paid for boots, shoes and hats by the prompt\r\n      payer! (_McCulloch_, v. Credit.)

There was, in 1792, a case of a woman who, for\r\n      a debt of £19, remained in prison 45 years, and others like it. (See\r\n      _Archenholtz_, Annalen, IX, 87 ff; X, 169 ff, XIII, 125.) In England\r\n      in 1844, arrest for sums less than £19 was prohibited. _Johnson_ had\r\n      already proposed a similar provision. (Idler, 1758, Nos. 22 and 38.)\r\n      Imprisonment for debt was abolished in France, England and Austria\r\n      in 1867; in the North German Confederation, on the 29th of May,\r\n      1868, but arrest for security’s sake was retained. _Sismondi_ finds\r\n      fault with nearly all laws in the premises, because they attack the\r\n      person of the debtor rather than his personal property, and his\r\n      personal, rather than his immovable, property. He would have all\r\n      this just the contrary of what it is. The first interferes with the\r\n      very source of wealth, the productive power of labor; the second\r\n      causes goods to be sold much below their value. Neither of these\r\n      evils attends the last. (_N. Principes_, I, 250.)\r\n\r\n  562 A law of the North German Confederation allows the pledging of\r\n      future wages, only in the case of public officers, and those holding\r\n      permanent places in the service of private parties, whose salaries\r\n      are over 400 thalers per annum. The original draft had excepted only\r\n      the things necessary to workmen and those directly depending on\r\n      them; while the law as passed makes the prohibition general. This\r\n      was undoubtedly done for the convenience of employers as well as of\r\n      courts; as for instance in the circuit of Dortmund, there were, in\r\n      one year, 10,000 cases in which wages were garnisheed. (Annalen des\r\n      N.D. Bundes und Zollvereins, 1869, 1071 ff.) But the recklessness of\r\n      those workmen whose wages are below the average, might have been\r\n      just as well guarded against without dragging those whose wages are\r\n      above the average down to their level, if a distinction had been\r\n      made between production-credit and consumption-credit, and the\r\n      latter had been limited by providing that no suit should be\r\n      instituted for supplies made to public houses, taverns etc.\r\n\r\n  563 In the second book of _Moses_, 22, 25 ff., and the fifth, 24, 6. A\r\n      very old Norman law provides that in actions for debt, execution\r\n      should not issue against effects of the debtor which are\r\n      indispensably necessary to him to maintain his position, such as the\r\n      horses of a count or the armor of a knight. (Dialog. de Scaccario.)\r\n      Magna Charta extended this provision so as to include the\r\n      agricultural implements and cattle of the peasantry. The moment\r\n      these laws, in consequence of a false principle of humanity, except\r\n      anything but what is absolutely necessary, they injure credit. Thus,\r\n      for instance, in Brazil, a law of 1758, providing that nothing\r\n      immediately employed in or directly necessary to the production of\r\n      sugar should be seized on execution, caused great injury to the\r\n      production of sugar. (_Koster_, Travels in B., 1816, 356 ff.)\r\n\r\n  564 § 2, Cod. De Prec. Imper. Off., I, 19. The diets of the Empire had\r\n      granted such letters in the fourteenth century. (_Wachsmuth_, Europ.\r\n      Sittengesch., IV, 690.) They were granted, as a rule, only with the\r\n      previous knowledge of the Emperor, by the police ordinances of the\r\n      Empire of 1548, art. 22.\r\n\r\n  565 So in Austria, Saxony, Brunswick, the electorates of Hesse and\r\n      Baden. In Prussia, they could be granted only after a juridical\r\n      decree to that effect; and an appeal to a superior court was allowed\r\n      to reverse or affirm it. Compare _Mittermaier_ in the Archiv. für\r\n      civilist. Praxis, XVI, and also _P. de la Court_, Aanwysing der\r\n      politike Gronden en Maximen van Holland etc., 1669, I, ch. 25.\r\n      Nürnberg obtained as a privilege, in 1495, that no _moratorium_\r\n      should be valid as against its citizens. (_Roth_, Geschichte des\r\n      Nürnb. Handels, I, 86.)\r\n\r\n  566 Compare the discussions in the French National Assembly, in the\r\n      month of August, 1848. It is much less disadvantageous in times of\r\n      great commotion, when all business is brought to a stand still, to\r\n      extend the time in which bills of exchange etc. are payable. Such a\r\n      measure prevents a number of bankruptcies which the real balance of\r\n      debts due to one and owing by him does not render necessary.\r\n\r\n  567 In the persecution of the Jews in the middle ages, the so-called\r\n      _Brief-todten_ (letter-killing), or the destruction of titles, was\r\n      very common. In 1188, the French government released all crusaders\r\n      from the payment of interest on their debts, and granted them an\r\n      extension of three years’ time to pay off the principal.\r\n      (_Sismondi_, Hist. des Français, VI, 82.) Similar compulsory\r\n      measures were provided against the Jews and usurers in 1223 (Ibid,\r\n      VI, 539 ff.); and in 1299 (Ordonnances, I, 1331), on the formal\r\n      request of the nobility. (Ordonnances, II, 59.) Again, in 1594,\r\n      there was a release of one-third of the interest on all national and\r\n      private debts. (_Sismondi_, XXI, 318.) The general _moratorium_ of\r\n      the Milanese for a term of eight years, introduced in 1251, after\r\n      their war with France, was of an essentially different character.\r\n      (_Sismondi_, Geschichte der italienischen Republiken, III, 155.) The\r\n      same is true of the general _indult_ granted by Philip II. in\r\n      Belgium. (_Boxhorn_, Disquisitt. politicæ, 241 ff.)\r\n\r\n  568 The abolition or release of debts, so frequent in ancient\r\n      revolutionary times, reminds us, in many ways, of the crises\r\n      precipitated in modern times by paper money and produced by the\r\n      state. The ancestors of Alcibiades and Hipponikos laid the\r\n      foundation of an immense fortune, in Solon’s time, by purchasing\r\n      land in large quantities with money borrowed from several citizens,\r\n      a short time before the abolition of debts. (_Plutarch_, Sol., 15.)\r\n\r\n  569 Enormous consumption of wax in the churches of the middle ages. In\r\n      the cathedral of Wittenberg alone, a short time before the\r\n      Reformation, more than 35,000 pounds of wax candles etc. were burned\r\n      yearly. At the same time, honey was generally used instead of sugar.\r\n      How much more important, therefore, at that time must bee-culture\r\n      have been, considered from the point of view of circulation as\r\n      compared with what it is to-day. And so in Catholic countries, a\r\n      difference in the external manifestation of religion causes the\r\n      relative importance of the consumption of fish to increase and\r\n      decrease. In 1803 there was little demand in France for ivory\r\n      crucifixes, rosaries etc. In 1844, the demand for them and for\r\n      _prie-Dieu_ for the bed-room etc. was increased. (_Mohl_,\r\n      Gewerbwissenschafliche Reise, 101.) To engage successfully in the\r\n      sale of sugar in Persia, it is necessary to know that in that\r\n      country it is liked only in little hat-shaped lumps, which are used\r\n      only as semi-voluntary gifts; and that, in such case, custom fixes\r\n      the number of lumps. (_Steinhaus_, Russlands commercielle etc.\r\n      Verhh., 151.) In the Levant, workmen prefer bars of iron which are\r\n      small and of varied form because they find it difficult to\r\n      manipulate the large ones. The English bear this in mind much better\r\n      than the Russians. (_Steinhaus._) A merchant sending wood to\r\n      Southern France must be acquainted with the form of the staves used\r\n      in the manufacture of barrels there. Compare _Büsch_, Geldumlauf,\r\n      VI, 2, 2.\r\n\r\n  570 The circulation of goods compared to the circulation of the blood:\r\n      by _Mirabeau_, Philosophie Rurale, ch. 3. _Turgot_, Sur la Formation\r\n      etc. § 69. _Canard._, Principes, ch. 6.\r\n\r\n_  571 Eiselen_, Volkswirthschaftslehre, 98 ff. If in ancient times\r\n      commerce played a much less important part than it does among the\r\n      moderns, it was, as _Montesquieu_ says, because the whole commercial\r\n      world was then more uniform in climate and the character of its\r\n      products than it is now. (Esprit des Lois, XXI, 4.)\r\n\r\n  572 Of the successive steps, sheaves, corn, flour, bread,—flour has the\r\n      greatest capacity for circulation. And, indeed, the last operation\r\n      of labor on a great many goods, because of their consequent more\r\n      narrowly specialized utility, is accompanied by a decrease in their\r\n      capacity for circulation. As an illustration, we may mention\r\n      ready-made clothing as compared with cloth. The capacity for\r\n      circulation of a commodity is very much advanced when the demand is\r\n      wont to increase with the supply, as is the case with gold and\r\n      silver, but not with learned books, optical instruments etc. Many\r\n      commodities have but little circulating capacity, because no one\r\n      desires to purchase them but at first hand. See _Menger_,\r\n      Grundsätze, I, 245 ff.\r\n\r\n_  573 Knies._, Die Eisenbahnen und ihre Wirkungen, 1853, 79.\r\n\r\n  574 Compare _Schmitthenner_, I, who calls attention and with reason to\r\n      the importance of loans on chattel mortgages. But _Berkeley_,\r\n      Querist, No. 265, remarks that a squire with a yearly income of\r\n      £1000 can, “upon an emergency,” do less good or evil than a merchant\r\n      with £20,000 ready money.\r\n\r\n  575 A very important difference between Russia and England.\r\n\r\n_  576 Storch_, Handbuch, I, 273 ff. There is also a useless circulation\r\n      which is not calculated to promote the division of labor, but to\r\n      employ idle time or idle capital, as in the case of games of hazard,\r\n      speculation in stocks, wheat etc. Even impoverishing consumption may\r\n      produce rapidity of circulation, as in Germany during the war years\r\n      1812 and 1813. (_F. G. Schulze_, N. Œkonomie, 1856, 667.) Relying on\r\n      this fact, _Hume_ (1752) on Public Credit, Discourses, No. 8, argues\r\n      in favor of the old opinion, that all circulation is wholesome and\r\n      to be encouraged. _Boisguillebert_, Traité des Grains, I, 6, went so\r\n      far as to laud war because it accelerated the circulation of wealth.\r\n      On the necessity of a _circulation sans repos_, see ibid., II, 10.\r\n      In a similar way _Law_, Trade and Money, 1705, and _Dutos_,\r\n      Réflexions Politiques sur le Commerce, over-valued the circulation\r\n      of wealth as such. Concerning the Mercantile System, see § 116.\r\n      _Darjes_, Erste Gründe der Cameralwissenschaft, 1768, 531. And even\r\n      _Büsch_, Geldumlauf, I, 29, 32 ff., III, 96, who in other places\r\n      nearly always overlooks real production and sees only the\r\n      circulation of money caused thereby. Thus he calls the poor when\r\n      they are helped in money, and spend it, useful members of society!\r\n      (IV, 32, 39. Similarly, _v. Struensee_, Abhandlungen, 1800, I, 282\r\n      ff., 400 ff.)\r\n\r\n  577 As, for instance, happened in France in 1577, when all commerce, and\r\n      in 1585 all industry, were declared to be _de droit domanial_. Louis\r\n      XIV. was of opinion that the king was absolute master of all private\r\n      property of priests and people. (Mémoires histor. de Louis XIV., II,\r\n      121.) Compare _Duclos_, Mémoires, I, 14 ff.\r\n\r\n  578 Compare Theod. Cod., V, 9, 1; Just. Cod., X, 19, 8; XI, 47, 21, 23;\r\n      XI, 50, 51, 52, 55, 58. How full the really classic period of the\r\n      Roman jurists was of the idea of freedom of competition, we see in\r\n      _Paullus_: L. 22, § 3, Dig. XIX, 2. The provisions concerning _lœsio\r\n      enormis_ appear first in the time of Diocletian. (Just. Cod., IV,\r\n      44, 2.)\r\n\r\n_  579 Benjamin Franklin_ says that the freer the form of government is,\r\n      the more the people show themselves in their true aspect. Ancient\r\n      Rome, with the early development of its rational disposition, soon\r\n      learned to favor freedom of commercial intercourse. Compare\r\n      _Mommsen_, Römische Geschichte, I, passim. This was, certainly, an\r\n      element of its greatness, but also of the proletarian evils\r\n      developed in it an early date, and which were weighed down only by\r\n      the absolute growth of the state and the development of its economic\r\n      interests during centuries.\r\n\r\n  580 Nor must it be forgotten that competition raises prices as well as\r\n      lowers them. The expressions higher price and lower price denote\r\n      only different sides of the same relation. _M. Chevalier_ is of\r\n      opinion that our present breathless competition is characteristic\r\n      only of a period of transition prolific in new inventions, a\r\n      competition soon to be followed by peace. (Cours, II, 450 ff.)\r\n\r\n  581 Ἀγαθὴ ἔρις: Hesiod., Opp., 10 ff.\r\n\r\n  582 “Whoever speaks of competition suppresses the existence of a common\r\n      aim,” says _Proudhon_, although he adds, after _Bileam’s_ way, that\r\n      to cure the evils of competition by competition, is as absurd as to\r\n      lead men to liberty by liberty, or to cultivate the mind by\r\n      cultivation of the mind.\r\n\r\n  583 Compare _Bastiat_, Harmonies économiques, ch. 10.\r\n\r\n  584 If all classes were protected against competition, no class would\r\n      derive any advantage from it, since a “universal privilege” is an\r\n      absurdity. If only certain classes or individuals are protected, it\r\n      is done at the cost of all others.\r\n\r\n  585 The question should not be formulated thus: “Caprice or rule?” but\r\n      “Rule of morals, or rule of law?” _Schmoller_ against _v.\r\n      Treitschke_ in _Hildebrand’s_ Jahrbb.\r\n\r\n  586 Concerning the arguments by which the commercial restrictions of the\r\n      middle ages were defended, see below. They were, for the most part,\r\n      well founded for the age in which they were advanced. A judicious\r\n      education will often be compelled to provide limitations, but always\r\n      with the intention, by this means, of making possible a really\r\n      greater independence. Thus the current of commerce may be too weak\r\n      in a poor and thinly settled country in order that supply and demand\r\n      should always and everywhere meet and be satisfied. Under such\r\n      circumstances, their artificial concentration at certain points is\r\n      among the most efficient means of promoting the economy of the whole\r\n      people. The policy of freedom of commerce was recommended even in\r\n      the seventeenth century by _J. Child_, by _North_ and _Davenant. W.\r\n      Roscher_, Zur Geschichte der englisch. Volkswirthschaftslehre, 65\r\n      ff., 85 ff., 113 ff., 142 ff. And earlier yet, in Holland, by\r\n      _Salmasius_, De Usurus, 1638, 583 and _de la Court_. Compare\r\n      Tübinger Ztschr., 330 ff. Thus _Boisguillebert_ says: _Il n’y avait\r\n      qu’à laisser faire la nature et la libertê, qui est le\r\n      commissionaire de cette même nature_. (Factum de la France, 1707,\r\n      ch. 5.) See, also, Dissertation sur la Nature des Richesses, ch. VI;\r\n      Détail de la France, 1697, II, ch. 13; Tr. des Grains, II, 8.

Decker_, Essay on the Causes of the Decline of Foreign Trade,\r\n      1744, 31 ff, 106 ff. _J. Tucker_, Essay on the advantages and\r\n      disadvantages which respectively attend France and Great Britain\r\n      with regard to Trade, 1750. _Forbonnais_, Elémens du Commerce, 1754,\r\n      I, 63. _Genovesi_, c. I, 17, 3, is of opinion that at least in case\r\n      of doubt, commerce stood more in need of freedom than of protection.\r\n      _Verri_, in his Meditazioni, goes still farther. The Physiocrates,\r\n      with their _laissez aller_ and _laissez faire_ recommend competition\r\n      as the best means to increase the net income of a people. According\r\n      to _Dupont_, 147 ff, éd. Daire, the province of legislation is\r\n      confined to declaring the laws of nature. His motto is: _liberté and\r\n      propriété_. _Adam Smith_ asks that the state should do only three\r\n      things: insure protection against foreign states, the administration\r\n      of justice at home, the establishment and maintenance of certain\r\n      institutions of advantage to the whole community, but which private\r\n      interest could not establish for want of means to cover the expenses\r\n      attending them. (Wealth of Nations, V, ch. I, 2.) Hence he demands\r\n      (III, ch. 2) the abolition of all kinds of _fidei commissa_, of\r\n      royalty in mines (I, ch. 11, 2), of all corporate and exclusive\r\n      privileges, of all protective duties etc. (IV, ch. I ff), but\r\n      especially of the colonial policy hitherto in vogue. (IV, ch. 8.)\r\n\r\n      The attacks of the Socialists on freedom of competition were begun\r\n      by _Fichte_, Geschlossener Handelsstaat, 126, in which it is called\r\n      a robber-system or system of spoliation. He would have the state\r\n      have more solicitude for human industry than if men were so many\r\n      swallows. See further, _Sismondi_, N. Principes, passim, who\r\n      everywhere demands the protection of the government for the weaker.\r\n      _Fourier_, N. Monde industriel, 396, who thinks that _le monopole\r\n      général_ is always a _preservatif contre le commerce_. _Bastiat_,\r\n      Harmonies économiques, ch. 10, has a very valuable refutation of\r\n      these follies. Recently, _Rodbertus_, Hildebrand’s Jahrbücher, 1865,\r\n      II, 272, is of opinion that “social individualism” has ever had in\r\n      history the task of dissolving decaying societies, as, for instance,\r\n      under the Cæsars.\r\n\r\n  587 Whoever would sell to others must purchase of them. (_Child._,\r\n      Discourse of Trade, 358.) Similarly _Temple_, Works III, 19, and\r\n      _Becher_, Polit. Discurs, 1547. This view seems to have become the\r\n      national one first in Holland. Compare also _Quesnay_, 71 and\r\n      _Mirabeau_, Philosophie rurale, 1763, ch. 2.\r\n\r\n  588 We often hear it said: “nothing sells because there is no money.”\r\n      But the real cause here is, in most instances, not a want of money,\r\n      but a want of other goods which might serve as a counter-value. In\r\n      bad times, for instance, there is many a weaver who would consider\r\n      himself fortunate, even if he could get no money for his cloth, to\r\n      obtain instead, meat, bread, wood, raw material etc. If money only\r\n      were wanting, that might easily be as favorable a symptom in\r\n      commerce, as when there are not enough shops, steamers etc., to\r\n      carry on the business of the country. Compare _North._, Discourses\r\n      upon Trade, 1691, 11 seq., but especially _J. B. Say’s_ celebrated\r\n      theory of Markets, traité I, ch. XV.\r\n\r\n  589 See _Humboldt’s_ observations as to how, in Spanish America,\r\n      agriculture in the vicinity of the mines increases and decreases\r\n      with the wealth of the latter. (N. Espagne, III, 11 ff.) See also\r\n      _Harrington_ (ob. 1677), On the Prerogative of a Popular Government,\r\n      I, ch. 11; _Cantillon_, Nature du Commerce, 16. And so _Stein._,\r\n      Lehrbuch, 122 seq., points out how great enterprises produce\r\n      especially for the consumption of the small householder without\r\n      capital, and how, therefore, the flourishing condition of the one\r\n      determines that of the other.\r\n\r\n  590 Those indeed who live by the spoliation of others, as robbers,\r\n      deceivers etc. are interested in the economic prosperity of the\r\n      latter only so long as their spoliation of them is not endangered.\r\n      Only to this extent can it be claimed with _Fr. List_ that the\r\n      nobility of the Middle Ages, in obeying the selfish calculation\r\n      which led to the oppression of the peasantry, engaged in as bad a\r\n      speculation as a manufacturer of our day would who should feed his\r\n      steam-engine with nothing but saw-dust or scraps of old paper. The\r\n      cities of the middle ages had a much more undoubted economic\r\n      interest in the emancipation of the peasantry as a class than the\r\n      nobles or the clergy.\r\n\r\n  591 Such exceptions there certainly are, even if it were not true “that\r\n      the most godly cannot rest in peace unless he is acceptable to his\r\n      ungodly neighbor.” Nations that furnish the same products as we do\r\n      may, indeed, “spoil our market,” just as at home the selfish\r\n      shoemaker may desire the prosperity of all wearers of shoes, that is\r\n      of all other industries, but not that of all other producers of\r\n      shoes. The view that long prevailed, that one man’s gain was always\r\n      some other man’s loss (_Th. Morus_, Utopia 79, ed. Colon. 1555;\r\n      _Baco._, Sermones fideles, cap. 15; _quid-quid alicubi adiicitur,\r\n      alibi detrahitur_; _M. Montaigne, Essais_ I, 21: _les prouficit de\r\n      l’un est le dommage de l’autre_) prevailed much longer in\r\n      international affairs where observation is much more difficult than\r\n      in national affairs; although even here, _P. de la Court_, Maximes\r\n      politiques, 1658, contrasts the economic interest of Holland with\r\n      that of the rest of the Netherlands and prefers it to theirs. Even\r\n      _Voltaire_ says: “The desire of the greatness of the Fatherland\r\n      includes the desire of evil to our neighbor. Evidently no country\r\n      can gain except what another loses.” (Dict. philosophique, v.\r\n      Patrie.) Compare, however, the _peut-être_ in his Histoire de la\r\n      Russie, I, 1, on the occasion of the English-Russian treaty of\r\n      commerce. Similarly, _Galiani_, Della Moneta, I, 1, IV, 1; _Verri_,\r\n      Opuscoli, 335, and recently _v. Cancrin_ who says that “in every-day\r\n      life, property is acquired only at some other person’s expense.”\r\n      (Weltreichthum, 1821, 119. Oekonomie der menschl. Gesellschaft,\r\n      1845, 23.) The cosmopolitan view (_Xenoph._, Cyrop., III, 2, 17.\r\n      Hier., 10) which prevails in Adam Smith’s school was introduced by\r\n      _Hume_, Essays, 1752, On the Jealousy of Trade. _Quesnay_,\r\n      Encyclopédie, v. Grains, 294, ed. Daire; _A. Smith_, Theory of moral\r\n      Sentiments, 1759, p. 6, sec. 2, ch. 2. _Pinto_, Lettre sur la\r\n      Jalousie de Commerce, 1771, and _J. Tucker_, Four Tracts on\r\n      commercial and political Subjects, 1776, 34 ff and 42 ff. “The\r\n      system of states exercises no influence whatever on the world’s\r\n      commerce.” (_Lotz_, Handbuch I, 11.) More recently, _R. Cobden_, in\r\n      his Russia, Edinb., 1836, among others argued, that the conquest of\r\n      Turkey by the Russians would be useful to England, because then more\r\n      (?) English products would probably be sold there. Russia would\r\n      become no stronger thereby, as conquests always injure the conqueror\r\n      more than they benefit him. The idea of European equilibrium is\r\n      therefore a chimera, because no state can be prevented from having\r\n      an internal growth, as great as may be. Thus, in the summer of 1853,\r\n      we heard the London Times sometimes preach that every cannon-shot\r\n      fired by the English at the Russians might kill an English debtor or\r\n      an English customer. The Venetians entertained a similar view at the\r\n      beginning of the fifteenth century. Compare _M. Sanudo_ in\r\n      _Muratori_, Scriptores, XXII, 950 ff. See above, § 12.\r\n\r\n      Moreover, Malthus had recognized that there were natural rivalries\r\n      between nations which produced exceptions to Tucker’s laws.\r\n      (Principles, Preface.) Similarly _Garve_, in Cicero’s Pflichten\r\n      (1783), III, 146 ff.\r\n\r\n_  592 B. Franklin_, Works, vol. III, 49. _Sismondi_ claims for all\r\n      civilized nations the right of interfering with the governments of\r\n      other nations with whom they have or might have commercial\r\n      relations, and of insisting that they shall have a good government\r\n      under which commerce may freely develop. (N. P. VII, ch. 4.)\r\n\r\n  593 As for instance when the _ami des hommes_ says that he felt towards\r\n      an Englishman or a German as he did towards a Frenchman with whom he\r\n      was not acquainted. _Mirabeau_, Philosophie rurale, ch. 6.\r\n\r\n  594 Thus, for instance, the Stoic, Zeno: _Plutarch._ De Alex, fort, 1,\r\n      6.\r\n\r\n  595 Compare even _Lauderdale_, Inquiry, 274 ff.\r\n\r\n  596 How well, for instance, the English sustained Napoleon’s continental\r\n      blockade, the evils produced by which were intensified by several\r\n      bad harvests. Its worst time did not, indeed, coincide with that of\r\n      the struggle with the United States. The ancient Athenians, during\r\n      their contest with Philip of Macedon, considered the question of the\r\n      supplies from the Bosphorus etc. as one of life and death. But this\r\n      can be looked upon only as a cogent proof of the small development\r\n      which their commercial talents had received at the time. How easily\r\n      might they not, according to our ideas, have obtained corn from\r\n      Sicily or Egypt.\r\n\r\n  597 According to the acute analysis of language made by _F. J. Neumann_,\r\n      Tübinger Ztschr., 1872, 317 ff., the word “price” has reference to\r\n      an actual purchase or sale, while the expression “value in\r\n      exchange,” generally called simply value, is based upon a valuation,\r\n      or intimates in a general way that an object possesses value; value\r\n      in exchange is, so to speak, the average of several\r\n      price-determinations. Price, according to _Schäffle_, is the\r\n      external consequence of value in exchange, a means of representing\r\n      the latter. (N. Œk., III, Aufl., I, 218.) Only through the\r\n      difference between value in exchange (universal possibility) and\r\n      price (special reality) is the _laesio enormis_ of the jurists\r\n      possible. (_Schmitthenner_, Staatswissenschen, I, 416.)\r\n\r\n  598 By market price, _prix courant_, is meant the money-price of\r\n      commodities, determined by competition.\r\n\r\n  599 A problem very similar to that of the motion of bodies in space.\r\n\r\n_  600 Lotz_, Handbuch, 50 ff., calls those commodities costly which are\r\n      obtained only at a high cost of production, and dear, those whose\r\n      price is above the cost of production.\r\n\r\n  601 Compare _Canard_, Principes d’Economie politique, ch. 3. Almost\r\n      simultaneously, _H. Thornton_, 1802, Paper-Credit of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n  602 See _Jackson’s_ Account of Morocco, 284, for cases in which, in the\r\n      Sahara, when the burning winds of the desert had dried up the water\r\n      in the leathern bottles of the caravan, a drink of water cost from\r\n      $10 to $500.\r\n\r\n  603 The North American aborigines very frequently consent, in their\r\n      exchanges, to take any offer made to them by their equals, however\r\n      insufficient it may be, because they fear revenge. _Schoolcraft_,\r\n      Information etc., II, 178. As to the effects of cunning, the\r\n      Tungusi, when they get a glass of brandy from the Russians, grow\r\n      almost idiotic, and give away their goods at mock-prices in drink.\r\n      (_v. Wrangell_, Nachrichten, I, 233.) In the higher stages of\r\n      civilization, on the other hand, very distinguished people are, by\r\n      no means, privileged because of their position, in the struggle for\r\n      prices. In modern times, claims (_reclamen_) have taken the place of\r\n      greater physical or political power. Compare _E. Hermann_, Leitfaden\r\n      der Wirthschaftslehre 1870, 91 ff.\r\n\r\n  604 Thus _Galiani_ says, that before one of the two parties has\r\n      expressed his want to buy or to sell, the pans of the scales are in\r\n      equilibrium. The first that speaks breathes on one of them, and it\r\n      drops. (Dialogue sur le Commerce des Bleds, 1770, No. 6.) This has\r\n      been verified in a striking manner in California, where the most\r\n      valuable commodities were often purchased at auction at the lowest\r\n      prices, while when purchased from merchants and even the most\r\n      wretched shopkeepers, they were sold enormously dear. (_Gerstäcker_,\r\n      in the Allg. Zeitg., May, 1850.) Thus there were harvested in\r\n      France, in 1817, 48,000,000 hectolitres of wheat, valued at\r\n      2,046,000,000 francs, in 1820, 44,500,000 hectolitres valued at\r\n      895,000,000 francs. (_Cordier._) This vast difference in price\r\n      existed, because in 1817, the whole world was still trembling under\r\n      the impression made by the failure of the crops in 1816, while in\r\n      1820, the feeling of comfort and security caused by the rich year\r\n      1819, still prevailed. Low prices at forced sales under decree etc.\r\n      See below, § 5. That travelers are so frequently taken advantage of\r\n      in effecting changes of money is explainable partly by their urgent\r\n      wants, which are well known to the opposite party, and partly by\r\n      their supposed ignorance in the matter. And so, at auction sales,\r\n      out-bidding one another has something very seductive in it for\r\n      ignorant or hot-headed purchasers.\r\n\r\n  605 It was considered immoral by his contemporaries, when William the\r\n      Conqueror introduced the custom of farm-letting to the highest\r\n      bidder. (_A. Thierry_, Conquête de l’Angleterre, II, 116, éd.\r\n      Bruxelles.) It is repugnant to poetic and delicate minds to think\r\n      that everything has a price exactly fixed. (§ 2.) I need only refer\r\n      to the picture of Helen which Zeuxis exhibited for money, which act\r\n      of his was characterized, by his cotemporaries, as a species of\r\n      prostitution. _Val.

As early a writer as _Sir J. Stewart_ calls attention to\r\n      the difference between large and high and small and low demand. A\r\n      high demand will always raise the price, as when, for instance, two\r\n      wealthy virtuosi compete at an auction. _Paucorum furore pretiosa_,\r\n      as Seneca says. An English penny of the time of Henry VII, once\r\n      sold, on such an occasion, for £600. In 1868, at the Lafitte\r\n      auction, seven bottles of wine sold to Rothschild at 235 francs a\r\n      piece after the _Maison dorée_ had offered 233. (N. freie Presse,\r\n      Dec. 17, 1868.) A great demand has frequently no result but to\r\n      increase the supply, and the price rises only in so far as the\r\n      demand is too sudden to permit a parallel growth of the supply.\r\n      (Principles, Book II, ch. 2, 10.) The present price of tea could not\r\n      remain unaffected, if ten different private merchants, competing one\r\n      with another, or the agent of a privileged commercial society,\r\n      should send orders to China for an equal quantity of tea. (_Verri_,\r\n      Meditazioni, IV, 8 ff.)\r\n\r\n  608 Immense weight laid on the _æqualitas permutationis_ (after\r\n      _Aristot._, Eth. Nicom., V. 7,) in the ethics and economics of the\r\n      scholastic middle ages, and in the time of the Reformation. Compare\r\n      _Melancthon_, in Corp. Ref., XVI, 495 ff, XXII, 230.\r\n\r\n  609 A very barbarous theory of price in _Xenoph._, De Vectigg., 4. The\r\n      ancients made little progress in this respect, although there are\r\n      not wanting ingenious observations on certain phenomena of prices.\r\n      (See _Aristot._, (?) Oecon. II; _Cicero_, De Off. III, 12 ff.)\r\n      _Mariana_, De Rege et Regis Institutione, 1598, III, explains price\r\n      as the relation of value to quantity. According to _Locke_, the\r\n      price of a thing is determined by the relation between “quantity”\r\n      and “vent”: the increase or diminution of its useful qualities\r\n      influences it only so far as it alters that relation.\r\n      (Considerations on the Consequences of the Lowering of Interest etc,\r\n      1691, Works II, 20 ff.) _Law_, on the contrary, says that the “vent”\r\n      can never be greater than the “quantity,” but that the “demand” may\r\n      be. Wherefore, he proposes the formula: quantity in proportion to\r\n      the demand. (Trade and Commerce considered, 1705, ch. 1.) In chap.\r\n      6, _Law_ distinguishes three elements in price: quality, quantity\r\n      and demand. The expression “quantity” is, certainly, very\r\n      unsatisfactory. How many examples does not _Tooke_ (Thoughts and\r\n      Details, on the high and low Prices of the last thirty Years, 1823,\r\n      part IV) give to illustrate how, when the supply was smallest,\r\n      prices were lowest and _vice versa_! It was so almost always after\r\n      the market was over-filled, when a great many speculators had lost\r\n      and no one dared to purchase anew. _Montanari_ (ob. 1687) furnishes\r\n      us with an excellent theory of prices. (Della Moneta, 64 ff.,\r\n      Custodi.) And a still better one, _Sam. Pufendorf_, Jus Naturæ et\r\n      Gentium, 1672, V. 1, who must be considered the best authority on\r\n      the laws of prices before _Stewart_. _Boisguillebert_, Traité des\r\n      Grains, II, 1, 10. _Galiani_, Della Moneta, I, 2, knows only the\r\n      factors _utilità_, and _rarità_, although in his exposition of the\r\n      latter, he discusses many points which would be called the cost of\r\n      production in our time. The wisdom of Providence has granted us the\r\n      most useful things in the greatest abundance to make them cheap.\r\n      _Stewart_, Principles II, 2, 4, rendered a great service to the\r\n      theory of prices, tracing back supply to the cost of production,\r\n      demand to want and ability to pay; and his deserves to be called the\r\n      immediate predecessor of _Hermann’s_ remarkable theory. (_Hermann_,\r\n      Staatsw. Untersuchungen, 66 ff.) For a peculiar theory of prices,\r\n      see _Paganini_, Saggio sopra il giusto Pregio delle Cose, 189 ff.\r\n      _Neri_, Osservazioni, 1751, 127. _Gust. Menger_, Grundsätze, I, 179\r\n      ff., has made an interesting attempt to explain the formation of\r\n      prices in its simplest shape, in the supposition of a monopoly in\r\n      the seller, and by then going over to the subsequent modifications\r\n      introduced by the competition of many sellers.\r\n\r\n  610 “Instead of separating, in the same matter, the points of view of\r\n      the buyer and seller, we may distinguish the consideration of the\r\n      thing to be acquired and the thing to be given by one and the same\r\n      person.” (_Rau._) The possessor of the more current commodity\r\n      appears especially as demanding, that of the less current as\r\n      offering or supplying, (_v. Mangoldt._)\r\n\r\n  611 This is for free goods=0, for monopolized goods=1/0.\r\n\r\n  612 The obvious fact that every price supposes a comparison of two\r\n      commodities, and that every buyer is, at the same time, a seller,\r\n      has been overlooked by only too many writers. And hence _Dutot’s_\r\n      opinion, that, as all men buy and few only sell, the state, in case\r\n      of doubt, should favor the buyer. (Réflexions sur le Commerce et les\r\n      Finances, 1738, 962, éd. Daire.) And so the often-mooted question\r\n      whether universal dearness or cheapness is more useful: the latter\r\n      advocated, for instance, by _Herbert_, Police générale des Grains,\r\n      1755; _Verri_, Meditazioni, V; the former by _Boisguillebert_,\r\n      Traité des Grains, I, 7, II, 9; and by the Physiocrates. (_Quesnay_,\r\n      Maximes générales, Nr. 18 ff., I, Problème Économique; also by _A.\r\n      Young_, Polit. Arithmetics, ch. 8.) The laity in Political Economy\r\n      understand by dearness only the general cheapness of the medium of\r\n      circulation or exchange, and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\n  613 Thus, even a poor man in Naples sometimes requires a glass of\r\n      ice-water. The introduction of the extensive use of snow into Sicily\r\n      improved the condition of the public health. (_Rehfues_, Gemälde von\r\n      Neapel, I, 37 ff.) On the other hand, furs, in the far north, are\r\n      articles of prime necessity. Newspapers in a free country satisfy a\r\n      want much more urgent than in countries which are not free. And so,\r\n      _Senior_ says that shoes are “necessaries” to all Englishmen, since\r\n      without them, their health would suffer. To the lower classes of\r\n      Scotland they are “luxuries.” Custom permits them to go barefoot\r\n      without hardship or degradation. For the middle classes of the same\r\n      country, they are “decencies.” Shoes are worn there, not to protect\r\n      the feet but one’s civil position. In Turkey, tobacco is a decency\r\n      and wine a luxury. The reverse is the case in England. (Outlines, 36\r\n      ff.)\r\n\r\n  614 As to the relativity of the opposites of “temperance” and “excess,”\r\n      every person should attend to the following points: a, not to exceed\r\n      one’s income; b, to provide for one’s self and one’s family; c, to\r\n      lay by something for a rainy day; d, to place one’s self in a\r\n      position to care for the poor; e, to indulge in no pleasure\r\n      injurious to body or mind; f, to give no bad example. (_Tucker_, Two\r\n      Sermons, 29 ff.) _Menger_, Grundsätze, I, 92 ff., endeavors to\r\n      compare the value in use of different commodities from the point of\r\n      view, that the means of gratification of a less urgent want, when\r\n      the more urgent wants of the present are satisfied completely,\r\n      should be preferred to the means of over-gratifying the latter.\r\n\r\n  615 Thus the price of many dark articles of apparel rises in a moment of\r\n      unexpected universal mourning. A very remarkable case in Paris, at\r\n      the death of Henry II. (_Montanari_, Delia Moneta, 85, Custodi.) On\r\n      the other hand, a change of fashion may greatly depress the price of\r\n      many commodities. Such a change may take place even in the case of\r\n      precious stones; as, for instance, now in London, a perfect emerald\r\n      is most highly prized. (_King_, Precious Stones and Metals, 1871.)\r\n      The rise of many drugs in times of cholera, and of leeches, for\r\n      example, in Paris, 600 per cent. Rise of the price of powder, horses\r\n      etc. at the outbreak of a war, and of the price of iron caused by\r\n      extensive railroad building. In Circassia, a good shirt of mail was\r\n      formerly worth from 10 to 200 oxen: but since it was discovered not\r\n      to be a protection against cannon balls, its price fell 50 per cent.\r\n      (_Bell_, Journal of a Residence in Circassia, I, 403.)\r\n\r\n  616 On “connected” (_connexen_) goods, the use of one of which supposes\r\n      the use of the other, as, for instance, sugar and coffee, wood and\r\n      stone used in the construction of buildings, see _Schäffle_,\r\n      Nat.-Oek, II. Aufl., 179.\r\n\r\n  617 Observed by _Necker_, Sur la Législation et le Commerce des Grains,\r\n      1776. Compare _Roscher_, Ueber Kornhandel und Theuerungspolitik,\r\n      1853, 1 ff. In Athens, for instance, the _medimnos_ of wheat cost\r\n      ordinarily five drachmas, but during the siege by Sulla it rose to\r\n      1000 drachmas. (_Demosth._ adv. Phorm., 918. _Plutarch_, Sulla, 13.)\r\n      Compare II. Kings, 6, 25, 7, 1. In Paris during the siege by Henry\r\n      IV. it rose to 5000 per cent. of the ordinary price. (_Lauderdale_,\r\n      Inquiry, 60 ff.) During the siege of Breisach, in 1638, a mouse was\r\n      finally worth 1 florin, the quarter of a dog, 7 florins, a quarter\r\n      of wheat, 80 thalers. (_Röse_, Leben H. Bernhards, M., 11, 269.)\r\n      Compare _Strabo_, V, 248 seq.\r\n\r\n  618 Wheat is still more indispensable than meat. Hence, in the ten\r\n      principal markets of Prussia, the price of rye rose much more from\r\n      1811 to 1860 than the price of beef; the former between 0.32 and\r\n      1.03 silver groschens and the latter between 2.32 and 4.94 silver\r\n      groschens. (Annalen der preussischen Landwirthschaft, 1869, No. 9.)\r\n      And so in the Rhine district, the wine harvests have undergone much\r\n      greater changes in price than the prices of must, although the years\r\n      differed very largely in the quality of the yield. Thus the crop of\r\n      1830 was only 225, that of 1868, 10,845 pieces, and yet the minimum\r\n      price between 1831 and 1865 was only from 3 to 58 flr. per ome.\r\n      (_Engel_, Preuss. Statist., Ztschr., 1871, 168 ff.)\r\n\r\n  619 In England, the price of wheat has not unfrequently risen from 100\r\n      to 200 per cent. when the harvest was from one-sixth to one-third\r\n      under the average, and when a supply from abroad had modified even\r\n      this condition of things. (_Tooke_, History of Prices, I, 10 ff.)\r\n      _Tooke_ is of opinion that in a country with poor-laws like those of\r\n      England, a deficit of one-third in the wheat crop, if there were no\r\n      stores remaining and no importation from abroad, would cause the\r\n      price of wheat to rise, 500, 600, and even 1000 per cent (p. 15.)\r\n\r\n  620 See _Davenant_, Political and Commercial Works, London, 1771, II,\r\n      224. Tooke was somewhat acquainted with Davenant. According to this\r\n      law, a deficit in the harvest of 10 per cent. would raise the price\r\n      of corn 30 per cent.; one of 20 per cent. would raise the price of\r\n      corn 80 per cent.; one of 30 per cent. would raise the price of corn\r\n      160 per cent.; one of 40 per cent. would raise the price of corn 280\r\n      per cent.; one of 50 per cent. would raise the price of corn 450 per\r\n      cent.\r\n\r\n  621 In England, it is 38.8 per cent. of the supply that comes to the\r\n      market. (Quart. Review, XXXVI, 425.) In Belgium 40, and in Saxony at\r\n      least 50 per cent. (_Engel_, Jahrb. der Statistik etc. von Sachsen,\r\n      I, 276.) In Germany, the farmers consume on an average two-thirds\r\n      themselves. (_v. Viebahn_, Zoll.-v-Statist., II, 958.) With this\r\n      _Plato_, De Legg., VIII, agrees remarkably well.\r\n\r\n  622 On the difference in this respect between England, Germany and\r\n      northwestern Norway, see _Hermann_, p. 71.\r\n\r\n  623 Hence it not unfrequently happens that grain grows dear not from any\r\n      real want of it, but because it is generally supposed that such want\r\n      exists. For an explanation of why it is that wheat and similar\r\n      commodities have an almost invariable price, when the average is\r\n      taken of a long series of years, see _infra_ § 129.\r\n\r\n  624 Case in Naples in which after a poor harvest the price of corn\r\n      remained very low, because the oil-harvest had also failed, and the\r\n      poor could earn nothing in that industry in which they were largely\r\n      employed, and _vice versa_. (_Galliani_, Della Moneta, II, 2.) Thus\r\n      _Adam Smith_, Wealth of Nations, I, ch. 7, distinguishes between\r\n      “effectual” and “absolute” demand. Similarly _J. Steuart_,\r\n      Principles I, ch. 18. Care should be taken to distinguish in this\r\n      respect between desire and demand.\r\n\r\n  625 Thus, in the famine in Ireland in 1821, during which potatoes rose\r\n      to fabulous prices, but wheat scarcely at all, and had therefore to\r\n      be exported.\r\n\r\n  626 In _Tooke_, History of Prices (2d edition of the Thoughts and\r\n      Details etc.), we meet repeatedly with the assertion that when the\r\n      price of wheat rises, the price of colonial products and\r\n      manufactured articles sinks, and _vice versa_. Thus, in England, the\r\n      price of the evidences of national debt increases from two to three\r\n      per cent. in fruitful years above what it is after a bad harvest.\r\n      (_Lauderdale_, Inquiry, 93.) The British nation paid for the cotton\r\n      it needed for their own consumption in 1845 over £19,500,000; in\r\n      1847 only £9,500,000. (_Banfield_, Organization of Industry, 162.)\r\n\r\n  627 Hence _J. B. Say_ has said that the disposable wealth of a people is\r\n      like a pyramid, with the scale of prices of the various commodities\r\n      inscribed on its side. The higher a commodity is in this scale of\r\n      prices, the smaller is the corresponding section of the pyramid.\r\n      Compare _Sir W. Temple_, Essay on the Origin and Nature of\r\n      Government, Works I, 23 ff.\r\n\r\n  628 This fact, in connection with the preceding, explains the well known\r\n      puzzle, why the remnant of a piece of goods is comparatively cheaper\r\n      than the whole piece, while a small share in the public debt is\r\n      dearer than a large one. (_Lauderdale_, ch. 1.)\r\n\r\n  629 Rhode Island was, it is said, bought from the Indians in 1638 for a\r\n      pair of spectacles. (_B. Franklin_, Political ... Pieces, 1707.)\r\n      According to _Chalmers_, it was bought for 50 threads of coral, 12\r\n      hatchets and 12 overcoats. (Political Annals of the U. States.)\r\n      Compare _Ebeling_, II, 108. Holland cloths and opium were exchanged\r\n      for a long time at Sumatra for gold dust worth ten times their\r\n      value. (_Saalfeld_, Geschichte des holl. Kolonialwesens, I, 260.)\r\n      The Hudson Bay Company realized, it is said, at the beginning of\r\n      this century, in trading with the Indians, a profit of 2000 per\r\n      cent. (_Anderson_, Origin of Commerce, a. 1751.) When Altai was\r\n      discovered, the natives gave as many sable-skins for a Russian\r\n      kettle or boiler as could be crammed into it. With 10 rubles in iron\r\n      it was an easy easy matter to gain 500-660 rubles. _Storch_, Gemälde\r\n      des russ., R., II, 16; _K. Ritter_, Erdkunde, II, 557. Similar cases\r\n      among the Germans: _Tacit._, Germ., 5.\r\n\r\n  630 A seller not actually engaged in the business of selling for a\r\n      livelihood, and who has not purchased or produced with the intention\r\n      of selling, is apt to consider instead of this the market price,\r\n      towards the determination of which those actually engaged in trade\r\n      have coöperated. Somewhat inaccurately, the amount of the cost of\r\n      production is called by _Adam Smith_ and _Ricardo_, “natural price,”\r\n      by _J. B. Say_, _prix naturel_, also _prix originaire_, because the\r\n      commodity at its first entrance into the world cost so much.\r\n      _Sismondi_ and _Storch_ call it _prix nécessaire_, and _Lotz,\r\n      Kostenpreis. P. Cantillon_, Nature de Commerce, 33 ff., understands\r\n      by the _prix intrinsique_ of a commodity, the amount of land and\r\n      labor, taking the quality of both also into consideration, necessary\r\n      to its production.\r\n\r\n  631 The cheapest cotton thread is numbered from 60 to 80. The coarser is\r\n      dearer on account of the quantity of raw material in it, and the\r\n      finer because of the greater amount of labor in it. (_Babbage._) For\r\n      similar reasons, the Venetian chains cost per _braccio_, No. 0, the\r\n      finest, 60 francs; No. 1, 40 francs; Nos. 2 and 3, 20 francs; No.\r\n      24, coarsest, 60 francs. (_Rau._)\r\n\r\n  632 If a person engaged in production has himself furnished certain of\r\n      the elements of production; if, for instance, he has worked with his\r\n      own hands, employed his own capital etc., he is wont to charge as\r\n      much for these as they would be worth, if he hired himself out or\r\n      loaned his capital.\r\n\r\n  633 The greater number of political economists consider the cost of\r\n      production only from the standpoint of the individual engaged in\r\n      production. Thus _Darjes_, Erste Gründe, 218 seq.; _Ad. Smith_,\r\n      Wealth of Nations, I, ch. 6. _J. B. Say_ calls even production an\r\n      exchange in which the productive services of natural forces, of\r\n      labor and of capital are parted with in order to obtain products.\r\n      The estimate put upon the value of these services is the cost of\r\n      production. For some interesting examples as to how the cost of\r\n      production, in this sense, is calculated, see _Hermann_, I ed., 136\r\n      ff.\r\n\r\n_  634 Jacob_ translated by _Say_, 1807, II, 450. _Hufeland_, N.\r\n      Grundelgung, I, 309.\r\n\r\n  635 Compare _L. Lauderdale_, Inquiry, 124, against the Physiocrates.\r\n      (_Riedel_, Nat.-Oekonomie, 1838, I, 68.) A country which possesses\r\n      advantages over other countries, in respect to the cost of\r\n      production of a commodity, can offer it in the market cheapest.\r\n      Where, for instance, with the employment of the same amount of\r\n      capital, a specially large quantity of wheat can be produced,\r\n      whether it be because of the unusual fertility of the soil, or\r\n      because of the _extensiveness_ of agriculture (farming over a large\r\n      area), wheat will, the demand being the same, be specially cheap,\r\n      whatever the proportion of the three branches of income may have\r\n      been. If relatively a great number of workmen have been employed in\r\n      its cultivation, each will receive smaller wages, and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\n  636 Copper and steel engraving affords an example of the different kinds\r\n      of wear of fixed capital, and the influence it may have on prices.\r\n      _Canard_, Principes, ch. IV, considers that one of the most\r\n      important elements in the cost of production is the length of time\r\n      that capital must “stagnate” for the sake of production.\r\n\r\n  637 On this risk depends, for instance, the high price of vanilla\r\n      (_Humboldt_, N. Espagne, IV, 10,), sparkling wines and articles of\r\n      fashion.\r\n\r\n_  638 Mangoldt_, Lehre vom Unternehmergewinn, 1855, 81 ff. Compare _v.\r\n      Thünen_, Der isolirte Staat, II, 1, 80 ff.\r\n\r\n  639 Wool and mutton, brandy and fattened cattle, calves and milk, honey\r\n      and wax, gas and coke, hens and eggs etc.\r\n\r\n_  640 Adam Smith_ himself remarked that all artificial lowering of the\r\n      price of skins or wool must necessarily raise the price of the meat,\r\n      and _vice versa_. (Wealth of Nations, I, ch. 11, 3.) For a very\r\n      elaborate theory on this subject, see _J. S. Mill_, Principles, III,\r\n      ch. 16, § 1. Thus Australian wool did not rise as much in price as\r\n      the production of gold there might have led us to suppose, for the\r\n      reason that mutton rose to an exceedingly high price.\r\n\r\n  641 It is an important and correct remark of _Carey’s_, that the price\r\n      of a commodity depends much more on the cost of producing its like\r\n      than on its own cost of production, which already belongs to the\r\n      past.\r\n\r\n  642 Compare _J. S. Mill_, III, ch. 3, § 1. A much too high price, caused\r\n      by speculation, or a much too low one, by depreciation, is regularly\r\n      followed by an ebb or flow just as much too great. (_Tooke_, History\r\n      of Prices, III, 55.) And _Law_, Trade and Money, 41, remarks that\r\n      the price of a commodity always tends to coincide with the “first\r\n      cost.” This fact _Adam Smith_ expresses by saying that the cost of\r\n      production is the center about which the market price always\r\n      gravitates. (I, ch. 7.) But here there is still the error lurking,\r\n      that the producer’s profit is a part of the cost of production.\r\n      Compare _Malthus_, Definitions, ch. 6.\r\n\r\n  643 The English view, one very characteristic of the people, is that the\r\n      equilibrium of prices depends on this, that all commodities should\r\n      have a value equal to that of the labor they have cost. (Compare\r\n      _Aristot._, Eth. Nicom., V, 5.) The same doctrine is to be found in\r\n      its germinal state in _Hobbes_, Leviathan, 24, 1651, and _Rice\r\n      Vaughan_, Discourse of Coin and Coinage, 1675. More exhaustively in\r\n      _Petty_, Treatise of Taxes and Contributions, 1679, 24, 31, 67.\r\n      (Compare _Locke_, Civil government, II, § 40 ff.; _B. Franklin_,\r\n      Inquiry into the Nature and Necessity of a paper Currency, 1729;\r\n      Works, ed. Sparks, vol. II.) _Adam Smith_ admits this to be true\r\n      only of the first beginnings of society, before the origin of\r\n      property in land and in capital. (Wealth of Nations, I, ch. 5.) Most\r\n      largely developed in _Ricardo_, Principles, ch. I, 4, 30. _Marx_,\r\n      Zur Kritik der polit. Œkonomie, 1859, 6, endeavors to improve on\r\n      this by calling all values in exchange “a determinate quantity of\r\n      thickly curdled working-time,” meaning by work an averaged\r\n      _qualitätslose_, social work of production. _Per contra_, compare\r\n      _Hufeland_, N. Grundlegung, I, 134, 156 ff.; and _Malthus_,\r\n      Principles, ch. 2, secs. 2, 3, who claims very earnestly that price\r\n      is not determined by the cost of production, but by the relation\r\n      existing between demand and supply, the cost of production\r\n      influencing it only to the extent that it influences this relation.\r\n      He calls attention to the poor-rates by which the cost of production\r\n      of labor is raised, but its wages decreased; also to the case of\r\n      bank notes etc. (_Tooke_, History of Prices, V, 49 ff; _J. S. Mill_,\r\n      Principles, III, ch. 16, 2.) For a very marked case of reaction\r\n      against Adam Smith and Ricardo, see _Macleod_, Elements, ch. 2, who,\r\n      however, is much too one-sided in considering only the amount\r\n      necessary to the purchaser, and his means. Even _Condillac_ had\r\n      said: _une chose n’a pas une valeur, parcequ’elle coûte, mais elle\r\n      coûte (du travail ou de l’argent), parcequ’elle a une valeur_.\r\n      (Commerce et Gouvernement, 16.) _Ricardo’s_ doctrine is more tenable\r\n      than appears at first blush. We need only to interline his theory of\r\n      rent, admit that capital is accumulated labor, subtract all objects\r\n      constituting a natural monopoly, and not forget that the intrinsic\r\n      value of labor is one of the causes of the difference of price of\r\n      different sorts of labor. _Ricardo_ does justice to value in use\r\n      even _en passant_. A strange effort by _McCulloch_ to make labor the\r\n      cause of the non-use of capital. (Principles, III, ch. 6, 2.)\r\n      _McCulloch_ has not unfrequently exaggerated the half-truths of his\r\n      doctrines to such an extent as to produce unwittingly a _reductio ad\r\n      absurdum_. According to _Torrens_, before any separation of\r\n      capitalists from workmen, price depends entirely on the work done,\r\n      and afterwards on the capital expended, inasmuch as wages, rent etc.\r\n      are covered by the capital of the person who engages in the\r\n      enterprise. (Production of Wealth, ch. 1.)\r\n\r\n_  644 Ce que l’ on appelle chereté, c’est l’ unique remède à la chereté._\r\n      (_Dupont de Nemours._) Tenders of division in common, in England,\r\n      increase and decrease according to the higher or lower price of corn\r\n      during the preceding year. (_Tooke_, Thoughts and Details, III, 105\r\n      ff.) The cotton famine after 1861 increased the price of flax-yarn\r\n      in a short time fifty per cent., although the raw material of flax\r\n      did not rise in price, but only because care was not taken to\r\n      increase the number of flax-spinners. (_Ausland_, I, 1865.) However,\r\n      there were in 1864, 490,000 flax-machine spindles in course of\r\n      erection. (Report of the Chemnitz Chamber of Commerce, 1864, 101.)\r\n\r\n  645 By the discovery, for instance, of new natural forces, the invention\r\n      of machines, improved division of labor, improved roads etc. In\r\n      France, in consequence of technic improvement, a quintal of\r\n      saltpeter fell from 100 to 9 francs. See a similar instance in\r\n      _Chaptal_, De l’ Industrie française, II, 64, 70, 434.\r\n\r\n_  646 Hermann_, Staatsw. Untersuchungen, 212.\r\n\r\n  647 The highest but unattainable ideal of such progress would consist in\r\n      this, that all products should be obtained without cost. If this\r\n      ideal were attainable, every one would be infinitely rich and all\r\n      wealth would be free, like the air and the sunshine. (Compare _J. B.\r\n      Say_, Traité, II, 2.) The complete victory of mankind over nature\r\n      would consist in that all men should be free and all the forces of\r\n      nature the slaves of man. (_Smitthenner._) _Carey_ intimates\r\n      something similar when he says that, with the advance of\r\n      civilization the tendency is for men to become more and more\r\n      valuable and commodities to have less of “value.”\r\n\r\n  648 We might here speak of an aristocratic and democratic principle of\r\n      the determination of prices. The greater utility of the latter is\r\n      advocated in the Discourse of Trade, Coyn and Credit, London, 1697.\r\n      _Bacon_ has a good word to say for the maxim: “Light gains make\r\n      heavy purses; for light gains come thick, whereas great come now and\r\n      then.” Similarly, _Gurnay_ in _Cliquot de Blervache_, Considérations\r\n      sur le Commerce etc., 1758, 48, 54. As to how Morrison, the\r\n      celebrated merchant, became rich by adhering to the principles: “to\r\n      sell cheap as well as to buy cheap,” and “always tell the truth,”\r\n      see _Chadwick_, in the Statistical Journal, 1862, 503. Compare the\r\n      related opinion of _Adam Smith’s_ continuator in an ethical\r\n      direction, _Garve_, zu Cicero’s Pflichten, III, 100. The contrary\r\n      principle, the cunning of the Judæans, according to _Strabo_, XVII,\r\n      800, was followed by the Dutch East India Company, when it, in 1652,\r\n      caused the greater number of the vegetable roots on the Moluccas to\r\n      be destroyed. _Saalfeld_, Geschichte des holländischen\r\n      Kolonialwesens, I, 272. Also, when great quantities of roots were\r\n      destroyed by burning in the East Indies. (_Huysers_ Beschryving der\r\n      Oostindischen Etablissmenten, 1789, 22.) For a clever argument\r\n      against such practice, see _de la Court_, Anwysing der heilsame\r\n      Gronden, 1663. The principle similar to that of the patent,\r\n      mentioned in the text, works at the same time democratically and\r\n      aristocratically, both words understood in their best sense.\r\n\r\n  649 This is true, first of all, in those industries which are intimately\r\n      connected with one another, or of those which are carried on with\r\n      scarcely any fixed capital; also in lower stages of civilization,\r\n      where the lights and shades caused by a highly developed division of\r\n      labor are not very intense. On the numerous difficulties overlooked\r\n      by Ricardo in every other case, see _Sismondi_, N. P., II, ch. 2.\r\n      The workman thereby loses his former skill, that is his principal\r\n      capital, and can certainly not wait until he has acquired other and\r\n      different skill.\r\n\r\n  650 When a lowering of prices is expected, demand is less than\r\n      consumption: “postponed demand;” whereas, an expectation that the\r\n      price will rise, produces “anticipated demand.” _Tooke_, History of\r\n      Prices, II, 155.\r\n\r\n  651 Thus, for instance, if the workmen were exposed to starvation, or\r\n      were likely to take their departure; if great stores of raw material\r\n      were in danger of spoiling; if fixed capital of great value were\r\n      engaged in one industry and could not be easily transferred to\r\n      another. The first and third causes are frequently met with in\r\n      mining, and give rise to the mode of carrying on the operation known\r\n      as _Zubusgruben_, that is, a species of working mines upon shares.\r\n      In England, after the spring of 1862, cotton yarn was not so much\r\n      dearer than raw cotton, that the loss caused by the decline could be\r\n      made up. (_Ausland_, 24 Sept., 1862.)\r\n\r\n  652 Besides, in the time immediately following, the price lowered by too\r\n      great a supply, may produce a species of desperation among\r\n      producers, which would lead them, in the hope of covering their\r\n      losses, to increase the supply still more, until many of them were\r\n      ruined. Generally, when a time of high prices is followed by a time\r\n      of low prices, we find an interval during which sellers endeavor to\r\n      defend themselves against the decline, and during which, as a\r\n      consequence, scarcely any business is transacted, while high prices\r\n      are nominally continued. And so _vice versa_. _Tooke_, History of\r\n      Prices, II, 62.\r\n\r\n  653 Thus, for instance, when the change of fashion brought about the\r\n      disuse of long periwigs in every-day life, their price did not cease\r\n      to fall until they had entirely disappeared. But, if a person wishes\r\n      to have one made to-day for a masquerade, for the stage, etc., he\r\n      would pay as much for it as its former price. On the other hand, the\r\n      price of whalebone has never been again as high as it was in the\r\n      time when hooped petticoats were worn.\r\n\r\n  654 The great plague in the time of Edward III. caused during the first\r\n      year, on account of the decreased consumption, an extraordinary\r\n      cheapness of provisions. In the following year, however, they became\r\n      alarmingly dear, because there were few producers, especially among\r\n      the humble classes. A quarter of wheat cost in 1348, 4s. 2d.; in\r\n      1349, 5s. 5d.; in 1350, 8s. 3d.; in 1351, 10s. 2d.; while in 1346\r\n      and 1347, its average price was 6s. 8-7/8d. _Rogers_, History of\r\n      Agriculture and Prices, I, 232.\r\n\r\n  655 As for instance when new taxes or excises are imposed. Generally\r\n      when the cost of production has largely increased, purchasers do not\r\n      wait until a decrease of competition among sellers compels them to\r\n      exact higher prices, but meet them half way, especially when many\r\n      greatly desire the commodity, and the increase of the cost is only\r\n      small. (_Rau_, Handbuch, I, § 163.)\r\n\r\n  656 Under this rule fall, according to § 33, most products of industry\r\n      properly so called. “If we lose a market for a year, we generally\r\n      lose it for all time,” said an experienced manufacturer before the\r\n      parliamentary hand-loom weavers’ committee, 1840-42. Of course the\r\n      cost of transportation as far as the market must be estimated as\r\n      part of the cost of production. In consequence of this, as well as\r\n      of the difference of taxation duties etc., the superiority of one\r\n      producer to another may be more than overcome. In the case of\r\n      colonial commodities, which go into the interior of a country from\r\n      different sea-ports, the territory supplied from each port is\r\n      determined for the most part by these data. Thus, in Switzerland,\r\n      for instance, we find the districts supplied by Havre, Genoa and\r\n      Rotterdam; in Austria, the districts supplied by Hamburg and Triest\r\n      contiguous, but the boundary line subject to many changes. (_Rau_,\r\n      Lehrbuch, I, § 164.) It must be understood that we do not here speak\r\n      of abnormal expenses made by producers individually, whether in\r\n      consequence of want of skill or because of accident.\r\n\r\n  657 This is true especially of agricultural production, in which, as a\r\n      rule, beside the most fertile and most advantageously situated land,\r\n      the worse must be used. What _Whately_ calls “surplus-profit”\r\n      appears here in the form of rent, whereas, in other cases, it takes\r\n      the shape of unusually high wages, or profit on capital. This is\r\n      very beautifully and systematically developed by _Schäffle_, N. Œk.,\r\n      II; Aufl., 192 ff. According to _Senior_, Outlines, 15, the\r\n      price-relation of two commodities to each other depends not on the\r\n      quantities of them which come to market, but on the relative power\r\n      of the difficulties which stand in the way of an increase in these\r\n      quantities. If the same producers can pursue the cheaper mode of\r\n      production which does not suffice to supply the market, as well as\r\n      the dearer, we have, generally, a price which is the mean between\r\n      the two costs of production. The same is true in the case of\r\n      “smuggled” goods which ought to have paid duty. (_Hermann_, loc.\r\n      cit., 83, seq.)\r\n\r\n  658 To this section belong the secrets of production which may be taken\r\n      advantage of either _ad libitum_ or within certain limits. In\r\n      agriculture, advantages of production can seldom remain secret.\r\n      Compare, however, the case mentioned in _Garnier’s_ translation of\r\n      _Adam Smith_, V, 119, and that of the orchards which yielded £1,000\r\n      yearly for every 32 acres, and which were a result of the recent\r\n      introduction of the culture of the cherry in Kent, in the reign of\r\n      Henry VIII. (_Anderson_, Origin of Commerce, a, 1540.) There is\r\n      therefore, a certain odium attached by agricultural producers to\r\n      keeping secret a means of agricultural improvement.\r\n\r\n  659 Compare _Boisguillebert_, Traité des Grains, II, ch. 2. _John Stuart\r\n      Mill_ speaks of an equation: the price of a commodity in a given\r\n      market is always high enough to produce a demand corresponding to\r\n      the present supply, or to an expected supply. The price of such\r\n      commodities only which may not be increased to any desirable extent\r\n      depends on supply and demand. In the case of all others, on the\r\n      other hand, demand and supply depend on the price, and this on the\r\n      cost of production. Supply and demand always tend to an equilibrium\r\n      which is never really attained where the price is high enough to\r\n      cover the cost of production (?). (Principles, III, ch. 2, § 4; ch.\r\n      3, § 2.) _Schäffle’s_ theory of prices is topped by the proposition\r\n      that all competing sellers and all competing buyers, after an\r\n      economic fashion, do not wish to sell below individual cost-value,\r\n      nor to rise above individual value in use, in purchasing. Hence, in\r\n      a throng of competition of supply the costliest productions step out\r\n      of the field of competition in a descending cost-value series; and\r\n      in a throng of competition of demand, the most wearied cravings in\r\n      an ascending value-in-use series; until the quantities offered in\r\n      supply and asked for cover each other without loss, and have placed\r\n      each other in quantitative equilibrium. (N. Œk. Aufl., I, 188 ff.;\r\n      compare 173, 185.) It is, however, to say the least, an instance of\r\n      baseless solicitude, when _Wade_, History of the middle and working\r\n      Classes, 214, says that one unemployed workman might depress the\r\n      aggregate wages of labor, almost _ad infinitum_.\r\n\r\n_  660 Hufeland_, N. Grundlegung, I, 78; _Ricardo_, Principles, ch. 31.\r\n\r\n_  661 Dunoyer_, Liberté du Travail, VIII, ch. 4; _Rau_, Lehrbuch, I, §\r\n      158.\r\n\r\n  662 For a good classification of monopolies, see _Senior_, Outlines, 103\r\n      ff. _Menger_, Grundsätze, I, 195, shows that no monopolist can\r\n      arbitrarily determine the extent of the market for his\r\n      monopoly-product when the price is fixed, nor when the extent of the\r\n      market is known, the height of the price. Moreover, the price may\r\n      remain longer above than under the cost of production, for the\r\n      reason that it is easier to abandon a business than to begin one,\r\n      and that the fear of loss is more frequently an incentive to action\r\n      than the hope of gain. Hence the price of corn, when everything else\r\n      is very dear, is more apt to vary from the average price, than in\r\n      times when everything is very cheap. For instance, the Munich prices\r\n      from 1750 to 1800 show that its highest price was 147 per cent.\r\n      above, and its lowest 47 per cent. below the average of twenty\r\n      years. (_Rau_, Lehrbuch, § 162, 182.)\r\n\r\n  663 Chance plays a great part here. Thus, Murillo’s Conception which\r\n      Marshal Soult had offered several times for 150,000 francs, but in\r\n      vain, was sold in May, 1852, for 586,000 francs. Paul Potter’s young\r\n      bull at the Hague, which cost 625 florins in 1748, was valued before\r\n      the middle of the nineteenth century at 200,000 florins.\r\n      (_Dethmar._)\r\n\r\n  664 The purchaser resolves to do so because it would, in all\r\n      probability, cost him more to go to India or Brazil in search of\r\n      precious stones. Besides after the working of the Brazilian mines in\r\n      1728, and again after the French Revolution, the price of diamonds\r\n      fell greatly; in the one case, from an increase of the supply, in\r\n      the other from a decrease of the demand. (_Ritter_, VI, 355, 365.)\r\n\r\n  665 Thus, the Champagne and Johannisberg grapes, when transplanted to\r\n      the Crimea, lost most of their native taste. On China’s practical\r\n      monopoly of tea culture, and Ceylon’s, especially in its\r\n      southwestern part, of cinnamon, at least so far as the peculiar\r\n      aroma is concerned, compare _Ritter_, Erdkunde, VI, 123 ff. The\r\n      small deer of Angora no sooner leave the little district of Asia\r\n      Minor to which they belong, than they are in danger of degenerating.\r\n      (Revue des deux Mondes, May 15, 1850.) Indian birds-nests cost no\r\n      more than 11 per cent. to gather, dry etc., of the market price.\r\n      (_Crawfurd_, East India Archipelago, III, 432 ff.; _Hogendorp_, Sur\r\n      l’Ile de Java, 201.)\r\n\r\n  666 Poor material for fuel, poor day-laborer work—dwellings, medical\r\n      attendance. (_Menger_, Grundsätze, I, 116.)\r\n\r\n  667 Thus sea fish, oysters etc. were formerly much cheaper during the\r\n      summer than during the winter, at Ostend and Scheveningen, because\r\n      during winter they could be sent to a distance. At Billingsgate\r\n      market, in the mackerel season, fish cost per hundred 48 to 50\r\n      shillings at 5 o’clock in the morning, 36 shillings at 10 o’clock,\r\n      and 24 shillings in the afternoon. (_H. Schulze_, Nat-Œkonomische\r\n      Bilder aus England, 1853, 241.) In the Rhine country, the price of\r\n      fruit does not vary so much as in Saxony, because it is customary\r\n      there to employ the surplus in the manufacture of cider, of\r\n      preserves etc., thus making it transportable and durable.\r\n      Frequently, after a very abundant crop of grapes or olives,\r\n      under-prices prevail, sometimes on account of a want of vessels,\r\n      cellar-room etc.; they must, therefore, be sold rapidly.\r\n\r\n  668 Compare _Adam Smith_, Wealth of Nations, I, ch. 7.; _Tooke_, History\r\n      of Prices, I, 97. Furs vary very much in price, sometimes 300 per\r\n      cent. in a year, because, in the case of this entirely natural\r\n      product, every thing depends on the stores of them, on the\r\n      temperature etc. (_McCulloch_, Commerc. Dict., s.v.) On the other\r\n      hand, the price of coffee usually varies only after periods of a\r\n      number of years, because new plantations produce only after a lapse\r\n      of years. (_Ibid._) Pigs vary much more than cattle in price,\r\n      because the former may be made ready for the slaughter house in\r\n      one-third of the time required for the latter. (_Thaer_, Rationelle\r\n      Landwirthschaft, IV, 374.)\r\n\r\n  669 Thus the rent of farms, where a numerous proletarian population will\r\n      live exclusively from agriculture, depends on scarcely anything but\r\n      the number of people and the extent of the land. (_J. S. Mill_,\r\n      Principles, III, ch. 2.) In retail trade, where personal want comes\r\n      in question, prices are much more subject to be modified by small\r\n      circumstances, than in wholesale trade, where both parties are only\r\n      intent on “doing business.” (_J. S. Mill_, III, ch. 1, § 5. _Tooke_,\r\n      II, 72 f.)\r\n\r\n  670 Hucksters, butchers, dealers in corn, inn-keepers etc. A remarkable\r\n      case where Parisian dealers in hare-skins attempted to ruin the new\r\n      fashion in silk hats by distributing a great number of them among\r\n      the rabble, at mock-prices. (_Hermann_, 1st ed., 91.) The author\r\n      witnessed a similar but unsuccessful attempt in Berlin in 1838-39,\r\n      by the tailors against the so-called Macintosh coat. On the\r\n      conspiracy of the English dealers in second-hand goods against\r\n      auctions, see Athæneum, Dec. 5, 1863. It is one of _McCulloch’s_\r\n      characteristic exaggerations, that he says that conspiracies to\r\n      raise the price of a commodity by artificial means, are broken just\r\n      as soon as they begin to obtain their object by the interest of the\r\n      individual members to profit by the advanced prices. (Edition of\r\n      _Adam Smith_, Edinb., 1863, p. 59.)\r\n\r\n_  671 J. S. Mill_, Principles, II, ch. 4.\r\n\r\n  672 Monopolies universally prohibited: L. un. C. De Monopol. (IV, 59.)\r\n      Police-order of the Empire, 1548, tit. 18.\r\n\r\n  673 Privileges which the purchaser voluntarily accords to the seller are\r\n      wont to be useful to both parties. (_Hermann_, loc. cit. 155, 158.)\r\n\r\n  674 Besides, guilds, castes, corporations etc. may, when the vent\r\n      diminishes, produce under-prices as readily as they may\r\n      monopoly-prices when the vent is very good. (See _Adam Smith_,\r\n      Wealth of Nations, I, ch. 7.)\r\n\r\n  675 Thus, for instance, the traveler who wanted to cross a stream, would\r\n      find himself delivered over to the tender mercies of the ferry-man,\r\n      without protection of any kind against his demands. But repeated\r\n      impositions in the matter of prices would have for effect to bring a\r\n      point into disrepute as a place of crossing, and would induce the\r\n      public to seek another. Similarly in the case of hackney-coachmen\r\n      and carriers in large cities, and in that of innkeepers, at hotels\r\n      and postal termini etc.\r\n\r\n  676 Fixed prices by governmental authority were soonest attempted after\r\n      bad harvests, but, indeed, with a strange ignorance of the natural\r\n      grounds of the increase in price of bread-stuffs. Thus in the time\r\n      of Charlemagne. (Capitul. a, 805; _Baluz_, I, 423.) Similarly in the\r\n      case of other articles of universal necessity, when oppressively but\r\n      necessarily dear. (See § 175.) During the last centuries of the\r\n      middle ages, with their multitude of actual monopolies, and at the\r\n      beginning of the modern era, fixed prices became more and more\r\n      general. The earliest instance in the history of England of a fixed\r\n      price for bread was in 1202 (_v. Raumer_, Hohenstaufen, V, 372), and\r\n      in 1266, 51 Henry III. The earliest in Prussia was in 1393.\r\n      (_Voigt_, Geschichte von Preussen, II, 659.) Many instances of fixed\r\n      prices in the Rhine provinces of Austria in 1530. In _Mylius_, Corp.\r\n      Const. March, V, 2, 587 ff., we find an ordinance of 1653 fixing\r\n      prices in Berlin, and including 72 industries. There is a very\r\n      complicated system of fixed prices in the police ordinance of the\r\n      electorate of Saxony of 1612, and in the decree concerning the coin\r\n      of 1822. As to how, in Saxony in 1578, an attempt was made to\r\n      ascertain the cost of the production of shoes by shoemakers, see\r\n      _Joh. Falke_, Gesch. des Kurf. August in volkswirthschaft.\r\n      Beziehung, 1868, 252. There was an enormous extension of\r\n      governmental fixing of prices under Philip II.; one of the principal\r\n      causes why Castile was so far behind Aragon economically.\r\n      (_Townsend_, Journey through Spain, II, 221.) Sometimes these\r\n      measures were adopted to prevent distress-prices; as in Hochheim, in\r\n      favor of the vintners. (_Becher_, Polit. Discurs, II, 1652.) The\r\n      predilection especially of German authorities for the fixing of\r\n      prices by governmental power, in the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\n      centuries is very remarkable. Thus _Luther_, vom Kaufhandel und\r\n      Wucher, 1524; _Calvin_, Leben Calvins, by _Henry_, II, Beilage, 3,\r\n      23; _Bornitz_, De Rerum Sufficientia, 1625, 246; _Seckendorff_,\r\n      Teutscher Fürstenstaat, 5th ed., 1776, 210; _Becher_, II, 1823 ff.;\r\n      _Horneck_, Oesterrich über Alles, wenn es will, 1684, 123; _Leibniz\r\n      ed.

On the other hand, _Child_, 1690, and\r\n      _North_, 1691, reprove all such measures. _Roscher_, Zur Geschichte\r\n      der englischen Volkswirthschaftslehre, 65, 90 f. Earlier yet,\r\n      _Salmasius_, who would allow the free _fori ratio_ to govern. (De\r\n      Usuris, 1638, 583.) For a very rigorous price-tariff in the old\r\n      Indian laws, by which, _inter alia_, the price of provisions was to\r\n      be fixed anew every fourteen days, see _Menu_, Laws, VIII, ch. 401\r\n      ff.\r\n\r\n  677 Where trade is free, the _filet de boeuf_, for instance, is worth\r\n      four times as much as the flesh of the ox’s neck or throat; but\r\n      prices fixed by a government can scarcely take cognizance of the\r\n      difference. How easily might not a fixed price for beer, for\r\n      instance, be evaded by diluting that beverage with water, or fixed\r\n      prices for inn-keepers by dealing out portions smaller in quantity\r\n      or of an inferior quality. Moreover, as early a writer as _De la\r\n      Court_, Polit. Discoursen, 1662, c. 4, remarks that the\r\n      establishment of fixed prices by governmental authority raises the\r\n      average price of all commodities rather than lowers it, for the\r\n      reason that the few who are sellers by trade can do more to\r\n      influence the authorities than the many buyers, whose interests are\r\n      divided among numberless different commodities.\r\n\r\n_  678 Schäffle_, Nat.-Œkonomie, II, 384 f.\r\n\r\n_  679 Banfield_, Organization of Industry, 120. “Where the economic life\r\n      of a people is still undeveloped, and the production of one\r\n      enterprise is not from the first based on the estimated consumption\r\n      of another, the circulation of goods brings with it great profits\r\n      and great losses; whereas, profits and losses grow smaller, but at\r\n      the same time more uniform and regular, in proportion as the\r\n      circulation of goods increases in rapidity and regularity.”\r\n      (_Stein_, Lehrbuch, 212.)\r\n\r\n  680 In Belgium, during the last forty years, the price of wheat has\r\n      become more constant every year, while the price of rye has become\r\n      more variable; for the reason that rye has gradually ceased to be an\r\n      article of popular consumption, and therefore to be an important\r\n      article in trade, and is consumed almost entirely and directly by\r\n      its producers. (_Horn_, Statist. Gemälde von B., 1853, 185.)\r\n      _Rodbertus_ rightly conjectures that the price of wheat was much\r\n      more variable in ancient times than it is with us. (_Hildebrand’s_\r\n      Jahrb., 1870, I, 36.) That it was so may be inferred from the\r\n      surprisingly large family supplies which were laid in, as appears\r\n      from Digest, XXXIII, De Penu legato.\r\n\r\n  681 In Würtemberg even officials etc. buy their own wine almost always\r\n      directly from the vintner. This causes prices there to be\r\n      exceedingly variable, frequently from hour to hour. (_v. Reden_,\r\n      Statist. Zeitschrift, Nov. 1847, 1008.) How greatly the mere\r\n      presence of a regular market has contributed to make prices more\r\n      constant, may be seen in the suburbs of Hamburg, where fish offered\r\n      for sale on the street are sold in the evening for one-third of the\r\n      price asked for them in the morning. Besides, purchases made with a\r\n      view to speculation may increase the variations of price, if the\r\n      speculation is unskillfully conducted, especially when a low rate of\r\n      interest, and of the profit of the person engaged in it, has\r\n      produced a blind race among the speculators. Here the price of a\r\n      commodity rises, not from any natural cause, but because it once\r\n      rose before, and _vice versa_. (_Senior_, Outlines, 17 ff.;\r\n      _Hermann_, 90 ff.)\r\n\r\n  682 That fixed prices suppose that men are engaged in the production of\r\n      the commodity in question, as their calling in life, see _Garve_, Zu\r\n      Cicero’s Pflichten, III, 64 ff. Chess-like commerce of colporteurs,\r\n      and in caravans etc. Concerning the dreadful higgling of the\r\n      Bedouins, see _Wellsted_, Reise in Arabien, _Rödiger’s_ translation,\r\n      I, 147; and the still worse bantering in Cashmere, where the\r\n      merchant, in the first place, always denies that he possesses the\r\n      desired commodity, then begins to search for it, in order to\r\n      discover what value the purchaser puts upon it etc. (_K. Ritter_,\r\n      Erdkunde, III, 475.) On the practices in Indian fairs, see _Th.\r\n      Skinner_, Excursion in India, 1832, I, ch. 6; on the bazaars in\r\n      Asia, _Andree_, Globus XII, 7, 211. _Herberstein_ says of the\r\n      Russians in the sixteenth century: _mercantur fallacissime et\r\n      dolosissime nec paucis verbis ... mercatores nonnunquam non uno\r\n      tantum aut altera mense suspensos detinent, verum ad extremam\r\n      desperationem perducere solent_. Hence the great variations in\r\n      prices and commodities. (Rerum Moscov. Commentt., ed. Starczewski,\r\n      39 f.) Similarly also, in 1674, according to _Kilburger_: Büsching’s\r\n      Magazin, III, 249. But, on the contrary, it is said of the\r\n      Plescovers, educated by intercourse with the Hanse; _tanta\r\n      integritas ... in contractibus, ut uno tantum verbo res ipsas\r\n      indicarent omni verbositate in fraudem emptoris omissa_.\r\n      (_Herberstein_, 52.) In the England of the present day, the custom\r\n      of marking each piece of goods with its price is very general.\r\n      Concerning the rapidity and the paucity of words with which prices\r\n      are settled in that country, where business men do not even salute\r\n      their customers, nor customers the business man, see _C. G. Simon_,\r\n      Observations recueillies en Angleterre, 1835, I, 129 f. The Athenian\r\n      laws (?), that fixed prices should be asked, and that sellers should\r\n      not sit down that that they might sell more rapidly, points to\r\n      something similar. (_Athen._, VI, 226 f. _Plato_, De Legg., XI, 916\r\n      f.) Athenian law prohibiting mendacity in the markets. (See\r\n      _Demosth._, Lept., 459.)\r\n\r\n  683 Thus the German book-trade has fixed prices. Many merchants never\r\n      make an offer to their educated customers who are wont to do so with\r\n      peasants etc.; because they are aware that the latter purchase only\r\n      after they have compelled the seller to come down greatly from his\r\n      first proposed price. Among the Quakers it has been a rule from the\r\n      beginning, never to ask more for their wares than they were\r\n      determined to accept. (_Hume_, History of England, ch. 62.)\r\n\r\n_  684 Sir William Temple_, Observations upon the Netherlands, Works I,\r\n      134, compares honor in trade to discipline in an army.

Where the seller is not obliged to make known the existence\r\n      of certain defects in his wares to the purchaser before sale, there\r\n      is always scope for fraud. Compare Digest De Edict. aedilit., XXI,\r\n      I. On the meaning of the German legal maxims: _Hand muss Hand\r\n      wahren_, and _Ein Wort, ein Mann_, see _Eisenhart_, Deutsches Recht\r\n      in Sprüchwörtern, 311 f., 319 f. It is a principle in matters of\r\n      business, that the person who through malice or carelessness\r\n      recommends a man of whose probity there is already some doubt,\r\n      should bear the damage caused by his recommendation. (_Martens_,\r\n      Grundriss des Handelsrechtes, 24 ff.) Many attempts at dishonesty\r\n      are prevented by laws which in important contracts, especially in\r\n      sales of land etc., require the presence of witnesses, and this\r\n      particularly in the lower stages of civilization. (_Meier_ and\r\n      _Schömann_, Attischer Process, 522; Roman, Emancipatio; _Grimm_,\r\n      Deutsche Rechtsalterthümer, 608 f.), or even a public proclamation\r\n      before the assembled community, at least written documents invested\r\n      with all legal formalities as practiced among civilized peoples. On\r\n      Greek laws of this nature, see especially, _Theophrast._, in\r\n      _Stobaeus_, Sermon., XLIV, 22. Very remarkable in Sparta. _Schol.\r\n      Aristophan._, Aves, 1284.\r\n\r\n  685 Compare _Lotz_, Revision, I, 255 ff.

Compare _Engel_, Jahrbuch für Sachsen, I, 491 ff. The\r\n      custom of asking enormous prices with the expectation of being\r\n      beaten down, is usual in Italy and carried to a frightful extent,\r\n      and related to the bad custom prevalent there of begging a little\r\n      after-payment to every little gratuity or drink-money which has been\r\n      received.\r\n\r\n_  686 Storch_, Handbuch, I, 311. _J.

How fortunate for the public economy of nations that the prices\r\n      of corn especially have been growing more steady all the time since\r\n      the middle ages. See _Roscher_, Ueber Kornhandel, 56, 61.\r\n\r\n  687 Trade by barter was very general in several states of the American\r\n      Union about the close of the eighteenth century. In Vermont, for\r\n      instance, it was usual for a doctor to exchange his medicines\r\n      against a horse, and for the printer to buy corn, butter etc. with a\r\n      newspaper.

In\r\n      Maryland, the Assembly fixed by law the relative proportions at\r\n      which tobacco, pork, corn and wheat should be exchanged the one\r\n      against the other. (_Ebeling_, V, 435 ff. _Douglas_, Summary of the\r\n      British Settlements in N. America, 1670, V, 2, 359.) Even as late as\r\n      1815, children were wont to run the streets of Corrientes, crying:\r\n      “Salt for candles, tobacco for bread etc.” It was commerce with\r\n      England that first led to trade by money in the United States.\r\n      (_Robertson_, Letters on South America, 1843, I, 52.) Similarly in\r\n      Rhokand until the end of the eighteenth century, where the cities,\r\n      as a consequence, presented the appearance of a fair the whole year\r\n      round. In the beginning of this century, the khan introduced the use\r\n      of copper money made from Persian cannons; and much later yet, there\r\n      were scarcely a million rubles in money to a million men. (_Ritter_,\r\n      Erdkunde, VII, 753.) _Basil Hall_ found the uncivilized inhabitants\r\n      of the Loo-Choo Islands ignorant of the use of money. (Voyage of\r\n      Discovery, 1818.) Concerning trade by barter in the Homeric age, see\r\n      the Iliad, VII, 472 ff. A supposed law of Lycurgus prohibited the\r\n      use of money in purchases, and allowed barter only. (_Justin._, III,\r\n      2.) According to _Pausan._, III, 12, only barter existed in India\r\n      (?) in his time.\r\n\r\n  688 The person who has been used to paying for four pounds of meat with\r\n      twenty pounds of bread, and is asked to give twenty pounds of bread\r\n      in exchange for some other article, must of course have some unit of\r\n      measure in his mind to serve as a means of comparison between the\r\n      value of that article and that of four pounds of meat. In Denmark,\r\n      during the rule of the aristocracy, there were fixed prices\r\n      sanctioned by the tradition of long usage, in accordance with which\r\n      the prices of all commodities were estimated in relation to a ton of\r\n      barley or rye—a natural consequence, apparently, of the want of a\r\n      common measure to govern in the greater number of transactions.\r\n      _Bergsoe_, Archiv der Polit. Œk., IV, 314; _Graugan’s_ Icelandic\r\n      Code contains a remarkable fixed price of this nature in the\r\n      supplement to the _Kaupa-Balkr_ or Commercial Code, I, p. 500.\r\n      Similarly among the ancient Persians. _Reynier_, Economie publique\r\n      des Perses, 308.\r\n\r\n  689 That is, (200x(200-1))/2. Compare _Rau_ in _Storch_, Handbuch, III,\r\n      253. The “at least” has reference to the fact, that in barter, the\r\n      many different kinds of most commodities has to be borne in mind.\r\n      (_Knies_, Geld und Credit, I, 218.)\r\n\r\n  690 This transportation of values supposes an equality of values of the\r\n      money in two places, while the transportation of goods supposes\r\n      different values of the same kind of goods in both places. (_Knies_,\r\n      Geld und Credit, I, 218.)\r\n\r\n  691 While the words _pecunia_, _danaro_, _dinero_, and _argent_, are all\r\n      derived from unessential qualities, the German word for money,\r\n      _Geld_, corresponds with the essential quality of money, since it\r\n      denotes that which is of value everywhere (_gilt_). On the other\r\n      hand, _nummus_ and νόμισμα from νόμος, (_Bœckh._ Metrolog. Unters.,\r\n      310.), _moneta_ (the English, money), are from the temple of Juno\r\n      Moneta, in which the Roman coins were for a long time stamped. In\r\n      old German, the word for money, _Geld_, means everything that is\r\n      paid by any one. (_Grimm_, D. Rechtsalterth., 382.) The present\r\n      meaning of the word is to be met with in a very old document of\r\n      1327. (_Arnold_, z. Geschichte des Eigenthums in den deutschen\r\n      Städten, 89.)\r\n\r\n  692 The wrong definitions of money may be divided into two classes:\r\n      those which convey the idea that it is more than a commodity, and\r\n      those which imply that it is less.\r\n\r\n      This was a point which was contested even among the Greeks. There\r\n      were many who claimed that wealth consisted exclusively in the\r\n      possession of much money; as we find, for instance, in the\r\n      pseudo-Platonic dialogue Eryxias; while others insisted that money\r\n      was something purely imaginary (λῆρος), and the creation,\r\n      exclusively, of human laws. (_Aristot._, Polit., I, 3, 16, Schn.)\r\n      Νόμισμα σύμβολον τῆς ἀλλαγῆς ἔνεκα. (_Plato_, De Rep., II, 371.)\r\n      _Anacharsis_ compares money to counters. (_Plutarch_, De Profectt in\r\n      Virtute.) _Aristotle_, himself, subscribed to the second opinion,\r\n      although he saw clearly, that only useful and current things (χρείαν\r\n      εὐμεταχείριστον πρὸς τὸ ζῆν) could be used as money. (Polit., I, 3,\r\n      14 ff. Eth. Nicom., V, 5, 6, Rhet., II, 16.) _Xenophon_ ascribed\r\n      properties to money which no other commodity possessed; especially\r\n      when he said that it could never be too plentiful, and that its\r\n      price could never fall. (De Vectt. Ath., 4.) The finest ancient\r\n      explanation of the nature of money is that of the jurisconsult\r\n      _Paullus_, L. I.; Digest, XVIII, 1; and it well deserves the long\r\n      commentary devoted to it by _P. Neri_, Osservazioni etc., in\r\n      _Custodi_, P.A., VI, 324, ff.\r\n\r\n      Among the moderns, _Melancthon._, Corp. Ref., XVI, 498, and _Seb.\r\n      Frank_, Chronik., 760, consider money as a mere symbol. On the other\r\n      hand, the over-estimation in which the precious metals were held by\r\n      the adherents of the Mercantile System was owing, without doubt, to\r\n      their very superior utility as money; for we very frequently find\r\n      that the adherents of that school insist that the precious metals\r\n      must circulate. (See § 9 and § 210.) _v. Schröder_, Fürstl. Schatz-\r\n      und Rentkammer, III f., considers new copper coins as an increase of\r\n      the national wealth, but not other copper which is merely a\r\n      commercial commodity. He frequently calls money, the _pendulum\r\n      commercii_, and expresses ideas concerning it as enthusiastic as\r\n      they are obscure (p. 86.) _Horneck_, in his Oesterreich über Alles\r\n      wenn es will, 1864, calls gold and silver “our best blood, the very\r\n      marrow of our strength,” and “the two most indispensable universal\r\n      instruments of human activity and existence.” (p. 188.) _Th. Mun_,\r\n      England’s Treasure by forraign Trade, 1664, (ch. 2) considers\r\n      cash-money and resources as synonymous in every way. Only, he says\r\n      (ch. 4) that it is sometimes advisable to allow one’s money to\r\n      remain in foreign countries, and to use bills of exchange, banks\r\n      etc., at home, as a substitute. _F. Gee_, Trade and Commerce of Gr.\r\n      Britain, edition of 1738, laments the “stiff-necked folly of those\r\n      who think money a commodity like any other.” It is one of the most\r\n      common demands of the adherents of the Mercantile System that the\r\n      home mines of gold and silver should be worked at no matter what\r\n      sacrifice, since the money employed in working them continues to\r\n      remain in the country and the newly coined precious metal is clear\r\n      gain. Compare _Schröder_, loc. cit. 109 ff., 181. _Horneck_, loc.\r\n      cit. 173. _Broggia_, Della Monete, 1743, cap. 33; _v. Fusti_,\r\n      Staatswirthschaft, 1755, I, 246: _Forbonnais_, Finances de France,\r\n      1758, I, 148. _Ulloa_, Noticias Americanas, 1772, ch. 12. We seldom\r\n      meet with the correct view on this subject in the seventeenth\r\n      century. _Sully_, of whom Henry IV. said that he never found\r\n      anything to be possessed of beauty which cost double its real value,\r\n      had it at times. (Economies royales, LXXIII.) So had _v.\r\n      Seckendorff_, Teutscher Fürstenstaat, 1655, 5th edition.\r\n\r\n      It is in accordance with the usual course of human development that\r\n      the exaggerations of the Mercantile System led to a reaction\r\n      characterized by an exaggeration in the opposite direction. Even\r\n      _Davanzati_, Sulle Monete, 1588, traces the value of money back to\r\n      human convention and refuses to find it in nature. A natural calf,\r\n      he thinks, is _più nobile_ than a golden one; although he elsewhere\r\n      expresses his admiration of the precious metals, calls them _cagioni\r\n      seconde della vita beata_, and lauds them because they procure us\r\n      _tutt’essi beni_ (20, 21, Cust.) _Montanari_ (ob., 1687)\r\n      demonstrates from the use of leather money etc., that the authority\r\n      of the state is the only power which gives money its character as\r\n      money. (Della Moneta, 35.) _Davenant_ (ob., 1714) carries his\r\n      inclination to call money “the servant of trade, measure of trade,”\r\n      so far as to compare it to a ticket or counter. (Works, I, 355,\r\n      444.) Strongly as _Law_, himself, opposes the convention theory\r\n      (Trade and Money, ch. I; Sur l’ Usage des Monnaies, 1720, p. 1.),\r\n      his disciple _Dutot_, in his Réflexions polit. sur le Commerce et\r\n      les Finances, 1738, 905, éd. Daire, contrasts not only paper money\r\n      but also gold and silver as representative wealth, with real wealth.\r\n      _Berkeley_, Querist, 1735, teaches that the real notion of money is\r\n      not that of a “commodity, standard, measure, pledge, but [No. 23]\r\n      ticket or counter, entitling to power and fitted to record and\r\n      transfer such power.” (441, 475.) Even if the names, _livre_,\r\n      shilling etc., remain, and the metal is dropped, every article may\r\n      still as well as before be counted and sold, industry promoted and\r\n      the course of commerce preserved. (p. 440.) According to\r\n      _Montesquieu_, Esprit des Lois, XXI, 22, gold and silver are a\r\n      _richesse de fiction ou de signe_. Compare Lettres persanes, II, 18.\r\n      _Benjamin Franklin_ also maintains that the value of gold, for\r\n      instance, is principally a credit-value. Remarks relative to the\r\n      American Paper-Money, 1765, Works, II, Sparks’ edition.\r\n      _Forbonnais_, Finances de France, I, 86 f., calls money, simply a\r\n      means to put commodities, which alone have value originally, in\r\n      circulation. Hence it is, in itself, a matter of indifference\r\n      whether, for a given quantity of coin, a person gives one thaler, or\r\n      ten. In the Elements de Commerce, I, 11, II, 67 ff., he draws a\r\n      distinction between _richesses naturelles_ (raw material),\r\n      _artificielles_ (manufactured products), and _richesses_ de\r\n      convention (money.) _von Schlözer_, Aufangsgründe, 1805, 100, 138,\r\n      calls money something imagined; and _Th. Smith_, Essay on the Theory\r\n      of Money and Exchange, 1807, asserts, that true money is only an\r\n      ideal measure of value, of which coins in turn are only the\r\n      representatives. Compare, however, Edinb. Review, Oct., 1808.\r\n      _Oppenheim_, Die Natur des Geldes, 1855, grants that in the\r\n      beginnings of trade, money possessed the character of a commodity;\r\n      but says that as soon as the services of circulation of the\r\n      money-commodity prevailed over its services in consumption, it lost\r\n      all its importance for the latter purpose, and that all relations\r\n      dependent thereon ceased. At present, he claims money is only the\r\n      representative of commodities, but no commodity itself. See, on the\r\n      other hand, _Roscher’s_ critical analysis in the Literarisches\r\n      Centralblatt, 1855, December.\r\n\r\n      The true doctrine was advocated in a classic form by _Nicolaus\r\n      Oresmius_ (ob. 1382). See his Tractatus de Origine et Jure nec non\r\n      et Mutationibus Monetarum, newly edited by _Wolowski_: Paris, 1864.\r\n      See _Roscher’s_ essay in the Comptes rendus of the Académie des\r\n      Sciences morales et politiques, vol. 62, 435 ff. Based on the latter\r\n      we have _Gabr. Biel_ (ob. 1495), De Monetarum Potestate simul et\r\n      Utilitate, 1542, and _G. Agricola_, De Re metallica, 1556, I, 4 ff.\r\n      This true doctrine was acclimated earliest in England and Holland,\r\n      and before the mercantile system invaded them. Compare _Hobbes_,\r\n      Leviathan, 24, in which the _concoctio bonorum_ is described by\r\n      means of money, and the full and clear chapter 12 of _Salmasius_, De\r\n      Usuris (1638), who, among other things, shows how Midas, who turned\r\n      everything into bread, died of thirst. _Petty_ shows very clearly\r\n      that national wealth does not consist exclusively nor mainly in\r\n      money. Every country, he says, needs a certain quantity of money to\r\n      carry on trade. It would be a waste to increase the former, the\r\n      latter remaining the same. But the precious metals, by reason of\r\n      their durability and universally recognized value, possess the\r\n      character of wealth in a higher degree than other commodities.\r\n\r\n      On the whole, the use of money in a nation is like the use of fat in\r\n      the individual. (Quantulumcunque concerning Money, 1682.) Compare\r\n      _Roscher_, z. Geschichte der eng. Volkswirthschaftslehre, 80 f.\r\n      _Davanzati_ and _Hobbes_ had compared it to the blood, as has\r\n      recently _Schmitthenner_, Staatswissenschaften, 1839, I, 459.\r\n      _North_ calls money a commodity of which there may be an excess as\r\n      well as a want. (Discourse on Trade, preface and postscript.)\r\n      Compare _Locke_, Considerations on the Lowering of Interest, 1691,\r\n      Works II, 13 ff., 19. _Galiani_, 1750, Della Moneta, IV, holds a\r\n      very happy middle place between the alchymists and the philosophic\r\n      contemners of gold. See, further, _Quesnay, éd. Daire_, 64, 75 ff.\r\n      _Turgot_, Sur la Formation des Richesses, § 30 ff, had many clear\r\n      views on this subject. _Verri_, Meditazioni, 1771, II, 1, calls\r\n      money the universally current commodity. The expressions, measure of\r\n      value, pledge, representative of all commodities might be true also\r\n      of all other wares. It cannot, however, be denied that most modern\r\n      political economists have not borne sufficiently in mind the\r\n      peculiarities which distinguish money from all other commodities, as\r\n      is apparent from the doctrine of the balance of trade prevalent in\r\n      Hume’s and Adam Smith’s time. To this extent, therefore, the\r\n      semi-mercantilistic reaction instituted by _Ganilh_, Théorie de\r\n      l’Economie politique, 2822, II, 380 ff., 426; _St. Chamans_, N.\r\n      Essai sur la Richesse des Nations, 1824, ch. 3; and _Colton_, Public\r\n      Economy for the United States, 1849, 203 ff., who bring into relief\r\n      the difference between “money as the subject” and “money as the\r\n      instrument of trade,” was not wholly unfounded. _Ad. Müller_\r\n      exaggerates a correct thought, and causes it to degenerate into a\r\n      species of mystic pleasantry, when he calls every individual in the\r\n      state and every commodity that possesses value, in exchange or a\r\n      social character, money.\r\n\r\n      The highest object of the state is to develop this money-character\r\n      more and more. (Elemente der Staatskunst, II, 194, 199.) The\r\n      statesman, he says, should be money. (III, 206.) A very valuable\r\n      monograph on this subject is _M. Chevalier’s_ De la Monnaie, 1850,\r\n      constituting the third volume of his Cours d’Economie polititique.\r\n      _Knies_, Geld und Credit, I, 1873, is here most thorough and acute,\r\n      especially in keeping separate, by well defined lines of\r\n      demarcation, the five different functions of money: measure of value\r\n      (by proper division into parts: price-measure), instrument of\r\n      exchange, means of transportation of values, and means of storing up\r\n      and preserving values.\r\n\r\n_  693 Knies_ shows how the making of money legal tender by the state,\r\n      although of only secondary importance, is by no means an irrelevant\r\n      matter, since persons must then have it, even if they do not want it\r\n      for purposes of use or exchange, to discharge their liabilities\r\n      thereby etc., etc. (Tübinger, Zetschrift, 1858, 272.)\r\n\r\n      In all these cases, barter-economy (_Naturalwirthschaft_) meets with\r\n      greater and greater difficulties as civilization advances. How, for\r\n      instance, could 50 days annually of socage-service or labor be\r\n      redeemed by the achievement at one time of 1,000 days of\r\n      socage-service or labor? The rich man requires money principally as\r\n      a means of payment, the poor man as a medium of exchange. The\r\n      requirement or need of a people of media of payment is much more\r\n      susceptible of extension or contraction, than that of media of\r\n      exchange, made especially so by the intervention of claim-rights\r\n      instead of money. _(Knies_, loc. cit, 200 ff.) _Ravit_, Beitr. z.\r\n      Lehre vom Gelde, emphasizes this feature of money altogether too\r\n      much after the manner of a jurist. But he is entirely right in\r\n      adopting the exclusion of the _rei vindicatio_ against the honest\r\n      possessor as necessary to the completion of the idea of money.\r\n\r\n_  694 Sismondi_, N.P., I, 131, very rightly remarks that this has made\r\n      practice as much easier as it has theory more difficult.\r\n\r\n_  695 Law_, Trade and Money, 19. Hence, before the invention of money,\r\n      scarcely anything but the things most indispensable to existence\r\n      were produced. Were there no money, there would be very few\r\n      scholars, artists etc.; for the classes who produce most of the\r\n      things indispensable to existence make but few demands for them.\r\n      _Büsch_, Geldumlauf, I, 11 ff., 36, II, 54.\r\n\r\n_  696 Turgot_, Formation et Distribution, § 48 ff. Commodities which\r\n      perish rapidly could be produced by persons devoting themselves to\r\n      their production as a business only after the invention of small\r\n      coin. (_Lueder_, N. Œk., 1820, 283.)\r\n\r\n  697 Compare _Knies_, Geld und Credit, I, 219.\r\n\r\n  698 Compare _Schmitthenner_, loc. cit., I, 457. One of the principal\r\n      advantages of money consists in this, that every producer can\r\n      discover what there is an over-supply or under-supply of in the\r\n      nation, by means of the relation of the price in money of his\r\n      products to the cost of producing them, estimated in money, (_v.\r\n      Thünen_, Isolirte Staat, II, 2, 235.)\r\n\r\n  699 Hence it is that so many socialists attack money. _Th. More_ assures\r\n      us that with the simple abolition of money, vice and misery would,\r\n      for the most part, disappear of themselves. Hence in his Utopia,\r\n      criminals are bound in golden chains and the chamber-pots are made\r\n      of gold and silver in order to make these metals contemptible. (Ed.\r\n      1555, ff., 197 ff.) Similar views among the over-cultured Romans.\r\n      (Compare §§ 79, 204.) _Auri sacra fames_. _Virgil_, Æneid, III, 56.\r\n      _Pliny_, too, would recall the days of trade by barter. (H. N.,\r\n      XXXIII, 3.) Even in _Boisguillebert_, Factum de la France, ch. 4, we\r\n      find, together with many correct views on the nature of money,\r\n      passionate declamation against it because of its darker side.\r\n      _Argent criminel_. (Détail de la France, 7. Dissertation sur la\r\n      Nature des Richesses etc.) More recently this darker side has been\r\n      dwelt upon by _F. Möser_, Patriot. Phant., I, 28; _Ortes_, Economia\r\n      nazionale, II, 17, and the would-be restorer of the middle ages,\r\n      _Ad. Müller_. While the latter writer lauds the feudal system as a\r\n      “sublime fusion of person and thing” (Elemente I, 221), the present\r\n      system of wages, because it is a system of compensation, he blames,\r\n      and prefers the feudal for the opposite reason (?). “The only\r\n      _merit_ which the state recognizes in our day is one _of service_.”\r\n      (III, 259.) _Kosegarten_, Geschichtliche systematische, Uebersicht\r\n      der N. Oek., 1856, 146 ff., is no friend to the economic system to\r\n      which money gives a distinctive character. _Per contra_, compare\r\n      _Bastiat_, Maudit Argent, 1849.\r\n\r\n_  700 Mirabeau_, Philosophie rurale, 1763, ch. 2, adds as the third great\r\n      invention the _tableau économique_ of the Physiocrates. For a\r\n      comparison of money and language, see _Hamann_, Werke, II, 135 ff.,\r\n      509. _Hehn_, Kulturpflanzen und Hausthiere, finds it characteristic\r\n      of the race, that wine, writing with letters, and money, all owe\r\n      their origin to the monotheistic stem of the Semitic people.\r\n\r\n  701 Where every man becomes a merchant, and the society itself a\r\n      commercial society. _Ad. Smith_, Wealth of Nations, I, ch. 4.\r\n\r\n  702 Just as descriptive is the German word _billig_ (_equitable_) for\r\n      cheap. Here it is plain that language takes sides with the possessor\r\n      of money!\r\n\r\n  703 The contrast between barter-economy and money-economy is of great\r\n      and fundamental importance. It repeats itself with so much\r\n      regularity in the history of every highly developed nation, that\r\n      political economists gifted with perception for the historical,\r\n      could not possibly overlook it. Thus, _Aristotle_, for instance,\r\n      establishes with the utmost care and accuracy the difference between\r\n      οἰκονομικὴ and χρηματιστικὴ, that is, between natural economy and\r\n      artificial economy, corresponding to the difference between value in\r\n      use and value in exchange. (Polit., I, 3, Schn.) Similarly _D.\r\n      Hume_, who allows a period of luxury, culture, industry, of trade\r\n      and manufactures, of freedom and circulation of money, to be\r\n      preceded by one in which the feeling of wants is not awakened, in\r\n      which coarseness and idleness prevail, one in which agriculture is\r\n      alone pursued, and monetary economy and freedom decline, and trade\r\n      by barter obtains. (Discourses, passim, especially On Interest and\r\n      on Money.) A similar contrast we find frequently, and as one of his\r\n      fundamental thoughts, in _J. Steuart_.\r\n\r\n      As to how the transition from barter-economy to monetary-economy is\r\n      generally effected, see _F. G. Hoffmann_, Lehre vom Gelde, 1838, 176\r\n      ff. In the Tyrol, as late as 1820, the greater portion of purely\r\n      mechanical work, such as that of the smith, the carpenter, and the\r\n      washerwoman, were purely feudal duties. On the other hand, payment\r\n      in money was the rule, in the beginning of the fourteenth century.\r\n      (_F. Beidermann_, Technische Bildung in Oesterreich, 3.) Yet, for a\r\n      long time after, the functions of a measure of value were performed\r\n      by pieces of land, and those of an instrument of exchange by cattle\r\n      and natural products. (_Arnold, Gesch. des Eigenth_., 207.) In\r\n      France, money-economy, i.e., trade by money, had grown to importance\r\n      earlier. (_Nitsch_., Ministerialität und Bürgerthum, im 11. und 12.\r\n      Jahr., 143.) Even in the time of Mary Stuart, the Scotch estimated\r\n      the rent of land in “cauldrons of victuals.” (_Moryson_, Itinerary,\r\n      1617, III, 155.) In ancient Italy, during the first three centuries\r\n      of Rome, there was, with the exception of the Greek colonies, only\r\n      trade by barter. _Mommsen_, Römische Gesch., I, 293, shows that the\r\n      oldest ases were not money in the higher sense of the word, but\r\n      belonged rather to the stage of barter-economy. On the other hand,\r\n      we find in the time of the classic jurists, much as slavery had\r\n      limited the sphere of action of money, the principle: _pecuniæ\r\n      nomine non solum numerata pecunia, sed omnes res, tam soli quam\r\n      mobiles, et tam corpora quam jura continentur_. (L. 222, Digest L.\r\n      16; compare 4, 5, 178.) Similarly in _Cicero_, Top. 6. De Invent,\r\n      II, 21. De Legg, II, 19, 21; III, 3. Compare _Dionys. Hal._, N.R.\r\n      IV, 15.\r\n\r\n  704 Were money nothing but a measure of values in exchange, it should on\r\n      that account, if on no other, have value in exchange itself, as a\r\n      measure of length must necessarily have length itself. (We measure\r\n      time on a clock by means of the revolution of the hands on the\r\n      dial.) Again, value in exchange supposes value in use. The so-called\r\n      “money of account,” such as the East Indian _lac de roupies_, the\r\n      Portuguese reis, and the earlier English _pound_ sterling are no\r\n      imaginary magnitudes, which would disappear with the figures of our\r\n      system of counting (see _Hufeland_, N. Grundlegung, II, 33, in reply\r\n      to _Struensee_, Abh., III, 501); but real coin-values which can not\r\n      be represented by only single pieces of coin, units of value for the\r\n      most part no longer recognized by the state, but which the people\r\n      still retain. See _M. Park’s_ (Travels, 27) refutation of the fable\r\n      circulated by _Montesquieu_, Esprit des Lois, XXII, 8, that the\r\n      regular standard money of the Mandingo negroes was a mere imaginary\r\n      standard. _Hobbes_, Leviathan, 24, exhibits a very good knowledge of\r\n      this subject.\r\n\r\n  705 Compare _P. Neri_, Osservazioni, 1751, VI, 1. _Lord Liverpool_,\r\n      Treatise on the Coins of the Realm, 1805. The person who takes money\r\n      as such must always harbor the hope of being able to dispose of it\r\n      again as money. Hence, such an acceptance always supposes the\r\n      existence of a certain amount of commercial confidence. The savage\r\n      Goahiros, between Rio de la Hacha and Maracaibo, are too\r\n      “distrustful” to take anything in trade but commodities fit for the\r\n      most immediate use. (_Depons_, Voyage dans la Terrefirme, I, 314.)\r\n      Similarly in the twelfth century, the heathen Laplanders. (_Arndt_,\r\n      Liefl. Chronik, II, 3.) Commodities which barbarians can consume\r\n      immediately are objects of the first necessity, whereas more\r\n      civilized people, who are in a condition to undergo greater expense,\r\n      look more to the technic qualities of money, such as divisibility,\r\n      capacity for transportation and durability. _v. Scheel_ shows in a\r\n      very happy manner how, as commerce increases, money comes to be, as\r\n      it were, subjected to a process resembling that of distillation:\r\n      first mere increase of stores for use, next preponderating values in\r\n      exchange, lastly mere orders for the same possessing no independent\r\n      value. _Hildebrand’s_ Jahrbb., 1866, I, 16.\r\n\r\n  706 The last circumstance continues to be one of great importance for a\r\n      long period of time in the frigid zones. Thus, the beaver-skin\r\n      continues still to be the unit of measure of trade in much of the\r\n      territory of the Hudson Bay Company. Three martens are estimated to\r\n      be equal in value to one beaver, one white fox to two beavers, one\r\n      black fox or a bear to four beavers, a rifle to fifteen beavers.\r\n      (Ausland, 1846, No. 21.) The Esthonian word, _raha_, money, means in\r\n      the related language of the Laplanders, fur. (_Krug_, Zur Münzkunde\r\n      Russlands, 1805.) Concerning skin-money in the middle age of Russia,\r\n      see _Nestor_, _Schlözer’s_ translation, III, 90. The old word\r\n      _kung_, money, means marten. By degrees it came to pass that instead\r\n      of whole skins, only two “snouts” were given or other pieces of\r\n      leather about a square inch in size, which were probably stamped by\r\n      the government and redeemed in whole skins at the government\r\n      magazines. Hence, there is here supposed a species of assignats, and\r\n      of disturbances of credit. The Mongolian conquerors would not\r\n      recognize them, and they therefore became suddenly valueless. In\r\n      Novgorod and Pskow, the system continued some time longer, for the\r\n      reason that these places had little trade with the Mongols. In the\r\n      rest of the kingdom it now became necessary to introduce silver\r\n      money, and in the north to return to real squirrel and beaver skins.\r\n      _Karamsin_, Russ.

(_Karamsin_, XI, 183.)\r\n\r\n  707 When the Danes progressed so far as to practice agriculture, they\r\n      used grain instead of cattle, in quantities corresponding to the\r\n      value of one cow or one sheep, for money, to the end that their idea\r\n      of a unit of measure might not become obscured.

In Draco’s time, money-fines were imposed in cattle\r\n      (_Pollux_, IX, 60 ff.), and in Athens, before Solon’s time, even the\r\n      metal coins were, for the most part, stamped with the figure of an\r\n      ox. _Plutarch_, Theseus, 25. _Böckh_., Metr.

N., XVIII, 3, _Cassiodor._,\r\n      Var., VII, 32), and the words _pecunia_, _peculium_, _peculatus_,\r\n      derived from _pecus_, point to something analogous. (_Varro_, De L.\r\n      L., V, 19; De Re rust., II, 1; _Cicero_, De Rep., II, 9; _Ovid_,\r\n      Fast., V, 281; _Plutarch_, Publicola, 11.)

Similarly, in King Stephen’s laws of Hungary\r\n      (_Wachsmuth_, Europäische Sitturgesch., II), in the old Irish Brehon\r\n      laws (_Leland_; History of Ireland, 36 ff.), as well as in the\r\n      Scotch collection of laws, _Regiam Majestatem_, of 1330. (_Honard_,\r\n      II, 263 f, 537.) _Viva pecunia_ of the Anglo-Saxons in the laws of\r\n      William I. In ancient Sweden, all property was estimated in\r\n      _fä_=cattle (_Geijer_, Schw. Gesch., I, 100), just as now, in\r\n      Icelandic, _fe_=property. In Berne, the German _vieh_, cattle, is\r\n      used to express commodities. Among really nomadic races this is, of\r\n      course, still more the case. Thus the Kirghises use horses and sheep\r\n      as money, and wolf-skins and lamb-skins for small change. (_Pallas_,\r\n      Reise durch Russland, 1771, I, 390.) Among some of the Tartar\r\n      tribes, everything is stipulated for in cows. (_v. Haxthausen_,\r\n      Studien, II, 371.) Among the Persian nomads, sheep are used as\r\n      money; or when they are held in subjection in the cities, corn,\r\n      straw and wool. (_Ritter_, Erdkunde, VIII, 386.) Oxen in use as\r\n      money among the Tscherkessens. (_Klemm_, Kulturgeschichte, IX, 16.)\r\n      _W. B. Hermann_ doubts, however, whether cattle were ever used as a\r\n      medium of exchange. He thinks rather they were employed only as a\r\n      measure of price. (Münchener Gel. Anz., 580.)\r\n\r\n  709 That of vanity which presents itself among some people sooner than\r\n      that of clothing.\r\n\r\n  710 In Genesis, 1, 24, gold appears only as a valuable ornament. Abraham\r\n      paid for his purchases in silver.\r\n\r\n  711 For this reason, zinc-money is just as natural with the Malays and\r\n      Chinese as iron-money with the Senegambians. (_Mungo Park_, Travels,\r\n      27.) And so _Plutarch_, Lysand., 17, may be right when he calls iron\r\n      the earliest universal means of payment. In Sparta, too, where\r\n      industrious efforts were made to maintain the lower stage of\r\n      culture, this medium of payment was longest maintained. Compare,\r\n      however, _St. John_, The Hellenes, III, 260 ff. The first copper\r\n      coins were stamped a short time before Philip, father of Alexander\r\n      the Great. (_Eckhel_, Doctr. Numm, I, XXX ff.) On the other hand,\r\n      Italy, partly because it had mines of its own, and partly because of\r\n      its intercourse with Carthage (Cyprus), had become, at a very\r\n      distant period, so rich in copper that the circulation of copper, or\r\n      to speak more accurately, of bronze, was naturally introduced.\r\n      Compare _Niebuhr_, Röm. Gesch., I, 475 ff. (_Aes alienum, obæratus,\r\n      ærarium, æstimare._) Copper was all the more adapted to this end the\r\n      more frequently it was found unmixed. It was generally used in\r\n      preference to iron because of the greater facility of working it.\r\n      (_Hesiod._, Opp., 150 f.; _Lucret._, V, 1285 f.) In modern nations\r\n      copper money seems to have been employed only after silver money.\r\n      Thus, it was not stamped in England before the time of James I.\r\n      (_Adam Smith_, I, ch. 5), nor in Sweden before 1625. (_Geijer_,\r\n      Schwed., Gesch., III, 56.)

On the other hand, in France, between 1727 and 1796,\r\n      there were struck only 40 million francs of copper, 10 million of\r\n      _billon_ or base coin, and 3967 million of gold and silver.\r\n\r\n_  713 Michaelis_, De Pretiis Rerum apud veteres Hebræos, 183.\r\n\r\n_  714 Strabo_, VIII, 358.

(_Putsch._) It is certain, however, that when Italy was\r\n      conquered, the Romans had introduced a circulating medium of silver,\r\n      and that it was the prevailing medium; but in the time of Cæsar and\r\n      Augustus, a gold circulation was the prevalent one. Yet the state\r\n      treasure was deposited in gold during the period of silver\r\n      circulation, because gold was, without question, better adapted to\r\n      storing up and transportation.\r\n\r\n_  716 Muratori_, Antiquitt., IV, Diss., 28.\r\n\r\n  717 Henry was obliged to issue an order to the mayor and sheriffs of\r\n      London, to get his gold into circulation; but he soon saw himself\r\n      compelled to desist from executing his design.

In Egypt, also,\r\n      for a long time the wealthiest country of the middle ages, the\r\n      circulation of gold prevailed until the twelfth century. (_Macrisi_,\r\n      Historia Monetae Arab., cap. 3 ed., _Tychsen_.) Harun Alraschid’s\r\n      income was estimated at about 7,500 cwt. of gold. (_Ritter_,\r\n      Erdkunde, X, 235.)

In Calcutta, 1280 _cauris_ are\r\n      equivalent to about half a shilling.

Salt as money on the\r\n      Chinese-Birman boundary (_Marco Polo_, 38), but especially in the\r\n      interior of Africa, where nature does not at all produce it, but\r\n      into which it is brought by caravans from the deserts, where salt is\r\n      found in great quantities. _M. Polo_, Travels, 305, found the\r\n      current price of a salt-tablet, two and a half feet long, one foot,\r\n      two inches broad, and two inches thick, to be equal to the value of\r\n      two pounds sterling among the Mandingos. In Abyssinia, the salt-bars\r\n      are generally six inches long, three inches broad, one and a half\r\n      inches thick, and they are bound with an iron ring to protect them\r\n      against fracture. Sixty of them are worth one thaler. (Ausland,\r\n      1846, No. 35.)

(_Ritter_, Asien, III,\r\n      252,) In Keachta, a tea-block is equal in price to one paper ruble.\r\n      (Ausland, 1846, No. 20. _Timkowski_, Reise nach China, 143.)\r\n      Date-money in the Sivah oasis.

Taschenbuch, 1835, 515.) That the\r\n      ancient northern mode of valuation, by the _Vadhmâl_ and in cows is\r\n      older than by the _mark_ is shown by _Wilda_, Gesch. des deutschen\r\n      Strafrechts, I, 331. The cod-fish money used by the Icelanders was,\r\n      on account of its great commercial importance as an article of\r\n      export, an advance upon the use of the _Vadhmâl_. Among the Caffirs,\r\n      besides _cauris_, mats, javelins, glass corals, but particularly\r\n      brass rings, are used as money. From three to four hundred of these\r\n      rings are strung together, and two such strings are equal in value\r\n      to one cow. (_Klemm_, Kulturgeschichte, III, 308, 320 f.) Ivory used\r\n      as money in the neighborhood of the Portuguese colonies in Africa.\r\n      (_Martius_, Reise, II, 670.) In Logone, _Denham_ (1822) ff., had met\r\n      with pieces of iron as a medium of circulation; but on the other\r\n      hand, _Barth_ (1849), with small strips of cotton from 2 to 3 inches\r\n      in breadth, and shirts for larger sums. (A. R., III, 274, 297, 538.)\r\n      In colonies, money of this nature is continued for a long time. Thus\r\n      cod-fish used in Newfoundland, sugar in the English West Indies\r\n      (_Adam Smith_, I, ch. 4), tobacco in Maryland and Virginia.\r\n      (_Douglas_, V, 2, 389; _Ebeling_, V, 435 ff.) The last was related\r\n      to the inspection and storage of the tobacco intended for\r\n      exportation. Payment was made in orders on the stored and inspected\r\n      tobacco, even as late as the end of the eighteenth century. In 1618,\r\n      the forced circulation of tobacco was decreed in Virginia, and under\r\n      severe penalties. (_Gouge_, History of Paper-Money and Banking in\r\n      the United States, ch. 1.)\r\n\r\n  721 When the caravans no longer touched at the oasis Agades, gold and\r\n      silver money fell into disuse, and grain, stuffs etc. did service as\r\n      instruments of circulation. (_Barth_, Reisen und Endeckungen, I,\r\n      144.)\r\n\r\n_  722 Ad. Müller_ says very pertinently, but in a very mystical vein,\r\n      that the precious metals combine in a very high degree and yet in a\r\n      very simple manner, the principal qualities in which man’s greatness\r\n      finds expression: rarity, flexibility, uniformity, mobility,\r\n      durability and beauty. (Elemente, II, 266.) In another place, he\r\n      says, the highest ideal good is God, the highest material good,\r\n      gold! (III, 65.) The mysticism of gold was most highly developed\r\n      among the alchymists of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\r\n\r\n  723 Iron beds are worked only when they contain at least 18 per cent. of\r\n      metal. Generally it is estimated that the furnace should yield 30\r\n      per cent. In the copper mines of Mansfield, Norway, Agordo and\r\n      Venice, it goes as low as from one to three per cent. On the other\r\n      hand, silver mines which yield 0.17 per cent. of metal are\r\n      considered worth working. Lastly, gold is so rare that generally it\r\n      can be extracted only from time to time by the ordinary mining\r\n      processes. As a rule, men are content to gather it where nature has\r\n      charged itself with its refining. The extreme limit of the working\r\n      of gold appears, according to _Plattner_ and _Haussmann_, at Goslar,\r\n      to be reached when in 5,200,000 parts of mineral earth there is one\r\n      of gold. Spite of this, however, by reason of their great ductility,\r\n      the precious metals have been able to penetrate even into the\r\n      meanest huts in one form or another. It has been estimated that a\r\n      silver leaf may be attenuated by beating to a thickness of only\r\n      0.00001 of an inch, and a gold leaf to 0.0000035 of an inch. An\r\n      ounce of gold spread on a silver thread may attain a length of\r\n      13,000 English miles. (_McCulloch._)\r\n\r\n  724 How easily, for instance, could leather-money, such as was used by\r\n      the ancient Galls (_Cassiodor._, Varia, II, 32,) be increased to any\r\n      desired quantity, and thus its price brought down.\r\n\r\n_  725 Engel_, at the usual tariff for land and railroad freight (10 and 5\r\n      _pfennigs_ per mile and hundredths of a mile) estimates the\r\n      enhancement of the price of the following commodities, for one mile\r\n      of transportation of a custom-hundred-weight (_Zollcentner_) at the\r\n      following percentage of their average value:\r\n\r\n      Gold, value 47610 German _Reichsthaler_ per cwt., 0.000007 by land,\r\n      0.0000035 by railroad.\r\n      Silver, value 3000, 0.00111 by land, 0.00055 by railroad.\r\n      Cotton, value 45, 0.074 by land, 0.037 by railroad.\r\n      Tin, value 24, 0.1389 by land, 0.0694 by railroad.\r\n      Lead, value 8, 0.416 by land, 0.208 by railroad.\r\n      Iron, value 2.5, 1.333 by land, 0.666 by railroad.\r\n      Rye, value 2, 1.666 by land, 0.833 by railroad.\r\n      Potatoes, value 0.6, 5.555 by land, 2.777 by railroad.\r\n      Coal, value 0.12, 27.777 by land, 13.888 by railroad.\r\n\r\n      Their great specific gravity, also, makes the precious metals easy\r\n      of transportation. Thus _Cazeau_ calculates that a given value of\r\n      gold is 17,222 times as easy to transport as the same value in\r\n      wheat. But as, where the weight is the same, the labor of\r\n      transportation is inversely as the volume, this number must be\r\n      multiplied by 26, and we therefore have 447,772 times. In the case\r\n      of silver, the relation to wheat is as 1:15,554. Concerning copper,\r\n      see _Storch_, Handbuch 1, 488. _Chevalier_, Cours, III, 17 ff.\r\n\r\n  726 This, at bottom, is also true, of the various kinds of copper; only,\r\n      here, complete refining is impracticable on account of the relation\r\n      between the cost of production and the product-price.\r\n\r\n  727 On the other hand, copper, and still more zinc, tin and lead lose\r\n      much of their value in the fire. Pearls may lose their entire value\r\n      by fire, and diamonds more than half of it.\r\n\r\n_  728 Aqua-regia_, a mixture of nitric and muriatic acid, dissolves gold.\r\n      Chlorine and bromine attack it. It has been noticed to vaporize at a\r\n      very high temperature. A gold thread vaporizes when a strong\r\n      electric current is passed through it. A small ball of gold gives\r\n      off a great deal of vapor if placed between two carbon points and\r\n      subjected to the action of a powerful galvanic pile. (_K.

On the other\r\n      hand, its pliability as to form is very small, and therefore the\r\n      cost of coining it would be high. The conversion of platinum coins\r\n      into utensils, and of utensils into coin, which would contribute to\r\n      the supply of money when needed, and to a diminution of that supply\r\n      when the demand decreased, would be much more difficult on this\r\n      account; and also because of the small degree of beauty possessed by\r\n      that metal, which renders it little adapted to purposes of luxury.\r\n      Under these circumstances, the rarity in nature of the metal is a\r\n      great drawback; for the discovery of a new mine would create a great\r\n      perturbation in prices. For this reason, the Russian platinum coins\r\n      have been generally very much undervalued since 1828 in the\r\n      commercial world, and the whole experiment was given up in 1845-46.\r\n      Compare _J.

The capacity of money to act as\r\n      a storer of wealth has been as much over-estimated by the so called\r\n      Mercantile System, as its capacity to transfer wealth has been by\r\n      the so called currency-school.\r\n\r\n_  738 Adam Smith_ compares money to a large wheel, by means of which a\r\n      due share of the means of subsistence and of enjoyment is\r\n      distributed to each member of society. Elsewhere he compares its\r\n      utility to streets and roads. (Wealth of Nations, II, ch. 2.)\r\n      _Hume_, On Money, Pr., prefers to compare it to the oil with which\r\n      the wheels of circulation are greased. _Sismondi_ compares money to\r\n      porters. (N. Principes, II, ch. 2.) “Money is to commerce what\r\n      railways are to locomotion, a contrivance to diminish friction.”\r\n      (_J. S. Mill._) According to _Schmitthenner_, 455, it bears the same\r\n      relation to other commodities that the written language of a\r\n      people’s literature does to their dialects.\r\n\r\n_  739 Law’s_ views on money are, in part, excellent. Thus, for instance,\r\n      he says that the debasement of the coin from financial necessity is\r\n      as great a folly as it would be to try to enlarge a piece of goods\r\n      too small for the purpose for which it was intended, by diminishing\r\n      the length of the yard-stick. (Sur l’Usage des Monnaies, 697.) A\r\n      country entirely isolated from all others could get along as well\r\n      with one hundred pounds sterling as with a million. (Money and\r\n      Trade, p. 88.) Elsewhere, he confounds money and capital to such a\r\n      degree that he considers every increase of the amount of money in a\r\n      country as an enrichment of the people, a means to give employment\r\n      to the poor, to carry on manufactures etc. (Money and Trade, 23, 26\r\n      ff., 168.) A given quantity of money is capable of giving employment\r\n      at most only to a certain number of men. (21.) A nation’s power and\r\n      wealth depend on the population and its stores of goods, these on\r\n      commerce, and commerce in turn on the amount of money. (Pp. 110,\r\n      220.) The advice given, in 1848, to the National Assembly of France,\r\n      but which it had the good sense to reject, to overflow all France\r\n      with the so-called _bons hypothécaires_, is akin to Law’s practical\r\n      propositions. _M. Chevalier_, Cours, III, 8, rightly ridicules the\r\n      literal construction of the words: _l’argent est abondant_, when\r\n      merchants find it easy to obtain credit, and considers it as well\r\n      grounded as it would be to infer from the maxim: _l’argent est le\r\n      nerf de la guerre_, that rifles and bullets were made of silver.\r\n\r\n_  740 Adam Smith_ was not entirely clear, in his own mind, on this point.\r\n      Thus inconsistently enough, he calls money unproductive—“dead\r\n      stock,” for the reason that it leaves no material traces behind it\r\n      of the goods which it has transferred from one hand to another. (II,\r\n      ch. 2.) Is not the same true of trade itself? And yet Adam Smith\r\n      calls trade productive. His error is doubtless a remnant of the\r\n      Physiocratic doctrine, to which Smith still held. Compare _Quesnay_,\r\n      94, éd. Daire. Even _Twiss_ says that money employed as money is\r\n      unproductive, but that, when employed as a commodity, it is\r\n      productive. (View of the Progress of Political Economy, since the\r\n      sixteenth Century, 1847.) Besides it is not a peculiarity of money\r\n      alone, that, after it has served the purposes of production, it\r\n      comes out of the product unaltered. The same is true of quicksilver\r\n      employed in amalgamation. (_Hermann_, 2nd edition, 302.)\r\n\r\n_  741 Senior_, Three Lectures on the Value of Money, 1840, is, in so far,\r\n      not wrong when he says that the value in exchange of the precious\r\n      metals is still ultimately determined by the want of such\r\n      commodities as are luxuries. This last determines to what extent the\r\n      production shall be extended by the working of the poorest mines,\r\n      whereas the wants of circulation can be met as well by small as\r\n      large quantities of the metals.\r\n\r\n  742 The good or bad result of this production depends on many different\r\n      elements which may compensate on another. In California and\r\n      Australia gold is to be found in large quantities, and is easily\r\n      mined; but the workmen make large demands which the nature of the\r\n      country renders it difficult to meet. In the Harz mines, where the\r\n      cost is scarcely covered, (_Lehzen_, Hannover’s Staatshaushalt,\r\n      1853, I, 139), the shafts are sometimes 175-½ fathoms deep, but this\r\n      is made up for in a measure by the moderate demands of the workmen\r\n      and their skill in mining. Among the Mandingos, the auriferous\r\n      material is so rich that ⅓ per 1,000 of the weight of the sand is\r\n      washed out into pure gold in ten minutes (_M. Park_, Journal, 53\r\n      ff., addenda, XIX), while in Europe, where the proportion is only\r\n      1/100 per 1,000, mines are still considered worth working. But then,\r\n      what workmen there are there! In Peru, the burdensome height of the\r\n      mines above the level of the sea and the want of combustible\r\n      material more than counterbalance many favorable advantages, while\r\n      in Norway the cheapness of wood compensates for a great many\r\n      disadvantages. Another thing which contributes towards the\r\n      uniformity of the price of the precious metals is the circumstance\r\n      that the great amount of fixed capital required in the greater\r\n      number of mining enterprises, postpones for a long time the working\r\n      of good mines as well as the abandonment of poor ones.\r\n\r\n  743 Older writers have estimated the amount of money necessary in a\r\n      country at 1/5, 1/10 (_Petty_), 1/15, and even 1/30 of the yearly\r\n      income of a people (_Adam Smith_, II, ch. 2.) According to\r\n      _Cantillon_, Sur la Nature du Commerce, p. 73, it is from 1/6 to\r\n      1/10 of the annual gross production of a nation.\r\n\r\n_  744 Davanzati_, Lezione sulle Moneta, 1588, 32 ff., Cust., thinks that\r\n      all terrestrial things which serve to satisfy the wants of men are,\r\n      by virtue of agreement, equal in value to all the gold, silver and\r\n      copper; and that the parts comport themselves as the whole. The\r\n      price of a commodity is based on this, that men find in it as much\r\n      of their _beatitudine_ as is afforded them by a given quantum of\r\n      gold etc. Similarly, _Montanari_, who adds as a limitation the\r\n      quantity of money _spendibile in commercio_. (Della Moneta, 45, 64,\r\n      Cust.) The same opinion leads _Locke_ to the singular conclusion,\r\n      that, as there is now in the world, ten times as much silver as\r\n      there was previous to the discovery of America, each single piece of\r\n      silver, separately considered, and taken in relation to such\r\n      commodities as have not varied, is worth only one-tenth of what it\r\n      was then. _Locke_, here, starts out with the gross assumption,\r\n      shared even by _Ganilh_, Théorie, II, 386 ff., that in the case of\r\n      money the demand is always, relatively speaking, equally strong and\r\n      just as great as the supply, or as the amount in the market. (Works,\r\n      II, 23 ff.) Further, _Montesquieu_, Esprit des Lois, XXII, 7, 8. Per\r\n      contra, however, see _Montesquieu_, ibid. XXII, 5, 6, and _Hume_, On\r\n      Money and on the Balance of Commerce, Essays II, 1752.\r\n\r\n      Hume knew perfectly well, that only circulating money and\r\n      circulating commodities operated on price, but failed to take the\r\n      rapidity of circulation into account. Similarly, _Forbonnais_,\r\n      Eléments du Commerce, II, 212; even _Canard_, Principes, ch. 6;\r\n      _Fichte_, Geschloss. Handelstaat, 93 ff., and _Stein_, Lehrbuch, 58.\r\n      Contested by _Law_, Trade and Money considered, 140, a work directed\r\n      especially against the Mercantilistic essay, Britannia languens;\r\n      1680, by _Mélon_, Essai politique sur le Commerce, ch. 22;\r\n      _Genovesi_, Economia civile, 1764, II, 1, 15; _Steuart_, Principles,\r\n      II, ch. 28; _Verri_, Meditazioni, XVII, 3 ff.; _Büsch_, Gedlumlauf,\r\n      II, 40. The simple taking of an inventory of most private resources\r\n      which possess so much greater value in other commodities than in\r\n      money is enough to demonstrate the error of _Davanzati’s_ doctrine.\r\n      Thus, in France, in Necker’s time, the cash money in the kingdom was\r\n      estimated at 2,200,000,000 livres, and the average value of the\r\n      wheat crop alone at 1,000,000,000. _Necker_, Législation et Commerce\r\n      des Grains, 1776, I, 215. Recently, _Michel Chevalier_, estimated\r\n      the amount of money in France at from 3-½ to 4 milliards, while the\r\n      official estimate of its immovable property alone was over 83\r\n      milliards.\r\n\r\n  745 When money becomes dearer, less of it is of course needed; and when\r\n      cheaper, more, for the same purpose.\r\n\r\n  746 In contradistinction to presents, acts of spoliation, but especially\r\n      to barter.\r\n\r\n  747 The discoverer of this truth is supposed by many to be _Bandini_,\r\n      Discorso economico, 1737, 141 f., Cust. _Berkely_, however, in the\r\n      Querist, 1735, 477 f, writes: “A sixpence twice paid is as good as a\r\n      shilling once paid.” Much earlier yet, in 1797, _Boisguillebert_,\r\n      Détail de la France, II, 19, had the germ of this doctrine, but he\r\n      confounds circulation with consumption. And _Locke_, Considerations,\r\n      II, 13 ff., presented it in 1691 with great clearness, although he\r\n      did not always remain true to his theory. Compare _Quesnay_, éd.\r\n      Daire, 64; _Cantillon_, 159 ff., 382.\r\n\r\n  748 If the number of annual exchanges effected by 1 dollar = u; the\r\n      total number of dollars in the store of money = m; the rapidity of\r\n      circulation, that is the number of exchanges effected on an average\r\n      by each dollar in a year, = s: then is u = m s, s = u/m, m = u/s.\r\n\r\n  749 Since good money is so easily stored away and preserved, no one is\r\n      in haste to get rid of it. _St. Chamans_, N. Essai sur la Richesse\r\n      des Nations, 122 ff.\r\n\r\n  750 Among the Kurds, all the money in their camps is used for\r\n      head-ornaments for their women. (_K. Ritter_, Erdkunde, X, 887.)\r\n\r\n  751 Thus, _Sir David North_, Discourse on Trade, 1691, Postscr.\r\n\r\n_  752 Lotz_, Handbuch, 377, is of opinion that even in England £100,000\r\n      employed in trade in land can scarcely effect exchanges to the\r\n      amount of £1,000,000 in a year. The same sum employed for the same\r\n      purpose in London, in stocks and in the trade in commodities, will\r\n      effect exchanges to the amount of £160,000,000.\r\n\r\n_  753 Cernuschi_, Mécanique de l’Échange, 1865, 132 ff.\r\n\r\n  754 Thus _Petty_ (ob. 1687) is of opinion that England needed as much\r\n      money as ½ of all its ground-rents amounted to, as the ¼ of all\r\n      house-rents, and 1/52 of all the wages of labor for a year; for the\r\n      reason that ground-rents are paid semi-annually, house-rents\r\n      quarterly, and wages weekly. (Several Essays, 179; Political Anatomy\r\n      of Ireland, 116.) _Locke_, on the other hand, assumes 1/50 of the\r\n      wages of labor, ¼ of all the revenue of land owners, and 1/20 of the\r\n      amount cash money taken in in a year by merchants. Of these amounts,\r\n      there should be always, at least, one-half in ready money on hand,\r\n      if commerce would not be brought to a stand-still. If leases were to\r\n      be paid for on short terms, a great saving of money would be\r\n      possible. (Works, II, 13 ff.) _Pinto_, Traité du Crédit et de la\r\n      Circulation, 34, calls special attention to the case of Tournay, in\r\n      which the commandant, during the siege of 1745, made 7,000 florins\r\n      serve him for seven weeks to pay the garrison; by borrowing that sum\r\n      anew every week from the inn-keepers etc.; which they, again, had\r\n      received from the soldiers.\r\n\r\n  755 If all were to commit their payments to the care of the same banker,\r\n      it would be possible to do with almost no money. But even now, if\r\n      100 separate merchants were obliged to keep each 3,000 dollars in\r\n      their money-chests for unforseen contingencies, a banker might\r\n      accomplish the same for them with 50,000 dollars, because it is not\r\n      probable that the unforseen contingencies in question would occur to\r\n      all at the same time.\r\n\r\n  756 In the London Clearing-House, in 1839, £954,401,600 were paid by\r\n      means of the use of £66,275,600 as a circulating medium, for the\r\n      most part notes of the Bank of England.

As early a writer as\r\n      _Sir J. Child_, N. Discourse on Trade, 46, says, that for some time,\r\n      every man who had from £50 to £100 in money, sent it to his banker,\r\n      and that since that time, all the money flowed towards London and\r\n      the country was deprived of it. (127 ff.) As a rule, the goldsmiths\r\n      were also bankers. One such smith had at the time of the Great Fire\r\n      of 1666, emitted £1,200,000 in notes. (A Discourse etc., 67.) The\r\n      Bank of England, as a money center, dates from 1694. The London\r\n      banks developed into intermediaries principally before the time of\r\n      the French Revolution. (_Thornton_, Paper-Credit of Great Britain,\r\n      1802.) This remarkable institution had grown to vast dimensions even\r\n      in Thornton’s time, although it has been much enlarged since 1825.\r\n      (_Tooke_, History of Prices, 152 f.) Similar conditions among almost\r\n      all highly civilized peoples. Thus in Greece, compare _Becker_,\r\n      Charicles, I, 294. Concerning a person who had 14 talents’ worth of\r\n      resources, 26 minæ, and therefore three per cent. in cash, see\r\n      Lysias, adv. Diog., 6. In Rome, compare _Polyb._, XXXII, 13.\r\n      _Cicero_, pro Font., I, 1. For Italian analogous cases, part of\r\n      which may be traced back as far as the twelfth century, see\r\n      _Lobero_, Memorie storiche della Banca de S. Georgio, 1832; or the\r\n      Dutch “cassiere” Richesse de Hollande, I, 376, ff. In France an ever\r\n      increasing centralization of the money-trade is to be noticed in\r\n      Paris (_M. Chevalier_, Cours., III, 418); and now of the money-trade\r\n      of Germany in Berlin.\r\n\r\n  758 Compare _Fullarton_, On the Regulation of Currencies, 1845. Among\r\n      the Dutch, the custom of using all commercial commodities as much as\r\n      possible, as a basis of the circulating medium, was much earlier\r\n      developed. (_Child_, Discourse on Trade, 65, 264 f.) In Great\r\n      Britain, the aggregate amount of bills of exchange put in\r\n      circulation was, in 1839, £528,000,000, which sum has been increased\r\n      annually at the rate of about £24,000,000. (_Tooke_, Inquiry into\r\n      the Currency Principle, 26.) Between 1828 and 1847, there circulated\r\n      at the same moment, on an average, £79,127,000 in bills of exchange\r\n      in England, and in Scotland, £17,380,000 (Athenæum, 1850, No. 175),\r\n      and in Great Britain and Ireland, from £180,000,000 to £200,000,000.\r\n      (_Tooke_, History of Prices, VI, 588,) According to _Macleod_, the\r\n      bills of exchange and promissory notes together amounted to\r\n      £500,000,000; bills of exchange, bank-notes and bank-credits, to\r\n      over £600,000,000. (Elements, 12, 325.) _Macleod_ calls the currency\r\n      the sum total of all debts due by every individual in the country.\r\n      (Elements, 43.)\r\n\r\n  759 A case in England, in 1857, in which a house with £10,000 capital\r\n      failed with liabilities amounting to £900,000. (Report of the select\r\n      Committee on the Bank Act, 1858, XV.) Or where a speculator with\r\n      £1,200 made purchases on credit to the amount of £80,000, and then\r\n      failed with a deficit of £16,000. (_Fawcett_, Manual, 442 f.)\r\n\r\n  760 Remarked by as early a writer as _Davenant_, Works, IV, 106 ff.\r\n      Compare, however, II, 238. _Quesnay_, éd. Daire, 75 ff. _Lord King_,\r\n      Thoughts on the Effects of the Bank Restriction, 1804, 17 ff.\r\n      Exhaustively treated by _Chevalier_, Cours., III, 397 ff. He very\r\n      much laments the fact that the customs of France cause it to need\r\n      from 3½ to 4 milliards of cash money, while England does a much\r\n      larger trade with 1,200 millions. (I, 207 ff.) In France, it is said\r\n      that the amount of money, in 1812, was 1,500,000,000 francs(?).\r\n      (_Peuchet_, Statistique élémentaire, 473.) In Prussia, in 1805, it\r\n      was 90,000,000 thalers. (_Krug_, Betracht. über den\r\n      Nationalwohlstand des preuss. St., I, 244.) The annual amount of\r\n      production in the former country was, 7,036,000,000 francs; in the\r\n      latter it was estimated at 261,000,000 thalers, so that in Prussia\r\n      the relation of money to national income was, as 1:2.9; in France,\r\n      as 1:4.69.\r\n\r\n  761 It is scarcely possible to determine exactly the amount of money in\r\n      a country; for the reason that, outside of the suppositions of\r\n      bankers etc., there is no authority which can be safely relied on,\r\n      unless it be the reports concerning the coinage, and of the emission\r\n      of paper money. The information, no less necessary, to be derived\r\n      from the statistics of the importation and exportation of money, the\r\n      melting down of coin by gold smelters etc., can never be exactly\r\n      obtained. In England, at the end of the sixteenth century, the\r\n      circulating medium was estimated at £4,000,000 (_Hume_, History of\r\n      England, ch. 44, App.); under Charles II., at £6,000,000, when the\r\n      population was 6,000,000. (_Petty_, Several Essays, 179.) About\r\n      1711, _Davenant_, New Dialogues, 11 ff., mentions £12,000,000 as the\r\n      amount; and _Anderson_, Origin of Commerce, a., 1659, £16,000,000 in\r\n      1762. The circulation of gold, shortly before 1797, was estimated by\r\n      _Rose_ at, at least, £40,000,000; by Lord _Liverpool_, at\r\n      £30,000,000; by _Tooke_, at only £22,500,000. (History of Prices, V,\r\n      130 ff.) _Moreau de Jonnés_, 1837, assumed £43,500,000 (Statistique,\r\n      I, 329), and _Helferich_ (Schwankungen der edlen Met., 1843, 147),\r\n      £45,000,000. _Sir Robert Peel_, estimated the amount in 1845 at\r\n      £59,000,000, to which was to be added an average of £28,000,000 in\r\n      bank notes, after deduction made of the metallic reserve. According\r\n      to _Jevons_, the amount of British money is now £80,000,000 in gold,\r\n      £14,000,000 in silver, £1,000,000 in copper; the sum total,\r\n      including bullion and bank notes, after the deduction of their\r\n      metallic representatives, £134,000,000. (Economist, December, 1868,\r\n      July, 1869.) In France, _Vauban_, Dîme royale, 104 (Daire),\r\n      estimated the cash money at about 500,000,000 livres, over\r\n      750,000,000 francs, with which _Voltaire_, Siècle de Louis, XIV, ch.\r\n      30, agrees so far as the year 1683 is concerned. In 1730,\r\n      _Voltaire_, assumes the amount to be 1,200,000,000 of the coins of\r\n      that time. _Necker_, Administration des Finances, III, 66, estimated\r\n      it, in 1784, at 2,200,000,000 livres; _Mollien_, about 1806, at\r\n      2,300,000,000. The valuations in Louis Philippe’s time varied from\r\n      2,400,000,000 to 2,500,000,000 (Chamber of Deputies, April, 13,\r\n      1847), and 4,000,000,000. (_Blanqui._) The valuations of 1870 were,\r\n      according to _Wolowski_, 4 milliards; and to _Bonnet_, from 5 to 6\r\n      milliards. Compare _Wolowski_, L’Or et l’Argent, 383 ff., Euquête,\r\n      42. The German Zollverein is said to have had, at the beginning of\r\n      1870 (_Soetbeer_) 480,000,000 or 520,000,000 thalers (_Weibezahn_)\r\n      cash money.\r\n\r\n      In Wirtemberg, _Memminger_, 1840, estimated the resources of the\r\n      country at 1,600,000,000 guldens, of which 36,000,000 were cash; and\r\n      the yearly gross income at 179,000,000 guldens; so that the money\r\n      was 20 per cent. of the latter and 2¼ per cent. of the former. The\r\n      annual sales = 226,000,000. Therefore the coin currency must have\r\n      circulated on an average between six and seven times in a year. In\r\n      the electorate of Hesse, there were _per capita_ 4 thalers, 18\r\n      sgrs., 9 hellers, metallic money, and 3 thalers, 9 sgrs., 4 hellers,\r\n      paper-money. (_B. Hildebrand_, Statist. Mitth., 1853, 185.) The\r\n      amount of money in Naples, in 1840, was estimated at 42,000,000\r\n      ducats. (_Scialoja._) It has been estimated that, in 1830, Spain\r\n      possessed 1,725,000,000 francs. (_Barrego von Rottenkamp_, 330.)\r\n\r\n_  762 Montanari_, Della Moneta, 52 ff.\r\n\r\n_  763 David Hume’s_ very influential essay on the balance of trade does\r\n      not give expression to this error, but he certainly was the occasion\r\n      of making a great many of his disciples advocate it. It is related\r\n      to the error mentioned in § 123. _Quesnay_, 101 (Daire) saw this\r\n      point in a much clearer light. So did _Graumann_, Gesammelte Briefe\r\n      vom Gelde (1762), 12 ff.; 73 ff.\r\n\r\n  764 This is seen, for instance, when paper money is issued, in times\r\n      when trade is thriving, and is withdrawn when this conjuncture\r\n      ceases.\r\n\r\n  765 Very well elaborated by _Fullarton_, On the Regulation of\r\n      Currencies, 71 ff., 139 ff. Compare, however, _Becaria_, Economica\r\n      publica, IV, 4, 27. When England on the occasion of the removal of\r\n      the bank restriction in 1821 and 1822, caused £9,520,759 and\r\n      £5,356,788 to be stamped, this powerful demand scarcely affected the\r\n      gold-agio in Paris. (_M. Chevalier_, Cours, III, 157.) And, on the\r\n      other hand, the system of assignats, developed during the first\r\n      French Revolution, on so large a scale, had no influence on the\r\n      price of silver in the rest of Europe. (_Lord King_, Thoughts on the\r\n      Bank Restriction, 1804.) And so, _Tooke_, History of Prices, I, 205,\r\n      describes a very large increase of the medium of circulation, after\r\n      which the prices of commodities remained unchanged, corn fell,\r\n      colonial products rose in price, both as they had done before, and\r\n      from causes inherent in the commodities themselves. During the first\r\n      years of the bank restriction, 1799-1801, grain rose very rapidly in\r\n      price, while all trans-Atlantic products sank. (_Tooke_, I, 232 ff.)\r\n      The unusually large importation of wheat from January 1, 1846, to\r\n      January 14, 1847, was paid in France by a decrease of the bank\r\n      metallic reserve (_encaisse_) to the extent of 172,000,000 francs.\r\n      (_M. Chevalier_, Cours, III, 470.) An experienced practitioner in\r\n      England is of opinion that an increase of bank notes to the amount\r\n      of about £5,000,000 would not raise prices nor increase the tendency\r\n      to speculation, but only enlarge the deposits of the bankers. But,\r\n      if on the other hand, £5,000,000, by any sudden contingency, were to\r\n      be put into the hands of the working classes, this money would, for\r\n      the most part, enter immediately into circulation; the price of\r\n      commodities would, therefore, rise and continue to rise until that\r\n      amount had come into closer fists, as it would after some time.\r\n      (_Tooke_, III, 156 ff., II, 323.)\r\n\r\n  766 This explains the high price of gold in Farther Asia, which was\r\n      formerly separated from America, the principal source of supply of\r\n      the precious metals, by a journey around the earth, the then usual\r\n      course of the world’s trade.\r\n\r\n      The precious metals are generally higher in country places than in\r\n      large cities, and in the interior than on the sea-coast. Since the\r\n      public highways etc. in Germany have been so much improved, the\r\n      difference in the value of money in upper and lower Germany has\r\n      almost disappeared. (_Rau_, in the Archiv der polit. Oek., III,\r\n      338.)\r\n\r\n  767 Happy beginning of this doctrine in _Hume_, On the Balance of Trade.\r\n      Further, _Thornton_, The Paper Credit of Great Britain, ch. 11.\r\n      _Adam Smith_, on the other hand, claims that gold and silver,\r\n      because they are costly superfluities are uniformly paid most dearly\r\n      for, in the richest countries. (Wealth of Nations, I, ch. 11, 3:\r\n      Digr.)\r\n\r\n  768 Similarly in China, and even in Upper Egypt, the China, so to speak,\r\n      of antiquity! Compare _Herodot._, II, 112 ff; _Homer_, Od., IV, 354\r\n      ff. The religion of the Egyptians prescribed to them a mode of life\r\n      which was scarcely practicable in foreign parts. They were\r\n      systematically inspired with a horror for everything foreign. They\r\n      had a strong antipathy for salt, fish and pilots. In Egyptian\r\n      mythology, Osiris represents the Nile, Typhon the desert and the\r\n      sea! (_Plutarch_, De Iside, 32.)\r\n\r\n  769 The other party, of course, makes a profit also. He is in a better\r\n      condition than if he wished to produce the desired commodity in his\r\n      own country.\r\n\r\n  770 The first clear germ of this doctrine, which is one of the most\r\n      important theoretical principles of international-trade politics, is\r\n      to be found in _David Hume_, On Interest; _Cantillon_, Nature du\r\n      Commerce, 226, 369 ff. _Ricardo_, Principles, ch. 7. “Gold and\r\n      silver having been chosen for the general medium of circulation,\r\n      they are, by the competition of commerce, distributed in such\r\n      proportions amongst the different countries of the world, as to\r\n      accommodate themselves to the natural traffic which would take place\r\n      if no such metals existed, and the trade between countries were\r\n      purely a trade of barter.” _Rebenius_, Oeff. Credit, I, 29 ff. Still\r\n      further developed, especially by _John Stuart Mill_, Elements, 1821,\r\n      III, 4, 13 f.; _Torrens_, The Budget, 1844. _John Stuart Mill_,\r\n      Essays on some unsettled Principles of Political Economy, 1844, No.\r\n      1, and Principles, III, ch. 19, § 3, 5th ed.: “The opening of a new\r\n      branch of export trade from England; an increase in the foreign\r\n      demand for English products, either by the natural course of events\r\n      or by the abrogation of duties; a check to the demand in England for\r\n      foreign commodities, by the laying on of import duties in England,\r\n      or of export duties elsewhere; these and all other events of similar\r\n      tendency, should make the imports of England, bullion and other\r\n      things taken together, no longer an equivalent for the exports; and\r\n      the countries which take her exports would be obliged to offer their\r\n      commodities, and bullion among the rest, on cheaper terms, in order\r\n      to re-establish the equation of demand; and thus England would\r\n      obtain money cheaper, and would acquire a generally higher range of\r\n      prices.”\r\n\r\n      Obscurely surmised by _Beccaria_, E.P., 3, 18, and even by\r\n      _Galiani_, Della Moneta, II, 2. _Senior’s_ admirable work, Three\r\n      Lectures on the Cost of Obtaining Money, 1830, follows up the\r\n      thought that every country obtains indigenous and foreign products\r\n      at a cost which grows smaller in the same proportion as the\r\n      productiveness of its people’s labor is large. This would,\r\n      certainly, explain why it is that perhaps one hundred English days’\r\n      work in cotton manufactures will exchange against as much silver as\r\n      is produced by two hundred days’ work in Mexican mines and\r\n      foundries. This would not, by any means, produce a lowering of the\r\n      price of the precious metals relatively to other English\r\n      commodities, but the influence would be felt equally by all the\r\n      products of English national industry.\r\n\r\n  771 To be found in germ in _Cantillon_, Nature du Commerce, 1755, 249\r\n      ff. 307. _Büsch_, Geldumlauf, 14. _Kaufmann_, Untersuchungen, I, 75\r\n      ff. Many of the doctrines of the so-called Mercantile System, of\r\n      which I shall treat in my projected work on the Political Economy of\r\n      Commerce, have given expression to this truth in an inexact and\r\n      exaggerated way; but they were not entirely erroneous, as is\r\n      supposed by the adherents of Hume and Smith. However, _J. S. Mill_,\r\n      Principles II, ch. 19, § 2, does not fully admit the degree of the\r\n      cheapness of money in England usually assumed. According to him it\r\n      is wants of luxury (luxury-wants) become such through habit, that\r\n      produce “the dearness of living in England.”\r\n\r\n_  772 Petty_ considers the search for a measure which could be applied\r\n      both to land and labor as one of the principal problems of Political\r\n      Economy. (Political Anatomy of Ireland, 62 ff.) _Sir J. Steuart_,\r\n      Principles, III, ch. I, took the matter very easy by considering the\r\n      so-called “coin of account,” for instance, “bank-money,” as an\r\n      invariable value-magnitude. Compare _Jacob_, Grundsätze der National\r\n      Œkonomie, II, 441 ff. _Cazaux_, Economie politique et privée, 1825,\r\n      16 ff., has a not uninteresting study on this subject; but he goes,\r\n      throughout his argument, on the assumption that the rate of interest\r\n      is the price of money! If the rate of interest in two countries = I\r\n      and i, the prices of the same commodity = P and p, the true\r\n      thing-values, V and v; then we have v: V:: i p: I P!\r\n\r\n_  773 Law_, Trade and Money, 181. Before him, and quite correctly,\r\n      _Montanari_, Della Moneta, I, p. 84 ff., compares the means employed\r\n      of measuring one commodity by another, to the means used to estimate\r\n      time in terms of space, as when it is measured by the revolutions of\r\n      the hands of a clock, and again, space in terms of time.\r\n\r\n  774 The solvability or capacity to pay of buyers cannot be taken into\r\n      consideration here, because it is synonymous with the amount of\r\n      counter-values which are to be measured.\r\n\r\n_  775 Adam Smith_, Wealth of Nations, I, ch. 5. Similarly _Luther_, vom\r\n      Kaufhandel: Werke, ed. _Walch_, X, 1098 f. _B. Franklin_ considered\r\n      the labor employed in the production of wheat as the best measure of\r\n      prices. (Letter to Ld. Kames: Works, ed. _Sparks_, VII.) As Adam\r\n      Smith, so also _Sismondi_, Richesse commerciale, I, 371 f.; _Kraus_,\r\n      Staatswirthschaft, I, 84,; v. _Schlözer_, Anfangsgründe, I, 41. Also\r\n      _Malthus_, in the second and succeeding editions of his Principles,\r\n      ch. I, 6, and Definitions, ch. 8, 9. The Measure of Value, 1823.\r\n      _Zachariä_, Vierzig Bücher, VII, 53 f., maintains that, at least\r\n      within the limits of every separate nation, the average labor-power\r\n      of one man is invariable. Assuming this principle, therefore, to be\r\n      true, the means of subsistence necessary to support a laborer for\r\n      one work-day constitutes, indirectly, a measure of prices. _Tooke_,\r\n      History of Prices, I, 56, says that the amount of a day’s wages is\r\n      always a better measure of the price of the precious metals than the\r\n      price of wheat. Even in 1750, _Galiani_, Della Moneta, II, 2, had\r\n      denied the impossibility of an entirely invariable measure of price\r\n      in this world of change, but he considered man himself the least\r\n      variable of measures, and in a country where slavery prevailed,\r\n      slaves. He thought that the _macuta_ of the negroes were a part of\r\n      the average price of slaves. Practically, Adam Smith’s proposed\r\n      measure was used in the French constitution of 1791, in as much as\r\n      it provided that participation in primary assemblies should depend\r\n      on the participant’s paying an annual tax equal to the wages of\r\n      three days’ work, and eligibility as an _èlecteur_, on the\r\n      possession of an income equal in value to the wages paid for two\r\n      hundred days’ day-labor. _Owen_ endeavored to base the value of the\r\n      paper money in circulation in his Utopian commonwealth, not on any\r\n      metal of a certain weight or stamp, but on hours of labor as the\r\n      unit. (_Reybaud_, Réformateurs Contemporains, I, 255.)\r\n\r\n  776 The wretched condition, until within a short time since, of the\r\n      Irish working class, is well known; how they dwelt in mud cabins\r\n      without windows, board-floors or chimneys etc., in the same\r\n      apartment with their pigs; how they lived almost exclusively on\r\n      potatoes, and went about in rags. These same Irish, _coelum, non\r\n      animum mutantes_, received in North America for the coarsest kind of\r\n      labor, 50 to 75 cents wages, besides wheat bread and meat three\r\n      times a day, coffee and sugar twice a day, butter once, and seven or\r\n      eight glasses of whisky or brandy. (_M. Chevalier_, Lettres sur\r\n      l’Amérique du Nord, I, 159.)\r\n\r\n  777 Thus in Mauritius, the immigration of the coolies has produced a\r\n      decrease of negro wages, but an increase of negro industry. In the\r\n      Barbadoes, the negroes are more industrious and their wages lower\r\n      than in Jamaica. The wages of good workmen, as for instance during\r\n      the commercial crisis in Manchester, often sink, while the wages of\r\n      bad workmen rise; as, for example, in a village through which a\r\n      railroad is made to pass. Compare _Lauderdale_ Inquiry, ch. 1;\r\n      _Sartorius_, Abhandlungen, 1806, I, 16 ff.; _Lotz_, Revision, I, 99\r\n      ff.; _M.

See the\r\n      German translation of _Say_, II, 435, 507.\r\n\r\n  779 The introduction of the words “the socially necessary time of labor”\r\n      into the formulæ does not make the measure any more practical for\r\n      political economists or for socialists.\r\n\r\n_  780 Cantillon_, who reduces all the cost of production to land and\r\n      labor, considers the “at par” between these two to be this: that the\r\n      labor of the meanest slave corresponds to the quantity of land which\r\n      the owner is obliged to employ for his support, and the support of\r\n      the slave and of the children who are to take his place. (Nature du\r\n      Commerce, 42.) The Physiocrates thought that the internal (_innere_)\r\n      value of two commodities stood in the same relation to each other as\r\n      the area of land directly or indirectly necessary to their\r\n      production. _Schlettwein_, Grundfeste der Staaten, 1792, 230.\r\n\r\n  781 The so-called _Sachwerth_ (thing-value, real-value) of _Hermann_,\r\n      St. Untersuchungen, 101 ff. Thus _Poulett Scrope_ recommended a\r\n      “tabular standard,” to be officially established and renewed from\r\n      time to time, to serve as an anchor to those persons who wished\r\n      permanently to fix their money in such a manner as to make it\r\n      exchangeable for an equal value in _things_. (Principles of\r\n      Political Economy, 1833, 406.) Something of this kind was tried for\r\n      50 commodities, between 1833 and 1837, by _Porter_, Progress of the\r\n      Nation, 1st ed., II, 236 ff., then for 40 commodities by _Jevons_ in\r\n      the Statistical Journal, 1865. Of course, all commodities of a given\r\n      price are not equally important in this respect. Thus, for instance,\r\n      a fluctuation in the price of diamonds would have no effect on the\r\n      thing-value or real-value of a day’s wages, but it certainly would\r\n      on the thing-value of a princely income. There are some excellent\r\n      remarks on this very important subject in _Lowe’s_ work, On the\r\n      Actual Condition of England, chs. 8 and 9. The controversy carried\r\n      on between _Jevons_, A serious Fall in the Value of Gold, and its\r\n      social Effects, 1863; Statist. Journal, 1865; and _Laspeyres_,\r\n      _Hildebrand’s_ Jahrb., 1864, 81 ff.; 1871, I, 296 ff; in which the\r\n      former recommends the geometric mean of the relative prices of\r\n      separate commodities at different points of time, in order to\r\n      calculate the average relative price: and the latter, as usual, the\r\n      arithmetical mean, is very thoroughly reviewed and criticised by\r\n      _Drobisch_, who shows that neither of these methods is sufficient,\r\n      but that the quantity of every separate commodity must also be taken\r\n      into account, for which he furnishes practical formulæ. (Math. phys.\r\n      Berichte der _K._ Sächs. Gesellsch., 1871, I, 143 ff, 416 ff.) It is\r\n      certain that a fixed income in money could maintain its real value\r\n      or thing-value (_Sachwerth_) just as little if the cwt. of bread\r\n      rose by as many dollars as the cwt. of pepper had fallen; as if the\r\n      increasing price of bread depended on a decreasing price of pepper.\r\n\r\n_  782 Senior_, Outlines, 187. In addition to this, we may draw from the\r\n      thing-value of a day’s wages a right conclusion as to the economic\r\n      condition of the majority of the people; and assuming the customary\r\n      division of the national wealth, also as to the degree, to which the\r\n      people have subjected the forces of nature to their service.\r\n\r\n_  783 Ricardo_, ch. 22, refuted, indeed, only the view that an increase\r\n      in the wages of labor produced by the higher prices of corn, would\r\n      necessarily make all goods or products of labor, correspondingly\r\n      dearer.\r\n\r\n  784 Compare § 103. In Paris, in 1817, the _setier_ of wheat cost March\r\n      5, 55½ francs; April 2, 57 fr.; April 23, 60 fr.; May 14, 63 fr.;\r\n      May 21, 66 fr.; May 28, 75 fr.; June 4, 82 fr.; June 11, 92 fr.\r\n      (_Tooke_, History of Prices, II, 17.)\r\n\r\n_  785 Locke_, 98. When _Condillac_ asserts that wheat is the best measure\r\n      of prices, he adds, when free trade in wheat obtains. (Commerce et\r\n      Gouvernement, 1, 23.) _Fichte_, on the other hand, while advocating\r\n      the despotic guidance of all trade by the state, would employ wheat\r\n      as the fundamental measure of prices. (Geschl. Handelstaat, 47 ff.)\r\n      That grain does not afford a good measure of prices in very highly\r\n      cultivated nations nor in barbaric ones, see _Hermann_, II, Aufl.,\r\n      451.\r\n\r\n  786 The average price must be based on the prices of a great many years,\r\n      since crops vary not only from year to year in price, but from\r\n      decade to decade. See _Roscher_, Nationalökonomik des Ackerbaues, §\r\n      152, and _Roscher_, Kornhandel und Theuerungspolitik, 47 ff. Great\r\n      wars are wont to disturb agriculture in such a manner that the price\r\n      of corn is very much increased by them. Hence, it is not\r\n      unfrequently possible to use the prices of grain as a species of\r\n      barometer to determine the real pressure of a war upon the economic\r\n      life of a people. Judging by this standard, England suffered much\r\n      less from the War of the Roses in the fifteenth century, than from\r\n      the civil wars in the seventeenth; and less than France from the\r\n      religious wars of the sixteenth. The war year 1631-2, in which\r\n      Gustavus Adolphus and the emperors had to spare the country, must\r\n      have been far less oppressive for Saxony than the later Swedish\r\n      campaigns. _Roscher_, in the Tübinger Zeitschrift, 1857, 471.\r\n\r\n  787 Most countries go through these successive periods in their corn\r\n      trade: in the first, exportation preponderates; in the second, there\r\n      is an equilibrium; in the third, importation preponderates. (_M.\r\n      Chevalier_, III, 74 ff.) Compare _Tacit._, Ann., XII, 43. Omitting\r\n      the two dearest and the two cheapest years, the Prussian provinces\r\n      were circumstanced as follows:\r\n\r\n      In The Whole Kingdom, the price of Rye, 1816 to 1837, was  40.\r\n      silver groschens.

As to when it may be assumed that the\r\n      price of corn has remained unchanged, see _Hermann_, loc. cit., 125\r\n      ff.\r\n\r\n_  788 Petty_ recommended the average daily food necessarily required by\r\n      one man as the measure of price, estimated on the basis of the\r\n      cheapest means of subsistence. (Polit. Anatomy of Ireland, 62 ff.)\r\n      _Thaer_ used as such a measure the smallest day’s wages; as he\r\n      supposed, expressed in rye, that is, 1/9 of the Prussian _scheffel_.\r\n      Similarly, _Malthus_, in his first edition, and _Buquoy_, Theorie\r\n      der Nationalwirthschaft, 240. But this is simply to substitute for\r\n      wheat an arbitrarily determined quantity and quality of the same as\r\n      a measure of prices. For practical experiments of this kind, made by\r\n      the depreciation of paper money during the French Revolution, see\r\n      _M. Chevalier_, Cours, III, 98; and Constitution de 1795, V, 68, VI,\r\n      173. _Count Soden_, Nat. Œk., II, 338 f., demands that all taxes,\r\n      salaries of state officials etc., should be regulated in accordance\r\n      with the price of corn. This same view has been suggested recently\r\n      in many German States.\r\n\r\n  789 Recognized generally by _Locke_, Considerations 24. Further,\r\n      _Galliani_, Della Moneta, II, 2; _Adam Smith_, I, ch. 5. _Schäffle_,\r\n      N. Œk., II, Aufl., 127, maintains that a constant measure of price,\r\n      such as would enable a person to stipulate for a salary for instance\r\n      that would be always of the same value, is impossible. Similarly,\r\n      _Hildebrand’s_ Jahrb., 1871, 315 ff.\r\n\r\n  790 Compare _J. Tucker_, Four Tracts on political and commercial\r\n      Subjects, 28 ff., who maintains that it is a rule, almost without\r\n      exception, that “operose or complicated manufactures” are cheapest\r\n      in rich countries; “raw materials,” in poor ones. Thus, for\r\n      instance, corn (?), garden products in the former; cattle, wool,\r\n      milk, skins, flesh-meat, in the latter. Ships and movable property\r\n      are cheaper in the former, whereas wood may be said to be almost the\r\n      free product of nature here. See especially _Adam Smith_, Wealth of\r\n      Nations, ch. 11, Digr.\r\n\r\n_  791 Senior_, Outlines 119 f., makes the following calculation: Of the\r\n      15d. which a loaf of bread costs in England, 10d. goes to buy the\r\n      wheat, the other 5d. to the miller, baker etc. If now, we suppose,\r\n      that in consequence of an increased demand, and therefore of\r\n      increased production under more unfavorable circumstances, the price\r\n      of wheat should rise to 20d., the cost of production would possibly,\r\n      because of an improved division of labor, come down to 3-¾d., and\r\n      hence the price of the loaf of bread would be increased to 23-¾d. It\r\n      is quite the reverse in the case of lace, because here a piece of\r\n      raw material worth only 2 shillings may, by reason of the labor\r\n      expended on it, become worth as much as £105. If the consumption of\r\n      lace should increase so that the value of the raw material rose to 4\r\n      shillings, the simultaneous decrease of the cost of manufacture to\r\n      the extent of one-quarter of the aggregate price, would leave the\r\n      price of the manufactured article £78, 19s.\r\n\r\n  792 When, for instance, the inhabitants of the Baltic coasts, by way of\r\n      preference, kept up their relations with the Hanseatic cities, the\r\n      Dutch and English, that is with the most important industrial and\r\n      commercial nations in their own sphere, they in all this pursued\r\n      only their own interest. As to how this intercourse between “old”\r\n      and “new” countries is susceptible of the very highest development,\r\n      see _Torrens_, The Budget: On Commercial and Colonial Policy, 1844,\r\n      and earlier, _Wakefield_, England and America, II, 1823.\r\n\r\n  793 The clearing up of primeval forests, the cultivation of natural\r\n      meadows, etc.\r\n\r\n  794 In Hungary, during the sixteenth century, the choicest venison was\r\n      consumed by plebeians and nobles alike. _Herberstein_, Rer.

Still, in St. Petersburg, wild-fowl game rose between the time\r\n      of Peter the Great and Alexander I. 600 per cent. in price.\r\n      (_Storch_, Handbuch, I, 368.) In Pittsburg, in 1807, mutton, beef\r\n      and veal cost from 4 to 6 cents a pound, and game only from 3 to 4-½\r\n      cents a pound. (_Melish_, Travels through the United States, II,\r\n      57.) The more the game laws are enforced, the longer does the low\r\n      price of game continue, especially when it is not easy for the poor\r\n      to procure them. The moderns have seldom thought of raising game\r\n      artificially; among the Romans, artificial raising was confined to\r\n      the hare and fieldfare. (_Varro_, R.R., III, 12 ff.; _Columella_,\r\n      R.R., VIII, 10.) Hence, the enormous prices paid for game, of which\r\n      _Pliny_, H. N. X., 43, relates an example from the time of the\r\n      emperors. On the other hand, Polybius assures us that, in his time,\r\n      game was to be had as good as gratis in Lusitania. XXXIV, 8, 7.\r\n\r\n  795 In Buenos Ayres, in the nineteenth century, beggars on horseback\r\n      were to be seen. (_Robertson_, Letters on South America, II, 294.)\r\n      In Krasnojarsk, in 1770, 1-½ rubles was the price of an ox, 1 ruble\r\n      of a cow, from 2 to 3 of a horse, from O.3 to O.5 of a sheep; O.15\r\n      of a deer. (_Pallas_, Sibirische Reise, III, 5, II 12.) According to\r\n      the Tables of Prices in _Sir F. M. Eden_, State of the Poor, Append.\r\n      I, and _Rogers_, History of Agriculture and Prices (1866), I, 245,\r\n      361, the following prices obtained in England;\r\n\r\n      (On an average.)\r\n\r\n      in 1125-26, one ox, 1 shilling; one quarter of wheat, 20 shillings;\r\n      in 1260-1400, one ox, 13 shillings 1-¼d; one quarter of wheat, 5\r\n      shillings 10-¾d;\r\n      in 1406, one ox, 9-½ shillings; one quarter of wheat, 4-½\r\n      shillings;\r\n      in 1463, one ox, 10-20 shillings; one quarter of wheat, 1-⅔-4-⅔\r\n      shillings.\r\n\r\n      Compare _Hume_, History of England, a. 1327. Under Henry VIII. veal,\r\n      beef, mutton and pork were food for the poor in England, and cost on\r\n      an average 1-½d per pound; while wheat cost from 7 to 8 shillings a\r\n      quarter. (24 Henry VII, c. 3. _Price_, Observations, II, 148 f.) The\r\n      same appears from the “reasonable prices” which Charles I, in 1663,\r\n      had established by sworn juries viz.: that the different kinds of\r\n      meat were much cheaper comparatively than corn in our days.\r\n      _(Rymer_, Foedera, XIX, 511. _Anderson_, Origin of Commerce, a.\r\n      1633.) In many places in the highlands of Scotland, in the middle of\r\n      the seventeenth century, one pound of oat-bread cost as much or more\r\n      than one pound of the best meat. The union of Scotland with more\r\n      highly civilized England soon changed the relation, so that in _Adam\r\n      Smith’s_ time, good meat, in nearly all parts of Great Britain was\r\n      worth from 2 to 4 times as much as the same weight of wheat bread.\r\n      (Wealth of Nations, I, ch. 11, 1.) The Thomas Hospital in London\r\n      paid, on an average, for good beef per stone weight:\r\n\r\n      1701-1710: 1s. 7.9d.\r\n      1764-1773: 1s. 3.7d.\r\n      1794-1803: 1s. 5.d.\r\n      1804-1821: 1s. 10.9d.\r\n      1822-1842: 1s. 1.5d.\r\n\r\n      (_Porter_, Progress of the Nation, III, 112.) Among the most certain\r\n      proofs of the high degree of economic civilization attained in upper\r\n      Italy about the close of the medieval times is the fact, that the\r\n      price of cattle, compared with that of wheat in the thirteenth and\r\n      fourteenth centuries, varies very little from what it is to-day.\r\n      (_Cibrario_, Economia politica del medio Evo, III, 335-383.) Compare\r\n      _Rau_, Lehrbuch I, § 185. In Athens, the cost of a _medimnos_ of\r\n      wheat was as great as that of a sheep in Solon’s time. In the age of\r\n      Demosthenes, it cost only half as much. (_Böckh_, Staatshaushalt der\r\n      Athener, I, 107, 132.) It is obvious, however, that the price of\r\n      meat compared with that of corn, was lowered by the great extension\r\n      of the artificial cultivation of meadows; for, when the former has\r\n      reached its maximum, it becomes a great spur to the promotion of the\r\n      latter. Thus, in England, the price of meat, at the beginning of the\r\n      sixteenth century, was on an average, higher than in _Adam Smith’s_\r\n      time. (loc. cit.) To the same cause is to be ascribed the state of\r\n      things in Prussia mentioned by _v. Podewils_, Wirth\r\n      schaftserfahrungen, II, 15.\r\n\r\n      As a common basis for such calculations, the following may be\r\n      accepted. It is plain that meadows, pasturages and forage-fields\r\n      must yield as much in meat, as corn-fields of the same dimensions of\r\n      equal goodness, and situated as favorably, in corn. According to\r\n      _Block_, a Prussian acre (_Morgen_) of the best quality, used as a\r\n      meadow, produces a hay-value equal to 1,000 pounds, a clover-value\r\n      equal to 2,420; as a vegetable field, a beet or potato-value equal\r\n      to 6,050-6,930 pounds, _v. Lengerke’s_ estimate is that 110 pounds\r\n      of cattle-fodder expressed in terms of hay, produces on an average\r\n      40 pounds of milk, and from 3-½ to 4 pounds of meat. This would, at\r\n      most, give 36, 88 and 220-252 pounds of meat. The yield of wheat,\r\n      _v. Lengerke_ estimates, on the best soil, and on an average, at 14\r\n      Prussian _scheffels_ (at 80 pounds, i.e. 1,120 pounds) yearly per\r\n      acre (_Morgen_). The three periods in the history of the prices of\r\n      cattle were clearly recognized by _Thaer_, Landw. Gewerblehre, 1815,\r\n      100.\r\n\r\n  796 It is a very characteristic fact, in relation to the river\r\n      fisheries, that the fable that servants formerly stipulated not to\r\n      eat salmon except twice a week is to be found in so many places.\r\n      Thus on the Elbe and the Rhine. Compare _Thaarup_, Dänische\r\n      Statistik, I, 112. In Scotland, about the end of the seventeenth\r\n      century, the story in places ran, that it was five times a week.\r\n      (_Walter Scott_, Old Mortality, ch. 8.) In England, fish seems to\r\n      have been a tid-bit among the poorer classes in the fourteenth\r\n      century. (_Rogers_, I, 606.) It was dearer especially during Lent.\r\n      (Statist. Journ., 1861, 544 ff.) The artificial production of\r\n      sea-fish seems to have been tried only by the ancient Romans. On the\r\n      whole, _Adam Smith’s_ law that a ten-fold demand can, as a rule, be\r\n      met only by a greater than ten-fold labor, applies here. (I, 370,\r\n      ed. Basil.) But this relation is obscured to a certain extent, from\r\n      the fact that the source of the production of sea-fish, the ocean,\r\n      which may be claimed at any time by occupation, is, practically,\r\n      boundless. Here, therefore, the improvements made in nautical\r\n      science, and the progress of geographical knowledge, may yet for a\r\n      long time compensate for the exhaustion of the nearer seas, and even\r\n      more than counterbalance it.\r\n\r\n  797 Among a great many nations in a low stage of civilization,\r\n      agriculture consists in the burning down of the forest. In 1594, the\r\n      Lauenförder forest produced 1,110 thalers’ worth of food for hogs,\r\n      and wood to the amount of 44 thalers. (_v. Berg_,\r\n      Staatsforstwirthsch., 213.) The Harzgerode woods, at the ducal line\r\n      of Anhalt-Bernburg, were estimated at 6,000 thalers. A hundred years\r\n      later, they brought in yearly 70,000 thalers, although, in the\r\n      meantime, very little progress was made in the science of\r\n      cultivating them, (_v. Justi_, Staatswirthschaft, II, 211.) We may\r\n      form a notion of the relativity of the idea of the dearness of wood\r\n      from the fact that in Bavaria, for instance, in 1840, there was a\r\n      great deal of complaint, that in the district of Isark the price\r\n      rose from 6 to 9 florins; in the districts of Regen and the lower\r\n      Maine, from 11 to 14 florins to from 15 to 18; in the Rhine\r\n      district, from 20 to 26 florins per cord (_Klafter_). (_Rau_,\r\n      Lehrbuch, III, § 150, a.) Besides, the price of wood in the forest\r\n      rises, with an advance in civilization, much more rapidly than it\r\n      does in the market; in which last, labor and capital play a greater\r\n      part. (_Rau_, I, § 385.)\r\n\r\n  798 Plan for the artificial production of pearl oysters. (Novara-Reise,\r\n      I, 303.) Ostriches seem now to be ceasing to be objects of mere\r\n      occupation, and to be becoming objects of breeding. (Ausland, 1869,\r\n      § 13.)\r\n\r\n  799 Thus Wolff’s experiments made at Möckern have shown that in the case\r\n      of sheep fed with hay, the wool becomes much heavier and the flesh\r\n      leaner than those of sheep fed with a more concentrated food. While\r\n      it is estimated in England, at the present time, that the wool of\r\n      South-Down sheep is worth scarcely one-tenth what their flesh is\r\n      (_Jacob_, On Corn Trade, 166), mutton, from the year 1260 to 1400,\r\n      was, on an average, worth 17 pence; and this even at a time when\r\n      prices were gradually rising; but the wool of one animal (1 lb., 7-¾\r\n      ounces), 5-¼ pence. (_Rogers_, I, 362, 395.) Even under Anglo-Saxon\r\n      kings the fleece was worth 40 per cent. of the value of the whole\r\n      sheep, (_David Hume_.) And so _W. Macann_, Two Thousand Miles Ride\r\n      through the Argentine Provinces, 1853, I, 151, says that in the\r\n      interior of Buenos Ayres, he purchased 8,000 sheep at 18 pence a\r\n      dozen, and after a march of 200 English miles, sold the skins for\r\n      sixty pence a dozen. In Goya, formerly, a live horse cost 3 pence,\r\n      its skin on the coast 12 pence; and the slaughtering of the beast\r\n      cost 3 pence, the removal and cleaning of the skin 3 pence; and 3\r\n      pence were paid for transportation. (_Robertson_.)\r\n\r\n      In Ireland, in 1763, it not unfrequently happened that the skin and\r\n      tallow of an ox cost as much in a commercial city as the whole ox\r\n      had cost in the nearest market town. (_Temple_, Works III, 13.) In\r\n      England, from 1260 to 1400, the average price of a whole cow was 9s.\r\n      9d.; of the hide 1s. 8d., and cows were cheapest in the first\r\n      decade, i.e., 6s. 2d., and the hides dearer than they were generally\r\n      afterwards, i.e., by from 1-9-¼d. (_Rogers_, I, 361, 451.) In\r\n      Saxony, according to _Engel_ (1853), the average price of horned\r\n      cattle was about 46 thalers; of their hide, 4 thalers and 21 silver\r\n      groschens. Russia exported, 1842-1847, 72,636,166 silver rubles\r\n      worth of tallow, 1,832,137 silver rubles worth of horse hair,\r\n      10,811,735 worth of bristles (_Borsten_), 7,387,140 of uncured\r\n      skins, 36,159,452 of sheep’s wool, but flesh-meat only to the amount\r\n      of 370,362 rubles, and entire animals to the value of 6,853,241\r\n      rubles. (_P. Storch_, Der Bauernstand Russlands, 289 ff.) Tallow is\r\n      there ten times dearer than the same volume of wheat. (_Steinhaus_,\r\n      Russlands industrielle und commercielle Verhältnisse, 294 ff.);\r\n      while in Saxony, according to _Engel_ (1821), a pound of wheat cost\r\n      on an average 7.8 _pfennigs_, and a pound of tallow 30 _p._ However,\r\n      Russia’s recent progress in civilization has had for effect: that\r\n      the exportation of tallow (1833 = 4-½ million _puds_; 1869 = 2-¼\r\n      mill.) has greatly fallen off; while that of butter and live stock\r\n      has increased. (_v. Lengefeld_, R. im 19. Jahrh., 220 ff.)\r\n\r\n      In England, during the fourteenth century, a pound of meat cost, on\r\n      an average, ¼d.; of lard, from 1-½ to 2. (_Rogers_, I, 411.) On the\r\n      other hand, from 1848 to 1856, the average January price of beef\r\n      from America was 110 shillings; of tallow from St. Petersburg, 48s.\r\n      11d. per cwt. (_Newmarch_.) And so, in the time of _Pallas_, the\r\n      Cossacks chased the deer of their steppes only for the sake of its\r\n      skin and horns. (_Pallas_, Reise, III, 524.) While the Greeks got\r\n      horn from Macedonia and Thrace (_Herodot._, VII, 156), it is a\r\n      striking proof of high civilization that at Athens (?), about the\r\n      time of the hundredth Olympiad, an ox-hide was worth only 3\r\n      drachmas, and the whole ox 77 drachmas. (_Böckh_, Staatshaushalt, I,\r\n      105 ff.)\r\n\r\n      As the ox is primarily serviceable as an object of food and an\r\n      instrument of labor, and the sheep on the other hand, only an\r\n      instrument to produce wool, it is easy to understand why, with the\r\n      further advance of civilization, the price of oxen rises\r\n      comparatively much more than the price of sheep. In Athens, during\r\n      the time of Solon, an ox was equal in value to five sheep.\r\n      (_Plutarch_, Solon, 23.) So also in countries with a low\r\n      civilization in the time of Polybius. (_Polyb._, XXXIV, 8; _Gell._,\r\n      XI, 1.) Why the same was the case in Rome at the beginning of the\r\n      Republic? (_Plut._, Popl., 11). In England the proportion between\r\n      the price of an ox and that of a sheep was,\r\n\r\n      in 927 as 6:1 (_Henry_.)\r\n      in 1125 as 3:1\r\n      in 1182 as 6.3:1\r\n      in 1197 as 9:1\r\n      in 1229 as 8:1 (_Eden_.)\r\n      in 1260-1492 (av.) as 9.2:1 (_Rog._)\r\n      in 1497 as 10:1\r\n      in 1500 as 11.6:1\r\n      in 1511 as 8:1\r\n      in 1528 as 10:1\r\n      in 1529 as 12.8:1\r\n      in 1531 as 9.4:1\r\n      in 1551 as 10.6:1\r\n      in 1597 as 8.2:1 (_Eden_.)\r\n\r\n      At present the proportion may be from 10 to 20:1. In Saxony, it is\r\n      as 48 thalers to 5.27. (_Engel_.)\r\n\r\n  800 About 1793, Russia exported 10,000 rubles worth of fish, 452,000 of\r\n      sturgeon bladders, 188,000 of caviar. (_Storch_, Russland, II, 184.)\r\n      But this had undergone a great change even in 1850. At present,\r\n      there are 64 per cent. of sturgeon bladders, 27 of caviar, and 7 of\r\n      whole fish. (_Steinhaus_, Russland’s industrielle und commercielle\r\n      Verhältnisse, 102, 368.) Yet the Astrakan fishermen still throw the\r\n      greater number of the sturgeon they catch back into the water.\r\n      (_Pallas_, Reise im süd. Russland, I, 189; _Steinhaus_, 99.) Salt\r\n      fish are adapted for transportation to a distance not only because\r\n      they can be preserved, but also because they may be caught and\r\n      prepared on the great highway of the water. Athens got from the\r\n      Black Sea besides wood, tar, wool, hides, cordage, honey, wax and\r\n      slaves, also salt fish. (_Wolf_, z. Demosth. Leptin., 252; _Bockh_,\r\n      Staatshaush. I, 51.) The latter from Sardinia, Egypt and Spain.\r\n      (_Pollux_, VI, 48.)\r\n\r\n  801 The principal countries that produce potash are Russia and North\r\n      America. It is estimated that a cwt. of potash requires, on an\r\n      average, 480 cwt. of wood. (_Pfeil_, Grundsätze der Forstwirthsch.\r\n      in Bezug. auf National-Oekon. etc., I, 128.) From 1800 to 1840, wood\r\n      for fuel in Würtemberg trebled its price; for building material the\r\n      price increased 1.6 times. (Deutsche Vierteljahrsschrift, 1847, No.\r\n      4, 104.)\r\n\r\n  802 Whereas barbarous nations take little trouble to turn the milk from\r\n      their cows to account (_Roscher_, Ideen z. Politik und Statistik der\r\n      Ackerbausysteme, Archiv. der politische Œkonomie, neue Folge, III,\r\n      202), _Reuning_, in 1844, calculated that the milk from all the cows\r\n      in Saxony amounts to a value of 10,000,000 thalers, their meat to\r\n      over 2,000,000, and the labor performed by them in various ways to\r\n      3,000,000. In Silesia, in the last decade of the eighteenth century,\r\n      a quart of milk was estimated to be worth 2 _pfennigs_ (Festschrift\r\n      der deutschen Landwirthschaftsversammlung, 1869, 343), whereas as\r\n      now it is sold almost everywhere for 12 _pfennigs_. (_Schmoller_.)\r\n      In the rather high state of civilization which Saxony had reached at\r\n      the end of the sixteenth century, when game was already dear, and\r\n      the prices of other meat were almost as high as in 1800, a _sheffel_\r\n      of rye was worth 44 measures (_Mass._) of milk, and recently 82-⅔\r\n      measures. (_Schmoller_, Tübinger Ztschr., 1871. 336 ff.)\r\n\r\n  803 The principal cheese-producing countries and cities are Holland,\r\n      Limburg, Switzerland, Gloucester, Chester, Ayrshire etc. Compare\r\n      _Roscher_, loc. cit., 195 ff.\r\n\r\n  804 In England, in the year 1000, a cow was worth only as much as two\r\n      sheep. (_Anderson_, Origin of Commerce, a., 979.) The best butter\r\n      was worth only 1d. per pound in 1550, while pork was worth 1-1/8,\r\n      veal and mutton, 1-½, and beef, 2-¼d. The price of butter was\r\n      exceedingly variable in the sixteenth century. (_Eden_.)\r\n\r\n  805 During the middle ages, pork constituted the most usual animal food\r\n      even of the best classes. (_Büsching_, Ritterzeit und Ritterwesen,\r\n      I, 164.) Immense importance attached to pork by the _Lex Salica_.\r\n      (Tit., II, XIV; Emendatt. Caroli Magni, II, 1 ff.) The archbishop of\r\n      Cologne used every day 24 large and 8 medium-sized hogs, and four\r\n      more on the three great festivals. The abbot of Corvey used daily\r\n      five fat and one lean hog, besides two young ones. (_Kindlingen_,\r\n      Münsterische Beitr., Urkunden, 147, 126.) In 1345, at the court of\r\n      Dauphiny, there were used annually for 30 persons, 30 salt and 52\r\n      fresh hogs; whereas, in modern Paris, with 800,000 inhabitants, only\r\n      32,000 hogs are consumed yearly. (_Roquefort_, De la Vie privée des\r\n      Fr., I, 310 f.) Compare herewith the place occupied by the\r\n      swine-herds in the Odyssey in Greece’s age of chivalry. In England,\r\n      in the time of William I., woods were taxed according to the number\r\n      of hogs they might feed. At present, there is an enormous production\r\n      of hogs in Servia, which, in many places, constitutes the only\r\n      source of ready money to the agricultural population.\r\n\r\n      And about the end of the eighteenth century, it is said that Servia\r\n      received from Austria alone 1,300,000 florins yearly for hogs.\r\n      (_Ranke_, Serb. Revolution, 95.) In 1864, Servia’s total exports\r\n      amounted to 62,500,000 piasters, of which 28,162,260 were for hogs,\r\n      7,043,000 for wool, 7,662,000 for the skins of sheep and deer,\r\n      5,732,000 for cattle, 1,222,400 for tallow. (_Kanitz_, Serbien, 598\r\n      ff.) Great production of hogs also in the Moldau and in Wallachia,\r\n      in the United States and Mexico, where, instead of butter, only lard\r\n      and suet are used; also in Lombardy, the Prussian Rhine province,\r\n      Belgium, the English milk-producing districts, Gloucester, Wilt,\r\n      Dumfries, Galloway and the districts where agricultural proletarians\r\n      abound—Ireland and Yorkshire. It is a consequence of the same law\r\n      that, among the South Sea Islanders, the hog was the principal\r\n      domestic animal, as it still is among the Chinese. Similarly in the\r\n      whole of Asia, beyond the Ganges (_Ritter_, Erdkunde, IV, 938,\r\n      1101); in semi-barbarous upper Italy in the time of _Polybios_ (II,\r\n      15); in Gall itself, in the time of Augustus. (_Strabo_, IV, 192,\r\n      197.) The America of the ancient Greeks, Sicily, exported hogs,\r\n      mainly, in the time of Hermippos. (_Athen._, I, 27.) And even among\r\n      the Romans, the consumption of pork was much greater than the\r\n      consumption of beef. (_Marquard-Becker_, Handbuch, V, 2, 39.)\r\n\r\n  806 In the cities of Prussia subject to a tax for the privilege of\r\n      maintaining slaughter houses, a pound of beef cost on an average, in\r\n      1846, from 2 silver groschens, 5 _pfennigs_, to 3 s. gr. 4 pf.;\r\n      pork, from 3 s. gr. 2 pf. to 4 s. gr. 4 pf. (_Dieterici._) In\r\n      Moscow, also, the latter is dearer at present. Before the time of\r\n      Peter the Great, it was cheaper. (_Storch_, Handbuch I, 364.) It was\r\n      a sign of high civilization, too, that in Florence, in the fifteenth\r\n      century, veal cost, on an average, 2-½ soldi; mutton, 2-⅓ soldi; but\r\n      pork, 4 soldi. (_Pagnini_, Saggio sopra il giusto Pregio delle Cose,\r\n      325 f., Cust.) It is especially the lower middle class who ask for\r\n      fat meats. The very fat English sheep are taken not to London, but\r\n      into the manufacturing districts. (_Lauderdale_, Inquiry, 322 f.) As\r\n      to whether the relatively high price of pork, and the fact that in\r\n      the later times of Rome, the wild boar was the most fashionable\r\n      dish, compare _Becker_, Gallus, II, 186.\r\n\r\n  807 The production of fowl is similar in this, that they are frequently\r\n      fed from remains of consumption; only their production is not\r\n      adapted to uncivilized countries, because it is difficult to protect\r\n      them there. In Texas, it is said, it costs more to raise ten\r\n      chickens than to bring up ten children. (_Kennedy_, Czarnkowski’s\r\n      translation, 1846, 115.) The independent breeding of fowl is\r\n      advisable only where there are a great many rich consumers; for the\r\n      reason that they are naturally a delicacy. Enormous production of\r\n      pigeons in Cambridge, Huntington etc. (_McCulloch_, Statistical\r\n      Account, I, 189.) In Paris the consumption of pork and fowl has\r\n      gained somewhat since the Revolution. (_M’Chevalier_, Cours. I,\r\n      113.)\r\n\r\n  808 According to _Schuckburg_, Philosophical Transactions of 1798, and\r\n      _Kraus_, Vermischte Schriften, I, tab. I, the prices of the\r\n      following species of animals rose in England between 1550 and 1795:\r\n      horses, 904 per cent.; oxen, 896 per cent.; sheep, 876 per cent.;\r\n      cows, 2050 per cent.; hogs, 1964 per cent.; geese, 300 per cent.;\r\n      butter rose from 5d. per pound to 11-½d.; beer from 1d. per gallon\r\n      to 2-¾d.; agricultural day wages from ½s. to 1s. 5-¼d.; wheat 326\r\n      per cent. Compare, however, Edinburg Review, III, 246 ff. In Germany\r\n      also, cows and hogs have increased much more in price than horses\r\n      and sheep. (Tübinger Ztschr., 1871, 342.) _Dutot_, Réflexions, 946\r\n      ff., éd. Daire, says that the value of the precious metals in France\r\n      decreased in value between the times of Louis XII. and Louis XV. in\r\n      the ratio of 3-79/91:1. On the other hand, the prices of different\r\n      commodities rise in very different degrees:\r\n\r\n      Fat sheep, from 7 sous to 10 livres.\r\n      Lean sheep, from 5 sous to 5 livres 10 sous.\r\n      Hogs, from 10 sous to 25-35 livres.\r\n      Capons, from 1 sou to 12 sous.\r\n      Hens, from 1-½ sous to 6 sous.\r\n      Pigeons, from 1-½ sous to 3 sous.\r\n      Deer, from 1-½ sous to 15 sous.\r\n\r\n  809 Thus, in Thuringia, the average price in silver of corn from the\r\n      sixteenth century until the period 1848-61 increased in the ratio of\r\n      from 1 to 3-4; the price of the different kinds of animals, on the\r\n      other hand, from 1 to 5-10. (_Knies_, in _Hildebrand’s_ Jahrbb.,\r\n      1863, 78.) The price of the different kinds of corn as compared with\r\n      one another may, however, be modified by many different\r\n      circumstances. Thus the Capitulare Saxoniæ of 797, c., II, estimated\r\n      the prices of rye, barley and oats to be to one another as 30:30:15;\r\n      while the Magdeburg Chamber of 1804 estimated them to be as 17:14:8.\r\n      In the kingdom of Saxony, in 1841-9, the average prices of wheat,\r\n      rye, barley and oats stood to one another in the ratio of\r\n      144:100:75:47 (_Engel_); while, in the middle ages, wheat, rye and\r\n      oats were as 9:6:3 (_Gersdorf_, Cod. Depl. Sax., II, p. XXXIV);\r\n      under Prince August, corn, barley and oats were as 24:22:12.\r\n      Assuming the price of rye to be equal to 100, the cost was:\r\n\r\n      At Brussels, in the 16th century, wheat 126.7, barley 80, oats 50\r\n      At Brussels, in the 17th century, wheat 138.8, barley 82.9, oats\r\n      51.9\r\n      At Brussels, in the 18th century, wheat 147, barley 86.7, oats 55.2\r\n      At Brussels, 1815-1844, wheat 156\r\n      At Brussels, 1841-1850, wheat 153, barley 82.7, oats 51\r\n      At Berlin, 1789-1818, wheat 135, barley 74.8, oats 54\r\n      At Berlin, 1819-1832, wheat 143.5, barley 74.9, oats 52\r\n\r\n      (_Rau_, Lehrbuch, I, § 183.) To understand this, it is necessary to\r\n      bear in mind the relatively great increase of wheat bread, beer made\r\n      of barley, and horses, as objects of luxury. The unusually low price\r\n      of oats in North America, as compared with the price of wheat, is\r\n      dependent on the facility of exporting the latter. In Florence, in\r\n      the fifteenth century, the price of wheat was 22-⅔, of rye, 12, of\r\n      barley, 8 _soldi_. (_Pagnini_, Sopra il giusto Pregio delle Cose,\r\n      325.)\r\n\r\n  810 The English so called custom-house prices (_Zollhauspreise_)\r\n      correspond to the market prices of 1696. If these are assumed = 100,\r\n      the price\r\n\r\n      Of steel and iron was, in 1826, 83, in 1831, 56\r\n      Of coal was, in 1826, 47, in 1831, 45\r\n\r\n      Between 1835 and 1850, Scotch iron had already become cheaper by\r\n      one-half (_Meidinger_, 387), and coal in London by one-third\r\n      (_Porter_).\r\n\r\n_  811 Rogers_, History of Agriculture, I, 67.\r\n\r\n  812 In England, in 1172, an ox cost 2 shillings; in 1175, green cloth\r\n      cost per ell, 2-10/12 shillings; red cloth, 5-½ shillings. (_Eden._)\r\n      In the western states of North America, the farmer gives two pounds\r\n      of coarse wool for one pound of woolen yarn; he sends 4 bushels of\r\n      wheat to the miller for the flour of three bushels (Ausland, 1843,\r\n      No. 68), while in Ravenna, in the thirteenth century, the miller’s\r\n      fee was 1/10 (_von Raumer_, Hohenstaufen II, 437); according to the\r\n      fixed prices in _Fantazzi_, (Monumen. Ravennet.); in Germany, during\r\n      the last centuries of the middle ages, 1/8 (_J. Grimm_, Weisthümer,\r\n      III, 8); at the end of the sixteenth century from 1/8 to 1/5\r\n      (_Coler_, Oeconomia, II, 3); in modern Germany, generally 1/16 of\r\n      the raw material, and in the steppes of southern Russia, when the\r\n      wind is still, in summer, even the half. (Mitth. der freien ökonom.\r\n      Gesellsch. zu Petersburg, 1853, 85.) In Guiana, in 1806, a very\r\n      ordinary saddle and bridle could not be had under 10-½ guineas.\r\n      (_Pinckard_, Notes on the West Indies, III, 1806.) _Count Görtz_ was\r\n      obliged to pay 2 dollars, in Demarara, for the cleansing of a rifle,\r\n      and another person for the oiling of a carriage, 5 dollars. (Reise\r\n      um die Welt, 1864, 327.) A lady’s dress in Mobile costs four times\r\n      as much as in London or Paris. (_Ch. Lyell_, Second Visit to the\r\n      United States, II, 70.) In Athens, articles of clothing, even for\r\n      the poorer classes, were never as cheap as they are in civilized\r\n      countries to-day. (Compare _Plutarch_, De Tranquill. Anim., 10.)\r\n\r\n  813 In Upper Italy, between 1261 and 1400, a lady’s chemise and the\r\n      making of it cost 14.77 lire; Rheims linen, 7.04; ordinary mourning\r\n      cloth, O.45; black cloth from Moriana, 2.83; cloth from Mecheln,\r\n      43.83; from Ypres, 47.04; scarlet cloth, 80.44 per ell. (_Cibrario_,\r\n      1. 1.) On the other hand, to-day, in the Leipzig market, the\r\n      difference in price of the dearest and of the cheapest cloth will\r\n      scarcely surpass the ratio 18:1. Even _Scaruffi_, Sulle Moneta,\r\n      1679, 163, Cust, remarks that hemp-linen and similar coarse articles\r\n      had increased much more in price than brocades; but he ascribes this\r\n      circumstance to the disordered state of the coinage.

In Turin, in the fourteenth century, 1 pound of\r\n      pepper was equal in value to 28 pounds of salt. (_Cibrario_, III,\r\n      359, 362.) As late as the middle of the fifteenth century, the court\r\n      of Duke William of Saxony paid for one pound of sugar 1 thaler and 8\r\n      groschens, while ducal fees paid to servants and workmen seldom\r\n      exceeded 2 gr. Hence, even at a princely meal, often scarcely ½ a\r\n      pound was consumed.

According to _Pliny_, H. N.\r\n      XXIX, 5, the Roman _principes_ gave the most distinguished doctors\r\n      yearly 250,000 sesterces, and even more as an honorarium. At the end\r\n      of the eighteenth century, the greatest Parisian actors received\r\n      from 4,000 to 5,000 francs per annum. Now 100,000 is considered a\r\n      moderate income for one. (Journ. des Economistes, May, 1854, 279.)\r\n      It is said that Frederick Hase earned $30,000 in America in ten\r\n      weeks. (Leipz.

And the principle above\r\n      mentioned applies only in so far as the supply is here an unlimited\r\n      and there a limited one. Hence, the comparison of silver with\r\n      painters’ and sculptors’ works is not an apposite one—in the case of\r\n      these there is a natural monopoly, while the former, on account of\r\n      its durability and capacity for transportation, may, on the\r\n      contrary, be increased almost at pleasure.\r\n\r\n  820 Besides _Böckh._, Staatshaushalt der Athener, 1817, Book I, compare\r\n      _Arbuthnot_, Tables of ancient Coins, Weights and Measures, 2d ed.,\r\n      1754, _Reitmeyer_, Ueber den Bergbau der Alten, 1785, and Michaelis,\r\n      De Pretiis Rerum apud veteros Hebræos, in the Comment.

The average in the time of George IV., per\r\n      annum, was 4,262,652 (_Jacob_, ch. IV.) An evidence of the\r\n      uncertainty of the history of prices in the middle ages is, that\r\n      _Jacob_, ch. 12, infers, from the price of corn, that the price of\r\n      silver remained rather stationary from 1120 to 1550, while _Adam\r\n      Smith_, I, ch. 11, 3, infers from the same fact, a remarkable rise\r\n      in the price of silver from 1350 to 1570. Concerning the latter, see\r\n      _Leber_, Fortune privée au moyen Age, 16 f. _Tooke-Newmarch_,\r\n      History of Prices, VI, 391; whereas _Rogers_, Statist. Journ., 1861,\r\n      544 ff., finds that in England, between 1300 and 1532, there was no\r\n      change whatever in the price of silver. According to _Soetbeer_,\r\n      Forschungen zur deutschen Geschichte, VI, 94, wheat and rye were, as\r\n      compared with silver, worth during the Carolingian period, about\r\n      one-fourth of its value, between 1750 and 1850. _Hegel_, Shassburger\r\n      Chroniken, II, 1012, ascribes to gold over 2½ times as great a\r\n      purchasing power in the 13th and 14th centuries as in the 19th\r\n      century; and to silver, a purchasing power about three times as\r\n      great.\r\n\r\n  829 The silver ores of Peru and Mexico yield, on an average, only from 2\r\n      to 3 per 1,000 of metal; those of Potosi, at present, scarcely 1 per\r\n      1,000; those of Mexico, according to _Humboldt_, on an average, from\r\n      3 to 4 ounces per cwt.; so that many of the European ores are\r\n      decidedly richer. While the veins of the Saxon mine, Himmelsfürst,\r\n      have a breadth of only from 0.2 to 0.3 meters; the Veta-Madre of\r\n      Guanaxuato, is in few parts less than 8, and it is sometimes even 50\r\n      meters broad; and the Veta-Grade of Zacatecas is from 5 to 10 meters\r\n      in breadth. In Pasco there are veins of silver ore which have 114\r\n      and even 123 meters. _Tschudi_, Reise in Peru, K., 12; _Chevalier_,\r\n      Cours, III, 184 ff., 241 ff. According to _Humboldt_, Essai sur la\r\n      Nouvelle Espagne, III, p. 413, eleven times as many miners are\r\n      needed at Himmelsfürst as at Valenciana to obtain the same quantity\r\n      of silver.\r\n\r\n  830 Thus, for instance, the celebrated ransom-money of Athahualpa (even\r\n      according to _Garcilaso de la Vega_) amounted to only 5,000,000\r\n      thalers, while the French King John, after the battle of Poitiers,\r\n      in 1356, had to pay 41,000,000 francs for his ransom.

Their aggregate yield,\r\n      between 1814 and 1861, not taking into account the amount embezzled,\r\n      amounted to 37,000 _puds_, the _pud_ being equal to 16.3\r\n      kilogrammes. The best year, 1847, gave a yield of 1,757 _puds_;\r\n      1852-1861, an average of 1,556 _puds_; 1861 alone, 1,442 _puds_, of\r\n      which 1,041 came from the private Siberian gold-sand washings.\r\n      (_Walcker_, in Faucher’s Vierleljahrsschrift, 1869, II, 115.)\r\n\r\n  841 Spanish silver production yielded, in 1845, over 184,000 marks; in\r\n      1850, over 291,000.

(_M.

Up to 1803, there was produced in America, 9,915,000\r\n      marks (Spanish) of gold, and 512,700,000 of silver. (N.E., 245.)\r\n      _Gallatin_ estimates that, before Columbus, there were 1,600,000,000\r\n      francs; in 1830, in Europe and America, from 22,000,000,000 to\r\n      27,000,000,000 francs. (Considerations on the Currency and Banking\r\n      System of the United States, 1831.) According to _M. Chevalier_,\r\n      1850, all the silver which America produced had a volume of only\r\n      11,657 cubic meters; and all the gold of only 151 cubic meters. The\r\n      latter, therefore, would not even fill the half of a French\r\n      gentleman’s _salon_.\r\n\r\n  845 All the more in favor with governments because they affect\r\n      principally foreign consumers. Thus, the Spanish government at first\r\n      imposed a tax of 50 per cent. of the gross yield of the raw\r\n      material, on the purchaser of silver; since 1503, under Orando, of\r\n      33-⅓ per cent.; and later yet, of 20 per cent. This last tax was\r\n      therefore in full force under Cortes. This tax was reduced in\r\n      Mexico, in 1725, and in Peru in 1736, to 10 per cent., and later, in\r\n      the case of gold, to 3 per cent.

Similarly of _David Hume_, On\r\n      Money. According to _Letronne_, Considérations sur l’Evaluation des\r\n      Monnaies Grecques et romaines, 119, and _Böckh_, Staatshaushalt, I,\r\n      88, the average value of wheat in relation to silver was, in Athens,\r\n      400 B.C., as 1:3146; in Rome, 50 B.C., as 1:2681; in France, shortly\r\n      before 1520 after Christ, as 1:4320; in the nineteenth century it is\r\n      as 1:1050. _Th. Smith_, De Republ. Anglorum, I, assumes that the\r\n      price of silver, from the age of chivalry to 1625, decreased in the\r\n      ratio of 120:40. The Spaniard, _Moncado_ (1619), says as 6:1.\r\n      (_Jacob_, ch. 19.) _Jacob_, himself, in comparison with his own\r\n      time, as 7:1 (ch. 15.) Much more moderate is _Newmarch_ in _Tooke’s_\r\n      History of Prices, VI, 345 ff., who assumes an increase in the\r\n      prices of commodities of about 200 per cent.

According to\r\n      _Rogers_, the prices of corn in relation to silver were from 1596 to\r\n      1636, at most 2.3 times as high as from 1260 to 1400; from 1637 to\r\n      1700, 2.6 times; from 1701 to 1764, 2.1 times; from 1726 to 1820,\r\n      3.2 times. (_Rogers_, I, 180.)\r\n\r\n  848 In Germany, the rise in prices was first observed in the price of\r\n      foreign groceries, which partly rose 400 per cent. Popular opinion\r\n      looked for the cause in the evil disposition of the large commercial\r\n      houses. In order to facilitate the competition of the smaller houses\r\n      with the larger, the Reichstag, in 1522, prohibited all companies\r\n      with a capital of more than 50,000 florins; and, in 1524, the royal\r\n      treasury wished to bring suit against the violators of this law. But\r\n      the cities contrived to avert the blow. (_L. Ranke_, Geschichte der\r\n      Reformation, II, 42 ff., 134 ff.) In Spain, the government,\r\n      especially between 1550 and 1560, endeavored to oppose the growing\r\n      dearness of goods of all kinds, by prohibiting the exportation of\r\n      the most important commodities, and by putting obstacles in the way\r\n      of retail trade. The lower classes in England ascribed the rise to\r\n      the suppression of the monasteries (_Percy_, Reliques of ancient\r\n      Poetry, II, 296), while Henry VIII. endeavored to improve the\r\n      condition of things by laws against luxury, the governmental\r\n      establishment of fixed prices, the expulsion of foreign merchants\r\n      etc. (21 Henry VIII.) The first writer who seems to have clearly\r\n      seen the true cause of the changes in price was _Bodinus_, Response\r\n      aux Paradoxes de Mr. de Malestroit touchant l’Enchérissement de\r\n      toutes Choses et des Monnaies (1568). This work was translated into\r\n      Latin by _H. Conring_, 1671; and done over in the work: Discours sur\r\n      les Causes de l’extrême Cherté, qui est aujourd’hui en France\r\n      (1574). Next, we have the English author _W. S._, A Compendious or\r\n      briefe Examination of certayne ordinary Complaints of divers of our\r\n      Countrymen of these our Days, London, 1581. In _Befold’s_ Vitæ et\r\n      Mortis Consideratio politica, 1623, 13 f., we have a right\r\n      explanation of the _caritas sine inopia_ which is to be considered\r\n      as the common property of his time.\r\n\r\n  849 Similarly _Quesnay_, 77, Daire. _Sir J.

In Turin, from\r\n      1825 to 1835, it was worth about 1702 gr. In the fifteenth century\r\n      even, the foreign embassadors complain of the enormous cost of\r\n      living there. So, for instance, _Raumer’s_ histor. Taschenbuch,\r\n      1833, 162. Compare also, _Carli_, Del Valore della Proporzione dei\r\n      Metalli monetati con i Generi in Italia prima delle Scoperte dell’\r\n      Indie, 1760, in which he, indeed, exaggerates the matter, and seeks\r\n      to prove his views by the coarsest sophistry.\r\n\r\n  851 The chief result of _Helferich’s_ excellent researches.\r\n      (_Helferich_, loc. cit.) The general opinion, indeed, is that this\r\n      _statu quo_ of the value of the precious metals was interrupted\r\n      about the middle of the eighteenth century by another decline, and\r\n      that the latter yielded to a subsequent rise in 1815 and afterwards.\r\n      Thus _David Hume_, History of England, ch. 44, App. 31, ch. 49, App.\r\n      A. _Young_, Political Arithmetics, ch. 6.

One of the\r\n      principal advocates of the opinion that every increase made in the\r\n      medium of circulation produces a corresponding depreciation is\r\n      _Nebenius_, Deutsche Vierteljahrsschrift (1841). In England a\r\n      quarter of wheat was worth, on an average, 38s. 8/9d., from 1595 to\r\n      1685. On a similar stability of corn prices in Belgium, see\r\n      _Schwerz_, Belgische Landwirthschaft, III, 37. According to Suckburg\r\n      (l.c.), the value in exchange of money from 1640 to 1700 declined\r\n      32-2/9 per cent.; from 1700 to 1760, 43 per cent.; from 1760 to\r\n      1806, 84 per cent.\r\n\r\n  852 From 1637 to 1700 the price of corn in England averaged 51\r\n      shillings; from 1701 to 1764 only 40½ shillings.\r\n\r\n  853 Thus, the dearness of wheat in Germany, during the first thirty\r\n      years after the Thirty Years’ War was caused, in large part, by the\r\n      depopulation produced by the War.\r\n\r\n  854 In Germany, also, the cause of the enhanced dearness of so many\r\n      goods during the Thirty Years’ War is to be sought for in the goods\r\n      themselves.\r\n\r\n  855 Since 1815, most Birmingham and Sheffield wares have fallen from 50\r\n      to 70 or 80 per cent. in price—at least from 20 to 30. (_McCulloch_,\r\n      Statist. Account, I, 705.) The Quarterly Review, May, 1830, speaks\r\n      even of an average decline of prices of English commodities in\r\n      general, of 50 per cent.\r\n\r\n  856 Excellently carried out in _Tooke_, History of Prices, III, 1838.\r\n      That the world’s market is not so very readily affected by an\r\n      increase of the medium of circulation, is established by this fact,\r\n      among others, that the immense exportation of French metallic money\r\n      in consequence of the issue of paper money between 1716 and 1720,\r\n      and again in 1790 and the following years, is coincident with very\r\n      low prices of wheat in the neighboring countries. (_Helferich_, loc.\r\n      cit., 139, 190 ff.) And yet, in the former case, the amount was\r\n      400,000,000 francs, and in the latter, at least 1,000,000.\r\n\r\n_  857 Jacob_ estimates this part at only 2-½ per cent., _McCulloch_, at\r\n      20, _Lowe_ at 25, _Necker_ and _Helferich_ at 50, _Humboldt_ at 66-⅔\r\n      of the whole quantity worked. It certainly is, in our day, on\r\n      account of the ever growing aggregate supply, greater than hitherto;\r\n      but it is very different in different countries. _Nebenius_,\r\n      Deutsche Vierteljahrsschrift, 1851, 56 seq., estimates the aggregate\r\n      consumption of new gold and silver for industrial purposes at 14-½\r\n      piasters yearly, and in addition to this seven millions of old gold\r\n      and silver (_Bruchgold und Bruchsilber_). The annual wear and tear\r\n      of previously existing articles of gold and silver, it is estimated,\r\n      amounts to 4,420,000 piasters (1/420); the annual increase of their\r\n      aggregate amounts in Europe to 6,000,000 piasters (1-½ per cent.,\r\n      corresponding to the increase of population), and 4,200,000\r\n      (one-fifth of the entire consumption), is employed, as he claims, in\r\n      gilding, plating etc. The last item is probably much increased by\r\n      galvanic silver-plating, the invention of photography etc.\r\n\r\n_  858 Jacob_ embraces in the amount of metal employed in industrial\r\n      purposes, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, 1/5 of the\r\n      amount which, after deducting the loss in Asiastic trade, was added\r\n      to the gold and silver stores of Europe; i.e., in the seventeenth\r\n      century, about 2,500,000 piasters yearly; in the eighteenth century,\r\n      ⅔ (!); that is, annually, 15,000,000 piasters; in 1830, in England,\r\n      £2,457,221; in France, 120,000; Switzerland, 350,000; in the rest of\r\n      Europe, 1,605,490; in North America, about 300,000; altogether,\r\n      £5,900,000. _Humboldt’s_ estimate is 21,000,000 piasters;\r\n      _McCulloch’s_, £6,050,000. According to the records of the Paris\r\n      _Monnaie_, the amount of silver ware in France increased seven fold\r\n      between 1709 and 1759. (_Humboldt_.) In England, between 1807 and\r\n      1814, 8,290,000 ounces of silver were stamped for manufacturing\r\n      purposes, from 1830 to 1837, only 7,387,000; in 1851, 924,000.\r\n      _McCulloch_ estimates the annual consumption of silver, in\r\n      Birmingham alone, for plating purposes, at 150,000 ounces; in\r\n      Sheffield, at 500,000; and the gold consumption in the pottery\r\n      districts at £650 per week. Birmingham consumed (1831) for gilding\r\n      purposes, £1,000 gold yearly. (_Whately._) It now employs weekly\r\n      3,000 ounces of gold and 6,000 ounces of silver in the manufacture\r\n      of gold and silver ware, besides the quantity intended for gilding\r\n      and silver-washing purposes. (Quart. Rev., April, 1866, 381.) The\r\n      jewelers of New York manufacture yearly 3,000,000 of dollars worth\r\n      of gold and silver ware, mostly new material. (Economist, April 16,\r\n      1853.) There were in Vienna, in 1781, only 167 workers in gold and\r\n      silver; in 1840, 229; in 1847, 539. (_Baumgartner_, in the Wiener\r\n      Akademie, May 3, 1857.) _Jacob_ estimates the aggregate mass of gold\r\n      and silver ware, in plate, instruments etc., in Europe and America,\r\n      to be 1-¼ as great as that of the ready money; and in England alone\r\n      to be twice as great (ch. 28); while _Tengoborski_ thinks that at\r\n      the beginning of the nineteenth century, the coin constituted ⅔ of\r\n      the entire amount of the precious metals. Sometimes a movement in\r\n      the opposite direction takes place, as, for instance, in those\r\n      revolutions in which the silver of the church was confiscated; in\r\n      the unfortunate wars of Louis XIV., etc. _Nebenius_, loc. cit., 17,\r\n      mentions a South German silversmith who melted down in the years\r\n      succeeding 1802, monastery silver to the amount of 11,000,000\r\n      guldens.\r\n\r\n  859 On the wear and tear of coin, see § 120, and _Hermann_, in the\r\n      Archiv. der politischen Oek., I, 1841. Compare also, _Faust_,\r\n      Concilia pro Aerario, 1641, 263 ff. This wear and tear is so great\r\n      that _M. Chevalier_ supposes that it alone would suffice to reduce\r\n      an amount of money under Constantine the Great of 5,000 millions to\r\n      300 millions, in the time of Philip IV. (ob. 1314.) Cours, II, 322.\r\n      How great a number of coins, especially of the smaller\r\n      denominations, are entirely lost is evident from the fact, that at\r\n      the time of the demonetization of the 15-sous and 30-sous pieces of\r\n      1791-92, amounting to 25,000,000, only 16,000,000 were presented for\r\n      redemption. Of the 10-centime pieces stamped with an N, amounting to\r\n      3,286,932 francs, there were only 2,000,000 left when they were\r\n      withdrawn from circulation, and this although individuals had added\r\n      to the coinage. (_M. Chevalier_, III, 321.) The total loss caused on\r\n      this score, _McCulloch_ estimates at 1 per cent. per annum, and\r\n      _Helferich_, at ¾ per cent. The greater the aggregate stock of gold\r\n      and silver, the greater the absolute amount of wear and tear. If,\r\n      therefore, there were annually an equal influx of mineral products\r\n      to the markets, the pressure of this increase of supply from that\r\n      cause alone would take the shape of a converging series of prices.\r\n      (_Tooke_, History of Prices, II, 151 ff.)\r\n\r\n  860 The British East India Company exported gold and silver on an\r\n      average per annum from:\r\n\r\n      1711-1720, £434,000\r\n      1721-1730, 532,000\r\n      1731-1740, 487,000\r\n      1741-1750, 631,000\r\n      1751-1760, 571,000\r\n      1761-1770, 152,000\r\n      1771-1780, 43,000\r\n      1781-1790, 393,000\r\n      1791-1800, 352,000\r\n      1801-1807, 852,000\r\n\r\n      _Milburn_, Oriental Commerce, 1813, 419. According to _M.\r\n      Chevalier_, Introduction aux Rapports de l’Exposition de 1867, the\r\n      trade of Europe and North America, with India, China, Japan and the\r\n      Australian islands, amounted in 1800, to only 410 million francs, in\r\n      1866, to 4,024 million. Yet, for a time, the largely increased\r\n      exportation of English manufactures to East India and of East Indian\r\n      opium to China, had changed the relation so that the exportation of\r\n      the precious metals from South Asia, by a great deal, more than\r\n      counterbalanced the imports. On the other hand, between 1853 and\r\n      1856 240,000,000 thalers were shipped to India and China from\r\n      England and the Mediterranean harbors; in 1863 and 1864, even as\r\n      much as 300 millions, to be, for the most part, buried there.\r\n      Moreover, the immense quantity of cash money—often as much as from\r\n      12 to 15 million in pounds sterling—in the state treasury, and\r\n      silver ornaments (§§ 44, 123) customary in India, demand a\r\n      considerable yearly supply to make up for wear. _Newmarch_ speaks of\r\n      400 million pounds sterling which can be maintained in its condition\r\n      hitherto by a yearly increase of 1 per cent. (History of Prices, VI,\r\n      723.) From 1865 to 1869, English steamships carried gold and silver\r\n      to the East in the following quantities, yearly: 93.9, 66.3, 24.6,\r\n      70.2 and 60.4 million thalers, in addition to which almost as much\r\n      came directly from California. Statist. Journ., 1871, 122 seq.\r\n\r\n_  861 Tooke-Newmarch_, History of Prices, VI, 147 ff., estimates the\r\n      aggregate stock of gold at the end of 1848 at £5,600,000; in 1856,\r\n      at £172,000,000 more. According to _Lavasseur_, the amount of silver\r\n      in the East increased, between 1848 and 1857, from 22 to 24\r\n      milliards of francs; and the amount of gold from 9-½ to 15-½\r\n      milliards. (Annuarie d’Economie politique, 1858, 632.) The total\r\n      amount of gold and silver in the civilized world, _Wolowski_\r\n      estimated at from 55 to 60 milliards of francs, in 1870. (L’Or et\r\n      l’Argent, Enquête, 19.) Compare _Mason_, The Gold Regions of\r\n      California from the Official Reports, 1848. _Tengoborski_, Sur les\r\n      Gîtes aurifères de la Californie et de l’Australie, 1853.\r\n      Goldfield’s Statistics issued from the Mining Department in\r\n      Victoria, 1862. _W. R. Blake_, The Production of the precious\r\n      Metals, or statist. Notice of the principal Gold and Silver\r\n      producing Regions of the World (New York, 1869).\r\n\r\n_  862 Soetbeer’s_ Denkschrift betr. die deutsche Münzeinigung Mai, 1869,\r\n      and earlier yet, in _Faucher’s_ Vierteljahrsschrift, 1865, II.\r\n      According to _M. Chevalier_, all the mines of the world, a short\r\n      time previous to 1865, produced 284,000 kilogrammes of gold, and\r\n      190,000 kilogrammes of silver in a year: a total of 373,000 thalers\r\n      (Journal des Economistes, June, 1866), while, in 1848, the total\r\n      amount of gold coinage in the world was estimated at 560,000,000;\r\n      Great Britain, France, North America and Sidney had, since that time\r\n      and up to 1871, added to this £597,780,000. The additions have been\r\n      made in decreasing quantities: thus, 1857-59, 37.2 millions\r\n      annually; 1869-71, 16.99 millions annually. (Statist. Journ., 1872,\r\n      376 ff.) The estimates as to how much a gold-digger might make in a\r\n      day have been variously estimated. Thus, _Larkin_ estimates it from\r\n      $25 to $50; _Mason_, at $10; _Folson_, at $25 to $40; _Butler King_,\r\n      at $16, reckoning one ounce at $16. All these estimates seem to give\r\n      an altogether too high average. In Australia, according to _Khull_,\r\n      Colonial Review, June, 1853, a digger can produce only one ounce\r\n      daily, or less than 4 thalers. According to _W. Stamer_,\r\n      Recollections of a Life of Adventure, II, 1866, a gold-washer in\r\n      Victoria earned in 1858, on an average, £250 per year; in 1865, only\r\n      £70; while day labor was worth 15 shillings. Hence, great hopes have\r\n      to be built on the lottery-nature of gold-washing. On the Rhine, a\r\n      gold-washer is satisfied with ⅔ of a gramme of gold, that is worth\r\n      from 13 to 18 silver groschens. (_Daubrée_, Comptes rendus de l’\r\n      Académie des Sciences, XXII, 639.) It should be borne in mind,\r\n      however, that the Rhine-lander devotes to gold-washing only the\r\n      leisure time which his avocation as a fisherman leaves him, while\r\n      the gold-washer in the new world, as a rule, devotes his whole time\r\n      to it; and that his labors are interrupted by the long rainy season,\r\n      attacks of fever etc. To this must be added the great difference of\r\n      the average prices of the means of subsistence and the difference of\r\n      all social conditions.\r\n\r\n  863 Compare, for instance, on the early productiveness of the Brazilian\r\n      gold districts which soon ceased: _Spix und Martius_, Reise nach\r\n      Brasilien, I, 262 f., 350. _Gardner_, Travels in the Interior of\r\n      Brazil, 1846. On Hispaniola, see _Benzoni_, N. Mundo, I, 61, and\r\n      _Peschel_, Gesch. der Entdeckungen, 304, 556. Hitherto, gold had\r\n      been obtained by the usual mining process, only in very few places.\r\n      As a rule, it has been found in alluvial land not far from the\r\n      surface. Compare _Ansted_, The Gold-Seekers’ Manual, 1849. These\r\n      circumstances have made the production of gold important from the\r\n      first; and they still make it comparatively easy, while it causes\r\n      little demand for capital but for great skill. As soon, therefore,\r\n      as the greater part of the country washed for gold has been worked,\r\n      which does not require a long time, the whole is abandoned, while in\r\n      the production of silver the great amount of capital fixed in pits,\r\n      shafts, kilns etc. ties the parties engaged in the enterprise to the\r\n      spot, and necessitates the continuation of the enterprise. In recent\r\n      times, however, Australia and California have developed the mining\r\n      and machine production of gold to a surprising extent. According to\r\n      _Laur_, La Production des Métaux précieux en Californie, 1862, 33,\r\n      and the Journal des Economistes, Nov. 1862, Californian gold-quartz\r\n      produced, in 1851, on an average, 635 francs per ton; in 1860, only\r\n      from 80 to 85 francs; but the gold-washing methods have become\r\n      cheaper in the ratio of 2,500:1. However, the production of the\r\n      precious metals seems even now to be decreasing. According to the\r\n      Statist. Journal, 1866, 99, it amounted on an average to:\r\n\r\n      in 1849-51, gold £23.9 million, silver £15.5 million.\r\n      in 1852-56, gold 38.7 million, silver 16.1 million.\r\n      in 1857-59, gold 36.5 million, silver 17.1 million.\r\n      in 1860-63, gold 33.5 million, silver 18.2 million.\r\n      in 1864-68, gold 30.0 million, silver 19.5 million.\r\n\r\n      The number of gold-diggers in Victoria steadily decreased from\r\n      125,764 in 1857, to 63,053 in 1867.\r\n\r\n  864 One of the chief difficulties in the way of the production of gold\r\n      is the loss by embezzlement, which is estimated at an average of 20\r\n      per cent. Small companies of men working on their own account would\r\n      be less exposed to temptation, and the Anglo-Saxon races and the\r\n      North Americans are very well adapted thereto. (_M. Chevalier_, III,\r\n      261.)\r\n\r\n  865 Gold is in a certain sense one of the most widespread of metals,\r\n      although it is found anywhere only in small quantities; so that on\r\n      the Rhine, for instance, it takes from 17 to 22 millions of gold\r\n      grains to make a kilogramme. An extraordinary large number of places\r\n      owe their civilization to gold-seekers. Compare _Tacitus_, Agr., 12.\r\n      I select the following “finds” from _Ritter’s_ Erdkunde. The\r\n      Shangallas (I, 249); still more the terrace of Fazoglu itself (I,\r\n      253, compare _Bruce_, Travels, V, 316, VI, 255, 342), in Monomotapa\r\n      (I, 140); in Manica, west from Sofala (I, 145), especially since the\r\n      suppression of the slave trade (I, 305, 471); in Mandigo land (I,\r\n      360, 372); on the road from Gambia to Timbuctoo (I, 457); on Lake\r\n      Mangara (I, 493); between Timbuctoo and Finnin (I, 445); in Nubia\r\n      (I, 667, seq.); unused silver and quicksilver mines on the lower\r\n      Bagradas (I, 493); gold wealth at Malacca, _aurea chersonesus_ (V, 6\r\n      f., 27); Tonkin, Lao and Ava (III, 926, 1, 216, IV, I, 213); Assam\r\n      (IV, 294); smaller Thibet (III, 657); Kashmere (III, 1,155); on\r\n      upper Setledsch (III, 654 ff., 668); in the mountainous sources of\r\n      the Indus (III, 508, 529, 593, 608); on the Cabool (VII, 23); in\r\n      Peshaver (VII, 223); Badakschan (VII, 795); rich silver mines\r\n      abandoned for want of wood near Herat (VIII, 243); in Armenia (X,\r\n      273). It is said that in southern China there are great treasures of\r\n      the precious metals, the removal of which has been opposed thus far.\r\n      (IV, 756.) Arabia’s richness in gold mines, spoken of by _Diodor._,\r\n      II, 50, III, 45, and _Agatharch_, De Mare rubro, 60, is of doubtful\r\n      existence, as no traces of them are to be found in the country\r\n      to-day. On the other hand, on both shores of the Pacific Ocean, the\r\n      portions of the earth richest in volcanoes seem to possess almost\r\n      everywhere quantities of gold equal to those of California and\r\n      Victoria. (Edinburgh Review, Jan., 1863, 82 ff.) What an amount of\r\n      treasure can be obtained at times from old and long since forgotten\r\n      “finds” is proved by the Altai (that is gold mountain), which even\r\n      the old Tschudi had rummaged (_K. Ritter_, II); and where Herodotus’\r\n      (III, 16) love of truth, so frequently called in question, has\r\n      recently been so brilliantly vindicated. Compare _v.\r\n      Ungern-Sternberg_, Gesch. des Goldes, 1835. _A. Erman_, Ueber die\r\n      geographische Verbreitung des Goldes, 1835. According to\r\n      _Murchison_, Siberia, ch. 17, gold is to be found only “in\r\n      crystalline and paleozoic rocks, or in the drift from these rocks,\r\n      which is a tertiary accumulation of the pliocene age;” and that it\r\n      is found most abundantly “in quartz-ore, vein-stones and traverse\r\n      altered Silurian slates, chiefly lower Silurian, frequently near\r\n      their junction with eruptive rocks.”\r\n\r\n  866 Compare _Humboldt_, N. Espagne, IV, 147 ff.; _St. Clair Duport_,\r\n      Essai sur la Production des Metaux précieux en Mexique, 1843; _M.\r\n      Chevalier_, Cours., III, 483 ff.\r\n\r\n  867 The cost of a kilogramme of silver, expressed in terms of silver\r\n      itself, up to the moment that it is shipped, is estimated by\r\n      _Duport_ as follows: salt and _magistral_, 61 grammes; quicksilver,\r\n      112 grammes; stamping it, 171 grammes; transformation of the ore, 72\r\n      grammes; rent and superintendence, 38; duties etc., 145; smelting,\r\n      transportation and shipping, 35. There remains as profit for mining\r\n      it, 336 grammes. As to how the production of American silver\r\n      increases and runs parallel with the cheapness of quicksilver, see\r\n      _Humboldt_, N. Espagne, IV, 91 ff.\r\n\r\n_  868 Wolowski_ calculates that the absolutely much smaller yearly\r\n      increment to the amount of the precious metals in the sixteenth\r\n      century, frequently 1/12, now constitutes only 1/50 of the greater\r\n      existing amount. (L’Or et l’Argent Enquête, 50.)\r\n\r\n  869 In the United States the stock of cash money in 1820 was estimated\r\n      at 5.1 thalers per capita; in 1849, at 8.6 thalers; in 1854, on the\r\n      other hand, at 13 thalers.\r\n\r\n  870 The weight of the mass of gold introduced into Europe annually stood\r\n      to that of silver in the ratio of 1:60-65 in the seventeenth\r\n      century; in the first half of the eighteenth century, in that of\r\n      1:30; in the second half, in that of 1:40; and yet the variations in\r\n      price were not in the least parallel. According to _Sœtbeer_\r\n      (Beiträge und Materialien zur Beurtheilung von Geld und Bankfragen,\r\n      1855, 102 seq.), the average silver-course (_silbercurs_) of gold\r\n      had, 1852-54, sunk only 2.05 per cent., as compared with that of\r\n      1800-40. And yet the value of the annual production of gold stood to\r\n      the annual production of silver, in the beginning of the nineteenth\r\n      century, as 29 to 71; in 1846, as 47 to 53; in 1848-56, as 3 to 1.\r\n\r\n  871 While the public, even since 1850, think they have noticed a\r\n      depreciation in the value of money, there are a great many learned\r\n      political economists who are by no means prepared to grant it. The\r\n      principal advocates of this opinion are _Tooke_, and _Newmarch_, in\r\n      vol. VI. of the History of Prices (1857). Also _Lavergne_, in the\r\n      Journal des Economistes. And really the enhanced dearness of many\r\n      kinds of goods up to 1857, might have been accounted for by causes\r\n      affecting the goods themselves: diminished supply by reason of bad\r\n      harvests, commercial gluts etc.; increased demand by capitalization\r\n      on a gigantic scale, speculation, but especially by the elevation of\r\n      the lower classes etc.\r\n\r\n      The London wholesale prices were on the 1st day of January, 1869,\r\n      nearly all lower by 10 per cent. than on the 1st day of July, 1857.\r\n      Only indigo, cotton and meat had risen. (_Hildebrand’s_ Jahrb.,\r\n      1870, I, 328.) In many instances the enhanced dearness is entirely\r\n      local, by reason of the greater facilities for transportation in\r\n      places where prices were already higher. But as new truths are very\r\n      easily exaggerated by their discoverers, much of Tooke’s view\r\n      concerning these events depends upon a polemic carried too far\r\n      against the theory of the balance of trade which was customary in\r\n      the so-called currency school. Compare, in opposition to Tooke,\r\n      _Lavasseur_, in the Journal des Economistes, March, 1838, and _M.\r\n      Chevalier_, La Baisse probable de l’Or, 1858. _Lavasseur_, from the\r\n      difference between the official and real custom-house prices in\r\n      France, calculates that raw materials in 1856 were on the average 63\r\n      per cent., and in 1858, 20 per cent. higher than in 1826; and that\r\n      manufactured articles were in 1856, just as high, and in 1858, 6 per\r\n      cent. lower than in 1856. An average made of all commodities showed,\r\n      in 1856, an enhancement of 30 per cent, and in 1858 of 9 per cent.\r\n      (_Hildebrand’s_ Jahrb., 1864, II, 118.)\r\n\r\n      In the Hamburg market in 1847-65, 87 articles declined in price, 183\r\n      rose in price, and 24 remained about stationary. (Amtl. Statistik\r\n      von 1887, 18 ff.) _Jevons_ assumes a general rise in the price of\r\n      commodities between 1849 and 1869 of about 18 per cent. (Economist,\r\n      May 8, 1869.) He makes this estimate from the average March prices\r\n      of 50 of the principal articles. Assuming the average March price of\r\n      1849=100, we have, according to him, for the following years,\r\n      respectively: 101, 103, 101, 116, 130, 125, 129, 132, 118, 120, 124,\r\n      123, 124, 123, 122, 121, 128, 118, 120, 119. Previous years showed:\r\n      1789=133; 1799=202; 1809=245; 1819=175; 1829=124; 1839=144. (Compare\r\n      supra, § 129, note 1.) The budget of a Swiss teacher’s family\r\n      consisting of five persons has become dearer since 1840 ff., their\r\n      consumption remaining the same and of only the simplest articles, by\r\n      72.5 per cent. (Böhmert, Arbeiterervhältnisse etc., I, 302 ff.,\r\n      355.) That, however, the depreciation is under-estimated most\r\n      precisely in England and over-estimated in Germany, _Knies_ very\r\n      well accounts for by the price-leveling effects of the more modern\r\n      means of communication. (Tübinger Zeitschr., 1858, 280 ff.)\r\n\r\n  872 Compare _Leibnitz_, on the consequences which would follow the\r\n      realization of the dreams of the alchemists. It would be a great\r\n      misfortune, since then a pocket would no longer suffice for the\r\n      transportation of money, and people would have to use wheel-barrows\r\n      as they do now in Sweden. (Opera ed. Dutens, V, 199, 401.)\r\n\r\n_  873 Beccaria_ considers it equitable that the debtor should always pay\r\n      the original value of the metal. (E.P., IV, 2, 17.) _Galiani_, on\r\n      the other hand, would not permit individuals, even when the state\r\n      arbitrarily causes a diminution in the real value of money, to\r\n      maintain the real value of the coinage in their contracts. (Della\r\n      Moneta, V. 3.)\r\n\r\n  874 It is precisely this class which first comes to an understanding of\r\n      the essential nature of the change effected.\r\n\r\n  875 Thus the English lessees, who in the sixteenth century had leases\r\n      for a long term of years, saw themselves rise in the social scale in\r\n      consequence of the revolutions in price—a fact of importance in the\r\n      political struggles of the seventeenth century. Compare _Sir F. M.\r\n      Eden_, State of the Poor, I, 119 ff.\r\n\r\n  876 Too  much stress is laid upon this by _Tooke-Newmarch_, who, on that\r\n      account, considers almost every increase of the precious metals as a\r\n      blessing. As a matter of fact, the population of Australia, of the\r\n      United Kingdom, and of the United States, increased, between 1848\r\n      and 1871, 44.5 per cent.; the production of coal and of railroads in\r\n      England, between 1856 and 1869, by about 60.6 per cent.; the English\r\n      production of woolen goods, linen and cotton and yarn, between 1848\r\n      and 1870, by from 110 to 335 per cent. (Statist. Journal, 1872, 376\r\n      ff.)\r\n\r\n_  877 Luther’s_ complaint concerning the poor condition of the clergy.\r\n      See _Schmoller_, in the Tübinger Ztschr., 1860. This very clearly\r\n      shows how much surer for the crown domains are than a civil list,\r\n      and donations of land to a church than payments in money. Law of\r\n      Elizabeth, 18 Eliz., that, in the case of university property, ⅔ of\r\n      the lease rent should be paid in metal and ⅓ in corn. In _Adam\r\n      Smith’s_ time, this latter third was worth as much again as the\r\n      other two. (I, ch. 5.)\r\n\r\n  878 In the sixteenth century, this class was of small importance in most\r\n      countries; in our times, their ruin would cause general disturbance.\r\n      The wiser class of capitalists would, indeed, find means to exchange\r\n      their credits for more certain values, or make it a condition that\r\n      they should receive in the end a large sum.\r\n\r\n  879 Thus, for instance, the son of a deceased land owner who retains the\r\n      lands as his own acquits himself towards his brothers who have\r\n      entered the military or civil service of their country by paying\r\n      them a certain sum periodically. If a revolution were really\r\n      impending, the owners of land would soon emulate one another to\r\n      improve their estates by borrowing capital, if for no other reason,\r\n      to turn the depreciation of the medium of circulation to their own\r\n      advantage. In the sixteenth century, the indebtedness of land owners\r\n      was relatively unimportant.\r\n\r\n  880 It appears from _Roger’s_ Tables, Statist. Journal, 1861, 551 ff.,\r\n      that, between 1583 and 1620, a time during which the population of\r\n      England increased neither in wealth nor in numbers, there was a\r\n      considerable increase in the price of nearly all English\r\n      commodities. Thus, for instance, wheat was, from 1591 to 1600, 468\r\n      per cent., and from 1611 to 1620, even 495 per cent. higher than\r\n      from 1530 to 1533. The Saxon laborer earned, in 1599, in corn, only\r\n      half as much as in 1455. (Tübinger Ztschr., 1871, 354.)\r\n\r\n  881 When labor is indispensable to employers, it may happen that a small\r\n      decline in the supply may largely raise the price. Wages, in almost\r\n      all branches of labor, rose between 1851 and 1856, by about from 15\r\n      to 20 per cent.\r\n\r\n  882 This, also, was of little significance in the sixteenth century, but\r\n      how important now!\r\n\r\n  883 Income taxes, _ad valorem_ duties and tithes rise and fall in their\r\n      nominal amount as the price of the medium of circulation falls and\r\n      rises.\r\n\r\n  884 Thus, for instance, the victory of the English Parliament over the\r\n      unlimited power of the crown, in the first half of the seventeenth\r\n      century, was very much promoted by the fact that the crown, in spite\r\n      of all its economy, was always in financial straits in consequence\r\n      of the depreciation of money. (Power of the purse, power of the\r\n      sword!) However, any force kept steadily in action is a two-edged\r\n      sword. While under favorable circumstances, it may be thereby\r\n      developed, under unfavorable circumstances it may be thereby\r\n      exhausted. How great a number of representative assemblies, during\r\n      the revolutions in prices in the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\n      centuries, allowed their energies to grow dormant!\r\n\r\n  885 Most of the above points are very well discussed in the work _W.\r\n      S._, cited above, § 137.\r\n\r\n  886 As no one then doubted: Compare _W. Raleigh_, The Discovery of\r\n      Guiana, Pref. I refer to Philip of Macedon.\r\n\r\n  887 Compare _Roscher_, Kolonien, Kolonialpolitik und Auswanderung, 1856,\r\n      145 ff.\r\n\r\n  888 Something similar might have been observed in England in 1819 etc.,\r\n      at the restoration of a depreciated paper currency. Among nations in\r\n      a comparatively low stage of civilization, a variation in the medium\r\n      of circulation is of less importance than among more highly\r\n      civilized nations, because trade in money, and still more, credit,\r\n      are relatively speaking undeveloped.\r\n\r\n_  889 Fawcett_ greatly exaggerates when he says that with an increase of\r\n      population and wealth, an increase of money is as much a want as\r\n      hunger.

In Italy, 1579 = 12:1. (_Scaruffi_, Sopra le\r\n      Moneta, 1582.) In Holland, 1589 = 11.6:1. _Bodinus_, De Republ.,\r\n      1584, II, 3, maintains 12:1 as the general ratio; but the Apostolic\r\n      Chamber adopted the ratio of 12.8:1. In Germany, according to the\r\n      instances cited by _A. Riese_, 1522 = 10:1.

(_Forbonnais_,\r\n      Finances de la France, I, 52.) About 1641, in Flanders, it was 12.5;\r\n      in France, 13.5; in Spain, 14.1. Immediately after Colbert’s death\r\n      it was, in Genoa, 15.03; in Milan = 14.75:1. (_Montanari_, Della\r\n      Moneta, 80.) While in the seventeenth century gold rose, it sank in\r\n      the eighteenth, on account of the Brazilian gold washings and the\r\n      many bank notes in circulation, which were for the most part of a\r\n      large denomination. (_Steuart_, Principles, III, ch. 13.) Still it\r\n      was in Amsterdam in 1751 = 14.5:1.\r\n\r\n  891 In Hamburg, the relation of the price of gold to that of silver\r\n      bars, varied, between 1816 and 1852, from between 15.11-16.2 to 1\r\n      (_Soetbeer_); in London, from 1816 to 1837, between 15.80 and 14.97\r\n      to 1.\r\n\r\n  892 In Asia, it is generally lower than in Europe—for centuries mostly =\r\n      10:1. But in Birmah it is = 17:1, mostly on account of the extent to\r\n      which indulgence in luxury is carried there. (_Crawfurd_, Embassy,\r\n      433. _Ritter_, Erdkunde, V, 244, 266.) Concerning China, see _M.\r\n      Chevalier_, Cours, III, 359. In Africa, gold is low as compared with\r\n      silver, in proportion to the distance from the civilized world.\r\n      Thus, an ounce of gold in Shenaar cost 12 piastres; in Suakim, 20;\r\n      in Djidda, 22. (_Ritter_, Erdkunde, I, 538.) In Timbuctoo, Mungo\r\n      Park found the relation of gold to silver to be as 1-½:1.

According to\r\n      Manu’s Indian laws, VIII, 134 seq., = 2-½:1; in the East, for a long\r\n      time, = 10:1; under Darius Hystaspis, = 13:1. (_Herodot._, 111, 95.)\r\n      In Greece, in the time of Lysias, = 10:1 (_Lysias_, pro bonis\r\n      Arist., Conon); according to _Plato,_ = 12:1 (_Hipparch._, 231);\r\n      according to _Demosthenes_, adv. Phorm., 214, = 14:1 (_Böckh_,\r\n      Staatst., I, 43); Menander’s estimate, = 10:1, probably because\r\n      Alexander’s victory had made gold cheaper. (_Pollux_, IX, 76.) Among\r\n      the Romans, about 189 B.C., = 10:1 (_Livy_, XXXVIII, 11); somewhat\r\n      later, = 11.9:1 (_Mommsen_, in the histor. phil. Berichten der K.\r\n      Sächs. Gesellschaft, 1851, 184 ff.); in the fourth century after\r\n      Christ, = 14:1. (_Theod._, Cod. VIII, 4, 27.) We sometimes find\r\n      sudden variations. Thus, according to _Polyb._, XXXIV, 10, gold, in\r\n      Italy, sank about ⅓ in consequence of the opening of the mines at\r\n      Aquilea. It sank to the proportion of 9:1 when Cæsar spent the\r\n      contents of the Roman treasure, which consisted of gold. (_Surton._,\r\n      Cæs., 54.) The ratio of 17:1, during Hannibal’s wars, was a species\r\n      of National bankruptcy. See _Plin._, H. N., XXXIII, B.\r\n\r\n  894 After the February revolution, the gold-agio, as compared with\r\n      silver, rose from 10-17 to 70 per 1,000. (_M. Chevalier_ Cours, III,\r\n      346.) On the other hand, since the discovery of America, gold, as\r\n      compared with commodities, has declined much less than silver.\r\n      Compare _Hermann_, Ueber den gegenwärtigen Zustand des Münzwesens,\r\n      in _Rau’s_ Archiv., I, 151 ff. According to _Lord Liverpool_,\r\n      Treatise on the Coins of the Realm, the value of gold coin in the\r\n      London market, as compared with bank notes, varied in 40 years,\r\n      almost 5½ per cent.\r\n\r\n  895 In recent times, it has become possible to extract from ancient\r\n      silver coins a small quantity of gold, and with some advantage.\r\n      European industry produced in this way about 1,600 kilogrammes of\r\n      gold per annum. One half of this amount is obtained in France and\r\n      the rest in Hamburg, Amsterdam, Brussels and St. Petersburg.\r\n      (_Michel Chevalier_, Cours, III, 302.)\r\n\r\n_  896 Senior_, On the Value of Money, 77 ff. It is certain that a simple\r\n      variation in prices would not induce people to have gold table\r\n      services, or architectural ornaments of silver.\r\n\r\n_  897 Rau_, Lehrbuch, 6th ed., I, § 277 c. In Rau’s opinion (loc. cit.)\r\n      we may, in the course of the next decades, expect a decline of the\r\n      price of gold of about 76 per cent., and of only 10 percent. of the\r\n      price of silver (because of the low prices of quicksilver.) But here\r\n      he seems to overlook entirely what influence a change of standard in\r\n      important commercial districts would have.\r\n\r\n  898 Compare the works already mentioned. _Fleetwood_, Chronicon\r\n      preciosum, or an Account of English Gold and Silver Money, the Price\r\n      of Corn and other Commodities etc., for Six Hundred Years last past,\r\n      1707; _Dupré de Saint Maur_, Essai sur les Monnaies ou Réflexions\r\n      sur les Rapports entre les Denrées et l’Argent, 1746; _Unger_,\r\n      Ordnung der Fruchtpreise, 1752; _Paucton_, Métrologie ou Traité des\r\n      Mesures etc., des anciens Peuples et les modernes, 1780; the\r\n      appendix to _Macpherson’s_ Annals of Commerce, 1805; the tables in\r\n      _Garnier’s_ translation of Adam Smith, vol.

There are some very interesting notes on\r\n      the history of prices during the Merovingian and Carolingian periods\r\n      in _Guérard_, Polyptiques, I, 141 ff.\r\n\r\n  899 Thus, for instance, the bonds (and their coupons) of states, cities,\r\n      great corporations, certificates of stock, mortgages, bills of\r\n      exchange, checks.\r\n\r\n  900 A Prussian regulation of 1765 (_Goldschmidt_, Handbuch des\r\n      Handelsrechts, I, 550), calls money-paper (_Effecten_), instruments\r\n      of trade in which a value or a _valuta_ is designated.\r\n\r\n_  901 Garnier_, French translation of Adam Smith, II, 143 ff.,\r\n      distinguishes between coin-paper and promise-paper: the latter is\r\n      never found in circulation at the same time with the capital which\r\n      it represents. _Say_ says that, for instance, evidences of state\r\n      indebtedness, state bonds, call for money if they would circulate,\r\n      but they seldom act as money in circulation. (Traité, III, ch. 2.)\r\n      _Sismondi_ very well determines the difference in his Richesse\r\n      Commerciale, I, 160. _Rau_, Lehrbuch, I, § 293, requires of all good\r\n      paper money: a., that its mere transfer, even without any proof of\r\n      its rightful acquisition, should suffice to vest the property in it\r\n      in the receiver; b., that the power emitting it should enjoy\r\n      universal confidence or be able to compel universal recognition; c.,\r\n      that its redemption should not be fixed for any definite point of\r\n      time.\r\n\r\n  902 That it is not possible to keep paper money from declining in value,\r\n      by the payment of interest, the people of North America learned from\r\n      more than one experiment during the eighteenth century. (_Benjamin\r\n      Franklin_, Remarks and Facts relative to the Paper Money of America,\r\n      1765.) The same phenomenon was observed in the case of the Spanish\r\n      _vales_, which were created during the North American war in\r\n      consequence of the absence of the silver fleet. (_Bour-going_,\r\n      Tableau de l’ Espagne, II, 38 ff. _Humboldt_, N. Espagne, II, 808.)\r\n      When the Portuguese _apolices_ (since 1797) still bore six per cent.\r\n      they depreciated in value; and when the payment of the interest was\r\n      suddenly stopped, the rate of exchange did not become any lower.\r\n      (_Balbi_, Esai statist. sur le Portugal, I, 323.) In Austria, in\r\n      September, 1820, the bank notes which bore no interest were at a\r\n      premium as compared with the imperial treasury notes, which did bear\r\n      interest of 1 per cent., although the credit of both kinds of paper\r\n      had ultimately the same foundation, namely, Austrian state-credit.\r\n\r\n  903 The attempt to make paper money pay interest suggests (as the Saint\r\n      Simonists recommend it should, with much ado; _Enfantin_, Ser les\r\n      Banques, d’ Escompte in the Producteur, 1826), that awkward sword,\r\n      invented by Count Wilhelm von Bückeburg, to the blade of which a\r\n      pistol is affixed! Shortly before each term for the payment of\r\n      interest, the circulation of such paper money would be arrested. If\r\n      the rate of discount should sink below the rate of interest such\r\n      notes bore, they would be sought after eagerly and disappear in\r\n      quantities, and, not be ever seen again until the rate of discount\r\n      had risen to a high figure, when they would be suddenly presented\r\n      for redemption. Such interest-bearing paper money, therefore, would\r\n      be a serious element to aggravate the fluctuations of the\r\n      money-market between good and bad times. When interest-bearing paper\r\n      money pays interest at the rate usual in the country, it is hoarded\r\n      by misers, (_v. Struensee_. Abhandlungen, III, 387.) Compare\r\n      _Forbonnais_, Principes économiques, p. 234, ed. Guill., whereas _v.\r\n      Prittwitz_, Kunst reich zu werden (1840, 359), takes delight in\r\n      elaborating the idea of an interest-bearing paper money.\r\n\r\n  904 Of jurists, see _Thöl_, Handelsrecht, I, § 51, and the authorities\r\n      for and against in _Goldschmidt_, Handelsrecht, II, Kap. 4, 1, 2.\r\n      The compulsory circulation of paper money is an essential element\r\n      only in reference to the person that issues it. Of political\r\n      economists, especially _A. Wagner_ in _Bluntschli’s_\r\n      Staatswörterbuch, Art. Papiergeld, Band, VII, who, however, is very\r\n      soon compelled to oppose to paper money “proper,” another kind not\r\n      “proper.” _Adam Smith_ unhesitatingly accounts bank notes also\r\n      paper-money. (W. of N., II, ch. 2, p. 28, Bas.) _Huskisson_\r\n      understands by “paper-money” only the irredeemable paper-money of\r\n      the state, while bank notes should be considered as “paper\r\n      currency.” (The Question concerning the Depreciation of our\r\n      Currency, 1810.)\r\n\r\n_  905 Seyd_, Münz, Währungs- und Bankfragen in Deutschland, 50 ff.,\r\n      distinguishes four classes of paper-money: 1st class, paper-money\r\n      covered by cash; 2d class, bank notes covered after the manner of\r\n      banks; 3d class, state paper-money; 4th class, such paper money as\r\n      the notes of the Southern Confederacy after its defeat.\r\n\r\n  906 Even _Plato_, De Legg., V, 742, was acquainted with money after the\r\n      Spartan type, intended only for internal trade: νόμισμα ἐπιχώριον,\r\n      αὐτοῖς μὲν ἔντιμον τοῖς δὲ ἄλλοις ἀνθρώποις ἀδόκιμον. Besides the\r\n      state kept for foreign trade a supply of the universal Hellenic\r\n      money, of which in case of need, private individuals could acquire\r\n      what portion they needed by exchange. When Dionysius I. issued tin\r\n      instead of silver money, all the Syracusans, although they noticed\r\n      the forgery, acted in their intercourse with one another as if they\r\n      considered the coins genuine. (_Aristot._, Œcon., II, 21, _Pollux_,\r\n      IX, 79.) Timotheos behaved more honorably when, pressed by the\r\n      dearth of money, he gave his troops copper coin tokens, which passed\r\n      for the time being for their full value in the camp; but which were\r\n      later to be redeemed at their full value in silver. (_Aristot._, Œc.\r\n      II, 22.) Compare _Polyæn_, Strateg., IV, 10, 2. The iron money which\r\n      the Klazomenians exchanged with the rich for silver, which bore\r\n      interest, but which the rich were forced to take, had a longer\r\n      duration; the silver was used to pay foreign state creditors, the\r\n      iron money circulated for the time being in the city, and was\r\n      gradually redeemed. (_Aristot._, loc. cit, II, 17.)\r\n\r\n      We are still more forcibly reminded of paper money by the\r\n      Carthaginian leather money, where any object whatever of the size of\r\n      a coin was shut up in a leather envelope with the state seal, and\r\n      then circulated as if it were the coin it purported to be. _Mieris_,\r\n      Beschryving der Munstn, 1726, explains the saga of Dido’s ox-skin by\r\n      means of this leather money. Certain it is, however, that the\r\n      surprise with which the sophistical dialogue, Eryxias, mentions the\r\n      matter, is a proof how foreign it was to the Greeks. Concerning the\r\n      Roman plated denarii which were stamped with the silver coins, but\r\n      which were also accepted by the state treasury, see _Mommsen_, R.\r\n      G., I, 405.\r\n\r\n  907 In the middle ages, leather money was issued as a promise of future\r\n      payment: by the doge of Venice in the wars of 1122 and 1126\r\n      (_Montanari_, Della Moneta, 34); by King John, of England, during\r\n      the struggle of the barons (_Camden_); Emp. Frederick II. at the\r\n      siege of Faventia (_Malespini_, Hist. Fior., 130, _Villani_, Hist.\r\n      Fior., VI, 21); by Louis IX. during his captivity (_v. Raumer_\r\n      Hohenstaufen, V, 461), John of France, 1360 (_Anderson_, Origin of\r\n      Commerce). On the Frankfurt lead marks which were afterwards\r\n      redeemed by the _Rechnerei_: _Kirchner_, I, 541. Lavallette’s copper\r\n      tokens during the siege of Malta had the inscription: _non æs sed\r\n      fides_. The paper money which was issued during the siege of Leyden,\r\n      the inhabitants afterwards would rather preserve than have redeemed,\r\n      _ad perpetuam liberationis divinæ memoriam_. (_Bornitii_, De Nummis,\r\n      1605, I, 15.

Sometimes they called them\r\n      “flying coins, convenient coins,” and sometimes _coupons_, _bons_,\r\n      _conventions_ (_Klaproth_, Mémoires relatives à l’Asie, I, 375 ff.),\r\n      against which the caravans, as soon as they had passed the limits\r\n      were obliged to exchange their silver (_Pegolotti_, Pratica della\r\n      Mercatura in Della decima etc., III, 3). These had compulsory\r\n      circulation in China. The great Mongolian khans here became\r\n      acquainted with paper-money. (_M. Polo_, II, 21.) Thus, especially\r\n      in Persia, where refusal to accept such money and the imitation of\r\n      it was punished with death (1340). Compare _Ferishta_, ed. _Briggs_,\r\n      I, 414 ff. _d’Ohsson_, Hist. des Mongols, IV, 101 ff.; II, 487. Even\r\n      here there occurred cases of state bankruptcy and finally\r\n      withdrawals of the depreciated paper. (_Klaproth_, loc. cit.) In\r\n      Japan, according to _Oliphant_, Narrative of L. Elgin’s Mission to\r\n      China and Sapan (1859), all foreign coins were required to be\r\n      exchanged against paper-money at the offices of the state bankers.\r\n\r\n  909 Adam Smith mentions North American paper money of the amount of 1\r\n      shilling, and Yorkshire bank notes of the amount of 1-½ shillings.\r\n      Sweden had, until 1828, notes of 28 _pfennigs_.\r\n\r\n  910 Hence in Sweden, with its copper standard of long duration, the\r\n      system of banks of issue was developed very early. The\r\n      transport-notes (_Transportzettel_) (to be found in that country as\r\n      far back as 1661) of the Stockholm bank are considered the oldest\r\n      bank notes. Compare, however, _Palgrave_, in the Statist. Journal,\r\n      1873. When, in 1768, Catherine II. introduced paper money into\r\n      Russia, the people gladly paid ¼ per cent. exchange to the state\r\n      treasury for it. (_Brückner_, in _Hildebrand’s_ Jahrbücher, 1863,\r\n      49.) According to _Cancrin_, Oconomie der menschl. Gesellschaft,\r\n      116, private individuals in from four to five months exchanged 40\r\n      millions of silver roubles for paper. And thus, in 1780, Berlin bank\r\n      notes stood a few per cent. above par, and the notes of the S.\r\n      Carlos-Bank, in 1788, from 1 to 1-½ per cent. (_Rau_, Archiv., II,\r\n      161.)\r\n\r\n  911 When at times in which paper money is looked upon with diffidence,\r\n      peasants and others bury their metallic money, this advantage of\r\n      course is lost. On the other hand, the exportation of precious metal\r\n      money, caused by the emission of paper money, must not be considered\r\n      a necessary evil, but rather as the condition precedent which in\r\n      most cases makes the above advantages of the paper money possible\r\n      for the first time. Compare _Ad. Wagner_, Die russische\r\n      Papierwährung (1868), 22, 24, 33. _Ricardo_, Proposals for an\r\n      economical and sure Currency, 1816, estimated that England, after\r\n      the abolition of the bank restriction, needed twenty million pounds\r\n      sterling. The interest on this amount of capital inclusive of wear\r\n      and tear etc., should be estimated at at least ten percent.; that is\r\n      for the whole kingdom at at least from two and one-half to three\r\n      millions a year. On this _Ricardo_ founded his proposal to base the\r\n      bank notes on gold bars. In its time, the essay: Guineas an\r\n      unnecessary and expensive Incumbrance on Commerce, or the Impolity\r\n      of repealing the Bank-Restriction Bill considered (London, 1802),\r\n      met with great approval.\r\n\r\n_  912 Adam Smith_ calls attention to the analogous case in which a\r\n      manufacturer replaces a costly machine by a cheap one, sells the\r\n      former and employs the difference between the old one and the new in\r\n      enlarging his business. (W. of N., II, ch. 2.) When, indeed, all\r\n      nations have introduced the use of paper money, the greater portion\r\n      of the advantages which the one nation was able to obtain by its\r\n      means cease, and the only ultimate result is a depreciation of the\r\n      value of money and of the precious metals. Formerly the advantage\r\n      reaped by the single nation that emitted paper money was greater\r\n      than its share in the depreciation. (_Wolowski_, Enquête de 1865,\r\n      108.)\r\n\r\n  913 When E. Seyd calls bank notes more costly than metallic money,\r\n      because the former in England require an outlay for administration\r\n      of 1-½ per cent. per annum, while the wear and tear of metallic\r\n      money amounts to 1 per cent. only in 20 years (Statist. Journal,\r\n      1872, 511), he overlooks the loss in interest and the costs of\r\n      coinage in the latter case.\r\n\r\n  914 Related to this is the fact that in France, during the\r\n      assignat-crisis, the large bills of 10,000 francs were harder to get\r\n      rid of than the small ones. (_A. Schmidt’s_ Pariser Zustände, III,\r\n      22.)\r\n\r\n  915 The numbering of paper money. A state which should neglect this\r\n      would not only reserve to itself the possibility of an unlimited\r\n      increase, but would surrender all control of its officials charged\r\n      with the emission of the paper money. _Law_, Trade and Money, 162,\r\n      advises that a large money reward should be paid to any one who\r\n      should show the existence of a higher number than allowed by law, or\r\n      of a duplicate number. And indeed, as comptroller-in-chief, he\r\n      caused the _prévôt des marchands_ to be removed, because charged\r\n      with the duty of burning the paper withdrawn from circulation, he\r\n      (the _prévôt_) noticed that the same number reappeared several\r\n      times.\r\n\r\n  916 If a traveler wished to pay his inn-keeper in the note of a bank\r\n      entirely unknown in the place, the latter would certainly refuse it.\r\n      If, on the other hand, the traveler were to offer him a silver coin,\r\n      the stamp and inscription of which were not familiar, still it would\r\n      be taken at the value of the metal it contained, after deduction\r\n      made of the costs of testing it, re-coining it, and compensation for\r\n      the trouble caused. Ignored by _Berkeley_, who, indeed, considered\r\n      metallic money nothing but “counters” or tickets (Querist, No. 23,\r\n      26, 441, 475), and who ascribes important advantages to paper\r\n      money,—which by “stamp” and “signature” is made as costly as gold\r\n      (440)—over metallic money (226).\r\n\r\n  917 Any person who has witnessed a tax-execution, or sale of property\r\n      for the non-payment of taxes (_Stuerexecution_) will admit that a\r\n      tax receipt is at least as real goods as an umbrella or a glass\r\n      window that protects one from the storm. _Michælis_ considers the\r\n      amount of running payments to the state for duties, taxes etc., as\r\n      the only right basis for full-value paper money. (Berliner\r\n      Vierteljahrsschrift, 1863, III.) Better yet when _Höfken_ advises\r\n      that only as much paper money should be issued as amounted to the\r\n      average balance (_Bestand_) in the national treasury. The tax-basis\r\n      is defended with great warmth by _L. Stein_. Louis XIV., in 1704\r\n      issued paper money bearing 7 per cent. interest, the acceptance of\r\n      which by all the royal officers of the treasury was prohibited!\r\n      (_Dutot_, Réflexions, 863, Daire.) _Law_, Trade and Money (1705)\r\n      ascribes to parcels of land the greatest constancy of value, because\r\n      they cannot be replaced, because they can be neither increased nor\r\n      decreased, and because they help to produce all other goods (p.\r\n      170). While silver cannot but depreciate, they have a prospect but\r\n      to rise (188). Hence _Law_ recommended notes based on parcels of\r\n      land as the best money. (163, 191, 195.) Similarly, _Benjamin\r\n      Franklin_, Modest Inquiry into the Nature and Necessity of a Paper\r\n      Currency: and the Paper Money of Pennsylvania, New York and New\r\n      Jersey was actually based on parcels of land, and was to be\r\n      extinguished by the enfeoffed owners, and the interest paid by them.\r\n      (_Ebeling_, Gesch. und Erdbeschreib, von N. Amerika, III, 621, IV,\r\n      649.)\r\n\r\n_  918 F. Renonard de Ste Croix_, Voyage aux Indes orientales (1810), I,\r\n      32, describes a species of paper money based on parcels of land\r\n      which had lost 40 per cent. of its nominal value, although the\r\n      holders of them were invested with the fief at only one-half their\r\n      value. The French _mandats territoriaux_ of 1796, declined in five\r\n      months to 5 per cent. of their nominal value, although they\r\n      contained the provision that the holders might, without public sale\r\n      (_Auction_), have a certain amount of the national estates allotted\r\n      to them in exchange for the _mandats_. The assignats were still more\r\n      defective after their redemption (at the _Caisse de\r\n      l’extraordinaire_), which was at first intended, and their drawing\r\n      of interest were not fulfilled. Leaving the tax-basis out of\r\n      consideration, the notes might, at the sale of the national estates,\r\n      be brought in as means of payment: a thing which would not have been\r\n      inoperative, provided the amount of the paper money had been\r\n      strictly limited to the price of the pieces of land estimated in\r\n      money. On the 1st of April, 1790, 400,000,000 francs in assignats\r\n      were issued, and in September, 800,000,000 more, both together about\r\n      equal to the secularized property of the church. (_Ad. Schmidt_,\r\n      Pariser Zustände, II, 97.) But as afterwards all proportion between\r\n      these two magnitudes ceased, or rather as up to January 1, 1793,\r\n      3,626,000,000 assignats were issued; up to September, 1794, over\r\n      8,800,000,000; up to September, 1795, 19,700,000,000; and finally up\r\n      to September, 1796, 45,578,000,000 francs, of which perhaps\r\n      6,500,000 were either burned or demonetized, the price of the\r\n      national estates on lands must naturally have risen as vastly as the\r\n      assignats declined.\r\n\r\n  919 The paper money issued by Colbert’s successor, Chamillard, soon lost\r\n      on account of its too great amount, 25 per cent. of its value, spite\r\n      of the fact that it bore interest, and that ¼ of all payments to\r\n      private persons had to be made in it. (_Forbonnais_, Recherches et\r\n      Considérations, II, 182.) When the people of the United States, in\r\n      1775, issued paper money, it did not decline in value up to the end\r\n      of 1776, so long as the amount did not exceed $20,000,000, as it was\r\n      considered a matter of honor to take it at par. Afterwards, when the\r\n      amount issued continued to increase, not even the law that a refusal\r\n      to accept it, or insisting on taking it below par, should be\r\n      punished with the loss of the commodity, and that the guilty party\r\n      should be declared a national enemy, could keep it from declining in\r\n      value; so that in May, 1871, a dollar in specie was worth $200.5 in\r\n      paper. Compare _Franklin_, Works, ed. Sparks, II, 421, VIII, 328,\r\n      505.\r\n\r\n      France, during the Reign of Terror, on the 2d day of April 1793,\r\n      threatened the claiming of a discount in the taking of assignats\r\n      with six years’ confinement in chains, and on the 1st day of August,\r\n      on Couthon’s motion, with twenty years’ confinement. In addition to\r\n      this, maximum prices for the principal necessities of life were\r\n      fixed and the exceeding of them was punished by severe penalties;\r\n      and in France, and still more in the neighboring conquered\r\n      countries, there were many persons who preferred to take assignats\r\n      instead of payment rather than permit themselves to be robbed by\r\n      requisitions. And yet on the 4th of June, 1796, one franc in specie\r\n      exchanged for 800 francs assignats. Compare _Büsch_, Geldumlauf, III\r\n      (§ 58 ff., _d’Ivernois_, Etat. des Finances Française, 1796).\r\n\r\n  920 The Prussian treasury notes of 1806, by virtue of a decree published\r\n      in 1807, were to be taken by all at a rate of exchange to be\r\n      officially published from time to time. Between December 1, 1807,\r\n      and February 28, 1809, the highest “normal course of exchange” was\r\n      71, and the lowest 27 per cent. In January, 1815, a refusal to take\r\n      them at par, except in certain cases, was threatened with from 500\r\n      to 1,000 thalers of a money-fine or from 6 to 12 months’\r\n      imprisonment. But indeed, in December, 1812, of 8,000,000 thalers,\r\n      there were only 731,625 still circulating. Compare § 7 of the decree\r\n      of the 19th of January, 1813. In April, 1815, it was ordered that\r\n      the half of all taxes should be paid in such notes, or that if not,\r\n      8-½ per cent, should be added as a penalty. This penalty, reduced in\r\n      1827 to 1 silver groschen, was not formally abolished even in 1870,\r\n      although it had long fallen into disuetude. There was a run of the\r\n      owners of the notes in 1830, for redemption, and again in 1841 and\r\n      1848; in 1848 to the extent of at most 40,000 thalers in one day,\r\n      and altogether not over 100,000 thalers. (_Bergius_, in the Tübinger\r\n      Zeitschr., 1870, 226 ff.) About 1846, it was estimated that scarcely\r\n      1/250 a year of Prussian paper money was presented for redemption,\r\n      while ⅓ of the state receipts came in in the shape of paper money.\r\n      (_Rau_, Archiv., V, 125, 207.) The Saxon treasury notes never lost\r\n      over 2 per cent., although the state treasury redeemed them up to\r\n      1804 only at an _agio_ of 9 _pfennigs_ per thaler, and afterwards of\r\n      1 _pfennig_.\r\n\r\n  921 Those entitled to make money claims are either compelled to accept\r\n      the paper money at its nominal value or only at its current value\r\n      for the time being. In the latter instance, the unjust compulsion is\r\n      much smaller, but at the same time the whole expedient is much less\r\n      productive to the state; and hence the former is the more usual. It\r\n      was provided in Austria on the 22d of May and the 2d of June, 1848,\r\n      that the former should be the rule, and that the latter should\r\n      govern in cases in which gold or foreign silver had been stipulated\r\n      for. (_Höfken_, Oesterreichs Finanzprobleme, p. 53.) On the 7th of\r\n      February, 1856, it was permitted to contract by express promise for\r\n      loans in the metallic currency of the country, both for the interest\r\n      and the repayment of the principal. Hence a species of\r\n      parallel-currency. If it be made entirely impossible for private\r\n      individuals to protect themselves against the compulsory circulation\r\n      of paper money, the more prudent are forced to send their capital\r\n      into foreign countries, which operates very disadvantageously to\r\n      poor countries especially. (_Wagner_, Tübing. Zeitschr., 1863, 441.)\r\n\r\n  922 Thus, for instance, the Frederick coins, and for a time the French\r\n      assignats were helped by the popular enthusiasm, while Gustavus\r\n      III., of Sweden, could give little value to his paper. (_v.\r\n      Struensee_, Abh., III, 577.) In France, in 1796, 2,400,000,000\r\n      _mandats_ were issued instead of all the outstanding assignats; that\r\n      is, as many as there were assignats at the close of the year 1792.\r\n      And yet the latter were then only 25 per cent. below par; the\r\n      former, before one month had elapsed, 80, and in nine months, almost\r\n      98 per cent. below par. (_St Chamans_, Nouvelle Essai sur la\r\n      Richesse des Nations, p. 150. _A. Schmidt_, Parisier Zustände, III,\r\n      121 ff.) In Austria, in 1811, the volume of paper money was\r\n      contracted, but in a manner so violent and destructive of credit\r\n      that its rate of exchange did not rise in consequence. (Tub.\r\n      Zeitschr., 1763, 1874.) After 1848, also, the rate of exchange of\r\n      Austrian paper money was much more perceptibly influenced by the\r\n      variations in the political state of affairs than by the changes in\r\n      its volume. (Tub. Zeitschr., 1856, 129.) In the summer and winter of\r\n      1866, about 650,000,000 paper rubles circulated, with scarcely any\r\n      increase or decrease; and yet the ratio of exchange was, during a\r\n      part of the summer, 66, and in winter, 84 per cent. of the silver\r\n      value of the ruble. (_Wagner_, Russ. Papierwährung, 74.) Instances\r\n      in which the increase in the price of commodities began to be more\r\n      general only after the volume of paper money had decreased; in\r\n      Austria, in 1851 and 1866; in Russia, in 1857 (loc. cit).\r\n\r\n  923 Then precious metal money becomes a commodity of which great stores\r\n      may be collected in the country itself, at the banks, but chiefly\r\n      for foreign trade. It is said that Austrian business men in 1860 and\r\n      the following years invested “hoards” to the amount of several\r\n      hundred million florins in exchange on metallic-currency countries.\r\n      (Tüb. Zeitschr., 422.) Good paper money will never drive out the\r\n      whole supply of cash money out of a country, because a good portion\r\n      must always be kept for purposes of redemption; depreciated paper\r\n      money operates much farther in this direction. Even the exportation\r\n      of small change may become a profitable speculation as soon as the\r\n      amount of depreciation of paper money exceeds the seigniorage. Then\r\n      usually small change of a worse kind is stamped, as, for instance,\r\n      in Austria, copper instead of silver; and in 1860, 12 millions\r\n      florins of paper small change. Here the exportation of the better\r\n      money is not a consequence, but the motive to the manufacturing of\r\n      the worse.\r\n\r\n  924 During the assignat-period it could happen that a land owner, after\r\n      the term for which he had farmed out his land, might be compelled to\r\n      surrender it to the farmers, for the reason that the taxes,\r\n      requisitions, etc., paid by the farmers, amounted to more than the\r\n      farm rent. In the case of the former, the calculation was based on\r\n      the recent depreciated value of the assignats; in the case of the\r\n      latter, on the higher value the assignats had at the moment that the\r\n      contract was concluded. (_Büsch_, Geldumlauf, III, 62.) A writer in\r\n      the Revue des deux Mondes, April 15, 1865, thinks that one reason\r\n      why the American civil war was so popular in the northwest was\r\n      because the paper money issued during the rebellion made it easy for\r\n      that part of the country to pay off the mortgage-debts which had\r\n      burthened it since 1848. Even of the two law catastrophes, _Duclos_,\r\n      in his memoirs, remarks that they produced a great admixture of\r\n      those who had been formerly separated by differences of class and\r\n      wiped out the previous ideas of decorum, fitness, etc.\r\n\r\n  925 During the time that the clipping of the coin was practiced, it is\r\n      scarcely possible to show that money was debased below 11 per cent.\r\n      of what its value should have been. See, on the other hand, § 3. In\r\n      Austria, in 1810, a person had to give 1,200 florins in paper money\r\n      for 100 florins in silver. (Tüb. Zeitschr., 1861, 593.) In North\r\n      America, in 1781, it took $280 in paper to purchase $1 in silver.\r\n      (_Ebeling_, Gesch. und Erdbeschreib., von N.A., 1856, III, 580; IV,\r\n      440; V, 437.) During the American civil war, the paper money of the\r\n      Southern States declined to ½ (December, 1863) and even to 1/35\r\n      (October, 1864) of its nominal value. Compare _Hock_, Finanzen der\r\n      V. Staaten, 514 ff. Observed even by _Storch_, Handbuch, _Rau’s_\r\n      translation, III, 141 ff. (See, on the other hand, _C. King_,\r\n      Thoughts, p. 113.) In Paris in July, 1795, the greater number of\r\n      commodities estimated in assignats were worth as much as if the rate\r\n      of exchange of the latter was 6-14 per cent. of their nominal value,\r\n      while it actually amounted to only 3-½ per cent.\r\n\r\n  926 Where an _agio_ of exchange of metallic money as compared with paper\r\n      is prohibited, the decline of the latter will manifest itself not\r\n      only in foreign rates of exchange, but also in the price of bars of\r\n      the precious metals.\r\n\r\n  927 The changes of the agio or premium depend mainly on the supply and\r\n      demand of the precious metals, that is, on the extent and intensity\r\n      of the business transactions which have to be made in these metals\r\n      themselves. (_Wagner,_ Russ. Papierw., 87.) Hence, for short periods\r\n      of time, it may be said in a paper currency country, that business\r\n      transactions based on cash money have a great element of variation\r\n      in them. (_Wagner_ in _Bluntschli’s_ Staats-wörterbuch, III, 971.)\r\n      The purchase and lease-hold prices of fixed capital, of houses, for\r\n      instance, rise much less because most people look upon the distress\r\n      as transitory, and of short duration. (_A. Walker_, Sc. of W., 133.)\r\n      In Austria in 1859, the rise of the agio of exchange of silver from\r\n      par to 40 per cent., and its subsequent fall within 7 months to 20\r\n      per cent., left the price of coin almost entirely unaffected. (_A.\r\n      Wagner_, Gött. Anz., 1860, 114.) That country people in general\r\n      suffer more from a bad paper currency than the towns people and\r\n      inhabitants of cities, see _Bonamy Price_, Currency and Banking,\r\n      175, seq. In the northern states of the American union, in 1864, 12\r\n      home kinds of commodities had risen 148 per cent., 7 foreign kinds\r\n      of commodities, 164 per cent., and 7 which could be obtained only\r\n      from the southern states, 353 per cent. (_v. Hock_, 186 seq.) As too\r\n      great issues of paper money are so frequently made on account of\r\n      war, it is comparatively easy to understand why it is that articles\r\n      for which war creates a demand should rise in price very soon and\r\n      very high; while the very opposite happens in times of\r\n      taxation-distress, in the case of a great many articles of luxury,\r\n      which can readily be dispensed with. _Büsch_ remarks (Werke, VII,\r\n      91), that retail dealers frequently raise their prices in order not\r\n      to be obliged to pay out so many small coins as change for the paper\r\n      dollar.\r\n\r\n  928 Compare _Hufeland_, N. Grundlegung, II, 241. Self-seeking\r\n      undertakers (_Unternehmer_ = men of enterprise) have, on this\r\n      account, both in Austria and Russia (_Wagner_, Russ. P.W., 105), but\r\n      more so in North America (_v. Hock_, 556 ff.), opposed measures\r\n      intended to restore values (_Valuta_), on the ground that they were\r\n      anti-national. Even _Sperausky_ experienced this in 1809, when he\r\n      published very correct ideas on paper money, while in the “fairy”\r\n      times of Catherine II., no one even thought that state paper money\r\n      is a state debt. (_Bernhardi_, Russ. Geschichte, II, 2, 636.) One of\r\n      the principal representatives of this course is _H. C. Carey_, Our\r\n      Resources (1866), and in the New York Herald, 1865. On the other\r\n      hand, _Faucher_ rightly calls the more active exportation of\r\n      countries, with a bad paper currency, an exportation of barbarous\r\n      nations, the commerce of misery, to which any price paid in metal or\r\n      in any higher-standing product of civilization is acceptable.\r\n      (Vierteljahrsschrift, 1868, IV, 167.) The nation in the aggregate\r\n      loses in international trade for the simple reason that its foreign\r\n      creditors will accept its paper money at most at its current rate of\r\n      exchange against specie, while foreign debtors force it upon the\r\n      nation at its nominal value.\r\n\r\n  929 The different provinces also of a large empire may have very\r\n      different degrees of depreciation of the same paper money. Thus, in\r\n      the interior of Russia its rate of exchange against specie had for a\r\n      long time not declined beyond 50 per cent. of its nominal value;\r\n      while the foreign rate of exchange supposed a decline to 33-⅓ per\r\n      cent. (_Cancrin_, Weltreichthum, 68.)\r\n\r\n  930 An enhancement of duties, taxes (_Abgaben_) etc., will seldom be\r\n      able to progress in the same measure as the paper money sinks; in\r\n      any case, a law would be necessary to effect this, which, however,\r\n      comes always later than the decline. (_Sismondi_, Du Papier Monnaie,\r\n      27.)\r\n\r\n_  931 Wagner_, Russische Papierwährung, 142, estimates that the Crimean\r\n      war depreciated the average current rate of exchange of Russian\r\n      paper money by 11.1 per cent., the Italian war of 1859 by 14.5 per\r\n      cent., the German war of 1866 by 19.4 per cent., spite of the fact\r\n      that Russia did not participate directly in the last two wars.\r\n\r\n  932 The more than forty-five milliards French assignats, estimated at\r\n      their rates current, really produced to the state only about six\r\n      milliards. (_Gentz_, Histor. Journ., 1800, II, 317, after\r\n      _Lecoulteux_.)\r\n\r\n  933 Very well explained by _H. Thornton_, Paper Credit of Great Britain,\r\n      ch. 10. As to how, in Austria, the paper-money crisis contributed to\r\n      bring the rigid national resources into a molten state, and to shake\r\n      off the national inertia by the feeling of insecurity, see _Buquoy_,\r\n      Theorie d. Wirthschaft, 1816, 347 ff. _Schäffle_, System, 3 aufl.,\r\n      254 seq., thinks that if Austria should first adjust its values, and\r\n      then, in case of another war, have recourse to a second\r\n      depreciation, the disastrous disturbances of its national economy\r\n      consequent herein would be produced twice instead of once, and not\r\n      without reason.\r\n\r\n  934 The Prussian treasury-bills stood, in June, 1809, at 36 per cent. of\r\n      their nominal value; June, 1810, 84-½ per cent.; January, 1812,\r\n      13-½; December, 1812, 44-½; June, 1813, 26-½; July, 1813, 24-½;\r\n      December 31, 1813, 49-½; January, 1815, 88; January 5, 1816, 99 per\r\n      cent. Austrian paper money expressed in terms of metallic money,\r\n      amounted, on an average, between 1849 and 1855, to 292,000,000\r\n      florins: but at certain moments, it fluctuated from 231,000,000 to\r\n      337,000,000. (Tübing. Zeitschr., 1856, 124.) The agio of silver\r\n      fluctuated during the _Bancozettel_ (bank-billets, a species of\r\n      Austrian paper money) period from one day to another on Change 40\r\n      and even 100 per cent.: thus, on the news of Napoleon’s entry into\r\n      Paris, between the 25th of March and the 4th of April, from 330 to\r\n      440; on the receipt of the news of the result of the battle of\r\n      Waterloo, in three days, from 458 to 412; after Napoleon’s\r\n      abdication, from 412 to 320. (_Gentz_, Werke, V, 62.) _Huskisson_\r\n      rightly calls a depreciated paper currency a much worse thing than\r\n      clipped coin: the clipping of the coin is, so to speak, one great\r\n      blow after which people can again calculate with certainty; but bad\r\n      paper money is one continual fluctuation.\r\n\r\n  935 “The only difference here is that it is not left to individuals to\r\n      say whether they will join in the game or not.” (_Helferich._)\r\n\r\n  936 During the later assignat-period every house was full of\r\n      commodities, every pocket of samples; every “exquisite” and every\r\n      lady was a merchant, because no one had any further confidence in\r\n      the money. People had retrograded to the barbarous condition of\r\n      trade by barter. (_Goncourt_, Histoire de la Société française\r\n      pendant le Directoire, 1854.) The French constitution of 1795 fixed\r\n      the salaries of members of the Directory at the value of 50,000\r\n      _myriogrammes_ of wheat (art. 173, 68). In Delaware, while the\r\n      depreciation of paper money lasted, farm rent was usually required\r\n      to be paid in produce. (_Ebeling_, V, 37.)\r\n\r\n  937 “Of all contrivances for cheating mankind, none has been more\r\n      effectual than that which deludes them with paper money.” (_D.\r\n      Webster._) The American Secretary of the Treasury, _McCulloch_,\r\n      says, in the report of December 7, 1868, of the legal tender notes:\r\n      “there can be no doubt that these acts have tended to blunt and\r\n      deaden the public conscience, and they are chargeable in no small\r\n      degree with the demoralization which so generally prevails.”\r\n      _Niebuhr_ attributes the decline of old Spanish honesty which was\r\n      formerly so much relied on in all great money centers, principally\r\n      to the _vales_. (Nichtphilol. Nachlass, 489.)\r\n\r\n  938 This calls to our mind the impersonal mass-crimes to which our own\r\n      times so frightfully incline, when many a man who would recoil in\r\n      horror from an ordinary act of pocket-picking or from manslaughter\r\n      with intent to commit larceny, robs thousands in cold blood by means\r\n      of a swindling enterprise, or, for the sake of a fraudulent\r\n      insurance, destroys the lives of a whole ship’s crew.\r\n\r\n  939 Saxon loans of two million thalers treasury notes (_Kassenbillets_),\r\n      August, 1813, which were then to bear interest in silver and to be\r\n      paid in silver. The purchase of the precious metals, or loans made\r\n      by the state in foreign countries, with the intention of redeeming\r\n      paper money, effect the same end at a much greater cost. (_Peschel_,\r\n      D. Vierteljahrsschrift, 1858, III, 254.) If the currency consists of\r\n      bank notes endowed by the state with compulsory circulation and an\r\n      irredeemable character, such a metallic loan made in order to\r\n      reimburse the bank for a loan to the state in depreciated notes is a\r\n      gift made to the bank without reason; and the metallic money brought\r\n      into the country flows back into foreign parts when the bank\r\n      restriction is removed, because it, together with the appreciated\r\n      notes, creates a too abundant circulation.\r\n\r\n  940 Although in England the suspension of the redemption of notes had\r\n      lasted from 1797 to 1819, depreciation of notes during the greater\r\n      part of this time either did not occur at all (Summer of 1797 to\r\n      1799, 1802 ff.) or was very small; and even during the last five war\r\n      years, it did not amount to much over 30 per cent. About 1817, the\r\n      notes of themselves again rose to par, and had lost but little\r\n      during the following years, in consequence of the great loans of the\r\n      continental powers in the English market. Under such circumstances,\r\n      the repeated promise of the state to make the notes redeemable at\r\n      their full nominal value was certainly a cogent reason for the\r\n      Peel’s Act of 1819. In favor hereof are especially _Tooke_, Hist. of\r\n      Prices, II, p. 60 ff., and _J. S. Mill_, Principles, III, ch. 13.\r\n      Opposed to it, the so-called Birmingham-Atwood school and also _Lord\r\n      Ashburton_, in his statement before the Agricultural Committee,\r\n      1836. But according to _Rob. Muschet_, Tables, exhibiting the Gain\r\n      and Loss to the Bondholders arising from the Fluctuations in the\r\n      Value of the Currency (1826), the state creditors, on the whole,\r\n      lost more by the depreciation of the notes than they gained by their\r\n      subsequent rise. _Ad. Wagner_ also is decidedly in favor of the\r\n      course A.\r\n\r\n  941 This has occurred not unfrequently in the case of the paper money of\r\n      subdued revolt: thus, for instance, the Hungarian of 1849; in the\r\n      case of the Southern Confederacy. But the assignats, too, came to\r\n      this end, although, according to _Büsch_ (Werke IX, 526), the\r\n      intentions of the country at first were good; and in Austria, in\r\n      1810, many prophecies looking in this direction were made. (Per\r\n      contra _Rehberg_, Sämmtl. Schriften. IV, 334.) Not very differently\r\n      did it fare with the Swedish coin-tokens (_Münzzeichen_) of Charles\r\n      XII, which were altered 7 times between 1715 and 1718; and where\r\n      besides, the tokens called in in a much too short space of time were\r\n      transformed into small change coins 1/32 their value hitherto.\r\n      (_Brückner_ in _Hildebrand’s_ Jahrb. 1864, I, 161, ff.)\r\n\r\n  942 Thus it was, for instance, in Austria, in 1811 and 1820, at 1/5 and\r\n      2/5 of the nominal value, in 1799 in the United States, in 1813 in\r\n      Denmark with the currency notes (_Courantzettel_), in 1816 in Norway\r\n      with the royal bank dollar notes, in Sweden in 1814 with the bank\r\n      notes (_Bancozetteln_) at 37-½ per cent., in 1839 in Russia with the\r\n      _bankassignationen_, at 2/7 of their nominal value. Of theoretical\r\n      writers this course is recommended among others by _Jacob_,\r\n      Staatsfinanzwissenschaft, § 980 ff.; _Nebenius_, Œff. Credit, 2\r\n      Aufl., ff.; Deutsche Vierteljahrsschrift, 1841, I, 65; _Rau_,\r\n      Lehrbuch, III, § 528; _Helferich_, Tüb. Ztschr., 1856, 435 ff.\r\n      According to _v. Rotteck_, Lehrbuch, IV 402, it may be assumed that\r\n      paper money is spread among the people of a country in proportion to\r\n      their resources: which is also the hypothesis on which all direct\r\n      taxation is based. Hence the gradual depreciation of paper money\r\n      operates like the imposition of a tax and the _reduction of value_\r\n      (_Deralvirung_) is, so to speak, only the release of the same.\r\n      Besides _Gentz_ (Werke by Schlezier, IV, 58) shows from the example\r\n      of Austria in 1811, that in the case of the taking up of a\r\n      depreciated paper currency it makes a better impression to give 100\r\n      florins in specie for 1,000 florins in paper, than 200 florins in a\r\n      new kind of paper. The holders of the old paper money have now lost\r\n      confidence in all paper currency. Of similar import is the immediate\r\n      abolition of the compulsory circulation of paper money at its\r\n      nominal value (_Prince Smith_ in _Faucher’s_ Vierteljahrsschrift,\r\n      VII, 126 ff.), and the introduction of compulsory circulation in\r\n      accordance with the day’s quotations of the actual value of the\r\n      paper as compared with specie. (_Strache_, Die Valuta in Œsterreich,\r\n      1861; _per contra_, _Ad. Wagner_, Tüb. Zeitschr., 1861, 606 ff.)\r\n\r\n  943 Such measures as were adopted in Austria, in 1811, where a\r\n      “redemption and extinction deputation,” independent of the\r\n      government was established and sworn to prevent a further increase\r\n      of paper money, are not sufficient of themselves alone.\r\n\r\n  944 The Code Civil (art. 1895) makes the nominal value entirely\r\n      conclusive; so, also, the Prussian Landrecht (I, § 790): which is to\r\n      proclaim the omnipotence and infallibility of the state power in the\r\n      most ingenuous or else in the most brutal manner. The power given by\r\n      _Puchta_ to metallic value (Pandecten, VII, aufl., § 38) is\r\n      applicable neither to paper money nor to small coin; and it ignores\r\n      entirely that stamped coins and currency money are something\r\n      different from mere metallic commodities and even from metallic\r\n      bars. The Austrian civil law (_bürgerliche Gesetzbuch_) decides in\r\n      favor of the current value (986 seq.): a view which most modern\r\n      jurists since _Savigny_ (Obligationenrecht, I, 404; earlier yet,\r\n      _Hufeland_, Ueber die rechtliche Natur des Geldschulden, 180)\r\n      entertain. But they even fail to recognize that the depreciation,\r\n      for instance, of paper money as compared with specie and general\r\n      decrease of purchasing power are identical only in the case of such\r\n      paper money or reduced coins which have no compulsory circulation.\r\n      (_A. Wagner_, Tüb. Ztschr., 1863, 478 ff.)\r\n\r\n  945 Let us suppose that at the moment the state could perform its duty\r\n      to its servants only to the extent of one half. If it should frankly\r\n      admit this, pay one-half in good money and remain in debt for the\r\n      other half, it might subsequently, in better times, make good to\r\n      them or to their heirs what it had now refused; and thus private\r\n      credit, from the disturbance of which the state can only suffer,\r\n      suffer no diminution. Both are quite different when the state\r\n      disguises its insolvency under the mask of apparent full payment in\r\n      paper money which has lost 50 per cent. of its nominal value. In\r\n      opposition to the myth that the assignats saved France, see\r\n      _Levasseur_, in the Acad. des Sc. m. et. p.\r\n\r\n  946 It not unfrequently happens that a nation’s paper money has been\r\n      directly or indirectly affected by an unfriendly state. Thus for\r\n      instance, England, in 1794, tolerated an assignat manufactory at\r\n      Lambeth, while Frenchmen imitated English bank notes. (_Archenholz_,\r\n      Aenalen XI, 429.) Napoleon in 1812 issued forged Russian bank notes.\r\n      (_Cancrin_, Œconomie der menschl. Gesellschaft, 136. _Niebuhr_,\r\n      Gesch. der Revolution, II, 314.) When Maria Theresa first wished to\r\n      introduce paper money, Bolza, her minister of finance, in his urgent\r\n      appeal to her to desist from adopting such a measure, foretold the\r\n      subsequent bankruptcy etc. (_Mailath_, Oesterr. Gesch., V., 83.)\r\n      _Adam Smith_ compares gold and silver circulation to a highway\r\n      which, indeed, produces nothing directly. Paper money is an advance\r\n      similar to that which would be produced by the construction of a\r\n      machine adapted to the carriage of persons and goods through the\r\n      air, and which permit the highways hitherto used to be turned into\r\n      meadows, arable land etc. _Ad. Smith_ very strongly emphasizes the\r\n      insecurity of these “Dædalian wings” as compared with the “solid\r\n      ground of gold and silver,” especially in the transitory misfortune\r\n      produced by war. (W. of N., II, p. 78, Bas.) _David Hume_ says of\r\n      all paper media of exchange, that they share all the harmfulness of\r\n      an increase of specie money, enhancement of the price of\r\n      commodities, aggravation of the obstacles to exportation; but that\r\n      they do not share in the useful properties of specie money.\r\n      (Discourses, On Money and on the Balance of Trade.) The younger\r\n      _Mirabeau_ kept Necker from pursuing his plan to issue paper money\r\n      with the words: _du papier monnaie c’est la peste circulante!_\r\n      Inconsistent as Napoleon was in his bank policy (compare _Horn_,\r\n      Bankfreiheit, 304), he always rejected paper money. As in 1805 he\r\n      wrote to the minister of justice: _je ne veut pas de papier\r\n      monnaie_: so, in opposition to the minister of the interior, he in\r\n      1810 compared it to the plague: _le plus grandfléau des nations_.\r\n      (Acad. des Sciences m. et p., 1864, II, 212.) _Sismondi_, too,\r\n      compares paper money to the paper cannons of the Chinese, which\r\n      render a cheap service until the hour of danger comes. (N.\r\n      Principles, II, 107.) Of the banks he says: _les avantages\r\n      aussi-legers les dangers aussi graves_. (Eludes, II. 421).\r\n      _Cancrin_, Œkonomie der menschl. Gesellschaft, 1845, 152 ff., says\r\n      he thinks that possibly it might have been well never to have\r\n      established banks, but that yet the craving for the new is\r\n      preponderately good, it brings inventions and improvements with it.\r\n      Even _Tooke_ considers the insecurity of paper money a disadvantage\r\n      which more than counterbalances its cheapness. (Considerations on\r\n      the State of the Currency, 1829, 85.) On the doubts of _Jefferson_\r\n      and _Gallatin_, see _Wolowski_, Enquête, 170, seq. _Webster_ called\r\n      paper money “the most effectual of inventions to fertilize the rich\r\n      man’s field by the sweat of the poor man’s brow.” _Tout papier\r\n      monnaie par lui même est un mensonage._ (_M. Chevalier_, Cours, III,\r\n      428.) _M. Niebuhr_ calls banks a poison which should be used with\r\n      moderation. (Bankrevolution und Bankreform, 1846, 37.) Compare the\r\n      writers named in § 2.\r\n\r\n_  947 Avec la liberté un peuple n’a jamais de mauvaises monnaies_ (_F.\r\n      Lenormant_): entirely so, provided _liberté_ be translated “true and\r\n      insured freedom.”\r\n\r\n  948 Law’s giddy projects under the regents of Orleans and the assignats\r\n      of the first republic; Austria, Russia and the United States; the\r\n      Danish absolute monarchy, and Sweden, both under Charles XII., and\r\n      its oligarchical times. The history of Rhode Island paper money is\r\n      peculiarly scandalous. All debts had to be paid within two years, or\r\n      to be held invalid, and juries were dispensed with in such cases.\r\n      (_Ebeling_, Gesch. und Erdbeschreib. von N. America, II, 173 ff.)\r\n\r\n_  949 Ad. Müller_ compares “cosmopolitan” metallic money to a universal\r\n      language: paper money ties one to the country, as people do not like\r\n      to travel in foreign parts when they understand only their native\r\n      language. As paper money compels subjects to take an interest in the\r\n      state, a state like Austria would act very foolishly if it should\r\n      begin its reorganization by enhancing its depreciated values\r\n      (_Valuta_). (Elemente der Staatskunst, 180, III, 171; II, 339 ff.)\r\n      Even in 1830, he found fault with the Austrian loan for the payment\r\n      of the paper money. (Briefwechsel mit Gentz, 321 seq.) He lauded\r\n      paper money because he claimed it led a country back to the barter\r\n      And service-economy of the middle ages. (Verm. Schriften, I, 59 ff.)\r\n      Similarly, _Gentz_, in his later writings. Compare _Roscher_,\r\n      Gesch., der N. Œk., in Deutschland, II, 762.\r\n\r\n  950 Who, for instance, would lay by a paper dollar in the savings bank\r\n      for his godchild? In this respect, too, oriental countries have\r\n      preserved much of the medieval. Concerning the aversion of the\r\n      Egyptians of our day for all paper money, see _Stephan_, Ægypten,\r\n      250 seq. This is all the more surprising since during several months\r\n      after the harvest, there are from 4,000,000 to 8,000,000 piasters in\r\n      specie sent every day from Alexandria by post to private individuals\r\n      in the provinces. In addition to this there is the immense\r\n      difference in the French, English and Austrian coins circulating in\r\n      the country, and which have very different rates in the different\r\n      provinces. It is still worse in Arabia. (_v. Maltzan_, Reise, I,\r\n      27.)\r\n\r\n  951 Compare _v. Schlozer_, Anfangsgründe, I, 140 ff. _M. Niebuhr_ (Rau’s\r\n      Archiv. N.F. II, 125) finds paper money best adapted to countries\r\n      without any exchange-trade, but which at the same time require a\r\n      species of money easily computed and easy of transportation\r\n      (Russia); countries whose national economy has an extraordinarily\r\n      rapid growth (the United States); and in unusually solid countries\r\n      (Scotland).\r\n\r\n_  952 List_, Nat. System der politischen Œk., I, 394. A private\r\n      individual of small means who should go on his travels without money\r\n      would be subject to all sorts of annoyances; a king or a Rothschild,\r\n      just as soon as he was recognized as such, would find credit\r\n      everywhere. Thus, English businessmen have outstanding claims in all\r\n      parts of the world, which might without any great difficulty be\r\n      called in in the precious metals. The more the division of labor is\r\n      developed, the better may the condition of a nation’s whole economy\r\n      be seen reflected in the course of its banking system and its\r\n      exportation and importation.",
