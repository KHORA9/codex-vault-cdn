Exclusive of changes in spelling,\r\npunctuation, and stage directions, very few emendations by eighteenth\r\ncentury and nineteenth century editors have been adopted; and these,\r\nwith every variation from the First Folio, are indicated in the textual\r\nnotes. These notes are printed immediately below the text so that a\r\nreader or student may see at a glance the evidence in the case of a\r\ndisputed reading and have some definite understanding of the reasons for\r\nthose differences in the text of Shakespeare which frequently surprise\r\nand very often annoy. A consideration of the more poetical, or the more\r\ndramatically effective, of two variant readings will often lead to rich\r\nresults in awakening a spirit of discriminating interpretation and in\r\ndeveloping true creative criticism. In no sense is this a textual\r\nvariorum edition. The variants given are only those of importance and\r\nhigh authority.\r\n\r\nThe spelling and the punctuation of the text are modern, except in the\r\ncase of verb terminations in _-ed_, which, when the _e_ is silent, are\r\nprinted with the apostrophe in its place. This is the general usage in\r\nthe First Folio. Modern spelling has to a certain extent been followed\r\nin the text variants; but the original spelling has been retained\r\nwherever its peculiarities have been the basis for important textual\r\ncriticism and emendation.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the position of the textual variants, the plan of\r\nthis edition is similar to that of the old Hudson Shakespeare. It is\r\nimpossible to specify the various instances of revision and\r\nrearrangement in the matter of the Introduction and the interpretative\r\nnotes, but the endeavor has been to retain all that gave the old edition\r\nits unique place and to add the results of what seems vital and\r\npermanent in later inquiry and research.\r\n\r\nWhile it is important that the principle of _suum cuique_ be attended to\r\nso far as is possible in matters of research and scholarship, it is\r\nbecoming more and more difficult to give every man his own in\r\nShakespearian annotation. The amount of material accumulated is so great\r\nthat the identity-origin of much important comment and suggestion is\r\neither wholly lost or so crushed out of shape as to be beyond\r\nrecognition. Instructive significance perhaps attaches to this in\r\nediting the works of one who quietly made so much of materials gathered\r\nby others. But the list of authorities given on page li will indicate\r\nthe chief source of much that has gone to enrich the value of this\r\nedition. Professor W. P. Trent, of Columbia University, has offered\r\nvaluable suggestions and given important advice; and to Mr. M. Grant\r\nDaniell's patience, accuracy, and judgment this volume owes both its\r\nfreedom from many a blunder and its possession of a carefully arranged\r\nindex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n                                            PAGE\r\n\r\nI.

In citations from Shakespeare's plays and nondramatic poems the\r\nnumbering has reference to the Globe edition, except in the case of this\r\nplay, where the reference is to this edition.\r\n\r\nI. SOURCES\r\n\r\nNo event in the history of the world has made a more profound impression\r\nupon the popular imagination than the assassination of Julius Cæsar.\r\nApart from its overwhelming interest as a personal catastrophe, it was\r\nregarded in the sixteenth century as a happening of the greatest\r\nhistorical moment, fraught with significant public lessons for all time.\r\nThere is ample evidence that in England from the beginning of\r\nElizabeth's reign it was the subject of much literary and dramatic\r\ntreatment, and in making the murder of \"the mightiest Julius\" the climax\r\nof a play, Shakespeare was true to that instinct which drew him for\r\nmaterial to themes of universal and eternal interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAIN STORY\r\n\r\nI. _North's Plutarch._ There is no possible doubt that in _Julius Cæsar_\r\nShakespeare derived the great body of his historical material from _The\r\nLife of Julius Cæsar_, _The Life of Marcus Brutus_, and _The Life of\r\nMarcus Antonius_ in Sir Thomas North's translation of Plutarch.[1] This\r\nwork was first printed in 1579 in a massive folio dedicated to Queen\r\nElizabeth. A second edition appeared in 1595, and in all probability\r\nthis was the edition read by Shakespeare. The title-page is reproduced\r\nin facsimile on page ix. This interesting title-page gives in brief the\r\nliterary history of North's translation, which was made not directly\r\nfrom the original Greek of Plutarch, but from a French version by\r\nJacques Amyot, bishop of Auxerre.[2] In 1603 appeared a third edition\r\nwith additional _Lives_ and new matter on the title-page.[3] There were\r\nsubsequent editions in 1612,[4] 1631, 1656, and 1676. The popularity of\r\nthis work attested by these reprintings was thoroughly deserved, for\r\nNorth's Plutarch is among the richest and freshest monuments of\r\nElizabethan prose literature, and, apart altogether from the use made of\r\nit by Shakespeare, is in itself an invaluable repertory of honest,\r\nmanly, idiomatic English. No abstract of the Plutarchian matter need be\r\ngiven here, as all the more important passages drawn upon for the play\r\nare quoted in the footnotes to the text. These will show that in most of\r\nthe leading incidents the great Greek biographer is closely followed,\r\nthough in many cases these incidents are worked out and developed with\r\nrare fertility of invention and art. It is very significant that in the\r\nsecond half of _The Life of Julius Cæsar_, which Shakespeare draws upon\r\nvery heavily, Plutarch emphasizes those weaknesses of Cæsar which are\r\nmade so prominent in the play. Besides this, in many places the\r\nPlutarchian form and order of thought, and also the very words of\r\nNorth's racy and delectable English are retained, with such an embalming\r\nfor immortality as Shakespeare alone could give.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Professor W. W. Skeat's _Shakespeare's Plutarch_ (The\r\nMacmillan Company) gives these _Lives_ in convenient form with a text\r\nbased upon the edition of 1612.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: A Latin translation of Plutarch's _Lives_ was printed at\r\nRome as early as 1470, and there is evidence that through a Latin\r\nversion the work first attracted the attention of Amyot. But his famous\r\nFrench version, first published in 1559, shows thorough familiarity with\r\nthe original Greek text.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: This title-page is given in facsimile as the frontispiece\r\nof this volume.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: There is a famous copy of this edition in the Greenock\r\nLibrary with the initials \"W. S.\" at the top of the title-page and\r\nseventeenth century manuscript notes in _The Life of Julius Cæsar_. See\r\nSkeat's _Shakespeare's Plutarch_, Introduction, p. xii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: See Trench's _Lectures on Plutarch_, Leo's _Four Chapters\r\nof North's Plutarch_, and Delius's _Shakespeare's Julius Cæsar und seine\r\nQuellen in Plutarch_ (_Shakespeare Jahrbuch_, XVII, 67).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE LIVES\r\n  OF THE NOBLE GRECIANS\r\n  AND ROMANES, COMPARED\r\n  TOGETHER BY THAT GRAVE LEARNED\r\n  PHILOSOPHER AND HISTORIOGRAPHER,\r\n  _Plutarch of Chæronea_:\r\n  Translated out of Greeke into French by IAMES AMIOT, Abbot of\r\n  Bellozane,\r\n  Bishop of Auxerre, one of the Kings priuie counsell, and great\r\n  Amner of France, and out of French into English, by\r\n  _Thomas North_.\r\n  Imprinted at London by Richard Field for\r\n  Bonham Norton.\r\n  1595.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn _Julius Cæsar_ Shakespeare's indebtedness to North's Plutarch may be\r\nsummed up as extending to (1) the general story of the play; (2) minor\r\nincidents and happenings, as Cæsar's falling-sickness, the omens before\r\nhis death, and the writings thrown in Brutus's way; (3) touches of\r\ndetail, as in the description of Cassius's \"lean and hungry look\" and of\r\nAntony's tastes and personal habits; and (4) noteworthy expressions,\r\nphrases, and single words, as in III, ii, 240-241, 246-248; IV, iii, 2;\r\nIV, iii, 178; V, i, 80-81; V, iii, 109.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Shakespeare's alteration of Plutarchian material is\r\nalong the lines of (1) idealization, as in the characters of Brutus and\r\nCassius; (2) amplification, as in the use Antony makes of Cæsar's rent\r\nand bloody mantle; and (3) simplification and compression of the action\r\nfor dramatic effect, as in making Cæsar's triumph take place at the\r\ntime of \"the feast of Lupercal,\" in the treatment of the quarrel between\r\nBrutus and Cassius, which in Plutarch lasts for two days, and in making\r\nthe two battles of Philippi occur on the same day. See note, p. 159, ll.\r\n109-110. See also below, The Scene of the Assassination.\r\n\r\n2. _Appian's Roman Wars._ In 1578 there was published in London an\r\nEnglish translation of the extant portions of Appian's _History of the\r\nRoman Wars both Civil and Foreign_, with the interesting title page\r\nshown in facsimile on page xi.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  AN AVNCIENT\r\n  Historie and exquisite Chronicle\r\n  _of the Romanes warres, both_\r\n  Ciuile and Foren.\r\n\r\n  Written in Greeke by the noble Orator and Historiographer,\r\n  _Appian_ of _Alexandria_, one of the learned\r\n  Counsell to the most mightie Emperoures,\r\n  _Traiane_ and _Adriane_\r\n\r\n  In the which is declared:\r\n\r\n    _Their greedy desire conquere others.\r\n    Their mortall malice to destroy themselves.\r\n    Their seeking of matters to make warre abroad.\r\n    Their picking of quarels to fall out at home.\r\n    All the degrees of Sedition, and the effects of Ambition.\r\n    A firme determination of Fate, thorowe all the changes of Fortune.\r\n    And finally, an evident demonstration, That peoples rule must give\r\n    place, and Princes power prevayle._\r\n\r\n  With a continuation, bicause that parte\r\n  of _Appian_ is not extant, from the death of _Sextus\r\n  Pompeius_, second sonne to _Pompey_ the Great,\r\n  _till the overthrow of_ Antonie _and_ Cleopatra,\r\n  after the vvhich time, _Octavianus Cæsar_,\r\n  had the Lordship of all, alone.\r\n\r\n  Βασιλίδι χρἁτιϛη, δεσπὁτιδι τ' ἐπιεικἐϛατη\r\n\r\n  IMPRINTED AT LONDON\r\n  _by Raufe Newbery, and_\r\n  Henrie Bynniman.\r\n  Anno. 1578.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn this translation of Appian the events before and after Cæsar's death\r\nare described minutely and with many graphic touches. Compare, for\r\nexample, with the quotation from Plutarch given in the note, p. 68, l.\r\n33, this account of the same incident in Appian: \"The day before that\r\nCæsar should go to the senate, he had him at a banquet with Lepidus ...\r\nand talking merrily what death was best for a man, some saying one and\r\nsome another, he of all praised sudden death.\" Here are some of the\r\nmarginal summaries in Appian: \"Cæsar refuseth the name of King,\" \"A\r\ncrown upon Cæsar's image by one that was apprehended of the tribunes\r\nMarullus and Sitius,\" \"Cæsar hath the Falling-Sickness,\" \"Cæsar's Wife\r\n(hath) a fearful Dream,\" \"Cæsar contemneth sacrifices of evil Luck,\"\r\n\"Cæsar giveth over when Brutus had stricken him,\" \"The fear of the\r\nConspirators,\" \"The bad Angel of Brutus.\"\r\n\r\nWhat gives interest and distinction to Appian's translation as a\r\nprobable source for material in _Julius Cæsar_ is that in it we have\r\nspeeches by Antony, Brutus, and Lepidus at the time of the reading of\r\nCæsar's will. In this translation Antony's first speech begins, \"They\r\nthat would have voices tried upon Cæsar must know afore that if he\r\nruled as an officer lawfully chosen, then all his acts and decrees must\r\nstand in force....\" On Antony's second speech the comment is, \"Thus\r\nwrought Antony artificially.\" His speech to the Senate begins, \"Silence\r\nbeing commanded, he said thus, 'Of the citizens offenders (you men of\r\nequal honour) in this your consultation I have said nothing....'\" The\r\nspeech of Lepidus to the people has this setting: \"When he was come to\r\nthe place of speech he lamented, weeping, and thus said, 'Here I was\r\nyesterday with Cæsar, and now am I here to inquire of Cæsar's death....\r\nCæsar is gone from us, an holy and honourable man in deed.'\" The effect\r\nof this speech is commented on as follows: \"Handling the matter thus\r\ncraftily, the hired men, knowing that he was ambitious, praised him and\r\nexhorted him to take the office of Cæsar's priesthood.\" A long speech by\r\nBrutus follows the reading of Cæsar's will. It begins: \"Now, O citizens,\r\nwe be here with you that yesterday were in the common court not as men\r\nfleeing to the temple that have done amiss, nor as to a fort, having\r\ncommitted all we have to you.... We have heard what hath been objected\r\nagainst us of our enemies, touching the oath and touching cause of\r\ndoubt....\" The effect of this speech is thus described: \"Whiles Brutus\r\nthus spake, all the hearers considering with themselves that he spake\r\nnothing but right, did like them well, and as men of courage and lovers\r\nof the people, had them in great admiration and were turned into their\r\nfavour.\"\r\n\r\n3. _Earlier Plays._ As already mentioned, England had plays on the\r\nsubject of Julius Cæsar from the first years of Elizabeth's reign. As\r\nnot one of these earlier plays is extant, there can be no certainty as\r\nto whether Shakespeare drew upon them for materials or inspiration, but,\r\nas Professor Herford says, \"he seems to be cognisant of their\r\nexistence.\" His opening scene is addressed to a public familiar with the\r\nhistory of Pompey and Pompey's sons. Among these earlier plays was one\r\nalmost contemporary with the first production of _Gorboduc_, the first\r\nEnglish tragedy. It is referred to under the name of _Julyus Sesar_ in\r\nan entry in Machyn's _Diary_ under February 1, 1562. In _Plays confuted\r\nin five Actions_, printed probably in 1582, Stephen Gosson mentions the\r\nhistory of _Cæsar and Pompey_ as a contemporary play. A Latin play on\r\nCæsar's death was acted at Oxford in 1582, and for it Dr. Richard Eedes\r\n(Eades, Edes) of Christ Church wrote the epilogue (_Epilogus Cæsaris\r\nIntersecti_). In Henslowe's _Diary_ under November 8, 1594, a _Seser and\r\npompie_ is mentioned as a new play. Mr. A. W. Verity (_Julius Cæsar_,\r\nThe Pitt Press edition) makes the interesting suggestion that in III, i,\r\n111-116, there may be an allusion to these earlier plays. Cf. also\r\n_Hamlet_, III, ii, 107-111, quoted below.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCENE OF THE ASSASSINATION\r\n\r\nIn transferring the assassination of Cæsar from the _Porticus Pompeia_\r\n(\"Pompey's porch,\" I, iii, 126) to the Capitol, Shakespeare departed\r\nfrom Plutarch and historical accuracy to follow a popular tradition that\r\nhad received the signal imprimatur of Chaucer:\r\n\r\n  This Iulius to the Capitolie wente\r\n  Upon a day, as he was wont to goon,[1]\r\n  And in the Capitolie anon him hente[2]\r\n  This false Brutus, and his othere foon[3]\r\n  And stikede him with boydekins[4] anoon\r\n  With many a wounde, and thus they lete him lye;\r\n  But never gronte[5] he at no strook but oon,\r\n  Or elles at two, but if[6] his storie lye.\r\n\r\n        _The Monkes Tale_, ll. 715-718. (Skeat's _Chaucer_.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: go.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: seized.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: foes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: daggers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: groaned.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: unless.]\r\n\r\nThis literary and popular tradition is followed in _Hamlet_, III, ii,\r\n107-111:\r\n\r\n  HAMLET. What did you enact?\r\n\r\n  POLONIUS. I did enact Julius Cæsar: I was kill'd i' the Capitol:\r\n  Brutus kill'd me.\r\n\r\n  HAMLET. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there.\r\n\r\nSo also in _Antony and Cleopatra:_\r\n\r\n                    Since Julius Cæsar,\r\n  Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,\r\n  There saw you labouring for him. What was 't\r\n  That mov'd pale Cassius to conspire; and what\r\n  Made the all-honour'd, honest Roman, Brutus,\r\n  With the arm'd rest, courtiers of beauteous freedom,\r\n  To drench the Capitol; but that they would\r\n  Have one man but a man?      [II, vi, 12-19.]\r\n\r\nWe have the same popular tradition in the first scene of the last act of\r\nFletcher's _The Noble Gentleman_. So, too, in the Prologue to Beaumont\r\nand Fletcher's, or Fletcher and Massinger's, _The False One_, a tragedy\r\ndealing with Cæsar and Cleopatra:\r\n\r\n                          To tell\r\n  Of Cæsar's amorous heats, and how he fell\r\n  I' the Capitol.\r\n\r\nHere the reference is to Shakespeare's play.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"ET TU, BRUTE\"\r\n\r\nDyce and other researchers have made clear that in Shakespeare's day\r\n\"_Et tu, Brute_\" was a familiar phrase which had special reference to a\r\nwound from a supposed friend. It probably owed its popularity to having\r\nbeen used in the earlier plays on the subject of Julius Cæsar. In _The\r\nTrue Tragedie of Richard Duke of York_ (1595), upon which Shakespeare's\r\n_3 Henry VI_ is based, occurs the line,\r\n\r\n  _Et tu, Brute?_ wilt thou stab Cæsar too?\r\n\r\nThis line is repeated in S. Nicholson's poem, _Acolastus, his\r\nAfterwitte_ (1600). In Ben Jonson's _Every Man out of His Humour_\r\n(1599), Buffone uses \"_Et tu, Brute_\" in speaking to Macilente (V, iv).\r\nIn the _Myrroure for Magistrates_ (1587) we find,\r\n\r\n  And Brutus thou, my sonne, quoth I, whom erst I loved best.\r\n\r\nThe Latin form of the phrase possibly originated, as Malone suggested,\r\nin the Latin play referred to above (Earlier Plays) which was acted at\r\nOxford in 1582. It is easy to see how the Elizabethan tendency to\r\nword-quibble and equivoque would help to give currency to the Latin\r\nform. Cf. Hamlet's joke on 'brute' quoted above.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRUTUS'S SPEECH, III, ii\r\n\r\nIn view of the close connection between _Julius Cæsar_ and _Hamlet_ as\r\nregards date of composition and the characterization of Brutus and\r\nHamlet, interest attaches to Professor Gollancz's theory (_Julius\r\nCæsar_, Temple Shakespeare) that the original of the famous speech of\r\nBrutus to the assembled Romans (III, ii) may be found in Belleforest's\r\n_History of Hamlet_, in the oration which Hamlet makes to the Danes\r\nafter he has slain his uncle. \"The situation of Hamlet is almost\r\nidentical with that of Brutus after he has dealt the blow, and the\r\nburden of Hamlet's too lengthy speech finds an echo in Brutus's\r\nsententious utterance. The verbose iteration of the Dane has been\r\ncompressed to suit 'the brief compendious manner of speech of the\r\nLacedæmonians.'\"--Gollancz. As the English translation from which\r\nProfessor Gollancz quotes in support of his theory is dated 1608, and is\r\nthe earliest known,[1] it cannot have been from this that Shakespeare\r\ndrew any suggestions or material. The question arises, Did Shakespeare\r\nread the speech in the original French? The volume of Belleforest's\r\n_Histoires Tragiques_, which contained the story of Hamlet, was first\r\npublished in 1570, and there were many reprintings of it before 1600.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Reprinted in Collier's _Shakespeare's Library_. This\r\ntranslation shows in more than one place the influence of Shakespeare's\r\nplay. For example, Hamlet's exclamation before he kills Polonius, \"A\r\nrat! a rat!\" is in the English version, but there is no suggestion of it\r\nin the French original.]\r\n\r\n\r\nII. DATE OF COMPOSITION\r\n\r\nModern editors fix the date of composition of _Julius Cæsar_ within\r\n1601, the later time limit (_terminus ante quem_), and 1598, the earlier\r\ntime limit (_terminus post quem_). The weight of evidence is in favor of\r\n1600-1601.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTERNAL EVIDENCE\r\n\r\n1. _Negative._ _Julius Cæsar_ is not mentioned by Meres in the _Palladis\r\nTamia_, published in 1598, which gives a list of twelve noteworthy\r\nShakespeare plays in existence at that time. This establishes 1598 as a\r\nprobable _terminus post quem_.\r\n\r\n2. _Positive._ In John Weever's _Mirror of Martyrs or the Life and Death\r\nof Sir John Oldcastle Knight, Lord Cobham_, printed in 1601, are the\r\nfollowing lines:\r\n\r\n  The many-headed multitude were drawne\r\n  By _Brutus_ speech that _Cæsar_ was ambitious,\r\n  When eloquent _Mark Antonie_ had showne\r\n  His vertues, who but _Brutus_ then was vicious?\r\n      Man's memorie, with new, forgets the old,\r\n      One tale is good, until another's told.\r\n\r\nHalliwell-Phillipps was the first to note that here is a very pointed\r\nreference to the second scene of the third act of _Julius Cæsar_, as the\r\nantithesis brought out is not indicated in any of Shakespeare's\r\nhistorical sources. The fact that Weever states in his Dedication that\r\nthe _Mirror_ \"some two years agoe was made fit for the print\" has been\r\nheld by Mr. Percy Simpson[1] to indicate that the play was not brought\r\nout later than 1599, a conclusion supported, he thinks, by a passage in\r\nBen Jonson's _Every Man out of His Humour_, produced in that year, where\r\nClove (III, i) says, \"Then coming to the pretty animal, as _Reason long\r\nsince is fled to animals_, you know,\" which may be a sneering allusion\r\nto Antony's \"O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts\" (III, ii,\r\n104). The \"_Et tu, Brute_\" quotation in the same play has been used to\r\nstrengthen the argument. But the lines from the _Mirror of Martyrs_\r\nquoted above may easily have been inserted by Weever into his poem in\r\nconsequence of the popularity of Shakespeare's play. This contemporary\r\npopularity is well attested. Leonard Digges,[2] in his verses _Upon\r\nMaster William Shakespeare_ prefixed to the 1640 edition of\r\nShakespeare's Poems, thus compares it with that of Ben Jonson's Roman\r\nplays:\r\n\r\n  So have I seene, when Cesar would appeare,\r\n  And on the Stage at halfe-sword parley were\r\n  _Brutus_ and _Cassius_: oh how the Audience\r\n  Were ravish'd, with what new wonder they went thence,\r\n  When some new day they would not brooke a line\r\n  Of tedious (though well laboured) _Catiline_;\r\n  _Sejanus_ too was irkesome, they priz'de more\r\n  Honest _Iago_, or the jealous _Moore_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In _Notes and Queries_, February, 1899.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Leonard Digges also wrote verses \"To the Memorie of the\r\ndeceased Authour Maister W. Shakespeare,\" prefixed to the First Folio.]\r\n\r\n\"Fustian\" Clove's quotation may apply to references to the Pythagorean\r\ndoctrine of the transmigration of souls in Shakespeare's earlier plays\r\nand other Elizabethan literature; and little can be based upon the \"_Et\r\ntu, Brute_\" quotation, as Ben Jonson may have drawn it from the same\r\nsource as Shakespeare did.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Henslowe in his _Diary_ under May 22, 1602, notes\r\nthat he advanced five pounds \"in earneste of a Boocke called _sesers\r\nFalle_,\" which the dramatists Munday, Drayton, Webster, Middleton \"and\r\nthe Rest\" were composing for Lord Nottingham's Company. _Cæsar's Fall_\r\nwas plainly intended to outshine Shakespeare's popular play, but, as\r\nProfessor Herford comments, \"the lost play ... for the rival company\r\nwould have been a somewhat tardy counterblast to an old piece of 1599.\"\r\nHe adds: \"_Julius Cæsar_ was certainly not unconcerned in the revival of\r\nthe fashion for tragedies of revenge with a ghost in them, which\r\nsuddenly set in with Marston's _Antonio and Mellida_ and Chettle's\r\n_Hoffman_ in 1601.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Furnivall, a strong advocate for 1601 as the date of composition,\r\nhas suggested[1] that Essex's ill-judged rebellion against Queen\r\nElizabeth, on Sunday, February 8, 1601, was the reason of Shakespeare's\r\nproducing his _Julius Cæsar_ in that year. \"Assuredly,\" he says, \"the\r\ncitizens of London in that year who heard Shakespeare's play must have\r\nfelt the force of '_Et tu, Brute_,' and must have seen Brutus's death,\r\nwith keener and more home-felt influence than we feel and hear the\r\nthings with now.\"\r\n\r\nDrayton's revised version of his _Mortimeriados_ (1596-1597); published\r\nin 1603 under the title of _The Barons' Wars_, has a passage which\r\nstrongly resembles some lines in Antony's last speech (V, v, 73-74), but\r\ncommon property in the idea that a well-balanced mixture of the four\r\nelements (earth, air, fire, and water) produces a perfect man\r\ninvalidates any argument for the date of the play based upon this\r\nevidence. See note, p. 167, l. 73.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERNAL EVIDENCE\r\n\r\nDr. W. A. Wright[2] has argued against an earlier date than 1600 for the\r\ncomposition of _Julius Caesar_ from the use of 'eternal' for 'infernal'\r\nin I, ii, 160. See note, p. 20, l. 160. Of course there is no certainty\r\nthat Shakespeare wished to use the word 'infernal,' and, besides, if\r\nany substitution was made, it may have been at a later date. But\r\nadumbrations of _Hamlet_ everywhere in _Julius Cæsar_, the frequent\r\nreferences to Cæsar in _Hamlet_, the kinship in character of Brutus and\r\nHamlet (see note, p. 46, l. 65), the treatment of the supernatural, and\r\nthe development of the revenge motive give strong cumulative evidence\r\nthat the composition of _Julius Cæsar_ is in time very near to that of\r\n_Hamlet_, the first Shakespearian draft of which is now generally\r\nconceded to date from the first months of 1602. The diction of _Julius\r\nCæsar_, the quality of the blank verse, the style generally (see below,\r\nVersification and Diction), all point to 1601 as the probable date of\r\ncomposition. It has been said that a true taste for Shakespeare is like\r\nthe creation of a special sense; and this saying is nowhere better\r\napproved than in reference to his subtile variations of language and\r\nstyle. He began with what may be described as a preponderance of the\r\npoetic element over the dramatic. As we trace his course onward, we may\r\ndiscover a gradual rising of the latter element into greater strength\r\nand prominence, until at last it had the former in complete subjection.\r\nNow, where positive external evidence is wanting, it is mainly from the\r\nrelative strength of these elements that the probable date of the\r\nwriting may be argued. In _Julius Cæsar_ the diction is more gliding and\r\ncontinuous, and the imagery more round and amplified, than in the\r\nearlier dramas or in those known to belong to Shakespeare's latest\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In _The Academy_, September 18, 1875. See also _The Leopold\r\nShakspere_, Introduction.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Julius Cæsar_, The Clarendon Press, Introduction, p.\r\nviii.]\r\n\r\nThese distinctive notes are of a nature more easily to be felt than\r\ndescribed, and to make them felt examples will best serve. Take then a\r\npassage from the soliloquy of Brutus just after he has pledged himself\r\nto the conspiracy:\r\n\r\n                     'Tis a common proof,\r\n  That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,\r\n  Whereto the climber upward turns his face;\r\n  But when he once attains the upmost round,\r\n  He then unto the ladder turns his back,\r\n  Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees\r\n  By which he did ascend. [II, i, 21-27.]\r\n\r\nHere we have a full, rounded period in which all the elements seem to\r\nhave been adjusted, and the whole expression set in order, before any\r\npart of it was written down. The beginning foresees the end, the end\r\nremembers the beginning, and the thought and image are evolved together\r\nin an even, continuous flow. The thing is indeed perfect in its way,\r\nstill it is not in Shakespeare's latest and highest style. Now take a\r\npassage from _The Winter's Tale_:\r\n\r\n                    When you speak, sweet,\r\n  I'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,\r\n  I'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,\r\n  Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,\r\n  To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you\r\n  A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do\r\n  Nothing but that; move still, still so,\r\n  And own no other function. [IV, iv, 136-143.]\r\n\r\nHere the workmanship seems to make and shape itself as it goes along,\r\nthought kindling thought, and image prompting image, and each part\r\nneither concerning itself with what has gone before, nor with what is\r\ncoming after. The very sweetness has a certain piercing quality, and we\r\ntaste it from clause to clause, almost from word to word, as so many\r\nkeen darts of poetic rapture shot forth in rapid succession. Yet the\r\npassage, notwithstanding its swift changes of imagery and motion, is\r\nperfect in unity and continuity.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. EARLY EDITIONS\r\n\r\nFOLIOS\r\n\r\nOn November 8, 1623, Edward Blount and Isaac Jaggard obtained formal\r\nlicense to print \"Mr. William Shakespeere's Comedyes, Histories, and\r\nTragedyes, soe many of the said copies as are not formerly entered to\r\nother men.\" This is the description-entry in _The Stationers' Registers_\r\nof what is now known as the First Folio (1623), designated in the\r\ntextual notes of this edition F1. _Julius Cæsar_ is one of the plays\r\n\"not formerly entered,\"[1] and it was first printed, so far as is known,\r\nin this famous volume. It is more correctly printed than perhaps any\r\nother play in the First Folio and, as the editors of the Cambridge\r\nShakespeare suggest, \"may perhaps have been (as the preface falsely\r\nimplied that all were[2]) printed from the original manuscript of the\r\nauthor.\"[3] It stands between _Timon of Athens_ and _Macbeth_, two very\r\nbadly printed plays. The running title is _The Tragedie of Julius\r\nCæsar_, but in the \"Catalogve of the seuerall Comedies, Histories, and\r\nTragedies contained in this Volume,\" the title is given as _The Life and\r\nDeath of Julius Cæsar_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This is strong evidence that the play had not been printed\r\nat an earlier date.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: \"... Absolute in their numbers, as he conceiued them....\r\nHis mind and hand went together: And what he thought, he vttered with\r\nthat easinesse, that wee haue scarse receiued from him a blot in his\r\npapers\" (Heminge and Condell's Address \"To the great Variety of\r\nReaders,\" First Folio).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Mr. F. G. Fleay in his Shakespeare Manual (1876) argues that\r\n\"this play as we have it is an abridgement of Shakespeare's play made by\r\nBen Jonson.\"]\r\n\r\nThe Second Folio, F2 (1632), the Third Folio, F3 (1663, 1664), and the\r\nFourth Folio, F4 (1685), show few variants in the text of _Julius Cæsar_\r\nand none of importance.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE QUARTO OF 1691\r\n\r\nIn 1691 _Julius Cæsar_ appeared in quarto form. This Quarto contained\r\none famous text variant, 'hath' for 'path' in II, i, 83. Though the\r\nFolio text here offers difficulties, and modern editors have suggested\r\nmany emendations, no one has been inclined to accept the commonplace\r\nreading of the Quarto.\r\n\r\n\r\nROWE'S EDITIONS\r\n\r\nIn the Folios and in the Quarto of 1691 the play is divided into acts,\r\nbut not into scenes, though the first act is headed _Actus Primus, Scæna\r\nPrima_. The first systematic division into scenes was made by Nicholas\r\nRowe, poet laureate to George I, in the edition which he issued in six\r\noctavo volumes in 1709. In this edition Rowe, an experienced playwright,\r\nmarked the entrances and exits of the characters and introduced many\r\nstage directions and the list of dramatis personæ which has been the\r\nbasis for all later lists. A second edition in eight volumes was\r\npublished in 1714. Rowe followed very closely the text of the Fourth\r\nFolio, but modernized spelling, punctuation, and occasionally grammar.\r\nThese are the first critical editions of Shakespeare's plays.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE TITLE\r\n\r\nIt has been justly observed that Shakespeare shows much judgment in the\r\nnaming of his plays. From this observation several critics have excepted\r\n_Julius Cæsar_, pronouncing the title a misnomer, on the ground that\r\nBrutus, and not Cæsar, is the hero of it. It is indeed true that Brutus\r\nis the hero, but the play is rightly named, for Cæsar is not only the\r\nsubject but also the governing power of it throughout. He is the center\r\nand springhead of the entire action, giving law and shape to everything\r\nthat is said and done. This is manifestly true in what occurs before his\r\ndeath; and it is true in a still deeper sense afterwards, since his\r\ngenius then becomes the Nemesis or retributive Providence.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. DRAMATIC CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\n_Julius Cæsar_ is a tragedy of a normal Shakespearian type, in which is\r\nrepresented a conflict between an individual, or group of individuals,\r\nand certain forces which environ, antagonize, and overwhelm. The unity\r\nof action and of interest is the personality of Julius Cæsar. In\r\ndramatic technique the play is simple and effective. Out of masses of\r\ndetail and historical incident the dramatist has shaped a symmetrical\r\nand well-defined plot marked by (1) the exposition, or introduction, (2)\r\nthe complication, or rising action, (3) the climax, or turning point,\r\n(4) the resolution, or falling action, and (5) the catastrophe, or\r\nconclusion. It is almost a commonplace of criticism that the opening\r\nscene of a Shakespeare play strikes the keynote of the action. It\r\ncertainly does in a remarkable way in _Julius Cæsar_, introducing, on\r\nthe one side, a group of excited citizens friendly to Cæsar, and, on the\r\nother, two tribunes hostile to him. It foreshadows the\r\ncharacter-contrasts in the play and the conflict between the state and\r\nthe individual. The exposition continues through the second scene, in\r\nwhich are introduced the leading characters in significant action and\r\ninteraction. At the close of this scene Cassius lays his plans to win\r\nBrutus over to the conspiracy, and the complication, or rising action,\r\nof the drama begins. Through the last scene of the first act and the\r\nfour scenes of the second act the growth of the complication is\r\ncontinued, with brief intervals of suspense, until, in the first scene\r\nof the third act, the climax is reached in the assassination of Cæsar\r\nand the wild enthusiasm of the conspirators. With the entry of Antony's\r\nservant begins the resolution, or falling action (see note, p. 89, l.\r\n123), and from now, through intervals of long suspense and many\r\nvicissitudes,[1] the fortunes of the chief conspirators fall inevitably\r\nto the catastrophe.\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYSIS BY ACT AND SCENE[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For an interesting defense of the so-called 'dragging'\r\ntendency and episodical character of the third scene of the fourth act,\r\nsee Professor A. C. Bradley's _Shakespearean Tragedy_, pp. 55-61.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: \"It must be understood that a play can be analyzed into\r\nvery different schemes of plot. It must not be thought that one of these\r\nschemes is right and the rest wrong; but the schemes will be better or\r\nworse in proportion as--while of course representing correctly the facts\r\nof the play--they bring out more or less of what ministers to our sense\r\nof design.\"--Moulton.]\r\n\r\nI. THE EXPOSITION, OR INTRODUCTION (TYING OF THE KNOT)\r\n\r\n_Act I, Scene i._ The popularity of Cæsar with the Roman mob and the\r\njealousy of the official classes--the two motive forces of the play--are\r\nrevealed. The fickleness of the mob is shown in a spirit of comedy; the\r\nantagonism of Marullus and Flavius strikes the note of tragedy.\r\n\r\n_Act I, Scene ii, 1-304._ The supreme characters are introduced, and in\r\ntheir opening speeches each reveals his temperament and foreshadows the\r\npart which he will play. The exposition of the situation is now\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE COMPLICATION, RISING ACTION, OR GROWTH (TYING OF THE KNOT)\r\n\r\n_Act I, Scene ii, 305-319._ In soliloquy Cassius unfolds his scheme for\r\nentangling Brutus in the conspiracy, and the dramatic complication\r\nbegins.\r\n\r\n_Act I, Scene iii._ Casca, excited by the fiery portents that bode\r\ndisaster to the state, is persuaded by Cassius to join \"an enterprise of\r\nhonourable-dangerous consequence\" (lines 123-124). The conspirators are\r\nassigned to their various posts, and Cassius engages to secure Brutus\r\nbefore morning.\r\n\r\n_Act II, Scene i._ The humane character of Brutus, as master, husband,\r\nand citizen, is elaborated, and his attitude to Cæsar and the conspiracy\r\nof assassination clearly shown. He joins the conspirators--apparently\r\ntheir leader, in reality their tool. In lines 162-183 he pleads that the\r\nlife of Antony be spared, and thus unconsciously prepares for his own\r\nruin.\r\n\r\n_Act II, Scene ii._ Cæsar is uneasy at the omens and portents, and gives\r\nheed to Calpurnia's entreaties to remain at home, but he yields to the\r\nimportunity of Decius and starts for the Capitol, thus advancing the\r\nplans of the conspirators. The dramatic contrast between Cæsar and\r\nBrutus is strengthened by that between Calpurnia in this scene and\r\nPortia in the preceding.\r\n\r\n_Act II, Scene iii._ The dramatic interest is intensified by the warning\r\nof Artemidorus and the suggestion of a way of escape for the\r\nprotagonist.\r\n\r\n_Act II, Scene iv._ The interest is further intensified by the way in\r\nwhich readers and spectators are made to share the anxiety of Portia.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE CLIMAX, CRISIS, OR TURNING POINT (THE KNOT TIED)\r\n\r\n_Act III, Scene i, 1-122._ The dramatic movement is now rapid, and the\r\ntension, indicated by the short whispered sentences of all the speakers\r\nexcept Cæsar, is only increased by his imperial utterances, which show\r\nutter unconsciousness of the impending doom. In the assassination all\r\nthe complicating forces--the self-confidence of Cæsar, the unworldly\r\npatriotism of Brutus, the political chicanery of Cassius, the\r\nunscrupulousness of Casca, and the fickleness of the mob--bring about an\r\nevent which changes the lives of all the characters concerned and\r\nthreatens the stability of the Roman nation. The death of Cæsar is the\r\nclimax of the physical action of the play; it is at the same time the\r\nemotional crisis from which Brutus comes with altered destiny.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE RESOLUTION, FALLING ACTION, OR CONSEQUENCE (THE UNTYING OF THE\r\nKNOT)\r\n\r\n_Act III, Scene i, 123-298._ With Brutus's \"Soft! who comes here? A\r\nfriend of Antony's\" begins the resolution, or falling action, of the\r\nplay. \"The fortune of the conspirators, hitherto in the ascendant, now\r\ndeclines, while 'Cæsar's spirit' surely and steadily prevails against\r\nthem.\"--Verity. Against the advice of Cassius, Brutus gives Antony\r\npermission to deliver a public funeral oration. Antony in a soliloquy\r\nshows his determination to avenge Cæsar, and the first scene of the\r\nfalling action closes with the announcement that Octavius is within\r\nseven leagues of Rome.\r\n\r\n_Act III, Scene ii--Scene iii._ The orations of Antony, in vivid\r\ncontrast to the conciliatory but unimpassioned speeches of Brutus, fire\r\nthe people and liberate fresh forces in the falling action. Brutus and\r\nCassius have to fly the city, riding \"like madmen through the gates of\r\nRome.\" In unreasoning fury the mob tears to pieces an innocent poet who\r\nhas the same name as a conspirator.\r\n\r\n_Act IV, Scene i._ Antony, Octavius, and Lepidus, having formed a\r\ntriumvirate of which Antony is the master spirit, agree on a\r\nproscription list and join forces against Brutus and Cassius, who \"are\r\nlevying powers.\"\r\n\r\n_Act IV, Scene ii._ Brutus and Cassius, long parted by pride and\r\nobstinacy, meet to discuss a plan of action.\r\n\r\n_Act IV, Scene iii._ This is one of the most famous individual scenes in\r\nShakespeare (see note, page 123). Its intensely human interest is always\r\nconceded, but its dramatic propriety, because of what seems a 'dragging'\r\ntendency, has been often questioned. The scene opens with Brutus and\r\nCassius bandying recriminations, and the quarrel of the two generals\r\nbodes disaster to their cause. As the discussion proceeds, they yield\r\npoints and become reconciled. Brutus then quietly but with peculiar\r\npathos tells of Portia's death by her own hand. In all the great\r\ntragedies, with the notable exception of _Othello_, when the forces of\r\nthe resolution, or falling action, are gathering towards the dénouement,\r\nShakespeare introduces a scene which appeals to an emotion different\r\nfrom any of those excited elsewhere in the play. \"As a rule this new\r\nemotion is pathetic; and the pathos is not terrible or lacerating, but,\r\neven if painful, is accompanied by the sense of beauty and by an outflow\r\nof admiration or affection, which come with an inexpressible sweetness\r\nafter the tension of the crisis and the first counter-stroke. So it is\r\nwith the reconciliation of Brutus and Cassius, and the arrival of the\r\nnews of Portia's death.\"--Bradley. While the shadow of her tragic\r\npassing overhangs the spirits of both, Brutus overhears the shrewd,\r\ncautious counsel of Cassius and persuades him to assent to the fatal\r\npolicy of offering battle at Philippi. That night the ghost of Cæsar\r\nappears to Brutus.\r\n\r\n_Act V, Scene i._ The action now falls rapidly to the quick, decisive\r\nmovement of the dénouement. The antagonists are now face to face. Brutus\r\nand Cassius have done what Antony and Octavius hoped that they would do.\r\nThe opposing generals hold a brief parley in which Brutus intimates that\r\nhe is willing to effect a reconciliation, but Antony rejects his\r\nproposals and bluntly charges him and Cassius with the wilful murder of\r\nCæsar. Cassius reminds Brutus of his warning that Antony should have\r\nfallen when Cæsar did. Antony, Octavius, and their army retire, and the\r\nscene closes with the noble farewell without hope between Brutus and\r\nCassius.\r\n\r\n_Act V, Scene ii._ The opposing armies meet on the field, and a final\r\nflare-up of hope in the breast of Brutus is indicated by his spirited\r\norder to Messala to charge. The scene implies that Cassius was defeated\r\nby being left without support by Brutus.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. DÉNOUEMENT, CATASTROPHE, OR CONCLUSION (THE KNOT UNTIED)\r\n\r\n_Act V, Scene iii._ The charge ordered by Brutus has been successful,\r\nand Octavius has been driven back, but Cassius is thus left unguarded,\r\nand Antony's forces surround him. He takes refuge on a hill and sends\r\nTitinius to see \"whether yond troops are friend or enemy.\" Believing\r\nTitinius to be slain, he begs Pindarus to stab him, and Cassius dies\r\n\"even with the sword that kill'd\" Cæsar. With the same sword Titinius\r\nthen slays himself, and Brutus, when Messala bears the news to him,\r\nexclaims in words that strike the keynote of the whole falling action\r\nand dénouement:\r\n\r\n  O Julius Cæsar, thou art mighty yet!\r\n  Thy spirit walks abroad, and turns our swords\r\n  In our own proper entrails.\r\n\r\n_Act V, Scene iv._ Like Hamlet, Brutus at the last is a man of supreme\r\naction. He rallies his forces for a last attack. With hopeless failure\r\nbefore him, he is at once a heroic figure and one of infinite pathos.\r\nYoung Cato falls. Lucilius is attacked; assuming the name of Brutus, he\r\nis not killed but taken prisoner. Antony recognizes him and gives orders\r\nthat he be treated kindly.\r\n\r\n_Act V, Scene v._ Brutus dies by his own sword, and his last words tell\r\nthe story of failure and defeat. Like a true Roman, he meets his doom\r\nwithout a murmur of complaint. He had been true to his ideals. The\r\ntragic dénouement comes as the inevitable consequence, not of wilful\r\nsin, but of a noble mistake. In death he commands the veneration of both\r\nAntony and Octavius, who pronounce over his body the great\r\ninterpretation of his character, and in their speeches the tragedy\r\ncloses as with a chant of victory for the hero of defeat.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. MANAGEMENT OF TIME AND PLACE\r\n\r\n1. _Historic time._ Cæsar's triumph over the sons of Pompey was\r\ncelebrated in October, B.C. 45. Shakespeare makes this coincident with\r\n\"the feast of Lupercal\" on February 15, B.C. 44. In the play Antony\r\ndelivers his funeral oration immediately after Cæsar's death;\r\nhistorically, there was an interval of days. Octavius did not reach Rome\r\nuntil upwards of two months after the assassination; in III, ii, 261,\r\nAntony is told by his servant immediately after the funeral oration that\r\n\"Octavius is already come to Rome.\" In November, B.C. 43, the triumvirs\r\nmet to make up their bloody proscription, and in the autumn of the\r\nfollowing year were fought the two battles of Philippi, separated\r\nhistorically by twenty days, but represented by Shakespeare as taking\r\nplace on the same day.\r\n\r\n2. _Dramatic Time._ Historical happenings that extended over nearly\r\nthree years are represented in the stage action as the occurrences of\r\nsix days, distributed over the acts and scenes as follows:\r\n\r\n  Day 1.--I, i, ii.\r\n      Interval.\r\n  Day 2.--I, iii.\r\n  Day 3.--II, III.\r\n      Interval.\r\n  Day 4.--IV, i.\r\n      Interval.\r\n  Day 5.--IV, ii, iii.\r\n      Interval.\r\n  Day 6.--V.\r\n\r\nThis compression for the purposes of dramatic unity results in action\r\nthat is swift and throbbing with human and ethical interest.\r\n\r\n3. _Place._ Up to the second scene of the fourth act Rome is the natural\r\nplace of action. The second and third scenes of the fourth act are at\r\nSardis in Asia Minor; the last act shifts to Philippi in Macedonia. The\r\nonly noteworthy deviation from historical accuracy is in making the\r\nconference of the triumvirs take place at Rome and not at Bononia. See\r\nnote, p. 116. But there is peculiar dramatic effectiveness in placing\r\nthis fateful colloquy in the city that was the center of the political\r\nunrest of the time.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. VERSIFICATION AND DICTION\r\n\r\nBLANK VERSE\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of Shakespeare's blank verse--the rhymeless, iambic\r\nfive-stress (decasyllabic) verse, or iambic pentameter, introduced into\r\nEngland by Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, about 1540--and its proportion\r\nto rhyme and to prose have been much used in recent years to determine\r\nthe chronological order of the plays and the development of the poet's\r\nart. In blank verse as used by Shakespeare we have really an epitome of\r\nthe development of the measure in connection with the English drama. In\r\nhis earlier plays the blank verse is often similar to that of\r\n_Gorboduc_, the first English tragedy. The tendency is to adhere to the\r\nsyllable-counting principle, to make the line the unit, the sentence and\r\nphrase coinciding with the line (end-stopped verse), and to use five\r\nperfect iambic feet to the line. In plays of the middle period, such as\r\n_The Merchant of Venice_ and _As You Like It_, written between 1596 and\r\n1600, the blank verse is more like that of Kyd and Marlowe, with less\r\nmonotonous regularity in the structure and an increasing tendency to\r\ncarry on the sense from one line to another without a syntactical or\r\nrhetorical pause at the end of the line (run-on verse, _enjambement_).\r\nRedundant syllables now abound and the melody is richer and fuller. In\r\nShakespeare's later plays the blank verse breaks away from all bondage\r\nto formal line limits, and the organic continuity is found in a\r\nsuccession of great metrical periods.\r\n\r\nThe verse of _Julius Cæsar_ is less monotonously regular than that of\r\nthe earlier plays; it is more flexible and varied, more musical and\r\nsonorous, but it lacks the superb movement of the verse in _Othello_,\r\n_The Winter's Tale_, and _The Tempest_. End-stopped, normally regular\r\niambic pentameter lines often occur (as, for instance, I, i, 37, 41, 44,\r\n62, 76), but everywhere are variations and deviations from the norm, and\r\nthere is an unusual number of short lines and interjectional lines of\r\ntwo or three stresses. See Abbott's _A Shakespearian Grammar_, §§ 511,\r\n512.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHYME\r\n\r\nApart from the use of rhyme in songs, lyrics, and portions of masques\r\n(as in _The Tempest_, IV, i, 60-138), a progress from more to less rhyme\r\nis a sure index to Shakespeare's development as a dramatist and a master\r\nof expression. In the early _Love's Labour's Lost_ are more than one\r\nthousand rhyming five-stress iambic lines; in _The Tempest_ are only\r\ntwo; in _The Winter's Tale_ not one. _In Julius Cæsar_ are found only\r\nthirty-four rhyming lines.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROSE\r\n\r\nIf \"of the soule the bodie forme doth take,\" it is small wonder that\r\nattempts have been made to explain Shakespeare's distinctive use of\r\nverse and prose. Of recent years there have been interesting discussions\r\nof the question \"whether we are justified in supposing that Shakespeare\r\nwas guided by any fixed principle in his employment of verse and prose,\r\nor whether he merely employed them, as fancy suggested, for the sake of\r\nvariety and relief.\"[1] It is a significant fact that in many of\r\nShakespeare's earlier plays there is little or no prose, and that the\r\nproportion of prose to blank verse increases with the decrease of rhyme.\r\nIn _Julius Cæsar_ three kinds of prose may be distinguished: (1) The\r\nprose of homely dialogue, as in the talk of the common people in I, i,\r\nand III, iii. (2) The prose of serious information as to the nature of a\r\nsituation, as in Casca's description of the offer of the crown to Cæsar.\r\nThis kind of prose reaches its highest development in Brutus's famous\r\nspeech, III, ii, with its dignified defense and laconic exposition of\r\nhis honesty of purpose. (3) The prose of formal documents, as in the\r\nletter of Artemidorus, II, iii, 1-8.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Professor J. Churton Collins's _Shakespeare as a Prose\r\nWriter_. See Delius's _Die Prosa in Shakespeares Dramen (Shakespeare\r\nJahrbuch_, V, 227-273); Janssen's _Die Prosa in Shakespeares Dramen_;\r\nProfessor Hiram Corson's _An Introduction to the Study of Shakespeare_,\r\npp. 83-98.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. THE CHARACTERS\r\n\r\nJULIUS CÆSAR\r\n\r\nThe characterization of this drama in some of the parts is not a little\r\nperplexing. Hardly one of the speeches put into Cæsar's mouth can be\r\nregarded as historically characteristic; taken all together, they seem\r\nlittle short of a caricature. As here represented, Cæsar appears little\r\nbetter than a braggart; and when he speaks, it is in the style of a\r\nglorious vapourer, full of lofty airs and mock thunder. Nothing could\r\nbe further from the truth of the man, whose character, even in his\r\nfaults, was as compact and solid as adamant, and at the same time as\r\nlimber and ductile as the finest gold. Certain critics have seized and\r\nworked upon this, as proving Shakespeare's lack of classical knowledge,\r\nor carelessness in the use of his authorities. It proves neither the one\r\nnor the other.\r\n\r\nIt is true, Cæsar's ambition was gigantic, but none too much so for the\r\nmind it dwelt in; for his character in all its features was gigantic.\r\nAnd no man ever framed his ambition more in sympathy with the great\r\nforces of nature, or built it upon a deeper foundation of political\r\nwisdom and insight. Now this \"last infirmity of noble minds\" is the only\r\npart of him that the play really sets before us; and even this we do not\r\nsee as it was, because it is here severed from the constitutional\r\npeerage of his gifts and virtues; all those transcendent qualities which\r\nplaced him at the summit of Roman intellect and manhood being either\r\nwithheld from the scene or thrown so far into the background that the\r\nproper effect of them is lost.\r\n\r\nYet we have ample proof that Shakespeare understood Cæsar thoroughly,\r\nand that he regarded him as \"the noblest man that ever lived in the tide\r\nof times.\" For example, in _Hamlet_, he makes Horatio, who is one of his\r\ncalmest and most right-thinking characters, speak of him as \"the\r\nmightiest Julius.\" In _Antony and Cleopatra_, again, the heroine is made\r\nto describe him as \"broad-fronted Cæsar\"; and in _King Richard the\r\nThird_ the young Prince utters these lines:\r\n\r\n  That Julius Cæsar was a famous man:\r\n  With what his valour did enrich his wit,\r\n  His wit set down to make his valour live:\r\n  Death makes no conquest of this conqueror. [III, i, 84-87.]\r\n\r\nIn fact, we need not go beyond Shakespeare to gather that Julius Cæsar's\r\nwas the deepest, the most versatile, and the most multitudinous head\r\nthat ever figured in the political affairs of mankind.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is clear from this play itself that Shakespeare did not\r\nproceed at all from ignorance or misconception of the man. For it is\r\nremarkable that, though Cæsar delivers himself so out of character, yet\r\nothers, both foes and friends, deliver him much nearer the truth; so\r\nthat, while we see almost nothing of him directly, we nevertheless get,\r\nupon the whole, a just reflection of him. Especially in the marvelous\r\nspeeches of Antony and in the later events of the drama, both his inward\r\ngreatness and his right of mastership over the Roman world are fully\r\nvindicated. For in the play as in the history, Cæsar's blood hastens and\r\ncements the empire which the conspirators thought to prevent. They soon\r\nfind that in the popular sympathies, and even in their own dumb\r\nremorses, he has \"left behind powers that will work for him.\" He proves,\r\nindeed, far mightier in death than in life; as if his spirit were become\r\nat once the guardian angel of his cause and an avenging angel to his\r\nfoes.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was in fact. Nothing did so much to set the people in love\r\nwith royalty, both name and thing, as the reflection that their beloved\r\nCæsar, the greatest of their national heroes, the crown and consummation\r\nof Roman genius and character, had been murdered for aspiring to it.\r\nThus their hereditary aversion to kingship was all subdued by the\r\nremembrance of how and why their Cæsar fell; and they who, before, would\r\nhave plucked out his heart rather than he should wear a crown, would now\r\nhave plucked out their own, to set a crown upon his head. Such is the\r\nnatural result, when the intensities of admiration and compassion meet\r\ntogether in the human breast.\r\n\r\nFrom all which it may well be thought that Cæsar was too great for the\r\nhero of a drama, since his greatness, if brought forward in full\r\nmeasure, would leave no room for anything else, at least would preclude\r\nany proper dramatic balance and equipoise. It was only as a sort of\r\nunderlying potency, or a force withdrawn into the background, that his\r\npresence was compatible with that harmony and reciprocity of several\r\ncharacters which a well-ordered drama requires. At all events, it is\r\npretty clear that, where he was, such figures as Brutus and Cassius\r\ncould never be very considerable, save as his assassins. They would not\r\nhave been heard of in after times, if they had not \"struck the foremost\r\nman of all this world\"; in other words, the great sun of Rome had to be\r\nshorn of his beams, else so ineffectual a fire as Brutus could nowise\r\ncatch the eye.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, there is no doubt that Shakespeare knew the whole\r\nheight and compass of Cæsar's vast and varied capacity. It may be\r\nregretted that he did not render him as he evidently saw him, inasmuch\r\nas he alone, perhaps, of all the men who ever wrote could have given an\r\nadequate expression of that colossal man.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the policy of the drama may have been to represent\r\nCæsar not as he was indeed, but as he must have appeared to the\r\nconspirators; to make us see him as they saw him, in order that they too\r\nmight have fair and equal judgment at our hands. For Cæsar was literally\r\ntoo great to be seen by them, save as children often see bugbears by\r\nmoonlight, when their inexperienced eyes are mocked with air. And\r\nShakespeare may well have judged that the best way to set us right\r\ntowards them was by identifying us more or less with them in mental\r\nposition, and making us share somewhat in their delusion. For there is\r\nscarce anything wherein we are so apt to err as in reference to the\r\ncharacters of men, when time has settled and cleared up the questions in\r\nwhich they lost their way: we blame them for not having seen as we see;\r\nwhile in truth the things that are so bathed in light to us were full of\r\ndarkness to them, and we should have understood them better, had we been\r\nin the dark along with them.\r\n\r\nCæsar, indeed, was not bewildered by the political questions of his\r\ntime; but all the rest were, and therefore he seemed so to them; and\r\nwhile their own heads were swimming they naturally ascribed his seeming\r\nbewilderment to a dangerous intoxication. As for his marvelous career of\r\nsuccess, they attributed this mainly to his good luck, such being the\r\ncommon refuge of inferior minds when they would escape the sense of\r\ntheir inferiority. Hence, as generally happens with the highest order of\r\nmen, his greatness had to wait the approval of later events. He indeed,\r\nfar beyond any other man of his age, \"looked into the seeds of time\";\r\nbut this was not, and could not be known, till time had developed those\r\nseeds into their fruits. Why then may not Shakespeare's idea have been\r\nso to order things that the full strength of the man should not appear\r\nin the play, as it did not in fact, till after his fall? This view will\r\nboth explain and justify the strange disguise--a sort of falsetto\r\ngreatness--under which Cæsar exhibits himself.\r\n\r\nNow the seeming contradiction between Cæsar as known and Cæsar as\r\nrendered by Shakespeare is what, more than anything else, perplexes.\r\nBut a very refined, subtile, and peculiar irony pervades this, more than\r\nany other of Shakespeare's plays; not intended as such, indeed, by the\r\nspeakers, but a sort of historic irony,--the irony of Providence, so to\r\nspeak, or, if you please, of Fate; much the same as is implied in the\r\nproverb, \"A haughty spirit goeth before a fall.\" This irony crops out in\r\nmany places. Thus we have Cæsar most blown with arrogance and godding it\r\nin the loftiest style when the daggers of the assassins are on the very\r\npoint of leaping at him. So too, all along, we find Brutus most\r\nconfident in those very things where he is most at fault, or acting like\r\na man \"most ignorant of what he's most assured\"; as when he says that\r\n\"Antony can do no more than Cæsar's arm when Cæsar's head is off.\" This,\r\nto be sure, is not meant ironically by him, but it is turned into irony\r\nby the fact that Antony soon tears the cause of the conspirators all to\r\npieces with his tongue. But, indeed, this sort of honest guile runs all\r\nthrough the piece as a perfusive and permeating efficacy. A still better\r\ninstance of it occurs just after the murder, when the chiefs of the\r\nconspiracy are exulting in the transcendent virtue and beneficence of\r\ntheir deed, and in its future stage celebrity; and Cassius says,--\r\n\r\n  So often shall the knot of us be call'd\r\n  The men that gave their country liberty. [III, i, 118-119.]\r\n\r\nand again, a little later, when Brutus says of Antony, \"I know that we\r\nshall have him well to friend.\" Not indeed that the men themselves\r\nthought any irony in those speeches: it was natural, no doubt, that they\r\nshould utter such things in all seriousness; but what they say is\r\ninterpreted into irony by the subsequent events. And when such a\r\nshallow idealist as Brutus is made to overtop and outshine the greatest\r\npractical genius the world ever saw, what is it but a refined and\r\nsubtile irony at work on a much larger scale, and diffusing itself,\r\nsecretly, it may be, but not the less vitally, into the texture? It was\r\nnot the frog that thought irony, when he tried to make himself as big as\r\nthe ox; but there was a pretty decided spice of irony in the mind that\r\nconceived the fable.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted further that Brutus uniformly speaks of Cæsar with\r\nrespect, almost indeed with admiration. It is his ambition, not his\r\ngreatness, that Brutus resents; the thought that his own consequence is\r\nimpaired by Cæsar's elevation having no influence with him. With\r\nCassius, on the contrary, impatience of his superiority is the ruling\r\nmotive: he is all the while thinking of the disparagement he suffers by\r\nCæsar's exaltation.\r\n\r\n                            This man\r\n  Is now become a god, and Cassius is\r\n  A wretched creature, and must bend his body\r\n  If Cæsar carelessly but nod on him. [I, ii, 115-118.]\r\n\r\n  Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world\r\n  Like a Colossus, and we petty men\r\n  Walk under his huge legs. [I, ii, 135-137.]\r\n\r\nThus he overflows with mocking comparisons, and finds his pastime in\r\nflouting at Cæsar as having managed by a sham heroism to hoodwink the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAnd yet Shakespeare makes Cæsar characterize himself very much as\r\nCassius, in his splenetic temper, describes him. Cæsar gods it in his\r\ntalk, as if on purpose to approve the style in which Cassius mockingly\r\ngods him. This, taken by itself, would look as if the dramatist sided\r\nwith Cassius; yet one can hardly help feeling that he sympathized rather\r\nin Antony's great oration. And the sequel, as we have seen, justifies\r\nAntony's opinion of Cæsar. The subsequent course of things has the\r\neffect of inverting the mockery of Cassius against himself.\r\n\r\nThe final issue of the conspiracy, as represented by Shakespeare, is a\r\npretty conclusive argument of the blunder, not to say the crime, of its\r\nauthors. Cæsar, dead, tears them and their cause all to pieces. In\r\neffect, they did but stab him into a mightier life; so that Brutus might\r\nwell say, as indeed he does at last,--\r\n\r\n  O Julius Cæsar, thou art mighty yet!\r\n  Thy spirit walks abroad, and turns our swords\r\n  In our own proper entrails. [V, iii, 94-96.]\r\n\r\nThe Nemesis which asserts itself so sternly in the latter part of the\r\nplay may be regarded as a reflex of irony on some of the earlier scenes.\r\nThis view infers the disguise of Cæsar to be an instance of the profound\r\nguile with which Shakespeare sometimes plays upon his characters,\r\nhumoring their bent, and then leaving them to the discipline of events.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRUTUS\r\n\r\nColeridge has a shrewd doubt as to what sort of a character Shakespeare\r\nmeant his Brutus to be. For, in his thinking aloud just after the\r\nbreaking of the conspiracy to him, Brutus avowedly grounds his purpose,\r\nnot on anything Cæsar has done, nor on what he is, but simply on what he\r\n_may become_ when crowned. He \"knows no personal cause to spurn at him\";\r\nnor has he \"known when his affections sway'd more than his reason\"; but\r\n\"he would be crown'd: how that might change his nature, there's the\r\nquestion\"; and,\r\n\r\n                         Since the quarrel\r\n  Will bear no colour for the thing he is,\r\n  Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,\r\n  Would run to these and these extremities;\r\n  And therefore think him as a serpent's egg\r\n  Which, hatch'd, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,\r\n  And kill him in the shell. [II, i, 28-34.]\r\n\r\nSo then Brutus heads a plot to assassinate the man who, besides being\r\nclothed with the sanctions of law as the highest representative of the\r\nstate, has been his personal friend and benefactor; all this, too, not\r\non any ground of fact, but on an assumed probability that the crown will\r\nprove a sacrament of evil, and transform him into quite another man. A\r\nstrange piece of casuistry indeed! but nowise unsuited to the spirit of\r\na man who was to commit the gravest of crimes, purely from a misplaced\r\nvirtue.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the character of Brutus is full of beauty and sweetness. In all\r\nthe relations of life he is upright, gentle, and pure; of a\r\nsensitiveness and delicacy of principle that cannot bosom the slightest\r\nstain; his mind enriched and fortified with the best extractions of\r\nphilosophy; a man adorned with all the virtues which, in public and\r\nprivate, at home and in the circle of friends, win respect and charm the\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nBeing such a man, of course he could only do what he did under some sort\r\nof delusion. And so indeed it is. Yet this very delusion serves,\r\napparently, to ennoble and beautify him, as it takes him and works upon\r\nhim through his virtues. At heart he is a real patriot, every inch of\r\nhim. But his patriotism, besides being somewhat hidebound with\r\npatrician pride, is of the speculative kind, and dwells, where his whole\r\ncharacter has been chiefly formed, in a world of poetical and\r\nphilosophic ideals. He is an enthusiastic student of books. Plato is his\r\nfavorite teacher; and he has studiously framed his life and tuned his\r\nthoughts to the grand and pure conceptions won from that all but divine\r\nsource: Plato's genius walks with him in the Senate, sits with him at\r\nthe fireside, goes with him to the wars, and still hovers about his\r\ntent.\r\n\r\nHis great fault, then, lies in supposing it his duty to be meddling with\r\nthings that he does not understand. Conscious of high thoughts and just\r\ndesires, but with no gift of practical insight, he is ill fitted to\r\n\"grind among the iron facts of life.\" In truth, he does not really see\r\nwhere he is; the actual circumstances and tendencies amidst which he\r\nlives are as a book written in a language he cannot read. The characters\r\nof those who act with him are too far below the region of his principles\r\nand habitual thinkings for him to take the true cast of them. Himself\r\nincapable of such motives as govern them, he just projects and suspends\r\nhis ideals in them, and then misreckons upon them as realizing the men\r\nof his own brain. So also he clings to the idea of the great and free\r\nrepublic of his fathers, the old Rome that has ever stood to his\r\nfeelings touched with the consecrations of time and glorified with the\r\nhigh virtues that have grown up under her cherishing. But, in the long\r\nreign of tearing faction and civil butchery, that which he worships has\r\nbeen substantially changed, the reality lost. Cæsar, already clothed\r\nwith the title and the power of Imperator for life, would change the\r\nform so as to agree with the substance, the name so as to fit the thing.\r\nBut Brutus is so filled with the idea of that which has thus passed\r\naway never to return that he thinks to save or recover the whole by\r\npreventing such formal and nominal change.\r\n\r\nAnd so his whole course is that of one acting on his own ideas, not on\r\nthe facts that are before and around him. Indeed, he does not _see_\r\nthem; he merely dreams his own meaning into them. He is swift to do that\r\nby which he thinks his country _ought to be benefited_. As the killing\r\nof Cæsar stands in his purpose, he and his associates are to be\r\n\"sacrificers, not butchers.\" But that the deed may have the effect he\r\nhopes for, his countrymen generally must regard it in the same light as\r\nhe does. That they will do this is the very thing which he has _in fact_\r\nno reason to conclude; notwithstanding, because it is so _in his idea_,\r\ntherefore he trusts that the conspirators will \"be called purgers, not\r\nmurderers.\" Meanwhile, the plain truth is, that if his countrymen had\r\nbeen capable of regarding the deed as a sacrifice, they would not have\r\nmade nor permitted any occasion for it. It is certain that, unless so\r\nconstrued, the act must prove fruitful of evil; all Rome is full of\r\nthings proving that it cannot be so construed; but this is what Brutus\r\nhas no eye to see.\r\n\r\nSo too, in his oration \"to show the _reason_ of our Cæsar's death,\" he\r\nspeaks, in calm and dispassionate manner, just those things which he\r\nthinks ought to set the people right and himself right in their eyes,\r\nforgetting all the while that the deed cannot fail to make the people\r\nmad, and that popular madness is not a thing to be reasoned with. And\r\nfor the same cause he insists on sparing Antony, and on permitting him\r\nto speak in Cæsar's funeral. To do otherwise would be unjust, and so\r\nwould overthrow the whole nature of the enterprise as it lives in his\r\nmind. And because in his idea it ought so to be, he trusts that Antony\r\nwill make Cæsar's death the occasion of strengthening those who killed\r\nhim, not perceiving the strong likelihood, which soon passes into a\r\nfact, that in cutting off Cæsar they have taken away the only check on\r\nAntony's ambition. He ought to have foreseen that Antony, instead of\r\nbeing drawn to their side, would rather make love to Cæsar's place at\r\ntheir expense.\r\n\r\nThus the course of Brutus serves no end but to set on foot another civil\r\nwar, which naturally hastens and assures the very thing he sought to\r\nprevent. He confides in the goodness of his cause, not considering that\r\nthe better the cause, the worse its chance with bad men. He thinks it\r\nsafe to trust others because he knows they can safely trust him; the\r\nsingleness of his own eye causing him to believe that others will see as\r\nhe sees, the purity of his own heart, that others will feel as he feels.\r\n\r\nHere then we have a strong instance of a very good man doing a very bad\r\nthing; and, withal, of a wise man acting most unwisely because his\r\nwisdom knew not its place; a right noble, just, heroic spirit bearing\r\ndirectly athwart the virtues he worships. On the whole, it is not\r\nwonderful that Brutus should have exclaimed, as he is said to have done,\r\nthat he had worshiped virtue and found her at last but a shade. So\r\nworshiped, she may well prove a shade indeed! Admiration of the man's\r\ncharacter, reprobation of his proceedings,--which of these is the\r\nstronger with us? And there is much the same irony in the representation\r\nof Brutus as in that of Cæsar; only the order of it is here reversed. As\r\nif one should say, \"O yes, yes! in the practical affairs of mankind your\r\ncharming wisdom of the closet will doubtless put to shame the workings\r\nof mere practical insight and sagacity.\"\r\n\r\nShakespeare's exactness in the minutest details of character is well\r\nshown in the speech already referred to; which is the utterance of a man\r\nphilosophizing most unphilosophically; as if the Academy should betake\r\nitself to the stump, and this too without any sense of the incongruity.\r\nPlutarch has a short passage which served as a hint, not indeed for the\r\nmatter, but for the style of that speech. \"They do note,\" says he, \"in\r\nsome of his epistles that he counterfeited that brief compendious manner\r\nof speech of the Lacedæmonians. As, when the war was begun, he wrote\r\nunto the Pergamenians in this sort: 'I understand you have given\r\nDolabella money: if you have done it willingly, you confess you have\r\noffended me; if against your wills, show it then by giving me\r\nwillingly.'... These were Brutus' manner of letters, which were honoured\r\nfor their briefness.\" The speech in question is far enough indeed from\r\nbeing a model of style either for oratory or anything else, but it is\r\nfinely characteristic; while its studied primness and epigrammatic\r\nfinish contrast most unfavorably with the frank-hearted yet artful\r\neloquence of Antony.\r\n\r\nAnd what a rare significance attaches to the brief scene of Brutus and\r\nhis drowsy boy Lucius in camp a little before the catastrophe! There, in\r\nthe deep of the night, long after all the rest have lost themselves in\r\nsleep, and when the anxieties of the issue are crowding upon him,--there\r\nwe have the earnest, thoughtful Brutus hungering intensely for the\r\nrepasts of treasured thought.\r\n\r\n  Look, Lucius, here's the book I sought for so;\r\n  I put it in the pocket of my gown. [IV, iii, 252, 253.]\r\n\r\nWhat the man is, and where he ought to be, is all signified in these two\r\nlines. And do we not taste a dash of benignant irony in the implied\r\nrepugnance between the spirit of the man and the stuff of his present\r\nundertaking? The idea of a bookworm riding the whirlwind of war! The\r\nthing is most like Brutus; but how out of his element, how unsphered\r\nfrom his right place, it shows him! There is a touch of drollery in the\r\ncontrast, which the richest steeping of poetry does not disguise. And\r\nthe irony is all the more delectable for being so remote and\r\nunpronounced; like one of those choice arrangements in the background of\r\na painting, which, without attracting conscious notice, give a zest and\r\nrelish to what stands in front. The scene, whether for charm of\r\nsentiment or felicity of conception, is one of the finest in\r\nShakespeare.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRUTUS AND CASSIUS\r\n\r\nThe characters of Brutus and Cassius are nicely discriminated, scarce a\r\nword falling from either but what smacks of the man. Cassius is much the\r\nbetter conspirator, but much the worse man; and the better in that\r\nbecause the worse in this. For Brutus engages in the conspiracy on\r\ngrounds of abstract and ideal justice; while Cassius holds it both a\r\nwrong and a blunder to go about such a thing without making success his\r\nfirst care. This, accordingly, is what he works for, being reckless of\r\nall other considerations in his choice and use of means. Withal he is\r\nmore impulsive and quick than Brutus, because less under the\r\nself-discipline of moral principle. His motives, too, are of a much more\r\nmixed and various quality, because his habits of thinking and acting\r\nhave grown by the measures of experience; he studies to understand men\r\nas they are; Brutus, as he thinks they ought to be. Hence, in every case\r\nwhere Brutus crosses him, Brutus is wrong, and he is right,--right, that\r\nis, if success be their aim. Cassius judges, and surely rightly, that\r\nthe end should give law to the means; and that \"the honorable men whose\r\ndaggers have stabb'd Cæsar\" should not be hampered much with\r\nconscientious scruples.\r\n\r\nStill Brutus overawes him by his moral energy and elevation of\r\ncharacter, and by the open-faced rectitude and purity of his principles.\r\nBrutus has no thoughts or aims that he is afraid or ashamed to avow;\r\nCassius has many which he would fain hide even from himself. And he\r\ncatches a sort of inspiration and is raised above himself by contact\r\nwith Brutus. And Cassius, moreover, acts very much from personal hatred\r\nof Cæsar, as remembering how, not long before, he and Brutus had stood\r\nfor the chief prætorship of the city, and Brutus through Cæsar's favor\r\nhad got the election. And so Shakespeare read in Plutarch that \"Cassius,\r\nbeing a choleric man, and hating Cæsar privately more than he did the\r\ntyranny openly, incensed Brutus against him.\" The effect of this is\r\nfinely worked out by the dramatist in the man's affected scorn of Cæsar,\r\nand in the scoffing humor in which he loves to speak of him. For such is\r\nthe natural language of a masked revenge.\r\n\r\nThe tone of Cassius is further indicated, and with exquisite art, in his\r\nsoliloquy where, after tempering Brutus to his purpose, and finding how\r\nhis \"honorable metal may be wrought,\" he gently slurs him for being\r\npracticable to flatteries, and then proceeds to ruminate the scheme for\r\nworking upon his vanity, and thereby drawing him into the conspiracy;\r\nthus spilling the significant fact, that his own honor does not stick\r\nto practice the arts by which he thinks it is a shame to be seduced.\r\n\r\nIt is a noteworthy point also that Cassius is too practical and too much\r\nof a politician to see any ghosts. Acting on far lower principles than\r\nhis leader, and such as that leader would spurn as both wicked and base,\r\nhe therefore does no violence to his heart in screwing it to the work he\r\ntakes in hand; his heart is even more at home in the work than his head;\r\nwhereas Brutus, from the wrenching his heart has suffered, keeps\r\nreverting to the moral complexion of his first step. The remembrance of\r\nthis is a thorn in his side; while Cassius has no sensibilities of\r\nnature for such compunctions to stick upon. Brutus is never thoroughly\r\nhimself after the assassination; that his heart is ill at ease is shown\r\nin a certain dogged tenacity of honor and overstraining of rectitude, as\r\nif he were struggling to make atonement with his conscience. The stab he\r\ngave Cæsar planted in his own upright and gentle nature a germ of\r\nremorse, which, gathering strength from every subsequent adversity, came\r\nto embody itself in imaginary sights and sounds; the spirit of justice,\r\nmade an ill angel to him by his own sense of wrong, hovering in the\r\nbackground of his after life, and haunting his solitary moments in the\r\nshape of Cæsar's ghost. And so it is well done, that he is made to see\r\nthe \"monstrous apparition\" just after his heart has been pierced through\r\nwith many sorrows at hearing of Portia's shocking death.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTIA\r\n\r\nThe delineation of Portia is completed in a few brief masterly strokes.\r\nOnce seen, the portrait ever after lives an old and dear acquaintance of\r\nthe reader's inner man. Portia has strength enough to do and suffer for\r\nothers, but very little for herself. As the daughter of Cato and the\r\nwife of Brutus, she has set in her eye a pattern of how she ought to\r\nthink and act, being \"so father'd and so husbanded\"; but still her head\r\nfloats merged over the ears in her heart; and it is only when affection\r\nspeaks that her spirit is hushed into the listening which she would fain\r\nyield only to the speech of reason. She has a clear idea of the stoical\r\ncalmness and fortitude which appears so noble and so graceful in her\r\nBrutus; it all lies faithfully reproduced in her mind; she knows well\r\nhow to honor and admire it; yet she cannot work it into the texture of\r\nher character; she can talk it like a book, but she tries in vain to\r\nlive it.\r\n\r\nPlutarch gives one most touching incident respecting her which\r\nShakespeare did not use, though he transfused the sense of it into his\r\nwork. It occurred some time after Cæsar's death, and when the civil war\r\nwas growing to a head: \"Brutus, seeing the state of Rome would be\r\nutterly overthrown, went ... unto the city of Elea standing by the sea.\r\nThere Portia, being ready to depart from her husband Brutus and to\r\nreturn to Rome, did what she could to dissemble the grief and sorrow she\r\nfelt at her heart. But a certain painted table (picture) bewrayed her in\r\nthe end.... The device was taken out of the Greek stories, how\r\nAndromache accompanied her husband Hector when he went out of the city\r\nof Troy to go to the wars, and how Hector delivered her his little son,\r\nand how her eyes were never off him. Portia, seeing this picture, and\r\nlikening herself to be in the same case, she fell a-weeping; and coming\r\nthither oftentimes in a day to see it, she wept still.\" The force of\r\nthis incident is reproduced in the Portia of the play; we have its full\r\neffect in the matter about her self-inflicted wound as compared with her\r\nsubsequent demeanor.\r\n\r\nPortia gives herself that gash without flinching, and bears it without a\r\nmurmur, as an exercise and proof of fortitude; and she translates her\r\npains into smiles, all to comfort and support her husband. So long as\r\nthis purpose lends her strength, she is fully equal to her thought,\r\nbecause here her heart keeps touch perfectly with her head. But, this\r\nmotive gone, the weakness, if it be not rather the strength, of her\r\nwoman's nature rushes full upon her; her feelings rise into an\r\nuncontrollable flutter, and run out at every joint and motion of her\r\nbody; and nothing can arrest the inward mutiny till affection again\r\nwhispers her into composure, lest she say something that may hurt or\r\nendanger her Brutus.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTONY\r\n\r\nShakespeare's completed characterization of Antony is in _Antony and\r\nCleopatra_. In the later play Antony is delineated with his native\r\naptitudes for vice warmed into full development by the great Egyptian\r\nsorceress. In _Julius Cæsar_ Shakespeare emphasizes as one of Antony's\r\ncharacteristic traits his unreserved adulation of Cæsar, shown in\r\nreckless purveying to his dangerous weakness,--the desire to be called a\r\nking. Already Cæsar had more than kingly power, and it was the obvious\r\npart of a friend to warn him against this ambition. Here and there are\r\napt indications of his proneness to those vicious levities and debasing\r\nluxuries which afterwards ripened into such a gigantic profligacy. He\r\nhas not yet attained to that rank and full-blown combination of cruelty,\r\nperfidy, and voluptuousness, which the world associates with his name,\r\nbut he is plainly on the way to it. His profound and wily\r\ndissimulation, while knitting up the hollow truce with the assassins on\r\nthe very spot where \"great Cæsar fell,\" is managed with admirable skill;\r\nhis deep spasms of grief being worked out in just the right way to\r\nquench their suspicions, and make them run into the toils, when he calls\r\non them to render him their bloody hands. Nor have they any right to\r\ncomplain, for he is but paying them in their own coin; and we think none\r\nthe worse of him that he fairly outdoes them at their own practice.\r\n\r\nBut Antony's worst parts as here delivered are his exultant treachery in\r\nproposing to use his colleague Lepidus as at once the pack-horse and the\r\nscape-goat of the Triumvirate, and his remorseless savagery in arranging\r\nfor the slaughter of all that was most illustrious in Rome, bartering\r\naway his own uncle, to glut his revenge with the blood of Cicero; though\r\neven here his revenge was less hideous than the cold-blooded policy of\r\nyoung Octavius. Yet Antony has in the play, as he had in fact, some\r\nright noble streaks in him; for his character was a very mixed one; and\r\nthere was to the last a fierce war of good and evil within him.\r\nEspecially he had an eye to see, a heart to feel, and a soul to honor\r\nthe superb structure of manhood which Rome possessed in Julius Cæsar,\r\nwho stood to him, indeed, as a kind of superior nature, to raise him\r\nabove himself. He \"fear'd Cæsar, honour'd him, and lov'd him\"; and with\r\nthe murdered Cæsar for his theme, he was for once inspired and kindled\r\nto a rapture of the truest, noblest, most overwhelming eloquence.\r\nNoteworthy also is the grateful remembrance at last of his obligations\r\nto Brutus for having saved him from the daggers of the conspirators.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PEOPLE\r\n\r\nThat many-headed, but withal big-souled creature, the multitude, is\r\ncharmingly characterized in _Julius Cæsar_. The common people, it is\r\ntrue, are rather easily swayed hither and thither by the contagion of\r\nsympathy and of persuasive speech; yet their feelings are in the main\r\nright, and even their judgment in the long run is better than that of\r\nthe pampered Roman aristocracy, inasmuch as it proceeds more from the\r\ninstincts of manhood. Shakespeare evidently loved to play with the\r\nnatural, unsophisticated, though somewhat childish heart of the people;\r\nbut his playing is always genial and human-hearted, with a certain\r\nangelic humor in it that seldom fails to warm us towards the subject. On\r\nthe whole, he understood the people well, and they have well repaid him\r\nin understanding him better than the critics have often done. The\r\ncobbler's droll humor, at the opening of this play, followed as it is by\r\na strain of the loftiest poetry, is aptly noted by Campbell as showing\r\nthat the dramatist, \"even in dealing with classical subjects, laughed at\r\nthe classic fear of putting the ludicrous and sublime into\r\njuxtaposition.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS\r\n\r\nAs a whole, _Julius Cæsar_ is inferior to _Coriolanus_, but it abounds\r\nin scenes and passages fraught, with the highest virtue of Shakespeare's\r\ngenius. Among these may be specially mentioned the second scene of the\r\nfirst act, where Cassius sows the seed of the conspiracy in Brutus's\r\nmind, warmed with such a wrappage of instigation as to assure its\r\neffective germination; also the first scene of the second act,\r\nunfolding the birth of the conspiracy, and winding up with the\r\ninterview, so charged with domestic glory, of Brutus and Portia. The\r\noration of Antony in Cæsar's funeral is such an interfusion of art and\r\npassion as realizes the very perfection of its kind. Adapted at once to\r\nthe comprehension of the lowest mind and to the delectation of the\r\nhighest, and running its pathos into the very quick of them that hear\r\nit, it tells with terrible effect on the people; and when it is done we\r\nfeel that Cæsar's bleeding wounds are mightier than ever his genius and\r\nfortune were. The quarrel of Brutus and Cassius is deservedly\r\ncelebrated. Dr. Johnson thought it \"somewhat cold and unaffecting.\"\r\nColeridge thought otherwise. See note, p. 123. But there is nothing in\r\nthe play that is more divinely touched than the brief scene, already\r\nnoticed, of Brutus and his boy Lucius--so gentle, so dutiful, so loving,\r\nso thoughtful and careful for his master, and yet himself no more\r\nconscious of his virtue than a flower of its fragrance. There is no more\r\nexquisite passage in all Shakespeare than that which tells of the boy's\r\nfalling asleep in the midst of his song and exclaiming on being aroused,\r\n\"The strings, my lord, are false.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHORITIES\r\n\r\n(With the more important abbreviations used in the notes)\r\n\r\n  F1 = First Folio, 1623.\r\n  F2 = Second Folio, 1632.\r\n  F3 = Third Folio, 1664.\r\n  F4 = Fourth Folio, 1685.\r\n  Ff = all the seventeenth century Folios.\r\n  Rowe = Rowe's editions, 1709, 1714.\r\n  Pope = Pope's editions, 1723, 1728.\r\n  Theobald = Theobald's editions, 1733, 1740.\r\n  Johnson = Johnson's edition, 1765.\r\n  Capell = Capell's edition, 1768.\r\n  Malone = Malone's edition, 1790.\r\n  Steevens = Steevens's edition, 1793.\r\n  Globe = Globe edition (Clark and Wright), 1864.\r\n  Clar = Clarendon Press edition (W.

In I, ii, 3, 4, 6, the First Folio gives the name\r\nin the Italian form, 'Antonio.' See note, p. 9, l. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: DECIUS BRUTUS. The true classical name was Decimus Brutus.\r\nIn Amyot's _Les Vies des hommes illustres grecs et latins_ (1559) and in\r\nNorth's Plutarch (1579) the name is given as in Shakespeare.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: MARULLUS.

Rowe (1709) had 'Artimedorus (Artemidorus,\r\n1714) a Soothsayer.' This Theobald altered to 'Artemidorus, a Sophist of\r\nCnidos,' and made the Soothsayer a separate character].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: CALPURNIA. Occasionally in North's Plutarch (twice in\r\n_Julius Cæsar_) and always in the First Folio the name is given as\r\n'Calphurnia.']\r\n\r\n[Page 3]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT I\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE I. _Rome.

The strain of casuistry used\r\nin this speech is very remarkable. Coleridge found it\r\nperplexing. On the supposition that Shakespeare meant Brutus\r\nfor a wise and good man, the speech seems unintelligible.

Cf. also the King's speech to Laertes, _Hamlet_, IV,\r\nvii, 115-124, and _Macbeth_, I, vii, 1-28.]\r\n\r\n[Note 66: Commentators differ about 'Genius' here; some taking\r\nit for the 'conscience,' others for the 'anti-conscience.'\r\nShakespeare uses 'genius,' 'spirit,' and 'demon,' as\r\nsynonymous, and all three, apparently, both in a good sense\r\nand in a bad, as every man was supposed to have a good and a\r\nbad angel. So, in this play, IV, iii, 282, we have \"thy evil\r\nspirit\"; in _The Tempest_, IV, i, 27, \"our worser genius\"; in\r\n_Troilus and Cressida_, IV, iv, 52, \"some say the Genius so\r\nCries 'come' to him that instantly must die\"; in _Antony and\r\nCleopatra_, II, iii, 19, \"Thy demon, that's thy spirit which\r\nkeeps thee\"; where, as often, 'keeps' is 'guards.' In these\r\nand some other cases the words have some epithet or context\r\nthat determines their meaning, but not so with 'Genius' in the\r\ntext. But, in all such cases, the words indicate the directive\r\npower of the mind. And so we often speak of a man's 'better\r\nself,' or a man's 'worser self,' according as one is in fact\r\ndirected or drawn to good or to evil.--The sense of 'mortal'\r\nhere is also somewhat in question. Shakespeare sometimes uses\r\nit for 'perishable,' or that which dies; but oftener for\r\n'deadly,' or that which kills. 'Mortal instruments' may well\r\nbe held to mean what Macbeth refers to when he says, \"I'm\r\nsettled, and bend up Each corporal agent to this terrible\r\nfeat.\"--As Brutus is speaking with reference to his own case,\r\nhe probably intends 'Genius' in a good sense, for the\r\nspiritual or immortal part of himself. If so, then he would\r\nnaturally mean by 'mortal' his perishable part, or his\r\nministerial faculties, which shrink from executing what the\r\ndirecting power is urging them to. The late Professor Ferrier\r\nof St. Andrews seems to take a somewhat different view of the\r\npassage. He says, \"In this speech of Brutus, Shakespeare gives\r\na fine description of the unsettled state of the mind when the\r\nwill is hesitating about the perpetration of a great crime,\r\nand when the passions are threatening to overpower, and\r\neventually do overpower, the reason and the conscience.\"]\r\n\r\n[Note 67-69: Cf.

Know, Cæsar doth not wrong, but with just cause,\r\n  Nor without cause will he be satisfied.\r\n\r\nIn the old Hudson Shakespeare text the first line of Cæsar's\r\nreply was: \"Cæsar did never wrong but with just cause.\" Jonson\r\nhas another gird at what he deemed Shakespeare's blunder, for\r\nin the Induction to _The Staple of News_ is, \"_Prologue_. Cry\r\nyou mercy, you never did wrong, but with just cause.\" Either\r\nJonson must have misquoted what he heard at the theater, or\r\nthe passage was altered to the form in the text of the Folios\r\non his remonstrance. This way of conveying meanings by\r\nsuggestion rather than direct expression was intolerable to\r\nJonson.

It seems to have\r\nbeen an Elizabethan proverb or 'gag,' and it is found in at\r\nleast three works published earlier than _Julius Cæsar_. (See\r\nIntroduction, Sources, p. xvi.) Cæsar had been as a father to\r\nBrutus, who was fifteen years his junior; and the Greek, καὶ\r\nσὺ, τέκνον \"and thou, my son!\" which Dion and Suetonius put\r\ninto his mouth, though probably unauthentic, is good enough to\r\nbe true. In Plutarch are two detailed accounts of the\r\nassassination, that in _Marcus Brutus_ differing somewhat from\r\nthat in _Julius Cæsar_ with regard to the nomenclature of the\r\npersons involved. The following is from _Marcus Brutus_:\r\n\"Trebonius on the other side drew Antonius aside, as he came\r\ninto the house where the Senate sat, and held him with a long\r\ntalk without. When Cæsar was come into the house, all the\r\nSenate rose to honour him at his coming in. So when he was\r\nset, the conspirators flocked about him, and amongst them they\r\npresented one Tullius Cimber, who made humble suit for the\r\ncalling home again of his brother that was banished. They all\r\nmade as though they were intercessors for him, and took Cæsar\r\nby the hands, and kissed his head and breast. Cæsar at the\r\nfirst simply refused their kindness and entreaties; but\r\nafterwards, perceiving they still pressed on him, he violently\r\nthrust them from him. Then Cimber with both his hands plucked\r\nCæsar's gown over his shoulders, and Casca, that stood behind\r\nhim, drew his dagger first and strake Cæsar upon the shoulder,\r\nbut gave him no great wound. Cæsar, feeling himself hurt, took\r\nhim straight by the hand he held his dagger in, and cried out\r\nin Latin: 'O traitor Casca, what dost thou?' Casca on the\r\nother side cried in Greek, and called his brother to help him.\r\nSo divers running on a heap together to fly upon Cæsar, he,\r\nlooking about him to have fled, saw Brutus with a sword drawn\r\nin his hand ready to strike at him: then he let Casca's hand\r\ngo, and casting his gown over his face, suffered every man to\r\nstrike at him that would. Then the conspirators thronging one\r\nupon another, because every man was desirous to have a cut at\r\nhim, so many swords and daggers lighting upon one body, one of\r\nthem hurt another, and among them Brutus caught a blow on his\r\nhand, because he would make one in murthering of him, and all\r\nthe rest also were every man of them bloodied.\"]\r\n\r\n[Page 86]\r\n\r\n  CINNA.

The Folios give no indication of place, but that\r\nShakespeare intended the scene to be in Rome is clear from ll.\r\n10, 11, where Lepidus is sent to Cæsar's house and told that\r\nhe will find his confederates \"or here, or at the Capitol.\" In\r\nfact, however, the triumvirs, Octavius, Antonius, and Lepidus,\r\nmet in November, B.C. 43, some nineteen months after the\r\nassassination of Cæsar, on a small island in the river Rhenus\r\n(now the Reno), near Bononia (Bologna). \"All three met\r\ntogether in an island environed round about with a little\r\nriver, and there remained three days together. Now, as\r\ntouching all other matters they were easily agreed, and did\r\ndivide all the empire of Rome between them, as if it had been\r\ntheir own inheritance. But yet they could hardly agree whom\r\nthey would put to death: for every one of them would kill\r\ntheir enemies, and save their kinsmen and friends. Yet, at\r\nlength, giving place to their greedy desire to be revenged of\r\ntheir enemies, they spurned all reverence of blood and\r\nholiness of friendship at their feet. For Cæsar left Cicero to\r\nAntonius's will; Antonius also forsook Lucius Cæsar, who was\r\nhis uncle by his mother; and both of them together suffered\r\nLepidus to kill his own brother Paulus. Yet some writers\r\naffirm that Cæsar and Antonius requested Paulus might be\r\nslain, and that Lepidus was contented with it.\"--Plutarch,\r\n_Marcus Antonius_.]\r\n\r\n[Note 1: /prick'd./ So in III, i. 217.

Cæsar's\r\nyoungest sister, Julia, was married to Marcus Atius Balbus,\r\nand their daughter Atia, again, was married to Caius Octavius,\r\na nobleman of the plebeian order. From this marriage sprang\r\nthe present Octavius, who afterwards became the Emperor\r\nAugustus. He was mainly educated by his great-uncle, was\r\nadvanced to the patrician order, and was adopted as his son\r\nand heir; so that his full and proper designation at this time\r\nwas Caius Julius Cæsar Octavianus.
