MILLER\r\n  OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\n  WITH OVER 70 ILLUSTRATIONS AND A MAP\r\n\r\n  NEW YORK\r\n  CHARLES SCRIBNER’S SONS\r\n  1919\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  COPYRIGHT, 1917, 1918, BY\r\n  CHARLES SCRIBNER’S SONS\r\n\r\n  Published October, 1918\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO\r\n  MY WIFE\r\n  L. E. M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nI have frequently wondered how many of the large number of people who\r\nvisit natural-history museums have any conception of the appearance\r\nand actions, in their wilderness homes, of the creatures they see, and\r\nof the experiences of the field-naturalists who visit the little-known\r\nplaces of the earth in search of them.\r\n\r\nMy experience as a field-naturalist consists of nearly six years\r\nof almost continuous exploration in South America, and embraces\r\npractically all of the republics of that continent.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this narrative is to follow the course of these\r\nexplorations into the tropical jungles of the Amazon, Paraguay,\r\nOrinoco, and others of South America’s master rivers, and to the frigid\r\nheights of the snow-crowned Andes.\r\n\r\nIn these jungles one hears the hoarse cough of the jaguar and the\r\nscream of long-tailed, multicolored macaws as they fly two by two\r\noverhead; the extraordinary chorus of frogs and insects may lull the\r\nweary senses to sleep at nightfall, but the dismal roar of howling\r\nmonkeys is sure to awaken one at dawn. To start at the sudden,\r\nlong-drawn hiss of a boa or the lightning-like thrust of the terrible\r\nbushmaster, the largest of poisonous snakes, and a creature so deadly\r\nthat a man may die within ten minutes after the fatal stroke, and to\r\nshudder as the wild, insane cackle of the wood-rails shatters the\r\nbrooding silence of the forest, are merely incidents of the explorer’s\r\nevery-day life; and so, too, are visits to deep lagoons teeming with\r\ncrocodiles, cannibal fishes, and myriads of water-fowl; lengthy\r\nsojourns in gloomy forests where orchids droop from moss-draped\r\nbranches, brilliant butterflies shimmer in the subdued light, and\r\ncurious animals live in the eternal shadows; and ascents of the\r\nstupendous mountain ranges where condors soar majestically above\r\nthe ruins of Incan greatness. In short, the expeditions recorded in\r\nthe book lead through remote wilderness where savage peoples and\r\nlittle-known animals spend their lives in stealth and vigilance, all\r\noblivious of the existence of an outer world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe explorations here recounted were undertaken by me as a member or\r\nleader of the following expeditions, all of which were undertaken\r\nunder the auspices of the American Museum of Natural History, New York\r\nCity: Colombia--March, 1911, to September, 1912; Colombia--November,\r\n1914, to April, 1915; Venezuela--November, 1912, to June, 1913;\r\nBritish Guiana--July to October, 1913; Roosevelt-Rondon South American\r\nExpedition, mostly in Brazil but covering a part of Paraguay, with\r\nstops in Uruguay and Argentina--October, 1913, to June, 1914;\r\nBolivia--May, 1915, to January, 1916, touching at Panama, Ecuador,\r\nand Peru en route; Argentina--January to September, 1916. The purpose\r\nof these expeditions was to collect birds and mammals; also to study\r\nthe fauna in general and to make all possible observations regarding\r\nthe flora, topography, climate, and human inhabitants of the regions\r\nvisited. The personnel of each expedition is given in the proper place\r\nin the text.\r\n\r\nI wish to acknowledge my indebtedness to Doctor Frank M. Chapman and\r\nto Colonel Theodore Roosevelt for suggesting and encouraging the\r\nproduction of this book, also to Mrs. Alice K. Fraser for the great\r\namount of time and work devoted to typewriting the manuscript.\r\n\r\n                        LEO E.

Owing to numerous\r\nreefs and rocks that render navigation perilous along the coast of\r\nnorthwestern South America, it is necessary for ships to sail far out\r\ninto the Pacific. Banks of low-hanging fog, encountered at frequent\r\nintervals, add further to the skipper’s difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe captain of the _Quito_ followed a simple plan for finding port.\r\nIt was his custom to steam in a southerly direction about forty-eight\r\nhours, and then head toward the coast. Once in sight of land, there was\r\nlittle difficulty in getting his bearings, although it frequently meant\r\nsteaming back a distance of ten or fifteen miles.\r\n\r\nAt noon on the second day out we entered what might be called the belt\r\nof perpetual rain, and for three hours water fell in such torrents\r\nthat it seemed a solid wall. When the deluge had ceased and the last\r\nwisps of blue-gray vapor melted into oblivion, the shore-line, dim and\r\ndistant, could be discerned. The faint outline of a rugged coast became\r\ngradually sharper; jagged rocks, frowning precipices, and dark, gloomy\r\nforests slowly unfolded themselves to the vision. The magnitude of it\r\nall was most impressive.\r\n\r\nThen followed a ten-mile sail through the placid water of Buenaventura\r\nBay. Numberless brown pelicans fished in the shallows while others, in\r\nlong files, alternately sailed and flapped through the air on their way\r\nto some isolated nook among the mangroves. The dark, hazy shore-line at\r\nthe head of the bay gradually dissolved itself into lines of graceful\r\ncocoanut-palms and low, thatched huts flanked by a seemingly endless\r\nmantle of green. Huge dugout canoes made from logs of great size\r\nswarmed out from the water’s edge, their dusky paddlers vying with one\r\nanother in their efforts to be the first to reach the steamer; then\r\nthe men quarrelled violently among themselves, and also shouted to the\r\npersons on the deck, soliciting luggage to take ashore. Before long,\r\ntrunks were being lowered into some of these wallowing craft while\r\npassengers embarked in others, and the paddle of a mile to shore began.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the tide was ebbing, leaving extensive mud-flats exposed\r\nalong the water-front. As there was no pier it was necessary for the\r\ncanoemen to carry on their backs the human freight as well as trunks\r\nand other luggage through a wide belt of mud and sand.\r\n\r\nOur party consisted of Doctor Frank M. Chapman, curator of birds, of\r\nthe American Museum, Louis Agassiz Fuertes, and myself. At Buenaventura\r\nwe were joined by William Richardson, who had spent many years as a\r\nfield-naturalist in Central and South American countries. We were\r\nstarting on a zoological expedition--a quest for birds and mammals,\r\nand also to study the country, life-zones, problems of distribution\r\nand many other things inseparable from a biological survey such as we\r\nproposed to make. The original plans of the expedition called for a\r\nrather short stay; but for me, at least, the experience was destined\r\nto cover a period of eighteen months and take me to some of the most\r\nremote and wildest portions of the country.\r\n\r\nViewed from the water, Buenaventura appears most unattractive. The row\r\nof squat, makeshift huts, built on tall poles, extends far beyond the\r\nline of high water; as the tide rises the water swishes and gurgles\r\nunderneath the houses and the occupants travel about in canoes. Farther\r\nfrom the shore the ground is high and the town is more interesting,\r\nthough not inviting. The place bears an unenviable reputation. On\r\naccount of the superabundant rainfall and hot climate, fevers and other\r\nlife-sapping diseases are rife and few foreigners can withstand the\r\nordeal of a lengthy residence there. This notoriety had reached our\r\nears long before we embarked on the journey; it was, therefore, with a\r\nfeeling of relief that we learned of the departure of a train for the\r\ninterior early the next morning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Buenaventura.]\r\n\r\nFor a distance of twenty-five miles, after leaving Buenaventura,\r\nnothing was visible but swamps filled with mangrove thickets. Then\r\nthe foot-hills of the Andes appeared, the steady climb began and the\r\ncharacter of the vegetation changed. Instead of the low, matted growth\r\nof shrubbery, there grew trees and palms of goodly size. Stops for\r\nwood and water were made frequently; the train usually halted near a\r\ncollection of native huts, the occupants of which earned their living\r\nchopping wood for the railroad company. Each habitation was surrounded\r\nby a small clearing in which broad-leaved banana, plantain, and papaya\r\ntrees grew in wonderful luxuriance. Jungles of tall bamboo bordered the\r\nplantations and grew beside the track. Plantains and bamboo seem to\r\nbe the staples of the people. The former they eat, and of the latter\r\ntheir houses are built. The flimsy structures were ramshackle affairs\r\nwith ragged, thatched roofs, and fitted well into their surroundings.\r\nFrequently we had a fleeting view of the almost nude occupants of the\r\nhuts, lolling about in the darkened interior.\r\n\r\nThe first town of any importance was Cisneros. We were delayed an hour\r\nat this station because the train from the opposite direction had\r\nmet with an accident that blocked the track, and, as the people were\r\ncelebrating one of their numerous _fiestas_, it was impossible to get\r\nmen to clear away the wreckage without great loss of time.\r\n\r\nThe railroad continued up the slope, following the winding canyon of\r\nthe Dagua. It has been said that the cost of constructing it was a\r\nmillion dollars a mile. Tunnels, deep cuts through spurs and ridges,\r\ntrestles and high bridges followed one another in quick succession.\r\nThe perpendicular sides of the excavations were covered with long moss\r\nand drooping ferns that waved plume-like overhead. Mountain torrents\r\npoured their crystal streams from openings in overgrown crevices and\r\nwere dashed to spray on the rocks below. Hundreds of feet lower down,\r\nthe Dagua raged within the narrow confines of a rock-bound gorge. Thick\r\njungles, dark and impenetrable, cover the slopes. We were conscious\r\nof the perfume of flowers concealed amid the forbidding masses of\r\ndeepest green. An iguana, fully four feet long and of a bright green\r\ncolor dashed across the track a few feet ahead of the puffing engine;\r\na moment later and the beautiful creature would have been crushed to\r\ndeath. Overhead, flocks of parrots screamed defiance at the lowly,\r\nwheezing thing that laboriously made its way farther and farther into\r\ntheir time-hallowed abode; and toucans, clattering their long bills\r\nand yelping, performed queer acrobatics in a lofty tree-top. A violent\r\nlunge recalled us to earth; the train had stopped for more fuel so the\r\npassengers got out and amused themselves touching the sensitive-plants\r\nthat grew abundantly along the road-bed.\r\n\r\nNot long afterward we emerged suddenly into a peculiar region.\r\nThere was an abrupt end to the gloomy forest, and in its place grew\r\nstraggling clumps of giant cacti. The dividing-line is as sharp as if\r\ncut with a knife. The fauna also is different; instead of brilliantly\r\nhued tanagers, trogons and toucans, there are wrens, finches, and other\r\nbirds of sombre color. This desert-like belt continued for a distance\r\nof some miles, and then forest again appeared, on the top only of the\r\nridges, at first, but gradually extending downward until the slopes\r\nwere entirely covered.\r\n\r\nCaldas, the terminus of the railroad, was reached at noon and, after a\r\ngood deal of bargaining, the proprietor of the Hotel del Valle provided\r\nus with a room containing four bare, wooden beds; but fortunately our\r\nblanket-bags had come with us, so we rather rejoiced that no bedding\r\nwas provided by the innkeeper. The buildings comprising the town are\r\nscattered here and there in small groups, making it difficult to get a\r\ncomprehensive idea of their number. The first impression suggests that\r\nthere is a population of a few hundred only, when it is really several\r\nthousand. At this time (April, 1911) Caldas was an attractive spot,\r\nas its elevation is two thousand feet, and the country immediately\r\nsurrounding it is open; but in recent years sufferers from malaria,\r\nyellow fever, and other diseases have gone there from Buenaventura to\r\nrecuperate, and have left the several maladies firmly implanted in the\r\nentire region, making it most unhealthful.\r\n\r\nA small tent-show was playing at Caldas, and as this was a most unusual\r\noccurrence it created a certain amount of furor among the people. It\r\nrained heavily the greater part of the afternoon, but darkness had\r\nscarcely crept up from the lowland when troops of people, each one\r\ncarrying a chair or box to sit on, came tramping from all directions,\r\ntheir bare feet making swishing and gurgling sounds as they plodded\r\nthrough mud and water. The elite--even Caldas boasts of a high-class\r\nsocial set--arrived later and stood during practically the entire\r\nperformance in order to be the better seen and admired by the “common”\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nSo far, Richardson had acted as cashier for the party, and it was\r\nrather startling to see entries in his journal such as “lunch, $200.00;\r\nrailroad-tickets, $2,000.00; oranges, $15.00.” The Colombian dollar, or\r\n_peso_, had depreciated in value until it was worth exactly one cent in\r\nUnited States currency. Practically all the money in circulation was in\r\nbills of from one to one hundred pesos, the former predominating. If\r\none had only a hundred one-peso notes, equalling an American dollar,\r\nthey made quite a bulky parcel; for this reason all the men carry large\r\nleather pocketbooks attached to a strap slung across the shoulder, and\r\nquite incidentally these containers also hold cigars, matches, and\r\nvarious other little articles dear to the hearts of their owners.\r\n\r\nRichardson had arranged for _arrieros_ and a caravan of pack-mules to\r\nmeet us early the following morning, but it was almost noon when they\r\nappeared. We were in the land of _mañana_, but had not as yet learned\r\nto curb our impatience at the hundred and one exasperating things that\r\nwere constantly cropping out to impede our progress or upset our plans.\r\nOne of the first things the visitor to Latin-America must learn is to\r\ntake things good-naturedly and as easily as possible. If one employs\r\nservants regularly it is possible to correct many of their customs that\r\nare so annoying to the North American; but the countries, as a whole,\r\ncannot be reformed by any one in a single day, and the person who takes\r\nthings too seriously either lacks a sense of humor or conveys the\r\nimpression that he is very foolish.\r\n\r\nSome of the mules were saddled for riding, while others were equipped\r\nwith thick pack-saddles made of burlap stuffed with straw. Bags and\r\ntrunks were brought out, sorted as to weight, and then loaded on the\r\npack-mules, being held in place one on either side of the animal with\r\ncowhide thongs. Each mule carried about two hundred and fifty pounds.\r\nWhile adjusting cargoes, the _arrieros_, or drivers, place their poncho\r\nover the mules’ eyes; otherwise they would not stand for the rather\r\nrough treatment to which they are subjected.\r\n\r\nThe road was fairly wide and good. It followed along the gorge of the\r\nDagua, now a small stream. Within a few hours the village of El Carmen\r\nwas reached and we dismounted to await the pack-train and incidentally\r\nto have lunch at the posada, and to see a cock-fight, for the fiesta of\r\nyesterday was still in progress in the rural districts.\r\n\r\nWe climbed slowly and steadily upward. At fifty-five hundred feet the\r\nzone of clouds and vapor appeared; trees, rocks, in fact everything\r\nseemed unreal and ghost-like, enveloped in the thick, blue-gray haze\r\nthat penetrated clothing and sent a piercing chill to the very marrow.\r\nDarkness was fast approaching, so we stopped at a wayside hut called\r\nEl Tigre for the night. The house was damp and cold, as might have\r\nbeen expected, and its occupants were practically without food. A\r\nprofusion of vegetation grew in the yard; there were roses, geraniums,\r\nhibiscus, and hydrangeas growing everywhere; monstrous ferns with\r\nlace-like leaves formed a thick, velvety background for the brilliant,\r\nmany-colored blooms. In the garden, blackberries, strawberries,\r\ncabbages, coffee, and an edible tuber called _aracacha_ grew; there\r\nwere also a few stunted banana and plantain stalks, but on account of\r\nthe cold climate it requires two years for them to mature, and the\r\nfruit is small and of poor quality.\r\n\r\nThanks to an early start on the following morning, we reached the\r\nsummit of the range, or the Cordillera Occidental, as it is better\r\nknown, by ten o’clock. The whole slopes are covered with the densest of\r\nsubtropical jungles. A steady downpour had fallen the entire morning,\r\nagainst which _ponchos_ availed little. A halt of two hours was\r\ntherefore called at a rather cheerless inn just beyond the pass, named\r\nSan Antonio; the _señora_ who conducted the establishment was glad to\r\nsee us, for Richardson had apprised her of our coming; she soon had\r\nplantains roasting on the embers, and her shop provided sardines for\r\nlunch.\r\n\r\nThe descent of the eastern slope now began. The trail narrowed down and\r\nwas rough; in places the decline was 45°. On both sides rose the living\r\nwalls of impenetrable, gloomy jungle. One thing could not fail to\r\nimpress us, and that was the great, breathless silence of the forest.\r\nWhere we had expected to find multitudes of gorgeous birds, a babble of\r\nanimal voices and brilliant flowers, there was only the sombre, silent\r\nmass of unvaried green. Within two hours we had left the regions of\r\ncold and penetrating mists. For the first time we beheld the beautiful\r\nvalley of the Cauca far below, spread before our vision like a velvet\r\ncarpet of softest green that reached the very foot-hills of the Central\r\nRange not less than forty miles distant.\r\n\r\nThe steady, rhythmic skuff of bare or sandal-shod feet, mingled with\r\nthe louder tramp of mules and discordant cries of the _arrieros_, now\r\nreached our ears at frequent intervals, to be followed shortly by the\r\nappearance of pack-trains heavily laden with coffee and hides as they\r\nswung around a bend in the narrow mountain trail, and we knew that the\r\nend of our journey, at least for the present, was near.\r\n\r\nDownward we rode, always downward, with the valley still several\r\nhundreds of feet below, and the mountains towering thousands of feet in\r\nthe rear.\r\n\r\nHere and there a bit of humanity flashed into view near one of the\r\nlonely _haciendas_ snugly nestling in some seemingly inaccessible niche\r\nin the mountainside. To our right, a solitary monastery perched upon\r\na barren peak, with its separate narrow trail leading from the dizzy\r\nheight and winding its tortuous course along the jutting precipice\r\nuntil lost in the filmy haze.\r\n\r\nAhead, a black mass that dissolved itself into one immense flock of\r\nvultures appeared on the landscape. This was their season of harvest\r\nand the quarrelsome scavengers were reluctant to leave their repast--an\r\nunfortunate burro that had been abandoned on the trail.\r\n\r\nWith a feeling of repugnance, we spurred our horses on to greater\r\neffort, and at last our anticipations were realized as, rounding an\r\nabrupt point, we beheld Cali directly at our feet. A half-hour later we\r\nhad clattered through a green arch formed by four magnificent ceibas\r\nthat stood like sentinels guarding the approach to the city, crossed\r\nthe bridge spanning the Rio Cali, wended our way up the stone-paved\r\nstreets, and drawn rein in the _patio_ of the Hotel Central.\r\n\r\nCali is a typical Colombian city. At first the uniformly low,\r\nwhitewashed buildings with barred windows, thick adobe walls, and\r\npretty _patios_, or inner courts, thrust themselves forcibly upon\r\nthe attention, on account of the sharp contrast to the style of\r\narchitecture to which the American is accustomed; but later one accepts\r\nthem as a matter of course quite in harmony with the monotonous and\r\neasy-going life of most Latin-American cities.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing particularly modern about Cali; but the city is\r\ninteresting, perhaps for that very reason. I saw not a single chimney,\r\nnor was there a pane of glass anywhere except in the huge cathedral\r\nfacing the verdure-laden plaza. Churches are numerous, of massive\r\nconstruction, and built in Spanish style. The bells, of which there\r\nare many, are suspended in open niches in the towers, covered with\r\nverdigris, and keep up an almost continuous clanging.\r\n\r\nThe streets are narrow and crooked. A stream of water flows through the\r\ncentre of some of them; this serves both purposes--as a kind of sewage\r\nsystem and also to supply water for various needs, although there is a\r\nsystem of piping in some of the houses, and fountains on a few street\r\ncorners supply drinking-water to those who care to fetch it. I have\r\nseen, on several occasions, children attempting to bathe in the little\r\nstream; a short distance below, ducks were swimming in the water; then\r\na person stepping from one of the doorways threw a pailful of garbage\r\ninto it; finally, some one stepped out and unconcernedly dipped up a\r\npitcherful of the water and took it indoors.\r\n\r\nIt is quite unusual to see any of the women of the upper class on the\r\nstreets during the daytime, except on special occasions, or while\r\nthey are on their way to and from church. They remain secluded in\r\ntheir homes, safe from the gaze of vulgar eyes. Embroidering and music\r\nare the chief diversions, and a large number of them are really very\r\naccomplished in both lines. It was remarkable to notice how many pianos\r\nthere were, when we consider that each instrument had to be brought\r\nover the Andes slung on poles and carried by mules.\r\n\r\nPractically all work is performed by people of the lower class.\r\nThey toil day and night and, in most instances, for very little\r\nremuneration. One may see them engaged in various occupations at all\r\nhours of the day; but during the early hours of the morning, long files\r\nwend their way down the streets with the public market-place as the\r\npoint of focus. The huge brick structure is a busy place. It reminds\r\none of an ants’ nest with its incoming and departing swarms. Inside the\r\nbuilding are rows and heaps of fruit, vegetables, meat, bread, and many\r\nother articles. A motley crowd of women fills the place to overflowing;\r\neach carries a basket, or wooden tray, on her head into which the\r\npurchases are placed, when, after an indefinite amount of bargaining\r\nand haggling, they have been consummated. Invariably each receptacle\r\ncontains a curious collection; a number of green and ripe plantains; a\r\nslice of pumpkin; a pepper, garlic, and a tomato; a chunk of meat, and\r\na papaya. Perhaps there may also be a bunch of _yerba buena_ and some\r\nachiote seeds with which to give a spicy flavor and yellow color to the\r\nsoup; but these condiments are, unfortunately, used in such quantities\r\nthat a goodly supply is usually kept on hand even when there is no\r\nother food in the house.\r\n\r\nThe nights are delightful in Cali. A refreshing wind springs up soon\r\nafter sundown; the military band plays in the plaza, lights twinkle and\r\nthe breeze sighs through the royal palms and orange-trees scattering\r\nbroadcast snowy petals and heavy perfume. Only the _gente_ are admitted\r\ninto this little fairy-land. Gayly dressed and highly-rouged women,\r\nclothed in the extreme of fashion, parade along the winding walks; but\r\nit is considered in bad taste for them to appear without an escort. The\r\npoorer class, ragged and barefooted, gathers outside the iron fence\r\nand peers through the bars; the children run and play noisily on the\r\nneighboring streets. At last the bells in the cathedral boom the hour\r\nof ten; the band plays the national anthem, when every one stands, the\r\nmen with uncovered heads. Then the crowd disperses quietly and orderly.\r\nSoon the town is wrapped in slumber with only the sighing wind and\r\nthe occasional shrill blasts of police whistles to disturb the drowsy\r\nsolitude.\r\n\r\nIt was said, that Cali had a population of forty thousand, but that\r\nfigure doubtless included the populace of the suburban districts for a\r\nconsiderable distance. The city is bound to grow, however, on account\r\nof its favorable location in the fertile Cauca Valley, which is one of\r\nthe garden spots of all South America.\r\n\r\nThe Cauca River is about four miles distant from the city, and the\r\nsettlement of Guanchito is located on the river-bank. A little toy-like\r\ntrain makes frequent trips back and forth between the two points\r\nbecause the _puerto_, as Guanchito is commonly called, is of real\r\nimportance. Steamers and launches from Cartago take on and discharge\r\npassengers and freight, and many rafts laden with green plantains and\r\nproduce arrive daily. The village presents a scene of great activity\r\nduring the morning hours; clusters of ragged little booths, like\r\nmushrooms, have sprung up during the hours of darkness where women,\r\nsquatting under the shambling shelters, cook _sancocho_ over charcoal\r\nbraziers; files of _peons_ hurry back and forth as they transfer the\r\ncargoes from rafts and canoes to the waiting freight-cars; and there\r\nis a great deal of good-natured raillery between the slovenly _mozos_\r\nwho liberally patronize the eating and drinking places, and the\r\nstand-keepers who feign an air of coyness withal. Gradually, as the sun\r\nmounts higher the crowds grow thinner. Their morning’s work over, the\r\npeople either depart via the waterway they had come, or take the train\r\nback to Cali.\r\n\r\nAn interesting ferry service is maintained at Guanchito. A stout steel\r\ncable has been strung across the river, and to a pulley running along\r\nit, two chains are fastened, their other ends being tied to either end\r\nof the boat. The latter is a huge, flat-bottomed affair, capable of\r\nholding many people and horses. Before starting across, the up-stream\r\nchain is shortened, so that the side of the boat presents a sharp angle\r\nto the current, and the craft is speedily pushed to the other side of\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\nExtensive marshes border the Cauca, a short distance above Guanchito.\r\nDuring the rainy season the water spreads over many miles of land,\r\nand is very deep; but in the dry season it recedes rapidly leaving a\r\nnumber of shallow and well-defined marshes and ponds. Wildfowl gathers\r\nin great numbers to spend the hottest months in these friendly havens.\r\nThere were ducks of a number of species, including tree-ducks that\r\nmake a shrill, whistling noise as they speed by and then drop on\r\nthe ground near the marsh, to stand motionless and on the alert for\r\npossible danger before plunging into the water. Great gray herons\r\ncroaked and waded sedately among the rushes, spearing frogs and fish\r\nas they went along. The horned screamer--a bird the size of a large\r\nturkey--is also an inhabitant of the marshes. It has rather long, but\r\nthick legs, that enable it to wade into fairly deep water, but also\r\nswims to floating islands of succulent water-plants which form a part\r\nof its food. The bird’s color is slaty black, the back being glossy;\r\nthe belly is white; a horn, or caruncle, several inches long grows from\r\nthe forehead and curves forward. The feathers are soft, and the tissues\r\nfor half an inch under the skin are filled with air spaces; the natives\r\nsay that this protects the bird from the bites of poisonous snakes,\r\nand it is not impossible that this pneumatic cushion could serve such\r\na purpose, although it is hardly probable. The most remarkable thing\r\nabout the bird, however, is its voice. Usually a pair sing together;\r\nthey walk slowly back and forth, throw the head over the back, and\r\nemit powerful hoots, booms, and long-drawn, clear, ringing notes that,\r\nwhile harmonious and not unmusical, are nevertheless touched with\r\npathos and conjure in one’s imagination a picture of some trammelled\r\nspirit of the wild yearning for redemption. Numerous small birds,\r\nmainly tyrant-flycatchers inhabit the thorny thickets growing out of\r\nthe water, and build their huge grass nests within the safe barrier of\r\nthorn-armed branches.\r\n\r\nThe surrounding country of the Cauca Valley is fertile and productive\r\nof most of the things essential to the support of a contented and\r\nthriving populace. A great deal of the land is used for grazing cattle\r\nand horses, but it will soon become too valuable to use for this\r\npurpose on account of the limited amount available. A far greater\r\nrevenue can be derived through cultivation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cattle grazing in the Cauca Valley.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Port of Guanchito.]\r\n\r\nWe paid a visit to a large sugar estate called La Manuelita, near\r\nthe town of Palmira. La Manuelita is a little world of its own; it\r\ncomprises fifteen hundred acres of the most fertile and attractive\r\npart of the valley. The ranch-house, occupying a site in the centre, is\r\na rambling two-story building of generous proportions and attractive\r\nappearance. The gardens, surrounding it with a riot of color, give\r\nit a quaint, old-fashioned charm; there has been no studied effect,\r\nno precision in the arrangement of plants or flowers; oleanders,\r\nroses, hibiscus, geraniums, and hollyhocks grow in matted profusion.\r\nClumps of magnolias, chinaberries and oranges conceal the high stone\r\nfence. Immediately without the wall surrounding the house is the\r\n_peon_ village consisting of some fifty-odd houses of uniform size and\r\nappearance, and the sugar-factory. The _peons_ are of Spanish, Indian,\r\nand negro blood, or of a mixture of any two or all three, and require\r\nconstant supervision to secure the best results.\r\n\r\nAll the land is under cultivation, mostly in cane, for the production\r\nof which it is well suited. The soil is a rich alluvial loam. Some of\r\nthe cane-fields at La Manuelita had not been replanted in ninety years;\r\nothers on the estate of William Barney, former United States consul in\r\nCali, had been producing one hundred and twenty years, and were still\r\nyielding eighty tons or more of cane to the acre. It was said, and\r\nall indications substantiate the report, that the entire region was\r\nat one time covered by a great lake! This accounts for the continued\r\nproductiveness of the soil.\r\n\r\nCane grows to a height of fifteen feet, there being a dozen or more\r\nstalks to each hill. It requires eight to ten months to mature. The\r\nfields are divided into sections and cut at different intervals so as\r\nto provide a succession of ripe cane for the mill, and furnish steady\r\nemployment for the several hundred _peons_.\r\n\r\nThe factory is modern in nearly every respect; its capacity is from\r\nfive to eight tons of sugar daily, of good quality. It required a\r\nnumber of years to bring the heavy machinery over the mountains from\r\nBuenaventura. The more cumbersome pieces were slowly drawn up the steep\r\nslopes with the aid of block and tackle and oxen; the apparatus was so\r\narranged that the animals could walk down-hill as they pulled, adding\r\ngreatly to their efficiency. It is necessary to carry a complete stock\r\nof duplicate machinery to use in case of an accident; otherwise the\r\nfactory might have to shut down a year or two while some badly needed\r\narticle was being secured from abroad.\r\n\r\nNearly all machinery is ordered from London, as it can be had more\r\nquickly and better packed than from the United States. I heard\r\nthis same statement in various parts of South America. Although\r\nmanufacturers were beginning to realize that in order to do business\r\nsuccessfully in South America, they must first make a study of general\r\nconditions, they have not done so in the past, with the natural result\r\nthat the bulk of Latin-American commerce has been done with the Old\r\nWorld. It is frequently necessary to ship merchandise on mule-back,\r\nor in small river-craft a distance of many days after its arrival\r\nat a port and before it reaches its destination; it is exposed to\r\nvarying weather conditions--great heat and heavy rains; the treatment\r\nit receives is of necessity very rough. All this means that packing\r\nmust have been done with great care and in a special manner. The fact\r\nthat we have not adopted the metric system, and that there have been\r\npractically no American banks to discount bills, have been further\r\ndrawbacks to the establishment of extensive trade relations between the\r\ntwo peoples.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most attractive thing of all about the Cauca Valley is its\r\nclimate. A record of the temperature kept at La Manuelita during a\r\nperiod of ten years shows the greatest uniformity. The difference in\r\nthe average weekly temperature is only 6° the year around.\r\n\r\nA belt of tall bamboo entirely surrounds the _hacienda_; the giant\r\nstalks of steel-like toughness are armed with long, murderous thorns\r\nand form an interlocking mass that is absolutely impenetrable to man.\r\nContrary to our expectations, birds were not plentiful in this land\r\nof tangled verdure. A few nighthawks dozed on the ground in the deep\r\nshade, and an occasional yellow-headed caracara (_Milvago chimachima_)\r\nthat, perched on the tip of a swaying stalk, gave vent to its feelings\r\nin a succession of shrill, long-drawn screams.\r\n\r\nFarther away, where clumps of woods grew, birds were more plentiful.\r\nThere were many red-fronted parrakeets nesting in holes in dead stubs.\r\nRed-headed woodpeckers (_Chrysoptilus p. striatigularis_) in numbers\r\nhammered on hollow trunks; the strokes are so rapid that the sound\r\nresembles the roll of a snare-drum. Pigmy woodpeckers (_Picumnus_) no\r\nlarger than a good-sized humming-bird, worked industriously on the\r\nsmaller branches. They are obscurely marked mites of feathered energy,\r\nof a dark olive color with a few red dots on top of the blackish head.\r\nWhen the nesting season arrives a tiny cavity is excavated in some\r\npartially decayed limb in which two round, white eggs are deposited.\r\nThese birds are nearly always found in pairs, and when the young leave\r\nthe nest they accompany the parents, forming small family parties that\r\nforage for minute insects among the crevices of rough bark and in\r\ndecayed wood.\r\n\r\nOccasionally it seemed as if we were not so far from our northern\r\nhome after all; for along the edges of the numerous marshes ran an\r\nold acquaintance--the spotted sandpiper. In the reeds yellow-headed\r\nblackbirds chirped and fluttered; but they are slightly smaller than\r\nthe North American birds and have even been placed in a different genus\r\n(_Agelaius_). By walking quietly it was also possible to surprise\r\na deer that had been tempted far from cover by the prospects of a\r\nluscious breakfast in some little plantation. These animals are so\r\ngreatly persecuted that they make off at the first sign of danger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nPOPAYÁN AND THE CERRO MUNCHIQUE\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter spending a few weeks in and about the Cauca Valley, Richardson\r\nand I started southward, while the two other members of the expedition\r\nbegan the homeward journey. I had looked forward very eagerly to my\r\nvisit to southern Colombia because I knew that the country, towns,\r\nand even the people were different from those we had seen heretofore.\r\nBut, above all, because ahead of us lay a vast region little known\r\nzoologically, and we hoped to penetrate into at least the mountain\r\nfastnesses west of Popayán in our insatiable search for the rare and\r\ninteresting wild life that haunted that remote wilderness.\r\n\r\nWe left Cali at noon, May 13, well provided with riding and pack\r\nanimals, and half-breed _arrieros_, and started on the well-beaten\r\ntrail that leads toward the south.\r\n\r\nAt first there was no appreciable change in the valley, but by degrees\r\nthe stretches of absolutely level-appearing land increased in size;\r\ninstead of extensive cultivated areas there were pastures of large\r\nsize, covered with a luxuriant growth of grass. Thousands of head of\r\ncattle were sprinkled over the velvety turf. We rode an hour through\r\none of these ranches just before reaching the river Jamundi. This\r\nestate is the property of one Angel Mario Borreo, who is reported to be\r\none of the most influential men in the Department of Cauca, and is only\r\none of his sixteen similar holdings.\r\n\r\nThe Jamundi is not over one hundred and fifty feet wide at the point of\r\ncrossing, and is spanned by a steel and brick bridge; dense jungles of\r\nbamboo line both banks. Just beyond lies the little town bearing the\r\nsame name.\r\n\r\nA tent-show had been billed to appear here at some time within the near\r\nfuture, and the arrival of our pack-train was mistaken for that eagerly\r\nawaited event. The news spread rapidly and before long the populace had\r\nturned out en masse in the hope of getting a glimpse at the wonders our\r\ntrunks and duffel-bags were supposed to contain. Not until we had taken\r\nrefuge in the little _posada_ or inn could they be convinced of their\r\nerror and induced to return to their homes; but another surprise was in\r\nstore for us.\r\n\r\nThe many and enervating tasks of the day called for our early\r\nretirement, and eight o’clock found us in our cots. Great was our\r\nsurprise to be awakened an hour later by the sound of music at our very\r\ndoor. One of our men was sent to the door to learn the cause of the\r\nserenade and was told that the mayor of the town, with a delegation\r\nof the chief officials and the band, had come to pay us a visit. Of\r\ncourse, there was but one thing to do, and half an hour later found\r\nus out on the special seats that had been prepared, in full view of\r\nthe visitors and perhaps half of the villagers who had accompanied\r\nthem. Then followed speeches, singing, music, and a few native dances,\r\ninterspersed with short intervals for smoking, drinking (a goodly\r\nsupply of _aguardiente_ had been brought along), and conversation.\r\nThe visitors remained until one in the morning; a rather lengthy\r\ncall, to be sure, but a pleasant one, and quite characteristic of the\r\nfriendliness of the Colombians.\r\n\r\nThe next day’s ride of ten hours’ duration brought us to Buenos Aires,\r\na very pretty little town nestling among and almost obscured by gardens\r\nof flowers and orchards of fruit.\r\n\r\nA heavy rain during the night had filled all the sink-holes in the road\r\nwith water, making progress slow on the following day. We rounded Mount\r\nSaint Ignacio early in the morning, and shortly after had our first\r\nview of the volcano Purace; we were to learn more of this mountain in\r\nthe not distant future. Soon after, the _lomas_ or great barren hills\r\nappeared; they form a kind of connecting-link between the Coast and\r\nCentral Ranges. These gently rounded mounds are bare except for a kind\r\nof worthless, wiry grass that in some unaccountable way draws enough\r\nsustenance from the red-clay soil to maintain its meagre growth. These\r\nhills gradually increase in height, but the ascent is by such slow\r\ndegrees that one is scarcely conscious of any rise at all. There are\r\nfew houses, and the small number of inhabitants seem to be as sallow\r\nand lifeless as the hills themselves. A party of people had gathered\r\nat one of the Philippine-like structures near the roadside; they were\r\nchatting excitedly and drinking a good deal of _chicha_. When we\r\ndismounted we found that a child had died and was being prepared for\r\nburial. It sat propped up in a small, rudely made chair, covered with a\r\npiece of white cloth. No one seemed greatly concerned over the death,\r\nleast of all the parents; on the contrary, they were proud of the\r\n_angelito_, and of the attention the event attracted from the people of\r\nthe neighboring country.\r\n\r\nIn perfect accord with our expectations, there was little bird-life on\r\nthe cheerless _lomas_. A few blue tanagers and _Veinte-vi_ flycatchers\r\n(_Pitangus_) lived in the bushes that lined the infrequent rivulets\r\ntrickling through narrow gullies between the hills. The _Veinte-vi_ was\r\nan old acquaintance; its cheery call is one of the first bird-notes to\r\ngreet the ear of the visitor to tropical South America. Its local name\r\nvaries with the locality, and is an attempt by the natives to imitate\r\nthe bird’s cry. Thus it ranges from _Kiss-ka-dee_ and _Veinte-vi_\r\nto _Dios te di_ and _Christi fui_. This flycatcher is of a rather\r\nvivacious disposition, and pairs of them frequently may be seen singing\r\ntogether and beating their wings on the branches.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule these birds are of peaceful habits, except when\r\nnesting; but I have frequently seen them in pursuit of a carrion hawk\r\nat which they darted viciously and continued to follow until lost to\r\nview.\r\n\r\nThe diet of the _Veinte-vi_ is varied, and the bird is most versatile\r\nin capturing its prey. Thus it will sit on a perch above a brook and\r\nplunge in after small fish or tadpoles, somewhat in the manner of a\r\nkingfisher; it may hover over a field and drop upon an unsuspicious\r\nmouse, lizard, or small snake; beetles, grasshoppers, and other insects\r\nare overtaken and captured on the wing. When a victim of some size has\r\nbeen captured, it is beaten rapidly upon a branch until its life is\r\nhammered out. It also hops about in fields looking for worms and grubs.\r\n\r\nThe nest is a huge domed structure, made of grasses and often wool, and\r\nplaced in the branches of a tree six to fifteen feet up. Entrance is\r\ngained through an opening in one side, near the top. On account of the\r\ngreat size of the structure, being about twelve or fifteen inches high\r\nand eight to ten inches thick, it is very conspicuous; the exterior is\r\ncarelessly made, with grasses and streamers of nesting material hanging\r\ndown on all sides.\r\n\r\nThe eggs, two to five in number, although four seem to constitute the\r\nusual set, are long and pointed, cream-colored, and lightly spotted\r\nwith chocolate-brown and purple blotches--mostly on the larger end.\r\n\r\nBesides these species, there were ground-doves, lapwings, and an\r\noccasional sparrow-hawk. The latter is so similar to our common little\r\nterror of the air that it is hard to distinguish between the two.\r\n\r\nShortly after noon we encountered one of the most terrific tropical\r\nstorms imaginable. Hour after hour a perfect deluge of rain poured down\r\nupon us from which rubber _ponchos_ afforded little protection. Flashes\r\nof lightning pierced the semiblackness with blinding shafts of light,\r\nfollowed by deafening crashes of thunder--an indication that we were\r\napproaching the high zone of bleak mountain slopes and paramos.\r\n\r\nThat night we reached Morales, at an elevation of five thousand nine\r\nhundred feet. Fortunately there was no demonstration of any kind to\r\ninterfere with our much-needed rest. Early the next morning, however,\r\nwe experienced the thrill inseparably linked with the sudden display\r\nof one of those hidden forces of nature that forever and inalterably\r\ncontrol our destiny.\r\n\r\nFrom out of the gray and penetrating mist that seemed to envelop\r\nall the world there rose a low, ominous rumbling, distant, yet of\r\nthunderous volume; and the mud-walled, grass-thatched inn shuddered\r\nviolently in unison with the trembling earth.\r\n\r\nThrough the open door of the adjoining room I heard the scratching\r\nof matches and saw the flicker of yellow light reflected on the\r\nwhitewashed wall. A moment later the pious _señora_, surrounded by her\r\nlittle ones, was kneeling before the shrine of the Virgin, chanting\r\na litany in low, monotonous tones. Two tapers flickered hazily. The\r\ngaudy tinsel flowers that decked the image gleamed in the uncertain\r\nlight, but the pitiful squalor, ignorance, and general misery of the\r\nsurroundings were mercifully left in darkness.\r\n\r\nWithout, all was silent, save for the barking of a pack of stray\r\nmongrels which had been asleep on the door-steps of Morales. The\r\nvillage again slumbered, and the chill, damp fog clung to the earth.\r\n\r\nAlone I made my way up the only street, through the mud, to the\r\neminence on which the adobe church stands, overlooking the valley and\r\naffording a view of the tremendous range on each side; for it was\r\nnearly the hour of daybreak and the sun rising above the lofty peaks of\r\nthe Andes presents a scene of matchless beauty.\r\n\r\nWith the first faint glow of light in the east the banks of vapor\r\nbecame dissipated and gradually disappeared. Peak after peak reared\r\nits head above the ocean of snowy whiteness. First of all was Purace,\r\nthe hoary monarch that dominates the southern part of the Cordillera\r\nCentral and spreads terror through the land with threats and warnings\r\nsimilar to those we had just experienced. This great volcano has been\r\nactive for untold ages. A huge column of smoke and vapor ascends\r\ncontinually straight into the clouds, and this, reflecting the light\r\nof the rising sun, makes a magnificent picture. Occasionally at\r\nnight the eternal fires within the gaping crater may be seen tinting\r\nthe low-hanging clouds and the snow that crowns the summit, fourteen\r\nthousand five hundred feet high, with rosy red. All about, the great\r\nbarren lomas are strewn with black boulders, some of immense size,\r\nthat serve to remind the wayfarer of the cataclysms of bygone ages.\r\nEverywhere they dot the hillsides and tower above the trail that winds\r\namong them.\r\n\r\nJust below rises the silent mass of Sotará, crowned with the snow of\r\ncenturies; the precipitous slopes are seamed and worn by the frequent\r\nslides of ice and stones from above, and deep, snow-filled gashes\r\nextend far down below the glittering dome in a ragged fringe. At night\r\nthe moonlight steals softly up the frigid heights and reverently bathes\r\nthe ancient head in a halo of dazzling splendor.\r\n\r\nAs the sun mounted higher and higher the peaks of the Western\r\nRange appeared one by one, like islands in mid-ocean, led by the\r\nawe-inspiring Munchique and followed by his lesser satellites. Between\r\nthe two ranges, in the fruitful valley of the Cauca, Popayán still\r\nslumbered beneath a blanket of billowy softness.\r\n\r\nBy six o’clock the _arrieros_ had corralled the mules and\r\nriding-horses, and half an hour later we were on the march.\r\n\r\nReplacing the dry and barren _lomas_, we now found a bush-covered\r\ncountry with occasional long strips of low forest in the hollows; but\r\nthe trail was an exceedingly difficult one, owing to the rocky nature\r\nof the country and the great boulders that obstruct the way. Frequently\r\na small stream had to be crossed, such as the Rio Piendano, which is\r\nspanned by an arched bridge built of large, hand-made bricks, a curious\r\nrelic of olden Spanish days. Down goes the trail five hundred feet\r\nor more at an angle of forty-five degrees, and then up again on the\r\nother side, the mules snorting and puffing as they creep along at a\r\nsnail’s pace. All the rivers seem to flow through deep gorges. Only\r\nsure-footed mules are of service on this trail, each carrying not more\r\nthan two hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nThe distance from Morales to Popayán is not great; without cargo-mules\r\nit is an easy day’s ride, but with a caravan of tired, heavily laden\r\nanimals that have come all the way from Cali it is the part of wisdom\r\nto spend the night at the little _posada_ La Venta and ride into the\r\ncity early the next morning. Here a room and a good meal can usually\r\nbe had on short notice, but one must carry his own cot and bedding, as\r\nluxuries of this kind are not furnished in Colombian inns except in the\r\nlarger cities.\r\n\r\nWe were up and on our way early the next morning, for it was\r\nmarket-day--the day when the inhabitants from miles around flock to\r\nthe city to buy and sell and to have a good time generally. It was our\r\nfirst visit and we could not afford to miss such an interesting and\r\ntypical sight.\r\n\r\nWhile still several miles distant from Popayán we began to meet small\r\nparties of Indians that dotted the trail, slowly wending their way\r\ntoward the Mecca of the Upper Cauca. By the time we had reached Belen,\r\na settlement of about twenty houses, the trail had widened into a\r\nbeautiful thoroughfare and was crowded with oncoming hordes. These\r\nIndians are probably descendants of the ancient Guanacas, while some\r\nare doubtless the offspring of the tribe of Paeces which inhabits the\r\nCordillera Central to the north. Many, no doubt, still preserve the\r\noriginal purity of the old stock, but the vast majority have mingled\r\nand intermarried with the native Colombians until one finds every\r\npossible stage of intergradation.\r\n\r\nBefore us passed the motliest crowd imaginable, each bearing the fruit\r\nof his toil, to be appraised and sold in the public plaza. There were\r\nsmall family parties, the man leading a decrepit mule that threatened\r\nto collapse at every step, laden with fruit and vegetables, fire-wood,\r\nhemp ropes and bags, calabashes, pottery, or any one of a hundred\r\ndifferent things. The wife, acting as auxiliary beast of burden,\r\ncarried the surplus. A band passed over the forehead supported the\r\nheavy pack; usually a small child was carried in a sling at her side,\r\nwhile several larger children clung to her skirt or trudged behind. As\r\nshe walked she worked, spinning from a bunch of wool or cotton tucked\r\nunder her arm, the spindle, a sharpened stick with a potato stuck on\r\nthe end, dangling from her hands. The most characteristic occupation of\r\nthe women is the making of small fibre bags, or _muchilas_, from hempen\r\ncord. They are meshed entirely by hand as the overburdened worker trots\r\nalong, and when completed somewhat resemble a lady’s shopping-bag. If\r\nthe meshes are close it requires weeks to finish one which would fetch\r\nforty or fifty cents.\r\n\r\nThe men are dressed in loose white-cotton trousers that come below the\r\nknee; then there is the inevitable square of homespun woollen cloth,\r\nusually brownish, gray, or blue, called _ruana_; the head is thrust\r\nthrough a hole in the centre so that it drapes down to the waist,\r\nthe corners often touching the ground and giving the same effect as\r\nthe toga of a Roman senator. At night the _ruana_ takes the place\r\nof a blanket under which the whole family sleeps. A broad-brimmed,\r\nhigh-crowned straw hat completes the outfit. The women are fond of\r\ndark-blue skirts (also the product of their industry), pink waists, and\r\nshawls of almost any color so long as they have fringes. Their hats\r\nare similar to those worn by the men. The feet of both sexes are, of\r\ncourse, bare.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour after leaving Belen we were cantering across the great\r\nbrick bridge that spans the Cauca and forms the entrance to Popayán.\r\nThis bridge is really a marvel of ancient Spanish architecture, five\r\nhundred feet long, forty feet wide, and supported by a series of arches.\r\n\r\nPopayán is one of the oldest and most picturesque of Spanish-American\r\ncities, though by no means the largest. I doubt if its population\r\nexceeds ten thousand. The early history of the city is full of\r\ninterest, and from it one gains an insight into the conditions\r\nattendant upon the conquest and colonization of a large part of\r\nSouth America. Spurred on by the love of adventure and the lust for\r\ntreasure, the _Conquistadores_ overran vast portions of the continent,\r\nestablishing depots here and there from which they could start anew in\r\nsearch of El Dorado, which they were destined never to find. In this\r\nmanner Popayán was founded in the year 1536 by Sebastian de Belalcazar,\r\nthe son of a peasant from the border of Estremadura and Andalusia, in\r\nthe south of Spain.\r\n\r\nAfter founding Popayán, Belalcazar extended his raids down the river\r\nand formed the settlement which to-day is Cali, the largest and most\r\nimportant city in the Cauca. Being a fair example of the usual type\r\nof Conquistador, he showed no mercy toward the Indians, but nearly\r\nexterminated them; the country which had been a fruitful province was\r\nturned into a famine-stricken waste. In the meantime Pizarro had sent\r\nan officer, Lorenzo de Aldana, to arrest his erstwhile lieutenant; but\r\nBelalcazar, satisfied with his conquests, set sail for Spain in 1539\r\nfor the purpose of securing a charter before he could be apprehended.\r\n\r\nThe city lies high up on the level plain, more than six thousand feet\r\nabove the sea, surrounded by rugged peaks, some snow-capped, others\r\nunbridled as yet by the hand of time, presaging catastrophe and\r\ndisaster; and still others covered with impenetrable growths of virgin\r\nforest, untrodden by human foot, and known only to the wild creatures\r\nthat lurk within the dark recesses. Above all hang the fleecy clouds\r\nthat encircle the lofty pinnacles, dip low to meet the earth, and\r\nthen vanish again into space. About the city prevails an air of calm\r\nrepose; an air of sanctity and mysticism that radiates into every nook\r\nand corner, permeating every fibre. The city is famous as a centre\r\nof learning. Its colleges and university, conducted by the Order of\r\nMaristas, attract the youths from all parts of the country. There\r\nare numerous old churches, all very ancient, the gilded interiors\r\nrankling with the damp of untold years. Bells of antique workmanship,\r\nand covered with verdigris, dangle in open niches in the walls or in\r\nthe low, square towers, and hourly call the faithful to prayer in\r\nmonotonous cadence. The cathedral was completed in 1752 after many\r\nyears’ work. In one of the streets a delightful view may be had of\r\nthree successive chapels, one above the other, and of the streams of\r\npious penitents wending their way up the rocky path. There are also\r\nthe overgrown ruins of a house of worship, but I could never quite\r\ndecide whether the edifice had fallen into decay or whether the medley\r\npiles of bricks and rubbish between the four crumbling walls were still\r\nwaiting to be placed in position. The streets, crooked and narrow,\r\nare paved with cobblestones. The buildings are of the old adobe type,\r\none-story and whitewashed, with red-tile or sod roofs. Glass is not\r\nused except in the churches, but the windows are heavily barred.\r\nRecently a few modern brick structures have been erected. A look into\r\nthe corridors and inner courts, of which there may be several in one\r\nhouse, conveys an insight into the domestic life of the people. The\r\nfront courts are very attractive with their flowers, shrubbery, and\r\ntrees, but the rear ones are anything but inviting, the dungeon-like\r\nenclosures reminding one of the stories of atrocities and persecutions\r\ncarried on here in the turbulent times of the Spanish Inquisition.\r\n\r\nOn an average, the people are of a higher class, both intellectually\r\nand physically, than in most Colombian cities of equal size;\r\ncomparatively few negroes are seen, and the good health and bright\r\nlooks of the inhabitants are the natural result of a cool climate and\r\npure mountain air.\r\n\r\nOne day, at noon, as I was photographing in the vicinity of Popayán,\r\nafter having ridden perhaps five or six miles from the city, I was\r\naccosted by an elderly woman who invited me to stop at her humble\r\ncabin, where she had prepared a really palatable lunch. Her reason for\r\ndoing this was that she had recognized me as a foreigner. During the\r\ncourse of the meal she tearfully related that she had had a son, of\r\nabout my own age, who had gone to the States many years before. Had I\r\nmet him, and could I give her any tidings? I could have, but I did\r\nnot. By a strange and inexplicable coincidence I knew that her son had\r\nnot left the country. Instead of going to the coast he had engaged\r\nin one of the revolutions common enough at that time and had been\r\ncaptured and shot; but what right had I to remove the only support that\r\nmaintained the spark of life in her aged body? It was only the hope of\r\nseeing her boy again that gave her the strength to resist the onslaught\r\nof advancing years. Doubtless, she still waits, hoping against hope for\r\nthe message that will never come. Hers is the mother-love that never\r\ndespairs. How clearly it shows that human nature is very much the same\r\nthe world over, even among the lowly!\r\n\r\nOn June 23 I was fortunate enough, while in Popayán, to behold one of\r\nthe religious celebrations formerly all too numerous in Latin America.\r\nIt was the _Fiesta del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús_. Troops of soldiers\r\nand bands were lined up in front of the cathedral; all were quiet and\r\norderly while the sacred rites were being performed within. Suddenly\r\nthe doors burst open, bells boomed and jingled, and the contents of the\r\nvast church poured through the portals in a steady stream. First came\r\nthe altar-boys in white surplices and red cassocks, carrying gilded\r\ncrosses on long poles and lighted tapers in silver holders, followed\r\nby the small children, the girls with tinsel wings, resembling tiny\r\nangels. Then came the governor of Cauca, the prefect of Popayán and\r\ntheir staffs, each bearing a standard. Next in line were the maidens,\r\ncovered with large black shawls, or _mantas_, with folded hands and\r\ndowncast eyes which, however, they were not averse to raising to meet\r\nthe admiring glances cast by some of the onlookers. The students from\r\nthe seminaries and a choir of singers preceded a life-size statue of\r\nthe patron of the feast, borne aloft on the shoulders of stalwart\r\nyouths; then came the archbishop and the higher ecclesiastics in tall\r\nmitres and gorgeously embroidered and glittering robes. Those of the\r\ngeneral public who chose to march fell in line behind the bands that\r\nfollowed, chanting prayers. The remainder knelt in the streets with\r\nbowed, uncovered heads as the procession passed. All the buildings,\r\neven the trees, were gayly decorated with banners, a mixture of the\r\npapal and national insignia. Colombia is perhaps the only remaining\r\ncountry in the New World in which religion still dominates the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nIf we examine a map of Colombia we will find that the Cerro Munchique,\r\nthe highest of the mountains in the Western Range, lies directly\r\nwest of Popayán. There is an exceedingly difficult pass across the\r\nCordillera at this point, leading to a place called the Cocal, still\r\nfar distant from the coast. A trail was also being opened a short\r\ndistance to the south leading to the Rio Micai. When this is completed\r\nit will require a four days’ journey on mules to the river; then two\r\ndays in canoes on the Micai, said to contain many rapids and to flow\r\nthrough country inhabited by savage tribes, before the coast is reached.\r\n\r\nA day’s ride from Popayán took us to El Tambo, and at noon the\r\nfollowing day we were in the Indian village of Chapa at the very base\r\nof Munchique. A heavy electrical storm delayed our departure until\r\nnoon the next day. There were but a dozen or fifteen adobe huts in the\r\nvillage, and during the height of the tempest one of these suddenly\r\ncollapsed into a heap of mud and straw; the occupants barely escaped by\r\nfleeing into the deluge when the buckling walls apprised them of their\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nAfter the agitation had subsided the people erected an altar in the\r\nplaza for the celebration of a mass of thanksgiving. Each one brought\r\nsome trinket--a few paper flowers, a picture, a bit of tinsel, or a\r\ncandle--with which to embellish the sacred structure. Then they all\r\nknelt, with bared heads, and in deepest devotion assisted at the\r\nreligious service; that is, all but a plump Indian woman who boiled\r\n_chontaduros_, or palm-nuts, in a huge kettle, in back of one of the\r\nhuts and sold them to the worshippers the moment devotions were over.\r\n\r\nIt required fully a half-day longer to reach the end of the mule\r\ntrail, and by that time we had reached an elevation of eight thousand\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nFrom this point up the mountains are covered with a dense growth of\r\nprimeval forest. Below this elevation there are occasional strips of\r\nwoods and patches of brush interspersed with clearings. Maize grows\r\nsplendidly up to an altitude of seven thousand feet; this was proven\r\nby the few small fields cultivated by the Indians. The slope was also\r\ndotted with areas planted in rice.\r\n\r\nThe ascent of Munchique is very abrupt; there are no streams near the\r\nsummit, as the top of the mountain is composed of solid rock that sheds\r\nrain as soon as it falls. The highest pinnacle is a flat, bare rock,\r\nabout ten thousand feet above sea-level.\r\n\r\nRobert Blake White states that from this spot one may “obtain a view\r\nover more than fifteen thousand square miles of country. The whole of\r\nthe Central Cordillera, from the frontier of Ecuador to the confines of\r\nthe State of Antioquia, with the valleys of the Cauca and the Patia,\r\nwere visible to the north, east, and south; whilst, on turning to the\r\nwestward, the Pacific coast from the bay of Tumaco to the mouth of the\r\nSan Juan River seemed spread out like a map before us.\r\n\r\n“A more gorgeous panorama cannot well be imagined. The belts of\r\nbright-colored vegetation, marked by the valleys with their winding\r\nrivers and streams, were backed with masses of the Cordillera with\r\ntheir varied tints and snow-capped peaks. On the other hand, the\r\ndark-hued vegetation of the virgin forests of the Pacific slopes\r\nstretched down to the ocean’s margin, which with its thousand bays\r\nand inlets and fringe of foam which was quite visible, looked like an\r\nedging of lace. The island of Gorgona could be distinctly seen.\r\n\r\n“The Cerro Munchique should be visited in the dry season, for its\r\npeculiar prominence makes it a grand lightning conductor, as we clearly\r\nsaw from the shattered rock on the summit.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cerro Munchique.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A deserted Indian hut on the Cerro Munchique.]\r\n\r\nWe discovered a deserted Indian hut in the centre of a large,\r\novergrown, abandoned plantation, and made it our headquarters for a\r\nweek or more. The site was ideal. Tall forest hemmed in the clearing\r\non all sides, and a rivulet of clear, icy water flowed near the\r\nshack. The elevation was eight thousand two hundred and twenty-five\r\nfeet. Obviously, the place had been unoccupied for a number of years,\r\ndoubtless owing to the fact that maize and rice would not thrive at\r\nthis high altitude. However, these same conditions were most congenial\r\nto a host of other vegetation. Blackberries and rhododendrons, with\r\nlilac, red, white, pink, and yellow flowers formed a solid tangle,\r\nacres in extent, and creepers entirely covered the tall, dead stubs,\r\nand crowned them with a thick canopy of green leaves from which\r\nclusters of orange and scarlet trumpetflowers drooped.\r\n\r\nAt night the temperature went down to about 45°, but this did not deter\r\ngiant hawk, owl, and sphinx-moths from appearing at dusk to feast\r\non the nectar of the myriads of flowers. The little stream was the\r\nrendezvous for numberless frogs. One hardly suspected their presence\r\nduring the daytime unless a careful search was made of the rotting\r\nwood that littered the ground, and of the tangled, snakelike stems\r\nof second-growth sprouts and leaves; but at night the concert was\r\nalways sure to begin in startling volume. Some of the notes reminded\r\nme of our own spring peeper; others were sharp and metallic, like the\r\ntwanging of a banjo-string; and others were low and mellow like the\r\nmurmuring of a ’cello. They all blended into a deafening chorus of\r\nunflagging animation and unvaried monotony. At first the din was rather\r\ndisconcerting, but gradually there came to us the realization that this\r\nwas but the bubbling over of care-free little hearts rendering a song\r\nof happiness and thanksgiving to nature for the pure, unsullied joy of\r\nan unfettered existence.\r\n\r\nBirds were not particularly plentiful in the forest. There were,\r\nhowever, a number of interesting forms, particularly among the\r\ntanagers. One species (_Psittospiza riefferi_) was about the size of\r\na robin and of a deep grass-green color, with a chestnut-colored face\r\nand abdomen; these birds live singly and in pairs in the tall trees\r\nand are of a wary disposition. Another tanager (_Sporathraupis_) has a\r\nbright-blue head and olive-green back; the breast is deep, dull blue\r\nmerging into golden yellow on the legs. The natives called this bird\r\n_jilguero_, a name applied to the solitaire in other localities. It\r\nlives in the lower branches of trees, travelling in pairs or small\r\nflocks and feeds on fruit; the song is not unpleasant, but cannot\r\ncompare with any solitaire known to me.\r\n\r\nWhile collecting one morning my attention was attracted by a chorus\r\nof chirps and screams, and following up the sounds I reached a tall\r\ntree where a peculiar bird drama was being staged. A number of\r\nCalifornia woodpeckers (_Melanerpes flavigularis_) had drilled numerous\r\nholes in the tree-trunk, from which sap trickled in small streams.\r\nA dozen or more buff-tailed hummers (_Boissonneaua flavescens_) had\r\napparently come for their daily jag, for the sap very evidently had an\r\nintoxicating effect. Arriving in a bee-line, newcomers landed against\r\nthe trunk, where they clung like so many moths, the buff-colored tail\r\nspread wide and against the bark for support. Their antics as the\r\ndifferent stages of hilarity were reached were most amusing. They\r\ntwittered, fought, turned, and tumbled in the air; others dozed on\r\nsmall twigs, and several fluttered toward the ground in an exhausted\r\ncondition. This performance continued daily for a week, until the sap\r\nsuddenly ceased to flow; then the tree was deserted and silent, the\r\ncapricious band having no doubt sobered up from their debauch and gone\r\nback to their normal and more profitable pursuits in life.\r\n\r\nIn getting water from the brook, one of our men discovered a narrow\r\ntrail under a giant log. We justly surmised that animals of some sort\r\nused the runway in journeying to and from the water. A trap was set in\r\nthe path, and next morning a fine white opossum of large size had been\r\nsafely ensnared. In the days that followed we secured an even dozen of\r\nthe animals. They proved to be a form unknown to science that now bears\r\nthe name _Didelphis paraguayensis andina_. The cook said that they were\r\ndelicious eating, and prepared for us an unusually fat individual; but\r\nwe found the meat of rather strong flavor, and not very palatable. A\r\nsolitary weasel (_Mustela affinis costaricensis_) was also taken in the\r\nsame spot. It would be interesting to know whether this animal came\r\ndown to drink, or was in pursuit of some of the other creatures that\r\nfrequented the runway. Weasels are courageous, active, and bloodthirsty\r\nlittle animals; their eyesight is poor, but their sense of smell is\r\nkeen and they will tirelessly follow their intended victim until it\r\nfalls into their clutches. I have frequently heard that they attack\r\nand kill small deer by clinging to the neck and doggedly chewing their\r\nway through the skin until the jugular vein is severed; this does not\r\nseem probable to me, however, and it is far more reasonable to believe\r\nthat rats, mice, frogs, and other small creatures form the bulk of\r\ntheir prey. On account of their slender proportions, they can trail the\r\nquarry through small holes and crevices; in addition, they are also\r\nexpert climbers. On one occasion, while “squeaking” to attract a bird,\r\na weasel came instead, looking for the supposed helpless creature, and\r\nran over my feet without suspecting the fraud.\r\n\r\nThey will fight savagely to protect their nest, usually made in a hole\r\nin the ground or hollow stump, and I know of one instance where one of\r\nthe animals sprang into the face of a native who had trapped its mate\r\nat the mouth of a burrow.\r\n\r\nNearly a month had passed since we left Popayán, but the time had been\r\nspent so pleasantly and profitably that it seemed scarcely longer than\r\na week. Our scheduled time for the region had been exhausted, however,\r\nso we reluctantly retraced our steps to Popayán.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE ANDES SOUTHWEST OF POPAYÁN; CRUISE OF THE _CALDAS_\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter our return to Popayán we spent a few days wrapping and packing\r\nthe large collection of birds and mammals that had been secured on the\r\nCerro Munchique; and, during the odd moments when this work became\r\narduous, we sought information about the mountains south of the place\r\nwe had just visited. Eventually our quest took us to the governor’s\r\npalace, where we had the good fortune to meet the executive of the\r\nprovince of Cauca, Doctor Alfredo Garcés.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that attracted our attention was a framed poem hanging\r\nabove his desk; the title of it was “Death to Foreigners”; but the\r\nkindly and sympathetic governor soon dispelled any doubts we may have\r\nharbored as to his feelings. He was a man of great refinement and\r\neducation, and had travelled extensively in the United States. Our\r\nmission interested him greatly. He brought out maps and charts, and\r\nthen, with the aid of a pair of powerful field-glasses, showed us the\r\nplaces he had pointed out on the drawings.\r\n\r\nDoctor Garcés proved to be one of our best and most highly valued\r\nfriends, despite the rather alarming notice on his office wall. He\r\ncalled on us at the inn several times each day, and admired the birds\r\nand mammals we had collected. Our rooms were always in the state\r\nof greatest upheaval with packing-cases, equipment, provisions,\r\nand a hundred other things occupying each available place; but the\r\ngovernor took it all as a matter of course, enjoyed delving among\r\nour possessions in search of things unknown to him, and probably\r\nconsidered himself fortunate if he could find his silk hat and cane in\r\nthe place they had been left when he was ready to leave.\r\n\r\nJune 24 found us again upon the trail, heading south-westward. Both the\r\nCentral and Coast Ranges were visible for many miles, the snow-covered\r\nPurace and Sotará dominating the former, with Munchique standing\r\nunequalled in the latter. Barren, rolling hills stretched away in the\r\ndistance like the waves of a storm-tossed sea; this undulating country\r\nis the first indication of a connecting-link between the two ranges.\r\n\r\nFor two days there was no perceptible change in the country; but on\r\nthe morning of the third day, shortly after leaving the settlement of\r\nMonos, we entered virgin forest at an altitude of seven thousand five\r\nhundred feet. A shelter-house, known as San José, is just a thousand\r\nfeet higher up, and at ten o’clock we were up ten thousand one hundred\r\nand forty feet. From here one has an unrivalled view of thousands of\r\nsquare miles of country. The magnificent valley, appearing greener and\r\nmore level from our height than was really the case, lay below, and\r\nstretched far to the north. The paramos and volcanoes flanking the\r\nfar side were abreast of our station. Frequently, while in similar\r\npositions, there recurred to me the sentiment so aptly expressed by\r\nHudson: “Viewed from the top of a lofty mountain, the world assumes a\r\nvastness and varied beauty that revive the flagging spirit and refresh\r\nthe soul.” And quite as certainly there is forced upon our recognition\r\nthe infinitesimal smallness of man when compared to the immensity of\r\nnature--a mere atom existing by virtue of a benevolent force that has\r\nso ordained, but that reserves the power to crush the whole fabric of\r\nlife at a breath.\r\n\r\nThe top of the ridge is ten thousand three hundred and forty feet\r\nhigh, and the vegetation is typical of the temperate zone; low, dense\r\nbushes, mingled with the gnarled branches of stunted evergreen trees\r\nand shrubs, burdened with clumps of red and lavender flowers. Numbers\r\nof low grass shacks had been built along the trail; some of them\r\nwere very long and housed the peons working on the road to Micai.\r\nAlthough these structures were of comparatively recent origin, many\r\nsmall rodents had been attracted to them by the corn that formed the\r\nprincipal article of food of the _peons_. A large brown rat (_Oryzomys\r\npectoralis_) was very abundant; apparently this rodent had formerly\r\nexisted in small numbers only, for it was rare out in the open; but\r\nthe artificial conditions created by the settlement of the region had\r\nproved so congenial that it increased rapidly. The same is true of\r\nseveral other species of rats that almost overran the houses.\r\n\r\nIn riding or walking along the trail, I frequently encountered a\r\nspecies of snake resembling in coloration a coral snake; however, it\r\nwas not unusual to find an individual five feet or even more in length,\r\nand two or three inches through in the thickest part. They appeared\r\nexceeding sluggish and even refused to move although almost trodden\r\nupon. We never molested them, as they appeared to be harmless, and were\r\nreally of striking beauty. Unfortunately, we had no way of preserving\r\nany. A species recently discovered in Nicaragua by Mr. Clarence R.\r\nHalter, which is similar to the one we saw almost daily, belongs to the\r\ngenus _Coronella_.\r\n\r\nThe birds belonged to a typical temperate-zone fauna. Among them was a\r\nnew species of beautiful honey-creeper (_Diglossa gloriosissima_); it\r\nis black with blue shoulders and a deep-rufous abdomen. They clambered\r\nabout over the clusters of gorgeous flowers, feasting on the nectar\r\nthey contained. Another common bird was a tanager (_Iridosornis_) the\r\nsize of our redbird, but of a bright-violet color that merges into\r\ngreenish blue on the wings. The head is black excepting the crown,\r\nwhich is deep orange. It is a vivacious creature, travels in small\r\nflocks that frequent the taller shrubbery, but possesses limited\r\nsinging powers only.\r\n\r\nDuring our stay we had occasion to witness a christening ceremony\r\nperformed by a priest who was travelling through the region for the\r\npurpose of ministering to the people’s spiritual needs. The fact had\r\nbeen widely advertised, so early on the appointed day many natives\r\nappeared, bringing small children to be baptized. About thirty had been\r\nbrought by noon, when the priest commanded the god-parents to line up,\r\neach holding his gaudily dressed and probably fretful little charge.\r\nThe priest began at one end of the row, dispensing one part of the\r\nsacrament to each child as he passed; then he went back and began all\r\nover again, giving the second part to each of them, and so on until the\r\nrite was completed.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that there was a small child in the hut we had chosen\r\nfor our several days’ sojourn. To honor the _gringos_ who were stopping\r\nunder her roof, the señora asked Richardson to be the little one’s\r\ngodfather, while I was permitted to suggest the name. We naturally felt\r\nas if we should give the baby a present, but a thorough ransacking\r\nthrough my effects revealed only a can of talcum powder, which I\r\npromptly presented to the mother. A few days later she came to me in\r\ndistress: “The baby has a slight fever,” she said. “I gave it some of\r\nthe white powder you made me a present of, but it did no good. How much\r\nis it necessary to take at one time?”\r\n\r\nThe western slope of the range is very abrupt. Large forces of men\r\nwere engaged in cutting a narrow ledge for a footpath into the face of\r\nthe steep mountainside. The trail wound back and forth continuously;\r\nlooking over the rim of the narrow shelf one could count six or eight\r\nloops underneath, one below the other.\r\n\r\nThe work of cutting such a way is hazardous for the men engaged in\r\nit. The soil is loose and saturated with water, so landslides were\r\nof frequent occurrence; and whenever the irresistible avalanche\r\nswept the precipitous terrain, it usually carried one or more of the\r\nlaborers with it and buried them under tons of rock and débris. It was\r\ninvariably hopeless to try to find the body, so the survivors simply\r\nerected a cross on the spot. Frequently there were several crosses\r\ntogether, and in one place I counted seventeen standing side by side.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon we reached a lone hut in a small clearing--the\r\nhastily erected shelter of a group of _peons_. The men invited us\r\nto stop, and as the locality looked interesting we accepted the\r\ninvitation; but we erected our tent and lived in it in preference to\r\nthe hut.\r\n\r\nAll the surrounding country was covered with virgin forest. It had\r\nnever been trodden by man, at least not within many years; there were\r\nno side trails of any kind, so that it was impossible to penetrate very\r\nfar.\r\n\r\nAmong our first mammals were a doe and fawn of a little forest-deer\r\n(_Mazama setta_). They are commonly known as brockets or spike-bucks,\r\nas each horn consists of a single prong. I believe that these deer\r\nare not so rare as generally supposed, but they are seldom collected\r\non account of the difficulty of hunting them in the thick jungle. The\r\n_peons_ shot the ones we secured. They had discovered a path leading to\r\na small stream, and concealing themselves on the opposite side, waited\r\nuntil the animals came down to drink; then they shot them. The men also\r\nbrought in a huge bushmaster that they unearthed while clearing away\r\nunderbrush. The deadly reptile is known as _equis_ to the natives on\r\naccount of the black X-shaped marks on its back.\r\n\r\nThe mountainsides were scarred with deep fissures and ravines filled\r\nwith the darkest and most impenetrable of forests. It was possible\r\nto look across from one side to the other, but crossing them was\r\nimpracticable. Each morning I could see a flock of some thirty-odd\r\nswallow-tailed kites soaring just above the trees on the far side of\r\none of the ravines. The magnificent birds resembled huge white-bellied\r\nswallows, or swifts, as they circled majestically over the dark forest;\r\nthey uttered shrill screams all the while. Apparently they fed on\r\nthe wing, and specimens collected by us later had eaten quantities\r\nof large beetles and flying ants. At about nine o’clock the band\r\nalways resorted to the top of a tall tree that towered far above its\r\ncontemporaries for a short rest; this was rather unusual, as the\r\nbirds are rarely seen perched, and the natives said they never alight\r\nduring the daytime. Live birds, or specimens freshly killed, have\r\nthe glistening black back covered with a beautiful grayish “bloom”\r\nor powder that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. However, this\r\ndisappears soon after death.\r\n\r\nA species of pigmy squirrel (_Microsciurus_) lived in the forest, but\r\nwe seldom saw any of the little creatures scarcely bigger than one of\r\nthe larger kinds of mice. I have always found these animals much rarer\r\nthan the ordinary squirrels; usually they live in pairs. They seem to\r\nprefer forests abounding in palms and to feed on the various kinds of\r\npalm-fruits and nuts. They frequently evince a great deal of curiosity\r\nand can be approached to within a short distance before taking fright\r\nand scampering out of sight among the leaves.\r\n\r\nThe minute creatures move rapidly and gracefully and make long, daring\r\nleaps. In running over the leaves and branches they follow the lateral\r\nstems, and on reaching the ends ascend through the tree-top or thick\r\nfoliage by leaping crossways from twig to twig, as if ascending the\r\nrungs of a ladder.\r\n\r\nI kept one that was given to me by the natives as a pet for some time.\r\nIt made its home in the pocket of my flannel hunting-shirt, where it\r\nwas always sure to find a bit of cracker or sugar, and to which it\r\ncould retreat when frightened. Whenever anything of an unusual nature\r\noccurred, the bright, inquisitive little eyes always appeared suddenly\r\nso as not to miss a single thing that might be of interest. It never\r\nattempted to bite or run away, and seemed perfectly contented with the\r\ncompany of the friends that fed and protected it.\r\n\r\nEventually we started back toward Popayán. We crossed the high\r\nbrush-covered divide July 4; a violent electrical storm had been staged\r\non the wild mountain-top as if in noisy celebration of the day. It\r\nbegan with a dark mist that covered everything. Then rain and hail fell\r\nuninterruptedly for more than an hour, while lightning flashed and\r\nblue-green flames seemed to leap toward the blackened rock. Sometimes\r\nthe bolts came from above, and again they were below us so that we\r\nwere enveloped in a weird, ghastly light. The thunder was terrific and\r\nkept up a continuous crash and rumble. It was impossible to see any\r\nother member of the expedition on account of the thick haze--there was\r\nno shelter of any kind--only the narrow shelf-like trail that snaked\r\nits way along the steep slope. After the storm we made camp; the men\r\nand mules kept straggling in until a late hour; they were very wet and\r\nmuch bedraggled, but apparently none the worse for the nerve-racking\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nPopayán was reached without further incident. Richardson’s contract\r\nhaving expired, he determined to leave the country, so we returned to\r\nCali to rearrange the equipment and pack the collections; then he left\r\nfor Buenaventura to take a north-bound steamer.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Doctor Chapman, who had reached New York, arranged\r\nto send down a man to fill the vacancy left by Richardson. Doctor\r\nArthur A. Allen, of Cornell University, was selected for the place. He\r\nreached Cali about the middle of August and accompanied me during the\r\nsucceeding eight months.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with instructions received from Doctor Chapman, I\r\nimmediately planned an expedition northward, then toward the east to\r\nmake a zoological exploration of the forests bordering the Quindio Pass\r\nand of the high paramo of Santa Isabel. The first stage of the journey\r\nwas down the Cauca River.\r\n\r\nRegular steamboat service is maintained between Guanchito and Cartago\r\nduring the rainy season. The _Sucre_, a boat of small size, makes\r\nfrequent voyages, requiring about three days’ time each way. On this\r\nvessel one may travel in comparative comfort--if one is not too\r\nsqueamish. We had to be content with a smaller craft, however, as\r\nthere was not sufficient water to float the _Sucre_ over the numerous\r\nsand-bars.\r\n\r\nThe _Caldas_ is a little steel launch of not over fifty feet from stem\r\nto stern, with a beam of fifteen feet and drawing eighteen inches of\r\nwater. When the river is full the _Caldas_ is used to carry freight\r\nonly, for which purpose she doubtless serves admirably; but at other\r\ntimes she assumes the double responsibility of carrying both cargo and\r\npassengers. Of course there is the alternative of going overland; but\r\nthe trip takes twice as long, and after having spent some time on the\r\nmuddy trails, the novelty of a river trip is likely to make a strong\r\nappeal, whatever the odds.\r\n\r\nOn the announced date of sailing thirty-seven individuals of all\r\nsizes, ages, and shades of color gathered on the river’s bank, each\r\nimpatient to be the first to cross the narrow plank and board the small\r\ncraft. There also waited a huge mound of boxes, bags, bales of hides,\r\nand other freight; this was loaded first and piled in the front and\r\nrear. The engine occupied the centre of the boat, as did the kitchen.\r\nWhen the people were finally permitted to go aboard, there was a\r\nwild scramble to the top of the heap of boxes and bundles. To sit up\r\nstraight under the sheet-iron roof was impossible; fortunately the sun\r\nshone intermittently only or we should have been suffocated.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning there was enough of interest to keep one’s\r\nnerves tensed to a high pitch. The crumbling banks, great chunks\r\nof which settled gently into the water as the waves, caused by the\r\nlaunch’s propeller, washed away the last bit of restraining sand;\r\nthe numbers of bamboo rafts laden with bananas, plantains, and other\r\ntropical fruits on their way to the port of Guanchito; the dark-skinned\r\nfishermen who cast their nets into eddies and quiet pools, and the\r\nwashwomen, each smoking an enormous black cigar and beating the clothes\r\nupon stones until one expected to see them fly into shreds, were very\r\ninteresting. There were also hundreds of cormorants and anhingas that\r\nswam and dived or flew up into the trees; some of them sat on snags\r\ndrying their wide-spread wings.\r\n\r\nThe banks of the river are very high and abrupt in most places, and the\r\nstream runs through a tortuous channel. At each bend the current dashes\r\nwith great force against the bank, and then rebounds on down-stream.\r\nThe little _Caldas_ could not hope to battle against the rushing\r\ntorrent, so she would head straight for the bank; frequently her nose\r\nstruck the soft sand and held fast; then the current swung her around\r\nand back into midstream, where after spinning around a few times she\r\nregained her poise and was swept along. As wood was burned exclusively,\r\nstops had to be made every few hours for a new supply. The launch, in\r\nher crowded condition, had little room for fuel, but the brief pauses\r\ngave those on board an opportunity to go ashore--a welcome respite from\r\nthe cramped position made necessary by the limited space available on\r\nthe boat. At one of these spots an extensive cacao-plantation lined\r\nthe bank, the tall _madres de cacao_ reaching high up into the heavens\r\nabove their lowly but precious protégés. The “mother of cacao,” it\r\nmight be said, is a species of _Erithmas_ planted to protect the\r\ndelicate cacao-trees from the sun. A colony of snake-birds or anhingas\r\nhad selected this grove for a rookery. Thousands of the birds sat on\r\nthe topmost branches while other countless numbers were flying back and\r\nforth in endless streams, each bird a component part of a whirling,\r\nliving mass. The slender body, long thin neck, small head, and sharp\r\nbill give the bird a peculiar appearance; when swimming under water\r\nwith only the neck protruding it greatly resembles a snake--hence the\r\nname snake-bird. Each tree within an area of several acres contained a\r\nnumber of nests; they were clumsy structures made of sticks. The eggs,\r\nthree or four in number, are white and as long as a hen’s egg but only\r\nhalf as wide. Later in the day a flock of scarlet ibises approached\r\nfrom down-stream, flew past, and then disappeared like twinkling bits\r\nof flame.\r\n\r\nIn the early afternoon the _Caldas_ struck a sand-bar with full force.\r\nThe greater number of the passengers had eaten their luncheon--brought\r\nby themselves in small parcels neatly done up in banana leaves--and\r\nwere quietly dozing. There was a harsh, grating sound, a shock, and the\r\nwater swirled around and past the boat, which moved not an inch. The\r\nengines were reversed and the crew sprang into the river and pushed,\r\nbut it availed nothing, so after repeated efforts these attempts were\r\nabandoned. Luckily, the craft carried a small dugout canoe, into which\r\nthe passengers were unloaded, three or four at a time, and taken ashore\r\nby two husky negroes who waded to the bank, one pulling and the other\r\npushing the canoe. There was no break in the abrupt banks for perhaps\r\na quarter of a mile, so it was some time before all on board had been\r\nlanded. The crew then began to dig away the sand that held the launch\r\nfast.\r\n\r\nThe spot where the passengers had been landed was an open, treeless\r\nplain with not a shelter in sight. At first the heat of the sun was\r\ninsufferable; then it began to rain as we had never seen it rain\r\nbefore. No one had a poncho, so there was nothing to do but stand\r\nquietly and endure the drenching downpour.\r\n\r\nWhen the sand had been dug away the launch, suddenly freed, shot\r\ndown-stream a half mile before a landing could be effected. This of\r\ncourse necessitated a long tramp through deep mud and tall, wet grass,\r\nwhich added to the cheerlessness of the luckless, half-drowned victims\r\nof backward methods of transportation. The banks were as steep as ever,\r\nbut a capybara runway, resembling a giant muskrat slide, had been\r\ndiscovered, and down this we slid, one at a time, into the arms of two\r\nnegroes who acted as a back-stop below.\r\n\r\nThe delay prevented the launch from reaching Buga, so as soon as\r\ndarkness settled, she was tied up for the night. A great tree-trunk,\r\nembedded in the sand with huge branches swaying high above the water,\r\nlay near by. We swung our hammocks between the sturdy limbs, covered\r\nthem with mosquito-nets, and spent a miserable night; those who\r\nattempted to sleep aboard had a harder time of it by far.\r\n\r\nWe were off with the first streak of dawn, startling flocks of muscovy\r\nducks and herons from near the banks. A faint blue mist was rising\r\nslowly from the water, and the air was chill and damp. The mantle of\r\nsilence that falls over tropical South America at nightfall had not yet\r\nbeen lifted. For some little time we glided on, farther and farther, it\r\nseemed, into a great vacuity that led to some vaguely defined sanctuary\r\nof everlasting peace and oblivion. Then, without warning, a sound so\r\nterrible rent the vast solitude that it seemed as if some demon of the\r\nwilds were taking a belated revenge for the few hours of quiet in which\r\nthe earth had rejoiced.\r\n\r\nAt first there was a series of low, gruff roars that would have done\r\ncredit to the most savage of lions, and made the very air tremble; but\r\nthis was not all. Added to the majestic frightfulness of the jungle\r\nking’s voice was a quality of hate and treachery, of unfathomed rage\r\nand malicious bitterness. Then followed in quick succession a number\r\nof high-pitched, long-drawn wails or howls of tremulous quality\r\nthat gradually died, ending with a few guttural barks. This uncanny\r\nperformance lasted a number of minutes; but having perpetrated this\r\noutrage upon a heretofore peaceful world, the weird chorus suddenly\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\nThe mists of night had lifted, revealing clumps of tall bamboo and\r\nthe beginning of heavy forest. In the top of the very first trees sat\r\na group of large monkeys, red, with golden backs, properly called\r\nhowling monkeys; they were the authors of the terrific chorus we had\r\njust heard. How an animal that rarely attains a weight of thirty\r\npounds can produce such loud sounds is most remarkable; the hyoid bone\r\nis developed into a huge cup which gives resonance to the voice. The\r\nhowlers are rather sluggish and seldom descend from the trees. Their\r\nroaring, which can be heard several miles, resounds through the forest\r\nmorning and night; whether it is merely a form of amusement with them,\r\nor is used to intimidate enemies, seems to be unknown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The _Caldas_ fast on a sand-bar in the Cauca River.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bamboo rafts on the Cauca River.]\r\n\r\nVery little is known about the habits of howling monkeys, despite\r\ntheir abundance and wide distribution. They are usually found in small\r\nfamily parties, including young of various sizes; but I have noticed,\r\non various occasions, that the females desert from the troop when their\r\nbabies are males and do not rejoin it until the young are half-grown,\r\nperhaps fearing that the old males will kill them; but I do not know if\r\nthis is always the case.\r\n\r\nC. William Beebe, in the course of a lecture at the American Museum,\r\nstated that he had on several occasions watched troops of these animals\r\nfeed, in British Guiana. The older ones sent their small young to the\r\ntip of the slender branches that they, themselves, could not venture\r\nupon on account of their weight, to pick fruits; then they pulled the\r\nlittle ones back and robbed them of their food. This was repeated a\r\nnumber of times.\r\n\r\nThe second night we tied up near a heavy growth of forest, at a place\r\ncalled Riofrio. This is one of the few sections of the Cauca Valley\r\nstill retaining its original stand of virgin jungle. We slung our\r\nhammocks between the trees. The nets furnished ample protection from\r\nthe mosquitoes, but not from an army of foraging ants that chanced our\r\nway. From across the river came the whine of an ocelot, and the sharp\r\nsnort of deer, while more than once we were awakened by the pattering\r\nand shuffle of cautious feet close at hand, some light, some heavy as\r\nif belonging to a large animal.\r\n\r\nContrary to her custom, the _Caldas_ steamed on after dark on the third\r\nnight of her voyage. A train of bright sparks trailed far behind, and\r\nwhen the wind blew it carried them into the boat where they set fire\r\nto clothing and baggage alike. Within a short time we had reached the\r\nport of Cartago, found the _arriero_ who was awaiting us with the\r\nanimals, and were off for Cartago a league away. The town was enveloped\r\nin inky blackness, and fast asleep, notwithstanding the early hour. A\r\nstray dog barked and a mule whinnied, but there were no other signs of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nCARTAGO TO THE PARAMOS OF RUIZ AND SANTA ISABEL\r\n\r\n\r\nDawn revealed the fact that Cartago was not materially different from\r\nCali. It was not so large, however, and the temperature was much\r\nhigher. Upon our arrival the preceding night we had finally succeeded\r\nin arousing a sleepy landlord, who admitted us to a dusty, bare room in\r\nthe Hotel Colombia. We had learned long before this time that the word\r\n“hotel” usually meant a roof only over one’s head and perhaps food,\r\nso we at no time travelled out of sight of our baggage, with which we\r\ncould make ourselves fairly comfortable under almost any circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe country surrounding Cartago is level and of a dry nature; at any\r\nrate, it does not compare at all favorably with the Cauca Valley at\r\nCali. We saw few evidences of cultivation and the number of cattle and\r\nmules grazing on the scanty vegetation was very small.\r\n\r\nThe outskirts of the city are picturesque. The huts are low and lightly\r\nbuilt of slabs of flattened bamboo; fences made of split bamboo neatly\r\nwoven in a basket pattern surround them, and cannon-ball trees rear\r\ntheir slender, awkward branches laden with great glistening spheres\r\nof green fruit, high above the narrow, muddy sidewalks. When the\r\nhuge calabashes are ripe they are collected and used as containers\r\nfor water, wash-basins, bowls, and a variety of utensils; narrow\r\nsections that have been split carefully and resemble miniature pointed\r\nbarrel-staves even serve the purpose of spoons.\r\n\r\nA small marsh lies just in back of Cartago. It was filled with several\r\nspecies of aquatic plants--mostly water-hyacinths and wild lettuce\r\non which cattle fed, half submerged in the murky water. Swarms of\r\nmosquitoes issued from the stagnant borders and invaded the town at\r\nnightfall, but this was by no means the only breeding-place of the\r\nobnoxious insects. Drinking water, kept in uncovered kegs and pots,\r\nteemed with larvæ, and glasses full of it set before us in one of the\r\nshops were fairly alive with wrigglers.\r\n\r\nOne thing impressed me as being really appalling, and that was the\r\nnumber of infirm beggars in the streets. In most Colombian towns\r\nbeggars are permitted to ply their profession only one day each week\r\nand are required to wear a cardboard license tag suspended from a\r\nstring around the neck; but it seemed as if they were out in full force\r\nevery day in Cartago. Some of them presented an offensive appearance;\r\nthey were suffering with leprosy and other terrible diseases, and were\r\nin such a pitiful plight that one was literally touched at mere sight\r\nof them. They always asked alms in the name of the Virgin and all the\r\nsaints, and if results were forthcoming heaped a copious blessing on\r\nthe donor; but in the event that nothing was given the benediction\r\nwas in some instances replaced by such a tirade of profanity that one\r\nquickly realized what a good opportunity to acquire merit had been\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\nWe left Cartago as soon as possible and after a half-day’s ride\r\nover gently rolling, brush-covered country reached the Rio Viejo. A\r\ngood-sized dwelling known as Piedra Moller stands near the river; there\r\none may obtain men and dugout canoes with which to cross the stream.\r\n\r\nBeyond the river the trail passes through a little valley or depression\r\nabout four leagues across. Tall brush, some first-growth forest, and\r\nextensive jungles of bamboo flank the narrow passageway. I counted\r\nno less than forty species of birds during the afternoon and heard\r\nthe notes of several others that I did not recognize. Small green\r\nparrakeets (_Psittacula conspicillata_) were exceedingly plentiful.\r\nThey always reminded me of English sparrows--not in appearance but by\r\ntheir actions. Flocks of them sat on telegraph wires or house-tops,\r\nchirping and chattering incessantly, or fed on fruits or seeds in the\r\nbushes. They are also abundant in towns and villages and nest under\r\ntile roofs, in hollow posts, and in holes in walls. The people are very\r\nfond of the little “love-birds” as they are called and keep them in\r\ntheir patios as pets.\r\n\r\nAt Balsas, which served as the first night’s stopping-place, we\r\ndiscovered a whippoorwill’s (_Stenopsis ruficervix_) nest in a clump of\r\nbamboo. The single egg had been deposited on the leaves near a bamboo\r\nsprout that was rapidly pushing its way upward like a huge stalk of\r\nasparagus. The incubating bird fluttered away as we approached, but we\r\nreturned the next morning and Allen secured a photograph of her on the\r\nnest.\r\n\r\nNoon of the next day found us at Finlandia, an inviting village with a\r\npopulation of about four hundred, and situated at an elevation of six\r\nthousand four hundred feet. All this country is the foot-hills of the\r\nCentral Andean Range. Rounded hills follow one another in a succession\r\nof gentle billows, the sides of which are so gradual that one hardly\r\nrealizes there is a steady ascent. The forest that covers the ridge on\r\nthe other side of Finlandia is of a heavy, subtropical character--the\r\nfirst of its kind we had encountered on this trip. Red howling monkeys\r\nwere roaring in the ravine below, but the birds of the forest belonged\r\nto a fauna different from the one we had just left.\r\n\r\nThe palm-filled valley of the Boquilla had been reached by night.\r\nSalento, with its low, whitewashed houses, was clearly visible on top\r\nof the next ridge. It required just thirty minutes next morning to\r\nreach the town after a climb of nine hundred feet. We did not stop at\r\nthe settlement, but continued up the time-honored trail leading to\r\nQuindio Pass; within a short time forest of the most promising kind had\r\nbeen reached and camp was being made in a sheltered spot about half a\r\nmile above a lone house called Laguneta. The pack-animals were sent\r\nback to Salento, where there was an abundance of pasturage, until they\r\nshould be required again.\r\n\r\nThe woods at Laguneta were rather open and there was little underbrush.\r\nThe trees, however, were burdened with moss, bromelias, orchids, and\r\nother epiphytes. Climbing bamboo and creepers filled the few clearings\r\nwith impenetrable thickets. Most of the vegetation had small, harsh\r\nleaves, and the stems were gnarled and stunted. Clusters of fruit\r\nresembling pokeberries, on which numerous species of birds fed, grew on\r\ntall bushes near the forest’s edge. Begonias covered with red and white\r\nflowers filled the hollows.\r\n\r\nThe Laguneta region was remarkable for the number of ant-birds found\r\nthere (_Grallaria_, _Chamœza_, etc.) that are rare in collections\r\non account of the difficulty of collecting them. We secured fifteen\r\ndifferent species in the neighborhood. As they live in thickets and\r\non the ground, the only knowledge one has of their presence is their\r\nstrange whistling notes, distinct in each species, that come from some\r\ngloomy spot deep in the tangled vegetation. _Grallaria squamigera_ was\r\nto me the most interesting species. It is a huge, heavy-bodied bird,\r\nolive above and tawny barred with black below. From a distance the\r\ncoloration reminds one of a large immature robin, but the tail is very\r\nshort and protrudes only about half an inch beyond the lower coverts,\r\nand the long legs measure fully five inches. The plumage is long and\r\nfull. Occasionally we saw the shy creatures as we worked in front of\r\nour tent in the afternoons; we always made it a point to be very quiet\r\nand the reward came in the way of shadowy forms that unconcernedly\r\npursued their lives among the logs and brush without suspecting our\r\npresence. This shows the advantage of camping in the midst of the\r\nwilderness, where one is sure to see and hear wild things at the most\r\nunexpected times--experiences that are lost if one does not spend his\r\nentire time in the very heart of their environs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The town of Salento.]\r\n\r\nSquirrel Woods is the name we applied to a spot below Laguneta and\r\nseveral miles nearer to Salento. On the upward journey the place\r\nhad been singled out as being unusually attractive for a week’s\r\ncollecting, owing to the number of birds and particularly of squirrels\r\nseen from the trail. This, however, proved to be the one place in all\r\nColombia where we were not welcome, and in this regard it is unique in\r\nmy two years’ experience in that country.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the Quindio trail we followed a narrow path through\r\nfields and forest for nearly a mile. It led to a neat, new cottage\r\nsurrounded by pastures in which there were cattle and horses. The\r\nowner and his wife, middle-aged Colombians of the mestizo class, but\r\nof better appearance than the average, did not seem overjoyed to see\r\nus; they had no room, they said, for strangers. Explanations and the\r\ndisplay of credentials bearing flaring, important-looking seals were\r\nof no avail; the people did not care to have the drowsy tenor of their\r\nways disturbed by a couple of gringos. The region, however, was too\r\nalluring to forego, so we camped beside the house and took possession\r\nof the veranda for sleeping-quarters. There we remained a week, much to\r\nthe displeasure of our unwilling hosts.\r\n\r\nWe had supposed that the presence of a wheat-field surrounded by\r\nprimeval forest had led to an increase in the number of small mammals\r\nindigenous to the region, but this assumption proved right in so far as\r\nsquirrels only were concerned. A granary had been built in the centre\r\nof the clearing, which was of considerable extent; bundles of grain\r\nwere piled in it from floor to roof. Squirrels of three species came\r\nfrom the woods, and ensconcing themselves in the structure feasted\r\non the wheat. They ran the entire distance between the forest and\r\nthe house on the ground, taking advantage, however, of any logs or\r\nbranches that littered the place. They were especially plentiful in\r\nthe early morning and just before sundown. If one crept cautiously to\r\nthe border of the field he was sure to see dark little forms scamper\r\nover the ground and disappear in the storehouse. The animals were very\r\ntame at first and did not leave their shelter until one was but a few\r\nyards away; then they appeared on all sides and ran quickly to the\r\nprotecting woods. Later they posted a sentinel or remained on the\r\nalert, for no sooner did we reach one side of the clearing than all the\r\nsquirrels hurried away on the opposite side, being careful to keep the\r\ngranary between themselves and us. There were many stray dogs in the\r\nneighborhood; they pursued the squirrels while making their pilgrimage\r\nacross the open space, and devoured any they succeeded in catching.\r\n\r\nThere were also other marauders that exacted a heavy toll in grain from\r\nthe farmer. Yellow-throated woodpeckers (_Melanerpes flavigularis_)\r\nand green and yellow jays (_Xanthoura yucas_) were always about and\r\nfrequently came to grief in our traps set for small rodents.\r\n\r\nA species of pigmy opossum (_Thylamys caucæ_) lived in the woods. It is\r\nthe size of a mouse, but has a longer tail. The slate-colored little\r\nanimals prefer small cavities in tree-trunks for their homes, where\r\nthey spend the days curled up in sleep; if disturbed they are very\r\nsluggish and may be taken in the hand, their only concern being to find\r\na dark spot where they can snuggle up to one another and go to sleep\r\nagain. At night they are more active and go on foraging expeditions for\r\nfruit, insects, and almost anything of an edible nature they can find.\r\n\r\nThe camp pet at this time was a young sloth (_Cholœpus andinus_). The\r\nslow-moving little beast reminded one of a “Teddy Bear,” and when\r\nit clambered among the branches of a tree it always recalled to me\r\nHudson’s description to the effect that he “hugged the branches as if\r\nhe loved them.” Our pet had been brought in by a native hunter who had\r\nshot the mother and found the young one clinging to her long, gray\r\nhair. It was easy to handle owing to its inactivity, but occasionally\r\nit struck viciously with its front feet, each armed with two formidable\r\nclaws, and also snapped suddenly in an attempt to bite, its strong\r\nteeth enabling it to inflict severe injury. It ate quantities of tender\r\ngreen leaves at regular intervals, but it was always necessary to first\r\nsprinkle them liberally with water and then feed them to the little\r\ncreature one at a time and in quick succession. I have kept a number\r\nof sloths at various times and found that they thrived on young shoots\r\nand buds of many trees and plants, such as cacao, cabbage, lettuce, and\r\nalmost any succulent vegetation.\r\n\r\nI know of no animal that appears more stupid and lifeless than a sloth.\r\nThey move with great difficulty and in a sprawling posture on the rare\r\noccasions when they descend to the ground, on account of the peculiar\r\nformation of the feet; nor do they attain any great speed while moving\r\nin the tree-tops, where they always maintain an inverted position\r\nexcept when climbing up or down a trunk. When resting they roll up\r\ninto a ball, and as a species of green alga not infrequently grows on\r\nthe fur, they are very inconspicuous among the leaves and moss-covered\r\nbranches of their home--at least when viewed from below. But from above\r\nthey do not always escape the sharp eye of the harpy-eagle, which is\r\ntheir chief enemy.\r\n\r\nIn spite of its lifeless appearance, it would be difficult to find\r\na mammal more tenacious of life; in this respect it resembles the\r\nreptiles. Sloths will withstand the most frightful wounds and\r\nfrequently make their escape after having been shot many times. The\r\nnatives are very fond of the flesh and not infrequently capture the\r\nanimals when cutting down trees in clearing land; a favorite way to\r\nkill them is by drowning, but this is a lengthy and barbarous process,\r\nas it requires a long submergence before the creatures cease struggling\r\nand life is extinct.\r\n\r\nPeople of the lower class attribute peculiar powers to the sloth. They\r\nsay that when one of the animals finds it necessary to descend to the\r\nground it is unable to climb back to its lofty perch; but a friendly\r\ncloud is always hovering near by which envelops it and carries it back\r\nto any desired station in the tree-tops. In some localities they also\r\nattribute the wild call of the giant goatsucker to the sloth. The only\r\ntime I heard the latter utter any sound was when a mother called to her\r\nyoung that was a few feet away; she gave a fairly loud ‘peep’ and her\r\noffspring at once went to her.\r\n\r\nAfter a time our work at Squirrel Woods was completed, so, much to the\r\nrelief of the inhospitable couple, we left the place and returned to\r\nSalento, where we had better fortune and were well cared for by one\r\nColonel Martinez; his wife had come from Bogotá, was a well-educated\r\nwoman, and, what interested us more just then, was a splendid cook. The\r\nfamily conducted a fairly good _posada_ and shop and had various other\r\nbusiness interests, including several worthless mining claims along\r\nstreams flowing into the Quindio River just below. A few excavations\r\nhad been made into the hillsides; the largest was known as _La Mina del\r\nGallo_ and had yielded hundreds of tons of rocks and earth; but as not\r\na speck of the elusive yellow metal they so eagerly sought had been\r\nforthcoming, the mine had been abandoned, and owls and bats inhabited\r\nthe dark tunnel. The greater part of the mining population had\r\ndeserted Salento for a place about ten miles distant, where extensive\r\ncinnabar-fields had been discovered. They expected to acquire fabulous\r\nriches extracting the mercury from the deposits. Some Englishmen headed\r\nby a man named Lloyd-Owen were also interested in the enterprise, but I\r\nlearned later that the prospect failed.\r\n\r\nAt dusk we occasionally had a brief view of the Nevado del Tolima far\r\nto the east. The snow-capped summit is over eighteen thousand feet\r\nhigh, but we could never see more than a small portion of it on account\r\nof the ridges that surrounded it. At night the snowy dome gleamed\r\nwhite and frosty beneath a brilliant moon, and chill winds blew from\r\nthe frigid heights and roared through the town. The paramos of Ruiz\r\nand Isabel, composed of high, cold valleys, plateaus, and snow-covered\r\npeaks are south of the Tolima. We straightway resolved to visit that\r\nregion, and as the rainy season with its severe electrical storms was\r\nfast approaching, no time was lost in starting on the expedition. My\r\nexperience on the Cerro Munchique was still too fresh to make me want\r\nto duplicate it or expose any other members of the party to a similar\r\nordeal.\r\n\r\nSeptember 12 found us wending our way along the Quindio River toward\r\nits headwaters. The valley floor is covered with grass that is kept\r\nclose-cropped by cattle and horses. Low shrubbery grows along the\r\nriver-bank; the stream--not over one hundred feet wide--is clear and\r\nswift and the icy water rushes over a boulder-strewn bed. A scattered\r\ngrowth of tall palms dots the entire valley and extends up the\r\nmountainsides to an elevation of about nine thousand five hundred feet.\r\n\r\nThe trail is so indistinct that Allen and I, who were riding in advance\r\nof the pack-mules, lost it and spent two hours in a vain endeavor\r\nto recover the way; then we saw the cargoes and peons far below,\r\nresembling moving black dots, and hurriedly rejoined them just as they\r\nwere leaving the valley for the abrupt slope. The trail from here\r\nonward was steep and rough. Before us stretched a seemingly endless\r\nsuccession of ridges, farallones, tall rocks, and high precipices that\r\nreach a climax in the brown paramo of Santa Isabel, backed by walls of\r\ngleaming snow. In looking back over the way we had just come we could\r\nsee the Quindio and the thousands of palms growing in its valley spread\r\nbefore us like a map.\r\n\r\nThe lower slopes were barren, having but recently been burned over;\r\nfire was still raging in a number of places and the hissing and popping\r\nof burning vegetation could be heard frequently with distinctness.\r\nTall, smouldering stumps were clustered here and there like blackened\r\nchimneys from the tops of which wisps and columns of smoke ascended\r\ninto a hazy sky. The pungent odor of burning green plants was at times\r\nalmost suffocating.\r\n\r\nForest begins at nine thousand five hundred feet. It is at first\r\nsomewhat open and reminded us of Laguneta. The rich mould of the\r\nforest floor was very deep and caused us much anxiety lest some of\r\nthe pack-animals be lost, for they sank into it to a great depth, and\r\nthere was constant danger of their floundering and pitching headlong\r\ndown the mountainside. The arrieros took the utmost precautions, but\r\neven then one of the mules became overbalanced and fell off the trail.\r\nFortunately the trees grew close together and one of the packs became\r\nwedged between two of them and halted the rolling creature a short\r\ndistance below. It struggled there with feet in the air until the peons\r\nreleased it and led it back to the trail.\r\n\r\nToward evening we reached a native hut--the second since leaving the\r\nvalley. The elevation of the place was ten thousand five hundred feet.\r\nA large clearing in which white clover grew abundantly surrounded the\r\nhouse. The inhabitants also had other clearings farther down, where\r\nthey planted corn and wheat. They were all suffering with colds and\r\nthe dreaded _dengue_, from which I was fortunately able to give them\r\nsome relief with the aid of our medical kit. In return for this service\r\nthey treated us most courteously and placed one of their two rooms at\r\nour disposal, although it happened that a score or more of chickens\r\noccupied the same quarters. The night was cold and damp. Next morning\r\nthe wretched people gave us milk and cheese and we purchased several\r\ndozen eggs--certainly a great luxury in such an out-of-the-way place.\r\nThey also showed us the skin and feet of a tapir one of the men had\r\nkilled in the forest above. The hide had been used to make bottoms\r\nfor chairs and was of a black color. They reported the presence of\r\ntwo species of bears, one entirely black and the other the tolerably\r\nwell-known spectacled bear. Although the latter is the only species of\r\nbear supposed to exist in South America, I have been told repeatedly by\r\nthe people that a large black bear is found in the high Andes and have\r\nseen skins that appeared to bear out their statements.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the house next morning we soon reached heavy mountain\r\nforest. A deserted hut stood near the border of it, so on our return\r\nfrom the paramo we spent several days there. The chief attraction about\r\nthe place was the abundance of white-throated sparrows (_Brachyspiza\r\ncapensis capensis_). Their cheerful little song cannot fail to endear\r\nthem to any one with even a limited æsthetic nature. Whether one hears\r\nit in the hot, tropical lowlands or on a bleak mountain-top twelve\r\nthousand feet above sea-level, the happy little melody is always the\r\nsame. Nor is the music confined to the hours of daylight only. I have\r\nfrequently heard it in the darkest hours of night, ringing clear and\r\nsweet from somewhere out in the all-pervading blackness. These birds\r\nare fond of the proximity of man and are most abundant where he has\r\nchosen to break the soil and erect his abode. As a general rule they\r\nare not gregarious, but I have seen them congregate in flocks of many\r\nthousands to spend the night in some particularly attractive spot in\r\nplaces where sleeping sites were limited in number. Farther south these\r\nsparrows also gather in flocks of varying size during the winter season.\r\n\r\nThe nest is a neat, cup-shaped structure made of fine grasses; it is\r\nplaced in a low bush or on the ground. Two or three pale-blue eggs\r\nthickly spotted with brown are laid and not infrequently two broods are\r\nreared in a season.\r\n\r\nDuring our stay at the solitary house on the edge of the great forest\r\na white-throat or _chingolo_ came daily and perched on the bannister\r\nof our porch to pour out its overflow of happiness. We grew very much\r\nattached to the confiding feathered mite and eagerly awaited its\r\nfrequent visits. After a short time I discovered the runway of some\r\nsmall rodent under the porch and set a trap to catch the animal. Not\r\nlong after we heard the dull snap of the spring, and upon investigation\r\nfound the limp body of the unfortunate songster. The place seemed\r\ndeserted without the sprightly little bird and we never ceased to miss\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe belt of forest through which we penetrated before reaching the\r\nparamo was magnificent. A species of orchid bearing long spikes of\r\nyellow flowers was in full bloom; there were many hundreds of the\r\nthick-leaved plants, some perched on lofty branches, others growing\r\nfrom crotches but a few feet above the ground, but all surmounted by a\r\nglorious halo of golden blossoms.\r\n\r\nWe left the forest with its giant moss-covered trees, ensnaring\r\ncreepers, and breathless silence that suggests a thousand mysteries,\r\nat about noon. It ends abruptly and is replaced by a narrow strip\r\nof low, dwarfed trees and bushes with small leaves that are either\r\nvery stiff or are covered with thick down. There were also clumps of\r\nblueberry-bushes, but the fruit was woody, bitter and inedible for\r\nhuman beings. Lupines and gentians grew in the hollows and numerous\r\ncomposites thrived on the slopes; among the latter was one with showy\r\npurple flowers that the peons called “arnica.”\r\n\r\nAfter a stiff climb of an hour we gained the summit of a rise; the\r\nwhole panorama of the paramo was spread out before us--a marvellous\r\nseries of brown plateaus, sunken valleys with tiny rivulets meandering\r\nthrough them, and stern ridges dotted with blackened, rocky peaks. The\r\nsnow-fields of the higher altitudes were entirely obliterated by banks\r\nof cold, gray clouds.\r\n\r\nThe word _páramo_ means an elevated plain, barren of trees,\r\nuncultivated, uninhabited, and exposed to the icy blasts of wind from\r\nthe higher elevations. This description exactly fitted the country\r\nbefore us. We descended into one of the valleys, at the head of which\r\nlay a placid lake of small size, and made camp at the base of one of\r\nthe protecting walls of rock that flanked it. The elevation of the\r\nvalley is about twelve thousand seven hundred feet, and the main peaks\r\nof the range hemming in the paramo rise to a height of sixteen thousand\r\nfeet or more.\r\n\r\nLong, wiry grass covered the valley floor; the top was bent over,\r\nforming a billowy expanse of brown, variegated here and there with a\r\ndiminutive patch of green. Lifting any one of the tufts disclosed a\r\nlabyrinth of tunnels and runways apparently made by small mammals;\r\nbut, strange to say, we saw a small number only of rabbits, and few\r\nrats came to our traps. If the network of tunnels harbored other\r\ncreatures, they effectively succeeded in evading our every effort to\r\ndiscover them. Probably the denizens of this underworld had learned\r\nthe value of extreme caution and wariness because numbers of eagles\r\n(_Lophotriorchis_) were always soaring overhead ready to pounce down on\r\nany of them that for an instant relaxed their vigil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The lake on the paramo of Santa Isabel.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Snow on the paramo of Ruiz.]\r\n\r\nA large part of the soil was springy beneath our step; it was\r\nundermined by numberless rivulets which trickled from the slopes and\r\nmade their way to the stream in the centre of the valley. These wet\r\nplaces were covered with extensive areas of daisy-like plants having\r\nclumps or rosettes of stiff leaves; the squat, green hummocks were\r\nstrong enough to support one’s weight, but walking over them was always\r\naccompanied by the feeling that they might give way suddenly and\r\nprecipitate one into the deep mire. Sphagnum flourished along the edges\r\nof the marsh where it was not too wet.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar, gray, mullein-like plant called _frailejón_ thrives in\r\nrocky places that were sheltered to some extent; but clumps of the\r\nplants also braved the open, wind-swept slopes and grew to the very\r\nedge of the snow-fields.\r\n\r\nThe heavy, orchid-laden forest through which we passed just before\r\nreaching the paramo encroached upon the valley’s lower end, but for a\r\nshort distance only. There were well-worn trails made by tapirs and\r\ndeer that came nightly to feed on the abundant grass, for despite the\r\ndry and withered appearance of the upper layer there was a deep carpet\r\nof tender green shoots underneath.\r\n\r\nThere was an abundance of birds on the paramo, especially along the\r\nbush-grown banks of the streamlet; but all were of dull colors--slaty\r\nblue, gray, black, or deep brown, that harmonized well with the bleak\r\nsurroundings. Their habits reminded us of open-country birds of the\r\nnorthern United States. Gray flycatchers ran over the ground; at\r\nfrequent intervals they mounted high in the air, like horned larks, for\r\nwhich we at first from a distance mistook them. A small wren-like bird,\r\nblack with brown flanks (_Scytalopus sylvestris_), lived in the taller\r\nherbage. It had a piping note that could be clearly heard fifty yards\r\naway, but the agile bird was hard to see on account of its obscure\r\ncolor and mouse-like habits that kept it constantly in the thickest\r\ncover. Numerous marsh-wrens (_Cistothorus æquatorialis_) inhabited the\r\nsedges, scolding and nervously flitting about.\r\n\r\nMore interesting than the foregoing, however, were large Andean snipe\r\n(_Gallinago nobilis_) bearing at least a superficial resemblance to\r\nthe American woodcock. Single individuals or pairs of these birds\r\nwere found running over the bogs and drilling in the soft earth.\r\nIn many places the ground was perforated with dozens of the deep,\r\nsymmetrical holes where the tireless workers had labored diligently for\r\na meal. Shooting them was good sport. They sprang into the air with\r\na piping bleat and then sped away in a zigzag course for fifty or a\r\nhundred yards, dropped back to earth and instantly merged into their\r\nsurroundings so completely as to be invisible.\r\n\r\nThe finches were perhaps better represented than any other family of\r\nbirds. A few goldfinches, in small bands, frequented the flowering\r\nshrubs. A kind of slaty finch (_Phrygilus unicolor grandis_) was far\r\nmore abundant and fairly evenly distributed over the entire paramo.\r\nWe discovered a nest of this species among the grass at the base of a\r\nfrailejon; the structure was beautifully made of down taken from the\r\nleaves of the plants that sheltered it. It contained two pear-shaped\r\neggs of a greenish color heavily speckled with fine dull-brown dots.\r\n\r\nFrom a distance the small lake at the head of the valley appeared to\r\nbe a promising field for investigation. It yielded, however, but a\r\nsolitary Andean teal greatly resembling the gadwall (_Chaulelasmus_),\r\nthat was swimming on the unruffled water, and when this had been taken\r\nour work in that particular spot was completed. The bottom of the pond\r\nwas covered with a solid mass of long _algæ_ far out as we could see;\r\nthese concealed any aquatic life that may have existed in the chilly\r\ndepths.\r\n\r\nThe weather was usually agreeable during the greater part of the day,\r\nthe thermometer registering in the neighborhood of 76° at noon, and\r\ndropping to 30° at night. It rained little, but banks of clouds rolled\r\nin frequently and precipitated a superabundance of moisture.\r\n\r\nOne day Allen and I undertook an exploration trip to the snow-line. We\r\nstarted at daybreak, taking with us our guns, an abundant supply of\r\nammunition, cameras, and a small parcel of lunch. We made straight for\r\nthe head of the valley, passed the lake, and had soon reached the top\r\nof the weathered ridge that formed the first barrier to our progress.\r\nFrom the summit, fourteen thousand four hundred feet up, we could see\r\nnumerous other isolated depressions like the one we had just left;\r\nin one of them was a newly made trench--probably the work of some\r\nventuresome miner who had drifted to this lonely place in search of\r\ngold. So far we had had not a glimpse of snow on account of the heavy\r\nmist. We followed along the top of a hogback running northward and\r\ngradually leading to higher country that flattened out into a marshy\r\nplateau on its farther end. Progress was difficult. At each step the\r\nbog quivered within a radius of several yards and the clumps of matted\r\nvegetation depressed by our weight were quickly covered with water that\r\noozed from below. This was an ideal spot for snipe and several sprang\r\nup as we painfully picked our way over the treacherous ground; but the\r\ngreat exertion and high altitude had a demoralizing effect on our aim,\r\nwith the result that we were relieved of a good deal of ammunition\r\nwithout securing a single bird in return.\r\n\r\nA high wall of bare rock rose just beyond the confines of the bog,\r\nand gaining the top of it we were up fifteen thousand feet. It was\r\ncovered with blackened rock fragments--mostly the result of weathering,\r\nbut some of them probably detached from the many towering crags and\r\ncolumns by the shattering force of lightning. The highest point in the\r\nwall is fifteen thousand two hundred feet. As we rested a moment to\r\nrecover our breath, a procedure necessary every twenty steps, the fog\r\nsuddenly lifted and disclosed the snow-bound slopes of Ruiz a short\r\ndistance away. Between us lay a valley flanked by perpendicular walls\r\nof rock and hundreds of feet deep. The snow apparently extended down\r\ntwo hundred feet lower than our station, making its lower limit fifteen\r\nthousand feet.\r\n\r\nWe stood lost in admiration at the marvellous spectacle that\r\nunfolded itself before us. The hurrying curtains of clouds revealed\r\never-changing scenes. One moment miles of slopes covered with a\r\nwhite mantle of snow stood out in bold relief; the next, they were\r\nwhisked from view and bare pinnacles of dark rock, like the spires of\r\na cathedral, appeared momentarily high above, their ragged outlines\r\nsoftened by a veil of thin blue haze. Again, the lower edges of the\r\npanorama came into view, revealing glaciers and avalanches of snow and\r\nrocks perched on the brink of the wall ready to plunge with a boom into\r\nthe deep valley.\r\n\r\nThe floor of the valley was a series of ponds and morasses. Ducks\r\ndisported in the cold water, all oblivious of our presence, and\r\napparently safe in their, at least to man, inaccessible retreat. A\r\nraging torrent tore along the base of the wall, adding its roar as a\r\nfitting accompaniment to the general awe-inspiring character of its\r\ndesolate and inhospitable surroundings.\r\n\r\nA whisp of vapor borne on a chill wind hurried across the intervening\r\nchasm and blew into our faces. Time had passed faster than we realized\r\nand we discovered that half of the afternoon was gone. Hurriedly we\r\nbegan to retrace our steps along the wall of rock and through the\r\ntreacherous bog. By the time the sharp ridge was reached, clouds in\r\nsuch volumes had rolled in over the paramo that everything was obscured\r\noutside of a radius of a few yards from us. There was no trail of any\r\nkind, and even the most familiar rocks assumed strange shapes swathed\r\nin the dank vapor. A compass is useless under such circumstances.\r\nBefore long we reached the interlacing mass of ridges and, after\r\nholding a consultation, followed along the top of one that seemed to\r\nlead in the right direction. We stumbled along for two hours or more,\r\nand then realized that we were lost. Darkness was fast approaching and\r\na raw wind swept down from the region of perpetual ice and snow. We\r\nbegan to look for a sheltered spot in which to spend the night, for it\r\nnow seemed certain that each step was only taking us farther from camp.\r\nJust then a rift in the clouds appeared, and before it again closed we\r\ncaught sight of a faint glimmer far below and to the right. That could\r\nmean but one thing: it was a reflection from the lake at the head of\r\n“our” valley. For more than an hour we had been travelling in exactly\r\nthe opposite direction. We gave up the thought of a bed of frailejon\r\nleaves without regret and stumbled down the steep slope straight for\r\nthe spot where the lake had flashed into view. After many collapses\r\nfrom thirst and fatigue we reached the brook with its crystal, ice-cold\r\nwater; then progress was easier, and within another hour the glow\r\nof the camp-fire appeared through the haze, and soon we were snugly\r\nensconced in the depths of our blankets.\r\n\r\nA few days after our journey to Ruiz the weather changed greatly.\r\nLow-hanging fogs covered the paramo day and night; lightning flashed\r\namong the clouds, and frigid gales roared over the plateaus. These were\r\nsigns of the coming winter and warned us to leave the paramo before\r\nit was too late. Soon there would be only snow and ice, penetrating\r\nmists, the reverberating roll of thunder, and blinding displays of\r\nelectricity. The elements would be unleashed and in all their grandeur,\r\nand awe-inspiring frightfulness take possession of the upper world.\r\nLife would then be unendurable, so we accepted the warning and returned\r\nto Salento.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE CHOCÓ COUNTRY ON THE WESTERN COAST OF COLOMBIA\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon returning to Cartago from our expedition to the bleak paramo\r\nof Santa Isabel, we began preparations for a visit to the notorious\r\nChocó, which lies along the western coast and within the San Juan River\r\nwatershed. This section of the country presents the other extreme\r\nin climatic conditions. It has been rarely visited by naturalists\r\non account of its inaccessibility; and the few who have succeeded\r\nin forcing their way within its inhospitable borders have found it\r\nimpossible to remain any length of time. Malarial and yellow fevers are\r\nendemic among the natives, but quickly sap the vitality and life of\r\nnewcomers into the region; rain falls daily--four hundred inches being\r\nthe average precipitation for one year--and the heat is so intense that\r\nwhen the sun appears during the intervals between showers the whole\r\njungle is converted into a steaming inferno. Small wonder, then, that\r\nthe fabulous wealth in gold and platinum of the Chocó has been little\r\nmore than touched.\r\n\r\nOur plans called for an overland trip to Nóvita on the Tamaná River;\r\nafter reaching that point local conditions would have to guide our\r\nsubsequent movements. Trail there is none, but a footpath, often so\r\nfaint that it loses itself among the vegetation or in the beds of\r\nstreams, serves the purpose of partially guiding the stalwart negro who\r\ncarries the mail to Nóvita at infrequent intervals, as well as others\r\nwho undertake to cross the Western Range into the tropical lowland.\r\n\r\nThe townspeople of Cartago had heard a good deal, in a general way,\r\nabout conditions existing in the Chocó, but they could give no\r\ninformation of practical value. We haunted the market and other places\r\nwhere _peons_ congregate in numbers in our endeavor to secure porters\r\nfor the trip. The few who reluctantly expressed a readiness to go did\r\nnot seem physically fit for such strenuous work, so I rejected them.\r\nOne day a caravan of oxen arrived from the settlement of Salencio, and\r\nI hastily engaged them for the return trip, as these animals, while\r\nslow, are sure-footed, and can pick their way through mud and jungle\r\nthat horses could not penetrate.\r\n\r\nLeaving Cartago, we crossed the arid Cauca Valley; the land west of\r\nthe river is more rolling than on the opposite bank, but the character\r\nof the plant life is much the same. Within an hour Ansermanueva, a\r\ncluster of twenty or thirty adobe hovels, was sighted in the distance,\r\nbut the trail divided just before reaching the village and we followed\r\nthe southern branch. Beyond this fork the climb into the mountains\r\nbegan; there are two ridges, six thousand eight hundred feet and seven\r\nthousand five hundred feet high respectively, with a ravine of five\r\nthousand eight hundred feet between. The “cloud” forest does not begin\r\nbelow the top of the first ridge; then there is an abundance of mosses,\r\nferns, bromelias and other epiphytes forming a growth that is both rank\r\nand beautiful, and equalling in density that found in any other region.\r\nThe greater luxuriance of the flora on the western slope indicated a\r\nheavier rainfall on that side; this is accounted for by the fact that\r\nthe summits of the various ridges stop the moisture-laden winds from\r\nthe Pacific, to a large extent, and cause them to precipitate the water\r\non the ocean side of the divide.\r\n\r\nWithin two days we arrived at Salencio, small, dilapidated, situated\r\non a little plateau between the peaks, and inhabited mainly by\r\nhalf-breeds. We were advised to wait until the weekly market-day, when\r\nmany people from the surroundings would come to town, and it would be\r\npossible to secure porters for the continuation of the journey. In\r\nthe meantime we made short excursions into the neighboring forest;\r\nthey yielded several novelties, among them a splendid example of the\r\nmilitary macaw (_Ara m. militaris_). This gorgeously colored bird is\r\nrare, indeed, and we have never seen more than two at the same time.\r\nSpectacled bears were said to be common and to come to the clearings\r\nwhen corn is ripe; the number of pelts exhibited by the inhabitants\r\namply verified their assertion.\r\n\r\nWhen Sunday came, and with it the gathering of people always present\r\nwhen market is held, we had no trouble in engaging the required\r\n_peons_, each of whom agreed to carry a pack of seventy-five pounds.\r\nEarly the next morning they appeared, eager and ready for their\r\nundertaking. They shouldered their loads and started away at a fast\r\ngait, while we brought up the rear of the column to prevent straggling.\r\n\r\nThe way lay across a low, forested ridge, and then adhered closely to\r\nthe bamboo-covered banks of a small stream called locally Rio Cabeceros\r\nor Rio Vueltas, but which is really the headwaters of the Sipi River.\r\nAt one time we waded in the knee-deep water a distance of over three\r\nmiles, as it was easier than to force a way through the matted plant\r\nlife on either side. I soon discovered that the porters did not possess\r\nthe endurance of those we had previously employed on other expeditions,\r\nand I believe this was due to the fact that the use of coca leaves is\r\nunknown in this part of Colombia. Whenever our _peons_ had an abundance\r\nof coca to chew they seemed tireless in the performance of their work;\r\nthose not given to the habit required large and frequent meals, ate\r\n_panela_ all day long as they marched, and were capable of covering a\r\nshort distance only in the course of a day’s walk. We were compelled to\r\nhalt early and chose the top of a knoll for a camping site.\r\n\r\nA steady downpour of rain had fallen the entire afternoon, which\r\ncontinued throughout the night, and this, coupled with the severe\r\ncold (the elevation being seven thousand two hundred feet) and the\r\ndesirability of preparing hot food, caused us to long for the comforts\r\nof a huge camp-fire. Dry wood was out of the question, but the men\r\ncut down a tree, the green wood of which burned readily, and had soon\r\nstarted a fire adequate for working purposes. Their ponchos, which had\r\nbecome saturated with water, were of no service in keeping them warm,\r\nso they sat up the entire night, singing, telling stories, and drinking\r\nhot coffee in their endeavors to remain cheerful and keep warm.\r\n\r\nOn the following day the vegetation was far more dense, and advantage\r\nwas taken of numerous narrow fissures in the mountainside roofed over\r\nwith logs and moss; through these tunnels we crawled on hands and\r\nknees, but that was easier than forcing a way through the tangled mass\r\nof plants growing above. When camp was made that night the base of a\r\ntree was selected for a fireplace. At first glance it seemed that the\r\ndiameter of the vine-covered trunk must be at least ten feet, but this\r\nwas a delusion. After the men had vigorously plied their machetes on\r\nthe creepers, moss, and ferns, a stem not over two feet across was\r\nrevealed; they cleared away the lower tangle, leaving a protecting\r\numbrella-like canopy overhead that shielded the entire party from the\r\nrain while they cooked their food.\r\n\r\nWe crossed three ridges in all, the elevation of each being slightly in\r\nexcess of seven thousand feet, with depressions of from two thousand\r\nfeet to three thousand feet between them. All are heavily forested, the\r\ngrowth above four thousand feet being subtropical in character, while\r\nthat lower down is typical of the tropics and comparatively open.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the third day we heard the welcome roar of water, and\r\nnot long after halted on the bank of the Hávita River. A naked negro\r\ncame from the far side in answer to our calls, and ferried us across\r\nthe stream in a huge dugout canoe. There we found a settlement of half\r\na dozen bamboo huts filled with lazy negroes clothed in scanty attire.\r\nThe place is called El Puente. About one hundred yards below the group\r\nof hovels, the Hávita is joined by the Rio Ingara. The water of both\r\nstreams is swift, cool, and of a bluish-gray color. Each of the streams\r\nis about seventy-five yards wide just above the junction.\r\n\r\nAfter crossing another ridge which required two days’ time, we reached\r\nJuntas de Tamaná, on the south bank of the Hávita, a stone’s throw\r\nabove the point where this stream empties into the Tamaná, and but four\r\nhundred feet above sea-level. Excepting only the little clearing in\r\nwhich the fifteen dilapidated negro abodes stand, the entire country is\r\ncovered with a forest of tall trees; there is little undergrowth, but\r\nmany of the lower branches are covered with epiphytes, and long vines\r\nor “forest ropes” dangle down from the interlocking tree-tops to the\r\nvery ground.\r\n\r\nThe negroes of Juntas are a miserable, sickly lot. They suffer from\r\nlack of food, for the simple reason that they are too indolent to\r\ngrow in sufficient quantities the plantains, yuccas, and other plants\r\nthat thrive with a minimum of attention in such a favorable location.\r\nInstead of making clearings and cultivating the fertile ground, they\r\nprefer to lounge in their hammocks and take a chance at starving to\r\ndeath. At irregular intervals, when the pinch of want is too great\r\nto endure longer, the men paddle in canoes to their _fincas_ to cut\r\nsugar-cane, gather plantains, and to pick palm-nuts in the forest. Upon\r\ntheir return the family gathers about the food and eats until not a\r\nvestige remains. So effectively do they attack the mound of provisions\r\nthat one might easily imagine a swarm of locusts had paid the region a\r\nvisit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Native of Juntas de Tamaná with trail-haunting\r\nblacksnake.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The author with natives of Juntas de Tamaná.]\r\n\r\nA day or two after our arrival at Juntas a two-year-old child belonging\r\nto one of the families died. The news spread rapidly and by night\r\nthe entire neighborhood had turned out for a wake. We followed the\r\ncrowd. The baby, in a white dress, with bright red and green ribbon\r\ntrimming, lay in a wooden box on the table. A canopy of muslin had\r\nbeen erected above the bier which was strewn with wild flowers. The\r\nroom was packed to suffocation with the black forms of the populace,\r\nwhich glistened in the dim, flickering candle-light. At first bottles\r\nof _aguardiente_ were distributed, and every one had a number of\r\nliberal-sized drinks. Then the older folks withdrew against the four\r\nwalls and, squatting on the floor, sang or lamented as fancy dictated.\r\nThe younger people divided into two parties and played games around\r\nthe coffin. One of them was a kind of charade and, when the guessing\r\nside solved the riddle, they pursued and caught the others, amid loud\r\nshouts and laughter. I feared constantly that they might upset the\r\ncoffin. Occasionally some one would stop long enough to pet or caress\r\nthe dead little form, and address a few terms of endearment to it, such\r\nas _pobrecito_, _angelito_, or _tan lindito_. The revelry lasted until\r\ndaylight; then a procession slowly wound its way to a newly dug grave\r\nand deposited its burden, leaving the only little mound visible that\r\nside of the Tamaná.\r\n\r\nChristmas was drawing near. We were surprised to see the women\r\napparently making preparations for a celebration, which is most unusual\r\nin South America. They worked several days cutting the weeds around the\r\nvillage and cleaning up the place. When we asked about it, they said it\r\nwas not on account of the approaching _fiesta_, but a form of penance\r\nthey performed annually in atonement of their sins. Apparently the men\r\nwere without blemish, for they gazed upon the workers and addressed\r\njocular remarks to them from the comfortable retreat of their hammocks,\r\neven enumerating particular misdeeds and suggesting special forms of\r\npenance that might be effective.\r\n\r\nThe next stage of our journey had to be performed on the river. We\r\nsecured a huge _bongo_ and stalwart negro paddlers, and December 21\r\nfound us speeding down-stream toward Nóvita. The Tamaná is a rapid\r\nstream, varying between one hundred and three hundred yards in width.\r\nIts bed is strewn with boulders, causing rapids easily navigable on the\r\ndownward voyage, but difficult and dangerous to negotiate when bound\r\nup-stream. Then there are deep passages between high, crumbling banks,\r\nwhere the water glides silently onward like an olive-drab stream of\r\nmolten glass. The densest of tropical jungles lines both banks; its\r\nmatted walls facing the river are interrupted by small clearings at\r\ninfrequent intervals, where low hovels stand surrounded by the rich\r\nfoliage of banana and yucca plants. Chonta-palms, with bristling, spiny\r\nstems, rear their plumed heads above the other forest-trees, or droop\r\nover the water in a graceful manner, forming a dainty filigree against\r\nthe brazen sky. The brassy, merciless sun blazed down with unrelenting\r\nvigor, and we were glad when dark storm-clouds obscured the sky and\r\nprovided a greatly needed respite.\r\n\r\nIt was possible to proceed only to a point called Cabeceros, below\r\nwhich rapids of a formidable character obstruct further navigation. The\r\nfew negroes living on the river-bank can usually be induced to assist\r\nin making the portage, men and women alike undertaking to carry packs\r\nto Tambito at the foot of the rapids. Here it was necessary to secure\r\nanother _bongo_ and the trip was resumed.\r\n\r\nThe Tamaná grows wider constantly. Cataracts are of more frequent\r\noccurrence and present greater hazards in their navigation. The\r\n_bongo_, made of a huge tree-trunk and measuring thirty feet in length,\r\nand a yard in width, was most seaworthy; but frequently it shipped\r\nwater in alarming quantities, and scraped and bumped over the hidden\r\nrocks until we expected the craft to be rent asunder and flounder.\r\n\r\nDuring the greater part of the afternoon we were in sight of a high,\r\nisolated mountain, appearing on the map under the name Cerro Torra.\r\nSo far as I can learn no explorer has ever succeeded in gaining its\r\nsummit, and when I beheld the vast stretch of impenetrable jungle\r\nextending from the river to apparently the very top of the mountain, I\r\ncould readily understand why the few men who had attempted this piece\r\nof exploration had failed in their undertaking.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon we landed at Nóvita. I was somewhat surprised at\r\nthe size of the town, which consists of about fifty hovels. The white\r\npopulation, which was very small, consists mainly of traders, and is\r\nmore or less transient. I was told that they remain in the region a\r\nyear or two to buy gold and to sell their stock of provisions and\r\nmerchandise at exorbitant prices, and then return to a more healthful\r\nclimate--to suffer many years afterward from the effects of their\r\nsojourn in the Chocó.\r\n\r\nNóvita is essentially a mining town. A good deal of gold and platinum\r\nare washed out of the small streams that form a network in the\r\nsurrounding country. The negroes and Indians bring in the precious\r\nmetals in small quantities--wrapped in leaves--and trade them for\r\ntinned food and cloth. However, the town seemed to be on the decline\r\nin favor of Condoto, Pueblo Rico, and Quibdó, where richer mineral\r\ndeposits had been located.\r\n\r\nThe forest contained comparatively little wild life, and that was\r\ntypical of the Pacific tropical faunal zone. We daily took long tramps\r\nand discovered numerous things of more than passing interest. Among\r\nthem was a colony of nesting black-and-yellow orioles (_Icterus_).\r\nThe birds had selected a solitary ceiba-tree standing in the centre\r\nof a banana-field. It was seventy feet to the lowest limbs and the\r\ntrunk was so thick and smooth that no predatory animal could climb it,\r\nwhich insured the safety of the colony from such a source of danger.\r\nThe nests, like huge pears, dangled from the tips of the branches; I\r\ncounted one hundred and four, and there must have been many others\r\nconcealed by the foliage. The adult birds were busy and excited,\r\nand were coming and going in steady streams, keeping up their noisy\r\nchattering all the while. We found numerous bits of egg-shells, white\r\nwith black dots, on the ground, indicating that the young were just\r\nhatching.\r\n\r\nOne evening as we were returning from a long hunt, we noticed lines\r\nof bats emerging from the little church standing on the edge of the\r\nvillage. Next day (Christmas) I visited this rendezvous accompanied\r\nby several negro assistants. The bats were all concealed within the\r\nboard walls, so that it was impossible to get at them, but the negroes\r\nunhesitatingly tore away the slabs of flattened bamboo and soon had\r\nthe room filled with a squeaking, fluttering swarm which they attacked\r\nwith sticks. This method of attack proving too slow, they grabbed\r\nguns and fired into the masses amid wild shouts of merriment. When\r\nthe pandemonium was over and the heap of slain had been collected,\r\nthey respectfully removed their hats and in passing out of the church\r\nreverently bowed the knee before the altar.\r\n\r\nWe had been cautioned to be on the alert for snakes. The deadly\r\nbushmaster or _verrugosa_ was said to be particularly abundant. While\r\nhunting one day, Allen shot a hawk and placed it in the back pocket of\r\nhis hunting-coat. To all appearances the bird was dead; while crawling\r\nthrough a thicket a short time later he felt a sudden sharp sting in\r\nhis back and, throwing up his hands in terror, yelled, “Oh, Lord! one\r\ngot me at last,” thinking, of course, that he had been struck by a\r\nsnake. Hurriedly removing his coat, the discovery was made that the\r\nsupposedly dead hawk had been stunned only and, reviving, had promptly\r\ndug its talons in the first thing that offered a firm hold. One may\r\nwell imagine the unpleasantness of such an experience.\r\n\r\nOccasionally we saw a species of blacksnake that grows to a length\r\nof more than twelve feet. It is perfectly harmless, but has the\r\ndisagreeable habit of haunting trails and footpaths near the villages.\r\nWhen a pedestrian approaches it rears its head several feet above\r\nthe ground and calmly gazes into his face. The first few times this\r\nhappens, the sudden, upward lunge of the big head, the rapidly playing\r\ntongue and the beady eyes give one a decided shock and provide ample\r\ncause for flight. Later, one becomes more or less accustomed to it.\r\nThis snake was also plentiful in tropical Venezuela and Bolivia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nóvita, the largest town in the Chocó.]\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to secure fresh meat at Nóvita; salt beef was\r\nimported in barrels, but it was of such poor quality that we could\r\nnot eat it. We therefore depended on toucans and parrots for our\r\nmeat-supply, and found both species very palatable.\r\n\r\nThe paper money used throughout the greater part of Colombia is not\r\nrecognized by inhabitants of the Chocó. It rots in the wet, hot\r\natmosphere and for that reason is valueless. Neither are gold coins\r\nwanted, but some of the shopkeepers accepted them at a twelve per\r\ncent discount. The money that finds favor is composed of silver coins\r\nfrom Mexico and practically all the other South and Central American\r\nrepublics; it is valued according to size, the “dollars” passing for\r\nforty cents, the halves for twenty, and so on. I found a number of\r\nUnited States half-dimes circulating at two cent, and dimes at four\r\ncent values, and “collected” all that came within reach.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days’ hunting around Nóvita we secured another _bongo_ and\r\nresumed our journey down-stream. The Tamaná empties into the San Juan,\r\nabout ten miles below Nóvita. The latter river is wider and deeper, but\r\nthere is no change in the country bordering it. All day long we glided\r\nsteadily onward, stopping at noon only for a brief respite from the\r\nburning sun. At dusk we landed to spend the night near a negro hut. The\r\nfloor was raised five feet from the ground and the ragged, thatched\r\nroof nearly touched it; there were no walls. Altogether it was a most\r\nprimitive dwelling, in which the dusky forms of the occupants moved\r\nlike shadows against the dim light of their cooking fire. Noanamá was\r\nreached the next day. It is not quite so large as Juntas de Tamaná,\r\nand stands on a bluff overlooking the river. The inhabitants are all\r\nnegroes; the males wore breech-cloths only, while the costume of the\r\nwomen consisted of a narrow cloth fastened around the waist with a\r\nstring. Both men and women spend a few hours each day washing gold on\r\nthe river-bank, securing enough from this work to pay for provisions\r\nbrought from Buenaventura. When they have accumulated a small quantity\r\nof the fine, sparkling flakes they embark in their canoes and make\r\ntheir way to the seaport in three days, there to do their trading. It\r\nwas impossible to hire them for any kind of work; one woman had flour,\r\nbut could not bake bread for lack of fire-wood, because no one would\r\ncarry it from the forest one hundred yards away. Indians came to the\r\nvillage daily. They wore many ornaments of beaten silver about their\r\nnecks and wrists; some of them also had earrings made of the same\r\nmetal, the size of doorknobs; they were so heavy that a framework of\r\nsticks placed at the back of the head had to be used to support their\r\nweight. I was greatly amused by the actions of one stalwart young brave\r\nwho, with his wife and baby, came to the settlement each day. While\r\nin town, where he might be observed, he paid no attention whatever to\r\nhis family; he walked several paces in front of the woman, who, of\r\ncourse, carried the baby, and not once even condescended to glance in\r\ntheir direction. However, when they reached the river-bank or some\r\nother secluded spot where he was safe from prying eyes, he snatched the\r\ninfant from the mother’s arms, kissed it, tossed it into the air and\r\nacted exactly like any other fond parent. If any one approached, he\r\nhastily returned it to his wife and resumed his taciturn expression.\r\n\r\nAt times a small steamer, the _Fluvial_, from Buenaventura, visits the\r\nsettlements on the lower San Juan. We waited in vain ten days for her\r\nappearance. However, a launch belonging to a miner, a Mr. Stapleton,\r\nchanced to pass, and the owner kindly offered to take us to the coast.\r\n\r\nThe San Juan grows constantly wider. Its banks are dotted with the\r\nconical huts of Indians; the floors are always raised on poles, high\r\nabove the ground, to escape the floods and insects.\r\n\r\nAs we sped down the river many of the naked, painted savages rushed\r\nout in their canoes, paddling and yelling like demons in attempts to\r\novertake the launch. I do not know what object they had in mind as we\r\nalways outdistanced them. We also saw others catching crabs in places\r\nwhere the high, sheer banks were honeycombed with holes made by these\r\ncrustaceans. They had slender, sharpened sticks with a barb on the\r\nend, which they inserted in the burrows and then withdrew with the\r\nstruggling victims impaled on them.\r\n\r\nWe reached the mouth of the San Juan in two days’ time. The river\r\nis very wide at this point and dotted with low mangrove islands.\r\nA sand-bar almost completely blocks the estuary, and when we left\r\nthe next morning we had great difficulty in finding a passage. Then\r\nfollowed a wild, careening dash of forty miles in the open ocean. The\r\nlaunch was but twenty-one feet long, and we were compelled to go out of\r\nsight of land to avoid rocks and reefs; but dusk found us well within\r\nthe confines of Buenaventura Bay, ploughing through the placid water\r\nat great speed and frightening up innumerable flocks of brown pelicans\r\nthat much preferred to float comfortably on the unruffled surface, and\r\ntook wing only as a last resort to escape being run down.\r\n\r\nBuenaventura had never seemed attractive or inviting to us before, but\r\nafter a month in the steaming coastal land, with its almost constant\r\ndownpour, insect pests, and terrific heat, it appeared to be altogether\r\ndelightful. We returned to Cali and spent weeks on our backs suffering\r\nfrom the fevers with which we had become inoculated. Allen’s attack was\r\nso severe that he was compelled to return to the United States two days\r\nafter reaching San Agustin on our next expedition, and just before the\r\ndiscovery of some of our most valuable material.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nIN QUEST OF THE COCK-OF-THE-ROCK\r\n\r\n\r\nOn my fourth visit to Popayán we had to remain in the city the greater\r\npart of a week, arranging for the continuation of our journey across\r\nthe Central Andes to the headwaters of the Magdalena. Hereafter we\r\nwere to travel on foot, partly due to the fact that some of the trails\r\nwere impassable, both to riding and pack animals, and partly to enable\r\nus to be in a position better to study the wild life of the region we\r\ntraversed. I was accompanied on this particular expedition by Doctor\r\nAllen and Mr. J. T. Lloyd, of Cornell University.\r\n\r\nOn February 27 we left Popayán on foot, the mule-train following some\r\nlittle distance behind. The route lay through undulating country,\r\nrather well cultivated, where there were numerous huts at which we\r\nfound shelter for the nights. At one of these stopping-places the\r\nnatives were engaged in thrashing beans. The pods had been heaped upon\r\na straw mat and the family were beating them with heavy flails. Wheat\r\nwas thrashed in the same manner, but after the grains had been beaten\r\nloose from the chaff large pans full were held high above the head and\r\npoured out in a thin, steady stream; the wind blew the chaff from the\r\nfalling column and the wheat dropped upon the mat. At another hut men\r\nwere manufacturing “cabulla” by stripping off, between two sticks,\r\nthe fleshy part of the leaves of the yucca-plant. The tough fibres\r\nremaining were mixed with horsehair and braided into strong ropes. Food\r\nwas scarce, the natives subsisting upon the inevitable “sancocho” of\r\nboiled green plantains, and cornmeal “jarepas.” However, we managed\r\noccasionally to pick up a fowl, some green corn, and once, we succeeded\r\nin purchasing a live sheep; this, in addition to the provisions we\r\ncarried, enabled us to fare passably well.\r\n\r\nOn March 7 we had reached the top of a ridge ten thousand three hundred\r\nand fifty feet high, having passed the little villages Timbio, San\r\nMiguel, Santa Barbara, and La Vega. La Vega means “fertile plain,” and\r\nthe surrounding country fully justifies the name. Far as the eye could\r\nsee the gently sloping mountainsides had been divided into a network\r\nof small, irregular plots by rows of high, thick hedges. Wheat, corn,\r\ncabbage, and rice flourished under the cultivating hand of the Indian;\r\nthere were also small flocks of sheep, and occasionally a few head\r\nof cattle. Small mud-walled huts, singly and in clusters, dotted the\r\nmaze of green landscape, and over all breathed an air of quiet and\r\ncontentment.\r\n\r\nThe trail had gradually led upward, though often descending into\r\ngorges and ravines a thousand feet deep. We had passed through patches\r\nof barren country, and then entered a wilderness of lovely flowering\r\nrhododendrons. The masses of red wild oleanders were beautiful, but the\r\nlanes of a species of shrub covered with small waxen blossoms of purest\r\nwhite, mingled with deep-green foliage and the fronds of monstrous\r\nsubtropical ferns, surpassed any picture that pen can describe or the\r\nimagination conjure. From afar we could hear the steady buzz of bees\r\nand other insects that swarmed about the flowers, and frequently a\r\nhumming-bird whirred into the arena, hovered a few moments, and then\r\nsped away; myriads of nocturnal insects appeared at night, and great\r\nsphinx-moths took the place of the hummers.\r\n\r\nThe top of the ridge is covered with tall, magnificent forest. We saw\r\nnumerous signs of bird and animal life. Toucans of several species\r\nyelped and clattered their bills in the tall trees above. There were\r\nalso yellow-shouldered troupials, blue and yellow cotingas, brown\r\ncreepers, bright-colored hummers, and many dragon-flies. The latter\r\npossessed a special interest for Lloyd, who immediately erected\r\nbreeding-cages and began to study their life history. The larva of the\r\ndragon-fly resembles a good-size black beetle and lives in water. It is\r\nthe possessor of a voracious appetite, feeding upon aquatic insects,\r\nthe larvæ of mosquitoes, and even upon members of its own kind. Finally\r\nit rises to the top, hatches, and continues the cycle of its existence\r\nas an aerialist, the terror of the winged insects upon which it preys.\r\nPenelopes, small turkey-like birds, were abundant, and proved to be\r\nexcellent eating. One day we succeeded in taking two specimens of a\r\nrare, beautiful tanager (_Serricossypha albocristata_) that lived in\r\nsmall flocks in the tall tree-tops. It was as large as a robin, of\r\na velvety blue-black color, with a white crown and breast of deep\r\nscarlet. With such a display of lovely colors one might expect harmony\r\nin song; but apparently the vocal ability of the gorgeous creature was\r\nlimited to a few shrill “peeps” like those of a strayed pullet. Deer\r\nalso were abundant, and one day we caught a fine cat of the ocelot\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nWe pitched camp in the heart of the forest. The vegetation was really\r\nwonderful. In spots the lower growth consisted entirely of climbing\r\nbamboo, so dense as to be impenetrable; the moss carpeting the ground\r\nwas often knee-deep, and the trees seemed to be breaking under the\r\nweight of the creepers, orchids, mosses, and lilies that burdened every\r\ntrunk and branch. It rained a good deal, and when the downpour stopped\r\nthere was always the drip, drip of water that had been absorbed by the\r\nspongy masses overhead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Threshing wheat.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Indian hut in the Valle de las Papas.]\r\n\r\nThe forest zone extends along the top of the ridge for three or four\r\nmiles and down about one thousand five hundred feet on the other side,\r\nbut the slope immediately below this line is either bush-covered or\r\ncultivated, and bears every evidence of having been cleared. Fifteen\r\nhundred feet lower down we came upon the little settlement Almaguer,\r\nwhich boasts about one hundred adobe houses and two severely plain\r\nlittle churches, but all are whitewashed and present a clean\r\nappearance. The main industry is the making of Panama hats of a rather\r\ncoarse kind. Many Indians visit the town on market-days, bringing coca\r\nleaves, lime, and _sera_, a kind of vegetable wax, obtained from a\r\nberry that grows in the mountains and used for making candles. Pigeons\r\nare very fond of the berry, and as they ripen the great band-tailed\r\nspecies congregate in flocks to feed upon them, becoming so fat that\r\nthey finally pay with their lives for the short season of feasting.\r\nThe candles made of _sera_ are green, but burn well and are generally\r\nbetter than the ordinary tallow dip. The lime, or “mambe,” is used for\r\nchewing with the coca leaves, which is a confirmed habit in this part\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nAs elsewhere, the weekly market at Almaguer is a day of great activity\r\nand is looked upon almost in the light of a fiesta. Early in the\r\nmorning, usually at four o’clock, a cow is killed in the plaza and all\r\nthe inhabitants gather around to watch the skinning of the carcass.\r\n\r\nAt eight o’clock the plaza is filled with tradespeople, usually\r\nwomen, squatting on the ground with their wares spread before them\r\nin wooden trays, bags, or baskets. All that these simple people deem\r\nnecessary to existence, and even some luxuries, may be had. There are\r\nrows of venders of bread, cakes, and dulces; others with vegetables,\r\nrice, coffee, corn, and cheese; occasionally peaches, apples of an\r\ninferior quality, oranges, and a few plantains are brought up from some\r\nsheltered valley; but the greatest space is always taken up by the coca\r\nmerchants, who unquestionably do the most thriving business, as every\r\none takes advantage of market-day to have their “mambero” replenished.\r\nSometimes a buyer of hats visits the market. On such occasions the day\r\nis ushered in with an unearthly hammering noise that proceeds from all\r\nthe houses, and investigation will disclose the women industriously\r\npounding the Panamas into shape on a wooden block. Later they carry\r\nthem to market on their heads, where the buyer, after a casual\r\nexamination, makes an offer which varies from forty cents to a few\r\ndollars, according to the texture of the hat.\r\n\r\nAt night the temperature falls rapidly as the cold winds sweep down\r\nfrom the mountains and howl through the streets. We have every reason\r\nto remember our night’s experience in Almaguer. The pack-animals had\r\nfailed to catch up and we carried nothing with us, so we spent the\r\nlong, cheerless hours until sunrise shivering in our bare, dusty room\r\nin the _posada_.\r\n\r\nThe first night from Almaguer was passed at an old mill on the banks\r\nof the Caquiona, built by monks many years ago. They had thoughtfully\r\nprovided a large room to house the Indians who formerly came to have\r\ntheir wheat and corn ground, even to the extent of providing rough\r\nbunks; and just outside stood a massive stocks, doubtless also provided\r\nfor the use of the Indians, but it must have detracted somewhat from\r\nthe effect of the hospitality extended by the good monks. There\r\nwas plenty of tender, luscious grass for the mules. Near the river\r\nlarge numbers of butterflies settled on the moist sand to drink; the\r\nboulders on the bottom of the clear, cold stream had many houses of the\r\ncaddis-fly cemented to them--little pebbly mummy-cases in which the\r\nowner lay snugly ensconced in the silky lining and quickly repaired the\r\nbreak if we opened them. The next day we passed San Sebastian, the last\r\nsettlement, and climbed steadily higher toward the cold, bleak paramo\r\nthat marks the dividing-line between the Cauca and the Magdalena.\r\n\r\nAfter four days we reached the marvellous Valle de las Papas, just\r\nbelow the mist-enshrouded paramo, and took refuge in the pretentious\r\nhouse of old Pedro, a full-blooded Andaquia, while preparing for our\r\nfinal dash across the great barrier.\r\n\r\nThe Valle de las Papas is a great level stretch of marshy land covered\r\nwith a growth of tall grass and small clumps of forest, between ten\r\nthousand and eleven thousand feet up. The tops of the ridges hem it in\r\non all sides and somewhat protect it from the icy winds. It is said\r\nthat the ancient Indians cultivated the potato in this valley; hence\r\nits name--“The Valley of Potatoes.” An elaborate network of canals or\r\ndrains runs through the valley, but the climate and soil are such that\r\nI doubt if cultivation could be carried on to any great extent. Often,\r\nfor many days at a time, rain and hail fall steadily and the mist is\r\nso thick that one cannot venture far on the treacherous boggy soil.\r\nYet, strange to say, cattle thrive wonderfully on the high plateau, and\r\ntheir rearing is the occupation followed by the few Indian families\r\nwho live on these heights. Beautiful orchids abound in the trees,\r\nespecially in the forest that reaches up to the valley; we saw many of\r\nyellow, purple, and snowy-white. Some of the trees are of the evergreen\r\nfamily, including a kind of holly. There were many indications of\r\ndeer and tapirs, although we shot none. Large snipe and ant-thrushes\r\nwere plentiful, and on the streams we saw a number of peculiar little\r\ntorrent-ducks, or merganettas; large white gulls, which the Indians say\r\nare old birds that come up from the sea to die, soared high overhead.\r\n\r\nAt one end of the valley lies a small lake, of which we had an\r\noccasional short view when the clouds drifted up the slopes. All about\r\ngrew clumps of frailejones. Two streams leave the grassy borders of the\r\nlake, mere rivulets ten or twelve feet wide, through which we waded\r\ndaily; one flows down the extreme eastern slope and develops into the\r\nmighty Caquetá that helps to swell the yellow flood of the Amazon; the\r\nother breaks through the ridges to the northeast, and dashing down the\r\nmountains in a series of rapids and cascades forms the Magdalena, which\r\nempties into the Caribbean many hundreds of miles away.\r\n\r\nAllen was suffering considerably from the fever contracted in the\r\nChocó four months before. Instead of being benefited by the high, cold\r\nclimate as we had hoped, his condition grew steadily worse, so we found\r\nit necessary to continue our journey sooner than we had anticipated.\r\nI hastened back to San Sebastian to engage Indian porters, as mules\r\nare unable to carry packs beyond this point, and was assisted in\r\nmy mission by the schoolmaster, who took a sympathetic interest in\r\nour undertaking. He was a pathetic example of a man who might have\r\naccomplished great deeds had the opportunity presented itself. One of\r\nhis most highly cherished possessions was an old magazine containing\r\nillustrations of an aeroplane and an article on wireless telegraphy.\r\n\r\nWith a great deal of difficulty I succeeded in arranging with a dozen\r\nIndians to carry our luggage across the cordillera the following week.\r\nThey were of splendid physique and as fine a looking lot as I had ever\r\nseen. The price agreed upon was about seventy-five cents per _arroba_\r\nof twenty-five pounds, each man carrying from two to four _arrobas_.\r\nThe journey would require five days, and each man was to carry his\r\nown food for the trip in addition to the pack. The charge was high,\r\njudged by local standards, but on account of the rainy season the\r\ntrail was all but impassable; also, it was the _Semana Santa_, one\r\nof the greatest fiestas of the year, when all good Indians should\r\nroam the streets, dulling their senses with an excessive use of coca\r\nleaves and _guarapo_, and fighting, while the women spent the greater\r\npart of the days in church acquiring grace for themselves and their\r\ndelinquent husbands. A small advance was made to each man to enable him\r\nto purchase a supply of ground corn, cane-sugar, and coca. Acceptance\r\nof this advance is considered equal to signing a contract, and they\r\nrarely, if ever, go back on the deal.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, April 3, the day set for our departure, the men appeared,\r\neach provided with a board and strong cords. The packs, consisting of\r\nboxes, steamer trunks, and bags, were tied to the boards which fitted\r\nthe men’s backs; a broad band was passed over the forehead and two\r\nbands across the chest. Each man carried in his hand a forked stick,\r\nor “mula,” as a means of aiding him in going up and down the slippery\r\ninclines and in walking the logs that crossed the streams.\r\n\r\nAfter a short, steep climb we were out on the bleak paramo, in the\r\nmidst of the rain, hail, and mist. The wind blew a gale and the\r\ncold was intense. Through an occasional break in the banks of fog\r\nwe had glimpses of the valley on each side filled with dense clumps\r\nof frailejones. We continued on in the face of the blinding storm\r\nfor several hours, but with the coming of darkness the trail left\r\nthe wind-swept zone and started downward, winding along the canyon\r\nof the Magdalena; in the failing light the scenery was bewitchingly\r\nbeautiful. High, rugged peaks, sheer cliffs, and black masses of\r\nforest towered above the sparkling stream that bounded from rock to\r\nrock in a succession of falls. Allen and Lloyd had gone on ahead, and\r\nafter dark I came upon them camped in a unique spot. They had thrown\r\ntheir blankets on a ledge in the face of a cliff that towered several\r\nhundred feet above them. A tiny waterfall dashed over the edge of the\r\nprecipice, cleared the ledge, and joined the greater torrent below.\r\nThe regular night’s stopping-place is known as Santa Marta, which the\r\nIndians reached at nine that night.\r\n\r\nImmediately after arriving at the camping site the porters boiled\r\ncorn-meal, which they ate with brown sugar. Each man had brought a\r\nsheepskin to use as a bed, and these were dried beside the fire while\r\ntheir food was cooking. Before starting in the morning they had another\r\nmeal of mush and sugar. During the gruelling day their mouths were kept\r\nwell filled with coca and lime, and the apparent amount of sustenance\r\nand endurance derived from the herb is extraordinary; nor does it seem\r\nto have any bad aftereffect, though in Almaguer I saw a number of shaky\r\nold women with bloodshot eyes and blackened lips and teeth, said to be\r\ndue to the result of excessive indulgence in coca.\r\n\r\nThe second night we failed to catch up with the men who had gone on\r\nahead. We had waded streams and knee-deep mud the greater part of the\r\nday as the result of the steady downpour which rendered the trail\r\nindescribably bad; everything was drenched and it required more than\r\nan hour of hard work to start a small fire. However, the day dawned\r\nbright and sunny, and we lingered to watch the tribes of feathered folk\r\nthat began feeding and chattering in the tree-tops. The ripening fruits\r\nhad attracted great black guans, trogons with rose-colored breasts and\r\nmetallic green backs, and wonderful curve-billed hummers with long\r\nwhite tails. Along a stretch of bamboo we saw scores of large, pearly\r\nbutterflies flapping about lazily, the iridescence of their wings\r\nflashing like bits of rainbow in the sunlight; but not a glimpse did we\r\nhave of the main object of our long wanderings--the rare and elusive\r\ncock-of-the-rock.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the rain again fell in unrelenting torrents, and we\r\ncamped beneath a wall of rock hundreds of feet high, which the Indians\r\ncalled the Peña Seca, or dry stone. Great vines with bunches of scarlet\r\nflowers drooped a hundred feet below the top, like gigantic serpents,\r\nbut not a drop of all the downpour reached us. The base of the cliff\r\nwas blackened from the numerous camp-fires kindled by Indians on their\r\nway to Tolima in quest of salt. By way of divertisement our Indians\r\ngathered incense, which is a kind of gum that collects on certain\r\ntrees, and which they intended to take home with them for use in the\r\n_santa iglesia_. I watched the social bees that live in company with\r\ntermites building tubular entrances that may extend out eighteen\r\ninches or more like a coiled pipe-stem to their apartment in the nest;\r\napparently the two different inmates of the common domicile never clash.\r\n\r\nThe third night we reached the hut of an old Indian who called himself\r\nDomingo, and who was as surly a creature as ever walked the earth. As\r\nhe refused us the hospitality of his hut, we camped outside his gate.\r\n\r\nWe now occasionally passed through a cleared spot where grain and\r\nvegetables grew; cattle grazed on the long, tender grass, and\r\ndark-brown, wild-eyed children peered at us from under the fringed,\r\nlow grass roofs of shambling Indian huts. On the top of every knoll\r\nwas a row of tall wooden crosses, some newly erected, others decaying\r\nand ready to topple over; it is the custom of the natives to erect a\r\nnew one each year on Good Friday, permitting the old ones to remain\r\nstanding. We had reached the frontier of Huila.\r\n\r\nOn Easter Sunday we had our first glimpse of San Agustin, which was\r\ndecidedly disappointing. All that we could see as we descended the last\r\nsteep slope was a cluster of some fifty-odd mud huts protruding from\r\nthe centre of a wide, barren plain; there is no forest within a mile\r\nin any direction, and very little cultivation is carried on in the\r\nimmediate vicinity. The town is very old; the inhabitants are mainly\r\nof Spanish descent, but scattered throughout the surrounding country\r\ncan be found small clearings, or _fincas_, cultivated by full-blooded\r\nIndians. These latter are of a reticent though friendly disposition,\r\nemerging from the seclusion of their forest-bound homes only on\r\nmarket-days to dispose of the products of the soil and of their flocks.\r\n\r\nIn recent years the name San Agustin has come into prominence on\r\naccount of the prehistoric ruins and monoliths that are found in its\r\nvicinity, and which are supposed to be of very great antiquity, dating\r\nback to a culture that has entirely disappeared and of which nothing\r\ndefinite is known. Even the Indians who to-day inhabit the region have\r\nno traditions or folk-lore of the vanished race, and scientists who\r\nhave examined the ruins have, up to the present time, been unable to\r\naccount for their origin. It has been suggested that they may represent\r\nthe work of the tribe of Andaquias, but this statement is disputed by\r\nCarlos Cuervo Marquez, who points out that the mute reminders of an\r\nancient civilization already existed in the same unknown condition at\r\nthe time the Conquistadores overran the empire of the Chibchas.\r\n\r\nThe thing that first attracted our attention was the row of twelve\r\nstone images that stand in the centre of the plaza facing the village\r\nchapel, which vary in height from two to eight feet and are carved from\r\nsandstone and granite. Gigantic heads, with round faces and staring,\r\nexpressionless eyes, are set upon short, square bodies. Some are\r\ncrowned with hats or head-coverings that range in pattern from the\r\nTurkish fez and sugar-loaf to curious curved caps that may have been\r\nintended to simulate the rainbow. Many of the figures are quite naked,\r\nwhile others are clothed in a narrow band, or loin-cloth. The teeth\r\nof many of the human beings represented are prominent, and each has\r\ntwo pair of great pointed canines like those of a beast. This row of\r\nimages was placed in its present location by order of the priest who\r\nhad charge of the parish; we may imagine at what cost of labor when we\r\nrealize that many of the stones weigh several tons. Of course, there\r\nare no trails, and the only way was to drag them out of the forest with\r\nropes.\r\n\r\nOne of the monoliths represents a woman with a small child in one arm\r\nand a club in the other hand raised in an attitude of defense; on one\r\nis carved a woman meshing a _muchila_, and on another a man is holding\r\na fish. There is the hewn figure of a large monkey crouching over a\r\nsmaller one, and some distance away stands an owl holding a snake in\r\nits beak. A flat slab in a recumbent position bears the engraved figure\r\nof a woman and possibly served as the covering of a coffin or a grave.\r\nThen there is the statue of a woman with a mallet in one hand and a\r\nchisel in the other, thought to represent the goddess of sculpture. It\r\nseems not improbable that the greater number of the images represent\r\nidols which were worshipped by the ancient people.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The village of Santa Barbara.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A corner of San Augustin.]\r\n\r\nThe most interesting examples are to be found in the forest above San\r\nAgustin. Under the giant cedars and tall cecropias that cover the\r\nslopes one finds works of a more pretentious nature, scattered among\r\nthe dense low palm growths and covered with creepers and epiphytes.\r\nThere a huge stone tablet may be seen, supported on four richly\r\ncarved stone columns six feet high, which probably served as an altar\r\nfor the offer of sacrifice; or it may have been the entrance to a\r\ntemple. Near-by is an underground gallery leading to two large caves\r\nin which are carvings of the sun and moon with rays darting in all\r\ndirections. There are many other statues within a radius of several\r\nmiles, and doubtless a systematic search of the region would reveal\r\nrich archæological treasure-troves. Numerous mounds and caverns furnish\r\nabundant evidence of the existence of ruined temples and the remnants\r\nof works of art that have yielded to decadence with the passing of\r\nthe centuries. Most of the known statues have been undermined by\r\nfortune-hunters and have toppled over; others have been broken by the\r\nexcavators in their mad search for the small gold replicas or ornaments\r\nthat are found in the graves, while several have been demolished by\r\norder of the clergy. The only thing that prevents the removal of the\r\nstones themselves is their great weight and lack of transportation\r\nfacilities.\r\n\r\nThe ruins about San Agustin possess none of the ornate massiveness of\r\nthose found in Guatemala and Yucatan, but rather has the work been\r\nexecuted along severe lines and in bas-relief; nor are they nearly so\r\nwell preserved, which might tend to show that they date back to an\r\nearlier period. Hieroglyphics are almost wholly wanting. Doctor Karl\r\nTheodor Stoepel, who spent some time in San Agustin previous to our\r\nvisit, has traced a similarity between one of the monoliths and an\r\nexample found in Pachacama, Bolivia. In one or two instances the work\r\nresembles that of the Aztecs.\r\n\r\nJust how to account for the advance of civilization to a point\r\nwhere art and architecture were encouraged, and which supported a\r\nwell-organized form of government, and then to explain its complete\r\nextinction, is a question on which students of the subject are\r\nat variance. Religion in some form or other has always wielded a\r\npowerful influence upon the life and customs of primitive nations; one\r\nevidence--almost invariably the deities and the temples erected for\r\ntheir veneration represent the supreme efforts of the ancient artists\r\nand alone have withstood the weathering of ages. This points strongly\r\nto the supremacy of a sacerdotal order; but whether the reigning\r\nclasses who withheld their knowledge from the common people for selfish\r\npurposes were annihilated by an uprising of the servile hordes or\r\nby an outside invasion, or whether some great cataclysm of nature\r\nextinguished the progress of ages at a stroke, may forever remain a\r\nsecret.\r\n\r\nThe bird life around San Agustin was varied and abundant. Trees were in\r\nblossom, especially one with a feathery, pinkish flower (_Mimosa_), and\r\nto this scores of hummers came. One species had a slightly curved bill\r\nand was green in color, with a patch of deepest purple on the throat;\r\nanother of a blue color had tail-feathers six inches long. In the\r\nravines there were many chachalacas that kept up a demoniacal cackling.\r\nThe bushes were full of finches and lovely velvety red tanagers,\r\nwhile honey-creepers came to our table daily and gorged themselves on\r\nsugar. In the forest we saw many large, woolly monkeys, some bluish,\r\nothers silvery gray. There were kinkajous, agoutis, and peccaries.\r\nThe two-toed sloth was abundant; the flesh of all these animals was\r\ngreedily eaten by the natives. Numbers of large lizards or iguanas\r\nprowled about the town and feasted on the tiny chickens and ducklings.\r\nA flight of locusts covered the entire upper Magdalena, and for days\r\nthe air was black with the pest; millions would rise from the ground in\r\na steady cloud in front of us as we walked along through the fields. In\r\na few days not a speck of green remained. The hungry, insatiable hordes\r\nmoved on, but behind them remained a wide, brown desert, filled with\r\nsorrow and desolation, for the crops of corn, yuccas, and bananas had\r\nbeen destroyed and there would be famine for many months to come.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A mountain stream, such as the Rio Naranjos, where the\r\ncock-of-the-rock spends its existence.]\r\n\r\nWe scouted the forests daily, confining our search to the untrodden\r\nravines of the Rio Naranjos, a turbulent, wicked stream that joins the\r\nMagdalena a short distance below. Great precipices flank its sides and\r\nthe water rushes through dark, narrow gorges. Everywhere the river-bed\r\nis dotted with great boulders against which the water dashes with\r\na force that sends clouds of spray into the air. The slopes of the\r\nmountains and ravines are covered with a dense palm jungle, the trees\r\nladen with bunches of purple berries. It is in places such as these\r\nthat the cock-of-the-rock spends its existence. After several weeks of\r\nthe most strenuous work our efforts were rewarded: we came suddenly\r\nupon a flock of male birds in the top of a palm, the bright scarlet\r\ncolor of the wonderful creatures flaming among the deep-green fronds\r\nin a dazzling manner as they flitted about, and with outstretched\r\nnecks and raucous “_eur-rr-ks_” surveyed the disturbers of their\r\ntime-honored solitude. We were the first human beings to penetrate\r\ntheir jungle fastness and excited curiosity rather than fear. The mere\r\nsight of these beautiful birds in their wild surroundings was worth\r\nall the discomforts of the long journey. In size they are no larger\r\nthan domestic pigeons, but the color is of a most intense and brilliant\r\nscarlet, with wings and tail of black; the upper wing-coverts are of a\r\nlight shade of gray, and the eyes and feet are golden yellow; a flat\r\ncrest an inch and a half high completely covers the head and hides the\r\nyellow bill. The female is of a dull shade of brown.\r\n\r\nWe wanted to find their nests and to study their home life, of which\r\nlittle was known; also to secure material for the museum group. With\r\nthe aid of Indians, and ropes made of creepers, we began to explore the\r\nface of the cliffs, some of which were a hundred feet high. On many\r\nof the steep slopes the palms grew so close together that we utilized\r\nthem as ladders. As it rained nearly every day the footholds were very\r\nslippery, and many times one or another of the party fell, being saved\r\nfrom being dashed on the rocks far below only by the rope that bound us\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nOne day, as we crept along slowly and painfully, we flushed a bird of\r\nsombre brown from a great boulder that rose from the centre of the\r\nstream. We waited breathlessly while she fluttered about in the palms\r\nand then returned to the rock. She flew many times back and forth,\r\ncarrying food in her bill, and at last I discerned a dark object\r\nagainst the face of the rock upon which the bird centred her attention.\r\nThere was no longer cause for concealment, so we moved to the edge of\r\nthe torrent and saw the grass and mud nest plastered against the face\r\nof the rock; below raged a whirlpool, and on each side there was a\r\nwaterfall. A more inaccessible spot could not have been chosen by the\r\nbird, whose haunts had never been violated.\r\n\r\nAfter a consultation the Indians decided to build a raft, and\r\naccordingly cut down trees and lashed the trunks together, but no\r\nsooner had the craft been launched than it was caught by the raging\r\nswirl and spun about until the creepers parted and we found ourselves\r\nstruggling in the whirlpool. A great liana which had been securely tied\r\nto the raft and fastened on the bank swept past, and this proved to be\r\nour salvation.\r\n\r\nA tall tree was now felled, and its course so directed that the top\r\nshould fall across the inaccessible rock island, but it fell several\r\nyards short and again we were outwitted.\r\n\r\nThe sun was now directly overhead, and the fierce rays entered the\r\nnarrow confines of the canyon so that it was stiflingly hot. Angry\r\npeals of thunder warned us of the approaching storm, and red howling\r\nmonkeys, disturbed from their midday rest, roared dismally. Above, the\r\nriver flowed like a greenish stream of molten glass; below, it dashed\r\nthrough the gorge with a dull roar, and to the towering boulder in\r\nthe centre clung a treasure, to possess which men had risked their\r\nlives; but on the very verge of success we seemed likely to fail. Even\r\nthe Indians, pioneers of the jungle, shook their heads doubtfully and\r\nwanted to return.\r\n\r\nWe tried the only remaining resource. With poles and lines two of the\r\nIndians and myself picked our way to a number of small rocks that\r\njutted out of the angry flood at the very mouth of the gorge. The other\r\nIndian spliced together joints of slender bamboo and climbed out into\r\nthe branch of the fallen tree which had lodged against some rocks. From\r\nthis precarious position he made repeated thrusts at the nest; finally\r\nit fell and began its maddening career in the whirlpool. Around it\r\nwent, many times, and then shot straight for the gorge, swerving toward\r\nthe rock on which Juan stood. As we shouted encouragement Juan dived.\r\nIn spite of the fact that he was a powerful swimmer we doubted if we\r\nshould ever see him again, but after what seemed minutes he reappeared,\r\nbattling furiously with the flood that sought to sweep him into the\r\nmaelstrom. We threw him a line and dragged him ashore. In his mouth he\r\nheld the precious nest, a young bird, drowned, still clinging to the\r\ngrass lining.\r\n\r\nLater, and under circumstances hardly less thrilling, we found other\r\nbirds and nests with both eggs and young, but we took only those that\r\nwere absolutely necessary. The others, and there were many, we left to\r\nthe eternal mystery of the wilderness, to dance in the shadows and to\r\nwoo their mates beside the rushing waters; to rear their young and to\r\nlead the life that was intended for them from the beginning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nCROSSING THE EASTERN ANDES INTO THE CAQUETÁ\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the many little-known places in South America, the least known\r\nlie eastward of the eastern base of the Andes. One such region is\r\nthe Caquetá of Colombia. We had been considering the feasibility of\r\nundertaking a trip into this country, but the departure for home of my\r\ncompanion, Doctor Allen, and Mr. Lloyd, from San Agustin, left me alone\r\nin the field, and I doubted the advisability of taking the journey\r\nwithout their assistance. From all the information I could gather,\r\nthe crossing of the Eastern Range presented great difficulties and\r\nwould have to be accomplished on foot. The rainy season had set in,\r\nadding to the difficulties of travel. Also, the rivers were swollen\r\nto such an extent that there was danger of our being stopped at any\r\none of them; or, far worse, of being unable to recross them upon our\r\nreturn. However, a nearer view invariably changes the perspective, so I\r\ndetermined to approach the region as near as possible, gather all the\r\ndata available, and then follow the course that seemed best.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we bade a reluctant farewell to San Agustin one Sunday\r\nmorning. The entire village turned out to see us depart and gave\r\nus numerous tokens of their good-will and friendship in the form\r\nof embroidered handkerchiefs, panama hats, food, and pets. An old\r\nIndian solemnly presented me with a small monkey, which he said could\r\ncry if spanked thoroughly; he offered to give a demonstration of\r\nthe creature’s accomplishment, but I assured him that his word was\r\nsufficient. A parrot was contributed by another person who said it\r\nwould be good company, as it “conversed” well. The _Vaya con Dios!_ of\r\nthese simple, honest folk was touching, and we took away with us only\r\nthe most pleasant memories and friendliest feeling.\r\n\r\nAfter a three days’ ride through level plains and gently rolling\r\ngrasslands we forded the Rio Suaza and drew rein in the town of\r\nGuadaloupe. It stands at the foot of the Cordillera Oriental. A trail\r\nwas being constructed from this point across the mountains and into\r\nAmazonian drainage; however, work had little more than begun, and\r\nthe reports of the route we had from the villagers were not very\r\nencouraging.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing of particular interest about the village. We moved\r\nto a site known as La Danta three thousand five hundred feet up the\r\nslope. There was abundant woods all around in which we hunted with good\r\nresults nearly three weeks.\r\n\r\nOne day a party of Indians made camp on the bank of a creek not\r\nfar from La Danta, and immediately built a rock and mud dam across\r\nthe little waterway. Then they crushed a great many leaves of the\r\nyucca-plant and threw them into the stream. The milky juice quickly\r\nmingled with the water, and soon scores of catfish came to the top,\r\nstupefied by the poison, and floating on their backs. They were\r\ngathered by the basketful and taken away by the Indians. These catfish,\r\nliving in rapid mountain streams, are provided with a sucking disk\r\nwhich enables them to attach themselves to a rock to rest; otherwise\r\nthey would be washed down stream, as they are not very powerful\r\nswimmers.\r\n\r\nThe cost of being married is so high in some South American countries\r\nthat in many cases the ceremony is dispensed with. Occasionally,\r\nhowever, bands of missionaries visit a region and attempt to undo the\r\nwrong inflicted by the local _padres_ by uniting in marriage free of\r\ncharge all those who appear before them for that purpose. The _padres_\r\nare not always to blame; frequently the inhabitants are simply too\r\nindifferent or lazy to go through the formalities, or there may be no\r\none in their midst to look after their spiritual wants.\r\n\r\nWhile we were at La Danta a half-dozen priests came to Guadaloupe\r\nand urged the _paisanos_ to take advantage of this opportunity to\r\nbecome united in wedlock according to the ritual of the church. The\r\npeople listened to the exhortations, promised to heed the admonitions,\r\nand--failed to show up at the proper time. Then the _padres_ lost\r\npatience and talked the matter over with the _jefe_. The latter sent\r\nout soldiers to scour the country and bring in all the offenders living\r\ntogether within a radius of many miles; the pairs were frequently\r\nbrought in handcuffed together, all objections and excuses being\r\npromptly overruled or ignored by the officiating clergy. Then they were\r\nlined up and married.\r\n\r\nSeveral weeks later I was the guest of a very high government official\r\nin another state. In the course of dinner conversation the _señora_\r\nasked me in the most casual way: “Tell me! In your country, do\r\npeople get married, or _así, no más_ like here?” The last phrase was\r\naccompanied by a dainty snap of the fingers. I am afraid I said: “_Así,\r\nno más!_”\r\n\r\nFrom _peons_ working on the new road we learned that their operations\r\nhad extended to a point near the top of the range, and that a _tambo_,\r\nor rest-shack, had been built there to shelter the laborers. We\r\nimmediately started for the place and by dint of hard travel reached\r\nit in one day’s time. The shack bore the name Andalucia and was seven\r\nthousand nine hundred feet up. The _peons_ gladly shared their quarters\r\nwith us, and we divided our rations with them, which must have been a\r\nwelcome change from their everlasting boiled corn and _panela_.\r\n\r\nThe weather at Andalucia was most severe; fog, strong wind, almost\r\ncontinuous rain, and a freezing temperature reminded us of conditions\r\non a paramo at the worst season of the year. Also, the forest was\r\ndense, and the vast number of fallen trunks and branches rendered the\r\ngreater part of it impenetrable. Birds were scarce and hard to find,\r\nbut small mammals were plentiful.\r\n\r\nThe foreman of the work gang had cleared a few acres of land and sowed\r\nwheat, but the chances of harvesting a crop were very small, because\r\nit seemed as if all the rats and mice for miles around had located the\r\nspot and promptly migrated there to unearth the seed and cut down the\r\ntender shoots.\r\n\r\nWater for drinking and cooking was secured from a deep pit dug in the\r\nslope. One of our first cares always is to investigate the water-supply\r\nof the region in which we are working; an inspection of the excavation\r\nnear the _tambo_ revealed a most astounding state of affairs; three\r\nearthworms, as large as good-sized snakes, make the reservoir their\r\nhome. They resembled the well-known “shiners” that appear on our lawns\r\nafter a shower; but the size! The largest, by actual measurement, was\r\nthirty-seven inches long and four inches in circumference. When I\r\nasked the cook for an explanation as to why he did not remove them and\r\nkeep the water clean, he promptly informed me that they were _cojures_\r\n(cohoories) that he had dug up in the woods and placed there for\r\nsafe-keeping until he had time to use them on a fishing trip in the low\r\ncountry. Needless to say, perhaps, his pets promptly disappeared; he\r\nalways insinuated that they had met with foul play at my hands!\r\n\r\nOne day a person of distinguished appearance rode up the road and\r\nintroduced himself as General Rafael Santos, of Bogotá. He had heard\r\nthat we were in the locality and wanted to get into the Caquetá. Could\r\nhe be of any service to us? As he was in control of the work being\r\ndone on the new trail, he certainly was in a position to be of great\r\nhelp. He told us of conditions on the eastern slope and also of the\r\ncountry we were so eager to see; before leaving, one of his _peons_\r\nwas despatched down the trail to inform his scouting-parties that we\r\nwould follow within a short time, and for them to have camping-places\r\nprepared for us.\r\n\r\nWe lost no time in starting on the trip. I had with me several natives\r\nwho had been with the expedition some months, and their number was\r\naugmented by men from Guadaloupe who were eager to have a hand in the\r\nundertaking. Every one walked, the _peons_ carrying the packs; but\r\nmules were driven ahead to test the trail, and also for use after we\r\nreached the level low country.\r\n\r\nThe heavy subtropical forest that begins at La Danta continues on to\r\nthe top of the range, and down the other side in an unbroken mass of\r\nsolid, living green. There were practically no signs of life, but the\r\nwind blew less violently and the cold was less intense and not so\r\npenetrating as at Andalucia.\r\n\r\nThe slope is less abrupt than on the western side. On the second night\r\na palm-leaf lean-to called _El Paraiso_ was reached. The elevation was\r\ntwo thousand four hundred and twenty-five feet. A number of bedraggled\r\nand discontented laborers had erected this shelter and said they would\r\nstay there without doing another stroke of work until their pay,\r\nseveral months overdue, should arrive. Perhaps they are still camping\r\nthere, unless the prospect of starving to death forced them to move,\r\nas we had heard several times that the foremen were in the habit of\r\ndrawing the money for all the men under them, and then decamping for\r\nparts unknown.\r\n\r\nBeyond “the paradise” the way lay through a region that might well be\r\ncalled _El Infierno_. There was an unbroken succession of pools and\r\nsinks so that we struggled onward hour after hour through water and\r\nthin mud several feet deep. Contrary to our expectations, we had been\r\nable to use the mules for very light packs on parts of the previous\r\nday’s journey; but now they floundered and caused so much trouble, that\r\nwe heartily regretted not having left them behind.\r\n\r\nOn the following days the country was dotted with steep, rocky\r\nfoot-hills, alternated with deep, muddy depressions. Rain fell almost\r\ncontinuously, but it served to keep away troublesome insects. The\r\n_peons_ were cheerful withal and seemed to enjoy the experience in\r\nspite of the hard work. However, it was with a feeling of relief that\r\nwe emerged from the mountainous country and entered a stretch of level\r\nforest, the elevation of which was one thousand feet. From the edge of\r\nthis “plateau” we had our first view of the Caquetá--a perfect ocean of\r\nforest stretching out ahead as far as the eye can see, which on clear\r\ndays is a distance of many miles. The sight is most impressive. Not a\r\nsingle rise is visible above the uniform expanse of green, as the trees\r\nappear to be all of the same height.\r\n\r\nWe stopped at the first native hut encountered, which was but a\r\nten-minute walk from the settlement of Florencia. There was a clearing\r\nof considerable size; the greater part of it was overgrown with grass\r\nand weeds, but there were also fields of cane and plantains. The latter\r\nwere the finest I have ever found in all South America--eighteen inches\r\nlong and sweeter and better flavored than the best bananas. It was\r\nalmost impossible to grow sugar-cane in any quantity; capibaras were\r\nabundant along the streams and made nightly inroads on the plantation,\r\ndevastating large areas on each visit.\r\n\r\nThe great Amazonian forest extending on all sides was full of\r\nsurprising sounds emanating from a fauna entirely new to us. For the\r\nfirst time we heard the clear, ringing whistle of the “false bell-bird”\r\n(_Lathria cinerea_). The penetrating _whoo-ee-whee-oo_ filled the\r\nwoods with music as the birds called to one another, but the obscurely\r\ncolored singers were hard to see among the dark branches. The song\r\ncontains several low, _churring_ notes that are lost from a distance.\r\n\r\nThe abundance and variety of wild life was so great as to almost\r\nbewilder us and we worked day and night preparing the wealth of\r\nmaterial that came into our hands. Working conditions were most\r\nunfavorable; it rained daily; sand-flies took away a great deal of\r\nthe pleasure that each day brought in the form of new and interesting\r\ncreatures, while mosquitoes and fleas insisted on gaining an entrance\r\nunder the nets and making the nights disagreeable. Every member of the\r\nexpedition suffered from malaria during our entire stay in the Caquetá\r\nregion. Notwithstanding these handicaps, we lost not a single day, and\r\nthe collections rapidly grew to record-breaking size.\r\n\r\nIt was, of course, necessary to depend to a certain extent upon native\r\nhunters. They were always carefully instructed as to the area they\r\nshould visit and how to work it; from the results they obtained I\r\ncould usually tell whether directions had been followed. One of these\r\n_cazadores_ was a lazy, thoroughly good-natured half-breed named\r\n_Abrán_. He came in daily with a tale of woe, recounting in detail\r\nthe great distance he had covered, the hardships of such a long tramp\r\nthrough the jungle, and--bringing few specimens. I pretended to believe\r\nhis stories, knowing full well all the while that he had really\r\nselected a comfortable spot a mile or so away and then settled down\r\non a log for a quiet day of smoking and day-dreaming. When any animal\r\ncame within sight he shot it. In this manner he secured many of the\r\nshy, ground-haunting species, such as rails, tinamou, and ant-birds\r\nthat one seldom sees while moving about through the forest. This was\r\nexactly what I wanted. It is all but impossible to find a native\r\nhunter with patience enough to sit and wait for these things, so while\r\n_Abrán_ thought he was playing an easy game, he was in reality the\r\nmost valuable _peon_ in the outfit. His brother _Moisés_ was of the\r\nopposite temperament; he walked many miles each day and considered it\r\nbeneath his dignity to shoot anything but large, brilliantly colored\r\nbirds, such as parrots, macaws, cotingas, and tanagers, or monkeys--in\r\nshort, game worthy of a man’s efforts. The two brothers made an ideal\r\ncombination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tree-fern, typical of the Andean forests.]\r\n\r\n_Moisés_ had spoken frequently about a marvellous bird called _tente_\r\nwhich he said was found in the region, and of which he was determined\r\nto secure one as a pet for the _patrón_. One day he brought in a\r\nqueer, frightened little creature--all legs and neck--that he proudly\r\nintroduced as the _tente_. It was a young trumpeter (_Psophia_). After\r\nbeing tied up a few days it grew very tame and was given full\r\nliberty about the place. It walked slowly and in dignified fashion,\r\ncatching flies and pecking at insects on the ground or walls; but if a\r\ndog should chance to pass near by it darted at it with outspread wings,\r\nmaking a loud, rumbling sound deep down in its breast; the dog always\r\nfled in terror. The bird increased rapidly in size and before long\r\nthe beautiful metallic-blue throat-feathers appeared. When we emerged\r\nfrom the hammocks in the early mornings it was always there to greet\r\nus with low bows, spread wings, and deep murmurings. In travelling, a\r\nlarge-meshed fibre bag served as its container; upon being turned loose\r\nwhen camp was made, it first carefully dried its plumage before the\r\nfire, then strutted around a while, and finally flew into the branches\r\nof the nearest tree to spend the night. We kept this interesting\r\nlittle pet until our departure from Colombia, and then gave it to an\r\nacquaintance in Neiva, where it was well cared for.\r\n\r\nA colony of cultivator-ants had taken possession of a patch of young\r\n_cecropia_-trees near the house. They carried particles of earth to\r\nthe branches and formed them into large balls in which the seeds of a\r\nsucculent plant were sowed and cultivated. The earth was kept loose\r\nand moistened and the bunch of tender shoots resembled a clump of\r\nmistletoe. In this manner an abundant food-supply was assured.\r\n\r\nFlorencia was a small village of adobe and bamboo huts, built in\r\nanticipation of the opening of Colombian Amazonia, when the new trail\r\nacross the Andes should be completed. The region is undoubtedly rich\r\nin natural resources, and there seemed to be a possibility that the\r\ndreams of these pioneer settlers might some day be fulfilled. However,\r\nfive years later, while aboard the S. S. _Vauban_, bound for New York,\r\nI chanced to meet among the passengers a Colombian with whom I had\r\nbecome acquainted in Florencia. He stated that the climate there had\r\nproved so unhealthful that most of the people had died or gone away and\r\nthe settlement was all but deserted. The elevation of the site, though\r\nthousands of miles from the Atlantic Ocean, into which its rivers\r\ndrain, is only six hundred and seventy-five feet.\r\n\r\nDuring our stay in the vicinity we had occasion to witness a\r\ncelebration of the feast of San Juan. On the eve of the festival a pig\r\nwas slaughtered in each hut; those who had none went into the jungle\r\nand shot a wild one. The dressed carcass was placed in an oblong wooden\r\nbowl, surrounded with plantains, yuccas, and yams, and then baked four\r\nhours in a mud oven. The roasts were delicious and every one ate until\r\nnot a morsel remained, which was far into the night. Next day the\r\n_fiesta_ proper began with a bull-fight, local talent, shirtless and in\r\ntattered drawers, supplying the places of the gorgeous _toreadores_,\r\n_banderilleros_, and _matadores_. This was a fine chance for the youths\r\nto display their courage to the weaker sex, which had gathered _en\r\nmasse_ to witness the performance, and, if one enjoys such spectacles,\r\nhe would doubtless say that the showing made was quite creditable.\r\nThe men charged the bull, flourishing their bright-colored ponchos,\r\nand when the animal turned the tables and chased them they fled to\r\nshelter, as is the custom of the profession. We did not remain to see\r\nthe finish, but later in the day the women were roasting chunks of beef\r\nover open fires. The merrymaking continued for several days, and the\r\nlatter part of the period consisted in drinking _aguardiente_, with\r\nthe resultant fighting that always marks the wind-up of such affairs.\r\nThe _alcalde_ was a leading spirit in the activities of the festive\r\noccasion; he had been a priest at one time, but was excommunicated for\r\npreaching sermons of too liberal a nature. Then he married and was\r\nrearing a family. He told us that he owned a ranch called La Morelia,\r\ntwo days’ distant from Florencia, and offered to send us there; so\r\nwe accepted his courtesy with pleasure, as we were eager to see the\r\ncountry farther in the interior.\r\n\r\nA faintly defined footpath led to La Morelia. The forest is\r\ncomparatively open, that is, free from dense undergrowth. The trees are\r\ntall and there are a few tree-ferns and palms; many climbing lilies\r\nand other epiphytes grow on the trunks and branches. Moss is lacking;\r\nnear the streams bamboo, wild cane, high grass, and briars, united by\r\ncreepers, form dense jungles that are hard to penetrate. Streams and\r\nrivers are numerous and we were at once impressed with their size and\r\ndepth. Crossings were effected in dugout canoes. While the current\r\nis swift, the waterways are so silent that one is not aware of their\r\nexistence until reaching their very borders.\r\n\r\nWe saw little of the Huitoto Indians inhabiting this district. They\r\nseem to remain in seclusion in their forest homes and rarely venture\r\ninto the path of the settlers. Those we encountered were of low\r\nstature, yellow in color, and had features so nearly resembling the\r\nJapanese that they might be easily mistaken for that race. They are of\r\na shy and retiring disposition. Their ornaments were very elaborate,\r\nconsisting of anklets, amulets, and necklaces of colored seeds and\r\njaguar and monkey teeth, skilfully wrought into pleasing combinations.\r\n\r\nThe hut at La Morelia was of large dimensions, built entirely of\r\nbamboo, with palm-leaf roof. An unusual feature was that it contained\r\ntwo stories, the lower used to store grain and plantains, the upper\r\nserving as living quarters. A clearing about one hundred acres in\r\nextent surrounded it; most of it was grass-covered, providing pasturage\r\nfor a few head of cattle, the remainder was under cultivation. The\r\nseveral acres that had been given to growing plantains produced so\r\nabundantly that hundreds of bunches were going to waste. If left to\r\nmature on the plant the fruit bursts and is destroyed by insects. The\r\nchoicest clusters were cut green and then placed in a down-stairs\r\nroom of the house to ripen. At night hundreds of small bats visited\r\nthe enclosure to feed on the mountain of rapidly yellowing fruit.\r\nWe desired some of the creatures for our collections, but found it\r\ndifficult to catch or shoot them in sufficient numbers. Finally we\r\nevolved the plan of suspending a fish-net from the ceiling and tacking\r\nout the edges so that it formed a cone with a wide base. A choice\r\nbunch of the ripest plantains was placed in the centre for bait. Bats\r\nsoon gathered about the trap in swarms. At first they were suspicious\r\nand circled around the net without attempting to alight; but as their\r\nhunger increased so their caution decreased in like proportion, and\r\nbefore long they were striking the conical arrangement from all sides\r\nand madly endeavoring to scramble through the small meshes. Some\r\nsucceeded in forcing their way through the openings and immediately\r\nfell upon the bait with ravenous appetites; the vast majority, however,\r\nbecame helplessly entangled in the meshes. Newcomers arrived in a\r\nsteady stream; they paid no attention to our presence nor to the\r\nlights we carried, but frantically hurled themselves into the midst of\r\ntheir struggling brethren, until the net was covered with screeching,\r\nscrambling masses.\r\n\r\nThe house was within a stone’s throw of the Rio Bodoquera--a stream\r\ntwo hundred yards wide. One night a jaguar attacked the cattle and\r\nchased them on to a sand-spit that projected out into the stream. We\r\nheard the mad bellowing of the frightened animals as they stampeded\r\npast the shack, hotly pursued by the snarling jaguar. A few shots\r\nsufficed to frighten the big spotted cat back into the jungle, but\r\nthe cattle refused to leave the strategic position to which they had\r\nretreated. The river was rising rapidly, endangering the panic-stricken\r\ncreatures. Every hand turned out; we took lanterns with us and, manning\r\nthe canoes, paddled to the far side of the peninsula and attempted to\r\ndrive them back to the mainland. All our efforts were in vain. The work\r\nwas very exciting, as enraged members of the herd charged the lights\r\nrepeatedly when we approached close to them. Finally the water became\r\nso deep that the animals had to swim, and then they made for the far\r\nside of the river and disappeared from view. It took several days to\r\nround them up, but a number were never seen again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The high, flat-topped panorama of the Andes.]\r\n\r\nOne day a Franciscan priest stopped at the _rancho_ for a short rest.\r\nHe was engaged in opening a trail to Mocoa. About twenty _peons_\r\naccompanied him, carrying his outfit. His robe was in tatters and his\r\nfeet were bare; he had spent months in the jungles and showed the\r\neffects of hard usage. Each of his men carried an animal of some kind\r\non top of his pack. There were monkeys, parrots, macaws, and a curious\r\nlittle creature belonging to the agouti family (_Myoprocta_) that\r\nthey called _tin-tin_. We had seen numbers of the latter along the\r\nriver-bank, where they lived in burrows. The flesh is white and of fine\r\nflavor. In spite of the hardships the priest and his party had endured\r\nthey were in the best of humor, and after an hour’s halt shouldered\r\ntheir packs and resumed the march. No one will dispute the fact that\r\nmen of this type have done a great deal toward exploring unknown parts\r\nof South America; usually they are the real trail-breakers and lead the\r\nway for the pioneer settlers who are to follow.\r\n\r\nThe bird-life of the Caquetá is typical of the Amazonian forest, and\r\nmany of the species are found on the lower river two thousand miles\r\naway. This is caused by the uniformity of topographical conditions, and\r\nthe lack of a barrier that would interfere with the range of a species.\r\nOn all of our visits to the headwaters of the Amazon’s tributaries,\r\nin Colombia, Bolivia, and Brazil, a large proportion of the mammals\r\ncollected were new to science and differed greatly from those found\r\nlower down the river’s course. Such large animals as spider-monkeys\r\n(_Ateleus_), “flying” monkeys (_Pithecia_), and cats represented forms\r\nheretofore unknown to science; the smaller mammals also were new in\r\nmany instances. Of course, we must not lose sight of the fact that\r\nthe power of flight gives greater mobility to the birds and accounts\r\nfor the wider range of some of them, but not for the equally vast\r\ndistribution of the ground-inhabiting and almost flightless species.\r\n\r\nAfter a strenuous three weeks at La Morelia we returned to our first\r\nstopping-place near Florencia. The rainy season was at its worst, and\r\nlow clouds covered the forest day after day, while torrents of water\r\nfell almost continuously. The journey back to Guadaloupe was far more\r\ndifficult than had been our entrance into the region, for the greater\r\npart of it lay up-hill and mud and water had accumulated in spots until\r\nit was waist-deep. The cold grew more intense as we neared the top of\r\nthe range. We were never warm or dry until we reached our destination.\r\n\r\nThe maximum time allowed for work in Colombia had expired. Although I\r\nhad spent over eighteen months in the republic, they had flown all too\r\nrapidly, and I heartily regretted that it was not possible to visit the\r\nnumerous other places that invited exploration. The next best thing\r\nwas to hope for a return trip in the future--a hope that was realized\r\nseveral years later in our expedition to the Antioquian Highlands.\r\n\r\nThe homeward trip was accomplished without noteworthy incident. At\r\nfirst there was a ride of five days’ duration down the desert-like\r\nvalley of the Magdalena to Neiva. The river is not navigable in this\r\npart of its course on account of rapids and shallow water. At Neiva\r\na _champán_, or flat-bottomed freight-boat, was secured. The crew of\r\ntwenty men rowed it down to Giradot in three days; it takes them thirty\r\ndays to pull the craft back up-stream to the starting-point.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the journey to Puerto Colombia was merely a matter of\r\ntravel on river-steamers and train, and required two weeks’ time.\r\n\r\nIn summarizing the work of the expedition to the Caquetá, Doctor\r\nChapman, in “The Distribution of Bird Life in Colombia,” writes as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThis “work during the rainy season in the humid Amazonian forests of\r\nthe Caquetá, where with only unskilled native assistance he secured\r\neight hundred and thirty birds and mammals in thirty days, is a feat\r\nin tropical collecting.” And “this locality ... was one of the most\r\nproductive of any visited by American Museum expeditions, and many\r\nspecies were secured which have not heretofore been recorded from\r\nColombia.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nACROSS THE ANTIOQUIAN GOLD-FIELDS TO PUERTO VALDIVIA ON THE LOWER CAUCA\r\n\r\n\r\nPuerto Berrio is not the most attractive spot in Colombia, but it is\r\nnevertheless of a great deal of importance. All steamers plying on\r\nthe Lower Magdalena stop at that port, the up-going ones after a six\r\ndays’ voyage from Barranquilla to discharge freight for Medellin, and\r\nthose bound down-stream to take aboard gold and other products of the\r\nAntioquian highlands.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the steamer always causes a great deal of confusion.\r\nDebarking passengers are required to look after their own luggage,\r\nwhich is not a simple matter, as it is invariably covered with\r\nmountains of boxes and bags on the lower deck; and after it has been\r\nlocated it is necessary to secure _peons_ to convey it ashore, the\r\nship’s crew invariably refusing to render this service.\r\n\r\nThere is always a rush for the little hotel “Magdalena,” built on a\r\nslight bluff overlooking the river. Accommodations are limited, and\r\nthose who arrive first naturally have the advantage of selecting the\r\ncooler rooms in the upper story. However, the advantages gained are\r\npartly imaginary, at best. The climate is insufferably hot in the\r\ndaytime, and mosquitoes filtering through rents in the nets protecting\r\nthe beds are most annoying at night. Nor is it possible to seek the\r\ncooling comfort of a bath; a small, corrugated iron building in the\r\ngarden is supposed to provide for this need, but a tank containing\r\nwater for the shower is placed on the roof in the full glare of the\r\ntropical sun, and the water becomes heated to such a degree that it is\r\nalmost scalding.\r\n\r\nThe town of Puerto Berrio is situated a few hundred yards below the\r\nlanding. It contains about a hundred low buildings, many of which are\r\nutilized for shops where merchandise and, more important at least to\r\ntransients, a great variety of fruit may be had. All the buildings are\r\nlow--some constructed of adobe with red tile roofs, others of nothing\r\nmore substantial than bamboo, and grass or palm-leaves.\r\n\r\nBeyond the town is a low, rambling shed used as a slaughter-house. When\r\none tires of watching the blue tanagers, orioles, and yellow warblers\r\nquarrel in the cocoanut-palms near the hotel, he may tempt his æsthetic\r\ntaste by walking to the pavilion of bovine death, and look upon the\r\nhundreds of black vultures sitting on the roof, strutting and hopping\r\nover the ground, or tearing at the hides that have been stretched out\r\nto dry. These birds are so typical a part of most towns and villages of\r\ntropical Colombia that one soon learns to accept them as a matter of\r\ncourse. They act as scavengers. Without them the settlements would reek\r\nwith foulness.\r\n\r\nPuerto Berrio marks the beginning of a narrow-gauge railway, and each\r\nmorning at six a passenger-train leaves the station for Cisneros,\r\ncovering the first stage of the journey to Medellin. Almost immediately\r\nafter leaving the port, the road plunges into the finest type of\r\nMagdalena Valley forest. We therefore debarked at the first settlement,\r\ncalled Malena, only fifteen minutes after leaving the starting-point.\r\nMy assistant on this expedition was Mr. Howarth S. Boyle, of Elmhurst,\r\nLong Island.\r\n\r\nAt Malena the tropical forest reaches the height of its development.\r\nThere is a clearing large enough only to provide room for the village\r\nof some twenty houses, and the stately living wall of trees hems it\r\nin on all sides. The people are most obliging, and while there is no\r\n_posada_, or inn, of any kind, a Mestizo family volunteered to permit\r\nus the use of part of their dwelling.\r\n\r\nA short tour of inspection confirmed our first impression of the\r\nregion; it was a naturalist’s paradise. One had only to go to the\r\noutskirts of the town to find birds in greatest abundance. A number\r\nof tall dead trees had been left standing in the clearing, probably\r\nbecause it was easier to merely girdle them and let them die than to\r\ncut them down, and many blue and yellow macaws and Amazon parrots were\r\nnesting in cavities high up in the trunks. They had young at the time\r\nof our visit (March), and screamed and fluttered about the nests all\r\nday long. No one thought of disturbing them. Rough-winged swallows\r\nand martens nested in the same stubs, and apparently lived in perfect\r\nharmony with their noisy neighbors.\r\n\r\nA shallow, narrow stream of clear water flows through the clearing, and\r\na belt of woods and low sprouts mantles each bank with dusky green.\r\nThis was the favorite resort of many small birds; oven-birds and\r\nant-wrens ran about in the deep shade, while night-hawks, aroused from\r\ntheir slumbers, flapped noiselessly into the air and dropped again a\r\nfew feet away. Scores of parrakeets chattered in the branches overhead,\r\nwhile flocks of large, spotted wrens (_Heleodytes_) added to the chorus\r\nwith their incessant scolding.\r\n\r\nIf we remained close to the stream we were sure to surprise herons\r\nof several species, and black ibises wading in the shallow water. A\r\nspecies of ani (_Crotophaga_) fluttered in the overhanging bushes; they\r\nwere awkward though beautiful creatures, the size of a blue jay, with\r\nbrilliant, black iridescent plumage; the mouth was pure white, while\r\nthe eyes were of a pea-green color.\r\n\r\nIf our tramp led to the heavy forest, the character of the birds\r\nchanged. Giant orioles (_Ostinops_), grackles, and chachalacas always\r\nremained near the border of the taller growth, and toucans in flocks\r\nseemed to prefer the protection of the more inaccessible cover.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The town of Valdivia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Cauca River at Puerto Valdivia.]\r\n\r\nThe forest is magnificent, and is composed largely of ceibas with\r\nthick, white trunks and wide-spreading tops. Many _tagua_, or ivory-nut\r\npalms, grow beneath the tall trees; their fruit is one of the important\r\narticles of export from the Magdalena Valley and, during August\r\nand September, many thousands of bags are shipped down the river to\r\nBarranquilla. Wild life, however, was comparatively scarce in the\r\nforest proper, with the single exception of mosquitoes, which were\r\npresent in unlimited swarms, even in the daytime; and small troops of\r\nbrown marmosets that showed themselves at rare intervals.\r\n\r\nWhile crossing the clearing one day a flock of blue and yellow macaws\r\npassed overhead; we needed a pair for the collection, so I took a\r\nquick shot at the birds as they flew by; however, I succeeded only in\r\nwounding one of their number, which flew to the ground in a long slant\r\nand alighted so far away that it was useless to try to follow. On\r\nreaching home at noon, I was greatly surprised to find the bird perched\r\non a ladder in the very house we were occupying. It had dropped in the\r\nyard, and having been seen by some children, they tried to catch it,\r\nwhereupon it took refuge indoors and kept them at bay with its angry\r\nscreams and attempts to bite.\r\n\r\nThe evenings at Malena were fully as profitable as the mornings.\r\nWe always spent a pleasant hour or two at dusk, walking along the\r\nrailroad. Pools of water had collected in the hollows where earth\r\nfor the road-bed had been excavated, and many water-birds came there\r\nnightly to fish or catch frogs. Great blue herons, bitterns, and\r\noccasionally a cormorant or anhinga were surprised at their nocturnal\r\nfeasts. When we returned after dark we started numerous goatsuckers,\r\nwhich had settled in the open lane to catch insects and to sing; this\r\nhabit of resorting to open places, especially trails and roadways, has\r\nearned for them the name _guardacamino_ (road-guard) among the natives.\r\n\r\nMalena was such an unusually interesting place that we expected\r\nto remain there several weeks; but, unfortunately, an epidemic of\r\ndysentery had invaded the Magdalena Valley, and the village was soon\r\nwrithing in the throes of this fatal disease. Sickness and death in the\r\nfamily of our hosts made it necessary for us to continue on our way.\r\n\r\nIt requires exactly six hours to reach Cisneros, the end of the\r\nrailroad, from Puerto Berrio. The altitude of the terminus is three\r\nthousand seven hundred feet above sea-level, and as one approaches it\r\nthe heavy forest gradually disappears, to be replaced with a lower\r\ngrowth of brush and bushes; finally the hilltops are barren.\r\n\r\nAt Cisneros one may secure riding-animals, a carriage, or a motor-car,\r\naccording to the mode of travel preferred, for the short ride across\r\nthe ridge to Botero, from whence the journey may again be resumed\r\nby train. The road is splendid, and as the highest point, called La\r\nQuiebra, is only five thousand four hundred and twenty-five feet up, a\r\ncanter on a spirited horse across the divide is most enjoyable.\r\n\r\nBotero is very similar to Cisneros. There are two small hotels where\r\nthe traveller may rest in comfort until the train leaves for Medellin,\r\nwhich is at 4.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nNumerous villages are scattered along the railroad, which follows\r\nclosely the course of the Medellin River. The country is green and\r\napparently fertile. Thickets of wild cane grow near the stream, and\r\nthe valley is dotted with clumps of tall, slender willows; so dense is\r\nthe latter growth in some parts of the region that it forms groves and\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\nTwo and a half hours after leaving Botero the train arrived at\r\nMedellin. Medellin is the third largest city of Colombia, and boasts\r\nof a population of seventy thousand. The city is not modern but very\r\npicturesque, and lies in a depression almost completely surrounded\r\nby mountains. We were fortunate enough to make the acquaintance of\r\nthe American consul, Mr. H. B. Meyerheim, who rendered the expedition\r\ninvaluable service during our entire stay in Antioquia.\r\n\r\nThe people of the state differ from the Colombians living in other\r\nparts of the country in that they possess more initiative and business\r\nability; and for this reason they are frequently referred to as the\r\nJews of Colombia. Some authorities go so far as to assert that they are\r\nreally descendants of a colony of Jews that settled there many years\r\nago. For this belief there seems to be very little foundation. The fact\r\nthat the climate is bracing and that it requires a greater amount of\r\nwork to gain a living in the semiarid country probably accounts for the\r\nincreased degree of energy displayed by the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nOur first expedition was to a point in the mountains southeast of\r\nthe city, known as Santa Elena, and only a few hours’ ride on mules\r\nfrom Medellin. After crossing the ridge we found ourselves on a high,\r\nwild plateau, which had at one time been covered with forest; but the\r\ntrees had been felled on the greater part of the area, and only small,\r\nscattered patches of woods were left untouched. There are numerous\r\nlittle huts in this upland country, and at one of these we decided to\r\nremain for as long a time as the country proved a profitable collecting\r\nground.\r\n\r\nOn account of the great change in the flora, occasioned by\r\ndeforestation, a corresponding change had taken place in the bird\r\nlife. But little remained of the subtropical fauna we had expected to\r\nfind; however, there were black thrushes, several species of tanagers,\r\ntoucans, trogons, and motmots, besides many commoner species. Weasels\r\nwere abundant and occasionally blundered into our traps; these animals\r\nare very easy to call up, and if one sits quietly and imitates the\r\nscreams and squeaks of a wounded bird, it is often possible to attract\r\na weasel to within a few feet, and at times it will run across one’s\r\nlap in search for the supposed victim. There were also squirrels of\r\nseveral species, and tiger-cats.\r\n\r\nMany flowering shrubs dotted the roadside, imparting a blaze of color\r\nto the muddy highway; some of them were covered with brilliant scarlet\r\nblossoms, and others with snowy trumpetflowers of great size. In\r\naddition to this wealth of native flowers, the people cultivated plots\r\nof gladioli and roses, both of which attained great size and beauty in\r\nspite of the cold, wet climate.\r\n\r\nWe continued on across the highland from Santa Elena to a place called\r\nBarro Blanco, passing through the villages of Rio Negro and Carmen on\r\nthe way; but the character of the country did not change appreciably!\r\nOne of the products of the high, bleak region that immediately\r\nattracted our attention was a variety of maize; this thrived even on\r\nrocky ground. The ears were large and well-formed, and the huge, even\r\ngrains were of a milky-white color and of splendid flavor. Large flocks\r\nof pigeons came to the corn-fields to feed and furnished splendid\r\nshooting; they fly down the mountainsides at terrific speed, and the\r\nrushing noises made by the wings can be heard at a great distance. On\r\nthe edges of the fields grew small trees (_Ficus_) bearing quantities\r\nof white berries; birds of many species, including flycatchers, came to\r\nfeed on them.\r\n\r\nAfter completing our work in the Santa Elena region we returned to\r\nMedellin. Then we took the train as far as a station called Barbosa,\r\nand started overland for the Lower Cauca. We brought both pack and\r\nriding mules with us on the train, as it was difficult to obtain them\r\nat Barbosa, and when everything had been unloaded at the station, packs\r\nwere adjusted and the mules started up the exceedingly steep ridge to\r\nthe north. The altitude of Barbosa is four thousand six hundred and\r\ntwenty-five feet above sea-level, but there was no break in the narrow,\r\nrocky trail until we had reached the summit, eight thousand one hundred\r\nfeet up. A few miles beyond the top lies the village of Don Matias,\r\nalmost concealed in a deep depression and surrounded by fruit-trees.\r\nThe trail continues to wind across a rolling, arid country. Boulders\r\nof great size are strewn on the ground; they are of a most peculiar\r\nformation, consisting of concentric layers of stone, one or two inches\r\nthick.\r\n\r\nWater is scarce, and we passed only one stream, and that of small size,\r\ncalled the Rio Porce.\r\n\r\nSeven leagues is considered a good day’s travel in Colombia, on account\r\nof the mountainous nature of the country and poor trails. However, on\r\nour first day out from Barbosa we covered only five leagues, and spent\r\nthe night at a hut called Sabanete, nine thousand feet up. Early the\r\nfollowing morning we reached Santa Rosa, the centre of the Antioquian\r\ngold-fields. The town is of considerable size, but stands in the middle\r\nof a bleak, arid plain, and is about as cheerless a place as one\r\ncould find. The surrounding country is exceedingly rich in gold, and\r\nnumberless mines pierce the flat, stony surface, and penetrate into the\r\nhillsides. The only drawback to mining operations on a gigantic scale\r\nis the lack of water. During the rainy season the inhabitants of Santa\r\nRosa gather water in barrels and every available sort of container, and\r\nthen wash gold out in the street in front of their homes, or in the\r\nback yards. Despite its many natural disadvantages, Antioquia is one of\r\nthe richest states in Colombia, and produces a great proportion of that\r\ncountry’s yearly output of gold, which in 1916 amounted to $5,400,000.\r\n\r\nThe country beyond Santa Rosa is practically uninhabited for a distance\r\nof ten or twelve miles; after that a growth of low woods gradually\r\nappears, and with it an abundance of bird life, such as California\r\nwoodpeckers, green and yellow jays, black thrushes, warblers, and\r\nparrots. This was in great contrast to the arid country we had just\r\nleft behind, where practically the only sign of life was an occasional\r\nhawk hovering in the air for many minutes at a time, in the hope of\r\nsurprising an unsuspecting lizard or some small rodent among the rocks\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nIt was in this forest that we again encountered a number of one of the\r\nmost beautiful birds found in the entire region--the white-crowned\r\ntanager (_Serricossypha albacristata_). A flock of sixteen sat in the\r\ntop of a bush and kept up a continuous shrill peeping.\r\n\r\nThe third night after leaving Medellin we reached Yarumal, a large\r\ntown built on a steep, rocky slope. From a distance it seems as if the\r\nhouses were standing one on top of another, and it is difficult to\r\nunderstand what prevents the whole town from sliding down the steep\r\nmountainside.\r\n\r\nThe “Hotel de la Madre” is one of the institutions of Yarumal. It is\r\nconducted by an old negress who looked us over suspiciously and found\r\nit hard to decide whether or not to admit us. While deliberating and\r\nfumbling about her shawl she scratched her finger severely on a pin;\r\nto this I immediately applied a few grains of permanganate taken from\r\nmy snake-bite lancet. This won her favor, and we were given a room.\r\nLater she confided to us that two Englishmen had stopped there the\r\nweek before. “We were frightened to death when we found out that they\r\nwere Englishmen,” she said, “because England is at war, you know. But\r\nwhat do you think? They paid their bill next morning and left without\r\nhurting anybody. However, we made up our minds to be careful about\r\nadmitting strangers in the future.”\r\n\r\nOne may ride from Yarumal to Valdivia in one day; but we broke the trip\r\nby stopping at a large wayside inn called La Frijolera. It was in the\r\nmidst of a splendid forest growth, the elevation being five thousand\r\nfeet. From a distance the forest looked most promising, but on account\r\nof the density of mosses, ferns, and creepers forming the undergrowth\r\nit was all but impenetrable.\r\n\r\nWe located a grove of guavas a short distance from the house, and this\r\nproved the most prolific hunting-ground. It was always possible to\r\nshoot squirrels there, as they came out at all hours of the day to feed\r\non the ripening fruit. Many birds also flocked to the low trees for\r\ntheir daily sustenance, and even opossums lurked about the roots and\r\nbrush to pick up the sweet morsels dropped by the furred and feathered\r\nflocks feasting in the branches.\r\n\r\nAt La Frijolera we engaged a native hunter who owned a famous\r\nhunting-dog named _Golondrina_ (meaning swallow). Words can hardly\r\nbe found to convey an accurate picture of the hunter, but the dog’s\r\nname at once suggests its chief accomplishment. Day after day our\r\nman took his dog afield in search of agoutis, but he always returned\r\nempty-handed, explaining that while he had started a number of the\r\nanimals we wanted, _Golondrina_ could never _see_ them, and so she\r\nfailed to catch them. However, one day he saved his reputation as a\r\nhunter by making a difficult trip of ten miles to a steep, heavily\r\nwooded ravine, and shooting a number of red howler monkeys. A few days\r\nlater the dog accidentally came across a peccary, which some native\r\nhunters were pursuing, brought it to bay on a rock, and kept it there\r\nuntil it could be shot.\r\n\r\nThis place presented rare opportunities for hunting by night. A road\r\nhad been cut through the forest, dividing it in two clean-cut sections.\r\nHowever, the tips of wide-spreading branches from each side of the\r\nclear swath met in several places, forming an aerial connection above\r\nthe road. These are known as “monkey bridges” because night monkeys\r\nand other animals utilize them in crossing from one section of the\r\nforest to another. As there was a full moon it was only necessary to\r\nsit quietly on a stump near one of the bridges and wait. Before long\r\na rustling sound would come from the tree-top, so slight as to be\r\nscarcely audible, and occasionally a deep, low grunt; then silent,\r\nshadowy forms emerged from the blackness of concealing foliage and\r\nslowly made their way across the springy passage. Kinkajous also used\r\nthese bridges, and as the natives prized the skins of these animals\r\nhighly for making chaparejos, they conducted a regular business of\r\nhunting them on moonlight nights. After shooting in one spot for\r\nseveral nights in succession, it was necessary to leave it undisturbed\r\nfor some time, as the animals became wary and sought other bridges.\r\n\r\nThe town of Valdivia is located on a little ridge four thousand two\r\nhundred feet up, about ten miles from Puerto Valdivia, which is on the\r\nCauca River. All the intervening country is wooded.\r\n\r\nWe reached the port on a Sunday afternoon. The people from a distance\r\nof many miles around flocked to the spot on this day for the purpose of\r\nhaving a “good time,” so that there were upward of a hundred natives\r\nin and about the one corrugated iron and bamboo building comprising\r\nthe _puerto_, dancing, drinking, fighting, and trading at the little\r\nshop. The owner of the house received us courteously (and where in all\r\nColombia was courtesy wanting?) and we soon made ourselves comfortable\r\nin the large wareroom which formed one end of the structure. There was\r\nno thought of work that day, for everybody crowded about to have a good\r\nlook at and welcome the _gringos_, but we made the best of the occasion\r\nand secured a good deal of information concerning the surrounding\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe Cauca, a swift, muddy stream four or five hundred feet wide at this\r\npoint, is hemmed in on both sides by the steep slopes of the Western\r\nand Central Andean Ranges, the forest extending down to the water. It\r\nis navigable from here on down to a small settlement called Cáceres,\r\nbut rafts and canoes only are employed in making this journey, which\r\nrequires half a day going down and two days coming up. The natives\r\nare a careless lot while on the water, and numbers of lives are lost\r\nannually. About the first thing we saw was the body of a man floating\r\ndown the river, with a vulture perched on it. We asked Don José, owner\r\nof the place, why he did not send some of his peons in a canoe to\r\nrecover it. He replied that if he did he would be required to care for\r\nthe body until a government official from Yarumal came to view it, and\r\nthen he and every one present would have to go back with the coroner to\r\ngive their testimony as to the finding of the cadaver. This entailed\r\nso much trouble that it was customary not to pay any attention to such\r\noccurrences.\r\n\r\nIn few places have I seen such an abundance of interesting fauna as\r\nat Puerto Valdivia. The forest was teeming with birds; mammals were\r\nplentiful; shoals of fish and even caimans swarmed in the river; there\r\nwere also insects enough to cheer the heart of an entomologist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A naturalists’ camp in the forest.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A native hunter with a red howling monkey.]\r\n\r\nIn such a region the naturalist has no idle moments. When we tired of\r\nworking with birds and mammals, which were of chief interest to us, we\r\nhad only to step to the river-bank, where vast swarms of brilliantly\r\ncolored butterflies settled in thick masses in the mud or rocks to\r\ndrink. A single sweep of the net often ensnared several score of the\r\ninsects. A species of _Urania_ of a black and green color predominated,\r\nbut a _Diana_, deep red above and spotted with silver dots on the\r\nunder-side was not uncommon.\r\n\r\nFish could always be secured in abundance. If we attempted to catch\r\nthem with hooks we usually landed catfish or small eels. It is unlawful\r\nto use dynamite in Colombia, but Don José had a goodly supply stored\r\naway and did not hesitate to use it when occasion required. The _peons_\r\ndetailed for that purpose selected a spot in the river where logs and\r\nbrush had grounded to form a drift, or where the water eddied against a\r\nsharp bend; they tied a rock to the explosive, lit the fuse and threw\r\nit into the water. After a few moments, during which the water hissed\r\nand bubbled as the gases from the burning fuse rose and escaped, a\r\ndull thud followed and, almost immediately, the surface was littered\r\nwith numbers of dead and stunned fish. They were invariably a species\r\nof “Pacu” (_Prochilodus nigricans_), weighing from one to four or five\r\npounds, and proved to be excellent eating.\r\n\r\nNot far from the port is an old cacao-plantation which has apparently\r\nbeen deserted for a number of years. The trees are tall and covered\r\nwith moss, while the sheltering _cochimbas_ or _madre de cacaos_ form\r\na high canopy of interlocking branches. To this cool retreat almost\r\nevery species of bird common in the region came to feed or to pass the\r\nnoonday hours. There were buccos and wood-hewers in abundance--the\r\nformer dull, stupid birds, which sat quietly on the lower twigs in\r\nthe hope that some insect would wing its way not too far from their\r\never-hungry mouths; the latter, agile and alert as they scampered up\r\nthe moss-covered trunks, eagerly examining each crevice for a hidden\r\ngrub or an ant. Gorgeous trogons with resplendent green backs and\r\nblood-red breasts flitted among the lower branches, and little parrots\r\nof bright green with gold-colored heads screamed and fluttered in the\r\nleafy branches high overhead. Where ferns and brush grew thickest, near\r\nthe numerous ravines, flocks of yellow manakins (_Manacus_) sputtered\r\nand whirred in the semidarkness; they proved to be an undescribed form.\r\n\r\nMammals, too, were not lacking. Of chief interest were giant black\r\nweasels with white throat patches (_Tayra_). These are truly dreadful\r\ncreatures--at least to the animals on which they feed. They are of\r\npowerful build, the neck muscles being particularly well-developed,\r\nand I can picture them as a dangerous antagonist even to a deer or a\r\npeccary.\r\n\r\nThe smallest of ant-eaters (_Cycloterus didactylus_) was also found in\r\nthis region. This little animal, while not rare, perhaps, is seldom\r\nseen on account of its diminutive size and arboreal habits. It is of\r\na beautiful golden color, and the fur is so fine and silky that could\r\nit be obtained in quantities sufficient for commercial purposes it\r\nwould perhaps rival in value the highest priced fur in use to-day. The\r\ncreature lives in the tree-tops and is diurnal in habits. It moves\r\nalong the branches with great rapidity, either in an upright position\r\nor inverted like a sloth, the prehensile tail being used constantly.\r\nAnts form the food, and as these ascend even the highest trees, the\r\nlittle ant-eater has a never-failing and abundant supply; they are\r\ngathered up hurriedly as the little creature moves quickly along.\r\n\r\nOne day an army of carnivorous ants invaded our quarters while we\r\nwere busily occupied preparing the specimens collected during the\r\nmorning. The first intimation we had of the arrival of the ravaging\r\nhost was when scores of cockroaches suddenly appeared and frantically\r\nran up the walls of the room. Not long after, several centipedes eight\r\ninches long joined the fleeing cockroaches, and before long a number\r\nof scorpions followed in their wake, hotly pursued by the multitude\r\nof ants. There was nothing for us to do but follow the lead of the\r\npanic-stricken insects, so we hurriedly transferred our collections to\r\na zone of safety outdoors, and waited a few hours until the ant army\r\nhad completed its work and gone on its way. The natives welcome these\r\nvisits as the ants act as scavengers and rid the house of vermin.\r\n\r\nWhile at Puerto Valdivia we were presented with a young night monkey\r\nnot larger than a good-sized mouse. It was a most interesting pet,\r\nand readily took to a diet of condensed milk, which it drank from a\r\nspoon. My companion, to whom the little animal belonged, kept it on the\r\nwindow-sill, from which point of vantage it took a lively interest in\r\nall that occurred within its range of vision. It so happened that there\r\nwas a very small crack in the sill, and this proved to be a matter of\r\nthe utmost concern to the tiny monkey. Hundreds of times each day it\r\ncrept timidly to the crack and peered down into it anxiously, although\r\nthere was only darkness below. When we held the pelt of an animal near\r\nit paid no attention whatever to it, with the single exception of the\r\nskin of one of its species, which it recognized immediately, and to\r\nwhich it clung tenaciously. When we left the hot climate of the Lower\r\nCauca and started on the return journey to Medellin the little creature\r\nwas unable to withstand the cold of the higher altitude and died.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of our zoological exploration of this section of Antioquia\r\nwas to secure material that would throw light on the geography of the\r\ncountry farther north; for, beyond the general knowledge that the\r\njunction of the Cauca and the Magdalena mark the breaking down of\r\nthe Cordillera Central, we knew comparatively little of a definite\r\ncharacter about this part of Colombia. It was not until several\r\nmonths later that our work farther west--on the Paramillo and the\r\nRio Sucio--provided the material which, viewed from a distributional\r\nstandpoint, furnished the clews that aided very materially in solving\r\nour problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nASCENT OF THE PARAMILLO--COLLECTING ON THE RIO SUCIO\r\n\r\n\r\nThe return to Medellin from Puerto Valdivia occupied five days. We\r\nagain went to our former headquarters, the “Gran Hotel,” and spent a\r\nfew busy days packing the large collections brought from the Lower\r\nCauca. Then we began to gather provisions and cargo mules for a second\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nUpon leaving Medellin we started northwestward, having in view an\r\nascent of the Paramillo, a lofty spur of the Andes, jutting out of the\r\nWestern Range slightly below latitude 7° south. This region, so far as\r\nI am able to discover, had never been explored.\r\n\r\nAt first the trail is wide and very good, so that within four hours\r\nafter starting we reached the summit of the first ridge, eight thousand\r\nseven hundred and fifty feet up. A great cleft in the bare, rocky\r\npeaks forms a natural pass and saves a climb of at least an additional\r\nthousand feet. The slope on the other (western) side is more gentle.\r\n\r\nWe were immediately impressed with the barren nature of the country,\r\nfor, with the exception of a few patches of low brush, and clumps of\r\nwithered grass, there was no vegetation. An occasional glimpse of the\r\nCauca River, far below, presented the picture of a broad yellow ribbon\r\nlying upon a brown, rocky plain.\r\n\r\nThat night we reached San Geronimo, a small town well down in the\r\nvalley. Limited plots of ground are irrigated in the vicinity of the\r\nsettlement, where rice, corn, and pasturage are cultivated by the\r\ninhabitants. Yellow-rumped tanagers, anis, and finches (_Sycalis_) make\r\nthis little oasis their home, and add greatly to its attractiveness.\r\n\r\nNext morning we were in the saddle before six o’clock. A few hours\r\nlater, after crossing a low ridge, we came suddenly upon Sopetran, a\r\nbeautiful little town completely hidden in groves of palms, mangoes,\r\nand other lovely trees. The cluster of some hundreds of snow-white\r\nhouses with red roofs, wide, well-kept streets, and the abundance of\r\nmulticolored birds fluttering and singing among the deep green foliage,\r\nrender Sopetran one of the most attractive towns of its size I have\r\nseen in tropical America.\r\n\r\nAt noon we reached the Cauca and crossed that sluggish, muddy stream\r\non a suspension bridge about eight hundred feet long. The cables are\r\nanchored in picturesque brick piers built into the face of the steep\r\nbanks, and hundreds of swallows utilize as nesting-sites the small\r\nopenings where the wires enter the masonry. Gravel flats flank the\r\nsides of the river, and bare, sandy islands divide the water into\r\nseveral channels. The elevation is approximately two thousand feet.\r\n\r\nOne league beyond the Cauca lies the town of Antioquia. If Sopetran\r\nis the last word in attractiveness, Antioquia must be placed at the\r\nextreme other end of the scale. The wide, arid valley supports no\r\nvegetation except occasional clumps of cacti and dwarfed mimosas,\r\nwhich rather add to its desert-like appearance. The heat is almost\r\nunbearable, as the Western and Central Andes, hemming in the valley\r\nbetween huge walls of pink clay and sandstone, shut off all ventilating\r\nwinds.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was still early in the afternoon, we decided to spend\r\nthe rest of the day in Antioquia, as the pack-mules seemed nearly\r\nexhausted; but it was not long before we heartily regretted not having\r\navoided the town and made camp out in the open plains. Our _arriero_\r\nhad guided us to the little hotel, where a matronly _señora_ received\r\nus with evident joy and a great deal of ceremony, probably because\r\nwe were the first guests in some time; we soon discovered, however,\r\nthat she was not the only one to whom our visit gave pleasure. Fleas\r\nin droves appeared from the cracks in the brick flooring and made\r\ntheir way through leggings, trousers, and all other wearing apparel\r\nas quickly and easily as the proverbial rat running through a cheese;\r\nand when we entered our room, vermin of a still more objectionable\r\ncharacter rushed joyfully from the beds, walls, and chairs to gloat in\r\nhungry anticipation at their prospective victims. We erected our cots\r\nin the _patio_ and spent a long, long night out in the open.\r\n\r\nBuriticá was reached on the following day. Immediately after leaving\r\nAntioquia, a mere ledge of a trail begins the ascent of the Coast\r\nRange, and while a good deal of anxiety was felt for the safety of the\r\npack-animals, it was nevertheless a relief to escape from the cheerless\r\ndesert wastes and the intolerable heat of the low country. The altitude\r\nof Buriticá is six thousand two hundred feet. On account of the jaded\r\ncondition of the mules, we spent a half-day in the town, and also\r\nlightened the cargoes by leaving at the inn all equipment intended for\r\na subsequent journey in another direction. We had, of course, never\r\nvisited Buriticá before, but I had not the slightest hesitation in\r\nleaving with perfect strangers a good deal of valuable material. The\r\nhonesty of the Colombians is well known, and we did not lose a single\r\nthing by theft during the entire two years I spent in that country.\r\n\r\nAt Tabacal, a half day’s ride from Buriticá, we lost sight of the Cauca\r\nRiver. Our view was shut off by an independent ridge of mountains\r\nseveral thousand feet high, which rises out of the valley between the\r\nrange we were on and the stream. A slight change was also perceptible\r\nin the character of the country; extensive areas covered with brush now\r\ndotted the slopes, although at infrequent intervals; and on the extreme\r\ntops of both ranges a thin fringe of green was plainly discernible.\r\nThe country is also very rough and broken, and there are a number of\r\nridges to be crossed, many of which are two thousand feet high. Several\r\nseparate mountains, not connected with the main ranges, stand here and\r\nthere like giant, man-hewn monoliths, rising from a basal elevation of\r\nthree thousand to eight or nine thousand feet, which magnifies their\r\ntremendous proportions.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth day we reached an altitude of eight thousand feet, and\r\nentered a fine strip of forest, the first we had seen on this journey.\r\nThis is the beginning of the forested zone, and close scrutiny\r\nrevealed the fact that it begins at precisely the same height on both\r\nthe Central and Coast Ranges, and continues to the very top of the\r\nmountains, several thousands of feet higher up. We travelled along the\r\ntop of the ridge for some miles, and then again descended abruptly to\r\nthe barren valley where the little village of Peque is situated, and\r\nwhere our journey by mules ended.\r\n\r\nPeque contains about fifty dilapidated mud huts, and its population is\r\nmostly of Indian descent, but includes some pure-blooded Indians. We\r\nhad a letter of introduction to one of the latter, Julian David, who\r\nis the chief man in the town, and he rendered us every assistance. He\r\ncalled together a number of sturdy young half-breeds and requested them\r\nto join the expedition; in other words, told them to carry our packs to\r\nthe top of the Paramillo. The men eagerly agreed to do this, for they\r\nhad never before been in the service of strangers, and the trip to the\r\nhigh country and also the society of _gringos_ promised interesting\r\npossibilities. We spent a few days investigating the neighboring\r\ncountry, while the men had their wives prepare the provisions for their\r\nuse during the trip.\r\n\r\nSome of the country surrounding Peque once doubtless bore a light\r\nforest growth, with heavier forest in the ravines; but by far the\r\ngreater part is naturally barren or covered with brush thickets. I was\r\ntold that at the time of the Spanish invasion forty thousand Indians\r\ninhabited the region, and as the several mountain streams supply an\r\nabundance of water, and the soil responds fairly well to cultivation,\r\nthere seems to be no reason why it should not have supported an\r\nextensive population; at the present time only a few hundred people are\r\nleft, the others having gone to swell the ranks of victims exacted by\r\nthe lust of the conquerors.\r\n\r\nThe forested zone, beginning at eight thousand feet on the ridge we\r\nhad just traversed, gradually extends its limits downward as one goes\r\nfarther north, until at Peque it reached as low as five thousand feet\r\nin the deeper and well-watered ravines; and, as previously stated, at\r\nPuerto Valdivia it reaches the very edge of the Cauca.\r\n\r\nOne day an inhabitant of Tabacal rushed into our room and begged me\r\nto show him the wonderful diamond ring he said I wore while in his\r\nvillage; he had been away at the time, so had not seen it, but tales\r\nhad reached his ears upon his return of the marvellous brilliancy\r\nof the stone which lighted up the whole street as we walked along.\r\nAt first I wondered from what sort of an hallucination the man was\r\nsuffering, for neither my companion nor myself carried any diamonds\r\nwith us; finally I remembered that, in trying to find our way through\r\nthe street at Tabacal, we had used a small electric flash-light to\r\navoid falling over the pigs or into the mud-wallows; whereupon I\r\ndemonstrated its mysterious powers to him, and he started back on his\r\ntwo days’ walk a better-informed but nevertheless a most-disappointed\r\nman.\r\n\r\nA stream of clear, cold water flows around one side of the hill upon\r\nwhich Peque stands, and to this we went nightly for a swim. Don Julian\r\ncould not quite believe us when we told him of the purpose of our\r\nnocturnal prowls; so one night he accompanied us to the stream and,\r\nwonder of wonders, we actually did go into the water. I invited him to\r\njoin us, but he said: “No, such a thing is unheard of; and, besides, an\r\nIndian is just like a cat; when either one gets wet it dies!”\r\n\r\nWhen the half-breed porters who were to carry the equipment finally had\r\ntheir _charque_ and _jarepas_ all ready, they shouldered their packs\r\nand started for the mountains. As there was no trail, an additional man\r\nwas engaged to go in advance and clear an opening with his machete.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The porters en route to the Paramillo.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cuña Indians at Dabeiba.]\r\n\r\nA three hours’ walk brought us to a point called El Madero, because\r\na few trees had once been cut down there for their lumber, but the\r\nclearing was overgrown with blackberry-briars, brush, and guavas. Then\r\nwe plunged into the unexplored forest.\r\n\r\nIt was our plan to follow along the top of an undulating ridge\r\nwhich one of the men said was the shortest and easiest route to the\r\nParamillo. He knew from experience, having once visited the region some\r\nsixteen years before. It was during the course of a revolution; his\r\nfather was pursued by the opposing forces and fled into the forest,\r\ntaking his son, who was then a small boy, with him, and eventually\r\nreaching the Paramillo, they spent some time there in concealment.\r\n\r\nAt first the forest was fairly penetrable, but soon the moss-draped,\r\nliana-garlanded walls closed about us in a compact mass; ferns, palms,\r\nand arums sprang up from the ground in a matted jungle to join the\r\nheavily laden branches above. Then our trail-cutter was pressed into\r\nservice, and plied his machete with deadly effect on the vegetation,\r\nwith the result that a narrow tunnel was opened, through which we\r\nwalked or crawled as occasion might demand.\r\n\r\nOn account of the long climb, having ascended five thousand feet during\r\nan eight hours’ march, we made camp at three o’clock at an elevation of\r\nten thousand feet. This gave us an opportunity of observing a few of\r\nthe birds living in this untouched wilderness. There were wood-hewers\r\nand yellow-headed tanagers; parrots and blue-throated jays. A large\r\nharpy-eagle sat majestically on a low branch, surrounded by a flock\r\nof California woodpeckers, which screamed and scolded and darted at\r\nhis head; but he sat perfectly motionless, utterly disdainful of such\r\nignominious prey.\r\n\r\nThere was no water on the ridge, but a supply was secured from a ravine\r\na thousand feet lower down; it was the last we had until we reached the\r\nParamillo two days later.\r\n\r\nThe second day’s march we hoped would be over a gentler slope, but it\r\nwas soon discovered that our ridge consisted of a number of knolls\r\nrising from five hundred to a thousand feet above the mean level, and\r\nthe forest grew denser constantly. Every foot of the way had to be\r\ncleared. In places we actually walked over the top of the vegetation;\r\nthe branches were covered with a solid tangle of creepers, climbing\r\nbamboo, bromelias, and moss, and formed springy aerial bridges. More\r\nfrequently it was easier to burrow underneath, so tunnels many yards\r\nlong were cut, through which the porters crawled on hands and knees.\r\nThe tops of some of the eminences were void of trees, their place being\r\ntaken by jungles of bamboo, wild oleanders, shrubs, and clumps of tall,\r\ncoarse grass with blades eight feet high and six inches wide, the edges\r\nof which cut like knives. That night we camped at eleven thousand\r\nthree hundred and fifty feet up. The men eagerly cut down clumps of\r\nbromelias, hoping to obtain water from the bases of the leaves, but all\r\nthey found were a few drops of vile, black liquid filled with drowned\r\ninsects. Although we had travelled steadily for ten hours, I doubt if\r\nwe had covered more than three miles.\r\n\r\nA few hours after starting, on the morning of the third day, we\r\nemerged suddenly from the gloom of the forest. Instead of the tall,\r\noverburdened trees, there were extensive areas covered with brush,\r\nevergreens, stunted pines, and ferns. Beyond stretched the bleak,\r\nwind-swept slope of the Paramillo. At sight of this, the porters\r\nstruggled on frantically, for the attaining of the goal meant a release\r\nfrom their heavy burdens--and water. That afternoon the last knoll\r\nhad been crossed and the packs deposited on a rocky flat which was to\r\nserve as a camping-site. Each man started in a difference direction in\r\nsearch of a brook, and by dusk a pot-hole at the bottom of a ravine,\r\nand only a few hundred yards from camp, had been found containing\r\nseveral hundred gallons of pure, icy water. Never was a discovery more\r\nearnestly welcomed, and the men sprawled around the edges of the pool\r\nand drank their fill; then it was arranged that they should stay\r\nwith us for the night, start back to Peque the next morning, and return\r\nfor us after ten days. Our cook was of course to remain with us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Our camp on the Paramillo.]\r\n\r\nThe Paramillo region is composed of a series of sharply inclined peaks,\r\nthe highest of which has an elevation of thirteen thousand feet, and\r\nis interspersed with ravines and deep fissures. The surface consists\r\nmainly of dark sandstone, so shattered over vast areas that a thin\r\nlitter of particles covers the fundamental rock. Occasionally a thin\r\nvein of white quartz crops out to the surface, especially where, as\r\noften occurs, the strata stand in a perpendicular position.\r\n\r\nAt night the temperature dropped to 28° F., and ice half an inch thick\r\nformed on the reservoir; in the morning the ground was white with\r\nfrost. The sparse vegetation on the slope consists of _frailejones_,\r\nblueberry-bushes and tall, tough grass; stunted trees and bushes, all\r\ncovered with moss, grow in the deeper ravines. Hunting in these latter\r\nplaces was a never-ending source of delight; there was no water so\r\nit was possible to walk unrestrictedly underneath the green vault of\r\nbrush which fringed the sides and met overhead. Many little mammals’\r\ntrails zigzagged over the moss-covered rocks, and burrows opened into\r\nthe steep banks; if we stole noiselessly along, or better still, sat\r\nquietly for a few minutes, the inquiring eyes of a paca, a large,\r\nspotted, tailless rodent, were sure to peer timidly out of some dark\r\nopening, to be followed later by the animal’s entire body as it moved\r\nout stealthily to nibble on the tender sprouts. Numbers of woolly,\r\nyellow rats (_Melanomys_) also appeared to stare with beady, black\r\neyes, and to nervously twitch their noses; sometimes they came out\r\nboldly to chase one another over well-defined runways and through mossy\r\ntunnels; but more often, they were content merely to gaze from the\r\nentrance of some safe retreat into which they vanished at the first\r\nsuspicious move on our part. Deer, too, were seen occasionally, but\r\nthey were not numerous; they grazed on the slopes in broad daylight,\r\nand had snug lairs in dense clumps of bushes which always commanded a\r\nview of the surrounding country. We saw no cougars or bears although we\r\nfound the remains of several deer which had apparently been killed by\r\nthese animals.\r\n\r\nBirds were extremely scarce and, strange to relate, exceedingly wary.\r\nCollecting them was heart-breaking work; the slopes are so steep,\r\nthat it was impossible to walk many yards without becoming utterly\r\nexhausted, and tramping through the high, wet grass chilled the lower\r\nextremities to numbness. The slaty finch (_Phrygilus_) so common at\r\nSanta Isabel, and two species of honey-creepers (_Diglossa_) were\r\nby far the most common; followed by a queer, wren-like little bird\r\n(_Scytalopus_) called tapacola, which lives among the densest ferns and\r\nmosses; it was seldom seen, but a cheery whistle apprised us constantly\r\nof its presence. There was also a gorgeous humming-bird, the whole body\r\nbeing of the most resplendent, iridescent deep rose and green colors;\r\nwe located a nest of this species, a tiny moss cup scarcely an inch\r\nacross, suspended from a creeper dangling beneath a bower of protecting\r\nleaves; it held two minute eggs, so fragile that the mere touch of a\r\nfinger would crush them.\r\n\r\nOne day we ascended the highest peak in order to obtain a good view\r\nof the surrounding country. The Paramillo rises like a rocky island,\r\nout of an ocean of forest. Clouds fill the depressions between the\r\nneighboring peaks, and surging, tumbling banks of white roll up the\r\nslopes or ascend in columns to spread out in funnel-shaped masses in\r\nthe higher altitudes and become dissipated by the sun. To the southward\r\nrises the lofty Paramo of Frontino, many miles distant, the flat top\r\ndimly outlined in a grayish haze.\r\n\r\nToward the close of the tenth day, we heard loud calls and, soon after,\r\nour faithful porters dashed into camp. We were astonished at their\r\nnumber for, according to our agreement, only the original number was\r\nto return, there being no need for the trail-cutters; however, several\r\nadditional men had arrived. Upon reaching the Paramillo, we had\r\njestingly remarked that we should ascend the highest peak because we\r\ncould perhaps see New York from the top; the extra men heard of this,\r\nand seriously explained that they had come to make the ascent in order\r\nto get a view of “Rome where the Holy Father lives!”\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning, we broke camp and started back. The homeward\r\ntrip was much easier, for the packs were lighter, and the greater part\r\nof the distance was down-hill. After two days we emerged from the\r\nlower edge of the forest, and there was Don Julian and a delegation of\r\nnatives waiting to convoy us back to Peque and welcome us home.\r\n\r\nDon Julian provided horses for our return to Buriticá. They were\r\nunquestionably the poorest animals I had ever seen, and I disliked\r\ngreatly to use them; but as no others were to be had it was a case\r\nof either taking the ones available or remaining in Peque for an\r\nindefinite period. However, they arrived safely in Buriticá after\r\ntwo days’ time, and having secured a new pack-train we started\r\nnorthwestward toward Atrato drainage.\r\n\r\nLeaving the little town and the semiarid country surrounding it, we\r\nproceeded straight to the top of a ridge eight thousand feet high,\r\nwhere a narrow strip of forest grew; and then descended on the other\r\nside into the valley of the Rio Canasgordas. At this point the stream\r\nis a mere rivulet, but it widens rapidly and the fertile banks are\r\nplanted in sugar-cane, maize, and bananas. Huts built of mud and\r\ngrass, half concealed by orange-trees dot the narrow valley; near them\r\nhalf-naked, dark-skinned children, pigs, and chickens ran about in a\r\ncare-free manner or stared at us as we passed.\r\n\r\nLower down the river is flanked by wide belts of tall bamboo. Birds\r\nwere not particularly abundant, but occasionally we caught sight of a\r\nyellow-rumped tanager as the bird darted through the foliage; or heard\r\nthe familiar _kis-ka-dee_ of a tyrant-bird perched on some high branch\r\nto sing, and to wait for insect victims to come within range of its\r\nsnapping, insatiable beak. We spent the first night in the town of\r\nCanasgordas, and the second in a dilapidated house known as Orobajo.\r\nThe family living here was in great distress owing to an epidemic of\r\nsome kind of virulent fever which had appeared in the district. There\r\nwas no food in the house, with the exception of a few beans, but after\r\nscouring the neighborhood our cook succeeded in purchasing a hen and a\r\ndozen _jarepas_ which we divided with the infirm family.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for supper we went on a tour of inspection over the\r\npremises and located a house-wren’s nest in the roof. It contained\r\none young bird, and the people told us that the other had been killed\r\nby falling to the ground. Later we found several other nests of this\r\nspecies, but in no instance were there more than two eggs or birds in\r\none nest. This fact is most interesting; in a temperate climate the\r\nhouse-wrens rear a large brood--eight being not an uncommon number of\r\nyoung; but near the equator two seemed to be the usual amount.\r\n\r\nBelow Orobajo the river is known as the Heradura. It flows past the\r\nvillage of Uramita, which was all but deserted. The fever that had\r\ninvaded Orobajo had also visited this place and more than half the\r\ninhabitants had died. A few men were engaged in pumping salt water from\r\nshallow wells which was led in bamboo pipes to a battery of low pans\r\nwhere boiling evaporated the water and left the salt. So far as we\r\ncould see there was no other industry in the town.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dabeiba on the Rio Sucio.]\r\n\r\nDabeiba, our first objective, was reached the third day after leaving\r\nBuriticá. As we gained the summit of the last ridge, a wonderful view\r\nlay before our eyes. The little town, composed of whitewashed houses\r\nwith red-tile roofs, glistened in a flat valley carpeted with the\r\nsoftest green. On one side a river, called the Rio Sucio, raged and\r\nfumed over a rock-encumbered bed; fields of cotton dotted its banks,\r\nthe snowy bolls and yellow blossoms almost obliterating the large\r\ngreen leaves. Forested hills enclosed the peaceful view as with a\r\nprotecting hand which would shield it from the terrors of the frigid\r\nAndes on one side, and the steaming Atrato lowlands on the other. In\r\nthis garden spot we decided to remain, but our arrival was nearly\r\nmarked by a tragedy. On account of the noonday heat I had tucked a\r\ntowel under my hat which, hanging down in the back provided, in a\r\nmeasure, protection from the hot sun. One of our _peons_, in a spirit\r\nof fun, told several small boys we chanced to meet that I was the\r\nbishop come to pay the town a visit; the urchins rushed into the road\r\nand prostrated themselves at my horse’s feet, imploring a benediction.\r\nFortunately the animal took fright at this unusual occurrence and\r\nbolted to one side before it could be restrained, narrowly avoiding\r\ntrampling the kneeling forms in its path.\r\n\r\nAt Dabeiba we made the acquaintance of a tribe of interesting\r\nIndians--the Cuñas. They lived in banana-leaf huts, scattered over\r\na wide area, but spent most of the time in town, looking into open\r\ndoorways, begging for rum, or standing in silent groups on the street\r\ncorners. They are a short, well-knit people of a dark-brown color.\r\nWhen in the forest they wear a breech-cloth only; but the priest has\r\nprovided them with large muslin sheets that they promptly dyed a\r\ndirty-brown hue with _achiote_ seeds, which they wear while in town.\r\nThey also wore heavy necklaces of silver coins, and bunches of weeds\r\ntied about the neck for charms. At first sight it appeared as if they\r\nhad no teeth, but further scrutiny revealed the fact that their dental\r\nequipment was perfect, though colored black from the juice of a fruit\r\nwhich they chew continuously. The body is liberally besmeared with\r\ngrease--especially before they enter the river to bathe, so that the\r\nwater rolls off as from a duck’s back. One of the men was entirely\r\ncovered with star-shaped marks of a deep-blue color which had been\r\nstamped on with a die made of wood. They spoke practically no Spanish,\r\nbut were a friendly lot and enjoyed being photographed.\r\n\r\nIn order to reach the best hunting-ground, it was necessary to go to\r\nthe other side of the river, but this was not difficult owing to the\r\nfact that a raft ferry was available. Birds were plentiful about the\r\noutskirts of the town, though of species common to open country and\r\neasy to observe in more accessible regions; we therefore spent the\r\ngreater part of our time in the forest.\r\n\r\nOne of our first and most interesting discoveries was a species of\r\npigmy motmot (_Hylomanes_). It is no larger than a sparrow and has\r\na very short tail in contrast to the long “pendulum” tails of the\r\nbetter-known varieties. This little blue-and-green bird lived in the\r\ndense vegetation on the steep slopes, and when several flocked together\r\nthey joined in a loud, cackling chorus at frequent intervals.\r\n\r\nThe cotton-fields sheltered a varied fauna. Hummingbirds came to the\r\nblossoms, and numbers of fat, red insects resembling potato-bugs lived\r\namong the drooping white fibre of the opened pods. Doves ran over the\r\nground, and small rodents had their burrows at the base of the thick\r\nstems.\r\n\r\nWhile at Dabeiba we met one of the most delightful Colombians--a type\r\nwhich I am afraid is vanishing, even as the forests and virgin wilds\r\ndisappear before the onslaughts of civilization. He had but recently\r\npenetrated farther into the wilderness, cleared a few acres of ground\r\nand erected a humble cabin of bamboo and wild banana leaves; to this\r\nhe urged us to come for as long a time as we should care to remain; so\r\none morning we gathered together the most essential articles of our\r\nequipment and tramped through the intervening eight miles of jungle\r\nto his home. The beauty of the forest is indescribable; and wild life\r\nwas so abundant that by the time our journey’s end was reached we\r\nhad attained such a stage of thrilling expectancy it was difficult\r\nto restrain our enthusiasm for the few hours needed to seek shelter\r\nindoors from an approaching storm. The shrill cries of parrots cleft\r\nthe air; trogons _cooed_ plaintively; toucans yelped and rattled; and\r\nfrom all sides came the _whush-whush-whush_ of giant orioles’ wings\r\nas the black-and-yellow forms hurried by to seek their pendent nests\r\nswaying dizzily from the branches of some giant ceiba towering regally\r\nabove the unbroken forest.\r\n\r\nWhile we waited for the storm to subside, the cook shelled corn and\r\nthen, placing it in a wooden mortar together with a handful of ashes,\r\nbegan to pound it to remove the skins. This operation required about\r\nhalf an hour, so frequently she paused to rest; but no sooner had\r\nshe deserted her post than a swarm of _cargador_ ants invaded the\r\nreceptacle, and the first intimation we had of their presence was when\r\na file of white kernels began to descend the side of the mortar and\r\ncross the floor at our feet. How the small insects are able to carry\r\nthe large, heavy grains is a mystery. The burden weighs many times as\r\nmuch as the ant which bears it, and almost hides it from view. Later,\r\nwe saw swarms of the same species at work in the clearing; they cut\r\nsections from the edges of corn leaves by digging one mandible into\r\nthe leaf for a secure hold, and then rip toward it with the other;\r\nthe cut is always circular. Most of the insects worked from right to\r\nleft, but one out of every five seemed to be “left-handed” and worked\r\nin the opposite direction. When the section of leaf is detached it is\r\ndexterously swung over the cutter’s back, and away it marches with the\r\ngreen banner waving aloft. In addition to carrying this load, several\r\nsmall ants often mount on the leaf for a free ride to the nest.\r\n\r\nThat night another denizen of the wilds invaded the house; as we\r\nsat quietly in front of the hut listening to a shrill, uncanny\r\n_oh-ho-ho-ho-ho_ coming from the forest, and which the natives said was\r\nthe mating call of the three-toed sloth, but which we recognized as\r\nthe song of a giant frogmouth or goatsucker, a cat owned by the family\r\nbegan to cut queer capers about the fireplace. A light revealed a\r\ngood-sized bushmaster making its way across the kitchen floor. Whether\r\nthe reptile had been attracted by the warm glow of the embers--for\r\nthe rain had been followed by a decided drop in temperature--or\r\nhad entered the structure to forage for mice, I do not know; but\r\nfortunately the cat had discovered its presence in time to prevent\r\nsome one from stepping on it, and was striking at it playfully with\r\nits paws. After that the cook slept on a bench instead of on the earth\r\nfloor, as had been her custom.\r\n\r\nOur daily excursions took us far into the forest which invested the\r\nlow, rounded hills in all directions. There were few trails, but a\r\nlack of undergrowth made walking easy. On one of our first hunting\r\nexpeditions we found the rare ground-cuckoo (_Neomorphus_), a beautiful\r\niridescent greenish-black bird which, on account of its terrestrial\r\nhabits, has nearly lost the power of flight. Once before, I had seen\r\nthis bird, and that was on the upper Orinoco, near the foot of Mount\r\nDuida. There the single individual was engaged in a curious game of tag\r\nwith a tinamou; the birds chased one another about on the leaf-strewn\r\nground, over logs, and through the underbrush, and jumped over one\r\nanother’s back as if playing leap-frog. We also found the flat-billed\r\nmotmot in considerable numbers. These birds usually clung to the lianas\r\ndrooping in festoons and loops above the small mountain brooks, and\r\nwere exceedingly stupid and unsuspicious. They uttered no note, and\r\nsat motionless many minutes at a time, silhouetted like dark, ragged\r\nspectres on their perches. Among the moss or green leaves their color\r\nblended well with the surroundings, and we doubtless passed numbers\r\nwithout being aware of their presence.\r\n\r\nNot all the birds inhabiting the forests at Alto Bonito are\r\ninconspicuously colored, however. There are gorgeous little tanagers,\r\nhumming-birds, toucans, and trogons. The latter, especially, are\r\ncreatures of such exquisite beauty that they seem to belong to a world\r\nmore ethereal than our own; their brilliant scarlet or yellow breasts\r\nresemble a flower of dazzling color, for which the shimmering, metallic\r\nwing-coverts and back provide a resplendent setting. The bird is as\r\nfragile as it is beautiful, and was evidently not intended to be\r\ndefiled by the touch of mortal hands. If a specimen is shot, many of\r\nthe feathers are lost before the bird reaches the ground, and at the\r\nimpact of the ground many more are shed. The skin is so delicate that\r\nit takes an expert to remove it, and even then the bird is the despair\r\nof field-naturalist and taxidermist alike.\r\n\r\nThere was also a splendid representation of the parrot family, ranging\r\nfrom noisy little parrakeets to huge, green amazons. This reminded\r\nme of an interesting provision of nature whereby three families of\r\nbirds frequently found in the same locality are able to obtain their\r\nsustenance. They are the parrots, trogons, and toucans, all of which\r\nfeed upon fruit, each seeming to secure its food in a different manner.\r\nThe zygodactyl feet of parrots enable them to _climb_ out to the tip\r\nof fruit-laden branches and to cling to them in any position while\r\nfeeding; toucans, endowed with an enormously elongated bill are able to\r\n_reach_ a long distance for a coveted morsel, which is grasped between\r\nthe tip of the mandibles and tossed back with an upward jerk of the\r\nhead, to be swallowed; a trogon has a very short beak and neck, and the\r\ndelicate feet are not adapted to climbing, but the wings of the bird\r\nare so constructed as to enable it to hover, from which position the\r\nfruit it desires may be snapped off the stem, when the bird returns to\r\nits perch to devour it.\r\n\r\nOne day our host’s son, aged thirteen, undertook to guide me to a\r\ndistant part of the forest, where he said a large herd of peccaries\r\nhad their feeding-ground. At first we passed through a part of the\r\ncountry well known to me, as I had taken a number of hunting excursions\r\nover the same ground; then we ascended a steep slope and, reaching the\r\ntop, began to explore a vast stretch of heavy woods but rarely visited\r\nby any one. Although we had come for the express purpose of hunting\r\npeccaries, there were so many rare prizes on all sides that it was\r\nimpossible to adhere strictly to our first intention; the temptation to\r\nadd new treasures to our collection proved too great. Dainty little\r\npigmy squirrels played in the top of the palms, or clung like lichens\r\nto the tree-trunks.\r\n\r\nSome of the trees bore ripe fruit, and to them many animals came which\r\nare hard or even impossible to find under other conditions, thus making\r\nan ideal spot for the naturalist. A few seeds of the alligator-pear\r\ncast away by a hunter years before had taken root and grown into\r\ngood-sized trees; the fruit dropped to the ground as it matured,\r\nattracting agoutis, which collected, apparently from some distance, to\r\nfeed on the rich morsels. Other trees were laden with small berries.\r\nAlthough there was no sound to indicate the presence of a living thing,\r\nwe usually discovered that first impressions were deceptive. If we\r\nwaited a short time, a gentle patter on the leaves at our feet rewarded\r\nour patience; and then a close scrutiny of the leafy vault revealed\r\nsilent, dark forms carefully moving among the tops of the branches and\r\nreaching out to pick the fruit upon which they were feeding. Gradually\r\nthe shadowy forms assumed the shape of toucans, parrots, or macaws; the\r\nlatter two birds are very wasteful and drop far more food than they eat.\r\n\r\nThe presence of an ant army is invariably advertised by the sharp\r\nchirp of the ant-wrens attending it. We encountered one, and spent an\r\nexciting half-hour securing two species of ant-birds, one black with\r\nwhite shoulders (_Myrmelastes_), and the other of a brown color with a\r\nwhite line running through the centre of the underparts (_Anoplops_);\r\nthey had been feeding on beetles and spiders, and examination of the\r\nstomach contents revealed also a few ants. After shooting a bird it was\r\nnecessary to enter into the thick of the voracious insects to hunt for\r\nit; but before the trophy could be recovered swarms of ants had climbed\r\nup our legs and clung with a bulldog grip.\r\n\r\nOccasionally we saw a flock of manakins--brilliant little sprites of\r\nthe forest, always found in the densest thickets. Some are black with\r\ngolden heads; others, also black, have yellow breasts and long tufts of\r\nfeathers on the throat, giving the bird a comical, bearded appearance;\r\na third species had a vivid scarlet crest. The males only are brightly\r\ncolored; the females are green.\r\n\r\nThere were signs of peccaries in abundance, but the constant shooting\r\nhad frightened them away; so after inspecting an ancient Indian tomb\r\nconsisting of a pile of carefully placed stones, overgrown with\r\ncreepers, we started for home. Instead of retracing our steps over the\r\nmany miles we had come, we followed a narrow gorge which we knew must\r\nlead to the Rio Sucio. Progress was slow and difficult, for the brook\r\ndescended in a series of falls, and the rocks were covered with moss\r\nand were slippery; however, having started _via_ this route, it was\r\nimpossible to retrace our steps.\r\n\r\nThere was little of interest along the course of the treacherous\r\nlittle stream; but we discovered nests of a barred black-and-white\r\nwren (_Thryophilus_) swinging gayly above the water. The basket-shaped\r\nstructures had been placed in the wildest, darkest spots, and each\r\ncontained a single young bird, dozing peacefully in the entrance\r\nopening, lulled to sleep, no doubt, by the semigloom and the sound of\r\nrushing water.\r\n\r\nAs we picked our way along slowly and painfully, frequently wading\r\nthrough water three feet deep, a dark, shadowy form lunged from the\r\nblackness of a cavern among the boulders and clung for an instant\r\nto the cuff of my hunting-coat; then it dropped to the ground, and\r\nslowly disappeared among the rocks. My companion, who was a few feet\r\nin advance, had just turned to make some comment, and it was not until\r\nhis frantic shriek brought me back to earth that I fully realized what\r\nhad occurred. A bushmaster, apparently four or five feet long had\r\nbecome exasperated at our close proximity, and aimed a deadly thrust\r\nat the disturber of its diurnal slumber. This habit of the snake is\r\nwell known; by nature it is sluggish; one person may pass close by\r\nwithout arousing its anger, while to a second individual, immediately\r\nfollowing, it will show resentment, although it may not strike; but a\r\nthird may consider himself fortunate, indeed, if he does not draw the\r\nfull measure of the reptile’s fury.\r\n\r\nThe exploration at Alto Bonito yielded such rich returns that we\r\nregretted the necessity of leaving; but a field-naturalist’s time is\r\nnot unlimited, and presently we found ourselves riding across the\r\nparched Antioquian desert, _en route_ to Medellin.\r\n\r\nThe work at Alto Bonito provided the last link in the chain of facts\r\nregarding the forestation of northwestern Antioquia, and also throws\r\nsome light on the extension of the mountain ranges. For information on\r\nthe latter subject we were compelled to rely largely on data furnished\r\nby Señor Cspinas, director of the School of Mines, Medellin; Señor\r\nErnesto White, an engineer who has made surveys in the region, and the\r\nreports of Indians.\r\n\r\nThe Western Cordillera terminates in the Cerro Aguila, just below 9°,\r\nnear the Golfo de Urubá, and is less than one thousand feet high. The\r\nrange breaks down, gradually, north of the Paramillo. In latitude 7½°\r\nthe highest peak is known as Alto Esmeralda, four thousand feet high;\r\nand the Abibi, a few miles farther north, reaches an altitude of only\r\nthree thousand six hundred feet.\r\n\r\nA trail recently built (by Señor White) from Turbo on the Gulf of Urubá\r\nto Montana on the Rio Sinú crosses the very country about which we knew\r\nleast; the elevation of its highest point is eight hundred feet, and\r\nevery mile of the way was cut through heavy virgin forest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_PART II_\r\n\r\nVENEZUELA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nFIFTEEN HUNDRED MILES ON THE ORINOCO\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if the declining sun had set the quivering world aflame;\r\nall day long the _Delta_, well remembered but unbeloved by voyagers\r\non the Master River, had struggled on against the yellow flood toward\r\nher goal two hundred and forty miles above the Parian Gulf. Not a\r\nripple stirred the placid water which glided ever onward, and no breeze\r\nstirred the heavy, dark vegetation that lined the river’s bank. It had\r\nbeen one of those days which only the traveller to tropical lands can\r\nadequately picture; when all the earth silently droops beneath the\r\nunrelenting glare of the lurid orb overhead, and eagerly awaits the\r\ncoming of night which alone can bring relief.\r\n\r\nAs the last vestige of the sullen disk dipped into the forest, and only\r\na faint pink and violet glow lit up the banks of vapors hanging low in\r\nthe west, the nightly gales from the ocean sprang up with unrestrained\r\nvigor; soon a choppy sea was raging, and as each white-capped wave\r\nstruck her wooden sides with a muffled boom, the fragile, top-heavy\r\nsteamer shuddered and threatened to capsize. Morning, however, found\r\nher still battling bravely with the somewhat subsided elements, and,\r\nnot long after, the _Delta_ was slowly dragging herself alongside the\r\nhigh, sandy beach on which stands Ciudad Bolivar.\r\n\r\nThe first white man to ascend the Orinoco was Ordaz, who in 1531–2 went\r\nas far as the mouth of the Meta; and after him came the usual bands of\r\ntreasure-seekers in quest of El Dorado; but instead of wonderful golden\r\ncities they found yawning graves in a hostile wilderness.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the eighteenth century missions, founded by the\r\nJesuit fathers, dotted the river-bank as far up as Esmeraldas; these\r\nhave long since vanished. Humboldt made his memorable voyage to the\r\nCassiquiare in 1800, and a number of other scientific expeditions\r\nfollowed in his wake at irregular intervals; to enumerate them all\r\nwould be a tedious and unwarranted use of time. However, one remarkable\r\nfact must not be overlooked, namely, that even to this day the actual\r\nsources of the Orinoco have not been discovered.\r\n\r\nTo trace this huge artery to its very beginning, supposedly somewhere\r\nin the Serrania de Parima on the Brazilian frontier was not the object\r\nof our expedition; but rather to explore the regions north of the\r\ninaccurately mapped Rio Cunucunuma, more particularly Mount Duida,\r\nthought by many to be the locality described in a widely read book\r\nentitled “The Lost World.” Of this country, and of the people and\r\nanimal life inhabiting its virgin wilds, very little was known.\r\n\r\nWith the tying up of the _Delta_ the first stage of our journey had\r\nbeen completed.\r\n\r\nCiudad Bolivar, formerly called Angostura, meaning narrows, on account\r\nof the narrowing of the Orinoco at this point to the width of a mile,\r\nstands on an eminence on the left bank, and is the capital of the\r\nDepartment of Guiana; it is the largest and only city of importance on\r\nthe river. The red-tiled roofs and whitewashed walls of the houses can\r\nbe seen from afar. On landing, one is confronted by a strange medley\r\nof low, thick-walled edifices; narrow, crooked streets, and swarthy,\r\nunkempt people. Practically all of the windows are heavily barred, a\r\ncustom common in many parts of South America, and retained from the\r\nMoors.\r\n\r\nWhatever beauty attached to the place is indoors. There are no green\r\nlawns or flowering gardens to cheer the eye of the passer-by; but a\r\nglimpse behind the sombre walls will invariably reveal an open court or\r\n_patio_ filled with flowers and tropical shrubbery, and occasionally\r\na fountain; but this is not all. In the _patio_ of the hotel, which\r\nserved as our headquarters, there lived in perfect harmony several\r\nlarge tortoises, a deer, two sheep, about a dozen tree-ducks, turkeys,\r\nchickens, guinea-fowl, and several pigs; fifteen species of birds,\r\nincluding parrots, orioles, and finches occupied cages hanging on the\r\nwalls. The desire to keep caged animals is an inherent trait of the\r\nSouth American. Back of the city lies an extensive swamp from which, at\r\nleast during the month of December, came great numbers of mosquitoes.\r\nAs may have been inferred, the heat was very great; but regularly at\r\nnightfall the strong wind came up the river, causing a drop of several\r\ndegrees in the temperature; then the town cast off its torpor, lights\r\ntwinkled, the band played on the water-front, gayly dressed and painted\r\nwomen peered from behind the heavily barred windows, the streets\r\nwere filled with a roving crowd of men and boys, and Ciudad Bolivar\r\npresented a wide-awake appearance.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of the Orinoco is the small town of Soledad; this\r\nvillage supplies a large portion of the sailors who man the boats\r\nplying on the river.\r\n\r\nOur first care was to try to find a way of proceeding on our voyage.\r\nOn account of the low stage of the water from the months of January\r\nto March, steamers do not ascend beyond Ciudad Bolivar regularly,\r\nand at best they go only as far as the Apure. It was, therefore,\r\ndecided to charter a sailboat of shallow draft which would take us\r\nto the first great barrier to navigation, the cataracts of Atures.\r\nTo secure such a craft was not an easy matter. We visited several of\r\nthe large export houses, mostly German, but none of them had vessels\r\nat their disposal. Finally, we heard of a man named Guillermo Montez;\r\nhe was a type frequently met with in South America; owning a small\r\nstore which contained chiefly long ropes of garlic festooned on the\r\nwalls, living in a mud hovel, and apparently poverty-stricken, he\r\nnevertheless possessed great wealth and knew how to handle his fellow\r\ncountrymen. This “handling” consisted of keeping them constantly in\r\ndebt to himself, so that he owned them virtually body and soul. Montez\r\nimmediately sent to Soledad for one of his debtors, and within a short\r\ntime we had secured the contract for the transportation needed.\r\n\r\nOn December 16 word reached us that the boat was ready. We had spent\r\nthe intervening days adding to the stock of provisions brought from New\r\nYork, and it might be added that the shops of Ciudad Bolivar were well\r\nfilled with a splendid assortment of foodstuffs at reasonable prices.\r\n\r\nThe _Hilo de Oro_ (_Thread of Gold_), for that was the name of the\r\nsloop impatiently bobbing near the bank, was a boat capable of\r\ncarrying one hundred and fifty _quintales_, under the command of\r\none Pedro Solano; her crew consisted of four men, and the captain’s\r\nwife, whose position was that of cook. To properly load the equipment\r\nand provisions required half a day, and with the springing up of\r\nthe evening wind we hoisted sail and, skirting the towering rocks\r\nprotruding from the centre of the river, glided easily to the other\r\nside. As all the men came from Soledad, there followed a night of the\r\nusual festivities of drinking and leave-taking; but with the rising\r\nsun, the wind still holding out, we started on the real voyage up the\r\ngreat river.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the wind was favorable and continued to blow\r\nintermittently all day long; by ten o’clock at night we had covered\r\nabout thirty miles and cast anchor at a point called _Boca la Brea_.\r\nThe width of the river averaged about one mile and a half, and the\r\nentire bed is strewn with huge boulders, rendering navigation at night\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nNext day, a favorable wind did not reach us until late in the\r\nmorning, and we had our first glimpse of wild life. The crew, a\r\npiratical-appearing band with unshaven faces, wearing short breeches\r\nonly, and red and blue handkerchiefs around their heads, landed a\r\nnumber of large striped catfish; but their tackle was too light and\r\nothers of greater weight broke the lines and escaped. Numbers of\r\n_caimans_, or crocodiles, floated lazily down-stream with only the\r\neyes and saw-like tails showing above the water; and a school of\r\nfresh-water porpoises jumped and raced around the boat.\r\n\r\nOn the days that followed, the wind either died down entirely or\r\nblew with terrific violence, so that slow progress was made. The\r\n_chubascos_, or squalls, not uncommon on tropical rivers, come up\r\nsuddenly and without warning; a faint, funnel-shaped mass appears on\r\nthe horizon, followed by a low bank of black clouds, and fitful little\r\nsandspouts that spring into existence on the vast _playas_. There is\r\nnever time to seek the leeward banks, and not a minute is lost in\r\nlowering sails and placing every available object below to prevent its\r\nbeing washed overboard. While Captain Solano shouted hoarse orders\r\nand the crew worked like mad (the only time they really did work), we\r\ndonned our oilskins and awaited the coming of the storm. To go down\r\ninto the hatch was impossible, both on account of the lack of space\r\nand the stifling heat. The wait was never very long; with a roar the\r\nhurricane burst upon the quiet river, and in a few minutes everything\r\nwas obliterated in the dense fog and wall of falling water. The wind\r\ntore through the rigging with agonized wails, and angry white-capped\r\nwaves sprang suddenly into existence, sweeping over the boat and\r\ndashing it about like a cork in a millrace. There was nothing to be\r\ndone but wait until the storm subsided and hope that no obstructing\r\nboulder, or the bank, would put an end to the madly careening craft in\r\nthe semidarkness. This lasted from fifteen minutes to an hour; then the\r\nwind died down, the rain ceased, and the fog lifted. A changed river\r\npresented itself. Monstrous waves, capped with foam, dashed and tore\r\nat the high, crumbling banks, undermining them so that large sections\r\ntumbled into the water, carrying with them tall trees and massed\r\nvegetation. The agitated surface was littered with _débris_ which bore\r\ngood evidence of the violence of the storm.\r\n\r\nAfter this there followed several days of calm; there was not enough\r\nwind to fill the sails, and all the “whistling for a breeze” of the\r\nsailors did exactly as much good as one would expect it to. Finally,\r\nin desperation, a long rope was tied to the mast, and two men going\r\nahead in a canoe made the other end fast to a tree, a few hundred feet\r\nahead. The remaining members of the crew then hauled on the rope,\r\nslowly drawing the boat forward. Progress was slow, of course, but\r\non the 22d we reached the _Puerto del Infierno_, the best possible\r\nname for the narrow, rocky gorge through which the river rushes with\r\nuncontrolled fury. A large mass of granite covered with low vegetation\r\ndivides the river into two narrow channels, one of them so protected\r\nby high, rocky banks that no wind ever reaches the water, consequently\r\nmaking it impossible for boats to sail up the passage. The other is a\r\nnarrow, rock-strewn gorge, down which the water thunders in a series\r\nof cascades. On the right bank, perched high on the rocks, are a few\r\nmud huts called _Pueblo de las Piedras_. We spent the greater part of a\r\nday waiting for wind, and then made straight for the seething passage.\r\nFortunately our pilot was a good one; his method was to steer directly\r\nfor some great boulder, below which the water was quiet, and just as\r\nthe ship seemed about to strike he swung the tiller, and the boat\r\npainfully nosed her way up the cataract that dashed down the sides of\r\nthe rock. If the breeze slackened for a moment the ship drifted back\r\nwith the strong current, which was extremely dangerous, as there was no\r\nway of regulating her course; but always, just in the nick of time, the\r\nsails filled and after an hour’s struggle we left the rapids and sailed\r\ninto the quiet water above.\r\n\r\nNot far above the _Infierno_ is the village of Mapire, a neat\r\ncollection of perhaps fifty huts on a high bluff overlooking the river.\r\nIn back of the town are vast _llanos_, or grassy plains, which are\r\ncapable of supporting numerous herds of cattle. On the opposite side\r\nof the river, and some little distance up, is the mouth of the Caura,\r\nat one time believed to be the home of a tribe of headless people; but\r\nthe old superstition has been overthrown, and during the first month of\r\neach year many adventurous parties ascend the river for a considerable\r\ndistance in search of the _serrapia_ or tonca-bean. The tree (_Dipteryx\r\nodorata_) upon which the fruit grows resembles a mango, with spreading\r\nbranches and deep-green, dense leaves. The fruit also is very similar\r\nto the mango, though green, with tough, fibrous flesh and a large seed.\r\nWhile the fruit is still green great quantities of it are destroyed by\r\nmacaws and parrots, which take a bite or two, then drop the rest on the\r\nground. Upon ripening, the fruit falls, when it is gathered into heaps\r\nand dried; the seeds are later cracked open and the strong-smelling\r\nkernel extracted to be carefully preserved and sent to Ciudad Bolivar,\r\nwhere it is treated in casks of rum and then exported. It is used in\r\nmaking perfumes and flavoring extracts.\r\n\r\nThe water of the Caura is of a clear dark-red color, and for a great\r\ndistance after entering the Orinoco the two waters flow side by side\r\nwithout mingling in the slightest degree.\r\n\r\nThe Orinoco widens into a majestic stream above this point, and we\r\nestimated that the distance from bank to bank must in some places be\r\nfrom three to five miles; also, vast sand-banks stretch along both\r\nsides for a distance of many miles.\r\n\r\nCaicara, the only town of importance on the Orinoco besides Ciudad\r\nBolivar, consisted at the time of our visit of about one hundred and\r\nfifty houses, but on account of a rubber and _serrapia_ boom on the\r\nCuchivero many of the inhabitants were leaving for the latter place.\r\nThe next day we passed the mouth of the Apure, and just beyond the\r\nmouth of the Arichuma; a great low, sandy island rises out of the\r\ncentre of the Orinoco at this point, on which thousands of terns,\r\nskimmers, gulls, and other water-fowl were apparently nesting. All day\r\nlong and even at night the air was filled with darting, screaming birds\r\nthat made such a terrific din that it was impossible to sleep. High\r\nwaves prevented our landing on the island, but the natives visit it\r\nregularly, taking away canoe-loads of eggs; for this reason the island\r\nhas been named _Playa de Manteca_, meaning in this case land of plenty.\r\n\r\nThe next settlement is called Urbana, and is on the south bank of\r\nthe river, almost opposite the mouth of the Arauca. It consists of\r\nabout a score of hovels. The Arauca is a river of considerable size,\r\nand is said to be bordered by vast marshes and swamps, the home of\r\ncountless egrets and other water-birds. Hunting-parties ascend during\r\nthe nesting-season and kill great numbers of the birds; the plumes are\r\ntaken to Ciudad Bolivar and disposed of to the export dealers.\r\n\r\nLeaving Urbana on the 29th, we entered one of the most difficult\r\nstretches of the river to navigate. The fish-hook bend of the Orinoco\r\nturns southward, and the eastern bank is dotted with a range of\r\nlow granite hills which are, in fact, a chain of giant, blackened,\r\ndome-shaped boulders. The wind from the east, roaring through each\r\ncleft and opening, strikes the river from several directions and with\r\ncyclonic violence. One moment there is scarcely enough to make headway\r\nagainst the current; the next a gust strikes the sails and sends the\r\nship wallowing on her beam until the boom drags in the water and it is\r\nan even bet if she will gradually right herself or go over. At such\r\ntimes of peril as well as on starting each morning it is the custom of\r\nthe sailors to pray. Of course they were all Catholics. The captain or\r\nwhoever steers said, “_Vamos con Dios_” (let us go with God), and the\r\nothers answered in chorus: “_Y con la Virgen_” (and with the Virgin).\r\nOccasionally the person whose duty it was to lead was so occupied\r\nrolling a cigarette or slapping at flies that he neglected his duty;\r\nthen some one was sure to remind him with a sarcastic “_Aha! Hoy\r\nvamos como los Protestantes_” (Aha! To-day we are starting like the\r\nProtestants). It often happened that the crew was remiss. The captain\r\nrepeated his lead several times without being heard; finally, his\r\npatience exhausted, he shouted at the top of his voice, “_Vamos con\r\nDios, caramba_,” and the crew immediately yelled back at the top of\r\ntheir voices: “_Y con la Virgen, caramba_.”\r\n\r\nAdded to the danger of the shifting gales is a rapids named San\r\nJorge. There was just enough water to cover the rocks which dot the\r\nriver-bed, causing a series of cross-currents and whirlpools which\r\nonly a Venezuelan boatman, trusting mainly to luck, can hope to pass\r\nthrough. The rigging of the _Hilo de Oro_ was old and rotten, and ropes\r\nwere constantly snapping and sails splitting. No matter how obvious a\r\ndefect was, it was never remedied until an accident had occurred. The\r\nboom had been threatening to break as each sudden gust of wind struck\r\nthe mainsail, but a few boards nailed across the weakened place it\r\nwas hoped would give sufficient strength for any emergency. An hour\r\nafter leaving San Jorge, however, the boom parted with a loud report\r\nand dropped into the water, nearly upsetting the boat. Then, while the\r\ncraft wallowed on her side with the deck awash there ensued a good deal\r\nof mingled praying, swearing, and frantic work until the heavy boom was\r\nfished out of the water. We tied up at the bank, cut down a tree, and\r\nworked the greater part of the night replacing the broken member.\r\n\r\nOne of the curious granite battlements rears its head out of the\r\nwater to a height of several hundred feet, and is somewhat suggestive\r\nof a small edition of the famous Sugar-Loaf Rock at the entrance to\r\nthe harbor of Rio de Janeiro. This is called Treasure Rock, and no\r\nVenezuelan ever passes the spot without casting envious glances to the\r\ntop. In the days when the old Spaniards were still wandering over the\r\nnewly discovered lands in search of El Dorado, so the story goes, they\r\npenetrated far into the Cerro Sipapo and found rich treasures in gold\r\nand precious stones. The Guajibo Indians, in whose domain they had\r\npenetrated and whom they had robbed, finally tired of their unwelcome\r\nguests and chased them down the river. In desperation the Spaniards\r\nformed a stronghold on this island rock, driving iron spikes into its\r\nsides as a means of reaching the top; for many weeks they resisted a\r\nsiege by the savage hordes, but with the coming of the rainy season the\r\nIndians withdrew to their mountain fastness. Finally the Spaniards\r\ncame down, cutting off the spikes as they descended; they feared\r\npursuit, so left the treasure on the rock, hoping to come for it when\r\nreinforcements had been secured; they never returned, and to this day\r\nthe fabulous wealth of the Guajibos lies entombed on the top of the\r\nimpregnable boulder.\r\n\r\nThe Meta is a mighty river coming from the immense prairie region of\r\neastern Colombia. It is navigable for the greater part of its course,\r\nand should be the means of opening up illimitable grazing areas when\r\nthe Orinoco is thrown open to free navigation. Where the Meta joins the\r\nOrinoco, the latter is fully two miles wide; near its mouth the country\r\nis covered with a dense scrub growth. As we neared the mouth of the\r\ngreat river several large canoes filled with Indians, of the Guajibo\r\ntribe, shot from an invisible hiding-place near the bank and made for\r\nthe centre of the stream. They have an unsavory reputation among the\r\nriver-men, and Captain Solano added little gayety to the occasion when\r\nhe prophesied an attack and armed his men. On they came, swiftly and\r\nsilently, the dusky, naked bodies bending in perfect unison, and the\r\ngreat muscles of the arms and shoulders rippling in the sunlight as\r\nthey drove the short, pointed paddles deep into the water with vigorous\r\nstrokes; but our suspicions proved to be unfounded. They passed rapidly\r\non some secret mission of their own without even condescending to\r\nglance in our direction. This utter indifference to strangers, I found\r\nlater, is a characteristic common to all Indians of the Upper Orinoco.\r\nA man might be drowning or stranded on a rock, but they would pass him\r\nquietly in their canoes without apparently seeing him; they would pay\r\nnot the slightest attention to his cries for help. Their ill treatment\r\nat the hands of strangers has been so great that they have lost all\r\nconfidence in any one unknown to them, and so they retaliate by\r\nfeigning indifference to him, even in his direst need.\r\n\r\nThe nights were usually spent aboard ship. If there was no wind it\r\nwas safe to tie up to some tree; or if darkness overtook us near a\r\nplaya the anchor was carried ashore and buried in the sand. While the\r\ncook prepared supper on the brazier or over a fire built on the bank,\r\nhammocks were strung in the rigging, and then we fished until time to\r\nretire.\r\n\r\nFish were always abundant and of many varieties. One kind that\r\nwas taken frequently and that was excellent eating was a catfish,\r\nweighing up to twenty-eight pounds, of a deep brownish color with\r\nwavy bluish-gray lines running along its sides, called _vagre tigre_;\r\nanother species of catfish, frequently of a weight of seventy-five\r\npounds or more, and of a deep slate color, was not uncommon; there was\r\nalso a third about eighteen inches long, with a large, narrow head and\r\n“feelers” as long as the body, that was always sure to be among the\r\ncatch; but neither of the two last named was ever eaten, as the flesh\r\nwas said to be poisonous. The crew was always careful to clean all\r\nfish immediately and place them under cover; if left exposed to the\r\nmoonlight overnight they were unfit for food.\r\n\r\nThe hoarse cough of jaguars was heard almost nightly; it was the season\r\nwhen great numbers of turtles left the river at nightfall to deposit\r\ntheir eggs in the sand-banks, and the jaguars left the forest at dark\r\nto dig up and feed on these eggs. One night, just as the boat had\r\ndrawn up to the high sand-bank preparatory to tying up, one of the\r\nhuge cats was discovered sitting ten feet above us quietly surveying\r\nthe scene on deck; there was a rush for the guns, but when they were\r\nsecured the jaguar had disappeared. A clear sweep of loose sand with\r\na low bush here and there stretched back a mile from the river to the\r\nheavy forest, and in the brilliant moonlight it was easy to trace the\r\nanimal’s tracks as it started toward cover. Several times its shadowy\r\nform was visible, slinking from one bush to another a few rods away,\r\nbut always out of range; after half an hour the tracks were lost in\r\nthe edge of the forest. We returned to the ship. Before replacing the\r\nguns in the hatch some one casually broke his, which action led to the\r\ndiscovery that it contained no shells; neither were the others loaded.\r\nOne of the men while cleaning them that afternoon had removed the\r\ncartridges and failed to reload them. Fortunately, the jaguar is not\r\nquite as savage as he is usually pictured, or there might have been a\r\nlively scene on the _playa_.\r\n\r\nThere is but one other rapid of importance in the Orinoco before\r\nreaching the cataracts of Atures, and that is San Borja, not far above\r\nthe mouth of the Meta. Just above this narrow stretch of seething\r\nwater we met another boat about the size of the _Hilo de Oro_, which\r\nwas cruising back and forth near the bank, her crew directing loud\r\nshouts toward the forest at frequent intervals. Upon inquiry we found\r\nthat one of the men had gone into the woods to cut a pole; the other\r\nmembers of the crew had heard him chopping, as he had not entered the\r\nmatted vegetation more than fifty feet; suddenly the chopping ceased,\r\nbut the man did not come out; although they had searched far and near,\r\nno trace of him had been found, and this was the fourth day after his\r\ndisappearance. The supposition was that he had been killed and carried\r\naway by Indians.\r\n\r\nPerrico was formerly the port of call for sailing craft below Atures.\r\nAt the time of our arrival there was nothing whatever there, not even\r\na single hut. We continued up the river half a mile to a place called\r\nVagre; here we found the remains of two palm-leaf huts, long since\r\nfallen down and overgrown with vegetation. In the small clearing a few\r\ncotton-stalks, beans, pawpaws, and castor-bean bushes still struggled\r\nfor existence with the invading hosts of creepers and second-growth\r\nsprouts; the forest was rapidly reclaiming its own. On the sandy\r\nriver-bank were the tracks of jaguars and caimans. At this point the\r\nriver is divided into a number of branches by islands, and the one on\r\nwhich Vagre was situated is not over five hundred feet wide. Beyond\r\nthis point a boat of any size cannot proceed; it is the foot of the\r\nseries of cataracts, six miles long, known as the rapids of Atures. We\r\nsent a man overland to Zamuro for a _falca_, which is a canoe with the\r\nsides heightened with boards; and while our luggage was being rowed up\r\nthe swift stream, we walked near the bank.\r\n\r\nThe aneroid, read at water-level, gave an elevation of three hundred\r\nand fifty feet; perhaps this is somewhat too high. Between Vagre and\r\nZamuro a row of rounded, black rocks rise to a height of two hundred\r\nand fifty feet above the river, on the eastern side. Many boulders of\r\nenormous proportions lie sprinkled about in the most irregular manner,\r\nas far as we could see, and in spots there are outcroppings of ledges\r\nof quartz. The tops of the rounded granite hills are hard and glazed,\r\nso that they glisten in the sunlight as if covered with a coating\r\nof ice. There are but a few stunted trees, and where any vegetation\r\ncan get a foothold tough, wiry grass grows; this is the home of many\r\nrabbits and rattlesnakes.\r\n\r\nZamuro we found to consist of three grass huts newly built and occupied\r\nby sick, miserable Venezuelan families. The heat is terrific, and\r\nmosquitoes and sand-flies first begin to make their presence known\r\nin considerable numbers. The river scenery is really magnificent;\r\nhuge boulders of fantastic shape strew the river-bed, and rear their\r\nheads high above the seething torrent; against them the water dashes\r\nceaselessly, surging and swirling in mad endeavors to destroy them,\r\nonly to be baffled by the immovable sentinels and hurled back again to\r\ncollide with their brethren equally unrelenting and equally impervious\r\nto the roaring onslaught. The scene is awe-inspiring.\r\n\r\nThe next step was to secure ox-carts to carry the _impedimenta_ to the\r\nRio Catañapo, three miles away, and this we crossed in a canoe, landing\r\npractically at Atures. The governor of the Upper Orinoco, General\r\nRoberto Pulido, made Catañapo his home. He was ordinarily supposed to\r\nreside in San Fernando de Atabapo, but on account of his arbitrary\r\nmethods of government he was so greatly disliked that he decided it was\r\n“healthier” to live elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe Catañapo is a turbulent stream of clear, cold water that dashes\r\ndown from the near-by Cerro Sipapo. Not far above its mouth is a\r\ngood-sized village of Piaroas, who come down occasionally with\r\nplantains, pawpaws, and other fruits which they exchange for cloth and\r\nsugar at Atures. When the Indians come down they apparently bring with\r\nthem numbers of freshly killed monkeys, the flesh of which is greatly\r\nesteemed as food. We saw several heaps of the charred bones near\r\nfrequently used camping-sites, here as well as at Zamuro.\r\n\r\nThe clear water of the Catañapo abounds in fish which may be seen\r\ntwenty-five feet or more beneath the surface. Some were fully two feet\r\nlong and resembled giant black bass; they refused to be tempted with\r\nmeat bait, but rushed greedily for bright-colored objects such as fruit\r\nand flowers; they would take half an orange at a gulp.\r\n\r\nAtures, consisting of six or eight mud and grass huts, owes its\r\nexistence to the fact that the governor lives on the Catañapo and\r\nall the residents are his employees. Formerly the town was larger\r\nand there were thirty ox-carts plying back and forth across the\r\nportage; but the governor promptly selected the few he wanted and then\r\ndiscouraged competition in such a manner that he was shortly left alone\r\nin the field. To us he was most cordial, and immediately placed his\r\ncarts at our disposal; nor did he examine our luggage, which was his\r\nself-imposed duty, and extract anything that suited his fancy.\r\n\r\nThe two miles from Atures to Salvajito, the port of embarkation above\r\nAtures Rapids, were covered in ox-carts which lumbered slowly along\r\nover the uneven semiarid country. Salvajito was only a small cleared\r\nspace in the forest fringing the river.\r\n\r\nThe next step of the journey was to traverse the forty miles of river\r\nbetween Atures and the second great cataract at Maipures. Only a small\r\ncanoe was available, so leaving my assistant and a number of the men\r\nto guard the left-over luggage, I started with three paddlers. The\r\ncanoe was only eighteen feet long, with about two inches of freeboard,\r\nbut fortune favored us and after two days we reached the mouth of\r\nthe Tuparo. The first night out had been spent on a _laja_, or shelf\r\nof rock which extends over the water; the men set the dry vegetation\r\nin back of the camp afire in order to keep away jaguars, and built\r\na fence of brands along the outer edge of the rock to frighten off\r\nthe crocodiles. The second night was spent on a large sand-bank just\r\nbelow the rapid of Guajibo. In approaching this site the canoe had\r\nbeen caught in a sudden hurricane and swamped before land could be\r\nreached; but fortunately we had gained shallow water, so nothing was\r\nlost. On this sand-bar lived three species of terns, one of very small\r\nsize that came in immense flocks after nightfall and, dropping on the\r\nsand, immediately disappeared from view; also numbers of yellow-legs\r\nand a few gulls. The wind blew steadily all night, so that by morning\r\neverything and every one was half buried in the loose sand.\r\n\r\nThe rapid of Guajibo is one of the most treacherous in the whole\r\nOrinoco. Each year the rubber-gatherers pay heavy toll in lives while\r\ntraversing this notorious spot. A great horseshoe-shaped ledge of\r\nrock extends across practically the entire river, and over this the\r\nwater rushes at great speed; below is a series of scattered rocks\r\nextending for a quarter of a mile, and forming a raging, roaring gorge.\r\nWe portaged around the spot, although the country is very difficult,\r\nowing to the many high rocks and the deep crevices between them. An\r\nacquaintance who had just passed attempted to have his men drag their\r\nboat through, with the result that they lost the canoe and three men.\r\nShortly after a large _piragua_ coming from up-river attempted to run\r\nthe rapids to save time; seven of the crew, as well as the owner of the\r\noutfit, paid for their folly with their lives, and the entire cargo\r\nof rubber, together with the boat, was lost. A few days later another\r\nparty wrecked their canoe and lost two men. These are all cases which\r\ncame under our notice, and I was told of many others.\r\n\r\nThe port of Maipures is on the Rio Tuparo, about half a mile above its\r\nmouth. This river, some two hundred yards wide, comes rushing out of\r\nthe interior of Colombia down a rocky river-bed. Where the landing was\r\neffected we found only the parched plain, a trail leading away from\r\nthe river to the settlement of Maipures, a good three miles away. We\r\npitched camp near the water, and the canoe and two men were immediately\r\nsent back for another load of the equipment. There was not much life\r\nalong this part of the river. Numerous iguanas spent the hot hours\r\nburrowing in the sand, and if disturbed either ran away in the brush\r\nor plunged into the water. Both green and blue kingfishers clattered\r\nnoisily on the opposite side, and a few large gray herons flapped up\r\nand down over the centre of the stream. We could constantly hear the\r\nloud roar of the Maipures Rapids, and the water rushing down the course\r\nof the main river was covered with foam.\r\n\r\nFive days after our arrival the second load, in charge of my assistant,\r\narrived. They had met with a mishap in the rapid of Guajibo, and\r\none man and the canoe were lost. For nearly two days they had been\r\nstranded on an island and besieged by a party of Indians from the\r\nSipapo; the occupants of a passing canoe, seeing their plight, came\r\nto the rescue, and brought them on to the Tuparo. While the borrowed\r\ncanoe returned for the remaining members of the party, we busied\r\nourselves transferring camp to Maipures, above the head of the rapids.\r\nThe intervening country is level and covered with a sparse growth of\r\nclumps of wiry grass and patches of low woods; near the watercourse the\r\ntrees are taller and the vegetation more dense. The town, consisting\r\nof six adobe houses with thatched roofs, nestles in a little grove of\r\nmango and tonca-bean trees, and from a short distance away is very\r\npicturesque; but like all the rest of the plain it is insufferably hot\r\nand the myriads of sand-flies quivering like heat-waves in the air make\r\nlife almost unbearable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The village of Maipures.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The _Hilo de Oro_ at the end of the voyage.]\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for a boat of ample size to take us up the river to\r\nSan Fernando de Atabapo, we had time to explore the surrounding country\r\nand to visit the rapids, three in number, which obstruct the river. The\r\nwoods are wonderful beyond description; most of the trees are gnarled\r\nand low, as if grown under the guiding hand of a skilful Japanese\r\ngardener, and have the appearance of being hundreds of years old.\r\nStunted spiny palms rear their crowns here and there, and an occasional\r\ntangle of red-flowered creepers forms an umbrella-like mass on the\r\ntip of some slender, dead stub. The ground is sprinkled with rocks of\r\nfantastic shapes, and some are of enormous size, rising in needle-like,\r\nfluted columns, or as the crumbling tiers of massive walls amid the\r\ncuriously distorted vegetation. Along the river are other masses of\r\nrock, but of an entirely different formation; we saw caves and grottos,\r\nand ledges honeycombed with hundreds of pot-holes exposed by the low\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nBeyond the woods are large areas of cacti, pineapples, and low, thorny\r\nbushes, springing from crevices in the granite ledges. Bird life is\r\nabundant and varied. Quail and red-breasted meadow-larks occupy the\r\nopen country, as well as a species of the much-sought tinamou; but\r\na bird that proved to be the most interesting was a small, obscure\r\nindividual called nunlet or swallow-wing. All day long the little\r\ncreature, about the size of a king-bird, black above and gray below,\r\nwith a saffron band across the throat, sits on the top of some dead\r\ntree, seemingly asleep; but let a fly or an insect of almost any kind\r\npass along and the bird immediately becomes charged with activity and\r\ndarts into the air in hot pursuit, catches its victim, and returns\r\nto its perch with graceful flits of the wings. It remains on the\r\nsame twigs for hours, and usually returns day after day. If a stick\r\nis thrown at it the little creature flies away and comes back again\r\nand again. But stupid as the bird appears to be, it is nevertheless\r\na skilful architect. I have seen them dig perfectly round holes deep\r\ninto a bank of sand so loose that the whole mass would crumble at my\r\ntouch; while one bird digs with much scratching and working of wings,\r\nthe mate sits on a branch near by and gives a twitter of alarm upon\r\nthe approach of danger. Some members of the family build a huge pile\r\nof twigs on the entrance to their burrow to hide it. At the end of the\r\ntunnel, a foot or two back, the snow-white eggs are laid upon a thin\r\nlayer of straw and feathers.\r\n\r\nThe highest falls in the river are known as Carretia, and are supposed\r\nto be about thirty feet high; they block the eastern channel of the\r\nriver, here divided into two branches by the immense Isla de Raton. In\r\nthe western arm the Raudal del Conejo and Raudal Saltinero effectively\r\nblock this watercourse to navigation. It is said that the Spaniards\r\nbuilt a road from Atures to the foot of the Cerro Sipapo above the\r\nfalls of Carretia, and that the Indians still follow this route\r\noccasionally. If true, this was doubtless a great convenience, as it\r\ndid away with the necessity of navigating some fifty-odd miles of the\r\nmost difficult and dangerous waterway of the entire river.\r\n\r\nA large boat called _piragua_ was obtained at Maipures, and in this\r\nthe expedition travelled to San Fernando de Atabapo in six days’ time.\r\nThe river is dotted with a number of islands, the largest being the\r\ngreat Isla de Raton, all heavily forested; the current is frequently\r\nso strong that no headway could be made either by rowing or poling the\r\nheavy boat. At such times a thick cable of the braided fibre of a palm\r\ncalled _chiquechique_ had to be requisitioned, and everybody walked on\r\nthe bank, dragging the boat slowly along. The very first day the man\r\nin the lead ran into a bushmaster fully eight feet long, and narrowly\r\nescaped the vicious thrust of the deadly reptile; a charge of shot soon\r\nput an end to the creature’s menacing career, but the men jumped into\r\nthe boat and did not want us to take along the dead snake, or they said\r\nits mate would be sure to follow and inflict a terrible revenge for the\r\nloss of its companion; this kind of superstition is very common among\r\nthe natives on the Orinoco. Few of them would dare shoot a jaguar, as\r\nthey firmly believe that for every one slain a member of their own\r\nfamily would be carried away by one of the huge spotted cats.\r\n\r\nThe country on the Colombian side, from below Atures onward, is level\r\nllano, covered with a good growth of grass, and with an abundance of\r\nwater. Some day, no doubt, and in the near future, numerous herds of\r\ncattle will graze in the rich pasturage awaiting them, and another\r\nsource will be added to the world’s limited supply of meat. A fringe of\r\ntrees grows along the river; among them are the valuable “cachicamo”\r\nand “cedro,” the trunks of which are frequently fashioned into canoes\r\nby the natives.\r\n\r\nThe Vichada, at this season, had dwindled down until at its mouth it\r\nwas not more than a hundred yards wide. We could see a range of hills\r\nfar to the west, dimly outlined against the sky and finally fading into\r\nobscurity in the haze; in this direction the river has its origin.\r\nSeveral Piaroa families had settled near the junction of the two rivers\r\nand built a large hut of palm-leaves and grass. The men lounged in\r\ntheir hammocks all day long, drinking rum and fighting the clouds of\r\nsand-flies which feasted on their half-naked bodies; at night they\r\ncrossed to one of the numerous sand-banks and collected basketsful of\r\nturtle eggs and also as many turtles as their canoes would hold. Some\r\nof their canoes were mere shells, so small that we could never learn\r\nhow to negotiate them; no matter how quietly we sat they upset as soon\r\nas pushed out into the current, but an Indian or even two would calmly\r\nsquat down in the bottom, take up their paddles, and glide away without\r\nthe least concern.\r\n\r\nThe women were making cassava bread; after the tubers (_Manihot\r\nutilissima_) are ground and the juice has been extracted a thin layer\r\nof the coarse meal is spread on the bottom of a shallow pan about\r\nthree feet in diameter; the heat causes the particles to adhere,\r\nforming a tough, round wafer which can be turned without breaking; it\r\nis thoroughly baked on both sides. When cold it hardens, and the huge\r\nslabs are then done up in bundles of twenty to forty each, tied up in\r\nplantain leaves, and in this way it can be kept indefinitely. This is\r\nthe bread of the Orinoco, and is always carried as the main article\r\nof provision by Indians and travellers alike; when needed pieces are\r\nbroken off, dipped in the river to soak a few minutes and then eaten.\r\nWhile not particularly appetizing, the slightly acid flavor is not\r\nunpleasant, and if there is time to freshly toast it just before using\r\nit is really quite palatable. Another article commonly prepared by the\r\nPiaroas is the bark of a certain tree, called “tabari.” Long, narrow\r\nstrips are cut from the trees and alternately soaked in water and\r\nbeaten between rocks until the thin layers separate into tissue-like\r\nsheets; these are used in rolling cigarettes.\r\n\r\nOne of the granite ledges flanking the river just above the Piaroa\r\ndwelling bears on its surface a number of curious figures, carved in\r\nthe face of the rock; unfortunately the water was so low that we passed\r\nfar beneath them, and I was unable to make out just what they were; but\r\nthe canoemen who had seen them a number of times said they were figures\r\nof men and date back to prehistoric times.\r\n\r\nThe country now rapidly grows wilder; tall forest replaces llanos\r\nor scattered growth, and the camps of rubber-collectors dot the\r\nriver-banks. One afternoon, as we poled quietly along, we came upon a\r\nhuge anaconda coiled up on a sand-bank; all about were iguanas three or\r\nfour feet long, digging nesting burrows in the loose sand. The snake\r\nhad just caught one of the big lizards and was crushing it into a limp\r\nmass, but the others paid not the slightest attention to the tragedy\r\nwhich was being enacted in their midst, and ran about or worked but a\r\nfew feet away. When we approached to within twenty feet the anaconda\r\ndropped its victim and flung itself into the water; some of the iguanas\r\nfollowed it, and others scampered away over the sand.\r\n\r\nThat night we reached the low, sandy island of Tanaja and, ascending\r\none of the branches of the river, made camp on the rocky mainland. The\r\nwater was sluggish and shallow, so that we could easily see the muddy\r\nbottom six or eight feet below. As the boat moved slowly along we\r\nbecame aware of masses of black, flitting shadows underneath, and soon\r\nmade out vast shoals of fish of various sizes that literally covered\r\nthe bottom. There were rays, electric eels, catfish, and _piranhas_ by\r\nthe thousands, besides many others which we could not identify; the\r\nreason for their congregating in this shallow place is hard to guess.\r\n\r\nThe boulders on the bank were dotted with what we at first took to be\r\nlichens; but examination showed them to be night-hawks (_Chordeiles\r\nrupestris_) of a light gray color, which clung to the rounded tops\r\nsilent and immovable, as if carved out of stone. When we paddled across\r\nto the island a short while after, we found scores of others, but\r\nthese were the females squatting on one or two fragile speckled eggs\r\nwhich had been laid in shallow hollows scooped out of the warm sand.\r\nThey were very tame and permitted me to walk up to within a few feet\r\nof them; then they took wing and with noiseless, graceful flaps flew a\r\nshort distance away and dropped back on the sand.\r\n\r\nFlocks of red-and-blue macaws flew screaming across the river in\r\nquest of some favorite tree in which to spend the night, far in the\r\ndepths of the forest; after them trailed parrots of various sizes and\r\ncolors, always flying two by two. Herons flapped lazily up-stream, and\r\nsnake-birds perched on snags looked down at the masses of fish below,\r\napparently regretting their limited capacity for eating. Exciting as\r\nthis naturally must be to a field-naturalist, it was but a foretaste of\r\nwhat we were to find each day farther up the river.\r\n\r\nAs the morning of January 24 sped by, the water of the Orinoco began to\r\nassume a dark color, and by four o’clock that afternoon we had reached\r\nthe mouth of the Atabapo; an hour and a half later we had ascended the\r\nclear red water of that river for a distance of three miles, and tied\r\nthe _piragua_ to the ledge below San Fernando.\r\n\r\nSan Fernando de Atabapo is the last settlement on the Orinoco and was\r\nthe base from which we hoped to make our dash to the unexplored regions\r\nabout Mount Duida.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE MAQUIRITARES’ LAND AND THE UPPER ORINOCO\r\n\r\n\r\nSan Fernando, on the Atabapo, consists of about fifty adobe huts of the\r\nusual type, and at the time of our arrival was all but deserted. Almost\r\nthe entire population had gone up-river to the scattered rubber-camps,\r\nas this was the season for collecting the valuable latex.\r\n\r\nThe town is situated on the Atabapo, where this river and the Guaviare\r\nunite, and its elevation above sea-level is three hundred and seventy\r\nfeet. The mean temperature is about 80° F., although in the sun the\r\nmercury ascends to 112° F. or more, but the place is not particularly\r\nunhealthful.\r\n\r\nThe water of the Guaviare is muddy, while that of the Atabapo is of\r\na clear red color and unfit for drinking. There are few fish, no\r\ncrocodiles or sand-flies, and practically no mosquitoes, all of which\r\nis attributed to the discolored water. Two small springs near the\r\ntown furnish an abundant supply of potable water, and when during the\r\nrainy season these are covered with the overflow from the river it is\r\nnecessary to paddle across and fill the water-jars from the Guaviare.\r\n\r\nTo secure a crew of men for our trip up the river was a difficult\r\nundertaking and required a great deal of time. This gave us an\r\nopportunity of exploring the surrounding country.\r\n\r\nIn the immediate vicinity of San Fernando the forest has been cut down\r\nand tall second-growth sprouts form dense thickets; this is a favorite\r\nresort of many small birds, and several species of night-hawks make\r\nit a daytime rendezvous. The basic granite crops out in many places,\r\nthe strata occasionally standing on end, and it is often streaked\r\nwith narrow seams of quartz. There is no cultivation of any kind;\r\nthe inhabitants lack all initiative for work and eat tinned foods and\r\nmandioc received in exchange for trinkets from the Indians.\r\n\r\nWhen we returned a few months later a changed town confronted us. The\r\nrubber-collectors had returned from their several months isolation in\r\nthe interior, and were spending the fruits of their labor as rapidly as\r\npossible. Dance-halls, gaming-dens, and almost every conceivable device\r\nfor relieving men of their money had sprung up like mushrooms, and\r\nthere was drinking and merrymaking day and night. Then suddenly, and\r\nwithout presage, a tragedy occurred; it will never be forgotten by the\r\nfew who survived.\r\n\r\nGovernor Pulido, so it was rumored, had imposed a new tax on all\r\nrubber collected in the district, and had come to San Fernando to\r\npersonally collect the extortion. Naturally, there was a good deal\r\nof dissatisfaction, and one night, just after we had been provided\r\nwith a canoe and secretly advised to leave as soon as possible, the\r\nstorm broke. A band of men, said to be under the leadership of one\r\nColonel Funes, an Indian and the most notorious man in the district,\r\nattacked the town, killed the governor, and practically the entire male\r\npopulation, and rifled the shops and dwellings. If one may believe the\r\ntales of the few who escaped the brutalities committed that night, the\r\ndeeds rival those of the most barbaric ages.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some of those who perished deserved their fate, others\r\nassuredly did not; but it is a fact that government offices had been\r\nconducted abominably. In the post-office, for example, stamps were sold\r\nfor twice their face value, and if one did not purchase them there and\r\nplace them on the letters in full view of the postmaster, the mail was\r\ndestroyed. A physician who chanced to be there, named La Page, and\r\nwho apparently belonged to the military organization as he wore the\r\nregulation uniform, tried to collect over four hundred dollars gold for\r\na few injections of quinine; and so the robbery went on until the whole\r\nband was exterminated.\r\n\r\nHaving engaged a captain with some experience on the Upper Orinoco, and\r\na crew, we on February 3 loaded the low _batelão_ and started on our\r\nmission, reaching a point called _Puerto Ti Ti_ that night; from this\r\nspot a wide trail leads through the magnificent forest to the clearing\r\nwherein stands San Fernando.\r\n\r\nFor six days we made slow but steady progress up the river, and then\r\nentered the formidable _Raudal de Santa Barbara_, which extends across\r\nthe entire delta of the Ventuari.\r\n\r\nThe Orinoco is wide but with few exceptions so shallow that we pushed\r\nalong with long poles. Where the water was deep and the current swift,\r\nlong-handled hooks were used to catch the overhanging vegetation\r\nand pull the boat along. This latter mode of travel was always slow\r\nand dangerous and the swarms of wasps and other insects living\r\namong the leaves, and shaken down, were far from being agreeable\r\ntravelling companions. The banks were covered with dense, virgin\r\nforest; but there were extensive sand-banks and flat ledges of rock at\r\nconvenient intervals, and one of these was always chosen for a night’s\r\ncamping-site. If we chanced to be on a _playa_, the early hours of\r\nthe evening were spent in fishing. Armed with _machetes_, a bag, and\r\nacetylene-lamps, we waded out in the shallow water and “shined” the\r\nshoals of fish much in the manner that frogs are caught in parts of\r\nthis country. At night the fish swam near the surface, and by directing\r\nthe rays of the strong white light upon them one could approach to\r\nwithin a short distance and then strike with the knife: in this manner\r\nlarge numbers were taken. Occasionally a stingray, electric eel, or\r\ncrocodile was suddenly encountered and then there ensued a hurried\r\nscramble in the other direction; this gave the pastime a decided\r\nelement of sport. We also became more familiar with the dreaded\r\n_caribe_ or cannibal fish, known as the _piranha_ in Brazil, with which\r\nthe water teemed. In the Orinoco they attain a weight exceeding three\r\npounds and are formidable indeed. The natives will not go in bathing\r\nexcept in very shallow water, and I know of two instances where men\r\nwere attacked and severely bitten before they could escape. The fish\r\nsomewhat resembles a bass in shape, although the mouth is smaller; the\r\njaws are armed with triangular, razor-edged teeth; and as they travel\r\nin immense shoals they are capable of easily devouring a man or large\r\nanimal if caught in deep water. Floundering or splashing in the water\r\nattracts them, but they seldom attack unless their appetite has been\r\nwhetted by a taste of blood; and then woe to the unfortunate creature\r\nwhich falls into their power. To catch them, we used a large hook\r\nsecured to a long wire leader and baited with any kind of raw meat, and\r\nthey always put up a good fight. Without a wire, a line would be bitten\r\nin two every time a fish struck. When taken from the water they are\r\nfirst killed by a blow on the head with the _machete_, and then removed\r\nfrom the hook.\r\n\r\nAt night there was always a heavy dew, and it rained intermittently\r\neach day. On dark nights, and often after a shower, the banks of the\r\nriver where there was forest glowed with twinkling phosphorescence.\r\nExamination showed that the decaying vegetation was filled with\r\nmyriads of small, wriggling insects, greatly resembling our well-known\r\ncellar-bug (_Isopod_), and one day we paddled for many hours through\r\na mass of flying ants which had come to grief in the river. The water\r\nwas covered with them and the waves had tossed them up on the banks to\r\na depth of several inches. Another thing that attracted our attention\r\nwas the large number of bats. On one occasion we heard a dull rumbling\r\namong the granite ledges near camp, and not long after a stream of\r\nbats began to emerge from the cracks; from a distance they resembled\r\na cloud of smoke. There must have been many thousands, for the black\r\nmasses continued to rise until darkness obscured them from our view.\r\nSpruce records that on one occasion he saw not less than a million\r\nunder similar circumstances. This brings up an interesting problem.\r\nThe individual range of these bats is probably not very great, the\r\nresult of which is that immense numbers of them are distributed over\r\na comparatively small area. Now, if the struggle for existence is as\r\nkeen as is often supposed, how can the female, encumbered with her\r\noffspring fully three-fourths as large as herself, compete successfully\r\nwith the unhampered males, and secure enough food not only for herself\r\nbut also for her young? The fruit-eating varieties might not suffer\r\nseriously from this handicap, but it does seem as if the agility of the\r\ninsectivorous kinds catching their food on the wing would be greatly\r\naffected.\r\n\r\nThere are numbers of curious formations along the river which cannot\r\nfail to attract the interest of the traveller, no matter what his\r\nparticular mission might be. One of these is the Cerro Yapacana, a\r\nsquare block of granite not over one thousand five hundred feet high;\r\nit is a very conspicuous landmark as it towers above the forest like\r\na giant monument, and can be seen many miles away. We did not come\r\nabreast of it until eight days after first sighting it.\r\n\r\nThere are few rubber-camps along this part of the river, but several\r\nIndian families had come to spend some weeks collecting turtles\r\nand eggs on the sand-banks. At night absolute quiet reigned on the\r\n_playas_ so long as the moon shone; but no sooner had the brilliant orb\r\ndisappeared below the horizon than the water was broken with ripples\r\nas numbers of turtles emerged to deposit their eggs in the loose, warm\r\nsand, and jaguars came from the dark forest to feast on the defenseless\r\ncreatures and rend the still night air with ugly coughs and grunts.\r\n\r\nIn returning from fishing excursions we usually cut across the several\r\nmiles of sandy waste toward camp, guided by the bright fire which the\r\ncook was required to keep burning, and in this way learned a good deal\r\nabout the turtle’s habits. After leaving the water the creature wends\r\nits way toward the highest point on the island or _playa_, and with a\r\nfew powerful strokes of the flippers excavates a deep hole; the eggs,\r\ntwenty to a hundred in number, are then deposited, after which the sand\r\nis scooped back into place and patted down so carefully that it takes a\r\nvery experienced eye to locate the spot. The turtle then hurries back\r\nto the water, where it apparently remains until the following year.\r\nWhen the eggs, warmed by the sun’s rays, finally hatch, the _playas_\r\nswarm with small turtles which are eagerly collected by the natives,\r\nboiled entire and eaten. The egg contains a great deal of oil, and\r\nalthough cooked a long time always remains soft. Iguana eggs are taken,\r\nalso, and boiled and eaten, even when about to hatch.\r\n\r\nBesides the turtles there were many other signs of life on the\r\nsand-banks. Water-birds, squatting low in some cup-shaped hollow,\r\nlooked stupidly at the dazzling light of the gas-lamps, and could be\r\napproached to within a few feet; downy young birds waited quietly until\r\nnearly touched with the hand and then ran away into the darkness, like\r\npuffballs rolling before a breeze.\r\n\r\nThe _Raudal de Santa Barbara_ is a wicked stretch of water. The\r\nVentuari, coming from the neighborhood of the Brazilian border, forms\r\nan extensive delta near its mouth. There are many islands, some of\r\ngreat size, and all heavily forested. The Orinoco is very wide, and\r\nhundreds of sharp, tall rocks protrude above the water, causing a\r\nseries of rapids which are hard to ascend. It took us three days of\r\nthe most trying kind of work to traverse this stretch of agitated\r\nwater, and finally to haul the boat up the falls, which come as a\r\nsort of climax at the end. A strong wind blows from the north almost\r\nconstantly, whipping the water into a choppy sea. On the bank stands\r\na good-sized rubber-camp, and extra hands can usually be secured to\r\nhelp pull the boat through the rapids. The men from this place had\r\njust returned from a hunt in the forest, bringing two jaguars and an\r\narmadillo weighing sixty-five pounds. One of the jaguars was black.\r\nAll of these animals were eaten, and of the two species the flesh of\r\nthe jaguars was the better. One night, not long after, one of these\r\nanimals invaded our camp. As the sand-bank we had selected was a narrow\r\none, the crew chose to sleep on the forest side; they greatly feared\r\nthe crocodiles in the river. Early in the morning I was awakened by a\r\njaguar’s roaring mingled with frightened wails, and upon investigation\r\ndiscovered that the men had come to our part of the camp near the\r\nwater, leaving the captain’s wife in their former location. They had\r\nreasoned that she was the least useful member of the party and had\r\ncompelled her to remain as “bait.” Maria was sent back to San Fernando\r\nin the next canoe we met bound down the river.\r\n\r\nThe abundance of the big, spotted cats and their harmlessness under\r\nordinary circumstances is astonishing, although at times they will\r\nattack human beings. At one of the rubber-camps we were shown the skin\r\nof a recently killed animal which had stalked a two-year-old child at\r\nplay not far from the hut; the mother, a negress, seeing the animal in\r\ntime, attacked it with a _machete_ and killed it.\r\n\r\nThe next river of any importance to be encountered was the Rio Lao,\r\nreached February 17. Up to this time the strong north wind had\r\ncontinued to blow without interruption, and the course of the river\r\nwas dotted with islands. Rubber-camps were situated on the river-bank,\r\nand we had our first glimpses of the Maquiritare Indians. Owing to\r\nthe frequent rains, the year had been a bad one for the _patrones_,\r\nor managers of the camps; also, a kind of malady had broken out among\r\nthe _peons_ and Indians which killed many and frightened others away.\r\nNevertheless, those who remained seemed quite contented, and if we\r\nchanced to spend the night at a camp or _barraca_, our men always\r\njoined them in their pastime of drinking, playing the guitar, and\r\nsinging songs about one another, far into the night. Some of the men\r\nwere clever at improvising songs apropos of the occasion. At one place,\r\nfor instance, they heard of the jaguar’s visit to the sand-bank, and\r\nthat the captain’s wife had been sent back to San Fernando. Without\r\nhesitation one of the peons sang:\r\n\r\n    _Qué tristeza en nuestro campamento,\r\n    Pobrecito Ildefonso está llorando,\r\n    A caramba, nadie está alegre,\r\n    Será porqué Maria fué á San Fernando._\r\n\r\nThe largest _barraca_ by far which we saw was owned by an old Turk\r\nnamed Parraquete. He received us cordially, shook our hands, and\r\nembraced us, apologetically explaining that a slight fever prevented\r\nhis rising from the hammock; later we found out that he was a leper\r\nin the last stages of the disease. He had fifteen Maquiritares in\r\nhis employ, each of whom collected the latex from several hundred\r\nrubber-trees every morning; in the afternoon the milk was smoked, one\r\nhundred pounds of the liquid yielding about forty or fifty pounds of\r\ncrude rubber. A species of heavy, deep-red wood called _mazarandul_\r\nwas used to produce the dense smoke necessary to coagulate the latex.\r\n_Hevea_ only was gathered here, although _balata_ was also collected\r\nfarther down the river and on the Guaviare. The governor of the\r\ndistrict told me that about fifteen million trees of the _balata_ had\r\nbeen cut down along the latter river during the last ten years, as the\r\nmethod used to secure this class of rubber necessitates felling the\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nThe proprietors of rubber-camps use the same system of keeping their\r\nemployees that the commission merchants in Ciudad Bolivar, who are the\r\npurchasers of the crude product, employ in dealing with themselves;\r\nnamely, they keep them constantly in debt by advancing quantities of\r\nmerchandise at exorbitant prices. It is not unusual for one _patrón_ to\r\nsell some of his men to another for the amount of their indebtedness,\r\nor more, if he can get it, and sometimes an unsatisfactory _peon_ is\r\nturned loose in the wilderness to shift for himself; we picked up one\r\nwho had been abandoned on a sand-bank, in a half-starved condition.\r\n\r\nThe Cerro Carriche is another granite mass similar to Yapacana, but\r\nnot quite so high. It stands on the south bank of the river, between\r\nthe mouths of two small rivers called Carriche and Trocoapure.\r\n\r\nEarly on February 21 we had the first distinct view of the Cerro Duida,\r\nlooming, faintly outlined, in the distance. From afar it resembled a\r\nhigh, level plain, but as the vapor clinging to the huge, dark mass\r\nslowly dissolved itself, a well-defined short range appeared with twin\r\npeaks showing high above the rest of the mountains.\r\n\r\nThe Orinoco steadily decreases in width until the distance across\r\nis not more than half a mile; in many places the banks are high and\r\ncomposed of pink and white clay streaked with layers of dark-blue clay.\r\nOn both sides the jungle presents an unbroken wall of tangled verdure;\r\noccasionally a slender palm rears its delicate head high above the\r\nriotous mass, as if gasping for one more breath of air before being\r\nstrangled by the figs and creepers slowly entwining its stem with\r\ntheir death-dealing tentacles. Among the lower growth are vast areas\r\nof palms, known as _coco del mono_, with long fronds resembling those\r\nof the _Seaforthia_, and bearing small, hard nuts; the leaves are used\r\nin thatching huts and the _carroza_ or covering of the boats. Another\r\npalm, tall and thorny, resembles the well-known _chonta_ of Colombia;\r\nit bears large clusters of red nuts, which are very palatable when\r\nthoroughly boiled.\r\n\r\nThe heat was always intense and most oppressive; even the cool nights\r\nbrought no respite, and in the early morning a thick vapor slowly rose\r\nfrom the water, to be later wafted above the tree-tops and disappear.\r\n\r\nFlocks of hoatzins, or lizard-birds (_Opisthocomus cristatus_),\r\nwere seen almost daily. They fussed and fluttered among the dense\r\nvegetation, but could not be induced to leave their dark retreat. There\r\nwere also nesting-trees of the black and yellow orioles, better known\r\nas caciques, which are about the size of a blue jay; sometimes a single\r\ntree contained thirty or more nests placed close together, and also\r\ninvariably a number of large wasp-nests were placed in the same\r\ntree. The nests of these birds differed from those of the giant orioles\r\n(_Ostinops_) in being smaller and having the opening at the top instead\r\nof at the side of the swinging bag.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A rubber-camp on the Upper Orinoco.]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the twentieth day we reached the mouth of the Cunucunuma,\r\nand camped upon its sandy banks for the night. This river is\r\napproximately five hundred feet wide at its mouth, shallow, with dark,\r\nclear water, and flows southward, joining the Orinoco at right angles,\r\nas the course of the latter river at this point is eastward; a low,\r\nforested hill called _Ventana_ rises to the north. One may cover the\r\ndistance from the mouth of the Cunucunuma to the Cassiquiare in a day,\r\nand reach the plains on which was located Esmeraldas by continuing his\r\njourney an additional day.\r\n\r\nNot far above the mouth of the river is the dry bed of a stream, said\r\nto have been the former course of the Cunucunuma; short, soft grass\r\nnow covers the ancient, sandy route and the lines of trees on each\r\nside present such clean-cut edges as to suggest well-kept hedgerows.\r\nTapirs and capybaras have worn many paths through the luxuriant sward;\r\napparently these animals come out into the open at night to feed.\r\n\r\nThe current of the river is so strong that we could not average more\r\nthan four or five miles a day. Through the clear water we could see\r\nshoals of fish and numbers of large sting-rays darting about over the\r\nbottom. One fish, resembling a beautifully spotted trout, rose eagerly\r\nto a trailing hook baited with a strip of white cloth; it weighed\r\nabout a pound, and was called _pabón_ by the natives; on two occasions\r\nmembers of this species leaped clear of the water and into the boat\r\nas we poled along after nightfall. Another kind greatly resembled a\r\nflying-fish, and leaving the water singly or in pairs, skimmed over the\r\nsurface for a distance of twenty yards or more, and then dropped with\r\na splash; when “flying” it left a train of ripples in its wake, as if\r\nlong appendages were trailing after it.\r\n\r\nThere now followed a series of low, disconnected mountains which might\r\nbe called the foot-hills of Duida. The first of these is the Cerro\r\nPiapoco, one thousand three hundred feet high; parts of it are covered\r\nwith low scrub growth, and the river winds around three sides of it.\r\nNext comes the Cerro Tapicure, a rounded granite mass approximately\r\none thousand four hundred feet high. At the base of the latter is a\r\nMaquiritare plantation of _yucas_ (Manihot), pineapples, and plantains,\r\non the edge of which stood the communal house, conical in shape and one\r\nhundred feet in diameter. The place was temporarily deserted, as the\r\nIndians were down-river gathering the rubber harvest. Near by also grew\r\na palm new to us, the _Tamiche_; it is thirty feet high, with erect,\r\nundivided leaves, and the crown resembles a huge, green, opening tulip.\r\n\r\nWhile tramping in the forest across the river from the Indian\r\nplantation we came suddenly upon a Maquiritare woman and her four small\r\nchildren, squatting around a small fire built under a rough lean-to.\r\nShe was roasting a curassow and tearing off pieces for her young brood,\r\nwhich was devouring them with the voracity of wolves. The frightened\r\nglances of these wild people and their gnawing at the half-cooked\r\nflesh was quite in keeping with their surroundings, and stamped them\r\nimmediately as a perfect part of the virgin wilderness.\r\n\r\nRapids are not wanting in the Cunucunuma. The first is the _Raudal del\r\nMuerto_, formed by a wide ledge of rock which extends across the river,\r\nand over which the water rushes with a deafening roar. Next comes the\r\n_Raudal del Sina_, which is longer but not so difficult to navigate.\r\nJust above this we entered the Sina, a small stream which comes from\r\nthe direction of Duida, and ascended to its highest navigable point;\r\nthis, however, was only a few miles above its mouth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Unloading for the portage, Raudal del Muerto.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Cerro Duida.]\r\n\r\nThe Cunucunuma, it may be stated, rises in the vicinity of the\r\nlittle-known Cerro Cuachamacari, and may be ascended to the foot of\r\nthe Cerro Maravaca. On most maps its course has been marked east\r\nof Duida, while in reality it is on the western side. Its tributaries\r\nfrom the east are the Tabarí, Sina, Cua, and Rio Negro; and from the\r\nwest the Yacaré and Cumichi. There are numerous rapids. Besides the two\r\nmentioned, the Indians named the San Ramón, Rayao, Chacherito, Vaquiro,\r\nMapaco, Chipirima, Picure, and Culebra, all of which must be passed\r\nbefore reaching Maravaca.\r\n\r\nWhen rocks and low water barred a farther ascent we made camp on the\r\nhigh bank and began the arduous work of cutting a trail to Duida,\r\nabout six miles distant. We had secured the services of a number of\r\nMaquiritares; two men, two women, and a boy, and these, together with\r\nthe members of our crew, were immediately put to work on the trail.\r\nWhile this was in progress we devoted ourselves to the exploration of\r\nthe forest and its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nApparently the Indians, who in common with many South American tribes\r\nseek the smaller streams for their habitations, and who live in small\r\ngroups all along the Cunucunuma, rarely visited this locality. Game\r\nwas so abundant and so tame that it was impossible that the animals\r\nhad been persecuted to any considerable extent. We also visited the\r\nhouse of the chief of the tribe, named Antonio Yaracuma, whose _cunuco_\r\n(clearing) was on the Cunucunuma, a few miles above the mouth of the\r\nSina (Sina is a Maquiritare word meaning wolf). This place he chose\r\nto call Yacaré. Surrounding the great, conical house was a small\r\npatch of _yucas_ and pineapple-plants, walled in on all sides by the\r\ninterminable forest. The edge of the roof came down to within five feet\r\nof the ground, and there were eight fireplaces, equal distances apart,\r\nshowing that eight families occupied the dwelling. A perfect network of\r\npoles and beams supported the ragged grass and palm-leaf canopy, and\r\nfrom these various articles were suspended: Drums, made of sections\r\nof hollow tree-trunks and covered with the skin of a red howling\r\nmonkey on one side and of a peccary on the other; long tubular baskets\r\nof wickerwork used to express the poisonous juice of the _yuca_\r\nroot in making _mandioca_; blow-guns ten feet long, hammocks, and\r\nfishing-tackle. Everything was immaculately clean and well arranged. On\r\none side two small rooms had been built of adobe, one for the chief,\r\nand the other for storing baskets of _mandioca_, each of which held\r\nabout a hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nA walk around the edge of the clearing disclosed an obscure trail which\r\nzigzagged and wound through the forest about a mile and then opened\r\ninto an immense plantation, which we estimated contained not less than\r\na hundred acres. The trees had been cut down and burned, and _yucas_\r\nneatly planted in hills stretched to the very edge of the clearing.\r\nThrough the centre ran lanes of plantain and banana plants, bordered by\r\nrows of pineapples, sugar-cane, and cashews. The ground was carefully\r\ncultivated, and there were no weeds; the stalks of uprooted plants had\r\nbeen piled around the edge of the field forming a thick fence. The\r\nreason for maintaining such large plantations is that the women make\r\na good deal of _mandioca_ to sell to the traders for cloth, matches,\r\nperfume, and trinkets. The men clear the ground; the women plant and\r\ncare for the crops. From the juice of the _yuca_ a very intoxicating\r\ndrink called _casire_ is made, and of this great quantities are\r\nconsumed during the wild orgies which take place at frequent intervals.\r\nBoiling and fermentation destroy the poisonous effect of the fresh\r\njuice.\r\n\r\nWe found the forest around camp to be all but impenetrable on account\r\nof the underbrush and creepers. Also, there were a number of windfalls\r\nwhere cyclones had cut wide, clean swaths through the forest, leaving\r\nan upheaved barrier that could not be crossed without the liberal\r\nuse of axe and _machete_. Small birds were abundant and travelled in\r\nmixed flocks. Of the larger birds there was an unfailing supply; guans\r\nand curassows strutted unconcernedly about, or flew into the lower\r\nbranches of the trees to look at us with surprise or resentment; large\r\ntinamou ran about in pairs like chickens and were slow to take wing.\r\nOccasionally we ran into a flock of trumpeters (_Psophia_), which\r\nstared at us in curiosity for a few moments and then flew into a tree,\r\nand raised an unearthly din, cackling and screaming until dispersed by\r\na few shots.\r\n\r\nThe Indians told a curious story about a trumpeter and a curassow.\r\nIn the very beginning of things two of these birds decided upon a\r\nmatrimonial alliance, but domestic troubles soon broke out and there\r\nwas no possibility of a reconciliation; it was thereupon decided to\r\nlay the case before the gods who live on the summit of Mount Duida.\r\nThe wise gods ordered them to fight it out; in the course of the\r\ncombat that followed, the curassow pushed the trumpeter into the fire,\r\nburning off the feathers of the latter’s tail; the trumpeter promptly\r\nretaliated by pushing her mate into the fire, singeing his crest.\r\nThereupon the gods decreed that they should remain in this humiliating\r\nplight for the rest of their days, and so even to this day the curassow\r\nwears a curled crest and the trumpeter has a very short tail.\r\n\r\nNo matter how far we chanced to go during the morning’s hunt it was\r\nalways easy to determine the exact location of our camp. A colony of\r\ncaciques had built their nests in the top of a tree near the tent, and\r\nquarrelled and chirped so noisily all day long that we could not get\r\nout of hearing of them.\r\n\r\nAfter the trail had been completed for a distance of several miles,\r\nhunting was rendered much easier. It was a delight to wander\r\nnoiselessly along the clean path and watch the wild things pursuing\r\ntheir daily activities. Tapirs moved quietly across the narrow lane,\r\nlike shadows; but if disturbed crashed through the brush and thundered\r\naway like frightened horses. Large red squirrels frisked in the trees\r\nor fed in the nut-bearing palms. Monkeys were always about; there were\r\nred howlers, cebus, and small black woolly monkeys with gold-colored\r\nhands; the latter travelled in small troops and raced through the\r\ntree-tops at great speed, making long jumps from branch to branch; at\r\nfrequent intervals during the morning and evening they raised their\r\nvoices in shrill little cries of distress, resembling a series of\r\nquickly repeated ohs.\r\n\r\nThe river was teeming with fish. At night, after their work had been\r\ncompleted, the Indians, who camped on the water’s edge, threw in their\r\nlines and never failed to catch a goodly supply. While in our presence\r\nthe men always wore blue cotton trousers and the women loose dresses of\r\nthe same color, but when alone they threw aside all clothing.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a light canoe containing women and children passed our\r\ncamping-site, but they always remained as near as possible to the\r\nopposite bank and paid no attention to us whatever if we chanced to\r\ncall to them; in fact, they could not even be induced to look in our\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nThe nights were always sultry and it rained frequently. If the weather\r\npermitted, a huge fire was built; into this a steady stream of\r\nfireflies or click-beetles winged their way to destruction. Late one\r\nnight we heard a queer pattering on the top of the tent-fly; back and\r\nforth scurried the little feet, and up and down the sloping roof. Our\r\nacetylene-lamps revealed a family of opossums which had discovered an\r\nideal playground. Often, too, we heard cautious footsteps near by, and\r\nthe suddenly flashed light disclosed the glowing eyes of a deer, tapir,\r\nor jaguar, which gazed stupidly a moment into the dazzling brilliance\r\nand then darted away.\r\n\r\nOn account of the dampness mould formed so rapidly that cameras and all\r\nleather goods had to be cleaned daily, and there was great difficulty\r\nin drying specimens.\r\n\r\nWe had frequent views of Duida. Each morning at about ten the mist\r\ndrifted from the summit and revealed the jagged, rocky peaks; our\r\ncalculations placed the altitude of the mountain at approximately five\r\nthousand five hundred feet. Toward the Orinoco the mass presents a\r\nbold front, the sheer walls of granite rising to a height of several\r\nthousand feet. The western slope is gradual and any attempt to ascend\r\nthe mountain should be made from that side.\r\n\r\nCutting the trail required more time than we had anticipated. It was\r\nour intention to remove the equipment to the very base of Duida,\r\nand this was impossible until a suitable way had been prepared. The\r\nintervening country is rolling and the hollows are filled with a\r\nnetwork of deep, water-filled canyons; across these trees had to be\r\nfelled to provide a means of crossing. Also, neither the Maquiritares\r\nor the Venezuelans proved to be very industrious, and were about as\r\npoor a class of assistants as can be found. However, work progressed\r\nsteadily, and there came the day when the last bridge had been placed\r\nacross the winding river, and we were able to proceed to the foot of\r\nDuida.\r\n\r\nNear the mountain the forest assumes a different aspect. Instead of\r\nthe tall trees there are vast groves of palms which form such a dense\r\ncanopy that the sunlight never penetrates to the ground; for this\r\nreason there is no undergrowth, but the earth is covered with a soft\r\ncarpet of dry leaves. Some of the plants attain such giant proportions,\r\nwith fronds thirty or forty feet long and fifteen feet wide, they form\r\ngreat tent-like shelters.\r\n\r\nAs we neared the mountain the Indians became restive and finally\r\nrefused to go any farther. They firmly believe that it is the abode of\r\nspirits who will be quick to resent any intrusion into their sacred\r\nprecincts. Besides, the rainy season was fast approaching, and at night\r\nblinding flashes of lightning played among the crags, and the dull boom\r\nof distant thunder pierced the sultry blackness. Wind swept through the\r\nforest in fitful blasts, and it rained frequently. Sometimes the blasts\r\nattained the velocity of a cyclone and sent tall trees crashing down on\r\nall sides. The Indians could endure the strain no longer, so one night\r\nthey quietly disappeared, taking the boat with them. At first this loss\r\nseemed anything but pleasant, but a raft was soon constructed, and two\r\nof the men were sent down to the nearest rubber-camp on the Orinoco\r\nfor another craft. We never saw our Indians again, but one afternoon\r\ntwo men of the tribe visited our camp. They emerged silently from the\r\nforest, having concealed their canoe somewhere above or below, laden\r\nwith baskets of plantains, sweet potatoes, and bananas, and several\r\ncakes of cassava bread, also a large, freshly killed curassow--enough\r\nprovisions to keep two men a week. I thought they wanted to stop with\r\nus for the night, and showed them the fireplace. They paid no heed\r\nto my implied invitation, but dropped their burdens at our feet,\r\nreluctantly accepted a few fish-hooks which were offered to them, and\r\nthen departed as mysteriously as they had come. Perhaps they had been\r\nsent by our erstwhile companions, who may have been conscientious\r\nenough to make some reparation for the theft of the canoe.\r\n\r\nThe rainy season advanced with such rapid strides that further work was\r\nimpossible. Vapor hung over the forest like a pall for days at a time,\r\nand the river, rising with each passing hour, was quickly inundating\r\nthe lowlands. The sight of the new canoe coming up the river was\r\ntherefore a welcome one, and it did not require many days to pack our\r\ncollections and outfit, stow them aboard, and steer a course downward\r\nwith the rapid current. It required only nine days to reach San\r\nFernando de Atabapo.\r\n\r\nThe results of the expedition are surprising and interesting. Duida is\r\nnot the isolated “mountain island” it was commonly supposed to be, but\r\nis connected with the mountains of the Ventuari and Parima by a series\r\nof hills, some of which reach a height of over a thousand feet. Its\r\nelevation is comparatively low, being less than that of the Maravaca.\r\nTo attempt its ascent from the Orinoco side seems hopeless on account\r\nof the frowning precipices facing the plains near Esmeraldas. The\r\nproper placing of the Cunucunuma and an elaboration of the map of the\r\nregion are other results.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that the dry season is much shorter on the\r\nUpper Orinoco than on the lower river, and work must be pushed with\r\nthe utmost speed. The tributaries of the Orinoco, as well as the\r\nmain river, leave their banks soon after the beginning of the steady\r\ndownpours, and the whole country is flooded many miles inland; in\r\nplaces the river is then one hundred and twenty miles wide; all the\r\nrubber-camps we had seen on the upward trip were totally deserted when\r\nwe passed them going down, and of some of the huts the roofs only\r\nshowed above the water; others had vanished with the yellow flood.\r\n\r\nThe collections of birds and mammals were large and interesting; they\r\nyielded a number of species and one genus new to science.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, a word about assistants; under no circumstances should\r\nVenezuelans or Indians be depended upon. It is possible to secure\r\nexperienced river-men in Trinidad, and with proper treatment they make\r\nfaithful and efficient companions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nLIFE IN THE GUIANA WILDS\r\n\r\n\r\nA naturalist might spend many years in Venezuela and still exhaust\r\nbut a very small fraction of the possibilities offered to the\r\nfield-observer--so vast are the resources of that zoological\r\nwonderland. Exigencies beyond our control, however, recalled us to\r\nTrinidad, and after a brief rest we turned our eyes toward British\r\nGuiana.\r\n\r\nThe distance between the island and the low Guiana mainland is not\r\ngreat; it required just two days of uneventful sailing for the\r\n_Sarstoon_ of the Quebec Line to plough through the deep water and\r\nschools of flying-fish, and finally nose her way carefully through the\r\nmud to Georgetown.\r\n\r\nThe city is built on the low coastal land, and a great stone wall\r\nprevents the sea from reclaiming its own at high tide. The streets are\r\nwide and bordered with trees. No more suitable style of architecture\r\ncould be desired for a tropical country than that employed in\r\nconstructing the houses of the better class of inhabitants; they are\r\npractically all doors and windows, giving admittance to every passing\r\nbreeze. The wide verandas are carefully screened.\r\n\r\nNumerous canals, spanned by picturesque little wooden bridges, divide\r\nthe city into sections. At low tide the locks in the sea-wall are\r\nopened to permit the excess of water to escape; at high tide the\r\nlocks are closed to keep the lowlands from being flooded. Growing in\r\nthe water are masses of _Victoria regia_ lilies with white or pink\r\nflowers; the giant leaves, with upturned edges, and often several feet\r\nacross, resemble huge pies; but the plant is lovely from a distance\r\nonly, as the veins and midribs are covered with long, sharp spines\r\nthat effectively prevent any intimate advances on the part of an\r\noverenthusiastic admirer.\r\n\r\nMosquitoes are not lacking, but they appear at night only, when one\r\ncan easily evade them by remaining indoors; and through the hours of\r\ndarkness the twanging and peeping of myriads of frogs fill the air with\r\na not unmusical din.\r\n\r\nThe population is the most cosmopolitan imaginable. It ranges from\r\ndignified, helmeted British officers down to the meanest Chinese or\r\nHindu coolie living in a dilapidated shamble on the border of a marshy\r\nrice-field.\r\n\r\nOur first care was to secure the admission of our equipment by the\r\ncustoms officials. This was accomplished without an undue amount of\r\ndifficulty; and within a short time we had also obtained a permit to\r\npursue our scientific work, for in British Guiana birds are wisely\r\nprotected. We also opened negotiations with Sproston’s, Ltd., who\r\noperate many large lumber, rubber, and mining enterprises in the\r\ninterior of the country. This step is a most essential one, as the\r\nconcern, through its agents, can be of the greatest assistance to the\r\ntraveller.\r\n\r\nOn July 7, we boarded a comfortable little steamer and started up the\r\nDemerara. Rain fell in torrents throughout the day so that it was\r\nimpossible to see anything but the fleeting, yellow water against which\r\nthe straining craft battled vigorously, and the long rows of trees\r\nfaintly outlined in a world of blue-gray mist. Wismar was reached\r\nthat night and passengers and luggage were hurried aboard the waiting\r\ntrain, which soon covered the eighteen miles of intervening country\r\nto Rockstone, on the Essiquibo River. A delightful bungalow hotel is\r\nmaintained by Sproston’s at the latter place, and every need of the\r\nvisitor is superabundantly supplied.\r\n\r\nA launch of considerable size, towing a house-boat provided for\r\nfirst-class passengers, left Rockstone early the following morning. The\r\nEssiquibo is truly a very great river, and the height and magnificence\r\nof the forest covering its banks is not exceeded in any part of South\r\nAmerica. In some instances, the trees are one hundred and seventy-five\r\nfeet high; cottonwood, greenheart, and wallaba mingled their leafy\r\ncrowns far above the mere rabble of palms and lower growth, shutting\r\nout the light and effectively killing their competitors until--after\r\nhundreds of years of successful fighting--the strain begins to tell\r\nand the monarchs are compelled to bow before the inevitable onslaught\r\nof old age. At the first signs of weakness enemies spring up on every\r\nside. The struggle for life is constant and in deadly earnest. Of the\r\nhundreds, perhaps thousands, of saplings which appear as the light and\r\nair gradually penetrate through the opening made by the dying giant,\r\nonly one can eventually survive. Naturally, the strongest and fittest\r\npossesses every advantage in the mad fight for existence, and as it\r\nquickly outstrips its weaker rivals they wither and die.\r\n\r\nThe launch called at a number of rubber-plantations and lumber-camps.\r\nGreat quantities of greenheart (_Nectandra rodiæi_) are cut and\r\nexported; the wood is very hard and durable, and resists decay when\r\nunder water, for which reason it is used largely for submerged work\r\nsuch as wharfs and piles. Next in importance is crab-wood (_Carapa\r\nguianensis_) employed in building houses; third in value are several\r\nvarieties of wallaba (_Eperua_); this wood has a coarse but even grain\r\nand is very resinous, being suitable for the manufacture of shingles\r\nand vat-staves.\r\n\r\nThe rubber industry ranks third in importance in British Guiana. By far\r\nthe greater part of this product is balata, collected from indigenous\r\ntrees that are tapped under careful government supervision. _Sapium_\r\nyields the better quality of rubber, but exists in limited quantities\r\nonly, and the majority of the trees on plantations have not yet reached\r\nthe productive age.\r\n\r\nOur first headquarters were made at Tumatumari, a short distance above\r\nthe mouth of the Potaro River. The river is at this point encumbered\r\nwith a series of rapids ending in a fall of twenty or thirty feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wismar on the Demerara River.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tumatumari on the Potaro River.]\r\n\r\nTumatumari is a small negro settlement, and owes its existence to the\r\ngold-mines scattered throughout the surrounding country. We made\r\nheadquarters in a comfortable bungalow provided by Sproston’s. A good\r\ntrail leads through the tall forest, a distance of many miles, with\r\nnumerous side trails branching off in various directions. Along the\r\nlatter we immediately began to prosecute our work. On our very first\r\nexcursions we heard the enchanting song of the Guiana solitaire, or\r\nquadrille-bird as it is locally known. From the depths of the dark\r\nforest there arose a low, mournful note, so liquid and melancholy that\r\nthe music of no instrument made by the hand of man could equal it in\r\nethereal beauty; gradually it swelled louder and louder, but always\r\npreserving the same exquisite quality until the eight notes had been\r\nuttered and the song died with a wistful sob. To hear this song is\r\nto experience one of the most enchanting of earthly delights, the\r\nmemory of which will remain as long as life itself and gild the other\r\nreminiscences of sweltering days spent in tropical lowlands, of plagues\r\nof insects, of fever, and even the hard-fought battles against odds\r\nthat seemed overwhelming. The bird is a shy little creature, and is\r\nobscurely colored; among the deep shadows where it spends its lonely\r\nexistence the brown and gray of its modest attire blend so well with\r\nits surroundings that it is rare indeed to have even a fleeting glimpse\r\nof the captivating songster.\r\n\r\nPerched in the dead tops of some of the tallest trees, we found a\r\nbird which, seen from below, resembled a giant long-tailed hummer;\r\nbut a short time spent in observation soon disclosed the fact that\r\nit belonged to another family, so different were its habits. It sat\r\nmotionless many minutes at a time, and darted off a short distance,\r\npresumably in pursuit of an insect, at infrequent intervals, only\r\nto quickly return to its perch. This was the paradise jacamar, a\r\nresplendent bird with a metallic green back and black underparts.\r\nThe jacamars form a peculiar family, and have been frequently called\r\n“forest-kingfishers” because of their superficial resemblance to the\r\n_Alcyones_. The greater number of species are gorgeously colored and\r\ninhabit the lower branches of forest-trees, feeding on insects. The\r\nnest is placed in a hole in the bank of some wild ravine or river.\r\n\r\nThe abundance of bird-life, and also the variety, found in the\r\nlowland forest of British Guiana is bewildering, even to the seasoned\r\nfield-observer; and nowhere in all South America are the feathered folk\r\nclothed in more brilliant and gorgeous colors. Evolution, it seems,\r\nhas run riot in almost every conceivable direction in an effort to\r\nprovide each species with some special color or characteristic that\r\nmight enhance its beauty or better suit it to compete successfully\r\nwith its hosts of neighbors. Thus we find the king-tody, a species\r\nof small flycatcher that preys upon insects. The body of the bird is\r\ninconspicuously colored, but the head is adorned with a crest of the\r\nmost vivid scarlet feathers. As the bird sits quietly upon some low\r\nperch, the crest is depressed and invisible; then suddenly the flaming\r\ncrown is erected and spread in fan-shaped formation, when it resembles\r\na brilliant flower newly burst into bloom. Is it not possible that this\r\nflashing bit of color may attract some passing insect, which instead of\r\nfinding nectar meets destruction?\r\n\r\nHowever, I do not believe that the survival of every species is\r\ndependent upon some one particular patch of color or exotic appendage\r\nwhich it may possess. It does not seem to me possible, for instance,\r\nthat one species of humming-bird owes its existence to a green\r\nthroat-patch, or another of similar size and habits to a red or blue\r\none; nor that one bird of paradise persists because it has curious,\r\nlong appendages on its head or shoulders while a second one may have\r\nsimilar ones in its tail; but rather does it show that evolution tries\r\nmany experiments. Each animate thing is full of latent buds, it would\r\nseem, any one of which might break out at any time, prompted by an\r\nimpulse or conditions of which we know nothing. If the result of such\r\nnewly acquired variation is beneficial, the species would naturally\r\npersist; if injurious, it would result in extermination; if indifferent\r\n(neither harmful nor of value) it would have no effect one way or\r\nthe other, and might still be retained. This latter, I believe, has\r\noccurred in a number of instances.\r\n\r\nOur visit to Tumatumari was supposedly at the end of the wet season;\r\nnotwithstanding this, it rained copiously nearly every day, and\r\ninvariably each night. We spent the evenings on the wide veranda of\r\nour habitation, preparing specimens or writing notes. Myriads of\r\ninsects, attracted by our bright lamps, fluttered in and out of the\r\ndarkness and settled on the white walls. Our two colored assistants,\r\nwhom we had brought from Georgetown, were trained and enthusiastic\r\nentomologists, having been employed by Doctor Rodway of the Georgetown\r\nMuseum, and spent several hours each night with net and cyanide bottle.\r\nFrequently they caught several hundred specimens in a short time. They\r\nalso prepared cages of fine wire netting in which caterpillars were\r\nimprisoned and carefully fed, and glass boxes, or “incubators” for\r\ncocoons; in this work they were most successful, and a number of moths\r\nof rare and desirable species were reared to a state of perfection.\r\nSometimes the downpour was so heavy that it disturbed small birds in\r\ntheir sleep in the bushes; on several occasions finches (_Sicalis_)\r\nfluttered up to the lamp in a dazed or bewildered manner, when we\r\ncaught them easily and placed them in a cage, liberating them the next\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nNumbers of Indians of the Patamona tribe live in the surrounding\r\nforest. They are a friendly though primitive people, and some of\r\nthem speak or understand a few words of English. We accompanied the\r\nProtector of Indians, a British official living at Tumatumari, to one\r\nof the Indian dwellings one day. It seems that a negro had promised\r\nto marry a Patamona woman, then ran away, when she promptly married a\r\nman of her own tribe. Learning of this, the former suitor had written\r\na letter to the officer demanding either his bride or damages. The\r\nofficial spent a very bad hour trying to explain the situation to the\r\nwoman in the limited Patamona vocabulary at his command, while she\r\nsat stolidly in a hammock. When he had finished, she calmly remarked,\r\n“Well, you tell him I think he is a damn fool,” in perfect English!\r\n\r\nThis tribe of Indians has a curious custom of torturing themselves\r\nin various ways, which performance is called “beena.” It is supposed\r\nto insure success in any undertaking. A favorite method is to insert\r\ntough, pliable creepers into the nostrils and draw them out through\r\nthe mouth. Another consists of slashing the breast, arms, and legs,\r\nand rubbing into the wounds the acrid juice of a plant. The official\r\nto whom I have previously referred had an Indian in his employ whose\r\nduty it was to supply the table with fresh meat. He hunted daily in\r\nthe forest, bringing in deer, peccaries, agoutis, and other game in\r\nabundance; but on one occasion fortune conspired against him. Thereupon\r\nhe tried his favorite beena, but it failed to bring him luck; every\r\nother means of mutilation known to the man was then resorted to in\r\nrapid succession, but still his long tramp and careful stalking yielded\r\nno meat. He became greatly discouraged and told his employer that he\r\nwould make one more attempt at hunting, and should he fail in this\r\nwould use his weapon upon himself. The officer thought it unwise to\r\npermit the discouraged man to return to the forest on the day following\r\nthis declaration, so ordered him to cut weeds in his back yard. This\r\nthe Indian reluctantly consented to do, but scarcely had he begun when\r\nhe cut down a bush containing a wasps’ nest and was severely stung. He\r\nimmediately took his gun and hurried away, saying that a new “beena”\r\nhad been sent to him, and that at last the evil spell was broken.\r\nStrange to relate, that night he returned laden with game.\r\n\r\nA daily launch service is maintained from above the falls at Tumatumari\r\nto Potaro Landing, a day’s journey up-stream. The boat’s crew are all\r\nnegroes, and are ordinarily a careless, slovenly lot. A short time\r\nbefore, they had failed to make proper allowance for the strength of\r\nthe current when approaching the landing, and the launch, together\r\nwith its thirty or more occupants, was swept over the falls and lost.\r\nAccidents such as this have caused the government to make wise and\r\nstringent rules regulating navigation on all streams, and applying to\r\nall craft, even canoes, containing passengers other than the owner; as\r\na result accidents are now of rare occurrence.\r\n\r\nOne day’s time is required to reach Potaro Landing, the end of launch\r\nnavigation, from Tumatumari. Tourists who visit the justly famous\r\nKaieteur Falls proceed overland from this point, a distance of seven\r\nmiles, and then embark in canoes manned by full-blooded Patamona\r\nIndians. There are other but shorter portages farther up the river,\r\nthough as a whole the journey is not difficult and well worth making.\r\n\r\nThe appeal of Potaro Landing was irresistible to us, so we decided to\r\nremain a week or two. Unfortunately, Sproston’s maintains no rest-house\r\nhere, as touring-parties continue to Kangaruma, at the other end of the\r\nportage, to spend the night. However, we found a good-natured Chinaman,\r\nwho operates a store in the one lonely building at the landing, and he\r\npermitted us to use half of his barn; he had to remove his horses in\r\norder to supply even these limited quarters.\r\n\r\nA good cart-road leads through the forest a distance of eighteen miles\r\nto the mining country on Minnehaha Creek, and many negro miners passed\r\nalong this way each day; the greater part of them are what is locally\r\nknown as “pork-knockers,” because they live largely on salt pork and\r\nknock about from one place to another. They secure a small stake from\r\nthe government with which to buy a pick and shovel, and then go into\r\nthe interior to prospect. If, as frequently occurs, they strike a rich\r\npocket, or find a nugget of considerable size, they immediately drop\r\ntheir implements and rush back to Georgetown to spend their newly\r\nacquired wealth. Carriages are engaged by the day, servants employed,\r\nand clothes of a bright and flashy nature are purchased in quantities.\r\nFor a short time they revel in luxury and live in contempt of their\r\nerstwhile companions. Quite naturally their wealth soon disappears,\r\nand the tawdry finery is pawned to provide money for more necessary\r\nthings; but there is an end even to this resource. Soon they again seek\r\nthe stake of a few dollars and hie themselves back to the wilderness\r\nto once more try their luck as ordinary pork-knockers. To strangers\r\nthe negroes are courteous and obedient, but among themselves they are\r\nquarrelsome, unfeeling, and even cruel. I heard of an instance where a\r\nnumber of them had been commanded to take a very sick companion down\r\nthe river in search of medical treatment. As they paddled along the\r\npilot frequently called to the man nearest the sufferer: “Ain’t dead\r\nyet?” The person addressed roughly turned the sick man over with his\r\npaddle to inspect him, and then answered with a curt “No.” “My! dat\r\nman dead hard,” replied the pilot. They were most eagerly awaiting his\r\ndeath because it would save them a long trip, and they had planned to\r\ndivide among themselves his possessions the moment life departed.\r\n\r\nWe met an American at the landing, who had experienced several\r\nunpleasant encounters with the negroes. He was engaged in searching\r\nfor diamonds and had many of the colored folk in his employ. So far\r\nall the stones discovered had been of small size, but one day two of\r\nhis men found a gem of good proportions. They immediately entered\r\ninto an argument as to whether or not it was a real diamond, and to\r\nsettle the dispute placed it on an anvil and hit it repeatedly with\r\na sledge-hammer. “If it a diamond, it can’t broke,” was the gist of\r\ntheir theory. However, it was a real diamond, and it also broke; their\r\noutraged boss found the worthless particles a short time later. On\r\nanother occasion this same man was confined in a hospital at Georgetown\r\nwith a severe attack of fever. One night the colored head nurse swept\r\nin majestically, gave him a short, condescending look, and then\r\ndirected his private nurse as follows: “Look through Mr. M.’s drawer\r\nto see if he’s got a white shirt to bury him in!”\r\n\r\nAt frequent intervals throughout the day we heard a deep, powerful note\r\ncoming from the forest. It was a long-drawn _Wow_ that lasted eight\r\nor ten seconds, and exactly resembled the sound made by a circular\r\nsaw cutting its way through a log. This we found was made by the\r\nbald-headed cotinga (_Gymnocephalus_), a bird the size of a crow, and\r\nof a dark-brown color; the head is entirely devoid of feathers, like a\r\nvulture’s. Invariably several of these curious creatures were together,\r\nfluttering about among the lower branches and making the woods ring\r\nwith their queer, outlandish cries. Another species of cotinga\r\n(_Xipholena_) was very rare; it was of smaller size and of the deepest\r\nwine color, with long, graceful wing-coverts and white primaries. When\r\nseveral were together in some tall tree-top they kept up a continuous\r\nquacking like a flock of ducks. If a skin of this bird is exposed to\r\nheat the color rapidly fades to a sickly bluish-gray.\r\n\r\nOne day an Indian hunter brought in a very small red howler monkey,\r\nand as I was aware that the species had not been known to live in\r\ncaptivity more than a few weeks, I was very eager to see if I could\r\nrear it. On account of its small size it had, of course, to be fed\r\non milk (condensed), which it soon learned to take from the point\r\nof a fountain-pen filler. While it thrived and grew rapidly, it was\r\nalways a sad little fellow and made no attempt to play or show signs\r\nof great friendliness. The only advance it ever made was to come up\r\nto me occasionally when I spoke to it, and feel of my face with its\r\nlittle black hands. After a time it was given full liberty about the\r\ncamp, when it would spend hours sitting quietly beside a basin of\r\nwater gazing at its reflection. After two months, and just as I was\r\ncongratulating myself on having raised it past the danger-point of its\r\nexistence, it climbed to a high shelf and ate a quantity of the arsenic\r\ncompound used in preparing specimens.\r\n\r\nLearning of our presence at Potaro Landing, a Mr. McKenzie, manager\r\nof the Minnehaha Development Company, very kindly invited us to his\r\nbungalow, eighteen miles away, and later sent a carriage for our\r\ntransportation. The distance was covered in half a day, and lay\r\nmainly through the heavy forest, although there was occasionally an\r\narea of considerable extent covered with tall, rank grass and bushes.\r\nThe company was operating one small dredge in Minnehaha Creek, and\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that the entire region had been gone over\r\nbefore, quantities of gold were being recovered from the bed of the\r\nstream. As there had been no “clean-up” for two weeks, one was arranged\r\nfor our benefit. The gold, which was in very fine particles, was\r\nbrought up from the dredge in tin cans, and then placed in an iron\r\nretort and heated to a very high temperature; this freed the mercury\r\nwith which the yellow metal had been collected from the mud and water\r\nin passing over the sluiceway of the dredge. Later it was again placed\r\nin the retort, together with pulverized glass and borax, to gather up\r\nthe impurities, and melted; then it was poured into moulds. Four bars,\r\nweighing one hundred and twenty-five ounces each, were recovered. It\r\nwas then inspected and passed by an official, who also made a note of\r\nthe amount of tax due the government. A coolie servant was despatched\r\nto take it to Georgetown to the company’s headquarters, and although\r\nhe would be on the way a number of days and be compelled to mingle\r\nwith all sorts of people, he carried no weapon of any kind with which\r\nto protect his precious burden. This speaks well for the law and order\r\nmaintained throughout the colony.\r\n\r\nThe country along Minnehaha Creek is rolling and covered with a good\r\nstand of timber. Numerous small streams flow through ravines between\r\nthe hills, and while the current is strong the streams are not deep. A\r\nfootpath continues to a point seven miles beyond, on the Konamaruck,\r\nand from this a network of short, narrow trails branch out in all\r\ndirections. The rainfall is very great in the entire region; during the\r\nmonth of August (1913) it was twenty-seven inches, while only nineteen\r\ninches fell at Tumatumari in the same period of time. One result of the\r\ngreat amount of moisture is that there is an increase in density of the\r\nlower growth, and the branches are covered with hanging moss.\r\n\r\nAs one moves quietly along the narrow lanes, enclosed on both sides by\r\nwalls of trees, the lofty tops of which form a leafy vault overhead, he\r\ncannot fail to be impressed with the great breathless silence of the\r\nforest. The gloomy solitude seems pregnant with mysterious forces that\r\ndraw the thoughts of the lonely wayfarer to far-off regions of blissful\r\noblivion. Then, suddenly, a low, wailing cry of anguish rising in\r\ntremulous crescendo, but with liquid smoothness, smites the wanderer’s\r\nrevery and brings him back to earth with palpitating heart and\r\nthrobbing pulses; the whinny rapidly decreases in volume and dies with\r\na few short sighs. “Something, perhaps the combination of all these,\r\nmakes one feel as if he had been caught with his soul naked in his\r\nhands; when, in the midst of subdued and chastened revery, this spirit\r\nvoice takes the words from his tongue and expresses so perfectly all\r\nthe mystery, romance, and tragedy that the struggling, parasite-ridden\r\nforest diffuses through the damp shade.” It is the voice of the forest\r\ntinamou.\r\n\r\nThe notes of several species of ant-thrush (_Grallaria_ and _Chamæza_)\r\nare remarkable for their quality and even beauty. One of them has a\r\npeculiar call resembling the words _compra pan_ (buy bread), and by\r\nthis name it is known among the natives of Colombia. Another gives a\r\nvery good imitation of a moon whistle, the song lasting fifty seconds\r\nat times, without the slightest intermission. These birds are very\r\nlong-legged, almost tailless, and obscurely colored above; the breast\r\nis frequently streaked. They spend their entire lives in the damp gloom\r\nof the forest floor, and although the song may come from but a few feet\r\naway, it is impossible to get even the briefest glimpse of the bird in\r\nninety-five per cent of the cases where it is heard.\r\n\r\nIf we stopped to rest on the buttressed roots of some great cottonwood,\r\nwe saw a few of the minor creatures whose existence is hardly\r\nsuspected by the casual observer. What at first appeared to be a maze\r\nof cobwebs filling the entrance to a dark cavern under the roots,\r\nresolved into a moving, living mass. A closer inspection, and small,\r\nblack specks could be distinguished in the madly weaving and revolving\r\nhaze, and also long, threadlike legs dangling so idly that one wonders\r\nwhy they do not become hopelessly entangled with those of their\r\nneighbors. This peculiar, wavering flight of the crane-fly seems to\r\nform the delicate, spidery creature’s chief occupation, for I rarely\r\nfound them at rest. Presently, other little insects, encouraged by\r\nthe silence, make their appearance. First among them may be a small\r\n_Gastaracantha_ spider, slowly letting itself down from an overhead\r\ntwig on a thread of finest gossamer. At first glance one may easily\r\nmistake the insect for a minute crab that has fallen from the leafage\r\ninto a silken snare, but when, at the watcher’s first movement, it\r\neither runs nimbly up the dangling thread, or drops to the ground with\r\na rapid slacking of line, one is convinced that it must be a spider.\r\nThe hard shell, or back, is fringed with sharp, upturned spines and is\r\nof an orange color marked with a number of small black dots.\r\n\r\nAfter a shower, mosquitoes were numerous and attacked with the utmost\r\npersistency. This irresistible thirst for blood is very extraordinary;\r\nit does not seem possible that more than a very small proportion of\r\nthe countless millions of these insects living in a given area ever\r\nhave an opportunity for satiating their appetite for blood during their\r\nentire lifetime; yet the instinct remains, and they attack on sight\r\nferociously and without hesitation any living thing whose skin their\r\nbeaks can penetrate. It is also a well-known fact that malarial fever,\r\nso prevalent in the tropical lowlands, is transmitted by a genus of\r\nmosquito, _Anophiles_. The germ of this fever, however, passes only one\r\nperiod of its existence within the insect’s body, and the spores must\r\nbe secured from some living creature, and after development transmitted\r\nto another to complete the life cycle. Some of the areas in which\r\nmalaria abounds are practically uninhabited by human beings, so this\r\nagent in the propagation of the disease is of course lacking--at least\r\nto a considerable extent. It naturally follows, therefore, that some\r\nother creature or creatures, may be preyed upon and inoculated by\r\n_Anophiles_. I have on several occasions observed pet cebus and woolly\r\nmonkeys (_Lagothrix_) that showed decided symptoms of suffering from\r\nmalaria, and to me it seems highly possible that monkeys may be at\r\nleast one of the animals that serve to keep the infection alive.\r\n\r\nWhile at Minnehaha Creek I received the information that Colonel\r\nTheodore Roosevelt was shortly to embark on a voyage to South America;\r\nand also, much to my pleasant surprise, that I had been selected as\r\na member of his expedition. The time remaining at our disposal was\r\nvery limited, so we rather reluctantly gave up our intended visit to\r\nKaieteur Falls and Mount Roraima, and returned to Wismar for our last\r\nwork in British Guiana. A strip of land several miles wide on either\r\nside of the railroad connecting Rockstone and Wismar, is owned by\r\nSproston’s, and the greater part of it has been cleared of forest.\r\nInstead of the dense growth of tall trees there are now impenetrable\r\nthickets of high slender sprouts and bushes. These jungles harbor\r\nalmost every bird and animal found in the region, and while it is\r\nimpossible to enter them for any great distance, we had not the\r\nslightest difficulty in making large and varied collections along the\r\nborders. One evening the superintendent of the line was returning from\r\na tour of inspection, and as the motor-car in which he was riding\r\nslowly rounded a curve, a jaguar suddenly appeared on one side of the\r\ntrack; he promptly killed it with a shotgun as it was only a few yards\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\nWe returned to Georgetown, from which place Mr. Igleseder, who had been\r\nmy assistant, started for New York, while I sailed for Barbados, where\r\nI planned to await the arrival of Colonel Roosevelt and join him on his\r\nexpedition into the wilderness of Brazil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nFIRST WEEKS WITH THE ROOSEVELT SOUTH AMERICAN EXPEDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe S. S. _Van Dyck_ of the Lamport and Holt Line, with Colonel\r\nRoosevelt and his party on board, arrived at Barbados on the morning of\r\nOctober 10, and late that afternoon pointed her nose southward toward\r\nBahia. The plans of the expedition, with which I was immediately made\r\nacquainted, called for a rather short and not too difficult trip up the\r\nParaguay River and down the Tapajos, having for its prime object the\r\nstudy of the fauna and collection of zoological specimens in the region\r\ntraversed; but all this was changed within a very few days as we shall\r\nsubsequently learn. Besides Colonel Roosevelt, the expedition consisted\r\nof Geo. K. Cherrie, Anthony Fiala, Jacob Sigg, Father Zahm, and myself.\r\n\r\nBahia was reached on the 18th; Kermit Roosevelt joined the expedition\r\nat this place. The _Van Dyck_ remained at anchor the entire day, thus\r\nallowing sufficient time for a casual inspection of the city. Two\r\ndays after, we arrived in Rio de Janeiro. The paucity of the English\r\nlanguage does not permit of an adequate description of the natural\r\nbeauties of the harbor and the city. All steamers entering the bay\r\nmust sail through the narrow passage between the famous _Pão de\r\nAzucar_ and the mainland on the opposite side. The great loaf-shaped\r\nrock rises to a height of twelve hundred feet above the water; if one\r\ncraves excitement, it is possible to ascend to the top in a small car\r\ntravelling on steel cables.\r\n\r\nIn few cities is there such a display of great wealth. The main street,\r\nthe Avenida Central, is wide and beautiful, and the sidewalks are of\r\ncoarse mosaic. There are numerous palatial buildings, though some of\r\nthem are too ornate to appeal to North American taste, and gold-leaf\r\nand carved marble have been used lavishly in their decoration. The\r\npublic squares, filled with the finest of tropical trees and plants,\r\ngive a park-like appearance to at least parts of the city.\r\n\r\nOf interest to the tourist, perhaps, are the numerous curio-shops\r\nfilled with a varied assortment of almost everything ranging from\r\nminute, brilliantly hued beetles, to feather flowers and the skins of\r\nanacondas. Brazil is of course popularly believed to be the land of\r\nhuge snakes; one dealer calmly told us that he frequently had skins\r\nforty _metres_ long, but the longest he happened to possess measured\r\nless than twenty feet in length. The number of stories in common\r\ncirculation concerning serpents of monstrous proportions in South\r\nAmerican countries, is astonishing; and it was interesting to note that\r\nthe farther south we went, the longer the reptiles grew.\r\n\r\nThus, in Barranquilla, near the Caribbean coast of Colombia, I was told\r\nthat specimens thirty feet long were to be had frequently; this did not\r\nseem quite probable. In Venezuela thirty-five feet was not considered\r\nunusual, and I was sorry that none were to be obtained during my visit.\r\nIn British Guiana, snakes forty feet long were said to be fairly\r\ncommon, although I could find no one who had actually seen one of that\r\nsize. The climax was reached in Rio de Janeiro, when a curio-dealer\r\ntold about the forty-metre snakes. I frankly expressed my doubts, and\r\nhe proceeded to tell of how a man standing beside a snake of this size,\r\nthat was coiled up, could not look over the top of it--it was such a\r\ngreat heap.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that Brazil with its great Amazon basin\r\nproduces many strange and unusual creatures; but when it comes to\r\none-hundred-foot snakes, it can only be said that there is absolutely\r\nno proof of their existence. No dealer I ever visited, and there were\r\nmany, could ever produce a skin over twenty feet long.\r\n\r\nThe traveller into the interior hears many stories of great serpents\r\nand their doings; for instance, the story of the horned snake is famous\r\nall over South America, and while the details may vary, the main\r\nfeatures are always the same. It is the tale of a person (usually the\r\none telling the story) who came suddenly upon an enormous snake with\r\na long horn on either side of the head. Of course, the reptile was\r\nimmediately killed, sometimes with a rifle or revolver, or occasionally\r\nwith a knife, after a desperate struggle. As the slain monster writhed\r\nits last, the heroic hunter made a startling discovery; the snake did\r\nnot actually have horns; it had merely swallowed an ox, which feat it\r\nperformed without difficulty until the head was reached; this refused\r\nto go down on account of the spreading horns lodging crosswise in the\r\ncorners of the snake’s mouth. Hence the old, old story of the horned\r\nsnake.\r\n\r\nAnother favorite anecdote which I have heard repeated a number of\r\ntimes is that of the man who with his wagon, to which two oxen were\r\nhitched, attempted to ford a stream; suddenly an anaconda of enormous\r\nsize emerged from the water and, enveloping both animals in its coils,\r\ncrushed them to death. I never encouraged those telling this story\r\nto continue, because I was afraid that they might say the snake had\r\nswallowed both oxen and perhaps even the wagon at the same time!\r\n\r\nNot many years ago a South American explorer brought back photographs\r\nof the “trail” made by a huge snake in crawling along the sand. It\r\nwould be easy to manufacture such a trail by dragging a bag full of\r\nsand along the ground, and while it is impossible to say that this was\r\nreally done, such a photograph would be of no value, anyway, as it\r\nwould be impossible to determine the size of the reptile from such a\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nIn this way the evidence of the existence of gigantic snakes gradually\r\ndwindles away, and we are compelled to look for material on which we\r\ncan lay our hands, whereon to base our knowledge. That is, the stories\r\nof the average traveller and native as well must not be taken too\r\nseriously; and only the skins or living specimens known to exist can be\r\ntaken into consideration.\r\n\r\nThe longest South American snake of which I could obtain any definite\r\ninformation is in a Brazilian museum, and was said to be about\r\ntwenty-five feet long. A skin of this size may be stretched several\r\nfeet during preparation, so the snake may have been somewhat shorter\r\nin life. In the Bronx Zoological Gardens, New York, there is a living\r\nanaconda fourteen feet long; the largest boa-constrictor is eleven feet\r\nin length.\r\n\r\nNo visit to Rio de Janeiro is complete without an inspection of the\r\nbotanical gardens, which cannot fail to appeal to all lovers of the\r\nbeautiful. Immediately upon entering, one is confronted by avenues of\r\nstately royal palms, ninety to one hundred feet high. The “mother of\r\nthe palms,” towering above all the others, is pointed out with pride\r\nby the gardeners. It is said that this was the first of the species\r\nto be planted, and that all of the others were grown from seed taken\r\nfrom this one plant. There are also attractive little lagoons filled\r\nwith flowering pond-lilies and fishes, and bordered with graceful\r\ntravellers’ palms introduced from Madagascar. Rows of bamboo form\r\nsheltered lanes where the visitor may seek relief on comfortable\r\nbenches from the midday sun.\r\n\r\nThe palace Guanabara, dating back to the time of Dom Pedro, was\r\nopened for the use of Colonel Roosevelt. Its location is in the most\r\nattractive spot imaginable. Sitting at the table in the immense\r\ndining-room, one may look down a palm-lined avenue to the blue water\r\nof the bay, a half-mile distant; it was through this lane of tall,\r\nbeautiful trees that Isabella, daughter of the King, drove to her daily\r\nbath in the surf.\r\n\r\nActing upon the invitation of officials of the Brazilian Government,\r\nColonel Roosevelt abandoned the plans he had made previously and\r\nchanged the character of the expedition from a zoological to a\r\ngeographical one. Colonel Rondon, who had been engaged some years\r\nin making a survey through Matto Grosso for a telegraph-line, had\r\ndiscovered the headwaters of an unmapped river. This he had called the\r\n_Rio da Duvida_, or River of Doubt, for no one knew whither it went.\r\nThe invitation to explore and map this stream was tendered to Colonel\r\nRoosevelt, and he accepted it.\r\n\r\nWe left the colonel at Rio de Janeiro, after making arrangements to\r\nmeet subsequently, and continued on to Buenos Aires, spending a day _en\r\nroute_ in Santos, and one in Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay.\r\n\r\nAlthough we had read and heard a great deal about the city of Buenos\r\nAires, we were hardly prepared for the pleasant surprise that\r\nawaited us. The population of this metropolis of the south is more\r\nthan a million and a half, and the city presents a clean, dignified\r\nappearance. In many respects it is as modern as New York City. There\r\nare numbers of tall edifices patterned after our own skyscrapers,\r\nlarge hotels, and theatres. An electric subway was just being opened,\r\nand the crowds in the Calle Florida in the late afternoon rival those\r\nof Broadway. The climate is cool and agreeable. One of the things\r\nthat particularly attracted our attention was the presence one day of\r\nswarms of dragon-flies flying in a steady stream high above the city;\r\nthey were blown in by violent winds, or pamperos, which sweep across\r\nthe level plains country, and gave one the impression of a raging\r\nsnow-storm.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Cherrie and I were eager to devote every available moment to\r\nzoological work, we left Fiala and Sigg, whose duty it was to look\r\nafter the rather appalling amount of luggage, and secured passage\r\non the Argentine Northwestern Railroad, which had just inaugurated\r\nthrough service to Asuncion, Paraguay. We took only the small amount\r\nof equipment necessary for few weeks’ work, as the two others were\r\nto come up with the remainder of the baggage on the first available\r\nfreight-boat. Our train was the second to make the through trip and\r\nwas scheduled to run biweekly. It was composed of seven Pullmans,\r\ntwo baggage, and a dining car; the service was good. Leaving Buenos\r\nAires on the afternoon of Sunday, November 2, we reached Rosario at\r\ndark. Here the train was run onto a steel boat and carried up-river a\r\ndistance of sixty miles, after which it continued the journey on the\r\neast bank of the Paraná. The next night we recrossed the river on a\r\nferry, and were landed at Encarnacion, Paraguay. Asuncion was reached\r\nlate on the afternoon of Tuesday.\r\n\r\nThe railway journey had been through level plains, interspersed at\r\nlong intervals with small clumps and strips of low woods; but it\r\nis essentially a grazing country and we passed numerous herds of\r\ncattle feeding on the vast, fence-enclosed ranges. Stalking about\r\nunconcernedly among the herds were small bands of semi-domesticated\r\nrheas, but they were not abundant; I doubt if we saw a hundred during\r\nthe entire trip. Caracaras, or carrion-hawks, glossy ibises, our old\r\nfriends the jacanas, which resembled huge grasshoppers when on the\r\nwing, rails, and spur-wing plovers, or lapwings, were plentiful.\r\nFrequently we saw the domed mud-nests of oven-birds perched upon fence\r\nor telegraph-poles, or on the lower branches of trees. Villages are\r\nfew and far between, and the natives, a motley crowd of dark-skinned\r\nindividuals, usually left their shambling, grass-thatched huts and came\r\ndown _en masse_ to see the train.\r\n\r\nAsuncion is a quaint old town, plainly showing the marks of violence\r\nthat have been left by frequent revolutions. Mr. Ferris, the American\r\nconsul, who met us at the station and rendered us every assistance\r\npossible, had witnessed five revolutions in as many years; there had\r\nbeen seven presidents in the same period of time. The streets of the\r\ncity are narrow and paved with cobblestones; the buildings are low,\r\nconstructed of adobe, and have red-tile roofs. There are one or two\r\nbanks, a college, several churches, a public market and good hotels,\r\nas well as fair electric car and light service; there is also the\r\ninevitable lottery. We noticed little business activity. An air of\r\ndepression seemed to hang like a pall over the people, and this\r\nmay be readily accounted for when one recalls the tragic history of\r\ntheir country. Many of the women were in deep mourning. One authority\r\nestimated that the proportion of women to men was eleven to one,\r\nalthough this is probably an exaggeration.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting places in Asuncion is the market.\r\nParaguayan lace is offered for sale in quantities. It is made in\r\nintricate and dainty designs, and many of the pieces consist of\r\nnumerous small “wheels” or squares that are made separately and then\r\nunited to form collars, handkerchiefs, or covers. One is astonished\r\nat the quantity of fruit displayed; oranges are brought from the\r\nsurrounding country in cars and barges, and shovelled, like coal, into\r\npiles or carts. Some of them are of large size, delicate texture,\r\nand excellent flavor. The choicest of these are exported and may be\r\npurchased in Buenos Aires at rather high prices.\r\n\r\nAfter spending a few days at Asuncion we were invited to the home of\r\none Professor Fiebrig, who lives at Trinidad, a few miles from the\r\ncity. Professor Fiebrig is a scientist of more than local note, an\r\ninstructor in the University of Paraguay, and curator of the museum.\r\nWhile journeying to his place we entered into conversation with two\r\nParaguayans, apparently men of the upper class, who were travelling in\r\nthe same car. When they learned our identity they shook their heads\r\nin a pitying and condescending manner. “How sad,” said one of them;\r\n“you North Americans do nothing but pursue the almighty dollar. Now,\r\nin Paraguay we live for art, literature, and science.” We had visited\r\nthe natural history museum in Asuncion a few days before, and had\r\ntaken note of the bullet-holes in the walls, the rents made in the\r\nstuffed animals by bayonet thrusts, and other marks decidedly not of an\r\nartistic or scientific nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Camp on the Rio Negro in the Gran Chaco of the Paraguay.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Selling oranges in the market at Asuncion.]\r\n\r\nOur first zoological work was done in the country near Trinidad. All\r\nabout were tracts of land of considerable size, covered with low\r\nforest, patches of brush country, grassy fields, and cultivated\r\nplots. Birds were plentiful, and as practically all of them were new\r\nto us, work in this region was doubly interesting. We here formed our\r\nfirst intimate acquaintance with the white ani (Guira), member of a\r\nsubfamily of cuckoos, large flocks of which sat like rows of beads\r\non the fronds of palm-trees. They are slender birds, about fifteen\r\ninches long, and are striped with brown, black, and white; a row of\r\nlong, narrow feathers forms a high crest. They remained soberly on\r\ntheir perches, awkwardly jerked their tails from side to side, and\r\nmewed dolefully. The birds seemed utterly out of place among the\r\nvivacious tanagers, creepers, and finches, and seemed to belong more\r\nproperly to some remote and unrecorded past. Their flight is slow and\r\nuncertain, the birds flapping their wings and sailing alternately;\r\nwhen alighting they strike a most ludicrous pose and barely avert\r\nfalling over frontward before finally securing their balance. The long\r\ntail helps the bird to keep its equilibrium, although adding to the\r\nawkwardness of its appearance. The bird always gives one the impression\r\nof being exceedingly miserable, and particularly so during cold, rainy\r\nweather. Then all the members of the flock will crowd close together\r\nfor warmth and protection, often placing their wings over one another\r\nin an affectionate manner, and even standing perhaps on the backs\r\nof their companions. On account of its scanty covering of feathers,\r\n_Guira guira_ is not well suited to resist cold weather. When the\r\nbreeding-season arrives a huge nest is built in a cactus or low bush,\r\nusually at no great height from the ground; but the mass of sticks is\r\nnot conspicuous, despite its bulky size. Occasionally a number of birds\r\noccupy the same nest, when many eggs are laid; the adults keep up a\r\nconstant wailing and shrieking if their domicile is approached.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are among the most beautiful laid by any bird. They are\r\nelliptical in form and of a deep turquoise color, covered with a\r\nlace-work deposit of calcareous material. As incubation advances the\r\nshell becomes stained and the white, decorative layer wears away where\r\nthe eggs rub together. Then the heretofore lovely egg bursts, and from\r\nit emerges the ugliest creature imaginable. Apparently the natives\r\ncan think of no homelier object, for when they wish to call attention\r\nto the fact that one of their neighbor’s children is of a superlative\r\ndegree of ugliness, they call it _Pichón de Urraca_ (young urraca).\r\n\r\nMammalian life was scarce, but considering the short time available, a\r\ncomparatively representative collection was made, including specimens\r\nof a small gray wolf (_Cerdocyon_), which roamed singly and in pairs in\r\nthe country bordering the Paraguay River. A few rabbits and opossums\r\nvisited the mandioc-fields at night to feed upon the succulent tubers.\r\nWe had abundant opportunities to observe the rural populace in the\r\nvicinity of Trinidad. They are of a rather unambitious type, and seemed\r\ncontented only when taking their noonday nap or _siesta_, or while\r\ndrinking _maté_. The general language of Paraguay is Guaraní, although\r\nSpanish is used by the upper classes.\r\n\r\n“Yerba maté” is the modern name for the _caá guazú_ of the Guaraní.\r\nIt is applied to the dried leaves of a species of South American\r\nholly (_Ilex_) growing abundantly in parts of Brazil, Argentina, and\r\nParaguay. The tree is very bushy and beautiful, and remains green\r\nthe year around; the leaves are small, and those of a light-green\r\ncolor make the best quality of tea. Several methods are employed in\r\ngathering the leaves: one is to cut down the branches, pile them into\r\nhuge stacks, and apply heat for about twenty-four hours, when they\r\nare dry and ready for the next stage of manufacture, consisting of\r\npulverization. The heating and drying process is known as torrefaction.\r\nIn preparing the beverage a quantity of the powdered leaves, and\r\nsometimes sugar, also, are placed in a small, hollowed gourd, and\r\nthe container is then filled with boiling water. The liquor is taken\r\nthrough a metal tube called _bombilla_, with a hollow, spoon-shaped\r\nexpansion filled with small holes on the end that is placed in the\r\ngourd. It is customary to refill the container with water many times\r\nbefore recharging it with leaves, and to pass it around among all the\r\nmembers of a family and any guests who chance to be present. Everybody\r\ndrinks in turn from the same maté and tube. A kettle of boiling water\r\nis kept on a charcoal brazier near at hand. Some of the containers or\r\nmatés are very elaborate affairs, made of pure silver and elegantly\r\ncarved or chased.\r\n\r\nThe amount of _yerba maté_ consumed annually is enormous. It is\r\nestimated that no less than ten millions of persons in South America\r\nindulge in the habit. In Chile the annual consumption per capita is\r\nabout one hundred and twelve pounds; in Paraguay thirty-four pounds,\r\nand in the Argentine twenty pounds. Quantities of it are also exported,\r\nprincipally to Holland. Some years the supply falls short of the\r\ndemand, but plantations have added very materially to the available\r\nwild growth.\r\n\r\n_Yerba maté_ has much in common with both tea and coffee, but does not\r\ncontain as much tannin as either; of caffein it contains about as much\r\nas coffee, and this imparts to it the sustaining virtues. In many parts\r\nof the maté-drinking belt the beverage only is taken for breakfast,\r\nand I have seen a man in western Argentina take thirty-two matéfuls in\r\nrapid succession. The flavor is very agreeable and not unlike that of\r\nrather strong tea.\r\n\r\nAfter spending a few days at Trinidad we returned to Asuncion. A launch\r\nwas placed at our disposal, through the courtesy of the President of\r\nthe republic, and on November 11 we started on a short voyage up the\r\nRio Pilcomayo, into the Gran Chaco of Paraguay. Several men had been\r\nsent with us to look after the luggage, which was carried in a separate\r\nboat towed behind the launch, and three local naturalists, representing\r\nthe museum of Asuncion, went along to collect specimens for their\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\nThe Pilcomayo is a river of great size, coming from the northeast\r\nand emptying into the Paraguay a short distance above Asuncion. The\r\ngreater part of its course is in the Gran Chaco, a wild, uninviting\r\nregion inhabited by savage Indian tribes, and of the interior of\r\nwhich practically nothing is known. We proceeded up the river but\r\na comparatively short distance to the little settlement of Porto\r\nGallileo, the headquarters of a concern engaged in extracting tannin\r\nfrom quebracho-logs. A comfortable home had been erected for the\r\nmanagement, and their attention and courtesy were most touching. They\r\nwere a polyglot community, consisting of a Frenchman, a Brazilian,\r\na Swede, an Argentinian, a Paraguayan, and a German. However, they\r\nlived on the friendliest possible terms, and all co-operated for the\r\ngeneral good of the company. We came unexpectedly, so no preparations\r\nhad been made for our accommodation; but each man had a private store\r\nof treasured articles from home hidden away somewhere, and before long\r\none brought sheets, another blankets, a third monogrammed towels, etc.,\r\nuntil we were as comfortably provided for as any one could wish. The\r\nmen were very fond of a pet jaguar which they had taken when a cub,\r\nbut as the animal grew older its temper became uncertain, so it was\r\nnecessary to confine it in a barred cage. Its wild brethren came from\r\nthe forest at night to pay it a short visit occasionally, as attested\r\nby the footprints left in the soft ground near the cage.\r\n\r\nThe factory at Porto Gallileo for the manufacture of tannin was of\r\nconsiderable size. Upon arrival from the forest the trees were stripped\r\nof bark, ground, and boiled in huge vats. The extract was boiled down\r\nto a concentrate and pressed into small cakes; it is very valuable in\r\ntanning hides, and its use shortens the time usually required for the\r\nprocess. A number of valuable by-products are also obtained, including\r\ndyestuffs.\r\n\r\nA narrow-gauge railway line was being built farther and farther\r\ninto the interior as the land was cleared; this had been completed\r\na distance of fifteen kilometers, and the road-bed was in course of\r\nconstruction for forty additional kilometres. The morning after our\r\narrival at Porto Gallileo we proceeded to the end of the line on the\r\ndaily work-train, and pitched camp on the bank of a small stream, the\r\nRio Negro.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A street in Buenos Aires.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Porto Gallileo on the Rio Pilcomayo.]\r\n\r\nOur camp was merely a rough shed built of sheets of corrugated iron\r\nsupported on poles driven into the ground. The river-water was salt\r\nand unfit for use, so each morning several large jugs of fresh\r\ndrinking-water were sent in from Porto Gallileo, together with a supply\r\nof provisions. All about lay marshes, swamps, and large grass-covered\r\nareas, the latter type of country predominating.\r\n\r\nThe Rio Negro teemed with a species of _piranha_. They are deep-bodied\r\nand blunt-nosed, and the jaws are armed with sharp, triangular teeth.\r\nAlthough they grow to a length of eighteen inches in the Orinoco and\r\nsome of the other large South American rivers, those we found in the\r\nRio Negro did not exceed eight inches in length; but they travelled\r\nin enormous schools, and made up in numbers what they lacked in size.\r\nDuring the hours of late afternoon, when our day’s work was over, I\r\ntried many experiments with the _piranhas_. They have a bad reputation\r\nand are known to attack animals much larger than themselves, and even\r\nhuman beings who enter the water. Usually they are slow to attack\r\nunless their appetite has been whetted by a taste of blood from a\r\nwound; then, however, their work is done with lightning-like quickness,\r\nand unless the luckless victim succeeds in reaching the shore\r\nimmediately nothing but the skeleton will remain within a very short\r\ntime. If I fished with a hook and line baited with any kind of raw meat\r\nthe fish would scarcely wait for the bait to sink below the surface\r\nof the water. The number caught depended entirely upon the amount of\r\ntime spent in fishing. The bodies of large mammals, such as monkeys,\r\nafter we had skinned them, were thrown into the stream; instantly\r\nthe ravenous hordes charged the spot and tore greedily at the bloody\r\nflesh; so great were their numbers that they threw one another out of\r\nthe water in their mad struggles to reach the gory repast. On several\r\noccasions I threw dead or stunned individuals of their species into\r\nthe midst of the frenzied mob, but, strange to relate, they floated on\r\nthe surface of the water untouched. Unplucked birds were not molested,\r\neither. A struggle in the water seems to attract the fish, but I must\r\nadmit that their behavior is very erratic. While washing my hands in\r\nthe edge of the stream one day a _piranha_ snapped a piece out of a\r\nfinger; a few days later a man in passing over the river on a bridge\r\ndropped his purse into the water in almost the exact spot where I\r\nfished, and where the _piranhas_ were most abundant; he stripped, waded\r\nout very slowly and cautiously so as not to create a disturbance, and\r\nfelt about with his toes for the lost article; although the water was\r\nover four feet deep and he remained in it fully fifteen minutes, he\r\nremained untouched.\r\n\r\nIt is in the dark swamps dotting the chaco like low, glossy islands\r\nthat the precious quebracho-trees grow. It was also from these same\r\nswamps that clouds of ravenous mosquitoes issued with the first signs\r\nof failing daylight, and drove us to the refuge of our net-covered\r\nhammocks. There we sweltered through the long hours of the night,\r\nlistening to the angry buzzing of our outwitted assailants, which\r\nwas not unlike the sound produced by a swarm of enraged bees. I\r\ncould distinguish a number of different pitches and qualities in the\r\nmusic, blending harmoniously in one general chorus. The varying size\r\nof the insects, which ranged from individuals nearly an inch long to\r\nthe small infection-bearing _Anopheles_, doubtless accounts for the\r\ndifferent tones produced by the vibrations of the wings. Brockets\r\nwere seen occasionally; they left the forest morning and night to\r\nfeed. In the tall pampas-grass cavies abounded. They came out into the\r\nopening beside the railroad just before sunrise and ran about, or sat\r\nmotionless, when they resembled clods of earth or shadows. Ocelots had\r\nworn well-defined paths through the fields in their nightly raids on\r\nthe cavy community. In the trees we found black howlers, night-monkeys,\r\nand giant weasels (_Tayra_); opossums and various species of small\r\nrodents held sway on the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fort of Coimbra on the Rio Paraguay.]\r\n\r\nWhile there was no scarcity of birds, they were largely species already\r\nknown to us, and one day one of the men brought in an anaconda ten feet\r\nlong, that he found basking on the river-bank.\r\n\r\nAfter spending a week on the Rio Negro we returned to Asuncion, where\r\nwe were joined by the commissaries who had just arrived with the\r\nequipment. Two days later we boarded the comfortable little steamer\r\n_Asuncion_ and started for Corumbá.\r\n\r\nThe four and a half days’ trip up the Paraguay was most interesting,\r\nalthough the heat and insects at times were troublesome. We had entered\r\nthe great pantanal country, and the vast marshes teemed with bird-life.\r\nAs the _Asuncion_ fought the strong current and moved slowly onward\r\ncountless thousands of cormorants and anhingas took wing; lining the\r\npools and dotting the marshes were hordes of wood and scarlet ibises,\r\ntogether with a sprinkling of herons and spoonbills; egrets covered the\r\nsmall clumps of trees as with a mantle of snowy white, and long rows of\r\njabiru storks patrolled both shores. Scarcely a moment passed in which\r\nwe did not see hundreds of birds. Some of the passengers were armed\r\nwith rifles and revolvers, with which they kept up more or less of a\r\nfusillade on the feathered folk; but fortunately their aim was poor so\r\nthat little injury was inflicted.\r\n\r\nThe day before reaching Corumbá we passed an interesting old landmark.\r\nIt is the fort of Coimbra, built on a rocky hillside with a cluster of\r\nthatch-roofed huts nestling against the base. As Coimbra is near the\r\nBolivian border, the fort figured prominently in several of the bloody\r\ncontroversies of bygone years between the neighboring republics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nHUNTING EXCURSIONS ALONG THE UPPER PARAGUAY\r\n\r\n\r\nCorumbá is a very hot, dusty town built on a high, rocky elevation on\r\nthe west bank of the Paraguay. The settlement bears the unenviable\r\nreputation of being the rendezvous for fugitives from justice from many\r\nclimates, but we saw nothing of the lawlessness and disorder said to\r\nprevail, and the treatment we received was all that could be desired.\r\nThe heat at midday was great, but frequently a breeze came up at night.\r\nRows of low, spreading mimosa-trees lined some of the streets and cast\r\na welcome shade; their branches were covered with clumps of gorgeous\r\nscarlet flowers.\r\n\r\nA railroad in course of construction will soon connect Corumbá with\r\nRio de Janeiro. There is also a cart trail leading through the heart\r\nof the chaco to Santa Cruz, Bolivia; to travel over it is a difficult\r\nundertaking, the ox-drawn carts requiring a minimum of thirty days\r\nfor the trip. During the rainy season a large part of the country is\r\ninundated, when the caravans must, of course, suspend their activity.\r\nI met two men who had made this journey but a short time before. One\r\nnight a party of Indians attacked and killed all the members of a\r\ncaravan, stopping only a half-mile distant from the spot where one of\r\nthese men and his family had made their camp. The tribes along this\r\nroute are the Penoquies, Guaranokas, and Potoreras, and they are said\r\nto be of a treacherous, hostile disposition.\r\n\r\nAs there was little zoological work to be done in the immediate\r\nvicinity of Corumbá, we moved to a place called Urucúm, about nine\r\nmiles away. The road lay through scrub growth and forest, and was all\r\nbut impassable on account of the deep mud and rocks. Numbers of native\r\ncabins are scattered along the wayside; some of the occupants conduct\r\ndairy-farms, and the cows carry bells tied to the tips of their horns.\r\n\r\nUrucúm proved to be a garden spot of clear, cold springs, shady\r\ngroves, and plantations of tropical fruits and vegetables. In the\r\ncentre of all stood comfortable cottages with large, well-ventilated\r\nrooms and delightful shower-baths. Fields and forested hillsides,\r\nmarshes, and lagoons were easy of access; in them dwelt an abundant\r\nand varied fauna. A grove of magnificent mango-trees grew near the\r\nhouse that had been assigned for our use; hundreds of bats came to the\r\ntrees each morning just as dawn was breaking, to seek their diurnal\r\nsleeping-quarters among the dense foliage. They arrived in unbroken\r\nstreams and spent a great deal of time whirring through the branches,\r\nsqueaking and making queer little noises that sounded as if they were\r\ngrating their teeth. Then they finally settled in clusters of from\r\nsix to a dozen individuals in some particularly thick clump of leaves\r\nand, suspended by the claws of their hind feet, began their daytime\r\nslumbers. On windy or rainy days they lost little time in becoming\r\nsettled, and did not seek the swaying branches, but clung to the\r\ntree-trunks or on the under-side of the thick limbs. This species of\r\nbat (_Vampyrops lineatus_) has a leaf-shaped appendage on top of the\r\nnose which may be of some use to the animal, but is probably of little\r\nconsequence. This “leaf,” the nose and face, including the tips of the\r\nears, were tinged with delicate green. As the bats hung head downward,\r\nthe green-tinted extremity naturally pointed toward the earth; but if\r\nthe color was intended as a protection it was of little or no avail,\r\nas it could not be seen unless the animal was examined at close range.\r\nOther individuals of the same species were collected in a dark cave in\r\nthe near-by mountains. They, however, showed only a very faint or no\r\ntrace at all of the green coloring on the face. I am convinced that\r\nthis color is not a vegetable stain, but that the pigment exists in the\r\nskin; it fades soon after death.\r\n\r\nA footpath leading through the forest a distance of several miles\r\nended at a manganese-mine which penetrated into the mountainside about\r\nthree hundred feet. Although the mine had been by no means exhausted,\r\nit was no longer worked, owing to the great expense of transporting\r\nthe ore. The dark, deserted tunnel was an ideal resort for bats of\r\nnot less than four species; one of them (_Mimon bennetti_) was of\r\nconsiderable size. We entered the mine with a lighted candle, but\r\nthe bats invariably soon put out the light with their wings. Each\r\nkind, it seemed, occupied a different part of the tunnel. At first\r\nthey were slow to leave their places of concealment in the crevices\r\nbetween the rocks, but after a few days’ persecution numbers of them\r\nrushed from the mine and disappeared over the top of the mountain at\r\nthe mere appearance of the lighted candle in the entrance. The men who\r\naccompanied me on these excursions refused to enter the dark opening in\r\nthe mountainside, as they said it was infested with poisonous snakes;\r\nbut, although we explored it thoroughly on several occasions, not a\r\nsingle reptile was ever seen.\r\n\r\nIn walking through the forest we always saw animals that were of\r\nmore than passing interest. One day I surprised a tiger-cat in the\r\ntrail; it ran a few yards and then started up a tree, rapidly climbing\r\nabout twenty-five feet, and then clung to the rough bark; it remained\r\nperfectly motionless and permitted me to walk up to within a short\r\ndistance of the base of the tree. A short time later I came upon two\r\ncebus monkeys feeding in the branches above the trail. I shot at one of\r\nthem, wounding it. The other was fully ten yards away, but rushed to\r\nthe rescue, and taking up the wounded animal started off with it at a\r\nrapid pace. Most South American monkeys will promptly desert a comrade\r\nin danger or trouble, but in this instance it was a female with her\r\ntwo-thirds-grown offspring, and the mother-love was so much stronger\r\nthan her fear that she exposed herself to danger without hesitation, in\r\nsaving her distressed young.\r\n\r\nOne of the most surprising animals encountered in the forest was a\r\nlarge, red, hairy armadillo (_Euphractus_). It sprang up suddenly,\r\nalmost beneath one’s feet, and bounded away with such great speed that\r\nit always reminded me of a boulder hurtling down a hillside. Within\r\na few moments it was lost from view among the undergrowth, but the\r\nbumping noise as it struck the earth at each jump could be heard for\r\nsome time after the animal had disappeared. At night these armadillos\r\ncame out into the clearings and did a great deal of damage in the\r\nfields newly planted in corn. We desired to trap some of the creatures,\r\nso, following the advice of the natives, we cleared a path one thousand\r\nmetres long and one metre wide on the edge of the field, and next to\r\nthe forest. Four salt-barrels were sunk in this cleared lane, their\r\ntops flush with the earth; then we covered the openings with a thin\r\nlayer of dried grass. Grains of corn were strewn all along the cleared\r\nstretch, and a liberal amount was sprinkled on the grass covering the\r\npits. The armadillos, in their nocturnal excursions from and to the\r\nforest, were attracted by the line of corn and followed it, eating the\r\nkernels as they went; when they arrived at one of the barrels they\r\nplunged into it and were unable to clamber out. We caught several\r\nin this manner. One of them was despatched to the Bronx Zoological\r\nPark, but it died _en route_. It is a remarkable fact that after the\r\narmadillos fell into the barrels, which contained no wooden bottoms,\r\nthey made no attempt to burrow out. Their long claws and strong limbs\r\nenable them to dig with ease and rapidity. When cornered they fight\r\nviciously with the claws and teeth and are capable of inflicting\r\ndangerous wounds.\r\n\r\nOne of the owners of Urucúm stated that at one time he owned a pet\r\njaguar that subsisted entirely on armadillos caught in the manner\r\ndescribed above. The flesh is esteemed by the people, also.\r\n\r\nOn several occasions we saw the gaping entrance to the tunnel of a\r\n_Tatu canasto_, or giant armadillo, but at no time did we have a\r\nglimpse of its occupant. This is one of the curious, archaic creatures\r\npersisting, together with the giant ant-bear, sloth, and hoatzin, long\r\nafter the star of their age has passed its zenith. Apparently they\r\nwere not at all uncommon, for we saw scores of the enormous carapaces,\r\nlooking like casques of armor, in the curio-shops at Asuncion. The\r\nanimal is fully four feet long, and weighs upward of sixty pounds. A\r\nsingle claw that I found on the Upper Orinoco was seven inches long.\r\n\r\nAnother visitor to the plantations was a kind of small, red forest-deer\r\nor brocket (_Mazama_) with single-spike horns. They spent the days in\r\nthe heavy timber or dense, low thickets and wild banana-brakes. They\r\nwere particularly fond of growing beans and destroyed quantities of the\r\nlegumes in a single night. The natives’ way of ridding themselves of\r\nthe plunderer is to erect a high platform on poles in the centre of the\r\nfield, commanding a view on all sides, and then shoot the animal as it\r\nemerges from its hiding-place.\r\n\r\nWe also secured a good specimen of one of the rarest animals found\r\nin South America. It is the red wolf (_Chrysocyon_), or guaraguasú,\r\nof the Brazilians. However, very little is known of the animal’s\r\nhabits even by the Indians and natives who are usually so prolific\r\nwith stories about the wild creatures coming under their observation.\r\nMy own experience is limited to two fleeting glances of the huge red\r\nforms dashing away at breakneck speed several hundred yards distant,\r\nand to hearing the weird, strange wail at night. It equals or exceeds\r\nin size the gray wolf of our north woods. It is said to live singly,\r\nfrequenting the _chapadão_ and papyrus marshes, and to travel great\r\ndistances in quest of rabbits, cavies, and other small mammals that\r\nform its principal items of food.\r\n\r\nThere were also peccaries, black howler monkeys and marmosettes, and\r\namong the smaller mammals living in the deep forest was a curious\r\nlittle woolly opossum (_Metachirus_) that ventured out only after dark\r\nin search of fruits, insects, birds, or almost anything of an edible\r\nnature. It is essentially an animal of the deep shadows; if taken\r\nout into the brilliant sunshine it dies within a very short time.\r\nFrequently our traps were sprung by black lizards three or four feet\r\nlong (_Dracæna_); they fought fiercely and clung tenaciously to a stick\r\nor other object within their reach. Their teeth are so strong that they\r\nscratched the steel barrel of a shotgun. Rattlesnakes were not rare in\r\nthe open country, but they were of small size; I saw none more than\r\nthree feet long.\r\n\r\nAmong the hosts of birds parrakeets were by far the most abundant.\r\nThey came to the mango-trees by hundreds and were so noisy that they\r\nbecame a decided nuisance. In feeding they frequently took a bite or\r\ntwo out of a fruit and then, letting it fall, proceeded to another. In\r\nthis way a great amount was wasted, but the people were good-natured\r\nover the matter and doubtless realized that there was fruit enough for\r\nall, as they never molested the parrakeets. Many of the birds were\r\nnesting. A red-breasted thrush (_Planesticus_), not unlike the robin,\r\nhad its mud and grass nest in the low crotch of a tree on the edge of\r\nthe forest, but the three eggs were heavily speckled with rusty brown\r\ninstead of being of a plain-blue color. There were cunning little pigmy\r\nowls in the brush-patches, but in spite of their small size they are\r\nvery bold and ferocious and kill birds nearly as large as themselves.\r\nIn turn they are preyed upon by members of their own family. Some of\r\nthe larger owls habitually catch small owls whenever possible. One day\r\nmy attention was attracted by a commotion in a clump of dense bushes\r\nand, as I neared the spot, an owl of moderate size (_Ciccaba_) made a\r\nnumber of attempts to fly up from the ground, but apparently it was\r\ncarrying something too heavy to permit it to fly. Finally it deserted\r\nthe object and flew to a branch a few yards away. Going to the spot, I\r\nfound a screech owl with a portion of its head eaten away. Pigmy owls\r\nare eagerly sought for by the natives. They become very tame and are\r\nsupposed to bring good luck to their owners. We had brought a small\r\nowl of another species with us which had been named “Moses.” When we\r\nfound him in the market at Asuncion he was a forlorn and hungry little\r\ncreature, but showed such a friendly disposition that he was promptly\r\npurchased and soon became the very popular mascot of the expedition. At\r\nUrucúm Moses was given his liberty among the rafters of our home; he\r\nwalked about gravely overhead and came down only when hungry or when\r\nthe half-filled wash-basin lured him to the delights of a cool bath.\r\nSometimes I put him out in a tree for an airing, but carnivorous ants\r\nwere abundant and nearly always discovered him before very long; then\r\nhe danced about, clattered with his bill, and made queer little cooing\r\nnoises until I rescued him.\r\n\r\nWe spent nearly three weeks at Urucúm. They passed very quickly, for\r\nUrucúm is one of those delightful places found all too rarely in South\r\nAmerica. Word reached us that Colonel Roosevelt and his Brazilian\r\nescort had reached Corumbá, so we hastened back to town; there we met\r\nthe entire party and made the acquaintance of Colonel Rondon and the\r\nother members of the Brazilian Commission.\r\n\r\nA hunting-trip on the Taquary had been planned to secure some of the\r\nlarge game that is found in the region. December 16, therefore, found\r\nthe hunting-party aboard the _Nyoac_. This boat, which was a river\r\nsteamer of considerable size, had been placed at the disposal of the\r\nexpedition by the government, and served as our “home” during the weeks\r\nthat followed, until we reached Porto Campo. Besides Colonel Roosevelt,\r\nthere were on board Colonel Candido Mariano da Silva Rondon, Kermit\r\nRoosevelt, Captain Amilcar de Magalhães, a photographer, physician,\r\ntaxidermist, and myself. Mr. Cherrie had returned to Urucúm to finish\r\nthe work in that locality, and Mr. Fiala remained in Corumbá to\r\ncomplete the examination of the enormous amount of impedimenta which he\r\nhad so ably brought together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: S. S. _Nyoac_ on the Paraguay River.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Corumbá.]\r\n\r\nThe _Nyoac_ steamed up the Paraguay a few hours, and then turned\r\ninto the mouth of the Taquary. The water of the latter river being\r\npretty low, a steam-launch was towed along as a precaution; should\r\nthe steamer become stranded it would have been possible to proceed\r\non the launch. We had been travelling but a short time, when cries\r\nfrom members of the crew drew our attention to the water; and there,\r\nwhere the launch had been but a moment before, were only a few sticks\r\nof fire-wood floating on the water. A man had been placed aboard the\r\nsmaller craft to operate the steering-gear; he had fallen asleep at his\r\npost, and in rounding a sharp bend the launch had capsized and sunk. We\r\nspent several hours trying to drag the submerged boat to the bank, but\r\nthe task had to be abandoned, and the launch was left--a total loss.\r\n\r\nThere were scores of caimans along the Taquary. As these reptiles are\r\njustly classed as vermin they may be destroyed on sight. Frequently\r\nrows of them dotted the edges of the sand-banks, lying with wide-open\r\nmouths. A shot in the head was instantly fatal, and the only movement\r\nperceptible was the sudden closing of the mouth as the bullet went\r\nhome. Crocodiles frequently enter the forest to quite some distance\r\nfrom the water; I know of no more repulsive sight than to come\r\nsuddenly upon one of the huge saurians lying quietly in wait among the\r\nshadows; the evil, grinning expression; the leering green eyes and the\r\nglistening, scaly body of the creature suggest treachery and cruelty\r\ncombined with agility and cunning. One of the reptiles that we saw had\r\ncornered a school of fish in a small inlet, blocking the entrance with\r\nits body. As the frantic fish tried to escape by jumping out of the\r\nwater and over the obstruction, the crocodile caught them in mid-air\r\nand swallowed them.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon we saw a giant ant-eater galloping across a\r\ngrassy field. The steamer was brought to the bank instantly and a\r\nhunting-party with dogs landed. Soon the animal was brought to bay and\r\nshot. When it was brought aboard darkness had set in, so no photograph\r\ncould be made of it, and as game spoils within a few hours in the damp,\r\nhot climate, the animal could not be left until morning. We took the\r\nnecessary measurements, skinned the creature, and then spread the hide\r\nout on the upper deck. Later we found that the tamanduá bandado, as it\r\nis called, was not at all rare in the _pantanales_. This occasioned\r\nsome surprise, as a great deal of this country is marshy and there are\r\nconsequently few termites, on which it was thought to feed exclusively.\r\nRecent observations by Mr. Cherrie, however, explain why this animal\r\ncan exist in the _pantanal_ type of country. He found it _climbing\r\ntrees_ and devouring the soft part of nestling birds, both of which\r\nacts are about the last things one would expect of such a highly\r\nspecialized animal.\r\n\r\nThe tamanduá bandado stands about two feet high and is six feet long.\r\nThe body is covered with long, coarse hair. The color is gray. A\r\nbroad black band, bordered with white, begins on the chest and passes\r\nobliquely over the shoulder, ending in a point as it approaches the\r\nloins. This marking gives the animal a peculiar, “cut-up” appearance.\r\nThe nose is greatly elongated, and the mouth is a mere slit through\r\nwhich the pensile tongue is thrust in licking up ants. As it gallops\r\nclumsily along, for the enormous back-turned claws of the front feet\r\nimpede its progress, the flattened tail is thrown up and seems to aid\r\nin balancing the animal. When pursued by either men or dogs, it runs\r\nuntil closely pressed, and then rears up and makes short dashes at\r\nits assailants. It is easily capable of inflicting fatal wounds with\r\nits claws. P. Lydekker (Royal Natural History) states that its habits\r\nare nocturnal and that it has “usually a regular lair ... generally\r\nsituated among tall grass, where it spends the day in slumber....” In\r\nthe same paragraph he speaks of the animal tearing open the hillocks of\r\ntermites with the powerful claws of the forefeet; and “as soon as the\r\nlight of day is let into their domicile the ants or termites rush to\r\nthe surface....” Without commenting on this inconsistency, I believe\r\nthat the giant ant-eater is at least partially diurnal. The stomachs\r\nof the specimens shot by Colonel Roosevelt and his son Kermit contained\r\nants and termites, a quantity of earth, and bits of dry and green\r\nleaves. The colonel expressed the opinion that the earth and leaves\r\nhad been picked up with the ants. The walls of the stomach are thick\r\nand muscular, like the gizzard of a fowl. In captivity they thrive on\r\nfinely chopped meat.\r\n\r\nWe spent the night aboard the _Nyoac_, which had been made fast at a\r\nlanding where there was only a dilapidated thatched-roof shed. Early\r\nthe next morning horses were brought up and saddled and we started on a\r\nfive hours’ ride to the ranch-house that was to serve as camp.\r\n\r\nBefore us stretched vast marshes, dotted here and there with little\r\nislands of pastureland and groves of trees or thorny bushes. It was\r\ntypical pantanal country. Parrots, parrakeets, and macaws flashed by\r\nwith raucous shrieks, and _kis-ka-dee_ flycatchers calmly surveyed the\r\ncavalcade from the uppermost branches. Sometimes we flushed a small\r\nflock of beautiful Brazilian teals, and in the distance we saw ibises\r\nand jabiru storks standing in the long grass, like foam-flecks on a sea\r\nof green. For the greater part of the distance we rode through water\r\nknee-deep to the horses, but in spots the marshes were drying. In the\r\nlittle pools that were all that remained of what had formerly, perhaps,\r\nbeen an immense lagoon, myriads of imprisoned fish wriggled and churned\r\nthe water into thin mud. They formed an almost solid mass, and at the\r\nborders numbers were constantly leaping out; the ground was strewn with\r\nthe dead and dying by thousands, and of many species. The stench from\r\nthe decomposing fish was almost overpowering. Numerous animals coming\r\nout of their hiding-places at night to gorge on the bountiful repast\r\nleft their foot-prints in the soft mud. Apparently opossums, coatis,\r\ntiger-cats, and even jaguars haunted these places. In the daytime the\r\ncountless numbers of water-birds exacted their share of the spoil.\r\n\r\nThe _fazenda_, or ranch-house, called Palmiras’, was reached at noon.\r\nIt was an interesting place; the long, low, rambling buildings formed\r\na square with an open court in the centre, in which trees and flowers\r\ngrew and pigs and chickens roamed at will. All about lay marshes,\r\npapyrus swamp, fields, and forests. Herds of half-wild cattle grazed on\r\nthe vast range, and marsh-deer stalked among them or along the borders\r\nof the thick papyrus growths. The main object of this excursion was\r\nto obtain the lordly jaguar. Men were sent out to locate fresh spoor\r\nof the animals, and after a several days’ hunt were successful. Then\r\na motley cavalcade, headed by the colonel, set out to find the big,\r\nspotted cat. Some of the party rode horses or mules, and a number\r\nof natives were mounted on steers. A pack of dogs, used to tree the\r\nquarry, trotted excitedly beside the riders. After many hours the faint\r\ncall of a bugle far away announced the return of the hunting-party.\r\nOther bugles took up the signal, and by the time camp was reached\r\nall of the natives were lined up and eager to inspect the trophies.\r\nWithin a week two jaguars, a second ant-eater, and a few deer had been\r\nsecured. There was not sufficient time to undertake a systematic study\r\nof the bird life, but the species found in the immediate vicinity\r\nof the house were of ample interest to occupy the attention of a\r\nnaturalist for many months. Foremost among them was the hyacinthine\r\nmacaw, largest of the entire parrot family. The dazzling blue creature\r\nis more than a yard long, and the beak is so powerful that it can\r\ngnaw through the tough hull of the _castanha_, or Brazil nut, a feat\r\nunequalled, perhaps, by any other bird. It is a powerful flyer and\r\nusually there were only two or four together; but some of the flocks\r\nwe saw numbered ten or twelve birds. But as a whole, the bird is rare,\r\nand as it inhabits the wildest _pantanales_ and jungles, its graceful\r\nflight and loud screams are one of the rare rewards of those only who\r\nventure far beyond the beaten route of travel. The closet naturalist\r\nmay inspect the stuffed skin, but it can no more convey to him an\r\nimpression of the gorgeous, living bird, than the dry, shrunken bush\r\nat midwinter suggests the flowering rose.\r\n\r\nSmall colonies of blackbirds dwelt in the papyrus swamp. Their heads\r\nwere of a fiery red color, and as they sat on the swaying reeds they,\r\nfrom a distance, resembled brilliant blossoms. However, these birds\r\nwere not abundant.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the skins of large mammals was a difficult\r\nundertaking. No provision had been made for this branch of the work,\r\nas the object of the expedition was not zoological but geographical.\r\nHowever, none of the large game was thrown away; it was skinned and\r\npreserved in the best manner possible under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nReturning to Corumbá on the evening of December 21, we were joined by\r\nthe other members of the expedition and immediately proceeded on the\r\nup-river voyage toward São Luis de Caceres. A short side-trip was made\r\nup the Rio São Lourenço, with brief stops at various points where there\r\nwere evidences of game, but very little was added to the collections.\r\n\r\nOn January 1, early in the morning, we halted at a place where there\r\nwere fresh jaguar tracks on the river-bank. Colonels Roosevelt and\r\nRondon, and Kermit, accompanied by a number of _camaradas_ and the\r\ndogs, immediately took up the trail and disappeared among the trees.\r\nWe spent a part of the day on board the steamer, and the remainder\r\ncollecting in the immediate vicinity. One of the men ran into a nest\r\nof maribundi wasps; one of the enraged insects stung him on the head\r\nand for several hours the poor fellow was in great agony. His head was\r\nswollen to an enormous size, and his companions bathed it constantly\r\nwith water to relieve the pain; they feared he would die. I have very\r\ngood reasons for remembering these wasps. While on the Chaparé River,\r\nin Bolivia, one of them crawled under the mosquito-net covering my\r\ncot; when I retired at night I put my arm on the insect and was stung\r\nfour times before it could be captured. The effect of the poison was\r\nas rapid as it was remarkable. It produced a kind of paralysis within\r\nabout five minutes, which the prompt action alone of my companion\r\nprevented from ending fatally; but more extraordinary still, the\r\nsame symptoms returned regularly at six months’ intervals during the\r\nfollowing two years. Each attack lasted from a week to ten days.\r\n\r\nThe day gradually drew to a close, and finally darkness settled over\r\nthe landscape, but there was no sign of the hunting-party. The captain,\r\ntherefore, began to cruise up and down the river, giving frequent\r\nblasts of the ship’s whistle, for it was feared that the hunters might\r\nhave become lost. After an hour or so we suddenly rounded a sharp bend\r\nand heard a loud voice singing cheerfully somewhere on the bank. A boat\r\nwas sent in the direction whence the sound came, and after a short time\r\nit returned with Colonels Roosevelt and Rondon. They had been pursuing\r\nthe jaguar through forest and swamp for twelve hours on foot, and\r\nwithout food or drink. Their clothing was torn and covered with mud; it\r\nhad been necessary to swim frequently, in their clothes, holding their\r\nrifles above their heads; the lagoons were infested with _piranhas_ and\r\ncrocodiles. In running through the vegetation fire-ants and wasps had\r\nbeen swept from the leaves and branches, and the insects had been quick\r\nto retaliate with bites and stings. But Colonel Roosevelt had enjoyed\r\nthe experience thoroughly and at once sat down to a hearty dinner,\r\nduring the course of which we heard the story of the hunt. Kermit\r\nreturned some hours later. Most of the _camaradas_ were so tired they\r\nspent the night in the forest and did not come in until late the next\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nWe always passed the nights ashore; the temperature in our cabin aboard\r\nthe _Nyoac_ was 118° F., so we much preferred to sling our hammocks\r\namong the trees, where it was cooler. One morning upon awakening I was\r\nsurprised to see the gently waving palm-leaves overhead. It seemed\r\nqueer that I should have forgotten to adjust the mosquito net the\r\nnight before; but an investigation showed that the greater part of the\r\nnetting had been carried away during the night by the _carregador_\r\nants. In my several experiences with these insects I have never known\r\nthem to carry away woollen clothing, but all articles of cotton to\r\nwhich they had access were destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe jabiru storks were nesting on the São Lourenço; we saw several\r\nof their great platform nests of sticks perched in the crotches of\r\ngiant trees. The young storks, two in number and fully feathered, were\r\ncontinually exercising their limbs by running back and forth in the\r\nnest, flapping their wings all the while, preparatory to launching\r\nforth into the big world. If we tossed short sticks up to them they\r\ncaught them in their bills, held on for a few moments, then dropped\r\nthem. Caimans were particularly plentiful on the upper Paraguay. Scores\r\nof the evil-looking reptiles lay on the sand-banks, with wide-open\r\nmouths and staring, glassy eyes. A fringe of trees flanked the water;\r\nthrough them we could see the boundless wastes of _pantanales_ beyond.\r\nTroops of black howler monkeys ambled leisurely away as the boat drew\r\nnear; the males only were black, the females being of a straw-color.\r\nThere were immense flocks of a species of gray-throated, green\r\nparrakeets; some of them were building enormous nests of sticks in\r\nthe branches. When a single tree contained three or four of the huge\r\nstructures, its strength was strained to the breaking-point, for some\r\nof the nests were five or six feet across and contained hundreds of\r\npounds of material; but not all of them were of this size; some were\r\ncomposed of no more than an armful of sticks and were occupied by a\r\nsingle pair of birds. The larger ones harbor dozens of birds. The\r\nnesting cavities had been in the under-side of the structures; entrance\r\nto them was gained through tubular openings underneath.\r\n\r\nThe number of water-birds in the _pantanales_ bordering the upper\r\nParaguay is almost unbelievably large. There were such countless\r\nthousands of cormorants and anhingas that they confused the eye.\r\nColonel Roosevelt never permitted useless slaughter, and when one\r\nday, one of the _camaradas_ forgot himself and shot a bird, he was\r\ncompelled to go for it in a rowboat; then the bird was skinned and\r\npreserved. After that no one ventured to shoot at the winged hosts.\r\nEgrets were present in such vast numbers that the trees were white\r\nwith them; and when they flew the twinkling wings filled the air like\r\nsnowflakes. They were not molested in this locality for the reason\r\nthat their habitat is impenetrable. I later learned in another region\r\nthat thousands of these birds are killed for their plumes, in a most\r\natrocious manner. About the time the egret’s feathers are at their\r\nbest, which is also the time when the nests are filled with young\r\nbirds, the annual floods have begun to recede, leaving small lakes\r\nand marshes teeming with imprisoned fish, such as we had seen _en\r\nroute_ to Rancho Palmiras. This is the season of harvest for the\r\nwater-birds, and they repair daily to some favorite resort to gorge\r\non the luckless fish. The plume-hunters, taking advantage of this\r\ncombination of circumstances, collect quantities of fish, poison them,\r\nand then scatter them over the birds’ feeding-grounds. Occasionally\r\npoisoned shrimp are used if the inundations extend beyond the usual\r\ntime. This method is, of course, cheaper than shooting; the birds are\r\nnot frightened away as they are by the loud reports of guns, and the\r\nsuccess of such relentless persecution must be obvious. A whole colony\r\ncould be exterminated in its feeding-grounds even if the rookery is\r\nimpregnable.\r\n\r\nSão Luis de Caceres was reached January 5, and at noon the next day\r\nthe _Nyoac_ weighed anchor again and started up-stream. A short stop\r\nwas made at a small landing called Porto Campo, where a few days’ hunt\r\nproduced tapirs, deer, and white-lipped peccaries. January 13 found the\r\nexpedition aboard a launch, struggling against the swift current of the\r\nSepotuba. A heavy house-boat full of provisions and luggage was towed\r\nalongside, and we made not over a mile an hour. The end of the river\r\njourney came on January 16. We had reached Tapirapoan, the farthest\r\noutpost on the frontier, and immediately preparations were begun for\r\nour long dash across the _chapadão_ of Matto Grosso.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nA FORTY DAYS’ RIDE THROUGH WILDEST MATTO GROSSO\r\n\r\n\r\nTapirapoan presented a scene of festive gayety upon the arrival of\r\nthe expedition. The large, open square around which clustered the\r\nlow, mud-walled huts was decorated with lines of pennants, while the\r\nAmerican and Brazilian flags fluttered from tall poles in the centre.\r\nFlag raising and lowering were always impressive ceremonies; everybody\r\nlined up and stood at attention while the banners were elevated or\r\ntaken down, as the case might be, to the strains of martial music.\r\nHowever, if Tapirapoan bore a festive outward appearance, it acted\r\nmerely as a mask to cover up the general confusion that even a casual\r\ninspection could not fail to disclose. Numbers of horses, mules, and\r\noxen had been gathered from the surrounding country; an array of\r\nnatives or _camaradas_ who were to have charge of the animals and the\r\nimpedimenta, had assembled, and several warerooms were filled with\r\nprovisions and equipment. To organize properly a cavalcade of such vast\r\nproportions required some little time--in fact just six days. We did\r\nnot particularly regret the delay, for it gave us an opportunity of\r\nmaking daily excursions into the near-by country. This was mostly of an\r\nopen character and yielded no big game, but it teemed with interesting\r\nlittle creatures. Several small tracts of land were fenced in and\r\nplanted in maize, and it was wonderful to note how these restricted\r\nareas had been discovered by small rodents which apparently came\r\nfrom the surrounding wilds, found an abundance of food and favorable\r\nconditions, and multiplied so rapidly that within a short time they\r\nwere so abundant as to be decidedly harmful. One would almost expect\r\ntheir natural enemies to increase in the same proportion, but such\r\nwas obviously not the case. Wherever there was a patch of ground under\r\ncultivation, rats and mice teemed, particularly the latter, belonging\r\nto the genus _Oryzomys_; they are several times the size of a house\r\nmouse, have rather short tails, and are of a very deep brown color. The\r\nsmall burrows in which they live are made at the bases of weed-stalks,\r\nbushes, and under fences and logs; or, lacking these protective agents,\r\nthey dig down into the ground almost anywhere. If one sits still for\r\na few minutes, preferably at dusk, they may see the beady-eyed little\r\nanimals steal forth, whiskers twitching nervously, and ears alert to\r\ncatch any sound which might apprise them of danger. I have never seen\r\nthem go very far from the protection of their underground runways;\r\nand even while nibbling hurriedly at some tempting bit of food, they\r\nfrequently dash away suddenly, then stop short, look around, and come\r\nback--all apparently without the slightest provocation.\r\n\r\nSome of the men had caught a huge tortoise known in various parts of\r\nSouth America as the _morrocoy_, farther down the river. This became\r\na sort of general pet, and while it was at first intended to use\r\n“Lizzie”--for that was the name that had been given to the friendly,\r\ninactive creature--for food, it was later decided that the animal was\r\nworthy of better treatment. It was therefore agreed upon that Lizzie\r\nshould go to the Bronx Zoo. A comfortable crate was constructed, and\r\njust before loading it on the launch bound down-stream, we gathered\r\naround the box and dropped an abundant supply of sliced melon and other\r\nsucculent food through the bars. Then we learned an interesting bit of\r\nnatural history. One of the _camaradas_ had stood by until he thought\r\nenough perfectly good food had been wasted on the tortoise. “Don’t give\r\nher all that,” he advised, “a turtle is just like the camel and the\r\nelephant; it can go six months without eating.” We were glad to learn\r\nlater that Lizzie survived the trip to New York, and proved to be the\r\nlargest of her species in the Zoo collection.\r\n\r\nOrder was finally restored out of chaos, and each member of the party\r\nwas given a mule and a complete saddle outfit. The pack-animals were\r\ndivided into squads, each in charge of a chief mule-man and his\r\nassistants; then the impedimenta were sorted out and arranged for easy\r\nand quick packing on the mules.\r\n\r\nAt noon, January 21, the first detachment of the expedition started.\r\nThis included all of the Americans and several of the Brazilians to\r\nwhose number Lieutenants João Lyra and Joaquin de Melho Filho had been\r\nadded. Captain Amilcar was to follow the next day with the remainder of\r\nthe caravan. This division of the party was absolutely necessary as, on\r\naccount of the great number of men and animals required, the expedition\r\nwould have been unwieldy if it had attempted to move in one body.\r\n\r\nThe first day’s ride was a short one. Early in the morning the men\r\nstarted to load the pack-animals, many of which were apparently fresh\r\nfrom the ranges and had never been broken to work of any kind; as a\r\nresult of this there was a good deal of confusion at first. The corrals\r\nreminded one of a wild-west show. Guachos, wearing fringed leather\r\naprons, and wicked, keen-edged knives in their belts, and who swore\r\nfluently in two or three different languages, lassoed the panicky\r\nanimals, blindfolded them, and adjusted the packs. When the covering\r\nwas removed from the animals’ eyes they frequently gave a few sharp\r\nsnorts, and then started through the corral in a series of rabbit-like\r\nleaps, eventually sending the packs, saddles, and all flying in every\r\ndirection. After freeing themselves of their burden, they gave a few\r\nextra high kicks of exultation, and then ran into the huddled mass of\r\ntheir fellows for concealment. Gradually, however, the men became more\r\nadept at their work, the mules and oxen quieted down and little groups\r\nleft the corrals, wound up the trail, and disappeared in a cloud of\r\ndust.\r\n\r\nOur mounts were good, strong animals. We cantered up the trail at a\r\nbrisk gait while Mr. Fiala, who had gone on a few miles in advance,\r\ntook a motion-picture of the entire outfit, beginning the long journey\r\nthrough wildest Brazil that would end--we knew not where. Unfortunately\r\nMr. Fiala was not present to take a film of the expedition when it\r\nemerged at Manaos; the two pictures side by side would have told an\r\ninteresting story.\r\n\r\nA few hours’ ride through forest and brush-covered country brought us\r\nto the Rio Sepotuba again, but quite some distance above Tapirapoan,\r\nand we crossed the stream on a pontoon made by laying a platform of\r\nboards across three dugout canoes. There were a number of new palm-leaf\r\nhouses on the river-bank, so these were used for the night’s camp\r\ninstead of erecting the tents.\r\n\r\nNext day we were in the saddle by nine, riding through tall virgin\r\nforest with occasional stretches of sandy soil in which an expanse of\r\nlow bushes only grew. It was evident as we penetrated farther into the\r\ninterior that the forest zone was fast disappearing, to be replaced by\r\nthe vast _chapadão_; this latter type of country is high, nearly level,\r\nand covered with widely scattered, stunted trees. The heat was intense;\r\nthere was no rain, but troublesome insects were lacking. At three\r\no’clock we entered an old clearing. Formerly rice, plantains, mandioca,\r\nand corn had been cultivated here, but now the place was deserted and\r\novergrown with weeds. Kilometre 52, as the place was called, had been\r\nan important camp of the telegraph commission while work was being\r\nprosecuted in that region, but had long since been abandoned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Colonel Roosevelt in the Brazilian _chapadão_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A camp in the _chapadão_.]\r\n\r\nOn January 23 a 32-kilometre ride took us to the site of an old Indian\r\nvillage known as Aldeia Queimada, meaning burnt settlement. A single\r\nhut was all that remained, and in this lived two Indian women, each of\r\nwhom had two husbands and a number of small children. We were adhering\r\nclosely to the telegraph-line, following the wide swath that had been\r\ncleared to protect the wires from falling trees and branches, except\r\nwhen a short détour was desirable to find a better crossing for some\r\nsmall stream. The country was of a gently undulatory character,\r\ncovered with wiry grass and a very sparse growth of scrubby, gnarled\r\ntrees. This vegetation is typical of a great part of Matto Grosso. With\r\nthe exception of a few small deer and a limited number of wood-hewers\r\nand jays, there were no evidences of animal life. A clear, cold spring\r\nrippled over a pebbly bottom near our night’s camp. It was the last\r\nstream we should see that discharged its water (via the Sepotuba) into\r\nthe Rio de la Plata system.\r\n\r\nColonel Rondon had employed a number of motor-trucks in constructing\r\nthis section of the telegraph-line; several of them were still in\r\nserviceable condition. It was therefore thought advisable to send a\r\nportion of the baggage ahead on the cars as far as the trail permitted,\r\nand as it would take several days for the rest of the expedition to\r\ncatch up, Mr. Cherrie and I went along to devote to collecting the\r\ntime thus gained. Father Zahm and Mr. Sigg also went in this party.\r\nWe started from a point called Rio Mandioca, two days beyond Aldeia\r\nQueimada. There were three trucks, great, well-built machines of\r\nforeign make, laden to their fullest capacity with the heaviest and\r\nmost cumbersome pieces of equipment. It was a strange sight to see them\r\nracing across the uninhabited _chapadão_ at a speed of thirty miles an\r\nhour. It rained frequently, but the powerful cars charged through the\r\nblinding sheets of falling water, and sent streams of mud flying from\r\nthe inundated trail. Each car was provided with two wide belts of heavy\r\nslats; one of them was fitted over the wheels on each side of the car,\r\nso they formed a sort of endless trail and gave greater traction in the\r\nuneven roadway. Surely this was exploring _de luxe_; but we were to\r\nreach the other extreme before long.\r\n\r\nThe car in which we travelled had a full-blooded Indian mechanician,\r\nwho seemed to be fully initiated into the mysteries of handling an\r\nautomobile, from gathering up branches and stones with which to fill up\r\nthe roadway when the cars mired deep in the loose sand, to repairing\r\nthe engine on the rare occasions when such a procedure was necessary.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the third day we reached a point called Macacos.\r\nA few decaying huts marked the spot, and in them lived a number of\r\nParecís Indians, the first we had seen. They were a wild-looking\r\nlot; some of them wore breech-cloths, others loose, long, shirt-like\r\ngarments, and all had a thick mop of tousled black hair. A few of\r\nthe children were nearly covered with ropes of black beads cut from\r\nsections of thin rattan or bamboo. They rubbed their stomachs with\r\ntheir hands and said “_fome_,” meaning hungry; so we gave them half\r\nof a deer that had been killed a short time before, and they rushed\r\ninto the huts to feast. We continued on a distance of four leagues.\r\nThis brought us to the Rio Sacre--the end of the wide road. The river\r\nis here broken by a fall of one hundred and fifty feet. As elsewhere\r\nin South America, we were impressed with the appalling lack of animal\r\nlife. So far we had seen only a few rheas, a seriema or two, and\r\nseveral small deer.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 29th we crossed the Sacre on a pontoon boat and,\r\nusing a number of mules that had been previously sent there, rode the\r\ntwo leagues to the Parecís Indian village of Utiarity. From afar we\r\ncould hear the deafening roar of water, and the Indians eagerly guided\r\nus to a spot just below the settlement, where the Papagayo rushes over\r\nthe edge of a precipice and falls into the gorge below in one sheer\r\ndrop of two hundred and eighty feet. The river is fully five hundred\r\nfeet wide, and the quantity of clear, cold water it flows is enormous.\r\nThe spectacle of the descending wall of snowy water streaked with\r\nvarious shades of green and blue, the idly floating mist-clouds, and\r\nthe thunderous roar is awe-inspiring. When it is remembered that these\r\nfalls are higher than Niagara, one can easily picture the wonderful\r\nsight that meets the eye of the traveller in this virgin country.\r\n\r\nThe Parecís are a small tribe of semicivilized Indians who live in\r\nsubstantial huts and cultivate fields of mandioca, corn, and sweet\r\npotatoes. Formerly they were far more numerous, but an incessant\r\nwarfare with the neighboring tribes and contact with the outside world\r\nhave thinned their ranks until they are well on the road to extinction.\r\nSome of them wore clothes, while many wore only a breech-cloth of their\r\nown weaving. They also make hammocks and various articles for useful or\r\nornamental purposes.\r\n\r\nIn stature the Parecís is rather short, but he is well built and\r\nsturdy. His color is a light shade of brown. The youths of the tribe\r\nengaged in a curious game of head-ball, using for the purpose a hollow\r\nrubber sphere a foot in diameter, manufactured by themselves. They\r\nchose sides and batted the ball back and forth across a line with their\r\nheads. At no time were the hands or feet used to strike or kick the\r\nball. They displayed remarkable dexterity and tireless energy at this\r\nform of amusement; if the ball came bounding along the ground they made\r\nheadlong dives for it like a baseball-player sliding to home plate.\r\n\r\nOne evening just before sundown practically all of the men joined\r\nin a sacred dance. On this occasion they were clothed in gaudy red\r\nhead-bands, bead neck-chains and belts, also anklets made of bunches\r\nof curious dry seeds that kept up a continuous rattling sound as the\r\ndancers stamped in rhythm with the low, sighing music of reed flutes.\r\nThey stopped at short intervals to drink chicha, and during certain\r\nparts of the dance they sang the names of their dead warriors and\r\nmighty hunters, calling upon them for guidance and assistance. We had\r\npreviously seen a blue-and-yellow macaw about the village; it had the\r\nrun of the place and seemed to be a great favorite with everybody.\r\nWhile the dance was in progress the bird sat disconsolately on top of\r\none of the huts. Then we discovered that the Indians had pulled out its\r\ntail-feathers and used them to decorate their head-dresses.\r\n\r\nThe women were not permitted to witness the first part of the\r\nperformance, but later the dancers visited each home and exacted\r\ntribute from the squaws in the form of several gallons of chicha.\r\n\r\nUtiarity was a profitable collecting-place. Many small rodents and a\r\nfew larger mammals, including a soft-shelled armadillo collected by\r\nColonel Roosevelt, were taken, and a number of birds besides. We spent\r\nfive days in the village (Colonel Roosevelt arrived three days after\r\nwe did), at the end of which time Father Zahm and Mr. Sigg started\r\nback home. A short time later Mr. Fiala left the expedition for his\r\ntrip down the unexplored Papagayo. Mr. Fiala undertook this work\r\nvoluntarily, well realizing the hazardous nature of the venture ahead\r\nof him. He carried the undertaking to a successful close, but barely\r\nescaped with his life.\r\n\r\nThe first telegraph-station along the line was located at Utiarity. It\r\nwas conducted by a young Brazilian; his wife acted as schoolmistress\r\nand was doing a really noble work in educating the younger generation\r\nof Parecís along mental and moral lines. The second telegraph-station\r\nwas on the banks of the Rio Juruena, approximately one hundred\r\nkilometres away; it required five days to reach this place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Falls of Salto Bello of the Rio Papagayo.]\r\n\r\nBy this time the order of the expedition had settled down to a regular\r\nroutine. We arose as the first sharp blasts of a bugle smote the\r\nsilence of early morning. A short time later the faithful Juan, a\r\ncolored man who was as big-hearted and obliging as he was tall and\r\npowerful, appeared with coffee. At about eight o’clock a bountiful\r\nbreakfast was served. Then we mounted the riding animals which were\r\nbrought and saddled by the _camaradas_, and started on the day’s ride.\r\nEach person was advised in advance of the distance to be covered,\r\nand it was easy to locate the camping-site by watching the numbers\r\non the telegraph-poles; there were eleven of these to the kilometre,\r\nand as they were numbered consecutively it was of course simple to\r\narrive at the numeral that marked the end of the day’s ride. Usually\r\nwe made camp at about 4 P. M., but sometimes it was much later. The\r\ncook and his assistants immediately began to prepare supper, and\r\nalways had it ready in a short time, much to our relief, as there was\r\nnothing to eat between meals. The other men cleared spaces, erected the\r\ntents, and cared for the luggage and animals. Cherrie and I occupied\r\na fifteen by twenty-five foot balloon-silk fly that I had used on the\r\nOrinoco, and this was one of the few shelters that withstood the entire\r\ntrip; it was used later on the Rio da Duvida by Colonel Roosevelt. If\r\nthere was time we went on a short hunting-trip and usually secured\r\nat least a few interesting and little-known mammals and birds. Night\r\nin camp was invariably delightful; when the weather was favorable\r\nthe peons gathered great heaps of wood and made a huge bonfire. Then\r\nwe sat around it and listened to Colonel Roosevelt telling of his\r\nhunting adventures on the Western plains, in the north woods, or on\r\nthe African veldt--all told in such a way that we were enthralled and\r\ncould visualize pronghorn, cougar, bear, and lion, as well as their\r\nactions in their native wilderness. Should the weather be unfavorable,\r\nCherrie and I repaired to the colonel’s tent for a visit; or the\r\ncolonel and Kermit came to see us. We discussed history, literature,\r\nand science, and sometimes, if the conditions were propitious, we were\r\nfavored with tales of ghosts, the werewolf, and other supernatural\r\nbeings. I always looked forward to these occasions; they are among the\r\nnever-to-be-forgotten events incidental to our journey through the\r\nwilds with Colonel Roosevelt.\r\n\r\nIt required four days’ time to reach the Juruena. We had been compelled\r\nto reduce the amount of baggage very materially shortly after leaving\r\nthe Parecís village, as many of the cargo-animals had given out on the\r\ntrail, and the others were weakening perceptibly. It was of course\r\nimpossible to carry along grain for the animals; each night they were\r\nturned loose to shift for themselves, and while there was an abundance\r\nof grass, the long-continued strain began to tell. We abandoned most\r\nof the tents, and all superfluous clothing was left behind. The\r\nequipment for collecting and preserving specimens had to be reduced\r\nto a minimum also, on account of its weight; we retained only a few\r\nhundred cartridges and about a dozen traps with which to prosecute the\r\nnatural-history work. This reduction of the impedimenta was unavoidable\r\nand affected every member of the party, either directly or indirectly.\r\nIt was one of the several instances where individual interests had to\r\nbe sacrificed for the good of the whole expedition.\r\n\r\nAt Juruena we made the acquaintance of a primitive tribe of Indians who\r\nprobably represent the lowest type of savage to be found anywhere on\r\nthe South American continent. They are known as the Nhambiquaras. As we\r\ndrew up on the river-bank they gathered about and stared in curiosity\r\nat the party, but betrayed no hostile feelings. Colonel Rondon had but\r\nrecently succeeded in establishing amicable relations with them. On\r\nhis first visits into Matto Grosso, numbers of his men had been slain\r\nby the Nhambiquaras, and they had resented his every step into their\r\nstronghold. In the days that followed, Colonel Rondon related some of\r\nhis experiences with these Indians. As accompanied by a few companions,\r\namong whom Lieutenant Lyra figured prominently, he made his way slowly\r\nand painfully through the _chapadão_, parties of the savages constantly\r\nfollowed his movements. On account of the open character of the country\r\nthey remained in concealment during the daytime; but when night spread\r\na protecting cloak of darkness over the land, the Indians became bolder\r\nand harassed the camp. It was impossible to build a fire, for that\r\nwould have enabled the lurking fiends to see their victims and make\r\neasy targets of them. After trying many schemes for making friends\r\nwith the savages, Colonel Rondon took a phonograph into the wilds with\r\nhim, and played it at night. The Indians were unable to understand\r\nthe music, and finally their curiosity prompted them to leave the\r\nsheltering blackness and come timidly into the Brazilians’ camp in\r\nsearch of the sound.\r\n\r\nColonel Rondon has persistently treated the wild people with kindness.\r\nDuring all their persecution of himself and his men, he permitted no\r\none to retaliate in any manner whatever. They have therefore learned to\r\nlook upon him as a friend and some even appeared to be heartily glad to\r\nsee him.\r\n\r\nIn stature the Nhambiquara is short, but well built and of a rather\r\ndark-brown color. It seems possible that some of them have a slight\r\namount of negro blood in their veins, obtained from runaway slaves many\r\nyears ago; a few of this class had a light growth of hair on the face.\r\nThe others were beardless and their bodies also were entirely devoid of\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nClothes are entirely unknown to these Indians, and practically the\r\nonly ornaments in their possession were strings of beads given to\r\nthem by Colonel Rondon. The men had the septum of the nose and upper\r\nlip pierced, and wore quills or slender pieces of bamboo in these\r\nperforations. They had the unpleasant habit of coming close up to one\r\nand jabbering at a furious rate of speed; this caused the labrets to\r\nmove uncomfortably near one’s eyes, and it was necessary at times to\r\nretreat a short distance in order to get out of range of the menacing\r\nornaments. This tribe builds curious round huts or _maloca_ of grass\r\nor leaves, and cultivates small areas of mandioca; but forest fruits,\r\ngame, and wild honey form important articles of diet. Ants, snakes, and\r\nalmost any creature they can capture are eaten. One day I saw several\r\nchildren playing with a calabash of honey, when they accidentally upset\r\nit on the ground; this, however, caused them not the slightest concern;\r\nthey gathered around the spot, and scooped up handfuls of the saturated\r\nsand, which they ate. When they had finished, a deep hole remained to\r\nmark the site of their banquet!\r\n\r\nThe weapons of the Nhambiquaras consist of bows six feet tall, made of\r\ntough black or red palm-wood, and long bamboo arrows. The points of the\r\nlatter vary according to the purpose for which they are to be used,\r\nand some of them are poisoned. A bamboo cap is placed over the points\r\nthat have been treated with curare, to prevent the owner’s causing\r\ninjury to himself, and also to keep the rain from washing the poison\r\noff. Hunting-parties take long tramps at frequent intervals, subsisting\r\non the fruits of their prowess. At night a rude lean-to is built of\r\nbranches; a fire, started by rubbing two sticks together, is placed in\r\nfront, and the game is roasted and eaten; then they stretch themselves\r\non the bare ground to sleep, like so many sheep or dogs.\r\n\r\nColonel Rondon was always kind to the Indians. He gave them beads,\r\ntrinkets, and food. A herd of steers was driven along with the\r\nexpedition, and one of the animals was killed whenever meat was\r\nrequired. The Indians always received an entire quarter of beef. They\r\nbuilt a huge fire, tore off pieces of the meat and threw them into the\r\nembers, where they were left until charred; then they were raked out\r\nwith a stick and eaten. This was continued far into the night, until\r\nnot a morsel remained. Sometimes the Indians danced for us, and once we\r\njoined them. They clasped hands and stamped about in a circle singing\r\nin a loud, shrill voice, words that sounded like “_Nã-na-ha-ha-ha_.”\r\nAfter a time we regretted having entered into their pastime, for they\r\nkept up the dancing for an hour or more and refused to permit us to\r\ndrop out.\r\n\r\nWe remained a day at Juruena to rest and develop films. The pictures\r\ntaken by an expedition always form one of its important records, and\r\ngreat care must be exercised in developing all exposed films promptly\r\nor they will spoil in the hot, damp climate.\r\n\r\nWhen we were ready to continue our journey on the second morning, we\r\ndiscovered that the Nhambiquaras in departing had taken two of the dogs\r\nwith them. Colonel Rondon spent some hours hunting for the Indians,\r\nbut their start was too long and he could not come up with them. I\r\nregretted heartily that they had not taken all of the dogs, as they\r\nwere a mongrel, worthless lot; they were of no assistance in hunting,\r\nnor did they watch camp. On the contrary, they brought fleas and ticks\r\ninto the tents, insisted on eating and drinking out of our dishes,\r\nand consumed quantities of food that might have been used to better\r\nadvantage later.\r\n\r\nThe country beyond the Juruena is somewhat rolling, but there is no\r\nappreciable change in the vegetation. We rode twenty kilometres the\r\nfirst day, camping on the banks of the Rio da Fomiga (February 10).\r\nNext day we travelled but twelve kilometres, reaching the Jurina, a\r\nshallow though rapid stream six hundred feet wide; the crossing was\r\nslow and laborious, as there was only one very small _balsa_ or ferry.\r\nCamp was pitched on the banks of a small stream a league beyond. Near\r\nby were several deserted thatched huts and the comparatively new graves\r\nwhere two Brazilian soldiers and one army officer had been buried. The\r\nIndians had killed them, and interred them in an upright position with\r\nthe head and shoulders protruding out of the ground. The following\r\nnight, on the Rio Primavera we saw two other graves; the men who were\r\nburied there had been slain while asleep in their hammocks. This was\r\nthe most dangerous part of the whole Nhambiquara country.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached a place called Mutúm Cavallo in the afternoon of the\r\n15th, the mules Kermit and I had ridden were so tired that we decided\r\nto give them a day’s rest; that meant walking to the next camping-site,\r\nand rather than undertake the long journey during the hot hours of\r\nthe next day we planned to start immediately after supper. There was\r\nstill some time to spend, however, so we went about our work as usual.\r\nAn army of ants was foraging near the tents; they had discovered a\r\nlarge, hairy caterpillar, but the half-inch long “bristles” with which\r\nit was covered protected its body from the onslaught of the marauding\r\nhost. The ants, however, were not to be deterred from their purpose;\r\nthey made repeated rushes at the caterpillar, clipping off a bit of\r\nhair each time they struck. After continuing these tactics for twenty\r\nminutes, a small patch of the plump insect’s body had been cleared of\r\nhair, and one ant got a good hold with its vise-like mandible. The\r\ncaterpillar, upon feeling the pain, promptly began to wriggle, thus\r\nexposing its unprotected under-side, and the ants immediately rushed at\r\nthat vulnerable part and soon succeeded in overwhelming their victim.\r\n\r\nNear by lay the dry, bleached skull of a steer. A fer-de-lance three\r\nfeet long had apparently been struck with the possibilities as a safe\r\nhiding-place presented by the interior of the skull, and proceeded to\r\ncrawl into it _via_ the nasal openings. Then it discovered that this\r\nwas not the proper entrance and tried to back out; but bits of sharp,\r\nsplintered bone caught under the plates and scales of the reptile’s\r\nbody, holding it as securely as a trap, until it died, perhaps of\r\nstarvation.\r\n\r\nAt 8.30 P. M. we started on our long walk. It was very dark at first,\r\nso that it was impossible to see the trail. We had taken one of the\r\ndogs with us, and this is the only time, so far as I know, that he was\r\nof the slightest use. He was of a light color, so we could make out his\r\ndimly outlined form in the darkness. He was therefore permitted to go\r\nin advance, and we followed in his footsteps; not once did he lose the\r\ntrail.\r\n\r\nEach of us carried a hammock and blanket, also a gun, as Colonel Rondon\r\nhad warned us against bands of prowling Indians and jaguars. But to\r\nour disappointment we saw absolutely nothing, and did not hear so much\r\nas even the hoot of an owl. The only excitement was occasioned when\r\nstreams blocked our way, and it was necessary to start across without\r\nknowing just exactly what was ahead. At midnight we saw a bright light\r\nin the distance, and soon after passed the sleeping sentinel and\r\nentered Captain Amilcar’s quarters; he was camped on a grassy knoll\r\ncalled Campo Novo.\r\n\r\nFormerly the third telegraph-station was located at this point, but it\r\nnow stands on the Rio Nhambiquara, a league away. We were now on the\r\nborder of the great Cerro do Norte, a vast tract of country composed\r\nof high, broken plateaus or mesas covered luxuriantly with grass.\r\nMany small streams flow through deep gorges, and near some of the\r\nwatercourses tall, dense forest grows. The soil is fertile and would\r\nproduce abundant crops of corn and vegetables. Countless herds of\r\ncattle could be reared on the extensive plains, and the climate is cool\r\nand healthful. There are few portions of South America so well suited\r\nto colonization by Europeans, but on account of the remote location and\r\nthe lack of means of communication it will be several decades before\r\nthis vast and fruitful region will become inhabited.\r\n\r\nIt required about a week’s time to cross the extensive Cerro do Norte.\r\nThe type of country gradually changes. The vegetation of the _chapadão_\r\ngives way to a taller growth, and the banks of the numerous streams are\r\nheavily forested. Occasionally all other vegetation is superseded by\r\nextensive areas of wild pineapples. Many square miles are covered with\r\ndense thickets of the plants; during the greater part of three days’\r\nride we were seldom out of sight of them. The fruit was just ripening\r\nby countless millions; it was small but of delicious flavor. The\r\nIndians ate quantities and also made wine of it.\r\n\r\nWe added few specimens to the collection after leaving Utiarity. Animal\r\nlife was not abundant, and the rapid pace at which the expedition was\r\ncompelled to move left no time for collecting. The Nhambiquaras came\r\nto our camp almost daily. They usually approached unarmed, having\r\nconcealed their bows and arrows some distance away; that was a sign of\r\npeaceful intentions. One day we passed one of their settlements; it\r\ncontained a few low, round huts made of poles covered with grass; one\r\nsmall opening served as the doorway. We also encountered a number of\r\nthem on the march. A solitary man walked first, carrying his bow and\r\narrows only; about fifty yards behind came a woman, heavily burdened\r\nwith baskets, calabashes, and children. Another man followed, and then\r\na second woman, and so on until the whole band had passed. The reason\r\nfor this formation is apparent. As the men are first and are the\r\nfighters, they must be on the alert and ready to face danger without an\r\ninstant’s delay; were they encumbered with the family impedimenta the\r\ndelay occasioned in ridding themselves of it before being able to use\r\ntheir weapons might be fatal to the whole family.\r\n\r\nWe found an interesting little animal called cururú (_Ctenomys_) at a\r\nplace named José Bonifacio, reached February 23. It is of gopher-like\r\nappearance and habits, and is said never to come out of the ground. It\r\nthrows up mounds of earth at irregular intervals of from a few feet to\r\nten yards apart, and some of them are very large--three feet across and\r\neighteen inches high. We were very desirous of securing one of these\r\nanimals, but as there were no traps available for the purpose, six\r\nNhambiquaras were induced to dig open one of the burrows. At first the\r\nIndians, guided by the mounds and aided by a sharpened stick, followed\r\nthe galleries, which were about a foot beneath the surface, and at\r\nintervals of ten yards blocked them by stamping down the earth into the\r\nhole. We returned a half-hour later and found that the plug between two\r\nof these sections had been opened, so knew just where the creature was\r\nbottled up.\r\n\r\nThe Indians now opened the entire section of the gallery and found a\r\nhole going almost straight down, which, they explained, led to the\r\nnest. A soldier was now called with a hoe, and the work of excavation\r\nwas begun. In order that the hole might not be filled up, a long,\r\npliable stick was inserted, and this served as a guide. The Indians\r\nworked with pointed sticks and threw out the loose earth with their\r\nhands. Frequently they relieved one another. When near the end of the\r\nwork the animal could be felt with a stick; they became greatly excited\r\nand worked in feverish haste, as a fox-terrier might after a rat, and\r\nkept up a continuous yelling. They were covered with earth from head\r\nto foot; ears, eyes, nose, and hair were caked with sand and clay, and\r\nthe naked bodies looked as if they had just emerged from a mud-wallow.\r\nFinally one threw away his stick, inserted his arm into the hole, and\r\nwith a yell of triumph jumped up, holding aloft the kicking little\r\ncreature by the tail. Then he flung it from him into the grass. The\r\nanimal seemed bewildered above ground and could not run fast.\r\n\r\nThe hole, after leaving the upper gallery, descended eight feet, and\r\nthen ran in a horizontal direction fifteen feet. At the end was a small\r\ncavity, but no nest. Small bunches of grass were found in the gallery\r\nwhich had been pulled down by the roots.\r\n\r\nThe excavation measured fifteen feet long, eight feet deep and three\r\nfeet wide, and it required half a day for the Indians to complete the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe Indians are fond of the animal’s flesh, and often dig them out to\r\neat.\r\n\r\nAt a camp named Sete de Setembro the two divisions of the expedition\r\nwere reunited. Captain Amilcar and his party had arrived a day or two\r\nbefore, and a halt was made to divide the equipment and provisions\r\nbetween what were to be the Duvida and Gy-Paraná parties. The Rio da\r\nDuvida was only ten kilometres away, and on February 27 we reached its\r\nbanks. It is a silent, swift stream about sixty-five feet wide at this\r\npoint, spanned by a substantial wooden bridge. A number of canoes, some\r\nof them old and water-logged from use, were tied at the landing. No\r\ntime was lost in loading them and making ready for the start into the\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE DESCENT OF THE RIO GY-PARANÁ\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile we were on the Paraguay River it was decided that upon reaching\r\nthe Rio da Duvida the expedition should be divided into two sections,\r\nas a large party always decreases the chances of success in an\r\nunexplored region. Colonel Roosevelt suggested that Cherrie and I draw\r\nlots, or to settle the matter in any way we chose as to which one\r\nshould accompany him. After due consideration it seemed to me that, as\r\nCherrie was the older and more experienced man, he was justly entitled\r\nto accompany the colonel on the journey down the new river; so I\r\nvolunteered to join the party which planned to descend the Gy-Paraná.\r\n\r\nThe eventful day arrived at last, when the expedition must separate;\r\nwe had looked forward in eager anticipation to the end of the long\r\nride across the Brazilian _chapadão_ and the beginning of river work,\r\nbut now that the goal had been attained without serious mishap,\r\nthirty-seven days after leaving the Upper Paraguay, the division of the\r\nexpedition seemed to have come all too soon.\r\n\r\nTo better organize the two different forces, our party had halted at\r\na point called Sete de Setembro, ten kilometres this side of the Rio\r\nda Duvida, while the other division had pushed on to the point of\r\nembarkation. We reached their camp early February 27, 1914, just as\r\nthe tents were being taken down and the canoes loaded, preparatory\r\nto the plunge into the unknown. A short time later everything was in\r\nreadiness, and farewells were exchanged with Colonel Roosevelt and with\r\nthe Brazilian officers. Then, with a parting “Good luck!” their dugouts\r\nswung into the current and were whisked away. For several minutes we\r\nstood upon the fragile structure that bridged the unexplored river and\r\nstared at the dark forest that shut our erstwhile leader and his\r\nBrazilian companions from view; and then, filled with misgivings as to\r\nwhether or not we should ever see them again, we turned our thoughts to\r\nthe task before us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sketch map of the south-central part of the Amazon\r\ndrainage system.\r\n\r\nScale, °1:12,000,000.\r\n\r\n    The party of which the writer was a member descended the Rio\r\n    Commemoração and the Gy-Paraná to the Madeira. From here Manaos\r\n    on the Amazon was reached by the regular steamer route down the\r\n    Madeira.\r\n\r\n    The drainage between the Upper Paraguay and the Madeira is based\r\n    on the surveys of the Brazilian Telegraph Commission, so far as\r\n    available. Note the recently explored course of the Rio Ananás\r\n    (_The Geographical Review_, January, 1916, p. 50, and February, pp.\r\n    143–144), and the completed telegraph-line from Cuyabá to Santo\r\n    Antonio (_Bulletin American Geographical Society_, September, 1915,\r\n    p. 693). The latter is taken from a map in the Rio de Janeiro\r\n    newspaper _A Noite_ for October 25, 1915.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOur party consisted of Captain Amilcar de Magalhães, a remarkably\r\nskilful and wholly tireless leader, and Lieutenant Joaquim de Melho,\r\nof the Brazilian Army, Doctor Euzebio Paulo de Oliveira, a geologist,\r\nand Señor Henrique Heinisch, a taxidermist, all of the Brazilian\r\nTelegraph Commission, besides myself; then there were some thirty-odd\r\n_camaradas_, or native assistants. We had a very large pack-train of\r\nmules and oxen, as that wing of the expedition, in charge of Captain\r\nAmilcar, which had hitherto travelled ahead of the main party, was to\r\nproceed with us from this point. Our plan was to continue overland\r\nto the headwaters of the Gy-Paraná and to descend that stream to the\r\nMadeira, taking observations as we went, for, in common with many of\r\nthe rivers of the South American continent, the course of this stream\r\nhas not been accurately mapped.[1] Zoologically speaking, we were in a\r\nmost interesting and almost unknown country, and no opportunity could\r\nbe lost to add to our already large and constantly growing collection\r\nof both mammals and birds.\r\n\r\n    [1] The Gy-Paraná had been descended by two parties which\r\n        Colonel Rondon detached for this purpose from his main\r\n        expedition of 1909. The first, under the zoologist Alipio\r\n        de Mirando Ribeiro, went down the Pimentá Bueno and the\r\n        Gy-Paraná to the Madeira; the second, under Lieutenant\r\n        Antonio Pyrineus de Souza, descended the Jarú and the\r\n        Gy-Paraná (see map). It was the reconnoissance survey made\r\n        by the first party that established the fact that the\r\n        Gy-Paraná, instead of flowing northwest throughout its\r\n        course, as until then supposed, turns abruptly north in\r\n        11½° south latitude, and flows in this direction for nearly\r\n        three degrees, until, at another abrupt bend in 9° south,\r\n        it turns west and empties into the Madeira.\r\n\r\nWe left the Duvida (now Rio Theodoro) shortly before noon; but it had\r\nrained nearly the entire day and the trail was indescribably bad;\r\nbesides, the animals had completed their thirty-eighth day of travel\r\nwithout proper food or rest. That night we camped beside the trail on\r\na site cleared for the purpose by the _camaradas_; we had taken\r\nonly the canvas flies, as it had been found necessary to abandon the\r\nwall-tents some little distance back on account of their great weight.\r\nThere was no feed for the animals, but the men had cut a quantity of\r\npalm-leaves growing abundantly in the forest, which the oxen refused to\r\neat, however.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Camp on the Rio da Duvida.\r\n\r\nFrom this point the exploration of the river was undertaken by Col.\r\nRoosevelt.]\r\n\r\nThe trail had now left the open _chapadão_ and wound between high walls\r\nof dark forest; instead of the monotonous level of the plain, the\r\ncountry was broken and hilly, with numerous small streams trickling\r\nthrough the dividing ravines, and it rained almost continuously; if we\r\nhad succeeded in evading the rainy season heretofore, it descended on\r\nus now with doubled vigor.\r\n\r\nA very wide swath had been cut through the forest for the\r\ntelegraph-line to protect the wires from falling trunks and branches;\r\nso recent had been the work that the shrivelled leaves still clung to\r\nthe prostrate trees, and the thick second growth, which springs up\r\nimmediately where the sunlight is permitted to reach the ground, was\r\njust sprouting. The ground was covered with fruits of many kinds, most\r\nof them insipid or of acrid flavor, but the herds of peccaries seemed\r\nto relish them; and the flocks of parrots and macaws quarrelled noisily\r\noverhead in their struggles to reach some particularly appetizing\r\nmorsel. One of the things that especially attracted our attention was\r\nthe great number of hard, cannon-ball-like shells that littered the\r\ntrail; they were the empty casques of the _castanha_, or Brazil nut,\r\nwhich grew abundantly throughout the forest. The Indians had opened\r\nmost of them, in what manner I am unable to say, as they are so hard\r\nthe blows of a hammer fail to make any impression, and extracted the\r\ndozen or more triangular nuts from each. The trees upon which they grow\r\nare remarkable for their height and great thickness; not infrequently\r\nwe saw one a hundred and fifty feet high and four feet in diameter\r\nwithout a single branch lower than sixty or seventy feet. Graves\r\nwere numerous by the wayside; I counted fifteen, near one another,\r\neach newly made mound being marked by a rude cross without name or\r\ninscription; they indicated the burial sites of _camaradas_, victims to\r\nthe dread beri-beri and malaria.\r\n\r\nDuring our second night’s camp we heard the gruff, cough-like roar\r\nof a jaguar not far away, and next morning the men reported that the\r\ncreature had killed one of the oxen. I went to see the slain animal\r\nand found that it was badly bitten about the neck and that one of the\r\nthighs had been partly eaten; in its enfeebled state the ox had been\r\nan easy kill for the big spotted cat. We made no attempt to follow the\r\njaguar, but shouldered our guns and started on the home-stretch of\r\nthe long journey. Again it rained heavily, though intermittently, and\r\nfrequently the mud was knee-deep: but the knowledge that the river and\r\nrest lay but thirteen kilometres away acted as a stimulus to the men,\r\nand even the weary animals responded to the ceaseless urging of their\r\ndrivers and panted along as if they, too, understood that the end of\r\ntheir toil was at hand.\r\n\r\nAt about four o’clock that afternoon our destination was reached.\r\nFrom the top of a rather high hill we had an unobstructed view down\r\nthe wide, newly cleared lane through the forest; a small cluster\r\nof mud-walled, palm-thatched huts nestled in the depression at the\r\nfoot of the hill, with a patch of corn and rice growing to one side;\r\na hundred yards beyond sparkled the river, and on all sides of the\r\nlittle clearing rose the Amazonian forest. The little building housing\r\nthe telegraphic equipment was placed at our disposal, and tents were\r\nerected for the _camaradas_, who straggled in with the footsore\r\npack-train until a late hour. The animals were given their liberty\r\nand bountiful feeds of corn and fodder, so that within a week many of\r\nthem were in condition to start on the back trail, a comparatively\r\neasy trip, as there were no heavy loads to carry. Many of the natives\r\nwere also sent back, while others were retained in the service of the\r\nexpedition; one detachment was sent to the camp of the laborers who\r\nwere working on the telegraph-line, which extended two kilometres\r\nbeyond. This was the end of the survey, Barão de Melgaço being the\r\nname of the last station, and a force of about fifty men were engaged\r\ncutting an opening for the continuation of the line. At the rate\r\nthey were working it was estimated that the line to Manaos would be\r\ncompleted in about two years.\r\n\r\nWe had expected to find a craft of some kind awaiting us so that we\r\nmight immediately pursue our journey down the river, but in this we\r\nwere disappointed, although, as it later developed, a boat was then\r\non its way to us, sent by order of Colonel Rondon. There were only\r\ntwo small dugouts available, which were entirely inadequate for our\r\npurpose, so the men were put to work cutting down a tree of large size\r\nand hollowing out a canoe which would hold the party and the necessary\r\nluggage. This work we estimated would take some weeks, so in the\r\nmeantime we busied ourselves exploring the country in the vicinity of\r\nBarão de Melgaço.\r\n\r\nA short reconnoissance through the forest revealed a veritable\r\nzoological wonderland. I was consequently very glad that we were\r\ndelayed, as this gave me an opportunity to study the fauna of a\r\nzoologically unknown region, and to work on some of the problems\r\nof nature with which we are constantly confronted, but of which so\r\nlittle is known. One of the facts that no field-naturalist can fail\r\nto have thrust upon his notice is the exact precision and nicety with\r\nwhich the balance in nature is preserved. Take the familiar example\r\nof the oyster. In its early stages of development it is subject to\r\nthe raids of such a host of enemies and adverse conditions that out\r\nof a million eggs only a few bivalves reach maturity; to offset this\r\nwholesale destruction nature has provided that a single oyster may\r\nlay several millions of eggs, and thus the race is preserved. Birds,\r\nto a less extent, are subject to this same thoughtful provision;\r\ntherefore we find that the species which are subject to many\r\ndangers during the nesting-period or which undertake long, perilous\r\nseasonal migrations, lay comparatively large sets of eggs; this is\r\nbest evidenced by ducks and quail. Species which are subject to\r\nthe natural dangers of migration only and are protected during the\r\nnesting-season, comparatively speaking, rear small broods of young;\r\nwarblers, thrushes, and a number of our own native birds would come in\r\nthis category; to further offset the loss, some of these latter may\r\neven rear two broods in a season. When we reach the tropics a marked\r\nchange is noticeable; the extremes in climatic conditions are usually\r\nrepresented by the wet and dry seasons; there are few enemies and food\r\nis abundant, consequently the loss of life is comparatively small.\r\nIf reproduction proceeded there at the same rate as in the northern\r\nlands, it must be obvious that the country would soon be overstocked;\r\nbut again it has been decreed that the equity should be preserved, and\r\nthe great majority of tropical birds nest but once a year, and then\r\nthe full complement of eggs is but two. Of course there are a number\r\nof exceptions on each side, and on such matters it is difficult to\r\ngeneralize, but in the majority of cases this will be found to be true.\r\n\r\nOn one of my walks in the forest I came upon a troop of peculiar little\r\nmonkeys of the saki family (_cacajão_) feeding in the top of a tall\r\nwild fig-tree. They differed from all other known members of the genus\r\nby being entirely black, with snow-white noses. While feeding they\r\nwere quiet, and the only thing that betrayed their presence was the\r\nconstant pattering of small particles of fruit upon the dry leaves\r\ncarpeting the ground. Presently they took fright, and away they went in\r\na series of leaps and bounds, so that the tree-tops were agitated as\r\nby a violent gust of wind; they uttered queer little whining squeaks\r\nas they ran and soon disappeared from view. A small one of the same\r\nspecies which I owned was a most amusing little pet and never failed\r\nto gain a place in the affections of any one who beheld it--even the\r\nmost calloused _camarada_; it was of a most playful and friendly\r\ndisposition and, if petted, made the most ridiculous faces and bubbled\r\nwith laughter. Another monkey that was common in the forest was a\r\nspecies of _Ateles_, or spider-monkey, which is very appropriately\r\nnamed on account of its slender build and long, wiry arms and legs; it\r\nalso is of a black color, and swings its way through the branches much\r\nafter the order of a gibbon, although it lacks the latter’s agility.\r\nThe Indians are very fond of this species, both for food and as pets;\r\nbut whatever epicurean merits may attach to the flesh, in appearance\r\nthe creatures are most repulsive. The face is pinched and drawn, with a\r\nlong-suffering expression about the eyes, while a tuft of long, stiff\r\nhair extending over the forehead like a ragged cap gives it a greater\r\nlook of misery and grotesqueness. One specimen which I collected\r\nmeasured six feet two inches from the tips of the fingers to the tip of\r\nthe tail.\r\n\r\nBirds were not uncommon, but rather hard to observe on account of the\r\ndensity of the vegetation. Near the river stretched a wide band of\r\nbamboo, beautiful to look upon but impossible to penetrate without\r\nthe aid of a machete. Just beyond, the trees grew tall and in close\r\nproximity, giant _castanhas_, _heveas_, and ironwoods intermingling\r\ntheir branches to form a canopy of deepest green, impervious to\r\nsunlight and through which rain filtered slowly; palms, ferns, and\r\nthorny shrubbery formed a dense undergrowth near the streams, so that\r\nprogress at best was slow. From all sides came the clear, ringing\r\n“_hoo-whee-whee-hoo_” of the gold-bird, or whistling _cotinga_, often\r\nmisnamed the bell-bird, and although the sound came from but a few feet\r\noverhead, it was usually impossible to locate the dull, slate-colored\r\nsongster perched motionless on a well-screened branch. The smaller\r\nspecies of birds travelled in large flocks, doubtless deriving some\r\nmutual benefit from this mode of living; usually the band was preceded\r\nby a few scouting brown wood-hewers, some with slender bills four\r\ninches long bent in a half-circle, flitting silently from trunk to\r\ntrunk, lighting low down and running up rapidly, while they searched\r\nthe crevices in the bark for insects; then came the vast host of\r\nvireos, warblers, flycatchers, tanagers, and woodpeckers, completely\r\ninvesting the trees in their all-absorbing quest of a livelihood.\r\nTwigs snapped, seeds dropped, the woods seemed full of fluttering\r\nwings and chirping voices; but in a few moments the noise grew faint\r\nand stopped; the tireless army had gone its way, and the vanguard of\r\ntrogons suddenly appeared, hovered in mid-air to snap off an enticing\r\nfruit, and then hurried away. Occasionally we were fortunate enough to\r\nshoot a curassow, a large turkey-like bird, and then our Brazilian chef\r\nprepared the national dish called _canja_; it consists of a fowl and\r\nrice boiled together and is delicious.\r\n\r\nOn account of its large size, work on the dugout progressed slowly; a\r\nsection of the trunk, some thirty feet long, had been cut off where\r\nthe tree had fallen, and this was being hollowed out with adzes,\r\nwhile short-handled axes were used in dressing down the exterior.\r\nAfter twelve days of continuous hewing the dugout began to assume the\r\nappearance of a seaworthy craft, and we figured that she would be ready\r\nto launch at the end of another two weeks; but the next day a _batelão_\r\narrived. Her captain had been fighting his way up the Gy-Paraná over\r\nthree months in his efforts to reach Barão de Melgaço, having been sent\r\nfrom the Madeira by order of Colonel Rondon.\r\n\r\nWe loaded our meagre outfit into the _batelão_, which was a good-sized\r\ncraft built of boards nailed over heavy wooden ribs, and with a squared\r\ntree-trunk for a keel; an arched palm-leaf roof covered a section in\r\nthe centre, under which we sat to avoid the rain or sun. This style of\r\nboat is in general use on the larger tropical rivers and corresponds\r\nwith the _falca_ of the Orinoco and the _champan_ of the Magdalena. A\r\ncrew of eighteen men was mustered, all of whom were more than willing\r\nto leave their pestilential environs, and we were soon shooting\r\ndown-stream with the rapid current. Captain Amilcar had gone on ahead\r\nwith the small canoes in order to survey the river. They carried a\r\nsighting-rod with red disks and a telemeter for measuring distances; a\r\ncompass gave them the direction.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour after starting we reached the camp of the\r\ntelegraphic commission and made a short stop to take aboard a number\r\nof men who were suffering with fever and beri-beri; shattered wrecks\r\nof humanity whose only hope of life lay in flight. I saw a number\r\nof the _camaradas_ who had come across Matto Grosso with us, and it\r\nwas surprising to note the great change which only two weeks in the\r\nsteaming, insect-infested forest had wrought; several of them were\r\nalready suffering from violent attacks of malaria, and their faces\r\nwere colorless and sallow; others who had been in the region longer\r\nstared at the _batelão_ with sunken, lustreless eyes in which not\r\neven a vestige of interest in our visit or of hope was evident; a few\r\nhad apparently reached the stage where the sight of the twelve newly\r\nmade mounds on the hilltop no longer aroused feelings of dread or\r\napprehension, but rather of indifference tempered with longing for a\r\nwelcome release.\r\n\r\nThe Commemoração, the headwater branch of the Gy-Paraná, on which we\r\nwere, is a deep river from three hundred to a thousand feet wide, with\r\nreddish water and a swift current. It was not necessary for the men to\r\nply the oars except when rounding some sharp bend where steerage-way\r\nwas required, and this was fortunate, as it rained so much of the time\r\nthat the men were glad to seek the protection offered by the covered\r\nportion of the boat. In the intervals between the deluging showers the\r\nsun blazed down mercilessly; trees on both sides of the narrow lane of\r\nwater sparkled as if bedecked with jewels. In places the forest rose\r\nfrom the river’s edge in sheer walls of variegated green; tree-trunks,\r\nbrush, and palms united into one solid battlement by mosses, climbing\r\nlilies, and ensnaring creepers. Again, clumps of graceful ita-palms\r\nleaned far out over the water and then rose in a series of stately,\r\nfeather-crowned columns. At frequent intervals we had glimpses of the\r\nanimal life that lurked within the impenetrable barrier of the forest\r\nfastness. Monkeys were especially plentiful, and within an hour after\r\nstarting we had seen four distinct species, representing as many\r\nfamilies; there were files of black howlers, the males jet-black,\r\nwhile the females are of a straw-color, moving leisurely through the\r\nbranches; troops of dainty squirrel-monkeys, with deep-chestnut backs,\r\ngrayish heads, and white faces, scampered over the tops of the lower\r\ntrees. Black spider-monkeys sat in the highest crotches and gazed down\r\nat us in stupid perplexity, and once we startled a family of woolly\r\nlittle night-monkeys of a grayish color, which had selected a thick\r\nclump of overhanging vegetation as their diurnal sleeping-place. Large\r\nflocks of blue-and-yellow macaws, flying two by two, crossed the river\r\nhigh overhead, doubtless on their way to some choice feeding-ground.\r\nKingfishers sped away in front of the hurrying _batelão_, and from the\r\ndepths of the woods came the muffled sound of an ivory-bill’s tapping\r\non a hollow trunk.\r\n\r\nThat night we reached the junction of the rivers Commemoração and\r\n_Pimentá Bueno_, the latter a stream not less than a thousand yards\r\nwide, with a great volume of water. The river formed by the confluence\r\nof these two streams is known as the Gy-Paraná. We had covered a\r\ndistance of eighty kilometres. In ascending, it had taken the _batelão_\r\nnineteen days to cover the same stretch of river that we had just\r\ndescended in one day.\r\n\r\nOf course, the surveying canoes could not travel at this rapid pace,\r\nso the two parties became separated. In the very beginning Captain\r\nAmilcar’s party had suffered an accident which came near ending fatally\r\nfor several of the men in his canoe. Their work necessitated frequent\r\nhalts, and to bring the dugouts to a stop while racing down-stream\r\nwas no easy task; so they had adopted the method of driving them into\r\nthe vegetation and then holding on to the branches while a sight was\r\ntaken with the telemeter. On one of these occasions a bushmaster fully\r\nseven feet long was shaken from the overhanging brush and fell into the\r\ncanoe; the panic-stricken crew leaped into the water. Captain Amilcar\r\nretained his presence of mind and shot the snake, but in the meantime\r\nseveral of the men had been swept down-stream and were on the verge\r\nof drowning before he could reach them; the geologist had gone to the\r\nbottom, but was rescued and revived with some difficulty; thereafter he\r\ntravelled with us in the _batelão_.\r\n\r\nThere were numbers of small alligators in the river, not over four feet\r\nlong, called _jacaretinga_; later on we had the cook prepare one, as\r\nthey were said to be good to eat. The flesh was of a white color when\r\ncooked, and tender, but it possessed an objectionable muddy flavor, so\r\nthat we could eat but little of it; however, the natives liked it.\r\n\r\nThe next day we covered a distance of one hundred and eight kilometres.\r\nThe current in the Gy-Paraná is not so strong as in the Commemoração,\r\nbut, the weather being fair, the men pulled at the oars steadily\r\nduring the twelve hours’ travel, with only short periods for rest and\r\nrefreshment. All meals were cooked aboard, on a fire built on a box\r\nof sand in the prow. Insects were not particularly troublesome, as\r\nwe kept to the middle of the stream, which, receiving the water of\r\nnumerous good-sized tributaries, was constantly growing wider. There\r\nwere abundant signs of the close proximity of Indians on both sides of\r\nthe river. We saw some palm-leaf lean-tos used for overnight stops,\r\nwith the charred sticks of a camp-fire in front; where the water\r\neddied slowly against a crumbling bank, bamboo stakes protruded above\r\nthe muddy stream--remnants of an ancient fish-trap--and occasionally\r\nwe passed a small cleared spot, now overgrown with rank weeds and\r\nsecond-growth sprouts, which marked the site of an old plantation.\r\n\r\nRealizing the importance of obtaining the good-will of the wild folk\r\nof whose existence in the surrounding forest there was such abundant\r\nevidence, the Brazilian Government had erected a number of small bamboo\r\nand palm-leaf sheds various distances apart, near some of the more\r\nrecently used trails that led from the water into the dark jungle.\r\nUnder each rough shelter a bench, made of long poles laid across\r\nsticks driven into the ground, had been built. It was the custom of\r\nthe officials in going up or down the river to stop at each of these\r\nstations and place beads, knives, and trinkets on the benches as a\r\npeace-offering to the Indians; but so reticent had been the latter\r\nthat not one of the articles had hitherto been touched. Great was our\r\nsurprise and joy to find that all the precious offerings had been\r\nremoved, and that the Indians themselves had left a number of tokens\r\nof friendship in return. They were arrows six feet long, beautifully\r\nadorned with the bright-colored feathers of trogons, toucans, and other\r\nbirds; parcels of Brazil nuts neatly done up in leaves; a few ears of\r\nmaize, a feather head-dress, and a small pottery bowl. We collected all\r\nthese treasures and left many more presents in exchange.\r\n\r\nAs we neared one of the last stations the sound of loud hallooing came\r\nfrom the forest on our right. We swung the great _batelão_ toward the\r\nshore. We landed, but no sooner had we climbed to the top of the steep\r\nbank than we realized how cleverly had been arranged the plan by the\r\nIndians to effect a meeting with the mysterious strangers who were\r\npassing through their country. Following a wide path that led into the\r\ndense forest for a distance of twenty yards, we suddenly came upon\r\na small, swift stream that sped through a dark tunnel-like opening\r\nunder the dense canopy of leaves and branches. As we stared in blank\r\namazement into the impenetrable tangle of vegetation on the other\r\nside of the stream, there emerged from the forest four nude, bronze\r\nfigures, gesticulating wildly and chattering in a strange jargon which,\r\nof course, we could not understand; they were of good build, though\r\ninferior in physique to the Nhambiquaras we had seen on the _chapadão_,\r\nand not over five feet tall, with long, straight hair, and, remarkable\r\nthough it is, the tangled hair of two of them was of a decided auburn\r\ncolor. Their bodies were plentifully besmeared with dark-bluish paint,\r\napplied in queer zigzag designs and giving a grotesque effect. No\r\nwilder scene can be imagined than the quartet of naked, trembling\r\nsavages faintly outlined against the dim background of merging shadows\r\nand sombre green; somehow they seemed to fit into the picture and to\r\ncomplete the impression of primality conveyed by the vast wilderness\r\nof the Brazilian hinterland. Our captain held up bunches of bright-red\r\nbeads and started to wade into the stream toward them, but they\r\nimmediately withdrew into the thick cover, so he came back. A moment\r\nlater they reappeared and again began talking and waving their arms; by\r\nsigns we tried to induce them to come nearer and to assure them of our\r\npeaceful intentions. Finally, after a powwow with his companions, one\r\nof their number approached to the margin of the stream and held out his\r\nhands. He then pointed to one of our men and motioned for him to take\r\noff his clothes and come over with the presents, which was done; the\r\nIndian grabbed the trinkets from the native’s outstretched hands, gave\r\nhim a violent push back, and fled to his companions. This was repeated\r\na number of times. Then we refused to permit our man to go farther than\r\nthe centre of the stream--the water was nearly up to his chin--and\r\nafter lengthy entreaties the Indian waded out and met him half-way.\r\nWe laid out an attractive assortment of beads, knives, hatchets, and\r\nbright-colored trinkets on our side of the river and, retreating ten\r\nor fifteen feet with extended arms, invited the Indians to come over.\r\nSlowly they came, apparently with many misgivings. We approached them\r\nin a friendly manner; they made no attempt to flee, but cast meaning\r\nglances behind them where, obviously, an armed force was concealed near\r\nby to protect them in the event that our actions aroused suspicion. The\r\nchief was an intelligent fellow; his first deed was to enact before\r\nour eyes a drama that we shall never forget. Assuming a rigid pose, he\r\npointed straight in front of him with one hand, as if taking aim; then\r\nwith a sudden “pong” he clutched at his breast and fell upon his knees,\r\ngradually sinking to the ground, where he lay moaning. We understood\r\nthe accusation; one of his tribe had been shot to death by our people,\r\nprobably a rubber-collector farther down the river; that was the reason\r\nwhy they had mistrusted us. We showed them how to use the _machetes_\r\nand hatchets, and they seemed delighted; but when we demonstrated the\r\nuse of matches their joy knew no bounds; they yelped and danced, made\r\nweird grimaces, and tried to set the trees and bushes afire, like so\r\nmany monkeys. Finally, upon our urgent invitation, the chief shouted a\r\nguttural command, and three more savages appeared instantly and joined\r\nthe group, making seven in all; the late arrivals were also treated in\r\na generous manner, and then we withdrew to our boat. Before leaving,\r\nhowever, we promised to return and bring more _machetes_ and matches,\r\nwhich they seemed particularly to appreciate, and they in turn promised\r\nto have the bench in the palm-leaf shed heaped with bows and arrows and\r\nother things of their making, promises which were religiously kept on\r\nboth sides.\r\n\r\nOur next halt was forty kilometres farther down-stream at a rubber-camp\r\nknown as Urupá. There were several palm-leaf huts standing on a slight\r\nelevation, so we took our hammocks and mosquito-nets and spent the\r\nnight ashore. Travelling eighty kilometres the next day, we reached\r\nanother rubber-camp called La Pena. The surrounding forest appeared\r\nmost attractive, and it was said that a footpath led far into the\r\ninterior to the side of an old Indian village, so I decided to remain\r\nat this point a few days to collect. However, a short walk down the\r\ntrail soon showed that this plan was not feasible; the whole country\r\nwas inundated to a depth of several feet, and there were so many fallen\r\ntrees and clumps of thorny undergrowth that hunting was out of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A rubber-camp on the Rio Gy-Paraná.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A rubber-camp on the Lower Gy-Paraná.]\r\n\r\nThe next day we reached Monte Christo, the depot of a large rubber\r\nconcern which has its headquarters on the Madeira; about one hundred\r\nmen had congregated here to await the coming of the dry season, when\r\nthey would begin collecting rubber-latex from the _hevea_-trees which\r\nabound in the forest. Several long, thatched sheds housed the\r\nwaiting crowd; hammocks were strung from every available post and\r\nrafter, giving the interior a cobwebby appearance, and around the\r\nedges of the huts, protected from the rain by the low, ragged roof of\r\ngrass and leaves, numerous small fires smouldered, over which the men\r\nboiled their rations of beans or _farinha_. There were pure blacks,\r\ndescendants of slaves who had been imported into Brazil from Africa\r\nmany years before; also Indians, Portuguese, and men in whose veins\r\nflowed the blood of all three of these races. Many of them were ill\r\nwith fever, and had large, vile-looking ulcers or “jungle” sores,\r\nwhich were said to result from the bite of a small fly. This was not\r\nsurprising, as the place was entirely surrounded by pools of black,\r\nstagnant water in which clouds of mosquitoes hatched, and no sanitary\r\nprecautions whatever were taken against infection.\r\n\r\nThe natives are very fond of pets, and numbers of animals taken from\r\nthe forest while young were enjoying their full liberty, but never\r\nventured far from the houses. There was a collared peccary, full grown\r\nand very amiable, which liked to be petted, and emitted short, low\r\nmoans and grunts when any one was near it; three curassows, dignified\r\nbut restless, spent much of their time preening their feathers on a\r\nhalf-submerged log. They were beautiful creatures of a deep blue-black\r\ncolor, with white under parts and a wonderful curled crest. A pair of\r\ntrumpeters strutted about the camp; monkeys of the _Cebus_ family and\r\nparrots of several species climbed about in the network of hammocks and\r\nadded their chorus of screams and squawks to the general confusion.\r\n\r\nWe had to leave the _batelão_ at Monte Christo on account of the\r\ncataract which obstructs the river at this point, and carry our luggage\r\naround for a distance of half a mile. Below the rapid we found another\r\ncraft similar to the one we had just left--perhaps a trifle larger--and\r\ntowed by a small wood-burning launch. On the 18th of March all our\r\nthings, and the sick men, several of whom were in a serious condition,\r\nwere carried aboard the waiting _batelão_, and the next morning again\r\nfound us on our way. The Gy-Paraná was rapidly becoming a vast, muddy\r\nsea, comparing favorably in size to some of the larger affluents of\r\nthe Orinoco, such as the Caura and the Ventuari. The character of the\r\nvegetation remained essentially the same, but some of the creepers\r\nthat drooped from the tall trees and trailed in the water were covered\r\nwith clusters of yellow, pink, and pale-blue flowers. We saw and heard\r\nlittle of the animal life, as we travelled too far from the banks. In\r\nthe afternoon a violent wind-storm blew up the river, accompanied by a\r\nterrific downpour.\r\n\r\nSoon after the storm cleared we reached São João, another rubber-camp,\r\nnot unlike Monte Christo. The water was so high at this station that\r\nwe had to use a canoe in going from one hut to another, and the\r\nwhole place reeked with pestilence. It is infinitely more dangerous\r\nto traverse country of this kind than to pass through an entirely\r\nuninhabited region; the huts are fertile propagators and harborers\r\nof contagion of all kinds, to say nothing of the danger to which one\r\nis exposed on account of the more or less constant mingling with the\r\nnatives. Just below São João the river is again broken by rapids; we\r\nrowed down to the beginning of the turbulent water in a canoe and then\r\ncarried around to the foot of the falls. The distance is not great,\r\nbut we had to cross a high, rocky hill, so that we were delayed a day\r\nin making this portage. The rapids are called São Feliz and are of\r\na formidable character, as the bed of the river is dotted with huge\r\ngranite boulders over and among which the water rushes with a roar\r\nthat can be heard half a mile away. During the dry season these rocks\r\nare exposed by the receding water and left covered with a thin scum of\r\nmud impregnated with salt; it is said that parrots, parrakeets, and\r\nmacaws then come in thousands to eat of the saline deposit, and that\r\nthey become so tame great numbers of them are killed with sticks and\r\neaten by the rubber-collectors. I saw two macaws nearly three feet in\r\nlength, and of a blood-red color with blue-and-golden wings, that had\r\nbeen caught the previous year; they were beautiful creatures, but had\r\nthe curious habit of spending the entire day squatting in a dark hole\r\nunder the floor of their owner’s hut, coming out only when hungry and\r\nat night, when they climbed to a perch above the door to sleep.\r\n\r\nAfter dark our men indulged in a curious native dance which I had never\r\nseen before in South America; they collected a great heap of wood\r\nand soon after supper had a roaring bonfire going; then they formed\r\na circle, with one man in the centre who began to sing in a high,\r\nstrained voice, and after each line the whole chorus answered with\r\na wail that sounded something like “_oh-tee-oh-tee-ah_.” The centre\r\nman bowed and hopped about on one foot in a most ridiculous manner\r\nand made frequent sudden charges into the surrounding company, and if\r\nhe succeeded in knocking one of them down that man took his place in\r\nthe middle of the ring. The whole performance looked very much like\r\nan imitation of a cock-fight. Some of the onlookers had rattles made\r\nof small calabashes full of pebbles stuck on a short piece of bamboo,\r\nwhich they shook in rhythm with the singing; they seemed perfectly\r\ninsatiable of this form of amusement, and the dancing and howling\r\nlasted far into the night.\r\n\r\nBelow São Feliz we found another small launch towing a _batelão_, which\r\nin the course of a day took us to a camp called Tabajara. We had not\r\ngone more than a few miles the next morning when further progress was\r\nagain barred by rapids. After a short walk we crossed a branch of the\r\nriver in small dugouts and then started on a two-mile portage through\r\nthe flooded forest. Another launch was waiting below the rapids, but\r\nwithin twenty minutes after weighing anchor we again heard the roar of\r\ntroubled waters ahead of us; the river raced between high, rock-strewn\r\nbanks. In the distance we could see flecks of foam dotting the surface,\r\nwhile a cloud of mist hung over the river; but from beyond the veil\r\nthat obstructed our further view came the ominous roar of a great\r\ncataract, growing in intensity as we drew near. The landing was about\r\na hundred yards above the brink of the first fall, but the current\r\nproved to be too strong for the launch’s little engine, and we were in\r\ndanger of being swept past; the moments that followed were exciting,\r\nbut fortunately we managed to reach the bank. This same thing had\r\noccurred but a short time before, but the result had been disastrous;\r\nthe boat was swept over the falls, and, of the thirty-one men aboard,\r\ntwenty-seven were never seen again. The portage around these rapids,\r\ncalled São Vicente, was about a mile and a half in length and led over\r\ngently undulating country, all heavily forested. In many places the\r\nbed-rock had been uncovered by the torrential rains. This consisted of\r\nfine-grained, dark granite; usually there was a shallow layer of sand\r\non the rock, with a thick covering of rich black mould. From the top of\r\na high knoll we had a fairly good view of the falls and of the rapids\r\nbelow; after leaping over a twenty-foot ledge the river rushes through\r\na narrow rock-filled gorge; enormous boulders tower out of the channel\r\nlike so many black, unvanquished monarchs. Tongues of spray leap to a\r\nheight of forty feet, and clouds of vapor rise in a constant stream.\r\nWith the exception of the Salto Bello of the Rio Sacre and Utiarity\r\nFalls of the Papagaio, we had seen nothing to compare with São Vicente\r\nduring our entire journey across Brazil.\r\n\r\nThat night we reached the first settlement, a small village named Doze\r\nde Novembro. We arrived tired and wet, for it had rained the greater\r\npart of the afternoon, but we congratulated ourselves upon having\r\nperformed a remarkable day’s work.\r\n\r\nThe place was overrun with ants, not the comparatively harmless\r\n_carregador_ ants, which are content to carry away your clothing\r\npiecemeal while you sleep, but with endless armies of the fierce black\r\ncarnivorous species that prey upon every living being. These ants are\r\none of the scourges of the tropics; whether in the fever-stricken\r\nChocó on the west coast of Colombia, at the base of Duida on the\r\nOrinoco, or in the wilds of Matto Grosso, the ravaging hordes seemed\r\nalways the same. One moment they hurry along in solid formations,\r\nthe next side-lines have been thrown out in all directions, covering\r\nmany square yards of ground. Not one leaf or crevice escapes the\r\nalert scouting-parties, which ascend even to the top of the tallest\r\ntree. When a victim is discovered the news in some mysterious way\r\nis flashed to the main column, and battalions of reinforcements\r\nimmediately rush to the encounter, charging the prey and clinging\r\nwith vise-like mandibles to any part of its body that offers a hold.\r\nUsually the approach of the devastating host is preceded by a swarm\r\nof panic-stricken insects, crawling, hopping, and flying in their\r\nendeavors to escape destruction; large, hairy tarantulas crawl to the\r\ntops of bushes and leap from leaf to leaf, only to be discovered and\r\nrouted, until in despair they spring to the ground, which by this time\r\nis one surging mass of ants, where they are despatched in short order.\r\nI have seen scorpions and centipedes eight inches long suffer a similar\r\nfate; no living thing seems to escape the avalanche of destruction.\r\nFlocks of ant-birds usually follow in the wake of the army, feeding\r\nupon the ants and upon the insects that have been driven from their\r\nhiding-places. One of the questions that naturally arises in this\r\nconnection is how the callow young of birds escape from the ants, as\r\ncaged birds are not immune from their attacks, and dead or wounded\r\nbirds placed near the army’s line of march are quickly discovered,\r\ntorn to shreds, and carried away. While in British Guiana I had been\r\nwatching the nest of an ant-wren containing two helpless young, placed\r\nin the crotch of a tree a few feet above the ground, for several days;\r\none morning the whole region was swarming with ants and the nest was\r\nempty; however, not long after, and also on subsequent days, both\r\nparent birds were seen contentedly carrying food into a thicket fifty\r\nyards away. A casual search failed to reveal the new nest, but to my\r\nmind there was no doubt that the young birds had been removed upon the\r\napproach of danger; one of the adults was marked in a peculiar manner,\r\nso that there was no mistake in the identity of the pair. Doubtless\r\nthis was an exceptional case, and in the vast majority of instances\r\nyoung birds perish in common with the other creatures which are\r\noverwhelmed by the ants.\r\n\r\nOn the day following our arrival at the little village we boarded a\r\nwaiting launch sent from the Madeira to meet us--the _Jayme_, she\r\nwas called--and started on the final stretch down the stream; within\r\nan hour we reached the boundary-line of Matto Grosso and entered the\r\ngreat state of Amazonas. The Gy-Paraná had assumed the proportions of\r\na mighty river; it is doubtless one of the largest, if not the longest\r\naffluent of the Madeira, and frequently the distance between banks was\r\nnot less than half a league. The water was yellow and there was little\r\ncurrent; frequently we ran into drifts of floating trees, branches, and\r\npatches of grass that had been washed out of the flooded areas. There\r\nwas no opening in the tall, tropical forest which stretched into the\r\ndistance and disappeared in one long, unbroken vista of deepest green.\r\nToward evening we reached the mouth of the Gy-Paraná and entered the\r\nvast, muddy expanse of the Madeira; we crossed to the other side and\r\nlanded at a small port called Calama, the home of Senhor Asensi, owner\r\nof the rubber-camps we had passed on the last days of our journey down\r\nthe river. Senhor Asensi very courteously placed his comfortable home\r\nat our disposal and suggested that we remain as his guests until we\r\nhad in some measure recuperated from our rather trying experiences,\r\nand we were glad to accept his hospitality. Practically every member\r\nof the party had suffered from frequent and severe attacks of fever,\r\nalthough half a gram of quinine had been taken by each one daily,\r\nand some of the _camaradas_ were so ill that they had to be carried\r\nashore; the latter were sent to Manaos on the first available steamer\r\nfor medical treatment. I was particularly eager to spend some time\r\nat Calama, as the locality appeared to offer unusual opportunities\r\nfor zoological work. After a few days of thorough rest the Brazilian\r\nmembers of the party started up-river to Santo Antonio, for a tour of\r\nthe Madeira-Mamoré railroad, while I remained to investigate the fauna\r\nof the region.\r\n\r\nThe country back of Calama is high and undulating, so that it remains\r\nuntouched by the water that covers the lowlands during the wet season.\r\nA small space which had been cleared around the building was covered\r\nwith a fine growth of grass and low bushes, and served as pasture for\r\na few head of cattle; small birds, such as flycatchers, grass-finches,\r\nand tanagers teemed in the opening, and many thick-billed green\r\nparrots squawked in the tree-tops at the edge of the forest. A short\r\ndistance below the landing there was an extensive swamp and many small\r\nbrush-covered islands; masses of aquatic plants floated in the quiet,\r\nopen pools, conspicuous among which was the beautiful _Victoria regia_,\r\nwith leaves four feet in diameter. In the dense, tangled vegetation\r\nthat grew out of the black depths of the murky swamp-water we found\r\nflocks of _hoatzins_, or lizard-birds, curious archaic creatures which\r\nretain some of the characteristics of their reptilian ancestors; they\r\nare about the size of a pheasant, of an olive color above and yellowish\r\nbelow; a high crest crowns the head, and they possess only a limited\r\npower of flight. It was the height of the nesting-season, and many of\r\nthe fragile platforms of sticks contained two or three yellowish eggs,\r\nheavily spotted with reddish-brown; the wings of the young are provided\r\nwith long, sharp claws which enable them to climb about over the\r\nbranches like lizards; hence their name.\r\n\r\nAll travelling through the swamp had to be done in a canoe; and pushing\r\nthe dugout through the almost solid mass of branches and creepers was\r\na difficult task. Every twig seemed to swarm with small red ants,\r\ncalled fire-ants, on account of the intense burning sensation produced\r\nby their bites, and they were constantly dropping upon us in scores.\r\nSeveral times we blundered into _maribundi_ nests, and in each instance\r\nthe outraged wasps promptly retaliated. Large _iguanas_ jumped out of\r\nthe trees into the water with a loud splash as we passed underneath,\r\nand troops of woolly monkeys deserted the wild cashew-trees in which\r\nthey fed and beat a hasty retreat. The swamp was full of life, but we\r\nrarely recovered anything we shot; the caymans and _piranhas_ with\r\nwhich the water was infested usually snapped up our specimens before\r\nwe could reach them. At night we set throw-lines and caught the great\r\n_pacu_, a fish of the _piranha_ family; but unlike its bloodthirsty\r\nrelative it prefers a vegetable diet. A _pirarucú_, six feet long and\r\nweighing two hundred and fifty pounds, was also taken; this is the\r\nlargest fish that inhabits Amazonian waters; the scales are an inch and\r\na half in diameter and of a silvery color, those of the latter half\r\nof the body being margined with deep scarlet. It is delicious, either\r\nfresh or salted.\r\n\r\nThe forest back of Calama contained about as much game as is ever found\r\nin one spot in South America. There were deer, agoutis, and peccaries,\r\nbut it was impossible to penetrate far into the interior on account of\r\nthe Parintintin Indians, who make this region their stronghold. These\r\nIndians have always maintained a hostile attitude toward the settlers.\r\nAn attack was made on Calama one day at noon just as luncheon was being\r\nserved; from out of the dead silence of midday there suddenly came a\r\nshower of arrows; this was promptly answered by rifle-shots from the\r\nhouse, and the Indians immediately fled. Thirty bamboo arrows were\r\ngathered up, many of them five feet tall, with barbs on each side of\r\nthe head; some of the shafts were wrapped with hair and skin taken from\r\nthe victims of previous raids.\r\n\r\nThe Parintintins are of medium stature and well built; they are\r\nfrequently at war with their near neighbors, the Mundrucus; when\r\nhostilities are in progress, which is nearly always, the front of the\r\nhead is shaven, leaving only a round spot of short hair no larger than\r\na silver half-dollar in the centre; the hair on the back of the head\r\nremains long.\r\n\r\nThe Mundrucus have the curious custom of preserving the heads of the\r\nParintintins slain in battle; one of these I subsequently saw, prepared\r\nsomewhat in the same manner as those formerly so highly prized by the\r\nhead-hunters of Ecuador. Apparently the head had been smoked, and the\r\neyes had been replaced with balls of pitch; it was a weird trophy,\r\nsuggestive of wild orgies and cannibalistic rites performed in the\r\ndepths of the jungle by the light of flickering pitch-torches, and to\r\nthe music of wailing reeds and deep-voiced tom-toms.\r\n\r\nCaptain Amilcar reached Calama about a week after our arrival. He\r\nhad suffered a second accident, in which his canoe, all his personal\r\neffects, the instruments, and practically all of his scientific data\r\nhad been lost. These incidents emphasize the uncertainty of travel and\r\nexploration on the great South American waterways, and the dangers to\r\nwhich every one is constantly subjected who ventures beyond the beaten\r\npaths of steamships and tourists’ routes.\r\n\r\nOn April 7 the _Fortaleza_, a good-sized steamer plying between Manaos\r\nand Santo Antonio, called at Calama on her down-stream journey, and we\r\nembarked for the last stage of our journey. We made excellent time,\r\nstopping only at long intervals for the purpose of taking aboard\r\nBrazil nuts. On the 9th of April we entered the Amazon, and the next\r\nmorning found us steaming up the Rio Negro, with Manaos visible in\r\nthe distance. It had been fifty-two days since the division of the\r\nexpedition at the River of Doubt.\r\n\r\nUpon reaching Manaos we found that as yet no word had been received\r\nfrom Colonel Roosevelt and his party, who were supposedly still on the\r\n_Rio da Duvida_. A steamer, provided with comforts which would indeed\r\nbe welcome to the explorers after their long, arduous voyage in canoes,\r\nhad been sent up the river; with each passing day the excitement grew\r\nmore intense in Manaos, and many conjectures were made as to the\r\nprobable date of the return of that expedition.\r\n\r\nBefore embarking on the unknown river Colonel Roosevelt had requested\r\nme to wait for him should I reach Manaos first, and in the event of his\r\narriving in advance of our party he would await our return. I therefore\r\nspent a pleasant week in the city, and was treated with the utmost\r\ncourtesy by the governor and the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nI had become acquainted with a Senhor Ramos, who invited me to visit a\r\nranch he was opening some distance up the Solimões, so I accompanied\r\nhim, hoping to add new treasures to the large collections we had\r\nbrought from the Gy-Paraná and the Madeira. After spending a profitable\r\nweek at this _fazenda_ we repaired to another locality on a different\r\nbranch of the river.\r\n\r\nThe latter region proved fully as interesting as the first, but\r\nscarcely had we become well established in our new surroundings than\r\nwe were awakened one morning about one o’clock by the sharp blasts of\r\na siren from the river below. We reached the water’s edge in a few\r\nmoments, and there found a large steam-launch resting at anchor, the\r\ncaptain of which brought the good news that the long-absent expedition\r\nhad arrived at Manaos. Half an hour later we were aboard, steaming at\r\nfull speed down the river, arriving about seven o’clock in the city.\r\n\r\nThe story of Colonel Roosevelt’s experiences on the unexplored river is\r\nwell known. Owing to illness during the many weeks’ struggle against\r\nall but insurmountable difficulties, he had wasted to a mere shadow of\r\nhis former self; but his unbounded enthusiasm remained undiminished.\r\n\r\nShortly after noon on May 1 we boarded the S. S. _Dunstan_, on which we\r\nproceeded down the Amazon to Pará, and at that city transferred to the\r\n_Aiden_ for the long, uneventful voyage home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nDOWN THE COAST OF PERU--LAKE TITICACA AND LA PAZ--THROUGH THE ANCIENT\r\nINCAN EMPIRE TO COCHABAMBA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe coast of Peru looked decidedly uninviting as day after day the\r\nS. S. _Palena_ of the Chilean Line nosed her way southward through\r\nthe placid water of the Pacific. The high, rocky shore stretched on\r\ninterminably, it seemed; no graceful palm or speck of green of any kind\r\ngladdened the eye; there were only the barren cliffs, against which the\r\nswell dashed itself into snowy spray and, above them, slopes of hot\r\nbrown sand.\r\n\r\nThis was in sharp contrast with the low Ecuadorian shore-line; that\r\nwas bad enough, with its dense, dark jungles growing to the water’s\r\nvery edge, its overhanging masses of black clouds, and its breathless\r\nheat and silence that seemed to exude all the fatal maladies of a\r\ntropical clime. Nevertheless, there was a suggestion of life of\r\nsome sort--inhospitable though it might be. It was not as if an\r\noutraged divinity had seared the land with withering breaths of hate,\r\nannihilating everything that possessed or gave promise of life, and\r\nleaving only the scorched desert as a fearsome reminder of celestial\r\nvengeance. But if the land appeared forsaken, the ocean teemed with\r\nlife. Flocks of gulls always remained in the vicinity of the ship, and\r\noccasionally we saw petrels, shearwaters, and albatrosses; whales were\r\nnot particularly plentiful, but porpoises appeared practically every\r\nday. Toward the end of the voyage seals also grew abundant.\r\n\r\nThere are numbers of ports along the Peruvian coast and the _Palena_\r\nstopped at many of them. The enormous swell coming from the south\r\nand scarcely felt at sea spends its violence along the shore, making\r\nlanding very difficult, and often impossible. Steamships dare not\r\napproach close to the jutting rocks. All freight is unloaded into\r\nlighters; passengers are lowered in a chair operated by a steam-winch\r\nand dumped into the huge, flat-bottomed freight-carriers, together with\r\ntheir belongings. This always causes a good deal of excitement and not\r\ninfrequently slight injuries are inflicted, as the boats are low one\r\ninstant and come racing up the next on the top of a mountainous swell.\r\n\r\nAt noon on the eighth day out from Panama we reached Paita. The town\r\nlies on the beach and just below the edge of a high sandy plateau. This\r\nis the centre of Peru’s oil-fields. Tanks were visible in the country\r\nnear the town, and a thin film covered the water for several miles\r\noff-shore.\r\n\r\nSalavery is a small town with flat, square board houses. In back of\r\nit rise high escarpments of rock and sand. It never rains, so water\r\nis brought from a little valley far distant in the foot-hills. A\r\nnarrow-gauge railroad connects the valley with the port, and sugar is\r\nbrought out for export.\r\n\r\nIt seems as if most of the coastal towns are merely ports or outlets\r\nfor products from the interior. There are many fertile little spots\r\nbetween the ridges branching off from the main range; they are well\r\nwatered by melting snow on the lofty summits, and a great variety of\r\nfruit, vegetables, cotton, and cane are grown.\r\n\r\nAfter ten days the ship anchored off Callao; it is but a thirty\r\nminutes’ train ride from this port to Lima. The route is flat and\r\nruns through corn, banana, and yucca fields and truck-gardens. We\r\nvisited the creditable zoo and then accepted an invitation to inspect\r\nthe medical college. The latter is surprisingly well equipped and had\r\nan attendance of over eight hundred students. The great cathedral\r\nnext occupied our attention; the massive temple was in itself most\r\ninteresting, but curiosity led me to spend the most of our limited time\r\nviewing the remains of Pizarro, which are exhibited in a glass-panelled\r\nmarble casket. An inscription informs the viewers that the\r\n_conquistador_ founded Lima in 1535; he died June 26, 1541, and was\r\nburied under the cathedral; in 1891 the bones were exhumed and placed\r\nin their present resting-place. If one may believe the statements of\r\nhistorians, a monument built of the skeletons of his helpless victims\r\nwould be a far more suitable memorial to the bloodthirsty outlaw than\r\nthe place of worship which his remains of necessity must defile.\r\n\r\nWe had heard a great deal about the difficulty of landing at Mollendo.\r\nAt times the rollers from the south are so immense that ships do not\r\nattempt an anchorage, but continue the voyage down to Arica. We were\r\nrelieved to find the sea perfectly smooth upon our arrival. The town\r\ndiffered from Paita and Salavery only in that it was somewhat larger.\r\nWe found it possible to purchase through tickets to La Paz, and noon\r\nsaw us on our way. The railroad started up the barren slope almost\r\nimmediately; occasionally the incline was very gentle--so gentle, in\r\nfact, that the country lay like a great brown desert on each side\r\nof the track. These stretches were covered with crescent-shaped\r\nsand-dunes, some of them fifty feet high and several hundred feet from\r\ntip to tip. They creep slowly forward as the wind blows the sand up\r\ntheir rear slope to the crest, when it topples over into the centre of\r\nthe half-moon.\r\n\r\nAt times the grade was very steep. The deep blue Pacific was visible\r\nseveral hours, sometimes on our right and then on our left, as the\r\ntrain wound up the mountainside, but always receding until it resembled\r\na vast mist-enshrouded amethyst losing itself in the distance.\r\n\r\nAlkali-dust entered the coaches in clouds and threatened to suffocate\r\nthe passengers, but the impressiveness of the scenery more than\r\ncompensated them for this annoyance.\r\n\r\nNot far from Arequipa a deep gorge appeared with a stream threading its\r\nway through the bottom. Its banks were covered with trees and green\r\nvegetation--a veritable oasis amid the desert that hemmed it in on\r\nboth sides. The Indians who now came to the car-windows when the train\r\nstopped to get up steam brought grapes, figs, oranges, guavas, and\r\n_empanadas_, or meat pies smelling strongly of onions. They were an\r\nunkempt, wild-looking lot and had apparently come from the green vale\r\nbelow. At seven o’clock we were up seven thousand feet, having ascended\r\nto that height from sea-level in six hours, and drew in at the station\r\nof Arequipa.\r\n\r\nThere was no train for Puno the following day, so ample time was at our\r\ndisposal in which to see the city and its immediate environs.\r\n\r\nWe found Arequipa to be a most delightful place. It was cool enough\r\nto permit the wearing of top-coats with comfort. The people were well\r\ndressed and healthy appearing. Electric trains provided adequate\r\nmeans of journeying from one part of the city to another, and if one\r\npreferred a carriage it also was obtainable. Beautiful plazas, ancient\r\nchurches, and wooden buildings are distributed promiscuously among\r\nthe rabble of low adobe or stone huts which predominate, and herds of\r\nllamas thread their way through the stone-paved streets. The atmosphere\r\nis so clear the year around that a spot near the city has been chosen\r\nfor the site of the Harvard Observatory. One has a good view of the\r\ngreat snow-capped Mount Misti from every part of the city; the peak is\r\nconical in shape and nineteen thousand two hundred and fifty feet in\r\nheight.\r\n\r\nContinuing the trip from Arequipa, the first stage of the route passes\r\nover barren, gently rolling country. Small irrigated plots are not\r\nuncommon where some rivulet trickles down from the upper world of snow\r\nand ice; they support a limited population of Indians, which must lead\r\na forlorn and miserable life among their desolate surroundings. Farther\r\non, the slopes assumed a friendlier appearance; sparse vegetation in\r\npatches appeared and grew denser toward the snow-line, where there was\r\nnaturally more moisture. Life followed closely in the wake of the grass\r\nand bush covered areas. Native hovels became more numerous, and flocks\r\nof llamas, sheep, and goats, with a sprinkling of horses and cattle,\r\nfed on the herbage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Country around Arequipa, showing Mount Misti.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The expedition en route via hand-car, Changollo to\r\nArce.]\r\n\r\nThe top of the divide is fourteen thousand five hundred feet above\r\nsea-level. As we approached it numbers of passengers became violently\r\nill of _soroche_, or mountain-sickness. They acted very much like\r\npeople aboard a steamship on a stormy voyage, although this illness\r\nseemed far worse than any seasickness I had ever seen. Several of\r\nthe stricken ones rolled about on the floor and tried to tear off\r\ntheir clothing; a feeling of suffocation accompanies the nausea, and\r\noccasionally some one dies.\r\n\r\nBeyond the ridge the country is level or gently rolling and there are\r\nnumerous clear blue lakes--some of considerable size. Immense flocks of\r\ndoves make this upland region their home, and ducks, gulls, and herons\r\nteemed about the water.\r\n\r\nJust after dark we reached Puno, and a few minutes later embarked on\r\nthe _Coya_ for the trip across Lake Titicaca. The night was so cold and\r\nstormy that it was impossible to spend much time on the upper deck, and\r\nthe cabins were so crowded that sleeping in comfort was impossible.\r\nThe ship was small and overcrowded with people of many colors and\r\nnationalities; most of them spent the night in the dining-saloon\r\ndrinking and gaming.\r\n\r\nDawn came at last, and shortly afterward the _Coya_ slowly wended her\r\nway through the reed-grown marshes bordering the lake and tied up\r\nat the pier at Guaqui, on the Bolivian side. Indians in reed rafts\r\nwith sails made of rushes dashed past and disappeared among the\r\ncattails, and water-fowl of several species--mostly ducks, coots, and\r\ngrebes--paddled out into the ruffled water left in the wake of the boat.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that this passage of the lake is made at night.\r\nNearly every one visiting the vast body of water for the first time is\r\neager to see as much of it as possible, both on account of its being\r\nthe highest great lake in the world (twelve thousand five hundred feet\r\nabove sea-level) and by reason of its associations with the nation of\r\nthe Incas.\r\n\r\nGuaqui is a garrison town. There were numerous soldiers in evidence\r\non the streets, and a troop of lancers, under the command of a German\r\nofficer, were giving a skilful display of their prowess on the lake\r\nfront. Their mounts were not much to look at and the uniforms of the\r\nmen were rather shabby, but both were well drilled.\r\n\r\nThe train for La Paz left at noon. It moved at a good rate of speed\r\nacross the high, level upland. The scenery is impressive. We were\r\nalways in sight of snow-covered peaks, although there was little snow\r\non the plateau itself. Indian huts built of stone, some very ancient,\r\nare scattered about abundantly, but it requires some experience in\r\nlocating them before they can be readily distinguished from their\r\nimmediate surroundings. There were numerous fields of wheat and oats,\r\nand llamas without number nibbled the scant vegetation on the slope.\r\nIn a few isolated spots small herds of cattle, horses, and pigs were\r\nvisible. Indians came to the coach-windows to sell fruits when the\r\ntrain stopped; they were doubtless brought from the deep, sheltered\r\nfissures that have been cut into the range by snow-water from high\r\npeaks.\r\n\r\nWithin a short time we had reached the ruins of an enormous city called\r\nTiahuanaco, which is said to date back many centuries before the Incan\r\nera. When discovered it was buried in the sand level with the surface\r\nof the plateau, but archæologists have excavated many of the larger\r\nbuildings and brought to light ancient treasures of rare beauty. Later,\r\nin La Paz, we met a man named Poznaski who had done a great deal of\r\nwork in this region. He had a remarkable collection of hundreds of\r\nskulls, pieces of pottery, gold ornaments, and well-preserved cloth.\r\nAmong the ceramics was a “death’s head” of exquisite workmanship, life\r\nsize, and painted in gorgeous colors. He considered it the finest bit\r\nof pottery ever discovered in Bolivia and stated that a North American\r\nmuseum was negotiating for its purchase at a price that ran into five\r\nfigures. This, however, did not seem probable. As we neared La Paz,\r\nthe great mountains of Illimani, Murarata, and Huana Potosi loomed\r\nconstantly more lofty and forbidding before us. They are the patriarchs\r\nof the Bolivian Andes, and are twenty-two thousand five hundred and\r\neighty-one, twenty-one thousand, and twenty thousand two hundred and\r\neighty-nine feet high respectively. The summits of all three have been\r\nreached by venturesome exploration-parties, but the task of climbing\r\nthe steep, slippery slopes perpetually covered with deep snow and swept\r\nby frigid gales is a trying one that is not often attempted. Huana\r\nPotosi, the more distant of the group has a flat top, contrasting\r\nconspicuously with the sharp, pointed summits of the other two. The\r\nIndians tell a legend that explains this peculiar formation. In the\r\ndays of long ago, when the world was young, vapors enveloped all the\r\nearth; suddenly the sun-god appeared and, beaming down from heaven,\r\ncaused the mists to become dissipated and vanish. Illimani awoke to\r\nlife and from his dizzy height beheld the queenly Huana Potosi smiling\r\nup at him. At the same time, however, Murarata emerged from the clouds\r\nand beholding the beautiful Huana Potosi fell violently in love with\r\nher. Illimani became insanely jealous and in a blind fury hurled forth\r\nfire, smoke, and stones of great size at his rival’s head; the latter\r\npromptly replied in kind and fought valiantly. For days the earth\r\nquaked and trembled with the thunderous roar of the death-struggle,\r\nwhile heavy clouds covered the terrifying spectacle with a mantle\r\nof darkness. After a seemingly endless time the combat stopped;\r\ndaylight returned, revealing an appalling state of affairs. Finding it\r\nimpossible to vanquish the rival suitor, Illimani had beheaded his fair\r\nlady-love to prevent her from falling into the other’s hands. The many\r\nstreams of water rushing down the steep sides of Illimani are but the\r\ntears of grief and remorse over his hasty action; thus he is doomed to\r\nmourn and weep until the end of time. The legend has doubtless been\r\nhanded down through many generations and obviously refers to one of the\r\nmany volcanic disturbances that must have occurred when the Andes were\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\nShortly before sundown we came suddenly to the brink of a crater-like\r\nrent in the plateau and, on the bottom of the huge gash, thirteen\r\nhundred feet below, we could see the compactly built mass of edifices\r\nand green gardens of La Paz. The situation of the city is unique. One\r\nhas no intimation of its nearness while speeding over the high, cold\r\n_plano alto_ (which has an elevation of thirteen thousand three hundred\r\nfeet) until the very edge of the fissure is reached. The sides are\r\nprecipitous, but numerous footpaths make their way up or down the steep\r\ndeclivity. The far slopes of the Andes are checkered with cultivated\r\nfields; a roaring stream, the Choqueyapu, tears its way through the\r\nfloor of the amphitheatre, and the series of snow-covered summits form\r\na magnificent background for the unusual spectacle.\r\n\r\nThe steam-locomotive was taken off and an electric one substituted, and\r\nthen the train slowly backed down along the face of the incline to the\r\nstation below.\r\n\r\nThe impression of La Paz, gained from the first brief view above, is\r\nsoon dispersed upon nearer and more intimate acquaintance. The streets\r\nare narrow, crooked, paved with small stones from the river-bed,\r\nand very steep. Walking any length of time entails a great amount\r\nof exertion on account of the high altitude; fortunately, carriages\r\nare not lacking, and a tramway also provides a ready means of\r\nlocomotion, or I am afraid few travellers would ever see very much\r\nof the inner life of the city. With the exception of a few churches\r\nand government buildings that are worthy of note on account of their\r\nsize and architecture, the buildings are low and of a primitive type,\r\nwhitewashed and covered with tiles or thatched.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily the streets are all but deserted, but on Sundays and\r\nfête-days a motley crowd throngs the winding thoroughfares. There are\r\nfull-blooded Indians of the Aymará race, clothed in picturesque though\r\nnot beautiful garments; half-breeds or Cholos are far more gayly clad\r\nin very full skirts and shawls of bright colors, round, flat-brimmed\r\nstraw or felt hats, and imported shoes with high heels and tops that\r\nreach almost to the knees; the number of townspeople, creoles and\r\nforeigners, seems negligible compared to the throngs of Indians and\r\nCholos; in fact, some authorities state that there are one hundred of\r\nthe latter to one of the former. On market-days long lines of llamas,\r\nburros, and mules thread their way through the crowded streets, bearing\r\nfire-wood, charcoal, meat, and vegetables for the sustenance of the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nAbout the most interesting place in La Paz to us, and at the same time\r\nthe most repellent, was the Museo Nacional. It contained several dark,\r\ncavernous rooms crowded with a wealth of specimens, mostly in the form\r\nof ceramics, minerals, and mummies. They were piled promiscuously\r\neverywhere in the most slovenly and disgusting manner. Naturally, this\r\ntreatment did not tend toward their preservation; rats had undermined\r\nthe mounds of human remains, gnawed holes into the bodies, and made\r\ntheir nests in the interior; pottery had crashed from unstable shelves,\r\nand bird and mammal skins were badly moth-eaten. I trust that a more\r\nefficient management may rescue these treasures.\r\n\r\nThe plazas, of which there are four or five, are small and not\r\nparticularly attractive. The cold climate prevents the growing of\r\ntropical decorative plants that are always so conspicuous in cities and\r\ntowns of the lower country. The _gente decente_, or upper class, meet\r\nin the Plaza de Armas on Sundays for a chat with friends, a stroll to\r\nexhibit their finery, and to listen to the music.\r\n\r\nThe Aymarás who inhabit the entire highlands are of a treacherous\r\ndisposition and have several times organized their forces preparatory\r\nto making war on the Bolivians. As their number is very great they are\r\na menace that is very real and serious. When an uprising is threatened,\r\nthe chiefs are arrested and punished, and then the rebellion dies down\r\nfor want of leaders. These Indians still retain the _despeñadora_, or\r\ndeath-doctor, in the more remote and inaccessible regions. This person\r\nis a woman who possesses the knack of doing away with the aged and\r\ninfirm of her district, and the office is handed down from mother to\r\ndaughter. When any one within her jurisdiction becomes too old to work,\r\nor is ill with a malady thought to be incurable, the _despeñadora_ is\r\ncalled in; she straddles the poor unfortunate and ends his existence\r\nby deftly dislocating the vertebræ of the neck. Whenever government\r\nofficials learn of the operation of one of these women, they are taken\r\ninto custody and punished.\r\n\r\nOne of the favorite sports of the _Paceños_ is to hunt wild cattle\r\nin the high valleys between the peaks. Numerous herds are still in\r\nexistence and it is said that they are of a savage disposition and\r\nfurnish good sport. I met an American who had been thrown from his\r\nhorse and gored by a wild bull that charged him from a distance of\r\nseveral hundred yards.\r\n\r\nThe country between La Paz and Oruro is very similar to that we had\r\ncrossed coming from Guaqui. There are the same vistas of barren plains,\r\ngreen fields, llamas, and asses on the slopes, and dazzling snow-fields\r\nin the background. The plateau is strewn with marine fossils, mostly\r\n_trilobites_, reminders of the days when Lake Titicaca was many times\r\nits present size. We covered the one hundred and twenty-seven miles\r\nto Oruro in six hours, and spent the night there. This city owes its\r\nexistence to the many mines located near by--some within the city’s\r\nlimits--and to the wealth they yield in tin, silver, and other metals.\r\nNext morning the journey was continued toward Cochabamba. Shortly\r\nbefore noon the level country was left behind and we started down the\r\neastern slope of a ridge that leads into the lower country. This part\r\nof the road-bed is new; the greater part of it is laid on a narrow\r\nshelf of rock carved and blasted out of the mountainside. Perpendicular\r\nwalls of granite tower above to a height of hundreds of feet on one\r\nside; in places the top of the huge masses seems to hang over the track\r\nin a tottering position and one expects the rumble of the train to set\r\nit in motion and bring an avalanche of destruction down upon one’s head.\r\n\r\nA small stream flows through the bottom of the gorge. During the\r\ngreater part of the year it is a mere rivulet that trickles harmlessly\r\nover the shallow, pebbly bottom of its course; but when the torrential\r\nrains of winter fall it rises rapidly to the proportions of a mighty\r\nriver and sweeps away sections of the railroad. Long rows of breakwater\r\nhave been placed alongside the base of the road-bed to protect it from\r\nthe ravages of the flood; they consist of loaf-shaped piles of stone\r\nbound together with wire netting; these would be effective against the\r\nwater alone, but they cannot resist the demolishing force of the huge\r\nboulders that are rolled down from the mountains by the strong current.\r\n\r\nA number of breaks in the line had been made by landslides just\r\nbefore our visit, so the train could not proceed beyond Changollo,\r\na settlement of half a dozen Quechua Indian huts and a good-sized\r\nstation, the elevation of which is ten thousand feet. We were met by a\r\nrepresentative of the railway company and given quarters in the station\r\nbuildings; the other passengers immediately engaged mules and llamas\r\nand started for Cochabamba. The reason for our delay was that we had\r\njust received a shipment of ammunition and supplies from New York, and\r\nsome time would be required to repack them in parcels of equal weight\r\nsuitable for transportation by pack-train.\r\n\r\nChangollo was headquarters for the construction-gangs working on the\r\nline. About half a dozen Englishmen and Scotchmen were in charge of the\r\nwork, and they showed us every possible courtesy and attention during\r\nour brief stay there. I regret constantly that it is not possible to\r\ngive detailed credit to all the people, South Americans and foreigners\r\nalike, who treated us with such unfailing courtesy throughout our\r\nyears of travel in the southern continent, and to whose assistance we\r\nare so heavily indebted for the success that attended our efforts; but\r\nto do so would fill the pages of a volume several times the size of\r\nthis one without leaving space for my narrative.\r\n\r\nAll of the railroad men boarded with an Englishman named Cole and\r\nhis wife. The Coles were a middle-aged couple who had spent the\r\ngreater part of their lives together travelling around the world.\r\nAmong other places, they had lived in India and in Africa. They had\r\na score of parrots, cockatoos, and dogs that accompanied them in all\r\ntheir wanderings; caring for this miniature menagerie must have been\r\na troublesome job while moving from place to place, but they took the\r\nplace of children and were looked after just as tenderly. Cole claimed\r\nthat he was the only man on earth who had been bitten by a black\r\nmamba--a species of giant cobra--and lived to tell the tale. He was\r\nfollowing a path through the silent jungle one day at dusk when a black\r\nform lunged down upon him from some branches that overhung the trail;\r\nat the same time he felt a dull, throbbing pain in his left arm, and\r\nrealized what had occurred. His first impulse was to flee in terror;\r\nhowever, better judgment prevailed and he opened and sucked the wound\r\nand applied a tourniquet above it. Then he hurried home and drank large\r\nquantities of ammonia and also applied some to his arm. He stated\r\nthat he was very ill for several weeks but that persistent use of the\r\nammonia overcame the effects of the poison and he gradually recovered.\r\n\r\nThrough the kindness of our new friends we secured hand-cars on which\r\nto resume the journey to the end of the line--about ten miles distant.\r\nThe baggage was placed on some of them while we occupied another.\r\nThe way lay down-hill and we dashed along at a great pace, taking\r\ncurves without diminished speed. There were several short tunnels, the\r\nentrances of which loomed up like the black openings in a grotto; in a\r\nflash we were plunged into absolute darkness; a moment later we raced\r\nback into bright sunshine. Whenever an obstruction in the track ahead\r\nwas sighted the brakes were applied and then everything was carried\r\naround and the trip continued. We met a good many Indians on the\r\nroad-bed; they preferred its use to the rocky trail along the river,\r\nand even drove their burros and llamas on it. All employees of the\r\ncompany had orders to punish any one found on the track, in order that\r\nthey might learn to keep off it, as there would otherwise be a great\r\nloss of life when trains begin their runs over the line. The favorite\r\nform of chastisement consisted of pouncing on the Indians and taking\r\ntheir hats away from them. The head-gear was taken several miles down\r\nthe track and thrown into the top of a cactus or thorny tree. If the\r\noffender resisted the seizure of his hat he was told that he might have\r\nit by calling on the foreman of the nearest construction-camp; when he\r\narrived a good lecture was given him and in some instances a fine was\r\nimposed.\r\n\r\nIt took several hours to reach the end of the line, as landslides and\r\nthe attendant portages around them had been numerous. We spent the\r\nremainder of the day and the night at Arce, an Indian village. Several\r\nhundred Quechuas had gathered, as it was market-day; they brought a\r\ngood deal of cloth and beautiful blankets to sell, but their prices\r\nwere several times those asked in more remote regions. At night the\r\nassembly played on reed flutes and native guitars, sang, danced, and\r\ndrank _chicha_; the revelry lasted until the first gray streaks of dawn\r\nappeared over the mountain-top, and then the mob dispersed to their\r\ndistant homes in the high valleys.\r\n\r\nOur journey was continued the morning after reaching Arce. We had\r\nsecured a train of good, strong mules and expert Indian _arrieros_.\r\nThe trail lay along the river-bed, which was very wide and paved with\r\nsmall pebbles. At numerous points Quechua women had put up small shacks\r\nof stones and reeds; they squatted within the makeshift shelters all\r\nday long. A white rag floating above from a tall bamboo announced\r\nto the weary wayfarer that _chicha_ was for sale within, and all the\r\ntravellers we saw religiously stopped at each of these road-houses to\r\nslake their thirst. At one point a wall of rock rises from the stream\r\nto a height of three thousand feet; two condors were perched upon the\r\nvery tip, their black forms clearly outlined against the sky, while two\r\nothers circled swiftly above. We passed through the towns of Yberta and\r\nSacamolla without stopping to rest, and after fifteen and a half hours’\r\ncontinuous riding reached the home of the manager of the railroad, a\r\nMr. Taylor, with whom we spent the night. The place is called Parotani,\r\nand we subsequently spent some time there investigating its interesting\r\nfauna. At noon on the following day we reached Vinto, which marks\r\nthe beginning of an electric tram-line to Cochabamba. We did not\r\ntake advantage of this easy means of transportation, but continued\r\nthe journey on mule-back, and two hours later found ourselves at our\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nCROSSING THE BOLIVIAN HIGHLANDS FROM COCHABAMBA TO THE CHAPARÉ\r\n\r\n\r\nCochabamba is one of the more important cities of Bolivia. In size it\r\nranks next to La Paz, although it is not nearly so modern, and in point\r\nof activity it is far in advance of Sucre. The population is about\r\nthirty-five thousand.\r\n\r\nThe plain upon which the city is built was at one time the bottom\r\nof a lake, which fact is indicated by its ancient name of Oropeza,\r\na Quechua word meaning “plain of the lake.” On account of its high\r\nelevation, which is approximately eight thousand five hundred feet\r\nabove sea-level, the region enjoys a mild climate; the average annual\r\ntemperature is 66° F. Rain falls in abundance during the months from\r\nNovember to April; and during the dry months irrigation is resorted to\r\nfor providing water to the fields of alfalfa and grain. The country is\r\nnaturally of a decidedly semiarid character.\r\n\r\nThe city boasts a number of fairly modern buildings, although by\r\nfar the greater number are of the low adobe type with thatched or\r\ntile roofs; delightful little plazas filled with tropical trees and\r\nshrubbery relieve the monotony of the rows of white edifices.\r\n\r\nThe shops are filled with provisions and dry-goods at remarkably low\r\nprices; the city market is supplied with a superabundance of produce,\r\nflowers, and articles of native manufacture; the people are courteous\r\nand obliging, and the great numbers of Indians and Cholos give a touch\r\nof gayety and color to the throngs which fill the streets.\r\n\r\nAmong the city’s institutions deserving of special mention is the\r\nCochabamba Institute, founded in 1911. The instructors are nearly all\r\nAmericans of the type one meets all too rarely in South America,\r\nand who are really doing a great and noble work in furthering the\r\neducational and moral progress of the country. Several hundred students\r\nof both sexes, from many and remote parts of Bolivia, attend the\r\nliterary and business classes of the college, live under the care\r\nand refining influence of its instructors, and, as I subsequently\r\ndiscovered, introduce into their homes the desirable and elevating\r\nqualities which they have acquired.\r\n\r\nTo the northwest towers the Cerro Tunari, a mountain over fifteen\r\nthousand feet high and of imposing appearance. It rises in majestic\r\nproportions above the uneven summits of the cordillera, in a manner\r\nbefitting a snow-crowned monarch of the range.\r\n\r\nWe spent several days in the city, adding to our outfit and purchasing\r\nmules, and then started eastward _en route_ to the Beni district; it\r\nwas our intention to go slowly and stop at places which offered a\r\nsuitable field for our operations.\r\n\r\nLeaving Cochabamba on the afternoon of May 9, 1915, we rode the fifteen\r\nmiles to the town of Sacaba, arriving there at dusk. The intervening\r\ncountry is thickly settled, and large areas are irrigated and planted\r\nin alfalfa, maize, wheat, grapes, and vegetables. Nearly all the\r\ninhabitants are Indians of the Quechua race.\r\n\r\nBeyond Sacaba the trail adheres closely to the bed of a small stream,\r\nand ascends at a steep angle. Numerous little canals carry the water\r\nalong the mountainside, and the country is dotted with small stone huts\r\nsurrounded by carefully cultivated fields; this is made possible by the\r\nfact that the rivulet never dries, but, on the contrary, supplies a\r\nconstant stream of water of sufficient volume to irrigate a large area.\r\nThe canals have been dug with great precision; each family uses only as\r\nmuch as required, and at stated intervals, so there is enough for all.\r\n\r\nThe trail goes up steadily until an elevation of twelve thousand feet\r\nis reached. As we neared the top a strong wind sprang up, so that it\r\nwas difficult to keep one’s place in the saddle. The mountainside is\r\ncovered with small, round rocks of uniform size, such as one would\r\nusually expect to find in a dry river-bed.\r\n\r\nBeyond the high summit of the first ridge lies the high mountain\r\nvalley in which is located the Quechua village of Cuchicancha (meaning\r\n“pig-pen”). There are several score of huts scattered about in little\r\ngroups, and built of rocks, with thatched roofs. The Indians speak\r\npractically no Spanish, and live in much the same way as they did\r\nin the days of Atahualpa. In order to cultivate the land they have\r\ngathered the rocks which everywhere carpet the ground into huge piles,\r\nand also built fences of them; large quantities of potatoes, ocas, and\r\navas are grown.\r\n\r\nEach family owns a flock of sheep, which apparently replace the llamas\r\nof olden days, although flocks of the latter animals are still to be\r\nseen frequently; also a few pigs and burros. They have likewise taken\r\nto cultivating wheat, oats, and rye.\r\n\r\nWe decided to spend a week at Cuchicancha and succeeded in persuading\r\nan old Quechua man to rent us his hut for that length of time. He spoke\r\nnot a word of Spanish, or at least pretended that he knew nothing\r\nwhatever of that language, so all conversation had to be carried on\r\nthrough an interpreter. As our coming was a complete surprise to him,\r\nhe asked if he could occupy the habitation with us for a few nights\r\nuntil he had time to find sleeping-quarters elsewhere; to this we, of\r\ncourse, consented. One night I was awakened by loud talking, and much\r\nto my astonishment found that the aged Indian, who had evidently taken\r\ntoo much _chicha_ during the day, was restlessly tossing on his pile\r\nof sheepskins and blankets, and talking in his sleep--in excellent\r\n_Spanish_. After that we conversed with him without the aid of an\r\ninterpreter, and he understood every word of it, too.\r\n\r\nThe weather at Cuchicancha was splendid; it was autumn, and while the\r\nnights were cold, the days were always comfortably warm. The Indians\r\nwere friendly and brought us eggs, goats’ milk, chickens, and bread.\r\nEach morning the children took the flocks to the narrow river-bed to\r\nfeed on the sparse vegetation, and at night they brought them back to\r\nthe stone corrals; they took a few boiled potatoes with them for lunch,\r\nand also their spinning for pastime. All spin except the men; and every\r\none had an abundance of blankets and _ponchos_; even the bags for grain\r\nand potatoes are made of homespun wool.\r\n\r\nThe harvest had been gathered and every one seemed contented. One\r\nday a party of Indians collected to thresh wheat; from a distance I\r\ncould hear the boom of a drum and the shrill wail of reed flutes; as\r\nI approached, a strange sight met my eyes. Bundles of grain had been\r\npiled in a high mound, on the top of which sat the musicians; a dozen\r\nmounted Indians were driving a herd of mules and burros around the\r\nbase. Around and around they went at a frantic pace, keeping perfect\r\ntime with the music; as the animals circled the stack a man on top\r\ncast armfuls of wheat down in their path, so that in running over it\r\nrepeatedly they naturally trampled out the grain. About a hundred men,\r\neach holding to a long rope, formed a circular fence around the racing\r\nmob and prevented any of the animals from escaping.\r\n\r\nWe were surprised at the abundance of life in this naturally barren\r\nregion. There were practically no indigenous trees, but a long line of\r\nwillows had been planted near one of the houses, and to these thousands\r\nof cowbirds, doves, and finches came each night to sleep. A short walk\r\nacross the stubble-fields always revealed something new. There were\r\ntinamou which rose with a loud _whir_, reminding one of partridges;\r\nmany species of brownish birds belonging to the wood-hewer family, one\r\nof them with a long, curved bill, but they ran about on the ground or\r\nperched on the stone fences; large flickers lived among the rocks, and\r\ncondors soared above; and there were even flocks of gulls and plovers.\r\nThe most unusual birds were two species of very small parrakeets which\r\nclambered about over the rocks and slept in holes in the high banks.\r\nVast numbers of cavies lived in the rock-piles, from which they sallied\r\nat all hours of the day in quest of food, and many small rodents\r\ninhabited the grain-fields.\r\n\r\nA good trail leads eastward from Cochicancha; the summit of the range\r\nrises about two leagues from the settlement. At the time of our visit\r\nthe black, rocky peaks were covered with a mantle of snow and an icy\r\nwind swept through the cleft which serves as a pass. The elevation of\r\nthe trail is thirteen thousand four hundred feet. At the base of the\r\ntowering masses which rise several hundred feet above the passage,\r\nlies a placid little lake, and ducks, and gulls were swimming on its\r\npeaceful surface. Condors swept down from above to inspect us, and then\r\nsoared back to their dizzy perches among the unscalable crags.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern side of the divide the trail leads downward abruptly,\r\nand the character of the country changes; at eleven thousand feet a\r\nsparse growth of bushes appears, growing denser with each passing mile.\r\nSuddenly we found ourselves on the rim of a gorge through which the\r\nIncachaca River rushes--a raging mountain torrent fed by snows melting\r\nin the high altitudes. The path is a mere shelf cut in the face of the\r\ncliff; to the left rise the smooth walls of frowning, black rock; to\r\nthe right is a sheer drop to the river. We could peer over the edge of\r\nthe precipice and see drifting clouds two thousand feet below, filling\r\nthe chasm and shutting from view the bottom hundreds of feet lower down.\r\n\r\nAt seven thousand seven hundred feet the forest begins; a collection\r\nof half a dozen huts called Incachaca nestles in its inner border,\r\nand there we decided to remain for a few weeks. We secured space in a\r\nlarge house belonging to an organization which is engaged in digging a\r\ncanal along the opposite side of the gorge; when this work is completed\r\nthe water of the river will be turned into the artificial course and\r\nutilized for running dynamos to furnish electricity for the light and\r\nstreet-car service of Cochabamba. A power-house had been constructed at\r\nthe bottom of the ravine, and the lines for transmitting the current\r\nhad been strung across the mountains.\r\n\r\nAt Incachaca the river flows through an underground channel; while\r\nexploring the forest one day we came suddenly upon the narrow cleft in\r\nthe mountainside, scarcely a dozen feet across, and with a great deal\r\nof effort were finally able to distinguish the roaring white torrent a\r\nhundred feet below. The edges of the cleft are so overgrown with ferns\r\nthat one has no idea of its existence until the very brink is reached.\r\nA short distance below, the river emerges from the darkened cavern, and\r\nplunging over the face of a precipice, thunders into a pool in a sheer\r\ndrop of fifty or sixty feet.\r\n\r\nWe found the upper limit of a subtropical fauna at Incachaca.\r\nBird-flocks travelled hurriedly through the trees; they were composed\r\nof bright-colored tanagers, finches, and cotingas. Honey-creepers and\r\nhummers were plentiful in the flowering shrubs. Queer little ducks\r\ncalled merganettas disported in the pool below the falls, and dippers\r\nran nimbly along the edge of the water. In one of the tall trees near\r\nthe river we discovered the nest of an eagle. We found it impossible to\r\nclimb the tree, but a German named Ricardo Marquardt, who was in charge\r\nof the workmen along the river, succeeded in reaching the huge mass of\r\nsticks seventy feet above the ground, and brought down a beautifully\r\nspotted egg. To my companion, Mr. Howarth S. Boyle, who accompanied\r\nme on the entire trip, belongs the credit of taking the rarest\r\nbirds from this locality; they were a pair of white-eared thrushes\r\n(_Entomodestes_), which, so far as I can learn, exist in only two other\r\nmuseums. Among the lower growth lived many ant-thrushes (_Grallaria_),\r\nwhose clear call could be heard at all hours of the day. This is one\r\nof the hardest of all birds to collect. The long-legged, tailless\r\nsongsters never leave the thick growth of ferns and brush, and the\r\nonly way to secure them is to enter the dense cover, sit quietly, and\r\nimitate the clear, ringing call in the hope of attracting the birds;\r\nsometimes this requires hours of patient work, and more often than not\r\nthe effort is futile.\r\n\r\nCoatimondis, or raccoons, roamed in the woods in small bands, sniffing\r\nin the damp mould and searching for insects; while feeding they uttered\r\ndeep grunts, but when frightened they gave a succession of rapid\r\nbird-like chirps. These animals spend a good deal of their time in the\r\ntrees, but are almost invariably found on the ground in the daytime;\r\nwhen pursued they are very pugnacious and it takes an exceptionally\r\nagile dog indeed to avoid being severely torn by the sharp teeth and\r\nclaws. In captivity they become very tame, and make nice little pets,\r\nalthough their mischievous disposition often gets them into trouble.\r\n\r\nFrom Incachaca to Locotál is a distance of only eight miles, but the\r\nscenery along a part of the route is as impressive as any to be found\r\nin the entire Andean chain; perhaps the gorge of the Urubamba, in Peru,\r\nalone equals it in grandeur and awe-inspiring magnificence. The bare,\r\nshattered, and split crags reach many hundred feet above the trail,\r\nand stand in a leaning position so that the tops actually hang over\r\nthe narrow passageway as if threatening to topple over at any moment;\r\nbelow, the steep slope is covered with huge boulders which have fallen\r\nfrom the towering masses above.\r\n\r\nAt Locotál there are but half a dozen houses, occupied by Quechua\r\nfamilies who subsist mainly on the profits derived from the sale of\r\n_chicha_. We stopped a few days in a hut owned by a kind-hearted old\r\nwoman who gave us permission to use it; next day we found that we were\r\noccupying the schoolroom, and the teacher followed by his half-dozen\r\nragged scholars came to take possession. He tried to show us how\r\nimportant it was to have the place at once, but we saw no reason why he\r\ncould not conduct his class out under the trees just as well as under\r\nthe shelter; this suggestion offended him very much, so greatly to\r\nthe delight of the pupils he declared a vacation until the _gringos_\r\nshould move on.\r\n\r\n_Chicha_, the native drink of Quechuas and Bolivians alike, is a kind\r\nof corn-beer; it is made by grinding maize into a fine meal, after\r\nwhich the women and children thoroughly masticate a part of it; water\r\nis added to the mass and the thick liquid is boiled several hours,\r\nafter which it is poured into jars to ferment; it is of a yellow color,\r\nhas a tart, agreeable taste, and is intoxicating.\r\n\r\nThe forest at Locotál is somewhat taller than at Incachaca, but the\r\nbirds are of a similar character. Very abundant and beautiful were the\r\nbrilliant cocks-of-the-rock; the bright, orange-red creatures flashed\r\nthrough the deep green of the forest like fiery comets and, perching\r\non the low branch of a tree, quietly surveyed their surrounding, or\r\nuttered hoarse, croaking calls. This bird is most conspicuous in its\r\nnatural environment. Among the other large birds were green toucans\r\n(_Aulacorhynchus_); the natives hunted them on every possible occasion\r\nfor the sake of obtaining the bill, which they use as _remedio_, the\r\nrasping sound made by rubbing the mandibles together being supposed to\r\nbe an unfailing cure for epilepsy.\r\n\r\nWhile pursuing our work at Locotál, a man named Quiroga chanced to\r\npass, and begged that we pay him the honor of stopping at his house\r\nsome distance below; it was a charming place, he said, in the very\r\nheart of the wonderful Yungas. We gladly accepted his invitation, and\r\none morning loaded our outfit on mules and started down the trail. For\r\na mile there is only a narrow ledge in the face of a rounded mountain\r\nof dark sandstone; a few stunted sprouts, and myriads of orchids\r\ncovered with purple blooms, have secured a precarious foothold in\r\ncrevices in the glazed surface; hundreds of feet below, but invisible,\r\nthe river tears through a narrow gorge. At one point a strip of the\r\nshelf upon which we travelled had entirely disappeared; we could not\r\nsee the bottom of the canyon--its depth was too great--but there were\r\nevidences we could not mistake, telling us the history of the gap in\r\nthe trail. Vultures hovered over the spot and perched on the scant\r\nvegetation, and from below came an overpowering stench. What more was\r\nneeded to reveal the fact that the missing section of trail, in its\r\nmad dash through space, had taken with it the pack-train of mules, and\r\nprobably the men attending them, which chanced to be passing at the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nMiguelito is only three miles below Locotál, and consists of three or\r\nfour huts in the centre of a grassy clearing. The Quechuas who live\r\nthere are friendly, and one may be sure of a welcome for a night’s stop.\r\n\r\nAt five thousand five hundred feet the forest becomes taller and the\r\ntrees attain a greater diameter. The vegetation of the subtropic zone\r\nreaches its highest development at this altitude. After crossing a\r\nridge six thousand seven hundred feet high, the trail descends a long\r\nslope into the Yungas, properly known as the Yungas of Cochabamba. At\r\nthe base of the ridge, and shortly before entering the cultivated area,\r\nwe crossed the dry, narrow bed of a stream which was filled with rocks\r\nbearing the imprints of leaves, and also fossil shells.\r\n\r\nYungas is the name given to the fertile mountain slopes which have\r\nbeen cleared of forest and cultivated; it stretches along the sides\r\nof the Rio Yungas for a number of miles, and huts dot the roadside\r\nat frequent intervals. When we visited the region in June only the\r\nIndian caretakers lived in the habitations, the coca, which is the\r\nprincipal product, having been collected a short time before, and the\r\n_propietarios_ having gone back to Cochabamba. The owners visit their\r\nplantations three times a year, supervise the picking and packing of\r\nthe leaves and, after a month, return to Cochabamba to sell the drug\r\nand live on the proceeds until the next harvest.\r\n\r\nAfter spending an hour in questioning the occupants of the various\r\nhouses which we passed, we succeeded in locating the house to which we\r\nhad been invited. It was a low, one-room board structure, open at both\r\nends, and with wide entrances on each side, situated in the centre\r\nof a large banana-field. An Indian, so old that he could hardly walk,\r\nlived in the hovel and refused to admit us; however, we flourished our\r\nletter of introduction from the owner of the premises, took possession,\r\nand remained a week. When we left, the aged tenant implored us to\r\nremain, as we had daily provided him with all the game he could eat,\r\nand had provided him with some medicines that he greatly needed.\r\n\r\nThe climate at this season, June, was most trying. Although the\r\nelevation is only three thousand five hundred feet, the whole region\r\nwas covered with fog each night, and the cold and damp penetrated\r\neverything; during a part of the year the weather is good, and then\r\nlife in the Yungas is more bearable. We had a trying time at Señor\r\nQuiroga’s hut, and while the pleasure of investigating a new region\r\nis always intense, our joy at leaving was in this particular instance\r\nvastly greater.\r\n\r\nThere is no flat valley along the river, which is of considerable size,\r\nand all cultivation is done on the steep mountainsides. Coca is planted\r\nin terraces and occupies the greatest acreage; then there are red\r\nbananas, plantains, guavas, and sugar-cane.\r\n\r\nThe fauna of the country seems to represent a transition zone. There\r\nare birds typical of the higher country, and others which are common\r\nlower down; also, a number found at approximately this altitude only.\r\nNear the house, and on the edge of the banana-plantation, was a tall,\r\nisolated tree. Flocks of birds, in their flight from one side of the\r\ncanyon to the other, would invariably alight in its branches for a few\r\nminutes’ rest. There were many brilliantly colored little tanagers\r\n(_Tanagra_) which came to the tree in considerable numbers and chirped\r\nand quarrelled as they flitted about examining the leaves for insects,\r\nor reached out to pick the small fruits with which the tree was\r\ncovered; one day not less than seven species of these birds visited\r\nthis resort within a short time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An Indian hut in the Yungas of Cochabamba.]\r\n\r\nGiant orioles (_Ostinops_) were also very plentiful, and travelled in\r\nlarge, noisy flocks. One of the more interesting birds was a species of\r\nsmall, red-tailed parrakeet (_Pyrrhura_) which clung to and crawled up\r\nthe sides of trees like squirrels; it was almost impossible to see them\r\nunless they moved, so well did their coloration, and more particularly\r\ntheir actions, conceal them.\r\n\r\nWe had travelled to the Yungas on mules owned by the expedition, and\r\nupon our arrival turned them loose to feed as usual. Next morning the\r\nanimals were in a sorry plight; they had been visited by vampire-bats\r\nduring the night, and bled so badly that we had to send them back to\r\nLocotál without delay. Severe as this attack seemed to be, it was mild\r\ncompared to what we were to see later on. We discovered clumps of the\r\nsmall bats guilty of the execution spending the days under the roof\r\nof our hut, and despatched many of them, but this made no impression\r\nwhatever upon their vast number. People, also, are bitten on any part\r\nof the body which is left exposed at night, and I have frequently seen\r\nIndians which had been attacked on nose, forehead, and arms.\r\n\r\nAfter completing our work in the Yungas we returned to Cochabamba in\r\norder to await more favorable weather for the trip into the lowlands of\r\neastern Bolivia, and to restock our outfit with articles which had been\r\nused, and others which it seemed necessary to acquire for the difficult\r\nundertaking ahead.\r\n\r\nAfter spending several weeks in the vicinity of Cochabamba, we made\r\narrangements with the mail-carrier which enabled us to travel jointly\r\nto the Chaparé. He usually made the trip at six weeks’ intervals during\r\nthe dry season, and, consequently, he knew the trail better than any\r\none else. His _peons_ were also accustomed to the country and knew how\r\nto adjust packs so they would meet the varying conditions of the road,\r\nwhich is an “art” that can be learned through long experience only.\r\n\r\nOn July 12 we left Cochabamba. Besides my companion and our personal\r\nattendant there were the mail-carrier and his three _peons_; twelve\r\ngood, strong mules carried the luggage, and there were half a dozen\r\nriding and spare animals--quite a cavalcade for the kind of undertaking\r\nin hand.\r\n\r\nThree days after starting we reached our old camping-spot in the\r\nYungas, and, after stopping for a short chat with the old caretaker of\r\nSeñor Quiroga’s hut we proceeded into what was for us _terra incognita_.\r\n\r\nNumerous huts of flimsy construction are scattered along the entire\r\ntwenty miles or more of cultivated slopes; each has a fenced-in area\r\npaved with flat stones upon which coca leaves are dried. We stopped at\r\na number of these dwellings in an attempt to buy fruit or vegetables,\r\nbut unfortunately the men were all away working in the fields, and any\r\none who has attempted to purchase anything from the average Quechua\r\nsquaw knows how hopeless a task it is. Although they may have a\r\nsuperabundance of the article desired, they seem to take great delight\r\nin refusing to sell anything to a stranger; then the only method to\r\nfollow is to take what is needed, offer a fair price for it and pass\r\non, leaving them in the midst of their wild rantings; the men are\r\neasier to deal with.\r\n\r\nThe _peons_, and the _patrón_ as well, stopped at each hut where the\r\nwhite flag announced that _chicha_ was for sale, and attempted to drink\r\nenough to last them until their return; after their money gave out they\r\nleft articles of clothing in payment for the drinks. It was therefore\r\na great relief when the last abode of the intoxicating beverage had\r\nbeen left behind, and we plunged into the wilderness. Immediately\r\nafter leaving the Yungas we ascended a precipitous slope, the top of\r\nwhich was seven hundred feet above the surrounding country, and then\r\ndescended on the other side until the elevation was only two thousand\r\nfeet; here the forest was more tropical in character, and some of the\r\ntrees, especially the cottonwoods, reached a height of one hundred and\r\nfifty feet, and measured twenty-five feet through the buttressed roots\r\nat the base.\r\n\r\nThe day after leaving the Yungas we reached the most dangerous part of\r\nthe whole trail. After crossing a number of steep, high ridges, we came\r\nto an abrupt slope, the side of which is seared by a huge gash where\r\nthe treacherous white clay keeps sliding constantly into the river,\r\nmany hundreds of feet below. Each caravan desiring to pass must first\r\ncut a ledge in the moving mass of soft, muddy earth, and then hurriedly\r\nlead the mules across, one at a time, before the newly made trail is\r\nobliterated. The spot is very appropriately named _Sal-si-Puedes_ (pass\r\nif you can), for any one succeeding in crossing this slide is very apt\r\nto possess the ingenuity required to negotiate the remainder of the\r\ntrail.\r\n\r\nThat night we made camp early on the banks of the Rio San Antonio,\r\ncalled _Chuspipascana_ by the Indians, which means Mosquito River. The\r\naltitude of the site is only one thousand eight hundred feet above\r\nsea-level. The river was a clear, rapid stream one hundred feet wide,\r\nflowing through a rock-strewn bed a quarter of a mile across. Swarms\r\nof black flies, sand-flies, and other stinging or biting insects\r\nimmediately came out to greet us. Birds were very abundant. In addition\r\nto the jays, ant-wrens and manakins, which remained in the forest,\r\nflocks of parrots and toucans flew across the open spaces. One of the\r\nmost unusual occurrences was the great flocks of a new species of giant\r\noriole; there were not less than one thousand of these birds in a\r\nsingle flock, and they roamed almost everywhere, coming close to camp\r\nto inspect the tents, and to discuss them in hoarse cries of curiosity\r\nor resentment. They were beautiful creatures, of a deep chestnut color\r\nwith light olive-green head and neck; the face is devoid of plumage and\r\nof a flesh-color, while the tip of the bill is deep orange. The flesh\r\nis highly esteemed by the natives and we found it quite palatable.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the cargoes had been neatly placed in a pile and covered\r\nwith a tarpaulin to keep them dry the _peons_ cooked their supper;\r\nthis consisted of a thick soup made of corn-meal and _charque_ (dried\r\nbeef). They had a meal in the morning and another at night; during the\r\nlong walk throughout the day they chewed coca leaves. The mules were\r\nturned loose to shift for themselves, but as plenty of wild cane grows\r\nnear the rivers, they had an abundance of food. One of the animals\r\ncarried a bell tied to its neck, and the others would seldom stray out\r\nof hearing of the constant clanging. In the morning the men easily\r\nlocated the bell-mule and led it back to camp, the others following in\r\nsingle file. Should one be missing, which was a rare occurrence, it\r\nwas only necessary to take the bell and shake it vigorously; this soon\r\nbrought the stray member to the spot.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the journey was through the heavily forested lowland;\r\nthe last of the mountain ridges had been left behind.\r\n\r\nDuring the dry season the caravans follow the courses of streams as\r\nmuch as possible. The water is low, and the wide, rocky margins serve\r\nas roads. This is far from being easy on the mules; the animals go\r\nstumbling and slipping along, but a good many miles are cut from the\r\ntotal length of the journey. Streams are encountered with frequency,\r\nand as one penetrates farther into the interior they become wider\r\nand deeper. We crossed not less than six fords in a single day, all\r\nbetween two hundred and three hundred feet wide, the water averaging\r\nfrom three to four feet deep. Although the current is strong, the\r\nmules are accustomed to this kind of work and usually manage to cross\r\nsafely, often stopping in the deepest, swiftest spot to unconcernedly\r\ntake a drink. Occasionally, however, one of the animals slips on a\r\nmoss-covered boulder and falls; then it is a difficult matter to\r\nassist the drowning creature to his feet, as the swift water may roll\r\nhim over, and the weight of the pack keeps him down. In any event,\r\nthe least result of such an accident is the thorough saturation of\r\neverything in the pack, and this means a day’s loss of time while\r\nthe soaked effects are spread out to dry. During the rainy season\r\nstreams rise with startling rapidity, and parties have often been\r\nforced to camp on the river-bank many days until the water went down.\r\nTo turn back is hopeless, as the last stream crossed is just as high as\r\nthe one ahead; there is nothing to be done but wait.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The expedition in the Cuchicancha Pass.]\r\n\r\nWild animals are particularly abundant in this section of the country.\r\nAll day long we could hear the raucous scream of long-tailed,\r\nmulticolored macaws (_Ara_) as they flew two by two overhead. Many\r\nhawks sat alertly on dead snags near the water, and black-and-white\r\ngulls flapped hurriedly up and down along the river. Occasionally we\r\ncaught a glimpse of a small flock of muscovies, the largest of South\r\nAmerican ducks, as the great, black birds flew heavily up-stream. There\r\nwere also black guans, resembling small turkeys, which sat quietly in\r\nthe tops of tall trees until we approached quite near to them; then,\r\nemitting a loud, mule-like bray, they set their wings and soared across\r\nthe river or down into the underbrush. At night the forest was usually\r\nquiet, reminding one of “Pools of Silence.” Occasionally, however, the\r\nstill air was suddenly rent by the most unearthly noise that mortal\r\nman ever heard, and the woods rang with the wild, insane cackle of\r\nforest-rails (_Aramides_). Beginning with a shrill _oohoo-hee-cra_,\r\nthe demoniacal chorus continued several minutes without interruption,\r\nswelling constantly and finally ending with a few low, explosive\r\n_cow-cow-cows_. A number of birds always sang together, and the first\r\ntime one hears the performance it is enough to make the flesh creep and\r\nthe hair to stand on end; but even after becoming somewhat accustomed\r\nto the noise, it falls short of conducing to peaceful slumber,\r\nsuggesting as it does the agonized shrieks of some tortured spirit of\r\nthe jungle.\r\n\r\nNight-monkeys (_Douroucouli_) were apparently plentiful, but we never\r\nsaw them in the daytime. After darkness had fallen they began to move\r\nabout in the tree-tops; one night a troop selected the tree under\r\nwhich we camped for the scene of their frolic, and kept us awake the\r\ngreater part of the night. They jumped about in the branches, and\r\nfrom the swishing noises which reached us it was easy to imagine them\r\nenjoying a good swing up and down upon some particularly springy limb.\r\nThey dropped leaves and twigs down upon the tent-fly, probably through\r\naccident, but perhaps prompted by the desire to find out if anything\r\nwould happen. At frequent intervals they drew together in a close group\r\nto chatter in low, grunting tones, and then, coming to the conclusion\r\nthat the queer-looking objects below them must be capable of performing\r\nsome interesting action, again began to tempt fate by showering down\r\nmore twigs and leaves.\r\n\r\nIn many places the receding water of the river had left isolated pools;\r\nthese were teeming with fish of many species; some of them were of\r\nlarge size. A number which we caught had practically the entire tail\r\nand fins eaten off; their cannibalistic brethren had no doubt taken\r\nadvantage of the circumstances in which they were all placed, and begun\r\nto devour them piecemeal, at their leisure.\r\n\r\nThe trees were tall and straight, and there was dense undergrowth near\r\nthe rivers only. Mosses and epiphytes, so typical of the subtropical\r\nzone, were almost lacking, but frequently the wind brought the\r\ndelightful fragrance of ripening vanilla-beans and the perfume of\r\nflowers. Great clusters of scarlet trumpetflowers dangled from the tips\r\nof slender vines, and from the tops of many of the trees drooped long\r\ngarlands of huge white-and-blue flowers that resembled sweet peas; some\r\nof these blooms were two inches in diameter. There were also clumps of\r\nterrestrial orchids on some of the rocks, with slender spikes of deep\r\npurple flowers waving daintily under the impulse of each passing breeze.\r\n\r\nSeven days after leaving Cochabamba we came suddenly upon the little\r\ncluster of grass and bamboo houses known as Todos Santos; there were\r\nexactly seven of them, two of which were of large size, partially\r\nenclosing a wide plot of ground carpeted with soft green grass. Tall\r\nforest hemmed in the settlement on three sides, and the Rio Chaparé,\r\nflowing through deep banks, formed the boundary on the fourth side.\r\n\r\nThe largest building was occupied by the _corregidor_, or federal\r\nagent, who generously provided us with accommodations; in addition to\r\nthe several living-rooms there was an immense wareroom stored with\r\nhides, salt, and other articles of commerce. The remainder of the\r\nhouses were occupied by families of Bolivians who possessed land or\r\nconcessions in the neighborhood, and owned numbers of Indians of the\r\nYuracaré tribe; these latter lived in long sheds built in the rear of\r\nthe dwellings of the people they served. There was also a small church,\r\nbut no shops of any description. In spite of its inconsiderable size,\r\nTodos Santos is a place of importance because it serves as an outlet\r\nfor commerce from Cochabamba and Bolivia in general, and is the port\r\nof entrance for hides from Trinidad, and merchandise entering by way\r\nof the Amazon and Madeira-Mamoré Railroad. A small steamer, the _Ana\r\nCatarina_, was tied up against the bank, waiting for the water to rise\r\nsufficiently for her to proceed down the river; this boat plies more or\r\nless regularly between Todos Santos and Trinidad, and requires three\r\ndays for the downward trip, and five days coming up. From Cochabamba\r\nto Trinidad is a distance of approximately two hundred and sixty-five\r\nmiles, one hundred and sixty-five overland and one hundred on the river.\r\n\r\nDuring the dry season steam-navigation on the Chaparé is very\r\nirregular, but canoes of large size and native paddlers may always be\r\nhad. During the rainy season there is a small steamer or launch each\r\nfortnight.\r\n\r\nSeveral years before, the government had by law abolished the practice\r\nof keeping Indians in the condition of semislavery, and had ordered all\r\nowners to turn them over to the missions; this, however, had not been\r\ndone, and each Bolivian family living at Todos Santos had a number of\r\nYuracarés in its service. Not far from the settlement were a number of\r\nclearings, some of considerable size, where fruits and vegetables were\r\ncultivated for the benefit of the _amos_, as the owners of Indians are\r\ncalled; the Indians cleared the ground, cultivated it, and then brought\r\nin the results of their labor, receiving nothing in return. They seemed\r\nfairly contented, however, and did not appear to be suffering from ill\r\ntreatment. They frequently spent days at a time in their shelters on\r\nthe edges of the fields, or in hunting and fishing trips far from their\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\nEach Yuracaré woman kept a number of Amazon parrots which she looked\r\nafter carefully and refused to sell, even at a good price. Upon asking\r\nthe reason for this I was told that they reared them for the sake of\r\nthe tail-feathers, which are in great demand by the Aymarás. Each\r\nparrot will grow three “crops” of feathers a year, each of which is\r\nworth fifty _centavos_. The Aymarás from the vicinity of La Paz send\r\ndown agents at regular intervals to purchase these feathers, as they\r\nuse them in making ornaments worn during their annual festivals.\r\n\r\nIn the branches of one of the tall trees near the village a neat little\r\nhut had been built of bamboo and leaves, reminding one a great deal of\r\na Philippine tree-dwelling. Indians armed with bows and arrows would\r\nconceal themselves in this house, forty feet above the ground, and\r\nshoot many of the birds which came to feed on the fruit covering the\r\ntree; other Indians, hidden about the base of the tree, watched where\r\nthe birds fell, gathered them up and skinned or plucked them. In this\r\nway quite a number could be shot without alarming a feeding flock.\r\n\r\nThe forest around Todos Santos abounds in wild life. Squirrel-monkeys\r\n(_Saimiri_) are very numerous and travel in troops of from twenty to\r\nfifty individuals; we saw them daily, playing about in the trees, and\r\nfeeding on fruits, buds, and insects. They are delightful little pets,\r\nand one that we owned spent the greater part of the day catching the\r\nmosquitoes which infested our habitation. It searched every nook and\r\ncrevice for insects, and one of its chief pastimes was to look through\r\na pack of cards in the hopes of finding mosquitoes between them. Harpy\r\neagles also are very plentiful, and feed on the squirrel-monkeys to a\r\ngreat extent, as they are easy to catch. However, monkeys are not the\r\nonly animals which suffer; we one day found the remains of a sloth\r\nwhich had been dropped by an eagle, the entire fore part of which had\r\nbeen eaten away.\r\n\r\nThere were numerous trees covered with vivid-scarlet blossoms,\r\nscattered throughout the forest, and forming gaudy little islands of\r\ncolor, which stood out very conspicuously amid the green tree-tops.\r\nThese trees are known as _madres de cacao_, because they are frequently\r\nplanted in cacao-groves to shield the young plants from the sun. The\r\nflowers contain so much nectar that numbers of birds feed upon them,\r\nincluding parrots, macaws, and orioles; when the brilliant blooms fall\r\ninto the river they are greedily snapped up by fish.\r\n\r\nOf small birds there was such a variety that it would be impossible to\r\nmention all of them, but one in particular deserves attention. It is\r\na species of manakin called the “child of the sun” by the Yuracarés,\r\nwho look upon the tiny creature with reverence and would not harm it\r\nunder any circumstances. The bird is not as large as a sparrow, but is\r\nof stocky build, with a bright orange-red head and neck, the remainder\r\nof the body being black. As it whirs from branch to branch it makes a\r\nloud sputtering, crackling noise which reminds one of a bunch of small,\r\nexploding firecrackers. The female of the species is of a dull-green\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\nAt Todos Santos, as elsewhere, local migrations of birds in the heart\r\nof the tropics were several times forcibly brought to our attention. We\r\nhad been hunting in the forest a number of weeks and were pretty well\r\nacquainted with its inhabitants; suddenly a species entirely new to us\r\nappeared in great abundance in all parts of the region; each member of\r\nthe expedition, including the native assistants, brought in specimens\r\nof it the same day. This can be explained only by the fact that flocks\r\nof these particular birds had arrived suddenly from some distant part,\r\nprobably attracted by a fruit or insect which chanced to be plentiful\r\nat the time, and upon which they fed.\r\n\r\nSeveral miles from port, and entirely concealed by the forest,\r\nstretches a lagoon of considerable size; it is connected with the\r\nChaparé by a small, brush-clogged creek, but the water is stagnant\r\nand filled with decaying vegetation and detritus. Masses of bushes\r\nand swamp-grass grow all along the borders, and in some sections the\r\nsurface of the water is covered with floating, aquatic plants. As may\r\nbe supposed, many species of birds live both about the water and in\r\nthe dense thickets that line the banks. Among the former was the rare\r\nlittle sun-grebe, but it was by no means abundant; the few solitary\r\nindividuals we saw were always surprised out in the open water and,\r\nafter giving a series of hoarse, loud cries, either flew or swam as\r\nrapidly as possible to the nearest clump of vegetation, which offered\r\na secure retreat. Graceful jacanas stepped about daintily on the\r\nlily-pads; their toes are very long and give the feet a wide spread,\r\nthus enabling the birds to walk on the floating little islands of\r\nwater-hyacinths and wild lettuce; for this reason the natives call them\r\n_pájaro de Jesu-cristo_, because they can “walk on the water.”\r\n\r\nSeveral species of flycatchers and large, noisy wrens (_Donacobia_)\r\nlived in the partly submerged bushes; we found several of the bulky,\r\ndomed grass nests of the former, but it was almost invariably\r\nimpossible to reach them as they always harbored colonies of biting\r\nants, which rushed out in maddened frenzy when the nest was touched;\r\nhowever, the birds and ants seemed to live in perfect harmony.\r\n\r\nIn the tangles of tall bamboo growing on the bank and drooping out over\r\nthe water lived flocks of hoatzins and numbers of several species of\r\n_dendrocolaptine_ birds or wood-hewers; also an occasional water-turkey\r\nand cormorant. Many black-and-white ibises soared above in circles\r\nand at a great height; they acted not unlike vultures, but the long,\r\noutstretched neck and legs immediately gave a clew to their identity.\r\n\r\nThe forest was full of surprises. One morning my companion encountered\r\na tamanduá ant-eater which was on the ground, and refused to realize\r\nthat the close proximity of man meant danger; he was but lightly armed,\r\nand shot the tough, thick-skinned animal with the 32-bore auxiliary\r\ntube of his shotgun, and number 12 shot--an unheard-of feat.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, not always necessary to go into the forest to hunt;\r\nthe open plot in which the settlement lay attracted many birds, such as\r\nscarlet tanagers, vermilion flycatchers, swallows, and others, which\r\nwere never found in the forest, and small mammals in abundance lived in\r\nthe houses. We frequently caught five species of rats in a single house\r\nin one night, and at least two species of bats lived in the palm-leaf\r\nthatch of the roof. Some of the rodents, particularly a large, spiny\r\nrat, lived under the floor, while others made the walls and ceiling\r\ntheir homes; each species seemed to adhere more or less to its own\r\npart of the dwelling, thus dividing the houses into well-defined\r\n“life-zones.”\r\n\r\nThe natives are very fond of the flesh of the spiny rat and often\r\nbegged for any which chanced to come to our traps.\r\n\r\nOcelots were not wanting in the neighborhood; they visited the\r\nhen-houses occasionally at night, but never entered by the doors,\r\npreferring to tear holes in the side of the structures; they killed a\r\nlarge number of fowls, on one occasion nearly twenty on a single visit,\r\nand prompted apparently by the mere lust for killing.\r\n\r\nAt night vampire-bats came out in hordes; they attacked everything\r\nfrom human beings on down; even the few miserable pigs kept by the\r\nIndians were severely bitten and kept up a continuous squealing as\r\nthe bloodthirsty creatures settled on them, usually at the base of\r\nthe ears, and began their painful operations. The worst sufferers\r\nby far, however, were our mules. As soon as the sun set our _peons_\r\nbrought the animals to the corral and strapped canvas covers over\r\nthem; this precaution was of little avail, for the bats attacked all\r\nexposed parts, causing the mules to kick and roll, with the result that\r\ntheir covers were soon torn off. We went out frequently to watch these\r\nobnoxious creatures at work; after circling above their prospective\r\nvictim a few times, they dropped suddenly, usually upon the neck or\r\nflanks, and at once began to bite and suck, making a grating sound\r\nwith the teeth all the while. They paid no attention to us, although\r\nwe stood but a few feet away, but clung with folded wings to their\r\nprey, perfectly motionless and in an upright position; if we moved they\r\nuttered a few squeaks, but made no attempt to fly until we reached for\r\nthem and came to within a few inches, when they reluctantly fluttered\r\nup, but almost immediately settled on the other side of the animal.\r\nDesiring specimens of them for our collection, we went one night to the\r\ncorral armed with a butterfly-net and, approaching one of the mules\r\non whose back were a dozen or more bats, made a hurried sweep with\r\nthe net; as the large, white bag of netting scraped the back of the\r\nnervous animal he sank to his knees with a groan of despair, wondering,\r\nno doubt, what new monster had swooped down upon him to add fresh\r\nsuffering to his already unbearable existence.\r\n\r\nIn the morning the mules were in a pathetic condition; blood continued\r\nto flow from the wounds made by the bats’ sharp teeth, so that the\r\nground was red and the animals were covered from head to foot. It\r\nwas always necessary to take them to the river and wash them, then\r\ndisinfect the numerous punctures; if this is not done flies attack the\r\nsore spots, infesting them with their larvæ, and the animals die of\r\nblood-poison. After three nights we were compelled to start the mules\r\nback to Cochabamba, as they were on the verge of exhaustion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vampire-bat from Todos Santos.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tamanduá ant-eater.]\r\n\r\nWhile at Todos Santos we learned of a mission among the Yuracaré\r\nIndians about twelve miles distant, and near the Rio Chimoré. We\r\nexpressed a desire to visit it, but the _intendente_ told us that\r\nsuch a move was impossible. He said that the priest in charge of the\r\nmission was absolute monarch of the territory under his control; that\r\nhe would permit no one to come near his retreat, and that this mandate\r\nhad never been disobeyed. Such statements made the place seem of\r\nespecial interest to us, and we were eager to go there at almost any\r\ncost; we devised many plans which we hoped would lead to an interview\r\nwith the priest, but all of them failed miserably; finally, however,\r\nthe opportunity came to us in an unlooked-for manner. A misfortune to\r\none person frequently comes in the guise of a blessing to another,\r\nand so it happened in this instance. As we were pursuing our work one\r\nafternoon in the open corridor in front of our room, a long canoe drew\r\nup at the river-bank, and the priest, followed by a dozen Indians,\r\nstepped ashore and marched across the clearing to the _intendente’s_\r\nquarters. We immediately recognized him as Padre Fulgencio, the\r\nmissionary of whose despotic rule we had heard so much; but he did not\r\neven glance at us as he passed. While debating upon some diplomatic\r\nmove which might serve as an excuse for an interview, for now or never\r\nwas the time to obtain the coveted permission, he suddenly emerged from\r\nthe house and came straight to us. A few curt remarks were exchanged,\r\nand then he began to relate his trouble. To make a long story short,\r\nhe was suffering from a severe toothache; it had kept him awake many\r\nnights, and at last he was forced to come out of his retreat in search\r\nof a remedy. The _intendente_ could do nothing for him; could we?\r\n\r\nHow I thanked my lucky star for a limited knowledge of medicine!\r\nAfter an examination, conducted with much formality, the trouble was\r\npronounced curable. He submitted bravely to the injection of cocaine,\r\nand soon after was relieved of the aching member. Tears rolled down his\r\ncheeks as he expressed his gratitude, and then, taking note of the work\r\nupon which we were engaged, he suddenly asked: “Why don’t you come to\r\nthe mission; I have four hundred Indians who spend several days each\r\nweek in hunting, and they can take you anywhere, and also bring you all\r\nkinds of animals.”\r\n\r\nWe needed no urging, and within five minutes the day was set when\r\nporters in abundance should come to convey our equipment, and we should\r\nstart on our journey to the mysterious stronghold of Padre Fulgencio,\r\nand the boundless jungles bordering the Rio Chimoré.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nAMONG THE YURACARÉ INDIANS OF THE RIO CHIMORÉ\r\n\r\n\r\nTrue to his promise, Padre Fulgencio sent the Indians to Todos Santos,\r\nand on the morning of August 2 we packed into canoes such of our\r\nequipment as was necessary for the trip and started across the brown\r\nwater of the Chaparé.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the river there was no clearing; the trees grew\r\ndown to the water’s edge, and the moment the canoes were left behind we\r\nplunged into the perpetual gloom of the forest.\r\n\r\nAn indistinct trail led into the heart of the jungle. The Indians\r\nadjusted our belongings on their backs, securing them with broad strips\r\nof bark placed across the forehead; then they set out at a good pace,\r\na number of women and children carrying boiled yuccas and plantains,\r\ntrudging at the rear of the procession.\r\n\r\nThere was not much undergrowth, but the ground, from which there is\r\nlittle evaporation on account of the dense canopy overhead, was very\r\nmuddy. Every few rods we came to a deep streamlet which had to be\r\ncrossed on the trunks of fallen trees; some of these slimy bridges were\r\nsixty feet long and almost impassable to us, but the Indians strode\r\nacross as unconcernedly as geckos. Half-way to the mission the Indians\r\nstopped for lunch and a short rest, and by noon we reached the edge of\r\nthe clearing, having covered a distance of twelve miles.\r\n\r\nAfter a tramp of half a mile through weedy fields of maize and yuccas,\r\nwe reached the mission-buildings--a few dozen low grass huts clustering\r\naround an open square. At one end rose two structures of large size\r\nwhich served as the church and general meeting-place. Near the centre\r\nof the clearing a stately cross had been erected, hewn from the heart\r\nof a giant ceiba.\r\n\r\nThe priest was delighted to see us and spared no effort to make us\r\ncomfortable. We were soon installed in a room of one of the buildings\r\nwhich served as a boys’ dormitory, and a short time later started out\r\nto inspect our surroundings.\r\n\r\nAt first the Indians were reticent and would peer at us from a\r\ndistance. This was true particularly of the children, but as the days\r\nwore on we made friends with them, and from both the people themselves\r\nand the priest we learned a great deal about their history and habits.\r\n\r\nThe name Yuracaré, according to D’Orbigny, was given to them by the\r\nQuechuas, and means “white man”; this is most inappropriate, as they\r\nare of a decided brown color, although perhaps averaging lighter than\r\nthe Quechuas. They were first discovered by Viedma in 1768.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, at least, the Yuracarés are a people of the hot,\r\nhumid lowlands. Those who have not been captured and brought to the\r\nmissions, or who escaped the unenviable fate of having been taken\r\nfrom their forest home by private “slaving expeditions,” live along\r\nthe smaller branches of the streams, which eventually find their way\r\ninto the Mamoré; this includes particularly the Chaparé, Chimoré, the\r\nIchilo, and the Isiboro.\r\n\r\nThere were about four hundred Indians residing at the mission. Although\r\nattempts have been made intermittently to civilize these people for\r\nmore than a hundred years, there were long intervals when the work had\r\nto be abandoned, and the families naturally returned to their homes in\r\nthe wilderness. Nearly all of the present aggregation had been brought\r\ntogether during the last few years. Newcomers are added to their number\r\nfrequently. The priest, learning of other families far up some unmapped\r\n_quebrada_ or streamlet, takes a few of the men who have learned to\r\nplace confidence in him and whom he trusts, and starts forth on long\r\ncanoe voyages in search of them. They approach the hidden dwelling\r\nsuddenly, surround it, and persuade the occupants to accompany them\r\nimmediately, giving them only an hour or two in which to collect\r\ntheir few belongings. Occasionally the Indians whom they seek learn\r\nof the approach of the emissaries and hide before their arrival; then\r\nthe priest returns to the mission, his long trip having been made to\r\nno purpose. When, should the expedition prove to be successful, the\r\nfamilies have departed to the waiting canoes, their huts are burned and\r\nthe plantations destroyed. Knowing that neither home nor food have been\r\nleft behind, they are not so apt to run away from their new quarters\r\nand go back to their old dwelling-places. I heard of no instance where\r\nthey resisted this deportation.\r\n\r\nThe Yuracarés are a tall, well-built people of a rather docile\r\ndisposition; however, the older generation never wholly becomes\r\nreconciled to the new mode of life, and remains at the mission only for\r\nreasons which I will explain later.\r\n\r\nIn their wild state they live in small family parties, obtaining their\r\nsubsistence from the forest, which abounds in game, and from their\r\nfields of yuccas. Their native costume, a long, shirt-like garment\r\ncalled _tipoy_, is made from the fibrous bark of a tree; at the mission\r\nthis has largely been replaced by cotton clothes. Each family has been\r\nprovided with a separate hut of adequate size, where the parents and\r\nvery small children live. The boys and girls over five or six years\r\nof age are under the constant supervision of the priest, and attend\r\nhis classes; at night they sleep in separate locked dormitories, which\r\nprevents their returning to their homes, and also keeps the parents\r\nfrom running away, as they will not leave without their children.\r\n\r\nPadre Fulgencio also explained that this kept them from observing and\r\ncopying the customs of their elders. He recognizes the impossibility of\r\nreclaiming the forest-reared savage, and devotes practically all his\r\nefforts to the younger generation.\r\n\r\nThe Indians marry at an early age, the boys at sixteen and the girls at\r\nfourteen. In their wild state each family rears four or five children;\r\nat the mission never more than two, and frequently none at all. Should\r\nthe first-born be a girl, she is permitted slowly to starve to death.\r\nThe priest has inflicted severe punishment upon them in his efforts to\r\nbreak this custom, but so far all his work has been in vain.\r\n\r\nAs far as possible they are discouraged in the celebration of their\r\nnative festivals, but it frequently occurs that the entire populace\r\nappear with faces gayly decorated with black and blue dots, and all\r\njoin in weird songs and dances, the purpose of which remains a secret,\r\nas they cannot be induced to tell. They worship no divinity, being in\r\nthis respect in a class almost by themselves.\r\n\r\nFood at the mission is abundant. The clearing comprises several hundred\r\nacres and is planted in maize, rice, yuccas, plantains, and sweet\r\npotatoes. Like most savages, they have an intoxicating drink, made of\r\nthe boiled root of the yucca. The women dig great quantities of it,\r\npeel and thoroughly cook it, after which a certain per cent is chewed\r\nand expectorated into a huge earthenware jar; the remainder is mashed\r\nand thrown in also, and water added. The following day fermentation has\r\nstarted and the greenish yellow liquid is ready for use.\r\n\r\nAt the mission the Indians have learned the use of salt, and this fact\r\nperhaps as much as any induces them to remain, for deprived of it they\r\ncannot long exist. A small amount is given to each individual at stated\r\nperiods--only just enough to supply his wants until time for the next\r\ndistribution. There are instances on record where families have escaped\r\nand gone back to their nomadic life for eighteen months, then returned\r\nvoluntarily to promise future obedience, so great was their craving for\r\nsalt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yuracarés chewing yucca-roots for making casire.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yuracaré women and children.]\r\n\r\nThe rites attending the death and burial of a man are among the curious\r\nand persisting ceremonies of the Yuracarés. When the husband dies the\r\nwife removes all her wearing apparel and casts herself upon his\r\nbody, where she remains weeping and lamenting until the time of the\r\nfuneral, which is a day or two later. All the women squat in a circle\r\naround the deceased, raise their voices in sorrowful wails, and recount\r\nthe heroic deeds and good characteristics of the dead. The men drink\r\n_casire_ and dig a deep hole in the ground; when the time for the\r\nburial arrives the body is carefully deposited therein, together with\r\nall his possessions, and the wife’s clothing is placed on top, after\r\nwhich the earth is thrown in.\r\n\r\nThe weapons of this tribe consist entirely of bows made of\r\n_chonta_-palm wood, five or six feet high, and various kinds of arrows.\r\nThe shaft of the latter is always composed of slender bamboo, but the\r\npoints vary greatly; thus for large game there is a long double-edged\r\nblade of another variety of bamboo; slender, barbed points of _chonta_\r\nare used for birds, and a long, sharp spike of palm-wood for fish. They\r\nare wholly ignorant of the use of the deadly _curare_ poison.\r\n\r\nWe were fortunate in timing our visit to the Chimoré for the dry\r\nseason. Additions were being made to the already large areas under\r\ncultivation, and for this purpose the Indians were cutting down\r\nforest. They were required to work four days each week, the remaining\r\nthree being devoted to fishing and hunting. All the men and boys\r\nparticipated in this work and seemed to enjoy it thoroughly. At first\r\nthe undergrowth was removed; this naturally led to the discovery of\r\nmany strange animals, all of which were promptly brought to us for\r\nexamination. The number and variety of snakes was astonishing; even\r\nafter having spent years in a similar type of country, I had never\r\nsuspected that so many existed, which shows how inconspicuous they are\r\nuntil one actually goes over the ground with a comb, as it were. They\r\ncaptured green boas, several species of the fer-de-lance, and many\r\nothers which we did not recognize. Some of them were poisonous, and\r\nothers were innocuous. Among the former was one which in appearance\r\nclosely resembled the green boa, but its attitude was defiant and even\r\naggressive; examination showed that it possessed long fangs. One day\r\nseveral of the men came running into our room and shouted “_Pisisi_.”\r\nWe followed them to the clearing, and found that they had discovered\r\na huge bushmaster coiled under a log. They tried to drive the reptile\r\nout with long poles, but it refused to move; finally the priest pulled\r\nthe enormous creature bodily from its hiding-place with the aid of a\r\nhooked stick; it was very sluggish and made no attempt to strike. After\r\nshooting it we found that it measured nearly seven feet in length, with\r\na diameter of five inches. The fangs, over an inch long, emitted about\r\na tablespoonful of yellowish poison.\r\n\r\nThe bushmaster, called _surucucú_ in Brazil, is truly a terrible\r\ncreature. It grows to a length of ten feet or more, and attains a\r\ngreat thickness. A snake of that size has fangs an inch and a half\r\nlong and injects nearly a tablespoonful of poison at a single thrust.\r\nThe ground-color is reddish yellow crossed by black bands, sometimes\r\nforming a series of X’s along the back. It does not take kindly to\r\ncaptivity and dies of starvation after a few months of confinement. It\r\nis one of the few snakes which are supposed to incubate their eggs.\r\nAfter selecting a hole in the ground or in a stump the reptile lays a\r\ndozen or more eggs; then it coils up on top of them and does not leave\r\nthe vicinity until they hatch; at such times it is very irritable, and\r\nwill strike with deadly results any creature which disturbs it. The\r\npoison acts rapidly, and I heard of a case where an Indian died in less\r\nthan half an hour after having been bitten.\r\n\r\nThere were also small brown salamanders and lizards with spiny backs\r\nthat resembled horned toads. Perhaps the rarest catch of all was a\r\nsplendid example of the curious cane-rat (_Dactylomys_), an animal\r\nseldom encountered on account of its rarity and secretive habits.\r\nIt resembles a large rat, being twenty-five inches long, and of a\r\ndark-gray color; the toes are divided into pairs in order to enable it\r\nto easily climb slender stalks, and instead of claws it has nails.\r\nThe pupils of the eyes are elliptical, like a cat’s; when annoyed it\r\nuttered a hoarse scream, a sound occasionally heard at night, but which\r\nwe did not heretofore recognize.\r\n\r\nAfter the brush had been removed for the distance of a hundred yards\r\nor more from the edge of the clearing, the Indians began to cut down\r\nthe trees; some of these were of enormous size, especially the ceibas;\r\none that I measured was twenty-five feet through the base, counting\r\nthe supporting, bracket-like roots, and fifteen men hacked at it at\r\nthe same time. When the tree fell they set up a wild cheering and took\r\ngreat delight in watching this monarch of the forest tumble to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThree days of each week were devoted to hunting and fishing. Usually\r\nthe Indians went many miles away, in small parties, returning promptly\r\nat the expiration of their time. The children rarely accompanied them,\r\nand then only after having obtained special permission from the priest.\r\nUpon their return they brought baskets of fish and meat--enough to\r\nlast them until their next journey into the wilds. Nearly all fish\r\nand game were taken with bow and arrow. To secure the former they\r\nselected a small creek up the shallow water of which huge shoals of\r\nfish went to feed, and then shot them. After a sufficient supply had\r\nbeen obtained they erected a framework of sticks, built a fire under it\r\nand slowly roasted and smoked them; later they were packed in baskets\r\nbetween layers of green leaves and taken home. They also brought\r\nnumbers of freshly killed animals for our examination, for in keeping\r\nwith his promise Padre Fulgencio had announced from the pulpit that\r\nall creatures taken by them were to be shown to us first, and we were\r\npermitted to select any that were of scientific value. In this manner a\r\nnumber of animals new to us were added to the collection.\r\n\r\nThe curl-breasted toucan (_Beauharnaisia_) is one of those birds\r\nof the Amazonian basin which is seldom seen by travellers, or even\r\nnaturalists, who make every effort to learn something of its\r\nhabits. Bates records having seen a number during his eleven years\r\nof exploration, and on one occasion he was attacked by a flock after\r\nhe had wounded one of them. We therefore considered it an unusually\r\ngood streak of fortune to find a large flock inhabiting a section of\r\nthe forest several miles from the mission. They were wary, nervous\r\ncreatures, and spent their time in the top of tall trees from which\r\none of our men succeeded in shooting several with arrows before\r\nthe remainder took alarm and flew away; they never returned to the\r\nlocality. The bird is black above, with yellow underparts barred with\r\nblack; the feathers on the top of the head are flattened and curled,\r\nresembling shining scales, and are drawn together to form a ridge.\r\nOn the throat and breast the brilliant yellow feathers are tipped\r\nwith glossy black dots, resembling beads of jet. Unfortunately they\r\nwere not nesting, but the Indians reported having found the two white\r\neggs in cavities in the taller trees. Another bird not frequently\r\nencountered is the giant frogmouth (_Nyctibius_), which, while not\r\nso rare, perhaps, is seldom seen, as it is nocturnal in habits and\r\nspends the days squatting horizontally upon some thick branch, where\r\nit resembles a gray lichen, or is altogether invisible. When the time\r\nfor domestic cares arrives the bird lays a single white egg on the\r\nbranch which has served as its perch, or at the junction of a limb and\r\nthe tree-trunk, without making any sort of a nest. Doubtless many eggs\r\nroll off this precarious location and are broken. It feeds upon beetles\r\nand insects which are caught on the wing, and some observers say that\r\nit also catches small birds; this latter I am inclined to question.\r\nOne individual that we collected was twenty-two inches long, with an\r\nexpanse of wings of thirty inches. The mouth when opened measured five\r\ninches from tip to tip of the bill, and was three inches wide; but the\r\nœsophagus was less than half an inch in diameter, which would prevent\r\nit from swallowing anything larger than a humming-bird.\r\n\r\nThe nights at the mission were always pleasant. The priest usually\r\nconducted a short service in the chapel, and then we sat in front of\r\nhis hut for an hour’s chat, while the children romped and played before\r\nbeing sent to bed. Sometimes one of the boys brought out a queer drum;\r\nthe ends were made of skin taken from the neck of a jabiru stork. He\r\nbeat it in slow rhythm, swaying his head from side to side with each\r\nlow thud. The girls placed their arms around one another’s waists,\r\nforming lines of threes, and shuffled forward three steps and back,\r\nswinging their bodies all the while; suddenly they would whirl around\r\nonce, take hold of one another’s hands, and then the long line swept\r\naround at such a rapid pace that the individuals at the ends invariably\r\nwent sprawling some distance away. After tiring of this or any other\r\npastime upon which they were engaged, they lined up and said a “_Buenas\r\nnoches, Padre_,” in chorus. Then they ran away to the sleeping quarters.\r\n\r\nAfter spending nearly two weeks at the mission we accepted the priest’s\r\ninvitation to accompany him on a short trip down the Chimoré. Twenty\r\nyoung men and boys were selected as paddlers; they started early one\r\nmorning, taking all of our personal luggage with them; a large number\r\nof girls and women followed soon after, carrying baskets of plantains,\r\nyuccas, and other provisions. The missionary, Boyle, and I brought up\r\nthe rear, and encouraged the few stragglers we met on the way, for the\r\ndistance from the mission to the river is three miles, through the\r\nvirgin forest.\r\n\r\nThe Chimoré is of about the same width as the Chaparé, although the\r\nwater is in normal times somewhat clearer. It rises far to the south\r\nand is formed by the junction of the Blanco and Icona. Some distance\r\nbelow it unites with the waters of the Ichilo, a mighty river flowing\r\nfrom the south, through a solitary and unknown wilderness, and up which\r\nPadre Fulgencio had ascended a number of miles on a previous trip. In\r\nlatitude 15° 30´ South, the Ichilo and Chaparé join, and form the Rio\r\nMamorecillo, which lower in its course is known as the Mamoré.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of Mamoré, which is a Yuracaré word, is “mother of the\r\nhuman race.” They have a legend to the effect that far away, at\r\nthe source of the Sajta, which is the beginning of the furthermost\r\ntributary of the mighty river, there are three rocks of pyramidal\r\nshape that rise in terraces, one above the other, and in the heart of\r\nwhich the stream rises. In the very beginning of things this rock gave\r\nbirth to the first people, for which reason it is called “Mamoré.”\r\nLater the name was also given to the river because its water, teeming\r\nwith fish, supplied them with food and offered an easy highway for the\r\ndissemination of the race.\r\n\r\nArrived at the point of embarkation, the men began to load the five\r\ncanoes which were waiting, and the women built a fire and cooked\r\nlunch. In a short time everything was ready and the canoes moved\r\neasily down-stream. The paddlers were adepts at their work, and as a\r\ngood deal of rivalry existed between the different crews, they kept\r\nup an almost continuous race, with the natural consequence that we\r\nmade good time. The scenery along the Chimoré is exactly like that on\r\nthe upper courses of the many rivers of tropical South America; there\r\nis the same monotony of the yellow water highway, flanked by walls\r\nof deepest green. One thing that impresses the traveller as much as\r\nany other is the immensity of the silent, uninhabited areas; and also\r\ntheir comparative worthlessness. For days and even weeks one may enter\r\ndeeper and deeper into the heart of the undefiled wilderness, and see\r\nalways the same dark forest, the hurrying, mysterious streams, and\r\nthe rafts of low, threatening clouds; hear the annoying buzz and feel\r\nthe poisonous sting of the insect swarms, and swelter in the humid,\r\nenervating climate. The greater part of this country can never be\r\ncultivated to any extent, as the annual floods cover it to a depth of\r\nmany feet; there are very few eminences safe from the inundations,\r\nand these are of inconsiderable size. The person who pictures the\r\nuntrodden tropics as a paradise of fruits and flowers, teeming with\r\ngorgeous-colored creatures and inhabited by tribes of gracious Indians\r\nwhose one desire in life is to serve the traveller or explorer, has yet\r\nto cut his eye-teeth in the field of exploration.\r\n\r\nOur Indians were all well armed and frequently took long shots at\r\nsome of the creatures that ventured to show themselves in the early\r\nmornings or just before dark. They were expert archers and even shot\r\nlarge birds on the wing as the flocks passed overhead. Occasionally\r\nan otter appeared, always a hundred yards or more away, swimming\r\nrapidly with only the head showing above the water. These animals were\r\nfavorite targets, and from my seat in the middle of the canoe I had an\r\nunobstructed view of the arrows in flight as they left the bow of the\r\nman in front; he did not aim at his prey, but quite some distance above\r\nit. At the twang of the bow the arrow sped into the air, ascending\r\nslightly at first, and then dropping as it approached the mark; it\r\ndescribed a curve exactly like a bullet fired from a rifle, and\r\nremained in a perfectly horizontal position during the entire flight.\r\n\r\nWhen making camp on a sand-bank the Indians stuck their bows and arrows\r\nin the ground, near the shelters; this prevented their being stepped\r\non and broken. In damp or rainy weather the arrows warped badly, but\r\nit was only a few minutes’ work to heat them near a fire and bend them\r\nback into alignment.\r\n\r\nTropical rivers are noted for their treachery. One can never be\r\ncertain of their actions or character, even a few hours hence. We\r\nhad a striking example of this on the Chimoré. Camp had been made on\r\nan extensive sand-bank one day at noon, as we planned to spend a few\r\nhours hunting and fishing in the neighborhood. The sun shone brightly\r\nand there was nothing to indicate a change of conditions in any manner\r\nwhatever; but scarcely had the canoes been unloaded and a fire built\r\nover which we intended to do the cooking when we were startled by a\r\ndull roar that grew louder with each passing second; before we had\r\ntime to hurriedly gather our belongings and throw them into the canoes\r\na foam-capped, seething wall of water was upon us, sweeping down the\r\nriver and carrying away everything in its path. As the tidal wave,\r\nseveral feet high, dashed over the sand-bank, the imprisoned air shot\r\nup from the great cracks and rents in the sun-baked earth, and set the\r\nraging mass of muddy water to hissing and boiling. In a few minutes\r\nonly the higher mounds of sand projected above the roaring inferno,\r\nand against these hungry tongues of water lapped greedily until their\r\nbases were undermined. Then the whole mass crumbled and disappeared\r\nin the seething flood. Where our peaceful camp had stood but a few\r\nminutes before there was now a sea of agitated water. The explanation\r\nof this phenomenon is simple: A heavy rain had fallen in the mountains\r\nwhere the tributaries of the river rise, and the torrent of water\r\ndashing down the precipitous slopes had rushed into the lowlands. After\r\nthis the water was so muddy that it was unfit for use without special\r\npreparation. In order to secure a supply for drinking and cooking we\r\nboiled a quantity of it; the sand was quickly precipitated to the\r\nbottom as the temperature rose, after which the clear water could\r\nbe poured off the top. In some instances the amount of solid matter\r\ncarried by the water was fully 50 per cent of the total volume.\r\n\r\nAnimals were not abundant on the river-banks, although we saw a deer\r\nor a small flock of curassows at infrequent intervals. If we went\r\ninto the forest a short distance, however, we were sure to find game\r\nin abundance. On one occasion the Indians demonstrated their skill at\r\ncalling up monkeys. A large troop of cebus and squirrel-monkeys were\r\nfeeding in the tree-tops, but for some reason the men did not give\r\nchase as they usually do; they concealed themselves in the thick lower\r\ngrowth and whistled a few plaintive _kee-oows_. In a short time the\r\nanimals began to evince a great deal of interest or curiosity, and\r\nmany of them descended to the lower branches. Then the hunters shot a\r\nnumber with their arrows before the band realized what had occurred and\r\ntook flight.\r\n\r\nLarge areas covered with an impenetrable cane-jungle are scattered all\r\nalong the borders of the Chimoré. The tall stalks rise to a height of\r\nfifty feet or more, and are beautiful to look at, but impossible to\r\npenetrate until a trail has been cleared with hatchet or machete. The\r\nplant resembles the well-known sugar-cane of our Southern States, but\r\ngrows much taller, and the stems are thin and hard. A large, white,\r\nfeathery plume crowns each stalk. This plant is of inestimable value to\r\nthe natives. The long poles are used almost exclusively in constructing\r\ntheir dwellings, and the leaves make an impervious thatch. Practically\r\nevery stalk is infested with thick white grubs which live in the pith.\r\nThese are extracted by the Yuracarés, who call them _chata_, and used\r\nfor bait when fishing. Many runways perforate the matted growth; these\r\nhave been made by capybaras, agoutis, and numerous other animals. Even\r\ntapirs seem to appreciate the protection afforded by the thick cover\r\nand resort to it in the daytime, while jaguars noiselessly steal along\r\nthe paths in the course of their nightly prowls. One night we had an\r\nexcellent illustration of how useful the cane-plant, or _chuchilla_,\r\nas the Indians call it, can be in an emergency. We had landed on a\r\nsand-bank rather early in the evening, spurred to this action by\r\nrapidly approaching black clouds, flashes of lightning, and the\r\nrumbling of distant thunder which bespoke the arrival of a tropical\r\nrain-storm. At first it looked as if we should be compelled to endure\r\na thorough drenching, but Padre Fulgencio issued a few orders to the\r\ncanoemen, and they hurried away to neighboring cane-brakes, with\r\nmachete in hand; soon they returned, dragging an immense quantity of\r\nthe plant; four of the strongest poles were firmly planted in the sand\r\nto form a square, about fifteen feet apart, and the tops bent over and\r\ntied together with strips of their leaves. These served as the corner\r\nposts of a shelter. Other stalks were laid across the top to form\r\nrafters, and firmly tied. The men then piled many more on top, binding\r\neach one to the rafter, until a complete hut had been built; although\r\nthe height of the roof was fully eight feet, the ragged edges came down\r\nto the ground, entirely enclosing the sides and forming a snug retreat\r\nagainst which the elements raged without avail. After the first deluge\r\nhad subsided other and smaller shelters were built. The Indians enjoyed\r\nthe experience thoroughly; they threw aside all clothing, built fires\r\nover which fish and game were placed to roast, and squatted around the\r\nembers in a circle, doubtless indulging in pleasant reminiscences of\r\nthe days before civilization with its restricting influences, and had\r\ncome into their care-free existence.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning we were awakened by the reverberating howls of\r\nmonkeys. The Indians rushed in a body from their shelters and,\r\nsnatching up bows and arrows, ran in pursuit. A troop of red howlers\r\nhad come to the _chuchilla_ near our shelters; we could see none\r\nof the animals, but the tops of the canes waving as if agitated by\r\na violent gust of wind told us of their whereabouts. Soon we heard\r\nshouts followed by the twang of bows and the snarl of arrows as they\r\nripped through the flesh of the luckless victims. This continued until\r\nthe creatures disappeared in the interior of the dense jungle, and\r\nthen the hunters returned, dragging their quarry after them. We were\r\neager to continue on our way, but in view of the efficient and willing\r\nservice rendered by the men the night before it was decided to wait a\r\nfew hours and permit them to have a feast. A huge fire was built, and\r\nthe monkeys, after having been skinned and washed, were set on spits\r\nto roast. The Indians crowded around, sang and shouted, and tore off\r\nand ate chunks of the half-roasted flesh. In a short time our orderly\r\nYuracarés had returned to the realms of savagery, and were indulging in\r\na performance such as I had repeatedly seen among the wild Nhambiquaras\r\nof Matto Grosso.\r\n\r\nLower down we saw numerous islands, some of large size and of a\r\npeculiar formation. The river, which had risen so rapidly a few days\r\nbefore, had gone down to its normal level and left these obstructions\r\nin the channel exposed high above the surface. A matted mass of logs\r\nand branches of which a layer fifteen feet thick protruded above the\r\nwater, formed the base of the islands; on this soil had gathered to\r\na depth of five or six feet, and supported a luxuriant growth of\r\nvegetation. These islands are composed of deposits of driftwood which\r\nwere left stranded on sand-banks during the season of high water,\r\nand while the edges are torn and jagged the force of succeeding\r\nfloods seems to be of insufficient strength to wash them away. As we\r\npaddled along quietly near the banks the priest or the Indians pointed\r\nout many interesting and curious plants. One of these is the _palo\r\nsanto_, or holy tree; it grows to be a great height, but the trunk is\r\ncomparatively slender. The peculiar name is derived from the fact that\r\nit is as carefully guarded as any sacred object should be, but in this\r\ninstance by myriads of fire-ants, which live in the hollow interior of\r\nthe trunk. If the tree is struck sharply with a stick the ants pour out\r\nin endless files through minute openings. They are vicious insects,\r\nand the bite smarts and burns many hours after it is inflicted. The\r\n_tacuara_, a species of tall, feathery bamboo, is another interesting\r\nplant of this region. When the stalk is cut down the leaves shrivel\r\nand dry within a few minutes. Large numbers of cabbage-palms grew\r\nthroughout the forest. The beautiful, plume-shaped leaves droop in a\r\ngreat umbrella-like mass from the top of a column sixty or seventy feet\r\nhigh; thick clumps of straight, tough roots branch out eight or ten\r\nfeet above the ground and form a solid support to the stem. A delicious\r\nsalad is made from the tender leaves, folded up in the bud; or if\r\nboiled the flavor is similar to that of asparagus. To secure the bud it\r\nis, of course, necessary to cut down a tree which has taken the greater\r\npart of a century to mature, but in a region where many millions are\r\ngrowing one is not inclined to be sentimental, and will only bemoan\r\nthe fact that it requires an hour’s hard work to chop through the\r\nsteel-like trunk before the coveted morsel is brought down.\r\n\r\nThe country between the Guapay and Ichilo is probably as little\r\nknown as any part of South America. This strip of land, covering\r\napproximately five thousand square miles, is heavily forested, and is\r\nthe home of a tribe of savages known as the Sirionós. Judging from the\r\naccounts given to us by our canoemen and the priest, they must be a\r\nterrible and indomitable race. The Yuracarés fear them greatly, and as\r\nwe neared the Ichilo they preferred to keep the canoes in the centre of\r\nthe river and seemed reluctant to land; if they shot at an animal and\r\nthe arrow missed its mark and dropped in the forest they did not go in\r\nsearch of it; a half-day of careful work is needed to make an arrow,\r\nand as a general rule Indians are very particular to hunt for any they\r\nmay lose; but in this instance they preferred the loss of the arrows to\r\nrisking their skins in the dense cover.\r\n\r\nThere were four Yuracarés at the mission, one, a girl of twelve years,\r\nwho bore unsightly scars--the result of having been ambushed by parties\r\nof the Sirionós tribe; I was also told that occasionally some of them\r\nare killed.\r\n\r\nThe Sirionós seem to have no permanent homes and cultivate the ground\r\nto a very limited extent, if at all. They are a tribe of wanderers, and\r\nroam the forest in small parties, killing game for food. In appearance\r\nand stature they are not unlike the Guarayos, but in temperament they\r\nare totally different and have successfully resisted every attempt made\r\nto subdue them. Their weapons are bows and arrows, the former of great\r\nheight and so powerful that they cannot be drawn with the arms alone.\r\nIn order to shoot the Indian throws himself on his back, grasps the\r\nbow with the feet and draws the cord with both hands; the arrows, of\r\nwhich the priest had collected a number, are seven or eight feet long\r\nand made of wild cane or _chuchilla_. Apparently they are unacquainted\r\nwith the use of poison.\r\n\r\nProbably the Guarayos suffer more at the hands of the Sirionós than\r\nthe Yuracarés, because the former two tribes come in contact more\r\nfrequently. Padre Wolfgang, in charge of one of the missions of Santa\r\nCruz de la Sierra, was on one occasion attacked and several of his men\r\nwere captured. A few days later he found them nailed to trees with\r\nnumerous long thorns. On another occasion he surprised a party of\r\nSirionós and succeeded in capturing seven; these he took back to the\r\nmission, but they proved to be intractable. He found it necessary to\r\ntie them to posts in order to prevent them from escaping. They steadily\r\nrefused food and water, and after a few days four died of starvation\r\nand sullenness. The priest took pity on the remaining three and\r\nreleased them.\r\n\r\nAfter five pleasant days crowded with interesting and unusual\r\nexperiences on the Chimoré we returned to the mission and spent a few\r\ndays there packing the valuable zoological collections. We then went\r\nback to our base on the Chaparé; for this journey we decided to go\r\nby way of the Coni, a small stream emptying into the Chaparé, a few\r\nmiles above Todos Santos. We followed a path through the forest for\r\na distance of three miles, arriving at a large clearing which was\r\nplanted in sugar-cane; but what surprised us greatly was the fact that\r\nthe owner was a Quechua, who had deserted his home in one of the high\r\nvalleys near Cochicancha, and had come to live in the hot tropics. He\r\nhad constructed a crude wooden mill for expressing the juice from the\r\ncane-stalks, erected a still, and was making alcohol. We had gone to\r\nthe mission with the intention of remaining a week, and filled with\r\nmany misgivings as to the outcome of our visit; but the good missionary\r\nhad proved to be one of the most kind-hearted and generous of men\r\nimaginable, and more than three weeks had flown before the many and\r\nimperative duties ahead forced us to return reluctantly to the port.\r\n\r\nPadre Fulgencio walked to the Coni with us, and supplied men and canoes\r\nfor the six hours’ journey to Todos Santos. His regret at our departure\r\nwas as genuine as our own, and I look forward with the utmost pleasure\r\nto another and longer visit to the mission and the boundless country of\r\nthe upper Chimoré in the not far-distant future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE CACTUS FORESTS OF CENTRAL BOLIVIA--COCHABAMBA TO SAMAIPATA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe journey from Cochabamba to Sucre presents difficulties, no matter\r\nwhich of the two available routes is selected. It is possible to take\r\na pack-train to the beginning of the railroad at Cala Cala and proceed\r\nby train to Potosi, thence by cart or pack-train (or by motor-car in\r\nthe dry season) to Sucre; but we preferred to go the whole way by\r\npack-train, following the roundabout Santa Cruz trail, as this would\r\nenable us to see the country and also to stop at any time we chose to\r\ninvestigate the fauna of a promising region.\r\n\r\nIt is an easy matter to rent mules and _arrieros_ in Cochabamba, either\r\nby the trip or month, and the latter way is the more satisfactory\r\nif one does not expect to spend too much time en route. We had been\r\ntold, however, that it was better to secure the animals at Tarata, a\r\nsmall town southeast of Cochabamba, so we decided to make that the\r\nexpedition’s starting-point.\r\n\r\nA narrow-gauge railroad connects Cochabamba with Arani, almost due\r\neast; Tarata is about half-way between the two. We took the train and\r\nsent our own mules overland, in charge of one of the men. It required\r\nbut two hours to make the trip. The entire region is naturally of a\r\nbarren, desolate nature; nevertheless it is densely populated with\r\nQuechua Indians. The low, earthen huts cover the desert-like plain and\r\nare so like it in color that it is at first impossible to distinguish\r\nthem. During the short rainy season crops of wheat and other grain are\r\nsown, and their growth is later promoted by means of irrigation. They\r\nalso cultivate grape-vines, and their small clumps of peach and apricot\r\ntrees were in full bloom.\r\n\r\nThe train stopped at numerous little stations, and at each of them\r\ngayly dressed Quechua squaws sold fried eggs, boiled corn, and bread.\r\nOccasionally they also had stew or meat pies, but these were always to\r\nbe regarded with suspicion. Our boy told us that cavies are ordinarily\r\nused in preparing the meat foods; but a woman tried substituting toads\r\non one occasion, with the result that those who partook of the delicacy\r\nbecame violently ill.\r\n\r\nCrowds of Indians boarded and left the train at each station. The\r\naccommodations at their disposal resemble cattle-cars from the outside,\r\nbut have two long benches running through the centre. The fare is\r\nvery low, and the Indians are fond of travelling, so the cars were\r\ninvariably crowded to suffocation. In addition to the mass of humanity\r\neach person carried a huge parcel, pail, or basket, that filled the\r\nfew interstices. The Quechuas and Cholos are a good-natured lot among\r\nthemselves, and do not in the least mind being placed in such close\r\nproximity with one another.\r\n\r\nWe reached Tarata in two hours. It is a town of considerable size;\r\nthe elevation is nine thousand eight hundred feet, and it is desolate\r\nbeyond description. The inhabitants are largely Indians of an\r\nindependent temperament, though living in abject poverty. We found\r\nit almost impossible to secure lodging, or to find help to carry our\r\nluggage up from the station, so appealed to the chief of police, who\r\nrounded up a number of men and placed them at our disposal. Perhaps our\r\ndifficulty was due partly to the fact that the Indians were celebrating\r\na religious holiday. They had taken an image of a saint from the church\r\nand were carrying it back and forth through the streets. A group of\r\nthem preceded the procession and set off pinwheels and cannon crackers,\r\nwhile those following also employed explosives of various kinds with\r\nwhich to add to the din. The people are so fond of this sort of pastime\r\nthat it is difficult to persuade them to desist long enough to perform\r\nany service, no matter how slight; and the guise of religious fervor\r\ngives them license to indulge in acts that would not be tolerated at\r\nother times.\r\n\r\nPadre Fulgencio, with whom we had become acquainted at the mission on\r\nthe Chimoré, had told me a great deal about the monastery of San José,\r\nlocated at Tarata, and had given us a letter of introduction to the\r\nabbot. We therefore called upon that personage at the first available\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nThe huge building stands on an eminence overlooking the town and\r\nsurrounding country, and is said to be the largest of its kind in\r\nBolivia. We were ushered through long, gloomy corridors, past rows of\r\nsmall, cell-like rooms, and finally into the quarters of the abbot.\r\nThis good man received us in his cell, and cordially offered to assist\r\nus in any way possible. He also invited us to make the monastery our\r\nhome during our stay in Tarata. A group of monks added their invitation\r\nto their superior’s, but the edifice, with walls eight or ten feet\r\nthick, small, narrow windows, bare, gloomy rooms, and the chill damp\r\nas of a dungeon was not very inviting, and we preferred to return to\r\nthe Quechua hut that seemed to belong more to the every-day world. One\r\nof the priests, however, secured an _arriero_ and mules to take us the\r\nfirst stage of the journey.\r\n\r\nOur man arrived about noon on Sunday, September 18. Much to our\r\nsurprise we saw that he had but one arm, but this did not prevent him\r\nfrom being one of the best mule-men we ever employed. He had evolved\r\na clever system of loading the packs that was admirably suited to his\r\nneeds. Instead of the long ropes or thongs ordinarily used to tie on\r\nthe cargoes he had strong nets that fitted over the packs, with loops\r\nthat could be hooked over pegs in the pack-saddle. He lifted the\r\ntrunks, each weighing one hundred and twenty-five pounds with his one\r\narm, slipped them into place, and then tied them securely to prevent\r\nthem from bouncing up and down as the animals trotted along.\r\n\r\nThe first afternoon’s ride was short and ended at the _arriero’s_\r\nhouse in a village called Uaiculi. There, as at Tarata, scores of\r\nyellow finches lived about the houses; they were fully as plentiful as\r\nEnglish sparrows are in the United States, and acted not unlike them.\r\nThe soil in this entire region is so arid and rocky that even cacti\r\ngrow in limited numbers only. There are no streams, so water of a poor\r\nquality is obtained from deep wells. Nevertheless the whole country\r\nis thickly settled. The Indians are adepts at conserving the scanty\r\nwater-supply, and at irrigating. They grow fruit and also cultivate\r\nsmall, isolated fields of grain, but the greater part of their\r\nsubsistence is derived from the flocks of sheep and goats that seem to\r\nthrive in the desert-like country.\r\n\r\nThe climate is very cold and during the winter months there is a high\r\nwind. We could see funnel-shaped masses of dust moving across the plain\r\nall day long; occasionally a dozen or more, resembling small cyclones,\r\nwere visible at the same time.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Uaiculi the way lay along the edge of the barren plain\r\nfor some miles. A ridge of high peaks, some of them covered with snow,\r\nrises on each side. Then the trail ascended the slope to the east,\r\nrising gradually in a series of terraces, four to six hundred feet\r\nhigh. Sometimes low hills flanked the trail, and often we passed along\r\nthe top of flat plateaus.\r\n\r\nThe slopes of the highest peaks were littered with fields of broken\r\nsandstone that resembled a quarry-dump for shattered rocks of large\r\nsize; groves of gnarled trees, not over twenty-five feet high, grew in\r\nthese rock-strewn areas, and we found them nowhere else. Where there\r\nwere no rocks thick clumps of tall grass stood. When we reached the\r\nelevation of thirteen thousand four hundred and fifty feet we found a\r\nvery peculiar plant belonging to the bromelias (_Puya_); the smooth,\r\ntrunk-like stem was about eighteen inches through; this served as a\r\npedestal for the dense clump of slender, bayonet-like leaves; a tall\r\nspike of small yellow flowers rose from the centre of the plant.\r\nNumbers of giant humming-birds (_Patagona gigas_) came to sip nectar\r\nfrom these flowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The great _Puya_, a species of pine growing in the\r\nBolivian Andes at an elevation of 13,000 feet.]\r\n\r\nThe mountains seem formed of solid sandstone. Here and there a ledge,\r\nworn and rounded by the elements, projects conspicuously and resembles\r\nan impregnable fort or castle of majestic though fantastic design.\r\nWe reached a lone Indian hut late at night, and, while the _arriero_\r\nwas loath to halt, the mules were too tired to go much farther. The\r\nneighborhood was in bad repute on account of a number of robberies and\r\nmurders that had recently taken place there, and not long after our\r\narrival we saw mysterious signal-fires spring up on the surrounding\r\nslopes. We therefore camped in a corral, the enclosing stone walls\r\nserving as a barricade, and alternately did sentry duty throughout the\r\nnight. I believe one of the reasons for our being left severely alone\r\nwas that each member of the expedition was advised to display casually\r\nhis pistol to the inhabitants of the hut, and to acquaint them with\r\nits possibilities. This same ruse has prevented serious trouble in a\r\nnumber of instances. I have found that by far in the greater part of\r\nSouth America there is not the slightest necessity of carrying a weapon\r\nof any kind; but there are isolated regions where the moral effect\r\non the natives produced by wearing a revolver of generous size in a\r\nconspicuous place is so great that one may tread with impunity what\r\nwould otherwise be dangerous ground.\r\n\r\nThe next night was spent on the banks of a narrow creek called\r\nUsiamayo, the elevation being only seven thousand nine hundred feet.\r\nMany Indians live on both sides of the stream. They own numerous flocks\r\nof sheep and goats and cultivate extensive areas of maize and wheat.\r\nTheir huts are low, primitive affairs, and of such small size that they\r\nresemble overcrowded rabbit-hutches. Freshly cut grain was piled in\r\nneat heaps that were surrounded by fences of thorny brush to keep the\r\nsheep and cattle away. Corn fodder was stored in the tops of low trees.\r\nFrom a distance these aerial storage-places looked as if they might\r\nbe the nests of some giant bird. Invariably a little shelter or wigwam\r\nstood in the centre of each field, or in several instances it had\r\nbeen built in the branches of a stunted tree. These are the Quechuas’\r\nguard-houses; they are occupied by a watchman day and night so long as\r\ncrops are in the field, and thieves have but slight chance, indeed, of\r\nescaping his vigilant eyes.\r\n\r\nIt was less than half a day’s ride from the Usiamayo to Mizque, a town\r\nof small size, the capital of the Province of Mizque. The cactus-forest\r\nbelt of central Bolivia has its beginning in this region, although it\r\ndoes not reach its maximum development until some distance farther\r\nsouth. A part of the surrounding country, however, is fertile and\r\nprovides pasturage for horses and cattle, and areas of some extent are\r\nalso cultivated; this is particularly true of the land near the small\r\nstream bearing the same name as the town and province. A great deal of\r\nthe acreage is planted in peppers, for which there is a good demand\r\nthroughout the country, and which fetch a high price. The seeds are\r\nsown in small, sunken squares or “pans,” where the plants remain until\r\nseveral inches high. They are then transplanted to the fields. I saw\r\nnumbers of Indians weeding in the plantations, and when they neglected\r\ntheir work or accidentally pulled up a few of the precious plants\r\ntogether with the grass, their employers did not hesitate to cuff or\r\nkick them. When the peppers are ripe they are dried and done up into\r\nbales of about fifty pounds each; the natives are very fond of them and\r\neat quantities just as we eat an apple or other fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fauna of the Mizque region is typical of the arid highlands; but\r\nmany species of birds belonging to a different zone were met with\r\nfor the first time in Bolivia. I immediately recognized the white\r\nanis (_guiras_) that were so common near Asuncion, and there was also\r\na species of puff-bird, or bucco, and a little finch of a deep-red\r\ncolor (_Coryphospingus_). The number of doves in the open fields was\r\nastonishing; they fed on weed-seeds, and when disturbed flew to the\r\nnearest bush or low tree which they covered much in the same manner\r\nthat passenger pigeons are said to have done in this country not so\r\nmany years ago. One could easily have secured thirty or forty with a\r\nsingle charge of number ten shot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The plaza at Mizque.]\r\n\r\nNear Mizque lies a narrow valley enclosed on both sides by ridges of\r\nlow mountains. We repaired to this space and camped in a decaying\r\nstructure that formerly served as a sawmill; for, strange to relate,\r\nthis little valley was originally wooded. Most of the trees had been\r\ncut down and converted into lumber, and while a large part of the land\r\nwas under cultivation, there were also extensive patches of brush and\r\nsecond growth. Tujma, as the place is called, deserved more time than\r\nwe could give it. In addition to the birds found at Mizque were many\r\nspecies unknown to us; among them a blue-fronted and a red-fronted\r\nparrakeet, and a gorgeous Amazon parrot. There was also a kind of macaw\r\n(_Ara_) that we saw in that region only, and even there it was rare;\r\nthe forehead and shoulders are of a blazing crimson, and the underparts\r\nof a pale-yellow color, the rest of the bird being green. Most members\r\nof the parrot family were feeding on cactus fruits that were ripening\r\nin great abundance.\r\n\r\nA hummer of rather modest attire, being of a grayish color, but larger\r\nthan our own ruby-throat, had a dainty little nest, containing two\r\nwhite, bean-like eggs, suspended from the ceiling of our hut. At first\r\nthe bird was greatly distressed at our appearance and darted out each\r\ntime we came in; but finally it became more confident and returned,\r\nfrequently hovering overhead to inspect us several minutes at a time,\r\nand then slipping quietly into the nest where it sat unconcernedly, its\r\nlong tongue playing in and out of the bill, like a snake’s.\r\n\r\nOur next station was the large Indian town of Totora. We covered the\r\nentire distance of more than thirty miles in a day. The country is\r\nrough and the trail runs up and down over numerous mountain-tops,\r\nvarying between seven thousand one hundred and ten thousand feet in\r\nheight. There are a number of deep ravines filled with low, dry woods;\r\nthey form the connecting-links with the lowland forest, and it is up\r\nthese avenues that the new fauna we were constantly observing finds an\r\neasy means of invading the uplands. Before reaching Totora we had seen\r\nguans, and jays of a dark-blue color.\r\n\r\nThere were many Indians on the trail; most of them were driving burros\r\nladen with fire-wood, peppers, or sundry articles. When the tired\r\nanimals stopped for a moment’s breathing-spell, their owners beat\r\nthem unmercifully with stones and clubs so that some of them dropped\r\nsenseless in their tracks. The drivers also used sticks with sections\r\nof cactus stuck on the end as prods to urge on the worn-out creatures.\r\n\r\nTotora is to me the most desolate and unattractive place in all\r\nBolivia, and the inhabitants are quite in keeping with their town. It\r\nis frequently spoken of as the miniature La Paz because, like that\r\ncity, it is built in a crevice in the mountains, and one does not see\r\nit until on the very brink of the precipice above. The inhabitants are\r\npractically all Quechuas, or Cholos of a low type who spend most of\r\ntheir time drinking, swearing, and fighting; then they unburden their\r\nsouls of guilt by celebrating a religious fiesta. We witnessed one such\r\nperformance the day after our arrival. Indians and Cholos formed the\r\ninevitable procession, headed by members of the clergy; they halted at\r\neach corner and sang a hymn to the tune of a few blaring brass horns.\r\nThe _gente decente_ stood on the upper balconies of their mud huts and\r\nshowered home-made confetti and firecrackers on the heads of the sacred\r\nstatue and the marchers.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of Totora make some of the loveliest blankets found in all\r\nBolivia and--since the introduction of cheap German dyes--some of the\r\nmost atrocious. They are woven of coarse yarn, are thick and heavy and\r\nof large size, being about seven or eight feet square. Usually there\r\nare wide stripes of two colors merging gradually into one another,\r\nand when some harmonious combination is used, such as dark green and\r\nyellow, the effect is very pleasing. The price of a blanket, requiring\r\nmonths to make and containing six or eight pounds of wool, was about\r\nthree dollars.\r\n\r\nContinuing our journey by way of Duraznillos and Lajma, we reached\r\nChilón at the end of three days. A more tiresome trip is hard to\r\nimagine; the country is so uneven that one is constantly going either\r\nup hill or down, and the altitude varies from that of Totora, nine\r\nthousand eight hundred feet to ten thousand five hundred feet. The\r\nbroken, arid landscape becomes monotonous, and the climate is trying\r\nowing to the heat at midday and the freezing temperature at night. The\r\nIndians scattered along the way are not of a particularly friendly\r\nnature, and are only indifferent at best.\r\n\r\nAt Chilón we entered the heart of the giant-cactus forest--and it can\r\nbe properly known by no other name. The country, far as the eye can\r\nsee, is covered with the thorny plants; some of the giant club-cacti\r\nrear their fluted columns to a height of sixty to seventy-five feet,\r\nand are of majestic appearance. There are also immense clumps of\r\nprickly-pear and several other varieties, while low, trailing kinds hug\r\nthe rocky earth; the latter are rather unpleasant as one frequently\r\nstrikes against them in walking, and the sharp spines penetrate\r\nshoe-leather and are extracted from the foot with difficulty; mules\r\nfrequently get them into their noses while nibbling on leaves or the\r\nfew blades of coarse grass, and are driven almost frantic with the\r\npain. Many of the club-cactus plants bore an abundance of round fruit\r\nabout two inches in diameter and covered with long, velvety down; when\r\nthe outer covering was brushed off a smooth, red berry was revealed; it\r\nis very sweet and the flavor reminds one of strawberries.\r\n\r\nChilón is a settlement of twenty-five or thirty huts; its elevation\r\nabove sea-level is five thousand six hundred feet, but the climate is\r\nvery hot. We put up in one of the hovels where there was also a corral\r\nfor the mules, and proceeded to work along the banks of the Rio Chilón,\r\nwhich is a small tributary of the Rio Mizque. The stream is rapid and\r\nshallow, and flows over a rock-strewn bed. Numbers of fish, including\r\nrays, were plainly visible through the clear water. The majority of\r\nthe birds inhabiting the thorny jungle that grows on both sides of\r\nthe watercourse, were still of the arid upland type; but there was\r\na further encroachment of a foreign fauna, and the brown-shouldered\r\norioles, coral-billed tinamou, and red-tailed parrakeets left no doubts\r\nin our minds of the origin of their distribution. They were the advance\r\nranks of a stream of bird-life flowing up the valley of the Rio Grande\r\nand its tributaries, where conditions are at least somewhat similar to\r\nthose obtaining in the chaco country to the east, which is their normal\r\nhabitat.\r\n\r\nApparently the red-tailed parrakeets were mating. Large groups sat on\r\nthe branches of some stunted tree, preening one another’s plumage, and\r\nemitting queer ani-like wails. If one observed closely, however, it\r\ncould be seen that the flocks were always broken up into pairs that\r\nwere snuggled up as closely together as possible.\r\n\r\nComarapa, the next station, is very similar to Chilón, but somewhat\r\nlarger. The town is built near the base of a high range that towers\r\nto the east. A stream of small size flows past the settlement; it is\r\nknown as the Rio Comarapa, and is thought to be the headwater of the\r\nIchilo and Mamoré. The Indians said that the river flows through a deep\r\ncleft in the mountains, impossible to follow or navigate; also that an\r\nexploration-party of Germans once crossed the range with the object\r\nof locating the Ichilo on the other side, but after spending several\r\nmonths in the wilderness they returned without having found the river.\r\nThere was at one time a well-known trail across the mountains, over\r\nwhich war-parties of Yuracaré Indians crossed to attack the settlers,\r\nand later they came to work in the pepper-fields; but the location\r\nof this passageway doubtless leading to the Ichilo or some other\r\nnavigable stream, has been forgotten.\r\n\r\nA few of the older families of Comarapa possess wonderful collections\r\nof ancient silverware made by the Spaniards centuries ago. One finds it\r\ndifficult to refrain from openly admiring the massive ladles, bowls,\r\nplates, and cups that are unostentatiously placed on the table before\r\nthe guest, but such a procedure would be considered unpardonable, as\r\nany comment on such possessions is looked upon with suspicion. To\r\nattempt to purchase an article of this kind is regarded as a very grave\r\nbreach of etiquette; but not infrequently the owners of these treasures\r\nexperience the need of ready money and will offer them for a fraction\r\nof their value.\r\n\r\nThe elevation of Comarapa is six thousand six hundred feet. But a\r\nshort distance away rises the first outlier of the Andean Range, eight\r\nthousand three hundred feet high; from its summit we could see two\r\nother ridges, both of greater height, that must be crossed before\r\nreaching the forested slopes on the eastern side; and there may be\r\nmore. We descended one thousand seven hundred feet into a small valley\r\ncalled California, settled by a few Quechua families. These people were\r\nsqualid beyond description. Their dilapidated huts swarmed with fleas,\r\nand vermin of many kinds was so numerous that during the three days and\r\nnights we spent in the valley, no member of the party found it possible\r\nto get an hour’s sleep altogether. We left sooner than we had expected,\r\nas the insect plague drove us to the verge of exhaustion. Practically\r\nall the Indians we saw were suffering from consumption. Many of them\r\nhad lost the sight of one eye, and I was told that in fighting among\r\nthemselves they invariably try to gouge out one another’s eyes with\r\ntheir thumbs.\r\n\r\nFrom a short distance the valley and the slopes above California appear\r\nto be heavily forested, but a close inspection showed that there was\r\nbut a dense growth of low, dry woods, the trees not exceeding forty\r\nfeet in height; the interlocking branches were draped with long\r\nstreamers of grayish moss. The ground was perfectly clean and one could\r\nsee a long distance ahead in the greenish-gray light. The surroundings\r\nwere almost weird; subconsciously one expected to find strange\r\nsacrificial altars, and bearded Druids officiating at some gruesome\r\nrite of a mythical religion. Beautiful little deer walked timidly among\r\nthe column-like trunks of the garlanded sanctuary, sniffing the air,\r\nand nibbling daintily at a leaf or twig, and made the hunter feel like\r\nan intruder in a consecrated place.\r\n\r\nUpon our return to Comarapa we met a gentleman representing a\r\nmercantile establishment in Cochabamba. He was making his semiannual\r\ntour of the region, taking orders for merchandise, and collecting for\r\ngoods sold on the previous trip. Most of his customers paid with silver\r\nand nickel coins, so that he had several mule-loads of money in his\r\npossession. One night our Indian boy came to us in a state of great\r\nexcitement. He had been drinking _chicha_ in an Indian liquor-store\r\ntogether with the _peons_ belonging to the merchant, and one of them,\r\nwhile under the influence of drink, boasted that he expected to murder\r\nand rob his _patrón_. A plan had been carefully formed to suddenly\r\nattack the man from behind, while riding along a lonely and precipitous\r\npart of the trail. The body was then to be thrown over the precipice\r\ninto the river below, where no one would ever discover it, and the\r\nmoney taken by the highwayman and his accomplice. Naturally, we lost\r\nno time in imparting this information to the traveller, and he at once\r\ninterviewed the would-be assassin. He first of all questioned the man\r\ncarefully, and when he had succeeded in obtaining a partial confession,\r\nhe mauled him back and forth across the room until he was tired out.\r\nThereafter we all travelled together, and the plotter, as further\r\npunishment, was deprived of his horse and compelled to walk in advance\r\nof the party day after day. He had been in the merchant’s employ six\r\nyears, and the latter did not care to turn him over to the police, but\r\nwas certain that the punishment inflicted was sufficient to inspire\r\nproper respect in the future.\r\n\r\nA brisk canter of eighteen miles took us from Comarapa to Pulcina, also\r\nknown as San Isidro. A tame condor was standing dolefully in the centre\r\nof the open square about which the houses were built; it was a friendly\r\nbird and liked to be petted and to romp, but was pretty rough at times,\r\nand picked off pieces of skin during the course of its rather too\r\naffectionate caresses.\r\n\r\nAs we unloaded the mules the bells in the tiny box-like church began\r\nto tinkle, and all the people rushed out of their houses, bearing\r\nlighted candles in their hands. They hurried to one of the huts where\r\na youth lay dying, and crowded into the one dingy room, filling it\r\nto overflowing, and raising their voices in wails and lamentations;\r\nthis continued for half an hour. No priest or physician was present;\r\nonly the noisy mob of half-wild people, to whom death comes as a\r\ndivertisement from the daily humdrum of half-lived lives, to speed the\r\nparting soul to the great beyond.\r\n\r\nPulcina was swarming with dogs. It seemed as if each family owned at\r\nleast half a dozen. They were a hungry mongrel lot, that roamed at\r\nlarge, snarling at passers-by and rending the night with howls and\r\nfighting. It was impossible to keep them out of the houses, and no\r\nmatter how often they were driven away they always returned to rummage\r\namong the luggage and attempt to tear open the provision-sacks. Toward\r\nmorning, when the dogs had departed, pigs came to take their place.\r\nEach of them wore a long, forked stick over the neck, like an inverted\r\nY; another stick was lashed across the bottom so that the pig’s neck\r\nwas enclosed in a complete wooden triangle. This arrangement would have\r\nkept the pigs from crawling through fences, had there been any. Some\r\nof the contrivances were so large that they had apparently been made\r\nin the hope that the animals would eventually grow to fit them; but as\r\nit was, they touched the ground and made the wearers think they were\r\nconstantly about to step over something, so they walked along raising\r\ntheir front feet like well-trained circus horses.\r\n\r\nA ride of thirty miles next day brought us to Pampa Grande. The town\r\nwas anything but what the name led us to expect. Instead of a vast,\r\ngrass-covered pampa, there was but a semiarid plain; near by extended\r\nthe wide, rocky bed of a river that contained not a drop of water.\r\nThe inhabitants had dug deep down into the gravel and scooped up the\r\nsmall quantity of thin mud that had collected; it is a place about\r\nthe size of Mizque but wretched-looking and forsaken. Formerly it had\r\na population of sixty thousand and was noted for the brilliancy and\r\ngayety of its annual fairs, that drew crowds even from the Argentine.\r\nEpidemics of fever, it is said, killed off many of the people, and\r\nothers fled from the threatening shadow of the pestilence, until to-day\r\nthe once thriving city has all but ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nAt Pampa Grande we had a very good illustration of two extreme types of\r\nBolivian character. When we entered the town, our travelling companion\r\nmet an acquaintance who owned practically the only house of any size.\r\nThe Bolivian greeted him in the friendliest and most polite manner\r\npossible, and insisted that all of us spend the night at his home; he\r\ndirected us to the house and then excused himself, saying that he would\r\nreturn presently. We found the place without difficulty, but the wife\r\nrefused to admit us and told us we might wait--in the street--until\r\nthe return of her husband. The school-teacher, seeing our predicament,\r\nventured to offer us the use of the classroom; he apologized because\r\nit was so small and the roof leaked; and the next day he refused to\r\naccept a single _centavo_ for the accommodation. The first man had\r\nnot returned home when we were leaving the following morning; from\r\nmy experience with the same type of person, I am certain that had he\r\nreturned and admitted us to his home, he would have made an exorbitant\r\ncharge that courtesy demanded our paying.\r\n\r\nThere now remained but one day’s ride to Samaipata, where the trail\r\ndivides--one branch leading toward Sucre, and the other to Santa Cruz\r\nde la Sierra. The farther eastward one goes the greener the country\r\nbecomes. Between the five-thousand-foot elevation of Pampa Grande and\r\nSamaipata, which is six thousand feet above sea-level, there are two\r\npeaks to be crossed, one seven thousand three hundred and twenty-five\r\nfeet, and the other six thousand seven hundred feet high. The top of\r\nthe former is known as the Alto de Mairana; it is a cold, dreary little\r\nplateau where half a dozen wretched Indians live. The town of Mairana\r\nis on the lower plain between the two peaks. Patches of low brush\r\nreplace the cacti and thorny, arid-region type of vegetation; there is\r\na sufficient water-supply; and the whole country seems to present a\r\ntransition zone of reviving life between the alternately hot and frigid\r\nupland deserts and the green slopes stretching toward Santa Cruz.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nA MULE-BACK JOURNEY ON THE SANTA CRUZ TRAIL TO SUCRE\r\n\r\n\r\nSamaipata is in no particular different from the towns through which\r\nwe had passed during the previous two weeks. Perhaps provisions were\r\nsomewhat more abundant, and a small number of mules and sheep grazed\r\nin the nearby pastures; but the general distress and dejection were\r\nvery much the same, and never failed to give one the impression that\r\nthe settlements were tottering on the brink of obliteration. Everywhere\r\nwe heard tales of woe about the prevalence of malarial fever during a\r\npart of the year, and that this disease was the cause of the desolation\r\nand extermination of the people; but as none of the places was lower\r\nthan five thousand feet above sea-level, and the country is of a\r\nsemiarid type, I am unable to understand how malaria could work such\r\nhavoc, and am inclined to attribute the dreadful inroads to some other\r\nlittle-known underlying cause.\r\n\r\nSince leaving Cochabamba we had made very good time; although there\r\nhad been several halts en route, the distance covered each day was\r\ncomparatively great, ranging sometimes up to forty miles, considering\r\nthat we always travelled with our pack-train. Such long rides were\r\nmade possible by the fact that all _arrieros_ were mounted; if they\r\ntravelled on foot, as in Colombia, the distance traversed each day\r\nwould be about half. Fast travelling, however, was hard on the mules.\r\nWhen we reached Samaipata our animals were in poor condition, so we\r\nleft them in charge of an attendant and engaged a complete new outfit\r\nfor a short side-trip toward Santa Cruz.\r\n\r\nOne of our main objects in undertaking this entire long, arduous\r\njourney was to attempt to determine the southern limit of the\r\nsubtropical forest zone. This type of forest grows on the eastern\r\nslopes only of the Bolivian Andes; a section directly eastward would,\r\ntherefore, take us through this zone and possibly enable us to find the\r\nsolution to the problem. It was not intended to cover the entire one\r\nhundred and ten miles from Samaipata to Santa Cruz, but only to go far\r\nenough to secure the desired information.\r\n\r\nThe mountain range breaks down rapidly east of Samaipata, but the road\r\nto Santa Cruz is, nevertheless, neither an easy nor a level one. There\r\nare still four steep ridges to cross, called Cuevas, Negra, Herradura,\r\nand Guitara; between them lie small, well-watered valleys, planted in\r\ncane and fruits, and settled by Bolivians of Spanish extraction. There\r\nare no more Quechuas, nor is their language spoken; after many months\r\nwe were once again in a Spanish-speaking world.\r\n\r\nThe trail, at least during the second day’s travel, lies near the\r\ncourse of the Rio Piray, and the scenery flanking this watercourse\r\nis among the most picturesque found in the Bolivian Andes. There is\r\na bewildering succession of dome-shaped peaks, unscalable cliffs and\r\noverhanging precipices, all of red sandstone. Many of the formations\r\nare spotlessly clean and smooth, as if scoured, or cut with a knife.\r\nThe river laves the base of the rugged chain, and dark caverns worn\r\ninto the frowning battlement open alluringly to tempt the adventurous\r\nspirit to explore their unknown depths.\r\n\r\nVermejo is the name given to a fertile region that may be called\r\n_yungas_, between the Negra and Herradura ridges. Several houses are\r\nscattered along the trail; the inhabitants grow maize, potatoes, and\r\nlarge quantities of cane that is used in making _chancaca_ (brown\r\nsugar) and molasses. The people also make bread and a peculiar\r\n“food-drink” called _somo_ to sell to passers-by. _Somo_ is made of\r\nboiled maize that has been left standing until fermentation sets in,\r\nand is taken with molasses. To us, the taste was very disagreeable,\r\nbut the natives were fond of it and purchased a bowlful at frequent\r\nintervals. _Chicha_, made from peanuts, was also to be had at some of\r\nthe dwellings.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the tracts cleared for cultivation, and the bare\r\nsandstone summits, the country is covered with light forest. There is\r\npractically no moss, but a dense undergrowth of climbing bamboo and\r\na few palms and ferns. As a whole, the vegetation does not greatly\r\nresemble that of the true subtropic or cloud-forest zone, and as this\r\nwas its upper limit and three thousand and five hundred feet above\r\nsea-level, it should have been of the subtropic type, if any exists\r\nin the region. We may, therefore, safely conclude that this marks the\r\nending of the zone of cloud forest existing on the eastern slope of the\r\nAndes during practically their entire course north of this point.\r\n\r\nBirds were not very common, and of comparatively few species; but the\r\nfauna is entirely different from that of the uplands. The brilliant\r\nlittle tanagers (_Calliste_), so typical of the mountain forest, are\r\nconspicuously absent. There were, however, several kinds of warblers,\r\nand wrens, parrots, and other birds properly belonging to such a\r\nregion. A black-and-white guan (_Pipile_) was really plentiful, and\r\nwhile the distribution of the species is very great, I had always\r\nconsidered it a rare bird. It is about twenty-eight inches long, and\r\nof a bronzy-black color. The top of the head and a large blotch on the\r\nwings are white; the naked cheeks and a long throat-caruncle are of a\r\ndelicate shade of grayish blue. The bird’s rasping cry may be heard\r\nmorning and evening, as it takes wing and alternately soars and flaps\r\nfrom one tree to another, or skims over the top of the forest. Adult\r\nbirds weigh up to four pounds and are killed for food on every possible\r\noccasion, as the flesh is very good. The individuals I examined had\r\nbeen feeding on green leaves swallowed whole.\r\n\r\nJays in flocks followed us about in the forest and kept up a constant\r\nscreaming and scolding. It was impossible to escape them without using\r\ndrastic measures. They were a great nuisance, as their cries frightened\r\nother forms of wild life away; both the black-fronted blue and the\r\ngreen-and-yellow species mingled in the same flocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vermejo on the Santa Cruz trail.]\r\n\r\nOne day we rode to the top of the next ridge, the Herradura, which\r\nis six thousand feet high. The trail winds up along the face of\r\nthe slope and is very poor in places; a row of wonderful crags and\r\ncathedral-shaped mountains stands like the ruins of a city on the\r\nopposite side of the ravine. On the face of one of the cliffs we\r\nsaw what seems to be a gigantic serpent carved in the red sandstone\r\ndirectly above two massive stones that stand as if forming a gateway.\r\nThe people say this is the entrance to a secret hiding-place used by\r\nthe Indians many years ago; or perhaps it might have been a prehistoric\r\nshrine. The outline of the supposed snake can be discerned with ease,\r\nand the body is marked with transverse black bands. It seems that the\r\nnatives have never taken the trouble to visit the spot, owing to the\r\ndifficulty of crossing the wild gorge.\r\n\r\nWe continued to the crest of the ridge; from this point of vantage it\r\nwas possible to secure a good view of the country to the east, but as\r\nit did not differ from that we had just left, there was no reason for\r\ngoing farther.\r\n\r\nThe vicinity of Vermejo had been headquarters of a band of brigands\r\nthat preyed upon travellers and caravans going to and from Santa\r\nCruz. They had had their rendezvous in one of the numerous caves, and\r\nfor a long time conducted their nefarious occupation with impunity.\r\nEventually, however, their depredations became so bold and wide-spread,\r\nthat a body of soldiers was sent against them. The bandits, brought to\r\nbay among the hills, found it impossible to withstand the onslaught\r\nof their assailants, and surrendered. It was said that a great many\r\nhorses and other property were recovered, and of the men captured a\r\nnumber were taken to Santa Cruz, and others to Cochabamba and executed.\r\nAfter that, thieving stopped for a while, but a new band was beginning\r\noperations at the time of our visit.\r\n\r\nThe amount of traffic along the trail was surprising. Most of the\r\ncaravans were from Cochabamba; they took merchandise to Santa Cruz and\r\nbrought back cigars and low-country products.\r\n\r\nThe language spoken by the _Cruzeños_ is very peculiar; the diminutive\r\n_ito_ is changed to _ingo_, so instead of saying _pocito_, _horita_,\r\nor _chiquito_, they say _pocingo_, _horinga_, and _chiquingo_, for\r\ninstance. There are also other changes that sound either confusing or\r\namusing at first. At any rate, they speak the language of the country,\r\nand do not copy that of the Indians. I have frequently wondered how\r\nany country, such as Paraguay or Bolivia, for example, could hope to\r\nadvance when its inhabitants adopt the language and customs of its\r\nIndian population, instead of introducing their own mode of living and\r\ninstitutions which should, at least, be on a higher plane. The former\r\nprocedure might be excusable to a limited degree in isolated cases\r\nwhen, for instance, a missionary goes among savages who have no reason\r\nfor being interested in the white man, and who do not recognize his\r\nauthority unless he can propound his doctrine in a way they can readily\r\nunderstand. It may be argued that a large proportion of the inhabitants\r\nof Paraguay or Bolivia are half-breeds and therefore naturally adhere\r\nto the ways of their Indian ancestry; but that only shows more\r\nconclusively than ever the weak, moral fibre of the Spanish half, that\r\nso readily succumbs to the Indian half. It is very safe to wager that\r\nif such a country were completely isolated from the remainder of the\r\nworld for a few generations, savagery would again come into its own and\r\nobliterate the traces of to-day’s civilization.\r\n\r\nIn the course of years of almost constant hunting one is compelled to\r\nhave some very peculiar and unusual experiences. One of these occurred\r\nat Malena, Colombia, when the wounded macaw entered our room. Another\r\ntook place at and near Vermejo. The evening before starting back to\r\nSamaipata, we noticed a flock of swifts soaring high above the hut.\r\nBoyle and I grabbed our shotguns and each took a quick shot before\r\nthe birds disappeared; my companion scored a clean hit; apparently I\r\nhad missed; but the next morning we were astonished to find a dead\r\nbird of the same species lying on a rock beside the trail, about two\r\nmiles distant, and more than one thousand feet above the place we had\r\nleft. I am convinced that it was the identical bird I had aimed at,\r\nand that it had continued flying until it died and fell in the spot\r\nwhere we chanced to find it. The natives do not shoot birds on the\r\nwing, because ammunition is too costly to take any chances with; under\r\nno circumstances would a charge be wasted on a small swift-winged\r\nbird; and also, when I prepared the bird I found a number-ten shot in\r\nits head, which is what we used; such small shot is not to be had by\r\nnatives, as none is used in the country. The coincidence of finding the\r\nbird is one that is not likely ever to be repeated.\r\n\r\nFrom Samaipata we turned southward toward Vallegrande. It required two\r\ndays’ travel to reach that town, over the same monotonous, broken,\r\nbarren country ranging in elevation from five thousand three hundred\r\nfeet to eight thousand two hundred and fifty feet. There are a few\r\ntrees near some of the small watercourses, but as a whole the country\r\nis unproductive. At Vallegrande, however, the ground is not so sterile.\r\nThe town also is more attractive, and the more cheerful environment\r\nis reflected in the dispositions of the people. I was particularly\r\nglad to find that some of the inhabitants showed traits of character\r\nunmistakably alien to the average Bolivian, and it did not require a\r\ngreat effort to trace them directly to the wholesome influence exerted\r\nby the American College at Cochabamba. It was forcibly demonstrated\r\nthat at least some of the students of the Cochabamba Institute\r\nintroduce into their houses and home towns the admirable precepts of\r\ntemperance, morality, and sincerity with which they have become imbued.\r\n\r\nTravel in the highlands of Bolivia presents a succession of\r\ndifficulties, chief of which is the scarcity of mules and also the lack\r\nof forage.\r\n\r\nThere is no natural pasturage, so the animals must subsist entirely\r\non oats grown by the Indians in irrigated areas. The cost of keeping\r\nanimals is prohibitive; instead of the one or two cents a day charged\r\nin the settled parts of Colombia, one is compelled to pay fifty cents\r\nor more. We should probably have been forced to remain in Vallegrande\r\na long time, had it not been for one Señor Villazón who provided the\r\npack-mules for the rest of the journey to Sucre.\r\n\r\nThe first day’s ride took us to the village of Pucará. A part of the\r\ndistance had been over a grass-covered plateau ten thousand feet high,\r\ncut in places by deep ravines filled with light woods. The second day\r\nwe faced the unpleasant prospect of having to cross the Rio Grande.\r\nThe few natives we met said that the river was probably very high and\r\nwere inclined to be pessimistic concerning our ability to get across;\r\nthey also advised us to return to Aiquile, near Mizque, as the stream\r\nis narrow and spanned by a bridge at that point; but as this meant\r\nretracing our steps the greater part of the way, we could not consider\r\nthe suggestion.\r\n\r\nOne has the first view of the Rio Grande from the top of a rocky\r\nmountain nine thousand five hundred feet high, of which we reached\r\nthe summit a few hours after leaving Pucará. Far below lay the dull,\r\nbrown ribbon of water, looking like a painted streak across a grayish\r\nbackground. The descent to the watercourse is so abrupt that in many\r\ninstances the trail consisted of a succession of steps hewn into the\r\nrock; toiling down the tortuous trail was life-sapping work for the\r\npack-animals; we relieved the riding animals by walking. Downward,\r\nalways downward, led the indistinct way, seemingly into a bottomless\r\nabyss. The mountainside is dry and cheerless; no dainty flower or blade\r\nof grass relieves the grim desolation of desert dust and shattered\r\nrock, and even the few grayish, stunted cacti seem to shrivel and die\r\nin the burning glare of a hostile sun. After hours that seemed more\r\nlike days we arrived at the dry bed of a narrow stream and followed\r\ndown its angular course. The aneroid showed that we were exactly one\r\nmile lower than our starting-point, but still the river seemed like a\r\nmirage, near, yet unattainable.\r\n\r\nAlthough the declivity was now gentler, the lofty walls of gray\r\nsandstone flanking the dismal canyon through which we rode shut off any\r\nventilating breeze that chanced to pass above, and made a stifling oven\r\nof the narrow fissure. For two hours we travelled over the rock-strewn\r\nstream-bed, and then suddenly entered a narrow belt of mimosas and\r\ncacti; the Rio Grande flows through the centre of the green little\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nAlthough the river had appeared peaceful enough from the summit five\r\nthousand seven hundred feet above, we found it to be a wide, brown\r\nsheet of ruffled water racing over a boulder-encumbered bed. Our\r\nmule-drivers were filled with alarm and dared not venture into the\r\ntreacherous flood. It was as we had feared; the spring rains had\r\nbegun in the mountains, and the surplus water was rapidly swelling\r\nthe lowland streams. While we were debating on the proper course to\r\npursue, an Indian youth chanced along and consented to guide us to a\r\nford about half a mile up-stream. Arrived at the spot, he stripped and\r\nwaded cautiously into the river, which here spread over a wide bar.\r\nFortunately the water was not over four feet deep; the youth returned\r\nto the bank and led the mules across one by one. When the river is too\r\nhigh to ford, the natives use tub-shaped boats made of ox-hide in which\r\nto cross; there is no way of controlling the craft, so the current may\r\ncarry them a mile or so below the starting-point before it reaches the\r\nother side.\r\n\r\nThe water of the river was unfit for drinking. It contains about thirty\r\nper cent solid matter, although the reason for this was that it was\r\nrising rapidly and bringing down a great quantity of sand from the\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\nNumbers of small ravines emerge from the barren slopes flanking the\r\nRio Grande, and streams of inconsiderable size pour their water into\r\nthe larger artery. All these openings are filled with brush and low\r\ntrees; we followed up one of them and, within a few hours, reached a\r\nhabitation called Bella Vista. The shambling structure stood on the\r\nedge of a clearing planted in sugar-cane. Dense jungles of wild cane\r\nand brush bounded the plantation. As I was already convinced that the\r\nRio Grande is the avenue up which the chaco bird-life was penetrating\r\ninto the higher regions, we determined to remain at Bella Vista\r\nsufficiently long to substantiate my views; it required only one day\r\nfor this purpose. The species that had been found in limited numbers\r\nfarther up, and that seemed to belong to a strange fauna, exist in\r\nabundance at Bella Vista; among them are brown-shouldered orioles,\r\nwhite anis (_Guira_), fork-tailed goatsuckers, white-throated toucans\r\n(_Ramphastos_) and many others.\r\n\r\nPigeons (_Leptoptila_) were so numerous that they suffered for lack of\r\nfood. I am unable to say whether there had been an abnormal increase\r\nin the number of the species, or if the food-supply was unusually low;\r\nbut one thing is certain--they were in a very emaciated condition and\r\nsome of them had become so weakened that flight was impossible, and\r\nthey fell an easy prey to the natives or predatory animals. I also\r\nnoticed that all the pigeons were infested with parasites, but the\r\nweaker individuals were covered with them, including many winged,\r\nfly-like bird-ticks (_Hippoboscidæ_) that skipped among the feathers at\r\nbewildering speed, and finally flew away with a loud buzz; sometimes\r\nthe repulsive insects settled on our hands or faces, when it was almost\r\nimpossible to displace them, owing to their agile movements and to\r\ntheir clinging ability caused by the hooks on their feet.\r\n\r\nThis furnished a very good illustration of the survival of the fittest,\r\nand one that I believe is typical of what happens in many instances.\r\nOwing, perhaps, to unusual or long-continued favorable conditions,\r\nthe species had become exceedingly numerous. So long as there was no\r\nshortage in the food-supply, the birds were able to hold their own\r\nand keep increasing; but, as the season of famine approached, as I\r\nbelieve it must occasionally do, though not necessarily at regular\r\nintervals, the weaker individuals were the first to feel the pinch of a\r\nreduced subsistence which automatically rendered them still less suited\r\nto obtain a livelihood. Their rapidly failing vigor also prevented\r\nthem from coping with their natural enemies--whether parasitic or\r\npredaceous, so that they were soon eliminated and only those that\r\nentered the struggle in the strongest, healthiest condition stood a\r\nreasonable show of surviving.\r\n\r\nWhile tramping through the cane-thickets, we found the nest of a pair\r\nof red-breasted thrushes. Both parent birds fluttered over our heads\r\nand with loud, angry cries expressed their resentment and anxiety.\r\nThe nest was betrayed by the birds’ very actions. It was cunningly\r\nconcealed in a dense tangle of leaves and creepers, and was not unlike\r\nthat made by our own robin; but the three eggs were heavily spotted\r\nwith brown instead of being of a plain blue color.\r\n\r\nWhen dusk overtook us on the first day out of Pescado, thirty-six\r\nmiles southeast of Bella Vista, we were riding over a grass-covered\r\nplateau with a stream flowing along one side of it. It was therefore\r\nunnecessary to seek an Indian dwelling for the purpose of securing\r\nforage. We picketed the mules, and slept out in the open. The next\r\nmorning a Quechua woman with a fowl under her arm passed along the\r\ntrail; we asked her the price of the bird, as we suspected that she\r\nwas taking it to some village to sell. “Four bolivianos,” she replied\r\npromptly. The mule-driver remarked, very emphatically, that the price\r\nwas exorbitant. “But,” she protested, “this is a game-cock. It is a\r\ngood fighter and can whip any rooster in the country.” The arriero then\r\ninformed her that we wanted the rooster to eat, and not to fight. “Oh,”\r\nsaid the woman, “that is another matter; sixty _centavos_,” and the\r\nsale was concluded without further argument.\r\n\r\nApparently the birds of the highlands were nesting. We saw numbers of\r\nnewly constructed nests in the cacti and small-leaved vegetation; they\r\nbelonged to mocking-birds, pigeons, and finches; but only a few of them\r\ncontained eggs. The Indians had filled many of the little domiciles\r\nwith stones before they were completed in an attempt to prevent an\r\nincrease in the numbers of birds. Large flocks of several species\r\ngather in the grain-fields during the fall months and exact rather\r\na heavy tribute, and it is for this reason that the Indians try to\r\nprevent their increase.\r\n\r\nWhile riding along one morning we flushed a red-crested woodpecker\r\n(_Chrysoptilus cristatus_) from a hole in a stub near the road. The\r\nentrance to the cavity was about eight feet up, but the nest was\r\ndown low in the hollow trunk. An investigation brought to view four\r\npear-shaped, glossy, white eggs lying on a pad of chips.\r\n\r\nThis species is one of the commonest, and therefore one of the\r\nbest-known woodpeckers. We found it very abundant throughout the\r\nuplands near, and south of Cochabamba, where there was a growth of\r\ncacti and low trees. Invariably there were two birds together, and not\r\ninfrequently we saw flocks of four or five. It has a clear, powerful\r\nnote, and a swift, undulating flight. I have frequently seen it on the\r\nground in company with long-billed wood-hewers (_Drymornis_) and brown\r\ncachalotes (_Homorus_) searching for insects and larvæ among the débris\r\nalways littering the ground beneath the giant club-cacti.\r\n\r\nAs we neared Sucre, a marked change was noticeable in the appearance of\r\nthe Indians. Instead of the unattractive lot that we had encountered\r\ndaily, they were a uniformly garbed, more primitive and more\r\npicturesque people. The greatest change was evident at Pulqué, which we\r\nreached a few weeks later.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Quechua habitation on the upland desert.]\r\n\r\nTarabuco is the name given to a town of large size, located on a\r\nfrigid _mesa_ over ten thousand feet up. When we arrived there snow\r\nwas falling and an icy wind blew at terrific velocity; but the natives\r\nseemed not at all discomfited by the blizzard, and were conducting the\r\nweekly market with the usual hilarity. Provisions of many kinds\r\nwere to be had in abundance; mutton, bread, peaches, and eggs were\r\nparticularly plentiful; but the lack of fruits and vegetables requiring\r\na warm climate and rich soil was very noticeable. One could purchase\r\nall the necessaries of life in any of the numerous stores; most of them\r\nwere imported from the United States and Europe.\r\n\r\nWe spent the night before reaching Sucre in a cluster of Indian\r\ndwellings called Cghilka. The pronunciation of the name is difficult to\r\na foreigner, because two of the three “cliks” employed in the Quechua\r\nlanguage are used in saying the word. Cghilka consisted of half a dozen\r\nlow hovels, built of irregular stones and roofed over with grass.\r\nFlocks of sheep and a few burros nibbled the short grass, and goats\r\nclambered along the face of precipices unscalable to human beings; some\r\nof the latter also stood on the top of stone fences, or roofs, and\r\nseveral times we saw individuals that had climbed into the branches of\r\na leaning mimosa and were unconcernedly browsing on the leaves.\r\n\r\nThe Indian women, it seemed to us, were everlastingly spinning in order\r\nto keep up the necessary supply of clothing. Those at Cghilka were no\r\nexceptions; but they also made unusually pretty blankets. In spite of\r\nthe fact that many colors, such as red, blue, green, yellow, and white\r\nwere used in the same blanket, the combination was so harmonious that\r\nthe result was most pleasing. As a whole, the work somewhat resembles\r\nthat of the Navajos, but the texture is not quite as fine. They also\r\nwork attractive geometric designs into the pattern that immediately\r\ndistinguishes the product of this region from that of any other. This\r\nis, perhaps, a retention of an ancient custom, for, it seems as if in\r\nolden times the inhabitants of each locality wore _ponchos_ or blankets\r\nof a distinctive design; then, when the nation gathered in the holy\r\ncity of Cuzco to celebrate some religious festival, it was possible to\r\ntell by these insignia from which part of the empire they came.\r\n\r\nFrom Cghilka to Sucre is a distance of only eighteen miles, over a\r\npractically level plain, the elevation of which is in the neighborhood\r\nof ten thousand feet. There are few habitations until the immediate\r\nvicinity of the city is reached.\r\n\r\nThe approach to Sucre is quite attractive. We could see the assemblage\r\nof dazzling white edifices from a distance; and not long after we were\r\ngalloping over the cobblestones between rows of neat, clean buildings\r\non our way to the Hotel Español. In our journey from Cochabamba we had\r\ntravelled nearly a thousand miles, and counting the several delays, had\r\nspent fifty-six days en route.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nSUCRE, THE RIO PILCOMAYO, AND THE UPLAND DESERT TO THE ARGENTINE\r\nFRONTIER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Sucre insist that their city is still the capital\r\nof the country, and that the removal of the government to La Paz is\r\ntemporary only, owing to the greater accessibility of the latter place.\r\nThey are confident that with the completion of the railroad from Potosi\r\nthe old régime will return, and with it the gayety and activities that\r\nsuch an event occasions. This, however, does not seem probable.\r\n\r\nThe city is built on a plateau over nine thousand feet up, on the\r\nsite of an ancient Indian village known as Choquesaka. Its climate\r\nis that of perpetual spring. The streets are very wide, paved with\r\ncobblestones, and are kept exceedingly clean. The buildings are, for\r\nthe greater part, low, although edifices of pretentious dimensions and\r\nimposing appearance are not lacking, and numbers of most attractive\r\nsummer homes dot the surrounding country. The Medical Institute is\r\nwell-known throughout the neighboring republics, and annually supplies\r\nthem with thousands of tubes of vaccine. The markets are abundantly\r\nsupplied with provisions of all kinds, at reasonable prices, including\r\nmany fruits and vegetables of a temperate climate--brought from the\r\neastern lowlands.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the upper class are well educated, refined, and\r\ncharming. There is a total population of about twenty-five thousand,\r\nbut by far the greater part of it consists of Quechuas and Cholos.\r\nAs a whole, Sucre is one of the most delightful spots in all Bolivia\r\nand, when the vast country to the east with its unlimited resources\r\nis made accessible, the city will unquestionably enjoy the growth and\r\nprosperity to which it is so well entitled.\r\n\r\nHowever, South American cities, with few exceptions, possess little\r\nattraction for me. I touch upon them almost reluctantly, and am\r\nimpatient to return to the wild, free life of the boundless jungle,\r\ndesert, or plain.\r\n\r\nWithin a few days after reaching Sucre, our necessary business affairs\r\nhad been looked after and we had decided upon the upper Rio Pilcomayo\r\nas our next field of operations. Pack-mules were not to be had; the few\r\n_patrones_ who owned herds of these very necessary beasts were all en\r\nroute to or from Cochabamba. A weekly motor-bus service is maintained\r\nbetween Sucre and Potosi, and the powerful cars passed within a\r\nstone’s throw of the spot we decided to visit; but the list of waiting\r\npassengers was long, and even though a little monetary persuasion might\r\nhave been helpful in securing an early passage for ourselves, the\r\ntransportation of our luggage by that means was out of the question.\r\nWe therefore secured the services of a _coche_. Six mules hitched to a\r\nlumbering vehicle that had seats inside for ourselves, with the luggage\r\nfestooned about the exterior, took us thundering over the rocky, uneven\r\nroad at a fast pace. The driver sat in front and diligently plied a\r\nlong, thin whip that cracked with reports like those of a pistol, but\r\ninflicted little punishment on the mules, while a Quechua boy ran\r\nalongside and encouraged onward the panting animals with ear-splitting\r\nwhistling and volleys of stones. I was never able to understand how\r\nthese urchins could keep up the fast gait maintained by the mules,\r\nand at the same time have sufficient wind left with which to do the\r\nwhistling.\r\n\r\nWithin an hour after leaving Sucre we had reached a point where the\r\nroad ran along the rim of an attractive valley filled with trees,\r\nshrubbery, flowers, and pools; a number of queer structures combining\r\nChinese, Arabian, Greek, and several other styles of architecture, were\r\nscattered about promiscuously and detracted greatly from the natural\r\nbeauty of the spot. This place, known as _El Recreo_ is the property\r\nof a Bolivian woman who calls herself a princess, and who for reasons\r\nunknown to me makes her home in far away Paris.\r\n\r\nSoon after leaving El Recreo with its lovely vegetation and disfiguring\r\nminarets, stained glass, and other hall-marks of poor taste, the large\r\ntown of Yotala was reached. Yotala is well-known throughout Bolivia\r\nfor the excellent quality of the peaches and apricots that are grown\r\nand preserved there; and locally it enjoys the reputation of producing\r\nthe best bread of the vicinity, although I could never agree with the\r\nlatter assertion. The finest bread we had in all Bolivia was prepared\r\nby the hospitable señora living on the banks of the Pilcomayo, and in\r\none of whose huts we resided the following eight days.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour’s halt at a house called Pulqué, where the mules were\r\nfed and watered, and where we refreshed ourselves with weak coffee at\r\nthirty _centavos_ the cup, we resumed the journey, and 3 o’clock P. M.,\r\nfound us on the bank of the great river we had sought--having come a\r\ndistance of nine leagues since 7.30 o’clock that morning.\r\n\r\nThe Pilcomayo at this point varies in width from a few hundred feet\r\nto half a mile, is crossed by a suspension bridge, and flows between\r\nhigh, barren, rocky hills. There was comparatively little water, but\r\nthe current was strong. For me the Pilcomayo possesses an unusual\r\nfascination. While looking at the hurrying, muddy torrent underneath,\r\nI could not help picturing the awe-inspiring stretches of wilderness\r\nthrough which those same waters must flow before mingling with the\r\nless fearsome Paraguay hundreds of miles farther down: little-known\r\nsavages indulging in wild orgies and cannibalistic dances on its\r\nbanks, or paddling silently and mysteriously on its glassy bosom to\r\nsome jungle rendezvous unknown to white men; jaguars eagerly lapping\r\nup a refreshing draft after a gory meal of deer or peccary; myriads\r\nof _pirañas_ lashing its surface into spray in their mad struggles\r\nto tear the flesh off some struggling, despairing victim; lines of\r\ncrocodiles sunning themselves on mud-banks or slowly patrolling the\r\nwater’s edge, like drifting logs, with only the ever-vigilant eyes\r\nshowing the faintest animation; boundless wastes of pestilential\r\nswamps and lagoons, where mosquitoes and other obnoxious insects in\r\nclouds forestall the advent of man, but where millions of egrets,\r\nstorks, cormorants, and other water-loving birds find a safe haven\r\nand lead their wild, joyous lives in blissful ignorance of despoiling\r\nplume-hunters; but, a shout of “_Ya está, señor_,” from the mule-driver\r\nreminded me of the fact that day-dreams must soon end. The man had\r\nunloaded the luggage at a little hut surrounded by shade-trees and\r\nfields of alfalfa. He had been unable to find the owner, but thought\r\nwe could arrange to stay there should that personage appear. Most\r\nimportant of all, he wanted his money--and then he was off with\r\ntwenty-seven miles of up-hill road ahead of him, before reaching Sucre\r\nthat night.\r\n\r\nWhile taking stock of our outfit and arranging it conveniently in the\r\nlittle adobe hovel that was to serve as our home, an elderly Bolivian\r\nwoman came from one of the alfalfa-fields near by, and I rightly\r\nguessed that she was the owner of the property. To my request that we\r\nbe permitted to remain, she promptly replied that she would consider\r\nit an honor to have us do so. I wondered if there are many places in\r\nour own country where courtesy to utter strangers is so universal as\r\nin Spanish America. Frequently, after long and trying journeys afoot\r\nor on mule-back (sometimes of hundreds of miles) our appearance was\r\ndisreputable; but with one or two exceptions only during the entire\r\ncourse of my travels in South America, the kindness and politeness of\r\nthe inhabitants was unfailing. When we left the Pilcomayo, the _señora_\r\naccepted not a cent of payment.\r\n\r\nThe country for many miles about was arid, excepting only the few\r\nirrigated flats near the river where fodder, grain, and vegetables\r\ngrew luxuriantly. Cacti and thorny shrubbery dotted the slopes,\r\nbut even these plants of the dry lands were not abundant. Numerous\r\nsmall streams empty into the river during the wet months; but now\r\n(November) their courses were dry and parched.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rio Cachimayo at Peras Pampa, Sucre.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bridge across the Rio Pilcomayo.]\r\n\r\nBirds were plentiful, but the species varied little from those typical\r\nof the uplands. However, they were nesting and this circumstance\r\nfurnished a new and interesting field for study.\r\n\r\nOne of our first walks took us to an old mill, fallen into decay\r\nthrough neglect. There were hundreds of dollars’ worth of machinery\r\nruined through lack of care and the use of improper lubricants. I have\r\nfrequently seen machinery of various kinds, ranging from typewriters\r\nand sewing-machines to Pelton wheels, seriously damaged because lard\r\nor tallow had been used instead of oil, and the wearing surfaces never\r\ncleaned. In one of the dust chutes a pair of chestnut flycatchers\r\n(_Hirundinea_) had built a flimsy nest of twigs and feathers. It\r\ncontained two cream-colored eggs speckled with red. The birds remained\r\nin the vicinity all day long and paid no attention to the Indians\r\nworking near by, but when a dog chanced to pass they darted at it\r\nfuriously, making quick dashes at its head and snapping their bills\r\nwith a loud, popping noise. Another pair of birds of the same species\r\nhad a nest above the door of a near-by house.\r\n\r\nLeaf-cutting finches also called tooth-billed finches (_Phytotoma_),\r\nwere very abundant. The inhabitants destroyed them whenever possible,\r\nas the birds cut the blossoms off the fruit-trees and grape-vines.\r\nThe bright, saffron-breasted male sat in the top of some thorny bush\r\nand uttered queer, unmusical wails that reminded us of the mewing of\r\na forlorn alley cat, while his gray-and-black-striped mate incubated\r\nthe eggs in a small but compact nest hidden farther down among the\r\nspine-armed branches. We examined numbers of the nests; each one\r\ncontained three eggs of a deep-green color, marked with a few black\r\nlines about the large end.\r\n\r\nOven-birds built their dome-shaped mud nests on fence-posts or the\r\nlarger branches of the few poplar-trees that had been planted about\r\nthe huts for shade, and sang in unison from dawn to dusk as if their\r\nhearts were overflowing with happiness.\r\n\r\nParrakeets had excavated holes in the face of steep banks, and\r\nchattered and quarrelled noisily over their domestic affairs. I suspect\r\nthat they also appropriated the cavities prepared by swallows, as there\r\nseemed to be frequent disputes between these neighbors.\r\n\r\nOf humming-birds there were a number of species, including the giant\r\nhummer, which was truly monarch of all he surveyed, for when one\r\nappeared the smaller members of the group found it advantageous to\r\ndepart to other regions. Doctor Frank M. Chapman, in Chile, saw an\r\nindividual of this species pursue and catch in its claws a small\r\nhumming-bird and fly away with it; for what purpose he did not know,\r\nunless from “sheer cussedness.” It is a well-known fact that hummers\r\npossess a pugnacious disposition, are almost constantly fighting among\r\nthemselves, and frequently pursue and strike at large birds such as\r\nflycatchers and even hawks, apparently for no reason other than the\r\npleasure it affords them to torment their victims.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon we had the first indication of the coming rainy season\r\nin the form of a severe rain and thunder-storm. Before long the river\r\nwas a seething, muddy torrent that continued to rise rapidly until well\r\ninto the night. The next morning the water had subsided to its low\r\nlevel, leaving numbers of fish of several kinds stranded in depressions\r\nin the _playas_. A flock of caracaras appeared with daylight and,\r\nwading daintily into the shallow pools, extracted and devoured the\r\nstranded and helpless fish at their leisure.\r\n\r\nNot long after we were fortunate in meeting an American by the name\r\nof Kolle, who was in the employ of a wealthy Bolivian owning estates\r\nin various parts of the country. To one of these we were subsequently\r\ninvited, but before accepting the invitation of the affluent señor\r\nwe decided to spend a few days at Pulqué where some variation in the\r\navifauna from the upland type had been noticed. We had also seen\r\nnumbers of Quechuas apparently living in much the same manner as their\r\npredecessors during the height of the Inca’s glory.\r\n\r\nAs frequently occurs in semiarid country, and as I have stated before,\r\nbirds were very abundant; but there was little else to indicate the\r\nclose proximity of other forms of life unless one took into account\r\nthe herds of goats clambering about on the steep ledges and seeming\r\nto delight in bombarding with showers of small stones every one who\r\npassed below; or the caravans of burros and llamas passing on the main\r\nhighway. A visit to the nebulous peaks of the adjacent mountains,\r\nhowever, revealed a different story. Patches of green dotted the\r\nisolated little depressions to which the name “valleys” can hardly be\r\ngiven, and thin pillars of smoke ascended from them straight into a\r\ncloudless sky. After long and patient looking a small, stone hut set\r\namong rocks would invariably be discovered, and sometimes we could even\r\ndistinguish minute, moving forms which we knew were Indians. There,\r\ntucked away among the towering peaks they love so well, they were\r\nliving a life of peace and plenty, apparently safe from the gaze of\r\nvulgar interlopers, and knowing or caring little about the outer world.\r\nIt was as if one tore a page from the history of bygone centuries,\r\nor found himself suddenly transferred into the midst of a contented,\r\npastoral community as must have existed in places unnumbered throughout\r\nthe vast Incan Empire before its despoliation by the gold-crazed\r\ninvaders. In this connection it might be well to go back briefly into\r\nthe history of the events that brought about the present state of\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nThe boundaries of the Incan Empire had been gradually extended until\r\nwithin five hundred years after the arrival of Mamo Capac and Mama\r\nOcclo, supposed Children of the Sun, it covered nearly one-third of the\r\nSouth American continent. Near the middle of the sixteenth century,\r\nwhen Pizarro and his insatiable band invaded the sacred precincts of\r\nAtahualpa’s dominion, the star of the Inca seemed to have reached\r\nthe apex of its ascendancy. Under the beneficent rule of their\r\nvenerated sovereign the several tribes lived contentedly, if not always\r\npeaceably; agriculture thrived, arts and crafts were encouraged and,\r\nresponsive to the efforts of many thousands of laborers, numerous mines\r\npoured a constant stream of precious metals into the kingdom, adding to\r\nits wealth and splendor.\r\n\r\nWe are all familiar with accounts of the advanced state of\r\ncivilization, governmental organization, and fabulous riches of the\r\nancient nation. Temples, palaces and forts--stately edifices of hewn\r\nstone--dotted the mountainsides and crowned the eminences; beautifully\r\nconstructed highways connected many of the remote districts with the\r\ncapital; countless herds of llamas fed on the slopes, and streams of\r\nwater flowing through a system of aqueducts poured into the heretofore\r\narid wastes and transferred them into fruitful fields capable of\r\nsupporting a numerous population. The present-day republics of Ecuador,\r\nPeru, Bolivia, as well as a part of Colombia and Chile, were included\r\nwithin the limits of the vast kingdom.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a dark cloud appeared on the horizon, and omens of evil import\r\npresaged the downfall of all this greatness and splendor. The fatal\r\napparition quickly assumed the form of bearded strangers, some of\r\nwhom were mounted on terrible beasts which filled the ranks of Indian\r\nwarriors with panic, and who seemed to have succeeded in harnessing\r\nthe thunder and lightning for the furtherance of their wicked designs.\r\nSuffice it to say, that before the avarice of the Spaniards had\r\nbeen abated, eight million subjects of the Inca perished and the\r\norganization of the nation was destroyed. With the single exception of\r\nthe Aztecs of Mexico, who were practically exterminated by the same\r\npeople, there has never been another example of such rapid and complete\r\ndevastation in the history of the world.\r\n\r\nThe Quechua of to-day is a cowed, almost pathetic, individual; he has\r\nbeen kicked about by the descendants of the _conquistadores_ until he\r\nhas learned to become reconciled to his lot; but while it seems as\r\nif this recognition might, in many instances at least, give way to\r\ndespair, such is not the case.\r\n\r\nThe partiality of the Quechuas for the high _puna_ is well known--some\r\nof the ancient dwellings having been discovered at an elevation of more\r\nthan seventeen thousand feet.\r\n\r\nThose living near Pulqué seldom come down into the lower country;\r\ndoubtless they are happier in their almost inaccessible fastness than\r\nif they lived nearer to their Bolivian neighbors. In appearance and\r\ndress these Indians differ greatly from the other members of the tribe\r\nliving in the more populous sections of the country. Instead of the\r\nmore or less conventional attire adopted by the latter, they still\r\nadhere to a form of dress at least a part of which may date back to\r\nthe time of Atahualpa. The women wear a quantity of clothing--short,\r\nfull skirts of dark blue, and shawls of varied colors. The men are\r\ngarbed in loose, white knee-breeches, a gray or blue shirt, and belts\r\nwhich are neatly embroidered in gay colors and are very wide at the\r\nback so that they form a kind of sash; also, they wear the inevitable\r\n_poncho_. Strange as it may seem, the small children always wear very\r\nlong clothing, and the little girls waddling along in their full,\r\nalmost trailing skirts, resemble dwarfed aged women. All the apparel is\r\nmade of woollen cloth of home manufacture. The men permit their hair\r\nto grow long and braid it in a queue which hangs down the back. Both\r\nsexes use peculiar little hats made of some kind of skin prepared by a\r\nprocess which renders it very hard; this head-gear reminded me of steel\r\nhelmets. With the exception of huge spoon-shaped pins of copper, which\r\nthe women used to fasten their shawls, we saw no metal ornaments or\r\njewelry of any kind.\r\n\r\nThe home life of these Quechuas is tranquil and uneventful. Usually the\r\nlittle stone huts contain two or three rooms; potatoes, avas, and other\r\nproduce are stored in one of them, and the rest are used for cooking\r\nand sleeping-quarters. In very cold weather a fire is kept burning\r\nday and night, and all the occupants of a house burrow deep into a\r\npile of sheepskins and blankets close to the smouldering embers. We\r\npersuaded one of the women to bring goat’s milk to camp each morning,\r\nbut in this we had the greatest difficulty. Only by payment for a\r\nweek’s supply in advance could she be induced to perform this service.\r\nWith past experiences with their fellow countrymen these Indians have\r\nlearned to regard all strangers with apprehension. On several occasions\r\nwe had ample opportunity to observe how the average _paisano_ treats\r\nthe Quechua. Should night overtake him on the trail, he stops at\r\nthe nearest hut and demands food for himself and his horses. In the\r\nevent that the owner has nothing to offer, he draws revolver or rifle\r\nand shoots any fowls that may be running about or, lacking these, a\r\nsheep or goat, and seizes whatever else he can find. Should he see an\r\nattractive blanket, it also is taken. In the morning a few _centavos_\r\nare thrown on the ground and he continues on his journey.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, we found that if these Indians were treated in a\r\nfrank, honest manner they were quite amiable. The little woman we had\r\nengaged to bring us milk trudged down from the mountain-top daily in\r\nfaithful compliance with her obligations. She brought cheese also, and\r\noccasionally a few eggs. As it gradually dawned upon her that we really\r\ncould be trusted, she became talkative and seemed to take an interest\r\nin our occupation. She spoke Quechua only in common with practically\r\nthat entire tribe, which makes no attempt to learn Spanish; or, if they\r\nare able to understand it, will make no effort to speak the language.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Quechua Indians wearing the costume used during the\r\nreign of the Incas, five hundred years ago.]\r\n\r\nUpon seeing a woodpecker we had collected, she gave a sigh of\r\nsatisfaction; for, according to the Indian’s belief, they are birds\r\nof ill omen. If a pair of them make a nest near one of the huts, they\r\nare said to be excavating a tomb for a member of the family who will\r\nsoon die. Oven-birds are looked upon with favor and are encouraged to\r\nremain in the vicinity of the dwellings. Should a pair of the cheery\r\nsingers place their large, domed nest of mud near by, good fortune will\r\nfollow in their wake. Any one guilty of robbing a bird’s nest will\r\nbecome violently ill; but as birds flock to the planted areas in such\r\ngreat bands that an appreciable amount of damage is done to the fruit\r\nand ripening grain, their increase in numbers is discouraged by filling\r\nmany nests with small stones. After the seeds have been planted, a\r\nnetwork of strings is stretched across the fields, and sometimes a\r\ndead hawk suspended from a post in the centre serves as a scarecrow to\r\nfrighten away the marauding visitors. When the crops ripen, a small boy\r\ncalled the “_piscomanchachi_” is stationed in each sector. He is armed\r\nwith a sling and keeps up an incessant fusillade of stones; fortunately\r\nhis aim is poor, but he succeeds in killing a few birds each day.\r\n\r\nThese Quechuas lead a sedentary life. There are no more long, arduous\r\njourneys to far-away Lake Titicaca and Cuzco to participate in solemn\r\nfestivals and gorgeous pageants. Their fields supply potatoes as of\r\nyore, and they still convert the tubers into their beloved _chuño_\r\nby simply allowing them to freeze and dry. From the wheat they have\r\nlearned to cultivate, a splendid quality of bread is made. Their flocks\r\nprovide flesh and milk, and the wool so essential to the preservation\r\nof human life and well-being in the high altitudes. _Tola_ bushes and\r\na peaty growth known as _yareta_ furnish an adequate supply of fuel;\r\nbut should these be lacking, dung is used. The demands of civilization,\r\nhowever, will alter this mode of existence until little remains to\r\nremind us of the contented nation which at one time willingly bowed to\r\nthe rule of the Children of the Sun.\r\n\r\nBirds were not quite so numerous as at the Pilcomayo, but we found\r\nseveral forms new to us. Among them was a large, white-fronted\r\nparrakeet (_Myiopsitta luchsi_) that we saw in no other place. It\r\nbanded in flocks of ten to fifty and seemed to prefer the fruit-trees\r\nnear the house. A species of humming-bird built nests in doorways and\r\nsuspended under the thatched roofs of houses, often in the midst of\r\na colony of swallows (_Atticora_). Tinamou were not uncommon in the\r\ndry ravines and provided a welcome change from the goat-flesh which is\r\nthe staple meat of the people and the only kind we could purchase; the\r\nlatter animals were killed when very young (about the size of a cat),\r\nand we could never become enthusiastic over this, locally considered,\r\ngreat delicacy.\r\n\r\nIn a region such as the country around Pulqué, there are few available\r\nnesting-sites, and nests are very conspicuous objects when placed in\r\na cactus or thorny bush; however, the sharp thorns and spines with\r\nwhich they are surrounded protect them, alike from predatory animals\r\nand humans. The disused mud nests of oven-birds are collected as\r\nneeded and made into a poultice that is supposed to cure stomachache.\r\nJudging by the quantity they gathered, this ailment must be of frequent\r\noccurrence. A bird of the wood-hewer family (_Upucerthia_) excavated\r\nburrows in banks and deposited two white eggs in a small, feather-lined\r\nnest placed in a roomy chamber at the end of the tunnel.\r\n\r\nThe _señora_ at whose _rancho_ we stopped complained that tiger-cats\r\nwere killing her chickens; so one afternoon I set a steel trap at the\r\nbase of a near-by stone wall, baiting it with a dead bird. I had not\r\ngone a dozen paces from the spot when the trap sprung with a loud\r\ntwang, securely imprisoning the much-sought culprit. The cat’s greed\r\nhad overcome its discretion, at which we rejoiced, for it made a\r\ndesirable addition to our collection. On another occasion one of these\r\nbeautiful animals bounded out from under the roots of a huge tree and\r\nseized a bird as I was stooping to pick it up--and made a clean getaway\r\nto its hiding-place with the spoils.\r\n\r\nOur hosts on the Cachimayo were awaiting us, in order that we might\r\nbe present at the ushering in of the “month of baths,” as December is\r\ncalled in this part of Bolivia. Whether or not they thought we were in\r\nneed of the daily ablutions, I am unable to say; but this I do know,\r\nthat we shocked the good people on numerous occasions by having a swim\r\nat every possible opportunity, even if the month was not in keeping\r\nwith local traditions.\r\n\r\nPeras Pampa is an immense estate on both sides of the Cachimayo, and\r\nbut an hour’s trip by motor from Sucre. We spent a delightful ten days\r\namid pleasant surroundings, living in a comfortable bungalow, and\r\npassing the evenings at the _casa grande_ where the elite of Sucre’s\r\nsociety gathered for music, games, and dancing.\r\n\r\nThe grounds were a succession of orchards, fields, and vineyards.\r\nScores of Indians lived and worked on the place, cultivating the\r\nground, building stone fences, and taking care of the stock. At night\r\nthey met and played very well on reed flutes of various sizes, each\r\nmusician taking a separate part, so that the combined effort was\r\nsomewhat like that produced by a well-organized band. Their favorite\r\npiece was “Red-Wing”--apparently learned from a phonograph record.\r\n\r\nThe evening parties were always enjoyable affairs. They began with a\r\nsumptuous dinner--including several kinds of wine; then a series of\r\neight or ten well-chosen courses, followed by liqueurs and smoking. The\r\nwomen did not smoke.\r\n\r\nAfter that there were charades, story-telling, music, singing, dancing,\r\nand perhaps a walk _en masse_ in the moonlit grounds, through arbors\r\nof honeysuckle and other flowering vines and over paths bordered with\r\nhedges of roses. There were always more refreshments just before the\r\nparty broke up at midnight. All the Bolivians we met at Peras Pampa\r\nwere charming, and we heartily regretted that our time for combined\r\nwork and play was not unlimited.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the people who formed the gay evening crowd lived in\r\nseparate cottages on the estate--the guests of the owner. Each day\r\nthey repaired faithfully to the river for a dip, although the water\r\nwas usually very muddy, and there was about an even chance whether one\r\nwould emerge without yesterday’s coat of grime or with an additional\r\none. December is chosen for this purpose because it is the warmest and\r\nmost pleasant month of the year.\r\n\r\nThe time allotted us for work in Bolivia had nearly expired. We had\r\nthoroughly enjoyed our lengthy sojourn in the republic, and look\r\nforward to revisiting it in the future. Our schedule called for rather\r\nextensive work in the Argentine, so, after a great deal of difficulty,\r\nwe succeeded in collecting a caravan of riding and pack mules for\r\nthe ride of over three hundred miles to La Quiaca, on the Argentine\r\nfrontier. Ordinarily the trip from Sucre to La Quiaca should not be\r\nundertaken on mule-back. One should go to Potosi in one day’s time,\r\nutilizing the semiweekly motor-car service. A railroad connects the\r\nlatter place with a small station a few miles this side of Tupiza, and\r\nfrom this point one may reach La Quiaca in two days by carriage. During\r\nthe rainy season, however, both automobile and carriage service are\r\nsuspended; and the difficulty of twice securing mules on which to cover\r\nthe two stretches of road between railway terminals and the delays and\r\nother inconveniences are so great that we decided to travel the entire\r\ndistance with a pack-train. This also gave us an opportunity to see the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe expedition left Sucre December 22. The caravan was appallingly\r\nlarge, for we were taking our entire outfit, and it required no less\r\nthan six Quechuas to look after the mules and burros. All supplies,\r\nalso, had to be taken with us, as very little is to be had from the\r\nIndians, who are virtually the sole inhabitants of the cheerless\r\nhighlands. There are a number of large villages, it is true, but the\r\nperson who relies on the natives for maintenance is as likely as not to\r\nhave to live on coca and _chicha_, or suffer for his improvidence.\r\n\r\nBy noon we had reached the Cachimayo at a point where, ordinarily,\r\nit is fordable; but a heavy rain had caused the river to rise and we\r\nwere confronted by a series of roaring cataracts covered with foam and\r\ndébris washed down from the mountains. The mules were unloaded and\r\ndriven into a corral. Soon other caravans arrived, until there were\r\nseveral hundreds of men and animals gathered on the river-bank. We\r\nspent the afternoon strolling through the adjacent apricot-orchards and\r\nvineyards. The former trees were laden with fruit, all ripening; it\r\nwas small in size, but of delicious flavor. By seven o’clock the water\r\nhad subsided many feet, and one of the _arrieros_ having previously\r\nridden across the river to test its depth, the caravan started across.\r\nThe stream was three hundred feet wide and the current very strong,\r\nso that crossing it seemed an endless operation; the mules struggled\r\nonward gamely, but to the rider it seemed as if they stood stock-still\r\nwhile a maze of rushing water seethed and raged all around him in\r\nfrantic efforts to sweep away everything in its path. Our own animals\r\ngot across safely, although some of the packs were drenched; but a\r\nlong train of burros laden with huge boxes of the popular _Sucrenses_\r\ncigarettes fared badly, and a number of the poor creatures were upset\r\nand whirled away down-stream. We continued onward in the darkness two\r\nleagues to Poste Escalera, a lone hut on a hillside, and spent a trying\r\nnight at this flea-infested post. Next day we reached the Pilcomayo at\r\na point where the river is divided into many narrow channels, although\r\nthere is one main stream spanned by a swaying wooden bridge.\r\n\r\nA detailed narration of each day’s ride would mean the recounting of\r\npractically the same things. There were, however, a few things of\r\nunusual interest, and these will be mentioned later.\r\n\r\nThe country is dry, rolling, and unproductive. In some places there\r\nis a sparse growth of cacti and thorny shrubbery, but vast areas are\r\nrocky and barren of all vegetation. We crossed ridge after ridge,\r\nthe elevation of the trail varying between eight thousand and twelve\r\nthousand feet. Travel in this type of country is most trying. Water is\r\nso scarce that long distances must be covered in order to find suitable\r\ncamping-sites; in one instance we were compelled to ride thirty-six\r\nmiles in the course of a day, between streams. The temperature varies\r\n100° each twenty-four hours. At two in the afternoon the thermometer\r\nregistered 132° F.; at night ice formed on the water in our pails.\r\n\r\nChristmas day was spent at Puno, with every member of the party ill\r\nfrom the effects of the climatical changes. The inhabitants went\r\nabout their occupations as usual, quite ignoring this all-important\r\nopportunity for a _fiesta_.\r\n\r\nAll the dwellings of the Indians were made of adobe. In the walls of\r\nsome of them rows of disused earthenware pots had been used as building\r\nmaterial. When the huts crumbled, a fine collection of pottery was\r\ncovered up in the mound. This is probably an ancient custom and may\r\naccount for much of the material found in old ruins to-day.\r\n\r\nTwo days later, the last of the long, weary miles across the cheerless\r\nupland had been left behind, and at noon we galloped briskly into\r\nVillazón, on the Bolivian side of the border.\r\n\r\nVillazón contains about a score of scattered, low, adobe buildings. We\r\narrived on a Sunday, when the customhouse was closed, but the officials\r\nin charge very courteously permitted us to proceed on our way. A brook\r\nthree or four feet wide separates the two republics and, stepping\r\nacross this, we found ourselves in La Quiaca and--in Argentina.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nBIRD-NESTING IN NORTHWESTERN ARGENTINA\r\n\r\n\r\nLa Quiaca is similar in size and appearance to Villazón. There are a\r\nnumber of stores or trading-posts where miners from the surrounding\r\nmountains secure their outfits and provisions. It is also the terminus\r\nof the railroad from the south. One may go by rail directly to Buenos\r\nAires. The settlement stands on a level, wind-swept plateau, and the\r\nweather was very cold. The neighboring peaks of the Andes are rich in\r\nmines, and multitudes of llamas and mules come down the steep trails\r\neach day, laden with copper, bismuth, silver ore, and gold ore. They\r\ndischarge their burdens at the railroad-station, where it is loaded on\r\ncars to be hauled to the smelters in Buenos Aires.\r\n\r\nOur object in coming to the Argentine was to continue the biological\r\nsurvey we had carried on in Bolivia; and also to secure specimens of\r\na rare little bird (_Scytalopus_) which was thought to exist in the\r\nprovince of Salta. The acquisition of this bird was most important for\r\nthe light it would throw on certain problems of distribution.\r\n\r\nThe little wren-like birds of this genus (_Scytalopus_), known commonly\r\nas “tapacolas,” are perhaps among the most difficult to collect of\r\nany species in South America, and for this reason they are invariably\r\nonly poorly represented in museum collections. Native collectors,\r\nhunting mainly with blow-guns, have gathered many thousands of birds,\r\nthe greater number of which have eventually found their way to\r\nmillinery establishments and scientific institutions in many parts of\r\nthe world; but usually only those of brilliant plumage, and others\r\nwhich could be taken with little difficulty, have been collected. The\r\nsmall, slate-colored or blackish tapacolas, found only in the densest\r\nof subtropical forests or among the tangled vegetation bordering\r\nbleak, frigid _paramos_, have usually been overlooked. This is not\r\nsurprising when we find how seldom even the trained field-naturalist\r\nof to-day finds it possible to lure the tiny, feathered creature from\r\nits secure retreat among the mosses, roots, and ferns to which its\r\nmouse-like habits confine it, and how rarely he succeeds in recovering\r\nthe inconspicuously colored bird after it has been shot. Even after a\r\nlong, patient search has revealed the specimen lodged somewhere in the\r\ndeep stratum of matted plants, it is by no means sure of reaching the\r\nmuseum; I know of instances where birds, slipping from the hunter’s\r\nhands and dropping at his feet, have been forever lost in the riot of\r\nvegetation which everywhere carpets the ground.\r\n\r\nOur quest for this little creature was destined to extend over a period\r\nof months, and to take us into many an out-of-the-way place. We were\r\neager to begin the search, so took the first available train which left\r\nLa Quiaca two days after our arrival and started southward.\r\n\r\nLeaving the desolate settlement, the railroad winds upward through\r\na narrow, rocky gorge to the station Tres Cruces, the altitude of\r\nwhich is twelve thousand four hundred feet. There it descends at a\r\nsteep grade--so steep in fact that a rack and pinion are used part\r\nof the way. The rocky knobs flanking the gorge are old and weathered\r\nand very picturesque. A small stream winds back and forth across a\r\nboulder-strewn course; the water is clear and cold. About mid-afternoon\r\nwe encountered an abrupt change in the type of country. The bare crags\r\nand narrow, rocky floor of the gorge gave way to a wide expanse of\r\nbrush-covered land and green pasture. This change was first noticeable\r\nat a small station called Leon (elevation five thousand feet); the\r\nvegetation grew thicker and the landscape more inviting as we continued\r\nthe journey. At dusk we reached Jujuy, a city of some pretensions;\r\nthe buildings are attractive, the streets are broad, and the people\r\nappeared clean and intelligent. Following Jujuy were numerous small\r\ntowns and stations; also many truck-farms owned by Italians who were\r\nsettling in Argentina in great numbers. There were also vast green\r\nmeadows in which fine-looking cattle, horses, and sheep were grazing.\r\n\r\nOur first stop was at Salta. The journey from La Quiaca had required\r\nfifteen hours.\r\n\r\nSalta has about thirty thousand inhabitants, and is a modern city.\r\nIt possesses wide, paved streets, buildings of imposing dimensions,\r\nelectric trolleys, and lights, a zoological park, good hotels, and\r\na college. The contrast between being in a city where comforts and\r\nluxuries abounded, and living on the bleak, Andean uplands amidst\r\nstolid Quechuas guarding their herds of llamas, was great, and we\r\nenjoyed the change to the fullest extent. After frozen potatoes and\r\ncanned provisions, the inviting coffee-houses were irresistible;\r\nand the “movies” made us forget the miles of inhospitable desert.\r\nFortunately there were enough of each of these attractions so that we\r\ncould spend a whole day visiting them, alternating from one to the\r\nother, without repeating.\r\n\r\nOur first headquarters in the Argentine were made at Rosario de Lerma,\r\none hour by train from Salta. This is a most delightful spot and\r\nafforded rare opportunities for work and observation. The town contains\r\nabout one hundred houses and is surrounded by fields, pastures, and\r\npatches of low, open woods. There is an abundance of water, and\r\nexcellent meat, fruits, and vegetables may be had in abundance.\r\nThe people are industrious and of good appearance, and treated us\r\ncourteously.\r\n\r\nWe soon discovered that in Argentina we were not at liberty to carry\r\non our work in any place or manner that suited our purpose; in other\r\nwords, there were game-laws, closed and open seasons, and it was\r\nnecessary to secure permits from the owners of all lands on which we\r\nproposed to hunt. Of all these restrictions we were ignorant, and\r\nspent a blissful three days doing as we pleased; then a sergeant of\r\npolice called and notified us that we were under arrest, and to call at\r\nheadquarters as soon as convenient. I lost no time in going to see the\r\nchief, explained the nature of our work to him, and then acting on his\r\nsuggestion took the next train to Salta to get a permit which entitled\r\nus to hunt anywhere within that province. All this was accomplished\r\nwithin a few hours. The various officials with whom I came in contact\r\nwere most courteous and obliging.\r\n\r\nOur study of bird-nesting at Rosario de Lerma was confined largely\r\nto observing the parasitic habits of the black cowbird (_Molothrus\r\nb. bonariensis_), referred to by the Spanish-speaking people as the\r\n“tordo.” The bird usually called tordo, however, is a species of\r\noriole, highly esteemed as a cage bird on account of its not unmusical\r\nsinging ability. This bird is of slender, graceful build, about the\r\nsize of a red-winged blackbird, and of a uniform glossy, purplish-black\r\ncolor except on the wings and tail, which have a pronounced greenish\r\nsheen. The female is of a dark, ashy-brown color.\r\n\r\nWe saw flocks of them daily in the fields, on the backs of cattle\r\ngrazing in the pastures, in the courtyards of houses, in corrals, and\r\nmore particularly in the scattered trees, which were almost certain\r\nto contain at least one nest of the oven-bird (_Furnarius_) or of\r\nsome species of brush-bird (_Phacellodomus_). Usually the flocks were\r\ncomposed of from ten to twelve individuals, the bright, glossy males\r\noutnumbering the dull, grayish females in the proportion of four to\r\none. Azara gives the proportion of males to females as ten to one, but\r\nthis disparity is too great for any part of the Argentine known to me.\r\n\r\nThe birds are noisy, keeping up a loud chatter, especially where a\r\nflock is on the wing, or when preparing for the night’s sleep. The male\r\nbursts into a short, pretty song with frequency, dropping his wings and\r\nmoving in a nervous manner while singing. Apparently the female does\r\nnot sing.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the females of this species lay eggs during a\r\nperiod of three or four months; to know how many are laid by a single\r\nbird would be interesting, as the number must be very great in order\r\nto make allowance for the incalculable numbers that are wasted, and\r\nstill provide enough to keep the ranks of the multitudes at their\r\nnormal level.\r\n\r\nWe did not find a single egg of _M. b. bonariensis_ on the ground,\r\nalthough Hudson states that in the vicinity of Buenos Aires these birds\r\n“frequently waste their eggs by dropping them on the ground.”\r\n\r\nDropping the eggs on the ground might entail a deliberate waste, as\r\nwe know of no reason why the bird should suppose that they would be\r\nhatched and the young reared, if scattered broadcast over the country.\r\nOn the other hand, this might merely indicate that the birds had found\r\nno suitable place in which to deposit their eggs. The form of waste\r\ncaused by the birds laying in old, disused nests, or by laying such a\r\nlarge number of eggs in a single nest that it is impossible for the\r\nrightful owner to incubate them and rear the young, can hardly be said\r\nto be deliberate, as it is doubtless caused by a lack of intelligence;\r\nif the bird designedly scatters its eggs broadcast on the ground, it is\r\nwantonly wasteful; if it merely lays in disused nests, or overcrowds\r\nnests actually occupied, the bird may simply be stupid.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to say what per cent of eggs laid by this\r\nspecies of cowbird is wasted. Hudson estimates that each female lays\r\nfrom sixty to one hundred eggs in a single season, and it does not\r\nseem to me that this statement is an exaggeration. One female which\r\nI dissected had laid three eggs within the few preceding days, and a\r\nfourth was almost ready to be deposited.\r\n\r\nThe bird which suffers most from the parasitic habits of the cowbird\r\nin the vicinity of Rosario de Lerma, is the oven-bird (_Furnarius\r\nrufus_); however, of the great number of eggs laid in the nests of the\r\nabove-named species, our observations tend to show that the greater\r\npart are lost. Among the scores of oven-bird nests which we examined,\r\nonly two were still occupied by the owners, the desertion being\r\napparently due to the invasion of the cowbirds. So persecuted were the\r\noven-birds that it is difficult to understand how any of them survived\r\nin this immediate locality. The nests were common enough, it being\r\nnot unusual to find several of them in a single tree, but the birds\r\nthemselves were not abundant. It is possible that some of the pairs\r\nmay have built several nests each in their vain attempts to escape the\r\nattentions of the cowbirds.\r\n\r\nIn no instance had the walls or top of the oven-birds’ nests been\r\nbroken or perforated in any manner, in order that light could\r\npenetrate to the interior; they were not tampered with in any way, and\r\nthe cowbirds seemed content to use them just as the oven-birds had\r\nconstructed them.\r\n\r\nI believe that the greater number of _M. b. bonariensis_ that reach\r\nmaturity are reared by the smaller birds, such as finches, warblers,\r\nand vireos, in whose nests only a few eggs are laid, which increases\r\nthe favorable chances of their incubation. Also, the larger and heavier\r\neggs of the cowbird frequently crush at least a part of the smaller\r\neggs which naturally have a more fragile shell, thus forestalling to a\r\nmarked degree the competition that might arise between the young birds\r\nin the nest.\r\n\r\nWe collected about two hundred eggs of this species, nearly all of\r\nthem at Rosario de Lerma, and a great variation in marking exists;\r\nthere is also some difference in color. As a general rule the eggs are\r\ngreenish or bluish, rather heavily spotted with reddish-brown; in a\r\nvery few specimens the background is of a pale flesh-color, and in a\r\nsmall number of others it approaches white, having, however, a dull\r\ngrayish tinge; of the entire lot, four only are so lightly marked as to\r\nappear unspotted. Not a single egg is pure white or has a pure white\r\nbackground (my standard of comparison is an egg of the oven-bird) “like\r\nthe eggs of birds that breed in dark holes”; the majority of these eggs\r\nwere taken from the darkened interiors of oven-birds’ nests.\r\n\r\nA type of egg not uncommon is heavily and evenly marked all over with\r\nfine dots and larger spots of reddish-brown. Judging from the material\r\nat hand I should say that there is a characteristic type of marking\r\nrunning through the eggs of the species if we except the two extremes,\r\n_viz._, those almost unspotted, and those so entirely covered with\r\nheavy blotches that they appear to be of a uniform chocolate color.\r\n\r\nHowever, the eggs of each individual seem to vary in some respect from\r\nthose of any other, as it is impossible to find two exactly alike in\r\ncomparing series from different places. Frequently, two or more eggs\r\nfound in the same nest resemble each other so closely in size, shape,\r\nand coloration, that I think it reasonably safe to say that they were\r\nlaid by the same bird.\r\n\r\nThe nests of the smaller birds contained from one to four eggs of these\r\nparasites, in addition to those of the rightful owners. On January 12,\r\nI opened an oven-bird nest and was surprised to find fifteen cowbirds’\r\neggs in the dark interior. This I considered a record, but Boyle\r\nbrought one in on the same day containing twenty-six of the speckled\r\neggs. In the days that followed, we discovered numerous “sets” of from\r\nten to twenty. The nest that contained the final record number was\r\nfound January 16, it contained thirty-eight eggs--one of the oven-birds\r\nand thirty-seven of the cowbirds.\r\n\r\nLater, we again met these old acquaintances wintering in the\r\nrice-fields and rush-grown marshes of Tucuman.\r\n\r\nThe white ani (_Guira guira_) or Guiraca, first seen near Asuncion,\r\nand later in Bolivia, was plentiful at Rosario de Lerma. The bird was\r\nusually found in small flocks and fed on the ground.\r\n\r\nWe found several of their nests near Rosario de Lerma. They were large,\r\nloosely built of sticks and placed in the crotch of a cactus or other\r\nthorny plant, at no great height from the ground. However, the nest is\r\nnot conspicuous in spite of its size.\r\n\r\nPablo Girard, an Argentine naturalist, informed me that these birds\r\nfrequently nest in communities and that a number of females lay their\r\neggs in the same nest, although this is not always the case. The\r\nnatives verified this statement. This seems probable as I at no time\r\nsaw the groups split up into pairs; on the contrary, there were always\r\nnumbers of birds in the vicinity of each domicile. Our record set\r\ncontained twelve eggs.\r\n\r\nAfter ten days at Rosario de Lerma, we returned to Salta and then took\r\nthe train to Perico, a ride of three and a half hours northward. At\r\nthis station a branch railroad runs northeastward into Argentina’s\r\nvast Chaco region. The track was being extended as rapidly as labor\r\nand material can be obtained for the work, and we desired to go to the\r\nend of the line where is located a station called Embarcacion. Before\r\nstarting on this journey, however, we spent some time at points noted\r\non the downward journey from La Quiaca. Perico is a busy little town,\r\nowing its activity to the traffic occasioned by the railroad junction.\r\nThe buildings are low and dilapidated, and most of them consist of a\r\nshop, or _venta_, in front, with living-rooms in the rear.\r\n\r\nThe shops are always worthy of exploration. In some, huge piles\r\nof watermelons were displayed for sale; others offered fruits and\r\nvegetables, and still others groceries and dry-goods. Drinking-places\r\nwere abundant.\r\n\r\nWe were particularly interested to find numbers of rhea eggs on sale\r\nin the outdoor market. They brought forty _centavos_ each and were\r\ndelicious; the contents of each was equal to about a dozen hen’s eggs.\r\nI was told that they were gathered from the nests of wild birds in the\r\nChaco. Each nest contains from ten to twenty or even thirty eggs, which\r\nare more than one man can carry. When fresh, the shell is of a deep\r\ncream-color; after incubation has started or if the egg is addled, the\r\ncolor is pale, ashy gray. The birds are killed and eaten--the flesh\r\nresembling that of a goat’s in flavor.\r\n\r\nOne day a number of Indians arrived from San Pedro. They brought huge\r\nbaskets and crates of young amazon parrots. These birds are taken when\r\nvery young from nests placed in the cavities of trees, and are reared\r\nby hand until they are able to eat unaided. Usually two are found in\r\na nest--occasionally three. They also brought a tame coypu rat and\r\nseveral three-banded armadillos.\r\n\r\nPerico is surrounded by miles of cattle lands, light woods, and limited\r\nareas covered with vegetation of a semiarid type. In the latter places\r\nsmall deer or brockets are not uncommon; they hide in the low, thorny\r\ngrowth of Spanish bayonet until one is within a few yards of them, then\r\ndash away at great speed; the inhabitants hunt them with dogs trained\r\nfor the purpose, and rarely fail to bag their quarry, though usually\r\nafter a long chase.\r\n\r\nWe found the coral-billed tinamou not uncommon in the wooded districts.\r\nThey are essentially birds of the tree-covered regions and are\r\ndifficult to secure on account of their terrestrial habits, and also\r\nowing to the fact that they adhere closely to the densest cover. I have\r\non a number of occasions seen captive specimens, but they seem to not\r\ntake kindly to the restricted life of a cage or aviary, and spent most\r\nof the time dashing wildly about, injuring themselves so seriously that\r\nthey did not long survive.\r\n\r\nA number of the birds of this locality are not included in the avifauna\r\nof Rosario de Lerma, but belong to the Chaco type, and I recognized\r\nsome species which were common near Asuncion, Paraguay; among them a\r\nlarge blue jay and a brown-shouldered oriole.\r\n\r\nOur next station was at Volcan. About the only attractive thing about\r\nthis place was a great lake almost entirely surrounded by high hills,\r\nand teeming with water-fowl. The Quechua boy we had brought from\r\nBolivia was the first to find the lake. He rushed back to us excitedly\r\nwith the information that there was a large body of water near by with\r\na huge, white duck on it; he had shot at the queer bird, that had a\r\nblack neck, a number of times but failed to hit it. Fortunate for\r\nall of us that his marksmanship was poor! The “duck” was of course\r\na black-necked swan belonging to the owner of the terrain, and its\r\nuntimely demise would have cost us dearly. There were, however,\r\nhundreds of ducks; teals, ruddies, shovellers, and pintails; also, many\r\ncoots, grebes, and rails.\r\n\r\nThe body of water had an area of over a square mile, and in its edges\r\na tall fringe of cattails grew. Marsh-wrens and military flycatchers\r\nhaunted these swaying green thickets, and grebes stole silently in and\r\nout of their ragged borders. There were many disused nests of coots and\r\nducks; but while making our way through the high, tangled growth we\r\ncame suddenly upon the nest of a giant grebe (_Fulica gigantica_); it\r\nconsisted of a huge mass of reed stems, slightly concave on top, and\r\nextending about a foot above the water; in it were four pointed, brown\r\neggs, heavily dotted with deep brown and black. This was apparently a\r\nsecond clutch, the first, perhaps, having been destroyed. There were\r\nscores of other nests, but all were empty and falling into decay.\r\n\r\nWe spent a busy day tramping about the borders of the hidden lake,\r\nwatching the flocks of coming and departing ducks and bagging such as\r\nwe needed--whenever a duck or cormorant plumped into the water Boyle\r\nswam out and got it; this was risky work that I did not encourage,\r\nas the water was ice cold and many fathoms deep, and the ensnaring\r\nunder-water growths of reeds and cattail stems formed dense, slimy\r\nmasses capable of holding a man who might become entangled in them\r\nuntil he became exhausted and drowned.\r\n\r\nWhile at Volcan we stayed at the house of an Italian trader. He asked\r\nif we had any recent reports of the war, and then expressed the hope\r\nthat it would last years longer, as he owned part interest in a\r\ncopper-mine, and was receiving war prices for the much-needed metal.\r\nWe decided not to accept his hospitality any longer and took the train\r\nto Tilcara. I have often met foreigners in South America (including\r\nsome from the United States) who were representative of anything but\r\nthe better class of citizens of their respective countries; it is\r\nunfortunate that many Latin Americans base their estimate of a people\r\nupon the appearance and doings of these few misguided and objectionable\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ploughing at Rosario de Lerma.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tilcara, showing the stream and valley and the\r\nsnow-capped Andes in the distance.]\r\n\r\nAt Tilcara we lived with another Italian family, but of an entirely\r\ndifferent type. The village, the elevation of which is eight thousand\r\nfeet, stands about half a mile from the railway-station. We were\r\nengaging _peons_ to carry our luggage there when the man stepped up\r\nand offered us the use of part of his humble home, which stood within\r\na hundred feet of the spot. We accepted the invitation, and during our\r\nentire stay were treated with great courtesy.\r\n\r\nThere is a narrow valley between high, rugged, barren peaks, some of\r\nwhich are snow-capped. Parts of the depression are dry and semiarid;\r\nothers, marshy and covered with high, rank grass. Small Indian huts\r\nbuilt of stones or adobe are strewn about, and there are numerous\r\nfields from which the rocks have been gathered through years of effort\r\nso that the land may be cultivated.\r\n\r\nThere were many birds. They represented a fauna intermediate between\r\nthat of the high, cold plateau and that found lower down at Rosario de\r\nLerma. Large red-breasted meadow-larks (_Troupialis_) were common and\r\nalways found in pairs. Of hummers there were numerous kinds, attracted\r\nby clumps of flowering shrubs that grew alongside the fences; the giant\r\nhumming-bird and the gorgeous coppery-tailed comet were particularly\r\nplentiful. The former are very stupid. They came fluttering along like\r\nawkward swallows and often settled comfortably on a branch near to us,\r\nfrom which they would inspect us at their leisure, while they chirped\r\nand darted out the tongue like a snake. One of the comets that we\r\ncollected had eaten quantities of gnats and small ants.\r\n\r\nThe walls of a deserted Quechua hut had been appropriated by a flock\r\nof bay-winged cowbirds (_Molothrus badius_) for their nesting-sites.\r\nDozens of small, round holes penetrated the thick, earthen walls, and\r\nsome of them extended entirely through; the latter were not occupied.\r\nApparently whatever birds had drilled the cavities, frequently\r\nsurprised themselves by emerging suddenly into the daylight they were\r\ntrying to get away from, at the far end of the burrow. However, not\r\nto be discouraged, repeated other attempts were made, some of which\r\nwere successful as the walls varied in thickness. A small, flat nest\r\nof sticks lined with a few feathers comprised the bay-wing’s domicile.\r\nSome of them contained young birds, and one had five eggs in it. The\r\nadult birds always remained in a flock in the vicinity and kept up a\r\nshrill screaming while we were near.\r\n\r\nLarge, blackish rails inhabited the reedy marshes; they came in flocks\r\nto feed in the velvety green islands interspersed among the weed and\r\nwater covered areas. Watching from a concealed position, we could see\r\nthem strut unconcernedly about, flicking their tails over their backs\r\nand jerking their necks and picking up the tiny mollusks and insects\r\nthat were so abundant. When alarmed they craned their necks, looked\r\nabout inquisitively, then gave a few hoarse cackles and ran into the\r\nweeds; within a few moments they returned, one at a time, and at first\r\nslowly and cautiously; but soon, forgetting that danger might lurk\r\nnear by, they rushed for the spots where food was most abundant. Rails\r\nare peculiar and interesting birds. The body is narrow and compressed\r\nlike a flea’s; this enables them to slip through the dense reeds and\r\nwater-plants in which they live. The comparatively long bills make\r\nit possible for them to pick up food in shallow water. Their long,\r\nslender toes, giving the feet a wide spread, make walking on floating\r\nvegetation and soft mud easy; nevertheless, at least some species are\r\ngood swimmers.\r\n\r\nFlocks of night-herons spent the days in a small clump of willows\r\nfringing the marsh. At dusk they grew very active and we could hear\r\nthem croaking from afar. They are splendid eating.\r\n\r\nAs at Pulqué and the Pilcomayo, birds were hard pressed for\r\nnesting-sites. Giant club-cacti apparently were at a premium. The\r\nold, disused nests of brush-birds (_Synallaxis_), or _leñateros_, were\r\ninhabited by mocking-birds which built a nest of their own within\r\nthe huge structure of twigs; and, when the mocking-birds were away,\r\ncowbirds slipped in and deposited a few eggs. One mocking-bird had been\r\nso unwise as to place its nest in a thorny bush covered with dense\r\nfoliage so that it could not be watched from a distance and defended\r\nfrom cowbirds; before the owners were ready to use their new home, it\r\nhad received many visits from the black parasites (_M. b. bonariensis_)\r\nwho left their cards in the shape of fourteen speckled eggs. We\r\ncollected this “set” but have the idea that this only encouraged the\r\ncowbirds to increased efforts.\r\n\r\nThe abundance of ducks in South America in places where one least\r\nexpects to find them, is a source of never-ending surprise. A small\r\nstream flows through the valley at Tilcara. It is nowhere more\r\nthan twenty feet across, and two or three feet deep, but flocks of\r\ngreen-winged teals visited it regularly at dawn and dusk. They swam in\r\nthe rapid water, and then lined up on the rocky bank for a quiet nap.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Tilcara shot many, but others came to the same place\r\ndaily.\r\n\r\nOf mammals there were but few. Cavies, as usual, lived among the\r\nrock piles and in the stone fences, and a few other small rodents\r\ninhabited the grain-fields. One day we secured a fine specimen of\r\nthe rare, elusive yellow cat called _gato pampero_, or pampas-cat.\r\nIt was stealing cautiously along the river-bank; but I am unable to\r\nsay whether it had come in quest of fish or merely for the purpose\r\nof quenching its thirst. Our work in this region being completed, we\r\nreturned to Perico, and prepared for the journey to Embarcacion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nTHE CHACO, SUGAR-PLANTATIONS AND RICE MARSHES--A SEARCH FOR A RARE BIRD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe train for the Chaco left Perico at 9 P. M. It was composed largely\r\nof second-class coaches crowded with immigrants, mostly Italians bound\r\nfor various parts of the great land that is being rapidly thrown open\r\nto colonization. There was, however, also a compartment-car in which we\r\nhad taken the precaution of making a reservation some time in advance.\r\nThe darkness prevented our seeing the landscape through which we\r\npassed, but on our return we noted that there was little change from\r\nthat around Perico as far as San Pedro. There were, however, numerous\r\nfields of sugar-cane, some of very great size. Beyond San Pedro the\r\ncountry is all of the Chaco type; that is, vast stretches of pampas\r\nliberally sprinkled with islands of forest. The Vermejo, a river about\r\nthe size of the Wabash, was crossed on a steel bridge three miles\r\nbefore reaching our destination, which was at six o’clock the following\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nA group of newly erected shacks, low and so lightly built of\r\npacking-cases and corrugated sheet iron that many of them resembled\r\nmere skeletons of houses; narrow, crooked streets; shops loaded with\r\nfruits and conducted by Italians, and others festooned with bandanna\r\nhandkerchiefs, gaudy wearing apparel and cheap jewelry, and owned\r\nby Turks or Syrians; gambling and liquor houses; a motley crowd of\r\nslovenly, not overdressed people, and a tropical sun blazing down\r\nmercilessly on the whole assemblage. That is Embarcacion, the “farthest\r\neast” to date in the north-eastern part of Argentina’s vast Chaco. I\r\nwas told that as the railroad is extended farther and farther into the\r\ninterior, many of the residents take down their abodes and ship them to\r\nthe new station where they are re-assembled; and so a great portion of\r\nthe town moves bodily at different intervals.\r\n\r\nOn all sides lies the seemingly limitless Chaco. There is practically\r\nno cultivation and but few herds of cattle had been introduced to date.\r\nIn addition to the great possibilities for cattle-raising, the country\r\nalso possesses enormous wealth in quebracho-wood; at present quantities\r\nof it are cut for use as fuel in the locomotives of several of the\r\nrailroads. Within a short time, no doubt, these assets will be utilized\r\nin a manner that will be advantageous to both the exploiters and the\r\ncountry at large.\r\n\r\nOne of the interesting discoveries in the pampas was a wintering-place\r\nfor bobolinks. The extent of this bird’s migration had been shrouded\r\nin mystery, and but a single specimen in winter plumage had ever been\r\nrecorded. We found them in flocks of thousands, perched in the top\r\nof the tall grass or picking up seeds from the ground. Their cheery\r\nsong was conspicuously absent. They were in spotted plumage. Small\r\nred-breasted meadow-larks (_Leistes_) mingled freely with the bobolinks.\r\n\r\nAnother place that never failed to attract us was a small lagoon\r\nflanked by forest on two sides, and by prairie on the others. This\r\nregion was the resort of many birds. Flocks of Brazilian cardinals\r\n(_Paroaria_) numbering up to thirty individuals congregated in the\r\nbushes, their flaming red heads reminding one of clusters of brilliant\r\nflowers. We discovered a nest of the species, a shallow affair of grass\r\nstems, placed in the end of a branch twenty feet above the ground;\r\nin it were two eggs resembling those of the English sparrow. Small\r\nblack-and-white flycatchers (_Fluvicola_) found the lagoon a most\r\nattractive spot. Their pear-shaped bag nests of interwoven grasses\r\nand feathers were scattered about in the overhanging bushes and also\r\nfastened to the stems of aquatic plants, sometimes but a foot above\r\nthe water. There were also numbers of grebes, coots, and gallinules,\r\nand occasionally a pair of beautiful Brazilian teals visited the\r\nquiet, secluded body of water. Night-herons kept well to the tops\r\nof the taller trees; and everglade kites flew gracefully and swiftly\r\noverhead, usually singly, and rarely in pairs. We heard the weird call\r\nof chachalacas almost daily, but these birds had been persecuted by\r\nnative hunters until they had acquired enough wisdom to avoid hunters\r\nand human beings in general. In one wet strip of woods we found\r\nlimpkins in limited numbers. They did not seem to ever come out into\r\nthe open country. There was not time to study the frogs, fish, and\r\nsmall snakes that we saw occasionally; nor to more than admire the\r\nmyriads of flowers and curious plants growing on all sides. There was,\r\nhowever, another naturalist (José Steinbach) working in the locality\r\nat the time of our visit, and fortunately he devoted practically all\r\nhis energies to the study of the very things we had to omit, so between\r\nboth expeditions the fauna and flora were pretty well covered.\r\n\r\nMany of the available trees were burdened with the huge stick nests\r\nof the leñateros (_Synallaxis_). Some of the structures measured six\r\nfeet long and two feet through. They were built of thorny twigs, at the\r\nends of branches. A heap of material is first placed at the very tip of\r\na limb, and as the weight causes it to sag downward, more sticks are\r\nadded until the huge mass hangs suspended in a vertical position. The\r\nthorns cause the whole affair to hold together so well that opossums\r\nand other predatory animals find it impossible to burrow their way\r\nthrough the walls to the interior cavity where the four or five white\r\neggs, or the young birds, are cleverly concealed in a downy cup. There\r\nis usually a second chamber near the top of the nest; this is the male\r\nbird’s night quarters while his mate is incubating or brooding in the\r\nlower story.\r\n\r\nBlue-headed tanagers (_Thraupis_) preferred to nest in the trees and\r\nbushes near to some human habitation, while blue grosbeaks selected\r\nmore secluded sites in some little woods or thickets. The latter birds\r\nbreed before the male changes his brown nestling plumage to the deep\r\nindigo-blue coat of the adult.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The lagoon in the Chaco, Embarcacion.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Paramo above Tafí.]\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful of all South American birds’ eggs are laid by the\r\ntinamou. They are placed in a depression in the ground, usually under\r\na tuft of grass or near a log or stone. Their color varies in the\r\ndifferent species, running through turquoise and deep blue, lavender,\r\nbrown, green, and gold. The shape is rounded or broadly ovate and\r\nthe shell is very smooth so that it glows like a varnished or highly\r\npolished sphere. In spite of the glossy texture of the surface, minute\r\nscrutiny will reveal the fact that it is pitted like that of the eggs\r\nof the rhea to which the tinamou are closely related.\r\n\r\nWe saw a fox occasionally, slinking across a trail and always well out\r\nof gun-range. Each morning there were tracks of cats and large cavies\r\nin the dusty paths, but mammals were scarce and few came to our traps.\r\n\r\nThere were no mosquitoes during the day, and only enough at night to\r\nmake the use of a net desirable. Sand-flies, however, often appeared in\r\nconsiderable numbers and were troublesome. The climate was intolerably\r\nhot during the greater part of our stay. Each day the thermometer rose\r\na few degrees higher until we found even the lightest and scantiest\r\namount of clothing uncomfortable; all through the long afternoons we\r\nsat shirtless with streams of perspiration pouring down our backs,\r\npreparing the specimens that spoiled within a few hours unless properly\r\npreserved. About every fourth or fifth day the weather broke and a\r\ndeluge of rain falling throughout the afternoon and night brought with\r\nit a lowered temperature and welcome respite from the oppressive heat.\r\n\r\nOur greatest problem was dealing with the hosts of small red ants\r\nthat persisted in getting at our specimens. We kept the latter on a\r\ntable the legs of which stood in tin cans half full of kerosene; but a\r\ntrailing thread, a piece of paper blown by the wind, or any one of a\r\ndozen other trivial things that happened daily furnished bridges over\r\nwhich the insatiable hordes promptly swarmed to destroy our hard-gotten\r\ntrophies.\r\n\r\nWe next headed toward Tucuman and upon our arrival there were\r\npleased to find a city of sixty thousand inhabitants, delightful\r\nfrom practically every point of view. The people were particularly\r\ninteresting. We saw few of them on the streets during the daytime,\r\nbut in the late afternoon after the shops and offices had closed and\r\nbolted their doors, the men appeared in crowds, all well and neatly\r\ndressed. They congregated in the saloons and cafés fringing the plaza,\r\nand drank beer and small cups of strong, black coffee until about\r\nseven o’clock. In many instances the tables were arranged on both\r\nsides of the pavement so that one walked through a lane between rows\r\nof sleek-combed youths twirling gaudily banded straw hats or canes,\r\nand noisily discussing--what-not, and grave-faced men with gray hair\r\nand beards everlastingly talking politics. After going home to supper\r\nthey reappeared with the womenfolk, the wealthier ones circling about\r\nthe plaza in carriages or motor-cars, the less opulent afoot. The band\r\nplayed every other night.\r\n\r\nThe great Province of Tucuman, of which the city bearing the same\r\nname is the capital, is one of the most fertile in all Argentina.\r\nIts principal products are sugar, rice, and cattle. Land values are\r\nhigh--too high in some cases, but it cannot be denied that there is\r\ngood reason for the rapidly rising scale of prices.\r\n\r\nIn Tucuman we found the chief of police a hard proposition to handle\r\nwhen it came to securing the hunting-license. To begin with, we had\r\ngreat difficulty in entering his sanctuary. The door was guarded\r\nby a mammoth negro who rushed into the inner chamber each time the\r\n_intendente_ rang for him. First he always jerked a huge club out from\r\nunder his coat--ready perhaps to take the first whack at the official\r\nif some one started anything, instead of defending him. Finally we\r\nsucceeded in entering the holy of holies, and found a small, rather\r\nelderly man sitting behind a large, flat desk, sipping tea while\r\nseveral _secretarios_ hopped wildly about him and yelled into an\r\near-trumpet held in position by one of his hands. He failed utterly to\r\nunderstand our request, and curtly refused to have anything to do with\r\nany _millinery establishment_. We argued in vain, then retired to think\r\nof some new move, for the permit was necessary if we wished to keep out\r\nof jail, and I must admit that such was our ardent desire.\r\n\r\nThere being no United States Consul in Tucuman, I appealed to the\r\nBritish Consul for assistance. He very kindly spent many hours calling\r\non various officials, from the governor down, explaining our mission\r\nand asking that the small matter be arranged for us. Our quest seemed\r\nhopeless until one day a copy of one of the large daily newspapers\r\narrived from Buenos Aires, and in this I found an account of how\r\nrepresentatives of Latin-American countries who were attending the\r\nscientific congress in Washington had been received and entertained at\r\nthe American Museum of Natural History during their visit to New York.\r\nArmed with this clipping I again invaded the _palacio_. Ordinarily I\r\nshould not have done such a thing, as there are many reasons why it\r\nis not commendable, but the situation was desperate and called for\r\naggressive tactics. Suffice it to say that this visit was the last. A\r\nmild comparison of how their people were treated in our country, and\r\nthe difficulties we had in theirs was sufficient, and when I left the\r\nbuilding the permit was in my pocket.\r\n\r\nThe Sierra de Tucuman, a range of comparatively low mountains, rises\r\ndirectly west of the city. This we found to be covered with a growth\r\nof tall, dense forest, so we lost no time in moving there. We left the\r\ncity by rail and proceeded southwestward to a small station called San\r\nPablo, a short distance away. This is in the heart of the sugar region\r\nand vast fields of cane stretch on either side of the railway. Here and\r\nthere the tall brick chimneys of a refinery rise above the waving green\r\nfields, and wide, deep canals divide the cultivated areas into sections\r\nand supply water for irrigation.\r\n\r\nA good cart-road leads from San Pablo up the side of the mountain to\r\nthe very summit, four thousand six hundred feet high, where the little\r\ntown of Villa Nougués is situated. This settlement is a favorite resort\r\nof the wealthier class of people who come up from Tucuman to spend the\r\nsummer months in pleasant châteaux, thereby avoiding the heat of the\r\nlower country.\r\n\r\nThe view from the top of the range is superb; the country to the east\r\nis perfectly level, and is laid out in symmetrical fields of cane as\r\nfar as the eye can see. A small, muddy river, threading its way through\r\nthe ocean of green divides it into two sections and vanishes into the\r\nhorizon in a haze of purple mist. To the west stands the stern Andean\r\nchain, barren and precipitous, its summit hidden in banks of cold, gray\r\nclouds.\r\n\r\nWe made a first camp in the forest below Villa Nougués, at an altitude\r\nof four thousand feet. From the very first day we had heard the shrill\r\nlittle call of a bird which we attributed to the much-coveted tapacola\r\n(_Scytalopus_) we were looking for; but the elusive creature always\r\nremained in concealment among the ferns and mosses and not once did we\r\nget a glimpse of it. Then we secured ox-carts and moved to the other\r\nside of the mountain, where, we were told, hunting was not so difficult.\r\n\r\nBirds were not abundant, the fall migrations having left the forest\r\nalmost deserted. The few species which remained, however, such as\r\nwood-hewers, thrushes, tanagers, and jays, were plentiful, and\r\nseveral kinds of humming-birds added life and color to the sombre\r\ngreen of the vegetation. After many days we succeeded in tracing\r\nthe mysterious chirp to its source, and found, not the bird we were\r\nseeking, but a dainty little wood-wren of the shyest possible nature.\r\nThe minute, secretive creature seemed to spend its entire time among\r\nthe buttresses, roots, and moss-draped undergrowth, where no ray of\r\nsunlight ever penetrated to dispel the chill and semidarkness, or give\r\na touch of warmth to the soggy mould. Its glimpses of daylight must\r\nbe brief indeed, and at infrequent intervals. We had come to the\r\nmountains in a state of enthusiasm and expectancy, for here it seemed\r\nwe should succeed in ending our long quest for the tapacola. As the\r\ndays passed, thrilling excitement gave way to exasperation, and finally\r\ndisappointment alone remained to fill the void created by the flight of\r\nthe other emotions.\r\n\r\nWe returned to Tucuman for a brief time, and then struck for the forest\r\nfarther south. This time we left the railroad at a station called\r\nAcherál two and one-half hours from Tucuman, and camped in the forest\r\nat the foot of the ridge. Again we were doomed to disappointment. Birds\r\nwere more abundant than at Villa Nougués, but the tapacola was not\r\nforthcoming. There were, however, numerous other interesting species.\r\nPigmy woodpeckers (_Picumnus_) selected the patches of high brush and\r\nsecond-growth woods just without the edge of the forest proper. They\r\nare little larger than a good-sized humming-bird, dark or black above,\r\nwhite underneath, and have a red cap. Their industrious hammering\r\nalways advertised the presence of a pair as they hopped quickly along\r\nthe trunks and branches, tapping for worms or excavating a nesting-site.\r\n\r\nThe woods were undermined with tunnels made by the queer _tuco-tuco_,\r\nor _oculto_ (_Ctenomys_), a species of which we had come in contact\r\nwith in Brazil. We set a steel trap in one of the subterranean runways,\r\ncarefully covering with a log the opening we had made; soon a series of\r\nlow grunts emanated from the spot, and we found a fine, large specimen\r\nof the strange rodent safely held by the steel jaws.\r\n\r\nBottle flies were so numerous as to prove a most disagreeable pest.\r\nBlankets, clothing, food, and specimens alike were covered with “blow”\r\nif left exposed for but a few minutes. We were lucky in possessing\r\nenough netting with which to rig up covers for everything, but even\r\nthen numbers gained entrance, and we had to clean the infested articles\r\nfrequently by passing them over a fire or by scraping and brushing.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days we concluded that a visit to the top of the range,\r\nwhich at this point attains an altitude of over ten thousand feet,\r\nwas necessary. We secured a pack-train of mules from Acherál, and one\r\nmorning at one o’clock started up the steep slope. A full moon showered\r\na flood of light upon the earth, but the overhanging branches formed\r\na thick canopy over the trail, impermeable to the silvery radiance\r\nsave when an occasional breeze stirred the leafy arch, thus permitting\r\nfitful shafts of light to pierce the darkness of the tunnel, and to\r\nfall in quavering, dancing blotches on the ground. We could almost feel\r\nthe impenetrable blackness which closed in from all sides like water\r\nin a deep, dark pool. The light touch of a streamer dangling from the\r\nmoss-festooned branches overhead, or the velvety swish of fern leaves\r\nprotruding beyond the protecting walls of tree-trunks, made it seem as\r\nif the forest were peopled with hovering, invisible forms. No sound\r\ndisturbed the brooding silence of the night except the dull hoof-beats\r\nof the mules as, guided by some mysterious instinct, they cautiously\r\npicked their way through the muddy and rock-strewn lane.\r\n\r\nHour after hour we followed blindly in the wake of the bell-mule,\r\nwinding back and forth along the mountainside, but mounting ever\r\nupward. The latter part of the way seemed to lie near the course of a\r\nsmall mountain torrent, for we were almost constantly within hearing\r\ndistance of rushing water. Finally, we emerged from the forest, and,\r\njust as day was breaking, reached a brush-covered strip of country, the\r\nelevation of which is five thousand feet. This continued to the top\r\nof the ridge, two thousand feet above. Then there was a depression of\r\nconsiderable extent, filled with rank, low vegetation and infested with\r\nswarms of bloodthirsty flies which render it uninhabitable.\r\n\r\nAfter ascending another ridge, the trail led gently downward into a\r\nlevel valley a dozen miles long and from one to two miles wide. Herds\r\nof cattle were grazing on the abundant grass; a few small areas had\r\nbeen enclosed within stone walls and planted in maize; and at the far\r\nend, half concealed by willows and fruit-trees, lay a village of\r\nwhitewashed houses. At half past four in the afternoon we reached the\r\nsettlement, called Tafí del Valle, and soon after were comfortably\r\nensconced in a hut hospitably provided by one of the inhabitants. After\r\nthe fifteen and a half hours’ uninterrupted ride over a difficult trail\r\nwe were ready for a journey into a still more remote region, and the\r\nsun was shining brightly the following morning when we again returned\r\nto the stern realities of this world.\r\n\r\nTafí del Valle is a most delightful place. Even though the altitude\r\nis seven thousand feet, the surrounding peaks shut in the valley and\r\nprotect it from the icy winds. There is no natural forest in this\r\nregion, but groves of willows have been planted near the houses; to\r\nthese, large numbers of birds came to spend the night. Hawks were\r\nespecially abundant and of many kinds--we collected no fewer than\r\nseventeen species during our ten days’ stay; then there were also\r\nburrowing owls, larks, flycatchers, thrushes, and many other birds.\r\nSome species which ordinarily live in brush-covered country had\r\nbecome adapted to their barren surroundings and were nesting in holes\r\nexcavated in banks of earth. When the birds had reared their broods,\r\nrats, mice, and pigmy opossums occupied the old nesting-sites.\r\n\r\nA clear, cold stream, which flows through one side of the valley,\r\nspreads out at the lower end over a large area, forming lagoons and\r\nmarshes. Geese, ducks, coots, night-herons, and sandpipers made these\r\nplaces a favorite resort. Pectoral sandpipers were not uncommon, and\r\nwere so fat that they were unable to fly and could be taken with the\r\nhands. There were also flocks of stilts; they are beautiful creatures,\r\neither when flying in compact formation, with measured wing-beats\r\nand outstretched necks and legs, or when standing motionless in the\r\nshallow water, their snowy underparts reflected in quivering outlines.\r\nLapwings screamed and cackled in resentment of our visit and frequently\r\nfrightened away flocks of water-fowl which we were stalking.\r\n\r\nApparently our _Scytalopus_ was not a bird of the open highlands. We\r\neven began to wonder if it existed at all, because, so far, the most\r\nthorough search had failed to reveal any trace of it. There remained,\r\nhowever, the high _paramo_ above, and to this we next turned our\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nOur sudden arrival at Tafí had caused much comment among the\r\ninhabitants. They found it impossible to believe that we had come\r\nto that remote region in search of a small, dull-colored bird, and\r\nafter a few days it became an open secret that we were regarded\r\nas spies--though just what nature of information we sought, could\r\nnot be determined. They even went so far as to refer to the matter\r\noccasionally in a good-natured manner; and when we were away on hunting\r\nexcursions, it was their custom to put our cook, a Bolivian, through\r\na sort of “third degree” in an effort to compel him to confess the\r\nreal object of our visit. Therefore, when we planned to move to the\r\nhigh peaks bordering the little valley, the natives considered their\r\nevidence complete; we were going, they said, to prepare a diagram of\r\nthe country from our new point of vantage. The only person who really\r\nunderstood the purpose of our mission was a man from Tucuman who had\r\nbeen sent up to vaccinate the Indians. He started out each morning\r\naccompanied by two or three soldiers, rounded up all the Indians of\r\na given locality, and vaccinated them. The natives did not at the\r\ntime realize the significance of this act; but when, a few weeks\r\nlater, the inoculations had had time to become effective, they grew\r\nfrantic, and grim-faced little parties began to scour the country in\r\nsearch of the person who had “poisoned” them. Fortunately, none of the\r\nscouting-parties came our way, for to them all strangers look very much\r\nalike, and there was the possibility that one of us might have been\r\nmistaken for the doctor.\r\n\r\nThe _paramo_ above Tafí is a bleak region, almost perpetually enveloped\r\nin mist. Work in this type of country possesses its disadvantages, for\r\nin addition to the intense cold and the lack of fuel, there is always\r\nthe possibility that one may be trapped far from camp by banks of\r\nclouds which roll in unexpectedly! The cold, penetrating mist is so\r\ndense that it is impossible to distinguish objects but a few yards\r\naway, and the most familiar landmarks assume strange and fantastic\r\noutlines. In the event that one is overtaken by this phenomenon, there\r\nis nothing to do but wait until the mist lifts, which may be in a\r\nfew hours, or perhaps, not until the next day. Strange to say, the\r\ninhospitable _paramo_ supports a varied fauna. Herds of wary guanacos\r\nfeed on the tall, wiry grass growing in the more sheltered places; when\r\nalarmed, they flee to the inaccessible rocky slopes. The _paja_, or\r\ngrass, harbors also a species of large tinamou, but the bird is loath\r\nto leave its safe cover, for no sooner does it take wing than hawks,\r\nwhich are always hovering about, swoop down and carry it away.\r\n\r\nNumbers of deep ravines have been worn in the mountainsides by water\r\ncoming from the melting snows on the higher peaks. These are filled\r\nwith a rank growth of shrubbery. The sides are so abrupt that we could\r\nfind no spot where a descent was possible without the aid of a thousand\r\nfeet or more of rope. After a number of days, however, a narrow fissure\r\nwas discovered leading to one of the ravines from which came faint\r\nbird-calls that we at once recognized with a fair degree of certainty.\r\nOn account of the high altitude and tangled plant-life it was slow,\r\ntiring work to follow along the bottom of the jagged gash; there was\r\nalso the unpleasant possibility of breaking through the matted brush\r\nand falling into deep crevices among the rocks.\r\n\r\nAs we struggled along slowly, high-pitched, whistling calls rang clear\r\nand loud from numerous places near by, but still it seemed as if our\r\nefforts might be of no avail; for among that chaos of vegetation it was\r\nimpossible to move without causing great disturbance and frightening\r\nthe birds away. Then there recurred to us the old saying about Mahomet\r\nand the mountain and we resorted to quiet concealment.\r\n\r\nPresently there was a crisp little chirp and a rustle among the\r\nmosses a few yards away; one, two, five minutes passed; then a minute,\r\nshadowy form darted out of the darkness, perched on a moss-covered\r\nboulder, and turned a pair of bright, inquisitive eyes upon the strange\r\nmonsters which had invaded its snug retreat. The white throat gleamed\r\nconspicuously among the deep-green surroundings as the bird paused a\r\nmoment to complete its inspection; then up went the short, barred tail,\r\nstraight into the air, and a succession of low, scolding notes emanated\r\nfrom the feathered mite as it hopped about in angry excitement.\r\n\r\nWe found that the bird existed in numbers; once we had discovered a\r\nway of entering its stronghold, it was possible to make the desired\r\nstudies. Thus our difficult search, covering so many hundreds of miles,\r\ncame to a pleasant and successful close.\r\n\r\nOur work in the Argentine, however, was by no means completed. After\r\na short return trip to our base, we went some distance farther south\r\nto Aguilares, a village similar to San Pablo and Acherál. Persimmons\r\nand tangerines were in season, and at each station women came to the\r\ncar-windows offering great bunches of the fruit for sale. The former\r\nwere most attractive while on the trees; they were as large as a hen’s\r\negg, of a deep-red color, and were evenly distributed among the dense,\r\ngreen foliage. The flavor of both was excellent.\r\n\r\nWithin an hour after reaching Aguilares we had been invited to visit\r\nthe estate of a wealthy rice-grower named Da Costa, and soon after\r\nwe were on our way, his son taking us there in a carriage while\r\nthe luggage went in a cart. At the ranch we found a large, rather\r\ndilapidated house occupied by the family of the caretaker. On one\r\nside were great rice-fields; on the other, totora marshes, pastures,\r\nand woods. The place was most attractive, and the people altogether\r\ndelightful, so that we spent over two weeks busily engrossed in the\r\nabundant work at hand.\r\n\r\nThe marshes covered many acres and were filled with cattails except\r\nfor a few narrow lanes of open water. Coypu rats had their runways\r\ncrisscrossing in every direction--sometimes neat, rounded tunnels\r\nwith the bottom just under water, and again, wide trails where the\r\nvegetation had been trampled down. They look like very large musk-rats\r\nand their skins, known commercially as _nutria_, are exported by\r\nhundreds of thousands each year to be manufactured into felt hats of\r\nthe better quality. We caught several that gnawed down all the stalks\r\nwithin reach and piled them into neat islands on which to sit. They\r\nfeigned death until touched with a stick when they attempted to bite\r\nand fought viciously. Jumping mice and large, light-brown, woolly rats\r\nused the same paths as their bigger relatives. One afternoon a fine\r\nindividual of the great red wolf we had secured at Corumbá appeared at\r\nthe edge of the rushes for a moment only to vanish into the dark marsh\r\nat our first movement; a few minutes later he was seen loping into the\r\nbrush several hundreds of yards away.\r\n\r\nDucks came to the region daily, mostly teals and rosy-bills, but in\r\nsmall numbers only. They were hard to get, as wading in the waist-deep,\r\nice-cold water and mud was slow work and they invariably took warning\r\nand left while still out of range. At night flocks of painted snipe\r\n(_Rostratula_) ventured to the open borders to feed. While we were\r\nquietly waiting, a dusky form appeared and began to probe the mud\r\nfrantically, to be joined by others in a short time. They skipped\r\nabout on the flats adjoining the reed-beds in a most erratic manner,\r\nreminding one of the actions of water-beetles, and upon the first sign\r\nof danger promptly disappeared in the labyrinth of stems and grasses.\r\nThey seldom took wing, and then it was but to flutter up above the\r\ntallest reeds and immediately drop out of sight in the thick cover.\r\n\r\nIt is to this region of dense totara marshes that the cowbirds\r\nrevert to spend the winter season, arriving from all directions in\r\ncomparatively small flocks, but increasing in numbers until there are\r\ntens of thousands.\r\n\r\nAs the rice was ripening about this time, the birds did an enormous\r\namount of damage. All day long, men on horseback rode back and forth\r\nthrough the fields, armed with slings and a bag full of pebbles; they\r\nhurled stones and shouted themselves hoarse in a vain endeavor to\r\nfrighten away the marauding hosts.\r\n\r\nThe birds, in bands of a few individuals to several hundred, arrived\r\neach morning at daybreak, flying low and swiftly, and making a\r\n“swishing” sound as they cut through the air. When immediately over the\r\nrice-fields, the band would suddenly swerve as if to circle, but drop\r\nalmost instantly and eat greedily without a moment’s delay. Upon seeing\r\na flock approach, the men threw stones and shouted, often succeeding in\r\nmaking it pass straight over or leave the vicinity after circling once\r\nor twice. Should the birds alight, the hail of stones soon put them\r\nto rout, but not until a few grains of the much-coveted rice had been\r\nsecured by each individual.\r\n\r\nAs the day advanced the birds spread out over the surrounding country\r\nwhere they were not persecuted, and spent most of the time on the\r\nground near the cattle and horses, often perched on the backs of the\r\ngrazing animals. At nightfall they returned to the cattails, and in\r\npassing over the rice-fields again took toll from the planters. The\r\nflocks in the marshes assumed tremendous proportions, and the babble of\r\nvoices resembled a rushing wind; the roar of wings, if the masses were\r\nsuddenly startled by the report of a gun, was not unlike the roll of\r\ndistant thunder. Before finally settling down for the night they spent\r\nsome time hopping about on the mud-flats and eating minute animal and\r\nvegetable matter.\r\n\r\nCarlos S. Reed, F. Z. S., Director of the Natural History Museum,\r\nMendoza, Argentine Republic, gives the results of his investigations\r\nas to the food of _Molothrus bonariensis_ in a paper in the _Revista\r\nChilena de Historia Natural_, año XVII, No. 3, 1913. The following is a\r\ntranslation, as literal as possible, of a part of the original paper,\r\nwhich is written in Spanish:\r\n\r\n“In the summer of 1910 there occurred in various departments of\r\nthe Province of Mendoza, a great invasion of _Isocas_ (larvæ of a\r\nlepidopteran) and in various inspections which I realized in the\r\ninfected countryside I was able to confirm that a number of birds\r\noccupied themselves in eating the larvæ and adults of these _Isocas_\r\n(_Colias lesbia_ Fabr.) and among them _Molothrus bonariensis_\r\npredominated.\r\n\r\n“It is also a voracious destroyer of the white worm (larva of _Ligyrus\r\nbidentulus_ Fairm.) when these are exposed in ploughing furrows in the\r\nvineyards. The ‘_bicho de cesto_’ (_Æceticus platensis_ Berg) is also\r\nvery much persecuted by the bird with which we are occupied.\r\n\r\n“The corn-fields suffer damages by reason of _Molothrus bonariensis_,\r\nbut only during the period between the beginning of the ripening of the\r\near and its collection; certainly, one ought not to take this damage\r\ninto consideration when, during eleven months, _Molothrus bonariensis_\r\nhas fed in the cultivated country on other products, not on maize, and\r\namong these has predominated the larva of _Chloridea armigera_, the\r\nmost formidable enemy of the maize-fields.\r\n\r\n“I have examined the stomach contents of more than sixty specimens\r\nof _Molothrus bonariensis_, freshly shot, in the various seasons and\r\nhave encountered about 90 per cent of substance of animal origin and\r\nthe rest grains, principally maize, but the maize they have generally\r\nobtained from the offal of horses and mules, as in Mendoza a good deal\r\nof maize is given to working animals, and, as the grain is fed entire,\r\na goodly percentage of it is eliminated without having been digested.\r\nIt is for this reason that one frequently finds this bird scratching\r\namong and turning over the offal. This custom is why it has been given\r\nthe name of _virabosta_ in Brazil. Therefore, _Molothrus bonariensis_\r\nmay be looked upon as a bird helpful rather than destructive to\r\nagriculture.”\r\n\r\nRice is planted in “boxes” about twenty-five feet square. Water is\r\nsupplied through a system of canals some of which are many miles long,\r\nand its level is regulated by sets of locks and gates. A few of the\r\nfields had already been cut over and the sheaves piled in stacks to\r\ndry. Small rodents--rats and mice--were so numerous that they worked\r\ngreat havoc. We ran over our traps thrice daily and always found all of\r\nthem filled. At dusk short-eared owls came to the vicinity and perched\r\non the mounds from which they could swoop down and capture the mice\r\nthat teemed in the stubble below. I fired several heavy charges of shot\r\nat these birds one evening, and the weather being clear and quiet,\r\nthe sound carried to the village about a mile and a half away. Early\r\nnext morning a police sergeant rode up and informed us that we were\r\nunder arrest. We thanked him for the information, and he left while\r\nwe went on with our work. At noon another orderly came to repeat the\r\nmessage of the first, and to add that we were expected to report at the\r\npolice-station immediately. The next day we went to see what all the\r\ntrouble was about. The “jefe” was waiting for us at the entrance to the\r\njail, surrounded by a curious audience of townspeople. He looked sad,\r\ngrave, and offended as he began: _“Señores_, I heard five shots night\r\nbefore last.” “Yes, _señor_,” I interrupted, “I fired at least eight or\r\nten.” “_Pues_, that is absolutely prohibited here; one may not shoot\r\nunder any circumstances whatsoever, so I am compelled to place you in\r\nconfinement.” At this part of the proceedings I merely flashed our\r\npermit and asked him why the governor of the province should give out\r\nsuch a document, and charge two _pesos_ for it, if one could not hunt\r\nunder any circumstances. He was taken completely by surprise and did\r\nnot know what to say, so we wished him good morning and went home, much\r\nto the amusement of the crowd which had a good laugh at the _jefe’s_\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nThe Argentinians are inveterate drinkers of _maté_. It is taken from\r\na _bombilla_, as in Paraguay, and all classes of people indulge in\r\nthe habit. I heard that a law had recently been passed requiring each\r\nperson to use an individual tube as the old system of everybody’s\r\nusing the same one indiscriminately had caused the spread of various\r\ndiseases, among them cancer of the mouth, at an alarming rate. Our\r\ngood friends at Los Sarmientos were very fond of their daily brew, and\r\nusually took nothing else for breakfast. They at first very generously\r\npassed the steaming bowl to us, but soon grew accustomed to our\r\nrefusals and refrained from extending further invitations to drink.\r\n\r\nThe weather grew rapidly colder and rain or snow fell almost daily. A\r\nmantle of white completely covered the Andes stretching in an unbroken\r\nrange to the west of us; the picture presented in the early mornings\r\nwas one of great beauty, as the sun lit up the snowy summits with a\r\nrosy light, while a thin bank of purplish vapor enveloped the foot of\r\nthe range in a soft mantle of regal splendor.\r\n\r\nHunting in the marshes grew most difficult on account of the cold,\r\nand the thin ice through which we had to crunch to reach the better\r\ncollecting-grounds. We therefore decided to seek a friendlier clime,\r\nand returned to Tucuman to prepare for a visit to the desert regions of\r\nSantiago del Estero.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nVIZCACHA-HUNTING IN AN ARGENTINE DESERT--GIANT SNAKES\r\n\r\n\r\nOur stay in Tucuman lasted but a few days. During this time our\r\nQuechua boy, who had been with us constantly since our first arrival\r\nin Cochabamba, spent most of his time at the zoological park. The\r\nlions, the tigers, even the camels did not interest him greatly; but\r\nthe elephant! It was impossible that there could be any such animal.\r\nHe spent hour after hour seated on the ground silently contemplating\r\nthe great creature. I wondered what his people would say to him when he\r\nreturned to them and attempted to describe what he had seen.\r\n\r\nAs our next efforts were to be directed toward a new province, it was\r\nagain necessary to secure the very essential permits. This time there\r\nwas no trouble. At Santiago del Estero, a backward city of small size\r\nand not particularly attractive appearance, we were required merely\r\nto be photographed and have our finger-prints taken, after which we\r\nreceived certificates stating that we had no police record in that\r\nstate and were assumed to be respectable and trustworthy; the licenses\r\nto hunt were attached. We wasted no time in the city and took the first\r\navailable train to Suncho Corral, about a five hours’ ride.\r\n\r\nSuncho Corral is a collection of perhaps fifty adobe shacks, and its\r\ninhabitants seemed to be mostly Turks and Syrians. We paid our respects\r\nto the local _jefe_ without delay and he secured for us permission\r\nto camp on the landholding of a friend of his; the place was about a\r\nmile distant. We pitched the tents in a delightful grove on the bank\r\nof the Rio Salido. All the country is covered with a dense growth of\r\ncacti, shrubbery, and tall, thorny trees; it was unlike any we had seen\r\nbefore. There were a few small areas cleared of the indigenous growth\r\nand planted in corn, which thrived; water was supplied by irrigation.\r\nHowever, the people, who lived in widely separated huts, seemed to\r\nsubsist mainly on their flocks of sheep, goats, and the limited number\r\nof cattle. There were so many dogs in the neighborhood that they were\r\na plague. Each night numbers prowled about camp, barking, fighting,\r\nand trying to tear open bags of provisions. We did not know how to get\r\nrid of them without killing them, and this we did not wish to do; but\r\nour boy found a way. One night we heard series after series of yelps\r\nfollowed by frantic rushes to distant parts. Next morning we discovered\r\nthat Antonio had set a dozen large, powerful “rat-killers” around the\r\ntent, baited with tempting morsels of meat. When a dog attempted to\r\ntake the food it received a terrific blow across the nose--hence the\r\nyelps. We of course stopped the practice, but the dogs did not return\r\nin sufficient numbers to be troublesome.\r\n\r\nThe water of the Rio Salido is brackish and unfit for drinking. There\r\nwere few fish--catfish and a species of _pacu_. We had no time for\r\nangling, but occasionally saw a string caught by some villager.\r\n\r\nAbout the first bird to attract our attention was a species of\r\nwood-hewer with a curved bill three or four inches long. They were\r\nalways seen in pairs or small flocks, often in company with the very\r\ncommon woodpecker (_Chrysoptilus_). Occasionally there were half a\r\ndozen of the former and twenty or more of the latter in a single party,\r\non the ground, feeding on insects and larvæ that lived in the litter\r\nof bark and leaves under the giant cactus plants. They formed a noisy\r\ngroup, especially if alarmed, when they took to the trees or cacti and\r\nkept up a continuous chirping. They tried to keep on the far side of\r\nthe trunks and branches, but curiosity prompted them to peep around\r\nthe edges frequently to see what was going on. The giant wood-hewer\r\n(_Xiphocolaptes major_), as large as a mourning-dove and with a long,\r\npowerful beak, was far less common. Another bird frequently found\r\nin company with any or all of the former was a species of brush-bird\r\nthe size of a blue jay, but of a brown color; it built stick-nests\r\nthree feet across that must have weighed up to fifty pounds. We also\r\nsaw for the first time a bird whose habits reminded us greatly of\r\nthe road-runner. It ran along the ground with crest erected and tail\r\nheld high, and was so wary that one could not approach it within\r\nshooting distance. But the moment it reached a thicket and hopped up\r\ninto the branches it lost practically all caution and we could get\r\nto within a few yards of it. Perhaps the bird’s chief enemies are\r\nterrestrial--hence its extremely suspicious nature while on the ground,\r\nand the apparent feeling of safety when in a bush or tree.\r\n\r\nNext, we again headed for the Chaco, having as our goal a station\r\ncalled Avia Terai, about half-way to Resistencia on the Paraguay\r\nRiver. The train was packed with Italian home-seekers; they were a\r\nnoisy, quarrelsome lot. Many of them were drunk or ill, and so many\r\nunsavory things were occurring constantly in the coaches (there were no\r\ncompartment-cars), that we remained in the buffet-car. An aged bishop,\r\naccompanied by two priests, were fellow passengers. The prelate got\r\noff at each stop to bless the crowds that had collected to see him,\r\nand then as many as possible knelt to kiss his ring before the train\r\npulled out. After the trio returned to their table, the two priests\r\npromptly fell asleep while their venerable superior read from a small\r\nprayer-book. I wondered why he tolerated such sleepy, uninteresting\r\ncompanions. At midnight we reached Añatuya and changed to another\r\ntrain. This place was one of wild confusion. There were mountains of\r\nluggage piled on the platform, and mobs of excited people rushing\r\nwildly about in vain attempts to locate their belongings. I was alarmed\r\nover the safety of our own possessions, so stationed the faithful\r\nAntonio near the door of the baggage-car with instructions to let me\r\nknow when unloading began; we then secured _peons_ to immediately carry\r\nthe trunks and bags to our train, thus avoiding their being dumped on\r\nthe huge piles, and perhaps lost.\r\n\r\nIn the early morning we reached Quimilí, at which place a siding\r\nbranches off to Tintina; most of the immigrants went in this direction.\r\nThe country was all flat and covered with grass. Later on clumps of\r\nforest appeared which grew larger and denser as we went farther east.\r\nThere were numerous stops but no towns of any importance. At 2.30\r\nP. M., the train halted at Avia Terai, and we were soon encamped in the\r\nrear of one of the two huts comprising that station.\r\n\r\nAbout all we could see from our abode was an immense area covered\r\nwith tall weeds, surrounded by dense forest. Sand-flies, called\r\n_polvoriños_, filled the air like flecks of dust so that we had to keep\r\na smudge going most of the time. The people said there was a great deal\r\nof malaria in the neighborhood, and one look into their faces was ample\r\nto substantiate the statement. Usually it was very hot; it rained most\r\nof the time, but occasionally the nights were very cold--an altogether\r\ndisagreeable combination of weather.\r\n\r\nOne of our trunks, containing all the instruments, had mysteriously\r\ndisappeared from the baggage-car, so we had only a pocket-knife with\r\nwhich to work; but, by putting in longer hours we managed to keep up to\r\nour average daily number in preparing specimens. We gave the conductor\r\nof a passing train a tip of several _pesos_, and on his next run he\r\nbrought us the missing trunk, saying that he had found it at a station\r\na few miles below.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to explore the country as thoroughly as we should\r\nhave liked on account of the almost incessant rain. When the downpour\r\ndid stop, which was at dusk, flocks of large, white-bellied night-hawks\r\nappeared and circled above the grass, catching insects. They were\r\nbeautiful creatures, and always came back to the same restricted areas\r\nto feed on small black beetles that flew up in great numbers from\r\nthe grass. As darkness settled over the Chaco the flocks suddenly\r\ndispersed and they disappeared singly in all directions. We found them\r\nspending the days in open places--out in the hot sun or rain. The\r\nrailroad-track, or small plots where there was not even grass, were the\r\nfavorite sleeping-sites chosen, and sometimes two or three were found\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nAfter a week we returned over the route we had come to a station called\r\nGeneral Pinedo. This was a new settlement and several dozen board huts\r\nwere being constructed on both sides of the track. Here there were\r\nseemingly limitless stretches of fine pampas with occasional small\r\nclumps of red quebracho-woods. Numbers of cattle grazed in the rich\r\ngrass, and this place was much more attractive than the one we had just\r\nleft. As might be supposed, the fauna was typical of the open country\r\nand included an abundance of short-eared and burrowing owls. The latter\r\nsat on fence-posts or on the mounds near their burrows all day long; at\r\nnight they became very active and flew back and forth over the fields\r\ngrabbing up beetles and small rodents with their feet. Their long,\r\ntremulous screeches pierced the darkness all night long.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday all the men congregated at the two rum-shops and tested their\r\ncapacities for strong drink. Often the day ended in a series of brawls\r\nwhen knives and machetes were plied freely--once with fatal result to\r\none of the _compadres_. I asked one of the guards what would be done\r\nwith the murderer, who had promptly been arrested. He said that if he\r\ncould give two hundred _pesos_ to the _commisario_ and ten to each of\r\nthe guards, the matter would be dropped. Later I was told that the\r\nmatter had been “fixed up” satisfactorily, but of course could not\r\nverify this.\r\n\r\nJune 14 found us in the village of Lavalle, in the heart of Argentina’s\r\ndesert regions. When the train from Tucuman pulled out, leaving\r\nourselves and our belongings on the station platform, we at once\r\nbegan to regret that we had come at all. The place looked decidedly\r\nuninviting. There was only the small cluster of adobe hovels, while\r\nall around stretched the cheerless waste of sandy desert. That there\r\ncould be any considerable amount of wild life in the region seemed\r\nimpossible; but, as we soon discovered to our unbounded delight, it was\r\nonly one of the instances where first impressions are deceptive.\r\n\r\nOur first care was to find a place where we could put up as we had\r\ncome prepared to remain a week; so we inquired of the station agent if\r\nthere was a _posada_ in town. He promptly said that there was none.\r\nThen we called on the judge, to whom we had a letter of introduction.\r\nHe took us to the home of a kind-hearted old woman who immediately\r\nagreed to give us a room and board; and here let me insert that in\r\nno place in all South America were we treated with more courtesy and\r\nconsideration than in the home of this venerable old woman, during the\r\nentire month we finally remained. Learning of our mission, her three\r\ndaughters became very enthusiastic and plied us with information about\r\nthe country, and the vast numbers of animals to be found within a short\r\ndistance of their very doors. They told us that the country was teeming\r\nwith vizcachas--large rodents that weigh up to twenty-five pounds and\r\ncome out of their burrows only at night. We wanted to go out and hunt\r\nthem at once but, unfortunately, there was no moonlight during the\r\nfirst part of our stay, so it was impossible to go in quest of them. We\r\ntherefore devoted our time looking for other things.\r\n\r\nInvestigation showed that the country was not quite so barren as it had\r\nat first appeared. A short walk took us into a region where there was\r\na dense growth of cacti and thorny shrubbery--so thick in fact that\r\nit was almost impossible to get through; many of the former plants\r\nwere in bloom, the spiny columns being covered with large white, waxy\r\nflowers. Here and there a native hut adorned the top of a small rise\r\nin the landscape, and near by we were sure to see the inevitable flock\r\nof goats nibbling on the leaves of acacia and mimosa, and guarded by\r\nbad-tempered dogs. A little distance away from each hovel was a pond\r\nof considerable size; these fill up during the short rainy season and\r\ntheir contents are used to water the stock and to irrigate the small\r\npatches of corn and potatoes.\r\n\r\nEverywhere we came across evidences of the animals about which we had\r\nheard so much. The country was dotted with huge mounds out of which\r\nlarge tunnels opened. From the mouths of the burrows lead deeply worn\r\npaths and in these the ground had been trampled into dust six inches\r\ndeep. The mounds are built up by the vizcachas, of the earth thrown out\r\nof the tunnels, and they take advantage of the hillocks thus created\r\nby using them as observation-posts before going far away from their\r\nhomes. The tops are often strewn with skulls and bones of the large\r\nrodents that have died in the burrows and which have been thrown out by\r\nthe survivors. Burrowing owls sat on the mounds, and swallows flitted\r\nin and out of the openings below. There were also the telltale little\r\nfoot-prints of numerous small animals which appropriated the vizcacha’s\r\ndwelling for their own use and apparently lived on peaceful terms with\r\nit. We wondered how far the tunnels ran underground, and how many\r\nspecies of animals occupied them, but there was nothing to give us a\r\nclue to the answer of either conjecture. As the time flew by, however,\r\nwe learned many things, and one at least was of a startling character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The great crested tinamou.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A burrowing owl.]\r\n\r\nThe days were cold and the sun shone at infrequent intervals. Desirous\r\nof taking some photographs, we selected one of the brightest days, and,\r\narmed with guns and cameras, we sallied forth. After a time we found\r\na vizcacha mound which was conveniently situated, and walked around\r\nit a few times in order to find the best spot from which to take the\r\npicture. We noticed nothing unusual about it, and finally set up the\r\ncamera and began to focus. While thus engaged, with my head under the\r\nblack cloth, I was suddenly startled by a wild yell from my companion\r\nand looked just in time to see him make a long jump to one side. The\r\nreason was apparent. There, not three feet away, lay a huge boa\r\nemitting a hiss that resembled a jet of escaping steam. Why we had\r\nnot seen it before is hard to understand, as it lay fully exposed on\r\nthe bare ground; but probably it was because the great reptile had\r\nlain motionless. Now it was slowly crawling, and the broad, mottled\r\nback glistened beautifully in the sunlight, with a purple iridescent\r\nsheen. We poked, and finally touched it, but as it did not resent\r\nthese advances we took its picture; then it seemed to grow weary of\r\nour attentions and made for the nearest hole, whereupon we shot it.\r\nUpon taking the snake to the village the natives told us that they\r\nwere very abundant and lived down in the burrows with the vizcachas.\r\nDuring the cold season they crawl out at noon for a sun-bath, but are\r\nvery sluggish. Subsequently, we saw many more, and even kept a number\r\nof them alive; they grew tame and friendly almost at once and never\r\nattempted to bite.\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct species, namely: the boa-constrictor, or\r\nland-snake; and the anaconda, which spends the greater part of its life\r\nin and near water. This latter attains the greater length. A fully\r\ngrown boa-constrictor does not exceed twelve feet in length; ten or\r\neleven feet is the usual size attained. There is a great difference in\r\nthe tempers of the two species. A boa soon becomes very tame, and in\r\nmany places the natives keep them running at large in the huts to catch\r\nrats. The anaconda is of a restless disposition and easily irritated.\r\nBoth will bite if annoyed, and while they are not poisonous, they hold\r\nvery tight with the strong, curved teeth so that if one tried to pull\r\naway from them the flesh would probably be torn to shreds.\r\n\r\nOf course it is a well-known fact that snakes are descendants of the\r\nlizards; they have lost their legs, but in the boa two good-sized claws\r\nare still found on the under-side, near the tail, extending out a\r\nlittle distance from between the plates.\r\n\r\nWe collected a number of the giant reptiles for their skins. Skinning a\r\nboa-constrictor is not an easy undertaking. We always made an incision\r\nall along the under-side, from the neck to the end of the tail, and\r\nthen loosened the skin from the tail end with a knife. This would leave\r\nenough of the body exposed for a good hand-hold; after this, one took\r\nhold of the body, and the other of the skin; then a real tug-of-war\r\nensued as the skin very slowly peeled off. Sometimes it was necessary\r\nto throw a hitch around a tree in order to get a better grip on the\r\nbody. After the skin was removed, it was scraped and tacked out on the\r\nwall and left for a few days to dry; it could then be rolled up and\r\npacked for shipment.\r\n\r\nThe skins tan beautifully, and make very desirable decorations for the\r\nmantel for den or library.\r\n\r\nOther days we spent hunting tiger-cats, deer, jack-rabbits, rheas\r\n(South American ostriches), and others of the animals which were so\r\nabundant.\r\n\r\nEarly morning was the best time for cats. They could then be found\r\nin the open paths stalking cavies, with which the country swarmed,\r\nor tinamou. They are prettily spotted, and somewhat larger than a\r\nhouse-cat. Upon being seen they pause for a moment to gaze at the\r\nintruder, and then vanish into the bushes in a single bound. Small deer\r\nwith spike-horns are not rare but are hard to get. They hide in the\r\nthick cover and can usually hear a person coming far enough away to\r\ndisappear from the neighborhood without being seen. Rheas travel about\r\nin bands but are wary; it is almost impossible to approach them on\r\nfoot, and they soon learn to regard a man on horseback with suspicion.\r\nThe natives kill large numbers with rifle and bolas; they eat the\r\nflesh and sell the feathers. Three years ago I saw sixty tons of rhea\r\nfeathers in a single warehouse in Buenos Aires, all of which had been\r\ntaken from killed birds and were destined to be used in making feather\r\ndusters. However, the bird is still abundant. Many large flocks are\r\nkept on cattle-ranches. The eggs, the contents of which are equal to a\r\ndozen hen’s eggs, are sold in the markets during the laying season.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Skinning a boa.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Boa sunning itself at the entrance to a vizcacha\r\nburrow.]\r\n\r\nAt last the long-awaited time arrived when the full moon lighted up\r\nthe landscape, so we made preparations to go in pursuit of the wily\r\nvizcacha. The judge sent word for us to be ready early one afternoon as\r\nhe was going to accompany us, and we could spend a few hours beforehand\r\nto advantage looking for other things. Two o’clock found us clamoring\r\nat his door, and a few minutes later we had started on our excursion.\r\n\r\nThe judge carried a double-barrelled shotgun of European make; his\r\nten-year-old son, whom he always called the _secretario_, had a\r\n“nigger-killer,” a large bag full of pebbles and a machete; he was a\r\nfine little fellow, always friendly, always polite, and nothing suited\r\nhim better than to tramp at his father’s heels on the long excursions\r\ninto the country. I had my Parker which had served me so splendidly in\r\nmany places.\r\n\r\nFor an hour or two we tramped broad reaches of cactus desert; but it\r\nwas silent as the very sphinx, and we saw nothing. However, as the sun\r\nbegan to drop slowly out of sight, things began to stir. At first we\r\nheard a shrill turkey-like gobble some distance away, and holding up\r\nhis hand to command silence, the judge whispered: “_Chuña_; they are\r\nright over there. You and the _secretario_ go down this little path,\r\nand I’ll go on this side; _quien sabe?_ we might head them off.” His\r\nfine Spanish face beamed with excitement as he turned away.\r\n\r\nWe sneaked along for a distance of a hundred yards, and presently I saw\r\na pair of gray forms moving swiftly away underneath the thorny growth.\r\nThey looked like fleeting shadows, and there was time for a hurried\r\nshot only. The _secretario_ rushed forward and triumphantly brought\r\nback a large, crested, crane-like bird of a uniform gray color, the\r\ncommon name of which is seriema. In some ways the bird resembles a\r\nhawk. It lives on the ground and eats grasshoppers, cavies, mice, and\r\nalmost anything it can catch and swallow; at night it roosts in the\r\ntrees. Its flesh is excellent. Perhaps no bird is more wary or harder\r\nto hunt in this entire region, so we were highly elated with our first\r\nshot.\r\n\r\nMany birds began to appear now; there were the long-billed brown\r\nwood-hewers we had seen at Suncho Corral; Argentine “road-runners”\r\nwhich perked their tails and sped away into the thickets; large\r\nbrownish _leñadores_, singing on the edges of their huge nests; there\r\nwere also woodpeckers, hawks, cardinals, and doves.\r\n\r\nThe judge suggested that we visit one of the reservoirs as we might\r\nfind ducks there, and calmly floating on the very first one we came to\r\nwas a small flock of shovellers; they saw us just too late, and one was\r\nadded to the bag as they rose from the water.\r\n\r\nWe now cut across a little field from which the corn had been gathered,\r\nand here we were kept busy for some time picking off the swift-winged\r\ntinamou as they rushed away at our approach. I know of no bird which\r\nfurnishes better shooting or better eating, and the pity of it is that\r\nit does not exist in our own country. After we had shot a number, the\r\njudge suggested that we might try for a fox as they would soon be\r\nprowling about, so he tied a string to the foot of one of the freshly\r\nkilled birds and the _secretario_ dragged it on the ground after him\r\nas he walked along. Some time later we sat down to rest, and much to\r\nmy surprise a fox appeared on the trail of the bird; as he stopped\r\nshort, at sight of us, the judge bagged him, and he proved to be the\r\nlargest and the finest of the dozen or more we succeeded in getting\r\nduring our entire stay. These foxes, which are of a rich gray color,\r\nsilver-tipped, spend a great part of their time in dens in the vizcacha\r\nburrows, but seem to feed principally on tinamou and other birds.\r\n\r\nCavies without number ran about under the low bushes, and uttered\r\nqueer little squeaks as they became frightened and dashed into the\r\nholes which honeycombed the ground; but of the giant cavy we had not\r\na glimpse until we entered a dry, little gully; there we were just\r\nin time to see a fleeing, rabbit-like form, which was added to our\r\nassortment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Oculto, or _Tucotuco_, a rare rodent with mole-like\r\nhabits.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gray fox, abundant in the semiarid regions.]\r\n\r\nAs the sun set, large flocks of blue-crowned parrakeets flew screaming\r\noverhead to seek their sleeping-quarters in the tops of the gnarled,\r\nstunted trees; and gray-throated parrakeets hurried to their bulky\r\nstick nests to chatter and quarrel before settling for the night. The\r\nlatter species is an abundant bird in the Chaco of Brazil and Paraguay\r\nas well as in the Argentine. In the Argentine its range extends\r\neastward into the province of Tucuman, while it is most plentiful in\r\nSantiago del Estero. They are extremely noisy and live and travel in\r\nflocks of a dozen to several thousand individuals. Should one approach\r\na tree in which a band is feeding or resting, all chatter is hushed.\r\nBut the birds crane their necks and noiselessly clamber to points of\r\nvantage from which they suspiciously eye the intruder. Then there is a\r\nsudden burst of wild screams as the whole colony takes wing and swiftly\r\ndeparts at great speed. They feed largely upon the thistle and on\r\ncactus fruits as well as on grain when it is to be had.\r\n\r\nThe nests vary in size from those containing not more than an armful\r\nof twigs, and occupied by a single pair of birds, to huge structures\r\nweighing several hundred pounds and harboring a dozen families.\r\nFrequently three or four nests are placed in the same tree, and usually\r\na number of trees in a given area are occupied. The ground beneath the\r\ndomiciles is strewn with a thick litter of old nesting material that\r\nhas fallen from the disused bulky masses above.\r\n\r\nThe nesting cavities are in the under-side of the “apartments,” and\r\nentrance to them is gained through tubular openings underneath, which\r\nprevents opossums from entering them. It is not unusual to find a\r\nfamily of the marsupials living in a cavity in the upper part of the\r\nstructure, but so strongly are the twigs interlaced that they are\r\nunable to tear their way through the thorny mass to the toothsome\r\nmorsels that are so tantalizingly near. The birds occupy the nests\r\nthroughout the year and it is rare to find them entirely deserted at\r\nany hour of the day. The eggs are white, slightly glossy, and of an\r\noval shape; five to eight comprise a set. With the approach of darkness\r\nsmall birds seemed to disappear among the cacti. The _secretario_ kept\r\nup a constant fusillade with his sling, but he was a poor shot and did\r\nno damage.\r\n\r\nFinally the judge suggested supper, so we sat down on a fallen cactus\r\ntrunk from which the spines had decayed, and enjoyed the bread,\r\nsausage, and tangerines which the boy fished out of the bag containing\r\nhis pebbles and sundry articles; then, in answer to our call, a plump\r\nQuechua squaw brought a gourd of water from her near-by hovel; we gave\r\nher a cigarette in return, which pleased her so much that she showed us\r\na wonderful vizcacha village not far distant, which, she said, harbored\r\nthe largest and fattest of the rodents to be found in the district; she\r\nalso agreed to take charge of our game so that we would not be hampered\r\nwith it the rest of the evening.\r\n\r\nThe great silvery moon now began to peep above the cloudless horizon,\r\nand in a few minutes the whole country was flooded with light. Not a\r\nplant grew on the broad acres the Indian woman had pointed out; there\r\nwas only the dead stump of a cactus here and there, but these loomed\r\ntall and ghostlike in the mellow light. Soon we heard deep, guttural\r\ngrunts, followed by shrill squeaks, and in a low tone the judge said\r\n“vizcachas.” Then he dug down into his pockets and produced some\r\nbeeswax and cotton, so each of us fixed a small fluff on the sight of\r\nour guns, and were then ready for business. We had not gone a hundred\r\nyards, after this, when the judge pointed to a mound ahead, and there,\r\nlooming high above the yellow earth, sat some great, restless creature,\r\nsqueaking and grunting. My companion had explained to me the business\r\nof stalking, a score of times, so I set out as directed, making a wide\r\ndétour in order to get behind a cactus stump; but I am afraid the\r\nexcitement was too great and I went too fast, for the first thing I\r\nknew there was a glimpse of a fleeting, shadowy form, a sharp, shrill\r\nsqueal, and the mound was bare.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later we could make out another animal some little\r\ndistance away, so the judge went after it; he crept up cautiously,\r\npausing at frequent intervals; then there was a bright flash, followed\r\nby a loud report, and we all rushed forward to pick up the first\r\nvizcacha. His disappointment was great when he found that he had\r\n“potted” a nice little cactus stump.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before we saw another of the animals. It being my\r\nturn, I began to stalk, profiting by past experience. The creature was\r\noutlined clearly, and frequently it sat up to look about; then the\r\nwhite breast showed distinctly. When the vizcacha sat up, I stopped;\r\nwhen it dropped down on all fours, I crept on. At forty yards I took\r\nthe shot, and this time luck was with us. When we reached the spot the\r\nanimal was tumbling about, and the judge yelled not to touch it, as\r\nthey can inflict serious wounds with their sharp teeth and claws. At\r\nthis stage of the game the _secretario_ came in for his share of the\r\nwork; he followed the dancing form in its erratic course, and finally\r\ndealt it a blow on the neck with the blunt side of the machete, killing\r\nit. It was a splendid specimen, weighing a trifle over eighteen pounds,\r\nas we later discovered. It differed from the species found in the high\r\nmountains in having a shorter tail and coarse fur, besides being much\r\nlarger; the appearance of the former had always brought to my mind a\r\ncombination of a squirrel and a rabbit; this creature was, well, simply\r\na vizcacha; there is nothing else like it. The color is slaty-blue on\r\nthe back and white underneath.\r\n\r\nAfter that the animals began to appear on all sides as the village\r\nwas very large and there were numerous mounds; it was therefore a\r\ncomparatively easy matter to secure the half-dozen we wanted, although\r\nI am compelled to admit that each of us shot at least one more stump\r\nbefore the evening was over. If not killed by the first shot, the\r\ncreatures frequently tumble into their burrows and are lost. The males\r\nleave the hiding-places first, and after spending a short time looking\r\nabout from the top of the mounds, spread out over the surrounding\r\ncountry to feed; the females follow a short time later, and both return\r\nat the break of day. On account of their great numbers in some parts\r\nof the country, they destroy vast areas of pasturage and are therefore\r\nlooked upon as vermin. We heard the reports of guns frequently, not far\r\naway, indicating that other hunting-parties were out. The flesh of the\r\nanimal is greatly esteemed by the natives.\r\n\r\nAnother of the _secretario’s_ duties was to carry the game; but this\r\nwas soon too heavy for him, so we helped. Then he made the discovery\r\nthat the animals were covered with fleas, ticks, and other parasites,\r\nand that this host of unwelcome guests preferred him to the dead\r\ncreatures he was carrying; we made the same discovery, so hired an\r\nIndian to lug the trophies home for us.\r\n\r\nWhile homeward bound we crossed a small open place where not a plant\r\ngrew, and the sand shimmered with a dull glow. Coming directly for\r\nus was a white, plume-like, waving object which could hardly be\r\ndistinguished from its surroundings, but when both the judge and the\r\n_secretario_ shouted _Zorino_ I knew enough to shoot, and shoot to\r\nkill. We waited a moment to see whether the animal was dead, then\r\napproaching carefully, I picked up a fine skunk. Just then his mate\r\nput in an appearance on the edge of the opening, and there was no\r\nchoice but to add her to the collection. When it came to carrying home\r\nthese additions to the bag, even the Indian balked, so I tied them to\r\nthe end of my gun-barrel and carried them in this manner. Early the\r\nnext morning the entire town came to see the _Zorinos_; the scent had\r\npenetrated into the furthermost hut, and they had unerringly traced it\r\nto its source.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Long-tailed vizcacha of the high Andes.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Short-tailed vizcacha of the Argentine lowlands.]\r\n\r\nFew things could be more delightful than the tramp home across the\r\ndesert; the clear moonlight, the crisp air, and the tremulous wail of\r\nan owl, all added enchantment to the night’s outing; and, above all, we\r\nhad had a capital good time, and cemented a friendship, as only a\r\ntrip of this kind can, with our kindly Argentine host. He is a splendid\r\nfellow, a peerless companion; and one of my fondest hopes is that I may\r\nsome day again tramp the moonlit Argentine deserts in his company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nTHE LAKE REGION OF WESTERN ARGENTINA--THE HEART OF THE WINE COUNTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nInhabitants of the vine-growing districts of Argentina claim that their\r\ncountry produces more wine than California; and, judging by appearances\r\nas we entered the Province of San Juan, there seemed to be abundant\r\nevidence to support the belief that the yield of grapes is enormous.\r\nThe soil is sandy and the seepage of snow-water from the mountains is\r\nample to make up for the lack of rainfall.\r\n\r\nMany of the vineyards are of great extent. Grapes of numerous varieties\r\nare grown, and for size and flavor they are unequalled by any I have\r\never seen anywhere. Wines of many kinds, and grades, are made, and they\r\nare of uniformly excellent quality. Even the champagnes are good. The\r\nprice at which they sell is low in that part of the country--so low\r\nin fact that even the laboring class drink them with their meals. In\r\nBuenos Aires they cost as much as the imported article, owing to the\r\nfact that freight between San Juan or Mendoza and Buenos Aires equals\r\nor exceeds shipping charges from Spain, Portugal, and France.\r\n\r\nThe city of San Juan reminded us of Salta; perhaps it is not quite so\r\nlarge or up-to-date, but it is nevertheless not unattractive; we spent\r\nlittle time there as we had been invited to a _finca_, where there is a\r\nlake of considerable size, to shoot ducks.\r\n\r\nOne of my ambitions had always been to find a place where ducks and\r\ngeese were really plentiful--in fact abundant enough to furnish\r\nan interesting pastime, observing them under conditions that were\r\nnot too trying, and where they would also furnish good sport. We\r\nhad heard of the wonderful shooting on Lake Titicaca, but upon our\r\narrival the season was closed and there was little besides coots and\r\ngrebes; however, at certain times of the year there is an abundance\r\nof water-fowl and sportsmen from La Paz get enviable shooting\r\nopportunities.\r\n\r\nThe marshes along the Cauca River, Colombia, had given better results.\r\nTeals, tree-ducks, ruddies, and an occasional pair of big muscovies\r\ncould always be found; but the ducks were loath to take wing, and going\r\nafter them in the dense grass and thorny shrubbery growing in the\r\nmarshes was very trying work.\r\n\r\nThen we had reached the rice-growing district around Los Sarmientos.\r\n\r\n“Ducks?” they said. “Why, _hombre_, they are bringing them into Tucuman\r\nby the thousands. The government is paying a bounty of five cents a\r\nhead on them as they are destroying all the rice. They are swooping\r\ndown by the tens of thousands; all the lakes in the south have dried\r\nup, so they are coming here. When the flocks rise from the fields, the\r\nearth trembles.”\r\n\r\nThat was certainly good news; but when we arrived, the birds had\r\ndeparted for regions unknown.\r\n\r\nLeaving San Juan at 6 P. M., we reached a station called Media Agua\r\n(half water) two hours later. Our new friend had sent a _peon_ to meet\r\nus, bringing a wagon; so as soon as we could extricate our luggage from\r\nthe pile on the station platform, we loaded the vehicle and started on\r\nthe long drive across the cold, barren country. It was very dark and\r\nthere was not much of a road anyway, so the wagon jolted along over\r\nthe rocks or dragged heavily through deep sand. The cold was intense;\r\nwe wrapped up in heavy Indian blankets, which, however, did not give\r\ncomplete protection from the stinging blasts.\r\n\r\nAt midnight the driver refused to go any farther and drew up at a\r\nlonely hut, where we spent the rest of the night. Early next morning\r\nwe were off again. We now passed through large irrigated fields where\r\nwheat was grown, and also a good deal of maize. Then the desert began\r\nagain, and from appearances there was not a drop of water within many\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nWe questioned the driver about the lake, and whether there were any\r\n_patos_ (ducks); but he only shrugged his shoulders and said: “_Quien\r\nsabe?_”\r\n\r\nSuddenly we saw the shimmer of placid water ahead, and soon drew up\r\nat a board shack some little distance from the lake. Our man had told\r\nus to take nothing but our guns and ammunition, as his caretaker, who\r\nlived in the hut we had just reached, would provide everything else. We\r\ntook a tent and a few provisions anyway, just to be safe, and it was\r\nlucky that we did. Not only had nothing been provided, but the tenant\r\nhad not even been advised of our coming. He had only one dirty little\r\nroom, but this he very generously placed at our disposal; however,\r\nwe preferred to camp outside, although it was bitter cold. His wife\r\nconsented to do the cooking.\r\n\r\nThe tent was hastily put up; then we hurried to the lake, leaving the\r\nfamily busily engaged in slaughtering a goat for lunch.\r\n\r\nAll the surrounding country is a wind-swept desert, there being no\r\ntrees and but a few thorny bushes. In spots the sand and alkali dust\r\nis several feet deep. It seemed impossible that there could be a lake\r\nin such a parched-looking locality; but there lay the glistening sheet\r\nof water, stretching away into the distance as far as the eye could\r\nsee. Along the edges were vast, shallow marshes, covering hundreds of\r\nacres; in these, sedges grew abundantly, forming shelter and providing\r\na limitless feeding-ground for water-fowl. Half a mile from the bank\r\nstood great clumps of _totoras_, or cattails, rearing their tough,\r\nslender stems to a height of seven or eight feet above the water.\r\nWhat was infinitely more interesting to us, the whole surface of the\r\nlake, from its marshy edge to the rows of _totoras_ fading away in the\r\ndistance, was teeming with water-birds.\r\n\r\nThere were no boats to be had in the neighborhood, as the natives use\r\nreed rafts. They cut quantities of cattails, bind them into long,\r\nthick bundles and, lashing several of them together, form a craft that\r\nwill support a man, although his feet are always under the icy water.\r\nShooting from such a contrivance, unless it is larger than any I have\r\nseen, would be impossible. Therefore we started to walk along the muddy\r\nbanks in the hope that something would fly over.\r\n\r\nAfter having gone a short distance, a commotion among the sedges\r\nattracted our attention, and a moment later a large gray fox appeared\r\nand trotted away. A charge of No. 4 shot stopped him; he was in\r\nsplendid fur and made a desirable addition to our lot of trophies.\r\nLater, we saw them frequently; they haunt the edges of the marsh and\r\nfeed upon coots and wounded ducks. Carrion-hawks, also, were always\r\nabout in considerable numbers and reaped a rich harvest.\r\n\r\nCoots of several species were running around everywhere. They wandered\r\nfar away from the water, apparently to pick up toads or lizards, and\r\nas we approached, scurried back to the marsh or hid in the dense,\r\nlow bushes, where they remained motionless until the cause of their\r\nfright had passed. Ducks were all well out of range and refused to fly\r\nover. I hesitate to estimate their numbers, there were such countless\r\nthousands, but in many places the water was covered with them, and\r\nthere were large white geese and black-necked swans. Black rails of\r\ngood size darted about or waded boldly out in the open, jerking their\r\ntails and clucking.\r\n\r\nIt did not take us long to discover that we were too late in the day\r\nfor ducks, so we started back to camp, cutting across the country.\r\nSeveral tinamous got up singly, with a loud whir of wings; they flew\r\nstraight and fast, a great contrast to the slow, wavering flight of the\r\nforest-inhabiting species.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached camp, some of the goat-meat had been roasted and we had\r\na feast! The rest of the day was spent in straightening up camp.\r\n\r\nOur eight by twelve foot “balloon silk” tent had been put up under a\r\nshed adjoining the house; this protected it from the wind on at least\r\none side. To be of any use in the tropics, the tent must of course be\r\nprovided with a ground-cloth and bobbinet curtains; it should also\r\ncontain a window, screened with netting, in the roof. We did not need\r\nthe curtains, so tied them back. A brazier was kindled, and after it\r\nwas filled with glowing embers, it was taken into the tent; it warmed\r\nthe tent thoroughly within a few moments and kept a fire all night. The\r\nwindow, which was always kept open, served its mission splendidly as a\r\nmeans of ventilation.\r\n\r\nThe owner of the hut had gone away to look for a boat, and that night\r\nreturned with one of ample size; but next morning a furious wind was\r\nblowing, so hunting was out of the question. The air was so filled\r\nwith dust that one could not see anything more than a few yards away,\r\nand huge waves rolled in from the lake and tore hungrily at the sandy\r\nbanks. These storms are very common during the winter months and blow\r\nup several times a week.\r\n\r\nThe third day of our visit was beautiful. We pushed the boat out of\r\nthe tangle of sedges and made straight for the cattails. The birds\r\nwere stirring, and flock after flock passed overhead. When we paddled\r\nquietly into the midst of the green islets, we seemed to enter a new\r\nworld, filled with surprises and wonderful beyond description. The\r\ntall, graceful stems of the totoras swayed gently with the swell made\r\nby the passing boat, and cast long shadows in the narrow lanes of\r\nglassy water they enclosed. Coots and grebes, like shadows, paddled\r\nsilently away and lost themselves among the reeds; ruddy ducks popped\r\nup here, there, and everywhere, stared a moment, and then dived again\r\nwith a splash; they seemed to spend a good deal of their time under\r\nwater, and the fishermen frequently caught them in gill-nets set along\r\nthe bottom of the lake. The male ruddies were in fine plumage, with\r\ndeep chestnut backs, white throat-patches, and bright-blue bills;\r\nthey seldom tried to fly, and then skimmed the water for a few\r\nyards only; the ones we shot were so fat that it is hard to understand\r\nhow they could fly at all. Occasionally we saw a giant grebe. From a\r\ndistance it resembled a loon; they are fast swimmers and expert divers.\r\nOur boatman always begged us to shoot these birds, as the natives are\r\nvery fond of the flesh and, also, the skin of the breast with its\r\nbeautiful white, silky feathers, brings a good price in the feather\r\nmarkets. Needless to say, none was shot for this purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rice-fields at the foot of the Andes Mountains,\r\nSarmientos.]\r\n\r\nAmong the reeds flitted a wonderful little bird, known as the military\r\nflycatcher, or “bird of seven colors.” It is little larger than a\r\nwren, yellow underneath and green above, with the crest and under\r\ntail-coverts bright red; there are yellow stripes on the sides of the\r\nhead and the cheeks are blue; the wings and tail are black. The bird is\r\na sprightly little fellow, flitting and jumping about among the reeds\r\nin pursuit of small insects, and uttering its cheerful “_cheeps_” at\r\nfrequent intervals; it gives a touch of color and dainty life to the\r\nsombre green of the vegetation, and to the reflections in the murky\r\nwater below.\r\n\r\nPresently we left the region of the _totoras_ and emerged into the\r\nopen lake. The surface was dotted with ducks, coots, and grebes--a\r\nsquawking, diving, racing mass that defies description. We made right\r\nfor the centre of action. The coots always waited until the boat was\r\nbut a few yards away and then, after giving a few clucks, started to\r\nrun and flop across the water, leaving a myriad of silvery, rippling\r\npaths in their wake, and making the marsh reverberate with the noise.\r\nOften this would frighten the ducks, and flocks would jump up all\r\naround in such vast numbers that we were lost in admiration watching\r\nthe wonderful sight of the thousands of swishing, black forms hurtling\r\ninto the wintry sky.\r\n\r\nOur method of hunting was to paddle along slowly, squatting low in\r\nthe boat until within range of a flock of ducks; then, by standing up\r\nsuddenly, the flock would be frightened into taking wing, and the\r\nindividuals we had selected could be picked off. We wanted birds in\r\ngood plumage only, and this manner of hunting gave us the opportunity\r\nof selecting each individual separately. There were shovellers and\r\ncinnamon teal without number; the handsome males, in brightest plumage,\r\nwere dashing around the inconspicuously colored females, swimming low\r\nand with bills flat on the water; usually there were not more than\r\na dozen or fifteen in a party. Then there were scaups, tree-ducks,\r\npintails, blackheads, and rosy-bills. The latter were wary; they always\r\npassed high above, in large flocks, and the rushing sound made by their\r\nwings could be heard a long distance away.\r\n\r\nDabbling in the mud-banks along the edge of the marsh were flocks of\r\nfrom four to thirty large white geese (_Casa-roba_). Black-necked\r\nswans, singly or in small groups, sailed about majestically. Of the two\r\nbirds the geese were the more graceful, and by far the more beautiful.\r\nThe swans were not very wild, but when the boat approached they began\r\nto utter shrill “_kee-wee’s_”; finally they would launch into the air\r\nwith a great deal of flapping, beating the water with powerful strokes\r\nof the wings, and keeping up their cry all the while. When we neared a\r\nflock of geese, they began to patrol the water ahead, swimming back and\r\nforth, and eying us with suspicion; they swam well out of the water,\r\nwith a graceful carriage of the head and neck, and uttered constant\r\nloud, penetrating cries that sounded like “_honk-honk-queenk_.” What\r\nis more thrilling than the clear, piercing challenge of this spirit\r\nof the wild? Wafted across the watery waste on the wings of a crisp\r\nautumn wind, it comes as a message from the regions of snow and ice--a\r\nforeboding of the bleak, dark days to follow. I never tired of hearing\r\nit, and lost more than one shot at a flock coming over from another\r\ndirection because I was so interested in listening to the fascinating\r\nnotes of other birds ahead of us. When they finally decided to take\r\nwing, they rose from the water quickly and gracefully, and flew at\r\ngreat speed, stringing out in various formations. They always went far\r\naway before again dropping down into the water.\r\n\r\nWe continued paddling through the centre of the open water to a large\r\nmud-flat in search of flamingoes. The natives called them _choflos_,\r\nand said that a great many came to this spot each day to feed on the\r\nsmall snails and other mollusks which abound in the shallow places.\r\nWhen still a good distance away we could make out what seemed to be\r\na long row of old piles driven into the centre of the mud-flat. The\r\nwater had become so shallow that the boat could not proceed, so there\r\nwas nothing to do but wade, not an altogether pleasant experience, as\r\nit was bitter cold and sheets of thin ice floated about everywhere.\r\nWhen we moved, the flamingoes stood stock-still and looked at us; when\r\nwe stood motionless they lowered their heads, dabbled in the mud, and\r\nwalked about. From a distance they seemed to be of enormous size, and\r\nuntil we were near by they appeared coal-black. Finally they became\r\nrestive, ran back and forth a few steps and then, beating the air\r\nwith laborious strokes of the wings, flew away. Frequently, on other\r\noccasions, they circled around a few times before departing from the\r\nlocality.\r\n\r\nWe returned to camp by way of the sedge marshes, although, on account\r\nof the bushes and shallow water, poling the boat through the tangle\r\nwas hard work. In the tops of many of the bushes were immense nests,\r\nbuilt of sticks and reed-stems; they apparently belonged to the giant\r\ncoots, as many of these birds still used them for resting-places; also,\r\nnearly all of the platforms were piled with dead frogs which the coots\r\nhad disembowelled. Our man said that during the months of December and\r\nJanuary all the people living near the lagoons camp on the edge of the\r\nwater and collect eggs; they gather immense numbers and take them to\r\nthe markets of the neighboring towns to sell.\r\n\r\nThere were ducks everywhere, feeding or playing among the sedges, and\r\nflocks coming from the surrounding sloughs whistled past constantly and\r\nplumped down with a splash. Black-headed gulls flew back and forth\r\noverhead, and cormorants stood on snags, drying their outstretched\r\nwings. To shoot birds under such circumstances would be mere slaughter,\r\nand the number one could kill is limited only by the amount of\r\nammunition at hand. The natives kill four or five hundred ducks each\r\nday during this season, and have done so for years, but the number of\r\nbirds does not seem to diminish.\r\n\r\nThere were also numbers of noisy stilt-sandpipers, storks, and\r\nscreamers, and occasionally we ran across a pectoral sandpiper which,\r\nas at Tafí, was so fat that it did not attempt to fly and could be\r\ncaught by throwing a hat over it. Lapwings, too, passed over in small\r\nbunches, screaming and quarrelling as they went.\r\n\r\nNearly all the ducks were feeding on the small seeds of the\r\nwater-plants, and were rolling in fat; but on several occasions we ran\r\ninto small flocks of shovellers and teals which were near the bank and\r\nrefused to fly; an examination of several of them showed that they were\r\nvery light and probably diseased.\r\n\r\nAs we neared the landing, dusk was just enveloping the landscape.\r\nRed-breasted meadow-larks sang in the desert, yellow-shouldered\r\nblackbirds babbled in the thick reeds, and black ibises in flocks of\r\nmany thousands were returning from their feeding-grounds miles away, to\r\nspend the night in the marshes.\r\n\r\nWe desired our birds principally for scientific purposes; that is, to\r\nprepare the skins for museum specimens, and had shot only a limited\r\nnumber of the best-plumaged individuals of each species; but even then\r\nour bag amounted to over half a hundred ducks, a number of geese and\r\nswans, and a fairly good collection of coots, grebes, herons, and other\r\nbirds typical of the vast Argentine lake region.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of all this material presented a stupendous task.\r\nFirst they were cleaned thoroughly of all spots, then hung up in a\r\nsafe place, where they remained in good condition on account of the\r\ncold. The days that followed were so stormy that outdoor work was\r\nimpossible, so we were glad to remain in the tent disposing of the work\r\nin hand.\r\n\r\nWhen the weather cleared we took other boat-trips through the marshes\r\nand out into the lake, but our bag was always limited to things we did\r\nnot possess or needed for food. The geese were leaving in small flocks\r\nto breed in the high Andes, the natives said. Swans also started to\r\ndrift southward; but still the number of remaining water-fowl, mostly\r\nducks and coots that did not migrate, was incalculable. The water was\r\nconstantly ruffled by the myriad of moving forms and, at times, the\r\nroar of rapidly beating wings reminded us of distant thunder.\r\n\r\nThe few people living in widely separated hovels around the borders of\r\nthe lake lead miserable lives. They cultivate small areas in grain, but\r\nlive mostly on fish, water-birds, and goat’s milk. The winter season is\r\nmost trying. Snow falls infrequently and in small quantities, but the\r\ncold is intense. The dust-storms, however, are the real tribulations\r\nwhich render life well-nigh unbearable. They frequently last many days\r\nat a time; the fine sand sifts through and into everything and is\r\nalmost suffocating. One breathes it, eats it, wakes up in the morning\r\ncovered with a layer, and lives in it continuously as in a thick, brown\r\nhaze that is most exasperating and invites almost constant profanity,\r\nat least in thought. We were glad we visited Media Agua; but we were\r\nglad indeed when we found ourselves back in San Juan.\r\n\r\nIt requires but four hours to reach Mendoza from San Juan by train.\r\nThis attractive city is really in the heart of the wine country, but\r\nthe vineyards were almost depleted from the inroads of an insect called\r\nthe _bicho de cesto_. The vegetation all about was covered with small,\r\nragged cocoons from which the hungry hordes of destructive creatures\r\nwould emerge in the spring. In places wide areas of weeds had been\r\nburned over to destroy the pest while still in the incipient stage; but\r\nenough always escaped to undo the work of the few careful growers who\r\nattempted to stamp out their enemy of the grape-vines. The slaughter\r\nof birds on a vast scale may account for the increase of the _bicho\r\nde cesto_. We saw vendors on the streets carrying baskets full of\r\nsmall birds of several species--mostly sparrows--which they sold by\r\nthe dozen. The number killed weekly must run into the thousands. As a\r\nnatural result of this wholesale killing, birds are not plentiful in\r\nthe environs of Mendoza.\r\n\r\nFrom the outskirts of the city one has a superb view of the Andean\r\nRange. The lofty mountains extend in an unbroken, snow-capped line as\r\nfar as the eye can see. Aconcagua, the peer of the Argentine Andes, may\r\nbe seen from a point several miles south of Mendoza, lording over his\r\nlesser satellites in a majestic, awe-inspiring way. The shifting mists,\r\ncloud-banks, and intermittent sunlight playing on the white peaks\r\npresent an ever-varying series of pictures that are unexcelled for\r\nbeauty and grandeur.\r\n\r\nAt Mendoza we met an Italian who claimed to be the champion\r\ncondor-hunter of all South America. During his ten years of collecting\r\nhe had killed more than sixteen thousand of the magnificent birds. His\r\nrecord for one day was one hundred and fourteen. Naturally, they had\r\nbecome greatly reduced in numbers, for the condor lays but a single egg\r\nand it takes many months to rear the young. His method was to drive a\r\nburro to some lonely gorge among the bleak mountain-tops favored by the\r\nbirds, and then to kill the animal. He was very particular in stating\r\nthat the burro had to be fat--a poor one would not do for bait. He then\r\nspread nets about the carcass, and when the condors gathered about to\r\nfeast he pulled a rope and ensnared them; on one occasion he trapped\r\nsixty-seven at one throw of the net. The prisoners were despatched with\r\na club and the long wing-feathers extracted to be exported to France to\r\ndecorate women’s hats. Formerly he had received about twenty _pesos_\r\nper bird. With his accumulated wealth he built a powder-mill; this\r\npromptly blew up, so he was again practically penniless. Of course\r\nthere were still condors in the mountains--in fact, he knew of a ledge\r\nwhere upward of eight hundred congregated to spend the nights, but the\r\nprice of feathers had gone down fifty per cent on account of the war.\r\nHe ended his speech in a very dramatic manner: “What,” he said, “me go\r\nout and slaughter such a wonderful, magnificent, and rare bird as the\r\ncondor _for ten pesos each_? No, señor! Not me.”\r\n\r\nAbout the only animal that was abundant near Mendoza was the\r\njack-rabbit, introduced into the Argentine some forty years ago. It has\r\nincreased to such an extent as to be harmful, and has spread over the\r\nentire southern part of the plains country. Many are killed and sold in\r\nthe markets under the name _liebre_.\r\n\r\nWe met Doctor Chapman at Mendoza. He had come from Chile over the\r\nTrans-Andean Railroad. A wire had been sent us to join him at Santiago,\r\nbut it arrived three weeks too late to be of any service. After a\r\nfew days spent in taking photographs of the country and collecting\r\naccessories for a habitat group of the rhea, we started eastward to\r\nBuenos Aires.\r\n\r\nWe left Mendoza at one o’clock P. M., September 3. At first there was\r\na seemingly endless succession of vineyards; then a vast expanse of\r\narid country more barren even than the desert of Santiago del Estero.\r\nAt midnight we left the parched plains and entered the fertile wheat\r\nand grazing lands which constitute one of Argentina’s chief sources\r\nof wealth and justly entitle that country to rank among the producing\r\nand great nations of the New World. Commodious ranch-houses standing\r\nin fields where thousands of head of live stock grazed were passed in\r\nsteady succession. In some of the pastures hundreds of half-tamed rheas\r\nfed unconcernedly among the horses and cattle. Frequently we saw flocks\r\nof snowy gulls following a plough or resting in a bunch on the ground;\r\nlapwings circled about with angry screams, and ducks swam unconcernedly\r\nin the little sloughs beside the railroad. There were also rows of\r\nsolemn, sedate storks, gravely contemplating the train as it passed,\r\nand flamingoes dabbling for mollusks in shallow pools.\r\n\r\nAfter a continuous ride of twenty-five hours we reached Buenos Aires,\r\nand two weeks later the _Amazon_ of the Royal Mail Line was speeding us\r\nhomeward.\r\n\r\nI am writing these last few pages in an aviation concentration-camp\r\nawaiting orders to go to new lands, and new and possibly far more\r\nexciting experiences; but almost daily my thoughts go back to the great\r\nwonderland that lies south of us, and which I have learned to love.\r\nSpeed the day when I may again eagerly scan the horizon for a first,\r\nfaint tinge of its palm-fringed shore-line!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n

in the original book; otherwise they\r\nwere not changed.\r\n\r\nSimple typographical errors were corrected; unbalanced quotation\r\nmarks were remedied when the change was obvious, and otherwise left\r\nunbalanced.\r\n\r\nIllustrations in this eBook have been positioned between paragraphs\r\nand outside quotations. In versions of this eBook that support\r\nhyperlinks, the page references in the List of Illustrations lead to\r\nthe corresponding illustrations.\r\n\r\nThe illustration on the Copyright page is the publisher’s logo.\r\n\r\nThe original text omitted accent marks from many Spanish words.\r\n\r\nThe index was not checked for proper alphabetization or correct page\r\nreferences.\r\n\r\nPage 138: “Señor Cspinas” was printed that way.\r\n\r\nPage 316: “influences, and had” was printed that way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's In the Wilds of South America, by Leo E.
