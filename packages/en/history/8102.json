F.R.S. F.S.A. and Cur. Brit. Mus.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI return your very curious Roll of Cookery, and I trust with some\r\nInterest, not full I confess nor legal, but the utmost which your\r\nDebtor, from the scantiness of his ability, can at present afford.\r\nIndeed, considering your respectable situation in life, and that\r\ndiffusive sphere of knowledge and science in which you are acting, it\r\nmust be exceedingly difficult for any one, how well furnished soever,\r\ncompletely to answer your just, or even most moderate demands. I\r\nintreat the favour of you, however, to accept for once this short\r\npayment in lieu of better, or at least as a public testimony of that\r\nprofound regard wherewith I am,\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nYour affectionate friend,\r\nand most obliged servant,\r\nSt. George's day, 1780.\r\n\r\nS. PEGGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nTO THE\r\n\r\nCURIOUS ANTIQUARIAN READER.\r\n\r\nWithout beginning _ab ovo_ on a subject so light (a matter of\r\nimportance, however, to many a modern Catius or Amasinius), by\r\ninvestigating the origin of the Art of Cookery, and the nature of it\r\nas practised by the Antediluvians [1]; without dilating on the\r\nseveral particulars concerning it afterwards amongst the Patriarchs,\r\nas found in the Bible [2], I shall turn myself immediately, and\r\nwithout further preamble, to a few cursory observations respecting\r\nthe Greeks, Romans, Britons, and those other nations, Saxons, Danes,\r\nand Normans, with whom the people of this nation are more closely\r\nconnected.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks probably derived something of their skill from the East,\r\n(from the Lydians principally, whose cooks are much celebrated, [3])\r\nand something from Egypt. A few hints concerning Cookery may be\r\ncollected from Homer, Aristophanes, Aristotle, &c. but afterwards\r\nthey possessed many authors on the subject, as may be seen in\r\nAthenæus [4]. And as Diætetics were esteemed a branch of the study of\r\nmedicine, as also they were afterwards [5], so many of those authors\r\nwere Physicians; and _the Cook_ was undoubtedly a character of high\r\nreputation at Athens [6].\r\n\r\nAs to the Romans; they would of course borrow much of their culinary\r\narts from the Greeks, though the Cook with them, we are told, was one\r\nof the lowest of their slaves [7]. In the latter times, however, they\r\nhad many authors on the subject as well as the Greeks, and the\r\npractitioners were men of some Science [8], but, unhappily for us,\r\ntheir compositions are all lost except that which goes under the name\r\nof Apicius; concerning which work and its author, the prevailing\r\nopinion now seems to be, that it was written about the time of\r\n_Heliogabalus_ [9], by one _Cælius_, (whether _Aurelianus_ is not so\r\ncertain) and that _Apicius_ is only the title of it [10]. However,\r\nthe compilation, though not in any great repute, has been several\r\ntimes published by learned men.\r\n\r\nThe Aborigines of Britain, to come nearer home, could have no great\r\nexpertness in Cookery, as they had no oil, and we hear nothing of\r\ntheir butter, they used only sheep and oxen, eating neither hares,\r\nthough so greatly esteemed at Rome, nor hens, nor geese, from a\r\nnotion of superstition. Nor did they eat fish. There was little corn\r\nin the interior part of the island, but they lived on milk and flesh\r\n[11]; though it is expressly asserted by Strabo that they had no\r\ncheese [12]. The later Britons, however, well knew how to make the\r\nbest use of the cow, since, as appears from the laws of _Hoel Dda_,\r\nA.D. 943, this animal was a creature so essential, so common and\r\nuseful in Wales, as to be the standard in rating fines, &c. [13].\r\n\r\nHengist, leader of the Saxons, made grand entertainments for king\r\nVortigern [14], but no particulars have come down to us; and\r\ncertainly little exquisite can be expected from a people then so\r\nextremely barbarous as not to be able either to read or write.\r\n'Barbari homines a septentrione, (they are the words of Dr. Lister)\r\ncaseo et ferina subcruda victitantes, omnia condimenta adjectiva\r\nrespuerunt' [15].\r\n\r\nSome have fancied, that as the Danes imported the custom of hard and\r\ndeep drinking, so they likewise introduced the practice of\r\ngormandizing, and that this word itself is derived from _Gormund_,\r\nthe name of that Danish king whom Ælfred the Great persuaded to be\r\nchristened, and called Æthelstane [16], Now 'tis certain that\r\nHardicnut stands on record as an egregious glutton [17], but he is\r\nnot particularly famous for being a _curious Viander_; 'tis true\r\nagain, that the Danes in general indulged excessively in feasts and\r\nentertainments [18], but we have no reason to imagine any elegance\r\nof Cookery to have flourished amongst them. And though Guthrum, the\r\nDanish prince, is in some authors named _Gormundus_ [19]; yet this is\r\nnot the right etymology of our English word _Gormandize_, since it is\r\nrather the French _Gourmand_, or the British _Gormod_ [20]. So that\r\nwe have little to say as to the Danes.\r\n\r\nI shall take the later English and the Normans together, on account\r\nof the intermixture of the two nations after the Conquest, since, as\r\nlord Lyttelton observes, the English accommodated them elves to the\r\nNorman manners, except in point of temperance in eating and drinking,\r\nand communicated to them their own habits of drunkenness and\r\nimmoderate feasting [21]. Erasmus also remarks, that the English in\r\nhis time were attached to _plentiful and splendid tables_; and the\r\nsame is observed by Harrison [22]. As to the Normans, both William I.\r\nand Rufus made grand entertainments [23]; the former was remarkable\r\nfor an immense paunch, and withal was so exact, so nice and curious\r\nin his repasts [24], that when his prime favourite William Fitz-\r\nOsberne, who as steward of the household had the charge of the Cury,\r\nserved him with the flesh of a crane scarcely half-roasted, he was so\r\nhighly exasperated, that he lifted up his fist, and would have\r\nstrucken him, had not Eudo, appointed _Dapiser_ immediately after,\r\nwarded off the blow [25].\r\n\r\n_Dapiser_, by which is usually understood _steward of the king's\r\nhousehold_ [26], was a high officer amongst the Normans; and\r\n_Larderarius_ was another, clergymen then often occupying this post,\r\nand sometimes made bishops from it [27]. He was under the _Dapiser_,\r\nas was likewise the _Cocus Dominicæ Coquinæ_, concerning whom, his\r\nassistants and allowances, the _Liber Niger_ may be consulted [28].\r\nIt appears further from _Fleta_, that the chief cooks were often\r\nproviders, as well as dressers, of victuals [29]. But _Magister\r\nCoquinæ_, who was an esquire by office, seems to have had the care of\r\npourveyance, A.D. 1340 [30], and to have nearly corresponded with\r\nour _clerk of the kitchen_, having authority over the cooks [31].\r\nHowever, the _Magnus Coquus_, _Coquorum Præpositus_, _Coquus Regius_,\r\nand _Grans Queux_, were officers of considerable dignity in the\r\npalaces of princes; and the officers under them, according to Du\r\nFresne, were in the French court A.D. 1385, much about the time that\r\nour Roll was made, 'Queus, Aideurs, Asteurs, Paiges, Souffleurs,\r\nEnfans, Saussiers de Commun, Saussiers devers le Roy, Sommiers,\r\nPoulliers, Huissiers' [32].\r\n\r\nIn regard to religious houses, the Cooks of the greater foundations\r\nwere officers of consequence, though under the Cellarer [33], and if\r\nhe were not a monk, he nevertheless was to enjoy the portion of a\r\nmonk [34]. But it appears from Somner, that at Christ Church,\r\nCanterbury, the _Lardyrer_ was the first or chief cook [35]; and this\r\nofficer, as we have seen, was often an ecclesiastic. However, the\r\ngreat Houses had Cooks of different ranks [36]; and manors and\r\nchurches [37] were often given _ad cibum_ and _ad victum monachorum_\r\n\r\n[38]. A fishing at Lambeth was allotted to that purpose [39].\r\n\r\nBut whether the Cooks were Monks or not, the _Magistri Coquinæ_,\r\nKitcheners, of the monasteries, we may depend upon it, were always\r\nmonks; and I think they were mostly ecclesiastics elsewhere: thus\r\nwhen Cardinal Otto, the Pope's legate, was at Oxford, A. 1238, and\r\nthat memorable fray happened between his retinue and the students,\r\nthe _Magister Coquorum_ was the Legate's brother, and was there\r\nkilled [40]. The reason given in the author, why a person so nearly\r\nallied to the Great Man was assigned to the office, is this, 'Ne\r\nprocuraretur aliquid venenorum, quod nimis [i.e. valde] timebat\r\nlegatus;' and it is certain that poisoning was but too much in vogue\r\nin these times, both amongst the Italians and the good people of this\r\nisland [41]; so that this was a post of signal trust and confidence.\r\nAnd indeed afterwards, a person was employed to _taste_, or _take\r\nthe assaie_, as it was called [42], both of the messes and the water\r\nin the ewer [43], at great tables; but it may be doubted whether a\r\nparticular person was appointed to this service, or it was a branch\r\nof the _Sewer's_ and cup-bearer's duty, for I observe, the _Sewer_ is\r\nsometimes called _Prægustator_ [44], and the cup-bearer tastes the\r\nwater elsewhere [45]. The religious houses, and their presidents, the\r\nabbots and priors, had their days of _Gala_, as likewise their halls\r\nfor strangers, whom, when persons of rank, they often entertained\r\nwith splendour and magnificence. And as for the secular clergy,\r\narchbishops and bishops, their feasts, of which we have some upon\r\nrecord [46], were so superb, that they might vie either with the\r\nregal entertainments, or the pontifical suppers of ancient Rome\r\n(which became even proverbial [47]), and certainly could not be\r\ndressed and set out without a large number of Cooks [48]. In short,\r\nthe satirists of the times before, and about the time of, the\r\nReformation, are continually inveighing against the high-living of\r\nthe bishops and clergy; indeed luxury was then carried to such an\r\nextravagant pitch amongst them, that archbishop Cranmer, A. 1541,\r\nfound it necessary to bring the secular clergy under some reasonable\r\nregulation in regard to the furnishing of their tables, not excepting\r\neven his own [49].\r\n\r\nAfter this historical deduction of the _Ars coquinaria_, which I\r\nhave endeavoured to make as short as possible, it is time to say\r\nsomething of the Roll which is here given to the public, and the\r\nmethods which the Editor has pursued in bringing it to light.\r\n\r\nThis vellum Roll contains 196 _formulæ_, or recipes, and belonged\r\nonce to the earl of Oxford [50]. The late James West esquire bought\r\nit at the Earl's sale, when a part of his MSS were disposed of; and\r\non the death of the gentleman last mentioned it came into the hands\r\nof my highly-esteemed friend, the present liberal and most\r\ncommunicative possessor. It is presumed to be one of the most ancient\r\nremains of the kind now in being, rising as high as the reign of king\r\nRichard II. [51]. However, it is far the largest and most copious\r\ncollection of any we have; I speak as to those times. To establish\r\nits authenticity, and even to stamp an additional value upon it, it\r\nis the identical Roll which was presented to queen Elizabeth, in the\r\n28th year of her reign, by lord Stafford's heir, as appears from the\r\nfollowing address, or inscription, at the end of it, in his own\r\nhand writing:\r\n\r\n  'Antiquum hoc monumentum oblatum et missum\r\n  est majestati vestræ vicesimo septimo die mensis\r\n  Julij, anno regni vestri fælicissimi vicesimo viij ab\r\n  humilimo vestro subdito, vestræq majestati fidelissimo\r\n  E. Stafford,\r\n  Hæres domus subversæ Buckinghamiens.' [52]\r\n\r\nThe general observations I have to make upon it are these: many\r\narticles, it seems, were in vogue in the fourteenth century, which\r\nare now in a manner obsolete, as cranes, curlews, herons, seals [53],\r\nporpoises, &c. and, on the contrary, we feed on sundry fowls which\r\nare not named either in the Roll, or the Editor's MS. [54] as quails,\r\nrails, teal, woodcocks, snipes, &c. which can scarcely be numbered\r\namong the _small birds_ mentioned 19. 62. 154. [55]. So as to fish,\r\nmany species appear at our tables which are not found in the Roll,\r\ntrouts, flounders, herrings, &c. [56]. It were easy and obvious to\r\ndilate here on the variations of taste at different periods of time,\r\nand the reader would probably not dislike it; but so many other\r\nparticulars demand our attention, that I shall content myself with\r\nobserving in general, that whereas a very able _Italian_ critic,\r\n_Latinus Latinius_, passed a sinister and unfavourable censure on\r\ncertain seemingly strange medlies, disgusting and preposterous messes,\r\nwhich we meet with in _Apicius_; Dr. _Lister_ very sensibly replies\r\nto his strictures on that head, 'That these messes are not\r\nimmediately to be rejected, because they may be displeasing to some.\r\n_Plutarch_ testifies, that the ancients disliked _pepper_ and the\r\nsour juice of lemons, insomuch that for a long time they only used\r\nthese in their wardrobes for the sake of their agreeable scent, and\r\nyet they are the most wholesome of all fruits. The natives of the\r\n_West Indies_ were no less averse to _salt_; and who would believe\r\nthat _hops_ should ever have a place in our common beverage [57], and\r\nthat we should ever think of qualifying the sweetness of malt,\r\nthrough good housewifry, by mixing with it a substance so egregiously\r\nbitter? Most of the _American_ fruits are exceedingly odoriferous,\r\nand therefore are very disgusting at first to us _Europeans_: on the\r\ncontrary, our fruits appear insipid to them, for want of odour. There\r\nare a thousand instances of things, would we recollect them all,\r\nwhich though disagreeable to taste are commonly assumed into our\r\nviands; indeed, _custom_ alone reconciles and adopts sauces which are\r\neven nauseous to the palate. _Latinus Latinius_ therefore very\r\nrashly and absurdly blames _Apicius_, on account of certain\r\npreparations which to him, forsooth, were disrelishing.' [58] In\r\nshort it is a known maxim, that _de gustibus non est disputandum_;\r\n\r\nAnd so Horace to the same purpose:\r\n\r\n  'Tres mihi convivæ prope dissentire videntur,\r\n  Poscentes vario multum diversa palato.\r\n  Quid dem? quid non dem? renuis tu quod jubet alter.\r\n  Quod petis, id sane est invisum acidumque duobus.'\r\n                         Hor. II. Epist. ii.\r\n\r\nAnd our Roll sufficiently verifies the old observation of\r\nMartial--_ingeniosa gula est_.\r\n\r\n[Addenda: after _ingeniosa gula est_, add, 'The _Italians_ now eat\r\nmany things which we think perfect carrion. _Ray_, Trav. p. 362. 406.\r\nThe _French_ eat frogs and snails. The _Tartars_ feast on horse-flesh,\r\nthe _Chinese_ on dogs, and meer _Savages_ eat every thing.\r\n_Goldsmith_, Hist. of the Earth, &c. II. p. 347, 348. 395. III. p.\r\n297. IV. p. 112. 121, &c.']\r\n\r\nOur Cooks again had great regard to the eye, as well as the taste,\r\nin their compositions; _flourishing_ and _strewing_ are not only\r\ncommon, but even leaves of trees gilded, or silvered, are used for\r\nornamenting messes, see No. 175 [59]. As to colours, which perhaps\r\nwould chiefly take place in suttleties, blood boiled and fried (which\r\nseems to be something singular) was used for dying black, 13. 141.\r\nsaffron for yellow, and sanders for red [60]. Alkenet is also used\r\nfor colouring [61], and mulberries [62]; amydon makes white, 68; and\r\nturnesole [63] _pownas_ there, but what this colour is the Editor\r\nprofesses not to know, unless it be intended for another kind of\r\nyellow, and we should read _jownas_, for _jaulnas_, orange-tawney. It\r\nwas for the purpose of gratifying the sight that _sotiltees_ were\r\nintroduced at the more solemn feasts. Rabelais has comfits of an\r\nhundred colours.\r\n\r\nCury, as was remarked above, was ever reckoned a branch of the Art\r\nMedical; and here I add, that the verb _curare_ signifies equally to\r\ndress victuals [64], as to cure a distemper; that every body has\r\nheard of _Doctor Diet, kitchen physick_, &c. while a numerous band of\r\nmedical authors have written _de cibis et alimentis_, and have always\r\nclassed diet among the _non-naturals_; so they call them, but with\r\nwhat propriety they best know. Hence Junius '[Greek: Diaita] Græcis\r\nest victus, ac speciatim certa victus ratio, qualis a _Medicis_ ad\r\ntuendam valetudinem præscribitur [65].' Our Cooks expressly tell us,\r\nin their proem, that their work was compiled 'by assent and avysement\r\nof maisters of phisik and of philosophie that dwellid in his [the\r\nKing's] court' where _physik_ is used in the sense of medecine,\r\n_physicus_ being applied to persons prosessing the Art of Healing\r\nlong before the 14th century [66], as implying _such_ knowledge and\r\nskill in all kinds of natural substances, constituting the _materia\r\nmedica_, as was necessiary for them in practice. At the end of the\r\nEditor's MS. is written this rhyme,\r\n\r\n  Explicit coquina que est optima medicina [67].\r\n\r\nThere is much relative to eatables in the _Schola Salernitana_; and\r\nwe find it ordered, that a physcian should over-see the young\r\nprince's wet-nurse at every meal, to inspect her meat and drink [68].\r\n\r\nBut after all the avysement of physicians and philosophers, our\r\nprocesses do not appear by any means to be well calculated for the\r\nbenefit of recipients, but rather inimical to them. Many of them are\r\nso highly seasoned, are such strange and heterogeneous compositions,\r\nmeer olios and gallimawfreys, that they seem removed as far as\r\npossible from the intention of contributing to health; indeed the\r\nmesses are so redundant and complex, that in regard to herbs, in No.\r\n6, no less than ten are used, where we should now be content with two\r\nor three: and so the sallad, No. 76, consists of no less than 14\r\ningredients. The physicians appear only to have taken care that\r\nnothing directly noxious was suffered to enter the forms. However, in\r\nthe Editor's MS. No. 11, there is a prescription for making a _colys_,\r\nI presume a _cullis_, or Invigorating broth; for which see Dodsley's\r\nOld Plays, vol. II. 124. vol. V. 148. vol. VI. 355. and the several\r\nplays mentioned in a note to the first mentioned passage in the Edit.\r\n1780 [69].\r\n\r\nI observe further, in regard to this point, that the quantities of\r\nthings are seldom specified [70], but are too much left to the taste\r\nand judgement of the cook, if he should happen to be rash and\r\ninconsiderate, or of a bad and undistinguishing taste, was capable of\r\ndoing much harm to the guests, to invalids especially.\r\n\r\nThough the cooks at Rome, as has been already noted, were amongst the\r\nlowest slaves, yet it was not so more anciently; Sarah and Rebecca\r\ncook, and so do Patroclus and Automedon in the ninth Iliad. It were\r\nto be wished indeed, that the Reader could be made acquainted with\r\nthe names of our _master-cooks_, but it is not in the power of the\r\nEditor to gratify him in that; this, however, he may be assured of,\r\nthat as the Art was of consequence in the reign of Richard, a prince\r\nrenowned and celebrated in the Roll [71], for the splendor and\r\nelegance of his table, they must have been persons of no\r\ninconsiderable rank: the king's first and second cooks are now\r\nesquires by their office, and there is all the reason in the world to\r\nbelieve they were of equal dignity heretofore [72]. To say a word of\r\nking _Richard_: he is said in the proeme to have been 'acounted the\r\nbest and ryallest vyaund [curioso in eating] of all esten kynges.'\r\nThis, however, must rest upon the testimony of our cooks, since it\r\ndoes not appear otherwise by the suffrage of history, that he was\r\nparticularly remarkable for his niceness and delicacy in eating, like\r\nHeliogabalus, whose favourite dishes are said to have been the\r\ntongues of peacocks and nightingales, and the brains of parrots and\r\npheasants [73]; or like Sept. Geta, who, according to Jul.\r\nCapitolinus [74], was so curious, so whimsical, as to order the\r\ndishes at his dinners to consist of things which all began with the\r\nsame letters. Sardanapalus again as we have it in Athenæus [75], gave\r\na _præmium_ to any one that invented and served him with some novel\r\ncate; and Sergius Orata built a house at the entrance of the Lucrine\r\nlake, purposely for the pleasure and convenience of eating the\r\noysters perfectly fresh. Richard II is certainly not represented in\r\nstory as resembling any such epicures, or capriccioso's, as these\r\n[76]. It may, however, be fairly presumed, that good living was not\r\nwanting among the luxuries of that effeminate and dissipated reign.\r\n\r\n[Addenda: after _ninth Iliad_, add, 'And Dr. _Shaw_ writes, p. 301,\r\nthat even now in the East, the greatest prince is not ashamed to\r\nfetch a lamb from his herd and kill it, whilst the princess is\r\nimpatient till she hath prepared her fire and her kettle to dress\r\nit.']\r\n\r\n[Addenda: after _heretofore_ add, 'we have some good families in\r\nEngland of the name of _Cook_ or _Coke_. I know not what they may\r\nthink; but we may depend upon it, they all originally sprang from\r\nreal and professional cooks; and they need not be ashamed of their\r\nextraction, any more than the _Butlers_, _Parkers_, _Spencers_, &c.']\r\n\r\nMy next observation is, that the messes both in the roll and the\r\nEditor's MS, are chiefly soups, potages, ragouts, hashes, and the\r\nlike hotche-potches; entire joints of meat being never _served_, and\r\nanimals, whether fish or fowl, seldom brought to table whole, but\r\nhacked and hewed, and cut in pieces or gobbets [77]; the mortar also\r\nwas in great request, some messes being actually denominated from it,\r\nas _mortrews_, or _morterelys_ as in the Editor's MS. Now in this\r\nstate of things, the general mode of eating must either have been\r\nwith the spoon or the fingers; and this perhaps may have been the\r\nreason that spoons became an usual present from gossips to their\r\ngod-children at christenings [78]; and that the bason and ewer, for\r\nwashing before and after dinner, was introduced, whence the _ewerer_\r\nwas a great officer [79], and the _ewery_ is retained at Court to\r\nthis day [80]; we meet with _damaske water_ after dinner [81], I\r\npresume, perfumed; and the words _ewer_ &c. plainly come from the\r\nSaxon eþe or French eau, _water_.\r\n\r\nThus, to return, in that little anecdote relative to the Conqueror\r\nand William Fitz-Osbern, mentioned above, not the crane, but _the\r\nflesh of the crane_ is said to have been under-roasted. Table, or\r\ncase-knives, would be of little use at this time [82], and the art of\r\ncarving so perfectly useless, as to be almost unknown. In about a\r\ncentury afterwards, however, as appears from archbishop Neville's\r\nentertainment, many articles were served whole, and lord Wylloughby\r\nwas the carver [83]. So that carving began now to be practised, and\r\nthe proper terms devised. Wynken de Worde printed a _Book of\r\nKervinge_, A. 1508, wherein the said terms are registered [84]. 'The\r\nuse of _forks_ at table, says Dr. Percy, did not prevail in England\r\nland till the reign of James I. as we learn from a remarkable passage\r\nin _Coryat_ [85]'; the passage is indeed curious, but too long to be\r\nhere transcribed, where brevity is so much in view; wherefore I shall\r\nonly add, that forks are not now used in some parts of Spain [86].\r\nBut then it may be said, what becomes of the old English hospitaliy\r\nin this case, the _roast-beef of Old England_, so much talked of? I\r\nanswer, these bulky and magnificent dishes must have been the product\r\nof later reigns, perhaps of queen Elizabeth's time, since it is plain\r\nthat in the days of Rich. II. our ancestors lived much after the\r\nFrench fashion. As to hospitality, the households of our Nobles were\r\nimmense, officers, retainers, and servants, being entertained almost\r\nwithout number; but then, as appears from the Northumberland Book,\r\nand afterwards from the household establisliment of the prince of\r\nWales, A. 1610, the individuals, or at least small parties, had their\r\n_quantum_, or ordinary, served out, where any good oeconomy was kept,\r\napart to themselves [87]. Again, we find in our Roll, that great\r\nquantities of the respective viands of the hashes, were often made at\r\nonce, as No. 17, _Take hennes or conynges_. 24, _Take hares_. 29,\r\n_Take pygges_. And 31, _Take gees_, &c. So that hospitality and\r\nplentiful housekeeping could just as well be maintained this way, as\r\nby the other of cumbrous unwieldy messes, as much as a man could\r\ncarry.\r\n\r\nAs the messes and sauces are so complex, and the ingredients\r\nconsequently so various, it seems necessary that a word should be\r\nspoken concerning the principal of them, and such as are more\r\nfrequently employed, before we pass to our method of proceeding in\r\nthe publication.\r\n\r\nButter is little used. 'Tis first mentioned No. 81, and occurs but\r\nrarely after [88]; 'tis found but once in the Editor's MS, where it\r\nis written _boter_. The usual substitutes for it are oil-olive and\r\nlard; the latter is frequently called _grees_, or _grece_, or\r\n_whitegrece_, as No. 18. 193. _Capons in Grease_ occur in Birch's\r\nLife of Henry prince of Wales, p. 459, 460. and see Lye in Jun. Etym.\r\nv. _Greasie_. Bishop Patrick has a remarkable passage concerning\r\nthis article: 'Though we read of cheese in _Homer_, _Euripides_,\r\n_Theocritus_, and others, yet they never mention _butter_: nor hath\r\nAristotle a word of it, though he hath sundry observations about\r\ncheese; for butter was not a thing then known among the _Greeks_;\r\nthough we see by this and many other places, it was an ancient food\r\namong the eastern people [89].' The Greeks, I presume, used oil\r\ninstead of it, and butter in some places of scripture is thought to\r\nmean only cream. [90]\r\n\r\nCheese. See the last article, and what is said of the old Britons\r\nabove; as likewise our Glossary.\r\n\r\nAle is applied, No. 113, et alibi; and often in the Editor's MS. as\r\n6, 7, &c. It is used instead of wine, No. 22, and sometimes along\r\nwith bread in the Editor's MS. [91] Indeed it is a current opinion\r\nthat brewing with hops was not introduced here till the reign of king\r\nHenry VIII. [92] _Bere_, however, is mentioned A. 1504. [93]\r\n\r\nWine is common, both red, and white, No. 21. 53. 37. This article\r\nthey partly had of their own growth, [94] and partly by importation\r\nfrom France [95] and Greece [96]. They had also Rhenish [97], and\r\nprobably several other sorts. The _vynegreke_ is among the sweet\r\nwines in a MS of Mr. Astle.\r\n\r\nRice. As this grain was but little, if at all, cultivated in England,\r\nit must have been brought from abroad. Whole or ground-rice enters\r\ninto a large number of our compositions, and _resmolle_, No. 96, is a\r\ndirect preparation of it.\r\n\r\nAlkenet. _Anchusa_ is not only used for colouring, but also fried and\r\nyfoundred, 62. yfondyt, 162. i. e. dissolved, or ground. 'Tis thought\r\nto be a species of the _buglos_.\r\n\r\nSaffron. Saffrwm, Brit. whence it appears, that this name ran through\r\nmost languages. Mr. Weever informs us, that this excellent drug was\r\nbrought hither in the time of Edward III. [98] and it may be true;\r\nbut still no such quantity could be produced here in the next reign\r\nas to supply that very large consumption which we see made of it in\r\nour Roll, where it occurs not only as an ingredient in the processes,\r\nbut also is used for colouring, for flourishing, or garnishing. It\r\nmakes a yellow, No. 68, and was imported from Egypt, or Cilicia, or\r\nother parts of the Levant, where the Turks call it Safran, from the\r\nArabic Zapheran, whence the English, Italians, French, and Germans,\r\nhave apparently borrowed their respective names of it. The Romans\r\nwere well acquainted with the drug, but did not use it much in the\r\nkitchen [99]. Pere Calmet says, the Hebrews were acquainted with\r\nanise, ginger, saffron, but no other spices [100].\r\n\r\nPynes. There is some difficulty in enucleating the meaning of this\r\nword, though it occurs so often. It is joined with dates, No. 20. 52.\r\nwith honey clarified, 63. with powder-fort, saffron, and salt, 161.\r\nwith ground dates, raisins, good powder, and salt, 186. and lastly\r\nthey are fried, 38. Now the dish here is _morree_, which in the\r\nEditor's MS. 37, is made of mulberries (and no doubt has its name\r\nfrom them), and yet there are no mulberries in our dish, but pynes,\r\nand therefore I suspect, that mulberries and pynes are the same, and\r\nindeed this fruit has some resemblance to a pynecone. I conceive\r\n_pynnonade_, the dish, No. 51, to be so named from the pynes therein\r\nemployed; and quære whether _pyner_ mentioned along with powder-fort,\r\nsaffron, and salt, No. 155, as above in No. 161, should not be read\r\n_pynes_. But, after all, we have cones brought hither from Italy full\r\nof nuts, or kernels, which upon roasting come out of their _capsulæ_,\r\nand are much eaten by the common people, and these perhaps may be the\r\nthing intended.\r\n\r\n[Addenda: after _intended_. add, 'See _Ray_, Trav. p. 283. 407. and\r\n_Wright's_ Trav. p. 112.']\r\n\r\nHoney was the great and universal sweetner in remote antiquity, and\r\nparticularly in this island, where it was the chief constituent of\r\n_mead_ and _metheglin_. It is said, that at this day in _Palestine_\r\nthey use honey in the greatest part of their ragouts [101]. Our cooks\r\nhad a method of clarifying it, No. 18. 41. which was done by putting\r\nit in a pot with whites of eggs and water, beating them well together;\r\nthen setting it over the fire, and boiling it; and when it was ready\r\nto boil over to take it and cool it, No. 59. This I presume is called\r\n_clere honey_, No. 151. And, when honey was so much in use, it\r\nappears from Barnes that _refining_ it was a trade of itself [102].\r\n\r\nSugar, or Sugur [103], was now beginning here to take place of honey;\r\nhowever, they are used together, No. 67. Sugar came from the Indies,\r\nby way of Damascus and Aleppo, to Venice, Genoa, and Pisa, and from\r\nthese last places to us [104]. It is here not only frequently used,\r\nbut was of various sorts, as _cypre_, No. 41. 99. 120. named probably\r\nfrom the isle of Cyprus, whence it might either come directly to us,\r\nor where it had received some improvement by way of refining. There\r\nis mention of _blanch-powder or white sugar_, 132. They, however,\r\nwere not the same, for see No. 193. Sugar was clarified sometimes\r\nwith wine [105].\r\n\r\nSpices. _Species_. They are mentioned in general No. 133, and _whole\r\nspices_, 167, 168. but they are more commonly specified, and are\r\nindeed greatly used, though being imported from abroad, and from so\r\nfar as Italy or the Levant (and even there must be dear), some may\r\nwonder at this: but it shouid be considered, that our Roll was\r\nchiefly compiled for the use of noble and princely tables; and the\r\nsame may be said of the Editor's MS. The spices came from the same\r\npart of the world, and by the same route, as sugar did. The _spicery_\r\nwas an ancient department at court, and had its proper officers.\r\n\r\nAs to the particular sorts, these are,\r\n\r\nCinamon. _Canell_. 14. 191. _Canel_, Editor's MS. 10. _Kanell_, ibid.\r\n32. is the Italian _Canella_. See Chaucer. We have the flour or\r\npowder, No. 20. 62. See Wiclif. It is not once mentioned in Apicius.\r\n\r\nMacys, 14. 121. Editor's MS. 10. _Maces_, 134. Editor's MS. 27. They\r\nare used whole, No. 158. and are always expressed plurally, though we\r\nnow use the singular, _mace_. See Junii Etym.\r\n\r\nCloves. No. 20. Dishes are flourished with them, 22. 158. Editor's MS.\r\n10. 27. where we have _clowys gylofres_, as in our Roll, No. 104.\r\n_Powdour gylofre_ occurs 65. 191. Chaucer has _clowe_ in the singular,\r\nand see him v. Clove-gelofer.\r\n\r\nGalyngal, 30. and elsewhere. Galangal, the long rooted cyperus [106],\r\nis a warm cardiac and cephalic. It is used in powder, 30. 47. and was\r\nthe chief ingredient in _galentine_, which, I think, took its name\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nPepper. It appears from Pliny that this pungent, warm seasoning, so\r\nmuch in esteem at Rome [107], came from the East Indies [108], and,\r\nas we may suppose, by way of Alexandria. We obtained it no doubt, in\r\nthe 14th century, from the same quarter, though not exactly by the\r\nsame route, but by Venice or Genoa. It is used both whole, No. 35,\r\nand in powder, No. 83. And long-pepper occurs, if we read the place\r\nrightly, in No. 191.\r\n\r\nGinger, gyngyn. 64. 136. alibi. Powder is used, 17. 20. alibi. and\r\nRabelais IV. c. 59. the white powder, 131. and it is the name of a\r\nmess, 139. quære whether _gyngyn_ is not misread for _gyngyr_, for\r\nsee Junii Etym. The Romans had their ginger from Troglodytica [109].\r\n\r\nCubebs, 64. 121. are a warm spicy grain from the east.\r\n\r\nGrains of Paradice, or _de parys_, 137. [110] are the greater\r\ncardamoms.\r\n\r\nNoix muscadez, 191. nutmegs.\r\n\r\nThe caraway is once mentioned, No. 53. and was an exotic from _Caria_,\r\nwhence, according to Mr. Lye, it took its name: 'sunt semina, inquit,\r\n_carri_ vel _carrei_, sic dicti a Caria, ubi copiosissimè nascitur\r\n[111].'\r\n\r\nPowder-douce, which occurs so often, has been thought by some, who\r\nhave just peeped into our Roll, to be the same as sugar, and only a\r\ndifferent name for it; but they are plainly mistaken, as is evident\r\nfrom 47. 51. 164. 165. where they are mentioned together as different\r\nthings. In short, I take powder-douce to be either powder of\r\ngalyngal, for see Editor's MS II. 20. 24, or a compound made of\r\nsundry aromatic spices ground or beaten small, and kept always ready\r\nat hand in some proper receptacle. It is otherwise termed _good\r\npowders_, 83. 130. and in Editor's MS 17. 37. 38 [112]. or _powder_\r\nsimply, No. 169, 170. _White powder-douce_ occurs No. 51, which seems\r\nto be the same as blanch-powder, 132. 193. called _blaynshe powder_,\r\nand bought ready prepared, in Northumb. Book, p. 19. It is sometimes\r\nused with powder-fort, 38. 156. for which see the next and last\r\narticle.\r\n\r\nPowder-fort, 10. 11. seems to be a mixture likewise of the warmer\r\nspices, pepper, ginger, &c. pulverized: hence we have _powder-fort of\r\ngynger, other of canel_, 14. It is called _strong powder_, 22. and\r\nperhaps may sometimes be intended by _good powders_. If you will\r\nsuppose it to be kept ready prepared by the vender, it may be the\r\n_powder-marchant_, 113. 118. found joined in two places with powder-\r\ndouce. This Speght says is what gingerbread is made of; but Skinner\r\ndisapproves this explanation, yet, says Mr. Urry, gives none of his\r\nown.\r\n\r\nAfter thus travelling through the most material and most used\r\ningredients, the _spykenard de spayn_ occurring only once, I shall\r\nbeg leave to offer a few words on the nature, and in favour of the\r\npresent publication, and the method employed in the prosecution of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Take þe chese and of flessh of capouns, or of hennes\r\n& hakke smal and grynde hem smale inn a morter, take mylke of\r\nalmandes with þe broth of freysh beef. oþer freysh flessh, & put the\r\nflessh in þe mylke oþer in the broth and set hem to þe fyre, & alye\r\nhem with flour of ryse, or gastbon, or amydoun as chargeaunt as þe\r\nblank desire, & with zolks of ayren and safroun for to make hit zelow,\r\nand when it is dressit in dysshes with blank desires; styk aboue\r\nclowes de gilofre, & strawe powdour of galyugale above, and serue it\r\nforth.]\r\n\r\nThe common language of the _formulæ_, though old and obsolete, as\r\nnaturally may be expected from the age of the MS, has no other\r\ndifficulty in it but what may easily be overcome by a small degree of\r\npractice and application [113]: however, for the further illustration\r\nof this matter, and the satisfaction of the curious, a _fac simile_\r\nof one of the recipes is represented in the annexed plate. If here\r\nand there a hard and uncouth term or expression may occur, so as to\r\nstop or embarrass the less expert, pains have been taken to explain\r\nthem, either in the annotations under the text, or in the Index and\r\nGlossary, for we have given it both titles, as intending it should\r\nanswer the purpose of both [114]. Now in forming this alphabet, as\r\nit would have been an endless thing to have recourse to all our\r\nglossaries, now so numerous, we have confined ourselves, except\r\nperhaps in some few instances, in which the authorities are always\r\nmentioned, to certain contemporary writers, such as the Editor's MS,\r\nof which we shall speak more particularly hereafter, Chaucer, and\r\nWiclif; with whom we have associated Junius' Etymologicon Anglicanum.\r\n\r\nAs the abbreviations of the Roll are here retained, in order to\r\nestablish and confirm the age of it, it has been thought proper to\r\nadopt the types which our printer had projected for Domesday-Book,\r\nwith which we find that our characters very nearly coincide.\r\n\r\nThe names of the dishes and sauces have occasioned the greatest\r\nperplexity. These are not only many in number, but are often so\r\nhorrid and barbarous, to our ears at least, as to be inveloped in\r\nseveral instances in almost impenetrable obscurity. Bishop Godwin\r\ncomplains of this so long ago as 1616 [115]. The _Contents_ prefixed\r\nwill exhibit at once a most formidable list of these hideous names\r\nand titles, so that there is no need to report them here. A few of\r\nthese terms the Editor humbly hopes he has happily enucleated, but\r\nstill, notwithstanding all his labour and pains, the argument is in\r\nitself so abstruse at this distance of time, the helps so few, and\r\nhis abilities in this line of knowledge and science so slender and\r\nconfined, that he fears he has left the far greater part of the task\r\nfor the more sagacious reader to supply: indeed, he has not the least\r\ndoubt, but other gentlemen of curiosity in such matters (and this\r\npublication is intended for them alone) will be so happy as to clear\r\nup several difficulties, which appear now to him insuperable. It must\r\nbe confessed again, thatthe Editor may probably have often failed in\r\nthose very points, which he fancies and flatters himself to have\r\nelucidated, but this he is willing to leave to the candour of the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nNow in regard to the helps I mentioned; there is not much to be\r\nlearnt from the Great Inthronization-feast of archbishop Robert\r\nWinchelsea, A. 1295, even if it were his; but I rather think it\r\nbelongs to archbishop William Warham, A. 1504 [116]. Some use,\r\nhowever, has been made of it.\r\n\r\nRalph Bourne was installed abbot of St. Augustine's, near Canterbury,\r\nA. 1309; and William Thorne has inserted a list of provisions bought\r\nfor the feast, with their prices, in his Chronicle [117].\r\n\r\nThe Great Feast at the Inthronization of George Nevile archbishop of\r\nYork, 6 Edward IV. is printed by Mr. Hearne [118], and has been of\r\ngood service.\r\n\r\nElizabeth, queen of king Henry VII. was crowned A. 1487, and the\r\nmesses at the dinner, in two courses, are registered in the late\r\nedition of Leland's Collectenea, A. 1770 [119], and we have profited\r\nthereby.\r\n\r\nThe Lenten Inthronization-feast of archbishop William Warham, A. 1504\r\n[120], given us at large by Mr. Hearne [121], has been also consulted.\r\n\r\nThere is a large catalogue of viands in Rabelais, lib. iv. cap. 59.\r\n60. And the English translation of Mr. Ozell affording little\r\ninformation, I had recourse to the French original, but not to much\r\nmore advantage.\r\n\r\nThere is also a Royal Feast at the wedding of the earl of Devonshire,\r\nin the Harleian Misc. No. 279, and it has not been neglected.\r\n\r\nRandle Holme, in his multifarious _Academy of Armory_, has an\r\nalphabet of terms and dishes [122]; but though I have pressed him\r\ninto the service, he has not contributed much as to the more\r\ndifficult points.\r\n\r\nThe Antiquarian Repertory, vol. II. p. 211, exhibits an\r\nentertainment of the mayor of Rochester, A. 1460; but there is little\r\nto be learned from thence. The present work was printed before No. 31\r\nof the Antiquarian Repertory, wherein some ancient recipes in Cookery\r\nare published, came to the Editor's hand.\r\n\r\nI must not omit my acknowledgments to my learned friend the present\r\ndean of Carlisle, to whom I stand indebted for his useful notes on\r\nthe Northumberland-Household Book, as also for the book itself.\r\n\r\nOur chief assistance, however, has been drawn from a MS belonging to\r\nthe Editor, denoted, when cited, by the signature _MS. Ed._ It is a\r\nvellum miscellany in small quarto, and the part respecting this\r\nsubject consists of ninety-one English recipes (or _nyms_) in cookery.\r\nThese are disposed into two parts, and are intituled, 'Hic incipiunt\r\nuniversa servicia tam de carnibus quam de pissibus.' [123] The second\r\npart, relates to the dressing of fish, and other lenten fare, though\r\nforms are also there intermixed which properly belong to flesh-days.\r\nThis leads me to observe, that both here, and in the Roll, messes are\r\nsometimes accommodated, by making the necessary alterations, both to\r\nflesh and fish-days. [124] Now, though the subjects of the MS are\r\nvarious, yet the hand-writing is uniform; and at the end of one of\r\nthe tracts is added, 'Explicit massa Compoti, Anno Dñi M'lo CCC'mo\r\noctogesimo primo ipso die Felicis et Audacti.' [125], i.e. 30 Aug.\r\n1381, in the reign of Rich. II. The language and orthography accord\r\nperfectly well with this date, and the collection is consequently\r\ncontemporary with our Roll, and was made chiefly, though not\r\naltogether, for the use of great tables, as appears from the\r\n_sturgeon_, and the great quantity of venison therein prescribed for.\r\n\r\nAs this MS is so often referred to in the annotations, glossary, and\r\neven in this preface, and is a compilation of the same date, on the\r\nsame subject, and in the same language, it has been thought adviseable\r\nto print it, and subjoin it to the Roll; and the rather, because it\r\nreally furnishes a considerable enlargement on the subject, and\r\nexhibits many forms unnoticed in the Roll.\r\n\r\nTo conclude this tedious preliminary detail, though unquestionably a\r\nmost necessary part of his duty, the Editor can scarcely forbear\r\nlaughing at himself, when he reflects on his past labours, and recollects\r\nthose lines of the poet Martial;\r\n\r\n  Turpe est difficiles habere nugas,\r\n  Et stultus labor est ineptiarum. II. 86.\r\n\r\nand that possibly mesdames _Carter_ and _Raffald_, with twenty others,\r\nmight have far better acquitted themselves in the administration of\r\nthis province, than he has done. He has this comfort and satisfaction,\r\nhowever, that he has done his best; and that some considerable\r\nnames amongst the learned, Humelbergius, Torinus, Barthius, our\r\ncountryman Dr. Lister, Almeloveen, and others, have bestowed no less\r\npains in illustrating an author on the same subject, and scarcely of\r\nmore importance, the _Pseudo-Apicius_.\r\n\r\n[1] If, according to Petavius and Le Clerc, the world was created in\r\n    autumn, when the fruits of the earth were both plentiful and in the\r\n    highest perfection, the first man had little occasion for much\r\n    culinary  knowledge; roasting or boiling the cruder productions, with\r\n    modes of preserving those which were better ripened, seem to be all\r\n    that was necessary for him in the way of _Cury_, And even after he\r\n    was displaced from Paradise, I conceive, as many others do, he was\r\n    not permitted the use of animal food [Gen. i. 29.]; but that this was\r\n    indulged to us, by an enlargement of our charter, after the Flood,\r\n    Gen. ix, 3. But, without wading any further in the argument here, the\r\n    reader is referred to Gen. ii. 8. seq. iii. 17, seq. 23.\r\n\r\n    [Addenda: add 'vi. 22. where _Noah_ and the beasts are to live on the\r\n    same food.']\r\n[2] Genesis xviii. xxvii. Though their best repasts, from the\r\n    politeness of the times, were called by the simple names of _Bread_,\r\n    or a _Morsel of bread_, yet they were not unacquainted with modes of\r\n    dressing flesh, boiling, roasting, baking; nor with sauce, or\r\n    seasoning, as salt and oil, and perhaps some aromatic herbs.

Dice at this time\r\nwere very small: a large parcel of them were found under the floor of\r\nthe hall of one of the Temples, about 1764, and were so minute as to\r\nhave dropt at times through the chinks or joints of the boards. There\r\nwere near 100 pair of ivory, scarce more than two thirds as large as\r\nour modern ones. The hall was built in the reign of Elizabeth. To\r\n_quare_ is from the Fr. quarrer; and _quayre_ or _quaire_, subst. in\r\nChaucer, Skelton, p. 91. 103. is a book or pamphlet, from the paper\r\nbeing in the quarto form. See Annal.

It took its name from\r\n_Hippocrates' sleeve_, the bag or strainer, through which it was\r\npassed. Skinner, v. Claret; and Chaucer. or as Junius suggests,\r\nbecause strained _juxta doctrinam Hippocratis_. The Italians call it\r\n_hipocrasso_. It seems not to have differed much from _Piment_, or\r\nPigment (for which see Chaucer) a rich spiced wine which was sold by\r\nVintners about 1250. Mr. Topham's MS. Hippocras was both white and\r\nred. Rabelais, IV. c. 59. and I find it used for sauce to lampreys.\r\nIbid. c. 60.\r\n\r\nThere is the process at large for making ypocrasse in a MS. of my\r\nrespectable Friend Thomas Astle, esq. p. 2. which we have thought\r\nproper to transcribe, as follows:\r\n\r\n'To make Ypocrasse for lords with gynger, synamon, and graynes sugour,\r\nand turefoll: and for comyn pepull gynger canell, longe peper, and\r\nclaryffyed hony. Loke ye have feyre pewter basens to kepe in your\r\npouders and your ypocrasse to ren ynne. and to vi basens ye muste\r\nhave vi renners on a perche as ye may here see. and loke your poudurs\r\nand your gynger be redy and well paryd or hit be beton in to poudr.\r\nGynger colombyne is the best gynger, mayken and balandyne be not so\r\ngood nor holsom.... now thou knowist the propertees of Ypocras. Your\r\npoudurs must be made everyche by themselfe, and leid in a bledder in\r\nstore, hange sure your perche with baggs, and that no bagge twoyche\r\nother, but basen twoyche basen. The fyrst bagge of a galon, every on\r\nof the other a potell. Fyrst do in to a basen a galon or ij of\r\nredwyne, then put in your pouders, and do it in to the renners, and\r\nso in to the seconde bagge, then take a pece and assay it. And yef\r\nhit be eny thyng to stronge of gynger alay it withe synamon, and yef\r\nit be strong of synamon alay it withe sugour cute. And thus schall ye\r\nmake perfyte Ypocras. And loke your bagges be of boltell clothe, and\r\nthe mouthes opyn, and let it ren in v or vi bagges on a perche, and\r\nunder every bagge a clene basen. The draftes of the spies is good for\r\nsewies. Put your Ypocrase in to a stanche wessell, and bynde opon the\r\nmouthe a bleddur strongly, then serve forthe waffers and Ypocrasse.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDENDA.\r\n\r\n[ The addenda have been placed above within the text where appropriate,\r\nlabeled \"Addenda:\". ]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\nSince the foregoing sheets were printed off, the following very curious\r\nRolls have happily fallen into the Editor's hand, by the favour of John\r\nCharles Brooke, Esq. Somerset Herald.  They are extracted from a MS.\r\nbelonging to the family of Nevile of Chevet, near Wakefield, com. Ebor. and\r\nthence copied, under the direction of the Rev. Richard Kay, D.D. Prebendary\r\nof Durham.\r\n\r\nThese Rolls are so intimately connected with our subject, as exhibiting the\r\ndishes of which our Roll of _Cury_ teaches dressing and preparation, that\r\nthey must necessarily be deemed a proper appendix to it.  They are moreover\r\namusing, if not useful, in another respect; _viz_. as exhibiting the\r\ngradual prices of provisions, from the dates of our more ancient lists, and\r\nthe time when these Rolls were composed, in the reign of Henry VIII.  For\r\nthe further illustration of this subject, and extract from the old\r\nAccount-Book of _Luton_, 19 _Hen_. VIII is super-added; where the prices of\r\nthings in the South, at the same period, may be seen.  And whoever pleases\r\nto go further into this matter of _prices_, may compare them with the\r\nparticulars and expence of a dinner at Stationer's-Hall, A.D. 1556. which\r\nappeared in the St. James's Chronicle of April 22, 1780.\r\n\r\nWe cannot help thinking that, upon all accounts, the additions here\r\npresented to our friends must needs prove exceedingly acceptable to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROLLS of PROVISIONS,\r\n\r\nWith their PRICES, DISHES, &c.\r\n\r\nTemp.
