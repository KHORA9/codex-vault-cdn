Clark Company\r\n\r\n1909\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo my beloved wife, Margaret Van Cortlandt Ogden this volume is\r\naffectionately dedicated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe controversies of which Bartholomew de Las Casas was, for more than\r\nhalf a century, the central figure no longer move us, for slavery, as a\r\nsystem, is dead and the claim of one race or of men to hold property\r\nrights in the flesh and blood of another finds no defenders. We may study\r\nthe events of his tempestuous life with serene temper, solely for the\r\nimportant light on the history of human progress.\r\n\r\nIt is sought in the present work to assign to the noblest Spaniard who\r\never landed in the western world, his true place among those great spirits\r\nwho have defended and advanced the cause of just liberty, and, at the same\r\ntime, to depict the conditions under which the curse of slavery was first\r\nintroduced to North America.  It in no degree lessens the glory of Las\r\nCasas to insist upon the historical fact that he was neither the first\r\nSpaniard to defend the liberty of the American Indians, nor was he alone\r\nin sustaining the struggle, to which the best years of a life that all but\r\nspanned a century were exclusively dedicated.\r\n\r\nBorn in an age of both civil and religious despotism, his voice was\r\nincessantly raised in vindication of the inherent and inalienable right of\r\nevery human being to the enjoyment of liberty.  He was preeminently a man\r\nof action to whom nothing human was foreign, and whose gift of universal\r\nsympathy co-existed with an uncommon practical ability to devise\r\ncorrective reforms that commanded the attention and won the approval of\r\nthe foremost statesmen and moralists of his time.  True, he also had a\r\nvision of Utopia, and his flights of imaginative altruism frequently\r\nelevated him so far above the realities of this world, that the\r\nincorrigible frailties of human nature seemed to vanish from his\r\ncalculations, but when the rude awakening came, he neither forsook the\r\nfight nor failed to profit by the bitter lesson.\r\n\r\nWhen his dream of an ideal colony, peopled by perfect Christians labouring\r\nfor the conversion of model Indians, adorned with primitive virtues, was\r\ndispelled, he girded his loins to meet his enemies with undiminished\r\ncourage, on the battle-ground they themselves had selected.  His moral\r\ntriumph was complete, and he issued from every encounter victorious.  The\r\nfruits of his victories were not always immediate or satisfying, nor did\r\nhe live to see the practical application of all his principles, yet the\r\nfigure of this devoted champion of freedom stands on a pedestal of\r\nenduring fame, of which the foundations rest on the eternal homage of all\r\nlovers of justice and liberty, and it is the figure of a victor, who\r\nserved God and loved his fellow-men.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen in the following narrative, that monks of the Order of St.\r\nDominic were the first to defend the liberty of the Indian and his moral\r\ndignity as a reasonable being, endowed with free will and understanding.\r\nAssociated in the popular conception with the foundation and extension of\r\nthe Inquisition, the Dominicans may appear in a somewhat unfamiliar guise\r\nas torch-bearers of freedom in the vanguard of Spanish colonial expansion\r\nin America, but such was the fact.  History has made but scant and\r\ninfrequent mention of these first obscure heroes, who faced obloquy and\r\neven risked starvation in the midst of irate colonists, whose avarice and\r\nbrutality they fearlessly rebuked in the name of religion and humanity:\r\nthey sank, after lives of self-immolation, into nameless graves, sometimes\r\nfalling victims to the blind violence of the very Indians whose cause they\r\nchampioned—protomartyrs of liberty in the new world.\r\n\r\nThe conditions under which Las Casas and his co-workers laboured were\r\ndiscouragingly adverse.  The mailed conquerors and eager treasure-seekers\r\nwho followed in the wake of Columbus were consumed by two ruthless\r\npassions—avarice and ambition.\r\n\r\nAvarice and ambition alone, however, do not adequately explain their\r\nundertakings, and we find among them a fierce zeal for Christian\r\npropaganda strikingly disproportionate to their fitness to expound the\r\ndoctrines or illustrate the virtues of the Christian religion.  They seem\r\nto have frequently compounded for their sins of sensuality and their deeds\r\nof blood by championing the unity and purity of the faith—two things that\r\nwere held to be of paramount importance, especially in Spain, where to be\r\noutside formal communion with the Church was to be either a Jew or a\r\nMahometan, or in other words, an enemy of God.\r\n\r\nPerverted as their conception of the true spirit of Christian propaganda\r\nmay appear to us, it may not be doubted that many of these men were\r\nanimated by honest missionary zeal and actually thought their singular\r\nmethods would procure the conversion of the Indians.  On the other hand,\r\nfew of those who left Spain, animated by high motives, resisted the\r\nprevalent seductions of avarice and ambition, amidst conditions so\r\nsingularly favourable to their gratification, and we find Las Casas\r\ndenouncing, as ridiculous and hypocritical, the pretensions to solicitude\r\nfor the spread of religion, under cover of which the colonists sought to\r\nobtain royal sanction for the systems of slavery and serfage they had\r\ninaugurated.\r\n\r\nThe essential differences observable in the Spanish and English colonies\r\nin America are traceable to the directly contrary systems of government\r\nprevailing at that time in the mother countries.  All nations of Aryan\r\nstock possessed certain fundamental features of government, inherited from\r\na common origin.  Climatic and geographical conditions operated with\r\ndivers other influences to produce race characteristics, from which the\r\nseveral nations of modern Europe were gradually evolved.  Within each of\r\nthese nations, the inherited political principles common to all of them\r\nwere unequally and diversely developed.  The forms of political liberty\r\ncontinued to survive in Spain, but, under Charles V., the government\r\nbecame, in practice, an absolute monarchy, the liberties of the Córtes and\r\nthe Councils being gradually overshadowed by the ever-growing prerogatives\r\nof the Crown.\r\n\r\nIn England, on the contrary, the share of the people in the government\r\nwas, in spite of opposition, of steady growth, only interrupted by\r\noccasional periods of suspension, while the power of the Crown declined.\r\nThese conditions were repeated in the colonies of the two nations, with\r\nsome variations of form that were due to local influences in each of them.\r\nThe Spanish colonies relied entirely on the Crown and were, from the\r\noutset, over-provided with royal officials from the grade of viceroy to\r\nthat of policeman, and even with clergy, all of whom were appointed by the\r\nking’s sole authority and were removable at his pleasure.  These\r\nsettlements generally owed their existence to private enterprise, having\r\nbeen founded by explorers and treasure-seekers, but in none of them did\r\nthe colonists enjoy any political rights or liberties, other than what it\r\npleased the sovereign to grant them.\r\n\r\nThey were ruled through a bureaucracy, of which were the members were\r\nrarely efficient and usually corrupt, hence it followed that Spaniards\r\nwere bereft of any incentive to colonise, save one—their individual\r\naggrandisement.  Their inherited habit of obedience reconciled them to the\r\nabsence of any share in the direction and control of the colony in which\r\ntheir lot was thrown, but such a system of administration deprived them of\r\nthe possibility of acquiring experience in the management of public\r\naffairs.  Its effects were pernicious and far-reaching, for when the\r\ncolonies outgrew the bonds that linked them to Spain, their people,\r\nignorant of the meaning of true liberty, and untrained in self-government,\r\nfollowed their instinct of blind submission to direction from above, and\r\nfell an easy prey to demagogues.  Deprived of participation in framing the\r\nlaws, the colonists employed their ingenuity in devising means to evade or\r\nnullify those which they deemed obnoxious or contrary to their interests,\r\nand constant practice soon perfected their perverted activities in this\r\ndirection, until obstruction and procrastination were erected into a\r\nsystem, against which even royal decrees were powerless.\r\n\r\nThe results that followed were logical and inevitable.  Laws devoid of\r\nsufficient force to ensure their effective execution fail to afford the\r\nrelief or protection their enactment designs to provide, and ineffectual\r\nlaws are worse than no laws at all, for their defeat weakens the\r\ngovernment that enacts them and tends to bring all law into contempt.\r\nConditions of distance, the corruption of the colonial officials, the\r\nconflict between local authorities, and the astutely organised opposition\r\nof the colonists repeatedly thwarted the honest efforts of the home\r\ngovernment to safeguard the liberty of the Indians, which the Spanish\r\nsovereigns had defined to be natural and inalienable, definitions that had\r\nreceived the solemn sanction of the Roman pontiffs.\r\n\r\nSpanish and English methods of dealing with the aboriginal tribes of\r\nAmerica offer as sharp a contrast as do their respective systems of\r\ncolonial government.  Whether the devil himself possesses ingenuity in\r\ninflicting suffering, superior to that displayed by the Spanish conquerors\r\nand their immediate followers, has never been demonstrated.  The gentle,\r\nunresisting natives of the West Indian Islands, whose delicate\r\nconstitutions incapacitated them to bear labours their masters exacted of\r\nthem, were their first victims.  The descriptions penned as of the\r\ncruelties practised on these harmless creatures dispense me from the\r\nungrateful task of attempting to depict them.  But, while the individual\r\nIndian suffered inhuman tortures at the hands of the Spaniards, the race\r\nsurvived and, by amalgamation with the invaders, it continues to\r\npropagate, and to rise in the scale of humanity.\r\n\r\nThe English colonists found different conditions waiting them when they\r\nlanded on the northern coasts of America, where the Indian tribes were\r\nneither gentle nor submissive.  Two absolutely alien and hostile races\r\nfaced one another, of which the higher professed small concern for the\r\namelioration of the lower, while amalgamation was excluded by the mutual\r\npride of race and the instinctive enmity that divided them.  There was no\r\nenslaving of Indians, and the torturing was done entirely by the savages,\r\nbut, while the English method spared the individual Indian the suffering\r\nhis defenceless brother in the south had to endure, the aboriginal races\r\nhave everywhere receded before the relentless advance of civilisation.\r\nThe battle between the civilised and savage peoples has been\r\nuncompromising; the stronger of the Indian nations have gone down,\r\nfighting, while the remnants of such tribes as survive remain herded on\r\nthe ever-encroaching frontiers of a civilisation in which a tolerable\r\nplace has been but tardily provided for them.  We cannot escape the\r\nconclusion that our treatment of the races we have displaced and\r\nexterminated has been as systematically and remorselessly destructive as\r\nwas the spasmodic and ofttimes sportive cruelty operated by the Spaniards.\r\nThe Spanish national conscience recognised the obligation of civilising\r\nand Christianising the Indians, a task which Spaniards finally\r\naccomplished.  The Spanish sovereigns were honestly desirous of protecting\r\ntheir new subjects, and the injustice inflicted on the latter was done in\r\ndefiance of the laws they enacted, as well as of public opinion in Spain,\r\nwhich condemned it as severely as could the most advanced humanitarian\r\nsentiment of our own times.\r\n\r\nLas Casas voiced this condemnation and organised a masterly campaign of\r\neducation on the subject of the proper method of dealing with the Indians.\r\nHe suffered and endured for their sakes, while the men whose selfish and\r\ninhuman undertakings he thwarted poured the vilest abuse and calumny upon\r\nhim.  Nature had mercifully endowed him with no sensitiveness save for the\r\nsufferings of the oppressed, and he was as much a born fighter as the\r\nfiercest conqueror who ever landed in Spanish America.  He waged a moral\r\nbattle, animated by only the noblest motives, and in his damning\r\narraignment of his countrymen, he eschewed personalities and, with a\r\ncharity as rare as it was becoming to his sacerdotal character, he\r\noccupied himself exclusively with the principles at stake, leaving the\r\npunishment of the criminals to the final justice of God.\r\n\r\nThe records of the earliest peoples of whom history preserves\r\nknowledge—Chaldeans, Egyptians, Phenicians, and Arabians—show that slavery\r\nhas existed the remotest antiquity.  Slavery was the common fate of\r\nprisoners of war in the time of Homer; Alexander sold the inhabitants of\r\nThebes, and the Spartans reduced the entire population of Helos to\r\nservitude, so that Helot came to be synonymous with slave, while one of\r\nthe laws inscribed on the Twelve Tables of Rome gave a creditor the right\r\nto sell an insolvent debtor into slavery to satisfy his claim.  Wealthy\r\nRomans frequently possessed slaves, over whose lives and fortunes the\r\nowners were absolute masters.\r\n\r\nChristianity first taught the unity and equality of mankind; salvation was\r\nfor bond and free, for Jew and Gentile; the immortality of each human soul\r\nwas affirmed; each man’s body was defined of the Holy Ghost and a new\r\ndignity was conferred by these novel doctrines on universal mankind, which\r\nthe lowly shared equally with the mighty.  The Christian conception of\r\nliberty and equality however, referred more to the moral than to the\r\nmaterial order.  “The truth shall make you free.”  It was not subversive\r\nof existing mundane conditions, but taught the duty of rendering Caesar\r\nhis due, and of the servant being subject to his lord, the woman to her\r\nhusband, and children to their parents.  The early Christians too\r\nsincerely despised the prizes of this world—including the greatest of all,\r\nliberty—to struggle for possession of any of them; unresponsive to the\r\nlure of earthly honours and treasures, they fixed their desires on things\r\neternal.  Slavery continued to coexist with Christianity: children were\r\nsold publicly in the markets of Bristol during the reign of King Alfred,\r\nand the villeins were bound to the glebe, changing masters with the\r\ntransfer of the property from one proprietor to another.  The laws of\r\nRichard III. and of Edward VI. dealt severely, not only with slaves, but\r\nwith all deserters, runaway apprentices, and other recalcitrant\r\ndependents, who were reduced to partial or perpetual slavery for the most\r\ntrivial offences.  The condition of these various categories of bondmen,\r\nhowever, was more one of serfage and vassalage, the ancient system of\r\nslavery that had culminated in the Roman Empire having been modified by\r\nthe mild doctrines of Christianity and the gradual spread of the new\r\ncivilisation.\r\n\r\nFrom the discoveries along the west coast of Africa, made by the\r\nPortuguese in the first half of the fifteenth century, may be dated the\r\nrevival of the trade in slaves for purely commercial purposes.  Portugal\r\nand southern Spain were thenceforward regularly supplied with cargoes of\r\nnegroes, numbering between seven and eight hundred yearly.  The promoter\r\nof these expeditions was Prince Henry of Portugal, third son of John I.\r\nand Philippa, daughter of John Gaunt, though in justice to that amiable\r\nand learned prince, it must be borne in mind that the capture and sale of\r\nnegroes was merely incidental to explorations the unary purpose of which\r\nwas purely scientific.  Prince Henry held that the negroes thus captured\r\ninto his dominions were amply compensated for the loss of such uncertain\r\nliberty as they enjoyed, by receiving the light of Christian teaching.  It\r\nseems evident that most of them merely changed masters and probably gained\r\nby the exchange,  for they were born subjects of barbarous rulers,  in\r\nlands where the traffic in slaves was active. Many were obtained from the\r\nArabs and Moors, who already held them in bondage and, without minimising\r\nthe sufferings inseparable from all slave-trade, we may not unreasonably\r\nassume that those who reached Portugal and Spain were the least\r\nunfortunate of all their kind.\r\n\r\nLas Casas, being a native of Andalusia, was familiar with this\r\nslave-trade, for Seville was well provided with domestic slaves, whose lot\r\nwas not a particularly hard one.  So much a matter of course was the\r\npresence of these negroes in Spain, that he never admits he had never duly\r\nconsidered their condition or the matter of their capture and sale.  It\r\nthus fell, as will be later described, that he assented to the demands of\r\nthe Spanish colonists in the Indies for permission to import Africans from\r\nSpain to take the place of the rapidly perishing Indians.  In the\r\nrecommendation of this measure, several later historians pretended to\r\ndiscover the origin of negro slavery in America, despite the authenticated\r\nfact that sixteen years before Las Casas advised the importation of\r\nnegroes into the Indies, the slave-trade had been begun; nor is it\r\nunlikely that other negroes had been brought to America by their Spanish\r\nowners at a still earlier date.  Although the original intention had been\r\nto import only Christian negroes, this provision of the law had been\r\neasily and persistently evaded, under the leniency and indifference of the\r\nauthorities, who connived at such profitable violation.  It was contended\r\nthat the labour problem in the colonies admitted of no other solution; the\r\ninefficient Indians were rapidly disappearing, of white labour there was\r\nnone, and, to respond to the demand for labourers, the Dominican Order, in\r\n1510, sanctioned the importation of negroes direct from Africa, still\r\nmaintaining the proviso that all who were Jews or Mahometans should be\r\nexcluded.\r\n\r\nOvando had reported the Indians as so naturally indolent that no wages\r\ncould induce them to work.  He represented them as flying from contact\r\nwith the Spaniards, leaving Queen Isabella to suppose that their avoidance\r\nwas due to a natural antipathy to white men.  The Queen, in her zeal to\r\nfulfil the conditions imposed on her conscience by the papal bull of\r\ndonation, was easily tricked by the representations of the Governor,\r\ncoinciding as they did with those of other advisers of influence and high\r\nstation, into assenting to the enforced labour of the Indians.\r\n\r\nHer reason is explicitly stated to be “because we desire that the Indians\r\nshould be converted to our holy catholic faith and should learn doctrine.”\r\nFor this motive, and with many restrictions as to the period of work and\r\nthe kinds of labour to be performed by the natives, the gentle treatment\r\nto be shown them, and the wages to be paid them, the royal order was\r\nfinally issued.  It is evident that the misinformed and deluded sovereign\r\nregarded the labour of the Indians almost as a pretext for bringing them\r\ninto contact with the Spaniards, solely for their own spiritual and moral\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of America, following as it did so closely upon the\r\ndevelopment of the negro slave traffic, had given great impetus to it and,\r\nduring the three succeeding centuries, Portuguese, Italians, Spaniards,\r\nEnglish, and Dutch quickly became close rivals for an ignominious primacy\r\nin the most heinous of crimes.  The highest figures I have found, assign\r\nto England one hundred and thirty vessels engaged in the trade, and\r\nforty-two thousand negroes landed in the Americas during the year 1786\r\nfrom English ships.  The annals of slavery are so uniformly black, that\r\namong all the nations there is not found one guiltless, to cast the first\r\nstone.  More than their due proportion of obloquy has been visited upon\r\nthe Spaniards for their part in the extension of slavery and for the\r\noffences against justice and humanity committed in the New World, almost\r\nas though they alone deserved the pillory.  Consideration of the facts\r\nhere briefly touched upon should serve to restrain and temper the\r\ncondemnation that irreflection has too often allowed us to heap\r\nexclusively upon them for their share in these great iniquities.  If they\r\nwere pitiless towards individuals, we have shown ourselves merciless\r\ntowards the race; as a nation, they recognised moral duties and\r\nresponsibilities towards Indian peoples which our forefathers ignored or\r\nrepudiated; the failure of the benevolent laws enacted by Spanish\r\nsovereigns was chiefly due to the avarice and brutality of individuals,\r\nwho were able to elude both the provisions of the law and the punishment\r\ntheir crimes merited.  On the other hand, Las Casas thrilled two worlds\r\nwith his denunciations of crimes which our own enlightened country\r\ncontinued for three centuries to protect.  His apostolate was prompted,\r\nnot by the horrors he witnessed nor by merely emotional sympathy, but by\r\nmeditation on the fundamental principles of justice.  The Scripture texts\r\nthat startled him from the moral lethargy in which he had lived during\r\neight years, revealed to him the blasphemy involved in the performance of\r\nacts of formal piety and works of benevolence, by men who degraded God’s\r\nimage in their fellow-men and sacrificed hecatombs of human victims to\r\ngratify their greed for riches.\r\n\r\nFrom the hour of his awakening, we follow him during sixty years of\r\nceaseless activity such as few men have ever displayed.  His vehemence\r\ntormented his adversaries beyond endurance, and they charged him with\r\nstirring up dissensions and strife in the colonies, ruining trade,\r\ndiscouraging emigration to the Indies, and, by his importunate and\r\nreckless propaganda, with inciting the Indians to rebellion.  Granting\r\nthat some abuses existed, they argued that his methods for redressing them\r\nwere more pernicious than the evils themselves; prudent measures should be\r\nemployed, not the radical and precipitate method of the fanatical friar,\r\nand time would gradually do the rest.  Men who argued such as the Bishop\r\nof Burgos and Lope Conchillos, were large holders of encomienda\r\nproperties, who objected to having their sources of income disturbed.  Las\r\nCasas penetrated the flimsy disguise they sought to throw over their real\r\npurpose, to smother the truth the better to consolidate and extend their\r\ninterests, and realising that his only hope of success lay in keeping the\r\nsubject always to the front, he pursued his inexorable course of teaching,\r\nwriting, journeying to America to impeach judges and excommunicate\r\nrefractory colonists, and thence back again to Spain to publish his\r\naccusations broadcast and petition redress from the King and his Councils.\r\n\r\nThe most respectable of his contemporary opponents in the New World was\r\nToribio de Benevente, under his popular Indian name of Motolinia. In 1555,\r\nMotolinia wrote a letter to in which he dealt severely with the\r\naccusations of Las Casas, whom he described as a restless, turbulent man,\r\nwho wandered from one colony to another, provoking disturbances and\r\nscandals.  He confined himself to a general denial of the alleged\r\noutrages, without attempting to refute them by presenting proofs of their\r\nfalsity, while his indignation was prompted by his patriotism.  He was\r\nshocked that a Spaniard should publish such accusations against his own\r\ncountrymen; things which would be read by foreigners and even by Indians,\r\nand thus bring reproach on the Spanish national honour.  He expressed\r\nastonishment that the Emperor permitted the publication and circulation of\r\nsuch books, taxing their author with wilful exaggeration and false\r\nstatements, and pointing out that the accusations brought more dishonour\r\non the monarch than on his subjects.\r\n\r\nMotolinia was a devout man, whose apostolic life among the Indians won him\r\nhis dearly loved name, equivalent to “the poor man” or poverello of St.\r\nFrancis, but with all his virtues, he belonged to the type of churchman\r\nthat dreads scandal above everything else.  The methods of Las Casas\r\nscandalised him; it wounded his patriotism that Spaniards should be held\r\nup to the execration of Christendom, and he rightly apprehended that such\r\ndamaging information, published broadcast, would serve as a formidable\r\nweapon in the hands of the adversaries of his church and country.  It must\r\nalso be remembered that he lived in Mexico, where Las Casas admits that\r\nthe condition of the Indians was better than in the islands and other\r\nparts of the coast country.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of Burgos and Lope Conchillos will be seen to be fair exponents\r\nof the bureaucratic type of opponents to the reforms Las Casas advocated.\r\nThe Bishop in particular appears in an unsympathetic light throughout his\r\nlong administration of American affairs.  Of choleric temper, his manners\r\nwere aggressive and authoritative, and he used his high position to\r\nadvance his private interests.  He was a disciplinarian, a bureaucrat\r\naverse to novelties and hostile to enthusiasms.  He anticipated\r\nTalleyrand’s maxim “Sûrtout pas de zole,” and to be nagged at by a\r\nmeddlesome friar was intolerable to him.  Such men were probably no more\r\nconsciously inhuman than many otherwise irreproachable people of all\r\ntimes, who complacently pocket dividends from deadly industries, without a\r\nthought to the obscure producers of their wealth or to the conditions of\r\nmoral and physical degradation amidst which their brief lives are spent.\r\n\r\nThe most formidable of all the adversaries of Las Casas was Gines de\r\nSepulveda.  A man of acute intellect, vast learning, and superlative\r\neloquence, this practiced debater stood for theocracy and despotism,\r\ndefending the papal and royal claims to jurisdiction over the New World.\r\nIn striving to establish a dual tyranny over the souls and bodies of its\r\ninhabitants, he concerned himself not at all with the human aspect of the\r\nquestion nor did he even pretend to controvert the facts with which his\r\nopponent met him.  He was exclusively engaged in upholding the abstract\r\nright of the Pope and the Spanish sovereigns to exercise spiritual and\r\ntemporal jurisdiction over heathen, as well as Catholic peoples. To impugn\r\nthis principle was, according to Sepulveda, to strike at the very\r\nfoundations of Christendom; that a few thousands of pagans, more or less,\r\nsuffered and perished, was of small importance, compared with the\r\nmaintenance of this elemental principal.  First conquer and then convert,\r\nwas his maxim.  His thesis constitutes the very negation of Christianity.\r\n\r\n                 [Illustration: Juan Gines de Sepúlveda]\r\n\r\n                         Juan Gines de Sepúlveda\r\n\r\n     From the engraving by J. Barcelon, after the drawing of J. Maca.\r\n\r\n\r\nLas Casas repeatedly challenged his opponents to refute his allegations or\r\nto contradict his facts and, in a letter to Carranza de Miranda in 1556,\r\nhe wrote:\r\n\r\n“It is moreover deplorable that, after having denounced this destruction\r\nof peoples to our sovereigns and their councils a thousand times during\r\nforty years, nobody has yet dreamed of proving the contrary and, after\r\nhaving done so, of punishing me by the shame of a retraction.  The royal\r\narchives are filled with records of trials, reports, denunciations, and a\r\nquantity of other proofs of the assassinations…There exists also positive\r\nevidence of the immense population of Hispaniola—greater than that of all\r\nSpain—and of the islands of Cuba, Jamaica, and more than forty other\r\nislands, where neither animals nor vegetation survive.  These countries\r\nare larger than the space that separates us from Persia, and the\r\nterra-firma is twice as considerable…I defy any living man, if he be not a\r\nfool, to dare deny what I allege, and to prove the contrary.”\r\n\r\nHis enemies were devoid of scruples, and unsparingly used every means to\r\nnullify his influence and destroy his credit.  He was ridiculed as a\r\nmadman—a monomaniac on the subject of Indians and their rights; his\r\nplainly stated facts were branded as exaggerations, though nobody accepted\r\nhis challenge to contradict them.  Such tactics alternated with others,\r\nfor he was also described as a heretic, as disloyal and unpatriotic,\r\nseeking to impeach the validity of Spanish sovereignty in the Indies and\r\nto bring ruin on the national interests.\r\n\r\nThe missionary period of the life of Las Casas in America ended with his\r\nreturn to Spain in 1549 and the resignation of his episcopal see that\r\nfollowed in 1552.  From that time may be dated the third and last period\r\nof his life, which was marked by his literary activity, for, though he\r\nnever again visited America, his vigilance and energy in defending the\r\ninterests of the Indians underwent no diminution.  His writings were\r\nextraordinarily luminous; and all he wrote treated of but one subject.  He\r\nhimself declared that his sole reason for writing more than two thousand\r\npages in Latin was to proclaim the truth concerning Indians, who were\r\ndefamed by being represented as devoid of human understanding and brutes.\r\nThis defamation of an entire race outraged his sense of justice, and the\r\nvery excesses of the colonists provoked the reaction that was destined to\r\nultimately check them.\r\n\r\nOf all his numerous works the two that are of great and permanent interest\r\nto students of American history, the _Historia General_ and the _Historia\r\nApologetica de las Indias_, were originally designed to form a single\r\nwork.  The writer informs us he began this work in 1527 while he resided\r\nin the Dominican monastery near Puerto de Plata.\r\n\r\nFabié writes that his examination of the original manuscripts of the two\r\nworks preserved in the library of the Spanish Academy of History in\r\nMadrid, shows that the first chapter of the _Apologetica_ was originally\r\nthe fifty-eighth of the _Historia General_.  Prescott possessed a copy of\r\nthese manuscripts, which is believed to have been burned in Boston in\r\n1872, and other copies still exist in America in the Congressional and\r\nLenox Libraries, and in the Hubert Howe Bancroft collection.\r\n\r\nDuring his constant journeying to and fro, much of the material Las Casas\r\nhad collected for the _Historia General_ was lost and when he began to put\r\nthat work into its actual form—probably in 1552 or 1553—he was obliged to\r\nrely on his memory for many of his facts, while others were drawn from the\r\n_Historia del Almirante, Don Cristobal Colon_, written by the son of\r\nChristopher Columbus, Fernando.\r\n\r\nThe first historian who had access to the original manuscript, in spite of\r\nthe instruction of Las Casas to his executors to withhold them from\r\npublication for a period of forty years after his death, was Herrera, who\r\ndipped plenis manibus into their contents, incorporating entire chapters\r\nin his own work published in 1601.  His book obtained a wide circulation\r\ndespite the fact that it was prohibited in Spain.\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1875-1876 that a complete edition of the _Historia\r\nGeneral_ and the _Apologetica_ was printed in Spanish.  This work was\r\nedited in five volumes by the Marques de la Fuensanta and Señor José\r\nSancho Rayon, and was issued by the Royal Academy of History in Madrid.  A\r\nMexican edition of the _Historia General_ in two volumes, but without the\r\n_Apologetica_, appeared in 1878. The _Historia Apologetica_ treats of the\r\nnatural history, the climate, the flora, fauna, and various products of\r\nthe Indies, as well as of the different races inhabiting the several\r\ncountries; their character, costumes, habits, and forms of government.\r\nThough its purpose bore less directly upon the injustices under which the\r\nnatives suffered, it was none the less educational, the author’s purpose\r\nbeing to put before his countrymen a minute and accurate description of\r\nthe New World and its inhabitants that should vindicate the latter’s right\r\nto equitable treatment at the hands of their conquerors.  Misrepresented\r\nand defamed, as he maintained the Indians were, by the mendacious reports\r\nsent to Spain, Las Casas composed this interesting apology as one part of\r\nhis scheme of defence.  As a monument to his vast erudition, his powers of\r\nobservation, and his talents as a writer, the _Apologetica_ is perhaps the\r\nmost remarkable of all his compositions.\r\n\r\nI append to this present volume an English translation of the most\r\ncelebrated of all the writings of Las Casas; that is, of the short\r\ntreatise published in 1552 in Seville under the title of _Brevissima\r\nRelacion de la Destruycion de las Indias_, and which recited in brief form\r\nhis accusations against the conquerors and his descriptions of the\r\ncruelties that formed the groundwork of all his writings.\r\n\r\nThis was the first of nine tracts, all treating different aspects of the\r\nsame subject.  The full titles of these little books, of which a complete\r\nset is now extremely valuable, may be found in Henry Harrisse, _Notes on\r\nColumbus_, pp. 18-24; also in Brunet’s _Manuel_, the Carter-Brown\r\nCatalogue, and other bibliographical works.\r\n\r\nThe first quarto gothic edition, printed by Trujillo in Seville in 1552,\r\nentitled _Las Obras Brevissima Relacion de la Destruycion de las Indias\r\nOccidentales por los Españoles_, contains seven tracts.  The second\r\nedition, in Barcelona, 1646, bore the title _Las Obras de B. de Las\r\nCasas_, and contains the first five tracts.\r\n\r\nThe _Brevissima Relacion_ was quickly translated into most of the\r\nlanguages of Europe.  A French version, published in Antwerp in 1579, was\r\nentitled _Tyrannies et Cruautés des Espagnols_, par Jacques de Miggrode.\r\n_Le Miroir de la tyrannie Espagnole_, illustrated by seventeen horribly\r\nrealistic engravings by De Bry, contains extracts from several of the nine\r\ntreatises, composed into one work, issued in Amsterdam in 1620. Other\r\neditions followed in Paris in 1635, in Lyons in 1642, and again two others\r\nin Paris in 1697 and 1701: these latter were translated and edited by the\r\nAbbé de Bellegarde.\r\n\r\nThe Italian translation, made by Giacomo Castellani, followed closely the\r\noriginal text, by which it was accompanied; editions were printed in\r\nVenice in 1626, 1630, and 1643, bearing the title _Istoria o Brevissima\r\nRelatione della Distruttione dell’ Indie Occidentali_.  Three different\r\nLatin versions were published as follows: _Narratio regionum Indicarum per\r\nHispanos quosdam devastatarum Verissima_, per B. Casaum, Anno 1582;\r\n_Hispanice, anno vero hoc Lating excusa_, Francofurti, 1597; _Regionum\r\nIndicarum Hispanos olim devastatarum accuratissima descriptio. Editio\r\nnova, correctior…_Heidelbergae 1664. Despite the fact that Las Casas was\r\nthe first and most vehement in denouncing the Spanish conquerors as bad\r\npatriots and worse Christians, whose acts outraged religion and disgraced\r\nSpain, his evidence against his countrymen was diligently spread by all\r\nenemies of his country, especially in England and the Netherlands, while\r\nProtestant controversialists quoted him against popery, and in the conduct\r\nof the conquerors the evidences of the Catholic depravity.\r\n\r\nThe earliest English edition was printed in 1583 under the title of _The\r\nSpanish Colonie or Briefe Chronicle of the Acts and Gestes of the\r\nSpaniardes in the West Indies, called the Newe Worlde, for a space of XL\r\nYeares_.\r\n\r\nJohn Phillips, who was a nephew of Milton, dedicated another version,\r\ncalled _The Tears of the Indians_, to Oliver Cromwell.\r\n\r\nOther English editions, bearing different names, appeared in 1614, 1656,\r\nand 1689.  This last volume bore a truly startling title: _Casas’s horrid\r\nMassacres, Butcheries and Cruelties that Hell and Malice could invent,\r\ncommitted by the Spaniards in the West Indies_.  It doubtless had a large\r\nsale.\r\n\r\nTen years later another edition was printed in London: _An Account of the\r\nVoyages and Discoveries made by the Spaniards in America, containing the\r\nexact Relation hitherto published of their unparalleled cruelties on the\r\nIndians in the Destruction of about Forty Millions of People_.\r\n\r\nThe Netherlands being in revolt, both against the Catholic religion and\r\nthe Spanish government, it is not surprising to find that, in addition to\r\nthe French editions published in Amsterdam and Antwerp, no less than six\r\ndifferent versions were circulated in the Flemish and Dutch vernaculars,\r\nas follows: _Seer cort Verhael van de destructie van d’Indien_, etc.,\r\nBruselas, 1578.  _Spieghel der Spaenscher tyrannye, in West Indien_, etc.,\r\nAmstelredam, 1596.  Another edition of the same followed in the same year\r\nand another in 1607. _Den Spieghel van de Spaenscher Tyrannie_, etc.,\r\nAmstelredam, 1609.  Second edition of the same work in 1621.\r\n\r\nA German translation entitled _Umständige Wahrhafftige Beschreibung der\r\nIndianischen Ländern_, etc., was published at Frankfurt-am-Main, in 1645.\r\n\r\nIt seems hardly necessary, otherwise than as a matter of quaint chronicle,\r\nto notice the fantastic attempt of the Neapolitan writer, Roselli, to\r\nprove that the _Brevissima Relacion_ was not written by Las Casas, but was\r\ncomposed years later by an unknown Frenchman.  This suggestion was too\r\nagreeable to Spanish susceptibilities to lack approval in Spain when it\r\nwas first advanced, but it has since been consigned by general consent to\r\nthe limbo of fanciful inventions.\r\n\r\nThe limits of the present volume exclude the possibility of dealing\r\nadequately with a life so fertile in effort, so rich in achievement, as\r\nthat of Las Casas, and I have confined myself to composing, from an\r\nimmense mass of material, a brief narrative of the acts and events that\r\nseem to best illlustrate his character and to establish his claim to a\r\nforemost place among the great moral heroes of the world.\r\n\r\nI have drawn largely upon his own works, and by frequent and ample\r\nquotations from his speeches I have sought to reveal my hero more\r\nintimitely to my readers.  In reluctantly quitting this field of\r\nprofitable research, I confidently promise myself the satisfaction of one\r\nday seeing literature enriched by an abler presentation of this great\r\ntheme than I have felt myself prepared to undertake.\r\n\r\n                                                       FRANCIS A.

EDUCATION OF BARTHOLOMEW.  HIS FIRST\r\nVOYAGE TO AMERICA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Spanish wars against the Moors, no less than the Crusades against the\r\nMoslems in the Holy Land, enlisted under the Christian standard the\r\nchivalry of Europe, and during the victorious campaign of the King, St.\r\nFerdinand, knights from France, Germany, Italy, and Flanders swelled the\r\nranks of the Spanish forces in Andalusia.  Amongst these foreign noblemen\r\nwere two French gentlemen called Casaus, who claimed descent from Guillen,\r\nViscount of Limoges, one of whom was killed during the siege of Seville.\r\nThe city was taken in 1252, and the surviving Casaus shared in the\r\napportionment of its spoils, and founded there a family, whose descendants\r\nwere destined to become numerous and illustrious.  The name _Casaus_\r\nassumed with time the more Spanish form of Casas, though it continued to\r\nbe spelled in both ways for several centuries, and Bartholomew de Las\r\nCasas himself used both spellings indifferently, especially during the\r\nearlier years of his life.\r\n\r\nThis family ranked among the nobility of Seville and mention is found of\r\nthe confirmation by Alfonso XI. of Guillen de Las Casas in the office of\r\nregidor of the city in 1318.  This same Guillen became Alcalde Mayor of\r\nSeville, and when he died his body was buried in one of the chapels of the\r\ncathedral.  His son, Alfonso, is stated in the chronicles of Don Juan II.\r\n(1409) to have been appointed by the Infante, Don Fernando, to the\r\nlieutenancy of Castillo de Priego, “because he was a valiant man who could\r\nhold it well.”  The names of Guillen and Bartolomé are of frequent\r\nrecurrence in the annals of the family, whose members constantly occupied\r\nthe honourable offices of judge, alcalde mayor, and captain, using the\r\ntitle of Don and intermarrying with the most illustrious families of\r\nAndalusia.\r\n\r\nAccording to indications equivalent to proofs in the absence of any\r\npositive record, from such respectable forebears descended Fray Bartolomé\r\nde Las Casas, who was born in Seville, in 1474.  He himself speaks of\r\nSeville as his native city, and the popular tradition, which fixes the\r\nancient suburb of Triana as his birthplace, was recognised in 1859 by the\r\nmunicipality of Seville assigning the name of Calle del Procurador to one\r\nof the streets of Triana, in honour of the Bishop, whose proudest title\r\nwas Protector (or Procurador) General of the Indians.\r\n\r\nIn his voluminous writings, which teem with information about the men and\r\nevents of his times, the references to his own family history are\r\ninfrequent and imperfect, so that from his own records of his life, very\r\nlittle is to be gleaned concerning it.  His father’s name is variously\r\ngiven by different writers as Alonso, Antonio, and Francisco, while he\r\nhimself states(1) that he was named Pedro, thus contradicting all his\r\nbiographers from Remesal, who was the first, down to Don Antonio Fabié,\r\nwhose admirable _Vida y Escritos_, published in 1879, was the last\r\nimportant contribution on this interesting subject.  Zuñiga, in his\r\n_Discurso de Ortices_, assumed that Alonso de las Casas and Beatriz\r\nMaraver y Cegarra of Triana were the parents of Fray Bartholomew, but in\r\nthe _Anales de Sevilla_, a later work, Francisco is given as the father’s\r\nname.  Neither Llorente nor Gutierrez, who has followed him, gives any\r\nauthority for his affirmation that the father’s name was Antonio, while\r\nQuintana and Fabié accept Remesal(2) and name the father Francisco.\r\n\r\nThe genealogy of the family furnished me by the dean of the Royal College\r\nof Heralds in Madrid shows the descent of Fray Bartholomew through his\r\nfrather, named Francisco, from Alonso de Las Casas, “Señor de Gomez\r\nCardeña, Veinticuatro de Seville, la Villa de Priego” in 1409, and his\r\nwife, Maria Fernandez Marmolejo.  The children of this couple were\r\nGuillen, Isabel, Juan, Pedro, and Francisco, who is described in the\r\ngenealogy as the father of Bartholomew.  Pedro, whom Fray Bartholomew\r\nmentions as his father, is described as _Dean of Seville_, in which case\r\nhis ecclesiastical state would exclude matrimony and legitimate issue.\r\n\r\nFabié affirms that in several passages of his writings Fray Bartholomew\r\nconfirms the assertion of those authors who have designated his father as\r\nFrancisco, but he does not indicate the whereabouts of these passages nor\r\nhave I, in my unaided researches, succeeded in finding them.  The\r\ndescendants of the original founder of the family had multiplied and, by\r\nthe close of the fifteenth century, were divided into many prolific\r\nbranches, hence the difficulty of identifying the unimportant father of an\r\nextraordinarily important son is not wonderful.  Las Casas himself may be\r\nreasonably assumed to have known his own father’s name and we must\r\nconclude, in view of his assertion, that all other authorities, including\r\nthe Royal College of Heralds, are wrong, and that not Francisco, but a\r\nPedro de Las Casas, who was not however Dean of Seville, was the immediate\r\nprogenitor of the illustrious Bishop of Chiapa.\r\n\r\nThe scarcity of positive information concerning his immediate family is\r\nequalled by the paucity of trustworthy details of the first twenty-eight\r\nyears of Fray Bartholomew’s life.  He completed his studies and obtained\r\nthe degree of licentiate in law at the University of Salamanca, the most\r\ncelebrated in Spain, and which ranked high amongst the great seats of\r\nlearning in Europe at that time.  Jurisprudence was divided into the\r\nbranches of Roman law as interpreted by the school of Bologna, and of\r\ncanon law, the principles of which were interwoven with the common\r\npractice, whose severer tendencies they somewhat tempered.  The precepts\r\nof Aristotle as interpreted by scholastics formed the basis of\r\nphilosophical studies, and the Thomistic doctrine was taught by professors\r\nof the Dominican Order.\r\n\r\nIt has been judiciously observed that in that age of growing absolutism,\r\nboth spiritual and temporal, only a skilful Thomistic scholar could have\r\ndiscerned the limits to the legitimate exercise of the royal authority\r\nwhich Las Casas so clearly perceived and so boldly defined in the very\r\npresence of the autocratic sovereigns of Spain.\r\n\r\nGrammar, ethics, physics, and the branches of learning necessary to\r\ncomplete the education of a young man of his social position and mental\r\ncapacity, were doubtless embraced in his course of study.  His use of the\r\nLatin tongue was fluent, though his style has been criticised as\r\ncumbersome and wanting in elegance; certainly his writings abound in\r\ndiffuse generalities, a multiplicity of repetitions, and a vast array of\r\ncitations from Scripture and the classics which render his unexpurgated\r\nmanuscripts wearisome enough to modern readers.  He shared the defects of\r\nmost of his contemporaries in this respect and followed the fashion common\r\nin his times. The training he received in the Spanish schools and the\r\nUniversity, and which he afterwards perfected—as will be seen—by the\r\nstudies he resumed after his profession in the Dominican Order, rendered\r\nformidable as an advocate one whom nature had endowed with a rare gift of\r\neloquence, a passionate temperament, and a robust physical constitution\r\nwhich seems to have been immune to the ills and fatigues that assail less\r\nfavoured mortals.  Gines de Sepulveda, whose forensic encounter with Las\r\nCasas was one of the academic events of the sixteenth century, described\r\nhis adversary in a letter to a friend as “most subtle, most vigilant, and\r\nmost fluent, compared with whom Homer’s Ulysses was inert and stammering.”\r\n\r\nThe father of Las Casas accompanied Christopher Columbus on his second\r\nvoyage to America and acquired profitable interests in the island of\r\nHispaniola.  He returned to Spain in 1496, bringing with him an Indian lad\r\nwhom he sent as a present to his son, who was then a student at Salamanca.\r\n\r\nBartholomew’s ownership of this Indian boy was brief, owing to Queen\r\nIsabella’s intense displeasure when she learned that Columbus had brought,\r\nand permitted to be brought back Indians, as slaves.  Nothing sufficed to\r\nappease the Queen’s indignation that the Admiral should thus dispose of\r\nher new subjects without her leave and authority, and a royal order was\r\npublished from Granada, where the court then was, commanding, under pain\r\nof death, that all those who had brought Indians to Spain as slaves should\r\nsend them back to America.  When Francisco de Bobadilla was sent in 1500\r\nto Hispaniola to supersede Columbus as Governor, all these Indians\r\nreturned with him and Las Casas himself states, “Mine was of the number.”\r\n\r\nThus strangely is the future apostle of freedom first introduced to our\r\nnotice in the guise of a slave-holder, constrained by a royal edict to\r\nsurrender his human property.\r\n\r\nUpon his return from Salamanca to Seville Las Casas found himself, through\r\nhis father’s relations with Columbus, in daily intercourse with the men\r\nwhose voyages and discoveries were thrilling Europe. Amongst these\r\nnavigators was his uncle Francisco de Peñulosa, and it was but natural\r\nthat his eager temperament should catch the adventurous fever which\r\nprevailed throughout Spain and notably in Andalusia.  Salucchi, in his\r\nLatin treatise on Hebrew coins, says that Las Casas accompanied his father\r\non the second voyage of Columbus in 1493 and brought back the Indian slave\r\nhimself.  Llorente, who has been followed by several modern writers,\r\nasserts that his first voyage to America was made with Columbus on his\r\nthird expedition.  He deduces this conclusion from a statement at the\r\nclose of the Thirty Propositions which Las Casas addressed to the Royal\r\nIndia Council in 1547 and from a sentence in the First Motive of his Ninth\r\nRemedy which he presented to the Emperor in 1542.  The first of these\r\npassages reads “Thus, most illustrious Sirs, have I thought since\r\nforty-nine years, during which I have witnessed evil-doings in America and\r\nsince thirty-four years that I have studied law.”  The passage merely\r\nrefers to Columbus having permitted certain Spaniards who had rendered\r\nimportant services during his voyage to bring back each an Indian and\r\nconcludes, “And I obtained one.”\r\n\r\n                   [Illustration: Christopher Columbus]\r\n\r\n                           Christopher Columbus\r\n\r\n      From an engraving by P. Mercuri after a contemporary portrait\r\n\r\n\r\nThe deductions of both these learned writers would seem to require more\r\npositive corroboration.  Not only are they destitute of confirmation, but\r\nin the second chapter of his _Historia General_, Las Casas gives the names\r\nof many persons who did accompany Columbus in 1493, describing several\r\nincidents connected with that expedition and concluding by saying that he\r\nheard all these things “from my father who returned [to America] with him,\r\nwhen he went to found settlements in Hispaniola.”  In the preface which he\r\nwrote in 1552 to accompany the publication of his history, _Destruycion de\r\nlas Indias_, which had been composed ten years earlier, he speaks of his\r\nexperience extending over more than fifty years, but in his _Historia\r\nGeneral_, which is almost a diary of the first half of his life in\r\nAmerica, the first voyage that he mentions is that of Don Nicholas de\r\nOvando in 1502.  Las Casas was most careful in describing every particular\r\nof the events in which he had a part and he nowhere mentions that he\r\naccompanied Columbus on any voyage, whereas he dwells at length upon the\r\nexpedition of Ovando, and in the third chapter of the second book of the\r\n_Historia General_ he affirms, “I heard this with my own ears for I went\r\non that voyage with the Comendador de Lares [Ovando] to this island.”  The\r\nphrase is characteristic, for the positive note is rarely absent in the\r\naffirmations of Las Casas, nor is it admissible that his experiences on\r\nany voyage previous to that of Ovando should find no place in the exact\r\nand scrupulous narrative he has left us of his relations with America and\r\nhis beloved Indians.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the persistent and bitter complaints of Columbus against\r\nthe second Governor of Hispaniola, whose appointment violated the rights\r\nsecured to the Admiral and his successors by the capitulations of Granada,\r\nthe catholic sovereign decided to recall Francisco de Bobadilla, whose\r\nadministration gave cause for dissatisfaction in other respects, and to\r\nsend Don Nicholas de Ovando to replace him.  Ovando was at that time\r\nComendador de Lares and was later raised to the supreme commandership of\r\nthe Order of Calatrava.  He is described as a most prudent man, worthy to\r\ngovern any number of people, but not Indians; man in word and deed, an\r\navowed enemy of avarice and covetousness; not wanting in humility, as\r\nshown in his habits of life, both public and private, though he maintained\r\nthe dignity and authority of his position.(3)\r\n\r\nThe new Governor was endowed with full powers to judge the accusations\r\nagainst his predecessor and to dispose of the nettlesome questions which\r\nhad provoked the Roldan rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe preparations for his departure were delayed by many causes; his fleet\r\nwas the most considerable one that had thus far been organised to sail for\r\nAmerica, being composed of thirty-two vessels on which were to sail some\r\ntwo thousand five hundred persons, many of whom were knights and noblemen.\r\nTwelve Franciscan friars under the direction of their leader, Fray Alonso\r\ndel Espinal, formed part of the company.\r\n\r\nIt was this brilliant expedition that Fernando Cortes intended to join\r\nwhen he was prevented by injuries incurred while engaged in an amorous\r\nadventure which led him over garden walls into risky situations where he\r\nended with broken bones, and was consequently left behind.  The fleet\r\nsailed from San Lucar de Barrameda on February 13, 1502, which according\r\nto Las Casas was the first Sunday in lent of that year.(4)\r\n\r\nThe usual course, by way of the Canary Islands, was followed, but after\r\neight days at sea, a violent tempest wrecked one ship, _La Rabida_, with\r\none hundred and twenty people on board, and scattered the remainder; some\r\nvessels were obliged to throw most of their cargo overboard, but all,\r\nafter many dangers, gradually found refuge in various ports of the\r\nneighbouring islands.\r\n\r\nThe wreckage of _La Rabida_, and that of some other vessels which had also\r\nfoundered while carrying sugar from the islands, drifted back to the\r\nSpanish coast and gave rise to the rumour that the entire fleet was lost.\r\nThis caused such a general sense of affliction that the sovereigns, on\r\nreceipt of this false report, shut themselves up in the palace at Granada\r\nand mourned for eight days.\r\n\r\nThe vessels which had weathered the tempest united after some delay in the\r\nport of the island of Gomera, and being joined there by another, fitted\r\nout in the Canaries by people eager to go to America, the fleet was thus\r\nbrought up to its original complement.  The commander divided his squadron\r\nin to two sections, the first of which, composed of the fastest vessels,\r\nhe kept under his command, while the second was placed under command of\r\nAntonio de Torres.  Ovando’s division reached Hispaniola on the fifteenth\r\nof April and the second squadron came safely to port some twelve days\r\nlater.  Thus did Bartholomew de Las Casas first land in the New World.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. - THE DISCOVERIES OF COLUMBUS.  CHARACTER OF THE AMERICAN\r\nINDIANS.  THE BEGINNINGS OF SLAVERY AND THE SLAVE-TRADE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the ever-memorable month of October, 1492, Christopher Columbus landed\r\non the shores of the New World he had discovered by sailing westward.  To\r\nthis great undertaking Columbus had advanced through a long career during\r\nwhich he had had unusual adventures and experiences in almost every part\r\nof the known world.  A Genoese by birth, he had studied at Pavia,(5) where\r\nhe had acquired some knowledge of Latin, and was introduced to the study\r\nof those sciences to which his inclinations and his opportunities enabled\r\nhim later to devote himself.  He knew the Atlantic Coast from El Mina in\r\nAfrica,(6) to England and Iceland,(7) and he had visited the Levant(8)and\r\nthe islands of the Grecian Archipelago.\r\n\r\nWriting of himself to the Catholic sovereigns, he says that he had been a\r\nsailor from his earliest youth, and curious to discover the secrets of the\r\nworld.  This same impulse led him to the study of navigation, cosmography,\r\nand kindred sciences, and his son Ferdinand states that the book which\r\nmost influenced his father was the _Cosmographia_ of Cardinal Aliaco in\r\nwhich he read the following passage: Et dicit Aristoteles ut mare parvum\r\nest inter finem Hispanicæ a parte Occidentis, et inter principium Indiæ a\r\nparte Orientis.  Et non loquitur de Hispaniâ citeriori quæ nunc Hispania\r\ncommuniter dicitur sed de Hispaniâ ulteriori quæ nunc Africa dicitur.(9)\r\n\r\nThe illustrious Florentine, Paolo Toscanelli, definitely encouraged the\r\nconviction Columbus had formed from his reading of Marco Polo’s\r\ndescriptions of Cipango, Cathay, and the Grand Khan, that the lands might\r\nbe reached by sailing west, and there was doubtless little the ancients\r\nhad written concerning the existence of islands and continents lying\r\nbeyond the Pillars of Hercules with which he was not acquainted.\r\n\r\nThe story of his attempts to secure the necessary means and authority for\r\nundertaking his great enterprise does not belong to our present subject,\r\nbut before hearing his own description of what and whom he found in the\r\nwestern hemisphere when first he landed there, it is necessary to consider\r\nthe arguments by which his friends finally prevailed on the sovereigns of\r\nCastile to grant him their patronage.  That they did this contrary to the\r\nthe counsels of the learned cosmographers of the age and in defiance of\r\ncontemporary common-sense, is in itself a most noteworthy fact which\r\ntestifies both to the singular qualities of Columbus and to the rare\r\nsagacity of the Catholic Queen who, in her momentous decision, acted\r\nalone, there being little in the scheme to commend it to the colder\r\ntemperament of King Ferdinand.\r\n\r\nBy almost no intellectual effort can we of to-day realise the chimerical\r\nstamp which the proposition of Columbus bore, and which served to mark him\r\nas an adventurer and a visionary or, to use a forceful Americanism, as a\r\n“crank” in the estimation of sensible, practical people.  He has himself\r\nrecorded that he believed he was acting under inspiration and was merely\r\nfulfilling the prophecy of Isaiah.  The council of cosmographers summoned\r\nby the Queen’s confessor, Fray Hernando de Talavera, to study the project\r\nwhich Columbus, through the exertions of his friends, the Prior of Santa\r\nMaria de la Rabida, and Alonso de Quintanilla, treasurer of the royal\r\nhousehold, had succeeded in presenting to the sovereigns, decided “that it\r\nwas vain and impossible, nor did it belong to the majesty of such great\r\nPrinces to decide anything upon such weak grounds of information.”(10)\r\n\r\nSpain was at that time engaged in a costly war against the Moors, who\r\nstill held Granada; hard pushed as the sovereigns were for money to carry\r\non the necessary military operations, it is not strange that no funds were\r\nforthcoming to finance the visionary schemes propounded by an obscure\r\nforeigner.  After some years of vain striving, Columbus was on the point\r\nof quitting the country in despair, when two powerful allies\r\nintervened—Cardinal Mendoza, Archbishop of Toledo, and Luis de Santangel,\r\nwho held the office of Receiver of Revenues of the Crown of Aragon.\r\n\r\nIt must have argued powerfully in favour of Columbus that he had won to\r\nhis support, not only several great ecclesiastics and the Duke of Medina\r\nCeli, but also two of the most astute financiers of the realm,—Santangel\r\nand Quintanilla, men not easily accessible to enthusiasms nor inclined to\r\nencourage non-paying investments.\r\n\r\nWhatever was the motive that prompted these men to take the project under\r\ntheir protection, the Queen was primarily swayed by religious arguments,\r\nwhich also with Columbus were as powerfully operative as his desire for\r\nprofit and glory.\r\n\r\nThe preface of his journal contains a review of of the year 1492, which\r\nwas signalised by the fall of Granada and the final expulsion, after seven\r\ncenturies, of the Moors from Spain.  He recalls his petition to the Pope,\r\nasking that learned Catholic doctors should be sent to instruct the Grand\r\nKhan in the true faith, and to convert populous cities that were perishing\r\nin Idolatry, to which his Holiness had vouchsafed no answer, after which\r\nhe continues:\r\n\r\n“Your Highnesses, as Catholic Christians and Princes, promoters of the\r\nChristian religion, and enemies of the sect of Mahomet and of all\r\nidolatries and heresies, thought to send me, Christopher Columbus, to the\r\naforementioned provinces of India to see the said princes, the cities, the\r\ncountries, their position and everything concerning them and the way that\r\nshould be adopted to convert them to our Holy Faith.”(11)\r\n\r\nThis passage reflects the mind and character of Columbus as he is\r\ndescribed by Las Casas; for even beyond the glory of penetrating the\r\nworld’s mysteries that so powerfully influenced him, he nurtured dreams of\r\nreligious propaganda, another crusade to recover the Holy Sepulchre, and\r\nthe conversion of all the heathen to the faith.\r\n\r\n“He fasted with strictest observance on the fasts of the church; he\r\nconfessed and received communion frequently; he recited the canonical\r\nhours like an ecclesiastic or a monk; most inimical to blasphemies and\r\noaths, he was most devoted to Our Lady and to the seraphic Father, St.\r\nFrancis…most jealous of the Divine honour, eager and desirous for the\r\nconversion of these peoples, and that the faith of Jesus Christ should be\r\neverywhere spread, and singularly given and devoted to God that he might\r\nbe made worthy to help in some way to win the Holy Sepulchre.”(12)\r\n\r\nPatient, long-suffering, prone to forgive injuries, Columbus was a man of\r\ncourageous soul and high aspirations, always pervaded with infinite\r\nconfidence in Divine Providence and never failing in loyalty to the\r\nsovereigns whom he served.\r\n\r\nSuch were the qualities of the man whose great discovery prepared the\r\nscene on which Las Casas was to play the noblest part of all; such were\r\nthe influences which promised to shape his actions in conformity with the\r\nintentions of the saintly Queen who sustained him.  These influences are\r\nseen to be first and always religious; religious in the prevailing\r\nconception of a century, when the interpretation of the command “go ye and\r\nteach all nations” admitted of no shirking an obligation laid by the\r\nDivine command on each Christian, whether priest, king or subject.  An\r\ninfallible Church provided the one ordained channel of divine grace and\r\nsalvation for mankind, dissent from which meant damnation, and hence into\r\nthat Church all nations must be gathered.\r\n\r\nBearing these conditions of the age and these convictions which dominated\r\nboth the Queen and Columbus well in mind, we shall later have occasion to\r\nobserve the startling contradiction of essential principles of\r\nChristianity shown in the acts of the latter in his dealings with the\r\nIndians; for he not only prepared the stage Las Casas was to tread, but he\r\nlikewise provided the tragedy of iniquity to be thereon enacted.\r\n\r\nThe first soil on which Columbus landed was that of a beautiful island\r\nsome fifteen leagues in length, fruitful, fresh, and verdant like a fair\r\ngarden, in the midst of which was a lake of sweet water.  The weary eyes\r\nof the mariners, strained for weeks to catch a glimpse of the despaired-of\r\nland, were refreshed by the sight of this pezzo del cielo, and the landing\r\nof Columbus was a scene of picturesque and moving simplicity in which were\r\nnot wanting the features of martial grandeur and religious solemnity,\r\nfurnished by steel-clad knights with drawn swords, bearing the royal\r\nstandard of Castile and the emblem of man’s salvation, before which all\r\nknelt in a fervour of triumph and thanksgiving.  Both as wondering\r\nwitnesses and interested actors in this memorable drama, there appeared\r\nthe natives of the island, transfixed in silent awe in the presence of\r\ntheir mysterious guests.  Columbus describes them as well-built, with good\r\nfeatures and beautiful eyes, but with hair as coarse as a horse’s mane;\r\ntheir complexion was yellowish and they had their faces painted.  They\r\nwere entirely naked and neither carried weapons nor understood the use of\r\nsuch things.\r\n\r\n“They ought,” he says, “to make faithful and intelligent servants, for I\r\nperceive they very quickly repeat all that is said to them and I believe\r\nthey would very quickly be converted to Christianity as it appeared to me\r\nthat they had no creed.”\r\n\r\nIn another passage he writes: “As they showed us such friendship and as I\r\nrecognised that they were people who would yield themselves better to the\r\nChristian faith and be converted more through love than by force, I gave\r\nsome of them some coloured buttons and some glass beads which they wore\r\naround their necks, and many other things of small value, with which they\r\nwere delighted, and became so attached to us that it was a marvel to\r\nbehold.”\r\n\r\nThe natives were not slow to reciprocate these gifts and hastened to offer\r\nthe best of all they possessed to the Spaniards in return for their\r\ntrifling presents.\r\n\r\nIndeed, since it is better to give than to receive, the Admiral describes\r\nthe natives of Marien as being of such a generous disposition that they\r\nesteemed it the highest honour to be asked to give. What could be more\r\nidyllic than his description of the people he found at Rio del Sol in\r\nCuba?—“They are all very gentle, without knowledge of evil, neither\r\nkilling nor stealing.”  Everywhere he touched during his first voyage, he\r\nand his men were welcomed as gods descended upon earth, their wants\r\nanticipated, and such boundless hospitality showered upon them that\r\nColumbus was touched by the gentleness and grace of the natives.\r\n\r\n“They are a loving uncovetous people, so docile in all things that I do\r\nassure your Highness I believe in all the world there is not a better\r\npeople or a better country; they love their neighbors as themselves, and\r\nthey have the sweetest and gentlest way of speaking in the world and\r\nalways with a smile.”\r\n\r\nWhen it came the turn of Las Casas to describe the Indians in the islands,\r\nhe wrote:\r\n\r\n“All these infinite peoples were created by God the most simple of all\r\nothers, without malice or duplicity, most obedient and faithful to their\r\nrulers, whom they serve; the most humble, patient, loving, peaceful, and\r\ndocile people, without contentions or tumults; neither factious nor\r\nquarrelsome, without hatred, or desire for revenge, more than any other\r\npeople in the world.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the accounts of the New World given to the Catholic sovereigns\r\nby Columbus on his return from his first voyage, and afterwards by Las\r\nCasas in his terrible indictment of his countrymen’s destructive invasion\r\nof those peaceful realms, peopled by innocent and genial heathen.  Had\r\nShakespeare heard this fair report when he put the description of the\r\nmagic isle in the mouth of the King’s counsellor, Gonzalo?\r\n\r\n\r\n    I’ the commonwealth I would by contraries\r\n    Execute all things; for no kind of traffic\r\n    Would I admit; no name of magistrate;\r\n    Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,\r\n    And use of service, none; contract, succession,\r\n    Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;\r\n    No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;\r\n    No occupation; all men idle, all;\r\n    And women too, but innocent and pure;\r\n    No sovereignty;\r\n    All things in common nature should produce\r\n    Without sweat or endeavour; treason, felony,\r\n    Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine\r\n    Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,\r\n    Of it’s own kind, all foison, all abundance\r\n    To feed my innocent people.(13)\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon such virgin soil, Columbus felt confident that the gospel seed would\r\nproduce an abundant harvest and he says:\r\n\r\n“I hold it for certain, Most Serene Princes, that by means of devout,\r\nreligious persons, knowing their language they would all quickly become\r\nChristians and thus I hope in Our Lord that your Highnesses will provide\r\nfor this with much diligence to bring such numerous people into the Church\r\nand convert them, as you have destroyed those who would not confess the\r\nFather, Son, and Holy Ghost; and that after this life (for we are all\r\nmortal) you will leave your kingdoms in a very tranquil state, purified\r\nfrom heresy and evil.”\r\n\r\nWonderful and humiliating is it to observe how little these first\r\nimpressions of the Indians and these elevated Christian aspirations\r\ninfluenced his conduct in dealing with them, once he was master of their\r\ndestinies.\r\n\r\nThe declared purposes of the second voyage of 1493 were the colonisation\r\nof the newly discovered countries, the conversion of the natives, and the\r\nextension of his discoveries.  Pope Alexander VI. had conferred the lands\r\nthus far discovered and others to be discovered upon the sovereigns of\r\nCastile and Leon, with the fullest rights over navigation, and imperial\r\njurisdiction over the western hemisphere.  The Bull bestowing these\r\nconcessions was dated the fourth of May, 1493, in the first year of his\r\npontificate.  An imaginary line, drawn from pole to pole and passing one\r\nhundred leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands, separated the spheres of\r\nSpanish and Portuguese exploration, and the Bull expressly laid down as\r\nthe principal reason for this grant, that the natives would be converted\r\nto Christianity.(14)\r\n\r\nThe conditions imposed by the Pontiff corresponded perfectly to the\r\nsincere desires of the Spanish sovereigns, who had, from their first\r\nknowledge of the existence of the Indians, displayed the keenest and\r\ntenderest zeal to provide for their welfare.  They instructed Columbus to\r\ndeal lovingly with the Indians, to make them generous gifts, and to show\r\nthem much honour; and if perchance any one should treat them unjustly, the\r\nAdmiral should punish him severely.(15)\r\n\r\nThis second expedition was composed of 1500 men, of whom twenty were\r\nhorsemen; many knights and gentlemen, especially from Seville, and some\r\nmembers of the royal household also went.  The number of officials of\r\nvarious grades appointed to exercise problematical functions in the new\r\ncolony exceeded the necessities of the case and gave promise of the many\r\ndissensions and petty conflicts which were not slow in declaring\r\nthemselves.  A priest, Father Buil, and other ecclesiastics were sent to\r\nundertake the instruction and conversion of the Indians; in all, seventeen\r\nships left the Bay of Cadiz on September 25, 1493.(16) Upon his arrival at\r\nHispaniola, the Admiral found the little colony he had left there\r\ncompletely exterminated, and learned from his friend the Cacique\r\nGuacanagari that, after his departure for Spain, the Spaniards had fallen\r\nto quarrelling amongst themselves and had scattered throughout the island,\r\nprovoking hostilities with the natives and had, in consequence, been\r\nkilled by a neighbouring chieftain, Caonabó, who also burned the tower the\r\ncolonists had built.  The first report on the state of the new colony of\r\nIsabella, which Columbus sent to Spain in January, 1494, was in the form\r\nof an instruction to Antonio de Torres, receiver for the colony, whom Las\r\nCasas describes as “a brother of the Governor of the Infante Don Juan, a\r\nnotable person, prudent and efficient for such a post.”(17) In this\r\nnotable document occurs the first mention of slavery in the New World.\r\nThe Admiral directs Torres to inform the sovereigns that he has made\r\nslaves of some Indians captured the cannibal islands, and has sent them to\r\nSpain have them taught Spanish in order that they may later serve as\r\ninterpreters.  The justification he advanced for this measure was that by\r\ntaking from their surroundings they would be cured of their cannibalism,\r\nconverted to Christianity, and their souls saved; besides which, if the\r\ncannibals were thus converted, the Indians of the neighbouring islands,\r\nwho were peaceable and lived in fear of them, would conceive a still\r\nhigher regard for the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nThis reasoning doubtless commended itself to most people, but the\r\nsagacious Queen instantly put her finger upon the flaw in the argument,\r\nand on the margin of Columbus’s report is written her answer: “This is all\r\nvery well and so it must be done; but let the Admiral see whether it might\r\nnot be _there_ arranged to bring them to our Holy Catholic Faith and the\r\nsame with the Indians of those islands where he is.”\r\n\r\nThe next suggestion, despite any possible excellence of his motives, was a\r\nfrank proposal to establish a thriving trade in human flesh as barefaced\r\nas could be made by the least scrupulous “blackbirder.”  The Admiral,\r\nalways dwelling upon the spiritual welfare of the cannibal natives,\r\nproposed that the more of them that could be captured, the better it would\r\nbe, and then, mingling temporal advantages to Spaniards with spiritual\r\nblessings to the natives, he explained that the quantities of live stock\r\nand other necessaries required by the colonists, might be paid for by the\r\nsale of slaves sent back to Spain in the ships which would bring these\r\nsupplies several times a year to the colony.  The sovereigns are to be\r\nreminded that they may collect duties on this slave-trade, and an early\r\nanswer is desired in order that the arrangements for the new commerce may\r\nbe pushed forward.(18)\r\n\r\nThe Queen’s observation on this passage was not as positive as it might\r\nhave been and, though the proposition was evidently repugnant to her, she\r\nmerely directed that the matter be suspended for the present until some\r\nother way of providing on the spot be found and that the Admiral should\r\nreport further. Columbus, however, did not wait to receive the royal\r\napproval of his slave-trading schemes. During a voyage which resulted in\r\nthe discovery of Jamaica and other islands, he visited that of San Juan\r\n(Puerto Rico) for the purpose of capturing more cannibals, and on his\r\nreturn Hispaniola, where he had left his brother Don Diego in charge as\r\nPresident and Don Pedro Margarite as Captain-General, he found affairs in\r\nthe worst possible condition owing to the foolish and inconsiderate\r\nconduct of the colonists, which had converted the friendly natives into\r\nhostile enemies and placed the very existence of the colony in jeopardy.\r\nAfter some hostilities, a degree of tranquillity was established and\r\nColumbus laid a tribute upon the entire population of the island which\r\nrequired that each Indian above fourteen years of age who lived in the\r\nmining provinces was to pay a little bell filled with gold every three\r\nmonths; the natives of all other provinces were to pay one arroba of\r\ncotton. These amounts were so excessive that in 1496 it was found\r\nnecessary to change the nature of the payment, and, instead of the gold\r\nand cotton required from the villages, labour was substituted, the Indians\r\nbeing required to lay out and work the plantations of the colonists in\r\ntheir vicinity. This was the germ of the cruel and oppressive\r\nrepartimientos and encomiendas which were destined to depopulate the\r\nislands and to bring an indelible stigma on the Spanish colonial system in\r\nthe Indies. In that year, 1496, Bartholomew Columbus sent three hundred\r\nnatives, who were convicted or accused of killing Spaniards, to Spain to\r\nbe sold as slaves. Though the Spanish sovereigns admitted a difference in\r\nthe status of such natives, there is nevertheless a letter of theirs\r\naddressed to Bishop Fonseca, who was at the head of Indian affairs,\r\ndirecting him to receive no money from the sale of Indians until\r\ntheologians and canonists had pronounced upon the question whether they\r\nmight with a good conscience, permit such Indians to be sold. No positive\r\ndecision is recorded, but order were given that all Indians taken in acts\r\nof flagrant “rebellion” and found guilty should be sent to Spain. There\r\nwas but one fate awaiting them so that, if not formally approved, the\r\nenslaving of Indians, accused of rebellion, was by this edict tolerated.\r\n\r\nAnother piece of colonial legislation was effected in 1497 by the issue of\r\na royal patent to the Admiral, authorising him to grant parcels of land in\r\nthe islands to the Spanish colonists; there is no mention in this grant of\r\nrepartimientos of Indians to work on the lands. The affairs of the colony\r\nwere not prospering, complaints against the Admiral were numerous, and the\r\nsituation was much complicated by the open rebellion of the chief justice,\r\nRoldan, in which the unfortunate Indians found themselves, whether they\r\nwould or no, involved on one side or the other and, no matter which way\r\nvictory went, upon them it fell to pay the costs. Regular raids were\r\norganised upon tribes and villages, on the pretext that a chief had not\r\nperformed the services required in lieu of tribute and had fled with his\r\npeople to the forests; pursuit followed and all who were captured were\r\nconsidered rebels taken in open fight and were immediately dispatched in\r\nthe vessels of Columbus’s fleet, which had reached Hispaniola in August,\r\n1498, to be sold as slaves in Spain. Still invoking the name of the Holy\r\nTrinity, Columbus explained to the sovereigns that he could supply as many\r\nslaves as the Spanish market required, estimating, according to his\r\ninformation, that four thousand could be disposed of, the value of whom,\r\ntogether with that of a shipment of logwood, would amount to 40,000,000\r\nmaravedis. The consignment mentioned consisted of six hundred slaves, of\r\nwhom one third was given to the masters of the ships to cover the carrying\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\nIn the same letter, Columbus asked that the colonists should be allowed to\r\nuse Indian labour for a year or two until their affairs should become more\r\nsettled and prosperous, and so satisfied was he with the equity of this\r\narrangement that he set it at once in operation without waiting for the\r\nroyal sanction of his plan. After two years of dissensions, Roldan and his\r\nrebellious supporters were pacified and Columbus partitioned lands and\r\nslaves among them with unstinted generosity. Those of Roldan’s adherents\r\nwho elected to remain in the colony received from the Admiral\r\nrepartimientos, consisting of a certain number of hillocks of cazabi (the\r\nplant from which flour for cassava bread was made), which were placed in\r\ncharge of a cacique whose people were obliged to till them for the profit\r\nof the holder.  This was the second stage in the development of\r\nrepartimientos, viz., the Indians were bound to the land and forced to\r\ncultivate it. Fifteen of the Roldan party, however, decided to return to\r\nSpain, each of whom received from one to three slaves, whom they took back\r\nwith them in October, 1499.\r\n\r\nThe Queen’s proclamation issued at Seville, Granada, and elsewhere\r\nordering all holders of slaves given them by Columbus to return them\r\nforthwith to Hispaniola under pain of death distinguished, however,\r\nbetween such and the others who had been taken as prisoners of war and\r\nsold into slavery. The distinction is a fine one and points to the\r\nconclusion that even Queen Isabella admitted that some Indians might, for\r\ndefined causes, be enslaved, and that her assent was based upon some\r\npronouncement of the canonists and theologians to whom she had submitted\r\nthe question; but there is nothing to show that the slaves given to\r\nRoldan’s followers were captured in any different way from the others.\r\nThis inconsistency, which so sadly weakens the noble character of the\r\nroyal proclamation and detracts from the merits of the Queen as an enemy\r\nof slavery, could hardly have proceeded from her own inclinations but was\r\nrather the outcome of some casuistry that constrained her action without\r\nconvincing her judgment. The Queen doubtless saw with pain and\r\ndisappointment that, owing to the Admiral’s measures and proposals, which\r\nwere in surprising contradiction with the lofty and pious principles he\r\nprofessed, her own Catholic aspirations for the speedy conversion of the\r\nIndians and the pacific extension of Spanish rule were being thwarted. The\r\nnoise of the controversies in which the sublime unreason of Columbus had\r\nfortunately prevailed over the scientific opinions of the age, the\r\ninterest of the Queen, and all the circumstances of his first voyage had\r\nfastened the attention of the Spanish and Portuguese courts upon his\r\nexpedition, excluding any hope that failure might escape notice.   For he\r\nhad failed in his ultimate purpose. Instead of Cathay, the Grand Khan\r\nready to welcome Christianity and a short road to the wealth of the East,\r\nhe had found a few semi-tropical islands, producing parrots and cocoanuts\r\nchiefly, and inhabited by harmless barbarians living in an idyllic state\r\nof poverty and idleness. The enthusiasm aroused by his first voyage\r\nsubsided and his fame as an explorer was obscured by his incompetency as a\r\ngovernor. He himself never lived to comprehend the real importance of his\r\ndiscovery and he persisted in regarding the islands as the outposts of a\r\ngreat Oriental empire. Having sailed to seek a short route to the ancient\r\nEast, Columbus was constrained to render his disappointing discovery\r\nacceptable by making it profitable and, since the promised gold and rare\r\nspices were not forthcoming, only the trade in slaves remained to furnish\r\nimmediate profits. In July, 1500, Francisco de Bobadilla sailed to\r\nsupersede Columbus, with full powers from the sovereigns, and had he gone\r\nas a messenger of vengeance to chastise the Admiral’s moral backsliding,\r\nhe could not have enacted the rôle more consistently, for, from the moment\r\nof his landing, his treatment of Columbus was ruthless, and an amazed\r\nworld was shortly furnished the humiliating spectacle of the great\r\nAdmiral, in chains, shipped back to the kingdom he had endowed with a\r\nworld. Bobadilla’s moral, social, and economic administration proved a\r\ncomplete failure and his own excesses contributed to his speedy removal,\r\nwithout his management of the colony having corrected the abuses he was\r\nsent out to redress or having relieved the Indians from the bonds of\r\nslavery which, in defiance of the sovereign’s commands, were being daily\r\nriveted more securely upon them.\r\n\r\nThe justified protests of Columbus found a hearing, and the man who had\r\ninflicted a supreme indignity upon him was recalled, Don Nicholas de\r\nOvando being appointed by a royal cedula of September 3, 1501, to succeed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. - THE COLONY OF HISPANIOLA.  ARRIVAL OF LAS CASAS.  CONDITION\r\nOF THE COLONISTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe arrival of Don Nicholas de Ovando’s fleet at Hispaniola was an event\r\nof the greatest importance to the colony.  The first news that greeted the\r\nnew arrivals was that of the discovery of a huge nugget of gold, the\r\nlargest yet found and which, in fact, was never again equalled in size\r\nuntil the rich lodes in California were tapped in 1849, for it weighed\r\nthirty-five pounds and was valued at 3600 pesos in the money of that time.\r\n\r\nThis famous nugget was found eight or nine leagues from the settlement of\r\nSan Domingo, by an Indian girl, who, while resting from her labours, idly\r\nturned up the soil with an instrument she held, and thus brought to light\r\nthe wonderful treasure.  The Governor appropriated it for the King, paying\r\nits value to the two owners of the mine.  The jubilant Spaniards used the\r\nnugget, which was shaped like a broad, flat dish, to serve up a roast\r\nsucking-pig at a banquet given in honour of the occasion, saying that no\r\nking ever feasted from such a platter.  Las Casas remarks that as for the\r\nmiserable Indian girl who found it, we may without sin suppose that they\r\nnever gave her so much as a red silk petticoat, and lucky was she indeed\r\nif she got even a mouthful of the pig!\r\n\r\nThe second piece of glad news the colonists communicated was, that owing\r\nto a recent uprising of the Indians in a certain province, they had been\r\nable to enslave a goodly number of the rebels.  Such occasions rejoiced\r\ntheir hearts, over the profits they thus derived from the struggles of the\r\nunhappy natives to recover their freedom, and it may likewise without sin\r\nbe supposed that their ingenuity was not barren in suggesting devices for\r\nprovoking such lucrative revolts.\r\n\r\nIn the instructions delivered to Ovando, as well as in the Queen’s verbal\r\nbehests to him before sailing, the sovereigns sought to remedy the abuses\r\nunder which the Indians suffered.  The Queen explicitly laid down the\r\nfundamental principle that “all the Indians in Hispaniola are and should\r\nbe free from servitude; nor should they be molested by any one, but should\r\nlive as free vassals, governed and protected as are the vassals of\r\nCastile.” They were to pay a tribute—all Spanish vassals were taxed—and\r\nthey were to work in the gold-mines but for their labour they were to\r\nreceive a daily wage.  The Queen’s obvious intention was that the\r\ngovernment should, in some measure at least, be carried on for the benefit\r\nof the Indians it was instituted to govern.  The orders describing the\r\nmeasures to be taken for the instruction and conversion of the natives\r\nwere equally clear and imperative.\r\n\r\nOvando was authorised to permit the importation into Hispaniola of negroes\r\nwho were born slaves, belonging to Christian owners. (19) They were\r\nconsequently brought to the colony in such numbers that the Governor soon\r\nwrote to Spain, advising that the traffic in African slaves be stopped, as\r\nthe negroes constantly escaped and took refuge in the forests and\r\nmountains, taking with them also many Indians.  These negroes were for the\r\nmost part born in Andalusia of slave parents, who had been brought there\r\nby the Portuguese who had carried on the slave-trade since early in the\r\nfifteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe first official action of the new Governor was to institute an inquiry\r\ninto the administration of his predecessor, Bobadilla, against whose harsh\r\nand arbitrary treatment of him, Columbus had filed complaints.  The\r\nAdmiral had meanwhile been received by the sovereigns, and Queen\r\nIsabella’s compassionate heart had been much grieved by the sad accounts\r\nof the indignities put upon him, the confiscation of his properties, the\r\nviolation of the rights solemnly conferred upon him and his heirs under\r\nher signature, and finally the supreme outrage of his deposition and his\r\nreturn to Spain wearing the chains of a common malefactor.  Francisco de\r\nBobadilla had far outstripped the limits of the sovereign’s intentions as\r\nwell as those of his own authority and had, by his treatment of Columbus,\r\nviolated the commonest sentiments of justice and humanity.  Ovando made\r\nfull restitution of the confiscated properties, and the rights and\r\nprivileges guaranteed to Columbus were once more recognised and made\r\nvalid.  The latter organised his fourth and last expedition to America,\r\nwhich sailed on the ninth of May, 1502, (20) and arrived at Hispaniola\r\nafter a prosperous voyage, on the twenty-ninth of June.  Bobadilla set\r\nsail for Spain on board the same ship which carried the famous gold\r\nnugget, but neither arrived, as the vessel was overtaken by a violent\r\nhurricane, and was lost when barely forty hours out from port.  Thus\r\nperished one whose iniquities have caused his name to be handed down to\r\neternal execration in the pages of American history.\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of the colony in Hispaniola, when Bartholomew de\r\nLas Casas, then a young licentiate, twenty-eight years of age, arrived\r\nthere.  The purpose of his coming was no different from that of the other\r\ngentlemen-adventurers who were bent on acquiring speedy fortunes in a land\r\nof supposed riches that formed the theme of fabulous and alluring tales,\r\nwhich often enough had but slender foundation in fact.  As his father had\r\nalready acquired properties in the island, it is probable that Bartholomew\r\ncame to assume the direction of them.  There is nothing to show that he\r\nwas at that time especially impressed or moved by the sad condition of the\r\nIndians and the violation of their rights; on the contrary, he procured\r\nslaves, worked them in the mines, and attended to the cultivation of his\r\nestates with the energy he employed in every undertaking to which he put\r\nhis hand.  He says himself that during eight years of Ovando’s\r\ngovernorship, this \"pestilential disorder\" took root without there being a\r\nman who spoke or heeded or thought anything about it, notwithstanding that\r\nsuch multitudes were being sacrificed, that out of the infinite number of\r\nthe inhabitants of whom the Admiral first wrote to the Catholic\r\nsovereigns, there perished more than nine tenths in that brief period.\r\n(21)\r\n\r\nHe took part in the second war against the Cacique Cocubanó(22) in the\r\nprovince of Higuey, of which he afterwards wrote the most horrifying\r\ndescription.  He related incredible cruelties, concluding thus: “All these\r\ndeeds, and others foreign to all human nature did my own eyes witness, and\r\nI do not now dare to recount them, being hardly able to believe myself,\r\nlest perhaps I may have dreamed them.” Throughout these massacres Las\r\nCasas, young, enthusiastic, generous-hearted, noble-minded, and with his\r\nnaturally keen sensibilities refined and sharpened by the best education\r\nof his times, appears to have played his part with the others, neither\r\nbetter nor worse than they, equally blind to the injustice and tyranny\r\npractised upon the inoffensive and defenceless Indians and only eager for\r\nhis share of the profits derived from their sufferings.  The contradiction\r\nis as flagrant as in the case of the great Admiral who initiated the\r\nsystem which brought all these horrors in logical sequence.  The war in\r\nHiguey finished with the capture of the unfortunate Cocubanó, whom Ovando\r\ncaused to be hanged at San Domingó instead of allowing him to be torn to\r\npieces with pincers as the Spaniards demanded should be done.  Such was\r\nthe quality of mercy in that Governor’s heart.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of Las Casas prospered and he grew rich, though it is\r\ndifficult to believe that his yearly income from his properties amounted\r\nto 100,000 castellanos—an enormous sum, given the value of money at that\r\ntime,—yet this is the figure he himself has given in his own writings.\r\n(23)\r\n\r\nSuch being the attitude of a man of finer temperament during eight years\r\npassed amidst scene of rapacious ferocity, something must be admitted to\r\nexplain the callousness of men of fewer sensibilities and lower moral\r\nstandards, who found themselves far removed from the usual restraint of\r\ncivilised society and confronted by many hard ships and severe\r\ndisappointments.   The moral and physical condition of the majority of\r\nthese men was indeed deplorable.  Many of them had staked all they could\r\nobtain on this great venture in the Indies, hallucinated by the craze for\r\ngold, of which they dreamed as lying, waiting to be picked up, in lands\r\nwhere pearls strewed the sands of the beach.  Rapid exploitation of such\r\nsources of fabulous wealth and a speedy return to Spain, rather than the\r\nenterprises usually suggested to Anglo-Saxons by the term “colonisation,”\r\nhad lured them over the mysterious ocean.  Little thought was given to the\r\npastoral and agriculture resources of a rich soil that would have yielded\r\nabundant crops in response to the simplest tillage and made of the islands\r\na granary sufficient to feed all Spain.  Unaccustomed to manual labour,\r\nignorant of the simplest principles of mining, poorly supplied—when at\r\nall—with the necessary implements, they rushed to the mines with but\r\nscanty provision even of food; fevers seized them, strange diseases\r\nattacked them—most of all, disillusion confronted them; out of Ovando’s\r\n2500 men more than one thousand died within a brief period, in the most\r\nwretched manner.  Those who had the courage and strength to work, barely\r\nmade enough to feed themselves, for it not infrequently happened that\r\nafter the royal fifth was deducted and other expenses met, the remainder,\r\nwhen divided, hardly gave to each colonist more than his daily, scanty\r\nliving.  The state of degradation into which they sank was pitiable and\r\nthere is little cause to wonder that, in their brutalised condition, they\r\ntook small account of the physical sufferings of the Indians and no\r\ninterest at all in weighing their claims to liberty and just treatment.\r\nThe few who did turn their attention to agriculture fared better, both as\r\nto the comforts of their surroundings and the profits they derived from\r\ntheir occupation; their Indians likewise led far easier lives than their\r\nfellows who worked for the miners.  The vicious principles underlying\r\nslavery once established, innumerable abuses are bound to follow, and when\r\nresponsibility for an iniquitous system is widely distributed, even the\r\nmost humane unconsciously drift into acquiescence in continuous and\r\nmonstrous acts of inhumanity, partly from want of strength to combat the\r\nestablished order of things and partly from the easy ability of each to\r\nshift his share of the blame for what his instincts condemn, onto the\r\nshoulders of others.  Reforms left to the collective conscience of such a\r\ncommunity are apt to languish.  Such is man’s nature that the most\r\nunnatural and abnormal conditions come to be tolerated by common\r\nacquiescence, until something—an event without or a stirring of his soul\r\nwithin—startles his better self into a realisation of his surroundings,\r\nthe scales fall from his eyes which, having, he saw not, and in a flash,\r\nthe iniquity of proceedings to which he has assented, in which he has\r\nshared, and by which he has profited, becomes manifest.\r\n\r\nIn the Indies a premium was placed on rebellion;  the oftener the Indians\r\ncould be goaded into open revolt, the more slaves could be acquired\r\naccording to due process of law, and everybody’s profits increased.  To\r\nsuch profitable encouragement the colonists were not slow to respond and\r\nthey were fertile in devices for rendering the lives of the Indians\r\nintolerable.\r\n\r\nNo champion was forthcoming to defend the helpless native or even to make\r\nhis woes known; the tender-hearted Queen, who loved justice and hated\r\niniquity, was remote and her beneficent intentions towards her humble\r\nsubjects in the islands were inoperative.  “The heavens are high and the\r\nTzar is far” say the long-suffering mujiks, whose road to their “little\r\nfather’s” throne is barred by an army of interested bureaucrats.  Tyranny\r\nis of divers sorts and one tyranny differs from another other in infamy,\r\nbut the worst tyranny of all is the dual tyranny over both body and soul\r\nexercised collectively by irresponsible men over their fellows, and this\r\nwas the tyranny of such slavery as prevailed in the Spanish colonies.  The\r\nspecious argument that the only way to convert the Indians was to keep\r\nthem among the Spaniards, was constantly insisted upon in pious phrases\r\nmeant to delude the Queen by a display of zeal in carrying out her plan\r\nfor their conversion.  Ovando wrote complaining of the desertion of the\r\nIndians, who escaped whenever they could from contact with the Spaniards\r\nand fled in numbers to the remotest recesses of the forests, facing\r\nstarvation rather than endure their life in the settlements.  And what\r\nwonder! for would any rational Indian voluntarily live amidst such\r\nsurroundings and submit to such labour for the sole benefit of his\r\ntyrants? Nothing that the afflicted natives saw of the religion or the\r\ncivilisation of the Spaniards could possibly attract them to either.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. - THE DOMINICANS IN HISPANIOLA.  THE ORDINATION OF LAS CASAS.\r\nTHE CONQUEST OF CUBA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the month of September of the year 1510, the first Dominican friars,\r\nfour in number, arrived in Hispaniola from Spain under the leadership of\r\ntheir Prior, Pedro de Cordoba, a man of gentle birth, distinguished\r\nappearance, gracious manners, and great piety.  He had exceptional gifts\r\nas a preacher and, in selecting the men of his Order to accompany him, he\r\nchose those who, to their exemplary life and zeal for conversions, united\r\nfacility in expounding Christian doctrine.  Two, especially, out of his\r\ncompany, were men of unusual ability—Fray Antonio de Montesinos and Fray\r\nBernardo de Santo Domingo.\r\n\r\nOne of the colonists, Pedro Lumbreras, gave the missionaries shelter, and\r\narranged to supply them with provisions, and the monks, without losing any\r\ntime, set to work to improve the habits and morals of the easy-going\r\nSpaniards in the colony.  The Viceroy being absent in the city of\r\nConcepcion de la Vega at that time, the Prior went thither to announce\r\ntheir arrival and pay his respects, accomplishing the tedious journey of\r\nthirty leagues on foot, sleeping on the ground and living on bread and\r\nwater.  He arrived at La Vega on a Saturday, and the next day, being\r\nSunday in the octave of All Saints, he preached a sermon on the glories of\r\nparadise prepared for the saints, of which Las Casas says, “It was a\r\nsermon so lofty and so divine that I held myself happy to hear it.” In\r\nresponse to the Prior’s invitation at the close of his discourse, his\r\nhearers sent their Indians, men, women, and children, to the church, after\r\ndinner.  The Prior, holding a crucifix in his hand, and assisted by\r\ninterpreters, then gave the Indians their first exposition of Christian\r\ndoctrine, beginning with the creation of the world and finishing with the\r\nCrucifixion.  This was the beginning of anything like a serious and\r\npractical effort to carry out the reiterated instructions of the Spanish\r\nsovereigns to instruct the Indians and convert them to Christianity.\r\n\r\nIn that same year, Las Casas took holy orders, and, though it is not clear\r\nwhether his ordination occurred before or after the memorable sermon of\r\nPrior Pedro de Cordoba, it is evident that the impression he received from\r\nthat discourse powerfully influenced him at a critical moment of his life\r\nand contributed to form the special vocation to which he afterwards\r\ndevoted himself.\r\n\r\nHis own description of his ordination is as follows:\r\n\r\n“In this same year and in these same days, when the father, Fray Pedro de\r\nCordoba went to La Vega, a cleric called Bartholomew de Las Casas had sung\r\na new mass; he was a native of Seville and among the oldest [settlers] in\r\nthe island, and that was the first time that a new mass was sung in all\r\nthe Indies; on account of being the first, the event was celebrated with\r\ngreat festivity by the Admiral [Don Diego Columbus] and everybody who was\r\nin the city of La Vega; they comprised a large number of the inhabitants\r\nof the island, for it was smelting time, when each brought his gold with\r\nhis Indians to have it melted, all meeting together as people do to make\r\npayments, in the places where fairs are held in Castile; as there were no\r\ngold coins, they made certain pieces in imitation of castellanos and\r\nducats, different sorts in the same smelting, where the King’s fifth was\r\nmelted and paid; these coins they offered [to the new priest] while others\r\nmade arrieles(24) to offer. Reales were current, and many of these were\r\npresented, all of which the newly ordained priest gave to his god-father,\r\nsave a few gold pieces that were especially well made.  There was one\r\nnotable feature of this first mass with which the clergy present were not\r\nsatisfied; namely, there was not a drop of wine in the whole feast,\r\nbecause no ship having arrived from Castile since a long time, there was\r\nnone in the entire island.”\r\n\r\nThe newly ordained priest entered immediately and zealously upon his\r\nduties, one of the first of which he considered to be the continuation of\r\nthe religious instruction to the Indians he had seen so admirably\r\ninitiated by Fray Pedro de Cordoba.  He speedily acquired great fame\r\nthroughout the colony both for his virtues and his learning, and his\r\ninfluence over the natives was established once and for ever.\r\n\r\nDon Diego Columbus undertook in 1511 to conquer and settle the island of\r\nCuba, which had been discovered by his father, and, by virtue of the\r\nprivileges secured to him by the capitulations of Granada, he named Diego\r\nVelasquez, a native of Cuellar and one of the oldest and most respected\r\ncolonists in San Domingo, commander of this enterprise.  The expedition,\r\nwhich consisted of three hundred men, amongst whom was Fernando Cortes,\r\nlanded at a port called Las Palmas in the province of Maici and the\r\nconquest was quickly and easily effected, the natives being of a pacific\r\ndisposition and little skilled in the use of even such indifferent weapons\r\nas they possessed.  Thirty Spaniards in Jamaica, hearing of the events in\r\nCuba, took service under Velasquez, who appointed Panfilo de Narvaez as\r\ncommander under his orders.  The campaign in Cuba was signalised by the\r\nsame massacres and cruelties which marked the advance of Spanish\r\ncivilisation throughout the Indies; the natives were pursued and torn to\r\npieces by fierce dogs, burned alive, their hands and feet cut off, and the\r\nmiserable, terrified remnant speedily reduced to a condition of hopeless\r\nslavery.  The so-called war ended with the execution of the Cacique\r\nHatuey, and in the early part of 1512, Diego Velasquez sent for Las Casas\r\nto join him from Hispaniola.  At that juncture there arrived in the port\r\nof Baracoa a vessel commanded by Cristobal de Cuellas, who brought with\r\nhim his daughter, the promised bride of Velasquez.  The Governor absented\r\nhimself for the celebration of his marriage, leaving his kinsman Juan de\r\nGrijalva in command of fifty men during his absence, and charging Las\r\nCasas to act as assistant and counsellor to Grijalva, who was a beardless\r\nyouth and, though of excellent disposition, was without experience.  The\r\nnews of Las Casas’s presence quickly spread amongst the Indians of Bayamo,\r\nwho had fled in terror before the horses of Narvaez into the province of\r\nCamaguey, and, feeling reassured and confident of protection, they now\r\nbegan to return little by little, asking pardon for the opposition they\r\nhad made to the Spanish force and offering to assist and serve the\r\ninvaders.  The veneration of the natives for Las Casas, their only friend,\r\nwas a most touching thing to see, for they trusted him without reserve,\r\nbelieving him to be omnipotent and knowing him to be good; they called him\r\nby the same title, Behique, which they gave to their own magicians and\r\nboth reverenced and feared him as being almost divine.  As the tribes came\r\nin, bringing gifts to the Spanish commander, they also brought offerings\r\nto Las Casas and when assured by him that the past was pardoned and\r\nforgotten, their confidence was completely restored.\r\n\r\nPeace being thus established in the province of Bayamo, Velasquez sent\r\norders to Narvaez that he should advance into the province of Camague with\r\nall the force he had, which, united to that of Grijalva, amounted to about\r\none hundred men, and that Las Casas should accompany the expedition.\r\n\r\nThe spiritual and martial forces seemed to work in harmony; Grijalva was\r\nobedient to the counsels of Las Casas, and Narvaez, although a hardened\r\ncampaigner and a man of violent temperament, was not indifferent to the\r\npriest’s influence, backed as he knew it to be by the warm personal\r\nsupport of his Governor, Velasquez.  Some thirty leagues from Bayamo, and\r\nbefore entering the province of Camaguey, the expedition arrived at a town\r\ncalled Cueyba, where they were well received by the Indians and where they\r\nfound, in a sort of chapel, a statue of the Blessed Virgin which had been\r\npresented to the cacique some time before by Alonso de Ojeda who, after\r\nshipwreck and untold hardships, had reached that place and been cared for\r\nby the natives.  Ojeda had carried this image for many weary days,\r\nconfiding in its protection to rescue him from the dangerous plight in\r\nwhich he found himself, and some of his companions who were now with the\r\nNarvaez party praised its beauty so highly to Las Casas that he conceived\r\nthe idea of offering to trade for it a very good Flemish statue of his\r\nown.  His proposal, however, was not agreeable to the cacique, who had, on\r\nhis part, become much attached to his own image, and the next morning when\r\nLas Casas went to the little chapel, which the Indians kept nicely adorned\r\nwith cotton hangings and flowers, he was surprised to see that the statue\r\nwas missing from its customary place above the altar.  Upon inquiry he was\r\ntold by the Indians that their chief, fearing that he would be forced to\r\naccept Las Casas’s offer to exchange, had taken his statue and fled into\r\nthe forests to save it.  There was even a fear that a general uprising\r\nmight result to defend the cherished statue, so Las Casas at once sent\r\nmessengers to the cacique to assure him that he not only no longer wished\r\nto make the exchange but had decided to make him a present of his own\r\nFlemish statue as well.\r\n\r\nTwenty leagues beyond Cueyba the expedition entered the province of\r\nCamaguey, and, at the entrance of the various towns, the Indians came out\r\nto welcome the Spaniards, offering them provisions of fish, game, and\r\ncassava.  Las Casas called together the children everywhere and baptised\r\nthem, concerning which he afterwards said that many were thus destined for\r\nglory in good time, for shortly afterwards there was hardly one of those\r\nchildren left alive.\r\n\r\nNothing inspired more wonder in the Indians than the transmission of news\r\nfrom one place to another by means of writing, and the letters the\r\nSpaniards sent to one another excited the greatest awe amongst them.  So\r\ngreat had the influence of Las Casas amongst them become, that he had only\r\nto send any piece of paper fastened to the end of a stick, carried by a\r\nmessenger who had been instructed to say what he wanted, for his orders to\r\nbe scrupulously obeyed; without the paper, the verbal message was shorn of\r\nits authority, with the paper it commanded entire obedience.  To forestall\r\nexcesses on the part of the soldiers, Las Casas hit upon the device of\r\nsending a messenger ahead, carrying one of these papers, to tell the\r\nIndians that the expedition was approaching and that he desired them to\r\nhave provisions ready and to vacate one part of their village which the\r\nSpaniards might occupy.  The messenger announced these dispositions, which\r\nmust be obeyed under pain of the Behique’s displeasure, and the Spaniards,\r\non their arrival, invariably found everything prepared for them and free\r\nquarters in which to lodge.  Narvaez agreed to give strict orders to his\r\nmen to keep to their own part of the village, and any one who violated\r\nthis command or sought to mix with the Indians was punished.\r\n\r\nAt a village called Caonao, one of the characteristic pieces of\r\ninexplicable cruelty, that so frequently occurred, took place.  Before\r\nreaching that town, the expedition had stopped to eat in a dry river bed\r\n(barranca), where there was a quantity of soapstone on which the men\r\nsharpened their weapons.  Upon entering the town and before taking\r\npossession of their quarters, they found some two thousand Indians\r\npeaceably squatting about the square, after their fashion, curious to see\r\nthem and observe the movements of the wonderful horses at which they never\r\ntired of looking.  While the provisions which the Indians had got ready\r\nwere being distributed, somebody—it was never discovered who—without cause\r\nor rhyme or reason suddenly ran amok, drew his sword, and began slashing\r\nright and left amongst the defenceless natives, and, as though crazed, the\r\nother soldiers fell to work in the same fashion, so that, before one half\r\nthe Indians realised what was happening, the place was piled with dead and\r\nwounded.  Narvaez looked on unmoved, but Las Casas, who was not in the\r\nsquare when the massacre began, hearing what was afoot, rushed thither in\r\nrage and despair to stop the slaughter. “What do you think of what our\r\nSpaniards have done?” Narvaez coolly asked him, and the priest in a fury\r\nreplied: “To the devil with you and your Spaniards.” He finally succeeded\r\nin arresting the butchery, not forgetting, in the midst of all, to\r\nadminister baptism to the dying.  His indignation on this occasion burst\r\nall bounds and, from his own description, it may be inferred that his\r\nlanguage towards his countrymen was not in strict conformity with\r\nsacerdotal usage.  No sufficient explanation of this lamentable occurrence\r\nhas ever been given, but Las Casas says that if the man who began the\r\nmassacre was the one he suspected, he later met a dreadful death.  It has\r\nbeen alleged that a soldier mistook some movement of the crowd in pressing\r\nforward to see the horses, for a beginning of hostilities, and, as there\r\nhad been a surprise practised on Narvaez’s men a short time before in\r\nBayamo, the man was seized with a sudden panic of fear that the little\r\nforce of one hundred men was about to be attacked and overcome by mere\r\nforce of numbers while off their guard, lost his head, and began to use\r\nhis sword; the others, seeing their comrade fighting, rushed into the\r\nmelee and before reason could get the upper hand, the mischief was done.\r\nThe natural consequence of this unprovoked massacre was a general flight\r\nof the Indians from their towns, all who could, taking refuge in the\r\nneighbouring islands.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish camp was established near Caonao and one day shortly after the\r\nmassacre an old Indian servant of Las Casas, called Camacho, came to him\r\nto say that a young man about twenty-five years old and his younger\r\nbrother had returned and begged to be admitted as servants into his\r\nhousehold.  This young Indian was baptised under the name of Adrianico and\r\nserved as interpreter and intermediary to induce the other Indians to\r\nreturn to their villages, so that little by little some degree of peace\r\nand tranquillity was established throughout the province.  The Governor\r\nquickly discovered that the simplest means of securing obedience was to\r\nsend a messenger bearing any bit of paper on a stick, to say in the name\r\nof Las Casas whatever was to be done, and this became the means usually\r\nemployed to maintain order.  Thousands of the natives were instructed and\r\nbaptised during this expedition.  It was at this time that news was\r\nreceived of the existence of several Spanish prisoners held by a cacique,\r\nin the province of Havana, some hundred leagues distant, and Las Casas\r\nsent his habitual Indian messenger carrying the sacred paper to tell that\r\ncacique that the paper meant he was to send those prisoners at once, under\r\npain of the Behique’s severest displeasure.  After the departure of this\r\nmessenger, the Spaniards struck their camp and went on to a place called\r\nCarahale, which Las Casas named Casaharta on account of the abundance of\r\nexcellent provisions they received there; these seem to have consisted\r\nprincipally of parrots, of which the Spaniards consumed no less than\r\n10,000 beautifully plumaged birds in the brief period of fifteen days they\r\nstopped there.  Indeed, the amount the Spaniards ate amazed the frugal\r\nnatives, for it took more to feed a soldier for one day than an Indian\r\nfamily required in a month, At this place there arrived one day a canoe,\r\nin which were two Spanish women, in the costume of Mother Eve, one of them\r\nabout forty years old and the other eighteen.  They were the prisoners\r\nsent back from Havana by the cacique who had meanwhile received the magic\r\npaper ordering their release.  They described the slaughter of some\r\nSpaniards upon their arrival at the port which, since that time, has\r\nconsequently been called Matanzas; several had managed to defend\r\nthemselves but had afterwards been hanged by a cacique on a ceiba tree,\r\nleaving only the two women, whose lives were spared.  This news so\r\nirritated Narvaez that he ordered eighteen caciques who had come in\r\nresponse to Las Casas’s papers, bringing food for the Spaniards, to be put\r\nin chains, and but for the priest’s threat that he would have him severely\r\npunished by Velasquez, and even report the case to the King, he would have\r\nhanged them.  Las Casas, by his vigorous and menacing attitude, secured\r\nthe immediate release of all the caciques but one, who was kept a prisoner\r\nuntil Diego Velasquez joined the expedition and released him. (25)\r\n\r\nAt another village, a Spaniard, also a survivor of the Matanzas massacre,\r\nwas brought forward and delivered to the Spaniards by the cacique, who\r\ndeclared he loved him and had treated him as his own son.  Great rejoicing\r\ncelebrated the finding of this man, and both Las Casas and Narvaez\r\nembraced the cacique with fervour.  The Spaniard had nearly forgotten his\r\nmother-tongue and was in all respects so entirely like the Indians in his\r\nmanners and ways that every one laughed a good deal at him.  Little by\r\nlittle he recovered the use of his Spanish and was able to give much\r\ninformation concerning the country.\r\n\r\nUpon the arrival of Diego Velasquez, whose bride had died very shortly\r\nafter her marriage, a town was founded on the banks of a large river,\r\ncalled by the Indians the Arimao, where very rich gold-mines were\r\ndiscovered.  In this newly founded town of Xagua, as it was named, Las\r\nCasas received a valuable repartimiento of land and Indians in recognition\r\nof the services he had rendered during the expeditions, for, though he was\r\nthe enemy of all cruel treatment and the protector of the natives against\r\nhis callous-hearted countrymen, his conscience on the subject of\r\nrepartimientos was not yet fully awakened.\r\n\r\nDuring his residence in the island of Hispaniola, Las Casas had been close\r\nfriends with a man named Renteria, whom he describes as a most virtuous,\r\nprudent, charitable, and devout Christian, given entirely to the things of\r\nGod and religion and little versed in the things of this world, to which\r\nhe paid small attention; he was so open-handed by instinct that his\r\ngenerosity was almost the vice of carelessness rather than a virtue.  He\r\nwas pure and humble in his life and was a man of some learning, devoted to\r\nthe study of the Scriptures and commentaries to the Latin tongue, and was\r\na skilful penman. Pedro de la Renteria, to whom Diego Velasquez had given\r\nthe office of alcalde in the island of Cuba was a Biscayan, son of a\r\nnative of Guipuzcoa, and such was the intimacy between him and Las Casas\r\nin Hispaniola that they shared their possessions in common, though in the\r\nmanagement of their affairs, it was the latter who took the direction\r\nentirely, as being the more capable and practical of the two. (26)\r\n\r\nUpon Pedro de la Renteria, the Governor conferred a repartimiento of lands\r\nand Indians adjoining the one given to Las Casas and the two had their\r\nbusiness interests in common.  Las Casas owns, with compunction, that he\r\nbecame so absorbed at that time in developing his new estates and working\r\nhis mines that what should have been his principal care, the instruction\r\nof the Indians, fell into the second place, though despite his temporary\r\nblindness to his higher duties, he protests that, as far as their temporal\r\nwants were concerned, he was humane and kind, both from his naturally\r\nbenevolent instincts and from his understanding of the law of God.  This\r\nwe may easily believe to be the case and, though his zealous soul may\r\nafterwards, when all his energies of body and mind were exclusively\r\ndedicated to his apostolate, have found grounds for self-reproach for\r\nneglecting the spiritual wants of his Indians at that time, it is more\r\nthan probable that, even so, his care of them might well have served as a\r\npattern to his fellow-colonists and more than satisfied the natives, who\r\nadored him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. - THE SERMONS OF FRAY ANTONIO DE MONTESINOS.  THE AWAKENING OF\r\nLAS CASAS.  PEDRO DE LA RENTERIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe company of four Dominican monks under their Prior, Pedro de Cordoba,\r\nhad been increased until their community numbered twelve or fifteen men,\r\nthe severity of whose rule had been much augmented in the New World in\r\norder to maintain the just proportion between their penitential lives and\r\nthe hard conditions of the colony in which they lived.  Their observation\r\nof what was happening around them and of the injustice and cruelty daily\r\npractised on the natives in defiance of the wishes of the Spanish\r\nsovereigns, forced upon them the duty of protesting against such violation\r\nof all laws, human and divine.  They had received into their community, as\r\na lay-brother, a man who, two years before, had murdered his Indian wife\r\nand had afterwards fled to the forests where he lived as best he could.\r\nThe information furnished by this repentant criminal still further\r\namplified the insight of the monks into the treatment meted out to the\r\nIndians and quickened their determination to attempt to stay the\r\niniquities of their countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe first man to raise his voice publicly in America against slavery and\r\nall forms of oppression of the Indians was Fray Antonio de Montesinos, who\r\npreached to the colonists of Santo Domingo a discourse, of which\r\nunfortunately no full report now exists.  The monks had made a point of\r\ninviting the Viceroy, the Treasurer, Passamonte, and all the officials to\r\nbe present in church on the Sunday fixed for the sermon, and it was known\r\nthroughout the colony that a matter of particular importance was to be the\r\nsubject of the discourse, though no one suspected its nature.  The text\r\nchosen was from St. John: “I am the voice of one crying in the\r\nwilderness,” and the friar, who was blessed with the dual gifts of\r\neloquence and moral courage, drove his arguments and admonitions home with\r\nsuch force that, though he was heard to the close without interruption,\r\nthe principal persons of the colony held a meeting after church and\r\ndecided that the preaching of such revolutionary doctrines must be\r\nsilenced.  They repaired to the monastery to make their protest, and to\r\ndemand that Fray Antonio should retract or modify his words the following\r\nSunday.  The Prior received the angry deputation and, after listening to\r\ntheir demands, informed them that the discourse preached by Fray Antonio\r\nrepresented the sentiments of the entire Dominican community and had been\r\npronounced with his full approbation.  The colonists became only the more\r\nenraged at this answer and declared that, unless the preacher retracted,\r\nthe monks should pack their goods and return to Spain, to which the prior\r\nwith quiet irony replied: “Of a truth, gentlemen, that will give us little\r\ntrouble”; which indeed was the fact, for Las Casas says that all they\r\npossessed of books, vestments, and clothing would have gone into two\r\ntrunks.  The most that the Prior would concede was that the subject should\r\nbe treated again on the following Sunday.\r\n\r\nFray Antonio once more ascended the pulpit and before the assembled colony\r\nannounced his text: “Repetam scientiam meam a principio et operatorem meum\r\nprobabo justum” (Job xxxvi. 3).  Not only did he repeat the sense of what\r\nhe had already said, but he elaborated still more forcibly his theme, and\r\nended by announcing that the sacraments of the Church would henceforth be\r\nrefused to all who persisted in the evil courses he denounced, and defying\r\nhis hearers to complain of him in Spain.\r\n\r\nAmongst the men on whose startled ears these denunciations fell, were\r\nhidalgos of high birth, reduced by reckless courses to expatriate\r\nthemselves in search of fortunes with which to return and resume their\r\nextravagances in Spain; contemptuous of all forms of labour, they passed\r\ntheir enforced exile in gambling, dicing, and debauchery in the company of\r\ntheir Indian mistresses, chosen among the native beauties.   They\r\nalternately courted the favour of the Viceroy or intrigued against him as\r\nseemed most profitable to their interests; they displayed few of the\r\nvirtues and most of the vices common to their class in Spain.  Others\r\nbelonged in the unfailing and numerous category of adventurers, ever ready\r\nto play a new stake in a new country; they constituted an equally reckless\r\nbut more resourceful element in the colony, though their contribution to\r\nthe moral tone of the community was likewise insignificant.  Columbus had\r\nsought and obtained an authorisation to deport from Spain criminals under\r\nsentence of either partial or perpetual banishment, while other\r\ndelinquents had had their sentences remitted on condition that they would\r\nemigrate to the Indies.  So dissolute was the general tone of the colonies\r\nand so depraved the habits of many of the colonists that Columbus could,\r\nwith sincerity, exclaim, “I vow that numbers of men have gone to the\r\nIndies who did not deserve water from God or man.”\r\n\r\nLas Casas, who loved sinners as much as he loathed sin, observed this\r\nmotley population with a more tolerant eye and affirmed that even amongst\r\nthose who had lost their ears, he still found sufficiently honest men; it\r\nwas not difficult to lose one’s ears in those days.  The voice of Fray\r\nAntonio cried indeed in a moral wilderness!  But however far these men had\r\nstrayed from the true spirit of their religion, they had no intention of\r\nforegoing the ministrations of the church, and they clung tenaciously to\r\nthe outward observance of forms and ceremonies as an offset against their\r\nlax conformity to its moral precepts.\r\n\r\nTo be thus placed between the ban of excommunication and the renunciation\r\nof their illegally held slaves, was an intolerable prospect.  Appeal or\r\nprotest to the Prior being useless, they despatched complaint to the King\r\nand chose for the bearer of it a Franciscan friar, Alonso de Espinal, who\r\nwas instructed to unite his efforts to those of two other agents, who had\r\nalready been sent to obtain an extension of the encomienda privileges.\r\nThe Dominicans sent as their representative to contest the case, the\r\noffending preacher himself, some generous sympathisers having been found\r\nin the colony to furnish the money for the expenses of his journey.\r\n\r\nThe advocate for the colonists found all doors open to him and his way\r\nmade easy, for there were not a few of the courtiers and other great\r\npersonages in Spain who derived large profits from the abusive traffic in\r\nthe Indies, but the Dominican was friendless and met with obstacles on\r\nevery hand which barred his access to the King.  He managed after some\r\nexercise of patience to outwit the gentlemen in attendance, and, forcing\r\nhis way into the King’s presence, begged to be heard.  Upon receiving the\r\nroyal permission to speak, the monk unfolded such a tale that the King sat\r\nstupefied with horror at his ghastly recital.  “Did your Highness order\r\nsuch deeds to be done?” asked the monk. “No, by God, never on my life,”\r\nreplied the King.  The immediate result of King Ferdinand’s aroused\r\nconscience was, that a commission was formed to inquire into the case and\r\nto take information on which to base a report to his Majesty.  The sense\r\nof this report was that the Indians were freemen, but must be instructed\r\nin the Christian religion; that they might be made to labour, but not in\r\nsuch wise as to hinder their conversion nor in excess of their strength;\r\nthat they should have houses and be allowed sufficient time to cultivate\r\ntheir own lands; that they should be kept in touch with the Christians and\r\nthat they should be paid wages for their work, which might be in clothing\r\nand furnishings rather than in money.\r\n\r\nWhile the discussions inside the commission were going on, the agents of\r\nthe colonists were active in presenting their side of the case.  Fray\r\nAntonio was likewise losing no time, and was astonishingly successful in\r\nthat he won over the very Franciscan whom the colonists had sent to plead\r\ntheir cause, and converted him into his staunch ally and supporter.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of this controversy was the code of laws promulgated at Burgos\r\non Dec. 27, 1512, and known as the Laws of Burgos.  They were afterwards\r\nconsiderably added to by another commission, in which the Prior, Pedro de\r\nCordoba, who had come to Spain and seen the King, sat, and their\r\nprovisions, had they been conscientiously carried out in the sense their\r\nframers designed, would have considerably ameliorated the condition of the\r\nIndians.  They constitute the first public recognition of the rights of\r\nthe Indians and an attempt, at least, to amend their wrongs.\r\n\r\nThree years elapsed between the date of Fray Antonio’s first courageous\r\nplea on behalf of the Indians and the entrance of Las Casas upon the\r\nactive apostolate in their favour, to which the of his long life was\r\ndevoted.  There being no other priest at hand, Las Casas was invited to\r\nsay mass and preach at Baracoa on the feast of Pentecost in 1514, and in\r\nsearching the Scriptures for a suitable text he happened upon the\r\nfollowing verses in the thirty-fourth chapter of Ecclesiasticus, which\r\narrested his attention and started the train of reasoning destined to\r\nproduce great results.\r\n\r\n“He that sacrificeth of a thing wrongfully gotten, his offering is\r\nridiculous, and the gifts of unjust men are not accepted.  The most High\r\nis not pleased with the offerings of the wicked; neither is He pacified\r\nfor sin by the multitude of sacrifices.”\r\n\r\n“Whoso bringeth an offering of the goods of the poor doeth as one that\r\nkilleth the son before his father’s eyes.”\r\n\r\n“The bread of the needy is their life; he that defraudeth him thereof is a\r\nman of blood.”\r\n\r\n“He that taketh away his neighbour’s living, slayeth him; and he that\r\ndefraudeth the labourer of his hire is a bloodshedder.”\r\n\r\nThe perusal of these simply worded texts, replete with terrible\r\nsignificance, quickened the conscience of Las Casas more powerfully than\r\nthe spectacle of actual enormities happening daily for years under his\r\nvery eyes, though doubtless the influence of these many occurrences was\r\ncumulative and had led him, gradually and unconsciously, up to the state\r\nwhen but a touch was necessary to strip the last disguise from the heinous\r\nabuses practised in the colony.  Until then he had been zealous in\r\nprotecting the Indians against massacre and pillage, but to the injustice\r\nof the servitude imposed upon them, he was insensible, and he recounts\r\nhumbly enough that he had himself once been refused the sacraments by a\r\nDominican friar in Hispaniola—possibly the redoubtable Montesinos\r\nhimself—because he was a slave-holder.  He sustained a discussion on the\r\nsubject with the obdurate monk, whom he describes as a worthy and learned\r\nman, but to little purpose, and the Dominican wound up by telling him that\r\n“the truth has ever had many enemies, and falsehood many defenders.” Las\r\nCasas, though somewhat impressed by what had passed between them, took no\r\nheed of the admonition to release his Indians, and sought absolution from\r\na more lenient confessor.\r\n\r\nMuch time and many terrible experiences were required to germinate and\r\ndevelop the seed the Dominicans had sown in his soul, but the day of\r\nfruition came with the peaceful preparation of a discourse suitable for\r\nthe glorious feast of Pentecost, the birthday of the Church, into whose\r\nperpetual custody were committed the doctrines of Christ, to be infallibly\r\nguarded.  Instead of disbursing these spiritual treasures to the humble\r\nIndians amongst whom he lived as a superior being, almost deified in their\r\nsimple minds, he had profited by their labours as selfishly as the most\r\ngodless layman in the island, without making an effort to gather them into\r\none fold, under one shepherd, which, as a Christian priest, should have\r\nbeen his chief occupation. But if the awakening was slow, it was complete,\r\nand Las Casas was not one to shrink from following his beliefs to their\r\nlogical conclusions; not only was his newly formed conviction that the\r\ntreatment accorded to the Indians was a flagrant violation of all justice,\r\nand one that merited condemnation in this world and condign punishment in\r\nthe next, absolute, but the first consequence following from it, and which\r\nseemed to him imperative, was that he should forthwith set the example to\r\nhis fellow-colonists of freeing his serfs; the second was the devotion of\r\nall his powers to making others see the wickedness of the system by which\r\nthey profited, and the terrible moral responsibility they would incur by\r\npersisting in it.  He formed his determination to preach this crusade in\r\nseason and out and to henceforth use every weapon in defence of the\r\ndowntrodden natives.\r\n\r\nAlthough he treated his own Indians kindly, and he well knew that if he\r\nrenounced his “encomienda” their condition would doubtless be worse under\r\nthe power of their new owner than before, Las Casas perceived how\r\nimpossible it would be to preach justice for the Indians while he himself\r\nheld them in bondage.\r\n\r\nHe went to the Governor, Diego Velasquez, and opened his mind fully on the\r\nsubject, declaring that as his conscience no longer permitted him to hold\r\nhis Indians in subjection, he had come to surrender them; and, admonishing\r\nthe Governor of his own grave responsibility, he announced that henceforth\r\nhis mission would be to preach this doctrine.  He desired for the moment\r\nthat his resolution should not be made public until the return to Cuba of\r\nhis friend and partner, Renteria, who was at that time absent in Jamaica\r\nbuying pigs and farm seeds.\r\n\r\nThe Governor listened with amazement to this new and, to him, monstrous\r\ndoctrine and, out of friendly interest for Las Casas, and possibly\r\nthinking that his present intentions might subside if the renunciation of\r\nhis property could be deferred, he counselled him to go slowly, saying,\r\n“Look well, father, to what you are doing, lest you may repent, for before\r\nGod I would wish to see you rich and prosperous.”  He urged him to take\r\nfifteen days for careful consideration of the matter and to then return\r\nand discuss his intentions.  This did not suit the temper of Las Casas who\r\nanswered: “My lord, I am much honoured by your desire for my prosperity\r\nand for all the other favours you do me; but consider, my lord, that the\r\nfifteen days have passed, and should I repent of my intention I have\r\nexpressed to you and desire to hold the Indians, and should you, out of\r\nthe regard you bear me, wish me to keep them or to renew your grant to me,\r\nmay it please God to punish you severely, nor to pardon you this sin.  I\r\nonly beg your lordship that all this shall remain secret and that you will\r\nnot grant the Indians to any one, until Renteria’s return, so that his\r\naffairs may sustain no damage.”\r\n\r\nThe Governor reluctantly agreed and his respect for Las Casas being much\r\nincreased, he thenceforward forward consulted him in all that concerned\r\nthe welfare of the Indians.\r\n\r\nOn the feast of the Assumption, Las Casas preached a sermon on the\r\ncontemplative, as compared with the active life, in the course of which he\r\nyielded to an impulse to make his intention publicly known.  Turning\r\ntowards the Governor’s seat, he said: “My lord, I give you permission to\r\ntell to all what we have privately agreed upon between us, and I avail\r\nmyself of the same to announce it to all here present.” He then launched\r\ninto a fervid discourse upon the blindness, the injustice, the tyranny and\r\ncruelty that marked the colonists’ treatment of the Indians, declaring\r\nthat their salvation was to be despaired of unless they liberated their\r\nslaves and treated the natives humanely.  The assembly was moved to\r\nmingled admiration and astonishment, for most of the colonists would as\r\nsoon have thought it a sin to work their beasts of burden as their\r\nIndians, so deeply ingrained was their belief that the natives were\r\ncreated to serve them.  Some were stimulated to sentiments of compunction,\r\nbut not to the extent of imitating the preacher’s heroic example of\r\nrenouncing the source of his income in deference to his moral principles.\r\n(27)\r\n\r\nWhile Las Casas was passing through these experiences in Cuba, his friend\r\nand partner, Renteria, was, by a singular coincidence, arriving at\r\nanalogous convictions concerning the Indians and pondering upon the\r\nformation of some plan by which the diminishing remnant of them might be\r\nrescued from servitude and converted to the Christian religion.   During\r\nlent of that year he made a retreat in a Franciscan monastery in Jamaica\r\nwhither, as has been said, he had gone to procure farm stock.  During this\r\nperiod of seclusion from temporal distractions, he came to the conclusion\r\nthat the best means to benefit the natives would be to found several\r\nschools or colleges into which the Indian boys and younger men might be\r\ncollected, and he formed the determination to go himself, if necessary, to\r\nSpain and seek royal approval and support for this project.  Las Casas had\r\nmeantime become so impatient of further delay in beginning his labours\r\nthat, having made public his intentions, he abandoned his original idea of\r\nwaiting for Renteria’s return before starting for Spain.  Although he was\r\nwithout funds and had no means of getting any save by the sale of a mare\r\nworth a hundred pesos of gold, he wrote to Renteria telling him that he\r\nwas about leaving Cuba for Spain on business of great importance, so that,\r\nif his friend wished to see him before he started, he must hasten back\r\nfrom Jamaica.  Renteria, in consequence, finished his business in the\r\nisland and returned as quickly as possible to Cuba, where he was met upon\r\nlanding by the Governor, Las Casas, and numerous others, for he was a very\r\npopular and much esteemed man in the colony.  It was only when the two\r\nfriends finally found themselves alone that an exchange of confidences\r\nbecame possible, and Renteria, yielding to the insistence of Las Casas,\r\nunfolded his plan for the establishment of Indian schools.  Each in turn\r\nwas surprised and gratified to learn the project of the other and, after\r\nsome discussion and arguments, it was decided that, of the two, Las Casas\r\nwas the one who must go to Spain.  Renteria disposed of his Jamaica\r\npurchases and, out of the profits, furnished his friend with money enough\r\nto defray the expenses of what was foreseen would be a long and doubtless\r\ncostly sojourn at court.\r\n\r\nAt this same juncture, the Dominican Prior in Santo Domingo sent four of\r\nhis monks to establish a community in Cuba, choosing as their Prior, Fray\r\nBernardo, who is described as both a pious and a learned man.  The\r\nGovernor of Cuba received these religious with great satisfaction, but to\r\nno one did their coming afford greater joy than to Las Casas.  The\r\nDominicans began a series of earnest and edifying sermons, in the course\r\nof which practical applications of Scripture texts were made to the actual\r\ncondition of affairs in the colony; and, by using the information\r\nfurnished them by Las Casas, the preachers were able to make very forcible\r\nhome thrusts on the subject of the injustice of the system of serfage and\r\nthe grave responsibility of those Spaniards who oppressed the Indians.\r\nThese sermons disturbed the conscience of the colonists but not to the\r\npoint of amending their evil system, so the chief result was a general\r\nfeeling of dissatisfaction within themselves and one of intensified\r\nexasperation towards the preachers of such uncomfortable doctrine.  The\r\nmonks, on their part, realising that it was idle to combat with purely\r\nspiritual weapons a system of evils which everybody was interested in\r\nmaintaining, perceived their only hope of success lay in having their\r\nhands strengthened by royal support, and accordingly their Prior decided\r\nto go to Spain with Las Casas, where they might co-operate in their\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. - LAS CASAS RETURNS TO SPAIN.  NEGOTIATIONS.  CARDINAL XIMENEZ\r\nDE CISNEROS.  THE JERONYMITE COMMISSIONERS\r\n\r\n\r\nLas Casas was fully conscious of the hostility his mission was bound to\r\nprovoke, and how odious he would make himself, not only to the colonists,\r\nbut also to the members of the India Council, the courtiers, and to many\r\ninfluential persons in Spain, all of whom had investments in the colonies\r\nand drew incomes from the very abuses he was to combat; he therefore took\r\nthe precaution of drawing up a sworn and witnessed statement, ad perpetuam\r\nrei memoriam, with the legal formalities dear to Spanish usage, in which\r\nhe recounted all the services of every kind that he had rendered in the\r\ncolonies.  Lest obstacles might be put in the way of his departure, he\r\nresorted to a little dissimulation and caused the report to be spread that\r\nhe intended to go to Paris to finish his law studies and take his degree\r\nat the university there.  The colonists, including the Governor, were\r\nduped by this subterfuge and he departed in company with the Prior, who\r\ntook with him a deacon of his order, Fray Diego de Alberca.  The first\r\nstage of their journey was to Hispaniola, where the Prior was seized by a\r\nsevere illness, to which he succumbed in the town of San Juan de la\r\nMaguana.\r\n\r\nIn the city of Santo Domingo, Las Casas encountered his old friend and\r\nprecursor in the defence of the Indians, Prior Pedro de Cordoba, to whom\r\nhe recounted all that had befallen him in Cuba, his newly found vocation,\r\nand his intention to visit Spain and lay the case for the Indians before\r\nthe King.  The Prior praised his resolution, but in wishing him all\r\nsuccess, he explained the situation he would find awaiting him in Spain,\r\nwhere the all-powerful Bishop of Burgos, who was at the head of Indian\r\naffairs, and the royal Secretary, Lope Conchillos, were entirely in favour\r\nof the system of repartimientos and encomiendas, being themselves\r\nshareholders in colonial enterprises.  As not uncommonly happens, it was\r\non the estates of such absentee owners that the Indians were most cruelly\r\nhandled, being mercilessly overworked by overseers anxious to curry favour\r\nat home by the remittance of ever-increasing revenues.\r\n\r\nAlthough he was sufficiently impressed by what he heard, the zeal of the\r\nnew apostle was undiminished.  The Dominican community in Hispaniola being\r\nin sad need of funds, the Prior decided to profit by the occasion and to\r\nsend one of his monks with Las Casas to Spain to solicit aid.  He chose\r\nfor this mission the same Fray Antonio de Montesinos, whose earnestness in\r\nbehalf of the natives rendered him a sympathetic companion, while his own\r\nexperience in handling the question in Spain, promised to be of great\r\nassistance to Las Casas.  They sailed in September, 1515, and after a\r\nprosperous voyage arrived safely at Seville, where Montesinos lodged in\r\nthe monastery of his Order, while Las Casas was given hospitality by his\r\nrelatives.\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop of Seville at that time was Fray Diego de Deza, a Dominican\r\nwho stood high in King Ferdinand’s favour, and the first service\r\nMontesinos rendered his companion was to present him to the Archbishop, to\r\nwhom he had already given some account of the objects which brought them\r\nboth to Spain, and of the zeal of Las Casas in a cause which the Dominican\r\nOrder had made peculiarly its own.  It required no persuasion to enlist\r\nthe good offices of the Archbishop, who was in entire sympathy with their\r\nundertaking and promptly furnished Las Casas with a warm letter to the\r\nKing, commending both the cause and its advocate.  To facilitate his\r\napproach to the King, he furnished Las Casas also with letters to\r\ninfluential persons in the royal household.\r\n\r\nNo better beginning could have been desired, and Las Casas set out for\r\nPlasencia where the King then was, arriving there a few days before\r\nChristmas in the year 1515.  Thanks to the counsels and information given\r\nhim by Montesinos, Las Casas knew something of the court and upon what\r\npersons he might count, who might still be won over, and who were to be\r\navoided.  Among these last, the most notorious and powerful opponents were\r\nthe Bishop of Burgos and the Secretary, Lope Conchillos.  Whatever virtues\r\nthe former may have possessed they were certainly not of the apostolic\r\norder and his appointment to the high office of President of the India\r\nCouncil was one of the earliest and greatest calamities that overtook\r\nAmerican interests.  Las Casas was careful, therefore, to defer meeting\r\nthese two personages and to refrain from disclosing the object of his\r\npresence until he should have first secured a hearing from the King, whose\r\nsympathy he hoped to enlist before his opponents could prejudice the\r\nmonarch against him.  Again fortune favoured him, and two days before\r\nChristmas he was closeted with the King, and explained in the fullest\r\ndetail the state of things in the islands; the extinction of the natives,\r\nwhich was following rapidly on the barbarities and rapacity of the\r\nSpaniards, and the violation of the royal provisions which the benevolence\r\nof the late Queen and the sagacity of the King had decreed.  He was astute\r\nenough to couple with the argument that these iniquities lay heavily on\r\nthe royal conscience, the assurance that the revenues from the Indies\r\nwould infallibly diminish until they ceased altogether, unless these\r\ncrying abuses were corrected.  In this conversation the charming\r\npersonality, cultivated intelligence, and earnest convictions of Las Casas\r\ntold powerfully, and he recounted horrifying incidents to the astonished\r\nsovereign which, it may be rightly imagined, lost nothing in the recital\r\nby such an eloquent and fervent advocate.  Again he was completely\r\nsuccessful, for King Ferdinand promised him another and longer audience\r\nbefore Easter in which he would go more fully into the matter.  He slyly\r\nnotes in closing his own description of the audience and its results, that\r\nneither Conchillos nor the Bishop of Burgos was much overjoyed when they\r\nheard from the King what subject was under discussion.\r\n\r\nDiego Velasquez was well aware that Las Casas would spare no means to\r\ncarry on his propaganda and that his first step would doubtless be to\r\nengage the attention of the Admiral, Diego Columbus, whose lieutenant\r\nVelasquez was, and that of the King as well, if he could reach him.  He\r\nwrote therefore to the Treasurer, Passamonte, who in turn wrote to\r\nConchillos and the Bishop of Burgos warning them of what was on foot.\r\n\r\nThe monks of the Dominican Order were, in those days, to be found in many\r\nposts of influence, not the least of which was that of confessor to the\r\nKing, and to Fray Tomas de Matiencio, the ghostly father of King\r\nFerdinand, Las Casas did not fail to go at the outset.  Matiencio had\r\nalready shown pronounced sympathy with the cause of the Indians and was,\r\ntherefore, to be counted upon as a firm ally, both because of his personal\r\nconvictions and for motives of solidarity with his Order.  Through his\r\nconfessor, Ferdinand sent to tell Las Casas that he should preceed him to\r\nSeville and wait for his arrival there, when the promised audience would\r\nbe granted him; the King’s departure was fixed for the fourth day after\r\nChristmas, so it may be seen that this affair did not drag just then at\r\nthe Spanish court.   The confessor also advised Las Casas not to avoid the\r\nBishop of Burgos and Conchillos; but, on the contrary, to go openly to\r\nboth and to explain as frankly to them as he had done to the King, the\r\nexact condition of the Indians, the motives which had prompted him to\r\nintervene, and the measures he judged necessary to stop the depopulation\r\nand ruin of the colonies.  Matiencio reasoned that, as the matter must\r\nultimately come into the hands of these two men, and as they had to be\r\nreckoned with, it was far wiser to give them the fullest information at\r\nthe outset, hoping also that Las Casas’s moving description of the\r\nsufferings the Indians endured might modify their opposition.  This\r\ncounsel did not accord with the plan of Las Casas but he allowed his\r\njudgment to be overruled by the royal confessor’s advice and sought out\r\nConchillos as being the less intractable of the two.  The letter from the\r\nArchbishop of Seville procured him a courteous reception and had he come\r\nseeking a benefice or some preferment from the King, he might have counted\r\nupon the favour and assistance of the Secretary to advance his suit, but,\r\nas he piously phrases it, he had, by divine mercy, been rescued from the\r\ndarkness in which, like all the others, he had wandered, a lost man, and\r\nwas liberated from all desire for any temporal benefits.  Save the\r\ngracious words and courtly blandishments which Conchillos showered upon\r\nhim, nothing resulted from the interview.\r\n\r\nHis reception by the Bishop of Burgos was of a totally different order\r\nand, though it is to be lamented that this prelate did not possess more of\r\nthe virtues becoming his state, it must be noted in his favour that\r\nhypocrisy was wanting in his unlovely character.  Amongst other atrocities\r\nwhich Las Casas brought to his attention was the death of seven thousand\r\nIndian children within three months, on which he dwelt, hoping to touch\r\nsome humane chord in the Bishop.  He was deceived. “Look what an ignorant\r\nfool you are!” exclaimed his lordship. “What is this to me or what to the\r\nKing?” This rough answer goaded his patience beyond control and Las Casas\r\nshouted in reply: “That all these souls perish is nothing to you and\r\nnothing to the King!  Oh, Eternal God! then to whom is it anything?”  With\r\nthis he left the Bishop’s presence.\r\n\r\nThe activity of Las Casas, his earnestness and his eloquence produced\r\nimmediate effects, for he forced Indian affairs upon the languid attention\r\nof indifferent people and aroused so much interest in them that they\r\nbecame a topic of general discussion.  He recounted his experiences to\r\nArchbishop Deza on his return to Seville, and begged him to arrange that\r\nboth Conchillos and the Bishop of Burgos should be present at the audience\r\nthe King had promised him, so that he might put the case fully, for he\r\ndesired to charge them directly in the royal presence with responsibility\r\nfor the massacres and cruelties to the Indians and for the damage done to\r\nthe royal interests by their maladministration of the colonies.  His\r\nproject for this dramatic encounter was forestalled, and all the hopes\r\nborn of the royal assurances given him at Plasencia were dashed by the\r\nnews that reached Seville of the death of King Ferdinand, which occurred\r\nat Madrigalegos on January 23, 1516.\r\n\r\nThis sudden stoppage of his carefully planned campaign was discouraging\r\nenough to Las Casas but he was not disheartened, and resolved to set out\r\nat once for Flanders where the young King Charles then was and to present\r\nhis plans to the monarch before he arrived in Spain.\r\n\r\nKing Ferdinand’s last will designated Cardinal Ximenez de Cisneros as\r\nregent of the kingdom until his successor’s arrival in Spain.\r\n\r\nIn a century prolific in great men, Cardinal Ximenez de Cisneros was among\r\nthe greatest.  Descended from an honourable family, he entered the Church,\r\nwhere a career of great promise opened before him.  At an early age,\r\nhowever, he quit the secular priesthood for the cloister and became a monk\r\nof the Franciscan Order, in which the austerity of his observance of that\r\nsevere rule of life and the vigour of his intellect advanced him to the\r\nposition of a Provincial.\r\n\r\nMuch against his own inclination, he had accepted the post of confessor to\r\nQueen Isabella and from thence forward he became, in spite of himself, a\r\ndominant figure in the political and ecclesiastical affairs of the realm.\r\nThe Queen raised him to the primatial see of Toledo, which carried with it\r\nhis elevation to the Roman purple.  The Cardinal-Archbishop of Toledo was\r\nthe richest and most important person in Spain, after the sovereign; but\r\npromotion to this lofty dignity, with its obligations to the pomp and\r\nmagnificence imposed by the usage of the times, in no way modified the\r\nausterity of Cardinal Ximenez’s life.  He still wore the rough habit of\r\nSt. Francis under his purple and he patched its rents with his own hands.\r\nAmidst palatial surroundings he slept on the floor or on a wooden\r\nbench—never in a bed—and he held strictly to the diet of a simple monk.\r\nNo man was less of the world than he, though none was more in it or knew\r\nit better.  He became as renowned for his wisdom and ability in conducting\r\naffairs as he had long since been for his sanctity, and the confidence\r\nwhich the King and Queen reposed in him caused him to be admitted to their\r\ncounsels on all the most important matters of government.\r\n\r\n               [Illustration: Cardinal Ximenez de Cisneros]\r\n\r\n                       Cardinal Ximenez de Cisneros\r\n\r\nFrom a relief preserved in the Universidad Central.

Laurent &\r\n                               Co., Madrid\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the death of King Ferdinand occurred, the Cardinal was nearly eighty\r\nyears of age, yet he accepted and assumed the regency imposed upon him by\r\nthe King’s testament.  Adrian of Utrecht, Dean of the University of\r\nLouvain, who had resided for some months at the court of King Ferdinand in\r\nthe quality of ambassador from Prince Charles, produced full powers from\r\nthe young sovereign, which conferred upon him the regency after\r\nFerdinand’s death.  Cardinal Ximenez acknowledged him without delay, and a\r\njoint regency was instituted in which Adrian’s part was merely nominal, as\r\nthe actual government was carried on exclusively by the Cardinal.\r\n\r\nIt could hardly have been otherwise, for Adrian, as a foreigner, was\r\nunpopular in Spain, where he exercised no influence; he did not even speak\r\nSpanish and being, moreover, of a scholarly disposition, little used to\r\nthe intricacies of affairs of state, he was doubtless glad enough to\r\nshelter himself behind the powerful figure of his masterful colleague.\r\nThe Cardinal was adored by the people; the sanctity of his life, the\r\nintegrity of his character, the superlative order of his genius, and his\r\nprincely munificence made him more powerful than any sovereign.  Some of\r\nthe great nobles who had imagined that the regency of an aged monk would\r\nfavour the designs of their invasive ambitions were sharply checked by the\r\nenergy of the new regent, who had organised an efficient body of troops in\r\nhis own pay and speedily made it apparent that Spain had a ruler with whom\r\nit was perilous to trifle.  One incident in the contest he sustained in\r\ndefence of the crown’s prerogatives against the encroachments of the\r\nfeudal nobles, illustrates his character.  The Duke of Infantado, the\r\nGrand Admiral of Castile, and the Count of Benevente came as\r\nrepresentatives of the nobles, to inquire into the nature of the powers by\r\nwhich the regent exercised such absolute authority.  After hearing them\r\ncourteously, the Cardinal produced the late King’s testament and its\r\nformal ratification by the absent King Charles.  As they raised some\r\nobjections to the extent of the powers these documents gave him, he led\r\nthem to a window of his apartment commanding a view of a large encampment\r\nof soldiers and artillery, saying, “There are the powers I have received\r\nfrom his Catholic Majesty, by which I govern and shall continue to govern\r\nCastile, until the King, my master and yours, shall take possession of his\r\nkingdom.” This answer both astonished and silenced them and they withdrew\r\nconvinced of the futility of conspiracies against a man so well prepared\r\nand so determined.\r\n\r\nThe supreme object of his regency was to consolidate the union of the\r\nvarious kingdoms and principalities of the peninsula into one state—in\r\nother words to create a nation.  This he did, and thus laid the\r\nfoundations of Spain’s greatest power and glory, for he delivered the\r\nkingdom to the young monarch in a more prosperous condition than it had\r\never before enjoyed, and with the royal authority more widely extended and\r\nmore firmly grounded than any other Spanish sovereign had ever possessed\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe regency of Cardinal Ximenez did not last two years, yet such was the\r\npermanent character of his beneficent influence upon the national\r\ndevelopment, that the memory of his services is still undimmed in Spain.\r\nAmongst the statesmen of his times, he was facile princeps and he enjoys\r\nthe unique distinction of being the only prime-minister in history who was\r\nregarded as a saint by his own contemporaries. (28)\r\n\r\nTo this ascetic and autocratic but not unkindly statesman Las Casas\r\ndecided to address himself, and he proceeded to Madrid to acquaint the two\r\nregents with the abuses prevailing in the Indies and to announce his\r\nintention of going to Flanders unless the necessary measures for the\r\nrelief of the oppressed Indians could be devised in Spain before the King\r\narrived.  He drew up a statement of the case in Latin, which he submitted\r\nto the Ambassador Adrian, and another, identical, in Spanish, for Cardinal\r\nXimenez.  The gentle-hearted Fleming was horrified by what he read of the\r\natrocities perpetrated in the King’s name in the colonies, and repairing\r\nto the apartment of Cardinal Ximenez, who lodged in the same palace, asked\r\nhim if such enormities were possible.  As the Cardinal already had plenty\r\nof information on the subject from his brother Franciscans, he replied\r\nthat all that Las Casas stated was true and that there was even more\r\nbesides.  He signified to Las Casas that his proposed journey to Flanders\r\nwas unnecessary as he would himself provide means in Madrid for correcting\r\nthe abuses in the colonies.  There began at once a series of conferences\r\nto which Cardinal Ximenez summoned his colleague in the regency, the\r\nlicentiate Zapata, Dr. Carbajal, and the distinguished jurist Dr. Palacios\r\nRubios; in the course of these debates Las Casas fully exposed the evils\r\nof the colonial administration and proposed the measures which, in his\r\njudgment, were necessary to remedy them.  The Cardinal-regent always had\r\nby him as a consultor the Bishop of Avila, who was also of his Order, but\r\nhe rigorously excluded the obnoxious Bishop of Burgos from all\r\nparticipation in Indian affairs, to the no small perturbation of that\r\nprelate.  Las Casas relates a significant incident that happened during\r\none of these conferences, illustrating the means employed by his opponents\r\nto confute his statements.  Cardinal Ximenez ordered the Laws of Burgos,\r\nwhich, since 1512, were supposed to be in full force in the Indies for the\r\nprotection of the natives, to be read aloud; upon reaching one of the\r\narticles, the reader falsified the text; Las Casas, who knew every line of\r\nthose acts by heart, objected and the Cardinal ordered the reader to\r\nrepeat; he did so in the same language, whereupon Las Casas once more\r\nobjected, saying, “The law does not say that.” The Cardinal, rendered\r\nimpatient by the repeated interruption, turned to Las Casas and remarked\r\nwith severity, “Either be silent or look well to what you say.” “Your\r\nEminence may take my head off if what this clerk is reading be truly found\r\nin that law,” replied Las Casas promptly.  Taking the articles from the\r\nhands of the reader he showed his Eminence that the sense had not been\r\ncorrectly read.  The confusion of the clerk, whom Las Casas refuses to\r\ndishonour by naming him in his history, was complete.  The outcome of\r\nthese discussions was that Las Casas, Dr. Palacios Rubios, and Fray\r\nAntonio de Montesinos (who had meanwhile arrived in Madrid) were deputed\r\nby the Cardinal-regent to draft a project of laws which would sufficiently\r\nprotect the Indians and secure fair government in the colonies.  By common\r\nconsent of his collaborators, the task of framing these laws was left\r\nexclusively to Las Casas.  His propositions were:\r\n\r\n 1.1. Unconditional liberty for the Indians;\r\n 2.2. Suppression of both repartimientos and encomiendas;\r\n 3.3. Some provisions for assisting the Spaniards to work their properties\r\n      profitably without recurring to the oppressive and abusive systems\r\n      they had hitherto employed.\r\n\r\nBoth Fray Antonio and Dr. Palacios Rubios approved these articles and the\r\nlatter somewhat added to and improved them, recomposing them in the proper\r\nlegal terminology of the time, after which they were again submitted,\r\ndiscussed, and in some unimportant details, amended, in the\r\nabove-mentioned council presided over by the Cardinal, The next important\r\nstep was to place the execution of these new provisions in the hands of\r\ntrusted delegates who would apply them rigorously and in the sense\r\ndesigned by the council, for there had been no lack of excellent decrees,\r\nhaving the same end in view, but which had, in the past, been rendered\r\nnull and of no effect, through the connivance of the colonial authorities,\r\nto whom their execution had been entrusted.  Las Casas, for the best of\r\nmotives, declined having any part in designating such officers and in\r\nconsideration of certain rivalries existing between the Franciscan and\r\nDominican Orders, especially in Indian affairs, the Cardinal finally\r\ndecided to confide the necessary powers to the monks of St. Jerome, an\r\nOrder which had thus far taken no part in colonial affairs.  Upon\r\nreceiving the Cardinal’s notification of this intention, the General of\r\nthat Order, who resided at San Bartolomé de Lupiano, summoned a chapter of\r\nall the priors of Castile, in which twelve monks were designated, amongst\r\nwhom the regent might make his selection.  Four priors came to Madrid to\r\nnotify this result to his Eminence, and one afternoon the two regents,\r\naccompanied by the entire court, rode out to the monastery of St. Jerome\r\nnear the Buen Retiro Gardens, where they lodged, to receive the formal\r\nanswer of the chapter.  Las Casas was, of course, present, and the regents\r\nwere received by the monks in the sacristy of the church, which had been\r\nappropriately prepared for the great occasion.  Cardinal Ximenez addressed\r\nthe assembly, highly commending the willingness of the Jeronymites to\r\nundertake such a meritorious task, and then ordered that Las Casas be\r\nsummoned to hear the result.\r\n\r\nThe boyish enthusiasm of Las Casas’s character appears on this occasion,\r\nfor, consumed with impatience, tortured by hopes and fears, he had waited\r\noutside in the upper cloister as long as he could stand it and had then\r\nfinally descended a staircase which brought him unexpectedly to the\r\nsacristy door, just in time to hear that he was being searched for; some\r\none asked him if he knew Las Casas, to which he meekly replied, “I am he.”\r\nAs he could not get in at that door, he had to go round through the\r\nchurch, which obliged him to traverse the choir, where all the great\r\npeople of the court in attendance on the regents were waiting and who, so\r\nLas Casas observes, were all glad to see him, except perhaps the Bishop of\r\nBurgos.  This hour of Las Casas’s triumph was complete; on his knees\r\nbefore the Cardinal-regent, in the presence of the assembled Priors of\r\nCastile and the entire court, he heard, with ill-repressed tears, the\r\nannouncement that all he had most earnestly striven and prayed for was now\r\nto be realised and that he himself was designated to confer with the\r\nGeneral of the Jeronymites concerning the choice of the men who were to\r\nexecute the new laws in the Indies.  The Cardinal, who unbent to few,\r\ntreated Las Casas with genial familiarity and when the latter declared\r\nthat he did not need the money his Eminence had provided for his expenses,\r\nas he had enough of his own, he smilingly observed, “Go to, father, I am\r\nricher than you.”\r\n\r\nNot a moment of time was wasted, and that very evening Las Casas received\r\nhis instructions and twenty ducats for the expenses of his journey to\r\nLupiano, whither he set out the following morning.  One of the twelve\r\nmonks amongst whom the selection was to be made was in that monastery, and\r\nthe General had him called and presented him to Las Casas, who was as\r\npleased with his robust appearance, which promised to support the physical\r\nhardships of colonial life, as he was with all that he heard of his\r\nvirtues and learning, though his face was as ugly a one as ever a man had;\r\nthis was Fray Bernardino de Mazanedo, the Prior of Mejorada, and he was\r\nselected as one of the commission; Luis de Figueroa and the Prior of St.\r\nJeromino in Seville were finally agreed upon between Las Casas and the\r\nGeneral to complete the number.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the Jeronymite monks arrived in Madrid than the agents of\r\nthe colonists, and all those who were interested in maintaining the\r\nencomiendas and repartimientos, whose suppression meant the diminution of\r\ntheir incomes, laid instant siege to them.  Las Casas was abused and even\r\nthreatened in the public streets, and a well organised campaign of calumny\r\nand misrepresentation was set actively in motion.  The Indians were\r\nrepresented as lazy, filthy pagans, of bestial morals, no better than\r\ndogs, and fit only for slavery, in which state alone there might be some\r\nhope of instructing and converting them to Christianity.  Las Casas was\r\nflouted as a fanatic, bent on destroying the Spanish colonies, and as an\r\nenemy of his country’s interests.  So adroitly were these and other\r\narguments presented, and so overwhelming was the mass of testimony\r\nfavourable to the colonists that constantly reached the Jeronymites from\r\nall sides, that they began to be ill-affected towards Las Casas and to\r\ndisregard his suggestions.  Dr. Palacios Rubios was so disturbed by their\r\nnew inclination, that after conversations with them, in which their\r\nchanged views were plainly manifested, he declared it would be disastrous\r\nto send such men; he forthwith determined to stop their departure, if\r\npossible, before it was too late.\r\n\r\nCardinal Ximenez fell seriously ill at this time and Palacios Rubios\r\nsought access to him in vain.  As soon as his Eminence had sufficiently\r\nconvalesced to attend to business, he ordered the final instructions to be\r\ngiven to the Jeronymites and their departure to be hastened.  One of the\r\norders directed them, upon arriving in Hispaniola, to at once annul the\r\nencomiendas held by members of the Royal Council for the Indies.  This\r\nstruck a hard blow at Conchillos and the Bishop of Burgos amongst others,\r\nfor the former lost eleven hundred Indians and the latter eight hundred,\r\n(29) nor from that time forth did any member of the Council openly hold\r\nproperty in slaves, though Las Casas was sceptical as to whether they did\r\nnot continue to have private interests.  Another similar order obliged all\r\njudges and royal officials in the colonies to surrender their slaves.  The\r\ngeneral sense of the instructions furnished to the Jeronymites for their\r\nguidance was in conformity with the ideas of Las Casas and the articles\r\nwere indeed drawn up by him, although certain concessions which did not\r\nmeet with his approval had been made to public opinion, and the important\r\nproperty-owners in the colonies were sufficiently powerful at court to\r\nobtain some modifications and to suppress some provisions in favour of the\r\nIndians, which seriously hampered the original proposals.  In spite of the\r\ndeclaration formally set down in the will of Isabella the Catholic that\r\nthe Indians were and must be considered free men, the contrary opinion had\r\ncome to prevail, and in the beginning of his negotiations in Spain Las\r\nCasas himself had not ventured to insist too much or too openly on this\r\npoint, until one day, when in conversation with Cardinal Ximenez, he\r\nqueried by what principle of justice the Indians were held in subjection.\r\nHis Eminence answered with some vivacity: “With no justice, for are they\r\nnot free men? And who can doubt they are free?”  From thenceforward Las\r\nCasas sustained this opinion unflinchingly.(30) The licentiate Zuazo of\r\nSeville was appointed to accompany the Jeronymites and to open an inquiry\r\n(tomar la residencia) into the administration of the colonial officials.\r\nThe powers of the friars were the fullest possible and enabled them to\r\ninquire into all matters touching the welfare of the Indians and to\r\ncorrect abuses, but they were not “governors” as has been supposed and\r\nstated by many writers, but rather overseers, charged to ensure the proper\r\nexecution of the laws which had been enacted to protect the natives.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the instructions were delivered to the Jeronymites, Las Casas\r\nreceived the following order from the Cardinal-regent:\r\n\r\n“The Queen and the King.  Bartholomew de Las Casas, priest, native of the\r\ncity of Seville, and resident of the island of Cuba which is in the\r\nIndies.”\r\n\r\n“For as much as we are informed that you have been and are resident in\r\nthose parts for a long time, from which you know and are experienced in\r\ntheir affairs, especially in what touches the well-being and usefulness of\r\nthe Indians, and you know and are acquainted with their life and\r\nconversation from having dwelt with them, and because we know your good\r\nzeal in our Lord’s service, from which we hope that you will execute with\r\nall diligence and care what we shall charge and command you and will see\r\nto what contributes to the welfare of the souls and bodies of the\r\nSpaniards and Indians who live there; by these presents we command you to\r\nrepair to those regions of the said Indies, such as the islands of\r\nHispaniola, Cuba, San Juan, and Jamaica as well as to the mainland; and\r\nyou shall advise, inform, and give your opinion to the pious Jeronymite\r\nfathers whom we despatch to effect the reformation of the Indies, and to\r\nother persons who may assist them in this, concerning everything which\r\ntouches the liberty, good treatment and welfare of the souls and bodies of\r\nthe said Indians in the said islands and mainland; and that you shall\r\nwrite to us giving information concerning everything that may be done or\r\nshould be done in the said islands; and that you shall do everything\r\nrequired for our Lord’s service; for all of which we give you full power,\r\nwith all its casualties, dependencies, emergencies, annexes, and connexes;\r\nand we command our Admiral and appellate judges and all other justices\r\nwhatsoever of the said Islands and Tierrafirma that they protect you and\r\ncause this power to be protected and that they shall not oppose or go\r\ncontrary to its form and tenor nor consent that such be done at any time\r\nor in any way under pain of our displeasure and of 10,000 maravedis for\r\neach person who may act to the contrary.”\r\n\r\n“Done at Madrid the 17th day of September in the year 1516 F. Cardinalis,\r\nAdrianus Ambasiator—By command of the Queen and the King her son, our\r\nsovereigns, the governors in their name.  George de Baracaldo.”\r\n\r\nIn addition to this full power, Las Casas was given the title of\r\nProtector-General (or Procurator-General) of all the Indians, to which\r\noffice an annual salary of one hundred dollars was attached, an amount\r\nwhich, for the times, was a considerable one.\r\n\r\nThough everything now seemed ready for the departure of the Jeronymites\r\nand Las Casas, the members of the Council still advanced objections to the\r\ninstructions which Palacios Rubios had drawn up for the licentiate Zuazo,\r\nwho had been deputed to take the residencia of the colonial judges; it was\r\nfeared that some severe decisions might be given on acts which these\r\nlatter had performed in the interests of the members of the India Council,\r\nwhose tools they were.  Las Casas employed his usual direct tactics to\r\novercome these delays and brought the matter to the Cardinal’s notice.\r\nHis Eminence summoned the licentiate Zapata and Dr. Carbajal into his\r\npresence and ordered them to sign Zuazo’s papers; they obeyed, but\r\ncontrived to affix a mark in cipher to their signatures which would enable\r\nthem later to complain to the King that the regent had forced them to\r\nsign.\r\n\r\nIn taking leave of the Cardinal, Las Casas frankly declared that he feared\r\nthe Jeronymites had been so tampered with and influenced before starting\r\non their mission, that more evil than good was to be apprehended from\r\ntheir action.  The Cardinal, nonplussed for an instant by these\r\nforebodings, exclaimed, “Whom then can we trust?” quickly adding, “Go on\r\nand do you look out for everything.”\r\n\r\nThis unpromising joint-commission sailed from San Lucar on November 11,\r\n1516, but in separate vessels, the Jeronymites keeping aloof from Las\r\nCasas, who they contrived should not embark on the same ship with\r\nthemselves.  Their vessel reached Hispaniola thirteen days earlier than\r\nthe other, which had been obliged to stop at Puerto Rico to discharge\r\nfreight.\r\n\r\nBy detaching themselves from Las Casas at the very outset, the three\r\nJeronymites doubtless intended to affirm the impartial and independent\r\nattitude essential to the judicial character of their mission.  They were\r\nnot carried to the Indies on any such wave of righteous zeal and\r\nindignation as bore the impetuous reformer on its crest.  They were\r\ncloister-bred men, cautious and prudent in their decisions and deliberate\r\nin their acts, and they doubtless felt that for them to arrive in company\r\nwith Las Casas would be to prejudice the impartiality of their proceedings\r\nin the eyes of all the colonists.  They were sent to the colonies to carry\r\nout instructions of a most delicate and difficult nature and it was their\r\nobvious preference to fulfil their mission, as far as possible, without\r\nfriction.  In this exercise of caution, Las Casas beheld weakness and even\r\ntreachery.  His passionate nature chafed and raged at the deliberateness\r\nwith which these impassive monks moved, and he was not slow to denounce\r\nthem as having been won over by the blandishments of the colonial\r\nofficials to betray the mission with which they were entrusted.  His\r\npassion for justice, associated as it was with unrealisable ideals,\r\nrefused to take account of the multifarious difficulties in the way of the\r\nreforms on which his heart was set, and he despised the obstacles to their\r\nconsummation, through which he would have crashed, regardless of the\r\nconsequences.  Despite the sincerity of these one-sided views of the great\r\nProtector, it must be conceded that the problems confronting the\r\nJeronymites were complex and difficult of solution.  The prompt and\r\nreckless execution of their instructions would have overturned the entire\r\neconomic system of the colonies which, however unjust in its principles,\r\nwas the established condition of things, and would have certainly brought\r\nfinancial ruin as the first consequence.  The situation was one which\r\ncalled for all their circumspection if the Jeronymites were to make their\r\nauthority effective and their decisions operative.  They were the first of\r\nall the men sent by the Spanish government to effect reforms in the\r\ncolonies, whose intention to discharge their duty was conscientious,\r\nthough Las Casas does not even admit this in their favour, for he declares\r\nthat they had relatives in the islands whom they desired to benefit, and\r\nthat in writing to the Governor of Cuba they even signed themselves as his\r\n“chaplains,” which seemed to him conclusive proof of their too subservient\r\nattitude towards the higher colonial authorities.\r\n\r\nThe Jeronymites, however, had been furnished with two sets of instructions\r\nand it was within their discretion to guide their policy according to\r\neither, as their judgment formed on the spot might dictate.  The first set\r\nof instructions was in conformity with the plan drawn up by Las Casas and\r\nPalacios Rubios; the second was provided in case the result of their\r\ninvestigations showed the full application of the first to be inexpedient,\r\nfor Cardinal Ximenez, though sympathising with the ideas of Las Casas, was\r\nnot led by him, but viewed the situation, as he did every other that\r\nconcerned the welfare of the Spanish realm, from the standpoint of a\r\nstatesman trustee for the absent sovereign.\r\n\r\nThe first measures of the Jeronymites were in the right direction, but\r\nthey were far too timid and temporising to satisfy the expectations of Las\r\nCasas; the conditions he had foreseen were only too prompt in declaring\r\nthemselves, for the Jeronymites showed themselves somewhat insensible to\r\nthe crying abuses which he incessantly pressed upon their attention.  They\r\ndid not give full credit to all of his representations and even ignored\r\nmany of the proofs he adduced.  They had failed to find the picture he had\r\ndrawn in Spain of the Indians an entirely accurate one, and they resisted\r\nhis reiterated demand that they should scrupulously obey the injunction to\r\nat once deprive all royal judges and officials of their encomiendas.  The\r\nexasperation of Las Casas at this time pushed him to excesses which\r\naroused such a storm of ill-feeling and hostility against him that his\r\ngood friends the Dominicans feared for his life and insisted that he\r\nshould come to live with them in their monastery, where he would be safer\r\nfrom any violence his enemies might attempt.  Whether it was feasible to\r\nproceed in the drastic manner demanded by Las Casas is open to doubt.  It\r\nis evident that the colonists would have offered an obstinate resistance,\r\nto combat which the three Jeronymites had nothing but the moral force of\r\ntheir commission.  Even with our present facilities for rapid\r\ncommunication, it is not always easy for the central authority to control\r\nits agents and ensure the faithful execution of its intentions.  In the\r\nsixteenth century, time and distance influenced powerfully the action of\r\nthe government representatives.  Their instructions were made complex,\r\nvoluminous, in the effort to cover every possible emergency, but no\r\nforesight sufficed for the purpose, while the legal system in use opened\r\nmany loopholes for evading or postponing the application of unpopular\r\nmeasures.  An appeal from a royal commissioner’s decision, to the India\r\nCouncil or to the King, entailed a delay of many long months or even\r\nyears, during which each party contested every point.  The outcome of such\r\nproceedings was problematical but the resisting party was always certain\r\nof the one positive advantage of delay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. - LAS CASAS AND CHARLES V.  THE GRAND CHANCELLOR.  NEGRO\r\nSLAVERY.  EVENTS AT COURT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as Zuazo arrived, nearly three months after the Jeronymites, Las\r\nCasas immediately lodged against members of the audiencia, an accusation\r\nof having encouraged and shared in the man-hunts in the Lucayan islands\r\nand the enslavement of the captured natives.  The Jeronymites, whose every\r\nact was now one of opposition to Las Casas, showed much annoyance at this\r\nimpeachment of the royal functionaries.  They solicited divers opinions,\r\naddressing themselves to the accused officials, who naturally exculpated\r\nthemselves, to the Franciscan monks, who were not over-friendly to the\r\nIndians, and to the Dominicans, who were their warm advocates.  Much\r\ndiscussion ensued, and meanwhile the perplexed Jeronymites did nothing, so\r\nthat matters continued as they had been before their arrival, except that\r\nthe sufferings of the Indians were augmented by their owners, who feared\r\nthat the encomienda system was nearing its end and hence worked their\r\nIndians to death, sparing neither women nor children, so as to get all the\r\nprofit they could out of them before they lost them.  Charges and\r\ncounter-charges were sent to Spain, the Jeronymites complaining of Las\r\nCasas and he in turn denouncing them to Cardinal Ximenez, though many of\r\nhis letters were intercepted and never reached their destination.  Things\r\nhad come to such a pass that the only hope of remedy lay in Las Casas\r\nreturning to Spain to file complaints against the very men he had himself\r\ncaused to be sent to the Indies and in whose impartiality and humanity he\r\nhad placed all his hopes.  Both the Dominicans and Franciscans, for once\r\nin accord in this business, addressed letters to the King and the Cardinal\r\nin defence of Las Casas, armed with which he sailed in May, 1517, for\r\nSpain and within fifty days arrived at Aranda de Duero, where he found his\r\nfriend and protector, the Cardinal-regent, stricken with a serious\r\nillness.\r\n\r\nThe arrival in Spain of the young King, Charles I.—better known in history\r\nunder his imperial title of Charles V.,—after repeated postponements was\r\nnow confidently expected.  During his regency, Cardinal Ximenez had been\r\nfrequently embarrassed by the influences surrounding the King in his\r\ndistant Flemish court.  He had written with characteristic frankness\r\nadvising the King not to bring a Flemish household with him into Spain,\r\nand as soon as the date for the royal journey was fixed, the Cardinal set\r\nout to meet his arriving sovereign, travelling as fast as his age and\r\ninfirmities would allow.  He had arrived at Aranda de Duero, where he was\r\nseized with an illness of such a mysterious character that his friends\r\nhinted that he had been poisoned.\r\n\r\nIn the one interview which Las Casas obtained, he perceived that the\r\nmachinations of his enemies had not been entirely in vain, for he found\r\nthe Cardinal’s mind somewhat influenced by the representations which had\r\nreached him from the Jeronymites and the agents of the colonists.\r\n\r\nCharles V. landed at Villaviciosa in Asturias on September 13, 1517.\r\nAmong his first acts was the dispatch of a letter to the Cardinal, in\r\nwhich the latter was dismissed to his diocese with a few perfunctory\r\nexpressions of regard and recognition for his services.  Cardinal Ximenez\r\nbreathed his last a few hours after reading this heartless communication\r\nand Las Casas was left to begin anew his life as a courtier and to\r\ncultivate the good-will of the all-powerful Flemish favourites.  He was\r\nfortunate, at this time, in securing the friendship of a brother of Fray\r\nAntonio de Montesinos, named Reginaldo, who was also a Dominican and\r\nproved a staunch and resourceful ally.\r\n\r\n                        [Illustration: Charles V.]\r\n\r\n                                Charles V.\r\n\r\n From an engraving by Ferdinand Slema, made in 1778 after the portrait by\r\n                                  Titian\r\n\r\n\r\nInfluences and arguments which sound strange enough in twentieth-century\r\nears were powerful, and likely to be employed with dangerous success in\r\nSpain at that time.  One of the members of the Council having asserted to\r\nFray Reginaldo that the Indians were incapable of conversion, the friar\r\nsubmitted this proposition to the Prior of San Estéban in Salamanca, one\r\nof the most learned and influential men in the Dominican order, asking him\r\nto invite a body of theologians to determine whether or no such an\r\naffirmation was in accordance with Catholic doctrine, and to send him a\r\ncopy of the decision.  Thirteen doctors of theology and other\r\necclesiastical authorities replied with four or five signed conclusions,\r\nthe last of which defined that all who held or propagated that error\r\nshould be condemned to the stake as heretics.  This was a weapon in Las\r\nCasas’s hands which circumstances might make formidable; it was no\r\ntrifling thing to be arraigned before the tribunal of the Inquisition on a\r\ncharge of holding heretical doctrines, for neither rank nor calling\r\navailed to protect the offender, and it is somewhat astonishing that no\r\nreference to use of this “opinion” being made by Las Casas in any given\r\ncase is found in the records of his struggle for the liberty of the\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nKing Charles, even in his boyhood, was of a grave and thoughtful\r\ntemperament, reserved and observant in an unusual degree, but however\r\nrichly endowed with gifts which promised him a glorious reign, he\r\nnecessarily left the administration of his government very largely under\r\nthe direction of his advisers, of whom the two most influential were\r\nWilliam de Croy, commonly called Chièvres, or by the Spaniards, Xevres,\r\nwho had formerly been the King’s governor, and Jean Salvage, a learned\r\npriest who was Dean of the University of Louvain.  The latter’s name was\r\ncorrupted by the Spaniards into Juan Selvagio, and he held the office and\r\ntitle of Grand Chancellor, both hitherto unknown in Spain.  These Flemings\r\nwere odious to the Spaniards, who resented their high rank and influence\r\nand looked upon them as rapacious foreigners, who were controlling\r\nnational affairs to the exclusion of those who had better claims, while\r\nthey enriched themselves out of the Spanish treasury: none of them so much\r\nas spoke the national language and even the King’s first task was to\r\nmaster Spanish in order to converse with his own subjects.\r\n\r\nAs the Grand Chancellor had control of the department of justice, it was\r\nto him that Las Casas first got himself presented.  He was well received\r\nand afforded opportunities to state his case, and, as he produced letters\r\ngiven him by some French Franciscans from Picardy, whom he had known in\r\nthe Indies and who were friends of the Chancellor, he soon found himself\r\nupon terms of some friendliness with him.  The Chancellor found great\r\ninterest in listening to all that Las Casas had to tell him, and it is not\r\nto be doubted that the latter’s habitual earnestness when on this subject\r\nwas increased by the evident sympathy of his listener, upon whose support\r\nthe fate of his projects depended.\r\n\r\nThis friendship with the detested Flemings cost Las Casas dear with his\r\nown people, and made him more unpopular than ever.  His opponents were\r\nobliged, however, to cease abusing him in their letters and official\r\npapers, for not only did the Chancellor openly befriend him, but he handed\r\nover to him most of the correspondence pertaining to Indian affairs.  Las\r\nCasas translated the contents into Latin, adding his own observations or\r\nobjections to the different reports or proposals, and then returned them\r\nto the Chancellor, who was delighted to have such expert assistance in\r\ndispatching complicated affairs, in which he was himself unpractised.\r\nFrom the Chancellor’s favour to that of the King was but a step, and the\r\ncharge of reforming Indian legislation, which Las Casas had held from\r\nCardinal Ximenez, was renewed to him.  This welcome news was given him one\r\nday by the Chancellor remarking in Latin, which was their habitual tongue,\r\nRex dominus noster jubet quod vos et ego opponamus remedia Indiis;\r\nfaciatis vestra memorabilia. Las Casas was quick to obey this congenial\r\nbehest. (31)\r\n\r\nIt is indicative of the priority of importance which Las Casas habitually\r\ngave to spiritual over temporal aids, that he first had recourse to the\r\npriors of the religious orders, asking them to have their communities pray\r\nunceasingly and with special earnestness, that his mind might be illumined\r\nby divine grace to perceive what course he must follow.  He next drew up\r\nhis plan, but perhaps in no act of his long career is there less evidence\r\nof the action of divine guidance, for, in framing his project, he\r\ncommitted an error which he himself sincerely and frankly deplored with\r\ntouching humility, and which has served all his detractors ever since as\r\nground on which to bring a grave charge against him.\r\n\r\nIn obedience to the King’s command conveyed to Las Casas through the\r\nChancellor, he drew up a plan in which he proposed that labourers should\r\nbe induced to emigrate to the Indies, by granting that each person,\r\nwhether man or child, should have his expenses paid as far as Seville, the\r\nplace of embarkation, at the rate of half a real per day.  While waiting\r\nin Seville to start, the India House (Casa de Contractacion) was to lodge\r\nand feed them, their passage to Hispaniola was to be given them and their\r\nfood furnished for one year.  Any of the emigrants who, at the expiration\r\nof the first year, found themselves incapacitated on account of the\r\nclimate to support themselves, should be entitled to further assistance in\r\nthe form of a royal loan.  Lands were to be given them gratis and also the\r\nrequisite farming implements for working them, in which their rights as\r\nowners should be permanent and hereditary.  A more liberal scheme of\r\nassisted emigration could hardly be imagined.  Other inducements were held\r\nout to attract emigrants under the new regulations and Las Casas acceded\r\nto the request of certain of the colonists in Santo Domingo to ask the\r\nKing’s consent to the importation of negro slaves to replace the Indians\r\nwho should be freed.\r\n\r\nThis recommendation cost Las Casas dearly enough and later exposed his\r\nreputation to unjustifiable attacks, some of which even represented him as\r\nhaving _introduced_ negro slavery into America; others as having been\r\nbetrayed by blind zeal in favour of the Indians into promoting the\r\nslave-trade at the expense of the Africans.  No one more sincerely\r\ndeplored his course in this matter than he himself when he realised the\r\nsignificance of what he had done, and the sincerity and humility of his\r\ncompunction should have sufficed to disarm his detractors.  The most\r\nformal accusation made by a reputable historian against Las Casas is found\r\nin Robertson’s _History of America_, vol. iii., Year 1517, in which he\r\ncharges the apostle of the Indians with having proposed to Cardinal\r\nXimenez to purchase a sufficient number of negroes from the Portuguese\r\nsettlements on the coast of Africa and to transport them to America in\r\norder that they might be employed as slaves in working in the mines and\r\ntilling the ground.  Cardinal Ximenez however, when solicited to encourage\r\nthe commerce, peremptorily rejected the proposition because he perceived\r\nthe iniquity of reducing one race of men to slavery when he was consulting\r\nabout the means of restoring liberty to another.  But Las Casas, from the\r\ninconsistency natural to men who hurry with headlong impetuosity towards a\r\nfavourite point, was incapable of making the distinction.  While he\r\ncontended earnestly for the liberty of the people born in one quarter of\r\nthe globe, he laboured to enslave the inhabitants of another region and in\r\nthe warmth of his zeal to save the Americans from the yoke, pronounced it\r\nto be lawful and expedient to impose one still heavier on the African.\r\n\r\nLanguage could hardly more completely travesty the facts, for Las Casas\r\nneither “laboured to enslave the inhabitants of another region” nor did he\r\n“pronounce it lawful” to increase slavery amongst the Africans.  The moral\r\naspect of the question of slavery was not under consideration and the\r\nrecommendation of Las Casas is seen upon examination to reduce itself to\r\nthis: he advised that Spanish colonists in America should be allowed the\r\nprivilege, common in Spain and Portugal, of employing negro slave labour\r\non their properties.  Since Spaniards might hold African slaves in Spain,\r\nit implied no approval of slavery as an institution, to permit them to do\r\nthe same in the colonies.  Las Casas was engaged in defending a hitherto\r\nfree people from the curse of a peculiarly cruel form of slavery, but had\r\nhe regarded the institution as justifiable in itself, he would have\r\nmodified the ardour of his opposition to its extension.\r\n\r\nThe truth plainly appears in the chronicles of the times and establishes\r\nbeyond cavil exactly what Las Casas did, and under what circumstances and\r\nfor what purposes he made the recommendation which he never afterwards\r\nceased to deplore.  Retributive justice has followed these attempts of\r\nseveral lesser contemporaries of Robertson to asperse the character of one\r\nof the purest, noblest, and most humane of men, and while discredit has\r\novertaken the inventors and publishers of these falsehoods, the\r\ninvestigations of impartial historians, provoked by their enormity, have\r\nresulted in banishing such fables from historical controversy.\r\n\r\nThe original basis of the charge that Las Casas favoured the introduction\r\nof negro slavery into America is a passage in Herrera’s _Historia de las\r\nIndias Occidentals_, written in 1598, thirty-two years after the death of\r\nLas Casas, and which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n“As the licentiate Las Casas encountered much opposition to the plan he\r\nhad formed for helping the Indians and seeing that the opinions he had\r\npublished had produced no result, in spite of the extraordinary credit he\r\nenjoyed with the Flemish chancellor, Juan Selvagio, he had recourse to\r\nother means to attain the same ends.  He asked in 1517 that the\r\nimportation of Africans be permitted to the Spaniards settled in the\r\nIndies, in order to diminish the labour and sufferings of the Indians in\r\nthe mines and on the plantations, and that a good number of labourers be\r\nenrolled in Spain who would emigrate to the Indies upon the conditions and\r\nwith the advantages which he proposed.  This new proposition was approved\r\nby the Cardinal of Tortosa, Adrian, by the Grand Chancellor, and the\r\nFlemish ministers.  The Chamber of Commerce at Seville was consulted to\r\nlearn what number of Africans, Cuba, Santo Domingo, San Juan [Puerto\r\nRico], and Jamaica would require.  It was replied that it would be\r\nsufficient to send four thousand.  This answer being almost immediately\r\nmade known by some intriguer to the Flemish governor of Bressa, this\r\ncourtier obtained the monopoly of the trade from the sovereign and sold it\r\nto some Genoese for twenty-five thousand ducats on condition that during\r\neight years no other license should be granted by the King.  This\r\narrangement was extremely harmful to the Population of the islands,\r\nespecially to the Indians for whose benefit it had been granted; in fact\r\nhad the trade been free, all the Spaniards might have engaged in it, but\r\nas the Genoese sold their right at a very high price few Spaniards were\r\nable to pay, and the importation of blacks was almost nil.  The King was\r\ncounselled to pay back the twenty-five thousand ducats from his treasury\r\nto the governor and recover his rights, which would pay him well and be of\r\ngreat advantage to his subjects.  Unfortunately the King had little money\r\nthen and, as he was left in ignorance of much concerning the affairs of\r\nthe Indies, nothing of what was most important was done.”\r\n\r\nThere is not a word in this passage which even refers to the\r\n_introduction_ of negro slavery and Herrera in another passage (tom. i.,\r\ndec. i., lib. iv., cap. xii.) states that a royal ordinance given on\r\nSeptember 3, 1500, to Don Nicholas de Ovando, the Governor of Hispaniola,\r\npermitted the importation of negro slaves.  This was two years before Las\r\nCasas made his first voyage as a young man of twenty-eight to America, and\r\nin 1503, the same Ovando asked that no more negro slaves be sent to\r\nHispaniola because they escaped and lived amongst the natives whom they\r\ncorrupted. (32) The number of negroes continued, nevertheless, to increase\r\nand repeated mention of their presence in the colonies is found in\r\ndifferent passages throughout the history of Herrera and in other early\r\nwriters.\r\n\r\nSince the first half of the fifteenth century (about 1440) (33) the\r\nPortuguese had been engaged in bringing negroes from the west coast of\r\nAfrica and selling them in Lisbon and Seville, so that during half a\r\ncentury before Las Casas appeared on the scene where he was destined to\r\nplay so distinguished a part, Andalusia and the southern provinces of\r\nSpain were well provided with slaves and a flourishing trade was carried\r\non.  The condition of such slaves was not a particularly hard one and the\r\nchildren born in Spain of slave parents were Christians.  Since this\r\nsystem was recognised by the laws of the kingdom, and indeed by those of\r\nall Christendom at that time, no additional injury would be done to the\r\nnegroes by permitting Spaniards who might own them in Spain, to take them\r\nalso to the colonies.  Las Casas was a man of such humane temperament that\r\noppression and injustice everywhere of whatever kind revolted him, but it\r\ncan hardly be required, even of him, to be several centuries in advance of\r\nhis times in denouncing a commonly accepted usage which presented, as far\r\nas we know, few crying abuses.  Toleration of an established order, even\r\nthough an essentially evil one, is a very different thing from the\r\nextension of its worst features in regions where it is unknown and amongst\r\npeople ill-fitted to support its burdens.  A small group of men, chiefly\r\nDominican monks, with Las Casas at their head, courageously championed the\r\ncause of freedom and humanity in a century and amongst a people hardened\r\nto oppression and cruelty; they braved popular fury, suffered calumny,\r\ndetraction, and abuse; they faced kings, high ecclesiastics, and all the\r\nrich and great ones of their day, incessantly and courageously\r\nreprimanding their injustice and demanding reform.  Since the memorable\r\nday when Fray Antonio de Montesinos proclaimed himself “vox clamantis in\r\ndeserto” before the astonished and incensed colonists of Hispaniola, the\r\nchorus of rebuke had swelled until it made itself heard, sparing none\r\namongst the offenders against equity and humanity.  The development of the\r\ncollective moral sense of a people is only slowly progressive, and the\r\nbetterment of racial conditions is more safely accomplished by evolution\r\nthan revolution, hence if the moral vision of Las Casas did not detect the\r\ninjustice practised on the negroes, simultaneously with his keen\r\nperception of that which was being perpetrated on the Indians, his failure\r\ncannot be justly attributed either to indifference to the lot of one race\r\nof people or to wilful inconsistency in seeking to benefit another at its\r\nexpense.  That his action was not understood in any such sense at the\r\ntime, is conclusively proven by the fact that inconsistency was never\r\nalleged against him, nor employed as a polemical weapon in the heated\r\ncontroversies in which he was engaged during all his life with the keenest\r\nand most determined opponents to his views.  Far afield indeed did his\r\nenemies wander, seeking for weapons both of attack and defence, and\r\nnothing that could be twisted into an offence against the public\r\nconscience or national interests escaped the keen eyes of the searchers.\r\nHe was himself the first to perceive the error and contradiction into\r\nwhich he had inadvertently fallen, and forty years before Herrera’s work\r\nwas published, he had expressed his contrition for his failure to\r\nappreciate the conditions of African slavery, in the following passage,\r\nwhich occurs in the fourth volume (page 380) of his _Historia General_:\r\n\r\n“The cleric Las Casas first gave this opinion that license should be\r\ngranted to bring negro slaves to these countries [the Indies] without\r\nrealising with what injustice the Portuguese captured and enslaved them,\r\nand afterwards, not for everything in the world would he have offered it,\r\nfor he always held that they were made slaves by injustice and tyranny,\r\nthe same reasoning applying to them as to the Indians.”\r\n\r\nFuller and more mature consideration of the entire question of slavery in\r\nall its aspects, of the right of one man or of nations to hold property in\r\nthe flesh and blood of their fellow-men, conducted Las Casas directly to\r\nthe necessary and generous conviction that the whole system must be\r\neverywhere condemned; for again in Chapter 128 he says of this advice\r\nwhich the cleric gave,\r\n\r\n“that he very shortly after repented, judging himself guilty of\r\ninadvertence; and as he saw—which will be later perceived—that the\r\ncaptivity of the negroes was quite as unjust as that of the Indians, the\r\nremedy he had counselled, that negroes should be brought so that the\r\nIndians might be freed, was no better, even though he believed they had\r\nbeen rightfully procured; although he was not positive that his ignorance\r\nin this matter and his good intention would exculpate him before the\r\ndivine justice.”\r\n\r\nAs has been noted, the transfer of his monopoly by the Governor of Bressa\r\nto Genoese merchants, instead of increasing the exportation of negroes to\r\nAmerica, resulted in almost stopping the nefarious trade, hence no\r\nconsiderable amount of mischief is traceable to the adoption of Las\r\nCasas’s suggestion, which was only one of many enumerated in his scheme.\r\nHad the project as he framed it been accepted in its entirety and loyally\r\ncarried out, no increased injustice would have been done to the negroes,\r\nfor it was the frightful mortality amongst the cruelly driven Indians that\r\nrapidly reduced the numbers of labourers and made gaps which could only be\r\nfilled by the importation of others from elsewhere.  Under a more humane\r\nsystem, the Indians might still have laboured, but not in excess of their\r\npowers; their lives would not have been sacrificed or rendered\r\nunendurable, while the colonists would have become rich less rapidly;\r\nthere would have been no shortage of workmen and little need for the\r\nimportation of Africans at a high price, even though one negro did the\r\nwork of four Indians, according to the popular estimate.  While many\r\nadmirable suggestions of Las Casas were rejected, this blamable one\r\nconcerning the permission to import negroes was accepted, and thus by a\r\nsingular irony of fate, this good man, whose whole life was a\r\nself-sacrificing apostolate in favour of freedom, actually came to be\r\naspersed as a promoter of slavery.\r\n\r\nThe controversy on this passage in the life of Las Casas has been touched\r\nupon here because it furnished at one time material for much discussion,\r\n(34) but the light of historical research has long since dispersed the\r\nartificial clouds which misrepresentation caused to gather about the fame\r\nof the Protector of the Indians, and there now neither is, nor can be, any\r\ndoubt concerning the sentiments and intentions of one whose noble figure\r\nis too clearly defined on the horizon of history ever again to be blurred\r\nor obscured.\r\n\r\nAnother part of the plan for colonisation on the moral basis of benefiting\r\nthe Indians as well as the Spaniards, was the foundation of fortified\r\nplaces at intervals along the coast of the territory to be granted.  In\r\neach of these settlements, some thirty men should be stationed with a\r\nprovision of various articles, such as the Indians prized, for trading\r\npurposes; also several missionary priests, whose occupation would be\r\nteaching and converting the Indians.  It was maintained that by kind\r\ntreatment the Indians could be attracted to the Spaniards and thus, little\r\nby little, become civilised, profitable, and voluntary subjects of the\r\nKing.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the prosperous development of these benevolent projects,\r\nthe mischievous Bishop of Burgos and his brother, who, since the latter\r\npart of Cardinal Ximenez’s regency, had been excluded from active\r\nparticipation in Indian affairs, began once more to exercise an influence,\r\npartly, perhaps because long experience had equipped them with a practical\r\nknowledge of details which the Grand Chancellor found useful, and partly,\r\nso Las Casas hints, because they had succeeded, by spending important sums\r\nof money, in recovering their former offices. At first the Bishop’s\r\nopposition was mild enough, and he contented himself with pointing out\r\nthat he had never been able to induce emigrants to go to the Indies and\r\nthat Las Casas’s scheme was unworkable.  Las Casas, however, affirmed that\r\nhe could easily find three thousand workmen as soon as he was authorised\r\nto assure them of the King’s conditions, and that the Bishop had not\r\nsucceeded in finding men because he had treated the islands as a penal\r\ncolony, whereas now, on the contrary, the severest punishment, after the\r\ndeath penalty, with which a colonist in the Indies could be threatened,\r\nwas that of being shipped back to Spain.\r\n\r\nThe King had left Valladolid(35) on his way to take formal possession of\r\nthe kingdom of Aragon and these negotiations were being carried on at\r\nAranda de Duero, where a halt had been made. Las Casas fell ill and the\r\ncourt moved on without him, but it is indicative of the favour he had\r\nalready acquired with the King that frequently the monarch exclaimed: “Oh,\r\nI wonder how Micer Bartolomé is getting on!”  Micer was the title the\r\nFlemings gave to ecclesiastics, and Charles V., who was the reverse of\r\ndemonstrative, commonly used this familiar appellation in speaking of Las\r\nCasas. Before the court reached Zaragoza, the invalid was on his legs\r\nagain and had rejoined the others, being received with great joy by the\r\nGrand Chancellor, (36) who was almost as enthusiastic as Las Casas himself\r\nin pushing forward the Indian reforms. Delay, however, was again caused at\r\nZaragoza, where the King and court were established, by the illness of the\r\never-contrary Bishop of Burgos; while waiting there to resume business, a\r\nletter was sent to Las Casas from Seville by his friend Fray Reginaldo,\r\ncontaining a full account of the ruthless cruelties of one of the captains\r\nof Pedro Arias, named Espinosa, which cost the lives of forty thousand\r\nIndians. This ghastly chronicle, which was supplied by a Franciscan, Fray\r\nFrancisco Roman, who wrote as an eye-witness of the atrocities, was\r\nimmediately laid before the Chancellor by Las Casas; the former was much\r\nimpressed by the report and directed Las Casas to go to the Bishop on his\r\nbehalf and read him the letter.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop took the news coolly enough and merely observed that he had\r\nlong since advised the recall of Pedro Arias.(37)\r\n\r\nWith the recovery of the Bishop, everything seemed ready for the\r\nresumption of business, when fate dealt Las Casas one of the hardest blows\r\nhe had had to sustain. The Grand Chancellor, who owned to feeling\r\nindisposed on a Friday, became worse on Saturday, so that he had to keep\r\nhis room; his illness persisted on Sunday with signs of fever and, as Las\r\nCasas tersely puts it, “they buried him on Wednesday.”\r\n\r\nWith the death of the Fleming died all hope of any immediate action in\r\nbehalf of the Indians; in the absence of any other as familiar with the\r\nbusiness of the Indian department as himself, the Bishop of Burgos found\r\nhimself once more omnipotent, or as Las Casas puts it, “he seemed to rise\r\nto the heavens while the cleric [himself] sank to the depths.” The\r\nChancellor’s successor, named by the King pro tempore, was the Dean of\r\nBisancio, a heavy, phlegmatic man who slept peacefully all through the\r\nsessions of the Council and only had sufficient perception to commend Las\r\nCasas for the zeal with which he pestered him day and night, remarking on\r\none occasion with a dull smile: Commendamus in Domino, domine Bartholomeo,\r\nvestram diligentiam.  Two such ill-assorted characters as this bovine dean\r\nand the fiery Las Casas only succeeded in tormenting one another to no\r\npurpose, though, as the latter observes, in this case “it did not kill the\r\nDean for all that.”\r\n\r\nThe India Council, over which the Bishop of Burgos presided, was composed\r\nat that time of Hernando de la Vega, Grand Commander of Castile, Don\r\nGarcia de Padilla, the licentiate Zapata, Pedro Martyr de Angleria, and\r\nFrancisco de los Cobos who was then just rising into prominence. Las Casas\r\nwas excluded, and though he was as busy as ever in laying petitions and\r\nmemorials before the Council, he had no friends or protectors inside and\r\nconsequently obtained nothing, save what they were obliged for very\r\nshame’s sake to concede him. Discouragement was too alien to his sanguine\r\ntemperament, else he might, with some show of reason, have abandoned all\r\nhope of struggling successfully against such odds. The first decisive\r\nmeasure of the Bishop was to recall the Jeronymite fathers from their\r\nmission in the Indies, of which he had from the outset been the determined\r\nopponent. It has often been justly observed that the vicissitudes of\r\npolitics make strange bed-fellows, and it was certainly a singular\r\nregrouping of the persons in this historical situation, to find the\r\nJeronymites now reduced to seeking out Las Casas to whom to pour out their\r\nwoes against the mutual enemy, the Bishop of Burgos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. - MONSIEUR DE LAXAO.  COLONISATION PROJECTS.  RECRUITING\r\nEMIGRANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile matters were at the low ebb described in the preceding chapter, the\r\nappearance of a new and unexpected character on the scene brought Las\r\nCasas some welcome assistance. Although his chief support had been his\r\ngood friend, the deceased Chancellor, the other Flemings in the royal\r\nhousehold were, on that account first of all, interested in him and the\r\ncause he so ardently pleaded. Amongst these unpopular foreigners was\r\nMonsieur de la Mure, who, being attracted to Las Casas by what he heard of\r\nhim, expressed a desire to several of his friends to make the clerigo’s\r\nacquaintance. This wish was soon gratified, and the young courtier’s\r\ninterest in all that concerned the Indians and the proposed measures for\r\nthe reform of the colonies was quickly satisfied by Las Casas, who\r\nfurnished him with a full history of the business he had in hand. The\r\nleast impressionable of men could not listen to such an advocate unmoved,\r\nand M. de la Mure, profoundly affected by what he heard, offered to help\r\nhis new friend by every means he could command. He was an ally worth\r\nhaving, for, being a nephew of Monsieur de Laxao, sommeiller du corps to\r\nthe King, he was able to introduce Las Casas to his powerful uncle, who\r\nstood in closer relation to the monarch than any other officer of the\r\ncourt, for he slept in the royal bedchamber.\r\n\r\nMonsieur de Laxao was as quickly won over to the good cause as his nephew\r\nhad been, so Las Casas, finding himself once more with powerful\r\nsupporters, renewed his efforts to press his business to a conclusion.\r\nSome wholesome activity was displayed in dispatching various officials to\r\ntake the residencia, of the several governors of the islands, Rodrigo de\r\nFigueroa being sent to Hispaniola, Doctor de la Gama to Puerto Rico and\r\nCuba, and Lope de Sosa to Darien, where he was also to succeed the actual\r\nGovernor, Pedro Arias de Avila. The Council, acting upon reports which\r\ndescribed the natives of Trinidad as cannibals, ordered that war should be\r\nmade upon them, but Las Casas denied this charge, and contrived that\r\nFigueroa should be authorised to first investigate and report on this\r\nmatter before hostilities began; Figueroa’s report was entirely favourable\r\nto the natives, amongst whom he found no cannibalism.\r\n\r\nAs the Dominicans in Hispaniola were ignorant of the progress of events at\r\ncourt and the loss sustained by Las Casas through the death of the\r\nChancellor, they still conceived him to enjoy great influence.   The\r\nPrior, Pedro de Cordoba, wrote him a detailed description of some recent\r\natrocities perpetrated by the Spaniards in Trinidad where they had gone to\r\nfish for pearls; manifesting also dissatisfaction with the conduct of the\r\nJeronymites.  He therefore begged Las Casas to obtain from the King a\r\ngrant for the Franciscan and Dominican monks of one hundred leagues of\r\ncoast on the mainland about Cumaná, from which laymen should be excluded;\r\nshould one hundred leagues be thought excessive, then he begged for ten,\r\nand failing this he would accept the small islands known as the Alonso\r\ngroup, which lay some fifteen leagues from the coast.  His intention was\r\nto establish a place of refuge, or sanctuary, to which the persecuted\r\nIndians might repair, sure of finding kind treatment, and, through\r\ninstruction, be converted to Christianity.  The Prior declared that unless\r\nsome one of these concessions was made, he would have to recall all the\r\nmonks of his Order from those countries, where it was idle for them to\r\nattempt to teach Christian doctrines, as long as the Indians saw those who\r\ncalled themselves Christians acting in open violation of them.  The\r\ncontents of this letter vexed and alarmed Las Casas not a little, for he\r\nfeared that if the Prior were driven to make good his threat of recalling\r\nhis monks, the Indians would be abandoned, without defence, to the\r\ncruelties of the Spaniards and would soon be exterminated. His one hope of\r\nsupport in his own plans lay in the Dominicans, without whose aid his\r\nefforts were foredoomed to failure. He spoke to the Bishop and the members\r\nof the Council, reading them the letter and addressing earnest appeals to\r\nthem to stop the iniquities which were devastating the entire coast. He\r\nurged, with all the arguments of which he was master, that the one hundred\r\nleagues asked for should be conceded.  The Bishop of Burgos was unmoved,\r\nboth by the Prior’s harrowing description of the outrages committed on the\r\nIndians and by the appeal of Las Casas, and he coolly answered that the\r\nKing would be badly advised to grant a hundred leagues of land to the\r\nfriars, without some return therefor; a reply which Las Casas observes was\r\nunworthy of a successor of the Apostles.  Poor as the Bishop was in\r\nepiscopal qualities, he was even less gifted with those which make a good\r\nminister of colonial affairs, and the results of his thirty-five years of\r\ncontrol of Indian affairs were as unprofitable to the Spanish Crown as\r\nthey were disastrous to the Indians.\r\n\r\nLas Casas did not hesitate to express his opinion to the Bishop with his\r\ncustomary uncompromising frankness, but with no result, save probably that\r\nof confirming his stubborn and hostile attitude.\r\n\r\nPerceiving that no argument which did not promise lucrative returns would\r\navail to secure a grant of territory, the clerigo evolved a plan that\r\npromised to secure the ends for which he and the Dominicans were striving\r\nand, at the same time, would assure a profitable investment for the Crown.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the Bishop’s continued opposition, Las Casas pushed forward\r\nhis plan for colonising, and though the Chancellor’s death was a great\r\nloss to him, he nevertheless found in Cardinal Adrian of Utrecht and other\r\nFlemings, every possible assistance. He was named royal chaplain in order\r\nto give him additional prestige before the public, and letters were sent\r\nthroughout the kingdom to the principal civil and ecclesiastical\r\nauthorities, ordering some and inviting others to aid him by every means\r\nin their power to collect the desired emigrants. The officials of India\r\nHouse in Seville were instructed to receive and attend to those intending\r\nto emigrate under Las Casas, when they arrived in Seville; they were\r\nlikewise directed to prepare the necessary ships to transport them to\r\nAmerica.  It was necessary that Las Casas should be accompanied on his\r\nrecruiting tour through the country by some trustworthy man to help him in\r\nenrolling his emigrants, and, as fate would have it, his choice fell most\r\nunfortunately upon one Berrio, an Italian, a circumstance which Las Casas\r\nafterwards observed was, in itself, sufficient to explain his treachery.\r\nBerrio was to act as herald, publishing in the different cities, with\r\nsound of trumpet, the object of Las Casas’s visit, the high powers he held\r\nfrom the King, and the favourable conditions he offered. To give his\r\nassistant more dignity in the eyes of the people Las Casas procured for\r\nhim the designation of Captain in the royal service, with a salary of four\r\nhundred and five maravedis per day.\r\n\r\nBerrio sold himself to the Bishop of Burgos before the recruiting\r\nexpedition even began, and his signed instructions, which he had engaged\r\nto obey, were fraudulently altered by the latter so as to free him from\r\nall control. Thus provided, he soon detached himself from his rightful\r\nsuperior and went to Andalusia, where he assembled on his own account two\r\nhundred men, vagabonds, loafers, and tapsters, of whom few were labourers\r\nand none fit for colonists. These unpromising recruits were gathered in\r\nSeville, where the officials of India House were at a loss to know what to\r\ndo with them; they finally sailed, but, as the colonial authorities had\r\nreceived no notice concerning them, they landed, destitute and worthless,\r\nin Hispaniola, where their arrival was unwelcome. Many of them died and\r\nthe others scattered in various parts.  It fell to Las Casas to interest\r\nhimself in their behalf and to relieve their miseries, but the meal and\r\nwine he obtained for them arrived in Hispaniola too late, as the intended\r\nbeneficiaries were either dead or widely dispersed.\r\n\r\nIt appears, according to Las Casas’s own account, that emigrants were\r\nattracted to his scheme, not so much by the liberal conditions, or because\r\ntheir circumstances were not prosperous, but by their desire to escape\r\nonerous feudal conditions still prevailing in Spain. It was chiefly,\r\ntherefore, from amongst the dwellers on great estates that his emigrants\r\nwere recruited, for many such said they desired to leave their children\r\nfree in a free country under the King’s protection. The great nobles were\r\nill-pleased at this desertion of their feudatories, and Las Casas soon\r\nfound himself at loggerheads with the Constable of Castile, whose\r\nvillagers at Berlanga were inscribing themselves in great numbers; the\r\nConstable ordered him to quit his estates. On an estate called Rello,\r\nbelonging to the Count of Coruna, out of thirty householders twenty-nine\r\nput down their names as emigrants. As may be supposed the number of the\r\nclerigo’s enemies in high quarters was increased by this state of things,\r\nthough his success in recruiting emigrants enabled him to triumph over the\r\nBishop, who had foretold that he would never get together the necessary\r\npeople.  He was able to say on his return to Zaragoza that not only three\r\nthousand but ten thousand people would willingly go if the Bishop would\r\nprovide the means.\r\n\r\nCardinal Adrian listened sympathetically to the report of what had been\r\ndone and addressed to Las Casas the observation in Latin,  Vere vos\r\ntribuitis aliud regnum regi.\r\n\r\nThe King and his Court left the kingdom of Aragon at this time to visit\r\nthe principality of Cataluña, making his formal entry into Barcelona on\r\nthe fifteenth of February, 1519. The Jeronymite fathers had arranged for\r\nthe sale of the royal haciendas in Hispaniola, and Las Casas, ever on the\r\nalert to secure advantages for his colonists, presented a petition asking\r\nthat they should be maintained for one year at the royal expense. The\r\nvexation of the Bishop of Burgos augmented visibly at this fresh claim for\r\nassistance, and he roundly declared such a concession would cost the Crown\r\nmore than an armada of twenty thousand men, which provoked the pertinent\r\nretort from Las Casas: “Does it appear to your lordship that after you\r\nhave killed off the Indians, I should now lead Christians to death? Well,\r\nI shall not.” As the Bishop, according to Las Casas, was no fool, he hoped\r\nthat he understood this plain answer.\r\n\r\nWithout the assistance which he was convinced was indispensable to the\r\nsuccess of his undertaking, Las Casas refused to move, though every effort\r\nwas made to start him off; an attempt was even made to secure another\r\nleader for the undertaking, but the news of this design was not slow in\r\nreaching him, and he promptly published far and wide, in the district\r\nwhere his recruits were waiting his orders to start, that they should on\r\nno account accept the leadership of another, who would only conduct them\r\nto failure and starvation in the colonies.\r\n\r\nEvents of great importance were occurring at this time which absorbed the\r\nattention of the King and his counsellors to the exclusion of American\r\naffairs. By the death of his grandfather, the Emperor Maximilian, the\r\nsuccession was open, though both Francis I. of France and Henry VIII. of\r\nEngland aspired to the imperial dignity. The royal interest therefore\r\ncentred in Germany and the coming election, and Las Casas and his Indian\r\nschemes were put to one side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. - KNIGHTS OF THE GOLDEN SPUR. THE COURT PREACHERS. FURTHER\r\nCONTROVERSIES\r\n\r\n\r\nAs has been heretofore explained, Las Casas perceived that his efforts to\r\nobtain support for his project would come to naught, unless it could be\r\nmade plain to the Council that some material benefit would accrue to the\r\nroyal revenues; he therefore turned his attention to forming a plan which\r\nshould comprehend the conversion of the Indians by gentle and peaceful\r\nmeans and likewise yield a profit to the Crown. He conceived the idea of\r\nforming a species of order of knighthood, whose members were to be known\r\nas Knights of the Golden Spur. They were to number fifty selected men,\r\neach of whom should furnish two hundred ducats, which he deemed would\r\namount to a sufficient sum for the expenses of founding the colony. The\r\nknights were to wear a dress of white cloth, marked on the breast with a\r\nred cross, similar to the cross of Calatrava, but with some additional\r\nornamentation. The purpose of this costume was to distinguish them in the\r\neyes of the Indians from all other Spaniards.\r\n\r\nA grant of one thousand leagues of coast, beginning one hundred leagues\r\nabove Paria, and with no limits in the hinterland, was asked for the\r\ncolony, in return for which concession a payment of fifteen thousand\r\nducats was promised to the Crown during the first three years, which sum\r\nshould afterwards become an annual income until the seventh year; from the\r\nseventh to the tenth year, the income would be thirty thousand ducats, and\r\nbeginning with the eleventh year, it would reach the sum of sixty\r\nthousand. The foundation of three fortified towns, with at least fifty\r\nSpaniards in each, was promised within the first five years. The religious\r\npropaganda was to be carried on by twelve Franciscan and Dominican friars,\r\nwhom Las Casas was to be allowed to choose: for this purpose the King was\r\nasked to solicit the necessary faculties from the Holy See. Such, in\r\nbrief, was the plan which Las Casas conceived for spreading civilisation\r\non the American coast and winning the Indians to Christianity. His own\r\njurisdiction within the conceded territory was to be absolute, and all\r\nSpaniards whatsoever were to be forbidden by royal command, and under pain\r\nof severe penalties, to cross its borders. The only discoverable road to\r\nliberty lay through absolutism, under a benevolent despot.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious flaw in this scheme was the difficulty—amounting indeed\r\nto impossibility—of finding the fifty knights. Las Casas, like many\r\nenthusiasts and reformers, failed to reckon with the realities of human\r\nnature. His colony was to be a Utopia, peopled by lofty-minded Spaniards,\r\nwho were free from the prevalent thirst for gold, and only preoccupied in\r\ncultivating sentiments of the purest altruism: mixed with them were to be\r\ngentle-mannered Indians, in whom shone all the qualities of primitive man,\r\nunspoiled by contact with the evils of civilisation, and who were\r\nthirsting to know the truth and to embrace it. These idyllic barbarians\r\nwere to furnish the human material on which the knights were to exercise\r\ntheir virtues and all were to be thus united in bonds of loving fraternity\r\nand disinterested industry, under the benign government of a dozen monks,\r\nwho had long since renounced this world and who would give their exclusive\r\nattention to leading their flock from a terrestrial into the celestial\r\nparadise. A Fra Angelico might have grouped these interesting types into a\r\npicture of soul-stirring beauty.  Even had the fifty been found, all with\r\nthe proper dispositions and in harmonious unanimity of purpose, there was\r\nlittle chance that they would remain unaffected by the unbalancing and\r\ncorrupting influences of a new country, where they would be absolute\r\nmasters over an inferior race of people. Many excellent men of the highest\r\nprinciples and best intentions went from Spain to America in those times,\r\nbut few resisted the temptations which beset them.\r\n\r\nLas Casas kept his plan a profound secret until he had secured the\r\napprobation of the new Chancellor, Gattinara, and that of several of the\r\ninfluential Flemings.  It was then laid before the India Council, where it\r\nwas met with a storm of objection and ridicule. It was promptly shelved,\r\nand not all the urging of Las Casas, the discontent of the Flemings, nor\r\neven the efforts of the Chancellor himself to induce the Bishop of Burgos\r\nto study the matter, sufficed to have it taken into serious consideration.\r\nThe different features, as they became known, provoked mirth, and much fun\r\nwas made of the white robes, red crosses, and golden spurs of the knights.\r\n\r\nBaffled by the inertia of the Council and the failure of his powerful\r\nfriends to obtain serious attention for his project, Las Casas had\r\nrecourse to other influences. The oppression of the Indians and the\r\nviolation of their rights as free men not only revolted the humanitarian\r\ninstincts of their Protector, they offended justice and constituted a\r\ngrave crime against morality, by which the King was inculpated and for\r\nwhich he would have to answer at the bar of divine justice. No utilitarian\r\nends could justify criminal means, and that Indian slavery was profitable\r\nto the Crown was in no sense a palliation of its essential wickedness.\r\n\r\nThe King’s confessor, as keeper of the royal conscience, had already in\r\nFerdinand’s time been prevailed upon to explain to his Majesty the grave\r\nresponsibility he incurred in tolerating a state of things so contrary to\r\ndivine and natural laws.  Now Las Casas, in his extremity, turned to the\r\ncourt preachers, who were eight in number, laying before them the entire\r\ncase as a problem in morals, upon which it was within their duty as the\r\nspiritual instructors of the sovereign to pronounce. The part which these\r\necclesiastics took in the matter was brief but not unimportant nor without\r\nresults Two of them were secular priests, the brothers Luis and Antonio\r\nCorodele, both religious and learned men, doctors of the University of\r\nParis; another was Fray Miguel de Salamanca, also a doctor of Paris; there\r\nwas Father Lafuente of the University of Alcalá, a Franciscan, Fray Alonso\r\nde Leon, an Augustinian, Fray Dionisio, and two others whose names Las\r\nCasas was not able to recall when writing his history some forty years\r\nafter these events occurred. This body of learned men represented\r\neverything that was most authoritative in theological and canonical\r\nopinion of the times and constituted a most formidable ally against the\r\nBishop and Council. Meetings of the eight preachers and Las Casas were\r\nheld in the convent of Santa Catalina, at which several other men of\r\nimportance assisted, one of whom was Fray Alonso de Medina, of the\r\nDominicans; while another, a Franciscan friar who had spent much time in\r\nthe Indies, is described as a brother of the Queen of Scotland. These\r\nmeetings, which were secret, were held at the same hour of the day as the\r\nsittings of the India Council.\r\n\r\nReligious dogma was held in that age to be axiomatic and incontrovertible;\r\nall science was interpreted through the medium of the one universal\r\nscience of theology, and the civil law of the times drew its sanction from\r\nthe principles of canon law, from which indeed it was scarcely separable.\r\nJust as it was sought to sustain Galileo’s proposition concerning the\r\nrevolution of the earth by an appeal to theology, and just as theologians\r\nwere considered competent to pronounce on the soundness of the theories of\r\nColumbus, so was it admitted, with far greater reason, to be within their\r\ncompetence to pronounce upon the question of the extension of slavery in\r\nthe Indies, although that matter was treated as one of secular policy,\r\nbelonging to the India Council.  Kings and governments contended, when\r\nthey could, for the exercise of their royal powers in temporal matters,\r\nindependently of the spiritual control, but the line of distinction was a\r\nfine one, not easily drawn, and the basis of Spain’s claim to the Indies\r\nand to the exercise of jurisdiction in America was the Bull of Alexander\r\nVI. issued in May, 1493. The express condition on which the Pope granted\r\nthe Bull was, that the conversion of the Indians should be the primary\r\ncare of the Spanish government, and this condition was so clear and\r\nbinding that it amounted to a reservation to the Pope of an oversight of\r\nthe means to be adopted for that end. As it was within the recognised\r\npower of the Pope to grant such rights and jurisdiction, and to attach\r\nconditions thereto, it was equally within his power to annul or withdraw\r\nthem if the Spanish sovereigns failed to fulfil those conditions. Hence\r\nthe government of the Indies, in all that pertained to the moral\r\nwell-being and religious instruction of the natives, was, beyond question,\r\nwithin the legitimate exercise of ecclesiastical control. The exposition\r\nof the case by Las Casas, supported by the mass of evidence he was able to\r\nfurnish and the testimony of the Scotch Franciscan and others, convinced\r\nthe theologians that their duty, both to religion and to the King bound\r\nthem to intervene and to correct abuses in open violation of the declared\r\nintentions of the sovereigns from the time of Isabella that the Indians\r\nshould be free men, whose conversion to Christianity was their first duty.\r\nThe theologians bound themselves by a common oath, that no opposition\r\nshould discourage them, and that each and all of them would not desist\r\nfrom their single and united efforts, until success had crowned them.  It\r\nwas decided that the first step should be to exhort the members of the\r\nCouncil: this failing of result, they would address their remonstrances to\r\nthe Chancellor, after him to M. de Chièvres, who was nearest the person of\r\nthe King, and in the last resort the monarch himself should be made to\r\nunderstand his responsibility.  Should nothing come of their exhortations,\r\nthey bound themselves to preach openly against the government, instructing\r\nthe public conscience on the subject and assigning to the King his just\r\nshare of the wrong-doing.\r\n\r\nAction followed swiftly upon the adoption of this resolution, and the\r\nIndia Council, under the presidency of the redoubtable Bishop of Burgos,\r\nwas stupefied by the apparition of the theologians at one of its sittings.\r\nFray Miguel de Salamanca, after asking for permission of the President,\r\nmade the following brief but energetic discourse: “Most illustrious\r\ngentlemen and most reverend sir: It has been certified to us, the\r\npreachers of the King our lord, by persons whom we are forced to believe,\r\nand it also appears to be notorious, that men of our Spanish nation in the\r\nIndies commit great and unheard-of evils against the natives of those\r\nparts; such as robberies and murders, thereby giving the greatest offence\r\nto God and bringing infamy on our holy faith, and by which such an\r\ninfinite number of people have perished that large islands and a great\r\npart of the mainland are now depopulated, to the great ignominy even of\r\nthe Royal Crown of Spain; for the Holy Scripture testifies that in the\r\nmultitude of the people consists the dignity and honour of the King, and\r\nin their diminution is his ignominy and dishonour.  We have marvelled at\r\nthis, knowing the prudence and merits of the illustrious persons who\r\ncompose the Council for the government of those countries, to whom God\r\nappears to have confided such a great world as they are said to\r\nconstitute, and for which they will have to render a strict account; on\r\nthe other hand, learning that there can have been no reason why those\r\nnations, which lived peaceably in their countries, owing us nothing,\r\nshould have been destroyed by us, we know not what to say, nor do we find\r\nany one to whom to impute such irreparable evils, other than to those who\r\nuntil now have governed them. Since it is incumbent upon us, by virtue of\r\nthe office we hold at court, to oppose and denounce everything that is an\r\noffence and a dishonour to the Divine Majesty and to souls and, to the\r\nextent of our powers, to exhort until all such be extirpated, we have\r\ndecided, before adopting other measures, to come before your lordships and\r\nmake our purpose known, and to supplicate you to consent to explain to us\r\nhow it has been possible to permit such a great evil without remedying it;\r\nand that since it has not until now been stopped—for it goes on to-day\r\nwith full license—you should devise means to remedy it. It is manifest\r\nthat by so doing, your lordships will receive signal recompense, while by\r\nrefusing, you will, on the contrary, receive terrible torments, for you\r\nbear on your shoulders the heaviest and most dangerous burden, if you well\r\nconsider it, of any men in the world to-day. We likewise beseech your\r\nlordships, with all due humility and reverence, not to attribute our\r\ncoming to temerity, but to accept and judge it by the spirit that has\r\nprompted it, which is the wish to act according to God’s precepts as we\r\nare obliged to do.”\r\n\r\nThe Council—composed of such dignitaries as the Grand Commander of\r\nCastile, Don Garcia de Padilla, the distinguished man of letters, Peter\r\nMartyr, Francisco de los Cobos, and others—listened aghast to this speech,\r\nwhich was followed by a moment of silence that none of them felt prepared\r\nto break. The Bishop, whose wrath had waxed during the discourse, rose\r\nwith an air of great authority and majesty to reply.\r\n\r\n“Great indeed,” he said, “has been your presumption and daring to come to\r\ncorrect the Council of the King. Casas must be at the bottom of this; who\r\nputs you, the King’s preachers, to meddle in government affairs which the\r\nKing entrusts to his Councils? The King does not maintain you for this,\r\nbut to preach the Gospel.”\r\n\r\nThe rebuke fell flat, nor were the theologians one whit overawed by the\r\nBishop’s high tone, for which they were not unprepared.  Father Lafuente,\r\nwho answered, began with a pun: “There is no Casas here but the Casa\r\n[house] of God, in which we officiate and for whose support and defence we\r\nare bound and ready to stake our lives. Does it appear presumption to your\r\nlordship that eight doctors of theology, who might properly address a\r\nwhole General Council on matters of faith and government of the universal\r\nChurch, should come to admonish a Council of the King?  We may admonish\r\nthe King’s Councils for what they do wrong, for by our office we belong to\r\nthe King’s Council, and hence, gentlemen, we come here to admonish you and\r\nto require you to correct those most misguided and unjust actions,\r\ncommitted in the Indies to the perdition of souls and the offence of God.\r\nAnd if you do not correct these things, gentlemen, we shall preach against\r\nyou as against those who do not keep the laws of God, nor act for the\r\nadvantage of the King’s service.  This, gentlemen, is to fulfil and to\r\npreach the Gospel.”\r\n\r\nSuch a threat was no despicable one, and the members of the Council were\r\nbrought by it to a milder disposition than that disclosed by the testy\r\nreply of their President to Fray Miguel’s opening discourse. Garcia\r\nPadilla undertook the apology of the Council, protesting that many\r\nexcellent Provisions in favour of the Indians had emanated from that body,\r\nwhose intentions were good; he offered to submit these proofs of an\r\nequitable disposition to the theologians, though he observed that their\r\npresumption did not merit such courtesy. The tone of the discussion\r\nsoftened considerably and it was decided that the various enactments of\r\nthe Council already in vigour and those it proposed to put in operation\r\nshould be presented to the theologians, who would later make known their\r\nopinion of them. These comprised the Laws of Burgos published in 1512 and\r\nthe several amendments of Cardinal Ximenez.  After hearing them read, the\r\ntheologians withdrew, saying they would present their opinion at another\r\nsitting.\r\n\r\nFray Miguel was deputed to draw up in writing their conclusions, which he\r\ndid in the somewhat lengthy form common at that time, the substance of the\r\ndecision being that repartimientos and encomiendas were condemned\r\nabsolutely, as the principal and direct cause of the destruction of the\r\nIndians; and second, that the only means for correcting the existing\r\nabuses and to civilise and convert the Indians was to form towns of at\r\nmost twelve hundred householders.  Las Casas was opposed to the remedy,\r\nwhich he perceived to be not only without efficacy, but positively hurtful\r\nto the Indians, who would only deteriorate under such unfamiliar\r\nconditions. This divergence of opinion between Las Casas and the preachers\r\nintroduced disunion where unity was the sole source of strength, and the\r\ninability to fix upon a remedy for the evils, which all were agreed cried\r\nout for one, destroyed the force of the representations in favour of the\r\nIndians. All were agreed that the actual state of things was intolerable,\r\nbut they could not agree upon the remedy to be adopted.  In reality no\r\nlaws could cope with the situation.  A weak, retrograde race of ignorant\r\npeople was suddenly brought into contact with the strong, active\r\nSpaniards, who carried with them a civilisation to which the former were\r\ninertly refractory.  There was but the one possible outcome, which has\r\nrepeated itself throughout the world’s history—the weaker race had to go\r\nunder.   Neither the Utopia of Las Casas nor the laws proposed by the\r\npreachers nor any other conceivable arrangement could have saved them.\r\nThe laws enacted were already more than sufficient to protect the natives\r\nfrom oppression and undue suffering, had their application been carried\r\nout in the spirit in which they were framed.  Even the system of\r\nencomiendas might have been worked more rationally, and under it the\r\ncondition of the Indians need not have been a particularly bad one.\r\nPaternal laws, paternally administered in the humane and religious spirit\r\npreached by the Dominicans and Las Casas, might have furnished a remedy,\r\nbut the character of the Spanish colonists, the prevalent greed for\r\nwealth, taken together with the indolent habits and temperament of the\r\nIndians, opposed unsurmountable obstacles.\r\n\r\nThe zeal of Las Casas closed his eyes to these existing conditions, which\r\nforedoomed his efforts to failure and the Indians to destruction.\r\nFortunately it was so, for he was thus enabled to continue his struggle\r\nunflaggingly and to keep the Public conscience in Spain awake to the work\r\nof justice to be accomplished. In this struggle lay the only hope of\r\nprotecting the defenceless natives from undue excesses, of opposing some\r\ncheck to the injustice of the colonists, and of discharging the moral duty\r\nthat Christian Spain had assumed towards her humble subjects in the New\r\nWorld.\r\n\r\nSeeing the uselessness of further dealings with the preachers, Las Casas\r\ndropped that learned body, of which nothing further was ever heard in\r\nconnection with Indian affairs.\r\n\r\nHe next adopted the bold policy of formally accusing the whole Council of\r\nunfairness and partiality—a truly amazing act of courage on the part of a\r\nsimple priest, even though he felt himself supported by the sympathy of\r\nthe Chancellor and several of the King’s Flemish favourites.  More\r\nastonishing must it have been to the members of that august body, that the\r\nsovereign should have ordered the impeachment to be taken into\r\nconsideration. This decision was procured through the influence of the\r\nChancellor, Gattinara, and bore with it the authorisation for Las Casas to\r\ndesignate such persons as he deemed suitable, to sit in the Council with\r\nthose he had accused, and to thus ensure his affairs an impartial hearing.\r\nAt the same time M. de Laxao made known to him that the King desired such\r\npersons to be selected from among the members of other royal councils.\r\nHis choice fell upon Don Juan Manuel, Alonso Tellez, the Marquis de\r\nAguilar del Campo, the licentiate Vargas, and all the Flemings who had\r\nseats in Councils. Besides these, the King desired that whenever the\r\naffairs of Las Casas were to come under consideration, the voting members\r\nof all other Councils, including those of War and of the Inquisition,\r\nshould be present. In virtue of this command, the Cardinal Adrian, who was\r\nat that time Grand Inquisitor of Spain, sometimes assisted. This newly\r\nconstituted Council met rarely, owing to the pressure of public matters of\r\ngrave importance to the country, and the Bishop of Burgos, who was\r\nmortally vexed by the royal decision in favour of Las Casas’s complaint,\r\nwas fertile in pretexts for creating delays. To counteract such\r\nprocrastination, the Grand Chancellor adopted the policy of  citing the\r\nBishop to Council meetings without specifying the nature of the business\r\nto be considered, and when the unsuspecting prelate appeared, expecting to\r\ntreat matters of state, he frequently had Las Casas and his Indian affairs\r\nsprung upon him.  The number of the Council being increased by the\r\nadmission of the new members from five to more than thirty, the Bishop was\r\npowerless to oppose effective resistance, as he could only count on the\r\nvotes of his five original associates. Nor did the clipping of the\r\nBishop’s claws stop there, for whenever he appeared at Court, some of the\r\nFlemings contrived, to his intense disgust, to bring the subject of the\r\nIndies to the King’s attention, so that it only remained for him to appear\r\nas rarely as possible.\r\n\r\nThe Council having consented to the projects of Las Casas, in spite of the\r\nBishop’s persistent opposition, orders were given for the necessary\r\nauthorisations for carrying out his proposed plan.  At this juncture the\r\nBishop discovered an ally in the person of Gonzalez Fernandez de Oviedo,\r\nauthor of the _Historia natural y moral de las Indias_, who had passed\r\nmuch time in America and was highly esteemed as an authority in Indian\r\nmatters.  Oviedo was presented to the Chancellor and explained his reasons\r\nfor condemning the plans of Las Casas but failed to change Gattinara’s\r\nopinion.  Representatives of the colonists in Cuba and Hispaniola spared\r\nno effort to defeat their opponent, promising, if the concessions Las\r\nCasas was asking were granted to them, to pay triple the income to the\r\nCrown which the latter offered.  This offer by the procurators of the\r\ncolonists was not ignored, and, by command of the King, was laid before\r\nthe Council for consideration.  This led to further discussion, for Las\r\nCasas was invited to respond to the counter proposals, which he did with\r\neven more than his usual eloquence.  A special meeting was called, before\r\nwhich Las Casas was plied with questions and objections to his plans; but\r\nif his enemies thought to find him lacking in ready response, they were\r\nsadly deceived, for the promptness with which he disposed of every\r\nobjection, the clearness with which he answered every question, and the\r\nearnestness with which he vindicated the cause of the Indians and flayed\r\ntheir oppressors, ended by convincing even the most indifferent.  The\r\nbrother of the Bishop, Antonio de Fonseca, challenged Las Casas for\r\nunjustly accusing the members of the Council of killing the Indians,\r\nwhereas thanks to his measures such members had long since been obliged to\r\nsurrender their encomiendas; to this argument Las Casas retorted: “Sir,\r\ntheir lordships have not killed _all_ the Indians, but they did kill an\r\ninfinite number while they had them, though the principal and greatest\r\ndestruction has been committed by individual Spaniards with the assistance\r\nof their lordships.”  It was obviously impossible to discuss in open\r\ncouncil with a man who talked thus, and when the Bishop himself, goaded to\r\nimpatience, exclaimed, “Well instructed indeed is a member of the King’s\r\nCouncil who, because he is a member, finds himself in conflict with\r\nCasas!”  he got his answer from the imperturbable priest—“Better\r\ninstructed still is Casas, my lord, who, after having come two thousand\r\nleagues at great risk and peril to save the King and his Council from\r\ngoing to hell on account of the tyrannies and destructions of peoples and\r\nkings which are perpetrated in the Indies, instead of being well received\r\nand thanked for his service, is forced into conflict with the Council.”\r\nThis ended the discussion, and the concession already granted to Las\r\nCasas, was ratified.\r\n\r\nNothing, however, was ever really ended in Spain in those days and too\r\nmany passions had been aroused, too many interests compromised, for the\r\nenemies of Las Casas ever to acquiesce in his victory.  The Bishop of\r\nBurgos was the last man to accept such a defeat, and to his original\r\nstubborn and interested opposition was now added a desire for vengeance on\r\nhis plain-spoken and successful opponent.  From the material contained in\r\nall the numberless petitions from the colonies which he had received at\r\nvarious times, he drew up a memorial to the King, containing thirty\r\nreasons why the concession granted to Las Casas should be refused.  When\r\nthese thirty objections were ready the Bishop asked the Chancellor to\r\nsummon a special meeting of the Council, before which they were read.  Las\r\nCasas was not present at this meeting, but both Cardinal Adrian and the\r\nChancellor notified him and advised him to reply immediately.  The\r\nChancellor’s request to the secretary of the Council, Cobos, to furnish\r\nhim a copy of the memorial meeting with no reply, he sent a formal demand\r\nfor the memorial to be delivered to him without further delay; no denial\r\nwas possible, but the Council only delivered him the document on the sworn\r\nassurance that it should not leave his hands.  Gattinara gave the required\r\npromise, but invited Las Casas and M. de Laxao to supper at his house that\r\nevening, and, laying the great dossier on the table, said to Las Casas,\r\n“Now make your answer to these objections advanced against you.”\r\n\r\n“How, my lord,” answered Las Casas; “they were three months in forging and\r\ndrawing them up, and after reading them at your convenience, it took your\r\nlordship two months to get possession of them, and now I am to answer them\r\nin the space of a Credo! Give me five hours and your lordship shall see\r\nwhat I answer.”\r\n\r\nAs his promise prevented the delivery of the memorial to Las Casas, the\r\nChancellor arranged a table for him in his own apartment where he could\r\ncompose his reply, advising him to make it in the form of answers to\r\nquestions supposed to be addressed to him by the King.  For four nights\r\nLas Casas laboured on his composition until eleven o’clock, at which hour\r\nhe supped with the Chancellor and afterwards returned at midnight to his\r\nlodging, not without fears for his personal safety, for his enemies were\r\nas numerous as they were powerful and sufficiently unscrupulous to use any\r\nmeans for silencing him.\r\n\r\nNo copy exists of these thirty objections and the answers made to them,\r\nand Las Casas says that the originals were burned.  From the little that\r\nis known of the former, they seem to have been so frivolous and strained\r\nthat it is amazing the Council listened to them with patience or that the\r\nChancellor deemed them worthy of a reply.  The first, for example, stated\r\nthat, as Las Casas was a priest, the King had no jurisdiction over him to\r\nrestrain his actions in the territory conceded him; the second asserted\r\nthat by his turbulence he had provoked grave scandals in Cuba; the third\r\npointed out the danger of his forming an alliance with the Venetians or\r\nGenoese and delivering to them the profits of his colony; another accused\r\nhim of having deceived Cardinal Ximenez, and the thirtieth or last of all\r\noracularly stated that there were some secret things known about him of\r\nsuch a damaging nature that they could only be confided to the King’s\r\nprivate ear, and hence were not set down in writing.  This ancient method\r\nof Court intriguers everywhere, whose mysterious accusations can only be\r\nmade in secrecy, without the accuser’s identity being disclosed, is always\r\nnew and is ever useful in cases where the condemnation of the accused is\r\ndetermined beforehand.\r\n\r\nFortunately the Chancellor loved the light, and Las Casas was furnished\r\nthe opportunity of seeing and refuting the accusations against him, which\r\nhe did with entire success, not only clearing himself of every charge\r\ninvented to discredit him, but, turning the tables on his detractors, he\r\nthrew a flood of light on the maladministration of the colonies and the\r\npeculations from the royal revenues by the Spanish officials.  This\r\ncrushing answer, which filled more than twelve sheets of paper, was read\r\nat a special meeting of the Council, which the Chancellor had summoned\r\nwithout letting its object be known, and reduced his enemies to humiliated\r\nsilence.  The only observation which even the usually ready Bishop found\r\nto offer was that the answer had been prepared for Las Casas by the Court\r\npreachers.  The feebleness of this must have struck all present, and the\r\nChancellor with fine irony asked: “You now hold that Micer Bartholomew is\r\nso lacking in argument and discretion that he has to find somebody else to\r\nanswer for him? From what I have heard of him he is equal to this and to\r\nmore besides.”\r\n\r\nGattinara presented a full report of the proceedings to the King, with the\r\nresult that the grant and privileges already conceded to Las Casas were\r\nfully confirmed. Skirmishing between him and the Bishop went on as usual\r\nduring the final settlement of the details with the Council and on one\r\noccasion Las Casas exclaimed to him, “By my faith, my lord, you have\r\nfairly sold me the Gospel and since it is paid for, now deliver it!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. - THE BISHOP OF DARIEN.  DEBATE WITH LAS CASAS. DISAGREEMENT\r\nWITH DIEGO COLUMBUS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe troubles of Las Casas, however, were not yet over, nor did the\r\nopposition to his projects relax; on the contrary, the arrival at\r\nBarcelona in 1519 of Fray Juan Quevedo, the first Bishop of Darien,\r\nbrought a new combatant into the field against him.  On his way from\r\nDarien to Spain, Quevedo had stopped in Cuba, where he had heard the\r\ncomplaints of the enraged colonists, who declared that unless his mad\r\ncampaign against his fellow-countrymen was stopped Las Casas would ruin\r\nthe island, impoverish them all, and destroy every source of revenue.  It\r\nwas thought that Diego Velasquez paid Quevedo to controvert the\r\nrepresentations of Las Casas and to plead the cause of the colonists at\r\nCourt.  As he was a man of considerable weight and an excellent preacher,\r\nVelasquez hoped he might win the King to his way of thinking.  Arriving at\r\nCourt, thus prepared to advocate the interests of Velasquez and the\r\ncolonists, Quevedo was no mean antagonist.  The first meeting between him\r\nand Las Casas took place in the royal ante-chamber where, on being told\r\nwho the newly arrived prelate was, the clerigo approached saying, “My\r\nlord, since I am interested in the Indies it is my duty to kiss your\r\nhand.”  The Bishop asked who the strange priest was and, on being told,\r\nexclaimed with some arrogance, “Oh, Señor Casas! and what sermon have you\r\ngot to preach to us?”  Had he known Las Casas better he would have adopted\r\nother tactics, for the clerigo was not the kind of man to attack. He\r\nanswered: “Certainly, my lord, since some time I have wished to hear your\r\nlordship preach, but I assure your lordship that I have a pair of sermons\r\nready, which if you wish to hear and consider them, may be worth more than\r\nall the money you have brought from the Indies.”\r\n\r\nThis exchange of thinly veiled hostilities was cut short by the appearance\r\nof the Bishop of Badajoz, who came out from audience with the King, and\r\ntook Quevedo off with him to dinner. To forestall any unfavourable\r\ninfluence which Quevedo might seek to exercise on the Bishop of Badajoz,\r\nwho was friendly to Las Casas, the latter made a point of going after\r\ndinner to the Bishop’s house, where he found an illustrious company\r\ncomprising, amongst others, the Admiral, Don Diego Columbus, playing\r\nchequers.  Somebody remarked that wheat was grown in Hispaniola, to which\r\nQuevedo replied that it was impossible. Las Casas, who happened to have in\r\nhis pocket-book some specimen grains which he had gathered in the garden\r\nof the monastery of St. Dominic, mildly observed, “It is certain, my lord,\r\nfor I have seen it of excellent quality in that island, and I may even\r\nsay, look at it yourself, for I have some with me.”  The Bishop lost his\r\ntemper and answered with great asperity: “What do you know?   This is like\r\nthe affairs you manage!  What do you know about the matters you handle?”\r\n\r\n“Are my affairs evil or unjust, my lord,” asked Las Casas.  The Bishop\r\neven more testily exclaimed, “What do you know, or what knowledge and\r\nlearning have you that you venture to handle these affairs?”  Though\r\nmindful not to annoy the Bishop of Badajoz, Las Casas let himself go\r\nsomewhat, and with something of Quevedo’s asperity replied that his\r\nknowledge and learning might be even less than the Bishop conceded, but he\r\n(the Bishop), instead of defending his flock against the tyranny of the\r\nSpaniards, lived on their very flesh and blood, and that if he did not\r\nrestore to the last penny what he had squeezed out of them, he had no more\r\nchance of salvation than had Judas.  The host interfered to allay the\r\nrising choler of his guests, and Las Casas shortly after withdrew.  The\r\nincident, however, had its consequences, for the Bishop of Badajoz related\r\nthe occurrence to the King, who, thinking that a polemical tournament\r\nbetween Las Casas and Quevedo in the royal presence might be something\r\nworth hearing, ordered that both should appear before him three days\r\nlater, to debate the subject.  A Franciscan friar, newly arrived from the\r\nIndies, where he had witnessed the state of things, happened along just\r\nthen and sought out Las Casas to express his full sympathy with the\r\nlatter’s efforts on behalf of the natives. The Franciscan began a series\r\nof sermons at a church near the palace, to which a number of the Flemings\r\nlistened, afterwards reporting their impressions to the King.  His Majesty\r\ntherefore commanded that the monk should also be present on the occasion\r\nof the discussion between Las Casas and Quevedo.  The appearance of the\r\nFranciscan, was not to Quevedo’s liking, and he somewhat tartly remarked\r\nto him that the Court was no place for monks, who had much better be in\r\ntheir cells.  As the Bishop himself was of the same Order, the monk aptly\r\nretorted that he was of the like opinion and that “all of us monks would\r\nbe better off in our cells.”  Quevedo seems to have rarely come out ahead\r\nin the verbal skirmishes his choleric temper prompted him to provoke.\r\n\r\nThe account given by Las Casas of the debate before the King gives us a\r\ngood picture of the stately ceremonial observed at the Court of Charles V.\r\nThe King being seated on his throne, the others present were accommodated\r\non benches extending along both sides of the audience chamber; to the\r\nright of the King sat M. de Chièvres, next to whom was the Admiral Don\r\nDiego Columbus; then the Bishop of Darien and finally the licentiate,\r\nAguirre.  On the left hand of the throne was seated the Grand Chancellor,\r\nnext to whom came the Bishop of Badajoz and so on with the others in their\r\norder of precedence.  Las Casas and the Franciscan stood at the foot of\r\nthe room, opposite the throne.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment of silence following the seating of the Court, M. de\r\nChièvres and the Grand Chancellor rose, advanced together, and mounting\r\nthe steps of the throne knelt before the King, to whom they spoke in\r\nwhispers as though receiving some secret instructions.  Returning then to\r\ntheir respective places and being again seated, the Chancellor said,\r\n“Reverend Bishop, his Majesty commands that if you have anything to say\r\nconcerning the Indies you shall speak.”  The Bishop of Darien rose and\r\nbegan with an eloquent exordium in the classical style customary in such\r\ndiscourses at that time and which produced the best impression on his\r\nhearers.  He declared that he had long desired the honour of appearing in\r\nthe royal presence, and now that God had satisfied his wish, he recognised\r\nthat facies Priami digna erat imperio, which was a graceful reference to\r\nthe Imperial dignity to which the young monarch had recently been elected\r\nin Germany.  He asked, however, that as the matters he had to present to\r\nhis Majesty’s attention were of a private nature, all those present who\r\nwere not members of the Council should be ordered to withdraw.  The\r\nChancellor signed to him to be seated and again he and M. de Chièvres\r\napproached the throne with the same ceremonial and after having received\r\nthe royal commands, sotto voce, they returned to their places and the\r\nChancellor said, “Reverend Bishop, his Majesty commands that if you have\r\nanything to say, you shall speak.” The Bishop however repeated his demand\r\nthat all those not of the Council should withdraw, and a third time the\r\nChancellor and M. de Chièvres went through the ceremony of receiving the\r\nroyal commands. Again the Chancellor, when he resumed his place, said,\r\n“Reverend Bishop, his Majesty commands that if you have anything to say,\r\nyou shall speak, for all here present have been called to be of this\r\nCouncil.”\r\n\r\nThe Bishop’s efforts to exclude Las Casas and the Franciscan being thus\r\ndefeated, for it was impossible for him to insist further, he began as\r\nfollows: “Most potent lord, the Catholic King, your grandfather (may he\r\nrest in holy glory) commanded the construction of an armada to go and make\r\nsettlements on the mainland of the Indies and solicited our very Holy\r\nFather to create me Bishop of that first settlement; besides the time\r\noccupied in coming and going, I have been there five years, and as a\r\nnumerous company went and we only had provisions enough for the journey,\r\nall the rest of our people died of hunger: the remainder of us who\r\nsurvived, in order to escape the fate of the others, have done nothing\r\nduring all that time but rob and kill and eat.  As I perceived that that\r\ncountry was going to perdition and that its first governor was bad and the\r\nsecond worse, I determined to return and report these things to our King\r\nand Lord in whom is all the hope of a remedy.  As for the Indians, judging\r\nby the accounts of those in that country whence I come, and those of\r\nothers whom I saw on my way, they are a natura slaves.”  The remainder of\r\nthis speech has not been preserved, but the opening of it was singular\r\nenough, considering that it was delivered by the advocate of the colonists\r\nand one of the bitterest opponents of Las Casas. At its conclusion the\r\nceremony of taking the royal orders was repeated and the Chancellor\r\ncommanded Micer Bartholomew in the King’s name to speak.\r\n\r\nThe speech which Las Casas then delivered is given, in part, in the third\r\npart of his _Historia General_. (38) In it he declared that he had\r\naccepted his vocation not to please the King but to serve God and that he\r\nrenounced, once for all, any temporal honour or favour his Majesty might\r\never wish to confer upon him.  A remarkably bold sentence followed: “It is\r\npositive, speaking with all the respect and reverence due to so great a\r\nKing and Lord, that I would not move from here to that corner to serve\r\nyour Majesty, saving my fidelity as a subject, unless I thought and\r\nbelieved I would render service to God by so doing.”  The chief point in\r\nthe Bishop’s discourse which he controverted, was the assertion that the\r\nIndians were by nature slaves.  He was supported throughout, and\r\nespecially on this point, by the Franciscan; and even the Admiral Diego\r\nColumbus, who had himself held encomiendas and whose renowned father had\r\nindeed initiated the very abuses which were being denounced, bore witness\r\nto the truth of his statements and the weight of his arguments.  When Las\r\nCasas had finished, Quevedo, who expressed his wish to reply, was notified\r\nthat anything further he had to say must be submitted in writing.  This\r\nclosed the audience and the King withdrew.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the King’s order that his answer to Las Casas should be\r\npresented in writing the Bishop of Darien prepared two statements, one of\r\nwhich set forth all the various abuses and the destruction caused by the\r\nSpaniards in that colony, while the other contained suggestions for\r\nremedying those evils; one of these remedies was the prohibition of the\r\ncustomary raids amongst the Indian tribes and the other was that the\r\npeaceable Indians should be induced to live in villages where they might\r\nbe taught, and also pay some tribute to the Crown.  The Bishop’s view of\r\nthe lamentable state of things in the colony, his condemnation of the\r\nviolent conduct of the Spaniards, and his opinion that it was urgent to\r\nintroduce a new system for regulating the relations between the colonists\r\nand natives seem not to have differed from those of Las Casas himself, and\r\nboth the corrective measures he proposed met with the latter’s hearty\r\napproval.  These memorials were first read by the Bishop to the Chancellor\r\nand M. Laxao, both of whom were highly satisfied to discover such\r\nunexpected conformity with the representations of their friend the\r\nclerigo.  When asked by them what he thought of Las Casas’s projects, the\r\nBishop replied that he found them excellent and most just.\r\n\r\nThis singular conversion of the Bishop of Darien from a formidable\r\nopponent into a supporter, delighted Las Casas, who, when the Chancellor\r\nshowed him the two memorials, asked for a pen that he too might sign them,\r\nsaying: “Did I ever tell your lordship more than the Bishop has here\r\nadmitted? What greater cruelties, murders, and destruction in that country\r\nhave I ever reported to your lordship than these?”\r\n\r\nWhat influence worked upon Quevedo does not appear; whether he perceived\r\nthat the King looked with sympathy on the enthusiastic Las Casas and that\r\nthe latter was high in favour with the important Flemish group at Court\r\nand therefore sure to carry his point, and so decided, as a practised\r\ncourtier, to pass over to the winning side, or whether under his choleric\r\nexterior there was a chord that responded to the sufferings of the obscure\r\nIndians in their miseries, and a sense of justice that was outraged by the\r\nrapacious cruelty of his countrymen, we have no means of knowing.  Shortly\r\nafterwards he fell dangerously ill of a sickness which carried him off in\r\nthree days.  Las Casas was much impressed by his Christian end and by the\r\nfact that before he died he had been moved to testify to the true\r\ncondition of things in the Indies, than which no other act on his part\r\ncould have been a better preparation for death.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of Las Casas were now well advanced and all seemed plain\r\nsailing ahead; he conferred with Diego Columbus, Admiral of the Indies,\r\nconcerning the foundation of the forts he had undertaken to build along\r\nthe coast at intervals of one hundred leagues from one another. These\r\nforts were to serve for defence and also as centres of trade to which the\r\nIndians would be attracted to bring their gold, pearls, and other things\r\nof value to be exchanged for the Spanish merchandise they\r\nprized—hawks’-bells, beads of coloured glass, and like trifles.  The\r\nAdmiral was in agreement with this project, until he consulted his brother\r\nFernando Columbus, who suggested to him that he should ask from the King\r\nthe administration of justice in the new settlements and their extensions.\r\nLas Casas opposed this project, but the Admiral followed his brother’s\r\ncounsel and presented his petition to the Council, where it was\r\ndisallowed; the Admiral in consequence took no further interest in the\r\nplan and thus Las Casas was deprived of his valuable support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. - ROYAL GRANT TO LAS CASAS. THE PEARL COAST. LAS CASAS IN\r\nHISPANIOLA. FORMATION OF A COMPANY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the date for the King’s departure from Spain to assume the imperial\r\ndignity drew near the opposition to his leaving grew so strong that the\r\nquestion of stopping him by force, if necessary, was even mooted, and\r\nvarious parts of Spain were in a state of ferment bordering on civil war.\r\nCharles left Barcelona and proceeded through Aragon to Burgos and from\r\nthence to Coruña, where he had summoned the Córtes of Castile to assemble.\r\nThis city had been chosen, partly because it was a convenient port of\r\nembarkation and partly, also, because the tide of opposition and hatred\r\nagainst the Flemish courtiers had reached such a height that they felt it\r\nwiser to keep to a seaport, from whence flight would be easier than from\r\nan inland town, in case their position became untenable after the King’s\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of such preoccupations, it required all the energy and\r\nunflagging perseverance of Las Casas to keep his affairs to the front and\r\nsave them from being forgotten; as it was, even he had moments of\r\ndiscouragement in which he was tempted to drop the whole matter and retire\r\nfrom the Court.  His faithful Flemings, however, did not fail him, and\r\nwith their aid, he managed to get no less than seven days in the month of\r\nMay devoted to Indian affairs, before the sovereign sailed from Coruña.\r\n\r\nDuring one of these sittings of the Council, Cardinal Adrian contrived to\r\novercome the opposition which was still active against Las Casas, by a\r\nmasterly discourse, in which he proved that by all natural and divine\r\nlaws, the policy so far pursued in the Indies was a mistaken one, and that\r\nthe Indians must be civilised and converted by humane and peaceful means.\r\nThe desired grant was finally made and consisted of two hundred and sixty\r\nleagues of coast between Paria and Santa Marta, inclusively, and extending\r\ninland in a direct line from its two extremities to the South Sea. The\r\ntext of this grant, which Charles V. signed in Coruña on May 19, 1520,\r\nfills several chapters of the third part of the _Historia General de las\r\nIndias_.\r\n\r\nAll the necessary formalities having been complied with and all obstacles\r\novercome, Las Casas was at last ready to launch his colonial venture.\r\nFriends in Seville advanced him loans of money and others presented him\r\nwith a quantity of article of trade, of small enough value in Spain but of\r\ngreat worth in the eyes of the Indians.  The fifty men who were to adopt\r\nthe white habit of the Knight of the Golden Spur had not been selected,\r\nbut it was thought well to begin the settlement with labourers and perhaps\r\nto choose the candidates for the new knighthood from amongst the Spaniards\r\nalready settled in the Indies.  He sailed with his little company from San\r\nLucar de Barrameda on November 11, 1520, and after an uneventful voyage\r\nreached the island of Puerto Rico, called by the Indians Boriquen, and\r\nfirst named San Juan by the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nWhile Las Casas had been sustaining his long struggle in Spain in behalf\r\nof the Indians, a series of disastrous events had occurred in America,\r\nwhich created serious obstacles in the way of his scheme for colonisation.\r\nIn 1518 some Dominican and Franciscan friars had founded two convents on\r\nthe Pearl Coast, the former at Chiribichi and the latter at Maracapana,\r\nsome seven leagues distant at the mouth of the Cumaná River and just\r\nopposite the island of Cubagua.  These religious communities had\r\nestablished the most peaceful relations with all the Indians in their\r\nneighbourhood and the friars came and went with perfect freedom, being\r\nwelcomed in all the villages.  All went quietly until the arrival of one\r\nAlonzo de Ojeda, who came from Cubagua, engaged ostensibly in the pearl\r\ntrade, but likewise in raiding for slaves. Pearl diving was as perilous\r\nand fatal an occupation for the Indians as the work in the mines of\r\nHispaniola and Cuba, and such numbers had perished in Cubagua that it was\r\nnecessary to replenish the vacancies by bringing others from the\r\nneighbouring mainland.  When Ojeda landed at Chiribichi he repaired to the\r\nconvent, where he found but one priest and a lay-brother, all the others\r\nbeing absent, preaching to the Spaniards in Cubagua.  As he expressed a\r\nwish to see the cacique, Maraguey, the priest, thinking no evil, sent to\r\ninvite the Indian to come to the monastery; on his arrival, Ojeda began to\r\nquestion him as to whether cannibalism was practised by any tribes in the\r\nneighbourhood, his answers being taken down on paper by a notary.  The\r\ncacique declared that there were no cannibals thereabouts and, being\r\ndispleased by the questions and alarmed by the formalities of ink and\r\npaper, he quickly withdrew.  Ojeda next went to the convent at Maracapana,\r\nwhere the cacique, called Gil Gonzalez, came to meet him with every\r\ndemonstration of friendship.  Ojeda declared he had come to trade and\r\nwished to buy maize, and on the day following his arrival he left with\r\nfifteen of his men to go inland in search of the grain.  Fifty Indians\r\ntransported the loads from the interior to the coast, and while these\r\nbearers were resting, the Spaniards suddenly drew their weapons, killing\r\nsome who tried to escape and forcing all the others on board their\r\ncaravel.  The effect of this act of unprovoked treachery in a peaceful\r\nsettlement, where the Indians had received the newcomers with every\r\nhospitality as guests, may be easily imagined, and as was natural, Gil\r\nGonzalez planned vengeance for the outrage.  The scene at the convent\r\nwhither the cacique of Chiribichi had been summoned by his friend the\r\npriest, and the impressive formality of the writing with pen and paper\r\nfurnished by the priest, unfortunately identified the monks in the minds\r\nof the Indians with Ojeda and his exploits.  The alarm was passed all\r\nalong the coast, and the Indians bided the moment for a favourable attack;\r\nnor had they long to wait, for Ojeda, accompanied by ten men, came on\r\nshore again on Saturday as indifferently as though nothing had happened.\r\nGil Gonzalez affected to receive them in a friendly manner, but no sooner\r\nhad they reached the village than the Indians fell upon them, killing\r\nOjeda and several others, while the remainder barely succeeded in reaching\r\nthe caravel.  The Indians even went out in canoes to attack the vessel but\r\nwere repulsed, and the Spaniards, setting sail, put to sea.\r\n\r\nThe defenceless friars remained, however, and at Chiribichi the priest,\r\nwhile vesting to say mass, and the lay-brother were both killed by the\r\npeople of the cacique Maraguey and the convent was burned.  So great was\r\nthe fury of the Indians that they even killed a horse with which the monks\r\nworked in their garden.\r\n\r\nThe news of this massacre reaching Hispaniola from the Spaniards at\r\nCubagua, the royal Audiencia at once despatched a small force under\r\nGonzalo de Ocampo to punish the Indians, and the disheartening news of\r\nthese turbulent events was the greeting that met Las Casas on his arrival\r\nat Puerto Rico.  Knowing that Ocampo’s armada would touch there on its way\r\nto the Pearl Coast, he determined to await its arrival, where in fact\r\nOcampo appeared within a few days.  Las Casas had been a neighbour of his\r\nin other days and, though he knew that his treatment of the Indians did\r\nnot differ from that of the other colonists, he held him in some esteem.\r\nHe showed Ocampo his cedulas with the royal signature, which prohibited\r\nany Spaniards from landing, against his will, in the territory granted to\r\nhim, and he formally required him to desist from his errand of vengeance.\r\nOcampo answered that, while he did not refuse obedience to the royal\r\ncommands, he was in this instance acting under the orders of the royal\r\nAudiencia and was obliged to carry out the instructions he had received;\r\nthe responsibility lay with the Audiencia, which would protect him from\r\nany consequences following the execution of its mandate.\r\n\r\nSeeing that Ocampo was not to be stopped, Las Casas resolved to go himself\r\nto Hispaniola, show his powers to the Audiencia, and exact the recall of\r\nthe fleet.  Meanwhile he placed his colonists amongst the various planters\r\nof Puerto Rico, who were glad enough to welcome labourers, who were scarce\r\nin the island.  This decision of Las Casas was a most mistaken one and was\r\nthe outcome of an error of judgment which did not require the light of\r\nafter events to make plain.  More was certainly to be hoped from his\r\npresence on the spot, and from the influence he might exercise over\r\nOcampo, than from anything he could obtain from the Audiencia, whose\r\nmembers were his bitterest enemies.   It was, moreover, impossible for any\r\ncounter-orders he might be able to wrest from the reluctant Audiencia, to\r\nreach the Pearl Coast in time to stop the action of Ocampo, and Las Casas\r\ndoes not even appear to have sought to detain the latter in Puerto Rico,\r\npending the arrival of further instructions.\r\n\r\nAfter dividing his colonists, who thus became scattered, and lost touch\r\nwith him and with one another, Las Casas bought a vessel for five hundred\r\ndollars—an enormous sum at the time—in which he sailed for Hispaniola.\r\nHis arrival in Santo Domingo was most unwelcome and revived all the\r\nancient odium of the colonists against him, for he was without doubt the\r\nbest-hated man in America.\r\n\r\nHe presented his papers to the Governor, and a meeting of some ten\r\nofficials, who composed what was termed the Consulta and dealt with local\r\nquestions, was convoked to consider his demands.  The first of these was,\r\nthat the provisions of the royal grant to him should be formally\r\npublished, according to custom, with sound of trumpet so that all the\r\ncolonists might clearly understand the prohibition for any one to enter\r\nthe territory conceded to him, without his permission, and that all\r\nSpaniards were commanded to treat the Indians humanely, and to keep faith\r\nwith them in treaties and contracts under severe penalties at the King’s\r\npleasure.  Second he demanded that the Consulta should order all Spaniards\r\nto quit the territory of his concession, and should recall Ocampo\r\nforthwith, as the murder of the friars there had been provoked by the\r\nbarbarous conduct of Ojeda.\r\n\r\nAs his previous experience might have taught him, the Consulta listened\r\nwith gravity to his demands and permitted the proclamation of his cedulas,\r\nbut when it came to taking any action to restrain Ocampo, reasons for\r\ndelay were found and the matter dragged on without anything being\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nIt being to the interests of those colonists who were expecting a rich\r\ncargo of slaves to be brought back by Ocampo, from his punitive\r\nexpedition, to hinder the departure of Las Casas and, if possible, to\r\nwreck his plans for colonising, divers means were invented to accomplish\r\nthis object.  A rumour was started that his five-hundred-dollar vessel was\r\nin a bad condition and unseaworthy; the authorities decided that this\r\npoint must be investigated, so several persons were named to examine the\r\nboat and report on her condition. They did so, and promptly reported that\r\nthe vessel was not merely unseaworthy, but was in such a state that no\r\nrepairs would make her so, and that the only course was to dismantle her.\r\nThus Las Casas beheld his five hundred dollars vanish and himself a\r\nfixture in Hispaniola.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Ocampo had reached the Pearl Coast and, feigning to come\r\ndirectly from Spain with merchandise and to be entirely ignorant of the\r\nmurder of Ojeda and the friars, he succeeded in luring the cacique Gil\r\nGonzalez close to his ship, when a naked sailor dived overboard, grappled\r\nwith the cacique in his canoe and finally stabbed and killed him. A\r\nlanding was then made and the country raided with the usual accompaniment\r\nof murders, torturings, and capturing of the natives, many of whom were\r\ncarried on board the vessels and sent back to Hispaniola, to be sold as\r\nslaves. Ocampo, with others of his followers who remained behind, founded\r\na town, half a league up the Cumaná River, which he named New Toledo.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the slave cargo at Hispaniola where Las Casas was still\r\nengaged in altercations with the authorities, threw him into a terrible\r\nrage.  He protested vehemently before the Audiencia against the deliberate\r\nand open violation of the royal commands, whose contents had been publicly\r\nproclaimed, and he threatened to return forthwith to Spain and lay the\r\ncase before the King, from whom he would obtain the punishment of the\r\nauthors of the outrage and their condemnation to pay all the expenses of\r\nOcampo’s armada, which had been illegally charged to the Royal treasury.\r\n\r\nNobody doubted that he was capable of executing his threat, and, since it\r\nwas known that he enjoyed the protection of the all-powerful Flemings and\r\nwas something of a favourite with the young King himself, the members of\r\nthe Consulta and some of the principal men in the colony decided, after\r\nmany discussions, that it would be well to appease the clerigo’s wrath and\r\ncome to some arrangement with him for their mutual benefit.  It was then\r\nproposed to form a company, in which there should be twenty-four\r\nshareholders, each of whom should contribute an identical sum and derive\r\nan equal profit from the undertaking on the Pearl Coast.  Six of the\r\nshares should be assigned to the Crown, six to Las Casas and his fifty\r\nknights of the Golden Spur, three to Admiral Diego Columbus, one to each\r\nof the four auditors of the Audiencia, and the remaining five to the\r\ntreasurer Pasamonte and the other officials of the Audiencia.\r\n\r\nThis scheme was submitted to Las Casas, who must by that time have been\r\nwell-nigh in despair, and, although it very materially changed his\r\noriginal plan, it offered the only possible means for carrying out his\r\nintentions, so he agreed to the formation of the company.  The agreement\r\nupon which the company was based gave to Las Casas Ocampo’s armada with\r\nseveral brigantines and barques and all their contents, and he was to\r\nchoose amongst the three hundred followers of Ocampo one hundred and\r\ntwenty, who should constitute the armed force of the new colony, under the\r\nlatter’s command.  This arrangement, so it was pretended, would leave Las\r\nCasas free to dedicate all his efforts to the conversion of the Indians.\r\nThe last article of the agreement was almost comical. It provided that\r\nwhen Las Casas himself should denounce any Indians as cannibals, the\r\nSpaniards should be bound to declare war against them and make slaves of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHe afterwards wrote concerning the articles of agreement as follows:\r\n\r\n“Great was the blindness or ignorance—if indeed it was not malice—of those\r\ngentlemen to believe that the clerigo would ever fulfil those horrible and\r\nabsurd conditions, knowing him to be a good Christian, not covetous, and\r\nready to die to liberate and help in saving those people from the\r\ncondition in which they were held.”\r\n\r\nWith his armada well equipped, and a plentiful supply of provisions and\r\nmerchandise for trading purposes on board, Las Casas finally sailed from\r\nHispaniola in July, 1521, directing his course first to the island of\r\nMona, where a quantity of cassava bread was to be taken on board, and from\r\nthence to Puerto Rico, where he expected to collect his original\r\ncolonists.  On his arrival there, not one however, was found to join the\r\nexpedition, as they had long since dispersed throughout the island or had\r\njoined marauding expeditions to capture Indians.  This defection must have\r\ncaused Las Casas great disappointment, for he had assembled these men with\r\ngreat care in Spain, choosing only such as he thought from their good\r\ncharacter to be adapted for his ideal colony.  The change which their new\r\nand strange surroundings had operated in these peaceful, simple folk was\r\nnot unnatural; loosed from all the anchors that held them to habits of\r\nindustry and probity, they found themselves caught in new currents;\r\ncupidity was awakened by the gold-fever that infected all the colonists,\r\nthe pious projects with which they left Spain under the guidance of their\r\napostolic leader were easily abandoned when the influence of his\r\nenthusiasm was withdrawn, and they took to the freebooting ways and easy\r\nmorals of the colonists with whom they were thrown.  Las Casas had\r\nneglected to realise that they were not angels.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at that part of the Pearl Coast called Cumaná, it was found\r\nthat Ocampo’s colony of New Toledo was already in the throes of discontent\r\nfrom hunger and disease; his men had begun by pressing the Indians into\r\nservice, with the result that all the natives abandoned the country,\r\nleaving the Spaniards to starve.  When it became known that those who\r\nchose might return to Hispaniola, every man of them declared he would go,\r\nso Las Casas was left with a few of his friends and some who were in his\r\npay.  Ocampo showed sincere regret and much sadness at abandoning his old\r\nfriend, for whom, in spite of their differences, he had a sincere\r\nadmiration, in such a plight.  He took leave of him with many\r\ndemonstrations of affection, and joining his men sailed away to\r\nHispaniola.\r\n\r\nLas Casas was now in his long-desired territory, but the material for\r\nstarting his colony was sadly reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. - THE IDEAL COLONY.   FATE OF THE COLONISTS. FAILURE OF THE\r\nENTERPRISE\r\n\r\n\r\nSome time before the events just recounted, Franciscan friars from Picardy\r\nhad been sent to the Pearl Coast by the Prior Pedro de Cordoba, under the\r\nleadership of Fray Juan Garceto, and this little community heard the news\r\nof Las Casas’s coming with profound joy.  Upon his arrival, they came to\r\nmeet him singing Te Deum Laudamus and Benedictus qui venit in nomine\r\nDomini.  The convent was modest enough, being rudely constructed of wood\r\nand thatch, and the life of the friars in the midst of the vast wilderness\r\nabout them was one of the most apostolic simplicity.  The house stood\r\nabout a musket-shot back from the Cumaná River in a beautiful garden\r\nwhich, in such a climate, was not a difficult achievement.  Las Casas\r\nbuilt a large storehouse on one side of the garden for his trading\r\nmerchandise and, through the friars and an Indian woman called Maria, who\r\nhad learned Spanish, he published among the Indians that he had been sent\r\nby the new King of the Christians in Spain, and that henceforth there\r\nwould be no more fighting, but all were to live together in peace and\r\nfriendship. In order to attract them, he made them presents from his\r\nstores; but it was not unnatural that the diffidence of the Indians should\r\nyield but slowly to these blandishments after the deceptions of which they\r\nhad been the victims, and besides, Las Casas could not trust his own\r\ndependents, but had to keep a sharp eye continually on them, to prevent\r\nthem scandalising and offending the natives.  Under such discouraging\r\ncircumstances, progress was inevitably slow.\r\n\r\nNot only were the Spaniards under his own control in little harmony with\r\nthe spirit of his intentions and as refractory as they dared be to his\r\norders, but the pearl fishers on the island of Cubagua, who were a typical\r\nlot of godless ruffians, frequently came to the mainland, with the valid\r\nexcuse that the absence of sweet water on their island obliged them to\r\nfetch their supply from the Cumaná River.  These expeditions for water\r\nwere usually accompanied by some disturbances with the Indians, some of\r\nwhom were frequently captured and carried off to work in the pearl\r\nfisheries.\r\n\r\nTo put a stop to these incursions into his territory, Las Casas contracted\r\nwith a mason, for eight dollars in gold per month, to build him a fort at\r\nthe mouth of the river; but the people at Cubagua, hearing of this project\r\nwhich would interrupt and control their movements, contrived to so\r\ninfluence the mason that he threw up his contract and abandoned the work,\r\nthus leaving the country defenceless.  The Cubaguans seduced and ruined\r\nthe Indians, chiefly by offering them liquors and spirits, which have\r\nalways proved the white man’s most attractive and destructive products to\r\nthe savage and have ever gone in the vanguard of civilisation.  The\r\nIndians gave everything they possessed for alcohol even selling their\r\nfellows as slaves, in exchange for wines; these they drank to inordinate\r\nexcess, and in the fury of their debauch quarrels broke out amongst them\r\nwhich ended in murders and a state of the most riotous disorder, against\r\nwhich Las Casas and the monks struggled in vain.  The strongest\r\nrepresentations and protests were made to the alcalde of Cubagua, whither\r\nLas Casas went in person, but, far from producing the desired result, his\r\nefforts to protect his own territory only served to excite increased\r\nresentment on the part of his lawless neighbours, and neither his own life\r\nnor that of the Franciscans was any longer safe from the threatened\r\nreprisals of their hostile countrymen.  The situation was one of the\r\ngreatest gravity and even peril; instead of showing promise of\r\nimprovement, it grew daily worse; for, though the men at Cubagua were\r\nsomewhat restrained from venturing upon open acts of hostility directed\r\nagainst him since they had seen what powers the royal cedulas gave him,\r\ntheir ingenuity in devising vexations, inventing contrarieties, and\r\ncreating obstacles which effectually nullified all his efforts, was\r\nextraordinarily fertile.  Fray Juan Garceto was of the opinion that Las\r\nCasas should return to Hispaniola to complain to the Audiencia and demand\r\nthat some effective restraint be exercised upon the Spaniards at Cubagua\r\nor, failing of success there, that he should even go to the King himself\r\nto obtain redress and the punishment of the offenders.  This advice did\r\nnot accord with Las Casas’s own view, for he had reason to know how\r\ndifficult it was to obtain anything from the Audiencia and how easy it was\r\nto evade even the most explicit provisions of royal cedulas, when it\r\nsuited the interest of those concerned to do so.  His absence at such a\r\ncritical moment would also remove the one effective restraint on the\r\nlawlessness of the Cubaguans and doubtless result in the total destruction\r\nof his stores, which were valued at fifty thousand castellanos.  Two\r\nvessels were lying off  the coast, loading salt for Hispaniola, and during\r\nthe days previous to their sailing both Las Casas and Fray Juan gave\r\nthemselves up to earnest prayer and each offered his daily mass to obtain\r\nsome divine guidance as to the right course to pursue, since they were in\r\nabsolute disagreement.  Las Casas prepared a full statement of the\r\nsituation, and a petition asking the Audiencia to furnish the necessary\r\nremedy without delay, which he intended to despatch by one of the ship’s\r\ncaptains in case he did not go himself when the sailing day came.  The\r\nlast day finally arrived, and Fray Juan, after saying his mass, sought Las\r\nCasas and said, “It is your duty, sir, to go and on no account to stop\r\nhere.”  “God knows,” replied Las Casas, “how much this goes against my\r\njudgment and my wishes but, since it seems right to your Reverence, I am\r\nwilling to do it; if it is an error, I would rather err by the judgment of\r\nanother than be right by my own, for I hope in God.”  The wisdom of\r\nsubmitting his judgment as an act of religious humility in a matter\r\nconcerning his own spiritual welfare would have been laudable, but Las\r\nCasas was far more qualified to judge on a question of policy affecting\r\nthe welfare of his enterprise than was Fray Juan Garceto, and the\r\nresponsibility for repeating the blunder he had made in Puerto Rico of\r\nabandoning his colony while he went off to protest to the Audiencia, must\r\nrest where it belongs—on his own shoulders—and not where he sought to put\r\nit—on those of the humble Franciscan.   If somebody had to go—and it seems\r\nthat the necessity was urgent—then Fray Juan had better have taken the\r\nletters and gone himself before the Audiencia, leaving Las Casas to\r\nwithstand his enemies and keep his colony together as best he could, until\r\nthe Audiencia despatched some authority to effectively restrain the\r\nCubaguans.  His resolution taken, in accordance with the friar’s\r\ninspiration, Las Casas appointed Francisco de Soto, a native of Olmedo, as\r\ncaptain during his absence and gave him full instructions for his\r\nguidance.  It was especially impressed upon the captain that on no account\r\nshould he permit the two vessels which the colony possessed to leave the\r\nharbour; he was to be on the alert and in case of open hostilities he was\r\nto load the merchandise on board if possible, but if not, then to save all\r\nhis people and take refuge at Cubagua.  Much preoccupied as to the fate of\r\nthose he left behind and uncertain as to the wisdom of his course, Las\r\nCasas set out for Hispaniola, leaving all he possessed in the convent,\r\nsave one box of his clothing and another containing some books.\r\n\r\nIt is illustrative of the capricious and light-hearted spirit of\r\ndisobedience to all authority, save what force imposed, which\r\ncharacterised Spanish officials in America, that the first thing De Soto\r\ndid, before the ship bearing Las Casas was barely out of sight, was to\r\nsend away his two vessels, one in one direction and the other in the\r\nopposite, to fish for pearls and, if possible, to capture Indians.  The\r\nnatives were in a state of unrest owing to the continual vexations of the\r\npeople of Cubagua and also of Las Casas’s men who, as soon as he was gone,\r\nbecame almost as bad as the others.  The beautiful speeches in which peace\r\nand justice and friendship were promised for the future, under the\r\npowerful protection of the new King of Spain, had resulted in nothing, and\r\nthe last illusion of the Indians vanished with the disappearance of the\r\nship that bore their protector towards Hispaniola.  A general massacre of\r\nthe colony was concerted to take place about fifteen days after Las Casas\r\nleft.  The Franciscans got wind of it three days before the date fixed and\r\nthough the Indian woman Maria, when asked, denied the plot in words, she\r\nconveyed to the friars by gestures that she had lied because the presence\r\nof other Indians intimidated her from telling the truth.  A Spanish\r\ntrading ship arrived in these days, but in spite of the colonists’ prayers\r\nto be taken on board the captain refused, so the hapless men were left to\r\ntheir fate. At the last moment an effort was made to organise some defence\r\nand twelve or fourteen pieces of artillery were mounted around the\r\nstorehouse, but when they came to examine the powder, it was found—oh,\r\nSpanish improvidence!—to be so damp that it was useless.  At sunrise they\r\nthought to dry it, but they were too late, for with fierce war-whoops, the\r\nIndians were upon them; three of their number were killed and the\r\nstore-house, in which the others had barricaded themselves, was set on\r\nfire.  Fortunately there was a small door that gave access to the garden,\r\nthrough which they escaped from the burning building.  De Soto, who had\r\nbeen out to reconnoitre the town was wounded with a poisoned arrow, but\r\nmanaged to reach the garden where the others were.  The friars had\r\nconstructed a canal through their garden leading to the river and on this\r\nthey had a large Indian canoe capable of holding fifty persons.  This\r\ncanoe was now their sole hope of safety and everybody managed to get into\r\nit, save one unfortunate lay-brother who had taken refuge among some reeds\r\nalong the bank and was only discovered after the canoe had pushed off.\r\nSeeing his companions borne swiftly away on the saving current, he rose\r\nfrom his hiding-place with despairing gestures of appeal, but though every\r\neffort was made to reach him it was in vain, and he, poor man, seeing that\r\nhis situation was hopeless, signalled to them with pathetic heroism to\r\nleave him and save themselves while they could.  He was killed a few\r\nmoments later when the Indians, not knowing of the egress into the garden\r\nand believing that all the Spaniards were inside the burning building,\r\ncame round to the other side of the Storehouse.  When they caught sight of\r\nthe fugitives in the canoe, they quickly launched a swift pirogue and set\r\nout in pursuit of the canoe.  The Spaniards had already doubled the point\r\ncalled Hraga and were a league down the river, but they were exhausted\r\nwith hard rowing and the light pirogue of their pursuers gained so rapidly\r\nupon them that their only hope was to take refuge in the thick underbrush\r\nalong the shore, where the Indians, being naked, could not penetrate on\r\naccount of the thorns.  The canoe and the pirogue touched land almost at\r\nthe same time and not far from one another.  Fray Juan afterwards\r\nrecounted to Las Casas how he was overtaken by an Indian and, seeing the\r\nclub raised to strike him, he threw himself on his knees, closed his eyes,\r\nand prepared for death; the blow did not fall, and on opening his eyes he\r\nfound himself alone, with no Indian in sight.  Finding it impossible to\r\nreach the Spaniards in their refuge in the thorny thicket, the Indians\r\nwithdrew and the Christians, covered with blood from their many wounds,\r\nmanaged, though in a truly pitiable plight, to reach some boats which were\r\nloading salt not far off.  It was then noticed for the first time that\r\ntheir captain, Francisco de Soto, was missing and, as some one remembered\r\nhaving seen him concealed under a great rock in the thicket, a boat was\r\nsent to look for him.  After three days’ search he was found, dying of\r\nthirst, and on being brought on board and given water, he finished himself\r\nby drinking to excess.  Thus the author of all the mischief paid the\r\npenalty of his imprudence and disobedience with his life.\r\n\r\nWhile the colonists were undergoing these sufferings, Las Casas found\r\nhimself on board a vessel whose pilots, ignorant of the chart, carried him\r\neighty leagues beyond the harbour of Hispaniola and wasted two months in\r\nbeating against the currents to pass the little island La Beata.  Seeing\r\nthe hopeless incompetency of these men, he had himself put ashore at the\r\nharbour of Jaquimo some twenty leagues lower down, from whence he could go\r\non to Jaguana and so across the island to the city of Santo Domingo.  The\r\nnews of the disaster at Cumaná had long since reached Hispaniola and Las\r\nCasas heard of it in the following manner, while journeying on foot across\r\nthe island with several companions.  One day, while he was taking his\r\nafternoon siesta under a tree, a party of travellers joined his\r\ncompanions, who enquired what news there was in Santo Domingo or from\r\nSpain.  The newcomers answered that the only recent news was that of the\r\nmurder of the clerigo Las Casas and all his colony at Cumana by the\r\nIndians.  “We are witnesses to prove that that is impossible” replied the\r\nothers, and the discussion which ensued awakened the clerigo who thus\r\nreceived the disheartening tidings, which he was inclined to believe, of\r\nthe total destruction of his hopes.  He afterwards attributed this\r\ncatastrophe to his own weakness in allowing himself to be drawn into a\r\npartnership with godless men, whose sole object was to enrich themselves,\r\nby which he had offended God and merited punishment. He would have done\r\nbetter to keep to his original plan of forming a religious company of\r\nKnights of the Golden Spur, who, aided by the friars, would have embarked\r\nwith him on the conversion of the natives without mingling any expectation\r\nof profitable trade with their project.  The struggle for immediate and\r\ninordinate gain, in which the Spanish colonists were engaged, with its\r\nslave raids, extermination of the Indians by selling them alcoholic\r\nliquors and forcing them into the dangerous labours of mining and pearl\r\ndiving, was incompatible with such a colony as Las Casas designed to\r\nfound, and the agreement into which he entered with the Audiencia of\r\nHispaniola was bound to wreck his projects.\r\n\r\nHad the ability of Las Casas to direct his undertaking and to govern men\r\nbeen equal to his genius in the sphere of morals and intellect, and to the\r\neloquence of his advocacy, the realisation of his ideal of justice and\r\ncharity might have been assured.  Certainly he contended against\r\noverwhelming odds in Spain, the Bishop of Burgos, who controlled American\r\naffairs, was implacably hostile; in America the colonial authorities and\r\nthe entire population barring the friars and a possible handful of his\r\nfriends, were vigilantly opposed to him; deceived and betrayed by his\r\nSquire Berrio, he was disobeyed by De Soto and abandoned by his colonists,\r\nwhile all hope of establishing friendly relations with the Indians in the\r\nterritory conceded to him was annihilated by the Spaniards at Cubagua,\r\nwhose aggressions kept the whole country in a state of alarm. These\r\nuntoward conditions, which no foresight on his part could have avoided,\r\nwere alone sufficient to explain the failure of his enterprise.  His plans\r\nseem, however, to have involved a contradiction of a fundamental law of\r\nhuman progress which decrees the destruction of rudimentary forms of\r\ncivilisation when brought into contact with a higher one.  Neither humane\r\ncivil legislation nor the higher principles of Christian charity have thus\r\nfar served to save the weaker races of mankind from absorption or\r\nextermination.  The fiercer and stronger tribes of American Indians\r\nreceded before the Anglo-Saxon invasion of their territories, leaving a\r\ntrail of blood behind them, while the weaker nations of the islands and\r\nSouthern Americas went down before the Spaniards, with hardly more than a\r\nplaintive cry for mercy.\r\n\r\nThe price of civilisation is a high one, and as the peoples of Europe paid\r\nit, so were the aboriginal populations of America not exempted from the\r\nblood-tax.  The obscure workings of the mysterious laws of race-survival\r\nwere forced on and hastened by the cruelties against which Las Casas\r\nprotested in vain, but the triumphal march of human progress has followed\r\non.  Cannibalism, idolatry, slavery, and other barbarisms have disappeared\r\nfrom the American continents; the Christian religion has replaced\r\ndegrading superstitions, agriculture and commerce flourish, while\r\nliterature and the arts adorn life in the several republics, whose meanest\r\ncitizen enjoys a security of life and property unknown to the proudest of\r\ntheir ancestors under the rule of Montezuma or the Incas. Belief in the\r\nprinciples of equity and charity forbids us to doubt that these and even\r\nnobler results might have been achieved by the methods advocated by Las\r\nCasas, but history records no racial expansion along other roads than that\r\nopened by the sword.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. - PROFESSION OF LAS CASAS.  THE CACIQUE ENRIQUE. JOURNEYS OF\r\nLAS CASAS. A PEACEFUL VICTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough held in general detestation in Hispaniola, as a seditious\r\nmischief-maker and an enemy of the Spaniards’ interests, there were not\r\nwanting some sympathisers who, when Las Casas arrived, dejected and\r\nbankrupt, at Santo Domingo, received him kindly, and even offered to lend\r\nhim five thousand ducats with which to begin again.\r\n\r\nThe clear thinking and high resolution which had carried him through so\r\nmany trials seemed at this time to fail him; nor indeed is there just\r\ncause for wonder, for there is a limit to human powers of endurance, and\r\nif ever a man was overtaken by a dark hour, Las Casas was he.  In after\r\nyears, he arraigned his own conduct at this period with undue severity,\r\nreflecting that as the Emperor was back in Spain with the Flemings, and\r\nhis old friend Cardinal Adrian had become Pope, he might have accomplished\r\nhis life’s purpose of ending the sufferings of the Indians, had he only\r\nadopted the resolution of going directly to Spain.  As it was, he wrote an\r\nextensive account to the Emperor of all that had occurred and the causes\r\nthat had brought on the calamity at Cumaná.\r\n\r\nTo the monks of the Dominican order, Las Casas had years since been united\r\nby the strong bonds of devotion to a common cause, which was the dominant\r\ninfluence, as it was the sole object, of his life. As they had accompanied\r\nand sustained him throughout his long struggle, so it was to them that he\r\nnaturally turned for sympathy in the extremity of his disappointment,\r\nexiled, as he was, amidst the hostile colonists of Hispaniola.  These were\r\nthe saddest days of his tempestuous life, during which doubts began to\r\npenetrate his very soul—doubts of his own worthiness to carry on the\r\nmission to which he had believed himself called, doubts even as to whether\r\nit might not be ordained by the inscrutable wisdom of Divine Providence\r\nthat the Indians should perish before the advance of the Spaniards.  If\r\nthis were true, then his life had been wasted in a vain conflict with the\r\noccult forces that govern the destiny of races.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for answers to the letters he had written to Spain, he found\r\nhis only consolation in his intercourse with the Dominican friars, with\r\nwhom in fact he had been for years closely united in spirit.  Fray Domingo\r\nde Betanzos exercised a great influence upon him at this time, and to him\r\nis due the decision of Las Casas to enter the Dominican Order.\r\n\r\nThe discussions between the two must have been frequent and prolonged for,\r\nweary and disappointed as he was, Las Casas seems not to have yearned for\r\nthe seclusion of the cloister. To his objection that he must await the\r\nKing’s reply to his letter before taking a decision, Betanzos answered,\r\n“Decide now father, for if you were to die meanwhile, who will receive the\r\nKing’s letters and orders?”  These words sunk deep into his soul and from\r\nthence-forward he pondered seriously upon his vocation.  Finally his mind\r\nwas made up and he decided to imagine himself dead when the King’s letter\r\nshould arrive and so beyond the reach of royal commands.  In 1522, he\r\nasked for the habit of the Order. (39) The news of his solemn profession,\r\nwhich took place in 1523, was received with great joy by the people\r\noutside the convent, though for very different reasons, for they assisted\r\nat his exit from the world and his entrance into the cloister with the\r\nsame satisfaction with which they would have attended his funeral.  While\r\nmaking his novitiate, the letters from the Cardinal (now Pope) Adrian and\r\nhis Flemish friends at Court arrived.  The Flemings urged his immediate\r\nreturn to Spain, promising him every assistance in their power, but the\r\nsuperiors of the monastery in Hispaniola did not deliver these disquieting\r\nepistles to their novice, for fear of shaking his resolution to persevere\r\nin his vocation.\r\n\r\nThe earliest biographer of Las Casas, Antonio de Remesal, says that he was\r\nchosen Prior of the monastery, and this statement is supported by a letter\r\nfrom the Auditors of Hispaniola dated June 7, 1533, addressed to Prince\r\nPhilip who was governing Spain during the absence of the Emperor his\r\nfather, in which Fray Bartholomew is mentioned as Prior of the Monastery\r\nof Santo Domingo in the town of Puerto de Plata. (40) In chapter 146 of\r\nhis _Historia Apologetica_, he himself speaks of “conferring the habit” on\r\na novice, which he could only do if he were Prior.\r\n\r\nThe first seven years that Las Casas passed in the seclusion of his\r\nmonastery were not marked by any salient incident.  He devoted himself\r\nwith all the intensity of his nature to the practice of the austere rule\r\nof St. Dominic and became, as he himself afterwards described in writing\r\nof that period of his life, as though dead to the world, so little part\r\ndid he have in the course of events outside his cloister’s walls.  He gave\r\nmuch time to the study of theology, especially to the works of St. Thomas\r\nAquinas, the glory of the Dominican Order.  These studies served to equip\r\nhim with stores of canonical and philosophical learning which enabled him,\r\nwhen the time came, to sustain controversies with some of the most learned\r\nmen in Europe.\r\n\r\nIn the second chapter of his _Historia Apologetica_ the following sentence\r\noccurs: “Three leagues to the west of the extremity of this plain is\r\nPuerto de Plata, and on a hill above and near by the town thus named there\r\nis a monastery of the Dominican Order, where the composition of this\r\nHistory was begun in the year 1527,—to be finished when and where the will\r\nof God may ordain.”(41)\r\n\r\nIn 1529, he lent his efforts to bringing to an end the long standing\r\nrebellion of the cacique Enrique whose forces, in the mountains of\r\nBaranco, the Spaniards had fought at intervals during fourteen years in\r\nvain.  This chief had been educated in the Franciscan convent at Vera Paz\r\nand was a man of unusual intelligence and superior courage; he married a\r\nbeautiful Indian girl of good lineage and, with the Indians under his\r\nrule, was assigned in repartimiento to a Spaniard named Valenzuela, who\r\nbegan by robbing him of a valuable mare and ended by taking from him his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nThe cacique’s protests were answered with a beating, and his complaints to\r\nthe governor of St. Juan de la Maguana, one Pedro Vadillo, were\r\ndisregarded.\r\n\r\nThis grievance led to an organised rebellion of the natives under Enrique,\r\nwho assembled numerous forces.  By constantly moving from place to place,\r\nhe was able to elude the several Spanish expeditions sent against him.\r\nThe course of these alternate hostilities and negotiations to obtain the\r\nsubmission of Enrique, and the dispersal of his people, are described at\r\nlength in chapters 125 and 126 of the _Historia General_.  Even the\r\nintervention of Fray Remigio, one of the Franciscans who had come from\r\nPicardy to Hispaniola, and who had been one of Enrique’s teachers in the\r\nconvent, failed induce the offended cacique to surrender. News of the\r\ncontinued success of the rebellion reached Spain, and in 1527, Don\r\nSebastian de Fuenleal was sent out as President of the Audiencia and\r\nBishop of Santo Domingo, with special instructions to subdue Enrique.  His\r\nefforts proved as fruitless as the preceding attempts, and in 1528 the\r\nKing wrote still more urgently that the campaign must be brought to a\r\nsuccessful issue.  The Bishop-President, being in sore perplexity to\r\ndevise means for satisfying the royal commands, showed this embarrassing\r\nletter to Fray Bartholomew.\r\n\r\n“My lord,” said Las Casas, “how many times has your lordship and this\r\nAudiencia tried to subdue this man to the King’s service by waging war\r\nagainst him.”\r\n\r\n“Many times,” answered the Bishop, “almost every year a force has been\r\norganised and so it will go on till he dies or submits.”  “And how often,”\r\nasks Las Casas, “have you tried to win him by peaceful means?”  “I don’t\r\nknow that there was but the one time,” answered Fuenleal.  Fray Bartolomew\r\nthen affirmed that he was confident that he could arrange a peace and, the\r\nBishop-president having accepted his offer to act as ambassador to\r\nEnrique, he fulfilled his mission as much to the astonishment as to the\r\nsatisfaction of everybody.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish historian Quintana rejects the account of these events which\r\nis given by Remesal and has ever since been accepted by historians as\r\nauthentic, declaring it to be fabulous, and limiting the part Las Casas\r\nplayed in the affair of Enrique to a visit he paid him after peace was\r\nconcluded.  Remesal bases his narrative on documents which he declares he\r\nfound in the archives of the Audiencia of Guatemala, and there seems no\r\nsufficient motive for doubting the veracity of the evidence.  Las Casas,\r\nin describing what took place in the early part of the troubles with\r\nEnrique (1520), does not say positively that he took part in the first\r\nnegotiations for peace, but he does clearly give it to be understood that\r\nthe successful issue of the final efforts was owing to his intervention.\r\nA detailed account of the conclusion of the rebellion would, according to\r\nthe system adopted in writing his _History_, find its rightful place in\r\nthe fourth book, which is missing, though there is little room for doubt\r\nthat it was written and may possibly still be discovered.\r\n\r\nConcerning the journey which—according to Remesal—Las Casas made to Spain\r\nin 1530, very little is known, and Quintana is as sceptical about this\r\nvoyage as about the part attributed to him by some biographers in\r\nEnrique’s subjugation, though there seems as little reason in this\r\ninstance to doubt the explicit statement of one whose good faith is as far\r\nabove suspicion as his opportunities for knowing the facts were\r\nexceptional.\r\n\r\nTorquemada represents Fray Juan Zumarraga, the first Bishop of Mexico, as\r\nvisiting Spain in 1532, and as having previously written asking that the\r\ncolonists should be prohibited from enslaving the Indians, and that during\r\nthat time identical representations had been made to the government by the\r\nBishop of Chiapa, Don Bartolomé de Las Casas, (42) which procured letters\r\npatent from the Empress-Regent signed in 1530, before the bishop of Mexico\r\narrived. (43) The scepticism of Quintana seems hardly justified.\r\n\r\nThe occasion of the alleged journey was the recent discovery and conquest\r\nof Peru by Francisco Pizarro and Diego de Almagro.  The fate of these\r\nmillions of people, newly subjected to the Castilian crown could not have\r\nbeen a matter of indifference to Las Casas.  They stood far higher in the\r\nscale of civilisation than the naked islanders, possessing as they did, as\r\ngreat an empire as the Mexicans, with religion, laws, and literature of a\r\nhigh order of development.  While the entrance of Las Casas into a\r\nmonastic order was, in one sense, a retirement from the world, he had\r\nchosen a community whose members were as devoted to the defence of the\r\nIndians as he himself was, and while he had, when still a secular priest,\r\nsustained a stout fight, unaided save by such friends as chance and his\r\nown efforts might here and there secure him, he could, after his\r\nprofession, count upon the moral and active support of one of the most\r\npowerful religious organisations of the age.  His retirement, therefore,\r\nproved to be a period of refreshment, during which he reinforced his\r\npowers for continuing his propaganda and, while losing nothing of his\r\noriginal enthusiasm and determination, he returned to the scene of his\r\nformer activity with renewed courage and a great religious Order at his\r\nback.\r\n\r\nDetermined as he was to forestall a repetition in Peru of the\r\nexterminating cruelties perpetrated in the islands, he returned to Court\r\nin his Dominican habit, where he preached several times with great\r\nsuccess.  The gift of eloquence he had always possessed, and his eight\r\nyears of study and meditation had furnished him with new weapons, which he\r\nwielded with the same fiery zeal that had characterised the first years of\r\nhis apostolic championship.  During the six months he remained in Spain,\r\nhe obtained a royal cedula to be delivered to Pizarro and Almagro,\r\npositively prohibiting the enslavement of any of the natives of Peru for\r\nany reason, or in any manner whatsoever, as they were declared to be the\r\nfree vassals of the King, and as much entitled to the possession of their\r\nliberty and property as were the natives of Castile itself.  The obnoxious\r\nBishop of Burgos had long since fallen into disgrace and was dead, so that\r\nLas Casas was free to carry on his negotiations with the India Council\r\nwithout encountering at every step the obstacles and delays his old enemy\r\nhad formerly opposed to his projects.\r\n\r\nDuring his absence in Spain, the first provincial chapter of the\r\nDominicans had been held in Hispaniola, and on his return there he learned\r\nthat the monastery of San Domingo in Mexico had been designated as the\r\nchief house of the province, with Fray Francisco de San Miguel as the\r\nfirst Prior. Las Casas, in company with other friars embarked with the new\r\nPrior for Mexico, his own destination being Peru, where he had not only to\r\ndeliver the royal cedula he had secured, but also to found some convents\r\nin those regions.  The friars in Mexico did not welcome their new Prior as\r\ncordially as they might have done, but Fray Bartholomew, ever ready to\r\nexercise his powers of universal peace-maker, smoothed the difficulties,\r\nafter which he left for Peru early in 1532, accompanied by Fray Bernardino\r\nde Minaya and Fray Pedro de Angulo. (44) As their port of embarkation was\r\nRealejo in Nicaragua, they passed through Santiago de Guatemala where they\r\nlodged in the abandoned convent of San Domingo.  As soon as the news of\r\ntheir arrival spread, the whole town came eagerly to see them; the\r\nenthusiasm of the inhabitants was somewhat dampened when they learned that\r\nLas Casas was one of the three, for he had earned a terrible fame amongst\r\nslave-dealing Spaniards and whenever he appeared, was apt to produce royal\r\ncedulas of embarrassing purport or, at least, to denounce and report to\r\nSpain the violence and cruelties commonly practised on the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe friars’ stay at Santiago was brief, in spite of the urgent entreaties\r\nof the priest there, who begged them to remain and to reopen the deserted\r\nmonastery, as the field for spiritual labours was a broad and uncultivated\r\none.  Fray Bartholomew was anxious, however, to reach his destination,\r\nknowing from past experiences how much easier it is to forestall an evil\r\nthan to remedy a rooted abuse. He rightly judged that whatever good was to\r\nbe accomplished by virtue of the royal cedula he carried, must be achieved\r\nbefore the conquerors of Peru had time to enslave the Indians and to\r\nestablish a system similar to those that had worked such damage in the\r\nIslands and in Mexico.  They were obliged to wait twenty-four days at\r\nRealejo until a ship which was to carry reinforcements and stores to\r\nPizarro and Almagro was ready to sail; meanwhile the three monks, under\r\nthe exterior guise of the gentle dove, were obliged to use some of the\r\nwisdom of the serpent and to carefully conceal the nature of their\r\nmission, for otherwise the ship-owners, whose chief article of commerce\r\nwas slaves, would never have taken them on board.\r\n\r\nUpon their arrival in Peru, Las Casas immediately communicated the purport\r\nof the cedula to the Spanish commanders.  Both Almagro and Pizarro\r\nprotested that they would obey the order to the letter, though it went\r\nsorely against their interests. They ordered the royal command to be\r\nsolemnly published with the usual formalities and even added other\r\npenalties to those prescribed, for any violation of its provisions.\r\n\r\nThis part of his mission accomplished, it remained for Fray Bartholomew\r\nand his companions to take steps to found religious houses as their\r\nsuperior had ordered, but after consultation with the Bishop of those\r\nparts, Fray Vicente de Valverde, it was decided that such foundations\r\nwould be premature, since the country was only half subdued and a\r\ncontinuous state of warfare still prevailed.  Their return to Mexico was\r\ntherefore agreed upon and, together with a number of Spaniards who were\r\ndisappointed with their prospects in Peru, the three friars left for\r\nPanama whence they sailed for Realejo, where they arrived early in March\r\nof 1532.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of Nicaragua, who at that time was Don Diego Alvarez Osorio,\r\nhad been instructed by the Emperor to establish Dominican convents in his\r\ndiocese, and the arrival of the friars afforded him the first opportunity\r\nthat had presented itself to obey the royal commands.  A convent was\r\ntherefore established with the customary ceremonies at Leon, the seat of\r\nthe Bishop, and was dedicated to St. Paul.  The friars set themselves to\r\nwork to learn the language of the natives, which was not difficult for\r\nPedro de Angulo, since he already knew the Mexican tongue, whose\r\nsimilarity rendered intelligible communication with the Indians easy from\r\nthe outset.\r\n\r\nWhile engaged in the apostolic labour of teaching and converting the\r\nnatives who were eager to become Christians, Las Casas received a letter\r\nfrom the licentiate Cerrato, who had succeeded the Bishop Don Sebastian de\r\nFuenleal as President of the Audiencia in Hispaniola on the transference\r\nof the latter to Mexico, urging him to return forthwith, as his presence\r\nwas necessary for the service of God and the Emperor.  Money for the\r\nexpenses of the journey accompanied this communication, the nature of\r\nwhich left its recipient no choice but to obey, so leaving the work of\r\nconversions that had so favourably begun to the care of the friars who had\r\nreturned with him from Peru, Fray Bartholomew and Fray Pedro de Angulo set\r\nout on their long journey by way of Honduras, where a ship might be found\r\neither at the port of Trujillo or that of Caballos.\r\n\r\nUpon his arrival at Santo Domingo, where he was cordially received by the\r\nPresident, Cerrato though his presence was never a source of tranquillity\r\nto the slave-dealing colonists, Las Casas learned that the principal\r\nreason for recalling him, was the President’s desire to establish a surer\r\npeace with the cacique Enrique; although the latter had made no attack on\r\nthe Spaniards since the agreement of 1529, he had not disbanded his\r\nfollowers, but remained in an inaccessible mountain fastness, a permanent\r\nsource of unrest to the Spaniards with whom he showed no intention of\r\nentering into closer relations.\r\n\r\nNo mission could have been more to Fray Bartholomew’s liking, for he was\r\never eager to prove the truth of his perpetual thesis that the Indians\r\nwere reasonable, peaceable people who, if treated humanely would readily\r\nembrace civilisation and Christianity.  Making his usual condition that no\r\nforce should be used, and accompanied only by his faithful companion, Fray\r\nPedro de Angulo, he set out for the mountain regions to search for\r\nEnrique.  After several days of fatiguing wanderings he came upon the\r\ncacique, as well entrenched and with as many precautions against a\r\npossible attack or surprise as though he were engaged in active warfare\r\ninstead of being at peace since four years. For some time, during which\r\nthe two Dominicans remained as guests in the camp, no news of them reached\r\nSanto Domingo, so that the President and the colonists began to feel great\r\nuneasiness for their safety.  Two months of absolute silence elapsed when,\r\nto the stupefaction of the colony, Las Casas appeared at the entrance of\r\nthe Audiencia in company with the formidable cacique.  During fourteen\r\nyears this Indian chieftain had been the terror of the Islands, invincible\r\nand intractable; the triumph of Las Casas was correspondingly great when,\r\nby the force of his reasoning, he led him peacefully into the Spanish\r\ncapital.  Great was the ovation that greeted this signal success of the\r\nunpopular Dominican; the President fulfilled to the letter all the\r\npromises and assurances which Las Casas had given Enrique in the Emperor’s\r\nname, so that from their most obstinate enemy, this cacique became the\r\nmost loyal friend of the Spaniards. (45) Perhaps no accomplishment in his\r\nlong life of great achievements and great disappointments afforded him\r\nmore unalloyed pleasure than this pacific victory.\r\n\r\nThe centre of Fray Bartholomew’s action was now transferred to Peru, where\r\nhe was bent upon keeping a watchful eye on the execution of the royal\r\ncommands for the protection of the Indians, which he had been instrumental\r\nin procuring. There, it seemed still possible to bar out slavery in all\r\nits forms, so he solicited the Dominican superiors in Hispaniola four\r\nfriars to accompany him and found religious houses in Peru.  Amongst these\r\nfour was Fray Luis Cancer, whose name was destined to be written in the\r\nlist of the proto-martyrs of the Catholic Church in America.\r\n\r\nThe President Cerrato, out of gratitude to Las Casas, made all the\r\nprovision for the return journey and the five friars set out, probably by\r\nthe same road by which Las Casas had come.  In 1534, he was in Nicaragua,\r\nwhere he left three of his companions in the convent of St. Paul at\r\nSantiago, while he and Fray Luis Cancer and Fray Pedro de Angulo continued\r\non their way to Peru. Embarking at the port of Realejo on board a small\r\nvessel, they were overtaken by a furious storm and such continued bad\r\nweather that, after many days of misery and danger, the ship was obliged\r\nto put back, and they found themselves again at their port of embarkation.\r\n\r\nTheir journey to Peru being thus frustrated, the friars returned to their\r\nconvent at Leon where, in the early days of 1534, a letter reached Las\r\nCasas from Don Francisco Marroquin, who had recently been appointed Bishop\r\nof Guatemala after the renunciation of Fray Domingo de Betanzos.  His\r\ndiocese was vast but its clergy consisted of himself and one priest, and\r\nin his letter he entreated Fray Bartholomew, since his journey to Peru had\r\nbeen abandoned and the diocese of Nicaragua was reasonably provided with\r\npriests, to come with his companions to Guatemala, where there was a great\r\nfield open for apostolic work and no labourers to occupy it.  Las Casas at\r\nonce responded to this invitation and in Santiago de los Caballeros, the\r\ntrio of Dominicans established their convent, being joined somewhat later\r\nby Fray Rodrigo de Ladrada who came thither from Peru.\r\n\r\nThe first essential was to learn the Guatemalan language in order to\r\npreach and catechise the Indians, and this was the more easily\r\naccomplished because the Bishop Marroquin was already master of it, and\r\nundertook their instruction. It was this same bishop who published in\r\nMexico in 1556, a catechism of Christian Doctrine in the Utlateca tongue,\r\ncommonly called Quiché, a little book which has become extremely rare and\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. - THE LAND OF WAR.  BULL OF PAUL III.  LAS CASAS IN SPAIN.\r\nTHE NEW LAWS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next few years passed in successful missionary work, without offering\r\nany events of particular interest in the life of Las Casas.  During this\r\nperiod he composed his work, _De Unico modo vocationis_, in which he\r\nargued that Divine Providence had instituted only one way of converting\r\nsouls, viz., convince the intelligence by reasoning and win the heart by\r\ngentleness. (46) The ground principle of all his teaching was unalterably\r\nthe same, and he eloquently insisted upon his doctrine of peace and kind\r\ntreatment of the Indians, whom he never ceased to declare were reasonable\r\npeople of unspoiled nature, who were to be converted by gentleness and\r\njustice—not by brutality and oppression.  His theories provoked the same\r\nridicule and opposition in Guatemala as elsewhere, though there was not\r\nthe same bitterness of feeling towards him as existed in the Islands.\r\n\r\nThe heads of the Spanish colony in Guatemala even challenged him to put\r\nhis theories into practice, saying that if he succeeded in subduing any\r\ntribes, they would admit that they had been unjust, and would abandon\r\ntheir opposition and liberate their slaves.  This challenge Las Casas at\r\nonce accepted, and selected for the field of his undertaking the mountains\r\nof the province of Tuzulatlan, inhabited by a warlike people, whom the\r\nSpaniards had never been able to conquer, partly on account of the\r\ndifficult nature of the country, and partly on account of the skill and\r\ncourage of the inhabitants in defending themselves.  Besides the bare\r\nnecessaries for his support, Las Casas only asked that the conditions\r\nexpressed in the following agreement bearing the Governor’s signature\r\nshould be scrupulously observed. The act was thus worded:\r\n\r\n“By these presents I promise and give my word in the name and on behalf of\r\nhis Majesty and by the royal power which I hold that should you, or anyone\r\nof your religious here present, to wit, Fray Bartholomew de Las Casas,\r\nFray Rodrigo de Ladrada, and Fray Pedro de Angulo, by your efforts and\r\ncare, bring any provinces or Indians of them, which may be all or partly\r\nwithin my jurisdiction which I exercise for his Majesty, to peaceably\r\nrecognise his Majesty as sovereign and to pay a tribute according as their\r\nmeans and property may permit either of gold, if it exists in their\r\ncountry, or of cotton, maize, or any other product which they possess and\r\nuse for trade amongst themselves, I will, by virtue of his Majesty’s\r\nauthority, recognise all such and their provinces in his Royal name and\r\npresent them to his Majesty that they may serve him as his vassals; nor\r\nwill I give them to any one, nor shall they be given in encomienda to any\r\nSpaniard either now or at any time.  I will command that no Spaniard shall\r\nmolest them nor enter their country, under grave penalties, for a period\r\nof five years, that they may not disturb them or hinder your preaching and\r\ntheir conversion, unless I should myself go personally when it may seem\r\ngood to you and when you may accompany me; for in this matter I desire to\r\nfulfil the will of God and of his Majesty and to aid you as far as I\r\npossibly can to win the natives of this province to the knowledge of God\r\nand the service of his Majesty, etc.”\r\n\r\nProvided with this official guarantee, the friars began to carefully study\r\nthe best means for approaching the Indians of Tuzulatlan and after much\r\nreflection, they hit upon a plan as simple as it was ingenious.  They\r\ncomposed couplets in the Quiche tongue, in which were recited the creation\r\nof the world and the story of Eden; man’s fallen state and need of\r\nredemption; the birth and miracles of Our Lord and finally His death upon\r\nthe Cross.  These verses were very much after the style of the text of the\r\nmiracle-plays which were so popular throughout Europe in the Middle Ages,\r\nand as they contained the entire epitome of the Christian religion, the\r\nIndians, by merely listening to the chanting of them, would catch the\r\nrhythm by ear, and the sense of the doctrines might be trusted to\r\npenetrate their understanding, once their attention had been secured.\r\n\r\nSelecting four Christianised Indians who plied their trade as itinerant\r\nmerchants between the country of Zacapula and the Quiché tribes, whom they\r\nthought qualified to play the part, the friars carefully taught them the\r\nverses. The Indian’s memory is as tenacious as his faculty for learning by\r\nrote is quick, and as the rhymes were graceful and the subject matter both\r\ndramatic and mysterious, the four traders quickly learned to chant them in\r\nchorus, accompanied by several Indian musical instruments.  Some time was\r\nnecessarily consumed in these preparations and it was August of 1537\r\nbefore the friars were ready to send forth their apostolic troubadours.\r\nThe news of their conditions and agreement with the governor reached\r\nMexico, where the Bishop Marroquin had gone for his consecration, and met\r\nwith approval both from the Dominican superiors there and the Governor of\r\nthe Audiencia.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the usual stock of merchandise which the traders carried,\r\nLas Casas supplied them with a number of such Spanish trifles as most\r\npleased the Indians and instructed them to go first to the house of the\r\nprincipal cacique (47) of the Quiché, who was a warlike chief of great\r\nauthority, and to do nothing without first consulting him and receiving\r\nhis approval. To ensure them a good welcome, some special presents adapted\r\nto his probable fancy were to be offered him.\r\n\r\nThe traders obeyed their instructions to the letter, and after offering\r\ntheir gifts, which delighted the cacique, they opened their wares to the\r\npublic.  Their Castilian merchandise added immensely to the attraction of\r\ntheir market and drew a larger number, between buyers and curious people,\r\nthan usual. When the day’s business was over, they called for some musical\r\ninstruments—the templanaste—and taking out their own castanets and\r\ntimbrels, they began to chant the couplets.\r\n\r\nSuch music had never before been heard in the Quiche land, but if the form\r\nattracted their attention, the words of the verses made a still deeper\r\nimpression on the listeners, and most of all on the cacique himself.  The\r\nnext day, when the fair was over, he asked the traders to sing again the\r\nwonderful story and, as the news of the previous day’s performance had\r\nspread amongst the people, a still larger crowd had assembled to listen.\r\nWhen the singing had finished, the cacique asked the traders for\r\nexplanations concerning the sense of their song but they, acting on Las\r\nCasas’s instructions, replied that they only knew what they sang and to\r\nlearn more he would have to send for certain friars who would be very glad\r\nto come and tell him everything concerning the mysteries of the verses.\r\nThis gave the traders an opportunity to describe the friars who, they\r\nsaid, wore white robes covered with black mantles and had their hair cut\r\nin the form of a crown around the head; they told of the extreme frugality\r\nof their lives, their severe penances, and that their only occupation was\r\nto instruct people, for they despised gold and were indifferent to\r\npersonal possessions.  The cacique marvelled not a little to hear of this\r\nnew variety of Spaniard, so contrary in habits and manners to the others,\r\nof whom his knowledge had led him to form the poorest opinion. He\r\nconceived an earnest wish to see these strangers and arranged with the\r\ntraders that his brother, a young man of twenty-two, should return with\r\nthem to Santiago and see for himself if what they said was true.  He\r\ncharged his brother to observe carefully and secretly the ways of the\r\nfriars and to learn all he could about them and meanwhile, in return for\r\nthe gifts of Las Casas, he sent him a number of the most valuable things\r\nhis country produced.\r\n\r\nThe anxiety of the friars during all this time as to the result of their\r\nfirst effort must have been keen, and hence the satisfaction with which\r\nthey welcomed the return of the traders and their distinguished companion\r\namounted to jubilation; still more was the significance of the present,\r\nthough its actual value or usefulness to the recipients was probably\r\nsmall, but most important of all was the invitation from the cacique to\r\nvisit his country.\r\n\r\nWhile the young chieftain was busy observing the life of the convent and\r\nsatisfying himself that the descriptions given by the traders were\r\naccurate, the friars had chosen Fray Luis Cancer(48) as their first envoy\r\nto his brother.  Provided with more gifts for the cacique, he set out, the\r\nonly Christian amidst the Indians who followed in the train of the Quiché\r\nchief, to penetrate into the unknown country, whose turbulent reputation\r\nhad earned it the sombre name amongst the Spaniards of Tierra de\r\nGuerra—land of war,—for it was never at peace.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had they crossed the Quiché frontier than everywhere the people\r\ncame out to see the wonderful guest, making his arrival a veritable\r\nfestival; arches were erected for him to pass under the very roads were\r\nswept before his footsteps and his entrance into the cacique’s own town\r\nwas a triumph.  A church was at once built for him, and at the celebration\r\nof the first mass, the cacique assisted in absorbed wonder, while the\r\ndignity and Solemnity of the ceremonies and the beauty of the sacerdotal\r\nvestments impressed him by their favourable contrast to the repugnant\r\nrites and filthy robes of the priests of his own religion.  Fray Luis\r\nspoke the Quiché language with fluency, and during several days he gave\r\ninstructions and explanations, which resulted in the cacique’s conversion;\r\nthat of the others followed as a matter of course.  The friar had brought\r\nwith him the contract signed by the Governor, and he explained its\r\nconditions and importance very fully; this document was a more valuable\r\ninstrument of conversion than would have been an authentic manuscript\r\nepistle of St. Paul.  The cacique’s conversion was complete, and with his\r\nown hands he overthrew the national idols, and began, with all the zeal of\r\na convert, to preach Christian doctrine to his people.  The propaganda so\r\nactively undertaken by this unexpected assistant left Fray Luis free to\r\nvisit some neighbouring regions, in all of which he was hospitably\r\nreceived and concerning whose inhabitants he made a most encouraging\r\nreport on his return to Santiago, where, as may be imagined, his\r\ncompanions received him with the greatest joy.\r\n\r\nAs the rainy season was over at the end of October, the moment for\r\nvisiting Tuzulatlan was favourable, and Las Casas determined to go himself\r\nand visit the newly converted cacique.  It was December when he and Fray\r\nPedro de Angulo arrived in the Quiche country, where the cacique, who\r\nsince his baptism was known as Don Juan, showed them the same hospitality\r\nas he had to Fray Luis.  While some of the Indians received them as\r\nmessengers bringing glad tidings, there were others who cast epicurean\r\nglances upon them and decided that they would taste well served with a\r\nsauce of chili. (49)\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the new religion had not been effected without\r\nopposition and the Indians of Coban had even burned the first church.\r\nAnother was soon built, however, in which the two friars said mass daily,\r\npreaching afterwards in the open air to immense assemblies of people.\r\n\r\nDon Juan was at first unwilling that the friars should penetrate farther\r\ninto the country, fearing that some of the people, who adhered to the old\r\ncustoms and were hostile to the Spaniards might attack them, but he\r\nfinally withdrew his objections and formed a guard of his bravest\r\nwarriors, to whom he confided the safety of his guests.  Thus escorted,\r\nthey traversed all the provinces of Tuzulatlan and Coban where, contrary\r\nto the cacique’s apprehensions, they encountered only the most friendly\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture a Bull of Paul III. (Farnese) which was designed to put\r\nan end to further disputes concerning the status of the Indians, by\r\ndefining their rights once for all, arrived in America. (50)\r\n\r\nThis Bull was issued in reply to letters sent to the Pope by the Bishop of\r\nTlascala, begging his Holiness to decide the vexed question of the status\r\nof the Indians, and was based on the Scriptural text _Euntes docete omnes\r\ngentes_.  The Pope declared the Indians to be rational beings, possessed\r\nof liberty and free-will and therefore susceptible to receive the gospel,\r\nwhich must be preached to them in obedience to the divine commands.  He\r\ncondemned in severe terms those who enslaved the Indians and pretended to\r\ndeny their capacity to become Christians.  A pontifical brief was at the\r\nsame time addressed to the Cardinal-Archbishop of Toledo, confirming the\r\nsense of the Bull and commending the Emperor’s condemnation of slavery in\r\nhis American possessions.\r\n\r\n                        [Illustration: Paul III..]\r\n\r\n                                Paul III.\r\n\r\n   From an engraving by Vincenzo Crispino after the portrait by Titian.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe satisfaction of Las Casas with this authoritative pronouncement from\r\nthe supreme head of Christendom may be easily imagined, for it reads not\r\nunlike some of his own compositions.  He translated the Latin text into\r\nSpanish and supplied copies to all the governors and chief persons in\r\nthose colonies, so that the decision and commands of the Pontiff might be\r\nperfectly understood by every one.\r\n\r\nTo one of his projects for civilising and converting the Indians more\r\nrapidly, the cacique was very reluctant to agree; this was that they\r\nshould quit their semi-nomadic life and their custom of living in small\r\nscattered groups throughout the country, and come together in towns and\r\nvillages.  They were so much attached to the independence and freedom of\r\ntheir mountains, that it was easier for the natives to renounce their\r\nreligion, to which indeed they seemed to have little attachment, than to\r\nabandon the ancient customs of their race.  Their resistance to this\r\ninnovation risked losing all that had been accomplished, for they were\r\nprepared rather to fight than to yield on this point.  By his quiet\r\npersistence, however, Las Casas succeeded in starting a village of one\r\nhundred houses at a place called Rabinal, whose familiar name he wisely\r\nrefrained from changing, and little by little, even the natives of Coban,\r\nwho were the least amenable, were attracted by the novelty, and came to\r\ninspect the new system, with which those who had adopted it were\r\ndelighted, as they could thus hear mass every day and enjoy the discourses\r\nand conversation of the friars, of which they seem never to have tired.\r\nFray Luis now joined Las Casas at Rabinal, from whence he repeated his\r\nformer visits to various places through-out the neighbouring country.  The\r\nfriars were obliged to learn the language or dialect of Coban in order to\r\nenter into relations with its people, the most savage of all the tribes in\r\nthose parts.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop Marroquin had meanwhile returned from Mexico and Pedro de\r\nAlvarado, the captain, who distinguished himself during the conquest of\r\nMexico by his rashness and cruelties, was now the lieutenant of the\r\nEmperor in Guatemala, and to these authorities Las Casas wished to render\r\nan account of what had been accomplished.  To give a more striking proof\r\nof the condition of things in Tuzulatlan, he wished very much to have Don\r\nJuan accompany him, remembering no doubt, the impression the appearance of\r\nthe cacique Enrique had produced in Santo Domingo.  The project suited the\r\ncacique perfectly, and he began to make arrangements for his journey,\r\nplanning to go in considerable pomp with a numerous following of warriors.\r\nTo this Las Casas objected, foreseeing the difficulty he would have in\r\nkeeping such a large number from too familiar contact with Spaniards, from\r\nwhich quarrels and troubles would inevitably ensue.  He succeeded in\r\nconvincing Don Juan that such a display was unnecessary, and sent notice\r\nof the approaching visit to Guatemala, where Father Ladrada built more\r\nrooms onto the convent for the reception of the guests and laid in an\r\nextra supply of provisions to regale them.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop, without waiting for a visit from the cacique upon his arrival,\r\nwent at once to the convent to see him and, as he spoke the Guatemalan\r\ntongue, they talked together, not only on general subjects but also on\r\nmatters of faith, the Bishop marvelling greatly at the degree of Don\r\nJuan’s instruction and the maturity and gravity of his judgment.  Indeed,\r\nso impressed was he by the exceptional dignity of the cacique that he\r\nbegged the Adelantado to go and see him.  Pedro de Alvarado had had much\r\nexperience of Indians and was one of the cruellest of Spanish commanders\r\nin America, holding the life of an Indian in no more consideration than\r\nthat of a dog, yet even he was so favourably attracted by Don Juan’s\r\nappearance and manners that, wishing in some way to honour him and having\r\nnothing at hand to give him, he took off his own red velvet hat and placed\r\nit on the cacique’s head.  His followers murmured somewhat at this\r\ndemonstration, which they considered excessive, but Don Juan was radiant\r\nin his magnificent headgear.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate Don Juan’s visit, an inspection of the town was planned, so\r\nthat he might see how the Spaniards lived; the Bishop and the Aldelantado\r\nsent word beforehand to all the merchants to dress their shops with the\r\nbest things they had, stuffs, jewelry, plate, etc., and if the cacique\r\nshould show a fancy for anything, it should immediately be given to him\r\nand the account sent to the Bishop.  This was doing things in a really\r\nroyal fashion, and one regrets to have to relate that the cacique walked\r\nwith great gravity and dignity—as much as though he had been born in\r\nBurgos, says Remesal—amidst the brave display, without manifesting any\r\nsurprise or wish to possess anything he saw, refusing also to accept the\r\ndifferent articles which were offered to him.  The only object about which\r\nhe seems to have asked a question was a statue of the Blessed Virgin, and\r\nwhen he heard the Bishop repeat the story of the Mother of Christ, just as\r\nthe friars had first sung it in his mountain home, he knelt down to\r\nreceive the image from his hands, with great veneration, and afterwards\r\ndelivered it to one of his attendants, cautioning him to carry it with the\r\ngreatest care and reverence.\r\n\r\nThe visit fortunately passed off without any friction between the\r\nSpaniards and the followers of Don Juan, and at its close, Las Casas and\r\nFray Rodrigo de Ladrada accompanied the cacique back to his country,\r\nintending to penetrate still farther into the interior of Coban where the\r\nnatives were but little known to white men.  Two caciques, whose names as\r\nChristians were Don Miguel and Don Pedro and whose tribes were near to\r\nRabinal, rendered much help in carrying out this plan, and so well did\r\neverything promise, that the two friars would have remained in the\r\ncountries of Tuzulatlan and Coban to prosecute their missionary labours,\r\nbut for a summons from their companions in Guatemala recalling them\r\nthither in May of 1538.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop Marroquin, who had prompted the summons, assembled the\r\ncommunity and explained that the urgent need of more clergy in his diocese\r\nhad decided him to send some of them to Spain to induce other friars of\r\ntheir own and the Franciscan Order to come to his assistance.  The choice\r\nof the envoy for this mission not unnaturally fell upon Las Casas, for he\r\nhad often made the journey, was well acquainted in Spain, where he had\r\nmany and powerful friends, and was well versed in the ways of the court.\r\nFray Rodrigo went as his companion, and before quitting Guatemala, he went\r\nto take leave of the cacique Don Juan, who was much dejected at the\r\ndeparture of his friends.\r\n\r\nThe two travellers repaired first to Mexico, where a chapter of the\r\nDominican Order was held on August 24, 1539, in which Pedro de Angulo was\r\nnamed prior of the convent in Guatemala, and Fray Luis Cancer was\r\ndesignated to accompany Las Casas and Ladrada to Spain.  During his stay\r\nin Mexico, Las Casas saw the Viceroy, Don Antonio de Mendoza, who was\r\ninclined to share the view that humane treatment of the natives promised\r\nbetter results than violence, and willingly combined with him for several\r\npeaceful missions to distant provinces in the north-west of Mexico.\r\n\r\nCharles V. was absent from Madrid when Las Casas and his companions\r\narrived but the former was welcomed by many old friends and set about his\r\nbusiness with the activity and perspicacity which marked his treatment of\r\naffairs.  Since the death of the Bishop of Burgos, another and a better\r\nspirit breathed in the Council, and there was a more sincere and\r\nconsistent effort to give full effect to the royal decrees in favour of\r\nthe Indians.  To this, the Bull of Paul III. had doubtless in no small\r\nmeasure contributed, for it was obviously impossible after such an\r\nauthoritative pronouncement to continue along the old lines, treating the\r\nnatives like chattels and affecting to deny them souls.  The Council\r\naccorded a number of beneficial provisions in response to Las Casas’s\r\nrepresentations. The pact entered into with the Governor, which guaranteed\r\nthe independence of the cacique of Tuzulatlan and his people, was ratified\r\nby the Council, and letters were written in the King’s name to several of\r\nthe converted caciques; one of these new provisions ordered that the\r\nIndians should be taught music and that musical instruments should be\r\nfurnished them from Spain.  Fray Bartholomew was equally successful in\r\nfinding a number of friars for the diocese of Guatemala, and on January\r\n21, 1541, Fray Luis Cancer sailed with a number of Franciscans on the\r\nreturn journey.  Las Casas and the Dominicans remained behind by command\r\nof Cardinal Loaysa, who intimated that the former’s presence would be\r\nnecessary later, for important matters, of which he would learn in due\r\ntime.  Before the departure of the Franciscans, the royal orders\r\nconcerning the welfare of the Indians were proclaimed from the steps of\r\nthe Cathedral of Seville in the presence of a large concourse of people.\r\n\r\nCardinal Loaysa, who occupied the metropolitan see of Seville,\r\ncontemplated making important changes in the code of laws that governed\r\nthe Indies, and his desire to consult Las Casas before framing his new\r\nsystem rendered it necessary that the latter should remain in Spain.  In\r\nthe following year, 1542, the Nuevas Leyes, or New Laws, as they were\r\ntermed, were drawn up, and although there is no direct evidence to prove\r\nthat they were drafted by Las Casas, there is little doubt that many of\r\ntheir most salutary articles were due to his influence and suggestions.\r\nThe usual method of assembling councils composed of theologians,\r\ncanonists, lawyers, and men who had had much experience in the colonies,\r\nwas likewise followed at this time, and in their meetings the several\r\nquestions concerning the system of government best adapted to the Indians,\r\nthe most promising means for converting and civilizing them, and the\r\nmeasures required to correct and eliminate the abuses under which they\r\nsuffered, were exhaustively discussed.  The verbal debates were\r\nsupplemented by the presentation of facts and arguments in support of\r\ndifferent theories, drawn up in writing.  In a council held by the\r\nEmperor’s command at Valladolid in 1542, Las Casas presented one such\r\nlengthy memorial, in which he enumerated the different remedies which he\r\nmaintained were indispensable if his Majesty would provide for the relief\r\nof his Indian vassals.  The number of the remedies proposed in this\r\ndocument is given by Las Casas himself as sixteen, but of these only the\r\neighth is known to be in existence.  Probably it contained the substance\r\nof his thesis, which, like most papers of the time, must have been very\r\nwordy and discursive.  The eighth remedy was afterwards published at\r\nSeville in 1552 with twenty reasons in support of it.\r\n\r\nLas Casas’s habitual activity was in no way diminished, and he exercised\r\nas great energy in winning adherents to his cause as he did foresight in\r\ncombating opposition to it.  Copies of his memorial were distributed to\r\nall the important men whose opinions might influence the tenor of the new\r\nlaws and the spirit of their application, including the members of the\r\ncouncil in Valladolid, especially Cardinal Loaysa, who was President of\r\nthe India Council, Don Ramirez de Fuenleal, who had been transferred from\r\nthe presidency of the audiencia of Mexico to the bishopric of Cuenca, Don\r\nJuan de Zuñiga, Grand Commander of Castile, the Secretary, Francisco de\r\nlos Cobos, and all the others who had been appointed to act as judges in\r\nthis affair.  These men held meetings in the house of Pedro Gonzalez de\r\nLeon and the outcome of their deliberations was the formation of the\r\nfamous code of Nuevas Leyes.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the articles of this code might have been drafted word for word\r\nby Las Casas himself so entirely do they bear the impress of his opinions:\r\n\r\n“Item. We ordain and command that from now and henceforth no Indian may be\r\nenslaved because he has fought, nor for any other reason, whether because\r\nof rebellion, or for purposes of ransom, nor in any other way, and we\r\ndesire that they shall be treated as our vassals of the Crown of Castile,\r\nfor such they are.”\r\n\r\n“No one may press the Indians into service by way of naboria or tapia(51)\r\nnor in any other manner against their will.  And since we have ordered\r\nthat from henceforth the Indians shall not be made slaves, we likewise\r\nordain and command that in the case of such as have been heretofore\r\nenslaved contrary to right and justice, the Audiencias shall summon the\r\nparties, and without process of law, but promptly and briefly upon the\r\ntruth being known, shall liberate them.  Nor may the Indians be unjustly\r\nenslaved in default of persons to solicit the aforesaid [procedure]; we\r\ncommand that the Audiencia shall appoint persons who may pursue this cause\r\nfor the Indians and that such persons shall be conscientious and diligent\r\nmen and shall be paid out of the fines of the Exchequer.”\r\n\r\nNeither the spirit nor the provisions of these laws differ from those of\r\nthe various ordinances and cedulas which the Spanish sovereigns from the\r\nreign of Isabella the Catholic had from time to time promulgated.  So true\r\nis the saying of Dr. Johnson that wisdom may make laws but it requires\r\nvirtue to execute them.  The Spanish sovereigns were more humane than\r\ntheir subjects, but the latter were ready with expedients for evading laws\r\nwhose execution would have hindered their avaricious undertakings in the\r\ndistant colonies, while venal officials lent their connivance to these\r\nviolations, instead of administering the laws in the spirit in which their\r\nauthors had conceived them.  The statute books of the worst despotisms are\r\nadorned with the wisest and most liberal ordinances.  From the iradés of\r\nthe Ottoman Sultans and ukases of the Russian Tsars, those empires might\r\nbe easily shown to possess ideal systems of government, under whose\r\nenlightened and beneficent sway happy and prosperous peoples have enjoyed\r\nthe delights of religious and political liberty.\r\n\r\nThe most important article of the New Laws concerning the encomienda\r\nsystem provided as follows:\r\n\r\n“Furthermore we ordain and command that from now and henceforth no\r\nViceroy, Governor, Audiencia, discoverer, or any other persons whatsoever\r\nshall allot Indians in encomienda, neither by new provision or\r\nresignation, donation, sale, nor in any other form or manner; neither by\r\nvacancies, nor inheritance, but, that on the death of any person holding\r\nthe said Indians, they shall revert to our royal Crown.  Let the\r\nAudiencias take means to be immediately and particularly informed\r\nconcerning the deceased person, his rank, merits, services, and his\r\ntreatment of his Indians and whether there is a widow or children; they\r\nshall send us a report on the condition of the Indians and of the property\r\nthat we may order what may be best for our service and may make such\r\nprovision as may seem good to us for the widow and children of the\r\ndeceased. Should the Audiencia meanwhile perceive a need to provide for\r\nsuch widow and children, they may do this out of the tribute paid by the\r\nsaid Indians, giving them a moderate amount for these Indians are under\r\nour Crown, as stated.”\r\n\r\nThis article provided for the gradual and total extinction of slavery,\r\nwith due regard to the interests of the colonists, and though it did not\r\nmeet the wishes of Las Casas for the immediate and absolute correction of\r\nthe prevailing abuses, its strict application promised to produce more\r\nslowly, the results which he sought.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of November, 1542, Charles V. signed the Nuevas Leyes of\r\nValladolid, in the city of Barcelona, and their publication immediately\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nLas Casas was in Valencia at this time and it was there that he finished\r\nthe best known of all his writings, which was first printed in 1552 under\r\nthe title _Brevissima Relacion de la Destruycion de la Indias_, and bore a\r\ndedication to Philip II. (52) This little book, as the reader may see from\r\nthe translation of it given at the close of this volume, is a veritable\r\ncatalogue of horrors.  Man’s invention has its limits, and the ways of\r\ntorturing the human body are numbered, hence, as the descriptions of the\r\nvarious scenes of brutality repeat themselves over and over in the same\r\nlanguage, they end by becoming wearisome.  The book was speedily\r\ntranslated into various European languages and its dissemination aroused a\r\ntempest of indignation against the Spanish colonial system in America.\r\nIts contents were made to serve in the religious and political\r\ncontroversies of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and Las Casas was\r\ncited as a witness both against his Church and his country.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that every incident that Las Casas relates as coming\r\nwithin his own knowledge and observation is true, though Prescott\r\ndescribes “the good Bishop’s arithmetic as coming from the heart than from\r\nthe head” and historians generally have been inclined to doubt his\r\nfigures.  His description of the mild and friendly character of the\r\nnatives of the islands was doubtless exact, but when he extends it to\r\ninclude the fierce and warlike tribes of the mainland, his generalisations\r\nare seen to be misleading.  None of the peoples of Anáhuac could be\r\ntruthfully described as “gentle lambs” or as “humble, submissive, and\r\ndocile, knowing no evil and neither possessing nor understanding the use\r\nof weapons.”  Slavery was everywhere established, with its attendant\r\nabuses and evils, and it was slavery that Las Casas combated.   It must be\r\nborne in mind that Las Casas was a man in whom humanitarianism\r\novershadowed every other sentiment, that he was of an ardent,\r\nimpressionable and imaginative temperament, with sensibilities of the most\r\ndelicate sort; moreover, he was an apostle, the defender of an oppressed\r\npeople, whom he had taken under his protection and whose cause it was the\r\nmission of his life to sustain and defend.   The violation of divine and\r\nhuman justice had been erected into a system by the conquerors and\r\ndiscoverers and nothing, in his eyes, could palliate the evils which that\r\nsystem fostered, and by which the colonists prospered, while the native\r\nraces were dwindling to extinction.  Beyond these primary facts, he\r\nrefused to see; of them, he had seen more than enough to inflame his\r\nindignation and start him upon the crusade for which his iron\r\nconstitution, his superior intellectual powers, and his resistless\r\neloquence were alone adequate.  He was frequently betrayed into invective,\r\nand his denunciations are as fierce as language could make them, while the\r\nenergetic terms in which he depicts, in all their bald horror, the\r\nrevolting inhumanity of his countrymen provoke a shudder.  The Brevissima\r\nRelacion is not literature for sensitive readers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. - THE BISHOPRICS OFFERED TO LAS CASAS. HIS CONSECRATION. HIS\r\nDEPARTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nCopies of the New Laws, accompanied by a royal letters of instruction,\r\nwere sent, not only to the viceroys, governors, and Audiencias in America,\r\nbut also to the priors of the different convents, so that the knowledge of\r\ntheir provisions might be as widely diffused as possible and the vigilance\r\nof the friars excited to see that they were obeyed both in the letter and\r\nthe spirit.  Las Casas went from Valencia to Barcelona to thank the\r\nEmperor, and while there, the royal secretary, Francisco de los Cobos,\r\nwaited on him one Sunday afternoon, bearing his appointment by the Emperor\r\nto the newly erected bishopric of Cuzco, which, for extent of territory,\r\nnumber of inhabitants, and vast resources, was the richest in the New\r\nWorld.  Such a recognition from the sovereign could not be otherwise than\r\nwelcome to Las Casas, who was perhaps the most abused man of his time both\r\nin America and Spain, but his determination not to accept the dignity was\r\npositive, though veiled at the outset under the plea that, being a\r\nDominican and bound by the rule of obedience, he could not receive the\r\nroyal nomination without the previous consent of his superiors.\r\n\r\nRegard for consistency was, however, the principal motive of his refusal,\r\nfor he had protested before the Emperor and all men, in 1519, that his\r\nlabours in favour of the Indians were actuated solely by the desire to\r\nadvance God’s service by effecting their conversion: for all his hardships\r\nand sufferings, he neither expected nor desired any recompense, and he\r\nformally renounced in anticipation all and any honours or rewards the\r\nEmperor might think of offering him. (53) His resolution to abide by that\r\ndeclaration being unalterable, he left Barcelona to escape possible\r\npressure, and the desirable bishopric passed to another Dominican, Fray\r\nJuan Solano.\r\n\r\nThe designation of Las Casas for the bishopric was made by Cardinal Loaysa\r\nand the other members of the India Council and, nothing daunted by his\r\nrefusal, they insisted that some one of the newly founded bishoprics in\r\nAmerica should be governed by the man who, of all others, possessed the\r\nhighest qualifications, the most thorough knowledge of those countries,\r\nand the sincerest interest in apostolic work amongst the natives.  The\r\nfirst bishop of the diocese of Chiapa having just died, he was designated\r\nfor the vacancy, and this time he was constrained by the arguments of\r\npersons of influence, notably the director of the College of San Gregorio\r\nin Valladolid, to put aside his scruples and to accept a position in which\r\nhe could most benefit his beloved Indians.\r\n\r\nThat the diocese of Chiapa was the poorest in the new World, and so barren\r\nof revenues that a subsidy was furnished by the Emperor to enable the\r\nBishop to live at all, contributed perhaps as much as anything to\r\nreconcile Las Casas to his new dignity. (54) He repaired to Toledo and\r\nappeared before the chapter of his Order which was being held there, to\r\nask that some monks should be furnished him for his new diocese.\r\n\r\nLas Casas was preconised in Rome on the feast of Pentecost, 1542, after\r\nwhich a whole year elapsed before the necessary bulls reached Spain and\r\nthe friars who were to accompany him were chosen.  After arranging for the\r\nreunion of these friars, he set out for Seville, where, on the 30th of\r\nMarch, 1544, he was consecrated bishop in the chapel of the Dominican\r\nmonastery of St. Paul by Bishop Loaysa, nephew of the cardinal of the same\r\nname, assisted by the Bishops of Cordoba and Trujillo in Honduras. On the\r\n21st of March, the newly consecrated Bishop wrote the following letter to\r\nthe India Council:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVERY HIGH AND POTENT LORDS: after we left the Court on Tuesday the 4th of\r\nthis month, we arrived within sixteen days at this city, in spite of the\r\nheavy roads and great rains we encountered.  Upon our arrival here we\r\nfound the fleet ready to sail down the river, but on account of the calm\r\nweather and want of wind, no vessel has been able to sail until to-day,\r\nFriday.  The ship on which the friars were to sail only got as far as San\r\nDomingo and there, the cedulas did not make it perfectly clear that the\r\nofficials should pay their passage to Puerto de Caballos; because the\r\ncedulas say that from there they are to be paid to Honduras, because they\r\nwere supposed to go in the vessel that would disembark them at the said\r\nPuerto de Caballos.  The cedulas that I obtained, were made out\r\nconditionally should the friars think it better to go to Quaçaqualco; so\r\nthat should they not think it better to go to Quaçaqualco they would for\r\nthat reason, be unable to leave Hispaniola.  Therefore I beg Your Highness\r\n(55) to be gracious enough to order a cedula to be supplied them, ordering\r\nthe officials in Hispaniola to pay the passage from there to Puerto de\r\nCaballos, in case they do not have to disembark at Quaçaqualco—as I\r\nbelieve they will not—and may it arrive soon, as this fleet is on the\r\npoint of sailing.  Referring to this, the officials of India House have no\r\nfunds from which to give me the two hundred and fifty ducats Your Highness\r\nhad the goodness to order to be given to start me off, because—leaving\r\napart what was sent them to keep for the bishops, etc.,—no other monies\r\nfrom His Majesty have been sent them: so here I am—with the past expenses\r\nfor works, and without a maravedi for my provisions, on which account I\r\nhave neither done nor bought anything.  I do not even know in which vessel\r\nI am sailing because there is nothing that is not muddled, but as I have\r\nno money, I am less worried than I should be about the vessel in which I\r\nam to sail.  I beseech Your Highness, if it be your pleasure that I should\r\ngo with this fleet and take those friars, to do me the favour to send me a\r\ncedula ordering that they give me the two hundred and fifty ducats out of\r\nthe funds of the dead.  And it must come soon, and with all haste if I am\r\nto go now, as however quickly it may arrive, it will not come in time for\r\nme to complete my preparations, seeing the hurry the fleet is in and the\r\nlittle I have with which to provide things: for I have to provide for the\r\nneeds of the friars.\r\n\r\nI received one letter from the Court, as our bulls came two days after our\r\ndeparture. It seems Our Lord will not pay me in this world for the worries\r\nI go through for His sake.  Certainly it were a great glory for me that\r\nYour Highness should honour and favour me on my consecration, thus\r\ncompleting the favours Your Highness has shown me.  I give thanks to God\r\nthat He has so favoured me and undoubtedly I hope to accomplish more in\r\nthose distant parts, than in the ecclesiastical courts of this country.\r\nUp to now they [the bulls] have not arrived, nor do I know who will bring\r\nthem nor when they will come.  When they arrive I shall endeavour—should\r\nthere be time—to obtain the favour from his excellency the Cardinal of\r\nordering me to be consecrated by anybody who can perform the ceremony,\r\nalthough I have not yet kissed the hands of his excellency, he having been\r\nvery busy these past two days since his arrival.  I was likewise unable to\r\npass through Toledo—being obliged to await my commissions which were\r\nnecessary for my speaking to the Provincial of the Franciscans about the\r\ntwelve monks, of whom only two are here, who will sail with this fleet.  I\r\nbeseech your Highness to order a letter to be written to him [the\r\nProvincial] that he may send the others immediately if they are to go in\r\nthis ship, and they will afterwards be given provisions if they arrive in\r\ntime; and should they not, I will leave the documents concerning them in\r\nthe charge of the Superior of the Franciscan Order.  May Our Lord bless\r\nand give you all prosperity in your high station and in His service as\r\nYour Highness deserves and we, your most humble servants, desire. Amen.\r\nFrom Seville 21st of March 1544 Your Highness’s servant who kisses your\r\nRoyal hands—\r\n\r\n                            FRAY BARTHOLOMEW DE LAS CASAS, _Bishop elect._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother letter dated ten days later and addressed in the same manner to\r\nPrince Philip through the India Council describes the episcopal\r\nconsecration of Las Casas and invites the Prince’s attention to certain\r\nmatters in the following terms:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVERY HIGH AND POTENT LORDS: To-day, Passion Sunday our Lord graciously\r\nbestowed on me the glory of consecration—very different from the\r\nignominies He suffered that day, according to the representations of His\r\nchurch.  I do not know why His Majesty ordered it to be so done, as it\r\ncould not be done before—nor was there time to expect it could be done\r\nafterwards—on account of the haste of the fleet to sail: but however that\r\nmay be, to him be all glory and thanks, for he deserves them.  The\r\nCardinal has shown me great kindness in favouring me wherever possible. It\r\nwas his nephew or relative, the Bishop Loaysa, who consecrated me,\r\nassisted by the Bishop of Honduras and the Bishop Torres.  The Bishop of\r\nHonduras was about setting out, but at my request he waited to assist at\r\nmy consecration, and in great poverty he has delayed his journey seven or\r\neight days, the expenses of which I would have willingly paid if I had had\r\nthe wherewithal.  I humbly beg Your Highness to recompense him for what I\r\nowe him: I shall esteem it a favour to myself.  Although no occasion\r\nshould offer, I was thinking to ask Your Highness to graciously grant him\r\nsome relief, so that that church, destitute of pastor and spiritual\r\nministrations, may not suffer such abandonment and poverty, for I greatly\r\ndoubt that he would solicit anything. I humbly and affectionately beseech\r\nYour Highness that this be one of the first things attended to, as it is\r\nmost important. Whatever way that Your Highness may adopt to supply that\r\nneed, will be acceptable to him.  One day shortly after I arrived at this\r\ncity, I wrote begging Your Highness to do me the favour to order the\r\nofficials of this house [India House] to pay me the two hundred and fifty\r\nducats which His Majesty granted me from the funds of the dead, because\r\nthere are no others, and therefore I have found myself in want.  Knowing\r\nthis the officials of this house did me a great service in getting a\r\ncertain banker to lend it me, against my promise to repay within thirty\r\ndays.  I beseech Your Highness to do me the favour of ordering a cedula\r\ncovering it to be issued, because the fleet is in a great hurry to sail\r\nand were the cedula delayed I would suffer great want and much annoyance,\r\nfor if I could not repay what the creditor has lent me, it would be a very\r\nbad thing for him.  I likewise beseech Your Highness to order the\r\nnecessary cedulas for the friars to be sent, that the officials of\r\nHispaniola may pay their passage to Puerto de Caballos, for I have one\r\nonly to Quaçaqualco, where we shall not be able to land on account of the\r\nbad harbour.  The other principal cedula authorises the officials of India\r\nHouse to pay the passage to Puerto de Caballos, but this cannot be done\r\nfor lack of ships, so the friars first disembarked at the port of San\r\nDomingo in Hispaniola and from there, they have to reembark to Puerto de\r\nCaballos.  The officials of San Domingo have no authority for this, and if\r\nthe friars had to remain there long they would suffer great danger.\r\n\r\nEveryone here is quite well and receiving shelter and charity from the\r\nmonasteries.  The Provincial and the Prior of this convent of San Pablo\r\nand the others have well carried out Your Highness’s orders in this\r\nrespect.  All kiss the hands of Your Highness and pray God to prolong the\r\nlife and Royal state of Your Highness, especially Fray Rodrigo—our\r\ncompanion.  I beseech Your Highness, for the service of God, to provide\r\nthat the relief and freedom which His Majesty granted to the Indians in\r\nthe island of Cuba may be made effective, before those who hold them have\r\nfinished destroying and killing them, for they are and have been most\r\nshamefully oppressed, afflicted, and reduced in number in all those parts\r\nof the Indies.\r\n\r\nLikewise, that, since the Archdeacon Alvaro de Castro, whom Your Highness\r\ncharged with the care of the Indians in Hispaniola, is dead, Your Highness\r\nwill order that duty assigned to some devout friar or ecclesiastic so that\r\nthose who survive, few as they are, may not be deprived of the enjoyment\r\nof the relief and favour His Majesty granted them.  It seems to me it\r\nwould be well, should Your Highness so please, to bestow it on Canon\r\nAlbaro de Leon who is a Canon of La Vega, or on Gregorio de Viguera, Dean\r\nof the same church of La Vega.\r\n\r\nMay the Lord increase and prosper the fortunate life and very high estate\r\nof Your Highness in His holy service, Amen. Seville 31st March 1544 Your\r\nservant who kisses your Royal hands—\r\n\r\n                                  FRAY BARTHOLOMEW DE LAS CASAS, _Bishop._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of all the anti-slavery legislation enacted, there were actually\r\nat that time a number of Indians held as slaves in Seville itself, and\r\nbefore starting for his distant diocese, Las Casas undertook as his first\r\nduty to secure their liberation.  His action aroused much of the ancient\r\nenmity against him, but to that he was indifferent: the text of the New\r\nLaws was explicit, leaving no opening for false construction.  Success\r\ncrowned his efforts and enabled him to leave, fully satisfied, for San\r\nLucar de Barrameda where his friars were waiting for him to embark. He\r\nthere celebrated the feast of Corpus Domini with great pomp, and during\r\nthe time occupied in his final preparations, he and his friars received\r\nmany donations of necessaries.  The fleet of twenty-seven ships, amongst\r\nlarge and small only awaited the arrival of Doña Maria de Toledo widow of\r\nthe Admiral Don Diego Columbus, who was to sail for Hispaniola to\r\nsafeguard the rights of her children in some disputed questions of\r\ninheritance and upon her arrival, it immediately put to sea on July l0th.\r\nThe new Bishop, with his faithful companion Ladrada and forty-five\r\nDominican friars, embarked on the _San Salvador_.  On that same date he\r\nentered into possession of his meagre episcopal revenues, for an ordinance\r\nthat had been passed to oblige the bishops of American dioceses to stay in\r\nthem, established that their incomes should begin from the date of their\r\nsailing. (56)\r\n\r\nThis proving insufficient, as there were some who were satisfied with\r\ntheir episcopal dignity and preferred to remain in Spain, it was\r\nafterwards provided that their consecration must take place in America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. - LETTER TO PHILIP II.  VOYAGE TO AMERICA.  FEELING IN THE\r\nCOLONIES.  ARRIVAL IN CHIAPA\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore sailing to take possession of his diocese, Las Casas addressed the\r\nfollowing letter of farewell to Prince Philip (afterwards Philip II.),\r\nthen governing in the name of the Emperor, his father:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVERY HIGH AND VERY POTENT LORD: I received two letters simultaneously from\r\nYour Highness: the date of the last was April 1st and accompanying it was\r\nthe Royal cedula concerning the passage from Hispaniola to Honduras for\r\nthe monks whom Your Highness is sending to those provinces.  For all of\r\nwhich I kiss your Royal hands and for your kindness in granting that the\r\nbulls should be sent so promptly as to reach me in time to serve at my\r\nconsecration, which, by divine grace, took place here in San Pablo on\r\nPassion Sunday as I already wrote Your Highness the day after.  I trust to\r\nGod our Lord that this dignity, to which, by divine Providence, our lord\r\nand sovereign the Emperor has elevated me, despite any unworthiness and\r\ninability to support it, may prove a sufficient instrument for better\r\nfulfilling my old desires to do the will of God, of which God has deigned\r\nto make use in those countries.  It is His will that His Holy Faith should\r\nbe preached and that the beings he has created and redeemed should know\r\nHim and that His predestined ones should be saved and His Majesty and Your\r\nHighness receive great services.  Concerning the two hundred and fifty\r\nducats which Your Highness granted me, the officials of this house have\r\nnot yet obtained them, but I hope they will seek them and supply them in\r\nthe end, though it may be with difficulty, because everybody is aware that\r\nHis Majesty has no money in this house and that so many demands daily\r\narise that there is not a man who will lend a maravedi to His Majesty.  In\r\ntruth, this is very injurious to His Majesty’s service and to the\r\ngreatness of his imperial State, because, according as his enemies learn\r\nthat this house is rich or is in want of money—so will they either fear\r\nhim or presume to cause him annoyances.  In order that this house should\r\nalways enjoy confidence to guarantee the above mentioned, it seems that\r\nYour Highness ought to command that, just as they keep account of what is\r\nspent in keeping an army and in feeding those who are actually in\r\nattendance, night and day, on the royal and imperial person of His Majesty\r\nand on Your Highness, so also should it be provided that when this house\r\nhas a surplus of twenty or thirty thousand ducats, it should be reported\r\nto have one or two hundred thousand.  Such sums should never, on account\r\nof any other necessity, be lacking here, for they would be useful for many\r\nthings and by the credit they would give, the greatest wants could be met.\r\nI shall report, as Your Highness ordered, the number and names of the\r\nfriars now sailing, as soon as we are all united, God willing, at San\r\nLucar.\r\n\r\nUp to now I think we have forty-three.  I am in hopes of more going from\r\nthis province, from which we have seven or eight.  But all those who are\r\ngoing, do not want to separate from those who come from Castile or to go\r\nto any other part of the Indies except where the latter do: the men from\r\nhere are very virtuous and religious people.  The number I have said we\r\nhave here would have been greater, had not some six or eight of those whom\r\nwe brought from Castile stayed behind.  I think that some were afraid and\r\nothers were detained by reasonable obstacles: the latter, we hope will\r\nfollow us when the causes are removed.  I beg Your Highness to order the\r\nProvincial, who is now appointed to this province and who was formerly\r\nPrior of San Pablo in Valladolid, a true servant of God, and very zealous\r\nfor God’s honour and for the salvation of the Indians, to be induced to\r\ncontinually send monks to those parts, as I firmly believe he will amply\r\ncomply.\r\n\r\nThis house of San Pablo in Seville being very necessary for the religious\r\nYour Highness will be sending to the Indies, and having great expenses on\r\naccount of the poverty and want of this city, where everything costs a\r\nthird more than in Valladolid—which is frightful—I humbly beseech Your\r\nHighness always to remember it by gifts and by such alms as it may be\r\npossible to bestow on it: especially out of the funds of the dead.  For I\r\nhold it to be as necessary to give alms to the house, and just as\r\nbeneficial to the souls of the dead—to whom the fund belongs—as it is to\r\ngive for the maintenance of the friars who go to preach the gospel in\r\nthose parts where the deceased unrighteously amassed the riches they left\r\nbehind them.  Your Highness may believe that the protection and good\r\ntreatment shown here to the friars, tend to dispel their fears of the\r\nlabours which friars in the Indies usually sustain.  Without such\r\nencouragement everything would be just the contrary, and some would be\r\nfrightened and discouraged, as has heretofore happened.  Certainly, up to\r\nthe present, great have been the care and comfort that our companions,\r\nservants of God, have received here from the provincial and the prior.\r\nTwenty or twenty-two have been given shelter here.  I therefore beg Your\r\nHighness to bear this in mind, should there be an occasion in the future\r\nto grant them any favour or alms.  In this city and throughout Andalusia\r\nthere is a large number of Indians held unjustly as slaves; and when the\r\nlicentiate Gregorio Lopez was here by order of His Majesty, they kept many\r\nIndians imprisoned after the order was given for their release, some being\r\nhidden and others taken into the country and elsewhere.  I have even been\r\ntold by a man who knows—to clear his conscience—that there was a great\r\ndeal of bribery and corruption among wicked people, who used three or four\r\nor ten ducats to outrage God, stealing the liberty of the Indians and thus\r\nleaving many in perpetual slavery: they also hid the truth by threatening\r\nthe Indians who showed themselves and by other means, such as withholding\r\nfacts from the licentiate Gregorio Lopez which he could not divine, but\r\nwhich should have been told him.  The only remedy for such injustices,\r\naccording to the officials of this house who are very good people as far\r\nas I can see and who have consciences, is that Your Highness should order\r\nto be proclaimed throughout Andalusia that all those who have Indians must\r\nbring or send them to this house within a certain time, otherwise they\r\nshall all be considered as free; adding other penalties for noncompliance.\r\nAccording to the provision made by His Majesty, there should be an\r\nimmediate settlement of the pretensions of those who allege a title by\r\npurchase, which allows them to hold an Indian as a slave until it is\r\nascertained from whom he was first acquired; for they stole them all and\r\nsold them when they arrived here.  Any such Indian should not remain in\r\ntheir possession but should be placed where he could earn enough to clothe\r\nhimself and save sufficient to return to his country—because they subject\r\nhim to a thousand oppressions and cruelties.  I have seen things of that\r\nsort daily since my arrival.  San Pablo is crowded with Indians who think\r\nthat I can take them or can relieve their captivity and the torments they\r\nsuffer.  And their masters, discovering this by their absence promptly\r\nbeat them and put them in irons, even those whom the licentiate Gregorio\r\nLopez left neither in slavery nor free.  Not to prolong this letter, I do\r\nnot relate many other things to Your Highness.\r\n\r\nI likewise beg Your Highness to order some relief that is final and not\r\nindefinite, for the men who were thus left neither slaves nor free:\r\nbecause I do not know what relief it can be considered, to leave them\r\nneither free nor slaves until they die; for meanwhile, they are daily\r\ntreated worse and worse by those who call them slaves and dogs, because\r\nthey consider that the licentiate Gregorio Lopez approved of their\r\ncaptivity, etc., tying their hands the more tightly.  I have seen what I\r\nstate ever since I came here.  Your Highness would both laugh at and\r\nabominate the spice dealers of this city, who barter spices for Indians\r\nand for gold (as it is they who mostly own them), and their fierceness in\r\nmaking war on the Indians, that makes them to seem like dummy lions,\r\npainted.  What I wish Your Highness would do to protect all such Indians\r\nas are left neither slaves or freemen and all who are bound in any way,\r\nwould be to oblige their owners to exhibit a receipt of the sale: because\r\nit is clear to every one, save to those whose perceptions God has allowed\r\nto be weakened by their malice, audacity, and ambition, that there has\r\nnever been a war in all the Indies for which there was any real authority\r\ngiven by His Majesty or by his royal predecessors.  The royal instructions\r\non this point have never been heeded, as I have seen and on my conscience\r\naffirm, and as all those violaters admit.  Consequently, as there was\r\nnever just cause, it follows that all the wars were unjust and that no\r\nIndians could have been justly enslaved: all the more so since the\r\nSpaniards attacked them in time of peace and captured millions of them.\r\nThis being the real truth, Your Highness should order that all such owners\r\nbe obliged to prove the title of him who sold any such Indian, and so on\r\nback till the first one who stole or treacherously captured him is\r\nunearthed.  In the meantime the Indians should be taken from them and\r\nplaced as above indicated, all of which should be done within a limited\r\ntime, so that the legal proceedings would not last eternally; and when\r\nthey are finished the said Indian should be declared free.\r\n\r\nBut what I would take on my conscience and would answer for to God on my\r\ndeathbed is, that Your Highness should proclaim throughout this kingdom\r\nthat all the Indians here must be free—because in truth they are just as\r\nfree as I am.  In this Casa de Contractacion, outside its judges and\r\nofficials such as the treasurer, accountant, and agents, who seem to me to\r\nbe those I have mentioned above, and some few minor officials, I see there\r\nis little zeal or kindness for the Indians, and I observe such\r\ndisinclination to accomplish anything in their favour, that however small\r\nmay be the pendulum, they work it with as much effort as though it were a\r\ntower they had to move.\r\n\r\nTruly I think Your Highness must order everything to be done gratis and\r\nwillingly;—or if not, then pay somebody who will do it.  There is very\r\ngreat need here for somebody to help these poor Indians, being as they\r\nare, in great want and more than miserable, because they do not know how\r\nto ask for justice. They have been so intimidated and thrust down into the\r\nvery abyss that they dare not complain.  I do not find a single man who\r\nwill take pity on them: but on the contrary, every on persecutes,\r\nterrorizes, and despises them.  And I am sure God will execute justice and\r\nexact vengeance for all this.  It would be well if Your Highness would\r\norder a salary to be paid some man who would act as their lawyer in the\r\nHouse, commanding all necessary authority to be attached to his office,\r\nand that the officials should help him in it.  If it is necessary to\r\nconsult His Majesty for this, do not let these poor wretches suffer for\r\nwant of protection as they have always done.  There is a porter in this\r\nHouse, a good man who, according to what I have seen and the officials\r\ntold me, has repeatedly taken pity on them, and I beseech Your Highness to\r\ngrant me and all the Indians the favour of ordering him to be appointed as\r\nprotector of all the Indians in this Kingdom and of their affairs in this\r\nHouse, authorising him to report all the happenings of any importance to\r\nYour Highness and to the Royal Council of the Indies.  Let this power be\r\ngiven to Diego Collantes, porter of the said House; and to ensure his\r\nusing it the more faithfully until Your Highness pleases to grant him a\r\nsalary, I will pay him twenty ducats yearly, so that he may do his duty in\r\nthe said office.  The truth is, that although he is a good man, the\r\nposition needs a man with much more authority but for the present he would\r\nsuffice.  Juan de la Quadra, who was secretary to the licentiate Gregorio\r\nLopez while he was here, spoke to me about these matters.  He seems to me\r\nan honest, upright person and one who feels deeply the crimes committed in\r\nthis city against the Indians.  He is writing to Your Highness on the\r\nsubject and I beseech Your Highness to order some remedy provided for the\r\nactual necessities. He informs me that he is writing in the sense of what\r\nI said above.\r\n\r\nThe licentiate Bartolomé Ortiz did not bring his Indians to be registered\r\nwithin the period intimated to him and says that he protested against the\r\nsentence before this Royal Council, also with regard to other Indians whom\r\nhe held as slaves, despite the fact that they were free.  Amongst these\r\nwas an Indian woman who was beyond question free, and had been declared\r\nfree by Gregorio Lopez, who left orders for her to be sent at the\r\nlicentiate’s expense to the island of Cuba from whence he brought her.\r\nOrtiz also appealed from this decision.  As I asked that she might now be\r\ngiven the letter and order of Your Highness permitting her to return with\r\nthis fleet, Ortiz presented a statement showing that his case was at\r\npresent in appeal before this Royal Council.\r\n\r\nI beseech Your Highness not to permit these appeals and delays in cases\r\nwhich are favourable to the liberty of the Indians and of everybody in the\r\nworld, because there will be no end to them nor will a single Indian ever\r\nobtain his liberty.  I beg that Your Highness will order this Indian woman\r\nand the others to be liberated and allowed to return to their country.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed a great weight on my conscience to leave the Indians in this\r\ncountry, because, as they only mix with servants and other unmanageable\r\nand vicious persons and see the taverns full of loose people, without\r\norder or restraint, and other public places full of bad examples, it must\r\nhappen that they, being human, will follow the example of their\r\ncompanions.  In their own country, on the contrary, they live much better\r\nthan here, even if there are not so many Christians.  I beseech Your\r\nHighness to issue such orders that not one man of them may remain here.\r\n\r\nIt would also be well if Your Highness ordered an explanation of the\r\nproclamation that you commanded to be published throughout all the Indies,\r\nprohibiting the officials of India House from receiving Indians into this\r\nkingdom: also instructions as to what they must do to forbid this traffic,\r\nunder penalty of death, to ship captains and sailors, so that no one would\r\ndare to bring an Indian, nor allow one to be brought here. Let them know\r\nthat they are forewarned in such cases.\r\n\r\nThinking there was nothing doubtful in the cedulas Your Highness sent for\r\nthe departure of these religious I did not care to exhibit the cedula\r\nuntil the very end, in case we took besides the forty, an excess of\r\nstores, etc.  Now that I have shown it to the officials, they maintain\r\nthat, as it does not expressly state that those above the number of forty\r\nshould be provided for out of the funds of the dead, but from the money in\r\nthe charge of the treasurers, they do not intend to provide for more than\r\nthe forty, lest they should have to pay out of their own pockets.  I\r\nbeseech Your Highness graciously to order this settled at once, so that we\r\nshall not be forced to leave behind the religious we hope to embark, in\r\naddition to the forty.  And let this be done soon, for we are only waiting\r\nfor good weather.  The heavy rains which have fallen daily have prevented\r\nthe launching of two or three of the vessels.  To-day the river from its\r\nsource has abated.  Our Lord prosper and grant a long and happy life to\r\nYour Highness.  Amen.  Seville 20th April 1544.  Your humble servant who\r\nkisses Your Royal hands.\r\n\r\nTo-night the following occurred—an Indian came to me complaining that\r\nnotwithstanding his certificate of freedom, given him by Gregorio Lopez,\r\nhis owner kept him in slavery and treated him worse than a slave, sending\r\nhim out with a donkey to carry and sell water. He showed me his\r\ncertificate of freedom, in the presence of ten or twelve monks.  I told\r\nhim to go to-day to the Casa de Contractacion so that its officials might\r\ncorrect the abuse, and I sent a servant with him to show him the\r\nbuilding—because if his master found out, he would keep him until he\r\ncalled in the officials.  Finally his owner discovered him and took the\r\nletter and tore it up.  He said “bring chains and put them on this dog.”\r\nThe Indian escaped through a window and they cried after him, “Thief,\r\nthief,” so that somebody down below came and beat him, and stabbed him in\r\nthe jaw.  He managed to reach a place where some of my servants were, and\r\nthey are trying to cure him: but he is dying.  One of my servants went to\r\nthe assistant to tell him what had happened, but the latter answered that\r\nhe was not astonished that people killed the Indians, because they stole\r\nand did much harm.  I beg Your Highness to note how destitute they are of\r\nany pity.  With judges so cruelly unjust and tyrannical, Your Highness may\r\nimagine what sort of things happen over there [in the colonies] with the\r\nSpaniards against the Indians, when they dare do these things in Seville\r\nwhere, the other day a judge ordered an Indian to be stabbed to death.\r\n\r\nFRAY BARTHOLOMEW DE LAS CASAS, BISHOP OF CHIAPA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe voyage began badly, for the _San Salvador_ was poorly ballasted and\r\nonly arrived at Gomera, one of the Canary Islands, after considerable\r\ndifficulty and danger, on the 19th of July, and was detained there for ten\r\ndays until the ship was made seaworthy.  Some of the friars who were\r\nunfamiliar with sea-voyages conceived such mistrust of the _San Salvador_\r\nthat they refused to again go aboard her, so it was necessary to\r\ndistribute these nineteen timid souls amongst the other ships. The 30th of\r\nJuly saw the fleet again at sea, and the voyage to Hispaniola continued\r\nwithout any untoward incident, until the 9th of September, when they\r\narrived in the harbour of Santo Domingo, where the same vessel on which\r\nLas Casas and the twenty-seven friars were, ran on a rock and came near\r\nbeing wrecked in sight of land: hardly was this disaster surmounted when\r\nshe collided with another of the ships to the imminent peril of both,\r\nthough, fortunately, with no great injury to either.\r\n\r\nThe Dominicans in Santo Domingo conducted the Bishop and his friars in\r\nsolemn procession to the convent, where Te Deum Laudamus was sung.\r\n\r\nIn striking contrast to this affectionate reception was that which awaited\r\nhim from the colonists.  The New Laws were regarded as the ruin of the\r\ncolonies and Las Casas was universally considered the inspirer, if not\r\nactually the framer of these laws, hence the indignation and hatred of the\r\nSpaniards against him and all Dominicans was at fever heat: meetings were\r\nheld, in which it was resolved to boycott the friars and refuse them all\r\nalms or assistance.  Seeing the odium he had unwittingly wrought upon his\r\nhosts, the Bishop was inclined to leave their convent and go to the\r\nFranciscans, but this was rightly considered as likely to spread the\r\nantagonism which had so far manifested itself against the Dominicans only.\r\nEven before things had reached this point, Las Casas had already written\r\nPrince Philip on the 15th of September, denouncing the cruelties which\r\nstill went on unchecked and mentioning by name a number of officials who\r\nwere unworthy to occupy the positions they held, because of the grave\r\nabuses they committed and tolerated.\r\n\r\nOn September 10th a letter which shows the state of public feeling towards\r\nthe New Laws and the new Bishop was addressed to the Emperor by the\r\nprincipal colonists of Nicaragua.\r\n\r\nThe signers avow their surprise that their twenty-five or thirty years of\r\nservices to the Crown should be rewarded by seeing their children\r\ndisinherited, and declare that if the New Laws are put in force, despite\r\ntheir cries to high heaven for justice, it will only remain for many of\r\nthem to die.  Las Casas is denounced as an envious, vainglorious, and\r\nturbulent monk, who has been expelled from every colony in the Indies and\r\nwhom even no monastery can tolerate.  He is charged with bringing ruin on\r\nlarge numbers of people, solely because revengeful motives prompt him to\r\ninjure certain individuals.  It is also pointed out that he knows nothing\r\nabout affairs in New Spain and the mainland, having spent all his life in\r\nCuba and the islands.\r\n\r\nHowever much Las Casas may have deplored the feeling his presence provoked\r\nand especially the rancour he had stirred up against his brethren, whose\r\nonly offence lay in giving him hospitality, he did not allow his regrets\r\non this score to arrest or modify the steps he intended to take to enforce\r\nobedience to the New Laws. Shortly after his arrival, he presented copies\r\nof the laws and of the other royal ordinances which he carried, to the\r\nAudiencia, asking that, in accordance with their provisions, all Indians\r\nthen held in slavery should be liberated.  Although the President,\r\nCerrato, supported him, the other members of the Audiencia were one and\r\nall opposed.  According to the current phrase, they agreed to _obey_ the\r\nlaw, but declared they could not _comply_ with it.  They all held slaves\r\nthemselves and the only result of the action of Las Casas was, that they\r\nsent their representatives to Spain to procure some reform in the more\r\nobnoxious articles of the code.\r\n\r\nThe presence of Las Casas in Hispaniola infused new courage into the\r\nDominicans, who had been discouraged in recent years by the difficulty and\r\nhopelessness of contending against public opinion on the subject of the\r\nIndians and had consequently ceased to preach and agitate in their favour:\r\nsome members of the community had even been affected by the prevalent\r\nopinion that the Indians were really a race of a different order, servile\r\nby nature, and destined by Providence to a life of subjection to their\r\nsuperiors.  Learned arguments were found to sustain this opinion. The\r\nwell-known chapters of Aristotle’s _Politics_ were quoted, the Scriptures\r\nwere drawn upon, and, as not infrequently happens, many good men adopted\r\nthe easier line of not contending with the views of the rich and powerful.\r\n\r\nThere now ensued a sort of revival of the old enthusiasm in the defence of\r\nthe natives; sermons were preached which stirred up great wrath and\r\nprovoked protest from the authorities. It was easy to adopt reprisals on\r\nthe friars, and the colonists did not hesitate to do so, refusing alms and\r\nsupplies to the convents.  Threats of violence, even of shooting Fray\r\nTomas Casillas, whose sermons had been particularly offensive, were not\r\nwanting, though fortunately they were not executed.  The friars were\r\nreduced to the last extremity and, but for the charity of some few\r\nsympathisers and the generous aid of the Franciscan monks who fed them,\r\nthey would have found themselves in want of the absolute necessaries of\r\nlife in the midst of a hostile populace.  At this juncture a notable\r\nconversion was effected by their preaching; a widow named Solano, who was\r\nreputed the richest person in the colony, came one day to the convent and\r\ndeclared that she was convinced of the truth of all the preachers had\r\nexpounded concerning the iniquity of slavery and that she had in\r\nconsequence resolved, not only to liberate her two hundred and more\r\nslaves, but to make restitution of her tainted wealth in as far as she\r\ncould, by transferring her plantations to the Order, as her awakened\r\nconscience forbade her enjoyment of it.  This event stirred the entire\r\ncolony profoundly, and as the action of the friars was so clearly contrary\r\nto their own temporal interests as to place the sincerity of their\r\nconvictions and the purity of their motive beyond question, a certain\r\nrevulsion in public sentiment began to manifest itself. It is not recorded\r\nthat anybody else followed the widow’s example, but such a change was\r\noperated in the disposition of the better class of people that when the\r\ntime for Las Casas and his friars to leave arrived, regret for their\r\ndeparture was expressed on all sides.  On December 14th they embarked on\r\nwhat proved to be a long and tempestuous voyage, attended by many and\r\ngreat dangers; owing to the ignorance of the pilot, the Bishop himself had\r\nto take the wheel.  Christmas was celebrated at sea, and it was not until\r\nthe fifth of January that they finally landed at the port of Lazaro on the\r\ncoast of Campeche.  The first episcopal function performed by the Bishop\r\nin his new diocese was the pontifical celebration of the vigil and mass of\r\nthe Epiphany, during which he delivered an earnest discourse on the one\r\ntheme that furnished material for all his sermons and writings—the\r\ninjustice and sin of slavery and the obligation resting on all Christian\r\nSpaniards to liberate their slaves in conformity with the laws of the\r\nEmperor, and to provide for their humane treatment and conversion,\r\naccording to the law of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. - RECEPTION OF LAS CASAS IN HIS DIOCESE.  EVENTS IN CIUDAD\r\nREAL.  THE INDIANS OF CHIAPA\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the Bishop of Chiapa, upon landing in his diocese, determined to\r\nfollow the dictates of prudence rather than the promptings of zeal in\r\nbringing his spiritual subjects into submission to the New Laws, the\r\nquestion of Indian slavery was one so closely bound up with their temporal\r\ninterests that no moderation or persuasion on his part could have availed\r\nto bring about their renunciation of the established system.   In the\r\nfirst sermons preached by his friars, the subject of slavery was not\r\nmentioned, and Las Casas sought, more by private conversation and argument\r\nwith individuals, to convince them of the grave infraction of morals as\r\nwell as the open violation of the law, they committed in holding the\r\nIndians in slavery.  His arguments fell upon deaf ears, nor did a single\r\nSpaniard accept his admonitions or entertain for a moment the idea of\r\nliberating his slaves.   Nor did their resistance confine itself to a\r\npassive form, for within a short time, the colonists openly refused him\r\nobedience and withheld his lawful tithes, declaring that they would not\r\nreceive him as their Bishop, and occasioning him every annoyance and\r\ndiscomfort they could invent.  The refusal of his tithes caused the Bishop\r\nserious embarrassment, as it left him without funds to pay for the ship he\r\nhad chartered in Hispaniola for his journey to Campeche.  The priest of\r\nthe town managed to raise about one hundred castellanos for this purpose\r\nand Las Casas signed a note for the remainder.\r\n\r\nThe Governor of those regions at that time was Francisco de Montejo, who\r\nhad played a conspicuous part in the affairs of Mexico, whither he had\r\ngone with Fernando Cortes.  He was absent when Las Casas landed at\r\nCampeche and became the object of such general and determined hostility,\r\nand his son was governing in his stead.  In response to the announcement\r\nof the Bishop’s presence, the Governor despatched his brother-in-law, who\r\nwas a person of some authority, to welcome the Bishop, instructing him to\r\ntreat him in all respects with the highest consideration and in case he\r\nwished to come to Merida, to arrange everything necessary for his journey\r\nthither.\r\n\r\nIt was decided to make the journey by sea rather than by the more\r\ndifficult overland route, and one boat-load of friars sailed, carrying a\r\nlarge part of the stores, which included vestments and altar plate and\r\nother church furnishings.  Hardly were the preparations for the departure\r\nof the Bishop and the remainder of his people completed, when the\r\ndistressing news of the total loss of this vessel and its cargo reached\r\nthem from Champoton, an Indian village, where the few survivors of the\r\nwreck had found refuge. Nine friars and twenty-three other persons\r\nperished in this disaster, the news of which threw a heavy cloud of\r\nsadness over the little band of missionaries.  Thousands of miles from\r\ntheir native land and in a new world, these men were sustained solely by\r\ntheir faith in their mission and their confidence in the leadership of\r\ntheir venerable Bishop, for they were not only cut off from hope of\r\nsuccour but were exposed to the persecutions of their own countrymen,\r\nbecause of their zeal for justice, in defending the oppressed against\r\ncupidity and cruelty.  Despite the many causes for discouragement Las\r\nCasas decided, on the advice of the pilot of the ship that was to carry\r\nthem, to profit by the fair weather then prevailing, and set the example\r\nto the others of going first on board the vessel.  The friars followed in\r\nsilence, and so entirely were their thoughts given to the premature fate\r\nof their lost comrades, that the whole of that night and the following day\r\nwere passed in silence and prayer: when the ship reached the place where\r\nthe wreck had occurred, the prayers for the dead were solemnly recited by\r\nthe tearful company.  This becoming tribute rendered to the memory of the\r\ndeparted, Las Casas seated himself at table and, setting the others a\r\nwholesome example, he began to eat, for until then no one had had the\r\nheart to touch food.  The weather suddenly changed for the worse and a\r\nperilous Norther, which was the greatest enemy of navigation in those\r\nwaters, sprang up, forcing the vessel to put in at the island of Terminos,\r\nwhere some fragments of the wreck were found, but the sea had given up no\r\ndead. Three days passed in waiting for better weather, and though Las\r\nCasas desired to re-embark and continue the voyage, Fray Tomas Casillas\r\nwas in favour of waiting for the shipwrecked people at Champoton to\r\novertake them, and then to continue the journey overland.  This difference\r\nof opinion led to a division of the company, the Bishop re-embarking with\r\nFather Ladrada and a few of the others, while the majority were left to\r\nfollow the overland route.\r\n\r\nThe chief city of the diocese of Chiapa was Ciudad Real, and the Bishop,\r\non his arrival, was accorded a warm welcome and was lodged in one of the\r\nbest houses in the place, belonging to a Spaniard who was absent at that\r\ntime, while the friars were accommodated in another, just opposite.  The\r\nclergy of the immense diocese was scanty enough, being composed of two\r\npriests in that town and three others elsewhere; of these latter common\r\nreport did not speak well, as their secular occupations and efforts to\r\nenrich themselves brought discredit upon their clerical character.  The\r\ncathedral was a small church, of poor construction and meagrely furnished\r\nwith the necessaries for celebrating the religious offices.  One of the\r\nnew Bishop’s first disciplinary acts was to summon the three vagrant\r\npriests to Ciudad Real, where he might constrain them to a more sacerdotal\r\nlife under his immediate authority.  Las Casas lived according to the\r\nstrict rule of his Order, eating only fish, eggs, and vegetables, and,\r\nthough he permitted meat to the others who sat at his table, there was so\r\nlittle to tickle the palate of the epicure that two out of the three\r\nrenounced allegiance to their Bishop and betook themselves beyond the\r\nconfines of his diocese where they speedily fell into evil ways.  His life\r\nat this period was one of truly apostolic simplicity; although seventy\r\nyears old, his habits were as frugal and austere as those of any\r\nanchorite.  Towards the Spanish colonists he at first manifested mild and\r\naffectionate sentiments, which blinded them so entirely to the indomitable\r\nenergy and fearless spirit that animated him, that they, on their part,\r\nshowed themselves obsequious and generous.  The deception was mutual, and\r\ndisillusion only awaited the moment when the material interests of the\r\nSpaniards should be touched, to declare itself.  Slavery flourished\r\nthroughout the diocese, to the great affliction of the Bishop: he first\r\nsought by private conversations with the principal persons of the colony,\r\nby arguments, explanation of the New Laws and of the Emperor’s wishes, to\r\neffect the liberation of the Indians, but failing in this, he next\r\npreached publicly on the subject.  No headway was made by one or the other\r\nmeans employed, while shocking cruelties were of daily occurrence and the\r\nIndians, who recognised the Bishop as their only protector and advocate,\r\nbrought him tales of their sufferings which left him no choice but to have\r\nrecourse to stronger measures.\r\n\r\nThe Easter season of 1545 was approaching, and the fulfilment of the\r\nprecept of confession, which marks the farthermost frontier of Catholic\r\nobservance, within which even the most lax must remain under penalty of\r\nexcommunication ipso facto, afforded the Bishop his opportunity. He\r\nwithdrew from all his clergy, except the dean and canon of his cathedral\r\nchurch, their faculties for granting absolution, reserving to himself all\r\nquestions involving the relations of the Spaniards to the Indians.  He\r\nfurnished the two appointed confessors with a detailed list of cases in\r\nwhich not merely the questions of holding slaves and cruel treatment were\r\ninvolved, but likewise those which had to do with the right to hold\r\nproperty acquired unjustly from the natives and by violation of the law.\r\n\r\nThis treatise was doubtless the same that was published in 1552 entitled\r\n_Confesionario_, etc., or in any case it contained the root doctrines of\r\nwhich that tract may have been an elaboration.  Both upon the ability and\r\nthe fidelity of the two confessors he had selected, the Bishop felt he\r\ncould rely, but in the case of the Dean he was again mistaken in his\r\nchoice, for in certain of the reserved cases the latter declared that he\r\nfound no grounds, either in canon law or in any authorities, for his\r\nBishop’s decision.  The Mercedarian friars, who also had a community in\r\nthe diocese, were likewise opposed to the severity of the Bishop, and as\r\nnone of the colonists were disposed to ruin themselves by liberating the\r\nIndians, the situation was a grave one for a Catholic community, for no\r\nmatter how little in conformity with the Church’s teaching were the daily\r\nlives of many, excommunication was intolerable to all of them.\r\nRemonstrances and petitions against his trenchant decision poured in upon\r\nthe Bishop, and the Dean, supported by the Mercedarians, undertook to\r\nintercede for the Spaniards and, if possible, to obtain some relaxation of\r\nthe obnoxious ruling.  Their efforts were vain, for the simple reason that\r\nLas Casas held that it was not within his competence to recede from his\r\ndecision without practically denying his life’s mission.  As the tension\r\nbecame daily more severe, the colonists addressed to the Bishop, a formal\r\n“requirement” drawn up by a notary public, containing arguments to support\r\ntheir claims, based on the terms of the Bull of Alexander VI. and\r\nthreatening, if he persisted in refusing them the sacraments, to appeal to\r\nhis metropolitan, the Archbishop of Mexico, and ultimately to the Pope:\r\nmeanwhile they would denounce him to the King and his Council as a\r\ndisturber of the public peace and a formenter of dissensions and troubles\r\nin the country.  To this threat the Bishop answered: “O blind men! How\r\ncompletely does the devil deceive you!  Wherefore do you threaten me with\r\nyour complaints to the Archbishop, to the Pope, and to the King?  Know\r\nthen that though I am obliged by the law of God to do as I do, and you to\r\nobey what I tell you, you are likewise constrained thereunto by the most\r\njust laws of your sovereign, since you think yourselves such faithful\r\nvassals to him.”  After reading some of the articles of the New Laws\r\nforbidding slavery to them, he continued: “According to this, it is I who\r\nmight much better complain of you, for not obeying your King.”  The\r\nsituation was a deadlock, for the Bishop was immovable, neither would the\r\nSpaniards give way.  From murmuring against his decision and questioning\r\nhis authority to impose such unreasonable and ruinous commands, they\r\npassed to calumny and ridicule, and as these weapon are forged by evil\r\nimaginations and their exercise is unhampered by the restrictions of\r\ntruth, many fantastic accusations were invented against Las Casas, and\r\ndiligently circulated.  The most frugal and abstemious of men was accused\r\nof gluttony and intemperance; his learning, which was certainly varied if\r\nnot vast and was by no means mediocre, was declared to be superficial and\r\ninsufficient to enable him to properly weigh nice questions of theology\r\nand law, and finally it was insinuated that some of his opinions were\r\nheretical and that his refusal to allow the sacraments of penance and the\r\neucharist in his diocese proceeded from his dissembled Lutheranism.  As a\r\nhint of what might overtake him if he persisted in his course, a musket\r\nwas fired into the window of his room one night.  Even the children were\r\ntaught scurrilous couplets which they sang at him, when he appeared in the\r\nstreets: only his Dominicans remained faithful to him in this difficult\r\nseason and their fidelity, though doubtless a source of great consolation\r\nto him, had for its chief visible effect, to involve the friars in the\r\npopular execration visited on the Bishop.  It was a repetition of the\r\nincidents in Hispaniola, for likewise in Chiapa the people turned against\r\nthe friars, refraining from their ministrations and refusing them alms and\r\nsupport. (57)\r\n\r\nThe first act of open rebellion came from the Dean, who administered the\r\ncommunion during Holy Week to various persons who not only continued to\r\nhold their Indians in spite of the Bishop’s remonstrances and admonitions,\r\nbut were notoriously engaged at that very time in buying and selling\r\nslaves.  The disobedience of his subordinate could not be left unnoticed\r\nand the bishop resolved to reprimand him, but paternally, in presence of\r\nthe other clergy, as an example.   This intention was more easily formed\r\nthan executed, for the Dean refused to appear, although the first summons\r\ncame in the form of an invitation to dinner: three times was the summons\r\nrepeated but each time, on one pretext or another, it was evaded, until\r\nthere only remained to summon him officially and to censure his violation\r\nof his Bishop’s instructions and his refusal to appear before him.  As\r\neven this severe measure left him unmoved, Las Casas ordered his arrest\r\nand sent his alguacil and some of the clergy to bring the recalcitrant\r\nDean before him.  The news of what was passing had spread through the town\r\nand when the diocesan authorities went to make the arrest, quite a crowd\r\nof people had collected to see the outcome of the ecclesiastical duel.\r\nThe appearance of the Dean, being conducted by force to answer to the\r\nBishop for disobedience that had been prompted by his compliance to the\r\nSpaniards’ desires, provoked a demonstration in his favour.  He, seeing\r\nhis opportunity, began to call for help, crying: “Help me to get free,\r\ngentlemen, and I’ll confess everybody! Get me free and I’ll absolve all of\r\nyou!” A great hubbub ensued; men armed themselves to attack the Bishop’s\r\nalguacil; some barricaded the Dominicans in their convent to prevent their\r\ncoming to the assistance of the arresting party, others freed the Dean\r\nfrom his captors, and thus, with great uproar and shouts for the King and\r\nhis justice against the Bishop, the mob arrived at the latter’s house,\r\ninto which a crowd forced its way with clamorous disorder.\r\n\r\nA gentleman named Rodriguez de Villafuerte, who was in the ante-chamber in\r\ncompany with Fray Domingo de Medinilla, managed to somewhat calm the\r\nturbulence of the people.  The leaders of the mob burst into the room\r\nbeyond, where Fray Domingo had insisted that the Bishop should remain,\r\ninstead of coming out to face the rioters as he wished, insulting him in\r\nthe coarsest language and even threatening to kill him.  The storm of\r\npopular fury broke itself against the imperturbable serenity and\r\ninflexible determination with which Las Casas met and dominated it.\r\nThough the crowd dispersed, cowed and sullen, to their houses, the\r\nmurmuring continued, and the friars dared not leave their convents, for\r\nfear of provoking a fresh outbreak.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop cancelled the ecclesiastical faculties of his Dean and\r\nexcommunicated him.\r\n\r\nThe man who had threatened to kill Las Casas was the same one who had once\r\nbefore fired a musket shot through the Bishop’s window, by way of warning\r\nhim, and as he was known for a hot-headed reckless person, the friars were\r\nseriously apprehensive lest he might execute his threat; they begged Las\r\nCasas to leave and go to a place of safety.  “Where,” he asked in reply,\r\n“would you, Fathers, have me go?  Where shall I be safe as long as I act\r\nin behalf of these poor creatures?  Were the cause mine, I would drop it\r\nwith pleasure, but it is that of my flock, of these miserable Indians,\r\nwearied and oppressed by unjust slavery and insupportable tributes, which\r\nothers of my flock have imposed upon them.  Here I wish to remain; this\r\nchurch is my spouse, it is not mine to abandon.  This is the purpose of my\r\nresidence [here].  I wish to irrigate it with my blood, if they take my\r\nlife, so that zeal for God’s service may be absorbed by the very ground I\r\nhold, to make it fertile, to bring forth the fruit of desire—the end of\r\nthe injustice that stains and infects it.  This is my wish, this is my\r\ndetermined resolve, and I shall not be so fortunate that God will permit\r\nthe inhabitants of this city to fulfil it; other times have I found myself\r\nin greater dangers and, because of my unworthiness, God has withheld from\r\nme the crown of martyrdom.  These disturbances, and the hatred of the\r\nconquerors for me, are of ancient date; I no longer feel their insults nor\r\nfear their threats, and in comparison with what has happened to me in\r\nSpain and the Indies, those of the other day were very moderate.”\r\n\r\nAgainst such steadfast resolution, the colonists could not hope to\r\nprevail, and one of the first results of the violent attack upon the\r\nBishop, was a certain reaction in public sentiment when calmer Judgment\r\nreasserted itself.  There was even some counter demonstration, and the\r\nnews was brought to Las Casas that the man who had threatened to kill him\r\nhad himself been badly mauled and beaten.  The Bishop was the first and\r\nmost assiduous of the injured man’s visitors, even preparing with his own\r\nhands, bandages and ointments to dress his hurts.  Such charity and\r\nabnegation could not but touch even the rude object of these attentions,\r\nand after repeatedly begging the Bishop’s forgiveness for his recent\r\nviolence, the man attached himself to him from thenceforth, and became one\r\nof his warmest defenders.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the attacks on the Bishop and on the friars did not lessen\r\nfor long, nor was the resentment against them diminished amongst the\r\ngreater number of the colonists, who pushed their reprisals to such an\r\nextent that, not only were the priests reduced to the barest necessities\r\nof life, but even wine for the celebration of mass was wanting and\r\nunobtainable.  To remedy this necessity, Indians were sent out into the\r\nprovince to beg for the friars, but the Spaniards learned of this measure\r\nand, after forbidding the natives to give them anything, they seized\r\nwhatever these messengers obtained in spite of the prohibition, and gave\r\nthem a sound beating as a preventive of any future excursions.\r\n\r\nExistence in such surroundings was no longer possible, and the friars\r\nresolved to leave Ciudad Real.  They sent out four of their number in\r\nadvance, after which Fray Tomas de la Torre announced from the pulpit\r\ntheir intention to abandon the convent and the reasons which forced them\r\nto go.\r\n\r\nLearning from those who had gone ahead that they had been well received in\r\nChiapa, and that everything seemed propitious for the foundation of a\r\nconvent there, the community prepared to follow.  Before definitely\r\nabandoning Ciudad Real, it was thought well to deliver a final address to\r\nthe people, explaining clearly and fully the righteousness of their\r\ndoctrine concerning slavery.  This discourse was pronounced by Fray Alonso\r\nde Villabra, who cited many authorities to show that the iniquity of\r\nslavery was beyond dispute and that it was condemned by the laws of God\r\nand man alike.  The sermon failed to convince the hostile and unwilling\r\nlisteners, whose interests were bound up in slavery, and the only result\r\nof this last well-meant effort was to intensify, if possible, the\r\nirritation against the Bishop and the friars.\r\n\r\nThe reception of this interesting band of apostolic men by the people of\r\nChiapa, was in striking contrast to the menacing demonstrations which\r\nprovoked and accompanied their departure from Ciudad Real.  More than a\r\nleague outside the town, the exiles found a large number of Indians,\r\ndecked out in their best gold ornaments and plumes, carrying crosses made\r\nof feathers and flowers, awaiting their arrival, to escort them to the\r\nquarters prepared for them.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Bishop was housed, an immense number of natives came from\r\nall parts of the neighbourhood, begging to be taught the Christian\r\nreligion.  The joy of the tormented Bishop at this demonstration may be\r\nimagined, and he urged the friars, after such proofs of the disposition of\r\nthe Indians to receive the faith, to send to persuade other religious to\r\ncome and join them in the work of converting the willing people.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniard who held the encomienda of Chiapa was an astute person, in\r\nreality quite as vicious as any of the others but more adroit in\r\nconcealing his evil doings; he found small difficulty in deceiving the\r\nsimple friars and, by showing them hospitality and professing great\r\nrespect for the New Laws, he succeeded in persuading them that he was\r\ntheir friend and protector.  The harmony of their relations could not\r\nhowever remain long undisturbed; from professing friendship he passed to\r\nmore or less open acts of hostility, and from flattery he resorted to\r\ncalumny.  An incident which occurred may serve admirably to illustrate the\r\ndeceptions practised by the colonists on the ignorant Indians. One of the\r\nmore intelligent of the natives came one day to the Dominicans and spoke\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n“Fathers, behold we are becoming bewildered.  Our master told us when you\r\ncame, that he had written a letter to the Emperor _his brother_ [sic]\r\nasking that you be sent to say Mass for us and that it was by his order\r\nthat you came to live amongst us.  Since then, he tells us that you are\r\npoverty-stricken people, who come here to be supported by our labour,\r\nbecause you have not enough to eat in your own country.  He has forbidden\r\nus to give you the ground for your convent and to allow the church to be\r\naltered.  You, on the other hand, tell us we should not call him our\r\nmaster, for no man other than God whom you preach, is that; you tell us,\r\nalso, that this man is a mortal like ourselves, subject to the Emperor,\r\nKing of Castile, and that the Alcaldes at Ciudad Real may punish him.  He\r\ntells us that he is next to God and has no master in the world.  I don’t\r\nunderstand you; you speak ill of our master; he speaks ill of you, and\r\nwith all this we see you going about together good friends, neither of you\r\ndaring to speak in the other’s presence of what each tells us in the\r\nother’s absence.  If you are honest, speak clearly, for we are in a cloud\r\nof smoke from your manner of proceeding.” (58)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. - LAS CASAS REVISITS THE LAND OF WAR. AUDIENCIA OF THE\r\nCONFINES.  EVENTS AT CIUDAD REAL.  LAS CASAS RETURNS\r\n\r\n\r\nEverywhere throughout the province of Chiapa, the heart of Las Casas was\r\nwrung by a repetition of the same tales of violence and rapacity; women\r\nstolen, property wrested from the defenceless Indians, and the people\r\nbought and sold like cattle, to be mercilessly overworked until more\r\nmerciful death released them from bondage.  The Bishop was helpless,\r\nhaving no power or authority to enforce obedience either to the moral law\r\nhe perpetually preached, or to the New Laws he everywhere expounded to the\r\nobdurate colonists.  This condition of things, to which no end was\r\napparent, determined him in June, 1545, to lay the matter before the\r\nAudiencia of the Confines and to demand that the provisions of the New\r\nLaws be enforced.  To reach the town of Gracias à Dios from Ciudad Real,\r\nwhither he had returned, he took the road through Guatemala, yielding to\r\nthe entreaties of his former companion Fray Pedro de Angulo, who desired\r\nhim to see the admirable results achieved in the Tierra de Guerra.  Truly\r\nafter such disappointments, sufferings, and persecutions, the Bishop\r\ndeserved the consolation he derived from beholding the transformation of\r\nthose formerly savage idolaters, into peaceful and civilised Christians,\r\nliving in their towns in an orderly fashion far beyond what his highest\r\nhopes had allowed him to believe possible.  The caciques of the different\r\ntowns vied with one another in celebrating his arrival, and Las Casas\r\nspoke to them all in their own language and delivered to them the cedulas\r\nhe had obtained for them from the Emperor in Barcelona on May 1, 1543, in\r\nwhich their exemption from every kind of servitude was promised in\r\nperpetuity.\r\n\r\nThe journey from Tululatzan to Gracias à Dios was both a difficult and a\r\nperilous one, especially at that season when the rains had swollen the\r\nrivers and destroyed the mountain roads.  It is significant that\r\nthroughout the life of Las Casas in America, he is never once mentioned as\r\nbeing ill or obliged on account of any infirmity to defer or alter his\r\nplans.  His constitution was evidently one of steel.  In spite of his\r\nseventy-one years, he reached his destination in due time, where he met\r\nthe bishops of Guatemala and Nicaragua, the latter of whom was about to be\r\nconsecrated.  The Bishop-elect of Nicaragua was Fray Antonio de\r\nValdivieso, also a Dominican, who fully shared the opinions and sympathies\r\nof Las Casas.  All three of these prelates had grievances and petitions\r\nfor redress of abuses and for the stricter administration of the laws in\r\nfavour of the Indians, to lay before the Audiencia.  Since that particular\r\ntribunal had been created for the purpose of executing these laws and was\r\ncomposed of men whom Las Casas had either chosen himself or recommended,\r\nthe bishops were justified in anticipating a favourable hearing and a\r\nspeedy adjustment of their complaints.  They obtained neither however, and\r\nespecially towards Las Casas was the opposition of the auditors directed.\r\nWhen he first entered the council room, some of them cried: “Out with that\r\nlunatic!” and on another occasion, when Las Casas declined to withdraw,\r\nthe President, Maldonado (well named indeed!), ordered him to be ejected\r\nby force.  Again, when the Bishop, with great solemnity, demanded that the\r\nAudiencia should correct the abuses complained of and should relieve the\r\nIndians from unlawful oppression, Maldonado answered: “You are a cheat, a\r\nbad man, a bad bishop, a shameful fellow, and you deserve to be\r\npunished.”(59)\r\n\r\nSuch language in open council, addressed by the presiding officer to a\r\nbishop, sounds incredible, and considering the great influence of religion\r\non all Spaniards of that time, it is not wonderful that after such\r\ninsolence, this petty official was regarded by the entire community as\r\nexcommunicated; a half-hearted apology, ungraciously made, sufficed\r\nhowever to avoid an open scandal.\r\n\r\nLas Casas had already assured his friars in Ciudad Real that he neither\r\nfelt insults nor feared threats, so the vulgar abuse of Maldonado did not\r\ntouch him; he drew up and presented a wordy memorial to the Audiencia,\r\ndivided into seven articles. The first article affirmed that the Bishop\r\nwas hindered in the exercise of his ecclesiastical jurisdiction, by the\r\nopposition of the officers of justice.  The second asks for the aid of the\r\nsecular arm to punish those guilty of disobedience and sacrilege.  The\r\nthird asks that the Indians may be relieved from tyrannous oppression,\r\nparticularly from the excessive taxes and forced labour exacted from them.\r\nThe fourth article solicits the transfer of all causes affecting the\r\nIndians from the civil to the ecclesiastical courts.  The fifth begs the\r\nAudiencia to forbid all wars, conquests, invasions of territory, and the\r\nestablishment of Spanish haciendas in Yucatan.  The sixth article\r\npetitions orders for the good treatment of the few Indians still held by\r\nthe Crown in Yucatan, and the seventh asks that the officials of the\r\nAudiencia transfer to the Crown, all Indians and all villages affected by\r\nthe royal ordinances already published.  The answer of the Audiencia was\r\nbrief and amounted to a denial of the Bishop’s allegations. (60)\r\nForeseeing, doubtless, the rupture which must inevitably follow the\r\npresentation of his memorial, Las Casas had already written to Prince\r\nPhilip, regent during the Emperor’s absence from Spain.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of October, a letter signed by the Bishops of Chiapa and\r\nNicaragua was despatched to Prince Philip complaining of the conduct of\r\nthe Audiencia towards the churches, and declaring that since the New Laws\r\nwere ignored and left in abeyance, the cruel treatment of the Indians had\r\nincreased.  It was alleged that the President, Maldonado, and his\r\nassociates possessed more than 60,000 Indians and that he encouraged his\r\ngovernors in every kind of tyranny and robbery of the natives for all of\r\nwhich the too compliant Audiencia neglected to provide any remedy.  The\r\ndestitute and helpless condition of the bishops and clergy was set forth,\r\nand they were described as the only faithful subjects whom the sovereign\r\nhad in those regions, for all the other royal officials were solely\r\noccupied with their own interests and in opposing the clergy in the\r\ndischarge of their pastoral duties.  The two bishops urged upon the Prince\r\nto liberate all the Indians absolutely and immediately, as the only means\r\nto stop the growing evil.  The more to impress the Prince with the\r\nindependent spirit of the colonial officials in ignoring royal orders and\r\nviolating the express provisions of the New Laws, the bishops affirmed\r\nthat most of them—with but few exceptions—were even inclined to\r\nindependence and were secretly as much rebels as those in Peru.  An\r\nincrease in the number of bishops was asked of the Prince, with new\r\ndioceses in Yucatan and Chiapa, which were too extensive for one bishop to\r\ngovern.  It plainly appears in this letter that the writers were aware\r\nthat the Audiencia had written, asking that a metropolitan judge should be\r\nsent out with superior powers of jurisdiction to hold them in check, but\r\nfar from opposing this project, they agreed to it, suggesting, however,\r\nthat he should be a papal legate and that meanwhile, until such a one\r\ncould arrive, some one of the bishops should be deputed to hear appeals\r\nand decide cases with arch-episcopal powers.\r\n\r\nThe scandalous affair of the Dean in Ciudad Real was also recounted to the\r\nPrince and some displeasure expressed that the Bishop of Guatemala,\r\nMarroquin, should have seen fit to receive this rebellious priest in his\r\ndiocese.  Priests, however, were so scarce, that any one who could say a\r\nmass and baptise a pagan, no matter what his defects of character or\r\nconduct might be, was apt to be welcomed.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of November, Las Casas addressed a letter to the India Council\r\nrepeating his grave charges against Maldonado and explaining the reasons\r\nwhy he connived at resistance to the New Laws.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously the Audiencia likewise wrote to the Council giving their\r\nversion of the situation. This letter was not signed by the licentiate\r\nHerrera, one of the auditors, who afterwards wrote to the Emperor,\r\nexplaining and justifying his abstention, by saying that he disapproved of\r\nthe violent language used against the bishops and did not share the views\r\nof his associates concerning them.  Although he found Las Casas\r\nover-zealous, he considered that the Indians were harshly treated and that\r\nthe Audiencia failed to protect them against oppression.  They would even\r\nbe better off in slavery than they were in their present condition, for\r\nthen at least their owners might care for them.\r\n\r\nPerhaps nothing could more completely vindicate Las Casas than the\r\ncontents of this letter.(61) Herrera was almost alone, however, in siding\r\nwith the Bishop for even those of the colonists whose temporal interests\r\nwere not at stake in the question of liberating the Indians, were\r\nunwilling to antagonise the Audiencia and to face the condemnation of\r\ntheir fellow-citizens.  Even the Bishop of Guatemala, who had formerly\r\nbeen a close friend and warm sympathiser, proved unequal to the pressure\r\nbrought to bear upon him. He deserted his fellow-bishop, and his letter of\r\nAugust 17, 1545, to the Emperor, was singularly unworthy of his episcopal\r\ncharacter, especially when dealing with one of equal dignity to his\r\nown.(62)\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, news of the gravest and most disquieting nature reached\r\nLas Casas from Canon Juan Perera, whom he had left as Vicar-General at\r\nCiudad Real during his own absence.  Armed with powers granted by the town\r\nauthorities, Luis de Torre Medinilla and the alguacil mayor, Diego Garcia,\r\nhad presented themselves to the Canon to institute an inquiry into the\r\ncases in which the Bishop had ordered absolution to be refused, founding\r\ntheir action upon the terms of Alexander VI.’s Bull, which gave the Indies\r\nto the kings of Castile; from the terms of the Bull they deduced the right\r\nof conquest and the disposal of the persons and property of the conquered\r\nnatives.\r\n\r\nThe Canon stood firm, however, declaring that he could only grant\r\nabsolution to those who released their slaves and restored—as far as\r\npossible—their ill-gotten profits.  They asked that his answer should be\r\ngiven them in writing, as they wished to refer it to the Pope, to which\r\nthe Canon agreed on condition that he be allowed thirty days in which to\r\nprepare a properly expressed statement.  The period fixed elapsed without\r\nthe authorities again asking for the document, for they had devised a new\r\nplan to overreach the Bishop.  They offered the Canon the keys of the\r\nchurch if he would accept them as curate, abandoning his character as\r\nVicar-General of the Bishop, promising him a generous salary and other\r\nadvantages if he would agree.  The Canon did not agree but reported the\r\nsituation faithfully to Las Casas, who thus learned that his spiritual\r\nsubjects were in open rebellion against his authority.\r\n\r\nThe Audiencia had ended by agreeing to send an auditor to Ciudad Real to\r\nsee that the New Laws were executed, and a gentleman of Santiago de\r\nNicaragua wrote the news of this decision to the Council saying, “The\r\nBishop is returning to this country to complete the destruction of this\r\nunhappy city, bringing with him an auditor to still further tax the\r\ncountry.  We don’t know how it is that your lordships do not remedy such\r\ngreat evils.”  An open council was held on December 15, 1545, which was\r\nattended by all the householders of the town, and upon opening the\r\nsitting, the secretary called attention to the fact that the Bishop had\r\nbeen exercising his episcopal authority without having shown the required\r\npapal bulls or royal cedulas to the Council; moreover he had introduced\r\nnovel doctrines, reserving certain cases for absolution, concerning which,\r\nthe Emperor’s final decision had not yet been received in reply to the\r\npetition addressed to His Majesty; as it was evident to them all that the\r\nBishop’s ideas, if acceded to by the colonists would result in the total\r\nruin of them all and a general rebellion of the Indians, it was incumbent\r\nupon them to notify the Bishop that he must follow the example of other\r\nbishops in the colonies, abandoning his novelties until the return of the\r\nprocurator, who had been sent to Spain to present the colonists’ appeal on\r\nthese matters, when the Emperor’s decision would be made known; any\r\ndisturbances which might arise from the present unsettled state of feeling\r\nmust be laid to the Bishop’s charge.  These sentiments encountered general\r\napproval, and it was unanimously decided that should Las Casas refuse to\r\nacquiesce in them, they would refuse to receive him as their lawful bishop\r\nand would suppress his tithes. This last decision was published and a fine\r\nof one hundred castellanos imposed on any one violating it.\r\n\r\nFray Tomas de la Torre learned of these decisions and sent from\r\nCinacatlan, where he then was, to warn a lay brother, Fray Pedro Martin,\r\nand a servant of the Bishop who were in Cuidad Real, and to advise them to\r\nput the Bishop’s books and household goods in a place of safety, for he\r\nfeared that in the excitement, popular resentment might burst all bounds\r\nand everything belonging to Las Casas might be destroyed.  His warning was\r\nnot unwarranted, for the two men were obliged to fortify themselves as\r\nbest they could in the sacristy of the church, where they were attacked at\r\nmidnight by a body of men, who were determined to expel them from the\r\ntown.  After besieging them in vain for some time, the attacking party\r\nleft, intending to return by daylight, but the besieged took advantage of\r\ntheir absence to escape and managed to reach Cinacatlan barefoot, where\r\ntheir account of the state of things in the town greatly increased the\r\nanxiety of the friars.\r\n\r\nWhile these turbulent events were happening, Las Casas had arrived at the\r\nDominican monastery at Copanabastla on his way to Ciudad Real, where it\r\nwas his intention to celebrate Christmas in his cathedral; he took the\r\nprecaution of sending a trusty messenger ahead, who brought back a full\r\naccount of the decisions of the Council and the preparations for resisting\r\nthe Bishop’s entrance.  On his way back to Copanabastla this messenger\r\npassed by Cinacatlan and told the friars of the Bishop’s whereabouts, so\r\nthey also wrote him full information of all that had happened and the kind\r\nof reception awaiting him in the city.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of Ciudad Real were also kept informed of the Bishop’s\r\napproach and, with unswerving resolution, began to take their measures to\r\nstop his advance unless he accepted their conditions; pickets were\r\nestablished at different points of the road to give warning of his\r\napproach.  Singular indeed was the activity displayed in arming as large a\r\nforce of men as could be mustered, to oppose this aged monk who, like his\r\napostolic forebears, came alone, on foot, with a staff in his hand and\r\nneither purse nor scrip. Although there were not wanting those among the\r\nfriars who counselled him not to brave the popular fury, Las Casas refused\r\nto follow their advice, saying: “If I do not go to Ciudad Real, I banish\r\nmyself voluntarily from my own church and it may be said of me, with\r\nreason, the wicked fleeth, when no man pursueth.  How do we know that they\r\nwant to kill me and that the sentinels are placed for this express\r\npurpose?  I do not doubt the truth of what the fathers at Cinacatlan say,\r\nbut there are our Lord’s words to his disciples when they sought to deter\r\nhim from returning to Judea, because they [the Jews] had sought to kill\r\nhim the day before.  The day has twelve hours, in each one of which, or in\r\neach minute or in each instant, the minds of men may change.  If I do not\r\nenter into my church, of whom may I complain to the King and the Pope for\r\nputting me out of it?”\r\n\r\nThe Bishop’s serenity was as perfect as his resolution was unchangeable,\r\nand, gathering his scapular in his hand, he rose from his chair and set\r\nout on his journey, amidst the tears and remonstrances of the friars.\r\nUpon reaching the first post of sentinels he found the men off their\r\nguard, as a report had spread that he had abandoned his intention to\r\nadvance.  The Indians, when they recognised him, completely forgot the\r\norders they had received from their Spanish masters, and in mingled joy at\r\nseeing their beloved Bishop again and distress at being there under such\r\nduty, they threw themselves at his feet, weeping, protesting, and\r\nimploring his forgiveness for their compulsory part in opposing him.(63)\r\nKnowing that the poor creatures would pay dearly for their neglect of\r\norders, Las Casas had them bound, as though he had surprised and captured\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThat night Ciudad Real was shaken by a terrible earthquake which drove the\r\nfrightened people into the public square.  Talking amongst themselves,\r\nsome declared that this upheaval heralded the Bishop’s approach and was\r\nthe beginning of the destruction he would bring upon their town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX. - OPPOSITION TO LAS CASAS.  HE LEAVES CIUDAD REAL.  THE\r\nMEXICAN SYNOD\r\n\r\n\r\nAt dawn Las Casas entered the city unnoticed and reached his cathedral,\r\nfrom whence he sent Father Nicola Galiano, one of the clergy, to notify\r\nthe Council of his arrival and that he was awaiting them.  The Bishop’s\r\narrival, did in reality, cause a greater disturbance than the earthquake.\r\nThe members of the Council debated as to what was now to be done; the\r\nBishop was in the city and in his cathedral, despite their efforts to\r\nexclude him.  Finally it was decided to go in a body to the church, where\r\nthey seated themselves as though for a sermon.  When the Bishop entered\r\nfrom the sacristy to speak to them, no one rose or showed any of the\r\ncustomary marks of respect.   The notary immediately read the\r\n“requirement” it had been their intention to present before Las Casas was\r\nadmitted to the city, omitting however the passages which denied his\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nLas Casas replied to this with great benevolence, saying that as he was\r\nready even to shed his blood for them, he had no intention of interfering\r\nwith their properties except in so far as was necessary to prevent sin\r\nagainst God and their neighbour: he exhorted them to consider matters\r\ncalmly and not to allow themselves to be carried away by irreflection.\r\nHis manner, as well as the sense of this speech, were surprisingly\r\nconciliatory, but one of the council, less impressed by the persuasive\r\neloquence of the Bishop, observed from his place that as Las Casas was but\r\na private individual, he had presumed too far in summoning such an\r\nimportant body as the council, composed of the most illustrious gentlemen\r\nof the colony, to come to meet him, instead of going himself to them.  The\r\nBishop, with much dignity, answered; “Look you, sir,—and all of you in\r\nwhose name he has spoken,—when I wish to ask anything from your estates, I\r\nwill go to your houses to speak with you; but when I have to speak with\r\nyou concerning God’s service and what touches your souls and consciences,\r\nit is for me to send and call you to come to wherever I may be, and it is\r\nfor you to come trooping to me, if you are Christians.”  Nobody ventured\r\nto reply to this rebuke and the Bishop, rising immediately withdrew,\r\ntowards the sacristy.  Then the notary of the council approached him\r\nrespectfully, saying that he had a petition to present on behalf of the\r\ntownspeople, which there was no need to read as it merely asked that they\r\nshould be treated as a Christian people and have confessors appointed to\r\ngrant them absolution.  The Bishop assented, but as he named the Canon\r\nJuan Perera and the Dominicans, who all notoriously shared his views on\r\nthe question in dispute, the council demurred, saying that they were\r\nunacceptable.  The Bishop therefore named a priest from Guatemala and a\r\nMercedarian friar, whose sentiments he knew to be in harmony with his own,\r\nthough they had taken no part in the controversies and hence their opinion\r\nhad never been publicly manifested.  Both were men of exemplary piety and\r\nzeal in their ministry.  Even Fray Vicente Ferrer, who accompanied the\r\nBishop, was unaware of the real sympathies of the two confessors, and\r\nfearing his superior was unwittingly making a blunder, he tugged at his\r\nvestments saying: “Let your lordship rather die than do this.”\r\n\r\nImmediately those present broke forth into imprecations on Fray Vicente\r\nand all but maltreated him, in the midst of which uproar, the Mercedarian\r\nfriars, who had heard of the Bishop’s return, appeared in the church to\r\nwelcome him.  The disturbance was somewhat quelled by their arrival, and\r\nthey managed to conduct the Bishop and the offending Fray Vicente in\r\nsafety to their own convent.\r\n\r\nThe fatigue of the journey and the excitement of these disturbing scenes\r\nthrough which he had passed left the aged Bishop exhausted, but his trials\r\nhad in reality only just begun, and hardly had he seated himself in the\r\ncell the friars provided for him, to take a little bread and wine, when a\r\nfearful uproar was heard outside, which proved to be caused by an immense\r\ncrowd of armed people who had surrounded the convent.  Some of these men\r\nforced their way into his presence, but so great was the noise and clamour\r\nthat the friars, who sought to learn the cause of this hostile\r\ndemonstration, could neither hear nor make themselves heard. Finally it\r\nappeared that this fresh outburst was occasioned by the discovery that the\r\nBishop had captured and bound their Indian sentinels as prisoners.  Las\r\nCasas at once assumed the entire blame, explaining exactly how he had\r\nsurprised them and why he had bound them.  A storm of vituperation greeted\r\nhis explanation—all semblance of respect, either for his age or office,\r\nwas abandoned—and one taunted the protector of the Indians with himself\r\ntying them up and draging them three leagues.(64) Amidst all these\r\nreproaches and insults Las Casas replied to one of his tormentors saying:\r\n“I do not wish, sir, to answer you, so as not to take from God the task of\r\npunishing you, for the insult you offer is not to me but to God.”\r\n\r\nWhile this scene of violence was proceeding inside the Bishop’s cell, his\r\nnegro servant Juanillo was being baited in the courtyard where some one\r\nwho accused him of tying the Indians, gave him a thrust with his pike,\r\nwhich laid him, wounded, on the ground.  The friars rushed to the rescue\r\nof the unfortunate negro and two of the younger monks finally succeeded in\r\ngetting all the armed men out of their convent.\r\n\r\nAll these riotous happenings had taken place between dawn and nine\r\no’clock, and so true was the Bishop’s saying that in each hour of the\r\ntwelve, men changed their minds, that before noon order was not only\r\nentirely established, but the extraordinary spectacle was offered of the\r\nmembers of the same council who had insulted and outraged the Bishop,\r\ncoming in great humility to the convent, accompanied by the alcaldes,\r\nwithout their wands of office or their swords, to beg his forgiveness and\r\nto acknowledge him as their rightful Bishop.  Not content with this act of\r\nreparation, they carried him in procession from the convent to the house\r\nof Pedro Orozco de Acevedo, one of the principal citizens, where an\r\napartment was prepared for his habitation.  To complete this\r\ntransformation and illustrate even more fully the vagaries of the human\r\ntemper, they determined to celebrate his arrival by holding a grand\r\ntournament in his honour, the day after Christmas.  Remesal does not say\r\nwhether this form of festivity met with the Bishop’s approval, but it may\r\nbe permitted to imagine that had he been consulted, he would have found\r\nsome more fit means for celebrating the reconciliation.\r\n\r\nLas Casas was probably not at all duped by the sudden conversion of his\r\nenemies, which was indeed more indicative of a mercurial and capricious\r\ntemperament than of a sincere desire to make amends for their conduct: the\r\nreal reason of these sudden demonstrations must be sought in the fears\r\nthat were aroused in the minds of the better citizens, of the punishment\r\nsure to fall upon them, when the news of their actions should reach Spain.\r\n\r\nProofs of their bad faith are not far to seek.  Even while the festivities\r\nwere preparing, a body of men rode off to Cinacatlan where they robbed and\r\nterrorised the Indians, bullied and threatened the frairs, and finally\r\nreturned with great rejoicings to Ciudad Real.  The friars being in no way\r\ndeceived, for they also understood but too well the volatile character of\r\nthe Spaniards, took the precaution of provisioning the Bishop, so that he\r\nmight not be starved out when popular resentment should again nullify the\r\npresent reconciliation.\r\n\r\nThe Indian porters who were to carry these provisions, were so fearful of\r\nbeing set upon and beaten or even killed by the Spaniards, that it was\r\nonly after much persuasion that they consented to deliver them:\r\nfortunately they were not molested and the supplies reached their\r\ndestination intact.\r\n\r\nA short time after these events, the Auditor, Juan Rogel, sent by the\r\nAudiencia of the Confines, arrived at Ciudad Real just as the Bishop was\r\npreparing for his journey to Mexico where one Francisco Tello de Sandoval,\r\nwhom the Emperor had sent as Visitor-General of New Spain, had convoked a\r\nmeeting of all the bishops and prelates in America to confer upon the\r\nvexed questions concerning the Indians, about which opinion was so divided\r\nas to render hopeless any acceptable legislation from Madrid.  The\r\ncelebrated Sepulveda, one of the most learned scholars and ablest men of\r\nhis times, led the opposition to the doctrines of Las Casas and sustained\r\nthe theory that servitude was the rightful and natural state of the\r\nIndians and that it was justifiable to subdue them by force to Spanish\r\nrule.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of November, 1545, the Emperor, in response to the arguments\r\nand petitions of the representatives of the colonists, had abrogated the\r\nmost important articles of the New Laws—in fact had substantially revoked\r\nthem, though this action was not yet known in Chiapa, where the Bishop\r\nreceived the Auditor Rogel, to whom he highly praised the New Laws, whose\r\napplication was the object of Rogel’s visit.  The Auditor, after hearing\r\nhim out, said: “Your lordship well knows that though these New Laws and\r\nOrdinances were framed in Valladolid by the agreement of such grave\r\npersonages,—as your lordship and I witnessed—one of the reasons which has\r\nrendered them so hateful in the Indies has been the fact that your\r\nlordship had a hand in proposing and framing them: for the conquerors\r\nconsider your lordship so prejudiced against them, that they believe that\r\nwhat you obtain for the natives is not so much for love of the Indians as\r\nfor hatred of them.  Entertaining such a suspicion, they would feel it\r\nmore, were I to deprive them while your lordship is present, than the loss\r\nitself of their slaves and estates; Señor Don Francisco Tello de Sandoval\r\nhas summoned your lordship to this meeting of prelates which takes place\r\nin Mexico and I would be glad if you would prepare for your journey and\r\nhasten your departure, for until your lordship is gone I can do nothing.\r\nI do not want it said that I am doing what is necessary out of respect, as\r\neverything would thereby be lost.”\r\n\r\nThis plain speaking, in which Las Casas recognised much truth, convinced\r\nhim that by remaining, he would only retard the cause he desired to help,\r\nso he quickly completed his preparations and left Ciudad Real in the first\r\nweek of Lent in 1546, hardly a year after his first entrance into it.  His\r\ndeparture was signalised by some demonstrations of sympathy, and a few\r\npeople accompanied him as far as Cinacatlan, where he remained for several\r\ndays counselling with the friars concerning the stand to be taken on\r\nIndian matters in the council or synod he was going to attend in Mexico.\r\n\r\nAs the other American bishops disapproved of his action in refusing the\r\nsacraments to slave-holders and the Visitor General, Tello de Sandoval,\r\nhad already written him a sharp letter of reproof for his imprudence in\r\nobstinately persisting in his views despite the fact that he was alone in\r\nholding them, formidable opposition would have to be encountered in the\r\nsynod.  Neither Las Casas nor his Dominican brethren were at all dismayed\r\nby their isolation, nor did they for a moment consider the possibility of\r\nabandoning or even relaxing their convictions.  The Canon, Juan Perera,\r\nwho had stood loyally by his Bishop, assisted at these conferences, but as\r\nhe had previously expressed contrary opinions, he desired to make an act\r\nof public reparation for his past errors.  He returned to Ciudad Real\r\nespecially to preach a sermon of retraction and to read a paper prepared\r\nfor him by Fray Tomas de la Torre, containing a full vindication of his\r\nBishop’s opinions.  This recantation produced no small effect upon the\r\ncolonists, some of whom were moved to express regret for their part in the\r\nmaltreatment of Las Casas and the friars.  This business terminated, the\r\nCanon rejoined Las Casas at Cinacatlan and accompanied him to Mexico.\r\n\r\nBefore setting forth on his last journey, the Bishop transferred his\r\nproperty to the Dominicans and, though there was a conditional clause in\r\nthe deed of gift, there was no reservation in the donor’s mind, for he\r\nknew that he was leaving Chiapa for ever and would never again govern a\r\ndiocese.  Accompanied by the friars Rodrigo Ladrada, Vicente Ferrer, and\r\nLuis Cancer and by the Canon Perera he journeyed to Antequera in the\r\nprovince of Oaxaca—the marquisate of Cortes—where he was received in the\r\nDominican convent.  But so intense and wide-spread was the feeling against\r\nhim that both the Viceroy and the Visitor-General wrote to him that he\r\nshould not advance farther towards Mexico, until they summoned him, lest\r\nhis appearance might provoke a disturbance.  The march of a hostile army\r\nupon a defenceless city could hardly have stirred up greater excitement\r\nthan the arrival of this aged Bishop with his four humble companions.  He\r\nfinally entered the city of Mexico at ten o’clock one morning, and not\r\nonly was there no disturbance of the peace when he was recognised, but his\r\nfollowers even heard some comments of admiration for him as he passed\r\nthrough the streets to the Dominican monastery where he was to lodge.\r\n\r\nThe very day of his arrival, Las Casas betrayed his lack of those\r\nconciliatory qualities, without which no man can negotiate debatable\r\nquestions with any hope of success.  During his several visits to Spain,\r\nwhere he handled delicate questions with consummate skill, he had shown\r\ntact in seeking to disarm opposition and conciliate opponents, but in\r\nMexico he displayed no wordly wisdom whatsoever.  He replied to the\r\nmessage of the Viceroy and the auditors who sent to welcome him, that he\r\nwould not visit them as they were excommunicated because they had cut off\r\nthe hand of a priest in Antequera.\r\n\r\nThe news of this message was spread throughout the city and still further\r\ninflamed the popular ire against him.  Just at a time when so much\r\ndepended upon winning supporters to his side and conciliating, as far as\r\npossible, the conflicting principles of the contending parties, Las Casas\r\nalienated the powerful Viceroy and the auditors, and rendered himself\r\ninaccessible to any possible overtures from the more reasonable and\r\nmoderate men of the opposition, whom it should have been his first duty to\r\nplacate by every possible concession.\r\n\r\nThe synod or council was composed of the five bishops of Mexico, Chiapa,\r\nGuatemala, Oaxaca, and Mechoacan, with possibly a sixth from Tiazcala;\r\nbesides these, there were the prelates and chief theologians of the\r\nreligious orders, and finally, all the learned men of the colony.  The\r\noutcome of their deliberations was contained in eight propositions, of\r\nwhich the five principal ones were as follows:\r\n\r\n 1.1. All infidels, of whatsoever sect or religion they may be or whatever\r\n      may be their sins, hold and possess in conformity with the natural\r\n      and divine law and the law of nations, the property they acquire\r\n      without prejudice to others; and likewise their principalities,\r\n      kingdoms, estates, lordships, dignities, and jurisdictions.\r\n 2.2. Although four different classes of infidels exist, there is but one\r\n      method instituted by divine providence for teaching the true\r\n      religion, namely, persuading the understanding by reasoning and\r\n      attracting the will by gentleness. This is common to all men in the\r\n      world, without regard to difference of errors or sects, or\r\n      corruption of morals.\r\n 3.3. The sole and final cause why the Apostolic See granted supreme\r\n      sovereignty and imperial jurisdiction over the Indies to the Kings\r\n      of Castile and Leon was the preaching of the Gospel, the spread of\r\n      the Christian religion, and the conversion of the nations of those\r\n      regions, and not to increase their dignity or to make them richer\r\n      princes than they were.\r\n 4.4. The Holy See, in granting the said supreme sovereignty, did not\r\n      intend to deprive the native sovereigns and rulers of their estates,\r\n      lordships, jurisdiction, honours, and dignities, nor did it intend\r\n      to give the Kings of Castile and Leon any license by which the\r\n      spread of the Gospel should be impeded and the conversion of the\r\n      people of those regions be retarded.\r\n 5.5. The said sovereigns of Castile, who offered and bound themselves of\r\n      their own choice to see that the faith was preached and the Indians\r\n      converted, are obliged by divine precept to bear the necessary\r\n      expenses for accomplishing these ends.\r\n\r\nThese were the most important of the eight articles approved by the synod,\r\nand they were grounded upon and defended by a multitude of arguments drawn\r\nfrom the Fathers and General Councils: they were not adopted without\r\nopposition, and every point was fought over in endless debates, for the\r\nconquerors and all holders of encomiendas contested stoutly for what they\r\nheld to be their rights.  The synod also established the conditions on\r\nwhich sacraments should be administered to the colonists, and addressed a\r\nfull report of the proceedings to the Emperor, soliciting his confirmation\r\nand the royal authority for executing all that had been enacted.\r\n\r\nAlthough Las Casas had several times essayed to bring the question of\r\nslavery before the council, no direct or explicit decision was given on\r\nthat important point, and as his efforts were embarrassing, the Viceroy\r\nquickly told him that reasons of State had compelled him to defer a\r\ndefinite solution of that question.  Far from quieting Las Casas, this\r\ninformation aroused his zeal all the more, and as a hearing in the council\r\nwas denied him, he preached a few days later when the Viceroy was present,\r\ntaking for his text this significant passage from the thirtieth chapter of\r\nthe prophet Isaias: “For this is a rebellious people; lying children,\r\nchildren that will not hear the law of God.  Who say to the seers, see\r\nnot; and to the prophets, prophesy not right things unto us; speak unto us\r\nsmooth things, prophesy deceits.”\r\n\r\nThe sermon was not without the intended effect, and the Viceroy began to\r\nregret the exclusion of the subject of slavery from the council: as a\r\ncompromise, he consented that separate meetings should be held in the\r\nconvent of San Domingo to consider this subject, offering to transmit to\r\nthe Emperor the conclusions adopted.  Las Casas was ably seconded in the\r\nproceedings of these meetings, by Fray Luis Cancer, and a declaration was\r\ndrawn up declaring that the Indians—with few exceptions—had been unjustly\r\nenslaved and that those who held them were bound to set them free:\r\nslave-holders were described as tyrants and all personal services exacted\r\nfrom the defenceless natives were condemned.  Those who took part in these\r\nmeetings and signed the decisions, were destitute of any means to give\r\neffect to them, but they adopted measures to publish and distribute copies\r\nof them throughout the colonies, in the hope that they might influence\r\npublic opinion in the right direction.\r\n\r\nLas Casas named the Canon, Juan Perera, as his Vicar-General in the\r\ndiocese of Chiapa, on the ninth of November, 1546, and at the same time\r\nappointed as confessors the friars Tomas Casillas, Tomas de la Torre,\r\nDomingo de Arana, and Alonso de Villabra, to whom he furnished copies of\r\nthe instructions approved by the council of Mexico, in which were\r\ncomprised the twelve rules.  The colonists appealed to the Emperor against\r\nthe instructions, which they held to be unduly severe and onerous for\r\nthem, and, in reply to their petition, a royal order dated in Valladolid\r\non the twenty-eighth of November, 1542, was received by the Audiencia of\r\nMexico ordering a copy of the disputed regulations to be sent to Spain for\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the year 1547, Las Casas arrived in Vera Cruz to\r\nembark for Spain, and after some delay there, until a ship could be found\r\nfor the voyage, left the shores of America for the last time(65)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX. - LAS CASAS ARRIVES AT VALLADOLID.  THE THIRTY PROPOSITIONS.\r\nDEBATE WITH GINES DE SEPULVEDA\r\n\r\n\r\nRejected by his flock in Chiapa, abused and denounced by the Spanish\r\ncolonists in America, the venerable Bishop’s arrival in his native country\r\nwas preceded by accusations intended to prejudice the young Prince, Don\r\nPhilip, who was regent during the Emperor’s absence, against him.  Long\r\nyears of championship of an unpopular cause rendered him impervious to\r\nthese baseless attacks of his enemies.  At a time of life when most men\r\nthink to rest, Las Casas prepared himself with undiminished vigour to\r\ncontinue the struggle in the cause of freedom.  Upon his arrival in Spain,\r\nhe repaired at once to Valladolid where the court was usually in\r\nresidence, only to find that Don Philip had gone to hold a Córtes in the\r\nkingdom of Aragon.  With his habitual promptness, the Bishop followed him\r\nthither, and was received with great kindness by the Prince, who, after\r\nlistening attentively to all that he had to recount, wrote to the\r\nDominicans in Chiapa commending their conduct and offering to send more\r\nmen of their Order to reinforce them, if they were required.\r\n\r\nThe Indians were ever uppermost in the mind of Las Casas and he likewise\r\nobtained that the Prince should write letters to the caciques in Chiapa\r\nand Tuzulutlan, who had become Christians, congratulating them on their\r\nconversion, praising their zeal, of which the Bishop had informed him, and\r\nurging them to follow the counsels of their Dominican friends.  To\r\ncelebrate his pacific victory in the “Land of War,” Las Casas also had the\r\nsinister name Tuzulutlan officially changed to that of Vera Paz or True\r\nPeace.\r\n\r\nThe formal resignation of Las Casas from the diocese of Chiapa was made\r\nknown to the Spanish Ambassador in Rome, Don Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, in\r\na letter from the Emperor dated September 11, 1550, with instructions to\r\nannounce the same to the Pope and to present the name of Fray Tomas\r\nCasillas for the vacant bishopric.\r\n\r\nMention has been made of the _Confesionario_, or book of instructions\r\nwritten by the Bishop of Chiapa and distributed to the clergy of his\r\ndiocese.  In this little manual, Las Casas demonstrated that the armed\r\ninvasion of America by the Spaniards and the conquest of the various\r\ncountries were contrary to all right and justice: he argued that the Bull\r\nof donation given by Alexander VI. charged the Spanish sovereigns with the\r\nright, or rather the duty, of converting the inhabitants of the New World\r\nto Christianity; once their conversion was effected, they might be\r\ninduced, if possible, by gentle and pacific means to place themselves\r\nunder Spanish rule.  Arguing from these premises, the Bishop directed his\r\nclergy to refuse absolution and the sacraments to all who refused to\r\nliberate their slaves or continued to oppress and rob the natives.\r\n\r\nReduced to a formula the doctrine of Las Casas may be summed up: Convert\r\nthe Indians first and they will afterwards become Spanish subjects; as\r\nagainst the contention of his adversaries that they must first be\r\nconquered, after which their conversion would follow.\r\n\r\nHis enemies were not slow in seizing upon these definitions and in\r\ntwisting them into a denial of the sovereign rights of the Crown.  Formal\r\ndenunciations of the teachings contained in the _Confesionario_ were laid\r\nbefore the India Council, (66) and that body having summoned Las Casas to\r\nexplain his doctrines in writing, he submitted an exposition of the\r\ncontents of his book, in the form of thirty propositions, the substance of\r\nwhich may be summarised as follows: (67)\r\n\r\n 1.1. The power and authority which the Pope holds from Jesus Christ,\r\n      extends over all men, whether they be Christians or infidels, as far\r\n      as everything touching their salvation is concerned.  Their exercise\r\n      should, however, be different over pagans than over those who have\r\n      received or have refused to receive the true faith.\r\n 2.2. The primacy of the Pope imposes upon him the obligation to diffuse\r\n      the Christian religion throughout the world and to see that the\r\n      Gospel is preached to the heathen wherever they will receive it.\r\n 3.3. The Pope is bound to choose proper missioners for such propaganda.\r\n 4.4. It is evident that Christian rulers are his most suitable and\r\n      efficient assistants in this work.\r\n 5.5. The Pope is free to invite or justified in obliging Christian rulers\r\n      to lend their help, by the exercise of their power, by the\r\n      expenditure of money, and by sending suitable men to conduct\r\n      missions.\r\n 6.6. The Pope and the Christian sovereigns should act together for this\r\n      end, in agreement with one another.\r\n 7.7. The Pope may distribute heathen lands among Christian rulers,\r\n      designating where each is to labour for the conversion of the\r\n      infidels.\r\n 8.8. Such distribution should be made, however, for the purpose of\r\n      ensuring the instruction and the conversion of the pagan nations but\r\n      not at all to increase the territories of the Christian sovereign or\r\n      to augment his revenues, titles, and honours, at the expense of the\r\n      natives.\r\n 9.9. It may follow that Christian princes may incidentally derive some\r\n      profit from this conversion of such infidels, and all such may be\r\n      permitted to them, but the primary object must be the propagation of\r\n      the Faith, the extension of the Church, and the service of God.\r\n10.10. Native kings and rulers hold their authority and jurisdiction by a\r\n      just title and have a right to the obedience of their lawful\r\n      subjects, nor should they be deposed or violently treated.\r\n11.11. Injustice, cruelty, and every form of wickedness are produced by\r\n      the violation of this law.\r\n12.12. Neither idolatry nor any kind of sin justifies Christians in\r\n      usurping the authority of native rulers or in seizing the lands and\r\n      goods of their subjects.\r\n13.13. As long as such infidels have not opposed the propagation of the\r\n      Gospel and have not refused to receive the Faith preached to them,\r\n      no Christian tribunal or judge has a right to punish them for the\r\n      practice of idolatry or for the commission of any sins, no matter\r\n      how heinous.\r\n14.14. The New World was discovered during the pontificate of Alexander\r\n      VI., hence that pontiff was obliged to designate some Christian\r\n      prince under whose protection the propagation of the Faith should be\r\n      carried on.\r\n15.15. Since the Catholic sovereigns of Spain, Ferdinand and Isabella, had\r\n      protected and aided Columbus in making his discovery, and had,\r\n      moreover, expelled the Mahometans from their land, the Pope\r\n      perceived the special claims they had to receive this privilege, and\r\n      the great advantages to religion of confiding this mission to them.\r\n16.16. The Pope, having authority to grant such a privilege, has power\r\n      likewise to annul, revoke, or suspend it for just cause; or he may\r\n      transfer it to some other ruler and forbid all others to interfere.\r\n17.17. The jurisdiction over the Indies held by the sovereigns of Spain is\r\n      lawful.\r\n18.18. The native rulers in the Indies are therefore obliged to submit to\r\n      the jurisdiction of the Spanish sovereigns.\r\n19.19. Once the native rulers have voluntarily and freely accepted the\r\n      Faith and been baptised Christians, they become bound by another\r\n      title than before to acknowledge the Spanish sovereignty.\r\n20.20. The law of God imposes on the Spanish sovereigns this duty of\r\n      selecting proper persons and sending them to preach Christianity to\r\n      the natives, and to neglect nothing that may ensure their\r\n      conversion.\r\n21.21. They share this obligation with the Pope and, before the conversion\r\n      of the natives has been accomplished, they have the same power over\r\n      them as has His Holiness.\r\n22.22. The Catholic Faith may be best spread throughout the New World by\r\n      imitating the example of our Lord in establishing His religion upon\r\n      earth.  The natives are submissive, docile people, who may be won by\r\n      kindness, charity, and good examples of holy living. They should be\r\n      encouraged and favoured, and treated as brothers.\r\n23.23. The Romans, Mahometans, Moors, and Turks have propagated their\r\n      doctrines by the sword, but such means are tyrannical, and it is\r\n      blasphemy for Christians to imitate such cruelties; what has already\r\n      been done in the Indies has caused the natives to believe the\r\n      Christian God to be the most merciless and cruel of all deities.\r\n24.24. It is only natural that the Indians should defend their countries\r\n      from armed invasion, thus they resist the propagation of the Faith.\r\n25.25. The Spanish sovereigns have from the outset repeatedly forbidden\r\n      wars, conquests, and acts of cruelty. Those officials who have\r\n      pretended to act by royal authority in such wars and acts have lied,\r\n      and the warrants they have shown are forgeries.\r\n26.26. It follows that all the wars, invasions, and conquests that have\r\n      been made, have been tyrannical, contrary to justice and authority,\r\n      and hence, in fact, null and void: this is proven by the record of\r\n      the proceedings in Council against all such tyrants and usurpers who\r\n      have been found guilty.\r\n27.27. It is the duty of the Spanish sovereigns to maintain and\r\n      re-establish all laws and usages amongst the Indians which are good,\r\n      and that is to say the most of them; those which are bad should be\r\n      abolished, and the preaching and application of the Gospel is the\r\n      best means for effecting this.\r\n28.28. The Devil himself could not have worked greater harm than have the\r\n      Spaniards, by their tyranny and cruel greed; they have treated the\r\n      Indians like beasts, worked them to death, and persecuted those who\r\n      have wished to learn from the friars, even more than others.\r\n29.29. The system of giving the Indians in encomienda and repartimiento is\r\n      absolutely contrary to the royal commands issued by Queen Isabella\r\n      to Columbus and his successors during her reign.  The Queen ordered\r\n      all Indians who had been brought to Spain as slaves, to be sent back\r\n      and set free.  What would she think could she but witness the\r\n      present state of things?  The present sovereign has been kept in\r\n      ignorance of the true condition, and his long journeys and absences\r\n      have prevented him from informing himself.\r\n30.30. It follows, therefore, from these propositions that all the\r\n      conquests, acquisitions of territory, invasions, and usurpations,\r\n      whether by the Crown officials or by the colonists and individuals,\r\n      are illegal, because all have been accomplished contrary to the\r\n      orders of the Spanish sovereigns and in defiance of their authority.\r\n      (68)\r\n\r\nWithout pausing to examine the origin or trace the development of the\r\npapal claim to dispose of the western hemisphere, which Las Casas admits\r\nin these Thirty Propositions, it should be borne in mind that Alexander\r\nVI. made no unusual exercise of his prerogative in so doing, nor was there\r\nanybody, whether philosopher, jurist, or statesman, who, at that time,\r\ncontested his pretension; arguments which Las Casas presented as almost\r\naxiomatic are now obsolete, and of interest merely as illustrating the\r\npolitical doctrines of his times.  He was, perhaps, the first to limit the\r\nexercise of the papal power by describing it as conditional, and in\r\ndenying that the bull gave the sovereigns of Castile any property rights\r\nin the New World.  According to his doctrines, the Pope was exercising his\r\npurely spiritual power.  Charged by the Founder of Christianity with the\r\nobligation to cause the Gospel to be preached to every creature, he might\r\ndelegate to the sovereign of his choice the right, or rather the duty of\r\nsending his subjects to convert the heathen within a prescribed portion of\r\nthe Indies—but for no other purpose.  Equally clear is the limitation he\r\nplaces to the action of the prince.  The latter receives no authorisation\r\nfrom the Pope to invade, occupy, or govern territory in America.  His\r\nmission is exclusively religious, and any advantage accruing to himself\r\nmust be merely incidental.  Since he may not rightfully use force to\r\nestablish his rule over the Indians, the rights of sovereignty conferred\r\nby the Bull, only become effective in cases where the native rulers, after\r\ntheir conversion, voluntarily acknowledge them.\r\n\r\nIn these definitions, Las Casas had gone far, but his adversaries despite\r\ntheir subtlety were impotent either to force or inveigle him into a\r\nposition, where even constructive heresy and disloyalty might be imputed\r\nto him.  More adroit than they, he skilfully evaded their snares, without\r\nsacrificing one jot of his contention.  The India Council was well\r\nsatisfied with his defence of the _Confesionario_, but the resentment of\r\nhis enemies was inflamed the more by his victory, and it was felt to be\r\nmore than ever necessary to fix upon some one able to refute his arguments\r\nand discredit him in the estimation of statesmen and theologians.\r\n\r\nOne of the foremost of Spanish theologians and Jurists at that period was\r\nGines de Sepulveda, whose distinction as a master of Latin style had\r\ncaused Erasmus to describe him as the Spanish Livy.  Born in Cordoba of\r\nnoble parents in 1490, he had passed many years in Italy and had but\r\nrecently returned to Spain, where he was named royal historiographer by\r\nCharles V.  During his sojourn in Rome, Sepulveda had published a dialogue\r\nentitled _Democrates_, in which he sought to prove that war was consonant\r\nwith the doctrines of Christianity: “De convenientia, disciplinæ militaris\r\ncum cristiana religione.”\r\n\r\nWhether or no Sepulveda was deliberately chosen by the opponents of Las\r\nCasas to dispute the Bishop’s propositions in defence of the Indians, does\r\nnot positively appear, (69) but just before the latter returned from\r\nAmerica, he composed a second dialogue, _Democrates II.  De justis belli\r\ncausis apud Indios_, in which he upheld the right of the Spaniards to make\r\nwar on the Indians.  This dialogue was apparently written in Valladolid\r\nand called forth an episcopal reprimand from the Bishop of Segovia.  The\r\nfraternal admonition of the Bishop, instead of disposing of the subject,\r\nprovoked a reply from Sepulveda in the form of an _Apologia_ of an\r\n_Democrates II_.\r\n\r\nThe India Council having refused to permit the publication of this\r\ndialogue, Sepulveda petitioned the Emperor, who referred the matter to the\r\nCouncil of Castile.  That body having given its assent, the Emperor signed\r\na royal cedula at Aranda de Duero, authorising the printing of the book.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the interest excited by this controversy, Las Casas\r\narrived in Spain.  He prevailed upon the Council of Castile to reconsider\r\nits decision, and to submit Sepulveda’s work to the universities of\r\nSalamanca and Alcala, for an opinion on the soundness of his doctrine.\r\nThe reply of the universities was adverse, and the authorisation to\r\npublish was consequently annulled. (70)\r\n\r\nProhibited from publishing his book in Spain, Sepulveda sent it to Rome\r\nwhere the censorship of the press was freer and where, in fact, the\r\ncondemned dialogue was printed, together with the author’s _Apologia_\r\naddressed to the Bishop of Segovia.  An edition of the work was prepared\r\nin Spanish for the benefit of those who did not read Latin, but the\r\nEmperor forbade the entrance of the one and the other into Spain.\r\n\r\nLas Casas took but the time necessary to master the propositions of\r\nSepulveda, before he seized the cudgels in defence of his Indians.  From\r\nthis moment the controversy took another complexion.  Sepulveda had so far\r\ncrossed weapons with learned theologians, men of study rather than of\r\naction, who carried on the dispute along purely scholastic lines and\r\naccording to the recognised rules governing debates between scholars.\r\n\r\nHis new adversary, who was the best informed man in the world on the\r\nspecial subject under dispute, transferred the debate from academic to\r\npractical ground, of every foot of which he was master.  Though inferior\r\nin learning to the polished humanist, who affected to regard him as a\r\nfurious fanatic whose crude Latin shocked his scholarly sensibilities, Las\r\nCasas was his match in fervid eloquence, overmatched him in the ardour of\r\nhis feelings, and ended by pulverising him under the weight of facts he\r\nhurled upon him.\r\n\r\nThe controversy assumed such proportions that the Emperor, in the fashion\r\nof the times, ordered the India Council to assemble in Valladolid in\r\nconjunction with certain theologians and scholars, to decide whether or no\r\nwars for conquest might be justly waged against the Indians. (71) Before\r\nthis learned jury both Las Casas and Sepulveda were summoned to appear in\r\n1550.\r\n\r\nIn the first session of the assembly, Sepulveda stated his propositions\r\nand expounded his defence of them, presenting, under four heads, his\r\nreasons why it was lawful to make war on the Indians:\r\n\r\n 1.1. Because of the gravity of their sins, particularly the practice of\r\n      idolatry and other sins against nature.\r\n 2.2. Because of the rudeness of their heathen and barbarous natures,\r\n      which oblige them to serve those of more elevated natures, such as\r\n      the Spaniards possess.\r\n 3.3. For the spread of the faith; for their subjection renders its\r\n      preaching easier and more persuasive.\r\n 4.4. On account of the harm they do to one another, killing men to\r\n      sacrifice them and some, in order to eat them.\r\n\r\nThese reasons were defended by their author in an able discourse, in which\r\nall the resources of his vast learning and forensic ability were called\r\ninto play.\r\n\r\nLas Casas occupied five sessions in reading his _Historia Apologetica_,\r\nafter which the assembly directed the Emperor’s confessor, Fray Domingo de\r\nSoto, to prepare a summary of the arguments of both parties, of which\r\nfourteen copies should be made for distribution to the members of the\r\nconference.\r\n\r\nAfter the reading of Fray Domingo’s summary, which was drawn up with\r\nperfect impartiality and great clearness, Sepulveda presented twelve\r\nobjections to the arguments of Las Casas, each of which he argued with\r\ngreat subtlety and erudition.  The refutation of these twelve objections\r\nby Las Casas, closed this memorable controversy; in none of his writings\r\nis the character of the Protector of the Indians more fully revealed than\r\nin this final discourse before the conference at Valladolid.  To give it\r\nin its entirety would occupy too much space in this place, but the\r\nfollowing translation of the speech with which he introduced his twelve\r\nanswers, is worthy of our closest attention.\r\n\r\nAfter the introductory phrases required by the etiquette of such debates\r\nhe continued: “So enormous are the errors and scandalous propositions,\r\ncontrary to all evangelical truth and to all Christianity that the Doctor\r\nSepulveda has accumulated, set forth, and coloured with misguided zeal in\r\nthe royal service, that no honest Christian would be surprised should we\r\nwish to combat him, not only with lengthy argument, but likewise as a\r\nmortal enemy of Christendom, an abettor of cruel tyrants, extirpator of\r\nthe human race, and disseminator of fatal blindness throughout this realm\r\nof Spain.  But the least we could do, having regard to the obligations\r\nimposed by the law of God, is to answer each point here presented, and\r\nthis will complete his confusion.”\r\n\r\nFrom this vigorous opening, the Bishop went on to examine the nature of\r\nthe Bull of donation and the intention of Alexander VI. in granting it.\r\nHe demonstrated the irrefutable fact that the Catholic sovereigns and the\r\nPope were in absolute agreement, and that the clearness of the language of\r\nthe Bull left no room for two interpretations.  The better to illustrate\r\nand drive home this argument, he cited articles from the last will of\r\nQueen Isabella, of which the following translation proves the truth of his\r\ncontention:\r\n\r\n“Forasmuch as when the islands and terra-firma discovered, or to be\r\ndiscovered, in the Ocean Sea, were granted to us by the Holy Apostolic\r\nSee, our principal intention, when we asked the said concession from Pope\r\nAlexander VI. of happy memory, was to provide for attracting and winning\r\nto us the natives, and to convert them to our holy Catholic faith; and to\r\nsend to the said islands and and terra-firma, prelates, religious,\r\nclerics, and other learned and God-fearing men, to instruct the\r\ninhabitants in the Catholic faith: and to use all necessary diligence in\r\nteaching them and in introducing good customs among them; all this\r\naccording as may be more fully seen in the wording of the said concession.\r\nI therefore very affectionately beseech my lord the King, and I charge and\r\ncommand the said Princess, my daughter, and the said Prince, her husband,\r\nthat they shall execute and accomplish this, making it their principal\r\nobject, and using the greatest diligence therein.  They shall not consent,\r\nor furnish occasion that the Indian natives and inhabitants of the said\r\nislands and and terra-firma, sustain any injury, either in their persons\r\nor their belongings, but they shall rather order that they be well and\r\njustly treated.  And if they [the Indians] have received any injury, they\r\nshall correct it and shall take measures to prevent what is conceded to\r\nand enjoined upon us by the wording of the said concession, from being\r\nexceeded.”\r\n\r\nReviewing the conditions in the colonies, Las Casas described the richness\r\nof the soil and the vast resources of the Indies, declaring that what was\r\nwanted there, were industrious, honest, and frugal emigrants, who would\r\ndevelop the agricultural sources of wealth, instead of the horde of\r\nrapacious adventurers and dissolute soldiery then engaged in depopulating\r\nand ruining them.  One by one he stripped Sepulveda’s propositions of\r\ntheir brilliant rhetoric, exposing the hollowness and sham beneath the\r\nspecious reasoning, with which the latter sought to cloak his poverty of\r\nfacts. Las Casas closed his case with the following brilliant and\r\nprophetic peroration:\r\n\r\n“The injuries and loss which have befallen the Crown of Castile and Leon\r\nwill be visited likewise on all Spain, because the tyranny wrought by\r\ntheir devastations, massacres, and slaughters is so monstrous, that the\r\nblind may see it, the deaf hear it, and the dumb recount it, while after\r\nour brief existence, the wise shall judge and condemn it.  I invoke all\r\nthe hierarchies and choirs of angels, all the saints of the Celestial\r\nCourt, all the inhabitants of the globe and especially those who may live\r\nafter me, to witness that I free my conscience of all that has been done;\r\nand that I have fully exposed all these woes to his Majesty; and that if\r\nhe abandons the government of the Indies to the tyranny of the Spaniards,\r\nthey will all be lost and depopulated—as we see Hispaniola, and other\r\nislands and three thousand leagues of the continent destitute of\r\ninhabitants.  For these reasons, God will punish Spain and all her people\r\nwith inevitable severity. So may it be!”(72)\r\n\r\nLanguage worthy of a saint and a statesman, in which there breathed the\r\nspirit of prophecy, for the system of government, once initiated by the\r\nSpanish officials, was persisted in till the end, while one by one the\r\ngreat possessions of Spain in the New World were torn from the mother\r\ncountry.  In no land where freedom of speech was a recognised right, could\r\nan orator have used plainer language, and it shows both the Spanish civil\r\nand ecclesiastical authorities of that age in a somewhat unfamiliar light\r\nthat Las Casas not only escaped perilous censures but even won a moral\r\nvictory over his talented opponent.  What would have become of the\r\nchampion of such unpopular doctrines, attacking as he did the material\r\ninterests of thousands of the greatest men in the land, had there been\r\ndaily newspapers in those times, it is not difficult to imagine.  Examples\r\nof the defenders of forlorn causes are not wanting in our own day, and the\r\nfate of those who lead an unpopular crusade is the pillory of the press,\r\nwhich spares no less than did the fires of the mediaeval stake.\r\n\r\nThe discovery and conquest of the American dominions brought ruin to Spain\r\nas a nation; beyond the tribute of glory which those early achievements\r\nyielded to the Spanish name, the results were disastrous to her power.\r\nDuring centuries, much of the best blood of her prolific people was\r\ndrained by the Americas, so that the population of the peninsula to-day is\r\nlittle more numerous than in the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella, whereas\r\nher territory and natural resources might maintain triple their number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI. - SAN GREGORIO DE VALLADOLID. LAST LABOURS.  THE DEATH OF LAS\r\nCASAS\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the forensic encounter with Sepulveda was the most dramatic\r\nincident in the latter years of the life of Las Casas after his return to\r\nSpain, its conclusion was not followed either by his disappearance or by\r\nany diminution of his activity as Protector of the Indians.  His habitual\r\nresidence from that time on became the College of San Gregorio at\r\nValladolid, where he had the companionship of his devoted friend Ladrada\r\nand the support of an important community of his Order.  Fray Rodrigo, who\r\nalso acted as confessor to his old friend, would seem to have been\r\nsomething of a wag, as it is related of him that when the Bishop had\r\nbecome somewhat deaf, the confessor might be heard admonishing his\r\npenitent: “Don’t you see, Bishop, that you will finish up in hell because\r\nof your want of zeal in defending the Indians whom God has placed in your\r\ncharge?”(73)\r\n\r\nThe royal India Council likewise sat in Valladolid, and this fact may\r\npossibly have influenced the indefatigable Bishop’s choice of that city\r\nfor his residence.  He had made repeated efforts to obtain from the\r\nCouncil some positive proclamation or declaration, affirming the freedom\r\nof the Indians as a natural and inalienable right, and at this time, he\r\nsucceeded in moving that somewhat lethargic body to express a desire for\r\nmore explicit information on this subject, before reaching a decision.  In\r\nresponse to an order from the Council, Las Casas wrote his treatise\r\nentitled, _The Liberty of the Enslaved Indians_ (_De la libertad de los\r\nIndios que han sido reducidos à la esclavitud_) which, for greater\r\nconvenience, he divided into three parts.   The first part treated of the\r\nnullity of the title on which such slavery was based; the second dealt\r\nwith the duties of the Spanish sovereign towards the Indians, and the\r\nthird was devoted to the obligations of the bishops of the American\r\ndioceses.\r\n\r\nIn none of his writings are the opinions of Las Casas on questions of the\r\nrights of man and the functions of government more lucidly set forth, and\r\nwhile many of the arguments on which he rested his propositions, and which\r\nwere consonant with the prevalent spirit of his times, would not secure\r\nuniversal assent in our day, there is not one of the essential principles\r\nof his thesis, that has not since been recognised as inherently and\r\nindisputably just.\r\n\r\nHis treatise opened as follows:\r\n\r\n“I propose in this article to demonstrate three propositions; first, that\r\nall the Indians who have been enslaved since the discovery of the New\r\nWorld, have been reduced to this sad condition without right or justice;\r\nsecond that the majority of Spaniards who hold Indian slaves do so in bad\r\nfaith; and third, that this imputation is also applicable to such\r\nSpaniards as have not acquired their slaves by right of repartimiento but\r\nhave obtained them from other Indians.”\r\n\r\nHe combated the almost universally accepted theory that justifiable\r\nconquest conferred the right of enslaving the conquered, and he maintained\r\nthat the most that might be exacted from a conquered people, even from\r\nthose who had actively resisted, was recognition of the government\r\nestablished by the victorious party; taxes were justifiable and must be\r\npaid, and prisoners of war might be held until the close of hostilities,\r\nwhile extra burdens might be laid upon the country during the period of\r\nmilitary occupation.  Not one of these principles was at that time acted\r\nupon by any Christian power engaged in war with uncivilised nations, yet\r\nevery one of them is now placed beyond dispute by the universally accepted\r\nprinciples of international law.\r\n\r\nWars unjustly undertaken, according to Las Casas, could confer no rights,\r\nbecause right is not founded upon injustice, and he defined war as unjust\r\nwhen undertaken without the sanction of legitimate authority, or even when\r\nordered by legitimate authority, but without sufficient motive or\r\nprovocation.  This touched the question of the Indians very closely, for\r\nmost of the Spanish invasions of the different islands and the countries\r\nof the mainland were begun without any authority from, or even the\r\nknowledge of the Spanish government.  No Spanish sovereign ever authorised\r\nthe invasion or conquest of any of the countries, on which their distant\r\nand self-styled representatives embarked, for motives of personal\r\naggrandisement or in a pure spirit of adventure.  Both Velasquez in Cuba\r\nand Cortes in Mexico were destitute of any royal authority for their\r\nundertakings, and only the splendour of their successes sufficed to\r\ncondone their license, when they were able to confront the King with a\r\nprofitable fait accompli. The royal instructions to all governors and\r\nrepresentatives of the Spanish Crown were, on the contrary, filled with\r\ninjunctions to treat the Indians humanely, to provide for their conversion\r\nand instruction by pacific means, and on no account to employ force save\r\nfor self-defence.\r\n\r\nLas Casas arraigned the conduct of all the colonial governors and\r\nofficials, mercilessly attacking and exposing the various deceits and\r\nsubterfuges, by means of which they evaded or overstepped their\r\ninstructions, provoking the Indians by their inhuman cruelties to acts of\r\nresistance, in order to enslave them as rebels against the royal\r\nauthority. He illustrated his accusations with numerous incidents of which\r\nhe had himself been a witness.\r\n\r\nHis denunciations of the judges described them as corrupt and venal, ready\r\nto wink at the scandalous abuses and the violations of the Spanish laws,\r\nwhich were daily perpetrated under their very eyes, consenting the while\r\nto fill their own pockets with a share of the illicit profits.\r\n\r\nDescribing the horrors and ravages of the slave-trade, he declared that\r\nthe provinces of Guatemala and Nicaragua had been depopulated, while in\r\nthe provinces of Jalisco, Yucatan, and Panuco, similar outrages had been\r\nperpetrated, adding that the Germans in Venezuela were even more adroit\r\nthan the Spaniards in the nefarious art of raiding Indian villages to\r\ncarry off the inhabitants into slavery.  “Your Majesty will see that I do\r\nnot exaggerate when I affirm that more than four million men have been\r\nreduced to slavery, all of which has been accomplished in defiance of your\r\nMajesty’s royal instructions.”\r\n\r\nThroughout this treatise, Las Casas supports his contentions on citations\r\nfrom Scripture, and in the second article, dealing with the obligations of\r\nthe King towards his Indian subjects, he defines in very plain language\r\nthe sanctions on which the royal claims to obedience rest: “The law of God\r\nimposes on the king the obligation to administer his kingdoms in such wise\r\nthat small and great, poor and rich, the weak and the powerful, shall all\r\nbe treated with equal justice”;—such is his Statement of the King’s duty\r\nand he supports it with quotations from Deuteronomy, Leviticus, the\r\nprophet Isaias, and St. Jerome, concluding with these words: “In fact,\r\nhistory furnishes examples of God chastising the nations and kingdoms\r\nwhich have refused justice to the poor and the orphan.  Who shall venture\r\nto say that such may not be the fate of Spain, if the King denies the poor\r\nIndians their just dues and fails to give them the liberty, to which they\r\nhave an incontestable right?”\r\n\r\nNor does he limit the King’s responsibility to his personal acts in cases\r\nwhich may come directly to his knowledge; he is obliged also to see that\r\nhis subjects observe one another’s rights and live according to the laws\r\nof civil order and public morality.  The object for which society and\r\nrulers exist is to insure the common weal of all, and no sovereign can\r\nsecure this, who does not base his government on the principles of virtue\r\nand justice.  The Spanish king is therefore not only obliged to secure the\r\nliberty of the Indians because justice exacts this of him, but also\r\nbecause he is bound to prevent his Spanish subjects from acts of\r\nusurpation of the rights of others.  Christian kings have greater duties\r\nthan those which weigh upon heathen or heretical rulers, for they are\r\nbound to protect religion, favour its ministers, and spread the faith for\r\nthe sanctification of the whole world.  By securing liberty to the\r\nIndians, their conversion would be assured and, all causes of enmity and\r\nhatred against Spaniards being removed, the natives would eagerly welcome\r\nthe missionaries and receive their teaching.\r\n\r\nThe third article of his argument, dealing with the conduct of bishops in\r\nAmerica, rehearses their apostolic duties towards their flocks and\r\nconcludes by defining it as an episcopal obligation to represent the\r\nsufferings and wrongs of their defenceless people to the King and the\r\nIndia Council, and to insist on Justice being done them.\r\n\r\nIt is a noteworthy fact that such writings and speeches seem to have given\r\nno offence to the Spanish monarch, at that time the most absolute\r\nsovereign in Christendom, and that, not only before the members of the\r\nIndia Council, but in the estimation of the impartial men of his times,\r\nLas Casas succeeded in disproving the charge of disputing the rights of\r\nthe Spanish Crown to sovereignty in the Indies, which his enemies had\r\nmaliciously sought to fasten upon him.\r\n\r\nCharles V. had already conceded much to the venerable Bishop’s unceasing\r\nand energetic representations.  A royal decree had abolished slavery,\r\nreduced very considerably the number of encomiendas, and had restricted\r\nthe authority of the holders of these concessions over their Indians; the\r\nlabours of the natives held in encomienda had been greatly lightened and\r\ntheir rights had been placed on a sure basis, strict instructions having\r\nbeen given to the civil authorities to correct abuses of power and to\r\nprotect the weak.  Wise laws and humane instructions had, however, at no\r\ntime been wanting but the benevolent intentions of the Emperor were never\r\nadequately fulfilled by the Spanish colonial officials.  Nevertheless,\r\nmuch had been accomplished and the condition of the Indians—those of them\r\nwho survived—was very different in 1550, from that which prevailed when\r\nLas Casas took up their cause in 1510.  Spaniards and Indians were equal\r\nbefore the common law of the land, the papal bull had defined, once for\r\nall, the moral status of the latter as responsible beings, and it was\r\nhenceforth heresy to sustain the contrary.  The supports on which those\r\nwho had contended in favour of tightening the hold of the Spanish\r\ncolonists on the natives had, one by one, been knocked from under them and\r\nthe way was open for the more complete and practical application of the\r\nroyal provisions for the protection of the oppressed peoples.\r\n\r\nPrince Philip, to whom the Emperor had granted the sovereignty of Naples,\r\nSicily, and Sardinia and who was already styled Philip II., left Spain on\r\nJuly 12, 1554, to celebrate his marriage with the English Queen, Mary\r\nTudor.   He took in his suite several renowned theologians, amongst whom\r\nwas Carranza de Miranda, at that time his confessor and later raised to\r\nthe primatial See of Toledo.  The relations between Las Casas and this\r\nimportant ecclesiastic had been most cordial and the latter had given the\r\nweight of his approval on more than one occasion to the Bishop in his\r\nfurious controversies; notably during his contest with Sepulveda and by\r\ndefending his _Confesionario_.  Carranza, in his quality of confessor,\r\nexercised a great influence over the mind of Philip II.\r\n\r\n                        [Illustration: Philip II.]\r\n\r\n                                Philip II.\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph of the original portrait by Pantoja in the Prado Museum.\r\n               (by permission of J. Laurent & Co., Madrid)\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time a movement was set on foot by the Spanish colonists in\r\nAmerica to obtain from the Crown the establishment of the encomienda\r\nsystem in perpetuity.  The movement was opportune, for Spanish finances\r\nwere at a low ebb and the King, being hard pressed for ready money, might\r\nbe tempted to yield his consent to this simple means tor raising the\r\nconsiderable sum the petitioners would gladly pay.  This important\r\nquestion seemed likely to be submitted to Philip during his stay in\r\nEngland, where an agent of the colonists in Peru, Don Antonio Ribera, was\r\nready to open negotiations. Las Casas, who was sleepless where the\r\ninterests of his protégés were concerned, perceived how vitally their\r\nwelfare was threatened by this nefarious scheme and vividly realised that\r\nPhilip must be prevented, at all costs, from giving his decision during\r\nhis absence from Spain.\r\n\r\nIt would seem from his letter to Carranza, begging him to use his\r\ninfluence with the King to defer judgment until his return, that the\r\nlatter had applied to him for an opinion on the subject.   The\r\ncorrespondence between the two extended over the several years of the\r\nKing’s absence, but of the letters of Las Casas to Carranza, only the\r\nfirst one, written in 1555, has been preserved.  Its language is no less\r\nvigorous than that which the Protector was accustomed to use when roused\r\nto the duties of his position.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the history of the colonists’ relations with the Indians\r\nand recalling the solemn pledge given by Charles V. that his Indian\r\nsubjects should never be enslaved, he vehemently threatens the King and\r\nhis ministers with the eternal pains of hell if they break that royal\r\nengagement.  In enumerating the obstacles opposed by the Spaniards to the\r\nconversion of the Indians, he writes:\r\n\r\n“The third difficulty opposed to the conversion of the Indians is, that\r\nthe system of oppression and cruelty followed in dealing with them, makes\r\nthem curse the name of God and our holy religion: as the friars in Chiapa\r\nwrite me, nothing short of a miracle can make the Indians believe in Jesus\r\nChrist, when they see the execrable and manifest contradiction that exists\r\nbetween His gentle and beneficent doctrines and the conduct of the\r\nChristians, their enemies.  What a scandal is it for them to see the faith\r\npreached by fifteen or twenty monks who are poor, despised, miserably\r\nclad, and reduced to begging their bread, while the crowd of so-called\r\nChristians living in opulence, arrayed in silks, mounted on their horses,\r\ninspires respect, submission, and fear everywhere, and acts in defiance of\r\nthe law of God and the teachings of His ministers!”\r\n\r\nThe Bishop expresses the hope that Carranza will read any passage of his\r\nletter, or indeed the entire composition to the King, if he judges it\r\nwise.  An analogous letter on the same subject, written shortly afterwards\r\nby Las Casas and Fray Domingo de Santo Tomas jointly, was addressed to\r\nPhilip II.  Victory crowned the Bishop’s efforts, for the royal decision,\r\ngiven after King Philip’s return to Spain, was adverse to making the\r\nencomiendas hereditary or perpetual.\r\n\r\nAlthough he had chosen San Gregorio as his residence, Las Casas must have\r\nbeen frequently and for lengthy periods absent from Valladolid.  A royal\r\norder dated from Toledo on the fourteenth of December, 1562, and signed by\r\nPhilip II. directs that the Bishop of Chiapa, on account of his services\r\nto the late Emperor and of those he continues to render to the King, shall\r\nalways be provided with lodgings suitable to his rank, in Toledo or\r\nwherever else in the Spanish realm the court may happen to reside.  The\r\nattendance of Las Casas at court would seem, from this document, to have\r\nbeen frequent.\r\n\r\nIn 1563, the annual life pension of 200,000 maravedis granted him by\r\nCharles V. in 1555, was increased by Philip II. to the sum of 350,000\r\nmaravedis.\r\n\r\nIn the early months of 1564 Las Casas was in Madrid, lodged in the Convent\r\nof Our Lady of Atocha just outside the city walls.  It was on the\r\nseventeenth of March of that year that he there formally delivered a\r\nsealed document, which he declared to be his signed will, in the presence\r\nof a notary, Gaspar Testa, and seven other witnesses.(74)\r\n\r\nAt the age of ninety he wrote his treatise in defence of the Peruvians,\r\nthe last of his known compositions, and which was written, as is stated in\r\nits text, in 1564.(75) The style and arguments of this work are identical\r\nwith those that characterised all his writings.  The last negotiation in\r\nbehalf of American interests that Las Casas undertook and saw to a\r\nsuccessful finish, was to obtain the restoration of the Audiencia of the\r\nConfines, to Gracias á Dios, whence it had been recently transferred to\r\nPanama, thus leaving the whole of the former province with no superior\r\ntribunal for the administration of justice.  This business called him from\r\nValladolid to Madrid in the spring of 1566.\r\n\r\nThe life of the great Bishop was nearing its end.  He had long outlived\r\nall his early contemporaries, he had enjoyed the confidence and respect of\r\nthree of the most remarkable sovereigns, Ferdinand of Aragon, Charles V.\r\nand Philip II., all of whom had received his fearless admonitions, not\r\nonly with docility, but had responded with cordial admiration.  Cardinal\r\nXimenez, Pope Adrian VI., the powerful Flemish favourites, the discoverers\r\nand conquerors from Columbus to Cortes and Pizarro, were all long since\r\ndead, and he had seen numbers of his most powerful enemies in disgrace and\r\nin their graves.  The Spain on which he closed his aged eyes was a\r\ndifferent country from that on which he had first, opened them; the\r\ncolonial development in America, the Reformation in Germany, the rise of\r\nEngland—all these and a hundred events of minor but far-reaching\r\nimportance, had changed the face of the world.\r\n\r\nThe illness which proved fatal to Las Casas overtook him in the convent of\r\nthe Atocha in Madrid, and in the latter days of July, 1566, he died.(76)\r\nOnly a few days before he breathed his last he wrote the following\r\nsentences, which were probably the last his prolific pen ever traced.\r\nThey portray the character and aspirations of this great man more fully,\r\nperhaps, than any other of his multitudinous compositions.\r\n\r\n“For the goodness and mercy of God chose to elect me as His minister,\r\ndespite my want of merit, to strive and labour for the infinite peoples,\r\nthe possessors and owners of those kingdoms of the countries we call the\r\nIndies, against the burdens, evils, and injuries such as were never seen\r\nor heard of, which we Spaniards brought upon them, contrary to all right\r\nand justice; and to restore them to their pristine liberty, of which they\r\nwere unjustly despoiled; and to save them from the violent death which\r\nthey still suffer, just as for the same cause, thousands of leagues of\r\ncountry have been depopulated, many in my own presence.  I have laboured\r\nat the Court of the Castilian sovereigns, coming and going between the\r\nIndies and Spain many times during the fifty years since 1514, animated\r\nonly by God and by compassion at beholding the destruction of such\r\nmultitudes of rational, humble, most kind, and most simple men, all well\r\nadapted to accept our Holy Catholic Faith and moral doctrine, and to live\r\nhonestly.  God is witness that I have advanced no other reason.  Hence I\r\nstate my positive belief, for I believe the Holy Roman Church, which is\r\nthe rule and measure of our faith, must and does hold that the Spaniards’\r\nconduct towards those peoples, their robberies, murders, usurpations of\r\nthe territories of the rightful kings and nobles and other infinite\r\nproperties, which they accomplished with such accursed cruelties—has been\r\ncontrary to the most strictly immaculate law of Jesus Christ and contrary\r\nto natural right.  It has brought great infamy on the name of Jesus Christ\r\nand of the Christian religion, entirely hindering the spread of the faith\r\nand irreparably injuring the souls and bodies of those innocent peoples.\r\nI believe that because of these impious and ignominious acts, perpetrated\r\nunjustly, tyrannously, and barbarously upon them, God will visit His wrath\r\nand ire upon Spain for her share, great or small, in the blood-stained\r\nriches, obtained by theft and usurpation, accompanied by such slaughter\r\nand annihilation of those peoples, unless she does much penance.”\r\n\r\nThis last profession of the faith he had kept unfalteringly for more than\r\nhalf a century, was his own supreme vindication and a warning to his\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\nA great concourse of people assembled for the obsequies of the venerable\r\nBishop, which were celebrated by the Superior of the Monastery, Fray\r\nDomingo de la Para, and his mortal remains, clothed in modest episcopal\r\nvestments, with a wooden crozier in his hand, were laid to rest in the\r\nCapilla Mayor of the church of Atocha. (77)\r\n\r\nThe remains of great men are frequently denied a permanent resting place\r\nanywhere, and the frequent translations of their bodies not uncommonly end\r\nin their final whereabouts becoming a matter of dispute.  Records are\r\nlost, graves are disturbed, witnesses are untrustworthy, and it finally\r\nbecomes impossible to ascertain the last resting place of some great\r\npersonage, whose whereabouts during almost every hour of his life were a\r\nmatter of public interest and notoriety.  Thus it has happened with the\r\nremains of this illustrious Spaniard and holy Bishop.  According to a\r\nstatement made by Juan Antolines de Burgos in his manuscript history of\r\nthe city of Valladolid, (78) the bones of Las Casas were afterwards\r\nremoved from the Atocha and buried in San Gregorio.  The college buildings\r\nwere in part alienated, thus necessitating another removal of the body,\r\nwhich was then buried in the cloister where the remains of the monks\r\ncommonly found sepulture.  In 1670, Fray Gabriel de Cepedo dedicated a\r\nwork entitled _Historia de la milagrosa y Venerable Virgin de Atocha_ to\r\nCharles II., in which he contradicts the statement of Juan Antolines by\r\naffirming that Las Casas rested at that time in the church of Atocha.  He\r\ndoes this as one referring to a commonly known and undisputed fact and his\r\npublished statement has never been contradicted.  The old church of Atocha\r\nno longer exists, having been demolished to make way for a new edifice,\r\nstill in process of construction.\r\n\r\nThe will of Las Casas was opened on July 31, 1566, at the instance of Fray\r\nJuan Bautiste, Procurator of the College of San Gregorio in Valladolid, he\r\nbeing the executor.  It was found that Las Casas had left all his\r\nmanuscripts to the college.(79) He requested the rector to have his vast\r\ncorrespondence, consisting of letters and reports sent to him by friars,\r\nmissionaries, and others throughout all America and covering a period of\r\nmany years, chronologically arranged and collected in the form of a book,\r\nas these documents would illustrate and confirm the truth of all he had\r\nalleged against the Spaniards and in favour of the Indians. “Let them be\r\nplaced,” he wrote, “in the college library ad perpetuam rei memoriam, for\r\nshould God decree the destruction of Spain, it may be seen that it is\r\nbecause of our destruction of the Indies, and His justice may be made\r\napparent.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I. - THE BREVISSIMA RELACION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROLOGUE OF THE BISHOP DON FRAY BARTHOLOMEW DE LAS CASAS OR CASAUS\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MOST HIGH AND MIGHTY LORD, THE PRINCE OF THE SPANISH STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDon Philip our Lord.\r\nMost High, and Mighty Lord.\r\n\r\n   1. As divine Providence has ordained that in his world, for its\r\n      government, and for the common utility of the human race, Kingdoms\r\n      and Countries should be constituted in which are Kings almost\r\n      fathers and pastors, (as Homer calls them) they being consequently\r\n      the most noble, and most generous members of the Republics, there\r\n      neither is nor can be reasonable doubt as to the rectitude of their\r\n      royal hearts. If any defect, wrong, and evil is suffered, there can\r\n      be no other cause than that the Kings are ignorant of it; for if\r\n      such were manifested to them, they would extirpate them with supreme\r\n      industry and watchful diligence.\r\n 2.2. It is seemingly this that the divine Scriptures mean in the Proverbs\r\n      of Solomon, qui sedet in solio iudicii, dissipat omne malum intuitu\r\n      suo: because it is thus assumed from the innate and peculiar virtue\r\n      of the King namely, that the knowledge alone of evil in his Kingdom\r\n      is absolutely sufficient that he should destroy it; and that not for\r\n      one moment, as far as in him lies, can he tolerate it.\r\n 3.3. As I have fifty, or more, years of experience in those countries, I\r\n      have therefore been considering the evils, I have seen committed,\r\n      the injuries, losses, and misfortunes, such as it would not have\r\n      been thought could be done by man; such kingdoms, so many, and so\r\n      large, or to speak better, that most vast and new world of the\r\n      Indies, conceded and confided by God and his Church to the Kings of\r\n      Castile, that they should rule and govern it; that they should\r\n      convert it, and should prosper it temporally, and spiritually.\r\n 4.4. When some of their particular actions are made known to Your\r\n      Highness, it will not be possible to forbear supplicating His\r\n      Majesty with importunate insistence, that he should not concede nor\r\n      permit that which the tyrants have invented, pursued, and put into\r\n      execution, calling it Conquests; which if permitted, will be\r\n      repeated; because these acts in themselves, done against those\r\n      pacific, humble, and mild Indian people, who offend none, are\r\n      iniquitous, tyrannous, condemned and cursed by every natural,\r\n      divine, and human law.\r\n 5.5. So as not to keep criminal silence concerning the ruin of numberless\r\n      souls and bodies that these persons cause, I have decided to print\r\n      some, though very few, of the innumerable instances I have collected\r\n      in the past and can relate with truth, in order that Your Highness\r\n      may read them with greater facility.\r\n 6.6. Although the Archbishop of Toledo, Your Highness’ Preceptor, when\r\n      Bishop of Cartagena, asked me for them and presented them to Your\r\n      Highness, nevertheless, because of the long journeys by sea and land\r\n      Your Highness has made, and of the continual royal occupations, it\r\n      may be that Your Highness either has not read them or has already\r\n      forgotten them.\r\n 7.7. The daring and unreasonable cupidity of those who count it as\r\n      nothing to unjustly shed such an immense quantity of human blood,\r\n      and to deprive those enormous countries of their natural inhabitants\r\n      and possessors, by slaying millions of people and stealing\r\n      incomparable treasures, increase every day; and they insist by\r\n      various means and under various feigned pretexts, that the said\r\n      Conquests are permitted, without violation of the natural and divine\r\n      law, and, in consequence, without most grievous mortal sin, worthy\r\n      of terrible and eternal punishment.  I therefore esteemed it right\r\n      to furnish Your Highness with this very brief summary of a very long\r\n      history that could and ought to be composed, of the massacres and\r\n      devastation that have taken place.\r\n 8.8. I supplicate Your Highness to receive and read it with the clemency,\r\n      and royal benignity he usually shows to his creatures, and servants,\r\n      who desire to serve solely for the public good and for the\r\n      prosperity of the State.\r\n 9.9. Having seen and understood the monstrous injustice done to these\r\n      innocent people in destroying and outraging them, without cause or\r\n      just motive, but out of avarice alone, and the ambition of those who\r\n      design such villainous operations, may Your Highness be pleased to\r\n      supplicate and efficaciously persuade His Majesty to forbid such\r\n      harmful and detestable practices to those who seek license for them:\r\n      may he silence this infernal demand for ever, with so much terror,\r\n      that from this time forward there shall be no one so audacious as to\r\n      dare but to name it.\r\n10.10. This—Most High Lord—is most fitting and necessary to do, that God\r\n      may prosper, preserve and render blessed, both temporally and\r\n      spiritually, all the State of the royal crown of Castile. Amen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBREVISSIMA RELACION OR SHORT REPORT OF THE DESTRUCTION OF THE INDIES\r\n\r\n\r\n   1. The Indies were discovered in the year fourteen hundred and\r\n      ninety-two.  The year following, Spanish Christians went to inhabit\r\n      them, so that it is since forty-nine years that numbers of Spaniards\r\n      have gone there: and the first land, that they invaded to inhabit\r\n      was the large and most delightful Isle of Hispaniola which has a\r\n      circumference of six hundred leagues.\r\n 2.2. There are numberless other islands, and very large ones, all around\r\n      on every side, that were all—and we have seen it—as inhabited and\r\n      full of their native Indian peoples as any country in the world.\r\n 3.3. Of the continent, the nearest part of which is more than two hundred\r\n      and fifty leagues distant from this Island, more than ten thousand\r\n      leagues of maritime coast have been discovered, and more is\r\n      discovered every day; all that has been discovered up to the year\r\n      forty-nine is full of people, like a hive of bees, so that it seems\r\n      as though God had placed all, or the greater part of the entire\r\n      human race in these countries.\r\n 4.4. God has created all these numberless people to be quite the\r\n      simplest, without malice or duplicity, most obedient, most faithful\r\n      to their natural Lords, and to the Christians, whom they serve; the\r\n      most humble, most patient, most peaceful, and calm, without strife\r\n      nor tumults; not wrangling, nor querulous, as free from uproar, hate\r\n      and desire of revenge, as any in the world.\r\n 5.5. They are likewise the most delicate people, weak and of feeble\r\n      constitution, and less than any other can they bear fatigue, and\r\n      they very easily die of whatsoever infirmity; so much so, that not\r\n      even the sons of our Princes and of nobles, brought up in royal and\r\n      gentle life, are more delicate than they; although there are among\r\n      them such as are of the peasant class. They are also a very poor\r\n      people, who of worldly goods possess little, nor wish to possess:\r\n      and they are therefore neither proud, nor ambitious, nor avaricious.\r\n 6.6. Their food is so poor, that it would seem that of the Holy Fathers\r\n      in the desert was not scantier nor less pleasing.  Their way of\r\n      dressing is usually to go naked, covering the private parts; and at\r\n      most they cover themselves with a cotton cover, which would be about\r\n      equal to one and a half or two ells square of cloth.  Their beds are\r\n      of matting, and they mostly sleep in certain things like hanging\r\n      nets, called in the language of Hispaniola hamacas.\r\n 7.7. They are likewise of a clean, unspoiled, and vivacious intellect,\r\n      very capable, and receptive to every good doctrine; most prompt to\r\n      accept our Holy Catholic Faith, to be endowed with virtuous customs;\r\n      and they have as little difficulty with such things as any people\r\n      created by God in the world.\r\n 8.8. Once they have begun to learn of matters pertaining to faith, they\r\n      are so importunate to know them, and in frequenting the sacraments\r\n      and divine service of the Church, that to tell the truth, the clergy\r\n      have need to be endowed of God with the gift of pre-eminent patience\r\n      to bear with them: and finally, I have heard many lay Spaniards\r\n      frequently say many years ago, (unable to deny the goodness of those\r\n      they saw) certainly these people were the most blessed of the earth,\r\n      had they only knowledge of God.\r\n 9.9. Among these gentle sheep, gifted by their Maker with the above\r\n      qualities, the Spaniards entered as soon as they knew them, like\r\n      wolves, tigers, and lions which had been starving for many days, and\r\n      since forty years they have done nothing else; nor do they otherwise\r\n      at the present day, than outrage, slay, afflict, torment, and\r\n      destroy them with strange and new, and divers kinds of cruelty,\r\n      never before seen, nor heard of, nor read of, of which some few will\r\n      be told below: to such extremes has this gone that, whereas there\r\n      were more than three million souls, whom we saw in Hispaniola, there\r\n      are to-day, not two hundred of the native population left.\r\n10.10. The island of Cuba is almost as long as the distance from\r\n      Valladolid to Rome; it is now almost entirely deserted.  The islands\r\n      of San Juan [Porto Rico], and Jamaica, very large and happy and\r\n      pleasing islands, are both desolate.  The Lucaya Isles lie near\r\n      Hispaniola and Cuba to the north and number more than sixty, includ‐\r\n      ing those that are called the Giants, and other large and small\r\n      Islands; the poorest of these, which is more fertile, and pleasing\r\n      than the King’s garden in Seville, is the healthiest country in the\r\n      world, and contained more than five hundred thousand souls, but\r\n      to-day there remains not even a single creature.  All were killed in\r\n      transporting them, to Hispaniola, because it was seen that the\r\n      native population there was disappearing.\r\n11.11. A ship went three years later to look for the people that had been\r\n      left after the gathering in, because a good Christian was moved by\r\n      compassion to convert and win those that were found to Christ; only\r\n      eleven persons, whom I saw, were found.\r\n12.12. More than thirty other islands, about the Isle of San Juan, are\r\n      destroyed and depopulated, for the same reason.  All these islands\r\n      cover more than two thousand leagues of land, entirely depopulated\r\n      and deserted.\r\n13.13. We are assured that our Spaniards, with their cruelty and execrable\r\n      works, have depopulated and made desolate the great continent, and\r\n      that more than ten Kingdoms, larger than all Spain, counting Aragon\r\n      and Portugal, and twice as much territory as from Seville to\r\n      Jerusalem (which is more than two thousand leagues), although\r\n      formerly full of people, are now deserted.\r\n14.14. We give as a real and true reckoning, that in the said forty years,\r\n      more than twelve million persons, men, and women, and children, have\r\n      perished unjustly and through tyranny, by the infernal deeds and\r\n      tyranny of the Christians; and I truly believe, nor think I am\r\n      deceived, that it is more than fifteen.\r\n15.15. Two ordinary and principal methods have the self-styled Christians,\r\n      who have gone there, employed in extirpating these miserable nations\r\n      and removing them from the face of the earth.  The one, by unjust,\r\n      cruel and tyrannous wars.  The other, by slaying all those, who\r\n      might aspire to, or sigh for, or think of liberty, or to escape from\r\n      the torments that they suffer, such as all the native Lords, and\r\n      adult men; for generally, they leave none alive in the wars, except\r\n      the young men and the women, whom they oppress with the hardest,\r\n      most horrible, and roughest servitude, to which either man or beast,\r\n      can ever be put.   To these two ways of infernal tyranny, all the\r\n      many and divers other ways, which are numberless, of exterminating\r\n      these people, are reduced, resolved, or sub-ordered according to\r\n      kind.\r\n16.16. The reason why the Christians have killed and destroyed such\r\n      infinite numbers of souls, is solely because they have made gold\r\n      their ultimate aim, seeking to load themselves with riches in the\r\n      shortest time and to mount by high steps, disproportioned to their\r\n      condition: namely by their insatiable avarice and ambition, the\r\n      greatest, that could be on the earth.  These lands, being so happy\r\n      and so rich, and the people so humble, so patient, and so easily\r\n      subjugated, they have had no more respect, nor consideration nor\r\n      have they taken more account of them (I speak with truth of what I\r\n      have seen during all the aforementioned time) than,—I will not say\r\n      of animals, for would to God they had considered and treated them as\r\n      animals,—but as even less than the dung in the streets.\r\n17.17. In this way have they cared for their lives—and for their souls:\r\n      and therefore, all the millions above mentioned have died without\r\n      faith, and without sacraments.  And it is a publicly known truth,\r\n      admitted, and confessed by all, even by the tyrants and homicides\r\n      themselves, that the Indians throughout the Indies never did any\r\n      harm to the Christians: they even esteemed them as coming from\r\n      heaven, until they and their neighbours had suffered the same many\r\n      evils, thefts, deaths, violence and visitations at their hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Of Hispaniola\r\n\r\n\r\n   1. In the island of Hispaniola—which was the first, as we have said, to\r\n      be invaded by the Christians—the immense massacres and destruction\r\n      of these people began.  It was the first to be destroyed and made\r\n      into a desert.  The Christians began by taking the women and\r\n      children, to use and to abuse them, and to eat of the substance of\r\n      their toil and labour, instead of contenting themselves with what\r\n      the Indians gave them spontaneously, according to the means of each.\r\n      Such stores are always small; because they keep no more than they\r\n      ordinarily need, which they acquire with little labour; but what is\r\n      enough for three households, of ten persons each, for a month, a\r\n      Christian eats and destroys in one day.  From their using force,\r\n      violence and other kinds of vexations, the Indians began to perceive\r\n      that these men could not have come from heaven.\r\n 2.2. Some hid their provisions, others, their wives and children: others\r\n      fled to the mountains to escape from people of such harsh and\r\n      terrible intercourse. The Christians gave them blows in the face,\r\n      beatings and cudgellings, even laying hands on the lords of the\r\n      land.  They reached such recklessness and effrontery, that a\r\n      Christian captain violated the lawful wife of the chief king and\r\n      lord of all the island.\r\n 3.3. After this deed, the Indians consulted to devise means of driving\r\n      the Christians from their country.  They took up their weapons,\r\n      which are poor enough and little fitted for attack, being of little\r\n      force and not even good for defence; For this reason, all their wars\r\n      are little more than games with sticks, such as children play in our\r\n      countries.\r\n 4.4. The Christians, with their horses and swords and lances, began to\r\n      slaughter and practise strange cruelty among them.  They penetrated\r\n      into the country and spared neither children nor the aged, nor\r\n      pregnant women, nor those in child labour, all of whom they ran\r\n      through the body and lacerated, as though they were assaulting so\r\n      many lambs herded in their sheepfold.\r\n 5.5. They made bets as to who would slit a man in two, or cut off his\r\n      head at one blow: or they opened up his bowels.  They tore the babes\r\n      from their mothers’ breast by the feet, and dashed their heads\r\n      against the rocks.  Others they seized by the shoulders and threw\r\n      into the rivers, laughing and joking, and when they fell into the\r\n      water they exclaimed: “boil body of so and so!”  They spitted the\r\n      bodies of other babes, together with their mothers and all who were\r\n      before them, on their swords.\r\n 6.6. They made a gallows just high enough for the feet to nearly touch\r\n      the ground, and by thirteens, in honour and reverence of our\r\n      Redeemer and the twelve Apostles, they put wood underneath and, with\r\n      fire, they burned the Indians alive.\r\n 7.7. They wrapped the bodies of others entirely in dry straw, binding\r\n      them in it and setting fire to it; and so they burned them.  They\r\n      cut off the hands of all they wished to take alive, made them carry\r\n      them fastened on to them, and said: “Go and carry letters”: that is;\r\n      take the news to those who have fled to the mountains.\r\n 8.8. They generally killed the lords and nobles in the following way.\r\n      They made wooden gridirons of stakes, bound them upon them, and made\r\n      a slow fire beneath: thus the victims gave up the spirit by degrees,\r\n      emitting cries of despair in their torture.\r\n 9.9. I once saw that they had four or five of the chief lords stretched\r\n      on the gridirons to burn them, and I think also there were two or\r\n      three pairs of gridirons, where they were burning others; and\r\n      because they cried aloud and annoyed the captain or prevented him\r\n      sleeping, he commanded that they should strangle them: the officer\r\n      who was burning them was worse than a hangman and did not wish to\r\n      suffocate them, but with his own hands he gagged them, so that they\r\n      should not make themselves heard, and he stirred up the fire, until\r\n      they roasted slowly, according to his pleasure.  I know his name,\r\n      and knew also his relations in Seville. I saw all the above things\r\n      and numberless others.\r\n9.10. And because all the people who could flee, hid among the mountains\r\n      and climbed the crags to escape from men so deprived of humanity, so\r\n      wicked, such wild beasts, exterminators and capital enemies of all\r\n      the human race, the Spaniards taught and trained the fiercest\r\n      boar-hounds to tear an Indian to pieces as soon as they saw him, so\r\n      that they more willingly attacked and ate one, than if he had been a\r\n      boar.  These hounds made great havoc and slaughter.\r\n10.11. And because sometimes, though rarely, the Indians killed a few\r\n      Christians for just cause, they made a law among themselves, that\r\n      for one Christian whom the Indians killed, the Christians should\r\n      kill a hundred Indians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   The Kingdoms that were in Hispaniola\r\n\r\n\r\n   1. There were five very large and principal kingdoms in this island of\r\n      Hispaniola, and five very mighty kings, whom all the other\r\n      numberless lords obeyed, although some of the lords of certain\r\n      separate provinces did not recognise any of them as superior.  One\r\n      kingdom was called Maguá, with the last syllable accented, which\r\n      means the kingdom of the plain.\r\n\r\n      This plain is one of the most notable and marvellous things in the\r\n      world, for it stretches eighty leagues from the sea on the south to\r\n      that on the north.  Its width is five leagues, attaining to eight\r\n      and ten, and it has very high mountains on both sides.\r\n\r\n 2.2. More than thirty thousand rivers, and brooks water it among which\r\n      there are twelve as large as the Ebro, the Duero, and the\r\n      Guadalquivir.  And all the rivers that flow from the western\r\n      mountain, which number twenty or twenty-five thousand, are very rich\r\n      in gold.  On that mountain (or mountains) lies the province of\r\n      Cibao, from which the mines of Cibao are named, whence comes that\r\n      famous gold, superior in carat, which is held in great esteem here.\r\n 3.3. The king, and lord of this realm was called Guarionex.  He had such\r\n      great lords as his vassals, that one alone of them mustered sixteen\r\n      thousand warriors to serve Guarionex; and I knew some of them.  This\r\n      king Guarionex was very obedient, virtuous and, by nature, peaceful\r\n      and devoted to the king of Castile.  And in certain years, every\r\n      householder amongst his people gave by his orders, a bell full of\r\n      gold; and afterwards, because they could not fill it, they cut it in\r\n      two and gave that half full; because the Indians had little or no\r\n      ability to collect, or dig the gold from the mines.\r\n 4.4. This prince offered to serve the King of Castile, by having as much\r\n      land cultivated as would extend from Isabella, which was the first\r\n      habitation of the Christians to the town of San Domingo, which is a\r\n      good fifty leagues, in order that gold should not be asked of him;\r\n      because he said, and with truth, that his vassals knew not how to\r\n      collect it.  I know he was able to do the cultivation he proposed to\r\n      undertake, most gladly; and it would have rendered the King more\r\n      than three million crowns yearly, and, owing to this cultivation,\r\n      there would have been at the present time in this island fifty towns\r\n      as large as Seville.\r\n 5.5. The payment they awarded to this great and good king and lord, was\r\n      to dishonour him; a captain, a bad Christian violating his wife.\r\n      Although he might have bided his time to assemble his people and\r\n      revenge himself, he determined to depart alone, and to hide himself\r\n      and die exiled from his kingdom and state, in a province called\r\n      Ciguay, of which the ruler was his vassal.\r\n 6.6. When the Christians became aware that he was missing, he could not\r\n      hide himself from them.  They made war on that ruler who sheltered\r\n      him, where, after great slaughter, they found and captured him.\r\n      When he was taken, they put him on a ship in chains, to bring him to\r\n      Castile in fetters.  The ship was lost at sea, and many Christians\r\n      were drowned with him, besides a great quantity of gold, including\r\n      the great nugget, which was as big as a cake and weighed three\r\n      thousand and six hundred crowns, because God was pleased to avenge\r\n      such great injustice.\r\n 7.7. The second kingdom was called Marien, where now is the royal port at\r\n      the end of the plain towards the north.  It was larger than the\r\n      kingdom of Portugal and was certainly much more prosperous, and\r\n      worthy of being populated; and it has many, and high mountains, and\r\n      very rich gold, and copper mines.  Its king was named Guacanagari\r\n      (with the last letter accented) under whom there were many and very\r\n      great lords, many of whom I saw and knew.\r\n 8.8. In the country of this king, the old Admiral(80) who discovered the\r\n      Indies, first went to stay.  When he discovered the island he, and\r\n      all the Christians who accompanied him, was received the first time\r\n      by the said Guacanagari with great humanity and charity.  He met\r\n      with such a gentle and agreeable reception, and such help and\r\n      guidance when the ship in which the Admiral sailed was lost there,\r\n      that in his own country, and from his own father a better would not\r\n      have been possible.  This I know from the recital and words of the\r\n      same Admiral.  This king, flying from the massacres and cruelty of\r\n      the Christians, died a wanderer in the mountains, ruined and\r\n      deprived of his state.  All the other lords, his subjects, died\r\n      under tyranny and servitude, as will be told below.\r\n 9.9. The third kingdom and dominion was Maguana, a country equally\r\n      marvellous, most healthy and most fertile; where now the best sugar\r\n      of the island is made. Its king was called Caonabò.  In strength,\r\n      and dignity, in gravity, and pomp he surpassed all the others.  They\r\n      captured this king with great cunning and malice, he being safe in\r\n      his own house.  They put him on a ship to take him to Castile and,\r\n      as there were six ships in the port ready to leave, God, who wished\r\n      to show that this, together with the other things, was a great\r\n      iniquity and injustice, sent a tempest that night that sank all the\r\n      vessels, drowning all the Christians on board of them. The said\r\n      Caonabò perished, loaded with chains, and fetters.\r\n10.10. This lord had three or four very brave brothers as powerful and\r\n      valiant as himself.  They, seeing the unjust imprisonment of their\r\n      brother and lord, and witnessing the destruction and slaughter the\r\n      Christians perpetrated in the other kingdoms, (particularly after\r\n      they knew that the king their brother was dead) armed themselves to\r\n      attack the Christians and avenge themselves.  The Christians went\r\n      against them with some horsemen.  Horses are the most deadly arm\r\n      possible among the Indians.  They worked such havoc and slaughter,\r\n      that they desolated, and depopulated half the kingdom.\r\n11.11. The fourth kingdom is that which is called Xaragua.  This was as\r\n      the marrow, or the Court of all this island.  It surpassed all the\r\n      other kingdoms in the politeness of its more ornate speech as well\r\n      as in more cultured good breeding, and in the multitude and\r\n      generosity of the nobles.  For there were lords and nobles in great\r\n      numbers.  In their costumes and beauty, the people were superior to\r\n      all others.\r\n12.12. The king and lord of it was called Behechio and he had a sister\r\n      called Anacaona.  Both rendered great services to the King of\r\n      Castile, and immense kindnesses to the Christians, delivering them\r\n      from many mortal dangers: and when the King Behechio died, Anacaona\r\n      was left mistress of the kingdom.\r\n13.13. The governor(81) who ruled this island arrived there once, with\r\n      sixty horsemen and more than three hundred foot.  The horsemen alone\r\n      were sufficient to ruin the whole island and the terra firma.  More\r\n      than three hundred lords were assembled, whom he had summoned and\r\n      reassured.  He lured the principal ones by fraud, into a\r\n      straw-house, and setting fire to it, he burnt them alive.\r\n14.14. All the others, together with numberless people, were put to the\r\n      sword, and lance.  And to do honour to the Lady Anacaona, they\r\n      hanged her.  It happened that some Christians, either out of\r\n      compassion or avarice, took some children to save them, placing them\r\n      behind them on their horses, and another Spaniard approached from\r\n      behind and ran his lance through them.  Another, if a child was on\r\n      the ground, cut off its legs with his sword.  Some, who could flee\r\n      from this inhuman cruelty, crossed to a little island lying eight\r\n      leagues distant in the sea; and the said governor condemned all such\r\n      to be slaves, because they had fled from the carnage.\r\n15.15. The fifth kingdom was called Higuey: and an old queen called\r\n      Higuanama ruled it, whom they hanged.  And I saw numberless people\r\n      being burnt alive, torn, and tortured in divers, and new ways, while\r\n      all whom they took alive were enslaved.\r\n16.16. And because so many particulars happened in this slaughter and\r\n      destruction of people, that they could not be contained in a lengthy\r\n      description—for in truth I believe that however many I told, I could\r\n      not express the thousandth part of the whole—I will simply conclude\r\n      the above mentioned wars by saying and affirming, before God and my\r\n      conscience, that the Indians gave no more cause, nor were more to\r\n      blame for all this injustice done unto them, and for the other said\r\n      wickedness I could tell, but omit, than a monastery of good and well\r\n      ordered monks would have given that they should be robbed and\r\n      killed, and that those who escaped death, should be placed in\r\n      perpetual captivity and servitude, as slaves.\r\n17.17. And furthermore, I attest, that in all the space of time during\r\n      which the multitudes of the population of this island were being\r\n      killed and destroyed, as far as I can believe or conjecture, they\r\n      did not commit a single mortal sin against the Christians that\r\n      merited punishment by man.  And of those which are reserved to God\r\n      alone, such as the desire of vengeance, hatred and rancour, that\r\n      these people might harbour against such mortal enemies as were the\r\n      Christians, I believe very few of the Indians committed any such.\r\n      They were little more impetuous and harsh, judging from the great\r\n      experience I have of them, than children or youths of ten or twelve\r\n      years.\r\n18.18. I have certain and infallible knowledge, that the Indians always\r\n      made most just war on the Christians while the Christians never had\r\n      a single just one with the Indians; on the contrary, they were all\r\n      diabolical and most unjust, and much worse than can be said of any\r\n      tyrant in the world; and I affirm the same of what they have done\r\n      throughout the Indies.\r\n19.19. When the wars were finished, and with them the murder, they divided\r\n      among them all the men, (youths, women, and children being usually\r\n      spared) giving to one, thirty, to another forty, and to another a\r\n      hundred and two hundred, according to the favour each enjoyed with\r\n      the chief tyrant, whom they called governor.  Having thus\r\n      distributed them, they assigned them to each Christian, under the\r\n      pretence that the latter should train them in the catholic faith;\r\n      thus to men who are generally all idiots, and very cruel, avaricious\r\n      and vicious, they gave the care of souls.\r\n20.20. The care and thought these Spaniards took, was to send the men to\r\n      the mines to dig gold, which is an intolerable labour; and they put\r\n      the women into dwellings, which are huts, to dig and cultivate the\r\n      land; a strong and robust man’s work.  They gave food neither to the\r\n      one, nor the other, except grass, and things that have no substance.\r\n      The milk dried up in the breasts of nursing women and thus, within a\r\n      short time, all the infants died.\r\n21.21. And as the husbands were separated and never saw their wives,\r\n      generation diminished among them; the men died of fatigue and hunger\r\n      in the mines and others perished in dwellings or huts, for the same\r\n      reason.  It was in this way that such multitudes of people were\r\n      destroyed in this island, as indeed all those in the world might be\r\n      destroyed by like means.\r\n22.22. It is impossible to recount the burdens with which their owners\r\n      loaded them, more than three and four arobas(82) weight, making them\r\n      walk a hundred and two hundred leagues.  The same Christians had\r\n      themselves carried by Indians in hamacas, which are like nets; for\r\n      they always used them as beasts of burden.  They had wounds on their\r\n      shoulders and backs, like animals, all wither-wrung.  To tell\r\n      likewise of the whip-lashings, the beatings, the cuffs, the blows,\r\n      the curses, and a thousand other kinds of torments to which their\r\n      masters treated them, while, in truth, they were working hard, would\r\n      take much time and much paper; and would be something to amaze\r\n      mankind.\r\n23.23. It must be noted, that the destruction of this island and of these\r\n      lands was begun when the death of the most Serene Queen, Doña\r\n      Isabella was known here, which was in the year 1504.  For up to that\r\n      time, only some provinces in the island had been ruined by unjust\r\n      wars, but not entirely: and these were nearly all kept hidden from\r\n      the Queen.  Because the Queen, who is in blessed glory, used great\r\n      solicitude and marvellous zeal for the health and prosperity of\r\n      these people, as we ourselves, who have seen the examples of it with\r\n      our eyes and touched them with our hands, well know.\r\n24.24. Another rule to be noted is this; that in all parts of the Indies\r\n      where the Christians have gone and have passed, they ever did the\r\n      same murder among the Indians, and used tyranny and abominable\r\n      oppression against these innocent people; and they added many more\r\n      and greater and newer ways of torment.  They became ever crueller,\r\n      because God let them precipitate themselves the more swiftly into\r\n      reprobate judgments and sentiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 The Two Islands of San Juan and Jamaica\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1509 the Spaniards passed over to the islands of San Juan and Jamaica,\r\n(83) which were so many gardens and hives of bees, with the same object\r\nand design they had accomplished in Hispaniola, where they committed the\r\ngreat outrages and iniquities narrated above.  They even added to them\r\nmore notorious ones, and the greatest cruelty; slaying, burning, roasting,\r\nand, throwing the Indians to fierce dogs.  They oppressed, tormented, and\r\nafflicted all those unhappy innocents in the mines, and with other\r\nlabours, until they were consumed and destroyed, because there were in the\r\nsaid isles more than a million souls, and to-day there are not two hundred\r\nin each. All have perished without faith and without sacraments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            The Island of Cuba\r\n\r\n\r\n   1. In the year 1511 the Spaniards passed over to the island of Cuba,\r\n      (84) which as I said, is as long as from Valladolid to Rome, and\r\n      where there were great and populous provinces.  They began and ended\r\n      in the above manner, only with incomparably greater cruelty. Here\r\n      many notable things occurred.\r\n 2.2. A very high prince and lord, named Hatuey, who had fled with many of\r\n      his people from Hispaniola to Cuba, to escape the calamity and\r\n      inhuman operations of the Christians, having received news from some\r\n      Indians that the Christians were crossing over, assembled many or\r\n      all of his people, and addressed them thus.\r\n 3.3. “You already know that it is said the Christians are coming here;\r\n      and you have experience of how they have treated the lords so and so\r\n      and those people of Hayti (which is Hispaniola); they come to do the\r\n      same here.  Do you know perhaps why they do it?”  The people\r\n      answered no; except that they were by nature cruel and wicked.\r\n      “They do it,” said he, “not alone for this, but because they have a\r\n      God whom they greatly adore and love; and to make us adore Him they\r\n      strive to subjugate us and take our lives.”  He had near him a\r\n      basket full of gold and jewels and he said. “Behold here is the God\r\n      of the Christians, let us perform Areytos before Him, if you will\r\n      (these are dances in concert and singly); and perhaps we shall\r\n      please Him, and He will command that they do us no harm.”\r\n 4.4. All exclaimed; it is well! it is well! They danced before it, till\r\n      they were all tired, after which the lord Hatuey said; “Note well\r\n      that in any event if we preserve the gold, they will finally have to\r\n      kill us, to take it from us: let us throw it into this river.” They\r\n      all agreed to this proposal, and they threw the gold into a great\r\n      river in that place.\r\n 5.5. This prince and lord continued retreating before the Christians when\r\n      they arrived at the island of Cuba, because he knew them, but when\r\n      he encountered them he defended himself; and at last they took him.\r\n      And merely because he fled from such iniquitous and cruel people,\r\n      and defended himself against those who wished to kill and oppress\r\n      him, with all his people and offspring until death, they burnt him\r\n      alive.\r\n 6.6. When he was tied to the stake, a Franciscan monk, a holy man, who\r\n      was there, spoke as much as he could to him, in the little time that\r\n      the executioner granted them, about God and some of the teachings of\r\n      our faith, of which he had never before heard; he told him that if\r\n      he would believe what was told him, he would go to heaven where\r\n      there was glory and eternal rest; and if not, that he would go to\r\n      hell, to suffer perpetual torments and punishment.  After thinking a\r\n      little, Hatuey asked the monk whether the Christians went to heaven;\r\n      the monk answered that those who were good went there.  The prince\r\n      at once said, without any more thought, that he did not wish to go\r\n      there, but rather to hell so as not to be where Spaniards were, nor\r\n      to see such cruel people.  This is the renown and honour, that God\r\n      and our faith have acquired by means of the Christians who have gone\r\n      to the Indies.\r\n 7.7. On one occasion they came out ten leagues from a great settlement to\r\n      meet us, bringing provisions and gifts, and when we met them, they\r\n      gave us a great quantity of fish and bread and other victuals, with\r\n      everything they could supply.  All of a sudden the devil entered\r\n      into the bodies of the Christians, and in my presence they put to\r\n      the sword, without any motive or cause whatsoever, more than three\r\n      thousand persons, men, women, and children, who were seated before\r\n      us. Here I beheld such great cruelty as living man has never seen\r\n      nor thought to see.\r\n 8.8. Once I sent messengers to all the lords of the province of Havana,\r\n      assuring them that if they would not absent themselves but come to\r\n      receive us, no harm should be done them; all the country was\r\n      terrorized because of the past slaughter, and I did this by the\r\n      captain’s advice.  When we arrived in the province, twenty-one\r\n      princes and lords came to receive us; and at once the captain\r\n      violated the safe conduct I had given them and took them prisoners.\r\n      The following day he wished to burn them alive, saying it was better\r\n      so because those lords would some time or other do us harm.  I had\r\n      the greatest difficulty to deliver them from the flames but finally\r\n      I saved them.\r\n 9.9. After all the Indians of this island were reduced to servitude and\r\n      misfortune like those of Hispaniola, and when they saw they were all\r\n      perishing inevitably, some began to flee to the mountains; others to\r\n      hang themselves in despair; husbands and wives hanged themselves,\r\n      together with their children, and through the cruelty of one very\r\n      tyrannical Spaniard whom I knew, more than two hundred Indians\r\n      hanged themselves.  In this way numberless people perished.\r\n10.10. There was an officer of the King in this island, to whose share\r\n      three hundred Indians fell; and by the end of three months he had,\r\n      through labour in the mines, caused the death of two hundred and\r\n      seventy; so that he had only thirty left, which was the tenth part.\r\n      The authorities afterwards gave him as many again, and again he\r\n      killed them: and they continued to give, and he to kill, until he\r\n      came to die, and the devil carried away his soul.\r\n11.11. In three or four months, I being present, more than seven thousand\r\n      children died of hunger, their fathers and mothers having been taken\r\n      to the mines.  Other dreadful things did I see.\r\n12.12. Afterwards the Spaniards resolved to go and hunt the Indians who\r\n      were in the mountains, where they perpetrated marvellous massacres.\r\n      Thus they ruined and depopulated all this island which we beheld not\r\n      long ago; and it excites pity, and great anguish to see it deserted,\r\n      and reduced to a solitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               The Mainland\r\n\r\n\r\n   1. In the year 1514 there passed over to the continent an unhappy\r\n      Governor(85) who was the cruellest of tyrants, destitute of\r\n      compassion or prudence, almost an instrument of divine fury.  His\r\n      intention was to settle large numbers of Spaniards in that country.\r\n      And although several tyrants had visited the continent, and had\r\n      robbed and scandalised many people, their stealing and ravaging had\r\n      been confined to the sea-coast; but this man surpassed all the\r\n      others who had gone before him, and those of all the Islands; and\r\n      his villainous operations outdid all the past abominations.\r\n 2.2. Not only did he depopulate the sea-coast, but also countries and\r\n      large kingdoms where he killed numberless people, sending them to\r\n      hell.  This man devastated many leagues of country extending above\r\n      Deldarien to the kingdom and provinces of Nicaragua inclusive, which\r\n      is more than five hundred leagues; it was the best, the happiest,\r\n      and the most populous land in the world.  There were very many great\r\n      lords and numberless settlements, and very great wealth of gold: for\r\n      until that time, never had there been so much seen above ground. For\r\n      although Spain had been almost filled with gold from Hispaniola, and\r\n      that of the finest, it had been dug by the labour of the Indians\r\n      from the bowels of the earth, out of the aforesaid mines, where, as\r\n      has been said, they perished.\r\n 3.3. This governor and his people invented new means of cruelty and of\r\n      torturing the Indians, to force them to show, and give them gold.\r\n      There was a captain of his who, in an incursion, ordered by him to\r\n      rob and extirpate the people, killed more than forty thousand\r\n      persons, putting them to the sword, burning them alive, throwing\r\n      them to fierce dogs, and torturing them with various kind of\r\n      tortures: these acts were witnessed by a Franciscan friar with his\r\n      own eyes, for he went with the captain, and he was called Fray\r\n      Francisco de San Roman.\r\n 4.4. The most pernicious blindness of those who have governed the Indies\r\n      up to the present day, in providing for the conversion and salvation\r\n      of these people, which (to tell the truth) they have always\r\n      postponed, although with words they have represented and pretended\r\n      otherwise, reached such depths that they have commanded notice to be\r\n      given the Indians to accept the Holy faith and render obedience to\r\n      the kings of Castile; otherwise war would be made on them with fire\r\n      and blood, and they would be killed and made slaves etc.\r\n 5.5. As though the Son of God, who died for each of them, had commanded\r\n      in his law, when he said Euntes, docete omnes gentes that intimation\r\n      should be sent to peaceful and quiet infidels, in their own\r\n      countries, that, if they did not receive it at once, without other\r\n      teaching or doctrine, and that if they did not subject themselves to\r\n      the dominion of a king, of whom they had never heard, nor seen, and\r\n      particularly whose messengers are so cruel, so wicked, and such\r\n      horrible tyrants, they should therefore, lose their rights, their\r\n      lands and liberty, their wives and children, with all their lives;\r\n      such a blunder is stupid and worthy of infamy, obloquy, and hell.\r\n 6.6. This wretched and unhappy governor, in giving instructions as to the\r\n      said intimations, the better to justify them—they being of\r\n      themselves unseemly, unreasonable and most unjust—commanded these\r\n      thieves sent by him, to act as follows: when they had determined to\r\n      invade and plunder some province, where they had heard that gold was\r\n      to be found, they should go when the Indians were in their towns,\r\n      and safe in their houses; these wretched Spanish assassins went by\r\n      night and, halting at midnight half a league from the town, they\r\n      published or read the said intimation among themselves saying:\r\n      Princes and Indians of such a place in this continent, we make known\r\n      unto you, that there is one God, one Pope, and one King of Castile,\r\n      who is Lord of this country; come at once to render him obedience\r\n      etc. otherwise know that we shall make war on you, kill you, and put\r\n      you into slavery etc.  And towards sunrise, the innocent natives\r\n      being still asleep with their wives and children, they attacked the\r\n      town, setting fire to the houses that were usually of straw, burning\r\n      the children, the women and many others alive, before they awoke.\r\n      They killed whom they would, and those whom they took alive, they\r\n      afterwards killed with tortures, to force them to indicate other\r\n      towns where there was gold, or more than was to be found there; and\r\n      the others that survived, they put into chains as slaves.  Then when\r\n      the fire was extinguished or low they went to look for the gold that\r\n      was in the houses.\r\n 7.7. In this way and with such operations, were this wretched man and all\r\n      the bad Christians he took with him occupied during the year 1514,\r\n      till the year 1521 or 1522, sending on these raids six or more\r\n      servants, who collected for him a certain portion of all the gold\r\n      and pearls and jewels the Spaniards stole, and of the slaves they\r\n      captured, besides the share that belonged to him as Captain General.\r\n      The officers of the king did the same, each sending as many boys or\r\n      servants as he could.  And also the first bishop of that kingdom\r\n      sent his servants to obtain part of this profit.\r\n 9.8. As far as I can judge they stole, during that time in the said\r\n      kingdom, more gold than a million crowns; and I believe I understate\r\n      it; and it will not be found that, of all they stole, they sent the\r\n      King more than three thousand crowns.  And they destroyed more than\r\n      eight hundred thousand souls.  The other tyrant governors who\r\n      succeeded them till the year 1533 killed, and allowed to be killed\r\n      the survivors with the tyrannical servitude that followed the war.\r\n10.9. Among the other numberless knaveries he committed and permitted\r\n      during the time he governed, was this one; a prince, or lord, having\r\n      of his own will, or more likely out of fear, given him nine thousand\r\n      crowns, he was not satisfied with this sum so he took the said lord,\r\n      bound him seated to a stake, with his feet distended and exposed to\r\n      fire, to force him to give them a larger quantity of gold; and he\r\n      [the chief] sent to his house and brought other three thousand\r\n      crowns; they tortured him again, and as he gave no more gold, either\r\n      because he had none or did not wish to give it, they kept him thus,\r\n      till the marrow oozed out from the soles of his feet; and thus he\r\n      died.  Numberless times they killed and tortured lords in this way\r\n      to get gold from them.\r\n11.10. Another time a company of Spaniards, while going to assassinate,\r\n      came to a mountain where a great number of people were sheltered and\r\n      in hiding, to escape from the pestilential and horrible operations\r\n      of the Christians; assaulting it unexpectedly they captured seventy\r\n      or eighty young girls and women; and left many dead whom they had\r\n      killed.\r\n12.11. The next day many Indians assembled and pursued the Christians,\r\n      driven by their anxiety for their wives and daughters to fight; and\r\n      the Christians finding themselves at close quarters, and not wishing\r\n      to disorder their company of horse, drove their swords into the\r\n      bodies of the young girls and women, and of all the eighty they left\r\n      not even one alive.  The Indians writhing with grief cried out, and\r\n      said: “O wretched men, cruel Christians, you kill Iras!” (the women\r\n      in that country are called Iras).  They meant that to kill women is\r\n      a sign of abominable, cruel and bestial men.\r\n13.12. Ten or fifteen leagues from Panama there was a great lord called\r\n      Paris, who had great wealth of gold.  The Christians went thither\r\n      and he received them as though they were his brothers: he willingly\r\n      presented the captain with fifty thousand castellanos.  It seemed to\r\n      the captain and to the Christians that one who spontaneously gave\r\n      that quantity, must have a great treasure; which was the aim and\r\n      recompense of their effort.  They dissimulated, saying they wished\r\n      to depart: towards sunrise they returned and attacked the\r\n      unsuspecting town; and they set fire to it and burnt it.  They\r\n      killed and burnt many people, and stole other fifty or sixty\r\n      thousand castellanos, and the prince, or lord fled to escape death\r\n      or capture.\r\n14.13. He quickly assembled all the people he could, and in two or three\r\n      days came upon the Christians, who were carrying away his hundred\r\n      and thirty or forty (86) thousand castellanos, and fell upon them\r\n      manfully, killing fifty Christians, recapturing all the gold while\r\n      the others escaped badly wounded.\r\n15.14. Afterwards, many Christians turned on the said lord and destroyed\r\n      him and many of his people; they killed the rest with the usual\r\n      servitude, so that to-day there is neither sign nor any vestige\r\n      whatsoever that there was ever a town or born man where formerly was\r\n      thirty leagues of dominion well populated.  The murders and\r\n      destruction done by that miserable man and his company in that\r\n      kingdom which he devastated, are without number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        The Province of Nicaragua\r\n\r\n\r\n   1. In the year 1522 or 1523 this same tyrant invaded the most\r\n      delightful province of Nicaragua to subjugate it; it was an unlucky\r\n      hour when he entered it.  Who could adequately set forth the\r\n      happiness, healthfulness, agreeableness, prosperity, and the number\r\n      of dwellings and concourse of the people that were there? it was\r\n      truly a marvellous thing to see how full it was of towns, stretching\r\n      for a length of nearly three or four leagues, thickly planted with\r\n      the most marvellous fruit trees; which was the reason that there was\r\n      such an immense population.\r\n 2.2. So much injury and assassination, so much cruelty, wickedness and\r\n      injustice, was done to those people by that tyrant, together with\r\n      the others, his companions, that human language would not suffice to\r\n      relate it; for he was accompanied by all those who had helped to\r\n      destroy all the other kingdom.  The land being flat and open, the\r\n      natives could not hide in the mountains, and their country was so\r\n      delightful, that it was with difficulty and great grief that they\r\n      brought themselves to abandon it; for this reason they suffered, and\r\n      will suffer great persecutions, and they tolerated the tyranny and\r\n      the slavery of the Christians to the extent of their endurance, and\r\n      because they are naturally a very humble and pacific people.\r\n 3.3. He sent fifty mounted soldiers, and had the inhabitants of a whole\r\n      province, larger than the country of Rusenon(87) killed with lances,\r\n      without leaving man nor woman, old nor young alive.  He did this for\r\n      a very trifling reason; such as because they did not come as soon as\r\n      he called them, or because they did not bring him enough loads of\r\n      maize, (which is the grain of that country) or enough Indians to\r\n      serve him or some other of his company: the land being flat, no one\r\n      could escape from their horses and from their infernal wrath.\r\n 4.4. He sent some Spaniards to invade other provinces, which means to go\r\n      and murder the Indians; and he let the assassins bring away as many\r\n      Indians as they pleased from the peaceful settlements, to serve\r\n      them; they put these Indians in chains so that they should not set\r\n      down the loads weighing three arobas that they bound on their backs.\r\n      And it happened sometimes out of the many times he did it, that out\r\n      of four thousand Indians, not six individuals returned alive to\r\n      their homes, because they were left dead by the way.\r\n 5.5. And when some became tired, or lame on account of the great weights,\r\n      or fell ill through hunger, fatigue and weakness, they cut off their\r\n      heads at the neck so as not to loosen them from their chains, and\r\n      the head fell to one side, and the body to the other.  It may be\r\n      imagined how their companions would feel.  When orders were given\r\n      for similar expeditions, the Indians, knowing from experience that\r\n      none who started ever returned, went weeping, and sighing, and\r\n      saying: “Those are the roads, we trod to serve the Christians; and\r\n      although we laboured hard, we finally returned after some time to\r\n      our own homes and to our wives and children; but now we go without\r\n      hope of ever returning, nor of seeing them again, or of having life\r\n      any more.”\r\n 6.6. Once, because it suited his inclination to make a new distribution\r\n      of Indians, and also, they say, to take them from his enemies and\r\n      give them to his friends, the Indians were unable to plant their\r\n      crops; and as bread ran short, the Christians took from the Indians\r\n      all the maize they had to maintain themselves and their children; in\r\n      consequence more than twenty or thirty thousand souls died of\r\n      hunger; and it happened, that a certain woman was driven by hunger\r\n      to kill her own son for food.\r\n 7.7. As each of the towns was a very pleasing garden, as has been said,\r\n      the Christians settled in them; each one in the place that fell to\r\n      his share or, (as they say,) was committed to his charge; each one\r\n      carried on his own cultivation, supporting himself with the meagre\r\n      provisions of the Indians, thus robbing them of their private lands\r\n      and inheritances, by which they maintained themselves.\r\n 8.8. In this wise the Spaniards kept within their own houses all the\r\n      Indian lords, the aged, the women, and the lads, all of whom they\r\n      compelled to serve them day and night, without rest.  They employed\r\n      even the children, as soon as they could stand, in excess of their\r\n      powers.  And in this way they have wasted, and to-day still waste\r\n      those few that are left, not allowing them to have either a home or\r\n      anything of their own. In this they even surpassed the similar\r\n      injustice they perpetrated in Hispaniola.\r\n 9.9. They have exhausted and oppressed, and caused the premature death of\r\n      many people in this Province, making them carry planks and timber to\r\n      build vessels in the port, thirty leagues distant; also by sending\r\n      them to seek for honey and wax in the mountains, where they are\r\n      devoured by tigers; and they have loaded and do still load pregnant\r\n      and confined women, like animals.\r\n10.10. The most horrible pestilence that has principally destroyed this\r\n      Province, was the license which that governor gave to the Spaniards,\r\n      to ask slaves from the princes and lords of the towns.  Every four\r\n      or five months, or whenever one obtained the favour or license from\r\n      the said governor, he asked the lord for fifty slaves threatening,\r\n      if he did not give them, to burn him alive or to deliver him to\r\n      fierce dogs.\r\n11.11. As the Indians usually do not keep slaves and, at most a lord has\r\n      two or three or four, the lords went through their towns and took,\r\n      first all the orphans; next, of those who had two children they\r\n      asked one, and of those who had three, two: and in this way the lord\r\n      completed the number demanded by the tyrant, amidst great wailing\r\n      and weeping in the town, for they seem, more than any other people,\r\n      to love their children.\r\n12.12. By such conduct from the year 1523 to 1533, they ruined all this\r\n      kingdom.  During six or seven years, five or six vessels carried on\r\n      this traffic, taking all this multitude of Indians to sell them as\r\n      slaves in Panama and Peru, where they all died.  It has been\r\n      verified and experienced a thousand times that, by taking the\r\n      Indians away from their native country, they at once die more\r\n      easily: because the Spaniards habitually give them little to eat and\r\n      never relieve them from labour, for they are only sold by some and\r\n      bought by others, to make them work.  In this way they have carried\r\n      off more than five hundred thousand souls from this province making\r\n      slaves of people who were as free as I am.\r\n13.13. In their infernal wars and the horrible captivity into which they\r\n      put the Indians up to the present time, the Spaniards have killed\r\n      more than another five or six hundred thousand persons, and they\r\n      still continue.  All these massacres have occurred in the space of\r\n      fourteen years.  At present they kill daily in the said province of\r\n      Nicaragua, from four to five thousand persons, with servitude and\r\n      continual oppression; it being, as was said, one of the most\r\n      populous in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                New Spain\r\n\r\n\r\n   1. New Spain was discovered in the year 1517. (88) And the discoverers\r\n      gave serious offence to the Indians in that discovery, and committed\r\n      several homicides.  In the year 1518 men calling themselves\r\n      Christians went there to ravage and to kill; although they say that\r\n      they go to populate.  And from the said year 1518, till the present\r\n      day (and we are in 1542) all the iniquity, all the injustice, all\r\n      the violence and tyranny that the Christians have practised in the\r\n      Indies have reached the limit and overflowed: because they have\r\n      entirely lost all fear of God and the King, they have forgotten\r\n      themselves as well.  So many and such are the massacres and cruelty,\r\n      the murder and destruction, the pillage and theft, the violence and\r\n      tyranny throughout the numerous kingdoms of the great continent,\r\n      that everything told by me till now is nothing compared to what was\r\n      practised here.\r\n 2.2. Yet, even had we related everything, including what we have omitted,\r\n      it would not be comparable, either in number or magnitude, to the\r\n      acts which, from the said year 1518 till the present day of this\r\n      year 1542 have been committed.  In this day of the month of\r\n      September the gravest and most abominable acts are done and\r\n      committed; because the rule we have mentioned above verifies itself,\r\n      that from the commencement onwards they have ever been increasing in\r\n      greater wickedness and infernal works.\r\n 3.3. Consequently, from the invasion of New Spain which was on April 18th\r\n      of the said year 1518 till the year 1530, which was twelve entire\r\n      years, the murders and the massacres lasted.  With bloody hands and\r\n      cruel swords the Spaniards continually wrought in nearly four\r\n      hundred and fifty leagues of country belonging to the City of Mexico\r\n      and its surroundings, which numbers four or five great kingdoms, as\r\n      large and much more delightful than Spain.\r\n 4.4. All these countries were more populous than Toledo, Seville,\r\n      Valladolid, and Zaragoza, together with Barcelona; because these\r\n      cities have not, nor did they ever have so many inhabitants when\r\n      they were at their fullest, as God placed, and as are to be found in\r\n      all the said leagues; to go around which, one must walk more than a\r\n      thousand and eight hundred leagues.\r\n 5.5. In the said twelve years more than four million souls have been\r\n      killed by the Spaniards with swords and lances, and by burning alive\r\n      women and children, young and old in the said extent of 450 leagues,\r\n      during the time what they call “conquests” lasted.  In fact, they\r\n      were violent invasions by cruel tyrants, condemned not only by the\r\n      divine law, but by all human laws; they were much worse than those\r\n      of the Turks to destroy the Christian Church.  Besides all this,\r\n      there are the deaths they have caused, and cause every day by the\r\n      tyrannical servitude, the daily afflictions and oppressions above\r\n      described.\r\n 6.6. Neither language, nor knowledge, nor human industry could suffice to\r\n      relate in detail the dreadful operations of those public and mortal\r\n      enemies of the human race, acting in concert in some places and\r\n      singly in others, within the aforesaid circuit.  In truth,\r\n      respecting the circumstances and conditions that rendered certain\r\n      deeds more grievous, no exercise of diligence and time and writing\r\n      could hardly explain them sufficiently.  However I will recount\r\n      something of some of the countries, protesting on my oath, that I\r\n      believe I am not telling the thousandth part.\r\n\r\n   1. Among other massacres there was one took place in a town of more\r\n      than thirty thousand inhabitants called Cholula; all the lords of\r\n      the land, and its surroundings, and above all the priests, with the\r\n      high priest came out in procession to meet the Christians, with\r\n      great submission and reverence, and conducted them in their midst to\r\n      lodge in the town in the dwelling houses of the prince, or principal\r\n      lords; the Spaniards determined on a massacre here or, as they say,\r\n      a chastisement to sow terror and the fame of their valour throughout\r\n      that country, because in all the lands the Spaniards have invaded,\r\n      their aim has always been to make themselves feared of those meek\r\n      lambs, by a cruel and signal slaughter.\r\n 2.2. To accomplish this, they first sent to summon all the lords and\r\n      nobles of the town and of all its dependencies, together with the\r\n      principal lord; and when they came, and began to speak to the\r\n      captain of the Spaniards, they were promptly captured, without any\r\n      one who could give the alarm, noticing it.\r\n 3.3. They had asked for five or six thousand Indians to carry their\r\n      baggage, all of whom immediately came and were confined in the\r\n      courtyards of the houses.  To see these Indians when they prepared\r\n      themselves to carry the loads of the Spaniards, was a thing to\r\n      excite great compassion for they come naked, with only the private\r\n      parts covered, and with some little nets on their shoulders\r\n      containing their meagre food; they all sit down on their heels, like\r\n      so many meek lambs.\r\n 4.4. Being all collected and assembled in the courtyard, with other\r\n      people who were there, some armed Spaniards were stationed at the\r\n      gates of the courtyard to guard them: thereupon all the others\r\n      seized their swords and lances, and butchered all those lambs, not\r\n      even one escaping.\r\n 5.5. Two or three days later, many Indians who had hidden, and saved\r\n      themselves under the dead bodies (so many were they) came out alive\r\n      covered with blood, and they went before the Spaniards, weeping and\r\n      asking for mercy, that they should not kill them: no mercy nor any\r\n      compassion was shown them; on the contrary, as they came out, the\r\n      Spaniards cut them to pieces.\r\n 6.6. More than one hundred of the lords whom they had bound, the captain\r\n      commanded to be burned, and impaled alive on stakes stuck in the\r\n      ground.  One lord however, perhaps the chief and king of that\r\n      country, managed to free himself, and with twenty or thirty or forty\r\n      other men, he escaped to the great temple, which was like a fortress\r\n      and was called Quu, where they defended themselves during a great\r\n      part of the day.\r\n 7.7. But the Spaniards, from whom nothing is safe, especially among these\r\n      people destitute of weapons, set fire to the temple and burned them,\r\n      they crying out: “wretched men! what have we done unto you? why do\r\n      you kill us? go then! in Mexico you will find our universal lord\r\n      Montezuma who will take vengeance upon you for us.”  It is said,\r\n      that while those five, or six thousand men were being put to the\r\n      sword in the courtyard, the captain of the Spaniards stood singing.\r\n\r\n\r\n          Mira Nero de Tarpeya\r\n          A Roma como se ardia.\r\n          Gritos dan niños y viejos,\r\n          Y el de nada se dolia.\r\n\r\n\r\n      (89)\r\n 8.8. They perpetrated another great slaughter in the town of Tepeaca,\r\n      which was much larger and more populous than Cholula; they put\r\n      numberless people to the sword with great and particular kinds of\r\n      cruelty.\r\n 9.9. From Cholula they took their way towards Mexico; and the great king\r\n      Montezuma sent them thousands of presents; and lords and people came\r\n      to meet them with festivities while on their arrival at the paved\r\n      road to Mexico, which is two leagues long, his own brother appeared,\r\n      accompanied by many great lords bearing many presents of gold,\r\n      silver and clothing.  At the entrance of the city he himself\r\n      descended from a golden litter, with all his great court to receive\r\n      them and to accompany them to the palaces, where he had given orders\r\n      they should be lodged; on that same day, according to what was told\r\n      me by some of those present, they managed by some feint, while he\r\n      suspected nothing, to take the great king Montezuma prisoner; and\r\n      then they put him in fetters and placed a guard of eighty men over\r\n      him.\r\n10.10. But leaving all this, of which there would be many, and great\r\n      things to say, I only wish to relate a notable thing that those\r\n      tyrants did here.  When the captain of the Spaniards went to capture\r\n      a certain other captain, (90) who came to attack him, he left one of\r\n      his captains with, I think, a hundred men or more, to keep guard\r\n      over the king Montezuma; these Spaniards decided to do another\r\n      extraordinary thing to increase the fear of them throughout the\r\n      land, a practice, as I have said, to which they often resorted.\r\n11.11. All the Indians, plebeians as well as nobles of Montezuma’s capital\r\n      and court, thought of nothing else but to give pleasure to their\r\n      captive monarch.  Among other festivals they celebrated for him, one\r\n      was the performance in all the quarters and squares of the city of\r\n      those customary dances, called by them mitotes, and in the islands,\r\n      areytos.   In these dances they wear all their richest ornaments,\r\n      and as this is their principal enjoyment and festivity, all take\r\n      part in it.  The greatest nobles and knights and those of royal\r\n      blood, according to their rank, performed their dances and\r\n      ceremonies nearest the buildings where their sovereign was a\r\n      prisoner.\r\n12.12. More than 2000 sons of lords were assembled in the place nearest to\r\n      the said palaces who were the flower and the best nobility of all\r\n      Montezuma’s empire.  The captain [Alvarado] of the Spaniards went\r\n      thither with a squadron of his men and he sent other squadrons to\r\n      all the other parts of the city, where they were performing the said\r\n      dances, pretending that they went to witness them; and he commanded\r\n      that at a certain hour all should fall upon them.\r\n13.13. And while the Indians were intent on their dances in all security\r\n      he cried, Santiago! and fell upon them; with their drawn swords the\r\n      Spaniards pierced those naked and delicate bodies, and shed that\r\n      generous blood, so that not even one was left alive.  The same was\r\n      done by the others in the other squares.\r\n14.14. This was a thing that filled all those kingdoms and people with\r\n      amazement, anguish, lamentation bitterness and grief.  And until the\r\n      end of the world, or till they are entirely destroyed, they will not\r\n      cease in their dances, to lament and sing—as we say here in\r\n      romances,—that calamity and the destruction of all their hereditary\r\n      nobility, in whom they had gloried for so many years back.\r\n15.15. Upon witnessing such injustice and unheard of cruelty, inflicted\r\n      upon so many innocent and inoffensive people, the Indians, who had\r\n      tolerated with patience the equally unjust imprisonment of their\r\n      supreme monarch, because he himself had commanded them to refrain\r\n      from attacking or making war on the Christians, now took up arms\r\n      throughout the city and attacked the Spaniards, many of whom were\r\n      wounded and with difficulty found safety in flight.\r\n16.16. Threatening the captive Montezuma with a dagger at his breast, they\r\n      forced him to show himself on the battlements, and to command the\r\n      Indians to cease besieging the house and calm themselves.  His\r\n      subjects had no mind to obey him any further, but on the contrary,\r\n      they conferred about electing another sovereign and commander who\r\n      would lead them in their battles.\r\n17.17. As the captain [Cortes] who had gone to the port, was already\r\n      returning victorious, and had announced his approach and was\r\n      bringing with him many more Christians, the fighting ceased for\r\n      three or four days, until he entered the city.  When he had entered\r\n      and numberless people were assembled, from all the country, the\r\n      fighting became so general and lasted for so many days that the\r\n      Spaniards, fearing they would all perish, decided to leave the city\r\n      by night.\r\n18.18. Learning their intention, the Indians killed a great number of\r\n      Christians on the bridges of the lagoon, in what was a most just and\r\n      holy war; for their cause was most just, as has been said, and will\r\n      be approved by any reasonable and fair man.  After the fighting in\r\n      the city, the Christians were re-inforced and executed strange and\r\n      marvellous slaughter among the Indians, killing numberless people\r\n      and burning many alive including great lords. (91)\r\n19.19. After the greatest and abominable tyranny practised by these men in\r\n      the City of Mexico, and in the towns throughout the country for ten,\r\n      fifteen and twenty leagues in those parts, during which numberless\r\n      people were killed, this, their tyrannical pestilence passed\r\n      onwards, spreading into, infecting and ruining the province of\r\n      Panuco, where there was a marvellous multitude of people: equally\r\n      marvellous were the massacres and slaughter that they performed\r\n      there.\r\n20.20. Afterwards they destroyed the province of Tututepeche in the same\r\n      way; then the province of Spilcingo; then that of Colima; each of\r\n      which is larger than the kingdoms of Leon and of Castile.  To\r\n      describe the massacres, slaughter, and cruelty which they practised\r\n      in each, would doubtless be a most difficult thing, impossible to\r\n      confirm and disagreeable to listen to.\r\n21.21. Here it must be noted, that the pretext with which they invaded and\r\n      began to destroy all those innocent beings and to depopulate those\r\n      lands which, on account of their numberless populations should have\r\n      caused such joy and contentment to true Christians, was, that they\r\n      came to subject them to the King of Spain; otherwise, they must kill\r\n      them and make slaves of them.  And those, who did not promptly yield\r\n      obedience to such an unreasonable and stupid commission, and refused\r\n      to place themselves in the hands of such iniquitous, cruel and\r\n      brutal men, they declared were rebels, who had risen against the\r\n      service of His Majesty; and thus they wrote from here to our lord\r\n      the King.\r\n22.22. And the blindness of those who govern the Indians, did not\r\n      understand nor attend to what is expressed in their laws, and is\r\n      clearer than any of their first principles whatsoever, namely; that\r\n      no one can be called rebel, if he be not first a subject.\r\n23.23. Let Christians and those that have some knowledge of God, and of\r\n      reason, and also of human laws, consider to what state can be\r\n      reduced the hearts of whatsoever people who live in security in\r\n      their own country ignorant of having obligations towards any one,\r\n      and who have their own rightful rulers, upon being thus unexpectedly\r\n      ordered to yield obedience to a foreign King whom they have never\r\n      seen, nor heard of, otherwise be it known to you, that we must at\r\n      once cut you to pieces; especially when they actually see the threat\r\n      put into execution.\r\n24.24. More dreadful is it that those who obey voluntarily, are put into\r\n      onerous servitude; in which, under incredible labour and tortures\r\n      that last longer than those of death by the sword, they and their\r\n      wives and children and all their race perish.\r\n25.25. And although these people, or any other in the world are moved by\r\n      fear or the said threats to yield obedience and to recognise the\r\n      dominion of a foreign King, our blinded people, unbalanced by\r\n      ambitious and diabolical avarice, do not perceive that they thereby\r\n      acquire not a single atom of right, these fears being truly such as\r\n      discourage the firmest men.\r\n26.26. To say that natural, human and divine right permits their acts\r\n      because the intention justifies them is all wind: but their crime\r\n      condemns them to infernal fire, as do also the offences and injuries\r\n      done to the Kings of Castile, by destroying these their kingdoms and\r\n      annihilating (as far as they possibly can) their rights over all the\r\n      Indies.  These, and none other, are the services the Spaniards have\r\n      rendered, and do render to-day to the said sovereign kings in these\r\n      countries.\r\n27.27. By this just and approved title, did this tyrant captain send two\r\n      other tyrant captains, much more cruel and ferocious and more\r\n      destitute of compassion and mercy than himself, to the vast, most\r\n      flourishing, most happy and densely populated kingdoms, namely to\r\n      that of Guatemala, on the South Sea; and to that of Naco and\r\n      Honduras or Guaymura, on the North Sea.  They lie opposite one\r\n      another, bordering, but separate, and each three hundred leagues\r\n      distant from Mexico.  He sent one expedition by land and the other\r\n      with ships by sea, each provided with many horsemen and\r\n      foot-soldiers.\r\n28.28. I state the truth: Out of the evil done by both, and especially by\r\n      him who went to the kingdom of Guatemala,—because the other soon\r\n      died a bad death—I could collect and recount so much wickedness, so\r\n      many massacres, so many deaths, so much extermination, so much and\r\n      such frightful injustice, that they would strike terror to present\r\n      and future ages: and I could fill a big book with them, for this man\r\n      surpassed all the past and the present in the kind and multitude of\r\n      abominations he committed; in the people he destroyed and in the\r\n      countries he devastated, for they were infinite.\r\n29.29. The one who commanded the expedition by sea, committed great\r\n      robberies and scandal; destroying many people in the towns along the\r\n      coast.  Some natives came out to receive him with presents in the\r\n      kingdom of Yucatan, which is on the road to the above mentioned\r\n      kingdom of Naco and Guaymura, where he was going; when he arrived\r\n      there, he sent captains and many people throughout that country, who\r\n      robbed, killed and destroyed everything and everybody they found.\r\n30.30. One especially of these captains who had mutinied with three\r\n      hundred men, and had entered the country towards Guatemala, advanced\r\n      destroying and burning every place he found, robbing and killing the\r\n      people; he did this diligently for more than a hundred and twenty\r\n      leagues, so that if others were sent in pursuit of him, they would\r\n      find the country depopulated and in rebellion, and would be killed\r\n      by the Indians in revenge for the damage and destruction he had\r\n      done.\r\n\r\n31.31. A few days later they [the Spaniards] killed the principal captain\r\n      who had sent him and against whom he had mutinied.  Afterwards there\r\n      succeeded other most cruel tyrants who, with slaughter and dreadful\r\n      cruelty, and with the capture of slaves and the selling them to the\r\n      ships that brought their wine, clothing and other things, and with\r\n      the usual tyrannical servitude from the year 1524 till 1535, ruined\r\n      those provinces and that kingdom of Naco and Honduras, which truly\r\n      seemed a paradise of delight, and was better peopled than the most\r\n      populous land in the world.  We have now gone through these\r\n      countries on foot and have beheld such desolation and destruction as\r\n      would wring the vitals of the hardest-hearted of men.\r\n\r\n      In these eleven years they have killed more than two million souls,\r\n      and in more than a hundred leagues square, they have not left two\r\n      thousand persons, whom they are now daily exterminating by the said\r\n      servitude.\r\n\r\n32.32. Let us again speak of the great tyrant captain, (92) who went to\r\n      the kingdom of Guatemala, who, as has been said, surpassed all past\r\n      and equalled all present tyrants.  The provinces surrounding Mexico\r\n      are, by the route he took (according to what he himself writes in a\r\n      letter to his chief who sent him), four hundred leagues distant from\r\n      the kingdom of Guatemala: he advanced killing, ravaging, burning,\r\n      robbing and destroying all the country wherever he came, under the\r\n      above mentioned pretext, namely, that the Indians should subject\r\n      themselves to such inhuman, unjust, and cruel men, in the name of\r\n      the unknown King of Spain, of whom they had never heard and whom\r\n      they considered to be much more unjust and cruel than his\r\n      representatives.  He also gave them no time to deliberate but would\r\n      fall upon them, killing and burning almost at the same instant that\r\n      his envoy arrived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  The Province and Kingdom of Guatemala\r\n\r\n\r\n      When he reached this kingdom, he began with a great massacre.\r\n      Nevertheless the principal lord, accompanied by many other lords of\r\n      Ultatlan, the chief town of all the kingdom went forth with\r\n      trumpets, tambourines and great festivity to receive him with\r\n      litters; they served him with all that they possessed, and\r\n      especially by giving him ample food and everything else they could.\r\n   2. The Spaniards lodged outside the town that night because it seemed\r\n      to them to be strong, and that they might run some risk inside it.\r\n      The following day, the captain called the principal lord and many\r\n      others, and when they came like tame lambs, he seized them and\r\n      demanded so many loads of gold.  They replied that they had none,\r\n      because that country does not produce it.  Guiltless of other fault\r\n      and without trial or sentence, he immediately ordered them to be\r\n      burned alive.\r\n   3. When the rulers throughout all those provinces saw that the\r\n      Spaniards had burnt that one and all those chief lords, only because\r\n      they gave them no gold, they all fled from their towns and hid in\r\n      the mountains; they commanded all their people to go to the\r\n      Spaniards and serve them as their lords, but that they should not,\r\n      however, reveal to them their hiding place.\r\n   4. All the inhabitants came to offer themselves to his men and to serve\r\n      them as their lords.  This compassionate captain replied that he\r\n      would not receive them; on the contrary, he would kill them all, if\r\n      they did not disclose the whereabouts of their chiefs.  The Indians\r\n      answered that they knew nothing about them but that the Spaniards\r\n      should make use of them, of their wives and children whom they would\r\n      find in their houses, where they could kill them or do with them\r\n      what they wished.  And this the Indians declared and offered many\r\n      times.\r\n   5. Stupefying to relate, the Spaniards went to the houses where they\r\n      found the poor people working in safety at their occupations with\r\n      their wives and children, and there they wounded them with their\r\n      lances and cut them to pieces.  They also went to a quiet, large and\r\n      important town, where the people were ignorant of what had happened\r\n      to the others and were safe in their innocence; within barely two\r\n      hours they destroyed it, putting women, children, and the aged to\r\n      the sword, and killing all who did not save themselves by flight.\r\n   6. Seeing that with such humility, submission, patience and suffering\r\n      they could not break nor soften hearts so inhuman and brutal, and\r\n      that they were thus cut to pieces contrary to every show or shadow\r\n      of right, and that they must inevitably perish, the Indians\r\n      determined to summon all their people together and to die fighting,\r\n      avenging themselves as best they could on such cruel and infernal\r\n      enemies; they well knew, however, that being not only unarmed but\r\n      also naked and on foot, they could not prevail against such fierce\r\n      people, mounted and so well armed, but must in the end be destroyed.\r\n   7. They constructed some pits in the middle of the streets, covered\r\n      over with broken boughs of trees and grass, completely concealing\r\n      them: they were filled with sharp stakes hardened by fire which\r\n      would be driven into the horses’s bellies if they fell into the\r\n      pits.  Once, or twice, did some horses fall in but not often,\r\n      because the Spaniards knew how to avoid them.  In revenge, the\r\n      Spaniards made a law, that all Indians of whatsoever rank and age\r\n      whom they captured alive, they would throw into the pits.  And so\r\n      they threw in pregnant and confined women, children, old men and as\r\n      many as they could capture who were left stuck on the stakes, until\r\n      the pits were filled: It excited great compassion to see them,\r\n      particularly the women with their children.\r\n   8. They killed all the others with lances and knives; they threw them\r\n      to savage dogs, that tore them to pieces and ate them; and when they\r\n      came across some lord, they accorded him the honour of burning in\r\n      live flames.  This butchery lasted about seven years from 1524 to\r\n      1531. From this may be judged what numbers of people they destroyed.\r\n   9. Among the numberless horrible operations that this unhappy and\r\n      accursed tyrant performed in this kingdom, together with his\r\n      brothers, (for his captains and the others who helped him, were not\r\n      less unhappy and senseless than he) was one very notorious one.  He\r\n      went to the province of Cuzcatan, in which, or not far distant,\r\n      there is the town of San Salvador, which is a most delightful place\r\n      extending all along the coast of the South Sea from forty to fifty\r\n      leagues: and the town of Cuzcatan, which was the capital of the\r\n      province, gave him the kindest of welcomes, sending him more than\r\n      twenty or thirty Indians loaded with fowls and other provisions.\r\n  10. When he arrived, and had received the gift, he commanded that each\r\n      Spaniard should take from that multitude of people, as many Indians\r\n      as he pleased for his service during their stay there, whose duty\r\n      should be to bring them everything they needed.  Each Spaniard took\r\n      a hundred, or fifty or as many as he reckoned would be sufficient\r\n      for his service, and those innocent lambs bore with the\r\n      distribution, and served with all their strength, and almost adored\r\n      them.\r\n  11. In the meantime this captain asked the lords to bring him much gold,\r\n      because it was principally to that end that they came.  The Indians\r\n      replied that they were happy to give all the gold they had, and they\r\n      collected a very great quantity of the hatchets they use, which are\r\n      made of gilded copper and look like gold, though there is little on\r\n      them.  The captain ordered that they should be tested and because he\r\n      saw they were of copper, he said to the Spaniards: “to the devil\r\n      with such a country! let us leave it since there is no gold and let\r\n      each one put the Indians who serve him, in chains, and I will order\r\n      that they be branded as his slaves.”  This was done, and they marked\r\n      as slaves with the King’s brand, all they could bind. And I saw the\r\n      son of the prince of that town thus branded.\r\n  12. When those Indians who escaped and the others throughout the land\r\n      beheld such great iniquity, they began to collect and to arm\r\n      themselves.  The Spaniards did the greatest slaughter and massacre\r\n      among them, after which they returned to Guatemala where they built\r\n      a town; and it is that one which has now been by righteous decree of\r\n      divine justice, destroyed by three deluges together: the one of\r\n      water, the other of earth and the third of stones much bigger than\r\n      ten, and twenty oxen.\r\n  13. Having thus killed all the lords and the men who could have made\r\n      war, they put all the others into the aforesaid infernal slavery;\r\n      they demanded slaves as tribute, so the Indians gave their sons and\r\n      daughters as they have no other slaves, all of whom they loaded into\r\n      ships and sent to be sold in Peru.  By other massacres and murders,\r\n      besides the above, they have destroyed and devastated a kingdom more\r\n      than a hundred leagues square, one of the happiest in the way of\r\n      fertility and population in the world.  This same tyrant wrote that\r\n      it was more populous than the kingdom of Mexico; and he told the\r\n      truth.\r\n  14. He and his brothers, together with the others, have killed more than\r\n      four or five million people in fifteen or sixteen years, from the\r\n      year 1524 till 1540, and they continue to kill and destroy those who\r\n      are still left; and so they will kill the remainder.\r\n  15. It was his custom when he went to make war on some town or province,\r\n      to take with him as many of the Indians as he could, to fight\r\n      against the others; and as he led ten or twenty thousand and gave\r\n      them nothing to eat, he allowed them to eat the Indians they\r\n      captured.  And so a solemn butchery of human flesh took place in his\r\n      army where, in his presence, children were killed and roasted; and\r\n      they would kill a man only to eat his hands and feet, which were\r\n      esteemed the best bits.  And all the people of the other countries,\r\n      hearing of these villainies, were so terror stricken they knew not\r\n      where to hide themselves.\r\n  16. They killed numberless people with the labour of building boats.\r\n      From the South Sea to the North, a distance of a hundred and thirty\r\n      leagues, they led the Indians loaded with anchors weighing seventy\r\n      and eighty pounds each—some of which wore into their shoulders and\r\n      loins.  They also carried much artillery in this way on the\r\n      shoulders of those poor naked creatures; and I saw many of them\r\n      loaded with artillery, suffering along the roads.\r\n  17. They deprived the husbands of their wives and daughters, and gave\r\n      them to the sailors and soldiers, to keep them contented and bring\r\n      them on board the ships.  They crowded Indians into the ships, where\r\n      they all perished of hunger and thirst.  And in truth, were I to\r\n      recount his cruelties one by one, I could make a big book that would\r\n      astonish the world.\r\n  18. He built two fleets, each composed of many ships, with which he\r\n      burnt, as though with fire from heaven, all those countries.  Of how\r\n      many did he make orphans! Of how many did he take away the children!\r\n      How many did he deprive of their wives! how many wives did he leave\r\n      without husbands! Of what adulteries, rapes and violence was he the\r\n      cause! how many did he deprive of liberty! what anguish and calamity\r\n      were suffered by many people because of him! what tears did he cause\r\n      to be shed! what sighs! what groans! what solitude in this life and\r\n      of how many has he caused the eternal damnation in the next! not\r\n      only of the Indians—who were numberless—but of the unhappy\r\n      Christians, of whose company he made himself worthy, with such\r\n      outrages, most grave sins and execrable abominations.  And I pray\r\n      God, that he may have had compassion on him and be appeased with the\r\n      bad death to which he at last brought him. (93)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     New Spain and Panuco and Xalisco\r\n\r\n\r\n   1. After the great cruelties and massacres, that have been described\r\n      (besides those not mentioned) had been committed in the provinces of\r\n      New Spain and that of Panuco another senseless and cruel tyrant(94)\r\n      arrived in Panuco in the year 1525.  By committing great cruelty and\r\n      putting many in irons, and enslaving great numbers of freemen in the\r\n      ways above told, and sending shiploads of them to the islands of\r\n      Cuba and Hispaniola, where they could best he sold, he finished\r\n      devastating all that province.  Eighty Indians, reasonable beings,\r\n      were given in exchange for a horse.\r\n 2.2. From Panuco, he was sent to govern the city of Mexico and all New\r\n      Spain as President, with other great tyrants as Auditors: and the\r\n      great evils, many sins and the amount of cruelty, robbery, and\r\n      abomination he and they together committed, are beyond belief.  They\r\n      thus reduced all that country to such extreme ruin, that in two\r\n      years they would have brought New Spain to the condition of the\r\n      island of Hispaniola, had God not prevented them by the resistance\r\n      of the Franciscan friars and afterwards, by the appointment of a\r\n      Royal Audiencia composed of good men, friendly to all virtue.\r\n 3.3. One of this man’s companions forced eight thousand Indians to work,\r\n      without any payment or food, at building a wall around his great\r\n      garden; they dropped dead from hunger but he showed no concern\r\n      whatever.\r\n 4.4. When this president, of whom I said he finished devastating Panuco,\r\n      learned that the said good royal Audiencia was coming, he found an\r\n      excuse to go inland to discover some place where he might tyrannise;\r\n      he forced fifteen, or twenty thousand men of the province of Mexico\r\n      to carry the baggage of his expedition, of whom not two hundred\r\n      returned, all the rest having perished under his tyranny.\r\n 5.5. He arrived in the province of Mechuacan, which is forty leagues\r\n      distant from Mexico and similar to it, both in prosperity, and in\r\n      the number of its people.  The king and ruler came out to receive\r\n      him with a procession of numberless people, rendering a thousand\r\n      services and making him presents; he at once took the said king\r\n      prisoner because he was reputed to have great riches of gold and\r\n      silver: to force him to surrender his many treasures, the tyrant\r\n      began to put him to the following tortures.\r\n 6.6. Having put his feet in stocks, with his body stretched and his hands\r\n      tied to pieces of wood, they placed a pan of fire near his feet, and\r\n      a boy with a sprinkler soaked in oil, sprinkled them every now and\r\n      then to burn the skin well.  On the one side there stood a cruel man\r\n      with a loaded arbalist aimed at his heart: on the other stood\r\n      another holding a terrible and fierce dog which, had he let it,\r\n      would have torn the king to pieces in a moment; and thus they\r\n      tortured him to make him disclose the treasures; until a Franciscan\r\n      monk, being informed of it, delivered him from their hands, though\r\n      he died at last of his tortures.  They tortured and killed many\r\n      lords and princes of the provinces in like fashion, to make them\r\n      give up their gold and silver.\r\n 7.7. At this time a certain tyrant, going as inspector rather of the\r\n      purses and the property of the Indians than of their souls and\r\n      bodies, found that some Indians had hidden their idols, as the\r\n      Spaniards had never taught them about another better God.  He took\r\n      the lords prisoner till they gave him the idols, thinking they would\r\n      be of gold or silver, and because they were not, he punished them\r\n      cruelly and unjustly.\r\n 8.8. And not to be defrauded of this purpose, which was to rob, he\r\n      compelled the said lords to buy back the idols from him: they bought\r\n      them with such gold and silver as they could find, to adore them as\r\n      their God like they were accustomed.  These are the works these\r\n      wretched Spaniards perform, and the example that they give, and the\r\n      honour they procure for God in the Indies.\r\n 9.9. This great tyrant passed from the province of Mechuacan into that of\r\n      Xalisco, which was as full of people as a hive is of bees, most\r\n      populous and most prosperous, because it is one of the most fertile\r\n      and marvellous in the Indies.  There was a certain town whose houses\r\n      extended nearly seven leagues.  On his arrival there, the lords and\r\n      people came joyfully forth, bearing gifts, as all the Indians are in\r\n      the habit of doing when they go to receive any one.\r\n10.10. He began to commit the usual cruelties and wickedness as all there\r\n      are in the habit of doing, and much more besides, to obtain the\r\n      object they hold as God, which is gold.\r\n11.11. He burnt the towns, captured the lords, tortured them—made slaves\r\n      of everybody he captured and led numbers away in chains.  Women just\r\n      confined were loaded down with the baggage they carried for the\r\n      wicked Christians and, not being able to carry their infants for\r\n      fatigue and the weakness of hunger, they threw them by the roadside\r\n      where numbers perished.\r\n12.12. One wicked Christian having seized a maid by force, to sin with\r\n      her, the mother sprang to tear her away from him, but he seized a\r\n      dagger, or sword, and cut off the mother’s hand; and because the\r\n      maid would not consent, he stabbed her and killed her.\r\n13.13. Among many other free people he unjustly caused to be marked as\r\n      slaves, were four thousand five hundred men, women, and nursing\r\n      children of a year old; others also of two, three, four and five\r\n      years old, although they went forth peacefully to meet him; there\r\n      were numberless others that were not counted.\r\n14.14. When the countless iniquitous and infernal wars and massacres were\r\n      terminated, he laid all that country under the usual, pestilential\r\n      and tyrannical servitude to which all the tyrant Christians of the\r\n      Indies are in the habit of reducing these peoples.  In which he\r\n      consented that his own majordomos and all the others, should use\r\n      cruelty and unheard of tortures to extract gold and tribute from the\r\n      Indians.\r\n15.15. One majordomo of his killed many peaceable Indians, by hanging,\r\n      burning them alive, throwing them to fierce dogs, and cutting off\r\n      their feet and hands and tearing out their tongues and hearts, for\r\n      no other reason than to frighten them into submission and into\r\n      giving him gold and tribute, as soon as they recognised him as the\r\n      same celebrated tyrant.  He also gave them many cruel beatings,\r\n      cudgellings, blows and other kinds of cruelty every day and every\r\n      hour.\r\n16.16. It is told of him that he destroyed and burnt eight hundred towns\r\n      in that kingdom of Xalisco: he goaded the Indians to rebellion out\r\n      of sheer desperation, and after they saw such numbers perish so\r\n      cruelly, they killed some Spaniards, in which they were perfectly\r\n      justified, and then retreated to the mountains.\r\n17.17. Afterwards, the injustice and oppression of other recent tyrants\r\n      who passed that way to destroy other provinces—which they called\r\n      _discovering_ them,—drove many Indians to unite and to fortify\r\n      themselves among certain cliffs: against them the Spaniards have\r\n      again perpetrated such cruelty, killing numberless people, that they\r\n      have almost finished depopulating and destroying all that large\r\n      country.\r\n18.18. These wretched, blind men whom God has permitted to yield to\r\n      reprobate appetite, do not perceive the Indians’ cause, or rather\r\n      the many causes sanctioned by every justice, and by the laws of\r\n      nature, of God and of man, to cut them to pieces, whenever they have\r\n      the strength and weapons, and to drive them from their countries:\r\n      nor do they perceive the iniquity and great injustice of their own\r\n      pretensions, which are condemned by all laws, not to mention the\r\n      many outrages, tyrannies and grave and inexpiable sins they have\r\n      committed against the Indians, by repeatedly making war on them:\r\n      seeing nothing of this, they think and say and write, that the\r\n      victories they obtain over the innocent Indians by destroying them,\r\n      are all conceded to them by their God, because their iniquitous wars\r\n      are just.  Almost as though they rejoiced, and glorified, and\r\n      rendered thanks to God for their tyranny: like those tyrant bandits\r\n      did of whom the prophet Zacharias says in chapter eleven Pasce\r\n      pecora occisionis, quæ qui occidebant non dolebant, sed dicebant:\r\n      Benedictus Deus, quia divites facti sumus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          The Kingdom of Yucatan\r\n\r\n\r\n   1. In the year 1526, by lying and deceiving and by making offers to the\r\n      King, as all the other tyrants have done till now to obtain offices\r\n      and positions, so as to rob, another unhappy man(95) was elected\r\n      governor of the kingdom of Yucatan.\r\n 2.2. This kingdom possessed a dense population, because the country is\r\n      very healthy and abounding much more than Mexico in provisions and\r\n      fruit: and honey was particularly abundant, more so than in any\r\n      other part of the Indies thus far discovered.\r\n 2.3. The said kingdom has a circumference of about three hundred leagues.\r\n      Its people were famous among all those of the Indies for prudence\r\n      and cleanliness, and for having fewer vices and sins than any other;\r\n      and they were very willing and worthy of being brought to the\r\n      knowledge of God.  A great town might have been built there by the\r\n      Spaniards where they might have lived as in a terrestrial paradise\r\n      had they been worthy; but, on account of their great avarice,\r\n      stupidity and grave sins they were not; just as they have not been\r\n      worthy to possess the many other countries that God has disclosed to\r\n      them, in the Indies.\r\n 4.4. This tyrant, with three hundred men whom he brought with him, began\r\n      by making cruel war on those good and innocent people, who kept\r\n      within their houses without offending any one; and they killed and\r\n      destroyed countless people.\r\n 5.5. The country produces no gold, and if it had he would have used up\r\n      the people by working them in the mines; to coin gold therefore out\r\n      of the bodies and souls of those for whom Jesus Christ died, he made\r\n      slaves indifferently of all whom he did not kill; many ships were\r\n      attracted thither by the news that slaves were to be had, all of\r\n      which he sent back loaded with human beings whom he sold for wine,\r\n      oil, vinegar, pork, clothing, horses and whatever else he and his\r\n      men thought they needed.\r\n 6.6. He selected the most beautiful maid from fifty or a hundred, and\r\n      gave her to him who chose her, in exchange for an aroba of wine, or\r\n      oil, or for a pig: and similarly a handsome boy, chosen from among\r\n      two hundred or three hundred, for the same amount.  One boy, who\r\n      seemed to be the son of a prince was given in exchange for a cheese;\r\n      and a hundred people for a horse.\r\n 7.7. He continued with these operations from the year 1526 to 1533 which\r\n      were seven years, ruining and depopulating those countries, and\r\n      killing those people without pity, till news of the riches of Peru\r\n      reached the place and the Spaniards left him, and that hell ceased\r\n      for some days.\r\n 8.8. Afterwards, however, his ministers returned to commit more great\r\n      evils, robbery, wickedness, and great offence against God: and\r\n      neither have they ceased at the present time.  Thus have they almost\r\n      entirely depopulated all those three hundred leagues that were, as\r\n      has been said, so densely peopled.\r\n 9.9. No one could believe, neither could the particular cases of cruelty\r\n      that were done here, be related.  I will only tell of two or three,\r\n      that I remember.\r\n10.10. On one occasion these wretched Spaniards set out with fierce dogs\r\n      to hunt Indians, both women and men, and an Indian woman who was too\r\n      ill to escape, took a cord and, so that the dogs should not tear her\r\n      to pieces as they tore the others, she tied her little son of one\r\n      year to one foot, and then hanged herself on a beam; she was not\r\n      quick enough before the dogs came up and tore the child limb from\r\n      limb, although a friar baptised it before it expired.\r\n11.11. When the Spaniards were leaving the kingdom, one of them asked the\r\n      son of a lord of a certain town or province to go with him; the\r\n      child answered, that he did not wish to leave his country: the\r\n      Spaniard replied, “come along with me, or I will cut off your ears”;\r\n      as the boy said that he would not, the man seized a dagger and cut\r\n      off one of his ears, and then the other; and on the boy still saying\r\n      that he would not leave his country, he slit his nostrils, laughing\r\n      as though he were only giving him a pinch.\r\n12.12. This lost soul lauded himself, and shamelessly boasted before a\r\n      venerable monk that he tried his best to get many Indian women with\r\n      child, because when they were pregnant he got a better price on\r\n      selling them for slaves.\r\n13.13. In this kingdom, or possibly in a province of New Spain, a Spaniard\r\n      went hunting game, or rabbits, with his dogs; one day, not finding\r\n      anything to hunt, it seemed to him that the dogs were hungry, so he\r\n      seized a little child from its mother and cut off its arms and legs\r\n      with a dagger, giving each dog its portion and when they had eaten\r\n      these pieces he threw that little body on the ground for all of them\r\n      together.\r\n14.14. Consider only the inhumanity of the Spaniards in these parts and\r\n      how God has let them fall into reprobate appetite; consider of what\r\n      account they hold these people who are created in God’s image and\r\n      redeemed by His blood. But we shall see worse things below.\r\n15.15. Leaving the infinite and unheard of cruelties perpetrated by those\r\n      who call themselves Christians, in this kingdom where there is no\r\n      justice worth speaking of, I will conclude with this only: that when\r\n      all the infernal tyrants had left, eager for and blinded by the\r\n      riches of Peru, Fray Jacomo proceeded, with four monks of his Order\r\n      of St. Francis, to that kingdom, to pacify it, and to preach and\r\n      bring to Jesus Christ the remnant of people left from the infernal\r\n      harvesting and the tyrannical massacres committed by the Spaniards\r\n      during seven years; and I think that these monks went there in the\r\n      year thirty-four.\r\n16.16. They sent ahead certain Indians from the province of Mexico as\r\n      messengers, to inquire whether the natives were satisfied that the\r\n      said monks should enter their country, to bring them news of the one\r\n      only God, who is God and true Lord of all the world.\r\n17.17. They [the Indians] assembled many times and consulted about the\r\n      thing, having first made many inquiries as to what sort of men these\r\n      were, who called themselves _fathers_ and _brothers_, and as to what\r\n      they laid claim; and in what they were different from the Christians\r\n      from whom they had suffered so many offences and such injustice.\r\n18.18. They resolved at last to receive them, on the condition that they\r\n      came alone with no Spaniards.  The monks promised this because the\r\n      Viceroy of New Spain had granted them this privilege and had given\r\n      orders that no more Spaniards except the monks were to be allowed to\r\n      enter the country, nor should the Indians suffer any harm from the\r\n      Christians.\r\n19.19. The friars, as is their custom, preached to those people the gospel\r\n      of Christ, and the holy intentions of the king of Spain towards\r\n      them.  With such love and pleasure did they receive the doctrine and\r\n      example of the monks, and so greatly did they rejoice over the news\r\n      of the kings of Castile, of whom in all the past seven years the\r\n      Spaniards had never given them information nor that there was any\r\n      king other than he, who tyrannised and destroyed here, that after\r\n      the monks had preached there forty days, the lords of the country\r\n      brought and consigned to them all their idols that they might burn\r\n      them.\r\n20.20. And afterwards they gave them their own children, whom they love\r\n      more than the light of their eyes, that they might train them.   And\r\n      they built them churches, monasteries and houses: and friars, were\r\n      invited to other provinces, to preach and bring the natives to the\r\n      knowledge of God and of him whom they called the great king of\r\n      Castile.\r\n21.21. And, persuaded by the monks, the Indians did a thing never done\r\n      again up to the present day; and all that some of those Tyrants\r\n      pretend about those kingdoms being destroyed by the friars, is\r\n      falsehood and lies.\r\n22.22. Twelve or fifteen lords, each ruling many vassals and large\r\n      territories, assembled their people and, after taking their votes\r\n      and consent, subjected themselves of their own will to the dominion\r\n      of the kings of Castile, receiving the Emperor, as King of Spain,\r\n      for their supreme and universal sovereign; and they made some sinas,\r\n      like signatures, which I have in my possession, together with the\r\n      attestations of the said friars.\r\n23.23. Just when this growth of faith inspired the friars with great joy\r\n      and hope of drawing to Jesus Christ the still numerous people of\r\n      that kingdom who survived the murders and unjust wars, eighteen\r\n      Spanish tyrants on horse entered a certain part of the country with\r\n      twelve others on foot, which makes thirty, and they brought with\r\n      them many loads of idols taken from the Indians in other provinces.\r\n24.24. And the captain of the said thirty summoned a lord of the country\r\n      where he had entered, and told him that he must take those loads of\r\n      idols and distribute them throughout his country, trading each idol\r\n      for an Indian man or woman, to make them slaves; he threatened to\r\n      make war on the chief if he refused.\r\n25.25. Forced by fear, the said lord distributed the idols throughout all\r\n      this territory and commanded all his vassals that they should accept\r\n      and adore them, and give him Indian men and women as slaves for the\r\n      Spaniards.  In alarm, the Indians who had two children gave one of\r\n      them, and those who had three gave two; and in this way they\r\n      concluded that sacrilegious commerce and the lord, or prince\r\n      satisfied the Spaniards.\r\n26.26. One of these impious and infernal bandits, called Juan Garcia, when\r\n      ill and near death, had under his bed two loads of idols and he\r\n      commanded an Indian woman who served him, to be very careful not to\r\n      exchange those idols for fowls, but each one for a slave because\r\n      they were very valuable.  And finally with this testament and\r\n      occupied with this thought the unhappy man died.  And who doubts\r\n      that he is buried in hell?\r\n27.27. Consider therefore of what profit are the religion and the examples\r\n      of Christianity of the Spaniards who go to the Indies; what honour\r\n      they procure for God; how they work that he may be known and adored\r\n      by those people; what care they take that His holy faith be sown,\r\n      grow and expand in those souls.  And judge whether this be a less\r\n      sin than Jeroboam’s qui peccare fecit Israel by making two golden\r\n      calves, for the people to adore.  Or whether it equals that of Judas\r\n      or causes more scandal.\r\n28.28. These then are the deeds of the Spaniards who go to the Indies; in\r\n      their desire for gold they have numberless times sold, and do sell,\r\n      and have forsworn Jesus Christ.\r\n29.29. When the Indians saw that the promise the monks made them that the\r\n      Spaniards should not enter those provinces did not come true, and\r\n      that the same Spaniards brought their idols from other countries to\r\n      sell, after they had given all their own gods to the monks to be\r\n      burned, so that they might adore the one true God, they became\r\n      tumultuous and the whole country was enraged with the friars, to\r\n      whom they said:\r\n30.30. Why have you lied and deceived us saying that Christians could not\r\n      enter this country?  And why have you burnt our gods when your\r\n      Christians bring gods from other provinces to sell to us?  Were\r\n      perhaps our gods not better than those of other nations?\r\n31.31. The friars having nothing to reply, calmed them as best they could.\r\n      They sought out the thirty Spaniards, telling them the harm they had\r\n      done and beseeching them to depart, but they would not go; on the\r\n      contrary they gave the Indians to understand, that it was the friars\r\n      themselves who had made them come there,—which was the height of all\r\n      malice.\r\n32.32. At last the Indians determined to kill the friars; being warned by\r\n      some Indian, the latter escaped one night.  And when the friars had\r\n      left, and the Indians perceived their innocence and virtue and the\r\n      malice of the Spaniards, they sent messengers a distance of fifty\r\n      leagues after them, praying them to return, and asking their pardon\r\n      for the anxiety they had caused them.\r\n33.33. The friars, being servants of God and zealous for those souls, gave\r\n      them credence, and returned to the country where they were received\r\n      like angels, the Indians rendering them a thousand services; and\r\n      they stayed there four or five months longer.\r\n34.34. As that country was so distant from New Spain, the Viceroy’s\r\n      efforts to expel those Christians from it were fruitless, and they\r\n      persisted in remaining there although he had them proclaimed\r\n      traitors; and because they never ceased their outrages and habitual\r\n      oppression of the Indians, it seemed to the monks that, sooner or\r\n      later the natives would become disgusted with such perverse works,\r\n      and that perhaps the evil consequences would fall on them,\r\n      especially as the evil deeds of the Spaniards constantly disturbed\r\n      the Indians and prevented them from preaching to them in tran‐\r\n      quillity.  They therefore determined to abandon the kingdom.\r\n35.35. Thus the country was left without the light and help of doctrine;\r\n      and those souls were abandoned to the obscurity of ignorance and\r\n      misery, in which they formerly were.  The Indians were deprived,\r\n      till better times should come, of assistance and the diffusion of\r\n      the knowledge of God, which they had been already receiving with\r\n      eagerness; it was just as though we were to deprive plants of water\r\n      a few days after planting them: and this was brought about by the\r\n      inexpiable fault and consummate malice of those Spaniards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       The Province of Santa Maria\r\n\r\n\r\n   1. The province of Santa Marta was a country where the Indians had a\r\n      great deal of gold because both it and the places round about have\r\n      rich mines which were diligently worked.  And for this reason, from\r\n      the year 1498 till the present 1542, numberless Spanish tyrants have\r\n      continually gone there with ships to ravage and kill those people\r\n      and to steal their gold.  They afterwards returned in the ships with\r\n      which they made numerous expeditions, murdering and massacring, with\r\n      notorious cruelty; this commonly occurred along the seacoast and a\r\n      few leagues inland, till the year 1523.\r\n 2.2. In the year 1523 some Spanish tyrants went to take up their abode\r\n      here. And because the country, as has been said, was rich, divers\r\n      captains succeeded one another, each crueller than the other, so\r\n      that it seemed as though each had made a vow to practise more\r\n      exorbitant evils and cruelty than the other, in verification of the\r\n      rule we have given above.\r\n 3.3. In the year 1529 there arrived a great tyrant accompanied by many\r\n      men, devoid of any fear of God or any mercy on mankind; so great\r\n      were the massacres, slaughter and impiety he perpetrated, that he\r\n      surpassed all his predecessors.  During the space of six, or seven\r\n      years that he lived, he and his men stole much treasure. (96)\r\n 4.4. He died without sacraments after also avoiding the commission of\r\n      investigation met on his account; and afterwards, other murderous\r\n      and thieving tyrants succeeded, who continued to destroy those\r\n      people who had survived the treatment and cruel swords of their\r\n      predecessors.\r\n 5.5. They marched far inland, ruining and exterminating large and\r\n      numerous provinces; killing, and making slaves of their people in\r\n      the ways above told of the others, putting lords and their vassals\r\n      to grievous tortures to force them to disclose the gold and the town\r\n      where it was to be had: as has been said they surpassed, both in\r\n      number and quality, the operations of all their predecessors so that\r\n      from the said year 1529, till to-day, they have devastated in those\r\n      parts more than four hundred leagues of country, which was as\r\n      densely peopled as the other.\r\n 6.6. I truthfully declare that if I had to relate singly the evil, the\r\n      massacres, the destruction, injustice, violence, slaughter, and the\r\n      great sins the Spaniards have committed in this Kingdom of Santa\r\n      Marta, against God, against the King, and against those innocent\r\n      nations, I would compose a very long history; I shall relate all\r\n      this however in due time, if God gives me life.\r\n 7.7. Here I wish only to quote some few of the words that the lord bishop\r\n      of that province now writes to the King: and the date of his letter\r\n      is the 20th of May, 1541, in which among other words he says thus:\r\n 8.8. “I assert, oh Sacred Cæsar, that the way to remedy the ills of this\r\n      country is for Your Majesty to now take it out of the hands of\r\n      step-fathers and to give it a husband, who will treat it justly, and\r\n      as it deserves; and this as soon as possible because otherwise I am\r\n      certain that the way these tyrants who now have the government,\r\n      crush and harass it, will very soon destroy it,” etc.\r\n 9.9. And further on he says: “therefore Your Majesty will clearly discern\r\n      that those who govern in these parts, deserve to be destroyed, to\r\n      relieve the republics.  And if this is not done, their infirmities\r\n      are, in my opinion, without remedy. And Your Majesty will know in\r\n      like manner that in these parts there are no Christians but demons;\r\n      neither are there servants of God nor of the King, but traitors to\r\n      His law, and to the King.”\r\n10.10. “Because in truth, the greatest obstacle I find to winning the\r\n      Indians from war to peace, and from peace to the knowledge of our\r\n      Holy Faith, is the harsh and cruel treatment that the peaceable ones\r\n      receive from the Christians.”\r\n11.11. “They have on this account become so fierce and enraged, that\r\n      nothing is more hated or abhorred by them, than the name of\r\n      Christians, whom in all this country they call in their language\r\n      Yares, which means demons; and without doubt they are right, because\r\n      the deeds they do here are not those of Christians nor of reasonable\r\n      men, but of devils.”\r\n12.12. “From which it arises, that the Indians, seeing these perverse\r\n      operations are general, and that both the commanders and the\r\n      subordinates are so devoid of mercy, think that such is the law of\r\n      the Christians, of which their God and their King are the authors.\r\n      And to try to persuade them to the contrary is like trying to dry up\r\n      the sea, and only makes them laugh and jeer at Jesus Christ and His\r\n      law.”\r\n13.13. “And the Indian warriors, seeing the treatment shown the peaceable\r\n      people, count it better to die once, than many times in the power of\r\n      the Spaniards; I know this most invincible Caesar from experience”\r\n      etc.\r\n14.14. And in a chapter further on he says: “Your Majesty has more\r\n      servants in these parts than is supposed; because there is not a\r\n      soldier among those here who, while he is assassinating, or robbing,\r\n      or destroying, or killing, or burning Your Majesty’s vassals to\r\n      force their gold from them, does not make bold to claim that he is\r\n      serving Your Majesty.  It would therefore be well, Most Christian\r\n      Cæsar, that Your Majesty should make known by rigorously punishing\r\n      some of them, that such services as are contrary to the service of\r\n      God, are not accepted.”\r\n15.15. All the above are formal words of the said Bishop of Santa Marta,\r\n      and from them it will be clearly seen what is done to-day in these\r\n      unfortunate countries, and to these innocent people.\r\n16.16. By \"Indian warriors\" he means those who live in the mountains and\r\n      have been able to escape from massacres perpetrated by the unhappy\r\n      Spaniards.  And he terms “peaceable” those Indians whom the\r\n      Spaniards, after having killed numberless people, condemn to the\r\n      aforesaid tyrannical and horrible slavery, in which they then finish\r\n      destroying and killing them, as appears from the quoted words of the\r\n      bishop: and in truth very little indeed does he express, of what\r\n      they suffer.\r\n17.17. When the Spaniards make them labour, carrying loads over the\r\n      mountains, they kick and beat them, and knock out their teeth with\r\n      the handles of their swords, to force them to get up when they fall,\r\n      fainting from weakness, and to go on without taking breath; and the\r\n      Indians commonly exclaim; “go to, how wicked you are: I am worn out\r\n      so kill me here, for I would rather die now and here.”  And they say\r\n      this with many sighs and gasps, showing great anguish and grief.\r\n18.18. Oh! who could express the hundredth part of the affliction and\r\n      calamity that these innocent people suffer from the unhappy\r\n      Spaniards!  May God make it known to those who can, and ought to\r\n      remedy it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        The Province of Cartagena\r\n\r\n\r\n   1. This province of Cartagena lies westward and fifty leagues below\r\n      that of Santa Marta, and bordering on that of Cenù as far as the\r\n      Gulf of Urabà: it comprises about a hundred leagues of seacoast and\r\n      a large territory inland towards the south.\r\n 2.2. These provinces have been as badly treated as those of Santa Marta,\r\n      distressed, killed, depopulated and devastated, from the year 1498\r\n      or 99 until to-day, and in them many notorious cruelties, murders,\r\n      and robberies have been committed by the Spaniards; but in order to\r\n      finish this brief compendium quickly and to recount the wickedness\r\n      done by them elsewhere, I will not describe the details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             The Pearl Coast\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Paria, and the Island of Trinidad\r\n\r\n\r\n   1. Great and notorious have been the destruction that the Spaniards\r\n      have worked along the Coast of Paria, (97) extending for two hundred\r\n      leagues as far as the Gulf of Venezuela, assassinating the\r\n      inhabitants and capturing as many as they could alive, to sell them\r\n      as slaves.\r\n 2.2. They frequently took them by violating their pledged word and\r\n      friendship, the Spaniards failing to keep faith, while the Indians\r\n      received them in their houses, like fathers receive their children,\r\n      giving them all they possessed and serving them to the best of their\r\n      ability.\r\n 3.3. Certainly it would not be easy to relate, or describe minutely the\r\n      variety and number of the injustices, wrongs, oppressions, and\r\n      injury practised upon the people of this coast by the Spaniards from\r\n      the year 1510 up to the present day.  I will relate but two or three\r\n      instances from which the villany and number of the others, worthy of\r\n      punishment by every torment and fire may be judged.\r\n 4.4. In the island of Trinidad which joins the continent at Paria, and is\r\n      much larger and more prosperous than Sicily, there are as good and\r\n      virtuous people as in all the Indies; an assassin going there in the\r\n      year 1516, with sixty or seventy other habitual robbers, gave the\r\n      Indians to understand that they had come to dwell and live in that\r\n      island along with them.\r\n 5.5. The Indians received them as though they were children of their own\r\n      flesh and blood, the lords and their subjects serving them with the\r\n      greatest affection and joy, bringing them every day double the\r\n      amount of food required; for it is the usual disposition and\r\n      liberality of all the Indians of this new world to give the\r\n      Spaniards in excess of all they need and as much as they themselves\r\n      possess.\r\n 6.6. In accordance with the Spaniards’ wish, they built one great house\r\n      of timber, where all might live: they needed no more than one in\r\n      order to carry out what they had in mind and afterwards\r\n      accomplished.\r\n 7.7. When they were putting the straw over the timbers and had covered\r\n      about the height of two paces so that those inside no longer saw\r\n      those without, the Spaniards, under pretence of hurrying on the\r\n      completion of the house, induced many people to go inside; meanwhile\r\n      they divided, some surrounding the house outside, with their weapons\r\n      ready for the Indians who should come out, and the others stationing\r\n      themselves inside the house.  The latter drew their swords and\r\n      threatening the naked Indians with death if they moved, they began\r\n      to bind them, while some who ran out seeking to escape were cut to\r\n      pieces with swords.\r\n 8.8. Some who got out, wounded, and others sound, joined with one or two\r\n      hundred natives who had not entered the house, and arming themselves\r\n      with bows and arrows they retired to another house of the\r\n      community’s to defend themselves; while they defended the door\r\n      however, the Spaniards set fire to the house, and burnt them alive;\r\n      they then took the prey they had captured, amounting to perhaps a\r\n      hundred and eighty or two hundred men, and carried them bound to\r\n      their ship.  Hoisting sail they departed for the island of San Juan,\r\n      where they sold one half as slaves, and afterwards to Hispaniola,\r\n      where they sold the remainder.\r\n 9.9. When I at the time reproved the captain in the same island of San\r\n      Juan for such infamous treachery and malice, he replied “Go to,\r\n      Senor, thus was I commanded, and instructions were given me by those\r\n      who sent me, that if I could not capture them in war, I should take\r\n      them under pretext of peace.”\r\n10.10. And in truth he told me that in all his life he had found neither\r\n      father nor mother, if not in the island of Trinidad; such were the\r\n      good services the Indians had rendered him.  This he said to his\r\n      greater shame and the aggravation of his sins.\r\n11.11. Numberless times have they done these things on this continent,\r\n      capturing people and making them slaves under promise of safe\r\n      conduct.  Let it be seen what sort of acts these are: and whether\r\n      those Indians taken in such a way, are justly made slaves.\r\n12.12. Another time the friars of our Order of St. Dominic determined to\r\n      go and preach to those people and convert them, for they were\r\n      without the hope or the light of doctrine by which to save their\r\n      souls, as they still are to-day in the Indies; they sent a monk, who\r\n      was a theological scholar of great virtue and sanctity, accompanied\r\n      by a serving friar as his companion; his object was to see the\r\n      country, become intimate with the people, and seek convenient sites\r\n      to build monasteries.\r\n13.13. When the monks arrived, the Indians received them as angels from\r\n      heaven, and listened with great affection, attention, and joy to\r\n      those words which they could make them understand more by signs than\r\n      speech, as they did not know the language.\r\n14.14. It happened that after the departure of the vessel that had brought\r\n      the monks, another ship arrived there; the Spaniards on board of it\r\n      practising their infernal custom, deceitfully enticed the lord of\r\n      that land, named Don Alonso, on board without the monks perceiving\r\n      it; either the friars or some other Spaniards, had given him this\r\n      name, for the Indians like and desire Christian names and at once\r\n      ask to have them, even before they know enough to be baptised. So\r\n      they deceived the said Don Alonso, to make him come aboard their\r\n      ship, with his wife and certain other persons, by telling him they\r\n      would prepare a feast there for him.\r\n15.15. At last seventeen persons went on board with the lord and his wife,\r\n      confident that as the monks were in the country, out of respect for\r\n      them, the Spaniards would not do anything wicked; because otherwise\r\n      they would not have trusted them.  Once the Indians were on the\r\n      ship, the traitors set sail and were off to Hispaniola, where they\r\n      sold them for slaves.\r\n16.16. On seeing their lord and his wife carried off, all the Indians came\r\n      to the friars intending to kill them.  The friars were like to die\r\n      for sorrow on beholding such great villany, and it may be believed\r\n      they would have rather given their lives than that such injustice\r\n      should have been done; especially as it impeded those souls from\r\n      ever hearing or believing the word of God.\r\n17.17. They called the Indians as best they could and told them that by\r\n      the first ship that passed there, they would write to Hispaniola and\r\n      bring about the restoration of their lord and of the others who were\r\n      with him. For the greater confirmation of the damnation of those who\r\n      were governing, God caused a ship to come at once to hand.  The\r\n      monks wrote to their brethren in Hispaniola lamenting and protesting\r\n      repeatedly.  The auditors never would do justice, because they\r\n      themselves had divided a share of the Indians so barbarously and\r\n      unjustly carried off by the tyrants.\r\n18.18. The two monks who had promised the Indians that their lord, Don\r\n      Alonso, together with the others, should return in four months’\r\n      time, seeing that they did not come, neither in four, nor in eight\r\n      months prepared for death, and to give their lives to those to whom\r\n      they had consecrated them before they left.  And so the Indians took\r\n      vengeance upon them, killing them justly, although they were\r\n      innocent: because it was believed that the monks had been the cause\r\n      of that treachery, and because they saw that what had been\r\n      faithfully promised them within four months was not fulfilled; and\r\n      also because up to that time and up to the present day they neither\r\n      knew, nor know, that there is a difference between the friars and\r\n      the Spanish tyrants, bandits, and assassins of all that country.\r\n19.19. The blessed friars suffered unjustly, and by that injustice there\r\n      is no doubt that, according to our holy faith, they are true\r\n      martyrs, and reign blissfully to-day with God in the heavens; for\r\n      they were sent to that land under obedience, and their intention was\r\n      to preach and spread the holy faith, to save all those souls and to\r\n      suffer every kind of affliction and death that might be offered them\r\n      for Jesus Christ crucified.\r\n20.20. Another time, through the great tyranny and execrable works of the\r\n      wicked Spaniards, the Indians killed two monks of St. Dominic and\r\n      one of St. Francis, of which I myself am a witness, for I escaped\r\n      the same death by divine miracle; so serious and horrible was the\r\n      case I might have much to say that would amaze mankind, but on\r\n      account of the length of the narration I will not relate it here nor\r\n      until the time comes.  The last day will disclose all more clearly,\r\n      for God will then avenge such horrible and abominable outrages as\r\n      are done in the Indies by those who bear the name of Christians.\r\n21.21. Another time there was a town in the provinces called Capo della\r\n      Codera, the lord of which was called Nigoroto; this is either a\r\n      personal name or else one common to all the lords of that country.\r\n22.22. He was so kind and his people so virtuous, that when the Spanish\r\n      ships passed there the Spaniards found comforts, provisions, rest,\r\n      and every consolation and refreshment, and many did he deliver from\r\n      death, who, wasted with hunger, took refuge there from other\r\n      provinces where they had assassinated, and practised evil and\r\n      tyranny.  He gave them food and sent them safe to the Pearl Island\r\n      [Cubagua], where some Christians dwelt, whom he could have slain,\r\n      without any one knowing it, and did not: all the Christians finally\r\n      called Nigoroto’s town the mansion and home of everybody.\r\n23.23. An ill-starred tyrant deliberated within himself to attack this\r\n      place, as the people felt so safe: so he went there with a ship and\r\n      invited many people to come on board, as they were used to, trusting\r\n      the Spaniards.  When many men, women, and children were gathered in\r\n      the ship, he set sail and came to the island of San Juan, where he\r\n      sold them all as slaves.  And I arrived just then at the said island\r\n      and saw that tyrant and heard what he had done.\r\n24.24. He left all that country ruined; and all those Spanish tyrants, who\r\n      robbed and assassinated along those coasts took it ill, and detested\r\n      so dreadful a deed because they lost the asylum and dwelling place\r\n      they had had there as though in their own houses.\r\n25.25. To abbreviate, I omit the narration of the tremendous wickedness\r\n      and fearful deeds that have been committed, and are committed to-day\r\n      in these countries.\r\n26.26. They have taken more than two million ruined souls from that\r\n      populous seacoast to the island of Hispaniola, and to that of San\r\n      Juan, where they have likewise caused their death in the mines and\r\n      other works, of which there were many, as has been said above.  And\r\n      it excites great compassion and sorrow to see all that most\r\n      delightful coast deserted and depopulated.\r\n27.27. It is certainly true, that never does a ship sail loaded with\r\n      kidnapped and ruined Indians (as I have told) without the third part\r\n      of those that embarked, being thrown dead into the sea, besides\r\n      those that they kill in effecting their capture.\r\n28.28. The reason of this is, that as they need many men to accomplish\r\n      their aim of making more money from a greater number of slaves, they\r\n      carry but little food and water, so as to save expense to the\r\n      tyrants, who call themselves privateers; they have enough for only a\r\n      few more people than the Spaniards who man the ships to make the\r\n      raids; as these miserable Indians are in want and die of hunger and\r\n      thirst, the remedy is to throw them in the sea.\r\n29.29. And in truth, one of them told me, that from the Lucayan Islands,\r\n      where very great havoc of this sort was made, to the Island of\r\n      Hispaniola, which is more than sixty or seventy leagues, a ship is\r\n      supposed to have gone without compass or nautical chart, finding its\r\n      course by the trail of dead Indians who had been thrown out of ships\r\n      and left in the sea.\r\n30.30. When they are afterwards disembarked at the island where they are\r\n      taken to be sold, it is enough to break the heart of whomsoever has\r\n      some spark of compassion to see naked, starving children, old\r\n      people, men, and women falling, faint from hunger.\r\n31.31. They then divide them like so many lambs, the fathers separated\r\n      from the children, and the wives from the husbands, making droves of\r\n      ten or twenty persons and casting lots for them, so that each of the\r\n      unhappy privateers who contributed to fit out a fleet of two or\r\n      three vessels, and the tyrant villains who go to capture and prey\r\n      upon the natives in their homes, receives his share.\r\n32.32. And when the lot falls on a drove in which there is some old or ill\r\n      person, the tyrant who gets it, says: “Why in the devil do you give\r\n      this old man to me? That I shall bury him? Why should I take this\r\n      ill one? To nurse him?”  It may be seen how the Spaniards despise\r\n      the Indians and whether they carry out the precept of divine love to\r\n      one’s neighbour, upon which rest the law and the prophets.\r\n33.33. The tyranny exercised by the Spaniards upon the Indians in fishing\r\n      pearls, is as cruel, and reprehensible a thing as there can be in\r\n      the world.  Upon the land there is no life so infernal and hopeless\r\n      as to be compared to it, although that of digging gold in the mines\r\n      is the hardest and worst.\r\n34.34. They let them down into the sea three and four and five fathoms\r\n      deep, from the morning till sunset.  They are always swimming under\r\n      water without respite, gathering the oysters, in which the pearls\r\n      grow.\r\n35.35. They come up to breathe bringing little nets full of them; there is\r\n      a hangman Spaniard in a boat and if they linger resting, he beats\r\n      them with his fists, and, taking them by the hair, throws them in\r\n      the water to go on fishing.\r\n36.36. Their food is fish and the fish that contain the pearls, and a\r\n      little cazabi or maize bread, which are the kinds of native bread:\r\n      the one gives very little sustenance and the other is very difficult\r\n      to make, so with such food they are never sufficiently nourished.\r\n      Instead of giving them beds at night, they put them in stocks on the\r\n      ground, to prevent them from escaping.\r\n37.37. Many times the Indians throw themselves into the sea while fishing\r\n      or hunting pearls and never come up again, because dolphins and\r\n      sharks, which are two kinds of very cruel sea animals that swallow a\r\n      man whole, kill and eat them.\r\n38.38. From this it may be seen, whether the Spaniards who thus seek\r\n      profit from the pearls, observe the divine precepts of love to God\r\n      and one’s neighbour; out of avarice, they put their fellow creatures\r\n      in danger of death to the body and also to the soul; because they\r\n      die without faith and without sacraments.\r\n39.39. They lead the Indians such a wretched life that they ruin and waste\r\n      them in a few days; for it is impossible for men to live much under\r\n      water without respiration, especially because the cold of the water\r\n      penetrates their bodies and so they generally all die from\r\n      hæmorrhages, oppression of the chest caused by staying such long\r\n      stretches of time without breathing; and from dysentery caused by\r\n      the frigidity.\r\n40.40. Their hair, which is by nature black, changes to an ashen colour\r\n      like the skin of seals, and nitre comes out from their shoulders so\r\n      that they resemble human monsters of some species.\r\n41.41. With this insupportable toil, or rather, infernal trade, the\r\n      Spaniards completed the destruction of all the Indians of the\r\n      Lucayan Islands who were there when they set themselves to making\r\n      these gains; each one was worth fifty and a hundred crowns, and they\r\n      were sold publicly, although it had been prohibited by the\r\n      magistrates themselves; it was even more unjust elsewhere for the\r\n      Lucayans were great swimmers.  They have caused the death of\r\n      numberless others here, from other provinces, and other regions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            The Yuyapari River\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a river called the Yuyapari, which flows for more than two hundred\r\nleagues through the province of Paria, a wretched tyrant(98) sailed a\r\ngreat distance in the year 1539, accompanied by four hundred or more men;\r\nand he did very great slaughter, burning alive and putting to the sword\r\nnumberless innocent and inoffensive people who were in their towns or\r\nhouses, unsuspicious of danger; and he left immense tracts of country\r\nburnt, terrorized, and the inhabitants scattered.  He finally died a bad\r\ndeath and his fleet was dispersed.  Other tyrants succeeded him and\r\ncontinued this wickedness and tyranny: and to-day they go through those\r\nregions destroying, killing, and sending to hell those souls that were\r\nredeemed by the son of God with His own blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         The Kingdom of Venezuela\r\n\r\n\r\n   1. The Spaniards have always exercised diligent care to hide the truth\r\n      from our lord the King about injuries and losses to God, to human\r\n      souls, and to his State; and in the year 1526, he was deceived and\r\n      perniciously persuaded into giving and conceding to some German\r\n      merchants, the great kingdom of Venezuela which is much larger than\r\n      all Spain; the entire management of the government and all\r\n      jurisdiction were conceded under a certain agreement and compact, or\r\n      condition that was made with them. (99)\r\n 2.2. These men invaded these countries with a force of three hundred or\r\n      more and found the people the same gentle lambs, (and much more so),\r\n      as they usually find them everywhere in the Indies before the\r\n      Spaniards injure them.\r\n 3.3. More cruel beyond comparison than any of the other tyrants we have\r\n      told of, was their invasion; and more irrational and furious were\r\n      they than the cruellest tigers, or raging wolves and lions.  Their\r\n      liberty of action was the greater because they held all the\r\n      jurisdiction of the country; with greater eagerness and blind\r\n      greediness of avarice, and with ways and arts for stealing and\r\n      accumulating gold and silver more exquisite than their predecessors,\r\n      they abandoned all fear of God and the King and all shame of men,\r\n      forgetting that they were mortal beings.\r\n 4.4. These devils incarnate have devastated, destroyed, and depopulated\r\n      more than four hundred leagues of most delightful country containing\r\n      large and marvellous provinces, valleys extending for forty leagues,\r\n      pleasant regions, very large towns, most rich in gold.\r\n 5.5. They have killed and entirely cut to pieces divers large nations and\r\n      destroyed many languages, so that not a person who speaks them\r\n      remains, except a few, who have hidden in caverns and in the bowels\r\n      of the earth to escape from the pestilential sword of the\r\n      foreigners.\r\n  66. They have killed, destroyed, and sent to hell, (according to my\r\n      belief), more than four or five millions of those innocent races by\r\n      means of various strange and new kinds of cruel iniquity and\r\n      impiety; nor do they, at the present day, cease sending them there.\r\n 7.7. I will relate no more than three or four instances of the endless\r\n      injustice, outrages, and slaughter they have done, and are doing\r\n      to-day; it may be imagined from these what they must have done to\r\n      accomplish the great destruction and depopulation we have described.\r\n 8.8. They took the supreme lord of all the province, putting him to\r\n      torture, for no other reason than to obtain his gold.  He escaped\r\n      and fled to the mountains, where he remained in hiding amongst the\r\n      rocks, with his enraged and terrified people.  The Spaniards\r\n      attacked them in their search for him; they recaptured him and,\r\n      after cruel slaughter, they sold at auction all whom they took\r\n      alive.\r\n 9.9. Before they captured that ruler, they had been received in many, nay\r\n      in all the provinces, wherever they went, with singing and dances\r\n      and many gifts of large quantities of gold; the payment they made\r\n      the Indians was to put them to the sword and cut them to pieces in\r\n      order to terrorise the whole country.\r\n10.10. Once, when the inhabitants had come out to meet him in the\r\n      aforesaid way, the tyrant German captain put a great number of\r\n      people into a large straw louse and cut them to pieces.  As the\r\n      house had some beams at the top and many climbed up to escape from\r\n      the bloody hands and swords of those men or pitiless beasts, this\r\n      infernal man caused fire to be set to the house; thus all who\r\n      remained were burnt alive. This action caused the depopulation of a\r\n      great number of towns as all the people fled to the mountains where\r\n      they hoped to be safe.\r\n11.11. They came to another large province on the borders of the province\r\n      and kingdom of Santa Marta, where they found the Indians in their\r\n      towns and houses, peaceably occupied with their affairs.  They\r\n      stayed with them a long time, eating their substance while the\r\n      Indians served them as though it were their duty to give them life\r\n      and succour; they bore with their continual oppressions and usual\r\n      exactions, which are intolerable, for one parasite Spaniard eats as\r\n      much in one day as would be sufficient for an Indian household of\r\n      ten persons for a month.\r\n12.12. During this time, the Indians spontaneously gave them great\r\n      quantities of gold, besides the best of treatment.  At last when the\r\n      tyrants wished to depart, they determined to repay their hospitality\r\n      in this following manner.\r\n13.13. The German governor, who was a tyrant and, for what we know also a\r\n      heretic—for he never attends mass neither does he let many others\r\n      go, besides which, other signs mark him as a Lutheran,—ordered his\r\n      men to capture all the Indians they could, with their wives and\r\n      children, and to confine them in a large yard or wooden enclosure\r\n      prepared for the purpose; he then announced that whoever wished to\r\n      go out and be free, must ransom himself according to the will of the\r\n      iniquitous governor, giving so much gold for himself, so much for\r\n      his wife and for each of his children; and to force them the more,\r\n      he commanded that nothing whatever should be given them to eat,\r\n      until they brought him the gold he demanded as ransom.\r\n14.14. Many who were able, sent to their houses for gold and redeemed\r\n      themselves.  They were set free, and returned to their occupations\r\n      and to their houses to provide themselves with the necessaries of\r\n      life. The tyrant sent certain villainous Spanish thieves to\r\n      recapture these miserable Indians, who had once ransomed themselves;\r\n      they brought them back to the enclosure and tortured them with\r\n      hunger and thirst to make them ransom themselves again.\r\n15.15. Many who were captured were ransomed two and three times.  Others\r\n      who could not, because they had given all the gold they possessed\r\n      and had not enough left, he left languishing in the enclosure till\r\n      they died of hunger.\r\n16.16. By this deed, he left ruined, desolate, and depopulated, a most\r\n      populous province most rich in gold, which has a valley of forty\r\n      leagues, where he burnt a town that had a thousand houses.\r\n17.17. This infernal tyrant determined to go inland, as he eagerly desired\r\n      to discover the hell of Peru in those parts.  To make this unhappy\r\n      journey, he, and the others brought numberless Indians, chained to\r\n      one another, carrying loads of sixty, and seventy pounds each.\r\n18.18. If one tired, or fainted from hunger, fatigue, and weakness, they\r\n      at once cut off his head at the collar of the chain so as not to\r\n      stop to loosen the others in the line; and the head fell to one side\r\n      and the body to the other, and they distributed his load among the\r\n      other bearers.\r\n1919. To tell of the provinces he destroyed, the towns, and places he\r\n      burnt (for all the houses are built of straw)—the people he killed,\r\n      the cruelty he displayed in the several massacres during this\r\n      journey, would make an incredible and terrifying story, but it would\r\n      be true, nevertheless.\r\n20.20. These journeys were afterwards undertaken by other tyrants who\r\n      followed in the same Venezuela, and others from the province of\r\n      Santa Marta, animated by the same holy intention of discovering this\r\n      holy house of gold in Peru; and they found all the country for more\r\n      than two hundred leagues, so much burnt, depopulated, and deserted,\r\n      from formerly being most populous and prosperous, as has been said,\r\n      that though they themselves were cruel tyrants, they marvelled and\r\n      were horrified to behold the traces of such lamentable devastation.\r\n21.21. Many witnesses have proved these things before the chancellor of\r\n      the exchequer of the India Council and the proofs are in the\r\n      possession of the same Council but they have never burnt alive any\r\n      of these nefarious tyrants.\r\n22.22. But what has been proven is as nothing compared to the massacres\r\n      and great wickedness that have been committed, because all the\r\n      officers of justice in the Indies are so mortally blind that they do\r\n      not investigate the crimes, destruction, and slaughter that have\r\n      been, and are to-day wrought by all the tyrants of the Indies,\r\n      beyond declaring that as such and such a one has used cruelty\r\n      towards the Indians, the King’s revenue has lost so many thousand\r\n      crowns; they are satisfied with little proof, and that of a very\r\n      general and confused character.\r\n23.23. And even this they do not verify, nor make it as clear as they\r\n      should; for if they did their duty to God and the king, they would\r\n      discover that the said German tyrants have robbed the king of more\r\n      than three million crowns’ worth of gold, because that province of\r\n      Venezuela, with the others they have ruined, devastated, and\r\n      depopulated for an extent of more than four hundred leagues, (as I\r\n      have said) was the most prosperous, the richest in gold, and the\r\n      most populous of the universe.\r\n24.24. During the sixteen years those tyrants, enemies of God, devastated\r\n      it, they have wasted and caused the loss of more than two millions\r\n      of revenue that the king of Spain would have drawn from that\r\n      kingdom. Nor is there hope of repairing this damage between now and\r\n      the end of the world, unless God, through a miracle, should\r\n      resuscitate so many million persons.\r\n25.25. These are the temporal injuries to the king. It would be well to\r\n      consider what, and how many are the injuries, the dishonour,\r\n      blasphemies, and insults to God and His law, and with what will be\r\n      requited so many numberless souls, burning in hell, because of the\r\n      avarice and cruelty of these tyrant animals or Germans. (100)\r\n26.26. To sum up this wickedness and ferocity, I will only say that from\r\n      the day the Germans entered the country till the present time, that\r\n      is in these sixteen years, the Indians they have transported in\r\n      their ships amount to more than a million who were sold as slaves in\r\n      Santa Marta, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and the island of San Juan.\r\n27.27. And even now, in the year 1542, the traffic continues, for the\r\n      royal Audiencia of Hispaniola dissembled—nay favoured this and all\r\n      the other numberless acts of tyranny and destruction done along all\r\n      that coast of the continent, which is more than four hundred leagues\r\n      from Venezuela to Santa Marta, and is under their jurisdiction,\r\n      though they could have prevented and corrected them.\r\n28.28. There has been no other reason to make slaves of all these Indians\r\n      except the perverse, blind, obstinate will of these most avaricious\r\n      tyrants, and to satisfy their insatiable avarice for money; just as\r\n      all the others have always done everywhere in the Indies, taking\r\n      those lambs and sheep away from their houses, their wives, and their\r\n      children in the said cruel and wicked ways, marking them with the\r\n      king’s brand to sell them as slaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   The Provinces of that Part of the Continent which is Called Florida\r\n\r\n\r\n   1. These provinces(101) have been visited at divers times since the\r\n      year 1510 or 1511 by three tyrants who imitated the deeds done by\r\n      the others, and also by two of them in other parts of the Indies\r\n      seeking to advance to a degree disproportioned to their merit, at\r\n      the cost of the blood and destruction of their fellow creatures.\r\n 2.2. And all three died a bad death, and their families and properties\r\n      established in human blood, perished, for I am witness of all three,\r\n      whose very memory is already as extinct in the world as though they\r\n      had never lived.\r\n 3.3. The infamy and horror of their names scandalised all the land\r\n      because of some massacres they perpetrated: these were not many,\r\n      however, for God killed them before they did more, for He had\r\n      reserved till that hour the punishment for the wickedness that I\r\n      know and saw they committed in other parts of the Indies.\r\n 4.4. The fourth tyrant went there recently, in the year 1538, with his\r\n      plans made and with great preparations. Since three years nothing\r\n      has been seen or heard of him.\r\n 5.5. We are sure, that as soon as he landed he committed cruel deeds and\r\n      at once disappeared: and that, if he be alive, he and his men have\r\n      destroyed numbers of people in these three years, if he encountered\r\n      any on his march, for he is one of the notorious, and experienced\r\n      ones who, together with his other companions, has done the most harm\r\n      and wickedness, and has destroyed many provinces, and kingdoms.  But\r\n      we rather believe that God has given him the same end as the others.\r\n 6.6. Three or four years after the above things were written, three of\r\n      the other tyrants returned from the land called Florida; they had\r\n      accompanied the chief tyrant whom they left dead, and we learned\r\n      from them what cruelty and unheard of wickedness, these inhuman men\r\n      committed there against those innocent and harmless Indians,\r\n      principally during the life of their commander and also after his\r\n      unhappy death: therefore what I foretold above has not turned out\r\n      wrong.\r\n 7.7. And so many things confirm the rule I laid down at the beginning:\r\n      that the more they continue to discover, ruin, and destroy both\r\n      peoples and countries, the more notorious are the cruelties and\r\n      iniquities they commit against God and their fellow creatures.\r\n 8.8. It is already wearisome to us to relate so many, and such execrable,\r\n      horrible, blood-thirsty operations, not by men, but by ferocious\r\n      beasts, hence I will not stop to relate any but the following.\r\n 9.9. They found large towns full of people who were friendly,\r\n      intelligent, politic, and orderly.  They did great slaughter among\r\n      them, according to their custom, in order to impregnate the hearts\r\n      of those people with fear of them.\r\n10.10. They tormented and killed them, loading them like animals.  When\r\n      one became tired, or fainted, they cut off his head at the neck, in\r\n      order not to free those in front from the chain that bound them, and\r\n      the body fell to one side and the head to the other, as we have told\r\n      elsewhere above.\r\n11.11. In one town where they went they were received with joy, and\r\n      over-abundant food was given them, while more than six hundred\r\n      Indians carried their loads, like beasts of burden, and cared for\r\n      their horses; when the tyrants had left there, a captain who was a\r\n      relative of the chief tyrant, turned back to rob the entire town\r\n      whose people felt themselves safe; and with a lance, he killed the\r\n      lord and king of the town, and did other cruel deeds.\r\n12.12. Because the inhabitants of another large town seemed to them to be\r\n      a little more on their guard, on account of the infamous and\r\n      horrible deeds of which they had heard, they put to the sword large\r\n      and small children and old people, subjects and lords, without\r\n      sparing any one.\r\n13.13. It is said that the chief tyrant had the faces of many Indians cut,\r\n      so that they were shorn of nostrils and lips, down to the beard; and\r\n      in particular of a group of two hundred whom he either summoned or\r\n      who came voluntarily from a certain town.  Thus he despatched these\r\n      mutilated, suffering creatures dripping with blood to carry the news\r\n      of the deeds and miracles done by those baptised Christians,\r\n      preachers of the Holy Catholic faith.\r\n14.14. It may be judged in what state those people must be, how they must\r\n      love the Christians, and how they will believe that their God is\r\n      good and just, and that the law and religion they profess and\r\n      praise, is immaculate.\r\n15.15. Most great and outlandish are the evils done here by those unhappy\r\n      men, sons of perdition.  And thus the wickedest of captains died\r\n      miserably and without confession; and we doubt not that he is buried\r\n      in hell, unless by chance, God out of His divine mercy has\r\n      mysteriously succoured him despite his guiltiness for such execrable\r\n      wickedness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Rio della Plata\r\n\r\n\r\n   1. Three or four times since the year 1522 some captains have visited\r\n      Rio della Plata, (102) where there are large kingdoms and provinces,\r\n      and very friendly and intelligent people.\r\n 2.2. We know, in general, that they have committed many homicides and\r\n      much injury.  In particular, as it is so distant from the Indies, we\r\n      have nothing signal to tell.\r\n 3.3. We have no doubt at all, however, but that they have and do carry on\r\n      the same practices as in other places; because they are the same\r\n      Spaniards, and some among them have visited other regions, and\r\n      because they go to get wealth and power just like the others; it is\r\n      impossible for this to come about, except by destruction, massacres,\r\n      robbery, and the extermination of the Indians by the adoption of the\r\n      perverse rule and system they have all alike followed.\r\n 4.4. After writing the above, we have learned, with ample proof, that\r\n      they have destroyed and depopulated great provinces and kingdoms of\r\n      that country, murdering, and cruelly treating those unfortunate\r\n      people; they have thereby made themselves even more notorious than\r\n      the others, because, being at a greater distance from Spain, they\r\n      could do more as they pleased and consequently lived in greater\r\n      disorder and with less justice.  As for justice, however, there has\r\n      never been any in all the Indies, as is seen from what has been\r\n      related above.\r\n 5.5. Among infinite other cases, the three following have been read\r\n      before the Council of the Indies.  A tyrant governor commanded\r\n      certain of his people, to go to some Indian town and, if food was\r\n      not given them, to kill all the inhabitants.   Thus authorised, they\r\n      started and, because the Indians considered them their enemies and\r\n      more out of fear and the desire to escape from them, than from a\r\n      want of generosity, refused to supply them, the Spaniards put more\r\n      than five thousand persons to the sword.\r\n 6.6. Another time a certain number of people presented themselves\r\n      peaceably for their service, or perhaps they had been summoned by\r\n      the Spaniards; and because they did not come quickly enough, or\r\n      because, as is their habit and common usage, they wished to inspire\r\n      them with fear and horrible fright, the Governor commanded that they\r\n      should all be consigned into the hands of their Indian enemies.\r\n 7.7. They wept and cried, praying that the Spaniards  would kill them,\r\n      rather than deliver them to their enemies. (103) And as they would\r\n      not leave the house where they were, they were cut to pieces there,\r\n      weeping, and crying out: “We came peaceably to serve you and you\r\n      kill us?  May our blood, remain on these walls as testimony of our\r\n      unjust death and of your cruelty!” This was, in truth, a notorious\r\n      action, and worthy of consideration, but much more of being\r\n      lamented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              The Vast Kingdoms and Great Provinces of Peru\r\n\r\n\r\n   1. In the year 1531 another great tyrant went with certain people to\r\n      the kingdoms of Peru,(104) which he invaded by virtue of the same\r\n      title, intentions, and principles as all the former ones, because he\r\n      was one of the most experienced, and since a long time had taken\r\n      part in all the cruelties and massacres that had been committed on\r\n      the continent since the year 1510; he was devoid of faith and\r\n      honour, and he did more cruelty and slaughter, destroying towns,\r\n      killing and exterminating the people of them and causing such great\r\n      mischief in these countries that, I am certain, it would be\r\n      impossible for any one to recount and describe them till we shall\r\n      see and know them clearly in the day of judgment. I could not, nor\r\n      should I know how to describe the deformity, the character, and the\r\n      circumstances of some incidents that I would relate, and which\r\n      greatly aggravate their hideousness.\r\n 2.2. From his unhappy landing, he killed and destroyed some peoples and\r\n      robbed them of a large quantity of gold.  In an island near the same\r\n      province called Pugna which is very populous and pleasing, they were\r\n      received by the lord and people like angels from heaven and, after\r\n      having eaten all their provisions in six months, the Indians again\r\n      uncovered the store of corn they had laid up for themselves and\r\n      their families in time of drought and barrenness, tearfully offering\r\n      it for their consumption.  The payment that was finally awarded the\r\n      natives, was to put them to the sword, for they killed great numbers\r\n      with lances, and those whom they captured alive, they made slaves;\r\n      in consequence of this and the other great notorious cruelties done\r\n      there, they left this island almost deserted.\r\n 3.3. From there the Spaniards went to the province of Tumbala, which is\r\n      on the continent, where they killed and destroyed everything they\r\n      could.  And because all the people fled from their fearful and\r\n      horrible operations, they declared they had revolted and were in\r\n      rebellion against the king.\r\n 4.4. This tyrant employed the following artifice.  He demanded still more\r\n      from all who either offered or whom he asked to present him with\r\n      gold, silver, and their other possessions, until he saw that they\r\n      either had no more, or brought no more: he then declared that he\r\n      received them as vassals of the king of Spain and embraced them; he\r\n      caused two trumpets to be sounded, giving them to understand that\r\n      for the future he would take nothing more from them, nor do them any\r\n      harm; he esteemed it permissible to rob them or to take all they\r\n      gave, out of fear inspired by the abominable reports they heard of\r\n      him, before he received them under the shelter and protection of the\r\n      king, as though after they were received under the royal protection\r\n      he would no more oppress, rob, desolate, and destroy them.\r\n 5.5. A few days later came the universal king and emperor of those\r\n      kingdoms, who was called Atabaliba with many naked people armed with\r\n      ridiculous weapons and ignorant of how swords cut, and lances wound,\r\n      and horses run; nor did they know the Spaniards, who would assault\r\n      the very devils if they had gold, to rob them of it.  He arrived at\r\n      the place where they were, and said: “Where are these Spaniards? let\r\n      them come forward, for I shall not stir from here till satisfaction\r\n      is rendered me for my vassals whom they have killed, for the town\r\n      they have desolated, and for the riches they have stolen from me.”\r\n 6.6. The Spaniards attacked him—killing infinite numbers of his people;\r\n      they took him prisoner from the litter in which he was carried and\r\n      after they had captured him, they negotiated with him for his\r\n      ransom: he promised to give four million crowns, and paid them\r\n      fifteen, after which they promised to set him free.\r\n 7.7. They ended by keeping no faith nor truth, for they have never been\r\n      kept by the Spaniards in their dealings with the Indians: they\r\n      calumniated him, saying that by his orders the people were\r\n      assembling, and he replied that not a leaf moved in all the country\r\n      save by his will and that if the people were assembling, they might\r\n      believe that he was the cause of it: as he was their prisoner, they\r\n      might therefore kill him.\r\n 8.8. In spite of all this they condemned him to be burned alive, although\r\n      later, some of them begged the captain, to have him strangled and to\r\n      burn him afterwards. When he learned this he said: “Why do you wish\r\n      to burn me?  What have I done to you?  Have you not promised to free\r\n      me, after my ransom was paid?  Have I not given you more than what I\r\n      promised you?  Send me, as thus you wish it, to your King of Spain.”\r\n      He said many other things showing condemnation and detestation of\r\n      the great injustice of the Spaniards: and at last they burnt him.\r\n 9.9. Let the justice of these deeds be considered: the reason of this\r\n      war: the imprisonment, death sentence, and execution of this\r\n      monarch; and how conscientiously these tyrants hold the great\r\n      treasures they steal in those kingdoms from such a great king and\r\n      from numberless other lords and private people.\r\n10.10. Of the countless notoriously wicked and cruel acts committed in the\r\n      extirpation of these people by those who call themselves Christians,\r\n      I will relate some few that a friar of St. Francis witnessed in the\r\n      beginning; and he signed depositions with his name, sending some of\r\n      the copies to those regions and others to the kingdoms of Castile:\r\n      and I have one of the copies in my possession with his own\r\n      signature, in which he makes the following statements.\r\n11.11. “I, Fray Marcus de Nizza of the Order of St. Francis, commissary of\r\n      the friars of the same Order in the provinces of Peru, who were\r\n      among the first monks who entered the said provinces with the first\r\n      Christians, speak to render truthful testimony of some of the things\r\n      that I saw with my own eyes in that country; chiefly concerning the\r\n      treatment of the Indians and the acquisition of property taken from\r\n      the natives.”\r\n12.12. “First of all I am eye-witness, and from actual experience know,\r\n      that these Indians of Peru are the most affable people that have\r\n      been seen among the Indians, and were very well inclined and\r\n      friendly towards the Christians.”\r\n13.13. “And I saw that they gave gold abundantly to the Spaniards, and\r\n      silver and precious stones and all that was asked of them, and that\r\n      they rendered them every good service; and the Indians never went\r\n      forth in war fashion, but always peaceably, as long as no cruelty\r\n      and ill-treatment provoked them; on the contrary, they received the\r\n      Spaniards with all benevolence and honour in their towns, giving\r\n      them provisions and as many male and female slaves for their\r\n      service, as they asked.”\r\n14.14. “I am also witness, and I testify, that without the Indians giving\r\n      them any cause or occasion, the Spaniards, as soon as they entered\r\n      their country, and after the chief lord Atabaliba had paid them more\r\n      than two millions of gold and had left all the country in their\r\n      power, without resistance, immediately burnt the said Atabaliba, who\r\n      was ruler of all the country: and after him, they burnt alive his\r\n      captain-general Cochilimaca who had come peaceably to the governor,\r\n      accompanied by other high personages.”\r\n15.15. “Within a few days after these executions they likewise burned\r\n      Chamba another very high lord of the province of Quito, without him\r\n      giving them any cause.”\r\n16.16. “Thus too they burnt unjustly Chapera lord of the Canaries.”\r\n17.17. “Likewise they burnt the feet of Luis who was one of the great\r\n      lords in Quito, and tortured him in many other ways, to force him to\r\n      reveal the hiding place of Atabaliba’s gold, of which treasure it\r\n      was known that he knew nothing whatever.”\r\n18.18. “They likewise burnt in Quito, Cozzopanga, who was governor of all\r\n      the provinces of Quito and who had responded to the intimations of\r\n      Sebastian de Benalcazza, the governor’s captain, by coming\r\n      peaceably; but because he did not give them as much gold as they\r\n      asked, they burnt him, with many other lords and principal persons.\r\n      As far as I could understand, it was the intention of the Spaniards\r\n      that no lord should survive in all the country.”\r\n19.19. “The Spaniards assembled a large number of Indians, and shut up as\r\n      many as could enter, in three large houses which they then set on\r\n      fire and burnt them all, although they had never done the slightest\r\n      thing against any Spaniard, nor given the least cause.”\r\n20.20. “It once happened, that when a priest called Ocana, pulled a child\r\n      out of the fire in which it was burning, another Spaniard snatched\r\n      it out of his hands and threw it back in the middle of the flames,\r\n      where it became ashes together with the others; while the aforesaid\r\n      Spaniard, who had thus thrown the Indian into the fire was returning\r\n      to his dwelling the same day, he suddenly fell dead in the road; and\r\n      it was my opinion, that they should not give him [Christian]\r\n      burial.”\r\n21.21. “Moreover I affirm, that I myself saw the Spaniards cut off the\r\n      hands, noses, and ears of the Indian men and women, for no purpose\r\n      whatever but just because the fancy struck them; and in so many\r\n      places and regions did this occur that it would be a long story to\r\n      tell.”\r\n22.22. “I also saw the Spaniards setting dogs onto the Indians, to tear\r\n      them to pieces; and thus I saw many of them torn to pieces.”\r\n23.23. “I likewise saw so many houses and towns burned that I could not\r\n      tell the number, so great was their multitude.”\r\n24.24. “It is likewise true that they took nursing children by the arms\r\n      and hurled them in the air as high as they could; and their other\r\n      injustice and aimless cruelties terrified me, besides innumerable\r\n      other things that I saw, and which it would take long to tell.”\r\n25.25. “I saw moreover that they called the Indian lords and chiefs, to\r\n      come peaceably, promising them safety, but as soon as they arrived\r\n      they burnt them. And in my presence they burnt two, one from Andon\r\n      and the other in Tumbala, nor was I able for all I preached to them,\r\n      to prevent them burning them.”\r\n26.26. “I call God and my own conscience to witness that, as far as I can\r\n      understand, the Indians only revolted on account of this ill\r\n      treatment which sufficiently justified their action as may be\r\n      clearly seen by everybody.”\r\n27.27. “The Spaniards have never dealt honestly with them nor kept their\r\n      word but, contrary to all reason and justice, they have tyrannically\r\n      ruined them and all their country, doing such things against them,\r\n      that they [the Indians] have resolved sooner to die, than suffer\r\n      such deeds.”\r\n28.28. “I say moreover, that the Indians are right in affirming that there\r\n      is more gold hidden, than has been discovered, for they have refused\r\n      to disclose it because of the injustice and cruelty shown them by\r\n      the Spaniards; nor will they disclose it as long as such treatment\r\n      continues, but rather will they die like the others.”\r\n29.29. “God our Lord has been much offended by these deeds, and His\r\n      Majesty very badly served and defrauded, for they have made him lose\r\n      countries that could very well provide food for the whole of\r\n      Castile, and in my opinion, it will be very difficult and expensive\r\n      to recover them.”\r\n30.30. All these are the formal words of the said monk; and bear the\r\n      signature also of the Bishop of Mexico, testifying that everything\r\n      was affirmed by the said Father, Fray Marcus.\r\n31.31. What this Father says he has seen, should be considered here:\r\n      because this happened throughout fifty or a hundred leagues of\r\n      country and during nine or ten years, at the beginning, when there\r\n      were very few Spaniards: afterwards the sound of gold drew thither\r\n      four or five thousand Spaniards, who spread through many large\r\n      kingdoms and provinces, covering more than five hundred or seven\r\n      hundred leagues, all of which they have destroyed by practising the\r\n      same deeds and others still more ferocious and cruel.\r\n32.32. Truly, from that time to the present day, a thousand times more\r\n      people have been destroyed and dispersed than he was told of; being\r\n      devoid of mercy and the fear of God and the King, the Spaniards have\r\n      destroyed a very large part of the human race.\r\n33.33. Within the space of ten years they have killed, up to the present\r\n      day, more than four millions of persons; and they are still killing.\r\n34.34. A short time since they pursued and killed a great queen, wife of\r\n      Elingue, he who was left king of those kingdoms which the Christians\r\n      had tyrannically seized and provoked to rise in the present\r\n      rebellion.  They captured the queen, his wife who, it is said, was\r\n      pregnant and, contrary to all justice, they killed her, only to\r\n      grieve her husband.\r\n35.35. If the cruelties and different murders committed by the Christians,\r\n      and their daily deeds in those kingdoms of Peru were to be told,\r\n      they would doubtless be so horrible and so numerous that what we\r\n      have recounted of the other countries would fade, and seem little,\r\n      compared with their number and their gravity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Of the New Kingdom of Granada\r\n\r\n\r\n   1. In the year 1539 many tyrants joined together and started from\r\n      Venezuela, Santa Marta, and Cartagena for Peru: and others came back\r\n      from the same Peru to explore those countries.  Three hundred\r\n      leagues inland behind Santa Marta and Cartagena, they found some\r\n      very delightful and marvellous provinces, full of numberless people,\r\n      as mild and kind as the others, and very rich in gold, and in those\r\n      precious stones called emeralds.\r\n 2.2. To these provinces they gave the name of the new kingdom of Granada;\r\n      because those tyrants who first came to these countries were natives\r\n      of the kingdom of Granada in Spain.\r\n 3.3. As many iniquitous and cruel men among those who gathered from all\r\n      parts, were notorious butchers and shedders of human blood who were\r\n      very inured to, and experienced in the great sins that we have said\r\n      were committed in many parts of the Indies, it follows that their\r\n      fiendish operations, and the circumstances and qualities that\r\n      blackened and aggravated them, were such that they have surpassed\r\n      very many, or indeed all, that the others and they themselves have\r\n      committed elsewhere in the Indies.\r\n 4.4. Of the multitude they have committed in these three years, and\r\n      continue without ceasing to commit, I will briefly relate a few.  As\r\n      a man who was robbing and murdering in the said kingdom would not\r\n      allow a governor to also rob and kill, the latter brought a suit\r\n      against him, calling many witnesses to prove the slaughter,\r\n      injustice, and massacres he had done, and is doing; this evidence\r\n      was read, and is to be found in the Council of the Indies.\r\n 5.5. The witnesses in the said law-suit affirm that all the kingdom was\r\n      quiet, and subject to the Spaniards; the Indians continually\r\n      laboured to furnish them provisions, and to accumulate property for\r\n      them; they brought them all the gold and precious emeralds they\r\n      possessed or could obtain: the lords and inhabitants of the towns\r\n      had been divided among the Spaniards, who lay claim to them as the\r\n      means for obtaining their final object, which is gold.  Having thus\r\n      reduced everybody to the usual tyranny and slavery, the principal\r\n      tyrant captain commanding them, captured the sovereign of all that\r\n      country, without any cause or reason, and kept him for six or seven\r\n      months, demanding gold and emeralds of him.\r\n 6.6. The said king, who was called Bogota, being overcome by fear said\r\n      that he would give a house of the gold they demanded, hoping to free\r\n      himself from the hands of his tormenters: he sent some Indians to\r\n      bring him the treasure, and several times they brought a large\r\n      quantity of gold and stones: because he did not give the house of\r\n      gold, the Spaniards declared that he should be killed, because he\r\n      did not fulfil his promise.\r\n 7.7. The tyrant said that he should be tried by process of law, so they\r\n      prosecuted him, accusing the said king of the country.  The tyrant\r\n      gave sentence, condemning him to tortures, if he did not give the\r\n      house of gold.\r\n 8.8. They tortured him with the cord: they threw burning fat on his\r\n      belly; they put his feet in irons fastened to a stake, tied his neck\r\n      to another, while two men held his hands; and in this position they\r\n      put fire to his feet.\r\n 9.9. Every now and then, the tyrant entered and told him, that they would\r\n      kill him by inches with tortures if he did not give the gold.  And\r\n      thus they did, and killed this lord with tortures.  While they were\r\n      tormenting him, God gave a sign of destestation of that cruelty, by\r\n      causing all that town, where it was committed to be burnt.\r\n10.10. The other Spaniards imitated their good captain and, since they\r\n      only know how to rend these people, they did the same; torturing the\r\n      lord of the town or towns, that had been confided to them, with\r\n      divers and fierce tortures while those lords and their people felt\r\n      themselves safe, and were giving them all the gold and emeralds they\r\n      could: the Spaniards tortured them only to extort more gold and\r\n      jewels.  And in this way they burnt and cut to pieces all the lords\r\n      of that country.\r\n11.11. Terror-stricken by the excessive cruelty practised upon the Indians\r\n      by one of those particular tyrants a great lord called Daytama fled,\r\n      with many of his people from such inhumanity, and retreated to the\r\n      mountains.  This, if it did but avail, they conceive to be the\r\n      remedy and refuge, and this is what the Spaniards call revolt and\r\n      rebellion.\r\n12.12. The principal tyrant captain hearing this, sent a force to that\r\n      cruel man, whose ferocity and wickedness towards the peaceful and\r\n      submissive Indians had driven them to the mountains; the latter went\r\n      in pursuit of the natives, and because it sufficed not to hide in\r\n      the bowels of the earth, they found a large number of people whom\r\n      they killed, cutting to pieces more than five hundred men, women,\r\n      and children, and sparing no one.\r\n13.13. The witnesses also say that before his death, the same Prince\r\n      Daytama had been to see that cruel man and had taken him four or\r\n      five thousand crowns, but notwithstanding this, he committed the\r\n      said slaughter.\r\n14.14. Another time a great number of people having come to serve the\r\n      Spaniards, and feeling themselves safe, serving with their humility\r\n      and simplicity, the captain entered the town one night where the\r\n      Indians were and commanded that all those Indians should be put to\r\n      the sword while some of them were sleeping, and some supping and\r\n      resting from the labours of the day.\r\n15.15. He perpetrated this massacre because it seemed good to him to make\r\n      himself feared by all the people of the country.\r\n16.16. Another time the captain put all the Spaniards on oath, to lead at\r\n      once as many lords and chiefs and common people as each had in his\r\n      household service, to the square, where he had all their heads cut\r\n      off, thus killing four or five hundred people.  And the witnesses\r\n      say that he thought in this way to pacify the country.\r\n17.17. The witnesses depose that one particular tyrant did great cruelty,\r\n      killing, and cutting off the hands and noses of many men and women,\r\n      and destroying many people.\r\n18.18. Another time the captain sent the afore-named cruel man, with\r\n      certain Spaniards to the province of Bogota, to make inquiry as to\r\n      who had succeeded to that dominion since they had tortured the\r\n      universal lord to death: he marched through many leagues of country,\r\n      capturing as many Indians as he could.\r\n19.19. And because the people did not show him the lord who had succeeded,\r\n      he cut off the hands of some and gave others to ferocious dogs,\r\n      which tore them to pieces both men, and women; and in this way he\r\n      killed, and destroyed many Indian men and women.\r\n20.20. One day, near sunrise, he went to attack some lords, or captains\r\n      and many Indians who felt tranquil and secure, because he had\r\n      assured them and given them his word that they should receive no\r\n      hurt or harm; confiding in this assurance they had come down from\r\n      the mountains, where they were hidden, to dwell in this town on the\r\n      plain; thus he captured a great many of these unsuspecting and\r\n      confiding people, women and men, and making them put their hands\r\n      flat on the ground he himself cut them off with a scimitar, saying\r\n      that he punished them because they would not tell where the new\r\n      lord, who had succeeded to that kingdom, was hidden.\r\n21.21. Another time, because the Indians did not give a coffer full of\r\n      gold that this cruel captain demanded, he sent people to make war on\r\n      them, in which they killed numberless persons, and cut off the hands\r\n      and noses of so many women and men that they could not be counted:\r\n      they gave others to fierce dogs that tore them to pieces and ate\r\n      them.\r\n22.22. Another time, the Indians of a province of that kingdom, seeing\r\n      that the Spaniards had burnt three or four principal lords,\r\n      retreated in fear to a strong rock to defend themselves from enemies\r\n      so devoid of humanity; and according to the witnesses, there may\r\n      have been four or five thousand Indians on the rock.\r\n23.23. The above-named captain sent a great and notorious tryant, who\r\n      surpassed many of those who have charge of destroying those\r\n      countries, with a certain number of Spaniards, to punish those\r\n      Indians who had fled from such a great pestilence and butchery: and\r\n      he declared they were in revolt, seeking to make it appear that they\r\n      had done something wrong, for which the Spaniards must punish them\r\n      and take vengeance: they themselves, however, merit any most cruel\r\n      torture whatsoever, without mercy, because they are so deprived of\r\n      mercy and compassion towards those innocent creatures.\r\n24.24. The Spaniards went to the rock and forced their way up, the Indians\r\n      being naked and without arms; then the Spaniards called the Indians\r\n      with professions of peace, assuring them that no harm should be done\r\n      them, if they did not fight; the Indians at once ceased, whereupon\r\n      that most cruel man commanded the Spaniards, to seize all the strong\r\n      positions of the rock, and when taken, to surround the Indians.\r\n      These tigers and lions surrounded the tame lambs, and disembowelled\r\n      and put to the sword so many, that they stopped to rest, so many had\r\n      they cut to pieces.\r\n25.25. When they had rested a little, the captain ordered that they should\r\n      kill and throw down from the rock, which was very high, all the\r\n      survivors; and so they did.  And the witnesses say, that they beheld\r\n      such a mass of Indians thrown from the rock, that there might have\r\n      been seven hundred men together, who were crushed to pieces where\r\n      they fell.\r\n26.26. To complete their great cruelty, they sought out all the Indians\r\n      who had hidden in the thicket, and he commanded all to be put to the\r\n      sword; and thus they killed them, and threw them down from the rock.\r\n27.27. Nor would he rest satisfied with the cruel things that have been\r\n      related, but wished to distinguish himself still more and increase\r\n      the horribleness of his sins, by commanding that all the Indians,\r\n      men and women, save those he kept for his own service, who had been\r\n      captured alive (because in these massacres each usually chooses a\r\n      few men, women and children for his own use) should be put in a\r\n      straw house to which he set fire: some forty or fifty were thus\r\n      burnt alive, while others were thrown to fierce dogs that tore them\r\n      to pieces and ate them.\r\n28.28. Another time, this same tyrant captured many Indians in a certain\r\n      town called Cota which he visited; he had fifteen or twenty lords\r\n      and principal persons torn by dogs; and he cut off the hands of many\r\n      men and women, tied them to cords and hung about seventy pairs of\r\n      hands along a beam, so that the other Indians should see what had\r\n      been done to these people; and he cut off the noses of many women\r\n      and children.\r\n29.29. Nobody could explain the actions, and cruelty of this man, God’s\r\n      enemy, because they are innumerable, nor have such deeds as he did\r\n      in those countries and in the province of Guatemala, ever been\r\n      witnessed or heard of since then: during many years he went about\r\n      those countries doing these deeds, burning and destroying the\r\n      inhabitants and their property.\r\n30.30. The witnesses in the trial further say, that the cruelties and\r\n      massacres perpetrated in the said new kingdom of Granada by the\r\n      captain himself and, with his consent, by all those tyrants and\r\n      destroyers of the human race who were with him, were such that they\r\n      have wasted and exterminated all the country.  And that unless His\r\n      Majesty arrests the massacring done among the Indians to extort gold\r\n      which, as they had already given all they had, they no longer\r\n      possess, the destruction will shortly be complete, and no Indians of\r\n      any sort will be left to sustain the country, which will be left\r\n      depopulated and desolate.\r\n31.31. It should be considered how great and furious has been the cruelty\r\n      and pestilential tyranny of unhappy tyrants, in the space of two or\r\n      three years, since the discovery of this kingdom which, as all who\r\n      have been there, and the witnesses at the trial say, was as thickly\r\n      populated as any in the world; they have desolated it with\r\n      massacres, so devoid of mercy, of the fear of God and the King, that\r\n      they say, not a single person will be left alive unless His Majesty\r\n      shortly prevents these infernal operations.   And so I believe it to\r\n      be, for with my own eyes I have seen many, and large countries in\r\n      those parts, which they have destroyed and completely depopulated\r\n      within a brief period.\r\n32.32. There are other large provinces, bordering the said new kingdom of\r\n      Granada, called Popayan and Cali: also three, or four others that\r\n      extend for more than five hundred leagues; the Spaniards have\r\n      rendered them desolate, and destroyed them like the others, unjustly\r\n      robbing and torturing to death the numberless inhabitants of that\r\n      most delightful country.\r\n33.33. People coming now from there declare that it excites compassion to\r\n      see so many large towns burnt and destroyed; towns where formerly\r\n      there were a thousand or two thousand families, are reduced to\r\n      hardly fifty, while others are entirely burned and abandoned.\r\n34.34. In other places, from one to three hundred leagues of country are\r\n      found completely deserted; large towns having been burnt and\r\n      destroyed.\r\n35.35. Great and cruel tyrants penetrated into New Granada from the\r\n      direction of the province of Quito in the kingdom of Peru, and into\r\n      Popayan and Cali from the direction of Cartagena and Uraba, while\r\n      from Cartagena, other ill-starred tyrants marched through to Quito;\r\n      afterwards others, came from the direction of Rio de San Juan, which\r\n      is on the South coast.  All of these men united together and they\r\n      have devastated and depopulated more than six hundred leagues of\r\n      country, sending innumerable souls to hell. They are doing the same\r\n      at the present day to the miserable survivors, although they are\r\n      innocent.\r\n36.36. And to prove the axiom I laid down in the beginning, namely that\r\n      the tyranny, violence, and injustice of the Spaniards towards these\r\n      gentle lambs, accompanied by cruelty, inhumanity, and wickedness,\r\n      most worthy of all fire and torture, which continue in the said\r\n      provinces, go on increasing, I cite the following.\r\n37.37. After the massacres and slaughter of the war, the people are\r\n      condemned, as was said, to the horrible slavery described above.  To\r\n      one of the devils, two hundred Indians were given, to another,\r\n      three.  The devil commandant ordered a hundred Indians to be called\r\n      before him and when they promptly came like so many lambs, he had\r\n      the heads of thirty or forty cut off; and said to the others: “I\r\n      will do the same to you, if you do not serve me well, and if you\r\n      leave without my permission.”\r\n38.38. Now in God’s name consider, you, who read this, what sort of deeds\r\n      are these, and whether they do not surpass every imaginable cruelty\r\n      and injustice, and whether it squares well with such Christians as\r\n      these to call them devils; and whether it could be worse to give the\r\n      Indians into the charge of the devils of hell than to the Christians\r\n      of the Indies.\r\n39.39. I will also tell of another such operation; I do not know which is\r\n      the more cruel, the more infernal, and nearer the ferocity of wild\r\n      beasts, this one or that one just told.\r\n40.40. It has already been said, that the Spaniards of the Indies have\r\n      tamed and trained the strongest and most ferocious dogs to kill and\r\n      tear the Indians to pieces.\r\n41.41. Listen and see, all you who are true Christians and also you who\r\n      are not, whether such deeds have ever been heard of in the world; to\r\n      feed the said dogs they take many Indians in chains with them on\r\n      their journeys, as though they were herds of swine; and they kill\r\n      them, making public butchery of human flesh; and one says to the\r\n      other; “lend me a quarter of one of these villeins to give to my\r\n      dogs to eat, until I kill.”  It is as though they were lending a\r\n      quarter of pork or of mutton.\r\n42.42. There are others, who go hunting with their dogs in the morning and\r\n      when one is asked on his return for dinner how it has fared with\r\n      him, he replies; “it has fared well with me, because I have left\r\n      perhaps fifteen or twenty villeins killed by my dogs.”\r\n43.43. All these and other diabolical things are being proved now in\r\n      law-suits started by some tyrants against others. What can be\r\n      filthier, fiercer, and more inhuman?\r\n44.44. I will finish with this, till news comes of other deeds of more\r\n      eminent wickedness, if any such there can be: or until, on our\r\n      return there, we again behold them, as we continually have with our\r\n      own eyes since forty-two years.\r\n45.45. I protest before God on my conscience that, as I believe and hold\r\n      certain, such are the perdition, harm, destruction, depopulation,\r\n      slaughter, deaths, and great and horrible cruelties, and most foul\r\n      ways of violence, injustice, robbery, and massacre, done among those\r\n      people and in all those countries of the Indies, that with all I\r\n      have described, and those upon which I have enlarged, I have not\r\n      told nor enlarged upon, in quality and quantity, a ten thousandth\r\n      part of what has been done and is being done to-day.\r\n46.46. And that all Christians may have greater compassion on those\r\n      innocent nations, and that they may more sincerely lament their loss\r\n      and doom, and blame and abominate the detestible avarice, ambition,\r\n      and cruelty of the Spaniards, let them all hold this truth for\r\n      certain, in addition to what I have affirmed above; namely, that\r\n      from the time the Indies were discovered down to the present,\r\n      nowhere did the Indians harm any Christians, before they had\r\n      sustained harm, robbery, and treachery from them.  Nay, they always\r\n      esteemed them immortal, and come from Heaven; and as such they\r\n      received them, until their deeds manifested their character and\r\n      intentions.\r\n47.47. It is well to add something else, that from the beginning till the\r\n      present day the Spaniards have given no more thought to providing\r\n      for the preaching of the faith of Jesus Christ to these people than\r\n      if they were dogs or other animals: nay, they have persistently\r\n      afflicted and persecuted the monks, to prevent them from preaching,\r\n      because it seemed to them an impediment to the acquisition of the\r\n      gold and wealth they promised themselves in their greedy desires.\r\n48.48. And to-day there is not in all the Indies more knowledge of God\r\n      among these people, as to whether He is of wood, or in heaven or on\r\n      earth, than there was a hundred years ago, except in new Spain,\r\n      where monks have gone and which is but a very little corner of the\r\n      Indies.  And so all have perished and are perishing, without faith\r\n      and without Sacraments.\r\n\r\n   1. I was induced to write this work I, Fray Bartolomeus de las Casas,\r\n      or Casaus, friar of St. Dominic, who by God’s mercy do go about this\r\n      Court of Spain, trying to drive the hell out of the Indies, and to\r\n      bring about that all those numberless multitudes of souls, redeemed\r\n      with the blood of Jesus Christ, shall not hopelessly perish forever;\r\n      moved also by the compassion I feel for my fatherland, Castile, that\r\n      God may not destroy it for such great sins, committed against His\r\n      faith and honour and against fellow creatures. A few persons of\r\n      quality who reside at this Court and are jealous of God’s honour and\r\n      compassionate towards the afflictions and calamities of others,\r\n      urged me to this work although it was my own intention which my\r\n      continual occupations had never allowed me to put into effect.\r\n 2.2. I brought it to a close at Valencia the 8th of December 1542, when\r\n      all the violence was more terrible, and the oppression, tyranny,\r\n      massacres, robberies, destructions, slaughter, depopulation,\r\n      anguish, and calamity aforesaid, are actually at their height in all\r\n      the regions where the Christians of the Indies are; although in some\r\n      places they are fiercer, and more abominable than in others.\r\n 3.3. Mexico and its neighbourhood are a little less badly off; there, at\r\n      least, such things dare not be done publicly, because there is\r\n      somewhat more justice than elsewhere, although very little, for they\r\n      still kill the people with infernal burdens.\r\n 4.4. I have great hope, for the Emperor and King of Spain our Lord Don\r\n      Carlos, Fifth of this name is getting to understand the wickedness\r\n      and treachery that, contrary to the will of God, and of himself, is\r\n      and has been done to those people and in those countries; heretofore\r\n      the truth has been studiously hidden from him, that it is his duty\r\n      to extirpate so many evils and bring succour to that new world,\r\n      given him by God, as to one who is a lover and observer of justice,\r\n      whose glorious, and happy life and Imperial state may God Almighty\r\n      long prosper, to the relief of all his universal Church, and for the\r\n      final salvation of his own Royal soul.  Amen.\r\n\r\n   1. Since the above was written, some laws and edicts have been\r\n      published by His Majesty, who was then in the town of Barcelona, in\r\n      the month of November 1542 and in the town of Madrid the following\r\n      year; these contain such provisions as now seem suitable to bring\r\n      about the cessation of the great wickedness and sin committed\r\n      against God and our fellow creatures, to the total ruin and\r\n      destruction of that world.\r\n 2.2. After many conferences and debates amongst conscientious and learned\r\n      authorities, who were assembled in the town of Valladolid, His\r\n      Majesty made the said laws; acting finally on the decision and\r\n      opinion of the greater part of all those who gave their votes in\r\n      writing, and who drew nearer to the law of Jesus Christ, as true\r\n      Christians.  They were likewise free from the corruption and\r\n      foulness of the treasures stolen from the Indies that soiled the\r\n      hands, and still more the souls of many in authority who, in their\r\n      blindness, had committed unscrupulous destruction.\r\n 3.3. When these laws were published, the agents of the tyrants, then at\r\n      Court, made many copies of them; they displeased all these men who\r\n      considered that they shut the doors to their participation in what\r\n      was robbed and taken by tyranny: and they sent the copies to divers\r\n      parts of the Indies.\r\n 4.4. None of those who there had charge of robbing the Indians, and of\r\n      finishing their destruction by their tyranny, had ever observed any\r\n      order, but such disorder as might have been made by Lucifer; when\r\n      they saw the copies, before the arrival of the new judges who were\r\n      to execute them, it is said and believed that they had been warned\r\n      of what was coming by those in Spain, who have till now encouraged\r\n      their sins and violence.  They were so agitated, that when the good\r\n      judges who were to carry out the laws arrived, they resolved to set\r\n      aside shame and obedience to the King, just as they had already lost\r\n      all love and fear of God.\r\n 5.5. They thus determined to let themselves be called traitors, for they\r\n      are cruel and unbridled tyrants, particularly in the kingdoms of\r\n      Peru, where at present, in this year of 1546, such horrible,\r\n      frightful, and execrable deeds are committed, as have never been\r\n      done, either in the Indies or in the world; not only do such things\r\n      happen among the Indians whom they have already all or nearly all\r\n      killed, but among themselves.  In the absence of the King’s justice\r\n      to punish them, God’s justice has come from heaven to bring\r\n      dissension amongst them and to make one to be the executioner of the\r\n      other.\r\n 6.6. Shielded by the rebellion of these tyrants, those in all the other\r\n      regions, would not obey the laws and, under pretext of appealing\r\n      against them, have also revolted; they resent having to abdicate the\r\n      dignities and power they have usurped, and to losing the Indians\r\n      whom they hold in perpetual slavery.\r\n 7.7. Where they have ceased to kill quickly by the sword, they kill\r\n      slowly by personal servitude and other unjust and intolerable\r\n      vexations. And till now the King has not succeeded in preventing\r\n      them because all, small and great, go there to pilfer, some more,\r\n      some less, some publicly and openly, others secretly and under\r\n      disguise; and with the pretext that they are serving the king, they\r\n      dishonour God, and rob and destroy the King.\r\n\r\nThe present work was printed in the most noble, and faithful town of\r\nSeville, at the house of Sebastian Truxillo book-printer. To our Lady of\r\nGrace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             The Year M.D.LII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat follows is part of a letter and report, written by one of those very\r\nmen who went to these regions, recounting the deeds the captain did, and\r\nallowed to be done, in the countries he visited.  When the said letter and\r\nreport was given with other things to be bound, the bookseller either\r\nforgot or lost one or more pages containing frightful things, that had all\r\nbeen given me by one of those who did them, all of which I had in my\r\npossession; what follows is therefore without beginning or end.  But as\r\nthis piece that is left, is full of notorious things, it seemed well to me\r\nnot to leave it unprinted: because I believe it will not excite less\r\ncompassion and horror in Your Highness, than some of the irregularities\r\nalready related, as well also as the desire to correct them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  LETTER\r\n\r\n\r\n   1. He allowed the Indians to be chained and put in prisons, and so it\r\n      was done.  And the said captain took three or four in chains for\r\n      himself; by so doing and by robbing the Indians of their supplies\r\n      instead of providing for necessary sowing and populating, the\r\n      natives of the country were reduced to such want, that great numbers\r\n      of them were found in the streets starved to death.\r\n 2.2. He killed about ten thousand souls by making the Indians carry the\r\n      Spaniards’ baggage to and from the beach, because all who reached\r\n      the coast died of the heat.\r\n 3.3. After this he followed the same trail and road as Juan de Ampudia,\r\n      sending the Indians he had brought from Quito, a day in front, to\r\n      discover the Indian towns and to sack them so that he and his people\r\n      might avail themselves of them on their arrival.  Those Indians\r\n      belonged to him and his companions, one of whom had two hundred,\r\n      another three hundred, according to the number each brought with\r\n      him, and they carried whatever their masters robbed. And in this\r\n      they treated children and women most cruelly.\r\n 4.4. He followed the same course in Quito, burning all the country and\r\n      the stores of maize belonging to the lords; he consented to the\r\n      killing of great numbers of sheep, all of which form the principal\r\n      provision and maintenance of the natives and of the Spaniards; for\r\n      the latter use two or three hundred just to eat the brains and fat\r\n      alone, and waste the meat.\r\n 5.5. His friendly Indians who went with him, killed great numbers of\r\n      sheep, just to eat the hearts, not eating anything else.  And so two\r\n      men in a province called Purua killed twenty-five sheep and\r\n      pack-sheep, just to eat the brains and fat, although among the\r\n      Spaniards they cost twenty and twenty-five pesos each.\r\n 6.6. By such excessive disorder, they killed more than a hundred thousand\r\n      head of animals, which reduced the country to very great want, while\r\n      the natives died of starvation in great numbers.  Although there was\r\n      more maize in Quito than can be told, this bad order of things\r\n      brought such penury on the people that a measure of maize came to\r\n      cost ten pesos, and a sheep the same.\r\n 7.7. When the said captain returned from the coast, he determined to\r\n      leave Quito, to go in search of Captain Juan de Ampudia.  He took\r\n      more than two hundred foot and horsemen, among whom he led many\r\n      inhabitants of the country of Quito.  The said captain permitted the\r\n      colonists who accompanied him to draw the lords from their\r\n      departments and as many Indians as they liked, and this they did.\r\n 8.8. Alonso Sanchez Nuyta took a lord and more than a hundred Indians\r\n      with their wives; Pedro Cobo and his cousin, more than a hundred and\r\n      fifty with their wives and many of the children, who otherwise all\r\n      died of starvation.  And so likewise Moran, an inhabitant of\r\n      Popayan, had more than two hundred persons; and all the other\r\n      inhabitants and soldiers also took as many as each could.\r\n 9.9. And the said soldiers asked him if he would give them licence to put\r\n      the Indians they brought with them, in prison; and he said yes,\r\n      until they died, and when these were dead, also others; for if the\r\n      Indians were vassals of His Majesty, they were also of the\r\n      Spaniards, and they died in war.\r\n10.10. In this way the said captain left Quito and went to a town called\r\n      Otabalo, which he owned at that time by virtue of the distribution,\r\n      and he demanded five hundred men for the war from its lord, who gave\r\n      them to him with some Indian chiefs.  He distributed some of these\r\n      people among the soldiers and the rest he took with himself, some\r\n      with packs, and others in chains, and some, who served him and\r\n      brought him food, were free; the soldiers also took them, bound in\r\n      this way with chains and cords.\r\n11.11. When they left the province of Quito they took away more than six\r\n      thousand Indians, men and women of whom not twenty men returned to\r\n      their country: because they all died of the great and excessive\r\n      labours imposed on them, in countries far from their native land.\r\n12.12. It happened at this time, that one Alonso Sanchez was sent by the\r\n      said captain in command of certain people in a province; on the way,\r\n      he met a number of women and boys loaded with provisions who,\r\n      instead of fleeing, waited for him, to give them to him; and he had\r\n      them all put to the sword.\r\n13.13. And a miracle happened when a soldier was stabbing an Indian woman;\r\n      at the first blow the sword broke in half, and at the second only\r\n      the handle was left, without his being able to wound her.  Another\r\n      soldier with a double bladed dagger wanted to stab another Indian\r\n      woman, but at the first blow four fingers’ length of the point broke\r\n      off, and at the second nothing remained but the handle alone.\r\n14.14. When the said captain left Quito, leading away such a quantity of\r\n      natives, separating them from their wives, giving some of the young\r\n      girls to those Indians he took with him, and others to those who\r\n      were left behind on account of their old age, a woman came behind\r\n      him, with a little child in her arms, weeping and begging him not to\r\n      take her husband away from her, because she had three little\r\n      children whom she would not be able to bring up, and who would die\r\n      of starvation; and seeing that he answered her roughly the first\r\n      time, she came back a second with louder cries saying, that her\r\n      children would die of starvation: and when she saw, that he\r\n      commanded she should be driven away and that he would not release\r\n      her husband, she threw the child on some stones and killed it.\r\n15.15. When the said captain arrived in the province of Lili at a town\r\n      called Palo near the great river, he found there the Captain Juan de\r\n      Ampudia, who had gone in advance to explore and pacify the country;\r\n      the said Ampudia had founded a town called Ampudia, in the name of\r\n      His Majesty and of the Marquis Francisco Pizarro, and had appointed\r\n      Pedro Solano de Quiñones and eight rulers as ordinary judges; and\r\n      the greater part of the country was at peace, and divided.  As soon\r\n      as he knew that the said captain was at the river, he went to see\r\n      him accompanied by many of the inhabitants and peaceful Indians,\r\n      loaded with provisions and fruit; and from thenceforward all the\r\n      Indians in the neighbourhood went to visit the said captain, and to\r\n      bring him food.\r\n16.16. These were the Indians from Namudi, Palo, Soliman, and Bolo; but\r\n      because they did not bring as much maize as he wanted, he ordered\r\n      many Spaniards to go with their Indians, men and women to get maize,\r\n      wherever they found it.  So they went to Bolo and to Palo, where\r\n      they found the Indians, tranquil in their houses; and the said\r\n      Spaniards and those who went with them, stole and carried off the\r\n      maize, gold, stuffs, and all the Indians possessed, and they bound\r\n      many of them.\r\n17.17. When the Indians saw that they were treated so badly, they went to\r\n      complain to the said captain of what had been done, and to request\r\n      that the Spaniards should restore all they had taken from them.  He\r\n      would not have anything restored, but told them that his men would\r\n      not go there a second time.\r\n18.18. Within three or four days the Spaniards returned for maize, and to\r\n      rob the Indians of the town.  The Indians having seen that the said\r\n      captain kept and observed his word so little, all the country\r\n      revolted, which did much harm and disservice to God Our Lord, and to\r\n      His Majesty.\r\n19.19. So the whole country is left deserted, because the people have been\r\n      destroyed by their enemies the Olomas and Manipos: these are a\r\n      warlike people from the mountains, who descended every day to the\r\n      plains to capture and despoil them, seeing that their towns and\r\n      native country were left abandoned; and the most powerful among them\r\n      ate the weaker, because they were all dying of starvation.\r\n20.20. Having done this, the said captain returned to the said country of\r\n      Ampudia, where he was received as General and seven days later he\r\n      again left to go to the places called Lili and Peti, accompanied by\r\n      more than two hundred men on foot and on horse.\r\n21.21. Afterwards the said commander sent his captain in all directions,\r\n      making cruel war on the natives; and so they killed great numbers of\r\n      Indians, men and women, and burnt their houses and stole their\r\n      goods: this lasted many days.\r\n22.22. The lords of the country seeing that they were killing and\r\n      destroying them, sent some peaceable Indians, with provisions.  And\r\n      the said captain having left for a settlement called Yce, he at once\r\n      sent some Spaniards to rob, capture, and kill as many Indians as\r\n      they could, commanding that many houses should be burnt; and so they\r\n      burnt more than a hundred.\r\n23.23. From there he went to another town, called Tolilicuy, (105) where\r\n      the lord at once came forth peaceably with many Indians: and the\r\n      said captain demanded gold of him and of his Indians.  The lord said\r\n      he had but little, but that he would give him what he had. They all\r\n      immediately began to bring him what they could.\r\n24.24. The said captain gave each of the Indians a ticket bearing the name\r\n      of the said Indian who had given him gold, threatening that any\r\n      Indian who did not pay and was without this ticket, should be thrown\r\n      to the dogs.  Terrified by this, all the Indians who had gold, gave\r\n      him all that they could; and those who had none fled to the mountain\r\n      and to other towns, for fear of being killed; for which reason a\r\n      great number of natives perished.\r\n25.25. The said captain forthwith ordered the lords to send two Indians to\r\n      another town, called Dagua, to order the inhabitants to come\r\n      peaceably to him, and bring him a quantity of gold.\r\n26.26. On arriving at another town, he sent a number of Spaniards, and\r\n      Indians from Tolilicuy to capture many Indians, and so the following\r\n      day they brought back more than a hundred persons with them. He took\r\n      all those capable of carrying loads, for himself and the soldiers,\r\n      and put them in chains so that they all died; and the said captain\r\n      gave the infants to the said lords of Tolilicuy to be eaten.  And\r\n      to-day in the house of the said Lord Tolilicuy there are the skins\r\n      of the infants full of ashes.\r\n27.27. Without saying anything, he departed from there for the provinces\r\n      of Calili, where he joined Captain Juan de Ampudia, who had been\r\n      sent by him to explore the country by another route; both the one\r\n      and the other did much slaughter and much injury to the native\r\n      people wherever they went.\r\n28.28. The said Juan de Ampudia arrived at a place, the lord of which was\r\n      called Bitacon; he had prepared some pits for his defence, into\r\n      which two horses belonging to Antonio Redondo and Marcus Marquez\r\n      fell; the latter died but the other not.  In consequence of this the\r\n      said Ampudia ordered as many as possible of the Indians, men and\r\n      women, to be captured; more than a hundred persons were captured\r\n      whom they threw into those pits alive where they killed them, and\r\n      they burnt more than a hundred houses in that town.\r\n29.29. Thus they joined one another at a large town and, without calling\r\n      the Indians pacifically, nor sending interpreters to summon them,\r\n      they made cruel war on them, and persecuted them, and killed great\r\n      numbers of them.  And as soon as they joined one another as has been\r\n      said, the aforenamed Ampudia told the captain what he had done at\r\n      Bitacon, and how he had thrown so many people into the pits; and the\r\n      said captain replied that he had done very well; and that he himself\r\n      had done the same at Riobamba, which is in the province of Quito,\r\n      where he threw more than two hundred persons into the pits; both\r\n      stayed here, making war throughout the country.\r\n30.30. After this he entered the province of Birù or Anzerma, making cruel\r\n      war of fire and blood, from this province to the salt ponds.  From\r\n      there he sent Francisco Garcia Tobar forward, making cruel war on\r\n      the natives as is told above; and the Indians went to him two by\r\n      two, making signs that they sought peace in the name of all the\r\n      country, and asking what the Spaniards wished; for if they wanted\r\n      gold or women or provisions, they should be given them, and begging\r\n      that they should not be killed in this way: and this the Spaniards\r\n      themselves have confessed to be true.\r\n31.31. And the said Francisco Garcia told them to go away, that they were\r\n      drunk, and that he did not understand them, after which he returned\r\n      to where the said captain was and they set out to march through all\r\n      the province, making most cruel war on the natives, plundering and\r\n      killing them; and more than two thousand souls were carried off from\r\n      there between him and his soldiers, all of whom died in chains.\r\n32.32. Before they left the inhabited country, they killed more than five\r\n      hundred persons.  Thus he returned to the province of Calili; and if\r\n      on the way some Indian, man or woman, became so tired that he could\r\n      not walk, they stabbed him; if he was in chains they cut off his\r\n      head, so as not to undo them and so that the others seeing this,\r\n      should not feign being ill.\r\n33.33. In this way they all died, and on this journey all the people he\r\n      had brought from Quito, Pasto, Quilla, Cagua, Paria, Popayan, Lili,\r\n      Cali, and Anzerma, perished in very great numbers.  On his return\r\n      march, as soon as he entered the large town, they killed all they\r\n      could.  And they captured three hundred persons in that day.\r\n34.34. From the province of Lili, he sent the said captain, Juan de\r\n      Ampudia, with many people to the place and dwellings of Lili, in\r\n      order to capture all the Indians, men and women, that he could, for\r\n      carrying the packs; because all the numerous people he had brought\r\n      from Anzerma, had already died.  And the said Juan de Ampudia\r\n      brought more than a thousand persons, many of whom he killed.\r\n35.35. The said captain took all the people he needed, giving the rest to\r\n      the soldiers, who at once put them in chains, where they all died:\r\n      after depriving the said country of the Spaniards, and of the\r\n      natives in such great numbers, as is seen by the few that are left,\r\n      he set out for Popayan.\r\n36.36. On the way he left behind a live Spaniard, whose name was Martin de\r\n      Aguirre, because he could not walk as much as the healthy ones.  On\r\n      his arrival at Popayan he dwelt in that town, and began to destroy,\r\n      and rob the Indians of the surrounding country, with the same\r\n      disorder as he had done in the others.\r\n37.37. He made a royal stamp here and melted all the gold he had gathered,\r\n      and that Juan de Ampudia had gathered before he came; and without\r\n      any accounting or explanation, and without giving any part to any\r\n      soldier, he took it all for himself, except that he gave what he\r\n      chose to some whose horses were dead.  This done, and after taking\r\n      the fifths of His Majesty he said he was going to Cuzco to report to\r\n      his Governor; so he set out for Quito, taking a great number of\r\n      Indians, men, and women, all of whom died on the journey and in that\r\n      place.  And further the said captain returned to destroy the royal\r\n      stamp he had made.\r\n38.38. It is well at this point to relate a word that this man said of\r\n      himself, showing that he very well knew the evil and cruelty that he\r\n      did.  He spoke thus: “In fifty years, those that pass by here and\r\n      hear of these things, will say: ‘It was here that the tyrant so and\r\n      so marched.’ ”\r\n39.39.

Nor is it\r\ncredible that any one should possess so little understanding as to desire\r\nthe faith and yet be destitute of the most necessary faculty to enable him\r\nto receive it.  Hence Christ, who is the Truth itself, that has never\r\nfailed and can never fail, said to the preachers of the faith whom He\r\nchose for that office “Go ye and teach all nations.”  He said all, without\r\nexception, for all are capable of receiving the doctrines of the faith.\r\n\r\nThe enemy of the human race, who opposes all good deeds in order to bring\r\nmen to destruction, beholding and envying this, invented a means never\r\nbefore heard of, by which he might hinder the preaching of God’s word of\r\nSalvation to the people: he inspired his satellites who, to please him,\r\nhave not hesitated to publish abroad that the Indians of the West and the\r\nSouth, and other people of whom We have recent knowledge should be treated\r\nas dumb brutes created for our service, pretending that they are incapable\r\nof receiving the catholic faith.\r\n\r\nWe, who, though unworthy, exercise on earth the power of our Lord and seek\r\nwith all our might to bring those sheep of His flock who are outside, into\r\nthe fold committed to our charge, consider, however, that the Indians are\r\ntruly men and that they are not only capable of understanding the catholic\r\nfaith but, according to our information, they desire exceedingly to\r\nreceive it.  Desiring to provide ample remedy for these evils, we define\r\nand declare by these our letters, or by any translation thereof signed by\r\nany notary public and sealed with the seal of any ecclesiastical\r\ndignitary, to which the same credit shall be given as to the originals,\r\nthat, notwithstanding whatever may have been or may be said to the\r\ncontrary, the said Indians and all other people who may later be\r\ndiscovered by Christians, are by no means to be deprived of their liberty\r\nor the possession of their property, even though they be outside the faith\r\nof Jesus Christ; and that they may and should, freely and legitimately,\r\nenjoy their liberty and the possession of their property; nor should they\r\nbe in any way enslaved; should the contrary happen, it shall be null and\r\nof no effect.\r\n\r\nBy virtue of our apostolic authority We define and declare by these\r\npresent letters, or by any translation thereof signed by any notary public\r\nand sealed with the seal of any ecclesiastical dignitary, which shall thus\r\ncommand the same obedience as the originals, that the said Indians and\r\nother peoples should be converted to the faith of Jesus Christ by\r\npreaching the word of God and by the example of good and holy living.\r\n\r\nGiven in Rome in the year of our Lord 1537.

Our officials of India House, who reside in the city of\r\nSeville: Rev. Fray Bartholomew de Las Casas, bishop-elect of the province\r\nof Chiapa, goes to this city in order to send off forty priests, who are\r\nnow going to the province of Honduras; and also to give orders concerning\r\ntheir departure and other matters which he understands.  I therefore wish\r\nthe said bishop to be given every facility in these matters so that he may\r\nbe enabled to arrange quickly, as is due to one in our service, and I\r\ncommand and order you that in the aforesaid, as in all things, you will\r\noffer him help, and assist him and the said priests; and in thus doing,\r\nyou will be serving me.  From Valladolid 13th day of the month of February\r\n1544—I, the Prince, etc.\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCE.  Our officials of India House, who reside in the city of\r\nSeville; as the bulls of the bishop of the province of Chiapa, the\r\nReverend Father Fray Bartholomew de Las Casas have arrived and Diego\r\nNavarro, who brought them by our orders is entitled by the agreement made\r\nwith him to be paid for the cost and the delivery of the said bulls,\r\namounting, according to the declaration of Pedro de Tapia and of Diego de\r\nGaona, apostolic notaries, and of certain money changers in Rome, to\r\neighty-eight thousand nine hundred and twenty-five maravedis, and since\r\nthis has to be deducted from the five hundred thousand maravedis, which\r\nthe said bishop receives from us in New Spain, I order that out of\r\nwhatever maravedis are in your charge, our treasurer shall pay the said\r\nDiego Navarro or his authorised representative the said eighty-eight\r\nthousand nine hundred and twenty-five maravedis.  You will take care that\r\nthey are collected according to the cedula which I send by him.

By these presents I give permission and faculty to you, Rev.\r\nFray Bartholomew de Las Casas, bishop-elect of the province of Chiapa to\r\nleave our realms, and dominions and go to our Indies, Islands, and “Terra\r\nFirma” of the ocean sea, accompanied by four black slaves for your\r\npersonal service and establishment, free of all duty, as well from the two\r\nducats for their licences, as from the “almoxarifazgo” duties.(108)\r\nWhatever sum this amounts to, I exempt you; and we instruct our officials\r\nin those islands and provinces to which the said slaves are to be sent, to\r\ntake charge of this original document and place it in the chest of the\r\nThree Keys, so that the said slaves shall be unable to make more than the\r\none voyage for which we give you permission by this licence.  Dated in the\r\ntown of Valladolid 13th day of February 1544—I, the Prince, etc.\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCE.  Reverend Father in Christ, Fray Bartholomew de Las Casas,\r\nbishop-elect of the province of Chiapa I have been informed that the\r\nprovince of Socousco is within the boundaries of your diocese.  Knowing\r\nthis and with the confidence I place in you, my will is to place the said\r\nprovince under your charge so that, as prelate you will have the care of\r\nthe spiritual affairs in it, until, as aforesaid, a bishop is provided for\r\nit.  I therefore order and entrust you as prelate to take charge of the\r\nspiritual welfare of the said province until as said, a prelate is\r\nprovided for it.  Of the tithes of the said province you are to take one\r\nfourth part, and the other three parts shall be distributed among the\r\necclesiastical ministers who at present serve in that province; and in the\r\nrepairs and decorations of its churches.  The fourth part, of which you\r\nhave the use, shall be expended in your personal visits throughout the\r\nsaid provinces and in performing their pontifical functions until the\r\nprelate we shall appoint goes to reside in his bishopric.  Dated in\r\nValladolid 13th day of February 1544—I, the Prince, etc.\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCE.  Reverend Father in Christ, Fray Bartholomew de Las Casas,\r\nbishop-elect of the city of Ciudad Real of the plains of Chiapa.  You\r\nalready know that the Emperor King, my sovereign, having seen the\r\nnecessity of providing and ordering certain things tending to the better\r\ngovernment of the Indies, the better treatment of its natives, and the\r\nbetter administration of justice, and in order to fulfil the duties he\r\nowes to the service of God our Lord, and in the discharge of his royal\r\nconscience has, after much deliberation, ordered certain ordinances to be\r\ndrawn up.  As it afterwards appeared necessary and advantageous to explain\r\ncertain clauses in the said ordinances and to further strengthen others,\r\ncertain ordinances and declarations were made, many of whose articles have\r\nbeen rectified for the benefit, preservation, and good treatment of the\r\nnatives of the said Indies, their lives and properties.  They may all thus\r\nbe well treated as free subjects and vassals of His Majesty (which they\r\nare) and instructed in the Holy Catholic Faith, as you will see by the\r\ncopies of the said ordinances and declarations, which I order to be sent\r\nto you with this letter, signed by Juan de Samano, our secretary.  And\r\nwhatever I have commanded in our ordinances and in our cedulas and\r\nprovisions, which I now renew, I send and order our viceroys, presidents\r\nand the auditors of our audiencias and royal chancelleries of the said\r\nIndies, our governors and our judges that with great zeal and diligence\r\nthey obey, comply with, and have them proclaimed.  They shall rigorously\r\npunish all who rebel against these ordinances, and many of the said\r\nordinances shall be given to the priests who are in those parts that they\r\nmay be made known to the natives, and procure obedience to them, and\r\nreport those who do not fulfil them, to the said audiencia.  I also think\r\nit advisable to mention this to you, feeling confident that as you are the\r\npastor and protector of the native Indians in your bishopric, and are\r\nbound to be more zealous in procuring their better welfare and in\r\npreserving their spiritual and temporal development, you will, therefore,\r\ndo this and take greater care to ensure the execution of what has been\r\nenacted for their benefit.  Thus I charge you and I command you to see\r\nthat this is carried out, and to exercise great vigilance and care to\r\nensure the observance of the said statutes and the execution of their\r\nprovisions.  And should any person or persons violate these orders, you\r\nwill notify the governors and judges in those parts so that they may\r\npunish them according to the provisions of the statutes.  Should the\r\nlatter prove remiss, neglectful, or inclined to dissimulate, you will\r\nreport to the President and auditors of Our Audiencia and Royal\r\nChancellery of the Confines, indicating those who have offended and in\r\nwhat way, so that they may order the guilty to be punished in conformity\r\nwith the commands we have sent them.  In case the said President and\r\nauditors fail to correct and punish them, after seeing your statement—a\r\nthing we do not believe—you will notify us of everything in order that we\r\nmay have them punished as we may think fit.  In doing this you will have\r\nfulfilled the duties you owe to the service of God, our Lord, and in the\r\ndischarge of your conscience; moreover the Emperor my sovereign will also\r\nbe served.  Dated in Valladolid, 13th day of February 1544.

Father in Christ, Bartholomew de Las Casas,\r\nbishop-elect of the city of Ciudad Real of the plains of Chiapa, health\r\nand grace.  You well know that on account of the good reports that we had\r\nof your character, we presented you to our most Holy Father as bishop of\r\nthe said diocese, and though the bulls have not been despatched, the\r\nservice of God Our Lord, the instruction and conversion of the natives of\r\nthe said bishopric and the good government and advancement of the Church\r\nand its divine teachings, require that you go with all haste to the said\r\nprovinces to undertake the said teaching and conversion and the other\r\nmatters with which we have charged you.  Were you to await the arrival of\r\nthe said bulls, certain misfortunes might in the meantime occur there\r\nwhich would displease God our Lord, and not be in accordance with our\r\nduties to His service in the Indies.  It was therefore agreed that without\r\nawaiting the said bulls, you should go to the said province, and we\r\napprove it.  Therefore we pray and command you that as soon as you receive\r\nthis you will start for the said province of Chiapa, without awaiting the\r\nsaid bulls: you will enquire into and find out the state of the spiritual\r\naffairs of the province and also what churches and monasteries have been\r\nbuilt.  What tithes there have been and in what way they have been spent\r\nand distributed.  If the necessary churches have not been built you will\r\nsee that they are immediately erected in such places as you judge best,\r\nplacing priests to administer the Holy Sacraments and to diligently\r\ninstruct the natives of those towns in all matters relating to our holy\r\nCatholic Faith.  In the meantime, we, as patrons of the said churches and\r\nthe others in our Indies, command persons to be named to those benefices\r\nwho will assume charge of them. You will likewise see that the divine\r\nservices are carried out with the necessary reverence, decency, and\r\ndecorum, and that the natives of the said district are instructed in the\r\nHoly Catholic faith; you will see that the said priests and others who\r\nreside in the said provinces live honestly, and that those who are charged\r\nwith the education of the Indians in the teachings of our Holy Catholic\r\nFaith fulfil their duties.  We command that the President and the auditors\r\nof our Audiencia and Royal Chancellery of the Confines, as well as all\r\nother judges and subjects of the said province of Chiapa, shall give you\r\nall the above mentioned, and shall favour and aid you in whatever you ask\r\nof them or is necessary.  For all of which we name you and give you full\r\npower by this, our letter with all its incidents, dependencies, annexes,\r\nand connexes.  You are notified by this letter that you are not authorised\r\nto exercise jurisdiction or other functions forbidden to bishops-elect\r\nbefore they are confirmed and consecrated.

Father in Christ, Bartholomew de Las\r\nCasas bishop-elect of the province of Chiapa, health and grace.   Be it\r\nknown to you that we have been informed that in your diocese, many Indians\r\nhave been hunted and driven to the hills and mountains by the cruel\r\ntreatment of Spaniards living there, and of others who have gone there of\r\ntheir own free will.  And because we are desirous that the said Indians\r\nshould be pacified and taught our Holy Catholic Faith, and should be\r\nbrought back to the towns they used to inhabit to again live there and be\r\ntaught the Christian doctrines, we have decided, on account of the great\r\nconfidence we have in you, to beg you to endeavour to bring the said\r\nIndians to peaceful terms.  We therefore charge and command you that upon\r\nyour arrival there you will endeavour to procure peace, and to instruct\r\nall the Indians who have been driven out of the said bishopric, in the\r\nknowledge of the Holy Catholic Faith.  And you will persuade them to\r\nreturn to the towns they used to inhabit or to the places indicated by\r\nyou, which you think more suitable.  And that they may come the more\r\nwillingly, you will promise and assure them in our name that if they come\r\nand populate the said towns, they shall not be molested either now or at\r\nany time during our royal reign; neither they, nor their descendants, nor\r\nthe towns they inhabit.  By these presents we promise that should they\r\ncome to peaceful terms as stated, we will not molest them neither during\r\nthis reign nor at any other time.  We moreover command that for a period\r\nof four years they shall neither be fined nor taxed by our officials nor\r\nby any other persons; and that they may be more relieved from work, our\r\nwill is that they shall be free of all tribute.  You will have special\r\noversight of their good treatment and of their instruction and conversion,\r\nand you will advise us what number of Indians have become peaceful through\r\nthese means and also what districts they have peopled.

Reverend Father in Christ, Francis Marroquin, bishop of the\r\nprovince of Guatemala: I am informed by Our Council that you have\r\ninterfered and are interfering in the spiritual affairs pertaining to the\r\nDiocese of Chiapa and know its affairs as though you were its bishop,\r\nbeing as it is the lawful church and having its chapter, and the see being\r\nat present vacant.  The Emperor King, my sovereign, has presented to the\r\nsaid bishopric the Reverend Fray Bartholomew de Las Casas, and we have\r\ndespatched him thither without waiting for his bulls.  You are aware that\r\nin a lawfully erected diocese it belongs to the chapter during the vacancy\r\nof the see, to take cognisance of what happens there.  Therefore I command\r\nyou that from the day that you receive this, you will henceforth, neither\r\nknow nor try to find out and interfere as a bishop in anything pertaining\r\nto the said bishopric of Chiapa, and that you will leave the chapter of\r\nthe vacant see to act as is customary during a vacancy.

You well know how we have sent you, without\r\nawaiting your bulls, to the said province to undertake the spiritual\r\naffairs there and, because our wishes are that pending the arrival of the\r\nsaid bulls, you shall be entitled to collect the ecclesiastical tithes of\r\nthat bishopric and to distribute them according to and in the manner\r\nauthorised by the foundation law of the diocese, we command you, pending\r\nthe arrival of the bulls authorising you to take possession of the said\r\nbishopric, to collect all the ecclesiastical tithes of that bishopric.

Venerable and devout Father, Fray Bartholomew de Las Casas,\r\nbishop-elect confirmed to the province of Chiapa; I saw your letter of the\r\n21st ult. and the one you wrote to Juan de Samano, his Majesty’s\r\nsecretary, and the cedula you ask for, authorizing the expenses of the\r\nforty friars who are going to Honduras, goes with this.  About the two\r\nhundred and fifty ducats which I ordered to be given you by the officials\r\nof this chamber, seeing that there is no money wherewith to pay them, I\r\nhave ordered them to be paid on account, and that they should pay them to\r\nyou, as you will have understood when you receive this, and thus they will\r\nsettle with you in full.\r\n\r\nI have written to the Franciscan Provincial of the Province of Castile,\r\nthat ten priests are going to the Indies instead of the twelve that I\r\nasked for, as you told me that two of them are already in that city, of\r\nwhich I am glad.  The others who come will be provided with their passage\r\nand stores according to the cedula you possess.\r\n\r\nPertaining to your consecration, in another document which accompanies\r\nthis, I am sending to give notice of the arrival of your bulls, charging\r\nyou to arrange at once for your consecration.  I therefore beg you to do\r\nthis and to let me know how it was celebrated.  Valladolid 1st day of\r\nApril 1544.

You\r\nwell know or should know that we have presented to our very Holy Father,\r\nthe Reverend Father in Christ, Fray Bartholomew de las Casas of the\r\nDominican Order, for the bishopric of the said city of Ciudad Real in the\r\nprovince of Chiapa, to whom His Holiness, in virtue of our presentation,\r\nconveyed the said church and bishopric; and he ordered to be given and did\r\ngive his bull for it, presenting it to us and begging us to grant our\r\nexecution of the letter so that, in conformity with the said bulls, he\r\nwould be given possession of the said bishopric and might receive its\r\nrents and income, to enable him to appoint his vicars and other officials\r\nof the said bishopric and that we might dispose as we saw fit.  He sent\r\nthe said bulls to be shown to our Council of the Indies and after they had\r\nseen them, we agreed that in the meantime or until we or our sovereign\r\nsuccessors enlarge or diminish the boundaries of the said bishopric, the\r\nsaid Fray Bartholomew de Las Casas should preserve the boundaries assigned\r\nby the said President and auditors to the said bishopric of Chiapa; and\r\nthat the tithes and other things which belong to him as bishop should be\r\npaid him; and that we should send this, our letter to you; and we\r\napproved.

Meanwhile, and until we or the kings our successors enlarge\r\nor diminish the said boundaries as before stated, you shall hold him as\r\nyour bishop and prelate, giving him the proceeds and incomes, tithes and\r\nrevenues, and all things pertaining to him as bishop of that diocese.  And\r\nyou shall allow him to perform his pastoral duties and exercise his\r\nepiscopal jurisdiction in person or through his officials or vicars, in\r\nwhatever manner and in whatever form may be rightfully used according to\r\nthe said bulls, and as the laws of our kingdom sanction; and in all things\r\nand cases belonging to ecclesiastical jurisdiction, you shall give him all\r\nhelp and assistance.  And should he ask the aid of the secular arm, you\r\nwill grant it in conformity with the law, and each one and all shall not\r\nfail him in any way, under penalty of our displeasure and of five hundred\r\nthousand maravedis, forfeit to our exchequer.

As the said bishop has\r\nexplained to me that in order to go to reside in the said diocese, he will\r\nbe obliged to provide himself in the said province with a few things for\r\nhis voyage, he has begged me to order you to lend him from your funds the\r\nsum of two hundred ducats, or what I am pleased to give; and I approve. I\r\nhave therefore ordered in one of my documents, that five hundred thousand\r\nmaravedis in excess of the fourth part of the tithes of the said\r\nbishopric, are to be yearly given from our purse.  That he may have\r\nsufficient to maintain himself better, I command that out of whatever\r\nmaravedis are in your care, our treasurer shall give and pay to the said\r\nFray Bartholomew de Las Casas, or to his authorised representative, the\r\nsaid two hundred ducats, amounting to seventy-five thousand maravedis, and\r\nshall note it on the back of the said document above mentioned; as you pay\r\nit on account and in part payment of the said five hundred thousand\r\nmaravedis that we give him in this way each year, we have ordered that\r\nthese and other maravedis, which in these countries are to be given him,\r\nshall be deducted from the five hundred thousand maravedis.  You will take\r\nhis receipt or that of his authorised representative to show that the said\r\ntwo hundred “ducats” have been received on account.  Dated in Valladolid,\r\nthirteenth day of February 1544,—I, the Prince, countersigned by\r\nSamano—signed by the bishop of Cuenca, and Gre. Velasquez, Gregorio Lopez\r\ny Salmeron.\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCE.  Our officials in the province of Guatemala, or any other\r\npersons who may have been appointed to collect the tithes of the Bishop of\r\nChiapa, during the vacant bishopric.  Know ye that the Emperor King, my\r\nsovereign, because of the good reports he had of the character and merits\r\nof the Rev. Father in Christ, Fray Bartholomew de Las Casas of the\r\nDominican Order, presented him to the Holy Father as bishop of the said\r\ndiocese of the city of Ciudad Real of the plains of Chiapa, in place of\r\nthe licentiate Rev. Juan de Arteaga, former bishop, deceased.  The said\r\nbishop has begged me, in order to assist him in his many expenses until he\r\nstarts to the said bishopric and to pay the expenses of his bulls, to\r\ngraciously give him the tithes belonging to the church, that have\r\naccumulated since the decease of the said Rev. Juan de Arteaga, should I\r\nso wish, and I, agreeing to the above and to help him, do approve.  I\r\ntherefore command you to help and assist the said bishop or his authorised\r\nrepresentatives with any tithes you may have collected or that remain in\r\nthe said bishopric of Chiapa belonging to the church, from the day the\r\nsaid predecessor died until the day when he will enter and enjoy the five\r\nhundred thousand maravedis which we order to be given him.  Dated in\r\nValladolid thirteenth day of February 1544—I the Prince—by command of His\r\nHighness, Juan de Samano.\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCE.    Forasmuch as the Reverend Father in Christ, Fray\r\nBartholomew de Las Casas, bishop-elect of the city of Ciudad Real of the\r\nplains of Chiapa has informed me that it may happen that in the Cathedral\r\nof your said bishopric, there may not be more than one or two incumbents,\r\npresented by us and installed by you in the dignities, canonries, and\r\nprebends of the diocese, and, that not being more numerous, they must\r\ndivide amongst them all that pertains to the capitula mensa and promotes\r\nthe service of God our Lord and increases the divine cult in the said\r\nchurch.  Should this be the case, the persons who were installed and were\r\npresent should take what was required for its establishment, and out of\r\nthe remainder competent salaries should be given to some of the priests\r\nwho serve in the said church so long as there are no more beneficiaries,\r\nas we desire that the above mentioned may be corrected.    We order and\r\ncharge by these presents that, when it happens that in the said church\r\nthere are not at least four incumbents in residence, you will appoint up\r\nto the said number to fill the vacant places, and priests who lead\r\nexemplary lives and of the necessary abilities to serve in the said\r\nchurch, as its canons and priests should; you will give them a sufficient\r\nsalary from the funds that belong to the Order of the Chapter; first\r\npaying those who reside there and are ordained as the foundation statutes\r\nprovide.  And what may be left over from this and from the said salaries,\r\nwhich you will order to be paid from the said funds, you will order to be\r\ndivided among all those installed and named by you, according to what is\r\ndue to each.  But should it happen that four incumbents or more than are\r\nentitled to, reside in the said church, let them have from the funds of\r\nthe said Order of the Chapter, according to the foundation.  And you will\r\nendeavour to hold them to this and will report to our Council for the\r\nIndies by the first ships sailing, all particulars respecting the persons\r\nappointed, with their salaries as before mentioned, and their\r\ncapabilities, so that we may judge what will be most useful to the service\r\nof God our Lord, and to Holy Church.\r\n\r\nAnd take care to enlighten us when the funds increase, that we may appoint\r\nmore persons for the service of the said church.  And be careful that the\r\nsalaries you have to fix, do not exceed the usual amount allowed in like\r\ncases.  Dated in the town of Valladolid, thirteenth day of February 1544.\r\nI, the Prince, by command of His Highness, Juan de Samano, signed by the\r\nBishop of Cuenca, by the licentiate Gre. Velasquez, Gregorio Lopez y\r\nSalmeron.\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCE.  Our officials in New Spain; you already know how, on account\r\nof the good reports we have had of the character and merits of the\r\nReverend Father, Fray Bartholomew de Las Casas, we presented him to the\r\nbishopric of the province of Chiapa in the place of Don Juan de Arteaga\r\nthe late bishop; and as his bulls have been sent and their delivery cost\r\neighty-eight thousand, nine hundred and twenty-five maravedis, which\r\namount must be paid out of the five hundred thousand maravedis which we\r\nordered in another document to be given to him yearly in that country, and\r\nbecause our officials of India House, who reside in the city of Seville,\r\nhave by our order paid eighty-eight thousand nine hundred and twenty-five\r\nmaravedis, I ordered them to send you this my cedula in order that you\r\nmight repay it.  I therefore command you that of the five hundred thousand\r\nmaravedis which the said Fray Bartholomew de Las Casas receives from us in\r\nthat country, the two first years in succession, you will collect the said\r\neighty-eight thousand nine hundred and twenty-five maravedis which you\r\nwill send to the aforesaid officials at Seville, that we may be repaid\r\ntherefrom.\r\n\r\nDated, in Valladolid ist of April 1544, I, the Prince, countersigned by\r\nSamano, signed by the bishop of Cuenca, Velasquez, Gregorio Lopez y\r\nSalmeron.\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCE. Counsellors, judges, lawyers, gentlemen, esquires, officials,\r\nand all royal subjects of the city of Ciudad Real of the plains of Chiapa;\r\nknow ye that the Emperor King, my sovereign, on account of the good\r\nreports he had of the character, life, and habits of the Reverend Fray\r\nBartholomew de Las Casas, has presented him to this bishopric.   Because\r\nwe hope our Lord will be well served by him, we have ordered him to start\r\nwithout waiting for his bulls and we have provided him with what we\r\nthought necessary.  I charge and command you to honour him and treat him\r\njustly, and to ask his advice in whatever matters may occur and in\r\naccordance with the service of God our Lord and the good government of\r\nthis city, for I trust that by his good works and example and the great\r\nzeal he shows for the service of God and for His Majesty, he will counsel\r\nand guide you in whatever may contribute to the best results. Valladolid,\r\n23rd of February, etc.\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCE.  Venerable dean and chapter of the Cathedral of the bishopric\r\nof Chiapa: know ye that the Emperor King, my sovereign, because of the\r\ngood report he had of the character, life, and habits of Fray Bartholomew\r\nde Las Casas, has presented him to this bishopric; and because we hope\r\nthat our Lord will be well served by his mission and for the benefit of\r\nthe Holy Church, we have ordered him to start without waiting for his\r\nbulls to be granted to him, and we have ordered what provision we thought\r\nnecessary.  I charge and command you to honour him and to treat him with\r\nrespect and to take his advice in everything necessary for the government\r\nof the church during the time he is awaiting consecration, because I hope\r\nthat with his wise teachings, good example, and the zeal he shows in the\r\nservice of God and His Majesty, he will advise and direct what is most\r\nadvantageous to the best results.\r\n\r\nValladolid 23rd of February 1544, Idem, etc.\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCE. Presidents and Auditors of Our Audiencia and Royal Chancellery\r\nof the Confines: know ye that the Emperor King, my sovereign, on account\r\nof the good reports he had of the character, life, and habits of the\r\nReverend Fray Bartholomew de Las Casas, has presented him to the bishopric\r\nof the city of Ciudad Real of the plains of Chiapa.  With a view to the\r\ngood results we hope he will achieve in instructing and converting the\r\nnatives of his diocese, we have commanded him to depart without waiting\r\nfor his bulls.  Being the man he is and having had so much experience in\r\nthe affairs of those parts, we have entrusted to him to let us know what\r\nis happening over there, and what is necessary for the service of God our\r\nLord in that country and among its natives. Therefore I charge and command\r\nyou that whenever the said bishop has anything to relate to you you will\r\nlisten and endeavour to help him in the service of God, your Father and\r\nours.  And in whatever befalls him, you will help and favour and honour\r\nhim, according as his dignity demands.\r\n\r\nValladolid, 13th of February 1544—I, the Prince—by command of His Highness\r\nJuan de Samano, signed by the Bishop of Cuenca and the licentiate\r\nGutierrez Velasquez, Gregorio Lopez y Salmeron.\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCE.  President and judges of our Council and of Our Royal\r\nChancellery of the Confines; know ye that the Emperor King, my sovereign,\r\npresented the bishopric of the city of Ciudad Real of the plains of Chiapa\r\nto the licentiate Arteaga, and His Holiness, in response to the said\r\nrepresentation, conferred it upon him.  After his death, His Majesty,\r\npresented the said bishopric to Fray Bartholomew de Las Casas, whom we\r\nhave commanded to depart without waiting for his bulls, and to fulfil the\r\ngood we hope he will accomplish among the natives of the said bishopric.\r\nAnd that he may know the limits of the said bishopric, dividing it from\r\nthe bishoprics of Guatemala, Honduras, Tiascala, and Guascaco, I command\r\nthat upon his arrival there, you show him the limits to which the said\r\nbishopric of Chiapa extends.  Bearing in mind how the said Fray\r\nBartholomew de Las Casas has served and will serve us, and the good he can\r\ndo in the conversion of the natives in the said bishopric, the boundaries\r\nwhich will be pointed out to him must be quite distinct from the other\r\nbishoprics of the country, for as long as it is our wish—Dated in the town\r\nof Valladolid 13th day of February 1544—I, the Prince, etc.\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCE.  President and judges of our Audiencia and Royal Chancery of\r\nthe Confines.  Fray Bartholomew de Las Casas, bishop-elect of the city of\r\nCiudad Real of the plains of Chiapa, has informed me, and we all well\r\nknow, that he and the other priests of his Order have worked hard to bring\r\npeace to the provinces of Teçulatlan, Lacandon, and others that were\r\nengaged in warfare; these provinces are situated within the limits of the\r\nbishopric and he beseeches me, since he and the said priests have\r\nunderstood and are endeavouring to bring peace to the said provinces, to\r\nbe good enough to order that they shall be included within the limits of\r\nhis diocese; thus included, he would work with more love and zeal than any\r\nformer prelate to convert the natives to a knowledge of the Holy Catholic\r\nFaith, according to our wishes.  Our Council of the Indies having\r\nconsidered this, it was agreed that I should send you this my cedula, and\r\nas I approved, I command you to see to the above.  Should the said\r\nprovinces of Teçulatlan and Lacandon be outside the limits of the said\r\ndiocese of Chiapa, you will arrange that the said Fray Bartholomew de Las\r\nCasas has them under his charge as prelate, until His Holiness, upon our\r\npresentation, appoints a prelate over the said provinces.  Let the said\r\nbishop-elect have charge of the spiritual affairs in those provinces and\r\nas prelate take a fourth part of the tithes which belong to him in the\r\nsaid provinces; the other three quarters shall be distributed among the\r\necclesiastical ministries already in existence in the said provinces and\r\nin the repairs and the decorations of the churches of them.
